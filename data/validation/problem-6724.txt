Natasha opened the door and peeked inside before motioning that it was safe. They went in one by one and fanned out in the wide entryway. The wood floor creaked loudly underneath their weight and Tony couldn't help but be grateful that Bruce wasn't hulked out right now. From what they could see where they stood there was a hallway that connected to the rest of the main floor, a flight of stairs that went up and next to them a flight of stairs that went down.
But Bruce wasn't there. His reflection was, pressed up against the mirror, pounding on it and staring straight at Clint with a horrified expression. He pressed his hand to the mirrors cold surface, right where Bruce's cheek was. The moment they touched Clint flew backwards, slamming into a tall dresser so hard it tipped over, taking him with it.
When no one replied his crying turned to sobs. He knew he was the only one left. He was going to be the last to die. Clint started to contemplate just crawling out and letting them have their way with him. He started shifting his legs so he could open it, but paused when he heard heavy, booted footsteps coming down the stairs.”
Natasha paused in front of it, her eyes glued to the window again. She could have sworn the people had been looking at the sun before but now they were all facing forward, looking straight at her. She suppressed a shiver and turned back to the door.
He pressed his hand against the glass, right where Natasha's hand was. Her hand wrapped around his and her smile turned wicked, as she began to pull him in. Thor fought against he grip, pulling back, only to be pulled in further.
“He went into that house,” Black Widow, said pointing to the large, fenced off, house. The place definitely looked like it had seen better days and it didn’t look like a great place to hide. Not that the guy they were after was the brightest crayon in the box.
“Why not?” Tony whined. They did this song and dance at least once a week, and Tony knew he was acting like a brat, but Rhodey bear never complained, only laughed heartily and told Tony he missed him too.
“You knew, Clint. Why didn't you stop us from coming in? You could have saved me. It's your fault, but if you come at it will be all better. I promise, I will make it better. When have I ever broken a promise to you? You know I love you, Clint. I'll forgive you if you come out.”
Steve nodded. “Iron Man and I will take this floor then. Keep communication and meet back here when you are done.”
“I was just stating the truth, there is a reasonable explanation for everything,” Bruce retorted, starting to count backwards slowly in his head.
“Guys, it doesn’t matter, we're going in whether you like it or not.” Captain America intervened, already starting up the path.
Hysterical laughter filled the air, like that of a small child, and it sent a shiver down his spine. Clint sat up dizzily, he could feel the blood running down the back of his neck from where his head had collided with a drawer handle. When he looked back to the mirror he saw the Hulk pounding against his side, cracking it.
“He is referring to 'ghosts',” Bruce answered for him, having changed back while they had waited for the Widow to confirm their targets location. “Which are just a baseless superstition and do not exist.”
“I'm not leaving withou-” Steve was cut off when Tony's hand closed around his throat. He looked down in shock and Tony's dead face stared back.
He lifted his head to look at the wooden structure that once held the mirror. There were still a few piece there, but most of it was shattered on the floor. Clint chocked on his tears as he struggled to stand. He had to leave, he had to get out of here because if he stayed any longer he would die. Just like Bruce had.
“Clint, Hawkeye, what are you talking about who's gone? Who are 'they'?” the sheer terror and sorrow he could hear in Clint’s usually cocky voice seemed so out of place it only put Steve on edge more.”
“No! Leave me alone!” He screeched, shooting arrow after arrow right through the illusion that was his father and into the stairs behind him.
Tony gave him a confused look before glancing around the room, his gaze resting on the stove. It was on.
“Then we're going to have to go in after him,” Captain America announced and Tony rolled his eyes. Leave it to Steve to want to go into the creepy ass house.
“I'll take this one,” Tony said, motioning to the one he was closest too. Steve nodded, he never did speak much when they were on a mission, and opened his own door.
Thor took a step towards her, but when he did the grip on her leg tightened and she was swept off her feet. She clawed at the wooden floor as she was pulled underneath the bed in one swift motion, disappearing with a scream.
And that’s when the pain started. He could feel something stabbing through the middle of his chest, right where the arc reactor is. He cursed his luck as he reached a shaky hand up to grab at the large, splintered piece of wood sticking out of his chest. What were the chances that he would get something in his most vulnerable spot.
“Whatever,” Hawkeye just gave him a dirty look and moved on, pulling off the sheet faster than they had been before.
Steve chuckled and opened his door. Inside was a neat looking office. There was a large desk in the middle of the room with a plush chair behind it. There was still papers scattered across it, one of which had a pen laying on it, like the owner had left only temporarily, planning on coming back. To add to that feeling was a a half-full brandy glass, sitting next to one of the paper piles.
“Ah, fuck, yeah, but I think Clint was right,” Tony groaned as he got to his feet. He was about to ask Jarvis to check the state of the suit and maybe call for back up when everything went black.
Clint was too afraid to answer, to move. It might be a lie. They could be playing another trick on him, trying to lure him out. He curled up tighter as the voices outside continued on, Bruce's voice joining them.
“That explains the tea, kinda,” she said to herself, shutting the door behind her as she moved to the next room.
The creature screamed at him and he screamed back. It lunged forward and dug its fingers into his eyes, curling them so that they could hold onto him, before sinking back into the tub dragging him with, face first into the water. He scream of pain was cut off when he hit the water and struggled as hard as he could as water invaded his mouth and nose. He felt his hand crush something in the water and he pulled free coughing up water as a shriek echoed throughout the room.
“Steve, Steve, where are you? I'm scared.” Clint admitted, burying his face in his knees. He couldn't remember ever feeling so terrified or so alone in his entire life.
“He's gone, he's gone. They took him, he's gone.” Clint rambled when he turned on his comm, more to himself than to Steve.
Steve grinned slightly and moved down the hallway into the next room. It was a dinning room with a long table in the middle of the room, multiple chairs sitting around it. There was a large chandelier hanging above it, but that was all that was in the room so they moved on.
Tony used their GPS placement to get the address and pulled up the houses history. “This was the Rayker family house. The Rayker's were a well off family in the 1890's. One day though, they disappeared. No one knows what happened and the police report came up with nothing. They just... vanished. Any attempts made to clean out the house always resulted in some type of accident where people went missing or got hurt. After fifteen deaths or disappearances they gave up and left it as we see it now.”
Tony's was a very old fashion bathroom that sent him into a gagging fit and made him close his face mask again. The entire thing looked rotted and smelled like it too. The bathtub  was filled to the brim with what Tony guessed was very old, stagnant water and there were swarms of flies above it, many of which dive bombed Tony's face before escaping into the hallway. He shut the door quickly and turned back to Steve, shaking his head. “There is no way in HELL anyone could be in there.”
Steve lead the way into a large living room and Tony followed behind him, moving his mask back from his face. There was a thick coating of dust covering the entire room. A large couch was by one wall, opposite a large fire place. There was a portrait above it displaying the ideal looking happy family. It gave Tony the creeps.
“Hello? Avengers? Natasha? Thor? Bruce? Clint? It anyone there!?” Steve yelled, his very soul filling with despair.
“Tony's dead.” his voice cracked when he said that and he felt a heartbroken hollowness fill him all over again. “Are you still in the basement? Are you safe?”
Natasha just nodded before moving to her first door. She opened it and looked inside. It was a simple sitting room. There were plush chairs in a semi-circle around a table in the center of the room. The table was covered in a fancy looking tea set and when she looked closer she could see the tea still sitting in the cup.
Steve squatted down in front of the crawlspace and grinned at Clint, who was still curled up in the crawlspace, his lips and throat shredded open and bleeding. His eyes completely missing. “Peek-a-boo.”
They walked carefully, sticking close to each other so as not to get lost or trip over anything. Bruce pulled the sheets off the things as they went, making Clint cough at all the dust that flew into the air.
A boney hand grabbed him by the throat, pulling him back under. He struggled against it, fighting to get free as the fingers of its other hand clawed at his mouth, trying to pry it open. It pressed harder the more he fought, tearing at his flesh and ripping his lips and throat apart, his blood staining the water.
Both he and Steve jumped to attention. They rushed out of the kitchen to go see what the cause was, but when they came into the dinning room they skidded to a halt. The table was pushed up against the far wall, right in front of the door with the chairs stacked on top of it.
He heard loud bangs upstairs, a tortured scream and an eerie shriek that made his hair stand on end. It was silent for a moment then he heard a splash. Then nothing.
Steve stood up straight, holding Tony's limp body in his arms, cradling it against his chest. “Avengers, make your way to the nearest exist and leave immediately.”
“Just forget it,” Clint snapped, turning away to look at the giant mirror he had just uncovered. “That's a big mirror.”
“Safe? Never safe. Can't trust you eyes, it's a lie it all a lie. Trust nothing, trust no one. Only out is safe. Never left, none of them. No one ever leaves. Go. Go now or they'll get you, Steve. Not real, nothing is real. They're playing with you're head. It's a game. All a game. Out is win. Out is safe.” He rambled, he felt like he was losing his mind. Nothing made sense anymore and it just made it worse that he knew he was going to die. They were all going to die.
“What do you mean 'paranormal'?” Thor said and Clint looked like he was about to cough up a hairball.
“No, No. You're dead. You, you killed yourself. YOUR DEAD.” Clint screamed, backing away as his father just laughed, following him down.
Clint's head flew up so fast he smacked at on the ceiling. “I'm over here!” he yelled,opening the door carefully.
The last thing Thor heard was Captain America screaming Tony's name. Then the window exploded, shattering the parts of him that were in it and imbedding its piece in the rest of him. 	Everything went black.
“I don't...” he signed, frustrated. He was going to fight to the very last breath dammit (even if he would much rather spend his last moments looking at Steve). But he had to try. He had to. Millions of lives depended on it. “It's not nuclear. But it's... it has all this components. They shouldn't even work together, how did he even do that? It should have short-circuited, not...“ Tony stopped.
“Janet Van Dyne,” Steve said. It was a very risky name to use but he didn’t have another one. Janet Van Dyne, while not on his team, was sort of an honorary member. Ever since Steve and his team saved her husband’s very dangerous and important blueprints from being stolen, Janet was very grateful and very persistent in joining their ranks. She was fierce and determined and powerful all on her own, but she was a civilian and innocent and Steve couldn’t risk her. But every now and then when they needed it, she was always willing to help. She was the one who enabled them entrance to the gala by making sure their fake names made it onto the guest list.
“Traffic is always terrible, Steve,” said Natasha, cutting through his excuses without even blinking.
Steve smiled but it didn’t last long. His mind was on the conversation he was about to have with Tony. He didn’t want to go back on his decision to tell Tony his story. He knew he was going to do it as soon as he made the decision in the restaurant. But that didn’t mean that the words are going to be easy to say. And everything felt so light and happy that Steve didn’t really want to spoil the moment. But Tony was looking at him now, a frown on his face.
When Steve founded the organization, right after coming home from the army, he did it because of people like them. Finding out some disturbing facts about the people responsible for the sufferings Steve had witnessed made him want to bring them to justice in any way he could. Because they were untouchable by law. Money bought them power and power bought them security. So Steve decided to do something about it. And he wasn’t alone in that.
The night felt too peaceful for all the thoughts running through his head. He needed a distraction, something else to focus on.
“Are you saying the Iron Man painting isn’t the only thing worth seeing here?” Steve joked. Then panicked that he went too far, but Tony only laughed.
“Right,” Stark said. He took another sip of his drink, looking at Steve, contemplating something. Steve had no idea what was going on in his head. “Another question. Up for it?”
Steve left it alone. It was already a miracle they hadn’t bitten each other’s heads off during the mission, he wasn’t going to press his luck any further.
“But I didn't die,” Tony said. “You saved me.” He said it softly, almost a whisper but not quite, as if afraid of Steve's reaction but not enough not to say it.
Still, Steve didn’t lose his balance. He just straightened and came in, leaving the shield on the table near the entrance.
Steve blinked, looking away. He didn’t even notice he turned his head to look at Tony instead of the TV.
“Tony!” the next kick to the robots' head was particularly violent and Tony tried not to think he was the cause of that frustration. “For the love of God, just once do as you're told, and
Stark – Tony? Should he call him Tony is his head now too? – smiled. “That’s better. Anyway, where was I?”
But his team (well, two of them) needed him and he couldn't let them down. He couldn't let Steve (dad? Himself?) down. It all came back to the same insecurities, same issues.
But no matter how much he liked his night job, he knew that he put his life to the backburner and maybe he shouldn’t have. He couldn’t be the Captain all the time, even when being Steve Rogers seemed like a harder job to do.
. It was an often argument between the two of them. Her insisting he should find someone, him saying he had no time nor desire to do so with the line of work he was in.
Steve didn’t. And he should figure out what to say before Stark – Tony, dammit – gets suspicious. He didn’t want to know what a man with his influence and intelligence would be able to dig up on Steve.
Like he said. Tony was a busy person. Steve was just a poor artist from Brooklyn. Not someone Tony Stark would take an interest to.
The rest of the dinner went by in easy conversation, laughing and teasing and just learning more about each other. Steve couldn’t stop laughing at some of Tony’s MIT stories, and Tony in turn was amazed at Steve’s less than successful attempts at stopping his neighborhood bullies.
Steve nodded. “Good. You’ll need to give it to SHIELD.” Tony looked at him sharply. “You know who they are, right?” Steve added, unsure.
“You know, I could really go for some pizza,” Tony said when he came back. “Or do you want something else?”
“Steve,” Tony turned to face him and brought his hands to Steve’s shoulders. “I deleted all the footage, and not even SHIELD will manage to salvage it. Trust me on this, okay, technological genius here, remember?” Tony smiled. “And your friend, Mrs. Carter has taken care of any witnesses that would talk, okay? We’re safe. I promise.”
“How...” Well, that would explain why Tony tried so hard even when he didn't have to, and acted as if he had to earn his place in the team even when he did so a thousand times over. But... “Why... I mean, how could Howard not see what an amazing and brilliant person Tony was...
"It's not about trust," Steve yelled. They were still in the building, and more bad guys could find them any second now, but it's like neither of them cared in that moment. "It's about you always thinking you can do everything on your own. You're not the only person stuck in this situation."
Tony didn’t blush but Steve could tell it was a close thing. “Yeah, well. We can do that after. I do really think we should talk some more.”
All throughout the day, he could not stop noticing the lack of colors. The Quinjet was grey. SHIELD headquarters were grey. Grey, grey, grey.
Tony shifted on the chair. “The thing is, I’ve been looking for my weapons for a while now. Even before you contacted me. I have found most of them, but the ones that the Mandarin took… They have been hard to track. I’ve been hitting a dead end for a while now. But then you guys found some of them. And it gave me an idea. See, until then, I’ve been laying low. You couldn’t track anything back to me. But then I started making some noise. The Mandarin knew you involved me now. And I knew he couldn’t afford me snooping around.”
Suddenly, there was a noise in the hallway. Tony looked at Steve with wide eyes. “I thought you were watching the door.”
Tony had gone with the SHIELD operatives to make sure the terrorists were put safely behind bars. He has not come back yet.
“It's not that simple,” Steve said, looking (or, well, glaring might be more accurate) at how some guy was clinging to Tony as if he wanted to jump him then and there. And it wasn’t like Tony was doing anything to dissuade him, if the way he rested his hand around the guy's waist was any indication. Said guy was even whispering something in Tony's ear and Tony was laughing and it made Steve hurt all over. It was only his perfect control that was keeping him from rushing over and punching the guy in the face. That would probably end badly for everyone involved. He could already see the headline 'Captain America punching innocent civilian because of jealousy'.
“Steve, look,” Natasha started and the seriousness in her tone was what made Steve really pay attention because it wasn't the usual blank seriousness she wore like a blanket, it was laced with feelings and understanding, the likes of which she rarely showed. “Tony, he... well as you might have realized, he likes to portray himself as this arrogant, egotistical person who only cares about himself, but... I think we both know that's not the truth. He's self-destructive and insecure. Probably even more then we realize because he's very good at hiding any kind of weaknesses...“
Still, he doubted he would see Stark again. The man was probably busy developing some new peace of tech for his company or running the meetings who knows where in the world.
Tony waited for Steve to put the glass back on the table before speaking again. “How long was I out?”
Tony’s mouth opened on a silent gasp. He still didn’t say anything, letting Steve say everything in his own time.
Steve’s mouth opened on a gasp, like the words were the last thing he expected to hear. “You do?” he asked, breathless.
Tony exhaled. Relaxed. Calmed down. It wouldn't do him any good to panic now. Steve looked more and more worried by the second and Tony tried to reassure him with his eyes. It didn't seem to be working.
So you can imagine his annoyance when Fury (once again) insisted that Tony couldn’t bring the armor for the next mission.
Steve hesitated. Peggy was right when she said that he didn’t have a life outside of his job. He had nothing but his art, and they already discussed that. Bringing it up again might seem like he was fishing for compliments.
“Just got a lot on my mind, is all,” he said carefully. She didn’t answer, letting him decide whether he wanted to continue or not. “I just want to be done with Hammer, you know? The guy’s been managing to avoid us for far too long.” She nodded, and while he could tell she knew that wasn’t everything, she still didn’t push. Which in the end made him blurt out, “I saw Tony again.”
worth it,” he said, looking Tony in the eyes with as much sincerity as he could muster. “You're worth everything.” He didn't wait for Tony to deny it again, just kissed him, pouring every feeling into that one kiss, hoping Tony would understand.
Tony looked at Steve who was still holding him by the shoulders, frowning, no doubt thinking how this all could have ended had Doom not fled the scene.
“And how do you see me?” Tony opened his eyes. They seemed to hold on a challenge Steve was happy to accept.
“What are we going to say though?” Clint asked, nervous. He turned toward Tony. “If you hurt Steve, we’re going to kick your ass, even though you have bodyguards and money and very expensive lawyers. Oh, and a highly weaponized, could-turn-us-to-dust-in-a-second, suit of armor.”
He knew he should at least try. But the nerves and the anticipation didn’t let him rest. This was the moment he has been unknowingly waiting for, for the past five years.
Tony cleared his throat, “Anyway, that’s all super classified, so if you could keep it to yourself, that would be great.”
And Steve knew that. They tried. Tightened the security, put up viruses, firewalls, all kinds of stuff Steve didn’t really understand. But it was all nothing to Iron Man, he tore through their system like it was child’s play. Maybe for him it was.
“Do you see what I’m usually dealing with?” Stark rolled his eyes. “Trust me, those people never have good ideas, or they have an idea but have no clue how to make it happen so they expect me to do it.”
“Yeah, it's me, just keep focusing on me.” Steve said. Tony frowned. Was he really so out of it that it even had Steve worried? He thought he was keeping it together.
“About…” Steve seemed to hesitate for a moment. Then he looked at Tony and sighed. “About how no matter how many times I try to bench you when you’re hurt or outside the suit, you will always put yourself in danger.”
“Fine,” he answered, his voice sounding loud and raspy in the quiet, despite how hard he tried to make it soft like hers.
Lost in his thoughts, hours passed without Tony noticing. He kept replaying last night in his head, every sound Steve made, every promise he said.
“And who am I?” Tony asked. He was usually so full of energy, it was weird to see him be so still, so focused. Serious. “Am I Tony Stark? A genius, billionaire with a narcissistic streak and a penchant for young blondes? Am I Iron Man, a guy who can’t listen to orders and likes to do everything by himself, which would include big explosions and property damage? Am I your boyfriend or the guy you won’t call when things get serious because you don’t trust him not to blow up your boyfriend for allegedly illegally selling weapons? Who am I Steve? Who am I to you?”
How, and why, would Loki want to bring statues to life was a mystery to Tony but this wasn't the time to dwell on the reasonings of a psychotic Norse alien. So Tony, hidden from said crazy god's view did the only reasonable thing (that wouldn't get him killed at least) and called Thor.
When Tony was out of view, Steve signed and walked back to where Natasha was still sitting. He picked up the glass of whiskey he left earlier and downed it.
He didn’t want to admit it at the time, but seeing Tony as the Captain left him more unsettled than he thought it would. Sure, he knew it was not going to be easy, being in front of Tony. But actually experiencing it? Having Tony look at him with cold eyes and borderline distaste? It made Steve sick thinking about it.
Steve, oblivious to Tony's inner thoughts, said softly, “I'm going to go check on Natasha and maybe see how the people affected most by the gas are holding up.” He sounded resigned, as if all the fight went out of him and he just wanted to leave it all behind.
Steve wasn’t stupid. He knew he had nothing much to offer to someone like Tony Stark. One night stand seemed like the most likely outcome, and Steve counted himself lucky he even got a chance to just talk to Tony for a few hours in his Tower beforehand.
Then the face tattoo guy was suddenly there, and it was all Steve could do to stay on his feet. He lost count of the other guys, but hoped Tony was holding his own. He had to remind himself that Tony was Iron Man, and no matter what else that meant, he wasn't a stranger to fighting.
“What the hell were you thinking?” Yep, definitely mad. He was also wearing that disapproving expression only Captain America could. It somehow looked worried as well, but Tony blamed that on the head injury. “You could've compromised the entire mission, I told you to stay away!”
It was worth it when Steve, getting out of the quinjet, sent him a proud, if slightly surprised, smile.
Everything had happened so quickly. Tony was talking to a brilliant, young neurobiologist, whose name he was currently forgetting, glancing subtly every now and then at Steve who seemed to be in deep conversation with Natasha. Then suddenly he was in front of Tony, saying things that didn’t make sense in Tony’s brain, and everything was too much, emotions he fought so hard to burry for so long threatening to overflow.
After a while, Tony untangled from him, and Steve missed his warmth almost immediately. But it was late, and they had work to do. Tomorrow was a big day.
“Why?” the word was sharp, somehow accusatory, and Tony didn't even realize he said it before he did.
Steve frowned. Whatever it was, it sounded more serious than Steve originally thought. “You can tell me Natasha.”
Well fuck. Steve wasn’t one for cursing but he felt like it now. “Purely by accident,” Steve said, making it up as he went along, “It was some gallery exhibition or something, I can’t really remember it anymore. We sort of started to talk about art and the next thing I knew, she adopted me.” Steve smiled shyly, the way Natasha would sometimes when she was lying through her teeth.
Peggy called to say that Tony’s evidenced matched up and he was free of all charges. Turns out that Stane sold quite a lot of weapons behind Tony’s back, and Tony has been trying to find them for a while now. Now he finally had a lead. Steve didn’t like Tony getting involved with the Mandarin but he also knew he didn’t have a choice but to let him. Tony would not listen to the Captain and Steve Rogers didn’t know anything about it. It was a messy situation, one that Steve hoped would get resolved soon.
His Iron Man painting stood right in the middle of the wall, straight ahead. It would be impossible to miss it, walking in.
"He's the least of your problems now," Steve said, hoping they would leave Tony alone for a few more minutes to focus on him.
Steve took a lamp from a nearby desk and smashed it on the one guy’s head, while avoiding another guy’s punch. Then he kicked that guy in the chest with his knee. He stared at the three guys that came into the room next. He could take them, easy. But the problem was that they would just keep coming. And Steve won’t be able to fight forever.
Steve looked at the monitors. They showed various maps, with all the Mandarin’s bases. Steve came closer to look at them.  He turned to Tony.
The dream changed for the third time. A blank canvas was in front of him, waiting to be made into art. His brush had been dipped into bright red color. Less like the red of the nails from the previous dream and more like the metallic red from the first one. He put the brush to the canvas. His hand glided through, removing blankness from the paper, occasionally going back to dip into more paint, more red. He could not see the whole picture he was painting - such was the way in the dream - but he saw the lines his hands made and knew it was beautiful, masterful. He could not wait to see it.
Dismissed for the moment, the Avengers returned home to the Tower. Its stark white walls and modern grey furniture didn't give him the color he seemed to want, but it was comforting nonetheless. This was home, every last inch of it, the kind Steve never thought he'd have.
“Yeah, well... I know that must have been hard for you. So... thanks. I guess,” Tony rarely saw Steve be so awkward and unsure. It was a weird sight, especially when he was still in his Captain America uniform.
“You know why,” Steve said, his expression earnest, like he was trying to get a point across but Tony just
Steve nodded but he was distracted, distant. Something was bothering him. He couldn't stop looking around, looking for a splash of color. A spattering of red on the floor was blood but it was covered with dust as everything else. That was not what he was looking for.
Iron Man, while helpful in a fight, didn’t stay long after all was said and done. Barely making sure they got the situation under control, he flew away, making excuses in the air, before cutting the communication completely.
Maybe if he had acknowledged it, if he didn’t took it out on Tony, things would have been different.
Soon after pizza came, they decided to watch a movie. And while Steve loved all the various outings he got to do with Tony, his favorites were definitely those quiet, casual nights, where it was just the two of them. He loved the intimacy of it, the closeness.
“If I didn’t lie to you,” Steve added. It was one of his biggest regrets, and the cost of it will forever haunt him.
Tony was laying on his side, his head on Steve’s chest. Steve’s hand on Tony’s waist. Steve wasn’t sure what the movie was called, but it was a mindless action movie that was perfect for the evening. Steve didn’t care about it, anyway. He was more concentrated on Tony’s warmth next to him.
A long overdue shower was what all of them craved and Steve especially itched to get the colorless dust off of him. After, he put on his most vibrant sweater, a blue, white and red monstrosity Natasha got him one Christmas. He could not understand his restlessness and fixation with colors so he tried to let it out by painting. He had not painted a lot in his life, preferring the efficiency and simplicity of a pen. But that evening he got all of his colors out and in the end he painted the most beautiful landscape, all greens and yellows, oranges and browns.
But Steve’s eyes were drawn to the far wall, where Iron Man armors, at least a dozen of them, stood behind glass, on display.
Then Tony moved, suddenly and unexpectedly, but he seemed to forget the glass he was still holding in his hands because it slipped from his fingers before he could catch it.
, but he didn't speak Japanese so his efforts were fruitless, but he looked so desperate and Tony had to do something.
He tasted of coffee and coconut, and Steve couldn’t help but open up for more, hands going around Tony’s waist and bringing them even closer together. They seemed to fit together like puzzle pieces and Steve didn’t even care in that moment that it sounded like a cliché.
“I don’t get it,” Clint said, frustrated. He was pacing back and forth, glancing at the barricaded door every few seconds. “How could SHIELD betray us?”
“He said he’s making progress but he didn’t want to indulge any details,” Natasha said with a wry twist to her lips.
He also seemed to be the leader of their little group, because as soon as one of the minions saw that Steve was awake, he gestured to the face tattoo guy, who turned around and smiled.
, Steve thought, somewhat guiltily. He never once, since starting this thing with Tony, thought about bragging about it. But he wanted to now. He wanted to show it under Iron Man’s nose.
Steve sat down, while Tony went to get them something to drink. “Are you hungry? We could order something,” Tony said from the bar.
Steve could see that it was bothering Tony. He probably wanted to just do it, and be done with it, start focusing on the new and brighter things. He didn’t seem like the patient sort of guy.
“Here’s our ride,” Tony said. He was still tense from their conversation, and there was wariness in his eyes that Steve wasn’t familiar with.
There was pain now, in Tony's expression, but he still didn't say anything. This was the longest Tony had ever been quiet and Steve hated every minute of it. “God, please Tony, say something.”
And Tony resented that, he had been thinking, hence taking the gun and all that instead of rushing to the battle bare-handed and with no plan at all, but he assumed Steve would not be pleased either way so Tony kept his mouth shut (and wasn't that a miracle?).
“I… I mean… I didn’t… Maybe a little bit?” Steve cringed. He wasn’t planning on telling Tony, but now that he asked, he also didn’t want to lie. The fact was that, he
At least his team was here with him, but that didn't seem like a blessing right now, when he could feel walls closing in on him, air becoming thinner, voices around him turning into a distanced blur. He didn't want them to see him like this. Weak. Helpless. Plagued by nightmares, new and old.
Steve didn’t ask what he was talking about. He didn’t have to. But he didn’t have an answer. “I don’t know.”
And then there was the view. The windows covered the entire wall and it almost looked like they weren’t there at all, like there was nothing between them and New York City below.
Tony whirled the bourbon in his glass. He was looking down at his phone, video frozen on Morgan’s smile.
He couldn't believe he was just going to wait for back-up. In normal circumstances, he would just ignore Steve and deal with Loki on his own but with Steve still being mad at him...
When he walked into the big conference room, Natasha and Clint were already there, discussing something in low tones.
Thor, who still hadn't exactly managed to grasp the idea of mobile phones. Tony didn't bother to leave a message. Instead he called Steve and only after the fact did he realize that he and Steve weren't exactly on good terms and he could have called any of the other Avengers.
Tony leaned in and Steve closed his eyes. But just before he kissed him, Tony exclaimed, “I got it!”
“Don’t worry,” Steve said. “We have a person on the inside. You can trust her.” Steve pulled a card with Peggy’s information out of his pocket and put it in front of Tony.
Before Steve could start speaking for the third time though, Thor decided to join in the conversation. “Oh, is this about Captain’s thing with Tony Stark?”
Steve picked up the pace in the long hallway on his way to the briefing room. He wasn’t technically late, but he was known for usually getting there early, so the fact that he wasn’t there yet might raise a few eyebrows.
Steve wasn’t sure why Stark was asking that. He seemed to be going from topic to topic without a pause, asking questions, carrying a conversation almost all by himself. His brain worked very fast and Steve doubted this was his first cup of coffee.
Tony looked so sad looking back at Steve but his fingers were still slowly going through his hair so Steve was counting that as a win. “Steve,” it was like Tony couldn't stop saying his name, had to say it to convince himself Steve was real and really there. “Steve, I break everything I touch. I'll break you. I'll hurt you. I'm not worth it,” Tony said and that last sentence sounded so small but so sure and Steve had to close his eyes at the amount of anger he felt at everyone who ever made Tony feel that way, Howard Stark being first on the list.
The fundraiser they were attending was nice, he could at least admit that much. The gala they were in was enormous, ceiling barely visible, mirrors covering walls that weren't already occupied by windows. Steve stood on a raised platform near the bar overlooking the room. It wasn't the best position, considering...
“Steve Rogers,” Stark said, as if he was remembering the name as he spoke it. He was out of the expensive, tailored suit he was wearing at the gala, but he still managed to look overly put together just wearing faded jeans and a T-shirt with a logo that Steve didn’t recognize. He also had a fancy coat on which didn’t seem to match at all with the rest of his outfit but still somehow suited him.
It’s been a while since he let himself have this, always on high alert at the compound, always busy, always working.
Tony didn’t open his eyes at first. Steve held his breath as he waited. And then Tony slowly blinked, adjusting to the light. And the first thing he saw was Steve.
Steve made a mental note to ask Bruce if there was a way to send Tony a message. As their tech guy, he was the one most likely to know. Steve will bring it up tomorrow, on their next meeting. The others would have to know as well.
What they saw on the far end of the opposite wall made Tony freeze. Natasha and Clint were already there, looking worried.
.” Tony was breathing hard by the end of that little rant but at least it seemed to deflate all of his anger. He was just tired now.
) could still be felt whenever they were in a room together so most of the other Avengers have taken to avoiding them (except for Natasha, but nothing fazed
Steve groaned. “Do you have a death wish?” he asked, because they didn’t even discuss his teammate’s identities with each other, let alone in front of said team.
“I know. Contact him when we get to the base,” Steve said. He hated the knowing look she gave him, the fact that everyone knew about the animosity between them.
“Shall we begin?” he asked casually. When no one answered, he began, “Okay, so we should start with…”
“What the hell were you thinking?” Steve asked and just as Tony opened his mouth to answer, started again. “No, don't answer that, clearly you weren't thinking.”
Steve tried not to come off as too defensive. Sam didn’t know any better, after all. “No. There is no thing with Tony Stark, okay? And we didn’t find anything on him either.”
The guy laughed again. “Fine, fine. I’ll tell him,” He seemed to pause for dramatic effect. “Your dear boyfriend is on his way here right now.”
Steve just raised an eyebrow, “I said everything I wanted to, yesterday, now it’s your time to talk.”
“Three.” Steve went to slam the shield to the glass but Tony’s soft “JARVIS” had JARVIS opening the door right before the collision happened.
“I think I liked it. That I could rile you up like that when everyone always said you were usually so stoic.”
Tony’s hand trailed down Steve’s arm, sending shivers up Steve’s spine. “I don’t know. It would have to be something catchy.”
The guy just continued to smile. It’s how Steve knew he wasn’t really lying. “You see, Tony Stark got a bit over his head. He started researching our boss. Looking for his weapons, you see. And our boss didn’t like that. So, he kidnaped him.”
“Steve...” Natasha said in a soft voice. Steve didn't like it at all. “Steve,” she hesitated then, as if unsure whether she should tell him something or not. It was another thing she usually didn't show and Steve was glad to see her be so open with him. “I'm not sure I'm the right person to tell you this but I have a feeling Tony won't and you need to know.”
“I know,” Tony said, but the hitch in his breath betrayed him. He didn’t know. He wasn’t sure, until now, that it was really true. Like the fact that Steve Rogers loved Tony Stark wasn’t engraved in every star in all the universes.
Everybody knew about him and Tony almost immediately. It was hard to keep it from them, since Steve was photographed next to Tony on numerous occasions and the gossip pages on the newspapers were filled with speculation. It made Steve wary, having so many eyes on him, but he was confident in his cover. A few nosy paparazzi were not going to find him out any time soon.
“Because…” Steve started. This part was tricky. “Because we have no reason to suspect you. And you came here willingly which makes us believe you have nothing to hide. We’re willing to listen to your explanation if you have one.”
The others joined him now. They were all looking at Steve, some with hatred, some with manic smiles. Steve and his team made their lives a lot more difficult. They all wanted a turn with that knife.
Steve continued working on the Quinjet. He was hoping that if he appeared busy, Iron Man would leave without talking to him again.
“Innocent? Steve, darling, I know how you feel about him, but this is some strong evidence against him. You know this breaks my heart. I was so happy you finally found someone, but…”
It was the last thing Steve wanted. Those last seven years without Tony have been torture. Sure, in the last five, since Thanos, he had seen him here and there. But it was rare, and they didn’t talk much, Tony’s words from after he came back to Earth ringing clearly in Steve’s head.
Steve pulled out, wringing a tired moan from Tony, before laying down on the bed. “So how was that?” Steve asked, wiping his hand absentmindedly on the sheets. (Which will be a bitch to clean up later, but Steve didn’t care about that now.)
“What is there left to ‘discuss’? You had a plan, I came up with a better one, and I saved the day.” Tony sneered at Steve. “Is that what got you in a tizzy, Rogers? The public cast me as the hero this round, not you.”
Steve nodded. “Okay.” He moved forward and took Tony’s chin in his hand gently, tilted it up and reached his lips.
He avoided his teammates with the plug in, though. While the vibrations were quiet, he knew Steve would be able to hear it, and Natasha and Clint both had the uncanny ability of knowing everything that was going on around them. Bruce was unsettlingly perceptive when he wanted to be, and knowing his luck, Thor would realize what was happening and announced it to the rest of the team.
“Look, I’d love nothing more than for him to walk around shirtless. But since his pecs and abs could rupture reality as we know it, it’s probably best he’d wear clothes. The world isn’t ready for that much sexiness.” Then Tony remembered what that robot was supposed to be doing and glared at him. “Hey, didn’t I tell you to take that down that shrine—J, was he working on that at all?”
Before Steve can reply, Tony glared and muttered, “Don’t bother,” before turning his back on him again.
Something bumped against Steve’s knee and he reluctantly looked away. “Thanks, Dummy,” he said, taking the glass of green liquid from the bot’s metal hand. Dummy beeped happily before returning to his creator’s side.
“We figured you'd want some company,” Steve added softly, still smiling. “Didn’t want to leave you all alone in this big tower. You've gotten too used to someone being around.”
Tony’s fidgeting with his bow tie was interrupted by Steve’s hand grabbing and pulling Tony’s elbow.
Tony turned to look at him. Steve didn't look taunting, more matter of fact if anything. Clint on the other hand was openly smirking, that bastard. Clint’s eyes dropped to Tony’s groin and Tony’s breathing quickened.
“Listen.” He made a motion as if to reach for Tony’s hand but restrained himself. Tony glared. “I know I’ve been babying ever since you got injured, and you have every right to be frustrated with me. But I just don’t want you to get more hurt. I want you to take care of yourself. And you never do, because you never realize—” Steve paused and glanced at Tony, to see if anything was registering. But Tony had an unreadable look on his face like when he was purposefully being evasive. “Never mind.”
Dummy moved to hide under the work table, trying to fold his arm to fit. The two men watched silently as the robot accidentally shook the table. He stretched, his arm knocking around, and caused the table to up end, falling to its side and completely exposing the robot once more. He turned to look at the men, shuddered, and then raced out of the workshop.
Dummy hung his arm down, shaking still, looking down on the ground. Tony glanced up at the picture of Steve. It was one of Tony’s favorite pictures of him; after a particularly grueling battle the whole team had collapsed in the rec room. They popped in a cheesy 80s flick and ordered in Thai food. Thor had taken several photos that night on his prototype Stark phone and Tony later hacked into the phone to download the photo onto his servers. Steve had thrown his head back, laughing, blue eyes looking so bright and happy, his grin infectious.
Hours passed before Tony resurfaced with the need to relieve himself. After flushing the toilet, he looked around to see Butterfingers cleaning the game up by himself and You tidying up his charging station. Dummy was gone.
“No, I am being very serious. This is how serious I am.” Tony tried to school his face into looking stern. The whole effect failed when he started giggling.
“If you act like this every time you interact with the Captain, he’s going to be even more suspicious than he already is.”
Tony felt himself begin to float off, no longer concerned about needing to come, enjoying Steve’s solid weight pressing down all around him. Before he could truly relax, however, a wolf whistle broke him out of his reverie.
Tony wasn’t that bad. He had a tendency to forget Steve was in the room once he was deeply focused on his work, but Steve knew it wasn’t out of spite. When he did know Steve was in the room, they’d talk about anything that was on their mind. Steve would tell him about his work and how Bucky and Sam were both secretly assholes but that he put up with them anyway. That he’d always wanted to be an artist, but it didn’t pan out, and how much he missed his mom sometimes. In turn, Tony would tell him how he struggled between the company’s expectations of him and his desire to innovate; how much he missed his best friend Rhodey, who was currently serving in the Air Force; and how he was certain that he’d always be disappointing to his father, and that nothing he did will ever change that. It was surprising to Steve how intimate their conversations became, how much Tony seemed to trust him even though it was clear trust didn’t come easily to him.
Dummy waved at him with his arm. He was at the foot of the bed, seemingly directing Butterfingers and You. Butterfingers was carefully spreading rose petals over the picture and the bed while You was placing candles on the bedside table. They all looked disgustingly pleased with themselves.
“If you want. But I was thinking we should start with coffee.” He retrieved a pack of Italian dark roast from the floor. “I tried Italian coffee once when I was stationed in Turin. Wonder if it’s changed much.”
He pumped himself, letting out a groan. The remote control fell out of his hand and landed beside him, and he used his now free left hand to grasp the base of the plug. He angled it towards his prostate and breathed out quickly, the grip around his cock tightening. From there he could reach his end. He rubbed his thumb and forefinger around the head and gasped, curling in on himself. Streaks of white painted his belly. He collapsed back against the duvet.
Thor leaped towards the tanks, lifting Mjolnir and striking it down on the nearest tank, while lightning rained down. The tank was out of commission and the others soon followed.
“Ah.” Well that certainly was easier to fathom than a robot being in love with him. “How did he manage to move this all here?”
Twenty minutes in Tony walked in, fashionably late as always. Ignoring curious glances, he grabbed one takeout box and a set of chopsticks and sat on the sofa next to Steve. And of course he had trouble getting the chopsticks open. He threw the utensils on the table before grabbing a fork. And despite having four fingers on his right hand not bound by the cast he still had trouble gripping the fork.
“Yes.” And Steve leaned down to give him a sweet kiss. Then he took his hands and placed a kiss on each palm. “I did.”
Steve blushed, remembering at last moment that he’d forgotten to put on a shirt. He said, “Do you have any idea what time it is?”
Tony hummed in approval and snuggled closer, feeling his heavy eyes slip close. But before he could drift off, he murmured into the silence, “For the record, I was never that obnoxious.”
“I heard it once. After a mission, you went to your penthouse and collapsed on the couch. I went to check up on you and you kept jerking in your sleep. I have them too.” He grinned self-consciously. “Kind of hard to go through a world war without them.”
The music died out suddenly and a door slammed open, an agitated Tony appearing. His focus zeroed in on Steve. “Listen, Ste—” He cut himself off and stared at the box on the counter. “Are those doughnuts?” he asked slightly incredulously.
“You sure you don't want any help?” Steve asked, tilting his head. It was rather adorable -- no, bad Stark, you're supposed to be getting away. “You did seem to like our help last time.”
That shouldn’t have been so arousing but Tony never did care for convention. He moaned around the length and reached a hand down to his clothed erection, pressing the heel of his hand against the head. He licked along the shaft as it pumped in and out and managed to relax his gag reflex in time for Steve to shove himself down his throat.
“Steve,” Tony whined, desperate to get Steve to fuck him too. Steve pretended not to hear him, too wrapped up in sucking at Clint’s bottom lip.
The pictures scattered on the floor, but Dummy went back to his task of cleaning it all up with no complaint. He hesitated on one photo of Steve, shirtless and sweaty, but grinning from exercise endorphins.
Natasha hummed in approval, tilting his head to kiss him again. She scratched her nails into his scalp and he preened.
“You cheeky little—” Tony grinned when Steve laughed. Steve rested his head on Tony’s shoulder, giving him a satisfied smile. “I love you.”
Tony licked his lips at that thought, glancing back up at Steve to make sure this was really happening and not just an ill-conceived game of gay chicken. Steve didn’t flush away from his state, only waiting patiently for Tony to get on with it.
“I like you,” Steve said somewhat helplessly. “I’ve liked you for a while now. As in, I want to take you out to dinner. As a date.”
He grabbed an armful of different coffee bags and was about to flee back into the elevator when the exit was being blocked by a large blonde man.
Dummy lowered his camera and set it on the table before moving over to Steve’s corner, looking down at the forgotten art supplies.
When Tony left medical the splints were turned into casts and his scowls were deeper than ever. Clint mocked him ruthlessly until Tony threatened to sic the Hulk on him the next time Bruce turned.
When Steve started hanging out in the workshop, the drawings’ subject changed again. To the Iron Man suit, to the bots beeping around the place, and at last to Tony. Tony while concentrating, Tony while soldering metal, Tony while making schematics. Tony’s eyes, his lips, his hair, his biceps, his hands. Steve was a complete goner.
Tony surely hadn’t sent all of those files to the hacker and tell them what to do with them when they were decrypted. That wasn’t sarcasm, by the way, he genuinely didn’t do it. Maria Hill did. She didn’t want another project paperclip and could see that Cap wanted to let her onto the team and had taken matters into her own hands.
While he was sure they would be alone for a while Tony brought Steve down and opened up some descriptions of different LGBT+ labels and told Steve that when he researched these in-depth he’d find this description on Bigender he will feel it resonate with him. He will feel like it describes him perfectly. It is absolutely okay to call his asshole his pussy. If he considered it his pussy then, of course, it was his pussy. It was perfectly fine that he’d always been jealous of the girls in his class as they grew up and their chests grew into beautiful breasts, boobs, titties and his stayed flat and boring. He had nice breasts now. They were still a little smaller than he’d like but they weren’t flat and oh, he couldn’t wait to see what they’d look like in pretty bras and things! And yes, he absolutely could wear makeup and jewellery and grow out his hair. Lots of men these days had long hair anyway, there was nothing wrong with it. And if he wanted everyone to call him Stevie instead of Steve then that was fine too. All of these feelings were completely normal. He’d felt this way his whole life. This was his natural state. Tony spent nearly two hours reinforcing this absolute truth into Stevie. He was bigender. He was mostly a man and prefered male pronouns, but he had a pussy, and breasts and wanted to wear makeup and jewellery and grow out his hair. He was a predominantly male bigender person and that was completely fine.
Deeper in the trance and Tony could add compulsions. Steve would feel compelled to obey, but again, if his nature was too strongly against it, he would fight the compulsion and could get rid of it completely.
He found Tony's hands on his own to be very relaxing and always relaxed when Tony stroked the back of his hand with his thumb.
Stupid rich people and all their stupid unnecessary stuff. Why did you need bowels this tiny? It’s too small for a cup but too big for an egg cup.
It was like as soon as he’d calmed down and wasn’t angry anymore, suddenly he realised that he hadn’t been acting like himself and he was being way too cruel to Tony for no reason and it was all that witch’s fault! The other’s seemed horrified that they might have been doing the same. Tony grinned as they began to discuss their behaviour over the last three weeks and realised that they were in the wrong. They know Tony wasn’t to blame. It wasn’t his fault so why were they being so mean and cruel?
Sam took a deep breath and sighed heavily, eventually pulling his hands out of Tony’s grasp and he stood up. “Whatever, man.” He left the room but Tony knew he’d be back. It might take longer than Steve did since the compulsion wasn’t as strong, but he’d be back and Tony would continue to work him. He’d build up that trust until the man trusted him as much as he trusts Steve.
Not Tony’s fault a hacker from Italy had sent the UN all of Wanda’s files, including files proving that she and her brother had volunteered for Hydra when they were 18, that Novi Grad was basically a Hydra city, as all the residents knew who they were but ignored them as Hydra protected them from Sokovia’s civil war, as their city was right in the middle of the country and was in the most danger. They were given numerous videos of Maximoff torturing people as she learned how to control her powers.
Steve laughed nervously and held the cloth over his eyes, cooling the heated skin. “No, no. No drugs. It’s just… ah… this is kind of embarrassing and personal, but… I’d realised I hadn’t really explored much of what this century can offer me… on a personal level, you know? Like food, great, movies, great, music, you guys sing a lot about butts now, what’s up with that? And take away and other stuff. I know about all that. But I hadn’t really explored…” he paused trying to find the right words.
Sure enough, Stevie was unable to stay away for long when he had an appointment and showed back up a little while later. Tony was now freshly showered and wearing a t-shirt now that he’d finished with all the hottest work.
“Nah, we’re going to the tower. We can have a nice romantic meal there without worrying about the paparazzi or photographers. We can relax and have fun. Just the two of us. And a two-minute flight there and the same back is better than a long drive, plus Friday can pilot the jet, so I don’t have to worry about how much I drink. Not that I plan to get drunk, but I can be over the legal limit and still be sober. You know, previous history with alcohol abuse and all.” Tony was quick to reassure Stevie about his drinking at the other’s concerned frown.
Tony eventually brought Stevie up, allowing him to remember the last part of their conversation. He turned the music off and watched as the blond puddle of bliss on his couch slowly blinked the sleep from his eyes. “Hey there Sleepyhead. Back with me?”
Steve finally managed to get enough control of himself to take off his new favourite outfit and fold it neatly. He decided to try on the rest later and dressed in normal clothes and shuffled off to the kitchen.
Steve nodded. “Yeah. I didn’t think it was normal so I just…” he shrugged one shoulder, still keeping his hand in Tony’s, “Ignored it, I guess. If I pretend that I’m normal, maybe I’ll be normal.”
He sobbed heavily, tears running unchecked down his cheeks. God, he wasn’t supposed to feel like this. What kind of man wore women’s lingerie? What kind of man got hard just from feeling lace? What kind of man called his ass a pussy? Or his chest his breasts? He let himself fall back on the bed. He was so confused. He knows it’s not right. He’d been trying to convince himself that all his life. Just stop being weird and be a man! But then he remembered something SHIELD had told him when he’d first woken up… a bunch of letters he couldn’t remember but it was something to do with gay people and how there was more than one gender now?
“From now on, every day when we are both in the compound at lunchtime, after you have your lunch, you are going to make me a cheese sandwich. You will cut it twice downwards into three slices, and then twice across, making nine little squares. They are small enough that I can pick them up one-handed and eat them easily without stopping my work. You will put some blueberries in the little fruit bowels in the cupboard that Clint was ranting about this morning.”
“Mmm Yes! So good! Tony! So Good!” Steve came violently in the panties, much to Tony’s delight. When he’d come down Tony got Steve to feel the back, where there was a hole in the fabric right over his hole.
Tony could see how upset Steve was getting so he gently rescued the poor washcloth from the man’s hands, capturing one of them in one of his and rubbing his thumb across the back. Steve instantly began to relax and smiled gently at Tony.
Tony sat next to him on the couch and allowed the other to lean against him, resting a head on his shoulder, while he replied to some emails on his phone.
Tony sat back on the coffee table in front of Steve and took the man’s hands into his own. This was now the fifth session, and Tony was ready to add the new commands to Steve’s mind. It took less than a minute to get Steve fully down into the trance so Tony could place the compulsions. Today, Tony added a new command. “You find me a very attractive person, Stevie. I am very handsome and sexy. I am very attractive and you notice that. You know I am very attractive.”
“So… when I was in school, I used to look at all the girls and how their chests were getting bigger, some of them with pretty nice breasts and I kept wondering why mine wasn’t growing. I’d asked my mum and she just laughed and told me boys don’t have breasts.”
Tony gently placed his hands on Steve’s shoulders and began rubbing and massaging them. “It is good, isn’t it? Relax. Everything is alright. You have nothing to worry about.” Steve was now leaning heavily into him, eyes drooping, arms dropping down slightly and gaze still stuck on the screen. “Just relax. Your mind is calm. All of your worries are floating away.” Steve was putty in his hands. “Five, your body is feeling heavy and relaxed. Four, your eyes are getting heavy, you’re so relaxed and calm. Three, your heart is slowing, slowing down, into a slow steady rhythm of sleep. Two, your mind is floating in a sea of calm and relaxation. All your thoughts are floating away. One, your eyes are closing, your body is dropping into a deep sleep. Zero. You are totally relaxed and calm. This is the most relaxed you have ever felt. You feel so good.”
“You will have dreams about me in a tank top and jeans in the lab, flirting with you and you flirting back. In your dream, I will grab your hair and pull you down into a kiss and you will wake up with your cock hard.”
“When you wake up, you will remember how calm and relaxed and good you felt but you will remember none of this, you will still believe the words I’ve told you. These memories only exist in the trance. When you wake up you will remember that you believed the results of the investigation as soon as you heard them. You knew I could not be responsible for Ultron. You have only been agreeing with the other’s out loud. Inside you believe I am not to blame. From now on you will avoid mentioning Ultron at all. You know it upsets Clint.”
Worked in his favour because now he could simply lie here with his cock still inside his lover’s tight hot pussy and cuddle instead of having to pull out so Stevie could take his gross, wet panties off.
Tony almost rolled his eyes at how casual Steve was trying to sound and failing. “New design for a communicator that can’t be hacked and is immune to an EMP.” He gestured to the screen in front of him, ignoring Steve picking up the tablet he’d left on that table over there, right where Steve would see it and be curious. He watched from the corner of his eye as Steve turned on the screen and looked at the swirling colours, twirling into a spiral and pulling him down.
Tony just grinned. “Sure thing, Stevie. Anything you need. We love you just the way you are. Right guys?” He looked over at the others and they were all nodding.
Stevie nodded. “Yeah. Sounds so good.” He bucked his hips again, fucking himself on Tony, who was holding still and just watching.
Finally, Tony had Steve get dressed again and sit back on the couch. He made sure Steve was hard and when he woke up and he would not notice the smell of sex in the room. He blushed heavily at realising how hard his cock was but Tony simply smiled gently and told him it was fine, these things happened sometimes, especially when you were relaxed. Besides, he was half-hard when he’d woken up last time too.
And one special, specific piece that Tony himself had designed and fabricated just especially for Stevie.
“You are coming up, out of the darkness. You can feel your body more. You are still so relaxed but you are more awake now. Your body is still so heavy but you can now open your eyes.”
“My voice makes you feel so good. You trust my voice. I would never lie to you. I speak only the truth. Every word I speak is true.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair and bit his bottom lip, glancing to the side as if indecisive about something. He internally smirked at the sight of Stevie’s blush deepening. “I was wondering… if you wanted to go out sometime. You and me.”
Steve froze and read the short article several times before typing bigender into a search engine and reading the same description written in several different ways with more or less information that was on the first sight he read.
Steve eventually managed to pull the panties off and clean himself up, as well as the sizable puddle on the floor. He took a few minutes to refuel, grabbing some energy bars and sports drinks from the little fridge in his room, before going back to the lingerie. Some of them he looked at himself, twisting this way and that before deciding it wasn’t really his thing. All of the lace was immediately shoved into the back of the drawer with a deep blush. Eventually, he came to Tony’s favourite piece.
, all the hatred Barton had been feeling switched targets and all Tony had to do was sit back was watch as Barton stormed upstairs to where the rest of the team was watching a movie and he interrupted them with a furious rant.
“I speak only the truth, Stevie. Every word I say is true. I make you feel good. I would never lie to you.”
After a good fuck, he’d put the vibrator back into Stevie’s pussy and send his beautiful, lingerie covered ass upstairs to get started on dinner, which he and Pepper ate with his cock in Stevie’s pussy and Stevie slowly pleasuring Pepper’s pussy around her plug.
Sam was frowning deeply. “Yeah, man. No problem. It’s gonna take a bit of getting used to though, remembering your new name, but yeah. Kind of a surprise. You’ve never said anything before.”
Steve keened but did as the was told, bucking his hips into his hand a few times as he tucked himself away. This design had extra room at the front compared to the ladies cut but Tony had this set made up special so there was even more room to accommodate Steve’s impressive cock. Tony’s mouth watered at the sight and he had to take a few minutes to get himself back under control.
Tony ran his hand across Stevie’s pretty little breasts, lightly teasing the nipples and making it seem like an accident, what with him being plastered to Stevie’s massive back. He couldn’t see Stevie’s chest, so he didn’t know when he was grazing just close enough to the nipple to excite but far enough away that he technically speaking wasn’t touching them.
Steve moaned quietly. And nodded sleepily. Tony kept that up for a full five minutes, marked by the clock on the wall behind the couch. Just repeating over and over that Steve felt calm and relaxed whenever Tony touched his hands.
Tony smiled gently and gestured to the couch, signalling Friday to blackout and lockdown the workshop. When Stevie was sat comfortably on the couch, Tony tapped the speaker on the small table next to the couch. A deep, low thrumming sound began playing. He’d introduced the music a few days ago and sure enough, with the first swipe of his thumbs against Stevie’s hand, he slipped straight into a light trance, falling further with every pass until he was completely under and Tony could begin reinforcing all of his commands. It now took almost an hour to reinforce everything, but it was worth it. Soon he wouldn’t need to reinforce some of them, as they’d be so deeply ingrained in Stevie’s mind that they would become a natural part of his being.
Tony repeated the process with every pair of underwear he had in the box, specifically fitted to match Steve’s frame. Everything from panties, to stockings, garters, a corset and a bustier, a negligee, a nighty, matching pairs of bras and panties. Any different type of lingerie Tony wanted to see Steve in. Some of them didn’t suit him so Tony told him so, but most of it looked great. He made sure Steve got aroused by lace and had at least two orgasms in each one. The silk and satin felt sexy and smooth but didn’t turn him on quite so much. Tony had great plans for leather but that wouldn’t come for a while yet. Steve had a lot of training to do before then.
Sam was the first to ask. Later that same day and had come down. He went down just as easily as Steve had and Tony was able to work on one of the man’s issues as well as Ultron. Sam now believed in him, and the results of the investigation, but like Steve was wary of setting Clint off. It was worse since the archer blamed Tony for Wanda being denied entry into the states and a place on the team.
Their third was their attempt at baking a cake together. Tony didn’t help at all and instead got covered in flour while Steve did all the work. Steve slapped him in the ass as punishment. Tony didn’t look much chastised.
“Why would I be angry? I mean, I admit I was surprised—okay, very surprised,” he amended when he saw the skeptical look on Tony’s face. “When I came up here, I thought you were hurt.”
“No, sir, Dummy is incapable of being in love. He is a robot, as you know. But he has come to appreciate Steve’s presence in the workshop.”
Clint groaned and stilled, pressing his face into the nape of Tony’s neck. After a long moment, he turned to kiss Tony’s cheek before withdrawing from Tony’s tight heat.
Without a word, Steve lifted Tony up and off his feet. Tony yelped and wrapped his legs around his middle. “Warn someone first!”
“Uh-uh,” Bruce interjected, walking over to stand next to Steve. “You’ll still be flexing your wrist if you pilot the suit.”
After roughly 16 hours, Tony surfaced from his work, took a look around and said, “Where’s my coffee?”
Steve’s answer was to rub slowly over the head of Tony’s clothed erection. He grinned when he saw Tony’s eyes flutter, rocking his hips up to meet Steve’s hand. Steve moved so that his mouth was right by Tony’s ear. “So how do you want this?” he whispered.
Steve leapt, automatically reaching to his side for his shield, which was thankfully at the other side of the room and not actually by his side or the robot would’ve been in real trouble. Dummy let out a distressed beep and moved quickly towards the door, shaking visibly.
Tony’s hands lost their swelling and recovered to the point that the casts got switched out for splints. And whenever they were lounging together, watching TV, or sitting next to each other eating, Steve would take one or both of Tony’s hands into his lap. He would kiss them, feel along their sides, caress those four naked fingers, or simply hold them. Tony never complained, but he always got this sort of dazed look, as if he couldn’t comprehend why Steve acted so enamored.
Steve stared flabbergasted for a moment before JARVIS translated. “He wants to know why you make art.”
Tony worked for another 20 minutes uninterrupted before Dummy shoved his arm into Tony’s side. He jumped, soldering iron falling out of his grip and nearly burning him before JARVIS turned it off.
The robot was silent a long time before the moment was ruined by Tony yelling at him to get him a screwdriver.
“So impatient.” Steve led his cock in gradually, moving in increments, and paused, glancing down to see Tony writhing. “So needy for it.”
“I asked JARVIS where you were and he was acting weird. I know now it was because of this.” Steve gestured at the room.
“It’s just open reduction,” Bruce tried to assure him. “They’re repositioning the bones so they’ll heal better. That’s all.”
He ended up moving the flowers to the kitchen, resolving to give one to Natasha and the other to Pepper, and let the balloons float in a closet.
Steve’s free hand reached the plug and dragged it out slowly, twisting to make the plug rub even more deeply into him. Once he pulled it free, he barely gave Tony a moment to prepare himself before he thrust into him in one smooth motion, bottoming out. Tony gasped and collapsed into his forearms, struggling to carry his weight.
“Of course you will. And when you do, I’ll tell you all about what I think about these hands.” Steve ducked his head to press a kiss to each of the four visible fingertips. Tony gaped at him. “Come on, time for bed.”
But before he could feel the disappointing emptiness, Steve pushed the butt plug back into him. “There you go,” he murmured before sucking at his neck.
“You’ll live.” Nat patted his cheek and Tony flinched away from her. “C’mon, Clint, those Lost reruns are on tonight. Thor, you have anything you’d like to say?”
Steve kissed him partially to quiet him. He took his fingers out and coated himself with more slick. He wound one arm under Tony’s thigh to keep him spread open, and pressed the head of his dick against the entrance. Tony exhaled carefully and Steve pushed inside.
Dummy let out a soft, disappointed beep and Steve tried to smile encouragingly at him. He returned to his drawing, a rough sketch of Tony playing with the blue light, his long fingers twisting like a magician’s. In fact, if one would look into his sketchbook, starting at the beginning, they would see the natural progression of Steve acclimatizing to the future. First were the sketches of the Howling Commandos and Peggy, beautiful Peggy, before the subjects turned into the Avengers, lounging in the common room, at a dining room table for family dinners, their bodies in action during sparring.
When they pulled apart to breathe, Tony said, “I want you to fuck me. Like right now.” He nipped at Steve’s full bottom lip.
Steve growled and, damn, that should not have been as hot as it was. He was rocking inside Tony, nowhere near the pace Tony needed, but it was better than the complete stillness of before. Tony gasped and shuddered, but still kept his gaze down, refusing to meet Natasha’s eyes.
Their first date went well. So did their second. And third, and fourth. When they had their first date, Steve took Tony to a small burger place he frequented often, where he knew the owners and patrons won’t pay much mind to the two Avengers. Besides knowing cheeseburgers to be Tony’s favorite food, Steve figured it would be an easy food for Tony to hold with his injured hands. Tony seemed to almost forget about his hands; he was too busy telling Steve lame chemistry jokes to remember.
Steve shifted, pulling Tony’s legs further up on his shoulders, and groaned at the new angle. “Touch yourself,” he commanded, and Tony listened without a snide remark this time. Steve kept the pace steady, long and deep strokes that rubbed against his prostrate every time.
. I don’t fawn over the great Captain America like everyone else. You can’t control me and that infuriates you.” Tony grinned at him, flashing his teeth in an unkind smile. “Now why don’t you go back to your sad, boring apartment?”
“He’s absolutely beautiful, Tasha,” Clint said, elbowing her playfully. “I can’t wait to watch you fuck him.”
Not for the first time since the incident a week ago, he wondered what the robot did with the video. Of him sleeping. He won’t lie, that was rather unsettling. He refused to ask JARVIS, concluding that it was better off not to know.
The silence only lasted about a minute and Tony started to mutter, telling Steve to hurry up, he’s done this before, he’s not some fragile thing.
His gentle voice brought Tony’s attention back to him. Tony was shaking, trying not to cry, trying not to look at Steve, but he couldn't help it now.
“You’re wearing too many clothes,” Steve said as he leaned away, working on his own clothing. Tony didn’t respond; he took his shirt off and threw it somewhere on the ground, and struggled with his jeans. Once Steve was fully divested of clothes, he grabbed the ends of Tony’s pant legs and pulled, nearly dragging Tony along with it.
Hulk grunted and a minute later stood Bruce, blinking at them blearily. “What happened?” he said, straightening up when he saw Tony.
Steve smiled at him. “Despite your flaw of waking people with rock music, I do like being with you.” Before Tony could protest that, Steve kissed him again. He placed his other hand at Tony’s waist, bringing him even closer, and deepened the kiss. Tony relaxed into it and his hands wandered over Steve’s back, pausing to grab Steve’s ass and pull his lower half closer.
“You didn't need to,” Tony retorted. “I'm perfectly fine on my own.” He tried not to feel guilty when he saw Steve’s face fall.
In the communal kitchen, he was surprised to find Tony awake. And not just lumbering towards the coffee machine like a zombie after an all-nighter, but actually awake as in he went to sleep the night before and woke up in the morning like a normal person. And currently he was looking at Steve like he was the devil.
Tony didn’t seem to register that he was speaking, instead blinking sleepily up at him. He made grabby hands at him when Steve pulled away, and Steve complied, lying down next to him. Tony curled up to him, giving him a quick, chaste kiss. He sighed, “We should do that more often.”
“Yes. Remember how he was recording you all the time, and then later you found him in your room at night. Recording you again. Without your consent.”
It was four in the morning and it looked like it was safe, but there were no such thing as being too careful when you lived with two professional spies.
Steve deflated. He had been waiting with bated breath all morning but it seemed Tony really did forget about their talk last night.
Tony tried to latch himself onto Steve again, but Steve pushed him back down on the bed, his eyes roaming over the bare flesh. The arc reactor was gone, leaving a mess of scar tissue behind. Steve’s hand pressed upward on Tony’s chest, reaching to his neck and curling around, pulling him up for another kiss.
Tony had stepped forward, his mouth only a few inches away, his pupils blown wide. He licked his lips. “Yes—”
Bruce winced but sat down beside them, grabbing hold of Tony’s left hand. Tony hissed again. “Definite damage to the wrist, probably broken but we won’t know for sure until we got x-rays.” He took the other hand from Steve. “Not as much damage to this one, but again, x-rays.”
Before Tony can mourn its loss, he jolted when he felt Clint’s fingers, slick with what was surely lube, slide into him easily. The fingers worked him even more open, preparing him for something bigger than the plug.
Steve laughed as he moved into the bedroom, dropping Tony in the center of the bed. Hovering above him, Steve could see how dilated his eyes were, his hair rumpled from Steve’s hand tugging at it. His neck was tilted back, baring his throat, and Steve could see his breathing was quickening.
Steve pressed both hands to his temple and rubbed his fingers into his eyes. “Okay, I believe you.” Tony visibly relaxed and so did Dummy. “But what I want to know is why Dummy thought you would get the most use out of… this.”
The slick sounds of skin-on-skin filled the room but Steve barely registered it, his attention focused solely on Tony, who was gripping the sheets tightly, face screwed up in pleasure. He kept letting all sorts of breathless noises, trying to match Steve’s pace and failing, instead letting go to enjoy the ride. He was beautiful like this, trusting Steve to take care of him, and Steve felt honored by that trust.
Tony snorted. “I don’t disobey you for funsies, Cap. I just find better, quicker ways of ending a mission.”
The scene changed and this one was of Steve drawing in the workshop. “Don’t move,” he said. “I’m drawing you. Never really drew robots before, mostly do landscapes and people.” Instead of focusing on the sketchbook, the camera zoomed in on Steve’s smile.
“Beautiful,” Steve whispered. He held Tony’s head back up and kissed him, his tongue slipping in. Tony wanted more from Steve; he couldn't understand why he resisted for so long.
Steve was aware that he was staring. Truth be told, he was always staring when he was down in the workshop, but Tony was so engrossed in his suit repairs that he never noticed. Right now, in the middle of the room, blue light was forming a visual of the suit and Tony was rotating the display with his hands, almost reverently. But Steve’s attention was not on the marvel of modern technology.
“You were perfect, Tony. I loved it.” Tony smiled. The enticement of sleep was pulling him under, but he had one last thought to voice.
“I know what I’m doing.” Steve pressed in more firmly, twisting his finger. Absently he took Tony’s dick in his other hand and felt Tony squirm against his grip.
“Oh please. The reason why you’re upset and storming in my room when I have a party to attend is that I don’t listen to
“Captain, if I may insist, there is nothing wrong with allowing yourself to indulge. Especially after Dummy’s inexcusable—”
Tony nodded. “It is good. Cheese isn’t messy like jam, jelly or peanut butter, so I won’t make a mess. And cheese has lots of calcium and protein so it’s healthy too. And unlike meats, it won’t matter if it gets warm. I love cheese.”
Tony laughed sweetly, “You almost fell asleep on me. I was showing you my latest studies in relaxation and how it can aid PTSD and I guess it works. How do you feel?”
Rhodey grinned. “I love that one of the black guys is only Cisgender Heterosexual on a team that contains Captain America.”
Right on cue, Steve appeared at the door and entered his access code, the door sliding open and admitting him entrance. This was something they had all insisted on, that Tony couldn’t lock any of them out. Tony had wiggled them down to still being able to lock the door if one of them was in the lab with him.
. Tony was shocked but made use of this gift. If Barton was hypersensitive to hypnosis than all the better for him. After the Ultron mess was dealt with, Tony now knew all of his team didn’t blame him for Ultron. With Thor still off-world and Bruce who knows where Tony couldn’t do anything about them. Besides, he didn’t know if he even could hypnotise a god or the hulk.
Steve blushed heavily at the red and gold fabric in his hands and bit his lip as he slid it on. The cups across his breasts were designed to cup his boobs and pushed them up and further together while also providing extra padding, making his pretty little boobs look a lot bigger. There were straps across his belly that evolved into a garter belt across the smallest part of his waist, straps then carried on down making his hips look wider and dropping down to meet the red and gold stockings at his mid-thigh.
He stuttered an apology and ran from the room. Tony grinned and sat at his desk, opening the live feed of Stevie’s bedroom. Sure enough, the man hurried in and slammed the door behind him and stood in shock for a moment, staring down at his rebellious dick which was happily standing up and doing its best to soak through his briefs. Stevie stood still for a few minutes with his eyes closed and slowly his erection faded. He then went to his bathroom and had what Tony can only assume is a cold shower.
“Good Stevie. Very good. You feel so good right now. My voice made you feel that good. So do my hands. Feel my hands on yours, Stevie. They are so calming and relaxing. Whenever I touch your hands with mine it will calm and relax you. This is soothing and calming. You feel more relaxed the longer I touch you.”
Stevie huffed. “Seriously? I have your cock in my pussy and you’re asking me if I want to get a toy?”
Tony smiled gently. “Easy. It’s not what you think. I’m not making you stop grieving for him, or not caring about him anymore. All I’ve done is make it so that grief isn’t quite so loud and all-consuming anymore. It’s quieter and all the good times are brought to the front, make it easier. Give it a few months and thinking about him won’t make you feel like you’ve been stabbed in the heart. You’ll always miss him. You cared about him so much. But he wouldn’t want you wasting away your life and forgetting all the good times you two had.”
Eventually, Steve’s parcel arrived, thankfully in a discreet box and Steve collected it himself from the postman to make sure it didn’t get screened by the post team and hurried back to his room. Tony watched on the security feed in his lab, the locks finally back under his full control and he leant back in his chair, leisurely stroking his cock as he watched Steve try on the different items.
Several hours later they were lying in Tony's bed. Tony was completely naked but Stevie had chosen to wear a pair of silk panties with a hole over his pussy, so Tony had taken great delight in fucking him with them still on. Stevie’s cockhead was currently just poking out the top of the waistband where Tony had pulled it out so when Stevie came, he didn’t fill his panties with his load.
“As you fall into further relaxation all thoughts float out of your head, all that exists is my voice. My voice brings you pleasure, bringing you down, down into this calm and relaxed feeling. You will listen only to voice; my words are the only thing that matter as they bring you deep calm.”
After their shower, Tony would check Stevie’s vibrator and add more lube before going down to the lab. Stevie would change the sheets, put the dirty ones in to wash and do a couple of chores around the house. Different days had different chores. He’d make himself some food with the disgusting high-everything mix that Tony had developed for him so he only had to eat four meals a day. Then he’d make Tony lunch and bring it down, spending the whole afternoon warming Tony's cock.
Tony sighed heavily and tucked himself away, well. He wasn’t expecting Steve to break down like that. Completely ruined the mood. But judging from the grin on the man’s face, the sparkle in his eye and the bounce in his step, he’d taken to the conditioning perfectly. Tony cleaned himself up from the come he’d spilt already, put a tank top on and grabbed up his empty coffee mugs. Time for a refill.
Natasha was next, following Tony down after breakfast. It took Tony nearly four times as long to get her down so he spent half an hour reinforcing her, keeping her down and making her relaxed and calm and pliant. Making sure she would go down easier the next time. He spent an hour on her hands, to the point where he was sure if he’d done that to Steve the man would instantly fall into the deepest trance as soon as Tony touched him. For Natasha, naturally untrusting, it would only mean it took less than ten minutes to get her down.
He grinned as Steve pulled a pair of lace panties on, only for his knees to buckle as his cock rapidly swelled. Steve tipped his head back against the edge of his bed and frantically began humping his hand spread flat against his groin. It took only a few brief moments before he cried out in pleasure, his back arching as he shot wave after wave of come into his brand-new panties.
Every morning he would slip out of bed and go to the kitchen to start breakfast. Pepper would wake Tony with a nice slow blowjob. Tony would go to the kitchen while Pepper got ready for her day at the office and Tony would eat Breakfast with Stevie’s mouth warming his cock. After a lingering goodbye kiss that made Pepper’s pussy leak around the red and gold silicone plug inside of her, she left for the office.
By the time he’d finished speaking he was sat up straight, shoulders back proudly as he finally said out loud who he was.
Tony sat on the couch and lay Stevie down with his head pillowed on Tony’s lap. He fondled Stevie’s dick through his pants for a moment, not enough to get him hard, but enough that he wasn’t completely soft. Then he woke Stevie up, running a hand through his hair. Steve woke up and blushed at their position on the couch, blushing harder when he realised that he was aroused and almost half hard.
Steve came back again four days later and Tony brought him down much faster that time. Each time they did this Steve would respond more and more to Tony until eventually, Tony could get him down with something as simple and a single command word, clapping his hands twice or something like that.
Tony didn't stop looking at him as Steve neared and when the guy noticed Tony's attention was no longer on him, he looked up annoyed. When he saw Steve, however, his eyes widened and he stepped away from Tony. Tony, who didn't even notice, still staring at Steve as intently as he would study a particularly bothersome equation he wanted to bend to his will.
“Yes,” Tony didn't even hesitate. “But you were already mad at me and I didn't want to make it worse,” he confessed. He didn't mean to, it just sort of happened. Tony will forever be convinced that Cap has some sort of power that makes people confess their deepest, darkest secrets to him just because he gave them his kicked-puppy-dog look.
There was a blur on the horizon he thought was a plane, until it was close enough for him to realize it was not. A monochrome picture with a bright red spark in it, and Steve's fingers moved on its own accord, wanting to capture the image but without paint, without canvas, they just moved, in the air, suspended with no purpose.
Stark was smiling again, and Steve couldn’t help but stare. “When you’ve been in the public eye from the young age you learn to manipulate the press to your advantage.”
as well. He made a small arts place and spend most of his time there drawing or finger painting or making collages with other kids. It was adorable how determined they were. A lot of them after finishing their art went to Tony to show him what they did. He looked at all the pieces like they were the most beautiful masterpieces he had ever seen, and told them they better all became artists so that he could buy all their drawings himself one day.
“Night, Steve,” Tony said, or tried to. But it didn’t matter because he will be saying it for many more years to come.
“I know you will,” Steve said. He turned to look at Tony properly. “But you know this means you’ll have to join the organization now. You have no choice.”
He also didn’t like that he will have to stand in front of Tony, wear a cowl, and pretend to be someone Tony didn’t know.
If given a choice to go back, there is not a single thing you would have done differently, not a single step you would have changed.
If he had, what would have happened? Would Tony have returned those feelings? Would they try to make it work, somehow, against all odds? Would Steve have Tony by his side all those years instead of having to look from afar, full of regrets?
By the time they all found themselves at a debriefing, Tony was still in a bad mood (and wasn't that an understatement). Steve wasn't helping his case by glancing over at Tony every now and then, wearing that worried expression (and Tony learned to differentiate between his worried and his disapproving face. It was a slight difference when it came to Tony, but it was there).
But this time, the answer wasn’t no. “Actually, that’s what I wanted to talk to you about,” he said as casually as possible. She didn’t seem fazed for a moment, until his words sank in, and she turned to look at him abruptly. She opened her mouth to comment, but the line before her cleared up and he nudged her toward the cashier, “It’s your turn.”
Steve Rogers didn’t have a purpose. He had lazy days of wondering through the city every once in a while and that was enough for him.
Right before he fell into the darkness once again (but this one much nicer, with dreams of Steve waiting for him) he felt Steve kissing his forehead. “Good night, Tony.”
Everything ended up being a trap, bad guys storming the place (and Tony couldn't even tell you who they were, they were so unimpressive) and the team had to resort to a physical fight (despite Fury's insistence that this had to go down smoothly instead. But it's not like it was their fault!). And Tony having brought no suit (again at the insistence of Fury, ‘
“They didn't,” Natasha confirmed. “In fact, as far as I know, they had a really unhealthy relationship. Tony would do anything to impress Howard but even when it was obvious the kid was a genius, he never was good enough for his old man.”
They pulled away way too soon, but before Tony could complain, Steve pressed another light kiss to his lips before saying, “You should get some more sleep, Tony.”
It was only a few hours later, as he was nearing the base, having walked the entire way to clear his head, that he remembered, having replayed their conversation over and over again, that Tony had known he was from Brooklyn without Steve having told him so.
It was hard to turn around and start walking but Steve managed, turning only once to see Stark standing where he left him, staring at him, a thoughtful look on his face.
He took the knife out and dragged it across Steve’s cheek, not pressing down. “I am going to enjoy screwing up your face.”
Steve just hummed his agreement, drinking more. Once he was done, Tony took both their mugs and left them on the counter before holding Steve’s head with both his hands and bringing their mouths together.
“Tony,” Steve reached across the table and took Tony’s hand in his. He felt warm all over, from the touch and the trust that Tony was putting in him. “I won’t tell anyone, I promise.”
So Steve had to trust Tony, and focus on the punches flying toward him. The guy was fast, but so was Steve, their movements tough to follow for anyone but them. Steve thought he could get an upper hand, try to use his slightly bigger frame to overpower him, but the tattoo guy expected it, wanted it to happen. Despite trying not to, the fact was that Steve's mind was still on Tony, and it cost him. Trying to end the fight fast was not going in Steve's advantage.
Steve wished he had time to tell her how brilliant she was. But they had to keep moving. He would tell her later.
“Look at this,” Tony said, pointing to another message that showed up. “They found the mole. Or moles. Seems like SHIELD has a bit of a corruption problem.”
and really, Tony was kind of offended and was ready to tell him that but Doom was already leaving and
“Well I can’t help but be brilliant and good looking. People are bound to notice,” Stark joked. Steve felt like there was so much more to this story, so much more to Tony Stark himself. He was intrigued despite himself.
The Captain, however. The Captain would have that kind of information. He needed to be the one to tell him.
“Fine,” Tony said, because there was no time to overanalyze every tremor in Steve's voice. There was a pack of stupidbots (that was what Tony was calling them, deal with it) coming toward him and his suit was still down.
Tony, on the other hand, was left speechless, maybe for the first time since they met each other. He was staring at Steve like he was trying to discover the secrets of the universe hidden in his face.
Sam’s eyes widened in horror, while Steve chuckled, relived. “Guys, you don’t need to give him a shovel talk.”
The change in the atmosphere was almost tangible. When before their focus on the fight ahead was making them ignore the matter of their identities, now it all came flowing out, destructive and dangerous.
“I know that! But Tony, we're talking about aliens and robots and... And this isn't something you can protect yourself from with clever words or comebacks. If you're caught without your suit... You're dead Tony. And that isn't me saying you're not valuable without the suit, this is me saying you're too valuable. We need you. Iron Man
“I'm not talking about you taking the bomb Tony,” Steve said and Tony's eyes widened as he realized what Steve was implying.
“So, are you gonna open the door, or should we find out if your reinforced glass is stronger than vibranium?” Steve asked, a serious look on his face.
Steve looked up surprised. He was always aware of his surroundings, and he knew people were walking around him in the café, but how he managed to miss Tony Stark looking over his shoulder at his drawing, he wasn’t quite sure.
“Speak of the devil,” Natasha murmured, sitting down and typing something too fast for Steve to catch.
Steve didn’t know much about Hank Pym, having never met the man in person, but if the way Janet spoke about him was any indication, the man was brilliant if a little sporadic. But he was her husband so maybe she was a little biased.
“Steve?” Tony asked because somehow, through all the haze, that was one clear thing, one light in the tunnel of dark memories. One thing that, despite all odds,
Tony could only imagine what Steve and the rest of them were going through while Bruce was trying to bring him back to life. Judging by the tightness around Steve’s mouth it wasn’t a fast process either. The pain he could still feel around his chest told him that as well. He was probably dead for a while there. It was weird to think about that. It was worse imagining Steve’s reaction, especially after he tried to protect Tony so many times before. “I’m sorry. That couldn’t have been easy on you.”
Tony shook his head in amazement. “I thought that was you… trying modern slang or something. Being nice. I don’t know.” He wanted to throw his hands in the air but that would mean pulling his hand out of Steve’s grasp and he didn’t want to do that.
He found an empty room and broke a window to activate the alarm. It was only a few seconds later that the first guards came inside.
“I haven’t had the pleasure, no,” Tony said. “But who knows. Maybe one day I’ll have a chance to pick his brain a little.”
Steve was frozen to the spot, feeling like everything he thought he knew was wrong, and not really minding. “Wow,” he said. “I must admit, I’m pleasantly surprised. Forgive me for saying this, but you don’t seem this way in the press.”
“No, Tony. I don't want to hear any excuses. I had to leave my post to come here to protect you because you were in the middle of the battlefield,
More boxes. An entire back half of the room was also covered with them. Steve couldn’t look away from the black letters imprinted on them.
Since Tony was proved innocent, Steve finally let Natasha update Iron Man on what was going on. Steve himself wasn’t there when she called the man, but she told him later that he wasn’t happy they went behind his back. Steve couldn’t care less what he thought. He was always going to protect Tony first, and if that meant keeping Iron Man in the dark, so be it.
Unfortunately that was when Clint decided to speak up, “Natasha’s done. Wrap things up with Stark and meet us in the van.”
So Tony, as reckless as he was, crawled to the guy, avoiding all the shots and fighting around him and hoping Natasha and Steve were holding their own. Once he got a hold of the man's weapon Tony hesitated. The gun was standard issue, nothing special but that wasn't the problem. Tony knew how to use a gun, as well as any other weapon (he was manufacturing and creating them for a better part of his life, of course he knew how to use them) but there was a difference between shooting at a target in his lab and shooting at real people. Sure, he did it all the time with the suit, but his targeting system always made sure there were no lethal injuries and most of his weapons nowadays were non-lethal anyway (except for when he was fighting robots and the like, but those weren't
Steve cursed. Tony Stark. The epitome of rich, spoiled and entitled. He represented everything Steve hated and though they had no reason to suspect Stark Industries was dealing under the table, Steve didn’t cross Stark off his list. Everyone made mistakes, so if Stark was really making illegal profit, Steve was bound to find out about it sooner or later.
“What were you doing there?” she was looking at him intently, trying to figure him out. Steve wanted to tell her to let him know if she does, since he was unsure himself.
They continued eating, conversation drifting to more casual topics, until Tony asked, “So, army? How long were you there?”
He had to keep their attention on himself. Make them invested in the fight, cheering on their leader. With a crowd like this, he hoped it wouldn’t be so hard to do.
Tony sat down at the head of the table where everyone else was already seated (and if that put him furthest from both Fury and Steve that was just an added bonus... okay maybe that was the only bonus). “Okay. But that doesn't explain why I can't bring my suit?” said Tony, bringing the conversation to its original topic.
Not that that was what Tony did. Steve never saw any one person twice and he felt guilty about how glad that made him feel.
Pain was the first thing Tony registered as he slowly came to consciousness. There was pain in his chest, not unlike one he felt when he first woke up in Afghanistan. It seemed more dulled now though, as if this time someone had actually bothered to give him some painkillers.
No such luck. As soon as her name left his lips, Tony’s smile grew wider, in a way that showed fondness and affection. “Jan!” Tony exclaimed, bright and happy. “She’s a good friend of mine as well. How do you know her?”
Most of them were worried, naturally, but they knew there was nothing they could do about it. Natasha tried to have a conversation with him, but once she realized how invested Steve was, she let it go, telling him she only hoped it won’t all blow up in his face. Steve hoped so, too.
And the moment unfroze, and the rest of the world came crashing in, like cold water over overheated skin.
Steve laughed desperately, cried for a while and laughed again. Every time he repeated it, he felt some part of his self slot further into place. And suddenly it was like he was a little kid again and there was no difference between boys and girls and gender didn’t matter.
Yes. Tony couldn’t be happier with his life. His team had put him in charge and ever since then, their missions had been huge successes. No civilian casualties. No property damaged that wasn’t Hydra’s. He’d long since tracked the Winter Soldier to Bucharest but since the old fossil just wanted to be left alone Tony was happy to leave him be. They’d recently stopped Brock Rumlow from getting a hold of a biological weapon, having evacuated the nearby area as soon as the facility was breached and working with local law enforcement made sure Brock never made it out of the facility alive. Tony was currently working with the UN on some documents called the Accords which outlined what they could and couldn’t do. Tony had no doubt that if he hadn’t made the team trust him then they’d likely have done their usual thing and thrown a tantrum about not being allowed to do what they wanted. Tony was willing to let countries decline the Avenger’s access. Most of them had their own teams that could handle Hydra, and Tony handed over all the information he decrypted from their files over to the relevant countries anyway.
Tony was back in the penthouse apartment and dating Pepper again. All her problems with him being Iron Man were long since forgotten now. She loved him and she loved Iron Man. And she
Steve finally pulled his hands away and lay there panting. “Oh… that was… wow… guess I like lace… Mmmmm!”
Tony grinned. “Good Boy, Stevie.” Dreams were the easy way to see how Steve would take to this. If his dreams followed Tony’s suggestions, then he was open to this. He brought Steve up a little more. “Hey, Stevie. I have a suggestion for you. I need you to think about it and consider it.”
Steve lay there for a moment catching his breath before moaning again and grabbing at this cock around the lace, sliding the now soaked lace all over himself and worked himself up to another orgasm, not even noticing his other hand had gathered up some of his come and made its way between his legs until it pushed into his pussy and he cried out, bucking down into his hand as he began fucking his prostate and then bucking up into his other hand as it rubbed wet lace over his sensitive cock. Tony watched, coming once himself as Steve worked himself through one orgasm after another until his panties were dripping, his come leaking out the edges as well as through the fabric.
Tony pulled out and rolled Stevie onto his back, sat between his legs and slipped back in. “Yeah? You like the sound of that?”
Tony grinned. “Great. Tonight? I don’t wanna seem too forward but if you give me too much time to think about it I’ll end up panicking about it and overthink everything and flying us off to Paris or something to eat in the most expensive and romantic restaurant I can find.”
Tony rubbed firmly at Steve’s hands, causing the man to moan again and buck his hips. “You’ve been in this century for a long time now but you’ve never explored the different styles of underwear available now. Here is what I suggest. You should go online, on the tablet in your room, and look at different kinds of men’s underwear. You should buy some different styles and try them, to see how they feel. To see if there is anything you like. You’ll still wear the ones you have now when we’re on a mission, but you want to try some different styles for everyday wear. Just because Captain America wears plain boring briefs doesn’t mean that Stevie Rogers has to too.”
Then Sam spending more time with him talking about movies and music and getting to know him better. They found a few small areas where their interests crossed, but mostly they just worked on Sam’s wings together, as well as designing Redwing.
In the penthouse at Stark Tower, Friday greeted them like they hadn’t been in contact the entire time, but still. Her cheery “Welcome home, Boss” brought a smile to Tony's face. Tony and Stevie sat at the table that had been placed in the sitting room just for this purpose and enjoyed a lovely meal, watching the lights of the city slowly get brighter as the sky darkened. Tony was half glad you couldn’t see stars here and half disappointed, as it would have made the mood more romantic. During desert, Tony kept biting his lip and glancing shyly up at Stevie through his lashes. He felt his cock stirring as he watched Stevie’s pupils dilate slowly and a flush spread across his face.
Tony would wait while Stevie did the dishes and then they’d go to the shower together. Stevie would wash Tony down, and if he was in the mood, Tony would fuck Stevie’s face in the shower. The first time he’d done that the bigender blond had gone limp in Tony's hands, groaning in ecstasy as Tony used his face. He’d come completely untouched. Twice. Tony hadn’t made that happen. That’s just how Stevie was. He loved being face-fucked.
Steve nodded slowly, eyes scanning Tony’s face for something. He must find it because he nodded again. “Tony? I just wanted to say I’m sorry. For how the team and I have been treating you. I know Ultron wasn’t your fault and I shouldn’t just be letting the other’s rip into you about it. I know you’d never do anything like that if our roles were reversed. I know you didn’t make Ultron yourself and I know that investigation cleared you too. I’ll try and make things a bit easier for you from now on.”
Steve sighed heavily as he gave himself completely to Tony’s control. Tony lay Steve back against the sofa and sat on the table in front of him. He took the captains’ hands in his own and began massaging them, working them in his grip and feeling yet more tension bleed from Steve’s body.
Eventually Tony brought Stevie up enough that he could speak and asked the man one thing he didn’t like about Tony. This was quickly gotten rid of, just like the other problems. Tony's nicknames were affectionate, not insulting. He was not being mean or trying to bully or belittle Stevie. He always gave nicknames to the people he cared most about. Look at James Rhodes, now Rhodey, Honeybear, Platypus, Sourpatch and many others besides. Virginia Potts now only ever goes by Pepper, Tony's nickname becoming her new name.
At the deepest part of the trance, Tony could make Steve believe whatever he wanted. Anything Tony told him here was the truth this was the easiest place to control Steve from, but Tony didn’t want to remake who Steve was entirely, just… a few little modifications. So, for now, Tony only brought Steve down here at the beginning of the session. He first, reinforced that Steve felt so relaxed like this, only Tony could make him feel this calm and relaxed, and the longer he went without it the more stressed he felt until he came down to ask to do this again.
Tony made sure that the ‘card payment’ went through, though it was only empty pages. And the delivery was set for a week, as some of them were special order. Tony put the command through to the bots at his other facility to pack Steve’s order and ship it to arrive on the correct date. He then began designing the next page he would need, which was sex toys. From the security footage of Steve’s bathroom, a system only accessible in Tony’s lab, on a live feed, Steve had taken to Tony’s fantasy with relish and had taken the barely used bottle of lube from the drawer and used practically half the bottle fucking his pussy continuously the entire time, not even slowing his hand after he came, just still pumping his fingers in and out and ramming into his prostate until he finally collapsed to the ground and sat there for ten minutes before pushing himself up and washing off, face bright red but not seeing anything unusual about his sudden desire to have something inside of him like that.
Well, that was disappointing. Never mind. The next triggers will be put in place tonight and Stevie will be one step closer to being exactly where Tony wanted him.
After the fall of SHIELD, he’d hidden away because he was trying to protect the undercover SHIELD agents and was flying all over the globe extracting them and their families and getting them all to safety. Natasha felt guilty about putting them in danger. It wasn’t her intention. She just wanted to take down Hydra but their plan was terrible and put innocent lives in danger. She wasn’t thinking.
“Very good, Stevie. You are relaxed and calm. Being relaxed and calm makes you feel good.” Tony made a gesture and Friday locked the workshop door and blacked out the windows. If anyone asked, she would tell them that Captain Rogers and Dr Stark are engaged in something private and do not wish to be disturbed. “The better you feel, the deeper you’ll go and the deeper you go, the better you’ll feel. You want to feel even better than you do now. The deeper you go the better you’ll feel and the better you feel the deeper you’ll go.”
“You are going to look up the nutritional value of different types of food and find which ones have the highest nutritional value per 100 grams and you’re going to try and fit more of them into your diet unless you don’t like them. The super serum takes a lot of energy and you need to give it lots of fuel.”
Tony gently stroked Steve’s hands. “I know, Stevie. You have to eat so much food. But if you research nutritional values you can find what foods are better for you so your body gets what it needs with less food, so you won’t be hungry so much anymore.”
Natasha was also living in the penthouse with them, but only for a little bit longer. She was currently heavily pregnant with Tony and Pepper’s daughter. After the birth, she would stay at the tower, only long enough to provide them with milk to get them through the first two months and then she’d move back to the compound to continue her work with the Avenger’s support staff.
Tony and Pepper would then go and have enthusiastic sex while Stevie ate his food and cleaned the kitchen.
He spent twice as long reinforcing that he was not to blame for Ultron as he had with Steve and Sam. He then kept her down in a deep trance while she told him why she didn’t trust him.
When Natasha finally left his workshop, Tony was exhausted. She had so many issues it was hard to keep up with them all but Tony knew that given enough time, he’d have her exactly the way he wanted her.
Stevie loved it when Tony gave him a nickname. He got a little bit turned on whenever Tony called him Doll, Love, Sweetheart or anything on those lines. He loved it when Tony called him Capsicle. It was warm affection and light teasing. Tony just having fun. Stevie adored that nickname. Whenever Tony called him by it, he felt warmth and affection swell in his chest, and he felt happy.
Rhodey had his own floor in Tony's tower, which was back to being Stark Tower again, the avenger’s floors being mostly converted back to SI floors. He still worked mostly with the Air Force but planned to not sign a new contract when his current one ran out, getting an honourable discharge and moving on with his life. It was about time he had a life outside the military. He was working part-time at SI’s R&D working on planes and jets. He’d take a full-time job when he retired from the Air Force. He was interested in one of the women working security on his R&D floor. She was a nice woman. Didn’t seem interested in Rhodey for his fame or money so Tony was willing to see how it played out.
“Good afternoon, Sleepyhead.” Steve twisted his head up to look at Tony, sleepy-eyed and blushing cheeks. Thank god he was unable to notice Tony’s heated cheeks and straining erection. He’d already jerked off five times while programming Steve but he still reacted so strongly to seeing Stevie give himself over completely like that. Steve was never so compliant.
He fired up the forge and got to work. By the time Stevie came down later Tony was flushed and sweating, he had grease smeared across his forehead and his right shoulder and was breathing heavily. He grinned up at Stevie. “Hey, Stevie! Sorry. Just getting some work done.” He pulled off his welding mask and ran a hand through his hair, biting his lip and then turning and bending over to pick the mask up from where he’d dropped it. When he stood back up Stevie was staring, wide-eyed with an impressive tent in his slacks.
Steve nodded slowly. “Hey, would you be open to doing this for the rest of the team? Clint especially needs it I think.”
Steve sleepily opened his eyes and hummed at Tony who simply laughed again. He tried to stand up but his legs were jelly and weak and he flopped back down.
And even though Tony was CTO and Head of R&D at SI he still put so much work into the Avengers. He’d more than proven her assessment wrong. She wasn’t used to being wrong and that upset her but she would try to get to know the real Tony, rather than clinging to the Assessment and trying to believe that she could never be wrong. It was okay to make a mistake here. This was her family. They wouldn’t punish her for something like this.
Somehow, they had gone from being great friends, almost a family, to Tony being surrounded by spite and hatred. Well, he’d had enough. He wouldn’t let his little family be torn apart by something that wasn’t even his fault. Thankfully he had a plan.
He knew his drinking was bad before, after the invasion and then after SHIELD fell, but he was better now about it and was sure he wouldn’t fall back into old habits.
Steve nodded and Tony repeated it all five times, watching it sink in as Steve's mind accepted the truth in his words.
Steve spent that time stroking himself through the lace with one hand while rubbing at his hips and bum with the other.
“Yeah? How about one that vibrates? You ever used a vibrator before?” Stevie shook his head. “Oh, you’re going to love it. They feel so great. Especially right here.” He bucked his hips sharply, hitting Stevie’s prostate dead on.
Tony nodded. “Sure thing Cap.” He waited until the door had closed behind Steve and the man had disappeared into the elevator before he slowly pushed himself to his feet, he groaned and went cross-eyed for a moment, having to hold still for almost two minutes before he got himself back under control. He slowly, torturously, made his way into the lab bathroom and shoved his jeans down, grateful he’d decided against a belt today. He shoved the tight thong he was wearing down and his cock sprang free from where it had been held trapped between his cheeks. He squatted down and his balls popped back out of their tuck and he moaned, fisting his length and rubbing. It only took two strokes before he was coming hard into the condom that he’d put on in preparation for Steve coming down.
Late afternoon Tony would pin Stevie to his desk and fuck his tight little pussy. Stevie loved to be used and dominated so much. Tony was honestly shocked each time he took control and Stevie went limp beneath him, completely submitting to his will. He hadn’t made that happen, he'd planned to, but he hadn't gotten that far with the hypnosis. He was so shocked every time he realised that Stevie was genuinely into BDSM.
Tony grinned the entire time. He didn’t know if Stevie had become aroused while he was in the kitchen earlier. The man probably hadn’t even noticed he was wearing a tank top. No matter. He would be coming down later today for his appointment and Tony fully intended to make use of it.
Steve grinned beautifully and thanked him. They made idle chitchat for another hour before Tony had to get back to work and Steve went off to make a late afternoon snack as he’d missed his mid-afternoon snack.
Tony then brought Stevie up further and asked him about something that made him angry. He helped Stevie work through his issue with bullies. He hated bullies, but getting angry and starting a fight was not always the best way to deal with the issue. He helped guide Stevie through some other techniques he could use to deal with the problem and deal with his anger in the situation. Staying calm was the best thing. If he was calm, then the bully would look worse to anyone watching when they got angry and started trying to argue.
Eventually, Stevie woke up enough to gather the will to move and sat up straight, lifting his arms above his head in a lazy stretch. He always took so well to the relaxation of the trance that even after he woke up, it took him a long time to wake his body back up. He was just so warm and relaxed and he knew he was safe with Tony here and he enjoyed spending time with the manic engineer like this. His usually endless energy, quiet and still.
The grief wouldn’t go away but it would be overshadowed by the warm, happy feelings. It would affect him less and he could start to move past it.
Tony turned around and passed the cold wet cloth to Steve. “You’re not on drugs, are you? Is this you telling us that heroin works on you cus that would be bad.”
“Very good. Good boy Stevie.” Tony rubbed a little harder at Steve’s hands, really working the knots out. “Your body feels loose and relaxed. You feel so good, but it’s time to wake up now. You are rising out of the dark. I will count to five and when I click my fingers, you will wake up, ready?”
Steve hurried off to his room where he then proceeded to get himself off five times in the shower. Tony loved the super serum sometimes.
On the plus side, he gave Stevie a very sweet goodnight kiss, rubbing his thumbs across his hands the entire time so poor Stevie was putty in his hands, or against his lips as the case may be. He eventually backed away with a gentle smile and a goodnight, pushing Stevie into his room and closing the door before making his way to his own room.
Tony nodded. His cock was now throbbing painfully but he had to keep still. If he came now, he’d be sat with an oversensitive cock trapped in a condom full of cooling come. He did not want that. “Stevie, listen. I’m going to tell you something. Remember, I speak only the truth. You find me a very attractive person. You are attracted to me. Whenever you look at my butt for more than a passing glance you feel a spark of arousal. When you see me bite my lips you will feel a spark of arousal. When you see me run my hand through my hair you will feel a spark of arousal. When you see me in a tank top you will feel aroused. When you see me in a tank top and I am sweaty and flushed you will become hard.” Tony interspaced the commands with Steve’s calming triggers, repeating that he was telling the truth. He brought Steve up slightly and placed a strong compulsion. “Stevie. I’m going to tell you something great. I want you to consider it, alright Stevie?”
After soaking for ten minutes, feeling his fingers prune, Steve inclined his head towards the ceiling as JARVIS spoke again. “Captain, the coffee machine has finished brewing, ready for consumption. There are several cartons of eggs and packets of bacon for you to cook your breakfast. However, if you wish, I can easily order in from a five-star restaurant.”
Eight months ago Steve was leading a group of headstrong strangers into what felt like a suicide mission. Against aliens. Though he knew he shouldn’t be surprised; after all he fought against someone called the Red Skull who wield the Tesseract with abandon. He himself went from a 90-pound weakling to 240 pounds of pure muscle. Who also happened to sleep through 70 years. At this point nothing should be very surprising.
He bypassed the empty kitchen and living room, following the source of the music to one of the bedrooms. And there was Tony, sitting at a computer, surrounded by machinery, typing at the keyboard with one hand and turning over a circuit board with his other hand.
He was turned violently around and pushed against the wall, Cap looming above him, his eyes enraged. When Tony tried to escape, Steve held a hand easily against his shoulder, pressing him back. Tony squirmed but found he couldn’t escape.
Steve didn’t bother to build up to it. His thrusts were hard and fast and kept jerking Tony further into the counter. Tony opened his dazed eyes to see Clint watching them intently, his jaw slack. He was quiet for once, no lame jokes, only his entire attention focused on Tony, like he didn’t want to miss anything. Tony was breathing harshly, his thoughts scattered and difficult to solidify, but he found himself arching his back, silently preening under the attention.
If Dummy had the appropriate appendage, he’d probably stick his tongue out at the ceiling. JARVIS had control over the whole tower and, by extension, had his own programming linked to the robot, although he couldn’t control him. And so he knew just what Dummy would do if he could.
Steve didn’t spend much time on his floor, opting to hang around the communal floor, the gym, or the workshop. Really the place only existed for him to sleep and he hadn’t been there the past few days; being a supersoldier meant not having to sleep as much. He did crash on the couch in the living room for four hours, falling asleep while watching a bad Syfy original movie. And so it was a bit of a surprise when he went to his room, shrugging off his shirt, before stopping and staring.
“What does it look like?” Tony said. He held the bottle carefully between his two hands and lifted it for a long, careful drink. When he finished, he added, “It’s the only thing I can actually do.”
“That doesn’t surprise me.” Steve bit at his earlobe gently and scraped his teeth on his neck, sucking a mark high above the collarbone.
