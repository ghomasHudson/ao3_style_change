The tension is so palpable Tony can practically hear it in the silence that follows Wanda’s greeting; even Rhodey’s rehearsed ‘My legs are fine’ carries an element of bitterness.
“Okay, okay! I’m getting up!” Rhodey huffs, slipping his arms into the holds of his crutches. “Promise me you’ll take a shower before they get here? You smell worse than Hulk’s sweaty socks.”
“You do that.” She grins as she drags Tony by the hand across the room.  “But first, let's go meet your old buddies.”
Lovers? Tony remembers their first kiss; the memory leaves a sour taste on his tongue.
Rhodey doesn’t answer but the look in his eyes encourage Tony to continue.
Tony takes another gulp to suppress a shiver, humming gently as the burning liquor soothes his throat. His head is still reeling from the dream and he rations that perhaps, if he drinks enough, he'll be able to drown out his mother's harrowing screams as she cries Howard's name, over and over.
“Your rooms are also different, I cleared them out some time ago,”
“Yeah.”
Its sickening how domestic the rogues look, all cosied up together… it’s also bittersweet. They look like a family, and that’s all Tony has ever wanted. But now, as he stares across the table at the men and women who have disappointed him in ways he didn’t know he could hurt, Tony knows not to be fooled by Scarlet Witch's dainty smile and long eyelashes because nobody that seemingly innocent would ever force someone to live their worst nightmare. He understands not to fall for Natasha’s soothing tone, the bite of her betrayal still a painful wound.
“Me? I’m ecstatic! Boy, I can’t wait to see my ex, who tried to kill me, by the way, and my ol’ teammates, who all hate me.”
It was at times like this that Tony had to remind himself that living... was a victory -- or at least that's what Dr. Lee (his therapist) tells him.
Turned enemies?
Tony runs a distressed hand over his face.
“I know,” Tony interjects with a sigh. “I know they don’t Pepper, but…”
His apology is met by shocked expressions (excluding Rhodey and Vision, of course) and quite frankly Tony is offended that they all seem surprised by his basic manners; then again decent humanity may come as a foreign concept to the rogues. It’s not like any of them were particularly known for their pleasantries and… wow, was there still some unchecked resentment stewing in Tony's subconscious.
“I’m telling Banner you said that.” Tony threatens making Rhodey roll his eyes as he limps towards the door.
The situation doesn’t call for violence in the end, and though Tony wouldn’t quite consider himself a warmonger he quickly learns he’d rather fight to the death than watch the way Wanda’s shaking hands still under Steves gentle touch or how Clints jaw unclenches in a frustrated groan at the shake of Steve's head.
It's just that Tony regularly found himself aimlessly walking around the Avengers compound, his feet trying to lead him to the edge of a helicopter platform as they often did back at the tower in New York.
Of course, Tony would recognise that voice anywhere.
In my defence, I’ve been working on uni applications and school but it’s xmas break now so hopefully updates will come more frequently. I’m not giving up on the story.
“To prepare.”
“I’m fine.” Tony rasps, just about managing to spit the words out as he throws back his head in a pant, trying to suck in short bursts of oxygen. “Give me some space, Jesus.”
"Morning Tony."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony must blackout. He doesn’t remember the event that follows those few split seconds after Steve wraps a clammy hand around Tony’s wrist, but as his vision clears and his eyes piece together the pixelated scene in front of him, it isn’t difficult to guess what actions occurred.
“Want the truth?”
Tony thinks back to the portrait of Bucky in Steve’s journal, delicate lines sketching his eyes and lips. The twist in Tony’s stomach is answer enough.
“What nightmare was it this time? Afghanistan? The Cave?”
Tony pauses and swallows roughly trying to get rid of the frog in his throat.
Tony’s knees buckle and he falls onto all fours.
Tony watches the exaggerated grin falls from Steve's lips as the cogs turn and slot into place.
“Look are you done with the small talk?” Tony demands, taking a swift step back and narrowly avoiding Steve’s touch. “Because I really do have a meeting-”
He watches as she gives him a twice over and Tony shifts awkwardly under her stare, crossing his arms automatically, as if to shield himself from any judgmental looks, until he realises she’s just checking to see if he’s hurt.
She opens her mouth ready to argue once again when, without warning, the harsh slam of a door shutting interrupts. Chatter follows and together Tony and Pepper listen to the muffled conversation as, for the first time in nearly a year, the rogues are reunited with Rhodey and Vision.
“Is that everything?” Tony asks flatly.
“Good, that’s good.” Steve smiles, choosing to ignore Tony’s frosty tone. Tony doesn't reciprocate the kind gesture and an uncomfortable silence settles between them.
-- far too many times before with too many ‘what if’s plaguing his mind but no amount of BARF technology or therapy could turn back the time to change the past and answer his questions; even Tony’s friend Strange refused to tell him of a reality where Tony and Steve worked things out so what was the point in wishful thinking if it only ever ended in bitter tears and empty ice cream tubs?
At that, Tony pushes himself from the bed and pulls off his sticky shirt, throwing it on top of the pile of dirty bed sheets. Stumbling around the bed, Tony makes his way to the door of his ensuite where he can hear the shower already running, no doubt FRIDAY has set the water to his preferred temperature.
“FRIDAY.” Rhodey calls out pointedly.
Despite the haziness that fogs Tony’s head, as if cotton wool has replaced his brain, he somehow manages to register the voice talking to him.
Wanda rolls her eyes but Tony doesn’t react, he’s above entertaining her petty antics.
“He’s in his lab, should be coming now though.”
That, had hurt, a lot. To find out that on the last days of their relationship, while Tony was losing sleep fighting tooth and nail to modify the Accords to meet Steve’s fancy, Steve had been drawing pictures of another man.
“Justified absence? He’s still getting straight A’s right? So what’s the issue with one single absence? You know what — you can shove that policy up your ass. Call me when there’s a real problem.”
If Rhodey notices the unmistakable musk of sweat, tears, and vomit then he doesn't comment on it.
“What do you want?” Tony grits, roughly pressing his fingers into his chest and rubbing small circles.
Rhodey and Vision part to the sides as Tony and Pepper near, creating room for them to join the little crowd of superheros that had formed.
“Yeah.” Tony reassures her, stepping away from the mess before looking back up at her. “I’m fine.”
"-- Even though we were..."
“Yes, I am fully aware Peter was not in school on Monday.”
The lawyers shift uncomfortably in their seats, obviously sensing the growing tension and Tony fingers the watch on his wrist for support. He doesn’t expect to use it, but Tony finds comfort in the cold metal that cools his fingertips; knowing that in a moments notice he can transform the elegant jewelry into an iron fist with a tap and a swipe if the occasion escalates. Like Tony said before though, he doesn’t think he’ll need to use it but he’s been so very wrong before and he’ll be damned if he’s caught off guard ever again.
“I’ll have the revised version typed up for tonight and I’ll send it off to the UN for approval. If everything goes to plan, we’re going to have to get you guys some publicity training before you sign on Monday. I can’t have Nat punching another fat greasy guy because he told her to smile.”
His hair is longer, lighter too with highlighted strands interspersed among golden waves. His hair hangs past his ears and curls beneath the lobe. It seems as though the Wakandan vacation has treated him well; with blonde locks feathered across a tanned cheek, the depths of Steves gorgeous blue ocean eyes are amplified.
Tony often dreamt of Siberia. He often dreamt of Afghanistan too, hands pulling him deeper and deeper into freezing water. Other times he's in a cave, hundreds upon hundreds of dead bodies littered at his feet, unforgiving echos taunting him reminding Tony that their blood was on his hands. Occasionally, he'd dream of his parents; his mother's soft hands, Howards clenched jaw and tight fists, blood-soaked skin and a deserted road.
“But I’ve kept everyone’s belongings in the basement so just collect whatever you need from there.”
A pause follows as Tony closes his eyes to sort through his thoughts. The darkness behind his eyelids remind Tony of a particular nightmare. If he concentrates enough, Tony can just about block out Dum-E’s whirring and the stink of coffee and instead, he focuses on the inky black clouds that pull him from reality.
“-the world needs us; it needs the Avengers.” Tony exhales shakily. “I can deal with Cap and his disciples if it means the rest of the world is safe.”
Wanda, Sam, Steve and Natasha stand in a semicircle (Clint isn’t present now having ‘officially retired’ and Tony is thankful for one less bundle of brainwashed bullshit he has to deal with) with Steve situated in the middle, his legs planted firmly apart and arms crossed in a dominant fashion.
It isn't until his bedroom blinds begin to glow a soft orange colour that Tony realises he's made it through another night -- alive. Albeit, the returning nightmares often leave him feeling numb and emotionally exhausted but the fact remains that Tony lived to see another day, and that was a triumph.
Tony hears them before he sees them.
“What?” Tony replies cheekily. “Jealous because you’ve not been laid in a while?”
“I’m sor- I ha-“
Tony catches himself before he lets his thoughts drift down that path again. He’s been down that road--
"Nightmare?"
“One last thing, Tones.” Rhodey yells from across the room, stopping Tony is his tracks. “Promise me no more drinking.”
Tony shakes his head, a grimace twisting his features.
“Well, then. I guess we’re done here. You’re free to go,” Tony rushes as he turns to face the lawyers. “Thanks for the help - hey Jane! Look out for my call later I need help on some mandatory high school attendance bullshit for this kid I know.”
My mouth was slightly open "But Steve doesn't want her" she bit her lip "That's why she wants you to break his heart, or else she'll expose us." I sat down next to her, rested a hand on my shoulder and sighed "Tony I am sorry about what I did, and we can call this thing off publicly whenever you want". No matter how angry I was at her, it didn't matter she was still one of the only people there for me "Pep I'm sorry too, I've been lying to myself for a really long time, I probably drove you into Rhody's arms.". There was a comfortable silence before a knock on the door ruined it.
He thrusted in and came without any warning, he looked up and let out a breath "Fucking hell Tony, you feel so good" I gasped, out of breathe "Steve Rogers did you just curse!". He pulled out, but I could see he wasn't done, I sat him down on the mattress and climbed onto his lap so I could ride him. I squated over him and began to whisper in his ear "Sit back, relax Cap, let me take care of you".
"The beatings were usually every night, started when I was ten, I spilled orange juice over some important business files, and by the time I reached fourteen they didn't bother me anymore, so he stepped it up". He told me about his teenage years, both sides, the side people seen, the partying, drinking, getting high, taking tests hungover and acing them, and the side no one seen, the lonely nights in a massive house, the being kicked out on the street, the fear of going home, even his suicide attempt.
She was in a tight black dress and carrying a pair of silver shoes "So what are you doing here if you're not a reporter anymore?"  She invited herself to sit on the bed "Well I was down at the bar looking for some meaningless sex but once I heard you were here I just knew where to go". I knew she was being sarcastic but just to be sure I snorted "not happening". "Oh I know Tony, I'm just testing my theory".
I was shocked, the people were going crazy around him, everyone stared at me but I kept my eyes on the screen. I think Natasha was trying to talk to me but I was tunned into the TV, he was smiling "Any questions, but be cool guys because I can still kick your ass" he took one "So does this mean you are retiring?" He smirked, "Oh yeah that, no, I will remain as acting CEO of Stark Industries.". Eventually, Bucky broke me out of the trance "Steve we have to hit the road" I looked at the TV and back to him, and stood up "Yeah okay...".
"Before we start Mr Strak has a special announcement!" I stood up and took the mix "Thank you. As many of you and your readers have been wondering about myself and Pepper's engagement I would like to share the following news on behalf of the two of us. Myself and Pepper have discussed this at length and we've decided that the best thing to do is just be honest, Ms Potts and I are no longer together-" cameras flashed, reports shouted and gasped, I waited and then continued "I'll keep it to the point, we've been lying to ourselves for a really long time, but neither of us could go through with this, she has happily found love, something I could never give her, I have too much respect  for Ms Potts. We will not be taking questions at this time."
We got onto the ship and Tony sat down in the pilot seat "Where are we going Wong?" "The centre of the earth". His laugh made me smile "Got an address for that?".
We spent a bit of time socialising, but then it was time for dinner. It was a rustic style dining area, there wasn't a top table, just a small table for Pepper and Rhodey, so Tony sat next to me at a table for the team, Thor, Bruce, Clint, Laura, Natasha and Bucky. The rest of the superheroes were scattered around on different tables. The dinner was served and there was a relaxing atmosphere well established by the time they got up for their first dance. Once the rest of guests joined them on the dancefloor Tony leaned over, moving his hand onto my thigh "How about we sneak away" his hand slipped onto my crotch. I smirked and let him lead me away from the empty table.
His smile was comforting "Well I'm waiting?" Of course he would say that "Tony, I would very much like it if you would go on a date with me sometime?". He rolled back into the cuddle "Of course I will, now go to sleep before your dick realises how close my ass is to you, I wouldn't want you to break a hip during round two". I had a smug smile and kissed his ear "You underestimate that serum, I'm already ready for round two". "Oh god, you're going to kill me aren't you". He kissed the scar on the back of my neck "Goodnight Tony" he whispered.
He giggled "Friday, music please" music started playing, music I recognized from the 40s. "We didn't get to finish our dance". The music was up best and fast, "Tony I don't know how to", he moved his feet and arms with the music "Just act like you know what your doing".
"Who's this Strange". Tony laughed "A wizard, kind of a jerk, but I needed to push someone's buttons while you were gone". It was too hard to look at him, his big brown eyes brought back all the memories I had been avoiding for the past two years. "I am sorry Tony, about it all, I didn't want to leave you".
About three hours later Steve felt Tony shift, nothing big, simply tensing his muscles before he relaxed again.
"No I don't believe it." Steve muttered, sounding less confident than before. "I doubt you'll recognise me but I was one of the soldiers who helped get you out of the cave. I know you aren't like those asshole reporters say you are." Oh. The cave. The dark, the dust. No water. Unless he was being dunked. No food. No more Ynsen. Oh god! Now he couldn't breath. Shit!
"You're alive, oh god! You're alive. It's gonna be okay, I'll fix you. It's what I do. I fix things. Not that your broken, you're a little skinnier but your not broken. But I can still fix you, call it an upgrade. A new design, I'll make you better Steve, I'm gonna need the others help but I will make you better okay?" Tony wasn't sure if he was reassuring Steve or himself anymore but either way it worked, he got his shit together and was able to pull away and still have some dignity.
?" He exclaimed, pushing up onto his hand. Using the other to rub his eyes.
"No your not, this is my fault, I'm going to be the one to fix it. You've all been on my case for God knows how long, I'm not about to let you claim the limelight." He argued, waiting calmly for the elevator doors to open before pushing The Widow out, it wasn't difficult as she was quite small and not expecting him to react in such a way. He grinned and waved a metal clad hand as the doors closed, preventing Tony from hearing her various, creative insults.
"Easy, easy... Eagerness will get you nowhere." Tony chided, nipping the inside of Steve's thigh for good measure. Steve nodded again, not trusting himself to talk coherently. Once he deemed Steve stretched enough, Tony withdrew and began to prepare the plug, pressing it against Steve's entrance and sliding it in until it was comfortably secure. Steve began to sit up once more but was forced back down by the vibrations running from his ass and all the way through his body.
ride, apparently. At least that's what he could assume.
Apparently the saga really was as crap as Natasha had said as the team decided to call it quits for the night and return to their floors, never to watch the final two films. Steve couldn't say he cared as he had no idea what was going on anyway.
"You're close aren't you Steve, I can see how tight you're wound up. I want you to beg, Steve. But if you beg before you really need to then you'll be punished, and I mean it this time. I might even see if we have a paddle, I'll have you crying in agony but still wanting more." Tony threatened, which obviously made Steve leak all over again.
Steve rolled onto his back but didn't open his eyes, still wanting to get back to sleep. While he was still tired, Steve felt well rested, similar to when he'd been pulled out of the Potomac; lighter and more alive. "What?" He groaned, rubbing his face.
A metallic knock shocked Tony out of his thoughts, making him leap 3 feet high into the air and fall on his knees facing the door, eyes wide in shock, a shaky hand pointing in the general direction. After five minutes of listening to his own racing heartbeat, Tony realised he must have been hearing things he wanted to hear...
He wasn't allowed the luxury of sleep however, as his knight returned with three pints of water and some aspirin. 'Drink two now and the third in the morning with two of these.' Steve had instructed. Pulling up a chair to watch as he did so, waiting until he was done drinking before asking: 'what happened?'
Steve snapped his attention to Bruce, brushing past Tony and rushing over. "What? What is it?" He urged, eyes scanning each screen. Bucky had crouched down on his knees and was clutching his metal arm to his chest, head bowed to rest on one knee. Steve wandered if it was a way of silencing the screams that threatened to escape and reveal his identity.
"Seriously James, did you eat at all?" Natalia pressed, gently tipping his head back and using the shower attachment to wet his tangled hair. Her hands were strong but managed not to hurt him as she got the knots and clotted blood out, not pulling too hard and making sure to keep his face dry.
"Yeah, his floor is kinda shut down at the moment. No one allowed, not even him," Clint explained, his voice still icy cold but softer than it had been at their first meeting. "I like the nickname though," he added with a mischievous grin.
Stark Tower. One thing he knew, he'd observed the place for a good week or so, he knew the area well. No apparent outside threats that he could remember. He knew Stark's security was tight, he'd seen a simple business man get thrown out, shortly followed by his Swiss Army knife...
"Could I go to my floor? Alone...?"
"You're very drunk" the Gucci model said, voice low and patronising in a way that shouldn't have gone to his groin in the way he did. "You also need to come away from that window." He added in a softer tone. He began to walk and Tony bit his lip, he could almost see the muscles rippling under the too tight t-shirt. He practically swooned when the guy leaned up behind him and shut the window. He smelt like heaven, all grassy and musky, sweat mixed with soap and some fancy aftershave, hints of coffee on his breath.
"Okay, how do you wanna do this?" Tony asked cautiously, frowning at the four tall stacks of sketches adorning the partially repaired coffee table. "You want to keep them all?" He guessed, his thoughts confirmed by Steve's subtle nod, Tony wasn't sure if that was wise but for now he wouldn't argue.
Sounds of movement stilled Steve's cautious steps, the scraping of shoes against concrete as though they were too tired to lift far from the ground. The sound resonated between the narrow walls of the alley; echoing and breaking the silence. A figure staggered out of the shadows, swift and steady. Accidentally ending up in a shaft of sunlight that penetrated the cloud layer. Each ray of light reflecting every colour on each drop that continued to fall, miniature rainbows forming and then disappearing just as quickly.
"When did you last sleep? And please don't lie 'cause I don't have JARVIS to tell me the truth." He grumbled, ever so slightly bitter. He reached a hand out to rest over Steve's to show he wasn't truly angry, thumbing over tense knuckles.
"Tony..." Steve started, not sure what was going on. "Tony, what are we doing here?" He asked curiously, frowning in confusion. Tony turned to him, taking both hands in his own gazing intently up at him.
“I’ll deal with the medical, you deal with the engineer.” The first voice, he still didn’t have a name to put to it, or a face. If he didn’t concentrate it almost felt like he was back under Hydra’s control.
hangovers. He was a hero long before he became 'War Machine', at least he was to Tony.
"Bucky, minus an arm. Although we have the arm as well. He's in a bad way Tony, we need to bring him back to the tower. Is there somewhere we can keep him..."
"I want you on your back okay?" Tony asked, running the heel of his hand up Steve's sweaty spine. He nodded and took some deep breaths, letting Tony get to work releasing him before he rolled over. The toy was still inside but it was more comfortable than pleasurable, sure it was nice but he had grown used to the sensations from the plug earlier.
Natalia tilted her head, crossing her arms and shifting her weight. “You get a choice to receive it now, or we wait until the infection likely gets worse and you get it when you’re unconscious.” She shrugged. “See we still want you alive, if not for your sake then for Steve’s”
He was gonna have to talk to the team at some point, maybe he'd rope both Sam and Bruce into speaking with Steve, assessing him to see if he should be formerly benched, he hoped that would take a while as he really wanted to see the arm. He would make Bucky a new one, a better one that was lighter, that came off easier, that was stronger, he wouldn't give it to him until he was sure it was safe but he would do it anyway. It would make Steve happy after all.
"What the hell Barnes? It's like you want to be in chains!" Clint cried, picking up his stack of dropped clothing and stalking off into a room, possibly the bedroom or bathroom.
What was it Sam had told him to do? Ah, that was it,
He was up and assessing the situation before he realised how much better he felt. It made him pause again, he didn’t feel dizzy anymore, his head didn’t throb and he felt ready to run for a few hours, like he had too much energy in his system. He caught his reflection in the glass, someone had changed him into light grey joggers and a white shirt, he was still too slim, but he looked less like the ghostly sallow figure he’d been when he last saw himself.
"Sorry spangles, but you've just boosted my ego by about 10. And the team will agree that it didn't particularly need a boost." He grinned lazily, shuffling around so his head was now resting on Steve's thigh, which was more than a little inconvenient considering he was actually going to draw during the next film.
Again Bucky noticed how Natalia's speech was both powerful and calming. Even if he couldn't remember, he could understand why he was drawn to Natalia.
"What the fuck do you want, birdbrain?" He hissed, trying to keep his voice down. "I was doing really well with Steve, I got him to eat and shower an he even talk-"
"I like high places, Barnes. Means I get to watch everything." He declared, obviously talking offence at Bucky's inquisitive expression.
"Brunch?" He asked, needing to know he wasn't forcing Steve.
"How about we sort them according to person? So any that are Peggy go in one pile, any that are Bucky go in another, etcetera..." Tony motioned to the piles, hoping Steve would follow his lead. He picked up the biggest pile and shuffled to one side of the sofa, facing inwards so there was room between them. Steve grabbed his own pile and copied his actions, he already looked slightly better, the magic of a Stark Tower Shower.
Even with his considerable malnutrition and clear lack of energy, Bucky managed to be faster than Steve. All the alleys connected in a vast network of streets. Bucky turned down many, some connecting to others, but most being dead ends with walls or fences that Bucky jumped over. Even like this the assassin was still more agile. Steve struggled to maintain speed when he kept crashing into walls, ending up so far behind he relied on the sound of Bucky's feet pounding into puddles for direction.
"Morning Kid, what's going on". Tony asked the question but walked away, leaving the door open for Peter to follow him "Um I just wanted your opinion because, eh I've never been to a wedding so I don't know what to wear". I laughed as quietly as I could, but it drew his attention to me "Captian, Sir, what are you even doing here?".
I picked up my clothes, ready to make a run for it. "Don't leave Tony" "Steve the rest of the team can't know about this". I was still going to marry Pepper "Tony can you not just stay with me, please". That damn beard and those eyes. I crawled back onto the bed "Don't be surprised if I'm gone in the morning" "Well I'm honoured to be on Tony Stark's list" I sighed, it was a really really long list, too long. "Honour is all mine, I'm the man that took Captain America's virginity, that's a one night stand I'll remember".
Steve's sketch pad cought my attension, it was on the locker on the other side of the bed. I could hear him humming in the bathroom. I streched over and took a look at it, couple of boring building, trees and birds. I was closing it over when a sheet fell onto my lap, it was of me. It melted my heart how much he paid attension to detail.
They listened to me and went towards the kitchen, but of course, Tony didn't "Steve about what I said-" "I'm sorry that I made you say that" he looked down at his lap with a little smile "You didn't make me, and I don't regret telling you". Natasha came in "Are you boys done making googly eyes at each other, we're heading to bed".
"Oh my god! You two are fucking!" Steve's head snapped back at me, he was turning red "What! no we're not!" I smiled "Yes you are!". Scott scrunched his face up "Oh my god, Captain America and Iron Man doing it!".
W A K A N D A
He mumbled "Fuck, okay, please listen to me, I am this close" he pressed his fingers together "to getting Steve to trust technology with more intimate things, and I really need that before I start going on business trips again, so please, do this one thing for me, I'm going to call Steve up here, I'm going to make out with him and you two are going to walk in". I looked at Sam, and copied him when he stood up "Okay Tony, but only because I know you make him happy".
He dropped the gun "No, I'm not doing that!". Clint butted in "Steve if we don't get this stone Thor and Bruce die, right now". I picked the gun up off the floor and placed it in his hand "it's okay Steve, just shoot me, it's not real, I'll be waiting when yous get the last stone".
I came thrusting into his mouth. I got up and threw him onto the bed "fifteen minutes Cap", I lifted both his legs up using one of my hands, leaving his ass exposed. I sprayed cream from where his balls lay down to his hole and threw it onto the floor. I grabbed each leg his a hand and spread them wide apart so I could see his face he was biting his lip aggressively "Cold?" He nodded. I sucked on his balls, making him forget about the coldness, slowly I moved my tongue down lapping up the cream. I got stuck in when I came to his hole, it drove him insane, he grasped at the bed and moaned as I flicked my tongue and his hand ran up and down his erection. He came just like that. I lay flat out next to him "We have five minutes, shower?" "Hell yes!" I was stern "just a shower Tony". He was already at the bathroom door "whatever you say, Cap".
A text came through, Sam tapped it "What are you doing!" I snapped "Sorry it was a force of habit". It was too late the message was open. Sam gaspes and showed me 'I can't focus right now, I just keep thinking about how you took control last night" I was trying to wrap my head around it but still reading  "tying me up and pushing into me, I'm surprised I held out so long" "I know texting isn't your things, but I just want your opinion on some underwear" there was a photo of a man, only showing his underwear, they were skimpy and lace, a deep red colours.
After a while I was out of breath and ready to come, I impaled myself one more time he only had to stroke me once before I came. I let my head fall onto his chest. He lay me down softly but continued to thrust into me. He got faster faster, I kept my hands around his neck and started to claw into his back as I felt his tip hit my prostate. I couldn't make scene of my words, just a lot of moans. He came with a shout and let the cum leak out of my ass.
• After the snap •
Thor had gone back to rebuilding Asgard, after everything cooled down he found out that Loki had managed to save a significant number of his people. They still popped in every now and again when Thor came to visit Jane.
Tony's POV
I lay a hand on his shoulder but he swatted it away "How could I possibly expect you to understand anyway, I can't wait to see what you have in store for us, what's your worst memory? Huh? Too many girls throwing themselves at you, or too much money for a 17 year old to spend? I wonder how many cars your had going to high school! Stark you have no idea what home means". I didn't respond to him I just walked away, the guy just watched his wife die and he couldn't do anything about it.
We all needed to be linked together and pretty much cursed then the stones would choose to hide in our darkest memories. If we couldn't find a stone in the time we had...well let's just say I couldn't imagine losing another team member.
King of Wakanda even managed to join us, the orange tie stood out but his sister Shuri looked fantastic in her orange, off the shoulder dress, it had Roses along the strap and fell nicely. In the photo she had just flicked her brother in the ear.
She walked out the door, I stood looking down the hallway "Thank you Ms Everheart, and congratulations" "No problem Mr Stark".  My food arrived at last and I picked up the business folder I had been ignoring for almost six whole months.
We had light and cheerful conversation but it was getting late. I whispered to Tony, rubbing my hand down his back "How about we get to bed?". He smiled, stood up and took my hand "We are going to turn in, I will see all you guys at Pepper and Rhodey's wedding, safe travels". He nodded and dragged me up the stairs.
I climbed up and got the box I wanted. I stumbled and fell but Steve caught me like I was his bride. The box had a Captain America shield on it and he grinned "So what's in the box?". I opened it and showed him a cream teddy bear wearing a Captian America suit "Peggy made it for me"
I laughed as Steve had a stupid smile on his face as Tony pulled him away and up the stairs.
I pushed Sharon off me and went after him. I looked around but I couldn't see him. Peter was laughing with Wanda "Hey kid, have you seen Tony?". He smiled "Oh-yeah- Mr Stark, he went that way". "Thanks, Peter". I clapped him on the back. I searched the whole crowd for him, eventually, I just texted him, I texted him a few times.
A fleet of cars were coming near the compound "That's a lot more cars than what left here" Tony walked towards the lift "Did no one tell you? That's the after party".
I thought it would be hard to hide our relationship with so many people living with us, but it wasn't, it was actually easy.
She took Steve's hand and led him to a room. Now it was just us and Peggy. She pulled a gun and clicked the barrel "Do you love me Steve?" he placed both his hands on her arms "Of course I do Peggy!" A tear rolled down from her brown eyes to her red lips, she placed a gun in his hand "You have to choose then, you have to chose who you love it's me or Anthony".

"Cap would you take the boxes out to the bin?", he took the boxes and disappeared, "okay tell me what's wrong?". He looked down, and had a gloomy look "I got into a fight with May" "over what?" He swallowed the little bit of crust he had in his hand "Harold". I raised my eyebrows "Happy?" He nodded "Why?" "He's dating May, so I told her if she didn't send him home I was leaving" "Jesus kid did you tell her where you were?" "No". I pinched my nose and took out my phone 'the kid is at the compound with me and Steve, don't worry he'll be fine with us tonight'.
I was dressed but didn't move off the bed, Tony was putting on his jacket and still trying to defend himself "I told you I didn't want to take your virginity, I warned you". There was a knock on the door.
"How about a 10-minute break to clear our heads" Pepper suggested. She took my hand in hers and dragged me out the door. I caught a glimpse of Steve's angry face on my way out.
Steve yelled from the bathroom "Hey Tony, I think your shower is broken, you might want to come and hop in with me" he opened the door with a towel wrapped around his waist, but he couldn't see Wanda, I tried to get him to stop but he didn't pick up on my signal "Come on Doll, are you really going to turn down a shower with me?".
Thor couldn't just stand back and watch his people get slaughtered, it was his worst nightmare. We began fighting with the army, I threw my shield to protect Thor and he gave me a smile, it faded quickly when we heard a load shot, his father fell to the ground "No!".
"Come on Stark, sooner we find the stone the sooner we get Peter back". I closed my helmet and flew off, getting to the throne room before Natasha and Bruce.
I blushed a little, before I pushed his face away "Come on Captian, I'm all yours for tonight". He ran his tongue along the shell of my left ear, making me shiver. He pecked my lips before moving to my right ear and running his hot tongue along it "Don't you get it Tony, your all mine, every night". He didn't give me a chance to respond he kissed me again in the lips.
"Oh great, does this mean I get Tony's feet?" Bruce dead-panned, frowning when Tony just lifted his legs and waited before Bruce sat down before lowering them. Unwilling to lean on his legs, Bruce but a cushion over them, resting his bowl of peanut 'm'n'm's' on it. Steve blinked a few times, still not entirely sure how this had become his life.
All he wanted to do was run away and turn back the clock about a year, maybe just after the chitouri, when they were eating shwarma. Sure there was still something akin to unpleasantness between him and the good captain but it hadn't lasted long.
Nodding slowly, Bucky reached for the cup of slowly melting ice chips and sipped from the glass, still feeling awful. He tipped his head back against the headrest, closing his eyes again and trying to stay awake. “Fine, whatever you need to give me, I consent.” He stated clearly, not even having the energy to be alarms when Bruce came back into the room with a tray of equipment.
"I think you're going to like this, my pretty boy... We've never tried it before so if you don't you
"Tony, your not thinking rationally, you need to calm down... Can you take some deep breaths?-" Tony took a deeper inhale as he could, following orders likes good little soldier. "-thats it, you're doing great, and again... There we go, it's getting easier now isn't it?" Tony nodded slowly against Rhodey's chest. "A few more like that and you'll be able to think properly, Steve will be fine, he knows how important he is and won't put that on the team. No, Tony come on, deep breathing, keep it up." Rhodey pulled back a little so he could stroke the hair from Tony's clammy forehead.
"Evening,” aman spoke from in front of him, a man he'd only just noticed.
Once the elevator stopped and the doors breezed open, Bucky had become very nervous. He didn't know if he would encounter anyone, he didn't know the layout, it could be a trap.
"Don't take that bandage off, I'll have a look tomorrow but you'll still need to go to the doctors just to check it." He insisted, trying not to bump him on the way through doors. Tony clung to Steve's shirt, resting his head on one strong shoulder. He nodded glumly and didn't want to let go when Steve set him down on Bucky's bed, he didn't really want to sleep alone.
"Dude, how do you do that?" He heard Sam question in awe. Not many people could calm the captain like this, however Thor's gentle waves of wisdom never failed to get a positive reaction from Steve. Thor simply shrugged, a slight upward turn of his lips the only indication of his smugness.
"C'mon James... You know you don't bathe with clothes on." She chastised kindly, a very unsubtle hint for Bucky, clearly sensing his confusion. The assassin nodded and began to tug the buttons of his jeans undone, he began to push them down and ended up kicking them off, having to hold onto the sink to make sure he didn’t fall over. When he was done with that he shrugged out of his boxers with little thought about being naked around a woman and then stepped slowly into the bath.
. He stopped trying after that, while he couldn’t remember everything he knew that the asset once trusted Natalia and still could. Now that he was alone, though, he could take in his surroundings and establish the danger levels and possible risk to his safety.
Steve ripped a clean sheet from his sketchbook and used a larger A3 one to lean on, it was flatter and had more room to go over the edges. He hadn't thought much about what he was going to draw for Tony, it wasn't hard to conjure up an image however. Tony was the type who admired himself, so he was more likely to admire something Steve drew, if it was of Tony.
Until it stopped, and Steve was lost. The sun was gone and the rain was getting heavier. He tried his hardest to listen for any sign of life, heavy breathing, pained moans, anything.
"That was uncalled for." He muttered, pressing his thumb into the recognition pad, opening the secondary glass door (designed so he could see who was approaching) and sauntering into his favourite floor in the building. "J, where are my spare repulsors?" He asks, finding the newest suit he had and detaching below the elbow, glad he'd decided to introduce a 'clip on, clip off' system.
“The Hulk, that’s you?” Bucky hadn’t only researched Steve in his time, he’d made an effort to know who the captain spent his time with.
“I am, which means I don’t want to fight with him again on the same topic. He’s angry, Nat. You wanna argue with him before he’s had a chance to be rational then you go right ahead. But you’ll be wasting your time and I know you know that.” The voice started to sound irritated, Bucky didn’t like that it was so close to him.
Her steps had been deliberate yet delicate, almost like a dancer's’ might be, every move was planned and perfected but it held grace and control. Her penetrating gaze never left the assassins form, analysing every inch, taking in all the bruising and scars (old and new), the dirt, the way his ribs stuck out like a cliff over a sunken stomach, even the matted clumps of filth in his tangled hair. His beard itched something fierce, he was in dire need of a shower, a shave and some clean clothes but he had no idea what the intentions were of the people before him.
It had been a bad move. Talking. The assassin had been analysing the soldier in the same way.
He could even say he was grateful. Any longer and he wasn't sure he'd have survived. Still scavenging from bins and hiding out in alleys, Bucky hadn't been able to venture out into the streets. He was wrecked and constantly slipping between himself and the assassin, not to mention the fact he was clutching a metal limb at all times. If anyone saw him they would call the police in seconds and he wouldn't have a chance to run. His best bet was to wait it out as long as he could and when he couldn't he would surrender. Giving into that sleep of death where no dreams would come.
"Where's what Steve?" Sam asked, an appropriate mix of concern and confusion.
"Do it again..." He ordered, as though he's just been shown something wonderous and fascinating and amazing.
Tony smiled wide at Steve's choices, taking the others out of his hands, slipping into role. "Im going to go and set the bed up, by the time I'm done I want you naked and close to orgasm okay? If you come before I say so then you're going to regret it" He warned, walking backwards to the bed until Steve nodded obediently. He watched Tony as he began to strip, folding his clothes neatly and setting them by the wall, first Tony removed the duvet, apparently not wanting it to get in the way. Then he slid the bar behind some of the posts until the cuff poked out in the right place, it would lock Steve's hands together and to the bed, his cock throbbed at the thought. Taking himself in his hand, Steve began to slowly stroke himself, refraining from groaning from the recent lack of touch (Tony had been away on business for two weeks and they didn't have time for anything before Tony crashed for 14 hours. They also had a sort of unspoken 'no pleasuring yourself' rule...unless instructed otherwise).
"You can do this, I know you can." He insisted, giving Tony the strength he needed to pull himself together. As if Rhodey's words were like a rope being tightened around the shattered pieces of his mind and holding him in one place, grounding him. Slowly, Tony pulled out of Rhodey's arms, bringing his hands to his face and rubbing his tired eyes.
The man came to a halt by a sofa, raising an eyebrow skeptically. "Sure you do, where do you really live?" He demanded, getting a little less soft thinking that Tony was toying with him. In response, he held out the water and lifted his chin, challenging Tony to come and get it himself.
"Right, yes... Sorry. Yes or no questions. I don't care about your opinion but I'm gonna ask anyway: I'm gonna fetch a laser component and an old repulsor, you'll wanna stand far away and to the side, it might get messy...that okay?" His tone didn't leave much room for comment but Tony heard two knocks nonetheless. Ignoring them completely, Tony pressed the button for his workshop, hoping no one would be waiting for him.
Bucky may have grown up in the forties and been in the war, but he hated feeling grimy, especially since becoming the assassin. As a sniper he hadn't got up close and personal with the Hydra agents he was shooting. The KGB turned him into a monster, one who was used to kill up close and from afar. It took weeks to get the taste of blood out the first time. With more memory wipes came less concern and the man behind the mask hibernated in order to save himself. Now he was woken, and all the awful sensations and feelings were at the forefront of his mind. He could taste his own blood and sick, smell the alcohol and rotting food left on his body from his stay in the alleys, he could just about see how awful his hair was. He'd come to like it long, once it was past the stage where there was nothing to be done with it but let it fall into his eyes and irritate him. He knew there were patches of dried blood all over, scabs and scars that took longer than usual to disappear. Bucky was going to need Natalia to help him clean properly, especially when he only had one arm.
"That's just Clint, cap. He once broke his wrist and carried on fighting, the idiot doesn't know when to stop." She said fondly, earning a very childish 'blah blah blah, whatever' from Clint. He looked dead on his feet this time, worse than Steve did. It had helped to a certain extent however, the sparing had helped him get rid of the energy sparking in his muscles, exhausting him to the point where he could relax. The hunt for Bucky hadn't been successful so far.
“No, it won’t… We’ll have to figure out how to make them both stable before we re-introduce them though. That if Tony even lets us.” Natalia said.
Steve muttered, frantically lifting papers and cushions and random wrenches that Tony seemed to leave laying around. After sparring the trio went for a short swim in the hopes of loosening Clint's shoulder. Then they cleaned up and met in the communal kitchen, Sam and Thor preparing snacks for the movies they were going to watch; Sam, who had a twelve year old niece, decided the team needed to be put through the same tortures he suffered, in the form of the 'Twilight saga'. Steve had read the synopsis and figured he would get away with sketching for the 7 or so hours that he and the team would be suffering for. Only he couldn't find it.
that wasn't an uncommon thought throughout the team. Steve was the first to recover, swallowing and clenching his hands into fists. This was a new low, even for Tony.
"I told you he wouldn't be happy." Sam called, setting two bowls down on the coffee table, laughing at the man who'd fallen to the floor in shock.
Tony couldn't answer, the basement would be fine, the lab was possible, the medical wing would be okay, his workshop had restraints but it wasn't exactly ideal. The back-end of Bag-end would be good. Anywhere away from Steve for now.
That voice was new, Bucky couldn’t force his eyes open to see who it was on his left. He absently felt gentle fingers prodding around the metal still on his shoulder. It felt almost detached from his own body.
"There are three in the spare parts box, sir." JARVIS informed as the same time as Natasha mouthed 'repulsors' with nothing more than vague confusion in her eyes.
“I’ll stay here to add 20ml of the glucose every hour, but that should run very slowly for the next 5 hours” He said, “Then I’ll run a regular saline bag, depending on how you’re doing. Try and get some more rest James, we’ll talk about the next steps when you wake up again.” He told him, but Bucky was hardly listening anymore. He was slumped down, managing to shuffle back into a lying position. He closed his eyes, too tired to worry that there were people in the room he didn’t trust. The last thing he felt before completely losing consciousness was a heavy blanket being draped over him.
Bucky blinked opening his bleary eyes, the scarce light piercing his cornea and stabbing his brain. The painful
"Good." Tony said, raising up on his knees and chucking the flannel to one side, swiftly bring his palm down on Steve's left cheek. Steve cried out loudly, the area when Tony's hand connected stinging like a bitch.
"Did I program you to comment on my sleeping habits? And don't say I did, I programmed you to
So, four weeks and a lot of hunting later Tony was sat against the sealed elevator door of Steve's floor. He wasn't sure how he'd done it but the door would not open, and JARVIS could not give any indication of Steve's condition.
Bucky took some deep breaths and reminded himself not to panic, he wasn’t in any shape to fight every person in this room, and if he was still in Stark tower then there were plenty other people who would be here to put him down. He noticed he was still attached to fluids, they were pulling slightly, still hanging on the drip-stand. He walked over to it, seeing if there was a way to detach himself single-handed before deciding it was too much hassle.
"I haven't peeked, don't worry." He said blatantly, looking in the reflection of one of his monitors back at Steve. "I wanted to, believe me I did. Oh and Jarvis, next time I tell you to keep something quiet I expect you to do as I ask as that's what I programmed you to do." He spat, clearly more annoyed than usual at his AI.
Shaking his head, he became aware of someone saying his name, it sounded echoey in the room and it put his teeth on edge. He felt like he was in a lab, locked up and ready to be experimented on. He turned to the source of the noise, seeing the doctor that had shown him so much kindness before.
"Okay, this is gonna sting, I'm sorry." He warned, At least this time he remembered. Tony wasn't sure what it was but Steve wasn't kidding. Once he'd carefully removed the towel, Steve began to dab at the wound with cotton wool soaked in some army regulation disinfectant and
“So I’ve read.”
Protecting the population wouldn’t bring back those caught in his crossfire or the families who suffered at the mercy of his hijacked missiles. It wouldn’t amend his sins either -- but it was a start. The only way Tony could protect people was through The Avengers, it’s why he joined in the first place.
A moment of silence follows as Rhodey tentatively pushes the door the rest of the way open. Tony, however, doesn’t shun him away, only brings a hand up and waves Rhodey inside. It takes him a few seconds to hobble over, dodging the mound of dirty bed sheets strewn in the middle of the floor but soon enough he's sitting at the foot of Tony's bed.
“That only happened once Stark, let it go already.” She argues but there’s no bite to it. She looks the most relaxed of the lot, slouching in her chair, arm hooked over the back of Clints.
God, this was almost too dramatic for even genius, billionaire, philanthropist, and playboy Tony Stark himself.
And though Steve is literally the last person on earth Tony wants to see him like this, his voice still somehow calms Tony down.
Breathe Tony, C’mon. Breathe.
Rhodey barks a laugh at her cheekiness and Tony groans in exasperation. He doesn’t really mind though, Tony appreciates any sort of conversation that doesn’t involve his suicidal tendencies, the Avengers or the old delivery guy that continued to call Tony ‘Mr. Stank’. Don’t get Tony Stark started on that bloody postman.
He tries to ignore the twist in Steve’s expression, but from the corner of his eyes he registers the sharp flash of hurt that pulls at Steve’s lips. It makes Tony’s stomach clench uncomfortably and his fingers tingle with an urge to smooth out the tense lines on Steve’s forehead.
“Tha’s enough outta you.” Tony grumbles rolling his eyes and swatting Rhodey away. “Now get up, chop chop. We have a big day ahead of us.”
Between Tony's pounding temples and ringing ears, he hears a small creak from across the room and his head snaps up to find Rhodey leaning in the doorway; leg braces, crutches and all.
“On Peter’s life, promise me.”
The lull of awkward conversation immediately dies the second Tony steps through. The rogues turn to the scene and Tony tries not to flinch under the scrutiny. His feet feel heavier under the weight of everyone staring, each step taking more effort than the last and it takes all of his willpower not to crumble as he draws one foot out and in front of the other.
“He was sick.” Tony states down the phone as he makes his way to a seat at the opposing head, barely containing a sigh as the schools receptionist begins explaining the conditions for a school absence.
“I don’t want to see them, Rhodey. I’m not ready.”
For the first time in nearly a year, the entire team is back together, alone.
Tony didn't want to die. That being said, subconsciously, Tony didn’t particularly care to live either.
“Sorry for tha’ depression session.” Tony chuckles. “I’m just being dramatic. Everythin’s getting to my head. M’sorta worried that m’never going to get better. Was just another shitty nightmare. Where’s Pepper? What time s’it? How long till they get here?”
A dangerously cold silence settles over the room as Tony’s words land. It is only when Clint clenches his fists, Wanda’s eyes flare with a dangerous energy and Sam flinches that Tony realises that perhaps mentioning the Civil War with such a blasé attitude was not his smartest idea.
"Whacha doin' Tony?" He called, striding across the large floor.
"I've only been awake around half an hour." He spoke around a yawn, rubbing his eyes in a way that gave him a childlike cuteness. "You finish my sketch yet?" He asked, sounding a little bored, but his eyes betrayed the excitement he was clearly feeling so Steve didn't comment.
could be
"Buck...." Steve whispered, his throat tightening as his breathing became shallow, his fight or flight response battling it out in his blood.
The memory generated a wave of sadness that in turn created deep pools in his eyes that spilled over the lip of his eyelid and onto the sharp plains of his cheek, only to cling for life on his chin but being unable to hold the weight when two more droplets gathered there. Deep sobs took over the hyperventilation, his shoulders shaking from the sheer force of it, probably scaring Tony even more. His hand fisted in Tony's shirt, holding on as if it was the one thing keeping him together. The man before him shuffled closer and wrapped two strong arms around him, resting his chin on the blondes cranium.
"So, Mr Stark, want to tell me why you fell through my window?" Drat, he did know who Tony was. It didn't seem to make a difference though as the reason he fell (for the second time at least) was hovering above his chest. In the hopes it would help sober him up a little, Tony took the water bottle and downed the contents.
"No, we're done. You should put some ice on your shoulder. And tell me in future when you're hurt, I don't need special treatment." He said, a little more forcefully than he had intended. Lucky, Natasha was there to save him the embarrassment and awkward apology he had grown so used to using.
"You're in the basement of Stark Tower. That's Clint, he doesn't like that you put Steve in hospital, then ran from him. Don't worry though, he'll get over it..."
"I also said I helped save you. I was one of the medics, this
Sam snorted, stealing the pastry out of the archers hand. "Who cares, the thunder God brought us food from France, still warm. Steve, you gotta try this." He laughed, setting another plate out and holding food out of Clint's reach.
Sorry for it being  day late, real life got in the way. As always any and all mistakes are my own (and I read through it tho time :D) enjoy :).
“Yeah, I know, I didn’t advocate this…” Bruce told him when he realised he was paying attention. Clearly his expression was telling the doctor all he needed to know.
"You woke up once in the middle but It didn't take long for you to get off to sleep again, think you might have been dreaming. You okay?" He checked, resisting the urge to stroke down his chest, friends didn't do that.
Not that any of that mattered when in an alcohol induced oblivion, spending no time outside of the workshop, aggravating JARVIS enough to give the good Captain the secondary access code. Said Captain turned up like a knight in shining red, white and blue at the beginning of week four to pull him out of his pit of despair and haul him into his giant shower, letting the cold water run over him and shock his system enough to make him clean up and go to bed.
"I got some last night, but it wasn't very good. Maybe two or three hours but I woke up a few times cause of nightmares, last time I slept without dreaming was last week when I collapsed of exhaustion." He said quickly, probably hoping Tony would miss the bit on information. Unfortunately for Steve, Tony was paying full attention.
“Alright, sharp scratch” he warned, expertly sliding the needle into the skin and securing it, collecting blood in phials first before attaching the first of the fluid bags. Then, after disposing the needle in the big yellow box, he got the large syringe of antibiotics, attached a needle to the end and injected it into the bag of nutrients through the second port. He gave it a small shake to mix the solutions then hung it off a stand Natalia had wheeled over.
Steve gave a little wave, reaching to lean his sketchbook by the table so he could admire Tony in a way he'd not had the opportunity to yet.
Quarter of an hour later and they'd got through half the sketches already, so far the Bucky/Winter Soldier pile was the biggest, but the Tony pile was slowly growing. He wanted to keep some of the sketches, they were so special, they were photos that were never captured, moments between friends, wishes that never came true. It made Tony's heart hurt to see some of them, Steve had seen his best friend die once, he didn't want to see it every time he saw a damn sketch.
Her words had the desired effect on Bucky, his head tilted as new images flashed before his eyes, a training room, accommodation that was more like a prison cell, working in the field, the frozen wastelands of Russia that never affected him. Hand to hand combat with the petite redhead and losing for the first time.
Soon after, Bucky felt the coolness of the ice chips against his lips, felt them melting and wetting them. He opened his mouth a little for more. They melted slowly and trickled to the back of his throat, encouraging him to swallow. He felt as the water travelled down into his stomach, the cool sensation following. It was the most pleasant sensation he could remember experiencing. He accepted the ice for as long as it was offered, feeling himself become more aware with every chip swallowed.
Bucky saw Stark stalk over to him, a knife in his trembling hand. The assassin raised his chin, allowing the smaller man room to press the shining blade against his jugular. He wasn't sure if Stark knew what he was doing...but if he did then Bucky was thankful to be alive.
"Test." Tony instructed. After the first couple of times where something ended up broken, they always tested it against Steve, he often ended up pulling very hard and coming free from the restraints, which really defeated the purpose. Steve took a deep breath, grasping the bar for leverage and began pulling. After 30 seconds he stopped: nothing bent or broken, perfect. Tony let out a triumphant little giggle before moving down to tie his ankles up, instructing him to do the same, it gained the same result and Tony literally clapped with joy.
"The KGB should have used these piece of shit films as a form of torture, playing the same goddamned scene on repeat. Sam, I hold genuine sympathy for you." Natasha said in disbelief.
“Uh huh, and roughly how long will that take? Because I don’t know how long we can keep this hidden from Steve.” That was the guy from before, the one who sat in weird places.
"Okay, we’re almost done. I’m gonna need you to get out so I can drain the water and then I’ll re-fill it and let you clean your privates. And then I’d like to shave you. You can if you want but it might be hard with one arm" She inquired, helping Bucky stand and climb onto the mat. The filthy water drained quickly and Natalia washed down the bath before starting to fill it again, helping Bucky back in and handing him the washcloth.
"I was curious, wanted to see if you were as good as the stories I heard." Tony explained, paying special attention to the pencil still in his fingers. "Could you maybe draw something for me? So I can see how much I really should have listened to dad?" He asked quietly, Steve would have thought he was joking only Tony was concentrating hard on the pencil, and his voice had been smaller than he'd ever heard it. "Okay." Steve agreed before his brain had chance to think about it and back out.
He looked around and saw the items Clint was holding placed on the desk, when he looked up he saw that Clint was sitting on one of the - Bucky didn't exactly know what it was... It was a tall structure with parts carved out in odd shapes and patterns. Whatever it was, it was an odd place to perch upon, especially with how it wobbled.
With that, Tony left quietly. Fully expecting never to here from Steve Rogers again.
"Sorry, are you alright?" He asked, seeing a bruise begin to form on Clint's jaw where his elbow had struck.
When he woke Steve was gone, but it was still dark. After waiting at least ten minutes and realising that Steve hadn't gone to the loo or something, Tony gingerly sat up, grabbing the two tablets and downing the water. His hangover was bad but not as bad as it could be, for that he was grateful.
Tony clambered to his feet, pressing both hands against the cool metal, focusing the soft fuzzy reflection of his arc reactor. "Steve, are you able to open this door?" He sort of shouted, waiting patiently for a response.
Bucky startled as a disembodied voice echoed through the basement. He clung to the chain at his wrist for no reason other than to have something to hold.
Tony chuckled, untucking his feet and resting them atop Steve's thighs. "Oh really?" He asked, a broad grin on his lips, lighting up his eyes, softening his entire face.
"Yeah... Sure, I can do that..." Tony mumbled, drowsy and not from the alcohol. Mr Sex was only slightly blurry when he re-appeared above Tony, slightly. Just soft around the edges really. Without explanation, the guy gently lifted Tony's shoulders and knelt down behind him, pulling him back to rest against his very solid thighs. The next thing Tony new, he had long fingers carting through his hair, searching his scalp until they came away sticky. They were quickly replaced with a cloth of some sort. Tony didn't care, didn't have the energy to do much else other than sit there and let wonder boy take care of him.
“James, look at me.” Bucky did as he was ordered and realised he was trembling, and not breathing. “You are going to sit in this bath and let me wash you. Do you understand?” She asked. Her words weren’t harsh, not by any means, but they were stern and Bucky found himself instantly calming.
Bucket man scoffed at this, turning and booting the bucket to the other end of a car park. At least that's what it looked like. The small woman simply ignored him and continued her speech.
The assassin jerked into consciousness, grabbing at the chain that held his arm up. His chest rose and fell in hurried breaths, the chain rattling as he tried to keep his balance and get some idea of where he was.
"No really. I live in Malibu. Im here on...work? Maybe, probably, it's not often I show up at meetings but there we go." He mumbled, pushing himself up off the windowsill, taking a second or two to steady himself before walking. The man gave Tony a look that he could only assume meant 'I do not want to feel the hangover you'll have in the morning'.
Once the team was settled, Steve leaning against the corner, Tony's cold toes tucked under his thigh, head resting against Bruce's thigh. Clint and Natasha were sharing the double with Thor, Nat's legs draped over Thor's while her body lay back against Clint's shins, Clint sitting on the arm with his knees pulled up. Sam sat on his own in the single, one leg draped over the arm and the other propped up on the table, a bowl of Doritos resting on the other arm. It was a nice image, cozy, familial. As though they really did belong together.
"I... Er... No, to both." Steve said, shaking his head and blinking a few times to clear the fog preventing coherent thought. That would have been a whole lot easier if Tony wasn't smirking like a smug bastard because he could tell Steve was lying. "I was watching the film..." He stated lamely.
He clung to the soft white t-shirt that was blocking his vision. Huh, when did that happen? Although he didn't really care, Steve was holding him tightly, rubbing his back and muttering apologies in his ear. Not that he had anything to apologise for but oh well, Tony needed the comfort right now. And yes he knew that was selfish but he was known to be self-centred. He did this, he allowed Steve to be on his own, he helped search for Bucky...
of a train on the tracks. Then the shivery sensation of lying in the soft snow. The last softness he could remember before seeing the Captain's eyes.
Only then it happened again.
Maybe she knew Stark better than he did. Bucky swallowed, keeping eye contact to show he wasn't afraid but being sure to remain as still and non-threatening as possible. Oddly, Stark’s manic eyes flicked down the knife, back to his face and down again. He then stumbled a few paces backward with it in his palm, promptly dropping it as though it had burnt him. Horrified, Stark back peddled and left the three alone. Bucky swallowed again, blinking rapidly in an attempt to understand what had happened, coming back to himself and realising what he'd just asked him to do...
Unlike last time, where Tony slowly made his way out and gradually unfolded and let the cool floor draw out the anxiety, Tony more or less launched himself at the Colonel. One hand still tugged at his hair while the the other fisted Rhodey's t-shirt, he'd shocked Rhodey but the man was a Saint so didn't let go, he just tried to pry his hand away from his head.
. After falling to his knees twice, Clint disappeared around a corner and returned with a wheelchair. Reluctantly, Bucky all but fell into the chair, letting his legs relax. As her hands were free, Natalia was the one to push him into the elevator and get him settled, locking the wheels even though the journey would be the smoothest ride of his life.
"Bruce, can I have a word?" Tony called, backing away towards the hall. Tony thought he might actually love Bruce, he didn't ask question, he understood science, and he cared. Not to mention he was a badass Avenger. He felt like he could show himself a little more around Bruce.
Steve lavished Tony's head, licking along the underside, very lightly grazing his teeth over it and licking the slit often, being sure to catch anything Tony leaked. He took more in his mouth and hollowed his cheeks, sucking hard and grinning when Tony moaned loudly. Steve went deeper still, taking a deep breath before swallowing Tony down, his nose brushing the soft hair at the base. Tony whimpered, using his grip to pull Steve off as he didn't want to come just yet.
“Hm, yeah I thought as much… my guess is the dose of antibiotics was too low, the infection got worse. We have protocols in place for if any of us ever lose control… Me, mainly.” He added with a slightly bitter smile. “You passed out again before we even had an opportunity to sedate you. You were brought here and medicated more to fight the infection. That was 4 days ago. You’ve been in Stark tower nearly 6 days.” He stood calmly, waiting for a response.
Bucky frowned, he didn’t remember waking up, the last thing he remembered was Bruce explaining the drugs.
“Ay, there we go, you can hear me.” Clint chirped, giving the hand he was holding another gentle squeeze. “I’m gonna give you some water, alright? I have ice chips, I’m just going to put some in your mouth to melt, it’ll make you feel a lot better.” He reassured.
Once he was fully in, Tony pulled back, giving an experimental thrust to see how Steve was doing. The blonde whimpered and clung to the bars, looking down, Tony saw that he was now fully erect again. Nice to know he had that effect on people. Unlike before, both men were silent, moans contained between them, stolen breaths and heartfelt kisses. After about half an hour of gentle, rolling hips, Tony's thrusts became more erratic, more forceful. Even then things didn't change, their kisses became more a constant brush of lips rather than controlled movements and their breathing became more laboured.
So, hello. I'm sorry, I don't really have an excuse, I'm just a bit rubbish. I hope you like it anyway.
Like Steve.
Bucky’s head had fallen forwards contently, a slight pleased shiver running down his spine as Natalia worked. Was this what it felt like to bathe normally? He couldn’t remember having this before he enlisted.
Almost 2 weeks of no contact had been driving the team mad, it had even irked JARVIS. (
"Hey Steve, long time no see." Sam beamed from his seat at the island, chowing down on a plate full of French pastries. Tony swallowed as he took in the rest of the Avengers gathered in the kitchen. Everyone was there, even Thor (who had dressed down into nothing but pyjama pants covered with mini Molnjr's).
He gasped for breath "So you just want to be friends?" "Shut up Steve". I pushed him against the wall and crouched down. I pulled down his pants and breathed hot air on his boxers. I worked fast, being aware of the short time we had. I pulled down his boxers and freed his erection. He gasped again as I took the tip in between my lips.
I didn't even notice that he disappeared, and came back with a warm towel, he wiped up and threw the towel into the wash basket before snuggling up next to me "Well you did it Cap", he pulled my body into a spooning position "Did what?" "I'm gay". He laughed "I know Tony".
• 7 weeks •
Natasha placed both hands on my shoulders "Tony, focus on me, listen to me, there has to be something, when you were child, something that made you feel safe". I shook my head "Oh for God sake, I know where it is". I opened the wardrobe door, Natasha joined me and smiled as her eyes fell on what I was looking at. Steve was still watching the paramedics treat me.
It felt like hours by the time the door opened and closed again. When we turned around teenage Tony was curled up in a ball in his bed. No one spoke, until Tony did "We better start looking for the stone, check those engenering books, and maybe those photos..." he was breathing fast and almost crying. Natasha and Clint started to look while I wrapped my arms around Tony, he whispered "it's not over yet Steve...I don't know- Steve- I can't-".
The same could not be said about his position as CEO, he went back and forward for six whole months and had not reached any sort of decision. Not even the night before he was leaving.
Natasha and Clint both looked away when Howard started slapping the teenager around. Clint shouted "Jesus christ Stark!". Howard was shouting more, getting more aggressive. Tony's grip tightened on my hand as his teenage terrfied scarems filled the room. Once Howard's trousers hit the ground I turned around. Tony whispered "Bruce said someone has to die, what do you guys define as death" Natasha answered "you're heart stops beating". Clint wasn't saying anything, he was standing with his hands clutched together in front of him.
He sat on the island stool and looked at his phone. Me and Sam watched for his reaction, his smile was as real as I had seen in a long time, "whatcha smiling at Cap?" Sam asked slyly. He put away the phone "nothing, just Maria briefing me for my mission tonight". I smiled "Wow, another lone mission? Do you want me to go with you?". His face dropped, I knew he was lying "No Buck, it's okay, I don't mind doing these little things for Nick, keeps me busy".
Steve's POV
After a minute I let go of her "Are you sure that's what it was?" She sniffled and nodded "I'll show you, come on". She lightly guided my hand and kept it tight behind her. As she pulled me up the stairs a camera flash went off, I'm sure that picture definitely looked like Sharon was my girlfriend. She creaked open the door of Tony's apartment. I felt guilty about this but I had to know if Sharon was telling the truth.
He left after a short while gathering things. I spun on my heel to see Steve smiling, he pulled me as close to his body as possible "I love you too Tony".
Natasha smiled at me "What are you talking about Clint?" I rolled my eyes "I'm talking about you two fucking all night!" Banner jumped in "woah woah woah, that was not us!". Natasha agreed "We heard it too, but we just muted the room".
Pepper dragged me out one morning and made me look presentable. We got into a limo with Natasha's and Bruce. They were going through a rough patch from what Natasha had been telling me. We pulled up at the hotel, there were massive crowds. Before getting out Natasha grabbed my wrist and pulled me back into the car
Tony returns to Wakanda after the snap to meet up with the rest of his team, even Captian Steve Rogers.
He pulled the pillow off the bed and placed it on the sofa. Before he lay down I scoffed "Oh come on Cap, I'm not going to make a man as old as yourself sleep on the caoch". He sat up and looked at me "It's okay Tony, it's still comfier than those army bed!" "Shut up and get your perfect ass over here!".
Clint ruined the silence "I still can't believe you two fucked". I walked away, but I heard Tony "Three times actually" and then he walked out of the freezer and joined me by the wall.
"Anthony!". The teenager took his headphones off but didn't look away from whatever he was fiddling with "Yes Howard?". Clint sniggered "You called your old man by his first name?". Tony didn't answer he was too focused on what was unfolding in front of us. "What the hell is this?" He held up a little plastic bag. "Well Howard I believe that is Marijuana, more commonly known as weed". He slammed the door shut "Don't you dare give me cheek, the maid found this is your English book, just you wait till your mother gets home".
After Clint found out about us we were more careful. I hung around with more women in the public eye and me and Steve had more 'fights'. On the romantic side of things, me and Steve had never been better, he was doing more research into the world of modern sex, after I showed him what a incognito browser is.
A V E N G E R S   F A C I L I T Y
I got up to kiss him but he moved away "We need to talk about this, Steve, last night, it was..." I smiled as wide as I could "It was fantastic Tony!" I couldn't put into words how it made made me feel but his face was stern "It was a teenage fantasy and I was drunk, it didn't mean anything". My heart shattered "I'm sorry what? It didn't mean anything?". He smirked like I was being overdramatic "C'mon Steve, I'm engaged to Pepper, and your straight" I rolled my eyes at him "That didn't bother you last night".
It was awkward for a while after that but eventually, we got a conversation going. The four-hour drive flew by and before we knew it we were pulling up at the venue. It was a massive farmhouse, looked very luxurious, not to mention romantic.
My erection wasn't noticeable anymore so I joined them and sat on the sofa next to Steve. "Why are you guys walking around half naked at two in the morning?". I smirked, knowing full well Peter had no idea what was going on "Kid do you ever read any news?" He shook his head innocently "Why?". I looked at Steve who had a smile and back to Peter "Oh nothing, and we were just going for a swim".
Natasha interrupted "That's sweet boys but we need to get the last stone and we're running out of time.". Tony took a look around "yeah, I remember this, it's my 14th birthday". I laughed "Great Stark, where's the massive party?". he ignored me and went up the stairs.
She cleared her throat, raised her hand to her chin and smiled "Tony, what's that on you neck" my eyes shot to him "A bruise I guess, probably got it on Titan" she hmmed to herself.
They sat down on the sofa, I looked at the two of them "What do you want?". Sam laughed "well Steve, you are dating Tony Stark" I smiled "Yeah, I know". "So we thought you might need a little bit of extra education in a certain area" I rolled my eyes, Bucky took out a DVD and handed it to me, I read it "Fifty shades of grey?". They chuckled, Bucky got up and smacked my bare back "It's not a secret that Tony is into this stuff". They both got up to leave but Sam giggled "I'll need that back though, just in case Bucky ever starts dating Natasha". His face dropped but Sam dragged him away.
We had to wrap up the conversation quickly because the rest of the team came in. Steve sat on the bed with me and Peter sat by my feet, Bruce sat in the chair and Natasha on his lap while Clint and Thor leaned against the wall. I cleared my throat "Hey kid, could you go get me something to eat?" His head perked up "Of course Mr Stark, what would you like?" I smiled "Suprise me".
Shuri was adjusting my new gloves when Tony marched into the lab "Rhodes!". He sped towards him and his fist hit Rhodey right in the eye. Rhodes stumbled back, almost losing his balance "What the hell Tony!". I didn't move at first, no one did, but as Rhodey got back to his feet Tony hit him again. I ran over and grabbed Tony, locking his two arms behind his back "Let me go, Cap!" Rhodes was bleeding now "Tony what's wrong?" Natasha asked, bewildered by what had just happened.
I ordered pizza for us, and turned on whatever weird TV shows were on in the early hours of the morning. "So Kid, what's going on? Why did you really want to stay here". His eyes flinched to Steve but then back to the slice of pizza in his hand "No reason Mr Stark". He didn't trust Steve enough to talk openly in front of him.
The three of us all stood, with space to spare and Peter looked around, Tony was right, there were at least ten, if not fifteen, top of the line suits hanging up, "I can't believe you didn't know about this! Did you even get Friday to go through your room with you?" "Um no, I skipped that".
6 days. That didn’t seem right. He’d lost so much time in his life, and
But of course a Stark could never be so lucky, he realised too late that Pepper was his one good thing. He'd fucked that up, what hopes did he have with a Super Soldier?
damage.
Bucky glared up at him with malice and only just managed not to growl at him. Only he was allowed to call him Stevie, no one else.
thought Steve, tilting his head in the hopes of hearing better. Seeing he had stopped, Tony turns and gives Steve an impatient look, it quickly switching to confusion when he sees Steve's face.
It was gone in a blink and Bucky suddenly wasn’t sure how much he could trust the doctor.
“Thank you…” he croaked, pushing himself very slowly to sit up, breathing heavily with the effort. It was exhausting just to get himself upright. He didn’t remember it being that hard. “Who was here, before, the man with the soft voice…?” he asked, frowning and scratching at his stubble.
"Im..." Tony paused, he was surprised Mr Greek God hadn't recognised him, most people did these days. Deciding it would be best for the both of them if he remained a random stranger. "Very attracted to you..." He slurred, clambering to his feet as un-gracefully as humanly possible, perching on the sill of the still open window so he didn't fall flat on his face again.
Steve began to motion with his hands, giving a general A4 size. "It's about this big, leather binding, it's rough around the edges, rough texture, dark brown, there's some paper and maybe a few pictures hanging out. I need it back, there's sketches of my mother in there, my past." He explained, feeling himself get agitated again.
The more Steve watched Tony the more he realised that drawing him may not have been as easy as he'd first thought. Especially with the way he was focussed on the film, it giving him an intellectual look that was so very slightly different from that of his everyday concentration; more relaxed. Unlike when he worked on his numerous projects; the times Steve had seen him work, Tony had looked tense and wound tight. The small crease between his brows often betrayed the blatant disinterest that occupied the rest of his face.
"Yes, okay. You go Tony, please grab something to eat first. If not for you, for Steve. You can't tell him to eat and then not eat yourself." Bruce always had a way of getting Tony to do things, usually centred around him agreeing to do something Tony wanted - a compromise.
Steve began to creep forward, holding his hand back to signal 'wait' when he heard Tony follow his movement. There were still a good 25 metres between them but Steve daren't run incase Bucky fled. Instantly Steve could see the difference the fall of hydra, who had needed to keep him healthy and strong, had done to his best friend. The last time they'd clapped eyes on each other, Bucky had been fuller, his shoulders strong, jaw tense but cheeks fuller than the sunken shadows that now occupied his face. Now the assassin was shrouded in light, Steve could see bones. Even through the hoody that, thanks to the rain, clung to his body. At this angle Steve could see his back and one side, Bucky holding his left arm to his chest made it easier for Steve to see the ribs protruding, his shoulder blades sharp in contrast to the smoothness of his back, the only place Steve couldn't distinguish the joints.
"I used to have asthma attacks when I was younger." Steve started, his voice rough and husky from crying. "Buck- he... Um- Bucky used to hold me in a similar way to help me regulate my breathing. I learned how to do it on my own and he knew that I could but he was always there, my hand against his chest, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Always telling me how great I was doing, and that I'd be okay and not to be scared. What you did reminded me of it and I guess I've bottled things up again. I feel better now." He admitted, being able to talk more freely once he'd cleared the first hurdle. That was how it had become with Tony though: easy. Like talking to one of the commando's, nearly like talking to Bucky.
"Mr Stark? Are you - oh crap. Come on Mr Stark you aren't there anymore, you broke into my apartment remember? Now you're laying on my lap with a bump to the head, it's okay. Im here to help you, I'm not going to hurt you." Steves strong voice filtered through the haze and fixed the chaos in Tony's mind.
“-looks of it, the arm is infected around the plates. He has a fever of 103, I wouldn’t be surprised if its nearing on a systemic infection. It will have been messing with him for ages, with his weight I’m honestly surprised it took so long for him to pass out.”
"Everything okay?" Steve asked when Tony returned, picking up the last pile and beginning to sort through them.
Now he was running.
"Stevie," he whispered, pained and guilty.
"Steve?" There was his name again, on Tony's lips. Steve had been so blind-sighted by Bucky that he had forgotten the man behind their recent success, the one who held him through the sobs that shook through him earlier that morning.
It was real! Steve was alive! And communicating with him! With Tony. When he hadn't with anyone else. Tony laughed joyously, a hysterical giggle two octaves too high.
The cryo-tube was
"I nibbled...." Steve muttered resentfully, allowing Tony to pull him up out of bed. "Tony please, it's not an issue." He whined, doing his best to dig his heels in and making things harder. Tony halted the progress he'd made in pulling the captain by abruptly stopping and coming face-to-chin with Steve.
Before Steve knew it, the film was over and his pencil had not connected with the paper once. The whole hour and a half had been spent watching Tony watch Twilight. Who, by the way, was paying far too much attention to it for a man who believes it to be a crap film.
, thought Tony, if he was gonna climb in the wrong apartment it was gonna be that of a super-duper kind guy.
He frowned at her and pulled his leg back, the bottom part of his jean soaked with warm water.
are always going to be the god damned Winter Soldier who failed his mission. I don't know how you survived falling from the train but I'm going to do everything in my power to keep you away from Steve. I won't let you hurt him again. Not while I'm still breathing,"
"Too late Mr Stark. I already recognised you-" oh shit yeah, he'd forgotten, "-you didn't really explain why you were hidin' though." He continued, hints of a Brooklyn accent creeping through.
"No, Tony please calm down, none of this was your fault." Had he been talking out loud?
"Ohh fuck!! Please sir, please let me come! I need it." Steve begged, his hips tensing and arching into nothing. Tony snickered, leaning forward and letting his breath tickle Steve's head. He heard a small clatter and then felt Tony's fingers slide inside him. He realised that Tony had discarded the toy, preferring it to be a little more natural. He felt Tony graze his prostate and bring him to the edge again, making him tense and hold on despite what Tony said.
"Green." Steve assured, wandering what he planned to do with the flannel, he would ask but that wasn't his place, he answered questions, never asked outright.
The next alley was empty. Empty and quiet, blissfully so. Steve dropped to his knees as tears filled his eyes, trickling down and mingling with the rain pouring down his face. He'd been given one opportunity and he'd blown it, he would never get Bucky back now, never be able to save him from the horrors he's facing. Bucky would surely be dead in a month if he didn't get food or water, the serum only went so far, and Steve was pretty sure Bucky didn't have the same as his own.
"I'm okay with coffee..." He mused, remembering the times when he'd watched Steve running from the little cafe, sipping on steaming black coffee.
“Yeah, I know. I was squatting in a derelict bar, or restaurant, not sure which. I had some files, they’re probably useful to you all. Oh, the red book too, Stark might have particular interest in that…” he turned back around, looking at Bruce again. “A cat adopted me, she’s white under the dirt. Called Alpine. I hope she’s still there…” he gave Bruce a small smile, hoping it made him seem less intimidating. “Place called… Pinocchio’s, I think it was called, had wood nailed on the windows, smelled a bit… smoky.”
Knowing he'd probably outstayed his welcome, Tony gathered the things he could find. His shoes for one, which were set neatly with the others by the front door. After a few moment consideration, Tony grabbed an envelope and scribbled his number down, wanting to thank the guy properly when he was at least mostly sober. He also left a $100 bill just in case he'd done any
So, the room he was in. There was what looked like an incline out of the basement. There were twenty cars of various design, worth and condition with room for approximately five more. Originally, Bucky had assumed car park but given twelve of the number plates held some variations of the name
... His old home. It had been about a year and a half since Steve (and 6 months for Bucky, since his super generous boyfriend decided Bucky could live in the tower with minimal rent and free food) had been here and it felt so unfamiliar even in that relatively short time...
“It’s Tony Stark, you think he’s gonna make it obvious that there’s cameras? I wouldn’t worry, he’s not watching. Others are, though. Steve is.” Bruce told him without any warning.
"Thank you..." He whispered, not being capable to do anything louder. As Steve pulled the rucksack over his shoulder, his sleep shirt rose and Tony couldn't help himself. He could see where the muscles shape a 'V' pointing down to his groin, a small trail of darker hair leading from his belly button down into pyjama pants. Acting on impulse, Tony pressed a kiss to one hip.
"Nat, are you feeling okay?" Clint asked seriously, placing a palm over her forehead. It immediately getting slapped away. "Jarvis, make sure that's recorded so Sam can hear it again whenever he wants." He continued with a laugh, rubbing his hand affectionally over Natasha's shoulder, kissing her temple. Sam raised his beer bottle in thanks, a subtle appreciation for the sentiment.
He could remember very little of young Bucky, with bright blue, shining eyes too big for his head, soft brown hair that was just too long and tickled his nose when it fell in front of his eyes, the brightest smile in Brooklyn, or so he'd been told by his mother. He had more memories of the soldier, Sergeant James Barnes; cap tilted to one side, lucky with the dame's, glimpses of a skinny best friend he couldn't protect from across the pond. Then dead Bucky, at least that's how he'd wanted to be lying in the freezing lab, syringes had never been his favourite. He was glad he couldn’t remember the fall just yet, but he knew it happened. He read as much in the museum exhibit, every so often he thought he heard the
“It’s a large quantity of fluid going into you, so it will have to be done slowly to make sure your body absorbs it in the right way. You seem ready to pass out again so fingers crossed you’ll sleep through it and the medicine can do its job.” He told him gently, reaching for his arm and looking for good veins. When he had one found, he kept an eye on it as he cleaned his hands with antibacterial gel, collected the right tubes, tourniquet and the canula.
“I’m using shower gel, James. It’s a modern soap, it lathers quicker, smells nicer too” Natalia told him. He hadn’t even asked but she seemed to sense his question regardless. He started to relax again after that, letting Natalia’s nimble fingers work at his muscles and wash away the tension. She moved most of the way down his back and even past the water line.
“I need you to come close to the edge of the tub, make sure you face is not over the water.” Natalia instructed softly. Bucky did so and tried to figure out what was in her hands. She had plugged it in to an output in the wall and placed a towel over the mat. When she pressed a button on the device it whirred to life and sounded as though it was vibrating. James shot back instantly, hitting his head on the wall and making water slosh around.
Tony wandered what an earth could have happened but he didn't push. "I would ask why but I don't think now is the best time. Have you got any paper clips or folders or something?" He asked, looking around and realising he'd only been in Steve's places few times, he'd always come to Tony.
Everything in the tower had been running smoothly and with nary a hitch; any time they were called out the worked as a team efficiently and quickly to reduce damage. Movie nights and team bonding activities became a regular occurrence, they even went bowling once (that had been so much fun for the paparazzi.)
to tell me, understand?" Tony cautioned, stoking up and down the backs on Steve's thighs, thumbs brushing the plug and nudging it every time, making Steve twitch.
"It's 'Paris', Thor..." Clint corrected, picking another pan au chocolate out of the box.
"Steve, please can I see it?" He whined, crawling back onto the sofa with very little dignity.
"I'm... John Smith." Tony lied, using a popular pseudonym from one of his favourite TV shows.
"Somebody's eager..." Tony cooed, pressing a palm against a very muscular chest and finding a very racy heart.
"Okay, not the best way to break the news." Tony muttered to himself, pressing Steve's palm against his chest and trapping it with his own, fingertips covering the arc reactor. "Steve, you need to breath. Follow me, come on. Deep breath in, through your nose... there we go... Slooooowly out through your mouth... And again, we're getting there." Steve tried his hardest to follow Tony's breathing, but he was struggling to take a whole breath in without it rushing out again. He looked up at Tony with fear filled eyes, it wasn't as of this was the first time he'd had a panic attack, he'd had asthma for Christ sake. Bucky used to do something similar when they were kids; getting Steve to mimic his breathing until he calmed enough to control it on his own.
The rest of the place was like an average basement, albeit an oversized basement; minimal lighting, the smell of fuel and fumes, some tyre tracks littered the floor and the ceiling had the odd crack. But there was nothing obviously threatening that gave Bucky reason to be concerned.
Tony smiled, sitting up and throwing the duvet off his very warm, still jean clad legs. "Breakfast?-ish. Brunch. Pancakes?" He asked, bending his knees and stretching them out. He watched Steve shake his head and rest a hand over his stomach. The top that was once very tight fitting now had room to spare, Steve's ribs just making an appearance. Tony hoped that 4 times times the metabolism meant 4 times less work to re-build the muscle.
I sighed, "What do you want?" "I want you to break Steve's heart" "No!" "Well then my lawyers will be here in the morning to take half of-" "Oh my God, you want the company" she laughed "No, I want the Avengers, and I'm entitled to half of them". I poured myself a drink "Why?" Just before leaving she smiled "To destroy them".
Next we provoked Steve "Come on Steve!". He just sat with a stirn look on his face "I'll be honest, after Pepper left, I was pretty down, and things happened". Tony pulled the t-shirt off Steve's body and turned him around so we could all see the deep red lines on his back "Happy now? Cap and I fucked, one time, it doesn't mean anything, it's just one of those things, like how Clint and Natasha hooked up" I stood up "Before I was with Laura!" He rolled his eyes "but seriously guys, this is a secrete, it stays between us, and if any of you leek it I will shut you down".
"I don't know MJ it's not opening" I folded my lips in and closed my eyes, hoping that they would go away. "Peter I need my case". I looked over and seen their bags and mumbled "Sorry babe" I planted a kiss on his cheek and opened the door. "Sorry kids". We stepped out of the limo and walked off without any explanation.
The pressure that was on my gash faded, I looked up and was faced with the saddest face I had ever seen on Steve, the beard pulled on my heartstrings. "Sorry...I didn't mean that. Where is he anyway..." I couldn't bring myself to say his name but Steve just looked away from me "Steve, where's Bucky?".
Wanda came in with some clothes, I stood up and took them off her. "Seriously Wanda, I told you there is no need for you to do all this". I put the pile onto my bed, she smiled "I like helping out around here" I smiled back at her and turned my eyes back to the pages "If that's the case, could you fix me up a coffee?" "Of course". She went over to the coffee machine and pressed the buttons.
I walked outside and sat down on the swinging bench. I brought my hand up to my chin and zoned out. I was lost in my own thoughts when the bench swayed, I turned my head and Steve was sitting next to me with a caring smile. I moved under his arm and buried my face into his chest. He slowly stroked my hair. "Do you want to take a walk, Tony?" I lifted my head "yeah...okay".
He snuggled in behind me in my bed and kissed my cheek, "Should we tell the team" I was already starting to fall asleep "Not yet, I'm just not ready yet". "That's okay". His griped on my waist made me feel safe, and it didn't take long to drift off to sleep.
He began to read me the sports headlines, I groaned "Get to the business news already, or lifestyle, or anything else". He tapped the screen "When will Tony Stark return as acting CEO of Stark industries" I laughed "Next" "Tony Stark spotted with yet another girl, and three explanation marks, and a photo of you and some blonde girl" "That's Alisha, she was a student at MIT, I paid for her project development and now I want to but shares in her company". Steve nodded  and swiped to the next story "Mr Rhodes and his future Mrs set wedding date-".
We both started to get dressed and continued to argue "I'm not gay Cap" "Well Tony you had some pretty gay sex with me last night". I was being a bit to load, he whispered: "And that's all it was, sex, meaningless sex".
I opened my eyes to a bright light, I looked around and seen Steve, Natasha, Clint, Bruce and Thor. We all got to our feet. I looked around "Any of you guys know where we are?". Thor picked up his new axe "It's Asgard". Natasha's voice had a hint of fear in it, something I had never heard before "Thor what are we about to face?". "I don't know my frieneds but we must start looking for the stone".
I was walking down a massive hall with Bruce, he was being kind of odd with me. "So, you and Rogers are you two are good again?" "Yeah we're good, the team needs him and I'll denie it if you ever quote me, but I need him too" his tone was flat "Good, good, any ideas on what to do?".
Not that Steve minded anymore, it was sort of a compliment and he had grown accustomed to his and Tony's back and forth comments. Now though, Steve and Tony were the only ones left on the plush sofa, Bruce's thigh replaced by a cushion for Tony to rest on. He vaguely remembered the team getting up and leaving, claiming a need for more 'sweet sustenance'. At least that's what Thor boomed on his way to the kitchenette.
"My sketchbook, I can't find it! I had it yesterday! I put it on the table and it's not here!" He said, hands skimming over the cluttered contents of the table, lifting more boxes and books, still not finding his most private possession, it was almost like a diary, there were sketches of people in there he didn't want others finding out about.
“Does anywhere hurt?” She questioned, asking him to turn and face her so she could work on his chest. He shook his head slowly. A lot did hurt but if he admitted it then it would have to be fixed. And that usually meant more pain. Truthfully, his arm was starting to get a bit sore beneath the bandaging. He could remember it bleeding before he passed out but after that it was a bit of a blur.
"They won't stop..." Steve's hushed, rough voice spoke once the bowl was nearly empty. Tony recoiled, even when soothed Steve's voice clearly hadn't been used for anything other than screaming in a long time. Tony couldn't hold it in any longer, the tears finally escaped their confines. He curled himself back into the comfort of the sofa, crinkling multiple sheets of paper. Tony had no idea what to do, he just knew he had to do it. For Steve, for the team, for himself, for Bucky, for Peggy, for Howard, for Erskine, for anyone who ever believed in Steve. He had to do it.
"Malibu." Tony answered abruptly, which wasn't exactly a lie, he just wasn't currently living there...
Steve looked around, apparently confused as to where he was, now more awake. "I, yeah. I don't remember dreaming..." He said in such a way that made Tony's heart hurt, it suggested that Steve didn't remember a time where he didn't have nightmares.
Tony started by making an 8 Gb iPod classic a 200 Gb storage capacity. He then put a large selection of songs and artists from each genre, putting them in playlists based on decades, with two others labeled: 'Tony's faves' and 'Recommended'.
Steve heard shifting, the sound of clothes, or something similar anyway. He turned and ran in the direction, checking each ally only to be bombarded by more noise: foxes in bins, music from clubs, the harsh moans of someone being pounded against a wall, laughter, his own feet against the ground, someone calling his name...
The last thing he heard before fully dropping off was Natalia telling him “I’ll be here when you wake, James.”
Once Steve was safely out of view, Tony took a proper look at the room, designs and blueprints running through the back of his mind. If he could get Steve onto another floor he could call his R&D team in the morning and set them to work, his main priority was Steve though, JARVIS could wait if there was nothing there for him to monitor.
But Steve wasn't here.
"Just follow me, you'll recognise it soon enough." He jittered, almost bubbling with excitement. It was hard for Steve not to follow what with the grip Tony had on his hand, walking faster and pulling a slightly resisting Steve along with him. It was a beautiful summers afternoon, warm enough just to be in shorts and a t-shirt but with a slight breeze so it wasn't stifling and sweaty. Steve loved these kinds of days, a deep plunge into icy waters and hypothermia with a near death experience can make anyone hate the cold.
It wasn't as if drawing Tony would be hard for Steve, he was an attractive man who was both smooth curves and sharp angles all at the same time. His jaw was defined by his van dyke, lips a deep pink than contrasted the chocolate brown of his hair. His cheeks rounder and fuller than Steve's, more rounded yet still prominent. His long eyelashes widened his eyes and occasionally gave him a childlike appearance, an innocence that he'd never imagined a Stark could pull off, certainly not one Steve could achieve.
That wasn't what was holding the soldiers attention, though. Eyes as grey as the cloud above locked onto his when the figures head snapped round. Wide and blown as a deer's caught in the headlights - frozen and frightened. So very terrified. A fear that was so palpable it made Steve falter, torn between running after his best friend - or turning and bolting, crushing weeks or hard work and effort, creating many more now that the assassin knew he'd been followed.
"God... I'm sorry. You probably didn't need this tonight..." Tony said glumly, letting Steve sit him on the lid of the toilet. He felt a little drowsy and light-headed from both the blood loss and the alcohol.
"Aahhhh, sir I can't hold it much longer!" He warned, shaking his head from side to side when Tony began to stroke him, running his thumb over the head every time. In response, Tony pushed the massager into his prostate even more, making tears sting his covered eyes.
Steve watched Tony as he span in his chair, standing and walking towards Steve, sketchbook held in front of him. It was all Steve could do not to snatch it from his grasp and hold it close.
be safe for him.
Into a cell. A glass cell in the middle of a room with various people on the outside, some he didn’t recognise, one he did. His hackles rose and he heard the monitor beside his bed begin to alarm. He was so startled by it that he forgot to be terrified of the situation.
When he woke, he’d been moved.
Finally Tony's eyes completed his survey of the room and fell back to Steve. The man himself was hardly visible, he hadn't been eating or sleeping and his skin had a grey tint that made him look ghostly. His cheeks held less, but also more, definition. From what he could see, Tony was willing to bet Steve had lost a lot of muscle. His eyes were the worst, hollow. Yet full of anguish and shame and fear.
He currently had three different chains of thought in his head, each equally as confusing as the other. On the one hand, he had young Bucky Barns telling him that it wasn’t polite to be naked in front of a dame in such a way, especially one he wasn’t romantically involved with. Then somewhere down the line he had flickers of nights spent together with the Widow, of soft supple limbs coming together with his larger, more solid ones, of heated passion that was made better by the fact that it was forbidden. So, had they been romantically involved? Was this normal for them? The overruling thought, however, was of the cold asset, the trigger of a gun, the shell of a man who had no concept of modesty because he had no need of it.
“His serum isn’t quite as polished as Steve’s. Do you think it can be fixed?”
"Ahh, fuck! Oh my god!" Steve cried, his body pulling taut on all the bindings. Tony laughed, obviously pleased a the results. He then began to move it, pulling in and pressing down, rubbing and circling, generally just toying. Steve squirmed around on the bed, the restraints clashing against the metal making a vague rattling sound. He soon became a mess of moans and whines, laboured breathing with a few 'please sir's and expletives thrown in.
Half way into the second film and Steve had the foundations of his sketch. Tony's eyes were bright despite them being the most shaded area, his hair was that kind of messy that normal people styled, Tony's just grew that way.
"Steve, was it something I said? I didn't mean to blurt it out like that, it was gonna have way more tact than that..." Tony proclaimed, reaching a hand forward to flatten Steve's hair, his fingers carting through the thick mass of gold. Instinctually, Steve leaned into the touch, craving it now more than ever.
"Shouldn't be too much longer, ask again once the next films done." He suggested, managing to get a grateful smile from Tony.
To his left was the closest wall, furthest from the drivers exit, closest to the entrance, it was about ten metres away. The wall had a tap jutting out with a drain beneath it, there were a few sponges in a basket to the right and a random set of tools to the left. He could even see a hose poking out behind a plank of wood leant against the wall, he hoped to god they didn't use it on him. He had a brief few seconds where his vision was clouded by the mask they used, the feeling of pressurised water knocking the air out of his lungs, the stones cutting into his flesh.
