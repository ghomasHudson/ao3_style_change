Steve nodded, his face making an interesting attempt to blush while trying to retain the serious mask he was already reforming. Steve backed up slowly but still ran into the wall instead of the door. He stumbled a bit before turning around and leaving reluctantly.
Steve glared at him before exhaling pointedly.
"Go on. Have fun. The little runt and I will lay siege to the neighbors while you're gone." Stated Thor proudly.
"What about Sarah?" Steve finally voiced quietly. "After my mom?"
Steve’s face fell into a serious mask that Tony worried he would soon become familiar with. “I’ll be right there, Jimmy. Go tell my brother where I have gone and to meet me there if he could.”
Tony wondered how the vaguely sweet dried fruit with red edges would taste with some warm honey. Tony had always had a stronger affection for the sweat topping than was probably healthy. His father said it was a weakness to be ashamed of, but Jarvis had always indulged him. He would have to bring some back once they reclaimed his homeland, his city.
“I’m alive.” Tony whispered so harshly that one would suspect the words of betraying him in the worst possible way.
"So, why exactly didn't you contact me before you came barreling over here?" Steve countered.
Tony had pouted for days at the perceived suggestion that his security system, which he had just finished thoroughly updating at the time, was inadequate to protect his new baby son. Steve had, as of yet, not succeed in convincing his partner to take them up on the offer.
“The owld man.” Sarah cried, burying her face in her father’s chest just like she had done her Uncle’s.
Steve furrowed his eyebrows at his lovers suddenly serious look.
Peter started whimpering and Steve swiftly escaped Tony's hold and practically sprinted towards their son. Before Thor could react, Steve had removed the now crying Peter from his grasp and was clutching the baby tightly.
“Bull shit!” Tony practically yelled, poking Steve harder this time with each word.
Steve picked up the satchel and held it out to Tony with both hands. Tony hastily placed his own goblet aside and reached out to take the bag from his betrothed. He carefully untied the straps securing it and reached inside. His fingers brushed against cold metal. He gently pulled the item out of the bag and into the fire light. It was a thin gold necklace no thicker than his fingers. It appeared to be made of several twisted pieces of metal made into some form of braid and each end flared out into a smooth flat circle.
over besides the door as well. Tony looked back at it hopefully. He wondered if his betrothed would allow him to work in his smithy. It was hardly usual for an omega to work in such a field, but Tony could hope that his new husband would be as open minded as his continental relatives had been and allow it. Tony put that worry aside for later. The next trunk held Tony’s books and notebooks filled with calculations and notes on his inventions. He pushed it over to sit besides Steve’s desk.
Tony mumbled his reply into the fabric of Steve’s shirt. The blonde pulled one of Tony’s hands up to kiss his knuckles affectionately as he finished cooking whatever it was he was making, obviously taking the grunting noise Tony made as the response it was. Tony closed his eyes and let the world pass him by until Steve shifted in warning, his cooking completed and the scrambled eggs he had been making neatly plaited for the team. Tony pulled back just enough for Steve to turn in his hold.
Steve had never been what you would call gregarious, but he never had a hard time expressing himself, at least not before the serum. He was sensitive by nature, as good with words as he was with his drawing pencils. His mother liked to say he wore his heart on his sleeve. Bucky, out of a desire to keep his best pal from getting beat up, would just shake his head and murmur, “You got a lousy poker face, Steve.”
“He’s fine,” Steve says reading his mind. “He just woke up and wanted to see you.”
He braces himself for questions about what Peter may have overheard about the quantum tunnel, about what it might mean for him, about why they would send him in alone.
Tony’s tempted to toss off a one-liner, something to break the tension, but he just squeezes the inside Steve’s thigh before moving away. “Anytime,” he says. He wipes his hands quickly on a towel, hoping Steve doesn't notice the uncomfortable tightness in his own pants. This isn’t something he wants to get hard from, far from it, but the noises Steve made, the trusting way he’d responded to Tony’s hand, make his stomach tighten.
“You’re doing so good Steve, you’re perfect, just like this,” Tony says. “Come on, baby, that’s it. Come on, make her come.”
“What are you doing here, Tony?” He sounded about as tired as Tony felt.
For anyone else, it would be a cue to leave Steve alone, but Tony’s never known a boundary he didn’t want to leap over. He knocks loudly on the bathroom door, calling Steve’s name until he hears a muffled “What!”
The evening was long, seemingly interminable,  but he took comfort in the fact that, even has people began to get up and move around, Steve never strayed too far from his side. They stayed long enough to be polite, talking and laughing and posing for photos, but when Steve turned to him and sighed, “I’m tired,” Tony squeezed his hand and lead him back home.
Bruce taps his fingers against his empty coffee cup.“The numbers are the same,” he says.
This time, they do bedtime properly.
“It’s a great idea actually, and something you’re going to enjoy.  Plus, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.”
“Are we?” He looked at Steve, in a different pair of pajama pants and another soft, cotton t-shirt. This one, Tony realized with a pang, bore the logo of Peter’s high school, Midtown Science and Tech.
Tony loves Peter, has cared for him ever since he walked into their apartment in Queens and spit nut loaf out into a napkin. What he never saw though, was how he wasn’t the only one. He looks at Peter’s drawings and thinks about Natasha, who carefully padded Peter’s knees and elbows before letting him jump around the simulation room. Of Scott, who, when they were clamoring all over Tony’s couch, kept a hand at the ready to catch Peter so he wouldn’t crack his head open. Or how Sam, when flying Peter around the room, had kept him steady and supported, so he could feel like he was really soaring. How Bruce and Hope haven’t slept in days, consumed totally with the bringing Peter back. And Steve. Steve who jumped into the water after Peter outside of Manila. Steve who picked out his clothes, who talked to him quietly about nightmares, who rushed across the playground when it looked like Peter might fall. He’s never been alone in this, he realizes with a sharp pang. In taking care of Peter, in loving him, in wanting to keep him safe.
Their report hasn’t spared any details, documenting as much as they could, but there are large swaths of information missing, certain questions that only Steve can answer. With his heart in his throat, Tony makes himself bring it up, the thing he’s been avoiding asking for far too long.
Steve goes white, but his voice stays even. “No, I can’t.”
Steve gave him one of his signature clipped nods before heading back inside, expression as grim as if he were facing down Hydra. Tony had been almost giddy, dumbfounded but pleased at Steve’s compliment before realizing he hadn’t said anything back.
He holds out his hand again. This time, Peter takes it.
Eggs and toast was how everything started with them. After Tony moved back into the compound, breakfast together became a routine and one day that routine turned into something more. It was hard, Steve figured, to have your defenses up before you even had your first cup of coffee.
“Hey, hey it’s OK. I’m here.” Tony smoothes his hands through Peter’s damp hair, shushing him softly. “Peter what happened, it’s OK. You’re OK.”
Peter nods against his chest and Tony knows they have days and days to talk over what happened, what Peter remembers and what he doesn’t.
“I know this is part of the super hero gig, but it shouldn’t be. Not for Peter.” Steve curls closer, pushing his nose into the curve of Tony’s neck. “You mean a lot to him. It would wreck him, if he lost you.”
He stood up from the sofa and stared at him, to see if Steve would break. When he didn’t, Tony moved to get ready for bed.
It’s only when Sam and Nat push their chairs away from the table that Peter jumps out of his lap. He runs over to his little desk, and picks up his stack of drawings.
“When they brought you up, your lungs were so water logged they were worried even your healing ability wouldn’t be enough. Peter’s lips were as blue are your cowl.”
The truth was that all Tony knew about Steve’s past had come from museum exhibits and his father’s papers, an oversight that he was deeply ashamed about now.  He put a hand on Steve’s knee and squeezed it in apology. He left it there until it was time to dress for dinner.
Tony doesn’t take his eyes off Peter. Across the room, Sam and Natasha are letting Peter run between them, practicing take downs and leg sweeps.
but he keeps his eyes locked onto the screen.
Tony has outfitted the suit with enough tech to try to mitigate any potential disaster, but nothing is ever fail safe, no mission is ever totally risk-free. Danger is part of the superhero gig. After all, it wouldn’t be heroic if it wasn’t risky.
“Looking good, kid” Tony says and Peter beams. As they walk off the floor, Tony falls into step beside Steve, waiting till Peter is out of earshot. “You’re good with him too, you know,” he says.  Steve stares at the floor and tries to forget he owes Tony an apology.
“What are the risks?” Steve looks between them. From the living room there’s another burst of laughter as Peter clambers up and over the back of the sofa. With Scott’s help, he goes up, tumbles down and the two repeat the cycle.
In the morning, they fucked slowly, Steve resisting and protesting until Tony convinced him otherwise. They rocked against each other, barely moving while Steve whispered endearments softly against the shell of his ear.  Tony pulled at his waist, dug his fingers into the flesh of Steve’s thigh, worked sharp, wet bruises onto his neck until they were both sweaty and spent, covered in come.
“I’m surprised you guys made it through the first night unscathed,” Natasha said. “My money’s on one of you leaving  after the third night.”
Tony scratches a hand across his beard, takes a deep breath. “Is it a uh, stimulation problem? There are videos on the internet that might help.”
Steve hums his disapproval, but Tony ignores him, lulled by the quiet and warmth. He traces the curve of Steve’s top lip, thinks of all the hesitant, half-steps that he’s taken over the past two days, hedging towards this moment.
He had hoped at first that the situation would sort itself out without the super soldier having to interfere, but alas it had not gone that way. To the contrary, Clint and Natasha were already on the scene but the situation was steadily worsening. They needed Steve and they needed him now.
Tony was just beginning to think that he had let the silence drag on for too long when they entered another hallway and found Steve waiting for them by the door.
“I agree.” Steve stated softly looking over at his sleeping children. “We already have Peter to worry about. I honestly don’t know what I would do if I had to worry about both of my children’s growing abilities and the way people might try to use and manipulate those talents.”
One particularly bad night, Tony’s tossing and turning had woken up Steve. He looked over to find his lover’s face scrunched in pure unadulterated agony. He quickly shook Tony awake hoping to spare his love any more suffering.
Using Tony’s tie to his advantage once again, Steve pulled his partner down on top of him as he collapsed onto the bed making sure that Tony hips landed nicely between his already spread legs. Tony let out a strangled moan at their new position and how incredibly sexy he found the man beneath him.
The caller stepped forward and began to speak, but the king could not hear him. He knew the lines the man spoke, “… King Anthony first of his name…”, but the roar of emotion defend him. It wasn’t until the caller ended his speech by announcing “Sir Steven Rogers, the Shielding Star” that the King became aware of the room again.
“What kind of lesson?” Tony asked, dread fulling up his every pore and his face growing steadily more and more pale.
"Yes Thor. We will get right on that." Tony replied sarcastically.
"So you little tike, what should we do till your parents get back?"
Tony frowned slightly. He had decided long ago that the High King of Ireland was the man he was going to marry, but now that he was here, Tony was having second thoughts. Was he really prepared to do this?
“My Lord Royal Consort, the King has returned and wishes you to join him in the dinning hall for a feast in your honor that has been hosted by the Queen Mother.” The messenger called. “I have been asked to escort you.”
The other Avengers were just as nervous about bringing their baby nephew with them into battle. They had all agreed that Steve would lead from the back this time and the boys had all made a silent vow to get this over with as quickly as possible. Natasha, for her part, had spent a good chunk of time rolling her eyes and bemoaning the stupidity of her male teammates. Don't get her wrong, Natasha was worried for her baby nephew, but she was also worried for the city due to all of the excess damage that was currently being inflicted on it due to the overzealous actions of their "saviors".
“Bucky.” Steven addressed the man, his unbound hand reaching up to clasp the stranger’s shoulder.
Tony sighed, but allowed himself to turn into the soothing feeling of his Fiancé’s fingers brushing over his skin.
Tony reached his arms out towards the blonde and a moment later his husband was curled against him sobbing into his chest.
Steven brought the goblet back up to his lips and quickly finished off the rest of the meed. He reached out and grabbed Tony’s hand again.
Tony felt his heart skip a beat and even more heat pool in his belly. That was kind of hot. Much hotter than Tony expected his eventual Alpha’s possessiveness to be. But, there was something off about Steve’s statement.
There was an awkward silence that fell over them. There was something slithering just beneath the surface between them that needed to be addressed, but neither of them made any effort to do so. It was suddenly a far cry from the welcoming warmth that had flared between them as they dances. The silence stretched over them as they finally made it back to their bedroom door and started to chafe at the edges of Tony’s nerves as they dressed for bed.
He looked up in time to see the little blond girl’s almost four year old brother run into the room with a concerned look on his face that made King T’Challa worry about his dutch nephew and how much stress he was already carrying on his tiny shoulders. The worry, however, melted off of the little brunette at the sight of his Uncle.
“My King.” Pepper said in her native Gaelic. “We are the representatives of Prince Anthony’s household. We honor you as our new King.”
Tony went to the door and entered the hall. He came face to face with a short haired man who was only slightly taller than himself. This face was another of the men he had seen in the group that brought him there.
“Oh please.” Sarah waved away his formality. “You are to marry my son, call me Mom.”
Despite having complete trust in Thor, Steve was currently panicking at the thought of leaving Peter for such a long and in his opinion unnecessary excursion. This night out was going to be the longest period of time that both Steve and Tony had been away from Peter, and Steve was not at all liking the idea of being away from his baby boy for so long.
The first thing they heard was a very loud yell of "Get back here you little devil" from Thor. Then they saw why their friend was yelling. Petter was running at full speed on the roof smashing holes in everything he could reach with Mjolnir, Thor's mighty hammer.
“Excuse you, but I was already a Queen as you so graciously pointed out when you gave me this hoodie.” Tony replied, a smirk playing at his lips.
“My mother was having trouble giving my father children, so when Bucky was born she accepted him with open arms despite the pain it caused her at first, but she quickly came to love him. She raised him as her own and several months later, when she finally fell pregnant with me, she even nursed him at her own breast. She refused to even leave him when she and my father traveled into the mountains when it came time for me to be born.” Steve paused. “Despite that, Bucky and I could both tell that our father’s other marriages, however brief, took a tole on our mother. We both decided we never wanted more than one marriage because of it.”
“But, Peter might!” Steve stated angrily, his signature “Tony stop it now” glare firmly in place.
Steven let go of his hand once they entered. He reached down and unlaced his shoes, depositing them by the entrance flap. Tony followed his lead and started unfastening his own shoes as he watched his betrothed light the fire so that they could see in the dwindling twilight. Steven bent down and quickly got a spark with the flint. He blew hard on the sparking embers and nodded to himself in satisfaction as the fire lit up. Tony watched him walk across their tent to a small table in the corner before sprawling down on the inviting furs. The pelts were just as soft as Tony though they would be.
In their sweep, they found vials of Steve’s blood, discarded needles, and a stock pile of anesthetic chemicals. There were two massive tanks that had once been filled with water, but were now broken open. In a corner, there was a row of scalpels, all in a neat line.
Like the night before, Tony strokes him a few times, using the precome as a little bit of slick, before licking his own palm and setting up a more comfortable rhythm. It’s not fast or torturously slow, and Steve makes abortive little thrusts into his fist, gasping at the feel of Tony’s hand jacking him.
“God, you’re so fucking tight,” Tony says and snaps his hips into Steve with force that makes his cock jump. “Like that, baby?”
“Peter,” he whispers. This time, Peter lets him take him by the shoulders. “You know I can’t promise it’s not going to happen again.” Peter’s face crumbles and Tony’s own voice starts to shake. “I can’t. I want to. Believe me, I want to so badly but I can’t. You know the stakes, you know this is part of the gig.”
“You alright, Rogers?” Tony asked. It felt stupid to check in on him, after all they weren’t on a mission, they weren’t fighting aliens, but he still felt responsible for Steve’s well being, even here. Especially here.
“You’re safe here,” he says, pressing wide parabolas across Steve’s shoulders, hoping to replace pain with something he hopes is comfort. Steve’s body has been made for war, a magnificent tool of violence and carnage. It has been beaten, attacked, experimented on. How many people, Tony wonders, a lump forming in his throat, have touched it with nothing but love and care?
He walked away, leaving Tony alone in the corner, staring blankly at the cold, snowy vastness of the mountains in front of him.  All morning he had tried to push their brief love making out of his mind, but he knew the feel of Steve’s body, of him hard and aching in his hand, would stay with him always. There was only one choice that Tony had in all of this, but rather than run to it, he slipped out a side door and chartered a very last minute, very expensive private plane back to New York.
“Eight days and not a scratch on you. Remarkable. Nothing can hut you, can it? You look like you’re ready to head back out into the field.”
“You spying on me or did you come here to work out?” Steve calls.
The boy eyes Tony wearily, but he doesn’t run. Just shuffles from one bare foot to the other. Tony holds out his hand, but the boy doesn’t move.
“How are you feeling,” Tony asks, his thumb brushing the edge of Steve’s mouth.
Tony watched as they two traded increasingly sloppy kisses, not as confused as he should have been about Steve’s request for him to stay. This was weird, uncharted territory, the evening moving in a direction he hadn’t consciously anticipated, but might have unconscioulsy wanted.
“Steve, with what they put you through. You were held for such a long time. There’s a chance of sexual...”
“Hey, kid, bathtime. Come on.” Tony pushes back his chair as Peter lets out a long groan of protest. He leans over and takes an exaggerated sniff of Peter’s hair. ‘Yep, you smell like stinky socks. Time to hose you down.”
Steve shrugs his shoulders. “Better,” is all he allows.  He keeps his eyes firmly fixed to the TV, even though he knows Tony’s waiting for him to turn around. Eye contact will only lead to more questions, questions Steve doesn’t have it in him to answer.  He slept like shit, vivid psychotropic dreams leaving him more exhausted then rested. It would be easy enough to say
They still argue too much, the two of them, butting heads over policy and procedure even on good days, but things feel different now. It’s not the pettiness of before, when Tony fought back just to fight back. He loves their push and pull now, can see how it’s changing him to his core, and how lost he would be without it.
“You know he’s not OK. What he went through...that kind of trauma doesn’t just leave a person.” Bruce stops, makes Tony look at him. “I don’t remember a lot when I’m the Hulk, but when I come back to being me, I can still sense it. It’s all still inside me, Tony. Just because Steve can’t remember what happened doesn’t mean he can’t still feel it.”
Unable to help himself, Tony places a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “That’s not important right now,” Tony says. “You’re back, Steve. That’s all anyone cares about.” He knows SHIELD will come asking for details, the UN World Council too, but they’ll have to go through him first.
From the stack of clothing Steve’s piled in a corner of Tony’s closet, he pulls out a set of jungle print pajamas and helps Peter change. He stands outside the door while Peter uses the bathroom and then lifts him up so he can wash his hands and brush his teeth. Finally, after a glass of water and a denied request to watch cartoons, Peter crawls into Tony’s bed, clutching the well loved bear. He smashes it into his face, sniffs deeply and squeezes it with all its might.
“They had a model of a QuinJet, but thought I’d switch it up,” Steve says from the kitchen. There are groceries out and Tony has the sneaking suspicion he’s making dinner.
“Peter’s a 17-year-old kid. He can’t just revert back to being baby,” Steve says.
“Boss, it’s Dr. Banner. It sounds urgent.”
“We can’t hold them off any longer, Tony. I don’t want to put him through this either but either we do this our way, or they’re gonna do it their way, and trust me, their way isn’t going to be easy.”
“Mr. Stark, it’s what got him to the state he’s in—” Hope starts but he stops her with a glare.
In the corner, Steve’s asleep on the sofa, Peter sprawled across his chest. The room is heavy with sleep and the sound of their quiet breathing. Tony stands in the doorway, watching the heavy rise of Steve’s chest, the up and down of his arm on Peter’s back, feeling something entirely new yet oddly familiar cement inside of him.
Peter comes willingly when Tony sits down on the floor and holds out a pair of Iron Man underpants. He also consents to squirming into pair of soft gray joggers, but, for the hell of it, makes Tony chase him around the room a few times before wiggling into a t-shirt covered in little red dinosaurs. He pokes at the figures on his chest, mangling pronunciations of tyrannosaurs and stegosaurus and diplodocus. When Tony laughs, he throws his arms around Tony’s neck, going limp until Tony picks him up. He nestles into Tony’s side, listing comfortably as Tony rubs his back. From across the room, Steve stares at them both, a look Tony can’t quite decipher.
There were boundaries between the two of them that didn’t get crossed, and despite the small bed and the cold night, there was a distant, rational part of him that knew this was a bad idea. They were both too volatile, too stubborn, for anything romantic to be a good idea. His brain understood the message well, but in this bed though, curled together in sleep, his body, traitorous and rebellious, had no chance of obeying. As he fell back asleep, Tony tried to direct his fingers to uncurl from around Steve’s waist, but instead they just brushed the bare, soft skin under his shirt.
For once, Tony was grateful for the monotony of policy making. He was adept at this part of the job, knew how to shake hands, work a room, say just enough to make the right people think he was on their side.  Like his father, he knew how to put on a show. Still, it was exhausting. By the time evening rolled around, his head throbbed and jaw ached from smiling so much. After his last meeting, he escaped back to their room, loosened his tie and collapsed on the sofa. He drifted for how long he wasn’t sure. When he opened his eyes again, Steve was bent over the fire place.
“Steve? You OK?”
He lingered in the doorway till Steve stepped aside. The small foyer led to a larger living room connected to a small kitchen, with three large windows along the west side, offering a nice view of downtown D.C.  The place was cozy in a way that the compound would probably never be.  He wasn’t sure how often Steve came back here, but understood why he kept it. It was his place, and his alone. Somewhere free of the Avengers.
“You’re alright,” Tony says softly, and he leans forward, lips grazing the shell of Steve’s ear.
“And whose fault is that again?” Tony glared at the kid, but it had no affect.
Tony wants to pat him down, check him over for scars and breaks, but he sits on his hands instead, watching from the far side of the room. Steve’s stoicism doesn’t sit well with him at the best of times but right now, knowing what he knows, it practically breaks his heart.
Steve had rolled his eyes but stayed put.  Everyone else was ok ignoring Steve’s celibacy, but talking about it had suddenly become Tony’s favorite hobby.
“Nick, do you know what GHB is?” Bruce cuts in, before Tony can snap again.
The mission —if it can even be called that—costs him a few bruised ribs, a gash across his cheek and a suit of armor. By Avengers standards, that’s as close to ‘fine’ as it gets.
Despite his fears to the contrary, Tony has no problems falling asleep.
Tony changes his own clothes but stops short of getting in to bed. In the living room, Steve is still on the sofa, eyes shut. He opens them when he senses Tony hovering.
Peter nods but he doesn’t look convinced and Tony hates seeing his face so somber. A subdued Peter is an unhappy Peter, and that’s never sat will with him, no matter what age Peter is.
He threads their fingers together under the table for a brief moment, before steeling himself back up.
Tony bristles, but Fury’s got a point. He catches Bruce’s eye and nods.
“I know a great spot, if you’re interested,” he said leaning in and taking another sip of his drink. He wore a three piece suit without the jacket, shirt sleeves rolled up.  Steve had caught himself staring more than once at the bare strip of his forearms. “They’re very discreet. The women are wonderful, everyone is safe, it’s really a lovely way to spend the evening.”
“The cleaning staff can do all that,” he says but Steve just shrugs, unable to stand even a little disorder. “He’s fine. Went out like a light.”
“Plus, I’ll go with you, if you want. Make sure everything goes smoothly,” Tony offered far too casually, fixing Steve with a stare. His loose tie and unbuttoned collar gave him the air of a rich lothario, which is exactly what he was.
“You said a bad word,” the kid says.
“Yesterday, he had no idea who May was. Today, he remembers her and his parents. Things are coming back to him.”
“I’m a little busy, Bruce. Unless you’re turning into a big, green stomping machine it can—”
Steve shrugs again. “Kids need clothes, Tony.”
Sam shook his head, clearly not satisfied with Tony’s response.  “Anyone can see something’s going on with you two.”
be enough for Steve. He wants to rip off his shirt and scream to the bloody heavens, but people will stare. He’s sure his face is obvious enough, curse his Irish skin. No one can know. Because he’s wearing his Navy uniform, strutting down the San Francisco streets by Tony Stark’s side.
Thanks again to those who have inspired/re-inspired me. If you could let me know what you think in the comments below I would really appreciate it.
Please let me know what you think so far! <3 Is there anything you would like to see happen or talked about in the story?
They’re discreet and that’s enough for Steve. Well, it
He can’t say he’s not terrified. He feels exposed in his uniform, but there’s an exercise at base he has to sprint to at 3 o’clock sharp. And he can’t stay away, one look from Tony drags him right back to where they started: a shitty motel room, half-drunk and handsy.
Wow, look at that. The last update was in August of last year? I’m so responsible!
God, he’s obvious.
“Back at it, Captain. You haven’t got all day.” He winks, and a laugh bursts suddenly from Steve’s chest. He’s kissing again at Tony’s neck, feeling his partner hum with pleasure and encouragement.
“Fuck,” Tony curses at the site of it, sinking his teeth into Steve’s neck as he trembles and come apart in his arms. He strokes him through the aftershocks, trailing his fingers along Steve’s cock until they’re both spent and collapsed in a sweaty heap on the bed. Tony’s own erection is urgent but he ignores it, letting it rest heavy against the curve of Steve’s ass.
“Feeling alright, buddy?” Tony’s voice is scratchy from sleep, his throat parched.
He’s trying to be brave but Tony can see the uncertainty in his eyes.
The comment stung but Tony only nodded, letting the disappointment build in his chest.  They hadn’t talked about any of this, hadn’t set any boundaries or even any expectations. It was stupid to feel slighted, so Tony gathered up his emotions and locked them up tightly. It was just sex. Which was fine. Just fine.
“Yeah, read it now!” He scrambles down from his chair and up into Steve’s lap. Tony clears the dishes and pours another cup of coffee, listening as Steve beings the tale of a little llama, just waiting, waiting for his mama.
“A couple times a day,” Steve says, his eyes still not meeting Tony’s. “I’ve been ignoring it but now…” he shakes his head, his jaw clenching. “I just need to get rid of it.”
Tony looks at the side of Steve’s face, takes in the creases along his forehead, the crows feet that are just starting to appear at the corner of his eyes, and thinks of what first brought them together. “It’s hard,” he says. “Watching someone you love fight for their life. Especially after you’ve already lost so much.”
“It was cold,” Steve says, his voice low. “And I was,” he frowns, searching his memory. “In the dark maybe? Underground? But it was loud, there were a lot of machines.”
“That last mission, you flew out there solo even though Cap told you to wait for air support! He was screaming at yout to wait and you didn’t listen,” Peter says.
“How’s it going, kid?” Tony strokes his hair, kisses the top of his head. “You have a good day?”
“Are you a cuddler?” Tony directed his question Steve’s back. “I just want to be prepared in case I wake up wrapped up in some kind of tight, super solider embrace that I can’t break out of…”
“Do you think you were you sexually assaulted?”
Somewhere in the afternoon, Tony keeps meaning to go back to the lab to help Bruce but lingers in the apartment with Steve instead. When Peter wakes up from his nap, Tony swipes away what little work he managed to stare at and they tear open a giant LEGO spaceship set.
He nods.
“It makes me feel better,” Peter says. “Maybe if you have bad dreams, Mr. Stark will let you sleep next to him too.”
It’s no one’s fault, Tony knows that, just a consequence of the superhero game, and yet, days later, he still hears Peter’s ragged breathing in his head.
They swapped places 10 minutes later and by the time Steve emerged from his turn in the bathroom, Tony was buried under the covers.
“Yeah,” Tony says, charmed by the bright shade of red Steve is turning. A hint of a genuine smile crosses Steve’s face and Tony’s tempted, briefly, to lean in and kiss him. He doesn’t though, and let’s Steve get on with his morning.
Tony wasn’t in the habit of praying, but he closed his eyes anyway and mumbled a few words approximating faith before plunging his hand into the repurposed candy bowl. He shuffled around the two pieces of paper that were left, mixing them up for far longer than was necessary.
Tony nods, wondering if picking up Peter’s call a few days ago might have changed any of this. “Anything else I need to know?”
“Tony. Tony. Fuck,” Steve’s gasping his name out now, going crazy at the sound of Tony’s voice in his ear, wanting to be touched everywhere by him.  He thrusts harder, Kara’s moans and cries begin to mingle with Tony’s voice, both of them urging him on.
of his fists filling the room. Even without FRIDAY’s assistance, Tony had known this is where he would find him, even at this late hour.
11 minutes pass. 11 agonizing minutes where they try to push the boundaries of quantum mechanics, the radiation and energy signature in the building going up astronomically, until finally, Bruce tries the final sequence, filling the room with light.
Again, this would be a good time for Tony to gracefully make his exit, leave Steve alone to suss out a very private problem, but the tense curve of Steve’s back and his strained voice just pull Tony in closer.
“He’s awake,” he says, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Right now, he’s stable but we’re still running tests.”
Hope hesitates just a second too long. “We can try.”
Steve shakes his head. “Don’t do that. Missions are dangerous, Tony. They always will be.”
“I can feel it though,” he says in rush. “All through my body. Everything inside me feels,” he shakes his head at a loss for words, a tear spilling out of the corner of his eye.
“Oh god.” Tony chuckles and carries Peter back to his bedroom. He wakes a little as Tony puts him under the covers.
“Where—” Tony’s speechless.
“Ummmmm yeah,” he says, dive bombing an action figure into the suds and splashing water all over the floor. Some of it gets on Tony’s t-shirt, in his hair, on his face.
. He should say,
It’s not so terrible, he thinks. If he has to go, at least he’s going surrounded by people he loves.
Peter cries louder—sharp, hysterical sobs piercing the air—as Tony reaches the bed. He throws his arms around Tony’s neck, clutching him tightly.
“Hi,” she said again, smiling wide and bright, like she’d just heard a joke. She was classically beautiful, her dark eyes small but piercing, and if she knew who they were she didn’t let on. Like Tony said, they were very discreet.
“Can we see him?” Natasha asks.
“It wasn’t grandstanding, OK. It was just...research," he said, as they made their way up to their room.
Tony swallows past the sudden tightness in his throat, relief and anger mixing in a ball in his stomach. They had been searching for Steve for over a week, after he’d failed to check in during a routine surveillance mission. For 8 days, they’d crisscrossed the area where Steve’s transponder had last pinged, searching for some sign that he wasn’t dead.
Steve’s a terrible fucking liar, with a terrible fucking poker face. The clench of his jaw is all Tony needs to know it’s bad.
“FRIDAY, set ‘Do Not Disturb’ protocol.”
“That’s it? No other reason?” Steve asked. There was a flicker of hurt across his face and Tony opened his mouth to speak, to try to dissuade Steve of whatever notions he might have. Before he could, Steve cut him off with a wave of his hand. “You know what, never mind. Forget I said anything.” He brushed his hands clear of the dirt from the logs and grabbed his coat from the closet.
They made quick work of their clothes, discarding jackets and shirts and shoes in a rush till they were moving against each other fully naked for the first time. They had full privacy now, there was no danger of anyone walking in on them, but they still didn’t take their time, accustomed to the rapid pace of their usual liaisons. Steve had him laid out on the bed, head bobbing between his legs when Tony tugged at his hair, a warning to pull off.
Bruce is the first to make his way back to Tony’s, Stephen Strange in tow. In his dark jeans and cowl neck sweater Strange has a more grandfatherly than sorcerer vibe. He sits next to Peter, who they’ve managed to subdue with cartoons, and makes complicated motions with his finger tips, streaks of light trailing in his wake.
“More of less, huh?”
“He’ll love it,” Tony says, his face flush with warmth.
“Buddy, how about some underwear?”
“That’s the Quantum Tunnel,” Hope says. “It fired up remotely while Peter was in the room.”
“Don’t lie to me. Even if a clearly fucked up Steve hadn’t come knocking on my door this morning, you’ve been all over him, all weekend. You pick food of his plate, you always sit next to him. You jump if someone tries to touch him. It’s like…”
“I’m fine, Mr. Stark,” Peter says, like he knows what Tony’s thinking.  “We’re gonna get you out of here.”
For a long moment, Tony said nothing.
Steve pulls May into his arms, holding her while Tony stands there helpless, thinking about Manila, how still Peter had been when he came back.
Times were different and men were different now, and the hard set of his jaw sometimes felt like a mask.  The mask was starting to slip off more, but what worried Steve was why he found himself scrambling to keep it on.
Maybe he had anticipated this, even hoped for it, and that’s why he’d lingered in the room for as long as he had. He could tell something was happening here, a cracking open and he didn’t want Steve to be alone.
“It relaxes me,” Steve said. Even though his back was turned, Tony could hear the smile in his voice. He arranged the logs again, poked at the flame that had just began to flicker.  When he was satisfied with it, he came and sat next to Tony on the sofa.
Steve arched up at the touch, pushing his shoulders into the back of the sofa. It was only Tony’s hand on his hip that kept him from thrusting rudely into her mouth. Dropping his head back, Steve tried to control his breathing as Kara moved her mouth slowly up and down his dick, her fingers wrapped around the base. He was desperate to come, a thought that must telegraph through his eyes.
“OK,” Tony mumbles into his mouth. “That’s OK,” He wants to kiss Steve, has wanted to badly for days, but doesn’t take the risk now. He keeps his hand wrapped around Steve’s cock and thumbs lightly at the head. He’s slick with lube and precome and Steve moans for him as Tony jacks him at a more punishing pace. He’s keeping Steve on edge, possibly for a little too long, but it’s imperative for what he’s trying to accomplish. Before Steve can come, he eases off Steve’s dick and reaches between his legs to gently tug at Steve’s balls, making him cry out and snap his hips up.
“What was it you were saying, Minister Ku?” King T’Challa asked in his best diplomatic voice.
“Shhhh. I’m here.” Steve consoled quietly.
As exhausted as he was, Steve decided that he should join his family and surprise his lover and their children when they woke up. After a quick shower to rid himself of all the grime from his travels, Steve carefully slid himself opposite Tony so that their children were tucked safely in between them. It was the most peaceful and contented sleep that either Steve or Tony had ever had, until it was shattered in the wee hours of the morning by their daughter’s crying. Peace was always short lived when two of the most famous super heroes in the world had two kids under five.
“I will teach you.” Steve said. “But only if you teach me about your customs in return.”
“I am sorry to leave you so soon Anthony, but I am feeling unwell. I beg your leave.” Sarah said.
Tony looked down, unable to meet Steve’s eyes any longer, but Steve stopped him. Steve’s fingers lifted Tony’s downturned chin so that he was force to Steve’s eye level.
“It was good. Jarvis was teaching me about how they built the palace today. Did you know there are secret tunnels hidden in the walls.”
Peter had also begun to explore more of his powers and had recently been spending most of his time on the walls and the roof. Which had initially scared Steve to no end until he realized that Peter was in compete control of his powers, which he had possessed since long before his adoption.
Steven’s finger’s brushed Tony’s as he took the goblet and drank. It felt like little bolts of lightning sparked between them when their skin touched. Tony barely noticed the crowd cheering again as Steven looked down on him. The people around them must have gone back to dancing as the noise ramped up again, but to felt like Tony and his new fiancé were in their own world.
“Seriously, have you been camped out here the entire time?”
“Fuck,” Steve says, breath becoming slightly erratic. “Tony just finish it, come on.”
She doesn’t believe it, not until she’s standing in front of a four-year old Peter, who is running around the sofa waving a dish towel in the air. May grills him on everything he knows, which isn’t much, and at the end of their hushed conversation tries to scoop Peter up to take him home. A part of him wants to protest, but she’s right, Tony has no idea how to deal with kids, he’s better off at May’s, with a real parent.
“Well, just trust me when I say there’s more to life than 6am cardio.”
He leans over him, and grabs the bottle of lube from the bedside table, pumping a little on Steve’s abdomen and cock. “We’re getting close, alright, just stay with me,” Tony says. He leans over Steve, and runs a hand through his hair, noticing it’s already damp with sweat.
“Kiss me, please.” Tony’s heart shatters at the request, blinking back tears at the sound of Steve’s voice, wrecked and wounded in a way he’s never heard. Grabbing the back of Steve’s neck Tony smashes their mouths together, trying to fill whatever cracks are breaking Steve apart.
“You should rest,” he says, before dropping his hand. “Peter’s going to need you tomorrow.”
“That’s it,” he whispers in Steve’s ear, nose brushing against the damp hair at the nape of his neck. “You’re doing so good for me, Steve.”
They walk down to the hanger together, Peter holding both their hands and swinging between them. Outside the door, Tony crushes him to his chest.
They both watched her as she undid his pants and pushed them down, Steve staring at his own body like he was outside himself, Tony stupid with lust.  Crouching between his legs, Kara gently palmed his erection through his briefs before pulling back the elastic band and exposing the head.
She keeps gasping Steve’s name as she comes down, her fading orgasm winding its way through her body.  Sated, Kara drifts while Steve lightly licks between her legs. She’s too sensitive now for it to feel good, but she enjoys the softness of Steve’s hair between her fingers and likes the way Tony is staring at Steve, so she lets him stay.
“Do you remember what you dreamt about”
Tony’s close to ripping Ross’ hand away, but Natasha catches his elbow before he can make a scene.
She smiled at them, introduced herself as Kara, and curled up on the other side of Steve.
Tony had never seen him like this before, this undone, and his own breath quickened, his pulse racing at the sight of a clearly turned on Steve Rogers.  Kara tipped her mouth back over his, and pressed him back slightly into the sofa. Tony indulged himself and let his fingers stroke Steve’s chest, brushing against his nipple.
The sight of it makes his cock give a weak twitch, and he knows that if he hadn’t already come twice, he’d get hard again at the sight. Shifting slightly, he runs one shaky hand up along Tony’s covered thigh.
“Dr. Banner! Did it work?” He looks around the room, looks down at his own hands and feet, trying to gauge his size. “Guys, am I supposed to be naked under this suit?”
There are no seismic shifts happening in his bed the next morning. Peter wakes before him again but instead of jumping around like a little rabbit all over Tony’s high thread count sheets, he’s subdued, flying his bear around in a little circle.
He’s been lying in the dirt for a few minutes, possibly less, when Steve’s panicked, pinched face appears above him.
, if not for a cease fire between two warring nations going spectacularly wrong. A tense standoff had ended in the worst possible way, with a radioactive bomb headed towards a city of two million. Iron Man had been called in and the bomb disposed of, but not before Tony exposed himself for far too long to the plutonium core.
“You think that matters?” Sam looked at him intently.  “You caused an international incident because Steve smiled a little too long at a woman, and all this time he’s been watching from the sideline as person after person gets to hang off your arm, while you smile for the cameras. I don’t know what happened last night, but I can guess. He’s hurt, man. He’s really hurt.  And I know it’s your fault.”
“I’m a lot of work Steve,” he said as Steve lot out another soft little moan.
Steve nods, looking a fraction more relaxed. “Thank you,” he mumbles, still a little out of breath.
Tony can’t help but wink. “Don't’ be so sure about that,” he says and Steve blushes. “How are you feeling?” he asks, turning serious again.
He’s tempted to lie there, but there are too many intrusive thoughts for him to rest. He untangles himself from Peter’s grip, and sneaks out of the room. He gets FRIDAY to set the Baby Monitor protocol and heads for the lab. There’s not much they can do with the tunnel, but they can give Peter a suit, like Scott’s, so at least he has a fighting chance.
“You ok?” Tony asks. He takes his sticky hand and places it on the inside of Steve’s thigh, the only point of contact between the two of them.
Even in the dim light, Tony catches Steve’s eyes soften, just a little.
Peter fills up a plastic cup of water and dumps it all over his head, screeching with laughter as the bubbles run into his eyes. He blows a raspberry, spewing dirty bath water out of his mouth. Kids, Tony has learned, are sometimes pretty gross.
“Did you see me? I made it across like, a million times.” His smile is ridiculous, exactly the same one Peter gives him after a successful mission.
After the meeting, Tony stops him in the hallway with a light touch on his wrist. “This is a glorified security escort, Cap,” Tony tells him. “Let Rhody hang back with Carol and the kids.”
Like a good soldier, he attuned himself to her every response, taking note of what made her cry out sharply, what made her sigh, and what made her buck her hips up into his mouth. He experimented with his tongue, pushing into her in little thrusts before clamping down hard on her clit and sucking. He goes fast, slowing down only when Tony places a hand on the back of his head, guiding him to a slower, smoother motion.
“Yes, sir.” Steve squares himself up to military height and gives him a crisp nod.
“It’s not that simple,” he said quietly.
“Is it?” For a long moment, neither of them speak. “Should it be?” Tony asks again and Steve shakes his head, looking again at Peter. There’s no easy answer here, nothing either of them can do but hold the reality they have in their hands.
Steve gasps at the touch, fingers curled so tight Tony worries he’s going to snap the basin.
Steve hovers in the doorway as Tony puts Peter down, making sure to tuck the bear securely under his arm.
“Mr. Stark I ate two bites of food!” Peter announces before taking another mouthful of chicken.
At this point, he was alright with anything. “Yeah,” he nodded, already trying to keep his hips still.
“How many people have you gone out with since you and Pepper broke up?”  Sam held Tony’s gaze, daring him to look away.
Sexual preferences are a unique thing and while Tony has no idea what Steve likes or how he likes it, he’s worked his own dick enough times to know the basic rhythm to these things, that starting slow is better than starting fast, that even a little slickness goes a long way.
“Good question. How are we doing this morning, Peter?”
Breathless and sweaty, Tony collapses forward, touching his forehead to Steve’s, and letting their breath mingle.
Tony winks at him. “When have I done anything stupid. Like I said, I’ll be fine.”
Tony’s just flipping open warm boxes of melted cheese and sauce when FRIDAY interrupts.
The first time felt like a one time thing, not exactly a mistake, but a sudden glitch in their protocols that allowed everything to go haywire before snapping back to normal. But it happens again, this time in the simulation room, after Natasha and Bruce suggest Tony get in some extra hand-to-hand practice. He never enters the field without his suit, but Steve had also insisted, saying it was never a bad thing to learn a few new moves.  Steve had showed him how to get out of a reverse choke hold, flipping them both to the ground. The scenario gave Tony the upper hand, let him pin Steve’s hands above his head. Instead of releasing his grip, Tony rocked his thigh between Steve’s legs and kissed him until he was panting, desperate for air. Like before, he pushed a hand down Steve’s sweatpants, but this time exposed him fully. The cold air hitting his dick made Steve gasp.
“How is he?” Tony asks, still trying to catch his breath.
“I’m sorry, Pete,” Tony says, holding him tightly. “I’m so sorry. I never wanted you to see that.”
“You’re looking at it.”
There’s an unmistakable waiver in Peter’s voice and Tony feels an urge to pat his hand, tell him everything’s going to be fine but the words get stuck in his throat.
“That went south badly,” Steve whispers. He presses a kiss against Tony’s knuckles.
“Actually, I don’t see why you’re taking this so well.” Tony eyed him suspiciously. “I should be the last person you want to share a room with.”
“Feel good?” Tony asks, and gets an affirmative grunt in response. He keeps his hands busy, digging into the slabs of muscle along Steve’s back and shoulders, kneading and pressing into smooth, unmarked flesh, but his mind keeps flashing back to the photos in the report. The ones of overturned medical tables and barbed wire and tough, metal restraints. He doesn’t know details, just that Steve’s body--the beautiful, trembling one under his hands right now--had been torn, cut and lashed at; treated with such inhumanity that makes Tony’s throat close up in rage.
“That I have to babysit you here? Yeah it is.  Come on Rogers, off with the jacket.” He let Tony remove his coat.  Unlike Tony, who’d come dressed in one of his expensive suits, Steve had worn dark slacks and a gray button down, the nicest shirt he had in his closet.
“Thought I’d check in, see how you’re doing,” Steve says, taking a seat at the island. He takes the last forkful of eggs from Tony’s plate, nodding his approval. He’s already dressed for the day, dark jeans matched with a gray t-shirt and thin hoodie, and even with everything going on, Tony manages to appreciate the cling of fabric around his biceps, the way his shirt has rucked up to reveal a hint of flat stomach.
“You’re going to have to move me,” Tony says. Steve nods again, his face grim, and pushes a hand through Tony’s hair.
“Let them wait,” he says, keying into the lab. He’s about to let the door shut behind him, but Natasha grabs his arm, keeping him in place.
The morning after is not awkward, or, not as awkward as it could be. Tony refrains from making dirty jokes and disappears quickly to make use of the bathroom. When he comes back out, Steve’s in sweat pants and a t-shirt, stripping the bed.
“Bruce call you, too?” he asks
“Technically, all we’ve been doing is sleeping together.” Tony willfully misunderstood her question. “The bed’s supposed to be a queen but really it’s like a twin, and trust me, Steve takes up way more space than you’d think.”
There’s a “but” coming, so Tony waits, concentrates on the idle way Steve’s fingers brush along his stomach. “But I don’t think he was prepared for this.”
“Exhausted,” Tony says, delighting in flopping down on the sofa just set to right. “Terrified. Probably still trying to convince myself this is some crazy dream.” He scrubs his hands through his hair, realizing its the first time all day they’ve been alone. “Thank you for doing all that stuff earlier. The clothes and the toys,”
“I think this is my cue to head out,” Tony said softly beside him. Before he could move, Steve gripped his hand tightly, looking at him with a mix of arousal and panic.
“Tony?” he says, “I don’t really remember what happened.”
There’s a long silence as Steve curls around him. It’s only early evening, not much past 6, but Tony’s already inches away from sleep, the long walk from the medical wing to his living quarters exhausting him.
He has Peter’s full attention now. “Do you dream about monsters?”
“Wait, is that—” Steve stops mid sentence, just catching on.
From the counter, he pumps a little lotion into his hand, slicking his palm and finger tips. Steve’s eyes are shut tight. Tony watches his own reflection in the mirror before fixing his eyes on the sharp wing of Steve’s shoulder blade. With his slick palm, he takes Steve in his hand again, this time making a lose fist around the length and stroking slowly.
“Your squishing me,” Peter complains but Tony only squeezes harder.
Steve looked neither surprised nor pleased to see him.
They train again in the evening, Natasha, Sam and him. Peter pops in towards the end of the session, and Steve pretends Tony’s absence isn’t a direct result of his dickish behavior earlier today.
“He did, huh?” The corner of Steve’s mouth tips up in a smile. “Well, that was very nice of him.”
“You’re back,” Peter says, eyes still half closed. “Did you fight bad guys?”
Steve grunts an acknowledgement, and checks his pulse the old fashioned way, fingers pressed to his neck. The sonic boom had fried his entire suit, cutting off access to FRIDAY.
“For the best,” Tony says. He picks up the bear, and can’t quite push the image of little Peter out of his mind. He’s grateful beyond measure to have Peter back but he feels a deep well of grief suddenly for the little boy he’ll never see again. “You were right,” he says, putting the bear down. “It was nice having someone to take care of.”
Cursing them both, she reached down and grabbed the back of Steve’s head, pushing him harder between her legs, crying out as Steve’s tongue teased out a powerful orgasm.
“Steve?” He stands outside Steve’s bedroom, straining to hear anything from the inside. The door is locked but his access code still works, and he enters with a loud rap of his knuckles. The room is empty, Steve’s jeans and sweatshirt thrown onto the bed. He’s about to call his name again when there’s a loud crash from the bathroom, followed by muffled cursing.
A rush of affection swam through Tony’s chest… wait. No. Thats not what it was. It can’t be. Tony refused to admit he might already have a crush on his husband. That was unacceptable. It was too early, they had only know each other less than a day. The whole point of this marriage was to get a strong warrior with a skilled army to marry him so that he could take his city back. Affection and feelings were not part of the deal! He was just lucky his husband was hot. It would make the sex better.
“Kitty, I don't wike it.” Sarah said meekly into her Uncle T’Challa’s neck.
“Listen.” Steve said.
“Steve.” Steven interrupted. “I wish for you to call me Steve, if you would like…” Steven looked down nervously and began fiddling with the furs below them.
The genius pushed back so that there were a few inches of space between his lover’s delectable body and his own. Looking directly into Steve’s slightly flushed face, Tony replied, “With pleasure”.
Sarah curled herself more tightly against her “kitty’s” chest, her face burrowing in the crook of his neck as if she were trying to hid from something.
“No. Please don’t.” Tony implored in as firm a voice as he could manage, seeing as he was basically begging his future-husband to care about him in a way Tony had never expected anyone to, and still didn’t. It was a weak naive hope that Tony thought he had let go of years ago. Apparently that was not the case.
Despite their initial confusion and uncertainty about the extent of their babies full abilities, since Peter was only about six months old when he was left with the super couple, Steve and Tony had learned rather quickly. At some point, Steve and Tony had grown so accustomed to their super powered baby and his frequent roof rampages that they had done everything they could to baby proof the entirety of the house, floor to ceiling. However it wasn't perfect and they tried to keep Peter away from the majority of the house when he was running all around the walls and ceiling.
“We rigged the drawing, Tony. All the numbers said 438. The first drawing was legit, but the second time, Peter wrote 438 on all the slips of paper and mixed them up. When he pulled out his number, he just pretended he got something else. We all did. You didn’t really bother to double check.”
“Tony, I know what’s going on inside that head of yours. Don’t make what happened today about Manila because —”
“We won’t get any further, not anytime soon,” Hope concedes.
“No.”
He was going to have to fix that he thought. Either put one in Steve’s room at the compound, or add one in here. He’d buy the building if he had to to make it happen.
“We’re sure,” Tony says, looking down at the mop of brown hair. Peter’s curled around his leg, his face half buried in Tony’s pants. “We found his clothes near Scott’s van, plus the video log shows Peter in the hanger. He comes in, looks around and boom, everything just flashes to white.“
“What do you think Peter, is Steve allowed in?”
They had been through all kinds of missions together, spent hour after hour sequestered together in the compound or on the QuinJet, and yet Tony had difficulty recalling if the two had ever been alone together like this, in the quiet end of a day.
“It’s OK,” he says. “You made it. You’re alright.”
There’s a brief moment of hesitation but Peter shakes him off. “I’m glad you’re OK Mr. Stark, I really am.”  When he looks up, his eyes are big, round pools of grief that make Tony’s heart ache.
Steve shifts in his seat, tugging uncomfortably at his pants. It’s too dark in the room to see much, but he doesn’t need his eyes to sense Steve’s discomfort.
After all, Tony already knows more than he wants too. What they found in the farmhouse was grotesque and stomach churning. He had expected some kind of Hydra base, perhaps a military installation like they kind they’d seen in Siberia. Instead what they found was an old, abandoned barn, unremarkable from the outside, but outfitted with enough medical grade equipment to function like a lab. In the far corner, there were three long, steel tables outfitted with sturdy, metal restraints and encased in barbed wire.
“Fuck, you look so hot Rogers. You should see yourself,” Tony mumbled softly in his ear, kissing down his neck, making him even crazier. “You’re fucking unreal you know that, it’s a shame you keep all this wrapped up so tight.”
All they have are questions and no good answers.
“Buddy, what’s wrong?”
“No.”
“Yeah,” Tony says. “This time.”
“It what?” It's only Steve’s hand on his shoulder that keeps him in his chair.
“I’m gonna come Tony,” Steve says so Tony stops, takes both his hands away and winds them in Steve’s hair, pressing their bodies together till there’s not a breath of space between them. He brushes his lips against Steve’s temple, and slides the damp fabric of his cloth covered erection along Steve’s dick, making him curse loudly. Steve’s hands fumble for this waist and grip him tightly as Tony slides their erections together, the head of Steve’s cock catching against Tony’s belly.
Tony smiles through his clenched jaw and jams his hands into his pockets, out of fear of what they might reach out and touch. Next to him, Dr. Cho fiddles with an IV on Steve’s arm. “I would urge you not excite Captain Rogers too much,” she says, her voice was soft yet firm. “We’re still running tests, just to be safe.” She shuts the door on her way out, leaving them alone.
“That’s OK.” Tony says, his voice a low rumble.
“I don’t mind,” Steve says, but Tony wouldn’t do that.
“I love you too,” he says absently. He squirms to be put back down again and May brushes the tears out of her eyes.
Steve squeezed Tony’s fingers at the mention of the word, at the declaration of where the evening was headed.
“Come on kid, time for bed,” Tony says, picking him up when things are quiet again.
Steve crosses the room, pulls Tony into his arms. “This is not what I thought I’d feel,” Tony says against his chest. Steve runs a hand up his back, tangles his fingers through the short hairs at the back of his neck.
“You gotta be fucking kidding me.”
“No,” Tony said at the same. “We had a mild disagreement about it.”
They had taken photos, documented everything, and let only a few trusted SHIELD agents clean up the mess. The report was written, he just hadn’t let anyone see it.
For a second, Bruce looks like he’s going to protest, but he eventually nods. “One at a time.”
“Sorry buddy, this is a one man job. You stay with Steve, OK?”
“Want some coffee?” Steve hands him a warm cup, and Tony doesn’t miss the way their fingers overlap for just a little too long.
Steve’s face was cast in a warm, yellow glow. For a moment Tony wanted to reach over, tip their faces together and kiss him. He knew that if he did, Steve wouldn’t object.
Tony’s head snaps up and Ross looks like he’s going to protest, but Steve stops him with a glare.  “We don’t send anyone out on solo missions, Secretary.”  It’s a lie. Steve flies solo all the time.
“Tony—”
Tony gasps and let’s Steve experiment with feel of it before gently pushing him away. He caresses the side of Steve’s face with his free hand, and speeds up his strokes with the other. Steve just opens his mouth, ready to taste Tony’s come.
“Sometimes you act like you’re the only one with feelings,” she chided him quietly, her initial burst of anger spent. “I don’t know what happened with you two, but you just,” she paused for a second and threw up her hands. “You made him sad. He doesn’t open up to anyone like he does to you. You have to fix this, Tony.  You have to at least talk to him.”
He had orgasams before, with women and by himself, but nothing like what was building in the base of his gut.  He made small thrusts into her mouth, felt the tip of his cock hit the back of her throat. Tony stroked his face, tugged lightly at his hair, urging him on.
“Well, that’s my job,” Tony says, looking directly at Steve. “To make sure you don’t get hurt.”
“So, you guys haven’t slept together yet?” He turned around at the sound of Natasha’s voice behind him. There was break between speeches, and she’d found him hiding in an empty conference room.
“You’re going to be fine, Tony,” Steve said, squeezing his hand. “Bruce says the cure is worse than the disease.” It had been a lie, but he let it go, considering the tube down his throat didn’t allow him to talk.
“More or less.”
“You alright?” he asks.
“You won’t.” Steve moaned a little again as Tony pushed a thigh between them, gave Steve something to rub against. “I know what I’m getting into, Tony.”
“Privacy. Figured you wouldn’t the entire compound watching.”
There was the tell tale flinch of Steve’s jaw that meant he was annoyed. “I get cold easy,” was all he said before he pulled the covers up around his shoulders and curled onto his side.
“Look, I know I’m just a kid, but it was really hard having a crush on MJ and not saying anything about it to her, you know, because I just ended up acting totally crazy and she was like,
They’re all gathered in the hanger, Bruce and Hope in radiation suits, May hovering in the corner, her eyes already watery. She takes Peter from his arms, hugs him tightly.
Peter giggles. ‘No, she won’t.”
Tony could kiss him. Probably should kiss him.
“So, where is she?” he asked.
Tony doesn’t sleep that night. He lies in bed, running over the calculations again and again until finally, sometime around 4am, his eyes just finally shut. It’s Peter playing quietly with his bear that wakes him a few hours later.
Peter slinked away but he’d made his point. Tony was still thinking about his advice when Steve made his way over to the table. “They get mad when you switch the name cards around like this,” he said, pulling out his chair.
“We had to burn them,” he says. “My suit and Steve’s. There was just too much blood. They weren’t going to get clean.”
“You don’t do this kind of thing, remember?” Steve said, as Tony pushed him through the door.
He wears a path around his lab, shuffling from one task to another, unable to focus. His thoughts are scattered, every moment of full concentration interrupted not just by the memory of Steve’s tense shoulders and rigid, unmoving back, but by flashes from last night, the way Steve had come apart under his hands, moaned so softly at his touch. He had wanted to chase after Steve after the debrief, but Bruce had shaken his head, his arms crossed over his chest. “Give him some space, Tony. He’ll come to you when he’s ready.”
He runs Peter a bath in the giant tub he never uses. He fills it to the top with bubbles and hot water and throws as many toys as Peter asks for. In the end, it’s just a soup of brightly colored plastic bobbing between stiff, soapy peaks.
Steve didn’t bother to correct him. They’d both slept well. Surprising well, actually.
“Yeah, kid.”
“I asked him to stay but,” Steve trails off. “He’s worried about you, Tony. I just think it’s easier for him not to be here right now.”
They had taken their time getting ready, putting on silk shirts and ties and trim wool suits, before finally stepping out of their room. As Steve opened the door, Tony had been unable to stop himself from smoothing his hands down Steve’s shirt, touching once again without permission.
Steve glared at him again and kept walking. “I’m not an idiot Tony, I knew something wasn’t right.”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “Sorry to waste your time.”
“The Vulture, I think,” Tony says. He squints into the bright afternoon sun, tracking Peter with his eyes. There’s no trace of the quiet, reserved little boy from this morning, for which Tony is grateful. After making Steve read him two more stories, he’d jumped down from his lap, tugged at Tony’s hand and asked if they could go outside and play.
“He’s alright?” Steve asks. Peter’s out like a light, his mouth slack against Tony’s leg.
“Throw in a salad, but yeah, I think we can do that.”
“That’s enough,” Tony snaps from the back of the room.
Tony takes Steve’s hand off his hip, squeezes it before putting it firmly on the bed. “Just let it feel good,” he says, kissing him slowly. “You’re safe now. You don’t have to fight so hard.” He pushes his tongue inside Steve’s mouth, licking against the soft palate, until Steve’s writhing under him, fingers tearing at the soft cotton of the bedsheet. “Come for me,” he says again and Steve rips his mouth away, his hand flying to his dick.
“Bruce, just because…”
“I made this,” he says and shuffles through the stack he’s been working on for the past two days. He hands the first one to Sam, beaming. “See, this is me, and you’re helping me fly.”
“Can we talk about this later?” Tony says, pouring more juice. “Maybe when we don’t suddenly have a four-year-old juice junkie deal with?
“That’s not the deal here,” he says, squeezing Steve’s hand but moving it off him. “This isn’t a quid pro quo situation.”
Tony waves it around in his hand. “I even printed it all out for you, because I know what a luddite you are.”
“Alright kiddo, that’s enough television.” He flicks off the TV and within minutes, they’ve built an impressive fort of sofa cushions. Tony watches, one ear on Hope and Bruce’s conversation, the other listening to Peter screech with delight as he body crawls around the living room.
“Good,” Tony says and does it again, rubbing until Steve’s breathing heavier. “Let it feel good, OK?”
“Not yet, Rogers, not yet,” Tony chastised him slightly and reclaimed Steve’s mouth, one hand spreading Steve’s leg wider.
Except it wasn’t home, not really. Their room had started to feel more and more comfortable but Tony was keenly aware of the clock winding down on this little bit of indulgence.  It was for the best, he tried to convince himself, that he only had two nights left to chatter at Steve while they brushed their teeth at adjoining sinks. And only two nights left of watching Steve putter around the room in pajamas, checking the locks and poking at the fire. Neither of them was built for domesticity, but they had settled into a comfortable routine in just a couple of days, and Tony felt a sharp pang of grief at the thought of giving it up.
It ends in exactly 28 minutes, Steve and Nick and Maria shaking hands stiffly across the table, before leaving in seperate directions.
Steve almost comes right there, with Tony’s hand on his wrist. He’s so hard he knows he’s not going to last long, even though he just came. He should get a condom, or be better lubricated, but he’s confused and blind with lust, heart hammering at the thought of Tony being there, watching him while he fucks. He lines up between Kara’s legs and pushes the head of his cock inside her first, just a little, before pulling back out.
“It’s not totally out of the realm of possibility. You, Steve, a small bed, a romantic setting…”
