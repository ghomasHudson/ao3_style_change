Sam made sure to sit next to Natasha and Clint made sure to sit next to him just to annoy him. Bruce was sprawled on his couch. Nat was worried he was taking it all get to him. Tony and Steve were made to sit on the same couch because Nat thought if they did end up having to go on the mission together, they'd better start practice getting alone.
The doors slid open and Steve entered, glancing around. It wasn't the first time he'd been inside the workshop.
"I kinda liked you, you know. Loved putting all those thoughts in your head. Felt kind of intimate." Loki smirked at Clint.
"Seriously?" Tony pursed his lips, "You're blaming me, for this? What other choice did I have? Seduce Loki into not killing us all?"
Anthony froze in his tracks, his eyes fixed at Steve. His lips curled in something that wasn't a smile.
Thick, dark clouds have started gathering above him. He turned to take a view of the sky and the vast expanse spread in front of him. There waa a figure, a man standing at some distance. He was walking towards him. He stood still, waiting and wondering.
Howard Stark had thrown a party. Steve still couldn't manage to ask Peggy to come as his date, but he was glad they'd get to spend some time together anyway.
Sam walked towards them with trembling legs. He'd been Steve's first friend in this century. The man who was a soldier to everyone else, had been just a boy to Sam. A friend and a brother.
Steve had no idea why he was still standing there putting up with this man or why wouldn't Stark just walk away. He was more than relieved to see Natasha approaching them.
He rushed towards him. Turned him over. He'd been shot at three places, but was still breathing. Blue eyes opened, started at him for a second and shut close again.
The party went well after that. Sam managed to dance with Natasha and Pepper had been able to find excuses to make Steve and Tony talk a couple more times.
"No luck so far. Besides, it's better if it stays confidential." Fury's words were calculated but enough to tell them he'd rather put his trust in them.
"Let's not overthink," Steve grinned, the characteristic kind gleam on his face. Natasha knew that even now, the soldier's mind was busy calculating and strategizing.
"Well, so far all we know is that our dead scientist didn't invent it. It's probably alien tech, he was merely investigating it." Bruce sighed deeply.
"Sure, fine, whatever." he said, waving a hand. He was in his tank top, unshaved, with his hair disheveled. Classic overworked Tony Stark.
He didn't have to wait. After getting discharged in six days, he was ready to pay Fury a visit, but was ushered by a very serious Natasha into a car. They found Fury in a deserted construction sight.
"This." Nat produced a flash drive from her pocket. This is what 'I' was retrieving the other day. I'm sorry it almost got you killed. The device isn't real either. The scientist had it hidden before he was attacked."
The skull that enclosed the device seemed to be made of some sort of metal. Inside, there was a round, glowing object, radiating orange light and a giving out a faint humming sound. The skull was somehow channeling and controlling the device. For what, they hadn't been able to find out.
Turned out that Pepper had tricked him into visiting her grandmother so she could introduce him to her very attractive, MIT graduate, single cousin Amelia. Amelia was a redhead, with round, green eyes, which had a knowing, intelligent kind of gleam in them.
"So I hear," Steve grinned at him, taking a sip of his coffee. He knew what his friend was trying to say.
"On the contrary, I've been told I look pretty good for my age, Sam." Steve put on a tired smile. He wasn't going to let their morale down any further.
He visited his mother every day. Even if this wasn't real, he wasn't going to let this fade away without spending more time with her. His dad was just the way he'd remembered, aloof and distant.
Nat and Sam ordered pizza that night and they gathered to eat in front of the TV. It had been a tense day, with their minds constantly revolving around the current mission at hand. Nat had decided they deserved the break.
It was so easy to befriend Steve. Sam wondered why'd he always pictured Captain America as some sort of 'Mr. Toxic Masculinity'. This guy was the most human kind of human Sam had ever met. He was like a unicorn made of Jell-O. Okay, maybe a bit of an exaggeration. But Sam was sure Steve was the kind of guy who cuddles with kittens and cries over romantic movies. He'd never buy the Mr. Stoic act even if Steve had ever bothered trying.
"He," Natasha gasped, pointing at Loki, "he did it. It has something to do with the skull, right?" She sobbed. A tear running down her eyes.
His vitals were steady so far. After he'd been shot twice, the round object had completely disappeared, the skull empty now. Tony lay unconscious on the floor.
Nick Fury had called a meeting in the Avengers tower and everybody had to be there. Nat and Bruce had already been in the tower and Clint and Sam had joined shortly. Fury's shrewd gaze settled at the empty seats as Captain America and Stark were nowhere to be seen. Thor, of course, was not on Earth.
"Of course you don't," Tony was probably too tired and too stressed to hold back, "You're Captain America, the great American hero. Leader of the Avengers. You get to question a bunch of scientist who've been working themselves crazy on this device."
Steve didn't visit them again, but Tony had found out about his workshop from his father. He found the workshop easily. It was empty. He'd probably left. As he turned, he saw Steve standing behind him.
Sam Wilson didn't need permission from Steve 'Captain America' Rogers. He'd flown straight into the life and heart of the American hero, without even his badass wings, and Steve was going to have to deal with it.
"He said the other side of the device was inside him," Tony's voice was still and calm, "I didn't hear it then, but I had JARVIS play the recording. And the footage from the day Loki attacked. I think, somehow, when Loki pointed the skull at him, he did fire at S... Cap. He just didn't feel anything."
"I know what dead means, Wilson. But, it's Steve, for God's sake." His eyes stared pleadingly into Sam, hoping he'd understand that their loss was mutual.
"Oh, no, this is about you. Everything is, Cap," Tony growled, unable to control himself, "You're the great leader and everyone else here is just a soldier who should be ready to jump into the inferno whenever you ordered. Let's completely forget the fact that we wouldn't have caught Loki if it weren't for me, while you were inside the tower, hiding behind your shield. Oh, but this is fine. It's fine for you to be a sham of a hero. A fake. A liar. Right, Simon?"
Steve let himself drift into the merciful arms of a slumber. He couldn't go back and deal with Tony's indifference again. He might've slept hardly for an hour when his emergency phone rang. He woke up with a start. It was Sam.
"Anything interesting in there?" A familiar voice said. He looked up and saw none other than Tony Iron, Iron Man standing in front of him. He sat on the chair next to him, smiling sadly. Steve was surprised to see that kind of expressions on his face.
"Unnhh, Tony," he moaned and Tony felt a surge of desire intensifying throughout his body. He started stroking himself with one hand as he worshipped Steve's cock hungrily. It didn't take long for the both of them to reach their orgasms. Both panting and gasping for breath. Steve's cum all over his lover's chest. He pulled the scientist up and placed a deep, but slow kiss on his mouth. Tony rested his head on Steve's head and they drifted off.
They had lunch together. Then Steve bid him farewell but Tony offered to give him a ride. Steve had no problem with few more minutes of Tony's company. Tony drove him to his apartment.
"NOT NOW!" He was trying so hard to keep his hand steady. His heart pounding in his chest. He took a few deep breaths.
Steve had nothing against parties. He hated crowds but could perform when he had to. Though this party was more about being totally unable to win an argument from Natasha and Sam and less about having to put up a visage. This was a party Pepper Potts had thrown and nobody knew he was Steve Rogers. So, all good. He was here as Nat's plus one and Sam had volunteered to come as Sharon's. Mostly, so he can test a theory and see if Natasha would be jealous. Turned out, you can't break a spy like Widow.
Tony's ears were blessed with the sexiest moan as he took him in his mouth. Steve gasped and thrashed before settling down.
Steve's face changed. A pained expression ran through it. Stark has the eyes of a scientist, he couldn't possibly missed it. He'd also noticed how tired and battered this Simon looked today. Like he'd run a thousand miles or hadn't eaten or slept in days.
It made sense now. He didn't know why or how. But the missing few seconds after Loki had pointed the skull at him but seemingly hadn't shot, the few second Steve couldn't remember, they carried everything. He didn't feel any pain at that moment. Or even now. Those few seconds were nothingness. The nothingness he was going to turn into.
For Tony, Howard Stark had been a ghost. An empty shell of a father who had been there, but not the way Tony wanted him to be. Even after his death, his name, his legacy had haunted Tony. Then Afghanistan happened, and Tony found another path for himself. But that didn't make the problematic childhood go away. The pain of having a ghost for a father.
"I'm sorry," Thor said, looking at his feet, "I was about to say that Steve seemed a bit off. There's something I can't put a finger on, but... Did Loki attack him?"
There was nervousness, too. Captain America himself was a sort of a huge persona to commit himself too. But it was okay because at least he'll get to be Steve Rogers.
"End it. Do whatever that will make you feel better. I'd deserve it all. Just let me prove my love to you." A tear escaped his eye and Tony's heart trembled. Why was he so helpless? He cried.
He didn't expect that the moment Tony's eyes will set on him, seeing him in Captain America uniform for the first time, he'd find himself wishing that he was still frozen.
Still, he couldn't feel anger and pain stinging into his chest when Natasha explained the blast which had almost killed Steve. He decided that from now on, he hated Fury with all his heart and made sure to announce it every time he saw the man.
Bruce said he needed something for his aching head and left. There was an awkward silence as Tony realized he was alone with Steve in the lab.
"I'm sorry, Tony," he looked down, embarrassed, "I shouldn't have. Not now, not in the lab back then. You're my teammate, it was a mistake."
"There's no point arguing," Steve ignored Tony's sass, "We need to get to the tower. Bruce and Natasha will keep an eye on Loki. Iron Man, go straight to the tower with Thor and Falcon. Find the other half of the device and get back here." The Captain stood resolute, without a crease on his forehead. All business. Tony looked at his face. That moment was long gone. The brief moment he'd had with Steve, and now the Captain was back.
Thanks to the superserum, his wounds were healing fast. He'd been still out for a week before waking up. Sam had been there when he opened his eyes. The poor guy looked as if he hadn't slept in ages. He told him Nat was fine. She had been out of the building chasing an agent while it happened. They still didn't know who the third party was who infiltrated the operation. The terrorists who'd stolen the device had been caught. Well, a few. Most had died in the blast. Steve knew the answer but he wanted to talk to Fury before he said anything to anyone.
Simon Edward was the identity Steve had taken as per S.H.I.E.L.D.'s instructions. They'd given him a decent apartment, right next to Sharon Carter's. It was good, actually, having someone he could feel a connection with. Natasha was cool, she cared about him and had even tried to set him up with several women, including Sharon, over the past few weeks. Sharon was amazing and so were the other women, including a new internee at S.H.I.E.L.D.
"We'll get to work. Once, you tell us what this 'device' is and why doesn't it have a proper name, for God's sake?" Tony was obviously not buying into it so easily.
"Tony, this isn't the time. I said I was sorry. Don't make this about yourself." He tried to keep his tone devoid of all the anger that was coursing through him.
"We're fine," Bruce assured him, "What we're worried about is that what Loki has to do with this device and what was he trying to achieve by attacking?"
"Cap, we have a situation. Looks like we won't have to go look for the device." Sam was speaking an oddly loud voices. There were bangs and shouting at the background. He realized that he could hear faint noises even without the phone.
No answers were needed. Tony was pouring himself coffee and Bruce just sat on a chair, staring at the wall absentmindedly. Life of the geniuses.
Steve didn't know what to do. His brain cells seemed to have started some sort of rebellion. If he thought he could handle this situation gracefully, he was mistaken. Tony was staring at him as if he was trying to burn him into ashes using his glare.
Tony's mind had been a giant mess since the Chittauri attack. He was torn between missing that shy, blue-eyed artist to hating their stoic and determined team leader. He had nothing against Cap, really. He could work through his resentment and manage a decent team dynamics with the man, but the loss of the man he'd started to have feelings for made him bitter. He felt betrayed, too. Wondering if Simon's whole personality had been an act, too. Because, the Captain was so different from the man who looked lost and lonely in the cafe that day. Their team leader had the nerves of iron. He always ready for a war.
And though he'd probably considered one of them, he occasionally would, if he'd been able to feel a connection. Not the kind of kinship he felt with Natasha and Sharon, or even Wilson. But, a connection - connection. If only he were able to feel 'anything'. He was good at adapting. He loved the friends he'd found in this century. But he still felt as if he was a spectre floating through the days and nights. With nothing to hold on to. No one to go to home to. No place he could really feel at home at.
"Save him?" Sam had had enough, "Listen to yourself, Tony. He's gone. Dead. You know what it means?" His voice trembled. Tony turned to look at him.
"You might be right, my friend," he finally spoke, "but... please let me speak (he added, as Natasha mumbled) it's Loki we're talking about. Whatever sob story he told you about wanting our mother back, there might be some truth in it, but it won't be without treachery and hidden agenda. You cannot trust him. And if you must take that step, which by the way, I don't recommend, you should be ready for 'anything's." Thor took a deep breath and turned away to help himself to a chair. There was something about having lost their leader that had broken the team's spirits. Even Thor wasn't immune to it.
S.H.I.E.L.D. had sent their special task force, led by Captain America to retrieve a device that had been stolen from a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist last week. The scientist had been murdered in his lab. Natasha's intel had led them to this building where the device was being kept. The mission had gone wrong as they were made. Now they were being fired at from all directions by a legion of enemy agents.
"Oh, please... " Tony rolled his eyes. What's literally everyone trying to set him with someone these days?
Tony kept howling with laughter throughout their walk to his house. Steve could see it was mere coping mechanism. He wasn't drunk but didn't took him long to get there once they were inside Tony's workshop. Steve could feel the pain Tony must be feeling, the pain caused by Howard's venomous words.
"I'm fine, really. The past few hours have been stressful is all." Steve assured him, standing up. "Bruce, you should check on Stark and see if he's accidentally killed himself. He hadn't updated recently."
He wandered off and saw that this establishment had very few houses. His was startled to see a old-fashioned building with Tony Stark written on it. He figured this was supposed to be his place. He enjoyed remodelling and redecorating it. Built a workshop in the basement.
He saw a lot of people there that evening. People who'd served with him. People Stark knew. Including some good looking young men and women. He looked around for Tony and then he saw something which made his heart do the most terrible jolt he'd ever experienced.
Tony gulped, feeling an unexplainable surge of anger, "Fuck you. That was a mistake?" He was breathing fast and it alarmed Steve.
Steve was out of mortal danger but still unconscious. Sam had let slip it was his second close within a few months and when Tony had demanded further information, he'd refused to say anything.
“We’re gonna have so much fun with everyone today!” Steve smiles finally stepping out onto the stage. “I’m here today with my family to have fun with them and everyone else.”
She sat in the room by herself while Steve and the doctor talked. “Luna. Luna Elizabeth-Sara Stark-Rogers.”
Harry pushed open the door with everyone following. None of them knew that there was no floor on the bottom. They all were falling until Hermione caught them with the first spell she learned at Hogwarts: Wingardium Leviosa. When she let the spell go they landed in the sand.
Bucky went behind Peter putting a hand on his shoulder. “Peter she might not be okay in the head. Remember when I came home? Of course, you do you don’t forget anything. I was a bit shaky for a while and couldn’t remember much. She’s gonna be the same way for a while.”
Tony, I miss you. I heard a rumor I might be home before Christmas. Our first real Christmas together. I helped save a family out of a burning house last week. I have never felt so useful! I can’t wait to hold your hand again. I miss you. I hate seeing kids hurt. Thanks for the ‘homemade’ cookies Sorry, I can’t write a long letter like you. You are the genius after all. That last eight-page letter was amazing by the way.
Thor sat in the back and looked at the door putting his hands up when the husbands walked through. “Don’t be mad. She told me ‘let’s do something crazy and I fell for it.”
Bruce pulled out a portable IV pole from the bag he brought up. “I will. Let me at least get you set up on an IV to make sure your not dehydrating. Your gonna need more water and everything, Luna.”
The one judge stood up and looked at Violet with glaring eyes. “How did you think you were going to join this school of top musicians when you can’t even play. Just because you are Tony Stark and Steve Rogers child doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want when you want.”
Luna sat on the chair and smiled at the crowd who was laughing at her. All she could do was smile. She was going to make the best out of being here. She wanted this and to learn everything about this school as possible.
“I found her two months ago. I was sitting with Peter at his science convention and saw her. She stared at us. Once she noticed I saw her… she ran. I have been tracking her trying to figure out how I was going to talk to her.” Tony told him and began running down faster.
EVERYONE kept buying Steve drinks telling him how sorry they were for his lost. By the time the service started Steve couldn’t hold anything together. He has been a mess since they went back to the compound. Not leaving his room unless Luna dragged him out to eat. Bucky came in four times a week to make sure he was taking showers and drinking enough. No one knew Steve was going to crash down and burn this badly. Steve stayed in his upset state for three months. They didn’t celebrate Christmas that year.
“Petey!” Tony kneeled and held his arms open for his son to run into them. “Oh, I have missed you so much. Jarvis even missed you, U, and bonehead Dummy. Aunt Nat and Uncle Rhodey and Bruce miss you even more though. Not more than me though, because I can’t be without you.”
Taking out the flash drive out and putting it in her cleavage she walked out of the lab skipping making it look like she did nothing at all. She halted in her tracks and ran back to the computer and looked up Gilbert Bougainvillea. The man who played the first chair in any production the school performed. Looking at his picture she couldn’t help but want to see him more in real life.
“Everyone is down. Where are we at with the source?’ Steve asked and looked around making sure there was no one left or anyone hurt.
Violet laid there quiet listening in on everyone. She didn’t want to open her eyes and face reality. All she could think about was playing the piano for her audition for the advanced music school she has been wanting to attend for the past year. She needed to find someone quickly to control.
When they arrived at the same venue they did Tony’s the crowd was being held back as Luna, Wanda, and Happy went inside. The rest of the Avengers were already there helping set everything up. They all looked over when the door closed.
“I was not! Stop being a dick, Tony! Why do you want to affect the team, Tony? Do you want us to fail? Do you want to quit the Avengers?” Steve left in the middle of the fight to tell Bucky goodbye. Bucky broke up with him two weeks ago.
That’s when Sirius, Nymphadora, Mad-Eye Moody, Kingsley, and Professor Lupin showed up to the battle. Sirius battled with Harry while Nymphadora, Mad-Eye Moody and Kingsley, and Professor Lupin helped the ones at wand point escape to the main hall.
Luna sat at the VIP table in the back of the room with Peter. The two sat there quietly looking at one another.
“I won’t let you take them out of this tower! Fuck you if you think you're taking them! You won’t touch them!” Tony screamed.
Harry looked up at him smiling. “I waited fourteen years. I can wait a little longer. Decides I just came here for Sirius!”
“Love the way you think, Steve,” Tony told him and took his third helping. “You really do know how to cook.”
Violet pushed Peter across the room and looked up at him. “Stick me. Don’t let me hurt him,” she got up and grabbed the tray walking over to Peter. “Don’t hurt him. Don’t hurt him. It’s Peter.”
I flew to New York, S.H.I.E.L.D’s headquarters and left myself on the office doorstep of Nick Fury knowing he would find someone to raise me well. With only two hours left, I drove uptown and killed Adrian Toomes the way he killed my fathers. Shots in the head and in the back with a pistol gun. With that being my final act I faded knowing that my timeline was gone.
Steve opened the door with red eyes and tear stains on his face. “She’s dead. Before the kids could even know her better.”
Luna woke up in the middle of the night sick again. The past two days she hasn’t been able to keep anything down. She had to take off work not being able to attend meetings while throwing up. Nobody ever likes working with sick people. Peter had to go to the meeting though not being able to miss it with her.
That was the last thing Tony said until the court date to anyone. He would lay around the penthouse watching TV or a movie that the twins would watch. Sometimes he would be in one of the twin's rooms laying in the bed holding one of there stuff animals. Until someone dragged him to eat or forced him to shower.
Steve sat down on the king size bed next to Tony and looked over at him. Tony is on his phone probably texting Peper about the meeting he had tomorrow morning at ten that he desperately wanted to skip since they were holding the twin's party tomorrow before they moved out of the tower for good this time. It’s not the end of the world, but to Tony, he’s lived here his whole life.
Everyone came back from the mission two days later. Everything was a disaster. Tony and Steve got in a fight in the middle of the battle. Tony was lucky to come back alive, but she didn’t care about that. He was interested in finishing the fight with Steve. They busted through the door in the garage in the middle of the fight.
“I wish I knew what happened,” Steve mentioned and pointed to the stairwell.  “Well, Pepper, see you in a few hours! Call you later.”
“Violet, hi… hello… how are you? What’s going on?” Steve started but didn’t know what to say. “Your safe now. I promise you are.”
“Of course. I trust you with all of my life. Twins and besties till the end.” Peter took her hands. “What's your big plan?”
Tony kneeled in front of the twins and sighed. “I should kick both of your asses, but your father and I decided that you did a great job here my loves.”
“After the hearing, she got in the car. I turned to talk to whoever one of there friends were asked if they wanted to join us. I turned around and she was gone. I believe his name was Bucky.” The man told him and sat down. “The whole time she was with me it was like she was changing, She was quiet for the first two weeks. Not talking to me or my sons. Then she started becoming confused the third-week asking questions. This week it seemed like she forgot everything, she didn’t even speak.”
“I love you too, Tony. I know you're in pain. You can let go. It’s okay, my love. I love you so much. Thank you for everything you have ever given us. I thank you for everything I am with you. You're the love of my life and I can’t think of anyone else I will ever love. Luna and I will always be here to remember you. I love you and can’t wait to marry you again in our next life.”
Steve looked at him. “I will be at that wedding. Even though she’s like 18…. Damn. Bucky everything I need to know. Let’s go.”
“I, Steven Grant Stark-Rogers, do.” Steve kissed her cheek and leaned into her. “I’m so proud of you,” he took her hand and placed it into Peter’s.
“I’ll be Toph, don’t get any of my costumes! I have everything in my closet. Can we eat dinner now? I’m hungry from all of this thinking. The other day should be Alice in Wonderland. I love that movie! It’s my favorite!” Luna told them.
The next thing she knew was she was at the top of the Statue of Liberty. Luna jumped off and flew in the rain to go to the compound. It took her a half hour to fly in the rain. She was glad that the broomstick was able to be told where to go without hesitation. Once she got passed the city the rain started to stop. She ran into the hospital wing soaking wet looking at everyone sobbing outside the room.
“Something that no child should ever experience,” Nat told them and walked over to the little girl. “I heard you are just like me. I was in the red room too. Your safe here I promise,”
Nothing could happen in three weeks. Everything happened. Luna doesn’t even know how she got caught in going to help Harry Potter fight in the Ministry of Magic, but she did. She fought against dementors. Yes, she wanted to learn how to defend herself, but getting caught up in a battle she nothing about wasn’t very smart of her. Ravenclaws were better than that she told herself the whole flight there.
“Of course. I’ve got to finish my superhero costume. I have a feeling you guys are going to love it!” Luna smiled and let go of their hands. “I’ll be down for dinner.”
“Violet, go ahead and eat. It’s safe.” Tony encouraged and took a cookie from the pack eating it. “These are our favorites!”
Tony nodded and curled into him setting his head on his nape. “How long do we have until they come here?”
“Yes I do,” Luna whispered and laid her head on his shoulder. “Do you know how much I love you? And how happy I am you took me in? I love you so much, Dad. Thank you for the amazing life you have given me. I love you so much. I love you, daddy.”
“I texted Happy and he doesn’t know it. Peter is gonna try and hack it,” Bucky told them and leaned on the wall. “I feel bad hearing her cry.”
“At least we saved the city and got to meet the rest of the Avengers. This was the coolest thing I have ever done.” Peter smiled and looked at everyone else in the van. “Are we going to jail?”
They walked out to the middle of the dance floor and danced slowly to the song ‘Little Do You Know’,
“My father bought the property and kept it how it was. What would he think about us being married? I bet he’s laughing his ass off in hell.”
After an hour Bruce, Nat, Vision,  and Wanda let themselves into the house. “Hey! Who is ready to go to this fundraiser?”
“Find it soon or the kid gets pancaked,” Hawkeye told him and started walking towards their location.
The judge just shook her head and continued with speaking. “With the both of you fighting to save the world you left your twins home alone. Your daughter has lost both of her arms. Your son had a missing finger, which I’m not going to even ask. You both are very dangerous with power. Whether power is wealth or true power of strength. Your lawyers are each going to speak on your behalf. Then we are going to question the twins. Am I clear?”
Steve was never going to be with him again. Every kiss could be there last. The last time they had sex it could be there last. The last time he said I love you could be it’s last. He never wanted cancer to get this far. Tony knew he wanted to give Luna to Steve before he died so then he knew that Steve was taken care of. It pained him more than anything in the world.
Tony, Rhodey, Nat, and Vision went inside the tower going up to the penthouse. Tony pushed Rhodey away going over to the bookcase where all of the pictures they had of there wedding sat. “FUCK!” Tony screamed and pushed the bookcase over watching everything smash into a million pieces.
“No. I found out you are leaving in two months! Why didn’t you tell me that your part of some secret organization thing?!”
Luna leaned into his touch and grabbed his other hand. “Promise me you’ll come back, safe. Swear it to me.”
“Actually, that's the big secret around the town. That we may or may not be answering tonight. Wait until our speech tonight. Now if you could please excuse us.” Peter told them and walked to the next station of photographers.
Luna took Peter’s hand and walked out to Happy’s car. “Thank you for hanging out with us for the past few days. It was nice to have a friend for once. And, I hope you learn to love the Gilmore Girls like I have... coffee is life and a part of the humans body needs.”
She stared at the table top not moving. “V-violet.” She whispered quietly and laid her hands on the table.
“They don’t have a changing area in the men's room! We are just supposed to know that the nearest changing room is what did you say six stores over! Sorry, about!”
The sleep spell that I was giving myself to make me feel rested kept dulling more and more as we flew further away from the school. The dark black kept getting darker as I got restless.
“It’s drool. I didn’t change yet since I was helping her change out of her old clothes and she grew a big attitude. She clearly doesn’t like anything without pictures. That’s for sure.” Steve told them and opened the door a bit wider for them to go inside.
Luna gripped Steve’s hand as the hologram of Tony reappeared as they started walking up the stairs. “Who gives this woman away to this man?”
Tony held Peter while Steve pushed Violet in the stroller. Tony was forced out of the lab by Steve so they decided to go to the mall. Since it was Tuesday at 10:45 in the morning there was almost no one in the mall. They enjoyed looking in every store without getting stopped by anyone who recognized them.
Tony sat with the kids and watched the performance. He noticed once the performance was over Steve still wasn’t back. “Kids sit here. I’m gonna go check on, Papa.”
“We have a home we can have you stay at while you figure things out. Either the children will pick or the court will. I will call child protective services,” Denice told them and got up from the table with her phone in hand.
"Look," the man sighed, "When I'm saying its 'dangerous', I'm there have been deaths and disappearance ever since it's surfaced. Hydra's interest in it is a reason enough for us to secure and investigate it. So, get to work," Fury was doing his best to sound calm.
Steve stared at the figure now standing in front of him. It took him a while to recognize him, he was older. When he'd last seen him, he had been a young man.
"Natasha had Loki spill the beans. This skull thing is just one part of the device. The other one, well, Loki says it's in the tower. When Iron Man attacked Loki, the other half got lost due to that blast. It's probably at the tower."
"Are you out of your mind, Stark?" Fury growled, "You're letting this abomination trick you into suicide."
Anthony let our a bark-like laugh, "Yes, please do forgive me, um... Captain America. Just having a bad day."
But even when he did, he'd find something to whine about how Tony should this and Tony should that. Tony was far from the ideal of perfect which was Captain America. He remember cosplaying as Captain America, uniform, plastic shield and all, just to make his dad happy. Edward had just squinted, and managed to smile.
Tony's breath got stuck in his throat. Ty was here. It had one year since they'd ended their relationship and now he was suddenly back.
Steve sighed. Nat was eyeing Tony thoughtfully. Banner just looked like a lost puppy and Thor seemed to be enjoying this moment.
Tony had asked him countless times now whether he could also hear the faint buzzing sound sometimes. Steve told him he didn't, but he heard other voices. Tony had been hearing voices too. But they lingered for a few minutes before fading away. That night, they were louder and felt closer. He couldn't understand what they were saying. Tony woke up with a start and turned to look at Steve who slept next to him. He took a deep breath and bent to kiss his boyfriend before going back to sleep. His heart was heavy and he felt a strange kind of weightlessness.
Okay, so kind of trying to understand what the characters are going through right now. Will get to action in the next chapter. Tony doesn't hate his dad, or even Cap for that matter, but he's had an absent father and likes to blame Cap for it. Will also shed more light on his toxic ex in the next chapter.
"I'm almost out of juice," Tony sighed, but as he said it, there was a blast and smoke filled their vision for a minute. When the view cleared, they saw Loki sprawled unconscious. The Avengers had their injuries but nothing serious.
"Who cares what he thinks," Tony thew himself on the couch, next to Steve, "Can't expect him to change." Steve pulled him closer and Tony rested his head on his chest, Steve could hear the rhythm of his heartbeat.
How do you tell a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that you kinda sorta have a crush on him? Especially when the said agent is in a drug induced slumber in the ICU of a hospital after having been shot three times? Well, you don't. You just fuss around, bullying nurses and doctors, telling them they better be able to revive your not-boyfriend before dawn, or you'll buy this hospital and replace everyone with more capable professionals, or even robots, because you're Tony Stark, for God's sake.
"I can't have my fr... teammates lying to me." Steve spoke in a cold voice, even Fury felt a chill running through his spine. Nat looked upset.
"I know you're afraid, all of you. We lost Cap today. If I were you, I wouldn't want to lose anyone else either," Tony ran his tongue across his hips, his throat dry, "Steve was more than our friend. He's my... our... friend. And I won't hear another word. I've made my decision." He looked around, all of them looked hopeful and frightened at the same time.
The world slowly faded back into focus. The sky was now a shade of bright blue with a few clouds scattered on it. He heard the soft sound of waves and a pair of arms holding him. He blinked his eyes and tried to move. As he looked up, he saw Bucky smiling at him. His head was in Bucky's lap and they were in a boat.
He'd stayed there for a few hours. They chatted about movies, football, and Black Widow. Steve had been careful to not let Tony get a hint about him not being who he was pretending to be. A part of him wanted to get rid of this fake identity. Bury Simon Edwards with the friendship, or rather feigned friendship of Natasha. Leave all connection to S.H.I.E.L.D. behind. But then, what? It's not like he could escape what was coming for him. Fury wasn't wrong.
He didn't expect that seeing those dark eyes widen in shock, disgust, and a knowledge of betrayal will make him want to jump off the helicarrier.
"I have to admit, you have some balls showing up here without an army. Where'd you get that new toy from?" Counts glared at him.
"You don't see anything wrong here?" Tony said one day, "Look at my parents. Peggy should've been just as old by now. She was alive the last I remember. Even if this is some sort of paradise, this is a bit suspicious. Maybe, she's in your head."
"They really seem to prefer me, Cap. Guess they're not into men." Widow panted. She was being surrounded. Steve ducked just in time to avoid getting his skull pierced by a bullet. He ran to help Natasha.
Red sparks erupted from where Iron Man was firing and Loki lost his balance. A smile appeared at Tony's face.
Steve was taken off guard. He was supposed to be Sharon's partner at S.H.I.E.L.D. so it was no surprise she told this to Pepper, but why'd she talk about the art thing?
Peggy was as young and beautiful as Steve had remembered. She'd moved next door recently and although Tony had pointed out that her house didn't even exist a day ago, Steve had started to feel that everything was going to be fine. He hadn't asked Peggy out just yet, though Bucky had pushed him to do it, but he was positive she was going to say yes whenever he did. Tony would scoff and click his tongue every time Steve would act like an idiot around Peggy.
"Eww. No, of course not. I was thinking of setting you up with him. The girl at the flower shop was more than happy to offer her services as a pimp. I think you need a pastime other than "Let's-poor-Tony-hitched-so-he-doesn't-drink-himself-to-death." Tony went on, talking way too fast, without looking at Pepper's face that was wearing a murderous expression now.
"Ss... Steve?" The man let out, "Are you Steve Rogers? I can't believe it. We thought you were dead."
Fury had left. Natasha and Clint, in terrible moods, were sharing notes on how much they hated Fury. Steve couldn't help but smile at their childlike annoyance. He was worried, too. The last he and Natasha had been on the mission, he'd almost died and Nat survived only because she was out of the building. He caught her eyes and smiled reassuringly. She wasn't buying it.
Steve drove Tony's car and got him home safely. Tony was already better by then and asked Steve to come to the workshop with him. He had no reason to decline, so here he was, sitting on a sofa in the workshop, while Tony talked non-stop about his projects.
"His name is Simon Edwards. He visits my auntie's cafe sometimes." for some reason, she was whispering in a scandalous tone, "Why don't you leave me your number and I will give it to him next time he... "
"Stark isn't making any sense. I've sent a team, with Clint and Wilson to the workshop. Once we've seen the... b... body... "
He sent the doctors to Steve's room and told a dishevelled Sam that his friend had woken up. Sam sobbed for real.
"I figure you don't like S.H.I.E.LD. agents," Steve bent his neck a little and smiled, "You don't have to, um... give me company. I won't tell Miss Potts."
Tony nodded, frowning, "Nothing personal against your national hero. My dad was obsessed with him. Wouldn't stop talking about him."
Tony noticed that too and looked up with a start, their eyes met for a second. For a second, he thought he saw a familiar kindness in those baby blues.
"So?" He looked at quizzically, "One of you turn this device on and shoot me. And repeat the process within a few seconds. Clear? "
"Mr. Edwards," she beamed, "Sharon was just telling me about you. She says you're an amazing artist. Pretty interesting combination, with all the S.H.I.E.L.D. stuff."
"Ah, of course, considering your employees happen to be... Well, let's not talk about it in here. I hope they're not trying to turn into some kind of... Captain America, though. Use your looks to recreate a dead legend, eh?" Tony couldn't hide the bitterness in his voice.
Natasha and Bruce stood besides Thor. Bruce was ready to let out Hulk and give the god a good beating.
Natasha let out a sigh. "Whatever the plan is, I'm going." Her eyes were piercing through Steve's. She wasn't going to let him walking into a deathtrap alone.
"Easy, there. I don't miss a date, you know that." Iron Man's usual carefree voice informed them of his arrival.
Steve, Simon to Tony, wasn't dying. He was healing well, according to the doctors. Natasha had arrived as soon as she'd received his call. He knew Simon was friends with her and Sharon. He was a genius, thankfully, so he didn't let S.H.I.E.L.D. get the wind of it. Sam was also there, looking awfully pale, his eyes swollen as if he'd shed some tears.
"I think I might've just the answer to your question, Cap." Tony was standing besides him, looking exhausted and thoughtful, "My theory is he's not as smart as he thinks he is. And even he doesn't know what device is capable of. I think he wants to use us to unleash it's powers. See? Don't need a superspy to figure it out."
"Yes, yes," The man said, bemused, "I... live with my wife, not very far from here. You should come visit us sometimes. I still can't believe my eyes. Why don't you have dinner with us tonight? In fact, come with me now, if you're not very busy that is." The man looked fairly excited.
Tony spat, " Screw you! Do I look like a fool to you? Get the hell out of here or I'm ending this right here. I'm Iron man, you son of a bitch!"
"This skull-like device was developed to channel and manipulate the round object inside. What that object's true nature is, I don't know. I was hoping you'd figure it out. Turns out you're not the genius everyone thinks you are. I know what the round object does. At least few of its powers, I have witnessed." Loki spoke in an uncharacteristically calculated tone. Iron Man stood in front of him, pointing his repulsor at him. They had turned off the comm so Loki could talk to Tony.
He didn't expect that moment Tony Stark would walk in, talking To Fury with his manic energy, his heart would flutter like a caged bird.
"This can't be good," Clint gritted his teeth. After Loki, he had a reason to despise everything extraterrestrial. "Should we talk to Thor?"
It had been two hours since Tony had been gone. Thor and Natasha were giving Loki death glares and Bruce was monitoring Tony. There was a sudden change in Tony's heartbeat and then it became steady again. Bruce looked at the monitor, panicked.
Hydra had been taken down. Fury was back from the shadows and Steve had forgiven Natasha. He hadn't heard from Stark but his friends told him how worried he'd been for him when he was out. Sometimes, they'd tease him about Tony and suggest he should call him. He'd blush and scold them. But secretly consider taking their advice. He never got around to doing that because he met Tony Stark sooner that he'd expected, but not in a way he'd liked.
At first, Tony looked puzzled. He probably thought that they'd decided to pull some sort of prank or even assign the role of Captain America to Simon due to his resemblance. Then, as Fury briefly explained that S.H.I.E.L.D. had discovered Steve Rogers, the real Captain America, frozen in an iceberg and had chosen to keep his identity secret, Tony's eyes, fixed at Steve's face, widened and gleamed with something strange.
"He's improved since last time," the spy grimaced, "won't tell much. According to him he's achieved what he came for and now he's here for the show."
Fury had been working on the Avenger initiative for quite some time, but Loki's attack had forced him to speed things up. Steve was very reluctant to say yes, but the threat seemed serious enough.
“Yes, sir. My apologies for wasting your time.” Violet walked off the stage holding her breath. When she arrived backstage she kicked the door to the locker room and sat on the bench.
Luna walked up to the front desk lady and looked at her dead in the eyes. “Excuse me, ma’am. I’m Luna Stark-Rogers. I am demanding to speak to Nick Fury. Unless you want a lawsuit on your hands I suggest you get him out here now.”
She shook her head. “Either my head makes something without my permission or I cause an event to happen. I thought about Papa yelling at me about not going downstairs and he did it. I thought about the train having to be stopped. We shouldn’t see Santa since we are bad. And it caused you both to fight.”
“Sure, go ahead. Did you need any help?” Steve asked and went behind her and rubbed her back lightly.
“A-always… love,” Violets rasp voice started and looked around the room forcing herself to sit up. “Daddy… Papa…” she took deep breaths and started to cry.
“You are not responsible for what your mother did to you or even before that. Why did she tell you that you need to pay for her sins?” Steve asked her and kissed the top of her head.
“There no such thing as Santa. Flash was right. Freaks like us don’t get to meet Santa or get presents.” Peter told him. “Are we freaks?”
“You won’t be able to know them, but know they love you too. They will always watch over you from the heavens.”
The girl stiffened and gripped the cane trying to switch it to her other hand, but someone came up behind her with a gun to her back. “N-no comment. Dad… Papa… Happy. Happy!”
Helen Cho looked at them then back to her watch. “I should get going, and Bruce don’t forget to tell them about the boys special powers already.”
“Morning…” She mumbled and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. “Staying up late with you was nice. I gotta get dressed. I’m getting married to my best and only friend my age.”
Not even ten minutes later the common room was filled with everyone. Everyone was dancing and playing party games to entertain the youngest. Since she was still the only child in the tower having a normal party was out of the question. There were no other kids for her to play with though she was fine with it. She wanted to learn more than anything else in the world. Since she knew she was a genius she wanted to study everything! People aren’t a big necessity.
“Genius. Billionaire. Playboy. Philanthropist. Gay. Superhero. Father. Husband. What about  you?” Tony questioned then the recording stopped.
Tony rolled his eyes and went into the dressing room only to hear sniffling and coughing. When they walked passed the lockers they found her sitting on the floor. “Violet…”
Peter packed his book bag and stared at the floor in his bedroom. He walked out of the room and into the main area. “Dad… I don’t wanna go. Why can’t we stay on a different floor?”
“When will you tell him?” Bruce asked sitting on the bed. Slowly he pulled her into his chest kissing her head.
“Not about that, Stark. We need to get the press all on the same page about your family life. You caused this mess and you will fix it. There are eight press meetings set up for both of you. And depending on what you say five for the twins. Which they need to sign with us if they want to stay on. They can not play hero without my consent fur-” Fury barked at them.
Newt growled and pulled her along to keep going. Luna followed the dog letting him lead her. She kept coughing from the smoke. “Newt… slow down. I c-can’t keep running this fast!” She painted and kept going until she tripped down the stairs landing on her side.
Looking at them she shrugged. “I always knew. From the time she showed me how to control my powers to how I could protect myself. She took me to the red room to teach me everything I needed to know about the future and fighting. Something I will have to do when Peter is in danger.”
The video went to black and Tony looked at them. “Does that look like a freak? A monster? No. He just wants to be as happy as himself.” Tony sighed and looked at the crowd. “You all have messed with my words and actions along with everyone else in the Avengers. My daughter is only four years old. She is a sensitive little girl like most others. She saw herself on TV with everyone one in this room calling her a freak!
“T-thank you everyone for showing there support today. It means a lot to me that they are loved this much. My father’s favorite saying was ‘to the end of the line’. I never understood what that meant until this past week. I have thought long and hard about. He never meant to death he had you. You had him until you were dead. We all have a part of Steve and Tony until we die. We all have the memories of there love and actions implanted into our brains. I remember the day they adopted me like it was yesterday. They both told me that they would love to ‘to the end of the line’. He might have been at the end of his line. But his legacy will never end. He will be remembered forever. None of the videos from YouTube or any other database will ever go away. Somewhere and somehow the names Captain America, Iron Man, Steve Stark-Rogers and Tony Stark-Rogers will be speaking somewhere. Their end of the line is just the beginning of a new.”
Fury leaned back in his chair rolling his eyes. “He is on a special mission. He should be coming home tomorrow morning. Shouldn’t you be at school?”
“Tony, give her the Ferby, please. I just want her happy. Are friends and family will be here soon. Especially our new co-workers.” Steve hissed at him.
Wanda got up and looked at them. “You two need to calm down and take deep breaths. They will be fine.”
“They should be back by the time we are done our lessons.” Tony smiled and placed the plates down in front of them. “Enjoy.” Tony looked over and held his hand out to Steve. “Come here hunky-monkey.”
Peter squealed in the video, “Daddy look! I gonna be just like you!” Peter jumped down and swung jumping into Thor’s open arms. “Wee!”
“Luna, can we talk? I know your studying, but you leave in the morning,” Tony asked the girl sitting at the desk while drawing in her sketchbook.
Tony pulled her onto the couch in her room and held her hand tight. “You know how proud I am of you, and how much I love you right?”
“Luna?” Wanda walked up to her slowly putting a hand on top of hers. “How are you doing? It’s been a week since… yeah. D-Do you want to go to the funeral? It’s today… for both of them.”
Tony paused loving that everyone was on the edge of there seat clinging to every word he said. “It is true. This will be my last expo, but the company will not be leaving high and dry. I’m here to introduce the new CEO and Lead Technology Inventor of Rogers-Stark Industry. Peter and Violet Rogers-Stark!”
“No! Don’t do that to me! You just figured I wanted that! Not what I truly wanted.” Peter screamed at me. “We were kids when they died, of course, we are going to be scared by it! We are fine now! We have seen so many people we know and love die! So, stop fucking around with time again!”
After what seemed like years Bruce came out of the bedroom they shared. “Well, Tony. It looks like your going to be a father. The serum in Steve’s body reacted to how much sperm was entering his body and you know… a baby. He is carrying twins Tony.”
Walking into the kitchen I kissed my boyfriend’s head. “Gilbert I’m going to go see Peter. Tell Abigale I will see her later at the concert.”
Opening her eyes she looked down at where her arms used to be. “Well… it could have been worst.” She mumbled her voice was raspy.
“So, I told Peter I would fix everything. He forgot the promise as he grew up into the young man he became to be. He would be so upset if he knew I saw you guys. A-anyway… he married and had four kids while going to MIT. I went to NYU and got my business degree so I could take over Stark Industries from Pepper since she wanted to get it on with Uncle Phil.  So, I hurried and got my degree leaving my music in the past along with my boyfriend, Gilbert. Time past and I started dating Gilbert again.
“You think I’m cute?” Luna blushed redder than a tomato. “Don’t say anything like that until it’s been a week. I need to grief then I can deal with feelings. Please, Peter.”
That was the last time Luna left the house. Steve and Tony couldn’t handle the thought of her dying from a Hydra agent or even from a freak accident. They started treating her like her disease and not her. Luna was just happy that they loved her and kept her safe every day.
Tony smiled and laid his head back. He knew Steve was going to need someone to take care of him when the arc reactor stopped working. Giving the technology and his math is never wrong that he would be dead in two years time before the tumor could get any bigger.
Tony still made sure to sit on the other corner of the sofa, avoiding looking at his not-ex. It didn't stop Steve savour his presence. His enhanced senses allowed him to feel the rise and fall of Tony's chest, his breath, his heartbeat. He was pretending to watch Star Trek with them and laugh at their banter. But all he cared about was the brunette who was probably wrestling with his dislike of the soldier. More involuntary sighs from Steve's part.
"Are you suggesting Bruce and I are incapable?" Tony snapped. He shoved his hands in his pockets, his face glowing in a shade of murder.
"There is an ambulance outside and SHIELD people," he whispered to Tony, "We need to take him to SHIELD facility so they can find out the... cause of death." Sam was barely holding himself together.
"Have the supersoldier and playboy decided to bail out on us together?" Fury gritted his teeth. He wasn't in a pleasant mood.
He saw movement in Steve's hand and let out a gasp. The man was slowly opening his eyes now. Tony called for the nurse and rushed towards his not-boyfriend.
"You okay? I'm sorry about the show earlier. It was nothing. Those old ladies are more into each other than they're into creatures with dicks." Tony grinned at a bewildered Steve.
"Oh, I'm sorry. I bet you grew up hearing how much you look like him. Might've gotten you into the whole hero worship thing. Considering you ended up in S.H.I.E.L.D." Tony took a sip from his cup of coffee which had just been left here
"Oh, please," He shouted at the AI, "tell him to fuck the fuck off. I'm not his errand boy. I need my space and peace of mind to work on this."
"STEVE IS DEAD," he shouted, a tear escaping his eye, "YOU KILLED HIM, YOU SON OF A BITCH." This was it, Loki wasn't quick enough to see the repulsors being fired straight at his chest. He fell with a bang and his laughter filled the room. Even in anguish, the god was mocking Tony. And then he cried. Tony froze.
"You've... met Amelia," Steve didn't know what else to say so he commented on Tony's Not-Date, the new intern Nat had tried to set him up with. He didn't know she was Miss Potts' cousin, "she's a good kid."
Fury couldn't finish what he was saying as without even them noticing, Hulk had thrown a table against a wall. He was banging against Loki's chamber to get inside. The god looked terrified. It took some coaxing form Natasha and Thor to calm him down. When he turned back into Bruce, Natasha held him in her arms and they sobbed together.
"Don't you dare cut him open or something," Tony's voice was still devoid of emotions, but the glint in his eyes was threatening enough. Fury tried to reason with him about how an autopsy and some scans were required so the cause of death could be found out. He was not having any of it and refused to talk to Bruce or Rhodes who'd just arrived. Before they could figure out what was happening, he was rushing towards Loki's chamber, ready to fire his repulsors at him.
Steve returned the smile. Even though they were facing a serious alien invasion issue, he felt a bit better knowing he could now get rid of the burden that was Simon Edwards.
"How would I know where our dear old Captain America happens to be." The emphasis on Captain America was audibly resentful. Sam's eyes quizzically fell on Natasha and shifted to the figure standing next to her. Steve had just arrived, in his uniform, looking all soldier-like and stoic.
The rest of the day went away in a haze as well. The Chittauri attack brought them on the same side again. Steve forgot about his own issues for a while and became who he was supposed to be. Captain America.
"I've seen the footage. You're not the type of guy to make the sacrifice play." (I'm sorry, I know you're a good man. You saved my life)
"Can't believe how quick you can turn back into an asshole," Tony snarled, running a hand through his hair, messing it even more.
"Aw, wish you'd use them to watch your back." Iron Man was hovering right behind Loki and before he could react, he was beaming at the invisible shield around Loki, using all the power he could.
"Sometimes, I have nightmares, you know?" Tony whispered, "There's this strange buzzing sound I hear. People that I don't know. Screaming. Calling my name. And... your name." He swallowed.
He was feeling better a few minutes later but hadn't recovered completely. Steve offered to take him home and Tony agreed. He didn't want to be alone.
Steve ran towards the basement where the device was reportedly being kept. It was a huge, damp, and dark lab. Dim lights blinked across the laboratory. Surprisingly, it was unguarded and empty. Steve was no fool. There was something wrong. And then he saw him. Rumlow smirking at him from the far side of the lab. A blue box in his hands.
"You're assuming way too much," Steve looked directly into Stark's eyes, his face slightly red. The man almost dropped his coffee.
He banged a fist at the table and ran hands through his hair frantically. There was silence for a minute.
Steve threw Tony on the bed. The brunette looked up at his lover eagerly, who was now stripping in front of him. Feeling a surge of lust run through him as he saw Steve's stiff cock. Steve lowered himself on top of Tony, placing a hungry kiss on his jaw, he started stripping him hastily. Tony rushed to help Steve and took off his clothes one by one. When Steve's hand first fell on his hardness, he let out a moan. This feeling was familiar, somehow. Steve was tracing deep, moist kisses on Tony's neck. Moving down with each kiss, his hand moving gently on Tony's cock. Tony gasped as he realized where Steve's hand was going. He twisted in the bed, thrusting his head backwards as Steve pushed a finger into him, looking at him for reassurance. Tony moaned and swayed his hips. Steve bent to lick the spot above his belly button, softly biting his eager skin.
Tony started going through the sketchpad. He's good, he thought. There were portraits of his friends in there, Sam, Sharon, and Natasha. Sketches of cars, statues, buildings.... and then, was it... Peggy Carter?
"I don't get it," Tony paced around, "I distinctively remember he had the skull and nothing else. He's playing with us."
"Mmm?" Steve slowly blinked and as the room came into focus slowly, he saw Tony, with wet eyes and trembling lips.
"Oh, you weirdos are having guests now?" A booming, sarcastic voice said from the kitchen and a man walked out. He looked familiar, but Steve couldn't remember how he knew him. He had dark eyes and hair, like Howard.
"Ha, ha! Nice try." Sam rolled his eyes, "I think I should call Natasha to call you out on your bullshit."
Steve blinked and the movement of those wonderful lashes almost broke Tony's heart. ('Honestly, what's going on with you, Tony? You've hated this face all your life.')
"I will go and try to talk to him. Brother Steven, you do not look well today." Thor's shrewd gaze settled at Steve's face.
"Let's first find out what this device is and what it does." The Captain glanced at Tony and Bruce. Bruce nodded and Tony made sure to look the mug on the table. Steve was now used to Tony avoiding making eye contact with him. It hurt, but he'd made peace with the fact that he had no chance with the genius because he happened to the hero Tony had always hated.
"You're S.H.I.E.L.D. Funny they managed to find a Captain America lookalike. I wonder if they'll be giving you a star-spangled uniform soon." Stark sounded like he's been bitten by a snake.
"No need," Tony yawned, staring into his coffee as if he's talking to it. Steve let out another sigh.
It wasn't the first time he'd put on the Captain America uniform and held the shield again. He'd done that while fighting Hydra. This time it felt more official. He sat inside the helicarrier with Banner, Natasha, and Thor. He kind of liked Bruce. There was a calm energy around that man despite the fact that his alter ego was an angry green being.
We're almost there. Next chapter will be the big reveal. How'd Tony react when he finds out who his crush is?
"And that's not a problem?" Clint shouted, dodging. Loki somehow seemed to be protected from whatever they shot at him.
"Not at all, honey. I'm already starting to make friends." Stark placed a hand on Steve's shoulder who winced unconsciously. Stark looked at him with a start and removed his hand.
"Thank you," the voice was soft and energetic at the same time somehow. He gave her the money and turned around, again, and...
"That doesn't sound good," Fury sighed, "Try to find out what you can. Even if you have to unleash the Hulk on him."
Tony was breathing heavily. The third cup of coffee was a bad idea. He felt as if he was suffocating. Ty's return had left with a mixture of confusing feelings. Was it hope or fear that he was feeling? A tear escaped his eye.
Steve opened his mouth to say something but the exact moment, Stark had looked at him with a start and that sudden eye contact left him speechless for some reason. Stark seemed genuinely nervous and shocked to see him there.
"Steve?" Peggy called him from behind. She looked beautiful in a red gown. But his mind was still caught in unholy thoughts about another brunette.
The doorbell rang. Steve's heart skipped a beat. They'd never had visitors ever since they'd started living here. He looked quizzically at Bucky, who shrugged.
"Fine," he gnarled, "Tell him he has only ten minutes and then I want him the fuck out of my workshop."
"I know, Sam." Steve looked at his friend, his eyes soft and full of concern, "Once Tony and Bruce figure out the device's purpose and location, we'll need to plan accordingly."
"I'm not sure," Loki gasped with pain and struggled to sit, "I told you it replicates itself within it's target. It recreates them in another universe. Another world. Steve can come back. But he'll need a connection, someone to guide him back. Someone's who's not... well... dead. Just like one half of the device connects with the other half. I just, thought, if I can learn to channel this power, I can somehow, bring back my mother." He fell silent, staring at Tony.
"Brother, please, there's still time to right your wrongs," Thor's pleading eyes stared at his brother who was looking at some distant point, smiling.
"Unclear. This is why I need you to decode the message." Fury started intensely into those dark eyes. "All we know so far is that it's dangerous."
Tony choked on his coffee and looked at them dropping his plate on the table. “Um… what about that cartoon the one with the kids I bet they have that on TV right now!”
Tony walked into his room and got on the suit that was laid out on his bed. It took him an hour to get changed and to fix his hair. He looked at the letter framed on his wall.
“Excuse me, sirs. Nick Fury would like all three of you to the compound as soon as possible.” Jarvis spoke. “He said it is urgent, but not Avenger business,”
Nat walked in with the bottle of pills. “I figured you would be back for this.” She handed them to Steve and sat a glass next to Tony.
The girl just looked at them with her light grey eyes. Her blonde hair going past her chin by half an inch. She had on a purple and blue polka dots and a big pink flower hair bow on her head.
She flinched and moved away from the couple. She looked at the ground and focused on the ground. “Don’t touch me, please.”
“Well, I can remove it and put it in a womb-like state cell until it is old enough to be born. Or I can abort it. Whatever you think is right. Steve is up when you're ready to speak to him.” Bruce smiled. “I will stay in the living room until you guys decide.”
Luna shrugged and looked down at her black sparkling heels not looking at anyone in the eyes. She was feeling guilty about how she screamed at them after her father's call.
Just thinking like that had Tony pacing the rug in the living room maybe even a thousand times before he had to sit back down. He would have gone to the lab to blare AC/DC, but he knew how much of a pet peeve it was to Bruce.
“Baby, I don’t know your name or even what sex you are, but I know for the rest of my life I will always love you. I love you so much that it’s gonna hurt. I won’t be like my birth parents who left me. I’ll be like my parents who I was destin with.” Luna began to tear up.
“I’ll go. You get looked at or your sleeping on the couch again.” Steve told Tony in his best caption voice.
Tony sighed. “I found out I have a tumor in my brain. We wanted to have a child and I’m going to give him a child before anything happens to me. Steve doesn’t know anything yet. Doctors gave me two years and I want them to be the best I’ve ever had. Luna is involved in making it the best.”
“Call Helen Cho. Now, Jarvis!” Bruce yelled and kept looking at the baby. “Tony, Steve I need you to leave. Lay Peter on the bed, Steve.”
Bucky kissed his head and grinned. “Steve I will be fine. If anything happens I will look for you to help me.”
“We could have you each have a twin each week.” Steve’s lawyer Denice told them. “That way you each have one. Then celebrate things together.”
“I sold the tower. I bought land in upper New York. We can all live there safe and sound. I promise my love. I swear.” Tony mumbled and whimpered holding his side. “Everything hurts.”
Steve nodded and ran his fingers through his hair. “Yeah. Only two people hurt and there are people, so no casualties. Are you both okay?”
“Bucky, where in the sam hell am I?! I want to go home!” Steve asked his oldest friend walking over to him. Just watching him Steve could tell there was something going on that he didn’t know.
Tony held his arm out for his soaked daughter. Luna ran to the bed and pulled her father into a tight hug. “Daddy, I was so scared I would lose you. Don’t ever leave us. We need you. I love you. I love you so much, dad.”
“She wouldn’t look at me… we always look at one another. She cried on the stand.” Peter told him and gripped his jacket.
“I finished them last night. I figured I would wait for Tony to put them on.” Bruce grabbed the box and took both arms out and a small EEG headband. “We need to make the headband bigger as she grows up, but the arms extend depending on how tall she is. It will grow overnight with her. Come here, Vi.”
She nodded and wiped her face off. “I knew your voice from somewhere. That’s why I didn’t have my parents or the rest of the family attack you. You wouldn’t have hurt me. Though you do offend me when you use he, and him. I am a girl. I’m happier as a girl. I might not have picked to be a girl, but do any of us pick to be our gender? It’s chosen in the womb my the sex cells.”
“Welcome everyone I’m Peter better known as Spider-Man!” Peter smiles and took the microphone. “Man! There is more than enough projects here that I should have thought of myself. Kudos to everyone! I am going to be the lead man in the lab! I’m taking in the next generation of MIT applications. I can not wait for everyone to graduate.”
“I need a little more time…” Luna whispered and leaned into him. She was standing on top of his feet since she was no weight to him.
Steve looked up. “We didn’t want everyone to know our business. Sorry everyone we wanted time to ourselves. Our daughter made us realize that we needed to come public.”
It’s been two months since Tony did the DNA test on his daughter. He told everyone about the test and showed them the results. Tony and Steve thought about and knew it was best for the girl to stay with Bruce and Nat since they didn’t want Peter to think they were replacing him. They did plan to tell her on their 6th birthday and would give her a choice. They had two years until then to figure everything out in fine details.
“That’s my name don’t wear it out!” She sat up and ran over to Steve wrapping her arms around his waist. “Let’s go home! I want to see Dad. He's supposed to be back by now!”
“Okay, we will talk to her,” Tony whispered and kissed the top of her head while Steve ran his fingers through her hair.
Steve looked at the man. “Bucky wouldn’t have hurt her. Decides he’s at the penthouse. Hasn’t left since the trial started. He had an episode last night, so he decided to stay still. Has she been taking her pills?”
“She’s got a bit of a jump in brain waves. It keeps going from delta waves to gamma waves. It’s crazy to think she is jumping around like that.”  Bruce told him and kept checking the machines. He fixed the IV in her leg. “I don’t know what state she will be in when she wakes up. I know these bruises and the burns she has is going to sting.”
“I want to make it right to the people who have lost something,” Tony told him and sat in the chair. “And… yes, I won’t get looked at until my children are out of surgery. That’s what all of us Avengers are doing until they are awake.”
When the door opened all the dust that had accumulated went rushing out the door. Peter started coughing and turned on the lights. The piano in the center of the room was covered with dust and all of the music books. No one had been in the room for the past two years since they were taken away.
Bucky stood up to look where to go next but got shot in the arm eight times. “Bucky!” Tony yelled and held him.
Jarvis told them. “Yes, Ms. Widdow. You will arrive in twenty minutes. We are descending as we speak.”
Four big German Shepherd dogs stood around the children and barked at everyone around them. The press and reporters started backing away.
Tony stormed off into the lab and stayed in there for months unless dragged out by someone. He was determined to make his family normal again. So, he did what he did best. Invent. After eight months of working his ass off, he made a device that was able to be plugged into the brain to help store memories. He couldn’t do anything about her powers. He just couldn’t sit there watching his daughter act like a six-year-old.
Tony hugged her and sighed pushing the headband back on to her head. “It’ll be okay. We trust your judgment.”
“Yes, I did. I needed to know your future was safe. She needs you. I grew up being the fourth wheel. You two had so much in common with Peter that I would use my powers to pretend I knew what you were talking about.” She told them and looked at all of them. “She is the key for when trouble finds you. You’ll understand when you see the hole in the sky.”
“Because she left a hard drive with us that shows proof. The only reason I asked you here was to see if you wanted custody. I know you were supposed to have twins and this is almost like having twins. If not Bruce and Natasha will be her guardians.” Nick sat back in his chair. “They thought it would solve your problem with Peter being alone.”
“No. Where’s my shield?” Steve started sweating bullets and grabbed his hair. “Bucky… where’s Red Skull? Peggy?”
“Lies!” Steve yelled and punched Tony. Tony closed his eyes and took it. He didn’t want his husband hitting him to be the end of their relationship.
Peter put the waters into his hand. “We will be a family. I know we will. Take your time. I-I’m gonna go… to my room.” He ran out of the garage full sprint.
Peter nodded and make a weak web around them keeping the snow falling from touching them. Along with the wind blowing right at them. Once they were warm enough each of there little bodies started to doze off into sleep.
“I can’t lose you too. Understand me?! I can’t lose you!” Steve screamed at her and shook her by her shoulders. “I need you to be safe.”
“Okay…” She whispered and kissed the top of Newt’s head. “I’m sorry you have to work on our birthday,”
Steve looked at him. “I will.” he went upstairs to the children's bedroom and saw the light on from under the door. Steve went into the room quietly. “Hey, Violet, you hungry?”
Violet’s eyes shrank in shock and began to kick her legs. She ripped out her prosthetic arms and went through the force field that burned her. “Major! Major!”
“Hey, Miss can you hear me?” Bruce asked and looked her over from head to toe. Looking over each scratch. “You used too much of your powers again. And when you fell you got a concussion. You are lucky to be alive. When you go home don’t sleep just take a few aspirins.”
“As soon as we’re in the car I want you to drive me to McDonald’s or whoever is driving. I need food. Fatty food.”
“I suspected you were coming. Please come in.” Dumbledore told her and smiled when she went inside the room. “How are you Luc- Luna?”
Luna sat on the stair and wheezed. She knew she couldn’t do the stairs without help or she would fall down the stairs and get hurt even more than she was. It was also a good call since she couldn’t see the booby trap on the stairs to avoid it. “Aunt Pepper?! Dad! Papa! Someone! Anyone!”
Tony looked at the twins. “They can’t go to school in these clothes. They need to change and shower. And I stink.”
“Did you not hear me?” She asked again and took a deep breath. “And you ask why I left the tower, Papa.”
Luna packed everything she could in her book bag. She made sure Purple was going to fit in her bag. In the school's handbook they give out to the muggle parents said that she would need a trunk for just her robes and uniforms. They also made a map of Diagon Alley for them as well to help get everything else she needed.
Luna cleared her throat and turned to face where his voice came from. “My real name is Luca Xenophilius Lovegood. Apparently to save me from evil my mom had me turned into a girl, but I am happy who I am. Luna Pandora-Elizabeth-Sara Lovegood-Stark-Rogers. For short Luna Elizabeth-Sara Stark-Rogers.”
The group ran as fast as they could. Luna stood stunned looking at the man standing stunned. She backed up slowly and ran towards the others. When the same man from the other side of the room appeared in front of her and smacked her in the face with the butt of his wand. Her lip immediately started pouring out blood along with where she hit the back of her head.
Both of us sat on the bench in the back while Bruce flew the plane. Natasha was telling me about how Bruce proposed to her and how they were going to have a summer wedding so I could be there. Decides that the flight was quiet. No one was telling me what was going on and why my parents didn’t come to see me during parents week.
Thirty minutes later Steve came out of the bathroom. “Well, it’s all out. Let’s go see what he wants. Just know we aren’t leaving him with Bucky again after the last time we went.”
“Violet, do you understand what's going on?” The judge asked leaning over the stand to see her face even though she was looking down. Violet just nodded and curled into Peter’s side with her face in his chest. “I need you to speak, please. Even if it is just yes and no.”
“No. I live there so then I know my worth. I gave up my salary to help pay the debt were in from S.H.I.E.L.D.” She looked up at him. “I have paid for frozen food and the apartment for the next year while I’m not getting paid. I got rid of my assistant while I was at it. Gave her to Peter since MJ wouldn’t take the title. Dad, Papa goodnight please.”
“I-I can’t bring the dead back to life.” Tony sobbed and leaned over more until his forehead was touching the ground. “Why can’t I bring the dead back to life?!”
Later that night Bruce, Steve and Tony all sat at the dining-room table. None of them knew what to do. They were already giving her sleeping medication so her dreams won’t flood her room. If they did give her the medication during the day she would become numb.
Gilbert took a painful deep breath in and looked up at her putting a hand on her cheek. “I-I’m… okay.” he coughed up blood and looked at her. The blood was pouring out of his eye and previous injury from the fight with Clint.
“Thank you again for saving from that boy back there. I wouldn’t have known what to do decides to take it,” Luna whispered. “I don’t really care what people think… it’s best not too.”
“PANCAKES!” Peter squealed and ran like a mad man into the kitchen swinging up on the table to sit in his chair.
Slowly Tony walked off the plane gripping Sam’s arms not trusting his legs. Tony tripped over the last stair falling into Steve’s waiting arms.
Pepper kneeled and kissed the girl on top of her head while stroking her fingers through her hair. “I will be right behind you. Just go before me. I love you. I will be right behind you. I promise. Cross my heart.”
"What do you mean? And why're we talking about S... uh... Cap? Let's focus on the mission at hand first." Tony spoke as calmly as possible.
"Pepper." Tony hadn't meant to cut her off in such a sharp tone but he couldn't help himself, "I'm in love with grandma. Can I have her number, please? "
"So, did you two find out anything?" Clint poked Bruce, handing him a mug of coffee. Bruce looked as if he was about to collapse.
"Maybe, it's trying to open a portal. God, I hope that's just a hunch." Tony bit his lower lip. "JARVIS, read the energy signatures."
Rain had poured down for an hour that day, after coming to an end. The sky was still covered in thick clouds. Steve sat in his usual corner in the coffee shop, reading the newspaper and waiting for his coffee.
"You, see, Cap, it was staring right at our faces, all that time," Tony was blabbering with a maniac energy, "The skull. Inside it, that thing, it's like a brain. We don't know what would happen if we separate it from the skull. And the thing inside, it has layers. I don't know what it is. It's something like that tesseract."
"Doesn't make sense," The captain said, "It looks like he wanted to get caught. Why'd he fly right into the trap with the one thing we've been dying to get our hands on?"
"On it," Clint gritted his teeth, shooting an arrow at Loki, which got deflected but he had Loki's attention.
"Yeah, sometimes. Mostly from old ladies," He said, blue eyes falling at the flowers now in Tony's hand.
"Holy shit!" Tony let out. He hadn't been hallucinating. Captain America lookalike stated at him, puzzled. There was a hint of exasperation and dislike in those piercing, blue eyes.
"Don't. If you can risk losing Rogers for good," A wide smile got spread across the god's face. Tony's breath got stuck in his chest. Loki was surely fooling with him. Tormenting him with false hope.
"I understand," Steve turned his head to look across the windows. Few rays of sunlight had started falling on the road outside.
Fury was quick to help them set up a chamber similar to the one they'd kept Loki inside before. They had the device now and Tony and Bruce were already working on it.
"We'll need our genius and resident scientist to decode the message." Fury looked from Bruce to Tony.
The soldier looked around with his usual smile, reassuring and powerful in a strange way. Tony's expressions were unreadable. Fury didn't acknowledge Steve much and started the debriefing. Turned out the device Hydra had been after had resurfaced. The SHIELD scientist had managed to record a coded message with the location of the device before dying.
Bruce looked up at Steve and smiled knowingly, "Cap, I know he's a pain in the ass, especially these days, but I'm sorry you'll have to check on him yourself. I'm so drained I might accidentally let the other guy out if he agitates me. Go to his workshop. Take something to eat, pretty sure he hasn't been eating." Bruce yawned.
"So?" Steve tried to take a step backwards, but Tony held his arm. And before he could say anything, the brunette had pulled him into a deep, hungry kiss. He found himself automatically yielding to Tony's mouth. Opening his lips to allow hid tongue to enter. Tony pushed him against the wall and straddled his hips. His mouth pressed against Steve's.
Tony ended up inviting 'Simon' to visit him in his workshop and see if he can find something interesting enough to sketch.
"Who would do this to him?" Tony looked helplessly at Natasha, who obviously knew the answer but stayed quiet. She'd already informed Fury. Fury was underground himself since there's been an attack on him as well and everybody thought he was dead. Steve had cut off all connections with everyone so he didn't get the news. Natasha felt responsible for not having been able to warn him.
"Come on, people. Thor, you've known people to come back to life," He looked at the Asgardian, "And what kind of Avengers we are if we don't give one of our own a chance?"
Steve wanted to say he was sorry. But he felt it was useless now. Tony hated him. With a passion. And then things accelerated fast. They said a lot of things to each other they didn't really want to. Steve wasn't sure why he couldn't control his anger, but he felt as if he was saying one thing while meaning something else. Tony wasn't very different.
"Of course not. It'd be nice." Steve smiled gently. He didn't like this man but there was no reason to lash out. He was surprised that Natasha was inviting Stark to hang out with 'Simon', while he'd been told it was important to keep that cover.
Sam had convinced Steve into wearing a crisp white shirt under a khaki blazer jacket. He caught the eye of several women, and men, the moment they joined the party. Natasha gave him a sly smile, "Don't you mind me, sweetie. If you don't mind going home with someone... "
"Oh, of course, I forgot you're an artist." Stark genuinely sounded surprised at his own forgetfulness.
And most of all, he didn't expect to come to a horrifying discovery at the very moment: he had a crush on Tony Stark.
"Fun," Loki smirked, "and revenge, of course. You'll be surprised at what this bad girl can do. Basically, everything it puts it mind to. Or should we say, everything I put my mind to." Loki pointed the skill directly at Steve.
Except, these days, a certain supersoldier found himself randomly up at night sometimes, thinking about a certain arrogant brunette he hated.
"I don't really know," Bucky sighed, "I think we're home." He pointed a finger in front of him and Steve saw the boat was already near the shore.
"I'm cooking your favorite," She smiled at her husband as they sat down, "Oh, and Howard, he's here." She said in a whisper, motioning towards the kitchen. Steve could hear someone humming softly and he thought of Bucky.
"Maybe," Fury grimaced, "You make sure to sort things out with Stark. Can't have your sexual tension jeopardise the mission."
"Pepper, honey. I'm fine." He grinned, "And guess what? I met another dumb and hot blonde at the flower shop today. His name is Simon and he's a Captain America lookalike." He laughed.
"I knew you were a freak," Howard's eyes were burning with loathing, "This isn't what I'd wanted for you. And him," he glared at Steve, "I should've known what kind of wretched monster he is. Considering he lives with a grown ass man."
"So, Cap, you do realize I'm more than just a pretty face?" Sam snatched the sandwich from Clint's hand and wolfed down a huge bite. They were all in the kitchen that morning.
"Um... Hi," He smiled nervously at Tony, "I brought food," he put the sandwiches on a table, "Just wanted to check on you, and apologize." Tony gave a deep, searching look, wondering how to respond. Steve took a few steps closer to Tony, "Look, I know I can be... difficult, sometimes. But, as your team leader, it's my job to... well... fuss over things." Steve said the last few words with a crooked smile. Tony's breath got caught in his chest.
"Kill me and you'll never find out what happened to your paramour," Loki sighed, "cut him open all you want."
Steve looked at him with a strange expression, and then turned to face Thor, "Take Nat and see if you can make your brother tell the truth. Or we'll have no choice but to shut Hulk with him in the... "
Steve looked the scientist helplessly. Tony had been so difficult recently and then, there was that kiss. He didn't want to have to face his moods alone. But he felt worried about him and had no choice.
Loki was flying towards the tower. Iron Man beaming at him. He seemed too terrified to fire back at him.
Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. To Steve he seemed like just another spoiled rich boy. He had come to respect Howard for his kindness and contributions. His son, however, from what the footages have helped him conclude, was a narcissistic and shallow brat.
Tony Stark, looking very charming in a suit, was literally throwing himself at a charming duo of singers. These two women were older than Tony and quite attractive. He was shamelessly flirting with them, being all touchy feely. Steve had this overwhelming urge to drag him out of there, push him inside an empty, shut the door, and...
"Let us hope it doesn't come to this," Thor said. He swiftly walked out of the workshop, followed by Nat and Bruce. Tony refused to look at Steve.
"What's 'Cap'?" Steve laughed, "And 'bestfriend'? Y'sure? I had a feeling you didn't like me." Tony couldn't help but feel his heart getting clenched in his chest as he saw Steve laugh.
"I... want you... to fuck me... right now," Tony managed to whisper in the midst of the strong waves of lust Steve's touch was blessing his body with. Steve grunted and took out his fingers, smiling at his lover who had his eyes closed, his face burning with anticipation.
Everything was still. They could hear the sounds of breathing in the hellicarrier. Sam started at Tony with his mouth opened. Nat and Bruce, who had entered the room during Tony's outburst looked wary. Fury had a quizzical look on his face as he stared from Tony to Steve.
Blue eyes softened a little. "That's kind of you." A nod of the head, a small smile and he was gone.
Natasha had to force Bruce into taking a nap after he'd been sitting near Tony's bedside for the tenth hour. Time was slipping and Tony hadn't been back yet. His heartbeat had went unsteady for a couple of times before getting back to normal.
"It's Loki, Cap. Yeah, we didn't see this coming. Don't know if he was before this all along. But he has the device now, and he's attacked. We've already sent Thor a message."
"Call me Tony," the brunette stared into Steve's eyes and for a moment, he felt as if his heart was stopping. Tony broke the eye contact and walked back into the kitchen. Steve didn't see him at dinner. Howard told him he sulked a lot. Steve had a feeling Tony didn't like him.
“I figured out a way to keep our parents alive and live until they are in their nineties. I’m going back in time and nothing would happen that has scared us for life.” I told him and gripped his hand.
They both got up and went no to the dance floor. Doing exactly what Peter said. They both danced like they weren’t being watched. Luna spun around with her hands up spinning them around.  “Holding on to one another's hand!”
When Happy pulled up to the red carpet everyone in sight was in costumes. Luna got out of the car gripping Peter’s hand. “Look at all the costumes… it’s so amazing. Can we dress like this every day? Come on Newt. Take him, Peter. OH MJ AND NED!”
“Correct. We keep everything behind the mask a secret so we don’t harm our families. I mean hey we could know each other outside of this and not even know it.” Peter told them and gripped Violet’s hand tighter.
“We could do Fairy Tail! Steven Universe! Oh my goodness there’s so much we can do!” Luna giggled and held them close to her. “Is everyone else coming or just us?”
“S-se’ u’...” Tony laid his head on Steve’s shoulder taking his last breath. His hand slowly losing its grip on Steve’s. Steve let go of all his worries into the tears that poured down his face finally. He wouldn’t cry until Tony died. It wasn’t fair to Tony that he was dying and had to see everyone's sadness.
She never noticed the rest of her family on the stage with her or even that there were more reporters there recording. Or even that Peter was walking out on to the stage.
Tony flew Steve up to where the machine was spinning and kept firing out randomly since it wasn’t able to fire into the wormhole.
Kent grinned and got every person from the press to leave along with everyone who wasn’t with S.H.I.E.L.D. He wants this scoop more than anything in the world.
Over the past two years, Tony and Steve have made enough peace to behave in front of Peter. They decided that parenting was the number one thing that was going to happen for them. Raising Peter to behave and be a good human being was there number one priority. Steve was still with Bucky. While Tony was okay being alone he had Peter and that was enough for him.
Violet got up and ran down the stairs shaking not wanting to get in trouble. Steve followed her and pointed to the chair. “You are going to sit and eat with us. Understand?”
Tony walked over and hugged Steve tight. “I have you if you will have me upstairs in your bed.” Tony watched Steve go out of his arms and laughed.
“No, I can’t do that,” Steve told him. “She needs us. Tony she already had bad cuts on her legs. She’s bleeding.”
“Your daughter. You said she ran in front of the blast correct to protect your son?” Dr. Dessie asked them.
Tony stood taking off the machines. “I will be fine. Let’s go get home.” He grabbed his sons and husbands hands walking out of the hospital room.
“Have to be. I have to play. I have to go here. I must. It’s like how you have to be king. I have to play here.” Violet told him. “Jarvis was supposed to get Happy to bring my dress. Come to the back with me as far as you can…”
Steve dropped the plates shattering them, but he didn’t care he jumped over the shards and ran down the stairs into the lab. Bruce was hot on his heels right behind him.
“How about we fix that right now? As long as your okay with it.” Steve asked him and started kissing Tony up and down his neck.
