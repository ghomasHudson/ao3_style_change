-Few reminders I forgot so say in previous chapters: here, Steve does not fight Peter in Berlin. I'll do a one shot with that situation in the near future, but he didn't do it, for now /Steve didn't know it was Bucky the murderer of the Starks, he only knew it was HYDRA..
PLEASE leave a comment with your answer, and telling me what you thought of the chapter! Also, leave kudos if you can/want!
So, hi! This chapter was a bit shorter, but it felt good this way. This chapter also opens new storylines you guys will see, pretty soon.
Sorry for not posting yesterday, but I was flying back home! And it feels good to be back! So, now that I'm back, we're going back to the European-time posting schedule.
PLEASE leave a comment below telling me what you thought, thank you so much for reading and leave kudos if you can/want!
“And we’re glad to hear that” Abeer nodded “, what both of your minds are able to create will always be needed. But with her away from the wing for now to focus on Wakanda, what will the next step for the wing be?”
“Not good” she admitted “. You know Peter, Pepper… he’s going to bottle up his feelings, try to convince us he’s completely okay”
-JARVIS exists in this story -thus, Vision does not-, but Ultron happened. You can imagine how they defeated him, I guess. Okay, enjoy the story!
That being said, PLEASE leave a comment telling me your thoughts on this one shot and if you have any ideas for future ones! Also, leave kudos if you can/want to! (PS: omg, how amazing was Captain Marvel AND the trailer(s) for Endgame and Far From Home?)
“Sure thing” Michelle nodded “. Tell Shuri to come along, I’ll need someone to balance all the nerd in the room”
now, we are getting really close to the end, which is bittersweet, although I want to work on a few stories once I'm done with this one (not in this au, start new stories from scratch), so I'm excited about that.
Please leave a comment so I know what you thought of this chapter, and thank you so much for reading!
“He’s not okay” Cho finally said “, but he’s strong, guys, okay? I’m taking him into surgery right now - I promise I’ll take care of him”
PETER FINALLY KNOWS WHO HIS PARENTS ARE!  Gosh, I was dying to post this, although I'm scared to do so, too. So, PLEASE tell me what you guys thought.
This was the shorter part, the next one will be longer! I hope you enjoyed it, and always tell me if you want something specific to be in here! And again, I'll ramble about Endgame in my next story, which I will post on Wednesday if you want t talk about it
Quick note: I'm gonna start posting the one-shots as singular posts. I'll post some of the old ones, and then I'll stop posting new one-shots. If you want to see something in those, please feel free to tell me your ideas! Can't tell when it'd be up, but I'll try my best!
To be quite honest, Peter had talked to Shuri about his feelings only a couple of months after his birthday, when things were clearer in his head and when he knew the words he’d spoken with his parents were truer than ever. Shuri had taken them okay, admitting her own feelings were confusing… and that had been it for a long while, pretty much until she’d told him she had to move back to Wakanda.
hope you enjoyed the chapter and also, fun fact: I just completely changed the next chapter's ending, so... that's fun lmao.
I hope you enjoy this chapter! Make sure you read the notes at the end, I'm going to ask something pretty important for the story... the hypothetical sequel of this story depends of your answers!
“Karen?” Peter frantically asked, breathing labored but choosing not to think too much about it “Karen, tell me Harry’s vitals”
As I said, I'm gonna try to be more constant with the updates, but I can't promise anything. I'll try, I promise.
“I did” Peter confirmed, knowing his Uncle had most likely told his father about their training to subtly tell Steve the youngest superhero was going through something… Peter doubted Bucky had said anything other than that “. I came by the Tower early, needed to get some steam off”
Soooooo.... the Superhusbands have finally seen Peter in person, huh? Even if he doesn't know his parents were there. For now, both of them wants to talk to Bucky, so that's already something.
I hope everyone is doing good and is safe. The world's crazy right now and it feels a bit weird publishing like nothing's happening, but writing takes my mind off things. Please, everyone: stay home, STAY SAFE, wash your hands as much as possible (and during at least 20 seconds - a quick trick is singing the bridge of Oops I did it again... works for me, lmao) and try not to touch yourself too much. And, also, try to not come in contact with older people, or do so as less as you can. It's for their safety.
“So it could be plausible they knew the way to stop Peter’s healing system,” Shuri said, arriving at the same conclusion as Tony. The genius nodded to her words, both feeling satisfied for arriving at a conclusion and worried about the subject being Peter.
Spider-Man. As for Peter Parker? Well, the Sinister Six (as he had dubbed them) were going to have a new version of Green Goblin, ready to surprise attack the idiot on his (hopefully) final battle… but they also had Harry Osborn, who would make sure Peter thought he’d gone back to what they had - and if not back, as close as possible.
Please review! Love you 3000! (also, I'm kinda writing a new -and shorter- story, so, yeah... it'll take a while, but it's slowly being written hehe)
After those first movements, the battle seemed to happen much faster. Harry was fighting with everything he had, throwing punches to try to hit Spider-Man and using as many gadgets and traps as he could. But he was forgetting Peter was an Avenger, that he’d been a superhero for almost a decade by that point and had an A.I that could help him in noticing the pattern of the other’s attacks. Still - it was hard. It was hard to see all the hate behind every punch, every hit, everything Green Goblin was throwing his way. Everything in Peter was telling him to not fight back, to help his former friend, to let him know he was worth it, to try to get him to understand his father’s actions didn’t have to ruin his life. But he knew that, deep down, it was too late for that.
It did so even more when, only ten minutes after coming into the room Peter started to come to, breaths quicker than before and starting to move his limbs just as if he was still fighting someone. Steve moved so he was at the other side of the bed, and then Tony and he put each a hand on one of Peter’s shoulders, gently pressing their kid to the bed.
“I didn’t think you were this deluded” Harry laughed from above him “. But I guess this just proves what my father believed was right. You are not the hero you want us to believe - you’re just a pathetic, sad little kid who thought could be on the big league”
“Yeah” Peter nodded “. And I guess, if we have to be totally honest here… it hurt because you are my ex-girlfriend, after all, so… it felt even worse”
“Dads” he smiled, walking towards them. Both his parents smiled at the sight of him and quickly walked until they were close enough to engulf him in a hug. Peter let himself be protected by them, feeling for just a moment he was fifteen again and still willing to believe they could protect him from anything “. Figured you’d both be here”
“Point is” Doctor Octopus interrupted them “, that has been broken, and we’ve successfully made him quit”
Peter sighed at her question, looking away for a good minute until he looked back at her. At that moment, MJ realized it’d been a while since she’d seen Peter that vulnerable around her, probably since Chicago. Even when they’d hung out after her return to the city, Peter had been keeping a lot to himself “. Look, MJ… it’s nothing bad per se, but I… I meant what I said before, about going to therapy. I want to make things better, to finally be
“I fear you’re right with that one,” Steve said, sighing. The Doctor was right, as much as it pained him; if it was his doing he would’ve kept his son safe and ignorant for a long time, but… Peter would have never allowed so. May put a reassuring hand on his bicep then, squeezing gently.
Hope you guys loved it. Please, leave comment and, if you really liked it, kudos! Really makes me want to keep going. I'll see you guys soon, bye!
Not gonna lie, I'm not sorry for this cliffhanger either, it was too good of an opportunity haha. I really hope you enjoyed this chapter, btw, I was nervous about posting it.
ALSO, I was thinking about creating a TELLONYM? Just for you guys to ask doubts if you want, and a way for you guys to show me ideas, or whatever... anyways, tell me what you think about it. For now, though, enjoy the chapter!
The three heroes nodded, all too shocked to do anything else, and watched as Cho took Peter away, helped by other doctors that were going to help her during surgery. They stayed like that for a few minutes, until Tony stepped out of his suit and they went to the waiting room they had installed in there, all in tense silence.
A few hours later, Shuri was considerably less mad at Peter. Still some, just less than before, which was heavily related to the truth Peter had finally told her, telling her from that last fight with Norman to the battle the night before. He didn’t share the fight between Harry and him, nor the last conversation he had had with his late friend, but Shuri was not going to press him on that. She knew how hard it’d been, and it hadn’t been a full day yet; Peter was still running on some adrenaline, and most likely shock, so he wasn’t fully processing everything that had happened. The genius didn’t want her friend to enter a damaging state of shock, to go further into the rabbit hole he was surely trying to fit into (his fathers and everyone that loved him trying desperately to make it small enough to make it impossible for him to get inside), but she was going to keep an eye on Peter, to make sure he had someone to talk about those moments once he was ready to do so.
Next chapter is here! Hope you guys enjoy this one, I personally really like it. Oh and btw, just a random question: what's your opinion of the GotG vol.3? Do you guys think they'll find a solution soon?
“Oh wow” Harley deadpanned “, here we have two mature adults with great potential for their futures - truly outstanding”
“Lena has helped me understand something… it’s been a long while since I’ve been completely okay. She theorised, and I agreed, that some of my problems started the moment Ben was shot. And we also agreed you guys helped me heal from that”
I really hope you guys enjoyed the chapter! Next one will be on Saturday, because I can't post on Wednesday, sorry. Anyway, I've been thinking about doing a third story... some of you guys have asked me about FFH, but I don't know about it... do I do FFH or do I do another work, completely different? Or do I just do the one-shot and short stories in this AU? PLEASE, help me out.
“Then what is it?” The brunette asked, confused. Peter sighed, messing with his hair for a moment before taking another deep breath.
“Pete, you can do that later” Tony promised “, right now we have to fight these assholes who thought they could mess with our family, alright?”
I hope you guys enjoyed the chapter! And sorry for the small cliffhanger haha. Question: are you going to watch FFH? When? I hope to go on Saturday, so I may tell you guys what I think of it on my next author's note!
“C’mon Pep, another one?” Peter groaned, jokingly glaring at her when she laughed at him “. Hey, I just endured a
of the day she decided she wanted to completely retire. Bucky told him at least twice a week that’d never truly happen, but Peter had always been a bit pessimistic “. Most days we just did whatever we wanted and your Dads simply dealt with the disaster”
I hope you all enjoyed the chapter! I decided to give you a little bit of fluff before all the angst. Quick heads up: Ned and May will have their moments pretty, pretty soon, so... be prepared, that's all I'll say ;)
“I sure hope so” Tony sighed again “, and I think you’re right. I also… I think this may be bigger than we realize.
“I’d be livid if that happened to me,” Harley said, smile big enough to make Peter want to kill him. One thing was for certain; Harley would’ve made an
“I know” the superhero whispered, casting his eyes down once again and playing with a thread of the soft blanket Tony had dropped over him a few minutes before, despite being in the middle of the summer.
Please make sure to leave a comment so I know what you think of the story so far! Every time I feel down I read one of your comments and feel better!
“Oh, that’s for sure, yeah… but, anyway, I know they’re happy I’m back in the Tower. They feel I’m safer there, and so they feel a bit calmer, I guess. Besides, I’m moving with Harley, so that should be fun”
Tony and Steve knew they had made the right choice, by giving Peter away, but... is everything going to be fine?
So, serious talk right now. I don't know how many of you are in college, but if you are, then you know right now it's a shitty time, especially in Canada. The end of the semester is coming, and that means papers and tests and other things equally as boring and horrible. For me, I'm going back to my country once this semester finishes (I chose to have one semester now and one next year, to try to go to different places), so that means it's extra stressful for me, because I have to at least pass all my classes in order favorite I'm in.
, and I have to think about becoming the leader of the Avengers in a few years, and I have to think about figuring out the mess I made at S.I and expanding even more the new wing. We have to stop thinking about us as a couple and just… give that chapter of our lives closure. If something else ever happens, then… that could be organic, right? It could be because it’s meant to be”
“I was saying… I’ll have to recruit New Avengers soon… which made me think about something else, about
Peter looked at his Dad then, who was already looking at him, both unworldly agreeing with Steve. But, just for good measure, the youngest hero had to ask Tony:
“Which is the professional thing to do” Michelle pointed out, getting laughs in agreement as a response “. However, I will say this:
“It really is” Bucky nodded “, and I’m so proud of you, James. Now… is it okay if I let Shuri into the room? She’s been sick with worry”
I actually don't know when I'm going to see it. I know I have it kind of hard this weekend because I have to study way too much, but idk. Also, I can't go to any cinema, because I want to watch in it's original version, not the one my country is showing in every cinema. The voiceover is awful, and so is the translate they do of the dialogues. I hate it, and I hate I still have to wait to see it, which is ironic, because I don't want to see it, either. I want all of my faves to be alive, thank you so much. Also, I feel like I'm not emotionally prepared for the movie.
I really hope you enjoyed the first chapter of this story! I already said this is way more sad, and dramatic. Ah, I loooove drama. I really, really hope you guys love this! Tell me what you think and don't forget to leave kudos!

Harry breathed softly at that, fingers going limp in the hold they had of Peter’s upper arm and soon, the young genius heard his ex-lover’s heart stop. He didn’t move then, couldn’t bring himself to it. Instead, he rocked them back and forth, sobs finally escaping out of his body and making him convulse just slightly (although it could be thanks to shock, Peter didn’t quite know), and when someone tried to take him away then screams left his mouth; desperate, out of himself with pain for a loss he had known was sort of inevitable yet had denied it had to happen until the very last second. Still, Bucky took him away from Harry, knowing his nephew had to let go.
“Why would I?” He asked then “. I have everything I need in New York. My life’s here… my Dads, May, Bucky, the rest of the family, Spider-Man… you and Ned, and Flash and Harley. My whole life is in New York, and after everything I’ve been through I can’t give that up”
“Hey there Petey Pie” Steve said as he approached him, hugging his kid gently to his body and kissing his forehead. Tony stepped in after his husband, repeating his actions and still keeping an arm around Peter’s shoulders while the four men walked to the elevator.
“Did you really think we wouldn’t come to help you out once we figured what you were trying to do?” Tony asked, mask retracting for the conversation.
Btw, THE NEW AVENGERS: ENDGAME TRAILER... OMGGGG I was -still am- shook. My God, it was short but it was freaking a-ma-zing!
He hadn’t seen his friends outside of the Avengers & Affiliates yet, but he wasn’t too surprised about it; ever since the explosion the security of the Tower had been higher than ever, and also: Peter wasn’t a fool. He knew his father was incrementing the security of the Tower to give Peter an excuse to use with his friends, knowing his son wouldn’t be up to interact with them either way. Peter was silently grateful for that.
Not so much to say, except that this is one of my favourite stories... and, REALLY IMPORTANT, read the note I just wrote just above this one. I need to know to know how I continue this story!!
PLEASE leave comments and tell me what you thought of the chapter, and leave a suggestion for the new team name! I'll use the best one!
“Okay,” both men nodded, curious as to what Peter had to say. And, in truth, Peter knew he could wait. But he also wanted to start living without any type of lie, without keeping things from his fathers, and the only way to do so was to tell them everything that he’d told Bucky… including the real reason he’d distanced himself from them, two years back. So, he started to tell them: tell them about Norman’s confession, tell them he’d been behind the attacks he had suffered, back when he was a baby, tell them Norman was the reason Peter had had to grow up away from his parents. He told them that he’d gotten away from them because he’d been too guilty, too ashamed of having let someone like Norman drive his parents and him away. That he’d let the guy responsible for his adoption destroy his family, once again. He told them he was sorry, he told them he was still ashamed of his actions, but he also told them how much he loved them and cared for them and just wanted them to be okay.
I posted a new one shot in my other story, so if you haven't done it yet, check it out! It's filled with angst and drama, which, as you guys can probably guess by now, I love. Anyway, on with the story! Enjoy the chapter!
The chapter is shorter than usual, but I gave it to you guys sooner than usual, too. If you guys like the longer chapters better, then tell me and I'll probably change it, again (probably, idk)
Today I did an exam I'd been preparing for WEEKS! I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders... anyway, the moment I was done, I mapped out the rest of the book, which I can confirm it'll have 66 chapters. Maybe there's one more, who knows... depends on writing and editing. I'm also trying to think about the sequel and what I want to happen in it. Do you guys still want me to do it?
“I wasn’t expecting anything else” Peter laughed, breaking the hug to be able to look at his Dads in the eyes. Both were looking at him with soft yet worried eyes, smiles big enough to be concerning but small enough to be genuine.
PLEASE tell me in the comments what you thought, and IMPORTANT question now: do you want Peter to end up with Shuri, or with Michelle? Answer down below!
PLEASE leave a comment and kudos if you can and/or want. Also, I like the questions and answers thing, so... how many languages do you speak? I'm curious
to do it better, so bit by bit MJ had lost practice. Now it seemed like she had caught up with everything she’d missed, which sometimes was still a bit unnerving, but only because sometimes it seemed like she was reading his mind. Just like a couple of days after his talk with Shuri, when the journalist had dragged him downtown for some coffee- although, Peter knew better. MJ wanted to distract him.
“Shuri told us some of your friends had gone to the apartment” Steve chimed in, resting a comforting hand in his son’s shoulder “, and Harley told us he thought you were decently okay, but we want to know first hand… how are you, Honey?”
HI! Sorry for taking so long, I had some crazy days haha. Well, this is a requested one-shot, so I hope you guys like it!
“How are you, J?” Bucky asked, as kindly as his voice allowed. Peter lost his smile then, knowing his Uncle had been the one to take him away from Harry, that it’d been Bucky (once again) the one to see him at his very worst. Because of exactly that, Peter knew he could be completely honest with his Uncle, tell him everything he hadn’t dared to tell his parents to not worry them.
“I know he can do this” the engineer interrupted him “, I’m not saying otherwise. It doesn’t stop me from feeling like something bad’s gonna happen”
I hope you liked it! Be sure to check out my new story, which you can find if you click on the 'next work' in the series! It's called 'Those Little Moments!
“Is that even possible?” Steve asked, looking more distraught than a minute before “. How could Harry have that information anyway?”
PLEASE comment what you thought about the chapter and the first encounter between the guy and Peter! Also, if any of you has any idea of who could it be, feel free to tell me!
“Maybe, yeah” Tony agreed, trusting the Princess’ brilliant mind “. Cho also told us the knife that stabbed Peter had some venom on it - so my theory is that whatever Harry put in there it was to stop Peter’s healing system, to make it so Peter would die before his system could do something about it”
The story it's going to be multi-chapter, but I actually don't know if I should publish them all here or make another story, like, out of here, and actually make it a little bit longer. It's up to you guys! So, tell me at the end of this chapter, and also at the end of the second chapter! Then I'll decide. I know this can be taken as a one shot, but it's a larger story, I promise. You can start to vote now, but don't forget to tell me at the end of the second chapter, because it's when the real story really starts! Can't say what happens tho, because I want it to kind of be a surprise.
“Knowing that is the first step, Pete” Tony encouraged him, nodding frantically to his words “, and we’re immensely proud of you for realizing so. Look, Baby… we know you’re hurting, and we know you’re hurting more than you can maybe express right now, or maybe more than you realize. You take after us, after all, and your Papa and I know quite a lot about ignoring our own feelings, don’t we? But we know this time around things will be different”
And then Peter let himself breathe and live in the moment. Bad things could still happen, and with all probability a new super villain was going to try to take over the world in the next month or so, but… Peter was happy. And, for the first time in a long time… he was going to take it.
So, here's why I decided to make Peter fight and defeat Scarecrow on his own: I think it was fundamental for his character to grow. Don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean things are going to be peachy after this, oh no, angst is still coming, buuuuut, I reeeally thought this was the only outcome of the story with Scarecrow. Peter needed to do this to realize some things that will be talked about pretty soon, and I just didn't want the bigger superheroes going to save Spiderman's ass. What is cool about Spidey is that he's a badass who can totally defeat guys like Scarecrow if he focuses on it (also, he did have some help from his family, thanks to the slip Wanda had about the guy's name). Anyway, yeah. That was long, but I really wanted to make it clear haha
So, a few things happened, huh? I can say almost all of the chapters 'till the end are going to be... pretty intense. You guys will see, that's for sure.
Anyway, PLEASE leave a comment so I can know what you guys thought! Also, IMPORTANT question, because I'm still trying to decide and I see you guys have different opinions.
Hope you like this chapter! A quick reminder that this '****' means it's a flashback. Also, there won't be a chapter on Saturday because I will be on a trip. Maybe I can upload it on Sunday, or not upload it at all and upload it next Wednesday. What do you guys prefer?
Peter frowned and directed his eyes to the phone, feeling his heart stop just a bit when he realized what he was reading… an article. An article was written by MJ. An article was written by MJ - and she talked about
“Thank you all for coming” Peter finally said, his voice laced with practiced confidence, way more steady than he had thought he could ever do “. I am aware my past actions have raised a lot of questions and confusion, but I hope everything is cleared up after today “another deep breath,
Hi! So, you guys convinced me to upload the last short-story as a individual work... I just posted it, so check it out! It's basically the same thing I posted here, but it has two extra-scenes at the end.
“Oh” Peter mumbled, blushing a bit at that. He hadn’t thought of MJ realizing Shuri and he were close that way, but knowing how observant the woman had always been, it made complete sense “. You know” he said, after a couple of minutes “, we agreed that staying what-ifs is the best thing for us. Her life is in Wakanda, mine is here… and neither of us can really change that”
“Anyway… Ned, I’m so sorry, but… this thing could have happened. It has happened before without me interfering, and you know that. But you know how it would never happen again?”
“Only because I have people to be there for me” he whispered. And then he moved his mouth until it was grazing the shell of Harry’s ear, and whispered something else, something between the two, something final “. You can let go now, Harry. I got you, you can rest now”
Sorry to all of the people who also read my other story. I got so much into this one, and I've been focusing on write this story, not the one shots/mini-stories, so... sorry haha.
It was honestly funny to me to see how many people had already assumed Ned had told May. He may be upset, but he's still Peter's friend and a loyal one. Things are still rough with him, but he wouldn't do something like that to Peter.
After the chat with his Uncle in the gym, and after enjoying some breakfast made by Sam (who pointedly ignored Bucky and Peter having a continuous silent conversation), Peter changed into some discreet clothes and borrowed one of the cars his Dad had for when he was trying to not get spotted, figuring he could do with as much precaution as he could get.
“Peace” Steve said, intervening. He was smiling though, happy when he saw his dream being a reality right in front of him “, you two can act like children after we eat dinner”
So I was stuck with that idea, and then I had an epiphany... this book was about Peter's journey, and a part of that was his journey with mental health and having healthy relationships. So, I decided PeterxTherapy sounded pretty damn good... at least for now.
“Well, I for one am glad you are staying in New York, P,” Michelle said, once their laughs had calmed down a bit, grabbing Peter’s hand and squeezing it softly “. Will you stay in Queens though?”
“They are” Peter confirmed “, although they’re trying to not show it too much, but they’re failing miserably. And I guess it’s nice to see, you know? I know they’ll always support me and will be okay with where I decide to live”
“What do you mean?” Peter asked, tilting his head. MJ shrugged this time, sipping some of her own coffee before answering.
“Sure” MJ nodded, letting Peter close the apartment door. Crossing her arms across her chest, she let herself observe one of her best friends, the one person she knew she’d always feel something for. Now, Michelle was anything but an idiot, so she knew Peter was putting on a brave face in front of his friends, as much as he could also admit he wasn’t okay. The journalist suspected not even Peter was aware of how things were, but… she could also guess that was normal. Sometimes time and perspective were necessary for the mind to find peace. So, when Peter took her to the living room, she sat and looked at him in silence for another minute, finally breaking the silence when it was obvious Peter was not going to do it himself “. So, everything okay? What did you want to talk about?”
Bucky and Sam simply laughed at her retrieving form and then redirected their eyes to look at their nephew, tired yet content smiles on their faces.
“And they’d complain about it like kids” May completed, laughing fondly at the memory. It was wild to think that, out of everyone in that little family, only Peter and she were left. And still… “. And look at us now, kiddo. Now we have this big and crazy family, and now our lives are completely different”
My favorite scene, by the way, was the talk between Shuri and Peter about his worries being valid. I really loved to write that. Also, I'm trying to get back to the one-shots, just... be patient. Alright, love you 3000!
Today I'm posting on time! To be honest, I thought I was going to be able to write more these past few days, but ever since I came back home I've been so incredibly busy. I also decided to include some scenes, so that changed the chapters a little bit.
-After Avengers and way before Winter Soldier... you'll see what I mean by 'way before', but... yeah. Don't know if I'll touch the subject of Iron Man 3.
No need to ask me if I forgot part of the chapter- it really ends there, and I admit it was a little evil... sorry.
Dude I'm sad af... don't know if anyone here is a fan, but David Dobrik and Liza Koshy broke up? They still love each other but now is not the right time? TF?
“Dude, I want Ned to come to S.I, too, but you’re straight up going to manipulate him into doing so,” he said, going over to the kitchen to grab himself a beer and sitting next to Harley. Peter stuck his tongue at him like the powerful man he was and ignored MJ’s laugh.
“I have no idea, he literally went limp in my arms,” Bucky said, losing the calm he always showed in battle.
Peter looked a whole lot better than a few hours before, his healing system thankfully starting to work and making his cheeks have a little more color, and his breaths not be as elaborated as they’d been. He still looked battered, face and arms decorated with healing cuts and still visible cuts, but to know he was going to be okay calmed both parents.
First: please, don't kill me. I know it was a bit of a cliffhanger, BUT, in my defence, I already said a couple of times I was going to end some chapters in cliffhangers. Yeah, sorry not sorry. Us, the writers, find pleasure in things as little as those, lmao.
“I don’t know… how can’t it be?” Peter asked, finally his voice cracking with less hidden emotion (still some, Bucky was not naïve enough to believe otherwise) “. Today is… well, important. Ever since it happened,
… maybe not bring back, but talk? Just talk, just make sure they were okay… he guessed death took that from you, some security, some comfort, the feeling of everything being okay, of
I really hope you guys looooove this chapter, please leave kudos and COMMENTS because I love them and they motivate me SO much
“I’m going to miss you, you know” the superhero of the two had said, leaning on Shuri’s bedroom door while observing her make her suitcase. The Princess had sighed, folding another shirt before looking back at Peter.
we could work, rather than ourselves without the other, if that makes any sense. And right now you have to think about your career and try to not be
And now Peter understood some of his Uncle’s words. He needed to trust his parents, and he needed to let go of the past, of everything he’d done wrong - harsh truth was that he could not change anything that had happened as much as he could hate that; the key was to learn how to live with it, and even grow from and with it. He guessed it was similar to what his parents had gone through when giving him up (vaguely similar, but maybe a little bit), knowing there was no way of changing what had happened, knowing the only option for them was to move forward and hope their decision had been the right one.
After this story I'll post one shots you guys have been asking me, but give me some time. As I said, I'm focusing on the story, first. However, if you have any idea, feel free to tell me, and I'll do it whenever I can. Meanwhile, PLEASE tell me what you thought in the comments and leave kudos if you can!
Fun fact: it was at the end of this chapter that I was completely stuck. Before I had even written it I knew I was not happy with it, so the end is the first big change I made to this book. Once you read it, I'll explain more... and of course, I'll explain my initial plan once the book's done.
“Just like it wasn’t yours” Tony pointed out “. But we… I… I should’ve behaved differently, better. I should’ve tried to see the reason behind your change in behavior, I should’ve insisted when you drew away after Norman’s death… and for that I am sorry”
“Yeah, I figured he would” the superhero softly laughed at the image of Bucky Barnes going all overprotective and mother hen, probably with Steve right behind him, staring at whoever that thought about discussing Bucky’s point. It was also possible Tony was behind Steve, ready to blast anyone who insisted on talking about what had happened. It was sweet, if only a bit psychotic. But Peter could appreciate that “. Do you mind if we stay here for a bit longer though? Being here is really helping clear my mind some”
“Yeah man, we all have” Flash pointed out. Peter smiled softly at them and exchanged looks with Shuri, who subtly arched an eyebrow in a silent question. The superhero nodded almost imperceptibly at that, which was all the slightly older genius needed to step aside to let the small group of friends in. Ned went almost running to Peter, although he did stop a foot away from him, unsure of Peter’s physicality. The slightly taller man laughed at his best friend’s tact and closed the distance between them, engulfing his oldest friend in a bone-crushing hug. Ned hugged back enthusiastically, hiding his face in the crook of Peter’s neck and fisting the genius’ t-shirt.
As for IW... a lot of you have given me support, and some of you even ideas. So, it's not like I can confirm I'll do it, but I'm going to think about it, definitely. And I'll tell you what I decide soon enough.
This is not the end! Don't forget two years have passed, so obviously going back to "normal" is not going to be easy... I just wonder: do you guys want the third part Sunday or Monday?
I'll try to have the next chapter super soon, I promise. I'm planning a new book too, which is taking a bit of my time, but I'm trying to write more these days.
So sorry I didn't post yesterday, a few friends managed to convince me to go out, and I came home really, really late, and I didn't want to post then. Still, I wanted to post a chapter this weekend, so here it is.
“Hey, little punk” Bucky greeted him, already dressed to accompany his nephew to the press conference “. Everyone’s on their way, only your parents are still here, but we figured you’d prefer it that way”
Also, please leave a comment and tell me what you thought of this chapter, and thank you so much for reading!
“For when you want to escape from your crazy family?” The journalist asked through a laugh “. Honey, they can very well go to Queens”
Peter fought with everything he had, knowing he wasn’t doing half a bad job - Vulture and Scorpio were getting tired, sloppier, but more desperate. On the other hand, Harry (Green Goblin, Peter knew he had to call Harry by that name now) was barely fighting, but merely watching the superhero get beaten up and growing increasingly worried when Spider-Man kept fighting back, and starting to win. The worrisome expression on his face didn’t last long though, because soon enough the rest of the clique came to the rescue, clearly mad about having been fooled as well. And, well… then it was six versus one. Which, factually, wasn’t ideal. And it was less because the three that had came then were the ones meant to fight him in the first place, the ones who had defeated him before - the ones powerful enough to do so again, especially if it was in a group of six.
Third chapter! I really hope you guys are liking the chapters.... someone asked me the other day when exactly does this happen, so:
Hi! So, so, so, so sorry for being this late! I know I told you guys about the trip, but I still promised a chapter last week! But, I came home from Venice ( and, yeah, I spent the whole trip thinking that I was in the same spot they'd filmed FFH... I kept looking for the spots we've seen in the trailer, lol) on Tuesday and on Wednesday was my first day of class! So I didn't have time to write, and the first week was fun and stressful, and I saw a lot of people I hadn't seen in months, due to me spending the first semester in Toronto... so yeah, I was quite busy.
An important question right here: do you guys want shorter chapters, but more often, or larger chapters and not that regularly?
“Then maybe there’s a reason to it” the super soldier said, smiling too sweetly at his beloved nephew. Peter scoffed at him, a bit less playful but still some, and let Bucky move him to another station, both wordlessly agreeing to train for some time before getting to talk. Peter knew his Uncle, and he
“Peter is stronger- he’s not the same kid he was back then. And most importantly: we have his back… we know how broken our family was after Norman’s death, we know we don’t want - nor can- go back to that, so… whatever happens we’ll have his back. And I think Peter knows that this time around”
Now, I don't want to tire you guys all out with this A/N (and who knows if someone even read it), but: I didn't post on Wednesday because I was trying to spread the word about BLM in my other socials. Now that I am posting here, I think I should do the same thing here, because, no matter the size, I do have a platform. So: if you want to go and protest, do it, but please, be safe. I can't go, mainly because there are no protests where I live (again, not in the US, or even America). But there are other ways in which you can help.
At least Michelle hadn’t published confidential information, like ever had been fearing (the conversation between Shuri, the journalist and him after one attack really present in his mind), but that would also likely mean a suing issue, especially if Pepper got a hold of it. Still, Peter could appreciate it - he knew Michelle’s would have benefited from it if she had done it, although it could have, potentially, ruined their friendship. However, there
Peter nodded with a small smile. It’d taken a while, but he finally was accepting his Aunt’s words. And it didn’t exactly feel bad. That didn’t completely erase his stress, though, and Natasha was able to see that, so she gestured for them to get going, which Peter obliged, following her through the corridors of the Avengers Compound.
Two big things: we finally know who the guy is! I changed his story a bit, and it'll be show next chapter, to adapt it to this Universe, but I hope you guys like it! Two, there's a bit of Spideychelle for all of the people who were asking it, or loving the blossoming relationship between those two! There's gonna be something between them, that's for sure... the romance, however, I don't know if it'll be in this book or in the sequel... I really wanted to show their friendship, as you all know.
I really hope you guys enjoyed the chapter! I also posted a one-shot, the other day, so check it out!
Peter laughed at that, but still toasted with his family, watching how Sam and Bucky bickered over everything and anything and still looking at each other like there was no one else in the room, watching Clint and Natasha banter about Clint’s still secret protege (up until Clint’s kids reclaimed their time with their Auntie), Thor and Loki half-arguing like true brothers, with Bruce trying to be the mediator. He watched Wanda and Vision, a bit in their own world, watched his Aunt May and Happy, who finally was honouring his name and who made his wife incredibly happy. He looked at his Dads, at how they in love they were, how much at peace they seemed.
But, to make that happen, he needed to focus on the present. He had to focus on the matter at hand… which was the five villains looking directly at him, expecting some words… which, admittedly, was only a
I know Tony could've reacted a whole lot worse. And, maybe he would've, but only if this was a story about The Winter Soldier. However, this is a Superfamily story, a Peter and Tony and Steve story, and I didn't want to make ten chapters out of this.
“It’s okay, Dad” Peter whispered, finally feeling like some things were snapping back into place. Of course, there were some others that were never going back, or at least that were never going to fit like they once used to, but Peter had learned, with time, that life was a bit like that; coming together and coming apart, souls and bodies breaking to then mend, a little broken but stronger than before. It was as sad as it was beautiful. Steve cleaned his face from any trace of tears and looked at his boys with a fond expression on his face.
“But this has to be something big, right?” Flash asked, speaking for everyone there “. It feels like something big is about to happen - did Peter quit or what the fuck is happening?”
It’d been a while since the Penthouse had been that silent, or filled with silent and rapidly growing tension, which Steve understood- it’d been a while since Tony and he had felt like their son was truly in trouble, and they couldn’t do a thing, not really, just… wait for something else to happen. He knew Peter was the best combination possible of his husband and him, but alas, a parent never stops worrying, right? That’s what people told him all the time - and the blond had realized, a while before, just how true those words were.
Also, as for the Avengers, I got majority of BuckyxSam and a couple of BuckyxNat, so keep telling me what you want to see... and with the other Avengers as well.
“How are you doing?” She asked, smiling softly at him while grabbing one of the glasses and sipping tea in an attempt to calm herself down, which Peter could see right through. The superhero sighed and drank some of his own tea before answering.
Peter forced himself out of bed, showering before going back to the kitchen to drink some coffee, aware of his inability of eating anything at all. The young genius went back to his room before anyone else could go to the kitchen to try to convince him to have some solid breakfast, changing into one suit he knew he looked good in and wasn’t too uncomfortable. He kept it a bit informal, choosing to forego a tie, and carefully styled his hair, choosing to focus on his grooming to stop himself from obsessing over other things.
Peter nodded, thinking his Papa’s words through. He knew, and he’d known for a while… his therapist and Uncle had been telling him for months “. I think I started fooling around with Harry because it was easy” he confessed after a while, almost managing to startle his parents; he’d been so silent “, so
Also, I really hope everyone's okay and taking care of themselves. Please remember a pandemic is still going on - so be safe. I'm lucky enough no one I know (nor myself) has been affected by it in a huge way (knock on wood), but still- it is very scary.
I hope you liked this chapter! I really liked to write the superfamily scene, and I don't know why, but I also really enjoyed to write the scene between Pepper and Peter. And the one between Harry and Peter- I really like their banter.
“Peter, honey, drop it” MJ said, letting some of the amusement tint her words. She looked at the other two boys and extended her hand “. I said Ned would realize it under five minutes, pay up suckers”
Another chapter! I hope you like it! Btw, the Oscars have finally acknowledged Marvel! Honestly, if Infinity War doesn't win for visual effects I will riot. Anyway, enjoy the chapter!
Still, it meant that three years since Peter had lost Harry he felt like he was finally ready to find someone and settle down. He was in no rush in any type of way, but it was something that was present in his mind. After all, he was around the same age Steve had been when he’d gotten together with Tony, and that was something
Admittedly, Peter had had worse nights. He, also, had had a whole of a lot better nights, but still- he’d slept. Some. At least more than the previous nights, which maybe was thanks to his Uncle, or maybe thanks to the confessions he’d managed to get out of Peter. The young superhero had to admit it’d felt good to say out loud everything he’d been keeping to himself for the last few years, and everything he’d feared, and doubted himself about. Granted, it didn’t mean his problems were solved (far from it, actually), but it did mean things were starting to get better.
“And I guess I’m thankful for that” Michelle nodded “. I’d rather have you do it than have you pretend you didn’t care or weren’t hurt”
“And I’m going to miss you, too, P, way too much,” she said, smiling sadly at her best friend. Peter sighed at that, too, and moved inside the room, going to sit at one small couch Shuri had right under her window and quickly being joined by said girl.
“Definitely thinking about it” Peter confessed, hearing how some audience members not so subtly gasped and squealed at that “. I mean, I’m closer to thirty than I am to twenty now, and as everyone on Twitter likes to remind me, my Papa was close to my age when my Dad and he started dating, so… it’s something I’m not opposed to. But I’m still young, so no rush, you know?”
“We’ll work on it” Shuri promised, grabbing Peter’s hand and squeezing it softly “. Today was an amazing first step, Peter, and I’m really proud of you for it, okay? We are all feeling proud of you… and now it’s time to take things easy and take care of yourself. I think therapy will help you a lot”
Peter huffed, punching one of the pads Bucky was offering with maybe a bit too much force, if the scoff his Uncle gave him was anything to go by “. As if you don’t have an idea already”
So, next chapter is here, and things are starting to move haha. I hope you guys like it! Also, PLEASE leave a comment! I really want to know if you guys like this or not!
Hope you guys liked the chapter! Peter thinks he has found the safe spot, so let's see if his right in the next chapter!
“Now… I heal, I guess” the young superhero shrugged “. I’m not going to lie, this… this is going to take a while. I feel… I feel exhausted, guys. These past few months have put me through a lot, and I just…”
“I want to say that, despite the last few months of his life, Harry Osborn was not a bad person. His behavior was nothing but a desperate attempt of healing, a call for help. Harry was grieving his father and did some unforgivable things in order to cope. I am in no way asking for his forgiveness, but I don’t want his last actions to darken everything he did. As for the rumors about his death, I can confirm he died after a fight with Spider-Man, in which he accidentally stabbed himself with his own weapon, as many could observe in the live footage of the battle. I will not answer further than that, as I consider any questions about Harry Osborn’s passing cruel and morbid”
“I’m stopping you. Stopping all of you, actually, and putting an end on this non-sense. For months you’ve been terrorizing New York and making me feel like I was failing my people- but this is the end to it. This has to be the end, Harry”
ALSO, REALLY IMPORTANT: I'm still deciding the pairings. Surely, Tony and Steve are staying together, and I have Peter's down as well, I think, but I don't totally know about the others, so tell me what you want.
“We have some meetings in Berlin, right after Christmas” Peter shrugged “. I’ll explain more later, but I can’t give you the details just yet… Pepper told me details are meant for the meeting”
The days, however, seemed to pass by quickly, and before Peter wanted the day of the press conference had come. He’d woken up pretty soon in his room back at the Tower (in the Penthouse rather than his own floor), having chosen to stay there for the last few days to get a better mindset and to have his family close. Shuri had stayed at the Tower, too, in the Penthouse’s guest room.
Now, the BIG change... this chapter was going to end with Peter realizing his feelings for one of the two girls, going to her and kissing her, closing that 'who will Peter be with by the end of the book?', but it just... felt really, really wrong, for a long time. And then I realized why: there's no need for an actual romantic interest here other than 'oh well, it has to be one'. Why? Because.
“It’s clever, guys, not manic,” he said, trying to defend himself. They heard a scoff and watched Flash coming out of the elevator, looking at Peter judgementally.
“Please, try not to do something like this in at least a couple of years” the journalist whispered “. I really thought we could lose you, P, and it felt like hell”
“Dad” Peter cried, watching as his Dad pushed Harry away and rushed to Peter’s side, putting his hands on his shoulders and helping him stand up. Steve was there a second after, helping his husband and making sure their son was okay “. Papa, what are you doing here?”
Gosh, I'd missed the angst haha. By the way, has anyone seen Captain Marvel? I still have to see it, and I've heard mixed reviews!
I really hope you enjoyed the chapter! The idea of this new team came to me and I really, really liked it. Do you guys? Actually, exciting thing: you guys get to decide the name of the team! Suggest them to me in the comments and I'll pick the best one!
Thank you if you've read the whole thing. The world needs light now, and help, and we can all do something about it <3 (aaalso, if I have to read someone saying 'All Lives Matter'... then please, just don't comment. I don't want to read that.
Hope you enjoyed! I know it's shorter than what I usually upload, but this is a short story. There'll be more chapter than usual, but shorter. Hopefully I can upload soon. I don't know how many chapters are going to be, but I hope you liked this first one!
Gosh, sorry about the absence! I didn't want to disappear for as long as I did, but finals and essays and moving back home to finish my year was keeping me busy. Anyway, I'm so glad to be back! So here's another chapter :)
it was going to be hard, and even when he knew he was pretty fucking broken at the moment…he knew things were going to get better with time.
Don't worry, it's a two-part story, so the next one should be coming soon! Probably on Monday, don't know yet for sure. I hope you all liked this first part!
Steve hummed, thinking his husband’s words over in his head. He could understand him - of course he could, as seeing Peter in pain while unable to do something about it was on the top five of Steve’s worst moments (although nothing was going to top that brief but excruciating period of time he thought his boys had died while in space, that was for sure), but things had changed since then.
“Depends” Peter smiled, and then he looked at his Uncle “. Uncle Sam, how about you serve me just what you made?”
The small group of superheroes remained silent, arriving at the room the rest of the family in New York was to see Peter’s press conference in. None of them made a real comment about it, which Peter deeply appreciated, and instead chose to talk about mundane topics, only Pepper getting closer a couple of minutes before Peter had to leave to touch up some details, like the collar of his shirt and some strands of hair that had fallen out of place, using that brief time to remind her nephew some stuff he had to know for the press conference.
Peter, who suddenly went limp in his arms, screams dying at his throat and breath more elaborated than Bucky had first noticed. Tony and Steve arrived at his side then and looked at him in shock, noticing Peter had just fallen unconscious. Between the three they managed to lay him on the ground, away from Harry and then… they realized not all the blood had been from the taller man.
Peter rolled his eyes, smiling and, after hugging Michelle one last time, he let her go, feeling utterly at peace, and way less tense than an hour before. He realized, however, that the woman had been right about the search party, so, with a big smile, Peter left the apartment and swung to the Tower. Traffic was a bitch, anyway.
“. As the public now knows, Harry Osborn was the mastermind behind the numerous villainous attacks these past few months, not only in New York, but also in other points in the States’ geography. He became the Green Goblin Junior and lead what is now known as the Sinister Six in a mission to destroy me and, indirectly, destroy the Avengers. Now, as you all must know as well, Green Goblin and his minions were defeated a week ago, in a battle where, sadly, Harry Osborn perished”
“I think so, too” Peter nodded, playing with the little condensation at the rim of his glass “. I know it’ll be hard and I’m not gonna lie, I’m not particularly excited about the therapist, but… I know it’s what I have to do, I know I have to start taking care of myself”
So, sorry for not posting yesterday. I was celebrating my birthday (that was the 11th, but I was still in Toronto, so... I had to celebrate it now), and I didn't have time. And today I went to the cinema with my little cousin to see Mary Poppins, so... if you can, go and see it. It's so beautiful, and Lil-Manuel Miranda is a gift to this world.
, and so it wasn’t that weird that the world had ended up loving him just as much as they’d done before, if not more.
I'm so stressed (thank you finals and projects, I hate you), but writing always helps me, so yay for you guys lmao. Enjoy the chapter!
“I talked to Doctor Cho while you were in here” Shuri nodded “, and she explained more medical details to me, so I know you’re going to be okay. Still, Peter, to see you collapse like that, it… it worried me.
Alright, please leave a comment so I can know what you guys thought of this chapter! For those who read my short story, I'll try to have chapter 5 up this week!
“So he was the only one who remembered Peter Parker. Just Peter Parker” Steve completed for his son. Peter nodded with a small smile in his face.
Please tell me what you thought of this chapter, so I can know if you guys like this story. I really liked the idea of putting Flash in here, and show how much he changed. Also, there's still another kind of familiar character that you guys haven't seen yet... give them a week or two haha
Anway, PLEASE comment what you thought of the chapter! I'd love to hear from you guys again, even if it is to know if you're doing okay!
I hope you enjoyed the last chapter and do the same with this one. I thought it was gonna be short and then I've realized it's as long as the last one haha. Also, I had a bit of difficulty writing it because I've been watching a lot of Starkid (if you know what it is, kudos to you) and every time I wrote Harry I kept picturing Darren Criss lmao. Anyhow, enjoy!
So, I'm being a good girl, and I'm not leaving you guys with a huge cliffhanger, for once. I hope you guys liked the explanation I gave; there was one of you who actually came close to this, in the comments. He didn't remember Steve, per se, BUT he had the feeling he used to have when he was a baby. So, that's something.
Btw, I just saw Endgame and... oh my God. I... dude, INSANE. I love Marvel 3000. (Also, I'll rant about it in the new story I will publish on Wednesday!)
Cho was already waiting for him, an urgent look on her face, and let Tony lay Peter in a hospital bed, taking the superhero’s suit in order to inspect his injuries and forcing Tony to step back for a moment, wanting to work in peace.
“No, you don’t” Bucky disagreed, although he didn’t mean it rudely “, but you’re going to work on knowing so, okay? I think it’s good if you went back to therapy, so it can help you deal with everything that happened”
“As if you’re any better” Tony, Bucky and Peter said simultaneously. Steve just threw his hands up in the air, snickering at those men, whom had marked his life since he was a sick kid in Brooklyn, all the way to a retired man living with the love of his life in a beautiful house, with a beautiful son who was the best thing that had
“That’s my boy. I’ll leave you two to speak, but just so you know, after Shuri your Aunt May wants to come in”
Anyway, if you have any idea you'd like to see in here, you only have to tell me! I'd love to do it!
“No, I’m going to move back to the Tower… I’ll keep the apartment in Queens, it’s too good to let go anyway, and it can serve me as a me space, you know?”
the ones saving the world from them, and from any threats they may present. We’ve grown past the need of Avengers: it’s time everyone realizes that”
PS: Oh my God Tom Holland cut all of his hair. He doesn't look bad, just a bit weird. Anyway... also, this chapter is a bit longer than the last, but if you guys like it, then I guess it's fine...
Tony scoffed at that, muted by everyone else laughing at the exchange. The engineer pointed his finger at James, who was laughing almost hysterically at the father-son duo “. This is your doing, by the way. This has gotten from you”
“I know” Peter nodded with a soft smile in his face “. I’m going to start seeing the therapist I saw right after the War, she’s already talked to me and talked me through what she believes is the best course of action… despite everything going on, I think I’m starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel”
If you haven't checked it out yet, I published the work with the one-shots that are from this AU! So check them out whenever you can, and enjoy this chapter!
“Apparently the company believes in letting them do more stuff, make them believe they’re important and learning more… to the cost of my own work, of course”
I'm soooo sorry, yesterday I was sick - I think I'm having a problem with my wisdom teeth... oh, boy- and I totally forgot to upload. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
Hope you all loved it! Please let me know what you thought, because it makes my day, and keeps me going! Don't be afraid to comment!
at the kid. She wasn’t stupid; Peter had been placed in the Sexiest Man List for years, had made number one a few times, and no one could deny the kid had inherited both of his parents’ charm… now close to thirty, Abeer could affirm Peter was one of the most attractive people she got to interview, so she understood her public… didn’t share the sentiment though, as her kids were too close in age to Peter for her to be comfortable in doing so. Back to her work, though:
Please tell me what you thought of this, and also: some lovely reader asked me if I was gonna do FFH here. I don't know just yet, but what do you guys think? Should I? Thanks for reading, by the way.
Please leave a comment to let me know what you thought (think of it as a birthday present, if you may), and thank you so much for reading!
“And we keep tabs of what the workers really do” Peter confirmed “. It’s more organized this way, you know? And less upsetting when something like this happens… which has been a lot lately, hasn’t it?”
“I agree with Dumb and Genius over there, Nedo, it does suck… how can it happen though? Interns should not have that access in the first place”
“So you admit it” he said, crossing his arms over his chest. The superhero groaned and tried not to think about how much fun his Uncle Bucky was going to make of him when he found out how terribly Peter had failed (and he was gonna find out, Peter didn’t even doubt it).
for that question to exist, but the problem was… Peter wasn’t completely sure about that “. I don’t know” he’d confessed after a couple of minutes “. I care about you more than I care about a lot of people, you’re one of the closest friends I have, but… as you said, things are complicated”
Hope you're linking this so far, and thankful if you did! On with the part 2! (there's actually one more, more info at the end of the chapter)
First of all, I'm SO SORRY for not posting on Wednesday! Next week is Thanksgiving here in Canada, and we have the reading week (a.k.a, a week off), and so the teachers thought it would be super funny to charge us with a lot of homework for this past week. I spent Wednesday night doing homework for a class I had the next day (and when I say spent, I mean I was up doing stuff until four a.m). The next day I remembered I'd forgotten, but then that day I also forgot to upload it, and so I thought I'd leave it for Saturday. So, so so sorry. I hope it doesn't happen again.
“And if you don’t go to a medic your vitals won’t be looking good either,” Karen said again, this time much more urgent “. You’re only standing up due to adrenaline and your condition as a superhuman, but you will soon begin to feel real consequences of your wounds”
I don't know, I felt like I wanted to do a chronological chapter, I hope you liked it! You guys also got the introduction of Infinity War! The next book will be published next week actually, either Wednesday or Saturday (probably Wednesday). As for Endgame: I'm going to be watching it on Saturday because I am on a trip 'til Friday night, so I'll tell you guys what I think on the first chapter of the new story! No matter what I'll just keep writing and ignore it, just as I ignored IW in my one-shots, lmao.
So, the next chapter is here! I won't be able to post on Wednesday, so the next chapter will be next Saturday!
As always, thanks for reading! PLEASE leave comments, they motivate me to keep going, aaaaand leave kudos, if you want
MJ and thus, would always want her to be comfortable with herself, and happy. Always endlessly happy.
“How did my Dads do this, it’s like trying to get a bunch of hyperactive five year old to go to sleep”
Gods, he hated it. He hated to see Harry’s name there, he hated to know Harry’s body was resting there, unresponsive,
The rest of the group nodded, waiting with batted breathing for something else to happen, or for someone to help Peter. The video feed wasn’t the best quality, but they could still see the basics, and the basics were that Peter was getting seriously beaten up. He was trying, of course, and was doing a better job than they knew anyone could really do, but it was indeed six against one, and none of them playing fair. However, when all seemed lost…
“You are capable” Peter interrupted her, catching her a bit off guard. Seeing his opportunity to explain himself a bit more, Peter grabbed Shuri’s hand as firmly as he could “, and I’ve always known you are, Shuri. This wasn’t about that, this… this was about protecting you”
So he’d planned the final battle, had made sure they were not only going to attack Peter, but to destroy what he loved. He knew the Avengers had moved Upstate after hearing Peter’s news (had seen the footage and had had people actually confirming it), and he knew something that was, maybe, most important: May Parker had stayed behind, tied to her schedule as a nurse at the hospital. If Happy was still in the city he didn’t exactly know, but that didn’t matter- three villains against two defenseless civilians would be no problem, as much as Happy was an experienced bodyguard, right? More so, Peter’s secret apartment was at a distance enough for him to be too late to rescue her Aunt - not to mention Harry was sending the other three villains to that apartment, ready to attack Peter when he least suspected it, just when he’d quit Spider-Man and didn’t have his suit with him - not even
It's the last one! Hope you all enjoyed this mini-story as much as I did.  I want to know what you thought about it, but first, let's read the chapter. Enjoy!
“Alright” Peter sighed, stopping himself from toying with the neck of his shirt, way too happy about his decision to forego a tie. He did let himself run a hand through his hair, glad when he didn’t mess it up too much “. What else do we have to talk about?”
Peter had been able to be with someone else just for the sake of being, not having in mind anything but enjoying themselves and their nights (sometimes days).
“I hate when he doesn’t tell me stuff” the spy replied, frowning. Peter chuckled under his breath, and turned his head around when he heard someone else reply to the red-head.
For this chapter, I really liked the idea of exploring Peter's pov a little bit more, see how his life is. From now on, you guys will get more Peter povs, so I really hope you liked it.
“Due to overdrive” Shuri suggested “, if he had too many injuries maybe his body was still trying to decide which one to heal first”
“I wish you understood I never meant for that to happen” Peter sighed “, I just wanted to protect the city from the threat that was your father, but you never wanted to understand that. Instead you decided to turn yourself into what your father was, you… you decided to sacrifice yourself as well, Harry”
. Now he had to see if it was easy to accomplish. For the moment, Bucky was in his (real) secret apartment, much closer to the Tower than the one Peter was sure was being attacked, ready to go whatever his nephew told him.
“We don’t know for sure” Steve confessed “, but he had a serious stab wound on his stomach… Cho told us his system was not healing him, but we don’t know why”
PS: yes I've seen the new Disney+ series, and yes I'm obsessed. I prefer TFAWS, but that's just because Sam and Bucky are some of my favorites and I adore their dynamic... but God, both are incredibly good.
Ned nodded against his neck, and broke the hug, letting everyone else hug Peter as well. Harley almost threw himself at his surrogate brother, him having known a bit more than the rest thanks to Tony informing him of Peter’s state, but still worried. Michelle also hugged him tightly to her body, murmuring how big of an idiot Peter could be.
So, I'm sorry for being so inconsistent these past few weeks. Finals are still kicking my butt, but I'm done with them next Monday (hopefully), so I'll have more time. Also, there was a reason why I didn't post on Wednesday, despite having almost all of the chapter written. It is a serious topic, so if someone really feels triggered by it, enjoy the chapter!
“I know you think you’re protecting Peter, and that honors you. But right now we can’t do anything to stop him: just wait for news and hope he’s not going to kill himself in the process of whatever he’s doing. So if you can tell us what’s going on, that’d be greatly appreciated”
“He will” Steve tried to assure his love, kissing his temple “. We know our kid, he will… even though he’s as stubborn as both of us combined”
Another thing, actually an important question right here: do you guys want shorter chapters, but more often, or larger chapters and not that regularly?
“That they’ve done” Abeer said, nodding. “But how do you think they’re settling into that retired life? Are they getting used to not fighting villains every other week?”
“It’s good to see you, Honey,” Steve said, petting Peter’s cheek affectionately “. Want to sit down with us? We know maybe your little hyperactive heart implodes, but it’ll do you good”
“Eh, maybe not, but it’s fun either way. By the way, Torres says hi, told me to tell you he’ll come around Monday to talk”
So, the cliffhanger at the end of the last chapter only told you how angsty this one will be, so... enjoy!
By the end of it, Peter’s breathing was coming quickly once again, but this time was due to his tears, which quickly was making him softly sob, and his parents weren’t doing much better.
With a nod and a rather forced smile, Peter turned the mic off and stepped outside the room, feeling like all the air left his lungs the moment he stepped into the hallway. Happy was there for his nephew, putting his arms around him to help Peter walk, both pretending it wasn’t completely necessary but rather Happy being overprotective. The bodyguard walked with him to the room all the family was in and let him fall into the arms of his Dads, who told him just how great he'd been. To Peter, however, it felt like he was day-dreaming, completely disassociated from the situation, from that place and moment in time. So, with a bit of effort, the young genius thanked his fathers, and the rest of the family that had made it there, and excused himself with an excuse he knew no one was truly buying. He only gave in to his fathers’ almost insistence of letting someone else take him home, getting into a car with Happy, and only muttering a goodbye before stepping out of the car. Luckily for the superhero, none of the media knew his actual address, so there were no reporters waiting to take the first picture of Peter after the press conference.
“I can’t!” Spider-Man yelled back, and threw Green Goblin to the ground, starting to roll on the ground to force him to stay down “. And see, that’s what you’ve never understood, Harry. I can’t give it up, I can’t give anything up, you understand now? Not even if I want to, I can’t”
“Yes, you annoyingly remind me every chance you get” Harry groaned, to then put his hands on his hips “. Your point being?”
to see the joke that the Avengers are, how self-centered they are, how selfish. I’m tired of them getting applause and recognition for saving people, and yet do nothing about what they leave behind. They destroy everything and then justify it by saying they’re
“I think,” he said, more sure of his words than his Dads had thought he’d be “ it’s time I build my own. It’s time I build it from scratch, accepting the Peter I was and the Peter I am now… I have to make my ground, my very
“The streets around the Avengers Tower have been evacuated,” Harley said for an explanation, going into the apartment without waiting for Shuri to invite him - not like she minded, she knew the young man was just as worried for Peter as she was. Looking back at the rest of the group she stepped aside, letting them all go into the apartment and realizing the majority of them hadn’t even been there.
, and I guess… I guess I saw you in a way that wasn’t completely healthy, nor fair to you, I can see that now. And I’m sorry for that. And, I guess… losing you meant I had no ground to stand on, not an old familiar one anyway… but, in these past few months I’ve been trying to build another one, one from scratch, you know? One that can finally be
“Yeah” Peter whispered “, I thought things could be different this time around but… it was foolish to think so, to hope so”
“Not to mention the Avengers and Spidey stuff” Peter groaned “. I knew pulling the stunt I pulled was going to cost me, but
“Almost,” Pepper said, hiding a smile when she saw the expression in her nephew’s face, way too similar to his father’s. She couldn’t blame him though - they had been in a meeting for around four hours (edging way too close to five), and in a good day both Starks barely got through short ones, both of their minds too restless and hyperactive to stay rested for long periods of time.
I feel like my posting schedule is all over the place, for which i apologize... the last week has been crazy.
So glad to be posting again, oh my God. So, a lot of you wanted MichellexPeter, some others PeterxHarry, and a couple wanted either PeterxShuri, PeterxOC or even Peter ending this story single.  I'm still deciding, and maybe your opinions change as the book progresses, so keep telling me who you want Peter to end up with.
Harley sighed at the couple’s words, knowing they were in the right. Besides, it wasn’t like they could stop Peter… not at that point. So he explained everything to them, or at least everything Peter had told him that could be told to people. By the end, the only two surprised were Betty and Abe- the rest were only mildly surprised, and Shuri wasn’t even that. She had known Peter was planning on doing something, she just hadn’t thought it’d be
Ok, bye, see you guys soon! (and also, I know they're never gonna read this, but happy bday to Chris H -a.k.a the man- and Sebastian Stan -a.k.a the purest cinnamon roll ever.
“It’s so nice out here” May said after a few minutes of nothingness, smiling even bigger when Peter put his head on her shoulder, kissing it and resting her own cheek against it a product of muscle memory.
I'm nervous as hell haha, tomorrow is the first day of college. And it's not my first year, but I'm studying over seas for a few months, and I'm kind of nervous. It's normal, I guess. Anyways, I wanted to upload on time, although it's a little bit more late than I would've liked. Well, at least it's here haha.
"You guys seriously think this is a good idea?" Bruce asked, frowning. Almost all of the Avengers (minus Wanda, Clint and Vision, who were in a short mission) were there, waiting for Fury. Peter had moved in a couple of days ago, and Steve and Tony had decided to call Fury into the Penthouse to get over the custody issue as soon as posible.
“We’ll see about that” Peter murmured, and waited a moment for Harry to attack him first, which- of course, he did. Peter jumped out of the way the last second, letting Harry crash against May and Happy’s wall. The green villain was not happy with it, however, so he charged again soon after. Peter sighed, already expecting that style of fighting- the one he’d seen in countless villains who thought they were going to be the ones to defeat Spider-Man - never worked.
Now, please, leave your comments and kudos! I really want to know if you guys are liking this story so far!
btw, i'll try to answer the comments asap, i promise! just remember i love you all, and really appreciate you!
I hope you all enjoyed the chapter! I know it was sort of a filler, I promise things will move along on the next chapter, but I wanted to give you guys some Superfamily fluff. Also, a couple announcements: firstly, I'm trying to get back to the one-shots and short stories, so I'll post a new one in a few days (or weeks, depends on how fast I can write it), and secondly, I'm kinda planning on another story, but that'd be published once I finish this one or once I finish writing the new story, so I don't miss a posting day of this one. We'll see. Are you guys on board?
“It wasn’t, son” Tony assured him “, you just wanted to save Harry… it’s in your nature. But, Peter, we want to tell you two things: first of all, your father and I are incredibly proud of you, of the way you conducted yourself and did everything you did”
Tony dyed his and Steve had the serum… now that he thought about it, he was probably still virgin from any grey hairs thanks to his own enhancement. Well, he’d take what he could get. It’s all about the small victories, after all. Or so they said, Peter was tired. And a bit confused.
Peter huffed a laugh then, ignoring the excruciating pain he himself was in, and cradled Harry’s head, giving his forehead one last kiss.
A little bit of a Christmas Chapter, because we're on the season! And it goes with the timeline, so yeah: fluffy chapter with Christmas!!
I hope you all enjoyed it! PLEASE leave a comment and kudos, if you can, and I'll read you all soon! Bye, love you all!
PLEASE make sure to leave a comment and if you can/want, kudos! I always love to read what you guys thought, and it also motivates me so much!
I'm so glad you guys enjoyed the last chapter! I definitely enjoy writing some fluff, every once in a while! Now, enjoy this chapter! PS: have any of you watched the new Sabrina series? I'm obsessed omg. I'm in the middle of Episode 7 already, and it is just SOOO good!
I just published the sequel for Still Here, Still There... it's the second part of a series, so you can find it if you search for it on my profile or even in Still Here, Still There! Hope you like that one!
Someone almost got it right, but Tony didn't send Peter to Wakanda. Instead, he sent Strange. Let's see what happens next...
affected him more, should’ve felt a bit worse… maybe as a bit of a stab in the back (and wow, he did have Tony’s love for dramatics), but, to be fair, the young superhero had way more important things in his mind than an article from his ex-girlfriend, as much as it hurt.
“He’s at the Osborn’s mausoleum, isn’t he?” Tony asked, just to be sure. Peter nodded, confirming it.
with), and knowing he had no time to think about that, not really. This was his one chance to make everything worth it, and a stupid suit was not keeping him from that.
Anyway, PLEASE leave a comment so I can know what you guys think! Only a few of you comment and, as much as I appreciate those comments (love you guys so much!) I can't help but think there's something wrong with the story and that's why you guys don't comment as much. If that's the case, then please tell me! Things can always be fixed :)
And, omg, have you seen the trailer for 'Far from Home'?? It's sooooooo good! I really loved it, every piece of it... although I'm fearing for Tony. A lot of people are now saying on Twitter that he's dead... anyway, we can only hope.
PLEASE, leave a comment so I know what you guys thought! And thank you so much for reading, I really appreciate it.
“Agree with that one, my Captain” Tony murmured, seemingly (and thankfully) calmer than a few minutes before “. He’s the best thing that has happened to me, and to us… let’s just hope, now, that nothing happens to destroy that”
“We still don’t know for sure” Cho confessed “. I mean, we know Peter’s system can shut down when he’s too tired, or when he has overworked to the point of exhaustion, but that wasn’t the case here. Our main theories are two: either the healing system didn’t know where to start, or the blade had some type of poison. We took some samples of Peter’s blood, so in the next few hours we should know if the latter theory is correct - until then, it doesn’t really matter. It has started back up now and taking care of Peter”
May turned her head around, smiling sweetly at her nephew as he approached the bench she was sitting on, on the edge of the beautiful Lake the house was next of. Peter sat next to her, and she took some time to just
Also, a quick disclaimer: I have a flight on Wednesday, so if the chapter is posted later than usual, that's why! sorry if it indeed happens, I'll try to be on time!
I say all of this because I don't want to be unfair to you guys, not when you've all been so amazing to me. So, I highly doubt I'll be posting this Saturday, and next Wednesday is unlikely, too. I have two papers on Monday and Tuesday, then an essay AND a test on Wednesday, and the following week another test and another paper. And once I finish classes, I'll have two more exams. Once I finish classes, though, I'll have more time (even though I have to study, I'll be 'free' from papers), so I think I'll be able to upload then. I apologize in advance because I know it has to bother some of you, but as I always told you, my studies come first. I hope you all understand. For when I finish, though... prepare yourselves. I have cool things planned for this story as well for the one-shots, and I have a month and a half between finishing here and starting class back home.
“FRIDAY told me he woke up from a nap like ten minutes ago” Shuri informed Pepper “, I was going to visit him, I don’t exactly want him to be alone right now”
“Thank you” Peter smiled “. I think… I think this will be good. I need to find myself, and I need to do it on my own. I guess for now it’s just… Peter and Therapy”
Peter hummed softly at that, thinking his words over for a moment “. I thought I was in love with MJ and Shuri, both of them” he confessed, although his parents had known that much”. And I think I do have feelings for them. My feelings for Shuri, though, are new, and I think I have to figure them out, figure if they were born from the same place my feelings for Harry were… ultimately I don’t want to hurt her, she’s too important for me. And MJ… she’s the one person I had feelings for since before I lost my ground. I don’t want to keep holding onto her if the reason is I can’t let something go, again. She’s been one of the most important persons to me in my
To be honest, one of my favorite Marvel Movies, and my favorite Spiderman movie. If I have to be COMPLETELY honest, I even liked it more than Endgame... so yeah, watch it when you can and we can talk about it!
Just a couple of clariifcations: I made Vision appear later because if he'd been around their dissapearance a) if he was with them, he wouldn't be controlled by his invention, cause he's a robot and b) if he were to stay with Tony and not go into the mission, when they'd dissapeared he would've just scanned the world to find them. Same it goes for Loki: he obviously knows his brother is not dead, so...yeah
“We figured so,” Tony said this time. He stayed silent for a beat, and then “. Kid, we know what today is… and if you don’t want to talk about it, it’s fine, but… we just want to make sure you’re okay”
PLEASE leave a comment and kudos, if you can! You can still name the new Spidey Team, I already received some really cool names!
PLEASE leave a comment and kudos if you can/want to. And, actually, I have a question for you guys. Some of you tell me where you are from, sometimes, and I find that super interesting.
“I said shut up!” Harry yelled, closing his eyes and leaning forward until his head was between his knees, hands going up to fist some of his hair, almost painfully pulling it upwards, twisting it between fingers with enough force to turn them white “. Shut up, shut up, shut up! Get out of my head, Dad!”
So, he turned off the water and dried himself meticulously, still careful about some sore spots in his body, and changed into comfortable clothes. His Dads had insisted in a family dinner that same night, and Peter had accepted after their promise of keeping the evening as calm as possible (read: Clint was under strict orders to behave), but until then Peter could rest, and hopefully have a talk with Shuri about the press conference, if anything to have an idea of his family’s real thoughts about it. He knew the genius had stayed at the Tower both to give him some time to decompress, but also to find things she knew Peter would want to know.
Peter had hummed at that, observing Shuri’s face for a long moment. It’d been a while since he had confessed his feelings (since Shuri had done so as well), but… he knew he was always going to care about her, no matter what “. Yeah” he whispered after a few moments “. It really, really does”
Peter, for once, was happy to stay in the city. He knew his parents were thinking about spending New Year’s on their new lake house, but that one was barely finished, so maybe for the following year… not to mention, Peter still felt a bit fragile whenever he left New York, so maybe spending a more chill than usual New Year’s was bound to be a good idea. Berlin was going to be challenging enough, and Peter knew he’d need Happy to keep him on track, so… yeah, better to have a quiet Christmas break.
He made it to the bar he was meeting his friends in in under twenty minutes (although, admittedly, cutting it really close) and went in, knowing they were already in there. It wasn’t difficult to find them either, all already loud and laughing, which made Peter stop for just a second, observing them and enjoying the pleasure of doing so. A small part of him was
“Seems like he was born for this, huh?”Harry closed his eyes in annoyance, pinching the bridge of his nose and throwing his head back while doing so.
Anyway, thank you so much for reading and PLEASE leave a comment to let me know what you thought of the chapter!
. Had not quite accomplished it yet, but oh, he was so close he could practically taste it - or better yet, could imagine the afterward, every citizen in New York (hell, in the freaking world- the
The comments I've been receiving about IW theories are pretty good so far, but I really want to hear more, so don't be shy and tell me!
And now on a more serious note, just in case you haven't read the A/N at the beginning of the chapter:
-If you're wondering why Stony can't get to their kid: first, Fury has worked for them to not know anything. I know they could fight to know things about Peter, but it would mess with Peter, and they don't want that. They get their kid wanted to be away, and they respect that, even when they want to be with him again.
PS: I know I asked this on the notes above, but anyone has seen the new Netflix's sabrina? t's soooo good! I'm on episode seven already, and loving it! It has such a strong message of women empowerment, it's amazing.
As soon as the interview was done and pleasantries were exchanged Peter had left the building, only stopping briefly for some fans that had been waiting his exit for hours. Barely stopping at his place, he quickly changed into more casual clothes and grabbed his bike, aware of how late he actually was. The ride was shorter than usual, and definitely some speed laws had been probably broken, but
“Barely” she murmured “. He mentioned something about training and a Kate… but he’s being all ambiguous”
“Makes sense” Michelle nodded, neither of them breaking the hold of their hands “. And the place can serve you as a new headquarters for Spidey, right? Right in the middle of Queens”
“You’d be correct” Pepper nodded “. C’mon, come inside with me, it’s better if Peter has someone else there with him”
Next chapter is one of my favorites that I've written so far, so I really hope you guys enjoy it. Please, don't kill me or stop reading this story, there are still a few chapters left haha
Also, I've been writing the one-shot! Can't say where it will exactly be published, but hopefully, it'll be soon!
“Peter, we’re sorry” Tony whispered, surprising the hell out of his son, who could only frown at him.
“And I wasn’t pretending to hide it” MJ replied, shrugging “. But, you know, I thought it was a good idea if you went out for a bit, took your mind off Shuri going back to Wakanda”
, Thor and Loki were now younger than him in Asgardian years but… they didn’t acknowledge that, at all. No one ever did). On the other hand, however…
Also, IMPORTANT: I've published another work. I decided that from now on I'm publishing one-shots individually, and I'm going to start publishing the ones I've already written, only extending them a little. I.e, the one I published was extended maybe a thousand, two thousand words.
“Yeah, I think I’m starting to understand… thing is, forgetting about it, and getting upset by it, made me think about our whole relationship, you know? Made me reflect on it”
“Glad to be of service” Bucky smiled, winking at Peter after he’d said it. Peter smiled at his Uncle and avoided the crumpled napkin his Dad had thrown at him.
However, as tired as he could be, Peter also knew how much he couldn’t give Spider-Man up. He knew that those feelings came with the job, that they were valid and something he had to go through, but… it was worth it. Everything was worth it when the price was the safety of an entire city, and sometimes world and even Universe… it was worth it for the safety and happiness of his loved ones. So, even though Peter
hard to make what his father had envisioned possible. He’d managed to recruit villains that, sure, alone? A noticeable threat, at least for one or two Avengers but- together? Together something big enough that, if played well, could destroy even the
“Okay,” Steve nodded. He exchanged looks with his husband again and looked back at their son “. Honey, we do agree with your words, and we support you no matter what you do”
“But what are his injuries?” Shuri pressed on, letting Bucky hold her and feeling just a bit more relaxed, knowing Peter was, at least, not dead… yet, her mind told her, but she told her to shut up altogether.
After this I've been working on a one shot. I still have to finish it, but I don't have a lot left. I don't know when I'm going to upload it, because this week everyone is going to be focusing on Infinity War, myself included.
Next chapter will have the start of the Titan Battle. I'm kinda excited about it, the battle is both what you guys are expecting and not, so... can't wait for you guys to see it.
I really hope you guys liked it, and that you also like the storyline I'm introducing. I was also hoping you guys like the fact that May was a big part of this chapter. I know some of you were worried Peter was forgetting about her, but, as it is shown in this chapter: that could not be further from the truth.
, barely aware of the world that revolved around them… and, surely, the War had just ended, but… they still had some type of innocence, still were teenagers. It seemed like a whole lifetime away.
He found his genius of a husband on Peter’s old room - even when he’d moved out of it, deciding to live one level under them, the superheroes had kept it just like it was during Peter’s teenage years - as a time capsule, maybe, or maybe as a reminder of how much Peter had felt at home there, before things had started to be messy, Steve didn’t want to think about the reason behind it too much. He, however, sat next to Tony on the bed, lovingly embracing his husband to both feel calmer, and make Tony feel like so, too.
Harry only scoffed, not wanting to admit Peter was right, and kept trying to fight the superhero off of him, even more desperately now. And maybe that was the reason, maybe Harry was desperate enough it made Peter too distracted, too worried in trying to make Harry listen to him, trying to save him, even if it was just his life - whatever it was, Peter didn’t see a new threat coming… didn’t see Harry moving his arm so it was under Peter’s abdomen, didn’t see the knife that appeared out of his glove. He, however, felt it pierce through his suit and his skin and muscle, until the bottom of the knife was against his abs, deep in him. It made him stop; made Harry stop as well, maybe too surprised he’d actually done it - and sadly pulling the knife out as well. Peter felt his system almost shutting down, almost going into overdrive to try to heal itself, and he knew he had to finish the whole thing soon, or he’d be meeting his end, just like Harry had tried to say before. The superhero pushed through, gathering every little strength he had, and threw Harry away, putting a hand on his stomach to stop the blood and ignoring Karen frantically telling him to call for back up and fly immediately to the med bay. Instead, he surged at Green Goblin, surprising him by doing it, punching Harry with every little strength he had until he was back on the ground, this time panting more heavily, trying to attack Spidey once again. The knife came out of his glove again, but this time Spider-Man saw it.
I'm glad you guys are liking the last chapters! Please, leave comments once you read it! Really helps me to keep writing, because this way I know what you guys want to see and such
It's been a while, huh? God, I'm so sorry for taking this long, but I sort of needed to take a step back. Truth is, the pandemic was truly overwhelming and messed my already unstable mental health even more... I started to write for fun and to disconnect, and sadly I stopped writing as much in this fic. It didn't help, either, that I simply wasn't happy with the ending I had decided on... it felt rushed, and not genuine. It didn't felt right, you know?
Gosh, it had been a while since I had done a cliffhanger, I'd almost forgot how much I loved them hahahhaha
“I sure hope so” Cho sighed “, but right now, guys, he’s critical. His body is going into shock and his system is somehow not functioning as before, but… my team and I will work on him. We’re making sure he lives another day, alright?”
Wow, this is it. It doesn't feel like the end because there's gonna be a sequel, and the work with the one-shots, but it's a bit bittersweet. I just wanted to say thank you for letting me entertain you, in a way, and for reading me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
“Maybe you can” Peter conceded “, maybe you think that’s the easy way out, and you know what? Maybe it is. Maybe I’d live calmer, maybe I’d have fewer headaches. But this is what’s right, this is what the world needs. And as long as I have the opportunity to fight for the world, as long as I’m powerful enough to do it, then I will”
The chapter is done. As I already said to some of you, Bucky is still an important part of the story, so the fact that Peter and he are not talking yet, and the fact that Peter knows Bucky kept that huge secret from him, is something that will be coming up in the next chapters. So look forward to that, if you want!
“Okay, stop laughing, time to make a toast before we can start eating” the blond said, and all obliged remarkably fast eager to eat the food already. Peter looked at his Papa, watching him snicker for a moment before he turned his righteous self again “. I just wanted to say that I am extremely happy we are all here together. You all are the best part of me, and despite every turn in our way, we’ve learned to make our way back to each other, time and time again. So, a toast for this family, who’ll
Hope you guys liked it, next one is one I really like! By the way, I saw Endgame again on Thursday and omg it's more amazing every time you watch it!
“Which is still a feat” Peter pointed out “. Besides, they were great leaders when the situation required of so”
“Oh, no,” both women said at the same time. Then, Pepper continued “. You were critically injured, Peter, we’re not putting you in that position, not yet. I’ll go talk to Doctor Cho, she can surely tell me when it’s the wisest time to do the conference, alright?”
Well, tell me what you thought of this chapter, with a comment (PLEASE) and even with a kudo, if you can! And I'll see you on Wednesday! Bye!
“Again, I am aware my actions raised confusion, but my first priority has always been to protect this city, and its citizens, ever since I was fourteen, and it will continue to be so until I take my last breath, I can promise you all that. In order to do so, however, sometimes I will have to pull stunts like this, and for that I am sorry, but I do hope the people of New York, and even the people of the world, are able to forgive me. Thank you all so much”
“Have you heard from Clint?” He asked a few minutes into their lazy walk, observing some SHIELD agents training in the field. Natasha hummed, stopping to do the same as her nephew.
“So you called for the big help, huh?” The taller man grumbled, standing up and still trying to get his breathing under control “. Realized how much of a joke you are that you have to call for help?”
“Exactly” Steve nodded “. This is not like a couple of years ago, Honey. We’ll always be sorry for what happened then, but now it’s different, now there are no more secrets between us all… now we’ve finally learned to stop hiding things, to stop being so stubborn, and to start being completely honest. So from now on, boys, in this family we
I hope you guys liked it! The story is going to change (like, it'll be different from the movie) pretty soon for Team Titan! I'm excited about the changes! Anyway, tomorrow I'll publish the work with the short stories and one-shots! So be sure to check that out!
“This family” May replied “. This life. You groaned and… I just, to my mind came all the times you did that when you were younger. Back in the apartment, back with Ben, even back when you were barely two and Ben and your Dad pulled something on you”
“I think it’s wrong to think that way, MJ” Peter said, interrupting her thoughts “. I do think we worked together… until we didn’t. And when that happened it was heartbreaking, as much as I knew breaking up was the only thing we could do to salvage this friendship. And right now… right now I think we have to give ourselves closure, M. I have to work on myself, I have to be okay with it before anything else can happen with
“I managed to convince your Dad to spend some time with me” Steve joked “, although it was pretty hard, almost had to lock the workshop down for him to pay attention to me”
PLEASE leave a comment, so I know what you thought of the chapter. Someone told me they wanted Wanda and Peter interacting, so here it was... so, if you have any idea, feel free to tell me! Maybe they'll end up in the story!
Oh my God, I'm so happy to be posting again! I still have to write a lot to catch up, but I could prepare this chapter for you all!
“Lazy day?” He asked, startling them. Both superheroes smiled at the sight of their son and stood up to greet him with warm hugs, going to sit around the living room once they made sure of that.
“Maybe later” Peter murmured. Tony nodded, and then squeezed the shoulder he was still resting his hand on, gaining his son’s attention.
Anyways, I know you want to know what happens next, after the cliffhanger, so... I'll let you read. Of course, as always, don't forget to leave kudos and Comments! Always greatly appreciated.
“Fine! I may have something to do with it… but! Before you get mad, I made sure FRIDAY saved your work, so it’s not lost”
As for Peter’s mental health, it was getting there. After cleaning things up and knowing Harry was not going to be hated on eternally, Peter had felt a lot more at peace. Therapy had of course helped; it’d been slow at first, frustrating on both sides, but slowly Peter had learned to open up, had learned to speak up his mind in ways he had never done. His parents had gone with him to a few sessions, if anything to help him and talk things through and, even when things were still not totally okay, they were a whole lot better - especially between Peter and his Dads.
Peter laughed at his Dads, fully knowing both were trying to make it better for him, wanting to give him a good birthday Eve, and for that… he was thankful.
“Hi, Shuri. Is Peter awake?” The redhead asked, shaking her head towards her nephew’s room. Shuri nodded, eyeing the tablet Pepper carried with mixed emotions - she seriously hoped the businesswoman wasn’t there to make Peter work, but she also knew the world wasn’t perfect. She had to remember, too, that Pepper had been one of the few people to know about Peter’s crazy plan, so maybe it had something to do with it.
Harry was clearly taken back by his presence - no, not Harry, Peter decided, but the Green Goblin… junior? It was clear he wasn’t his father, and it was also clear he had done some changes and improvements to the suit he was currently wearing (probably fixed the weaker points), which was bad news for Peter, because now he didn’t know the spots he could go for, or the way Harry fought. But that was fine - Peter had been trained to not find an obstacle in that, to just fight with everything he had and find information about his opponent on the way.
Admittedly, the plan had been risky. The first time he’d seen Parker after green-lighting the whole thing, and after contacting the villains, the young genius had been walking through New York with Shuri of Wakanda (which did something to Harry’s jealous self, but he was ignoring that all together), careless expression and smile so genuine it tore the taller man’s heart once again. His father was
I'm not an overly emotional person, but, from the bottom of my heart: Thank. You. And I hope I see you all soon. Love you all 3000!
just how hard you had to train to get to a decent level - he was the walking and breathing proof of that.
“I just… I wanted to protect you” Peter murmured, not denying the warmness that spread through his body. Tony and Steve looked at him with fond looks on their faces, both thinking of how much they loved that kid, and how much he was still like them, unbelievingly so “. You-I- I just… I didn’t tell you something important, and I didn’t want to-“
“And you’re full of crap” Peter replied - admittedly, not one of his best comebacks, but it’d do “. I should’ve known from the beginning you were nothing but full of it”
Next chapter is here! Gosh, I'm in a bit of a hurry because tomorrow I have my first final! I think I know it well, but it was a lot of info... so we'll see. Anyway, I had this week's chapters already written, so there you go!
you need to voice whatever is going on in that little genius head of yours, or it will eventually implode”
PLEASE leave a comment and or kudos if can or want to! In the last chapter barely any of you commented, so let me know what you think about the story so far!
Well, we're here, on the last chapter of this sequel. I'm happy to announce there's gonna be a third installment to this work-series (other than the one-shots, of course... I promise I'll upload a new one soon).
“That bad?” Pepper asked, biting her lower lip elegantly. Shuri shrugged, bringing her arms up to hug herself.
Not wasting a second, Peter started to read the piece while almost cringing at the title, for it questioned his decision to step down in rather harsh words. He guessed Michelle was hurt by what he’d done - probably, also, because he hadn’t told her about it beforehand, but still, she had to know he didn’t do it in order to hurt her, right? Peter was doing what he thought was right… for everybody. Or well, almost everybody, but- besides the point.
“I’m not that late, shut it” Peter complained, sitting between Ned and Harley, who was starting to go to their outings a whole lot more - not like Peter would complain. He knew his surrogate brother had bonded with his friends after the Harry fiasco, and he’d never complain about spending more time with the younger man.
Sorry for taking a bit, but I was watching La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) and that took some time from my day lol. I'm still on Chapter 4 of Season 4, so PLEASE, no Spoilers. Thanks.
“That’s bad” Bucky murmured, trying his nephew to stop bleeding and choosing not to rip Peter’s mask off, knowing just how pale and bloody Peter would be underneath it.
She had left Peter’s room after spending some time with him, knowing the guy was tired, and also kind of dying to see his Aunt, and had gone to the guest room she usually occupied to rest for a bit. Shuri also called her brother, to assure him Peter was okay (and that so was she), and that she would try to convince the superhero to go to visit Wakanda soon.
“Not to mention all the crazy shit that happened once you entered our lives again” Tony pointed out “. Our lives are a bit eventful, you could say”
So things were not great. His body hurt like crazy, having been hit more times than Peter could count, burned from a few spots in particular (which he tried to not think about) and was starting to have a little trouble breathing - and it wasn’t even half-done, not even one of the villains having been defeated. For the first time, the genius really thought he could actually be defeated. So, once Doctor Octopus used one of his arms to throw him against a near building, Peter couldn’t help but stay down for a second too long, ribs burning with pain.
Now, I am aware most people would have abandoned this story, and I am in no way blaming them, because it has been a long while. But, if you are reading it (and if you've read this too, in which case: thanks, and congrats), then I really hope you enjoy the chapter.
Of course, don't forget to comment and leave kudos in this one as well. That being said, enjoy the chapter!!
“Hey, it’s okay, it’s fine” the superhero whispered, rocking them both back and forth and trying not to sob while doing it “. I forgive you, okay? I only remember the good stuff, Har”
“Sure” Shuri nodded, going back to her tea and letting Peter do the talking if he felt like so, which again Peter appreciated. The silence, however, was broken after a few minutes of them comfortably sipping they tea, when their doorbell rang, softly at first and constantly after just a few seconds “. Wait a sec, I’ll go get it, I’m sure it’ll be Bucky”
“I didn’t want you to” Peter immediately said “, nor I wanted you to do that. I understand it was a good opportunity, and you know I believe you could be one of the best journalists this city has, if not the best”
Omg, hi you all! I've missed you! I'm finally able to write again, and I'm really excited about it! I leave Toronto in, like, three days, and it makes me super sad. So, I'm visiting places I hadn't had the opportunity to see with my friends - that is why the chapter is really late- sorry. Anyway, it's not like I'm writing a lot this week, and I'm definitely not writing tomorrow at all, but I have like nine hours on the plane, and I plan to at least write a chapter then. Also, I'm planning a new one-shot! Ik, shocking, lmao.
“Yeah, you’re right” Steve agreed “. Ever since we met it’s been like that… it’s crazy to think everything that’s happened since, from marrying one another to having
“It’s okay, Dad. Again, nothing we can change. But still… it shook me. And… I think the War, and being far from you for the first time since it’d finished made me desperate to find some ground to stand on. And Harry, he…”
“That he was Green Goblin” Peter explained, looking back at his Dads. Tony and Steve shrugged at that, not really having an answer for the young genius.
“Well, they’ll always be Avengers. Right now, though, it’s good they decided to stay on the ground. They’ve done their part”
So, hope you liked it. There'll be one more part to this story, idk when I'll upload it, yet. I still have to finish it.
Not too much to know, just the usual: Peter is their biological son, Stony doesn't know about their son being a superhero and overprotective Bucky. Hurt!Peter because you guys asked.
So I finally decided to divide this arc in three chapters; next one will be the last one with Bucky as the 'main problem', per se. It's dramatic, so, don't say I didn't warn you guys
is what was killing me inside. I just-I don’t get it” the Princess whispered, trusting Peter’s super-hearing would catch her words “… you know I’m one of the smartest people on Earth, if not the smartest, you
Tony let out a laugh at that, which grew more hysterical when he saw his husband’s scoff. The fact that Bucky had been right didn’t exactly make things easier “. Your Uncle is incredibly funny, yeah” Steve said in a deadpan tone “. And just so you know, spending this much time with him has definitely affected your own humour”
I told you guys things were going to change... and they'll keep changing... muahahhahaha I can't say more, I don't want to spoil.
“I forgot for a while” MJ admitted “, but… I think I know that now. And you know it’s the same for me, right? You’ve been the most important man in my life, Peter, and still, after everything that happened… the person I still trust the most”
So, now you guys have read the 'break-up' scene. For a while, it was going to be the end of the chapter, but then I preferred to have it as it is now- it's not something that can change what's happening now, so it made sense to be at that point of the chapter.
I really hope you guys enjoyed it! The new work with the one-shots and short stories (in this AU) will be out soon - probably, this week!
“They loved to do that” Peter nodded, a soft smile perched in his face. Those moments were some of the only ones he remembered of his father, so he treasured them “. Mom and you usually took me away from them”
“We’ll have a debrief soon” Sam finally said “, let us rest first, you little asshole. Now, tell us, how have been things around here? It’s good to see you haven’t destroyed this place just yet”
PLEASE comment what you thought about the chapter and the things you want to see in a potential sequel! (a.k.a, an au of ininity war)!
to be by his side and make sure he remembers he has us there for him, no matter what. And it’s time we’re honest - all of us”
“This is for Peter’s good, Steve” she reassured him “. He will feel better if we tell him the whole truth”
I've been busy lately, so sorry about that! But this chapter is a bit longer than the last ones, and I really liked this one. It sets the tone for a storyline I'd been thinking to have for a while.
“The news looked horrible,” Flash said, breaking the ice “. It was sort of terrifying, Peter… we just saw you bleed out, we thought you were going to die. What happened?”
“Will do” Peter nodded, smiling at his Aunt and walking to the exit side by side. He said goodbye with a hug and grabbed a taxi arguably fast, aware pretty much all of the taxis in New York wanted to give a ride to Spider-Man… and hey, sometimes that was really convenient, so why complain?
I hope you guys enjoyed! I know it was shorter than usually, but I've been busy this week. Next week the chapters will be longer, and angst will return, don't you worry!!
“Which is why you tried to keep your family away, too” Shuri sighed, not liking Peter’s explanation (and still a bit mad), but understanding his point. She knew she hadn’t been the only one to be kept in the dark; hell, almost everyone had been, all confused by the young genius’ actions and by how sudden it’d all been, but it still stung “. Peter, I need you to be honest right now, okay? I need you to tell me everything that you can or are willing to tell me,
Next chapter is up! I hope you all like it! I'm finally done with finals (if I don't have to re-do any, which I think I won't, but you know, fingers crossed), so I'm gonna be able to write more now. There's a one-shot coming soon!
Shuri looked at it with her heart caught in her throat. She knew how difficult it had to be for Peter - she guessed everyone actually knew that-, how much it’d be killing him to fight Harry, to know everything he knew now. She watched, feeling her legs shake, how they rolled onto the ground, fighting and clearly yelling some things to one another. And then, for a moment, they paused, shocked by something that had happened -what, they didn’t know, the footage wasn’t that weird. The two rivals broke off then, Peter throwing Harry away a few feet from him, and putting a hand on his stomach, which no one at the apartment liked one bit. They all tried to ignore the reporter’s voice pointing out the obvious: Spidey had been hurt, and badly, apparently. Instead, they chose to keep watching the footage, seeing how the Avenger threw himself at Harry, once again, both rolling on the ground. And, like before, after a while, they just stopped, both clearly shocked about something else. When Spider-Man broke away they all saw what had happened, and gasped:
Hope you like the second part of this short story! The next one-shot is one I really like, but I'm not sure when I'll publish it... soon, I promise! Now that I'm done with the school year I'll have much more time! Anyway, enjoy the chapter!
Oh God, I have an awful cold. Weather in Poland (where I'm living rn, only for a few months tho) is crazyyy. Anyway, an important question: who do you want to be in the 'New' Avengers Team? It's not like it'll happen now, but I'd like to know
“That sucks, man,” Peter told his oldest friend, putting a fake sympathetic smile on his face. MJ nodded while trying to hide her amusement at the situation. Flash simply looked at Peter, silently pleading for the slightly taller man to drop it, and then, when he saw Peter was not going to do it, rolled his eyes and nudged Ned.
“I’ll debrief it soon” Peter replied, cheekily. Sam groaned at that, knowing he should’ve expected the young genius to throw him back his own answer, and Bucky laughed at the two of them “. Although… I can tell you that he’s part of an idea I’ve been tossing with”
“Shut it, I didn’t get the chance to have breakfast yet” The journalist laughed, sticking her tongue out at Peter. Said man just snickered and let her do, playing with the lid of his coffee “. Now seriously, Pete, how are you doing?”
“Good evening, gentlemen,” he said, smiling coldly at them “. I am pleased to say our plan is seemingly working successfully… Peter has stepped down as the heir of the biggest empires in this country and for what I’ve gathered from today, it’s going to stay like that. He doesn’t believe in Stark Industries, or the stupid Avengers anymore. Now is our time- our time to show the world what a fraud Peter is”
“Peter, you know we’re sorry we didn’t support you, right?” Tony interrupted him, not ungently “. We are sorry, me especially, for the way we acted”
If any of you want to see a scene/one shot/short story in particular you just have to tell me! I'm open to requests.
Enjoy this chapter, I really enjoyed writing it! Also, there's a new one-shot in the other work in this AU! A little Spideychelle for you all!
“Of course you would miss me,” Peter said almost in a deadpan tone. MJ laughed at him in shock and threw her rumpled napkin at him, which he as always avoided, laughing back at MJ. It was nice to be like that, he thought, open and honest even when they were in a public space… something that couldn’t have happened a few years ago, the superhero knew. But with her job as a journalist, MJ had learned to put herself in the spotlight and own it, especially after getting her dream job at the New York Times, for which Peter was endlessly proud. Furthermore, after everything that had happened with Harry, MJ had realized she needed to be there for Peter, owed him so, and, after being so close to actually lose him - well, showing her public affection became less of a problem. Not immediately, more gradually, but Peter was happy about it nonetheless. Not for what that implied for their relationship, but simply because no matter what, he
Feel free to tell me any ideas you have! The ones I already received were super cute and I'm doing them all!
“Sure” Peter nodded, knowing he owed a lot of explanations to his loved ones. Bucky nodded and left the room, calling Shuri in. The Princess went in after only a few moments, going straight to hug Peter while softly calling her ‘idiot’ over and over. Peter laughed and hugged her back, although much weaker “. Hey, Shur? I kinda want to breathe”
“Honey, maybe it’s better if you rest first” Steve suggested, only wanting his son to feel better “, you can tell us later, okay?”
So, I really hope you guys loved the one-shot! I had a really fun time writing it, and I'm already thinking of a new one, so it won't be that long until I post again!
“A pretty good combo if you ask me,” Tony said, getting nervous laughs from his loves. Yeah, a pretty good combo. And, Peter knew: the right one for him. At least, for the moment.
So, quick heads up: the next chapters will probably be longer than usual, but oh well: they're the last ones and I want to have everything solved... kind of. Don't worry, there's still a sequel! And I'm already planning it - I'll start to write it soon. Just a quick question: will you guys still read it even after Endgame comes out?
going to wonder what would’ve happened if things had been different, if Harry hadn’t been so tormented, if Norman had never decided to hunt Peter down… he wondered, although only sometimes, if Harry and his friends would’ve been able to put aside their differences, if they could all be friends now. Fruitless thoughts and imaginations, but Peter’s mind was never completely free from those.
“Shut it” Peter huffed, nudging Shuri’s shoulder teasingly. The princess smiled in return and both stayed in comfortable silence for a few minutes, until Peter had to know “. So… how are things over at the Tower? Do I have to expect any family freakouts?”
No one knew what was happening exactly, but everyone was aware something was happening, at last, which was then confirmed when Shuri received a text message from Bucky to be careful, and to hope everything was going to be okay. It hadn’t been exactly a surprise when someone had knocked at her door, and MJ, Ned, Harley, Flash, and a couple of people she didn’t really know were at the other side of her threshold.
Some of you thought this was going to be how Peter comes out as Stony's son. Gotcha! I have something planned for that, just not yet. Also, something I wanted to put in there was the friendship between MJ and Peter. First, of, I admit Spideychelle has the potential of happening in the future (not yet tho), but I wanted to show something with their scenes in this chapter, and that was show a 'healthy' relationship between a girl and a boy without having it to be sexualized. Hope you all can see that. Again, I'll love to put Spideychelle at some point, but: if it happens, I want it to be in a way that feels natural, not something that explodes after Peter has to spend a night at MJ's because he's injured. Anyway, sorry for my rant lol,  I really hope you enjoyed the chapter!
“Aw, is there trouble in Wonder Twins paradise?” Bucky had asked, smiling teasingly at Natasha, whom just proceded to glare at him. Peter, on the other hand, snickered at his Uncle’s comment, noticing that even when Bucky looked worn down and had a few scratches, he looked mostly okay.
That's it! I hope you guys liked the chapter! Slowly you're going to get more Flashbacks of what happened during the period of time between the second book, and this one. Also, I know it was a bit of a cliffhanger, sorry haha
PLEASE tell me what you thought about the chapter in the comments, and I'll see you in the next chapter!
“Kind of” Peter nodded “. I had to talk to you about something that bothered me a bit, just because I want to go into this next phase of my life with everything on the table, I guess. I kept something big for years, and I don’t want to do that ever again, not to that, not to anything”
Sorry for missing a couple of updates, but my parents made a surprise visit for my birthday, so I was pretty distracted haha. Tomorrow actually I am gonna surprise them, 'cause they don't know I'm coming home haha. Anyway, enjoy it!
“That is so, you little genius of mine” May said, smiling big and sweetly. They stayed in a comfortable silent for a few more minutes, until the smell of the grill was too good to ignore, and only then they went back to their family, whom were already gathering around the (admittedly huge) table that had been set for all of them to eat.
Ned nodded and then stopped for a minute, staring at Peter’s face for a long second before a look of realization crossed his face. And then he was gasping, pointing an accusing finger towards the genius of the group “. Oh my Norwegian Gods you did it!”
since Ned had started working for another company, and since he’d told Peter he wanted to feel like he deserved to work at S.I for something other than being the heir’s best friend. Now that Shuri had told Peter about her impending moving back to Wakanda, and now that Peter was pretty much taking over S.I, enough was enough - he was going to convince Ned to join him in S.I, even if he had to kidnap him.
Here's a list of links in which you can donate/sign (and I'm sorry for not getting every link, I always feel like I miss a lot. Feel free to write a link, if you have one, in the comments:
Peter laughed softly at Abeer’s question, tempted to confess how much his Dads got into his last nerve with how little they could stop themselves from still inserting their opinions whenever an Avengers mission or issue came up. But retirement, albeit still strange for them sometimes, had done well to them… after fighting for the greater good for decades, Peter knew they deserved to have some peace and rest.
“Hey!” The kid protested “, I’ve been kinda busy, Dads, it… slipped. Holy hell, my birthday is tomorrow”
PLEASE leave a comment, and kudos, if you can, and I'll see you next Saturday! Not sure about the hour, I'll be out the whole day, so... there's that. Bye!
“So, how was the mission?” Peter asked, more curious than anything else. His Uncles snickered and exchanged looks for a moment, silently deciding on what to tell the genius.
Steve was doing the right thing, helping Bucky, but he had to trust his husband, tell him what was going on. Steve was on the edge, constantly, and maybe having Tony with him would help him. Tony always seemed to have a relaxing effect on the soldier, specially since they had gotten together. Still, she shut up, and tried to sleep for a while. Russia was going to be hard.
“I don’t like this, Steve” Tony murmured after a few minutes “. I feel like we’re waiting for the worst”
“Look at you” Green Goblin Jr. laughed, getting closer to Peter and putting a foot on his chest “, where is the all mighty superhero you were saying you were before, huh?”
“Yeah, Norman built it after Harry’s Mom passed, but… I know Harry didn’t totally like it. The only good thing is that he’s close to his Mom, I guess” his parents stayed silent after that, letting him take the next step, which he appreciated. Sighing, the youngest superhero of the three moved to the couch, letting his parents sit at either side of him, a fake cocoon of protection Peter had subconsciously (and desperately) needed “. I think I realized something today. But I don’t know if it’s okay”
So, um... hey *hides behind the computer* please don't kill me! I already said it was going to be sad AND dramatic!
“Peter?” Harry asked, seemingly just realizing Peter was there “. What happened, I…? Peter, I don’t know what’s happening-“
Peter was pretty sure he was super responsible. He had been acing his tests at school AND he was keeping his secret identity from his Dad and Pops just fine.
Harry huffed, containing the urge to throw something at his TV (although, barely) when he saw Peter giving the last words of the conference. And okay, if he had to be
“Man, I was so worried” he whispered, in a voice so low Peter knew his words were meant to be heard by just him “. The news looked terrible and your family wasn’t saying a thing and-“
“I agree” Vulture nodded “. they’ve always done this, always believe they are morally superior, and they managed to convince everyone in this city of the same thing. It’s time for us to show them otherwise”
“Peter’s in surgery” the older genius explained “, he has just gone into it, not even ten minutes ago… Cho is doing it, so you know he’s in good hands”
I hope you enjoyed the chapter! If you have suggestions for any future chapters, feel free to tell me!
“A bit” Peter agreed, silently laughing at his Auntie’s struggle to stay out of the Avengers business. She hadn’t
“The spider that bit Peter was from Oscorp” Tony reminded them “, so technically, just as my father was the one who had the formula to create super soldiers, Oscorp had the formula to create radioactive spiders…”
“Oh,” Michelle blinked. To be fair, she had forgotten about the article the second she’d realized Peter was bleeding out in the roof of a building. Now, the two of them alone in the superhero’s apartment, the journalist felt caught for a moment. But just for a brief moment, because, after all… “. Peter, I was doing my job. They asked me to write an article about it and I couldn’t say no, nor was I going to, not when it was an
“You’re exaggerating” Tony complained, although clearly in a playful tone “, although I was having something close to a genius strike… you’re lucky you’re pretty, Rogers. And that I have a lot of those”
be able to change. Death is irreversible, and we can’t play with that. No one can, not even the Gods you have for Uncles,
Sorry for the little delay; it was my birthday and I was out celebrating. Enjoy the chapter and leave a comment as a present (lol)!
Shuri stayed silent for an almost uncomfortably long time then, looking deep into Peter’s eyes and seemingly finding whatever she’d been looking for after that time, when she smiled softly in his direction “. You’ll always be my most precious
You guys didn't comment that much of my latest chapter, so I'd really like to know if you guys liked it.
Please leave a comment to let me know what to think.... and thank you so, so much, for being the loveliest readers and for always making me feel better and for keeping this story going. It was a pleasure, can't wait to see you on the new story!
“And you know the meaning behind Peter’s happiness, right? You know what he had to do to get where he is, doing that stupid press conference with that smile on his face, don’t you?”
“You know what day it is today” he said, taking off the protection gear and going to sit on the nearest bench. Bucky sighed and nodded, following his nephew’s actions and sitting next to him, waiting in silence for him to continue “. I just… I’d forgotten, Uncle B. I remembered last night, and just because some stupid app reminded me of a picture I took that day, so… what does it say about me?”
There's still so much more to this story... like, I barely am getting started, and the hardest thing so far has been figuring out how to write everything I want to write without making it too much. So, I really hope you guys have been liking the story so far!
And, actually, every single one of the villains had done a really good job, appearing out of nowhere and disappearing just as quickly. It made the citizens of New York nervous, giddy, always expecting something else to come and attack. It made them feel uneasy and unsafe, which was just perfect for Harry because it all went to Peter’s head- clearly. God, his plan had really worked, he- he was
“Precisely!” He exclaimed “. A group for young and gifted individuals that wouldn’t do the same missions as us, per se,
we worked amazing together, and you know I’m capable enough. You’ve seen me fight, I’ve helped you before - hell, Peter, we were fighting in the same war. Granted, it was in completely different environments, and I spent the major part of the battle trying to help Vision, but still, it is very offensive for you to think I’m not capable-“
Third and last part of this short story! Just because Peter has come home things are going to be pretty, or easy. So this is them adjusting. And some fluff.
Hi guys! Sorry this is later than usual, I was with a few friends and I got home pretty late... we went to a haunted house and I don't think I'm going to be able to sleep with the lights off tonight lmao.
By the end of Harley’s side of the story, Ned had left his search of news in one random channel, too shocked to really be checking anything else. And
“Are you sure, P?” She asked, just to be sure. Peter sighed, nodding despite every fiber of his being telling him he wasn’t ready for anything like that.
Peter sighed, not really wanting to debate any further. The idea of fighting Harry was killing him inside, so the last thing he wanted was to get to know just how much the young Osborn hated him (even though Peter could get a faint idea of it). And, if he was being honest, he knew he had to be quick - the plan was to knock Harry unconscious and put him in prison, but to keep him alive.
, to information about the battle, to maybe the Osborn’s representative wanting to sue… way too many things could still go wrong, and Peter was in no headspace to face a lot of them.
PLEASE leave kudos AND comments! they really make my day and they motivate me to go on with this story!
I hope you all liked it! Just to be clear: the flashback is AFTER MJ and Peter break up- like, a while later. That doesn't mean you guys won't see their break up, I just wanted to put this flashback in here.
I know it can seem like Tony "forgives" Steve way too easily, maybe. The way I see it, Tony can be stubborn, but he (kind of) has this dependency with people. He has had two years to think about everything, to think about Steve's actions. He understands why he did what he did. He loves Steve, and he knows Steve loves him back. Tony is a genius, and as emotional constipated he can get, he's not an idiot. So he knows he loves and needs Steve, and he also misses him. That's why he decides to open a door for him.
“And I’m Abe, it’s… surreal, your Majesty” the boy murmured, clearly taken back because of her presence. Shuri just gestured for them to stand up, not feeling like keeping any protocol up - not then, not when they were that worried about Peter.
Omg, it has been a while since the last time I did a cliffhanger that evil (and good lol). I really hope you guys liked the chapter! Also, please don't kill me!
Figuring he was done with the serious talk for that evening, he snuggled further into his fathers’ arms and asked FRIDAY to put on another re-run of Modern Family (never tired of it). All in all… Peter was pretty sure he couldn’t have spent his anniversary in a better way.
And maybe, this time, Peter had been too fed-up, too tired, too mad and sad about the fact that Harry didn’t care if he lived or not, that he hated him with everything he had. So without thinking, and rather acting on instinct, Spidey broke the knife off of the glove, and tried to throw it away. But things didn’t go as planned, just as they rarely did, and Harry tried to stab him again, fighting for the control of the knife - he, however, forgot once again Peter was much, much stronger than him, even when he was as hurt as he was and, after rolling on the ground for a minute, the fight stilled once again… and this time, it was Harry the one who went limp. When Peter looked down, the knife was poking out of his chest.
So, we got the Winter Soldier! It'll take over the next couple of chapters, maybe. One or two, max. I know you want to see Peter, but believe me: this part of the story is just as important. I tried to keep some original dialog, but, obviously, I changed it a bit, too.
First, I didn't exactly know when Peter's birthday was in the MCU. Because of it, I put in the same day Tom Holland was born (June 1st). HOWEVER, the other day I found out Peter's birthday is August 10th. It's definitely something that will be corrected in future stories, but: do you guys want me to change it in this story as well? It won't change anything but a few details, and it won't interfere with the story. So, do I change it?
It was a bit short and I know it's really similar to the movie, but I wanted to keep it somehow similar- adapted to the AU, of course. Things will start to change next chapter though... and you guys will be getting Steve's pov in all of this, in a different way than the movie.
SO, I think I'm going to try to upload Wednesdays from now on, only because it makes more sense. When I upload on Tuesdays and Saturdays, you have to wait a little bit from Tuesday to Saturday, and barely nothing from Saturday to Tuesday. So, maybe this is better, idk. I don't know if I explained myself either, lmao.
Peter wanted to do something - get up and keep fighting, even if he could barely do it for too much longer. And then… then everything changed when someone tackled Green Goblin to the ground and-
“Of course we will” Ned nodded, echoing the sentiment of the other two boys “. You’re not alone in this, Pete”
So, I know... a little bit of a cliffhanger. Oops haha. Just a quick note: Peter finding the folder does not mean he finds his parents. Just for you guys to know...
So, I want to be fair: There'll always be a chapter on Wednesday, but I can't promise you guys there'll be one every Saturday, because sometimes I don' have enough time. I apologize in advance
“You’re too good” Harry murmured with his last strength “. Always have been, and I… I think I’m glad you’ll always be that way”
“And we’re live with CNN, bringing you footage a battle that seems to be happening between Spider-Man and what has been named as the Sinister Six”
Tell me your favorite thing about the chapter, and please leave a comment to tell me what you think!
“It’s a pleasure to finally meet you, your Majesty,” a pretty blond girl told her then, bowing to her presence. A boy, looking incredibly flustered next to her, copied her actions “. I’m Betty Brant, it’s an honor”
“This is borderline psychotic, dude,” Harley told him, letting himself fall onto the couch. Peter rolled his eyes at him, but didn’t deny it. He’d moved back into the Tower, now sharing his apartment with his surrogate younger brother; he’d enjoyed his time in Queens with Shuri, but with the Princess moving back to Wakanda, Peter had decided to make the apartment in Queens into a space he could escape to when he felt overwhelmed, and move back into the Tower. Besides, now that Harley was working in S.I with him, it made things easier.
“You didn’t” Peter argued, frantically shaking his head “, you’re seeing much clearer now, aren’t you?”
The other two villains smiled to his words and nodded, so soon they were on their way, with Scorpio being carried by the Vulture and Harry flying on the hoverboard his Dad had made, all those years back. When they finally arrived at their destination, Vulture got one of his alien weapons and… boom. Shot right into May Parker’s apartment, creating an explosion that quickly put the place on fire. Harry smiled, pleased, and flew until he could get inside, mask protecting him from inhaling anything too toxic. And then… he froze.
Plus, the way I see it, Tony would've reacted a lot better if someone was right there, by his side. He finds about it in a peaceful environment, Steve is right there with him to help him understand everything, and Tony has time to think about it. He says he still is not okay with it, when he finds out, but he knows he has to separate Bucky from HYDRA.
knowing rest would be needed for everything he was going to face in the few next days, or even hours (okay, so Bucky had told him that, almost tying him to the bed in order to force him to sleep- that didn’t
Steve leaves his home to protect his best friend, who is just a victim of HYDRA and brainwashing. He's desperate to not lose him again, but doesn't really think about what it's going to mean. After all, he's leaving his husband and their son behind...
Okay, so me being me, a.k.a a mess, I totally forgot yesterday was Saturday. So sorry! It's morning now, but I didn't want to make you guys wait until this evening, so... I'm uploading now
“And to be honest, these last couple of years… they’ve been great, but we both knew it was not going to last forever. I’m still Wakanda’s Princess, I can’t just permanently move out to another country”
So it hadn’t been too hard to put some of fake care at the end of the short interaction, for sure messing with Peter’s head even if it was just a bit. Things had been a bit slow after it (lots of training on Harry’s side, lots of meetings to get the team together), but he’d been able to put Electro into action and then- he’d been able to discover Peter was returning to MIT for a few weeks to finish his Ph.D.. The instant he’d found out he’d called his assistant to arrange some lectures, and so- he’d been at MIT at the right time, right place.
to make this world a better place - for Oscorp, for the world… for you, son. And in order to do that, I had to end Tony Stark… and when he had a kid, I had to end him, too”
Steve laughed and went to side-hug his son, ruffling his hair and exchanging looks of fondness with his husband from above the (still in their minds) kid’s head “. Petey, you sound more like Dad as time goes on. How about you start talking a bit more like me?”
“Fine” Peter groaned, sipping some of his delicious coffee. Michelle laughed softly at him and stole one of his cookies “. Hey!”
away. However, she didn’t know if Peter was going to be specially proud of him, with Steve lying to Tony constantly. She
Well well well well... Peter is going to train his training with his Uncle Bucky, and Tony has decided to protect him and make him a new suit... what will happen next? Next chapter will be up in a few days!
“I don’t care if you deserve it” Peter shrugged, ignoring the pain that caused him. It was becoming increasingly difficult for him to speak, and every bit of his mind was telling him to go to a medic, but he just couldn’t leave, not yet “… I think you should have it. I don’t want you to go with hate in your heart”
And that's all for today! This chapter was long, so I hope it compensates not having one on Wednesday!
Six days. That was the time Cho had told Pepper - Peter had to rest for six days to be completely healed (the superhero’s inability to stay still included in that calculation), so Pepper had scheduled a press conference a week from the day she had visited Peter, quickly sending the message to her nephew and deciding which media she would allow into the room, even adding which journalist she preferred to be there. Peter decided to let his Aunt do - he’d learned to trust Pepper blindly, after all.
“Tony, you have to take him to Cho” Steve pleaded his husband “, it’s his only chance, he’s losing too much blood in here”
After this I've been working on a one shot. I still have to finish it, but I don't have a lot left. I don't know when I'm going to upload it, because this week everyone is going to be focusing on Infinity War, myself included.
God, I left you all with a pretty big cliffhanger, didn't I? Sorry about that! I know you guys want to read what happens next already, so, go on! Enjoy the chapter!
hope you enjoy it! and please read the note at the end of the chapter, I have a really important question regarding this story
“No shit” Shuri laughed, rolling her eyes fondly at him “, Pepper almost had to force you to go to this one… I lost count of the times she compared you to Tony”
“Sure” Peter shrugged. Pepper nodded approvingly and then launched into a more detailed conversation, explaining exactly what Germany wanted and what she had thought Stark Industries would answer that with. She then went to explain what she wanted Flash and he to do, telling the genius only Happy was going with them to Berlin and that they’d stay there for a couple of weeks. For when she was done Peter was close to just exit through the window, even if that was to feel some fresh air in his face (free-falling fresh air was
“Many things in life don’t” Bucky agreed “. But our perception can be wrong from time to time. Especially if we’re too close to the damage, kid”
And Michelle had learned to read him better, which was nice, too. She’d done that before, but after the War Peter had learned to hide more things
“Not good” he confessed “, but good enough, I guess. I’ll get through the press conference, I promise”
“I know, Dad, but what do you want me to do? I have to do this, and only then we can start fixing the mess I’m in right now, so… I have to get through the press conference, and only after that I’ll start to worry about everything else, okay?”
“You’d be right at that one” Bucky agreed “, and Sam has told me every news outlet is speaking about it - just so you know,
So he was parking in front of the Lake House in rather record time, a few members of his family hanging outside to enjoy the last few days of good weather before the impending autumn cold fell onto them, the rest probably helping with some cooking in the back of the house or the kitchen. Bucky was the one to see him first, as always, and openly laughed at his nephew.
There were a lot of things Peter could’ve said to that questions; a lot of answers did indeed cross his mind, and all of them, he was sure, were at least partly true. And yet, when it came down to it:
“And I get that” Peter nodded. And in truth, he did get it. He would never ask MJ to stop doing her job, to stop conquering a world he knew was hers… could never do it, either. But that didn’t mean things didn’t suck anymore, didn’t mean he stopped getting hurt by those actions. It was another part of the life he hated, another one he felt was extremely unfair, yet realistic. Looking back at MJ, he knew he’d always feel something for her, would always think she was one of the most amazing humans he’d ever meet “, and I’m proud of you for getting this far… I know things will only get better for you, M, I really do. I guess I just wanted to express how I felt”
Hi! Sorry for the delay... as I said in the previous chapter, I'm on a week off. And, that means my friends dragged me today to a club. It was fun, tho, so I forgive them
He decided to go into the Tower via his teenage room, aware his whole family would be already on the common floor (the ones able to make it, anyway), waiting for him. The young superhero took a moment to look at his room, not able to stop the rush of nostalgia that took hold of him. That room, the one he’d moved into when he was fifteen… seemed like a time capsule, like the reflection of the kid he’d been when everything had started, vastly different and yet the same person he was now. Peter stayed there for a few minutes, deep in thought, and then sighed and left for the elevator, not surprised at all when he saw his fathers at the living room, already having figured they’d wait for him, probably aware their son was going to choose a more discreet entrance.
“Everything’s okay, I guess” Bucky shrugged “. But your Uncle Sam sent me something this morning, and I think you should read it”
“Okay, I’ll believe you” Bucky sighed, taking his phone from his kid’s hands “. If you say so, I’ll do it. However, maybe keep yourself from revealing any big secrets, okay? It may be a good idea to shut up for a bit”
Oh my God, has anybody seen the Spiderman: Far From Home trailer? It was insanely good! And there were so many moments that just straight up made me tear up. If you haven't seen it and want to, go ahead! It's really good!
Hi! So, new chapter! Because I won't be able to upload tonight (my tonight, that is), I decided to upload a little bit sooner. And, because I uploaded the last one on... Monday, I think? Well, I thought about uploading today. Especially because I don't know if I'll be able tomorrow.
to do so, which in turn meant he’d thrown himself into his work for the past two years, dedicating the little free time he had to his family and friends. But the young genius was more than okay with that.
Let me know what you thought, please, I love to read your comments! And if you have an idea you want to see, just tell me!
“Well, we agree on one thing,” Harry said, clearly not bothered by the pieces of furniture that were still on fire and walking around them “, this ends tonight. The thing you’re not realizing yet, Parker, is that it’s not ending the way you think it is, or want to”
“Like my father did?” Harry asked weakly, with his skin looking sickly white and sweaty. Peter nodded through his tears, not daring to speak out-loud to answer that one. He could remember, faintly, that there were five other villains waiting for him to fight, could also remember his family going in his aid, but he didn’t know what was happening with that, if they had won or were still fighting. In those moments only Harry and he existed, both in their own little world for the very last time “. I really didn’t want to become him, Peter. And I did”
Hi guys! It's been a while since I last posted, but less than the last time, lmao. This is the first part of a three-part story!
“That’s true, yeah” Abeer laughed, clapping her hands together. And hell, a lot had happened since then. Just in the last few years, Peter had put on a fake step-down scenario just to be able to stop the New Green Goblin and what the public had named as the ‘Sinister Six’. After the press conference explaining everything, the young genius had taken some time for himself, laying low and only making appearances as Spider-Man and here and there for S.I. With the launch of the new wing, he’d stepped into public light again, much better than a few months before and surer of his words while standing impossibly straighter. Since then a few years had gone by, in which the young superhero had kept proving his words in the press conference had been true. Abeer had watched how Peter kept improving the new wing, how he’d started to take the leading position in both the Avengers and S.I; she’d seen him step into the role he’d been born to play with such grace and determination it was pretty impossible to claim he wasn’t the right person to occupy the positions he was holding. Now, at twenty-eight, Peter was finally fully in charge of the Avengers Team, almost looking like he’d always hold that title, and was pretty much the sole leader of S.I, with Pepper Potts appearing less and less and letting her nephew and sort-of-protege take lead. Now, with the newest product of Peter’s beloved wing dropping, the young Stark-Rogers was doing some press, and the journalist had some questions she’d been dying to ask; it’d been a few months since she had been able to interview Peter, after all “. The new products for the wing do look incredible though, so I’m glad you’re here to talk about them”
“Why?” Harry wanted to know, trying to get his enemy off of them “. Why do you keep doing this, why don’t you see how much easier it’d be if you gave it up”
Before any of you says something, I wanted to explain why the final fight was like that. So, a lot of you were thinking Peter was going to be kidnapped and saved by his Dads (almost all of you, or at least almost everyone who commented haha), and I received a few comments that had the theory of something bad happening to the husbands and it being Peter's fault...
-The world knows they have a son, but not his name or what he looks like. So, only Ned and May know about Peter's real family.
So a few weeks back I suddenly felt like it was time to come back to this. I revisited the whole thing, read everything since the first work (and omg, the evolution of the story and even my writing... I almost got whiplash lmao), and then I restructured the last two chapters. The penultimate not that much, the last one is completely new... I'll explain the changes once I publish it, if I do it now I feel like it'd be spoilers. And after this finishes... I am planning another Marvel story, although I want to take my time to write it and be happy with it. In the meantime, I'll try to write shorter stories... and possibly a small addition to this one. But no promises.
“There’s something else… something I think we really have to talk about” he whispered. Michelle nodded, giving him permission to go on. Peter sighed again and let her hand go, bringing his to rest in his lap “. I’ve loved you a lot, MJ. Still do, probably more than I’ve loved anybody else outside of my family. You were my first love, and the anchor to reality I needed after the War. Do you know that?”
“That they were” Natasha nodded “. But don’t forget you’re their kid, Peter. Every one of their best qualities you’ve inherited… you are the best possible combination of them, and their legacy. I know this may seem stressful, and it is, but don’t forget you belong here”
PS: yes I've seen the new Disney+ series, and yes I'm obsessed. I prefer TFAWS, but that's just because Sam and Bucky are some of my favorites and I adore their dynamic... but God, both are incredibly good.
Please leave a comment to tell me what you thought of this chapter, and thank you so much for reading!
“Because it’s gonna happen” Steve agreed “. Dear, whatever happens next it is gonna hurt our son… think about it: whether he manages to stop this whole thing or not- and we both know he will manage to do so, it’s gonna hurt him”
“He was just that” Tony guessed. Peter nodded timidly, confirming it wordlessly “. And, just a guess here, that’s why you were so mad every time I tried to get you away from him. I was trying to tear down the floor you were standing on, wasn’t I?”
“I know, Dad” Peter smiled “, I never thought you did. And I just… I don’t know what to feel. I knew this was inevitable, I knew Harry was not going to accept defeat, I just…”
“Is that… is that a knife poking out of Green Goblin’s chest?” Betty asked, horrified. MJ slowly nodded, too shocked to do anything else, just like everyone else. But alas, Betty had seen the end of Green Goblin, who soon enough lost his mask, being exposed then as Harry Osborn to the world. They saw Peter cradling Harry in his arms until it looked like the man had passed, and then continuing to rock them both, clearly distraught and out of himself with pain by it.
“Then let’s make it count” the young villain yelled, charging at Spider-Man. The superhero, however, could see it, so he jumped out of the way just in time, sending Green Goblin to the ground once again and then turning around to stop his punch and throwing in one of his own, although much weaker than it normally would’ve been, knowing he wanted to keep Harry as well as the situation provided.
Peter opened his mouth in surprise, although he was quick to close it. Damn, Abeer had gotten him with that one. In the last three years he had dated, although extremely casual and never intending to do something else than getting to have fun with the person. And it’d been fun, no strings attached and just wanting to spend some time with someone outside of his circle; it had never grown to something more, nor had Peter wanted to, but it’d been
Um, hey... yeah, I know I ended the last chapter with a little (really, really little) cliffhanger, but, well...Last chapter of this arc! Next one will move closer to the main story, which, obviously, will involve Peter.
“Hey, Auntie” he greeted Pepper, glad to see her again “, I’m really glad to see you. Hey Shuri, didn’t you go to rest?”
“Exactly” Harry agreed “. So here’s what we’re are going to do now that no one expects us to act. Listen closely, because it’s time to finish this off”
), but he still went with the polite way of finishing a meeting and shook hands with the board, walking to the exit with his Aunt next to him.
“Because of the live footage,” Peter guessed, only receiving a nod from his Aunt. He sighed after a moment, not even trying to read the article (his headache quickly convincing him of so), and handed the tablet to Shuri, letting her read the thing to calm her curiosity down. Pepper was raising an eyebrow at him in a silent question: what now?”. Auntie… would it be possible to make a press conference?”
So, this chapter starts a few months after Age of Ultron... Steve is reminded of the folder he has in his Studio, and he makes a decision about it...
“You’ve mentioned these new products are some of the last Shuri of Wakanda has done for the medical and prosthetic wing… with her moving back to Wakanda, what does this mean for S.I?
. He looks like this is where he wanted to be all along, doesn’t he? Like this is his true calling, like this? This is all he ever wanted”
“Mr.Osborn” Sandman said via the intercoms “. Electro, Doctor Octopus, and I are ready to go to Peter’s apartment.
“I mean, we’re not going to change, Peter” MJ pointed out, frowning “. We’re not going to wake up one morning and do a one-eighty to be able to match each other”
Don't be afraid to suggest an idea for a one shot/mini-story! After this next mini-story will come at least three suggested one shots. So don't be afraid to comment or suggest! Okay, bye!!
ALSO, I was thinking about creating a TELLONYM? Just for you guys to ask doubts if you want, and a way for you guys to show me ideas, or whatever... anyways, tell me what you think about it.
“So, and forgive me if I seem too intrusive or snoopy, but what does that mean for your love life? Now that you’re twenty-eight, are you thinking about settling down?”
PLEASE leave a comment so I know how you feel about the chapter, and I'll see you guys soon! Don't know if I'll post on Christmas. If I don't: Happy Christmas everyone!
“It’s his abdomen,” the engineer told both men, horrified beyond words “, he was stabbed with the same knife that killed Harry. FRIDAY says it also held a bit of potion to make it more lethal, it’s going into Peter’s system and blood… the little he’s not losing”
“I don’t know” Shuri murmured, still looking at the screen. The super husbands had already arrived, and Peter was put to lay on the ground, which only made things worse for all watching.
“Because Harry didn’t know that… new me, I guess. Last we’d seen of each other we’d been twelve or so, long before my life did a one-eighty. So…”
retired, but as of now she wasn’t on active duty. Still, she liked to be in briefings and debate strategies with the active members of the team, and Peter would be lying if he said he disliked it. The Avengers would
Michelle smiled at his words, looking back at her coffee for a long moment, silent comfortable, and light “. Well, I am happy to hear that” she said, smiling “. I’d miss you, idiot”
Tada! The chapter ended on a good note, but don't be fooled: there's a bit more angst before being finished with this story!
foundation. And I think I have to do this on my own… I think life is more than falling for someone and fighting for them, you know? I think it’s time I fight for myself, rather than someone else”
“I can’t leave him” Peter cried out, getting closer to Harry and resting a hand on his shoulder “. Harry? Harry, can you hear me? It’s okay, it’s gonna be okay, I…”
So, new chapter. Things are moving along, and there's going to be a ride full of surprises, so prepare yourselves.
I really hope you guys enjoyed it! By the way, have you seen the new trailer? I'm not saying anything in this note just in case someone hasn't seen it or doesn't want to see it, but I loved it!
The last test is next Monday, and after I do it I don't think I'll be writing. So, as sorry as I am, that means this week I won't be posting any chapters - as I said, I haven't had the chance to write. I hope you can all understand.
“So let me get this straight” the princess said, eerily calm “. You know what’s happening with Peter but don’t want to say because Peter’s your surrogate brother, is that it?”
I'll try to post the next part soon, but it depends on how my next finals goes, and if I have time to post here in the meantime.
