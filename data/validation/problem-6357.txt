“Tony, what’s wrong?” Steve crouched down and put a hand on Tony’s arm. Tony’s face was slack, his mouth hanging open, and his eyes wide. He was staring at the debris like it was the most dangerous thing he had ever seen. Well, it would have been pretty bad if it had landed on his face, but why hadn’t he moved to protect himself? Put his hands in front of his face or rolled away?
“Come on, you’re a man now. What’s all this racket? This is the fourth night in a row you’ve woken up screaming. What’s your problem?”
Barnes sauntered into the room with a presence that took up the entire room, and made you beg for more. His hair was slicked back and held by a hair band, his smile was smooth and slippery, his clothes were all black: shirt, leather pants, and coat. His scarf was the only exception, pure white, and with its soft, downy texture, Tony was vividly reminded of swans and their soft feathers. Tony watched, transfixed, as Barnes sauntered his way into the ballroom, not getting in anyone’s way and yet somehow the center of attention.  Then he turned around, in his all black ensemble, and surveyed the room. When his eyes met Tony across the room, he winked. Tony nearly dropped his champagne glass, but Barnes just kept on looking as if he hadn’t even seen him.
He was never taught to swim, and he has never been so happy about that until now. For the first time in a long time, perhaps the first time since he came into the world and killed his mother, Tony felt calm. Relief. Finally, it was going to be over. No more running after things that weren’t meant for him, no more wondering what it was that he lacked that made him so unloveable, as if he was cursed by some magician. He could just … not be anymore. It was wonderful.
“Sunset Bain. Ring a bell? She’s the woman around whose finger you’ve recently been wrapped around. Now she’s running around with the ability to speak with full royal authority, because you,” the King speared the air in front of Tony, hard enough for Tony to feel it, “couldn’t keep it in your pants.”
“You’re welcome. You’re a good teammate, Tony.” Really, Steve? He had held Tony to his chest like he was a child just because he was good to have on the battlefield? Steve didn’t know, and he knew even less what else to say. He closed his mouth, feeling his throat close up. He suddenly felt oppressively awkward, with no idea how to go from here. Hoping this wasn’t a bad choice, he nodded and turned to leave.
The doorknob to Tony’s room turned, and Tony grimaced. He didn’t want to see anyone, but it didn’t matter what he wanted. The door opened, and revealed his father in the doorway.
They had had a lovely dinner in a fancy restaurant, and had talked about electronics and the latest developments in the field. Sunset had been charming, hanging off of his every word, and Tony had felt like he was on top of the world, like he was the luckiest man alive. Then Sunset had come home with him, kissed him breathless, and asked for a tour. Tony had dutifully shown her all the beautiful rooms in the palace, but Sunset had seemed less interested in the decour, and more in how much of Tony’s skin she could touch without taking any of his clothes off. But then they reached Tony’s father’s office, and Sunset seemed to perk up.
Steve was following Tony as they made their way stealthily through the hideout. It itched at Steve, to listen to the fight going on at the front door and not help, but that wasn’t his job right now. They needed Tony to access the main database to find out what, exactly, these people were up to. Steve was going along to watch his back while he was searching the database. Steve felt that Iron Man didn’t need anyone’s protection, but those were his orders. He would protect Tony.
That was Tony-speak for ‘hurts like hell’. Steve bit back a sigh and just continued to card his fingers gently through Tony’s curls. They were soft; a little fluffy from the rain of last night. “You gonna have some of the toast Thor’s making?” He asked, before adding, “sorry, that made it sound like a question. Have the toast Thor’s making, Tony.”
Bucky was doing well though, and Clint and Scott had been able to go home and see their families, so that was good. Steve focused on training as much as he could, saving people wherever they needed saving. That was all he had left to do. It was the only thing he still cared about, really. All he had left to do.
“Okay, cool. Uh. I’m outside your door right now, so…” Steve laughed awkwardly, “Just wanted to make sure I was still welcome before I barged in, y’know.”
Steve huffed in surprise as Tony pulled two out and offered one to Steve. “Where the hell did you find them? And since when did you
“All that’s going to do is get you lost with them, Steve,” Clint snapped irritably, “come on, just—”
When Steve said nothing in response, Tony sighed, shutting his eyes and pulling Steve’s hand up further to press warm lips against his knuckles. “I don’t think you’re a killing machine,” he continued, the vibrations in his voice running along the skin of Steve’s hand, “I never have. I think you’re an artist. You create far more than you could ever destroy. You make me actually believe the world might be a better place than I think it is, Steve—and listen, I know this is… in hindsight, I see how blurting out my proposal in a hospital room after you’ve just been put through hell was probably not, uh, the wisest timing I could have picked, but… but I mean it. I just want you to know that. You don’t have to answer right now. Or at all. But that’s what I think. And that won’t ever change.” Tony nodded, then, and clamped his mouth shut, apparently finished. His eyes darted nervously up at Steve’s face, before they moved back down to his lap.
Steve recognised the jacket before he even recognised the guy wearing it. Although, to be fair, he did have his head bowed. It would only have taken a flash of those blue eyes and Steve would have known instantly.
He turned to Steve, mouth opening, trying to think of something to say. But he was distracted by Rhodey, who, after setting down the dishes filled with carrots and brussel-sprouts, bent down and wrapped him in a gentle hug. “Good to see you up and awake,” his best friend said, ruffling Tony’s hair softly, “you had me worried for a second there.”
“You know I’m trying to look out for you, right?” Bucky asked anxiously, “I know I’m an asshole and I know I acted like an idiot last night, but I promise, I didn’t mean to- to control you or anything, I just…” he looked down, and then turned to face Steve with a sad smile. “You’re pretty much all I got, pal.”
“It’s funny how Steve only ever gets himself into shit when you’re around, isn’t it?” Bucky asked, hand holding firm to Steve’s shoulder, “funny how you’re always the one to ride in and save him, so very fucking conveniently.”
Bucky blinked when Peggy smacked him over the head. "Ignore him, Steve, you know he's just being overly protective. Tony's crazy about you."
This was ridiculous. And it was all well and good saying they should never have let it get this far, but the truth was, Tony had known all along about the consequences. He’d known and he’d tried to ignore it, deny it. They cared about Peter, sure, but not
There was also another little nugget of information that had been quite interesting to find out upon awaking, and it was that he could still hear inside Tony’s head. Not quite as clearly as when they’d both been holding onto the infinity stones, and it faded with distance, but according to Thor, the stones must have permanently created a link between their minds, joining them together like magnets. Even now that they were gone, their impact still remained. Now, if Maria was curled up in Thor’s lap sleeping in their joint hospital room, they didn’t need to risk waking her up in order to talk.
“Can we please focus up on the task ahead of us, gentlemen?” Natasha asked tiredly, “we still need to find where the main laboratory is.”
“Oh- sorry sir, I’m going, I’m going,” Steve mumbled in embarrassment, pulling his bag hurriedly off the bag and then shoving all his shit inside quickly- how the fuck had he not noticed the whole classroom emptying? Thoughts about Tony were dangerous things, and far too easy to get lost in.
Steve leaped to his feet, frown heavy on his face, but before he could even run out of the room Bucky pushed open the door and joined them instead.
So we all know how much of a sucker Steve is for Tony when he’s in his element in the workshop, with his grease-stained face and tight tank tops etc. But I also feel like Tony would be exactly the same for Steve when he’s painting.
“This isn’t healthy, buddy,” Natasha told him, voice quiet as she opened the door to the roof. Steve’s hands were curled around the railings, neck craned up to the sky. He knew it was stupid, that he probably looked a fool. But it was just… comforting. To know that somewhere out there, Tony was coming back. “It’s been four days, no sign. If he wasn’t killed in the fight on that ship, there’s a fifty-percent chance he was taken in the—”
Loki laughed, standing up and patting Steve on the shoulder as he moved across the room. “Funny,” he commented, “I’m going to make more coffee. Want in?”
“Thor?” Steve blurted in surprise, and the boy’s head jerked over to him, eyes going wide before they registered it was only Steve and relaxed, “what are you doing down here?” He looked down at his watch. If Thor had managed to get all the way down to the bottom of the hill in the two minutes that school had ended, and been there for long enough to light up, then the guy must’ve goddamn sprinted.
He watched Tony flail his hands for a second, trying to find an answer to Steve’s question. “Well. See now- that would ruin the surprise, wouldn’t it?”
“In another life, you should have been an actor,” Clint commented idly, not looking away from the phone that was hovering an inch from his face while he lay on the counter. Steve scowled at him before turning back to Peter with an exhausted sigh, and Tony chose that moment to make himself heard, clearing his throat softly and then moving behind Steve. His hand slid over the man’s shoulder and Steve glanced up at him, his face softening immediately.
see his obvious crush at this point- he was pretty sure the hermits that lived in caves on the other side of the world were aware of it.
“Is she okay?” Steve stumbled to his knees and took Natasha in. She was bleeding from her head and her arm was bent funnily. For a second, there was only the terror of a negative answer.
refused to help do any of the dinner prep in favour of just sitting here and holding your hand while you slept.” She huffed and shook her head. “You’re absolutely on washing-up duty, by the way.”
Peter banged his hands on the table, the thing he was holding making a sharp metallic clang as it hit. Tony looked at it curiously, before- “NATASHA,
“Hey, I mean, don’t get your hopes up or anything,” Tony babbled under Steve’s mouth, even as his hands flexed excitedly around Steve’s shoulders, “I probably won’t get in, not with my history, but I just wanted to try, you know, I thought I could give it a go. The headmaster knows me- I've been in contact with him for a while, thanks to Yinsen, actually. He knows my potential, even if I am a little asshole.”
“I’m sorry, Rogers, but I think you’re confused,” he said softly, slamming his locker door shut, “I don’t know where you’ve come from, but here? You don’t get to tell people like me what to do.”
“Well, for starters, one of them just melted straight through the reinforced doors.” Tony put more thrust into the repulsors. “We need to keep the ones remaining outside focused on SHIELD and not the surrounding buildings. Those civilians are sitting ducks in there.”
And suddenly, Steve had started pulling on Tony’s wrist and dragging him forward, a big grin on his face as he whispered “take me to the most hidden spot in this damn penthouse Tony.”
The following few days were spent in a blur of dates, quiet nights in and stolen kisses, Tony’s smile at the forefront of Steve’s mind for pretty much every moment of it. Steve knew that it was Tony’s way of trying to make it up to him for the kind of disastrous date of earlier, and as much as he tried to tell Tony that it was okay, it had just been a misunderstanding, Tony seemed not to hear it. He was excellent at selective hearing, as Steve was finding out; although he’d had to put his foot down when Tony had tried to invite him along to a night spent with all the friends that they’d both met on the street that one time. Tony had seemed desperate to try and prove that it hadn’t been shame that had motivated him, but Steve refused to put that risk on Tony’s shoulders. Those were the friends that made life more difficult for Steve, and he wanted no part in making that any worse.
There was a short silence. Tony turned his head to look at him again, the hint of a frown on his face. “Hmm,” was all he said.
The whole team were positively beaming, and everyone seemed to have forgotten how to stand still- even Steve was fiddling with his hands as Tony read through the first note.
He wanted to go home, right up until he thought about how Steve was going to react, and then suddenly not even the tower offered relief. They’d done this before – the PR nightmares, the leaks. It was just a part of being famous, a part of Tony’s life that he loathed with a blood-curdling passion, but had simply learned to deal with. For Steve, though, it was probably still fairly new. And every time Tony went down, Captain America’s name went down with him. No doubt the trash mags would already be writing their
Quickly, he capped the lid back onto the pen, then shoved them away thoughtlessly. “That’s better,” he said, smiling up at Steve.
Steve laughed. He was beautiful when he laughed. “Okay,” he agreed quietly, taking the other end of the cracker. Looking at Tony with amusement, he tugged on one end while Tony did the other, and a second later there was a crack as it burst. Around the table, the noise was repeated by everyone else.
“i think the stars would be very proud to know that their atoms created something as impossible as you,” he says quietly, instead.
"And I take it Zeke was fucking around with him, then?" Steve pushed, and the way Tony's lip curled in distaste gave away the truth instantly.
Thor stopped throwing Peter up, instead merely holding him with a small frown. “So what happens now?” He asked.
She pushed the door open and then slipped into school, Steve following behind and trying to avoid various kids as they made their way down the corridor. She turned to him after getting through the crowds and smiled. “You know what I mean. He’s… I- before, he was just-“ she ran a hand through her hair and then shrugged, “he was lonely.”
Tony pursed his lips, leaning back against the wall and trying not to feel Steve’s gaze burning into the side of his face.
He swished the water around absently, taking Peter’s arm and gently swiping across it, rubbing at it to remove any sticky substances he’d managed to get ahold of. Peter burbled away in his own language as he worked, and Tony found himself talking back easily, about random things he could think of off the top of his head. He’d heard somewhere that that was how babies learned to talk, and hey, it couldn’t hurt.
“All civilians are now safely evacuated and any enemies have been neutralised. Do you want me to fly over to Times Square?”
Well, that answered the question of how Tony had managed to get here last night. “Right,” he said, shuffling into the driver’s seat and then carefully pulling out and disconnecting the wires that JARVIS directed him to. Soon, all the cables lay loose amongst the car, allowing the computer, and therefore JARVIS who was trapped inside it, to be moved.
He supposed, however, that being in company as he went through more of the data would probably be comforting. At the very least, it was someone to share his anger with. Someone who understood in the same way Tony did.
“Fuck off,” Steve spat, then looked on in surprise as Bruce came around the corridor alongside him, also escorted by teachers. Then Sam followed, and Clint and Natasha too, until all five of them were getting frogmarched down the hallways, presumably to the Principal’s office. Steve seethed, chest heaving as he shook the sweat and blood out of his eyes. People were staring at them as they went, but he didn’t give a fuck. Not one.
from him that it hurt just to think about. But here, now… it wasn’t so bad, now that Steve had just allowed himself to get attached. Tony had become his best friend of this new time, and his sharp teasing and gentle smiles and explosive temperament had found itself lodging right into Steve’s heart, becoming something he didn’t want to live without. The new world was terrifying and big and lonely, but staying in the tower with Tony had been the best decision he could have made. It gave him purpose. It gave him… hope.
“What other choice do we have?” Thor snapped, “the best chance we have of getting to him in time is if we call a large-scale search party. This mountain is too big to search alone and without equipment.”
Steve laughed louder this time, and he looked down at Tony, who was still staring avidly above them.
He watched in complete fascination as Tony shut his eyes and let the music roll over him, fingers working back and forth to the tune of Für Elise. The notes were soft and soothing, slightly slower than what it normally sounded like, turning it into more of a lullaby than anything else. Steve knew it was for his benefit- Tony had nothing pressing on his mind that needed working through, but he was aware of how much Steve adored hearing him play. He thought it would soothe Steve’s mind- and, of course, he was right. Steve smiled dimly to himself as he rested his cheek against the cushions, the niggling afterthoughts of his horrible night’s sleep slipping easily away as the melodic music filled the room, just as Tony had thought it probably would.
Tony didn’t speak for a moment, but then he smiled lopsidedly. “I’ve seen better days, Winghead,” he murmured, “but I’ll live.”
, you know. Save them for special occasions. Or maybe I’ll do them all at once, and make you my slave for the day.”
Steve huffed, rolling his eyes and letting his head drop against the back of the couch. “Funny, that’s what Peggy said.”
Tony murmured something incoherent, but followed Steve’s lead and let the boy wipe him down until he was as clean as could be without a shower. There were still bits of bright green in his hair, but Steve would let Tony worry about that later. For now-
“Want is a universal thing,” Steve said quietly, filling up the heavy silence with his beautiful voice, “but resistance isn’t. The fact you’ve done the latter is something I’m
He just shrugged, picking at a hangnail to try and find something to do with his hands. “Well. You don’t want to be- y’know- seen with me? Around your richer friends. Which is… I
She just smiled. “T’challa owes me a favour. I think he came in on his own personal jet, which I imagine is pretty speedy.”
He turned to Tony slowly, and watched the other boy’s eyes fall on him in curiosity. Without a word, Steve lifted his leg and slipped it over Tony’s lap, straddling him.
Steve nodded slowly as Tony sighed and then turned away. His head was down and his shoulders hunched, and he walked a few steps away from Steve in order to glare intently at his bike, parked messily by the curb in front of Bucky’s house. “There’s something wrong with me,” he declared in the end, before laughing, “well, there’s a lot of things wrong with me. But that- I don’t know. That’s dangerous, Steve. You saw that today. I didn’t care about hurting you. I just wanted to keep myself out of trouble.”
“Mm, probably,” Tony agreed, licking his lips nervously as he thought about what awaited for him when they got Peter to bed. He still had to go through all that fucking data. All the information and files. It wasn’t going to be fun.
He pulled Steve further forward, and Steve just went gladly, letting his knees buckle as he fell into Tony’s lap and then pressed the side of his cheek into the other boy’s shoulder. Tony curled around him immediately; an embrace that screamed protection, whilst his hands just trailed soothingly over Steve’s spine.
“Don’t you dare,” Tony clamped a hand over his mouth firmly, “You might all be young and agile, but I’m on the wrong side of forty and have a nice lavender-scented bubble bath just waiting for me at home. No chance.”
Creeping down the stairs quickly, he did up his coat and then grabbed his keys off the side before opening the door as quietly as he could. The night was pitch black but fairly warm- not too bad. At least Tony wouldn’t freeze.
Tony briefly thought about how glad he was about the fact that he had not, in fact, died in that cabin. And that his friends were all willing to move their Christmas-slash-Boxing Day meal down into the medical bay so that they could share it with him in here. And that they were all as insane, irritating and amazing as they were.
Tony considered the question, breathing through his nose as Bruce approached him, the knife glowing an ominous dark red. “I think it’s pur—”
“Look, I know you say you don’t do Halloween or whatever, but it’d be lowkey, just you and the rest of the guys coming over. We could eat shitty candy and take cool pictures and whatever, and just have fun. Be relaxed. Like any other party, except with more fake blood and toffee apples.” Tony smiled at him reassuringly, but for whatever reason Steve didn’t seem to be taking the bait. His smile was gone entirely now, and he slipped out of Tony’s grip, taking the bag of onions to the chopping board and picking up a knife to begin cutting again.
Steve nodded, stifling a yawn and looking down at Clint worriedly, as he lay passed out across the floor. He’d lost quite a bit of blood that night. “Sure. Get some rest, Tash.”
The next time he woke up, he felt a little more like himself. Mainly because his head was fucking throbbing, and he could think in a clear train of coherent thoughts, which was nice.
He heard someone knock on the door, and checked his watch. Natasha, undoubtedly- there to try and offer them whatever aid she could. Possibly in the form of Russian Vodka- although Steve would not be participating in the consumption of that. It tasted like nail varnish remover. Either Sam or Bucky opened the door, and a few seconds later Steve heard the room opposite go mysteriously silent.
“IT’S YOU TWO!” Peter yelled, jerking upward again and throwing his hands in the air. “God, this is the first time you’ve been this close to each other in ages! I haven’t seen you look each other in the eye when you’re around one another except to argue! Why the hell are you both being so
“That’s my jacket,” he said dumbly, blinking a few times as he registered the dark red button-up Tony had strung over his forearm. “Why… but they took that.”
“It’s nice to see you awake, мой дорогой.” Her hand settled at his forehead, feeling his temperature. The smile turned downward. “I’m afraid you’re about to be in for an unpleasant few hours though.”
Ty had told him when he’d first smacked Tony, aged fifteen and in the back-room of some party Tony could hardly even remember
Tony smiled as Steve huffed again, turning around and properly squashing his cheek into Tony’s shoulder. “Don’t be pathetic,” he muttered.
“Do I give a shit whether you’re prepared?” Howard snapped again, and this time, Steve heard the bedsprings react to Tony’s flinch, “I told you to do this for me, ‘cause it’s millions of dollars on the line that you’re gonna undoubtedly wanna fritter away on drugs and beer, so get your stupid ass into a suit and go meet them. Now. Be damn useful for once in your life.”
When Steve walked out of the door the next morning and began his journey to the bus station two minutes down the road, the last thing he expected to see was Bucky.
Slowly, he lifted a shaking hand off the bed and tentatively intertwined it with Tony’s own, feeling the comforting warmth of his partner’s grasp. Tony hummed imperceptibly and squeezed his fingers before they went lax again, and Steve let his thumb settle ever so softly down upon Tony’s slender wrist. Steve’s hands were so much bigger than Tony’s; he enveloped them easily, and he kind of loved that. He loved that it felt as if Tony was simply made to fit him, perfect and right.
I know that there isnt much substance to this and that it's pretty short, but I just wanted to write something and get me back into the swing of the story seeing as it's been a while since I updated. So! Some more relationshippy fluff, and general wholesomeness. Savour it while you can. Shit's going to go down soon.
“Sir!” He called, jumping about theatrically on his feet, “can I please go to the bathroom? I’m really desperate.”
“Well, first of all, it’s not my arms that are magical Iron Man beacons,” Tony grouched, hurrying over to the large double-glazed windows at the other side of the room and peering over his shoulder to the door. “It’s the very small and very cool nodes that I’ve implanted under my skin that are the beacons. And look at where this place is stationed. You’re in the middle of New York, Steve, bracketed between a bank and a college. You think they’re gonna be happy if they can’t use their phones within ten feet of your building?” Tony shook his head and then raised his hand expectantly to Steve. “The signal will be on one side of walls, and it’ll face inward. Like aiming a hose at a certain flower bed. There might be the smallest amount of interference to maybe knock out a regular phone, considering the proximity, but these implants aren’t regular by any means. They’ll find a signal.”
He sunk back into the wall, suddenly unsteady. Steve was going to break up with him, for sure. Because Tony was a fucking insensitive dick and absolutely deserved it. God, he’d implied Steve wasn’t
He nodded, and she noted some more things down before beginning talking again; mostly stuff that went in one ear and out the other, because she’d been right about him being out of it that day. His mind was elsewhere, and he happily let it drift as she spoke- thinking about Bucky and his new car that had already broken down on the road when he’d been supposed to pick Natasha up for their date night, about Tony’s laughing face and promise to help him fix it up for free rather than spend a fortune at the garage. Bucky sure had been grateful for that, and Steve was absolutely convinced they were friends now- no matter what they kept muttering when Steve asked them.
They met up with Clint and Nat on the ominously quiet basement stairwell. Tony couldn’t get any readings from the floor due to the anti-infiltration measures that had been put in place, but by the lack of gunfire or mayhem, he was going to go ahead and say it wasn’t swarming, at the very least.
Tony looked at him, and Rhodey looked back, some silent conversation containing words no one else would ever hear passing between them. “Hey, honeybear,” Tony said throatily in the end, the endearment cracking halfway through. He still tried to smile, but it came out flat. Steve gave his hand a squeeze.
THIS IS LONG AS FUCK but basically I asked around a few places to see what people were interested in, and a lot of you came back to me with like. Friendship dynamics and stuff, so I figured??? Let's give it  a go? But it ended up being 20k, whoops. My bad.
“Don’t frown at me,” Tony huffed out a laugh and flicked gently at the crease that had formed in Steve’s brow, “I was being super nice then and everything-“
Something settled on his chest. Warm. A hand. It stroked, soft, along his collarbone. “Tony, love, it’s gonna be okay. I’ve got you. We’re gonna be fine.”
“Clint came down the stairs and you looked like you were literally about to be murdered, so you launched yourself across the table and kissed me like it was the last time you ever would, and of course that was enough to persuade me to defend you from the oncoming wrath of Barton when he discovered his favourite box of cereal in the trash.”
Steve wrapped his sketchbook delicately and then took the sweater, a little dumbfounded. His dancer was staring down at him in concern, toes wiggling from the cold. “Jesus Fucking Christ, it’s freezing out here, art-boy, how do you do this every Friday?”
But Steve hadn’t seemed… well, he hadn’t been enthusiastic at all when Tony had first broached the subject with a smile and a little jig. He’d just shrugged indifferently and told him that none of them ever made plans for Halloween. That they didn’t celebrate it. And then before Tony could even respond to that, he’d changed the subject swiftly and moved along like it’d never happened. Then, when Tony tried again a few days later, Steve did the same thing. Said that he didn’t watch horror films because they were shit, and before Tony could argue that
Tony always did so much for him. Steve just wanted to return the favour. “Come on,” he whispered encouragingly, squeezing Tony’s hip, “say yes. Let’s fuck off to Ohio for a bit, forget everything else.”
“Steve…” Clint sighed heavily, “this is just our life, man. It’s fucked up. But I can’t promise you that I’m gonna fucking kill if you hurt him again, that’s not just something you can ask me to do. You’re not thinking straight right now, okay, but it’s going to get better. Just give it time to heal.”
The room he was in was a sterile white, full of metal trays and machinery. Steve was laying on a cot extending from the wall, and the rhythmic beeping sound coming from somewhere above his head told him that he was probably hooked up to a monitor or two. He attempted to shift a little, and found that the pain was still there, but far less prevalent than the last time Steve had been conscious. That was certainly a positive. Maybe the stab-wound hadn’t gone as deep as he’d previously imagined.
“Steve Rogers,” Tony declared, kissing his forehead and looking at him with outright adoration, plain to see in his eyes, “please never ever change.”
He found Tony’s hand and linked their fingers together, smiling at him reassuringly. Tony looked down at their intertwined fingers for a second- and he looked so fucking confused, like he really just hadn’t expected any of that at all. Steve squeezed their hands tighter.
His head shot up, trying to pick Natasha out of the crowds. It wasn’t entirely difficult, what with the fiery red of her hair, and he was hurrying over to her as soon as he’d gotten his sights set on the woman. There was something uncomfortable settling in his chest, but he pushed it away. There could be a variety of reasons for this. Maybe Steve had had to take off the uniform for whatever reason. Maybe it was perfectly explainable.
“Yeah? Much as I hate to say it, you’re bruised pretty often, darling,” Tony responded, looking at the little spots of blue that littered his arm more closely. Then, of course, the penny dropped and his eyes widened. “Wait a second,” he looked back to Steve, “did Peter do this?”
Tony just rolled his eyes. “Guess it’ll do. Usually this would be the time when I make you apologise to Pepper for dragging me out of all her meetings, but seeing as she can induce cardiac arrest upon healthy people, I would rather not expose you to her.” He pulled his phone from his back pocket and then wearily shucked his contacts up onto the screen, finding Pepper almost immediately and lifting it apprehensively to his ear.
Steve was the exception, obviously, because he’d been under some stupid mind control, but the point still stood. And maybe, one day, he’d snap too. For real. Tony could drive even the best men to the worst things, if he put his mind to it, after all.
“Same as I was five minutes ago,” he said, raising an eyebrow, “shitty, but alive, I guess. Silver linings.”
“Right,” Tony nodded, stepping forward and trying not to feel like an embarrassing burden, “thanks.”
“Tony!” Steve’s voice was desperate now, “Tony, just… I’m coming in, okay? I need to know you’re alright. I won’t touch you, I promise. Not unless you want me to.”
He took a breath and raised his courage, lifting his head up and then tilting Steve’s head downward with his hand. Slowly, he pressed a small and almost nervous kiss against Steve’s mouth. Steve smiled against it and kissed back, his lips warm and soft and strangely familiar, despite the fact Tony had never done this before. It felt like this was normal, like it was simply meant to be.
Tony snapped, “Steve… Steve, it’s fucking over. It’s done. Thanos, he won. And we—Steve, we got lucky, honey, we both made it out alive, managed to find something in this mess, we can’t risk that. We can’t risk throwing all this away on a whim.”
Behind their line of sight, Tony’s hand tightened a fraction around Steve’s. But Steve just nodded casually and turned, facing them all. “That’s me,” he answered with a tight smile.
He walked slowly over to the empty chair, and then sat down in one fluid motion, looking over at Tony. Tony’s head was turned to the opposite wall. Every muscle in his body was taut, still. Steve tried to think of what to start with. He knew he didn’t have long, after all.
"Right," he said tightly, "yeah, sure, we can deal with it for the night." He looked dubiously over to the bundled baby in Tony's arms, taking a deep breath and straightening his back. "How hard can it be?"
They were only like, two years younger than him, but whatever. The sharp decline in the give-a-fuck-O-meter usually happened halfway through Freshman year, so they still had a bit of time left until all that energy disappeared off the face of the earth.
“yes, thank you mother, I’m aware I probably should have worn some more layers, but in my defence, I wasn’t expecting it to rain so hard.”
Steve huffed, rolling over and sliding his arms around Tony’s waist. He pressed a soft kiss into Tony’s hair, and the man sighed happily, tucking himself further into Steve’s hold.
” Tony pulled out of Steve’s grip and turned his back, so Steve couldn’t see the traitorous red of his eyes. “You made me worried
Steve’s mouth opened in nervousness, but Tony’s response, surprisingly, was completely fluid, and his voice calm. He sounded unbothered and nonchalant; entirely different to the wild panic that Steve had glanced in his eyes before he’d been hauled out of sight. “Just jumped onto the bed and knocked the desk. Thought you were still with Obie?”
He clamped his eyes shut and curled his hands around the cool rim of his arc reactor. He was not there. He was here. He was not in Afghanistan. He was in New York. He was not dying. He was okay.
“Walk away, Stane,” he said, voice low as he wandered forward, “turn around and fuck off, right now.”
Natasha froze for a good few seconds, before sighing dramatically and patting him on the shoulder. “Oh baby, you really think that’s it, don’t you?”
or whatever horrible things everyone else liked to say about him, of course not, but- but he’d just sort of expected Tony to be more open to it, that was all. They’d had some pretty intense making-out sessions together, after all, but the furthest Steve had managed to get was pulling Tony’s shirt over his head before the boy ended up stopping them or getting distracted and then – well, then that was it. They did this any longer, and Steve was going to develop a complex or something- because he
Steve stared at him, mouth moving imperceptibly as he tried to find the bravery to say what he’d been thinking, ever since he’d laid eyes on Tony lying beaten on Thor’s couch at 11 in the evening. “You would never have put yourself in this position if it wasn’t for me,” he said in the end, his voice quiet. It hurt just to say, just to Goddamn
“Yeah, idiot, it’s yours,” Sam rolled over and snatched the phone from his back pocket. Steve went to grab it, but Sam pulled his hand away, eyebrows raising smugly. “Oh, and guess who it is?”
“Understood,” he said, readjusting his bag once again and pushing the sight of that tiny knowing smile out of his mind, “show me to the ‘best group in school’ then.”
Tony laughed, patting Steve gently on the shoulder and kissing him on the cheek. “Welcome to fatherhood, babe.”
Steve tried not to think about it. Tony had said he’d come- so Tony was going to come. He hadn’t bailed for someone else’s party. He hadn’t suddenly decided that he actually hated Steve and wanted nothing to do with him or any of his friends.
Steve pursed his lips, hands flexing underneath him. He’d worked out the timelines of it all. “And before that, he woke up in a hospital thinking about how he was lucky to escape from me with his life,” he said bitterly, looking up at Natasha, “what did he say about it?”
—was keeping his weapons cache, it was somewhere in the US then. Steve stored the information away, all the while compressing his anger at the whole situation. Tony was manipulating Steve into trusting him, saying that those weapons wouldn’t harm innocent people, when in reality he was simply planning to grab them for himself and use them for his own gain. And okay, it wasn’t like Steve was the angel in this scenario- after all, he was also manipulating Tony into giving away information under the guise of mutual trust, but
Tony couldn’t talk. Didn’t have a clue what to say even if he could. He thought about getting on his knees and begging Steve to stay, seeing where that led him.
“SHIELD have any non-bulletproof windows we can smash through?” Tony responded, cradling his arm in his good hand, “in fact, maybe if we just got to the outskirts of the building it would be enough. I don’t know. Would you happen to have any idea where the blocker is coming from?”
He saw Natasha and Clint as he did a quick once-over of the deck, and Clint did a little salute before swinging the butt of his pistol across the temple of some poor HYDRA soldier. Steve grinned back.
Obadiah Stane has not taken Toni’s ascension to power with any sort of grace or aplomb, especially when he finally got a good eyeful of just how smart and ruthless and stubborn she really was. “Weapons built your fortune, Toni,” he says, leaning forward on her desk by the tips of his fingers. She wonders if he thinks looming intimidatingly over her will work
Steve sighs, rubs his face tiredly, and sits down on the edge of the hospital bed, staring at his reflection. Three days after waking from a coma, and he’s still just as lost and confused as he was the moment he opened his eyes. He tries to connect to what Peggy describes is their life, their experiences, but he doesn’t connect to any of it. Dr. Fennhoff tells him it’s a lingering aftereffect of the coma, warns that he may never recover his memories but he should still try. Tells him to look at the documents Peggy’s brought from their home, look at the service records Dr. Fennhoff retrieved from SHIELD, for whom he apparently works. Look at the footage of him fighting Iron Man in a secure base somewhere, even though it’s grainy and blurry and in black-and-white, terrible quality that keeps jumping around and going staticky, and he’d be hard pressed to say the one not in armor is him.
The smile fades when the door closes behind them, and Toni stares at the door, hip cocked and hand on her chin. She watches through the glass as Rhodey and Carol make their way down the hall towards the elevator, noting how Rhodey’s hovering,  walking half a pace behind Carol, one hand palm forward behind her back, probably not touching, but ready to lend support at the slightest hint of trouble.
Steve makes a startled, strangled noise, and Toni’s cackling in delight because she’s taken him by surprise. His spine bows backward, arms pinwheeling, and Toni hastily scissors her ankles apart, rolling away before she gets squashed under a toppling supersoldier.
romance right now,” she says, with the underscore of a snarl, and it occurs to him that he didn’t mean to say all that out loud, but he apparently did. “I don’t want gentle, I don’t soft kisses and slow touches and whatever other bullshit you think I
She swats at his hand in reflex, and yelps as she hits metal instead of skin. “I dunno,” she says, scowls and shakes her hand briskly. “Why? I mean, if you’re asking for a race, James, you’re going to win.”
she replied shakily, as tears filled her eyes, as the bodies of her people drifted in frozen death around her. Verdandi, Urd, Tyr and Freya.
Bucky sits the fuck down, right next to Steve, who’s holding his bleeding face with one broad hand, eyes wide and shocked above the line of his fingers.
He loved this park. He had spent many hours escaping from his own duties right here on the soft grass by the river bank, and he would watch the swans. There were swans that came to the river that the authorities begged people not to feed. They were awkward and weird birds, and could break your arm if you bothered them. Tony loved them wholeheartedly.
“What the heck is the matter with you?” a harsh, familiar voice says, and Tony flinches with his whole body. Thoughts of dark shadows and being pulled apart enter his mind, but that was just a dream. Starks aren’t afraid of dreams. Starks are made of iron.
“Hmm? Oh, yes, I was just talking to Sir Barnes just now. That young man is very intelligent, you should have heard what he had to say about the current political situation of our country, and how a democracy would ruin all of us. It’s insane what people are saying nowadays, about becoming a democratic government, but Sir Barnes had the perfect responses for them. You could take him as an example, son. You never seem to have any idea what’s going on outside of your own workshop. Maybe if you poked your head out once, you’d see some of the things that are going on.”
“No, now, you listen. It’s no wonder your father prefers talking to someone like Barnes, who is so much more learned than you and actually knows how to talk to people. I bet he was never found talking to a picture. If you want to get better, you need to do better, Tony. Your father isn’t going to go easy on you just because you’re his son.”
Obadiah Stane became the King’s advisor shortly after Queen Maria had died, and worked his way up the ranks ever since until he was now the most important person in the country after the King himself. Who carried a talisman in his pocket.
“...so I’m going to need you to attend galas in his place, okay?” It was Obie. He walked through the doors and slipped something in his hand into his pocket. He was talking to another man next to him, who was quite good looking, with unusually long hair and lovely eyes. “We’re going to need someone who understands the complex political situation, so you’ll understand if something is amiss. If we can get it back without anyone knowing, that would be the best case scenario...”
“Yes. There were unexpected side effects, I will admit. But maybe this can help us. Please, Tony,” Steve squeezed his hands, “you’re my only hope.”
Tony used to have an old magician’s wand, but that was confiscated, of course. Instead, he asked the nurses to let him walk around the palace grounds, where he was able to pick up some sticks of yew tree. Then he had threaded pieces of these into three machines he set up at equal distances around his circle, and hoped it would be good enough. He wondered what he would do if he failed. But that thought lead nowhere good, so he stopped.
Tony looks around him and sees his room in the royal quarters. His heart is racing and his breath is coming painfully fast, but the dream is falling away like water through a sieve.
Tony stood for moment staring after the disappearing car, stunned. His heart suddenly started pounding loud enough to fill his ears. His lungs struggled to bring in oxygen. He felt light-headed.
“Your highness, have you had too much to drink? I didn’t see anything stronger than champagne out there, but you’re not acting like yourself.”
“Okay.” Tony noticed that Sunset was leading them along the side of the room where less would see them, keeping in the shadows where possible, but he decided not to comment.
The story of the knight of America, Steve Rogers, was a story near and dear to his heart. He should grow out of it, he knew, but he could never manage it. This was why Sunset thought he was childish. It was just a comfort, even after all this time, to read the story where the main character won in the end, through perseverance and bravery. He was a sucker for happy endings.
Tony’s eyes shot up to look at him. He looked agonized, terrified, but he could see Steve, right? Steve’s heart went out to him, this man who had always seemed so brilliant and untouchable, and he couldn’t hold back; he gathered up Tony’s body, and cradled him close to his chest. Mindful of Tony’s head, because his neck couldn’t seem to hold up its weight, he leaned Tony’s head against his shoulder and couldn’t help but pet him, running his fingers through his black hair. Steve tried shushing, like Tony was a scared baby, but it didn’t seem to be doing much good. Tony’s heart rate, when he checked his pulse, was way too elevated for comfort, and Tony’s eyes were darting everywhere. Steve couldn’t imagine what he was seeing, but it seemed bad, and Steve hated this. He hated feeling so helpless. He had just defeated that monster; they should have been safe now. Tony’s breath caught, and he shuddered, and Steve grit his teeth. Without really thinking about it, only spurred on by the overwhelming urge to help Tony, Steve took a deep breath.
He didn’t know where that had come from. He was supposed to be asking about Barnes’s whereabouts, not whining about how he had failed to live up to his father’s expectations yet again. Well, there was still some time before midnight. This way, he could waste some time, right?
“What,” Tony gasped. He backed up, stumbled, and nearly fell into the river anyway. “What the, I, huh—”
Sounds crashed over Tony all at once. He was drowning, thrown from a ship in the middle of a storm. He looked around for any friendly face, but couldn’t find a single one. He was completely alone. He always knew that.
Tony walked up to the bridge rail, and leaned against it. There was  a light breeze tonight, reaching out and playing with his hair. The river rolled slowly past. When he looked down, Tony could see the moon and the stars shining brightly in the reflection of the water. It made him smile, and he got up on the rail with a lighter heart, devoid of the heavy weight that shackled him most days. No one would miss him, he knew. Just one step. He wouldn’t even be falling down — he was rising into the sky.
Tony didn’t know if his small amount of knowledge would help him against a centuries-old magician, but he would have the element of surprise. Hopefully, he could make this work.
“Well, anyway. We’re going to be holding a ball in a week. All of the eligible noblewomen of the country will be attending. Just pick one, for God’s sake. Even you can’t mess that up, right?”
Stane took a step back, and made a motion towards Barnes and the swans, but they just stood motionless, staring at Tony.
The man sighed. Was this really the legendary Steve Rogers? Or was it some desperate bid by his brain to keep him from killing himself? Tony was reeling. The chest was pretty real-like, though.
Tony felt like the rug had been taken out from under him. This wasn’t at all what he had expected to go, but he had come this far. He had to try. “I’m here to stop you,” he said in as strong a voice as he could muster.
“I’m feeling a distinct lack of appreciation here,” Tony complained. He wasn’t even slurring that badly, the way he did when he first started to regain control over his own body.
For a moment, Tony didn’t say anything. He stood up slowly, closed the distance, and then reached out to touch Steve. When his fingers met resistance, he all but collapsed into his chest.
Tony had never really seen any magical practice for himself. Although he had done extensive research by himself, there were just some places he couldn’t reach because he was the crown prince. He had, however, lucked out at one point: a witch had died, and her descendant sold her book on magic. It had been like a beginner’s guide to magical theory, and Tony had devoured the book from the moment he got it. He learned so much about what magic is and what it consisted of.
“What talisman?” Stane asked, as sure of himself as ever. He held his palms up in a calming gesture. “Tony, I think you’ve been under a lot of stress recently, and maybe you need a break—”
Walking away, he tried to get himself under control. It didn’t matter what Howard thought of him. All that mattered was finding Rothbart and preventing this spell from going off. He wouldn’t let Steve down. He couldn’t. Tony looked around, but couldn’t find Barnes. He did see Stane, so he went up to him, hoping Stane might know where Barnes had went.
Soon he was through the room, and was catching up with Barnes. He went after him through the door, and saw the bottom of the man’s black jacket turning around into the next room, and Tony ran to follow him into the room. Tony came up short. Barnes was sitting there in the middle of the room, standing and not moving. Tony had thought that Barnes hadn’t noticed, but he suddenly wasn’t sure. He retreated a bit, hoping to hide behind the door, but then Barnes turned around and smiled right at him.
Steve blinked. He felt a strange combination of pleased and embarrassed, and had no idea how to respond to that. He went for the obvious.
Tony stood there for a few minutes just absorbing what just happened. His chest felt tight, his head full. He was still holding his hand cradled against his chest, like he was going to treasure the kiss pressed there. When he opened his hand, he found a single, pure white feather. Tony felt a grin come over him, and he turned around to go back where he had come. He felt like he was floating the whole way.
Naturally, Tony had tried to do a bit of magic himself, but every attempt failed. He didn’t know if it was because he had no teacher or if he just had no natural ability. He did, however, find little loopholes using machines. Instead of using such fickle things like emotions or inner strength, he used pentagrams and bots to do the work. His first real success had been Dum-E. A little bit of magic had given the bot a bit of soul, and it gave Dum-E a real personality.
have a few choice words to say to his son if he found out that Tony was collecting them on the sly. “Just a bit tired. I stayed up all night last night finishing up a project for college, and it’s just been one gala after another this week.” It had been especially boring at the galas, because Sunset wasn’t there to keep him company. Maybe she was just busy recently, but he hadn’t seen her ever since he had shown her the royal seal. She hadn’t been returning his calls or texts. She was probably just busy, though. Dum-E beeped again. “Yeah, it’s a lot, but I can handle it. Dad is counting on me to attend when he can’t, you know? Now come on, I think you’re due for a diagnostic, don’t you think?”
Finding ridicule instead of a fight is always a harsh change. Tony tried to rally his strength, but was finding it a bit difficult to do anything in this room with the quiet, away from the loud noises of the ballroom and mindless chatter, and most importantly, away from Steve and any hint of magic. “I know you’re Rothbart,” he tried again.
Faced with this heartfelt denial, Tony felt his doubts melt away, and was left feeling a bit guilty. “Oh. I mean… I want to believe you, Sunset, but you’ve been gone so long, you know how that looked…”
He wakes up with a gasp. He sits up ramrod straight, and can’t remember who he is. He heard a name, but whose is it? Where are the shadows, and their master? Did he escape? Is that… is that Dad? Is Dad the one who was pulling him apart?
In order to set Steve free, they both needed to be near each other. This was the hardest part of the equation, but their bond was still present, though weak. He had to work fast before Rothbart broke the bond between, but he only had one chance, so there was no room for error. He schemed, calculated, and thought, and in the end, there was nothing left to do but act.
Despite all the trouble that these villains had given them, it seemed to be straight sailing so far; they only met two guards on their way to the computer room, and those Steve took out efficiently and quietly with his shield. Guards down, Steve and Tony hurried on until they reached the room.
, Tony decided. There was nothing else for him in this world. He would drown himself in the river in the park, and just… be done. He would sink to the bottom, and lie there in the river, peaceful. It sounded like an amazing way to spend eternity. He didn’t want to be buried in the Royal Burial Ground, where he would have a statue made in his likeness. He would just sink, and let time and nature do its thing, and he would be safe from the touches of mankind. And they from him, he supposed.
Tony’s heart sank with the possibilities. He swallowed, and ran his hand subconsciously up and down DUM-E’s support strut. “Um. No. What’s happened?”
Tony barely heard him. He tried to intervene in the fight, but one of the swans grabbed hold of him and kept him from moving in a vice-like grip. Tony struggled and swore, but all he could do was watched.
There was no razor in the bathroom, and medication was given to him pill by pill under supervision. The windows were barred with beautiful wrought iron, and his room was locked. He had stopped eating two days ago, and was force fed broth. They threatened to hook him up to an IV. He didn’t care anymore.
Barnes appeared at his side suddenly. Tony jumped, but wasn’t able to stop Barnes from grabbing his wrists and pointing the gun at the ceiling. They struggled. Barnes was looking far too calm for the situation, and if Tony looked closer, he might have noticed that his eyes were dead and glazed over, but he had more important things to focus on.
Tony’s blood ran cold, though he couldn’t figure out why. Tony kept asking himself, was Barnes going to do the spell now? Would he do it earlier than Steve had said? What was going on? He didn’t know, but he decided to just keep doing what he was doing and wait it out. Barnes couldn’t use a spell in the middle of a room, he was sure. He would have to slip away at some point to enact any sort of spell, so Tony would have to keep a lookout. Tony reached into his pocket and felt the feather. Steve needed him. He wouldn’t let Steve down.
“I used a lock of your hair in a spell. I didn’t know it was yours. I thought it was Rothbart’s. Instead of setting me free, it gave some of the ownership to you.” Steve reached out and held Tony’s hands in his own, and Tony felt the touch travel up his nerve endings, all the way down his spine. “We’re linked now, you and I.”
Thor laughed, clapped Tony on the shoulder, then left the room with Jan and the nurse. Steve pushed himself away from the wall so he could follow, but Tony’s voice stopped him.
It was the night of the full moon when he was first woken up by this. He can’t remember the contents of the dream well enough to make any kind of guess as to what’s going on.
All he had wanted to do for Steve was just to save him from the spell, but he hadn’t even been able to do that. The one thing he had decided on to save his own life, and he wasn’t able to do it. Now, he was just wandering listlessly throughout the day, going through the motions, waiting for death.
Steve relaxed, and he grinned down at Tony. “Help’s here, Tony,” he said softly. He caught his thumb rubbing Tony’s arm. “We can get you looked at now.”
Tony sidled up to where Stane was taking snacks from the buffet table. “I know who you are,” Tony told Stane.
Tony was stunned. Obie had always been kinder than Howard, always the one who stood in between Tony and his father’s worse tempers. He had thought that Obie would be on his side for this, but it seemed that Tony’s fuck ups had reached a level that even Obie couldn’t forgive.
The night wore on, but Tony felt his patience fraying. He danced the next dance and then removed himself from the next one, so he could keep a better lookout. Barnes never acknowledged him after that first look. He didn’t even seem to remember that Tony was even there. Instead, he prowled around the room, flirting with every girl he laid his eyes on. He didn’t seem to care what other people thought of him, seeing the way he laid on the flirtations. Tony could hear people whisper and not-so-whisper about him, saying he was crude and over the top and not decent, but no one tried to stop him regardless. Tony watched as Barnes ran his hand up a girl’s thigh, slowly, all while the two smiled at each other with predatory smiles, and felt a thrill of … something. Tony didn’t know what he was feeling, but he was feeling something. Fear, surely.
Tony went through his routine: cufflinks, tie, waistcoat. He was hardly paying attention, just taking clothes off in his usual fashion. He’d done it so many times, he didn’t even have to think about it. He was trying not to think about it, but his mind was going ahead and connecting dots and solving equations: the unanswered calls, the cancelled dates, the way Sunset had been becoming less and less attentive … until that last date.
Getting paralyzed in the middle of an enemy’s hideout wasn’t good. Steve checked his comms, but all he got was static. Fucking magic. Great, so now they were stuck in this room with a mutated corpse, no communication with the outside world, and Tony couldn’t move.
Time wore on. Some girls came over to Tony to talk or flirt or ask out to dance, but Tony was getting anxious. He didn’t know what was going to happen next, but he just wanted it to happen now. At one point, he saw from afar his father talking to Barnes, and freaked out. Trying not to draw too much attention to himself, Tony made his way across the ballroom to prevent whatever mischief Barnes was causing. He was delayed by the dancers and the press of people, however, and found that by the time he reached his father, Barnes had already left.
There was a swan on the banks of the river. Feathers white as snow, neck long and gracefully curved, tapering into a black face and long beak. Its wings were huge, and they were completely opened. With a powerful thrust of its wings, the swan launched itself into the air. Tony watched, transfixed, as the swan soared through the air to land right next to him.
Tony set to work. He connected a plug from his suit to the computer, and started the download process. He looked through the data while they waited with his visor flipped up.
Tony cried out and reached for the raccoon, but it had already leaped away from him. Steve lunged for it, but it scurried away. He was ready, though. Using instinct and calculations that ran as fast as any computer, he timed his lunge perfectly, so he landed near his abandoned shield, picked it up, and threw it much further than he had calculated last time. It slammed directly in front of the monster, which flinched, drawing up. Steve was already jumping, spinning, and landing with the full force of his body behind his kick to its back. (Why hadn’t Tony gotten up yet?) He kicked its face, side-stepped out of the way of its stinger, which allowed him to grab his rebounding shield mid-air. He let the momentum of the flying shield carry, so he spun it around onto the monster’s face.
Crass jokes aside, Peggy had always known him. And so when he’d set his eyes on Tony, the woman had just rolled her eyes and told him ‘typical’.
Too late. With a metallic groan, the robot snapped the wing clean off and then threw the rest of the jet sideways wildly, and Steve felt the nauseating lurch as he was tossed around like a leaf in the wind. He couldn’t see anything for a few moments, but then there was a tremendous crashing and his whole body snapped sideways, only kept from smashing against the walls by the safety belts he’d wrapped around himself beforehand. Steve cursed violently, pain erupting across his forehead as something sliced through it- rubble or debris from the ship, probably. He couldn’t see or hear a thing as the jet tumbled, dragged across the concrete of the street by the momentum, and just held on tight while everything fell apart around him. He thought he could hear Tony’s voice through the speakers, frantic, terrified, but he wasn’t sure whether that was just in his head or not. All of it was blurred into one.
Tony said nothing, and his eyes never wavered from Steve’s own. His hands were still on Steve’s arms. “God, this is so fucking surreal,” the man muttered under his breath, “haven’t seen you in a year, and then suddenly you’re in my damn house being all—all
There was another short pause- one that sounded almost hesitant, if disembodied voices were capable of that. “Please be careful around Howard Stark. You’re probably not aware of quite how much influence that man has. There is not a lot he is unable to get away with, and Sir has often faced the full effects of that. He is putting an awful lot of trust into you, simply letting you in here. I implore you not to let him down.”
To be fair, it meant a lot that Tony was talking to him at all. Steve still couldn’t really believe that had happened.
And then, on the outskirts of it all, was Tony. The stuck up billionaire asshole, the one everyone tended to roll their eyes at. He was too loud, too selfish. They put up with him most days because they had to. Steve… well, maybe Steve liked him a little more than the rest, but at the end of the day he had Bucky. He had Sam. He had the rest of the team, and there wasn’t much room after all that for Tony.
“Tony, when I started this, I was still… trying to find a link back home,” he said quietly, watching as Tony swivelled on his chair and then pushed it forward, rolling along the tiles until his legs hit Steve’s with a gentle bump and he was looking down at Steve with his elbows braced on his knees, an intense expression covering his face. He was so very beautiful. “All I wanted was a friend. Someone that I could, I dunno, share all my pain with. Someone who understood. So when I was fighting Loki, and he told me that Bucky was alive, I—I latched on. I wanted to believe it because I couldn’t handle the reality. I couldn’t handle the fact that I really was alone here.”
Tony had woken up before Steve himself had, and Clint made sure to assure him that there wasn’t going to be any lasting damage, it was lucky, but Steve hadn’t caused any permanent facial injuries and his broken femur would heal with time. Clint didn’t mention any of the other bruises that littered Tony’s skin, some yellow with age, some fresh and purple. Steve knew they were there. His hands had been what had put them there.
He put the tray on Bucky’s chest and then stole the bag of cookies from it before his best friend could wrap his greedy hands from it. Bucky just whined and shot him the middle finger, which Steve maturely decided to ignore. He made himself comfortable next to Tony, and then grabbed the blanket from the side of the couch, wrapping them both up in it and pulling Tony sideways into his chest.
God, the look on Clint’s face when Tony had frozen in that doorway and then stumbled straight back out of the room. Everyone except Bruce had seen that, because everyone had been taking a coffee break and so they’d all been in the kitchen. The archer’s eyes had been wide, horrified. He must have been completely thrown off by Tony’s reaction. Tony didn’t blame him, either. It was ridiculous, to go so overboard at a stupid prank.
He grinned to himself as he opened up another email from Pepper, this one involving the agenda for tomorrow. A busy schedule, full of meetings and PR and an event opening down at MIT. The smile slipped. Goddamn it- he was going to need so much coffee to keep himself from blacking out tomorrow. So, so much.
Clint nodded, but when Steve made to stand, he pressed his hand against Steve’s chest and held him in place. Steve, already immeasurably weakened by the shock, couldn’t even fight it. “Nope,” he declared, “you stay right there. We’ve got evac coming in for you.”
“Steve,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes, hands entwining with Steve’s once more, “I really don’t think it’s good practice to let your boyfriend starve on the first date. Plus the staff at IHOP love me and so the pancakes will probably be even bigger than u-“
“Yeah yeah,” he waved a hand and wandered further forward, meeting Tony by the huge door, “after you then.”
“It was a clean shot,” Natasha declared, her voice more hard and even and lifeless than it had ever been before, and if Steve had cared, he would have known that was because she was falling apart at the seams. “There was no pain, Steve. None at all. The last thing he saw and thought of was you.”
Rhodey’s face, however, told Tony that persuading them to leave was going to be difficult. “Nat, I think he’s getting delirious,” he said to the woman next to him, shooting her a look before turning his gaze back to Tony. “You’re delirious.”
Tony feels the ever-constant desire suddenly light into an inferno at that point. Steve’s mouth looks so delicious and soft, and his eyes look even bluer than Tony had ever though they could and he just wants to… he wants to do
Someone sidled up to him and laughed, and Steve turned to them, smiling awkwardly. They stuck out their hand. “I’m Joyce,” she shouted, words sounding just a little more than slurred, “you’re cute. Let’s dance.”
“So, my question is- what are you doing down here, Steve Rogers?” And the voice was at a weird angle; below him, despite the fact he was the one sat on the chair, and he opened his eyes despite himself and then jumped when he saw Tony, sat cross-legged on the floor next to his feet.
He took the bus back and spent the rest of the night with Sam and Clint, watching movies and trying to cram in all the homework they had due. He was despairing over the math, dubious about the history and downright angered by the ridiculousness of the science, but… still happy, overall. It felt kinda weird- usually when things went wrong, that was just the beginning of his next spiral, and yet now he was looking at
With a short sigh, he bit the bullet and then dialled Tony’s number. It couldn’t hurt to ask, and if he was busy, then Sam would get home in an hour or two anyway. Steve could handle himself just fine, thank you very much.
Tony froze, glaring at Natasha from across the room. Peter was eyeing him curiously, still banging at the table. Tony looked at him, unimpressed. “Of all the toys I bought you,” he started, “and you decide to take fancy to the thing that could kill you? Of course you do. It’s not like those thirty-goddamn-dollar rattles are interesting, is it-“
Steve looked at him, and Tony looked right back. Locked in a staring match that was intense enough to have been a physical embrace, he allowed himself to just stare. Again- social etiquette really didn’t mean much anymore, so who the hell cared?
Steve didn’t even consider it. “Not happening, sweetheart,” he said, bringing Tony’s hand close to his lips and then pressing a soft kiss to the knuckles, “I’ve texted all of them. They know where I am, and I’ll ring them in the morning.”
Tony had a brief second to wonder why he was being made to smile his horribly wonky and odd smile- but steve wanted it.
Tony kissed him quiet again, shooting him a warm smile and unashamedly letting his eyes wander down Steve’s body in wonder. “I’m fine. I’m safe. And it looks like you had fun without me, anyway,” he raises his eyebrows and looks pointedly around the bombshell of a room.
Peter paused, opening his mouth to say something, before shutting it again with a clack and scowling. “I guess not. Whatever.”
Steve looked up, watched everyone nod and then straighten up, the prospect of a new mission close on the horizon. His heart was going a mile a minute under his ribcage, and he wondered whether or not this was all a dream. He’d spent weeks now just waiting for Tony to come home, to show himself, and now that it was all actually here, he felt like it couldn’t be true.
“Right, no, sorry, of course you- never mind, okay, uh- right. This was stupid. Just… can you not hang up for like, a few minutes, maybe? I’m just… I just need to look like I’m talking to someone,” He said hurriedly, looking over his shoulder at the two guys walking 10 yards behind him, their hoods up and hiding their faces. The clouds were beginning to turn the streets darker.
Steve blushed. “I… I’ve got wait for the bus either way, so i figured- I figured I might as well put my time to good use,” he mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck.
Steve glanced over at the machine, a frown creasing his face. He had no idea what it was- just looked like a pimped-up box to him, but he figured if it had the potential to go bang, it wasn’t as superficial as what Steve was seeing. He did note, after a second, that it seemed one of Tony’s fingers were pressed firmly into one side of the machine, and he hadn’t moved it since Steve had walked in. “I’m gonna go ahead and assume if you lift your hand, bad things will happen.”
“And you?” Tony asked, looking back at him as he began making his way up the huge stairs at the end of the corridor.
“Sure,” Steve shrugged indifferently, poking at his own bowl of granola, “Carol seems nice. And I’m sure her guy is too.”
Unfortunately, Steve is pretty adamant that he’s going to be a gentleman or whatever, because he takes a deep breath and steels himself before pushing Tony off again, not letting go of him exactly, but enough to mean Tony can no longer reach Steve’s mouth.
Thor didn’t say anything to that; just smiled and then looked out of the window again for a little while longer. Darkness had fallen fully by that point, and New York was lit up by the Christmas lights and buzzing shops that seemed to never shut. Steve watched them too, letting it all pass him by in a blur until Thor spoke again a few minutes later.
“Papa,” Maria cut into their conversation loudly, sitting up from the boat and making it rock with the suddenness of it, apparently now bored by the fishes, “do we have any ice pops left?”
Tony nodded. “It was going good. I was… okay, I did what every kid my age would’ve done in that situation and I participated in a bit of stupid stuff, but at that point I wasn’t-“ Steve heard as his voice wavered suddenly, and underneath his fingers, he could feel Tony’s heartbeat stutter.
Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist, and Tony shivered violently, sinking into it. “I’m sorry,” he said again, gripping Steve’s shoulders with unsteady fingers, “you saw it, right? Jesus, this is a mess. I know this sucks. I’m sorry—”
“I think you’ll find it goddamn is,” Steve retorted, his own voice sharpening, but staying low and quiet, “Tony, I think my nose is broken. I need to get it reset-“
That was what Steve had heard, anyway. From the agents who’d dragged his beaten body off the streets and into the holding cell. Steve hadn’t seen it for himself. Far too cowardly for that.
There was a murmuring of agreement around the room as everyone acknowledged the sound nature of the idea. Tony himself still didn’t entirely like the idea, although he wasn’t too sure why. Maybe just something about displacing the kid over and over sat wrong with him. Like Clint had said on the first day, babies needed stability, love. They needed stupid cuddles and someone to hold them, because they were at an age were affection was a necessity, not an option. Throwing him from place to place in an attempt to find a fit just felt wrong.
When he arrived in the small little café a few minutes later, he knew that it was probably pretty obvious he’d been crying. His pale complexion never really helped hide it, and his eyes had a tendency of puffing up at the first sign of tears. But Thor didn’t mention it- just smiled over to him and then pushed a plate over the table. The burger was greasy and not particularly great, but it helped warm him up a little, and afterward Thor and Steve both went into the bathroom and tried to dry their hair off with the hand dryers, which was pretty hilarious. There was something sort of endearing about watching the six-foot giant try and bend down at an angle that would make his hair dry smoothly.
but Tony didn’t flinch, because Tony knew that voice better than anything; that voice was safe. That voice was home.
He’d be okay. He told the team as much as they set off on the Quinjet to go and join the fight, and everyone looked at him like he was crazy but he didn’t fucking care. He knew Tony. It had been two years, but dammit, Steve still fucking knew him. And in knowing him, Steve knew also of his resilience. Of his determination and bravery and goddamn refusal to lay down and die. And if Steve didn’t hold onto that hope inside him, then he wouldn’t have a chance in hell of fighting well enough to win.
He blinked, feeling a lump in his throat. “You… you did this for me,” he said so quietly he wondered if Tony even heard.
Tony was fucking stupid. He’d told himself he wouldn’t mess this one up, and look at him. Already failed, and through nothing but his own stupid behaviour. He absolutely did not blame Steve for this. Considering the fact that he got enough shit from every other Baseliner in the world, he had no reason to put up with it from Tony. God- he’d essentially told Steve to just lie down and take the mocking for the day so that Tony could have his fun. What kind of boyfriend—
Tony wanted to end it with an I love you, but he figured he didn’t really have that right. They hadn’t said it before now, and it was unlikely Tony would be able to in the future, so it most certainly wasn’t his place to do that now.
Steve huffed, forehead falling back into Tony’s chest. “Obviously,” he muttered, “the bedhead look is in right now.”
“Steve,” someone—Bruce, Bruce, that was who—said calmly, firmly, “breathe. Take in your surroundings. Do you know where you are?”
He knew that this was their job. He knew damn well that this was just a part of their lives that he had to cope with, because there was no way Steve would stop any time soon, and if he was being honest, no way that Tony would either. That didn’t make any of it any less agonising. Seeing Steve hurting, watching him choke up blood or wrap up a wound was never going to be easy. Tony wished there was a way for them to do what they did without getting hurt, and he tried his damndest to keep the injuries to a minimum with suit upgrades and in-built defences. It wasn’t ever going to be foolproof, though. And that was just something he had to live with.
and you just… accepted that?” Rumlow’s hands waved through the air again, like he was lost for words. “I… I just
But rather than frowning and pulling him up on it, Steve just blushes a little bit deeper, and Tony watches his eyes flicker down very briefly, before dragging themselves back up immediately and only making the blush go even darker, and at this rate Steve is going to be a motherfucking tomato, or his cheeks are going to burst open from too much blood rushing around in them.
He managed to finally get the hospital to cave and let him out after eight days of being signed in. The team argued and tried to make him stay longer, but Tony wasn’t having any of it. He was sick of just lying there, thinking of everything he hadn’t done. Thinking of the fact that the whole team, himself included, was aware that if he’d just spoken up sooner and not been such a pathetic idiot, this could all have been avoided. In hindsight, he realised he should have flagged it the moment that Steve started to get rough. He could have told Bruce when the man had seen his cheek, and they could have sorted it out. Come to a conclusion. But… but he’d been too scared of what they’d say, too afraid they wouldn’t believe him. He’d let both himself and Steve suffer because of his own cowardice, and
Tony looked like someone had just run over a puppy in front of him, and he pressed a self-conscious hand across his ribs where the bruises were worst. “Steve, you weren’t in your right mind, okay, it wasn’t your fault-”
With a sigh, he opened his eyes again and tried to take in a full breath, feeling the cold slip in through to his bones as he sat up and edged out of Steve’s hold. His body ached from exhaustion that sat deep inside him, but he was used to it, and he pushed it away while he shuffled over to the bathroom and splashed cold water across his face, checking the weather report as he did so. He had an appointment scheduled with marketing for 10:15, supposedly only taking twenty minutes for reshoots, but Tony knew it was bullshit. Those guys loved to get as much footage of his face as they could wrangle from him, so it’d probably be more like an hour. That was going to cut into his time at the office, so he probably wouldn’t even make much of a dent in all the paperwork he had left over from last night. Pepper was gonna be pissed.
Tony laughed, shutting his eyes and then resting his head into the hollow of Steve’s neck. “No shit.” He breathed out and kissed Steve’s bare skin. “But you’re okay now. You’re safe. We got you. I promise, you’re not… whatever they showed you, it was not real. It won’t ever be real.”
At home, it was warm. JARVIS always kept the temperatures in the tower above what was normal, but in winter they got knocked up a few more degrees and turned the penthouse floor into a veritable oven. Most of the team complained that it was far too hot. But Steve liked it. Steve said it was easier to sleep when he was warm; that the cold had always gotten into his bones and stiffened him, made him feel like a living corpse. So Tony kept it warm. And at home there was food, too. A nice warm bath. There was mistletoe hung up in strategic locations so that, according to Tony’s calculations, there was a 94% likelihood of him being able to catch Steve right underneath at least one of them at some point.
“Will you, Anthony Edward,” Steve declared, sitting up as straight as he could and then looking Tony in the eye, “do me the honour of marrying me? I would love to love you forever. We’d be the best husbands ever. I think you should say yes.”
Steve beamed as he glanced down at their joined fingers, and then found himself vehemently agreeing with this. But unfortunately, much as he may have wanted to, he couldn’t actually spend the rest of his life holding Tony’s hand.
‘I love you’ he said, and then with a heave of his chest and a groan of pain, the world blacked once more and returned, back to darkness and rubble and hurt and no, God, Tony was grappling with Thanos for the gauntlet, face twisted and determined as he attempted to wrestle it from the Titan’s hand.
“Please don’t ever think that we don’t care about the person under the suit,” Steve murmured into his hair, arms wrapping protectively around Tony’s waist, “we do. More than you could possibly know. You’re family, Tony.”
Steve was a sure thing. These past few months, they’d just been a blip. A problem they could work through, the same they did with everything else. Steve’s words made no sense at all.
. “Okay, everyone suit up,” Steve called out sharply, throwing his newspaper down- then stopped when he saw Tony beginning to move with the rest of them. “Uh, Tony- what are you doing?”
Turned out, he didn’t have to wait long. After sprinting down the corridor and snapping out various commands to JARVIS as he went, Tony stopped in the middle of the open-plan living room, checking his watch and then glancing back to Steve. A dozen different things flashed across his face for a moment, before it simply settled into a tense sort of trepidation. He straightened his back and relaxed his shoulders. “I know what you’re going to think,” Tony told him, throat bobbing nervously as he kept Steve’s gaze, “but I don’t have time to explain. I— I have to stop that thing. Just hold tight and stay put. I’ll tell you everything when I get back, I promise.”
Bursting through quickly, Steve threw himself into a roll and used the movement to check his surroundings. Two bodies were on the floor by the door, and three others in the whole which apparently had been blown in on the back-side of the cabin. Two resided on the far end of the room. Steve couldn’t see any of their faces, didn’t know which ones were dead and which were alive. If any were alive.
He sighed and looked to Steve. “Your turn to change his diaper,” he said with a poke against Steve’s ribs, “and you’re not allowed to run away this time. Man up and wipe his butt like everyone else.”
He’d just heard her saying she loved him. He’d never even got that as she’d died, he’d never got to say goodbye, but then here she was, doing it in her in her own special way anyway, fuck, fuck, he didn’t-
Someone walked into the hall at that moment, and Steve turned to look at them. Late to the late detention, he thought with a huff- that was pretty amusing. However, when his eyes locked on Zeke’s from across the room, he lost all sense of humor.
Steve nodded and shut his eyes. Tony knew he must be in pain- electric shocks always seemed to be worse in the aftermath than they were at the present moment. But despite what he must have been feeling, he didn’t let it show. “I’m sorry I scared you,” he murmured, “but it had been heading straight for you. And you wouldn’t have been able to bounce back as quickly as I can.”
Steve listened to this as if detached from himself, from the character that Tony was talking of. Because Tony was talking as if he had no idea that Steve was involved in this. Tony was talking as if he still thought Steve was just an innocent bystander. And if he was talking like that, then it meant no one at SHIELD had let on that Steve had been the one to give him up yet. Which also meant that Rumlow was undoubtedly going to do that, right now. And Steve was going to bear witness to it.
Heads perked up at the prospect of gifts, all their grins widening. “Oooooooh, gimme gimme gimme,” Clint said as he hopped off the counter and scurried over to him, hands outstretched. “Are they fresh arrows I see?”
“Ugh, no, depressing,” he waved the idea off, before clicking his fingers, “hey, you know, it’s been a while since I pulled out the piano. You wanna watch me put Beethoven to shame for a little while?” Tony’s eyebrows wiggled and he leaned in closer, “I know you love it.”
They set off shortly after that, with Steve stopping off along the way to buy them the appropriate roadtrip snacks and then piling them all onto Tony’s lap for easy access. Tony napped for most of the morning ride, but eventually the sound of Steve’s continuous crunching of chips stirred him and he shucked the blankets he’d previously been nestled in. Steve shot him a wry glance. “You could’ve at least put on some pants.”
“I SAID SHUT UP!” Steve was yelling at him, standing over his body as he curled in defensively on the floor- for the first time completely and utterly aware of exactly what Steve could do to him if he got angry enough. “THAT MEANS
He looked at Tony through his blurry vision. The man’s face was pale and sickly, interspersed with blues and greens and browns from various bruises, and his lip was uneven, swollen from the split that cracked down across the right hand side of his mouth. He looked heaven-sent to Steve, though.
It wasn’t important. Just some people he had to hang out with for six hours a day and then forget about as soon as he was gone. He ignored the laughing from the boys behind him.
He shut his eyes and buried his head into the crook of Tony’s neck, just needing to feel him there. Deft fingers wrapped around Tony’s wrist, felt his heart. Slow, steady, real. Tony had died. Steve had followed shortly after. But they were both alive in the here and now. Whatever that had been, whatever alternate reality Steve had just seen… it was gone. It was over. It never had been at all.
a thing then it meant he’d have to explain to Steve that he suffered mild withdrawal symptoms every time they weren’t together, which would be a little embarrassing.
, when he’s in the middle of creating something amazing in the workshop. Paint smears across Steve’s cheekbone, like smudges of rainbow illuminating his face, and the white shirt he’s wearing has suffered much the same fate. Tony can no longer see a single dash of pale skin on Steve’s hands; instead covered in reds and oranges and golds that are catching on the sunlight filling the room.
“No, wait, I didn’t mean it like that,” he said quickly, grabbing Tony’s forearm desperately, “I was just… God, I just need to leave for a week. Okay?”
Tony wanted to scream at him. He also wanted to reach for him and hold on to Steve like he was the last person on fucking Earth. He had no idea which one to pick, so he chose neither and remained safely attached to the toilet, because he was fucking pathetic. Weak. He didn’t deserve to be an Avenger- how was he supposed to defeat supervillains when he became completely incapacitated by a splash of fucking water?
Breathing heavily, Steve eventually stopped struggling against Tony and fell back, letting Tony move him behind his body so that he stood between Zeke and Steve. His hand remained curled into the material of Steve’s shirt, over his chest.
The reflection shuddered, just a little, and he frowned and attempted to steady it, thinking that Thor had just gotten overexcited again. But the shuddering got more extreme, and Steve realised the whole room was beginning to shake. His next thought was that it might be an Earthquake—but then something else popped into his head, and his eyes widened, heart suddenly going completely still in his chest as a billion different emotions roar up to meet him.
“It’s actually someone else,” he admitted in the end, biting his lip a little, “someone… uh- well, I’m actually, uh, dating someone. Sort of. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I’m definitely… I’m doing that. So. It’s him. I’m drawing… mostly just him.”
really?” Steve countered sulkily, keeping his arms around Tony’s waist as they swayed at the edge of the sidewalk, undoubtedly pissing off a dozen different commuters as they hurried on by. Steve couldn’t care less. “Japan will move on without you.”
creepy considering they’d never actually shared anything more than a smile through a window, but damn- Steve had never seen anyone move like that before in his life. Never had he laid eyes on anyone who could flow around a room like he was made of liquid; every position perfect and wonderful and
“So that’s where we go.” Steve smiled his battle-smile, bracing as they landed right on the steps of the facility, Tony shielding Steve from the gunfire on the street as it immediately rained upon them. Steve pulled up his shield and nodded. “Let’s go kick some ass.”
“Tony,” he whispered, like saying his lover's name would bring him back. He sank to the floor, still holding to the piece of sink that he’d ripped off the wall. “Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony…”
. He was ‘it’, he was Test Subject 02. Peter loved bubbles and Peppa Pig and dumb kiddie shit like people blowing raspberries on his belly when they were changing his diaper, and a few months ago, he’d been nothing more than a weapon. A product to be tested.
I do Peter,” Pops said, sounding a little pained, “I hate the fact you, or anyone else thinks otherwise. We… we’re not ever going to be perfect, Pete. It’s unfortunately just a part of who we are, and our relationship. We’re gonna fight, and we’re gonna get mad and we’re gonna act like idiots. But at the end of the day, we’ll always come back to one another. He’s… I don’t know, he’s just always gonna be the one I turn to in a crowd full of the world’s most beautiful, powerful, wonderful people and think,
When Tony is sat, wasted and sleep-deprived in his workshop with a bottle of pills staring temptingly up at him- that’s one of those times.
Bucky huffed, and Tony watched his body relax a little as he stepped forward. “Tasha told me you got mind-mushed,” he continued, waving Steve away when the man shot him a glare, “Oh give it up, Stevie, he knows what’s happenin.”
Steve just nodded, a promise. He looked across at Tony and then shut his eyes as a small smile flicked across his mouth. “He’s got a crazy maniacal laugh, you know. Have you heard it? When something is just so funny he can’t control it, his laugh sounds like a super villain. I feel I should be hearing it from Doctor Doom.”
subject matter, you can unmute yourself, JARVIS,” he added, leaning back and directing the last part over to his desk.
“Tony-“ Steve began, frowning. He got that he might have a strict dad, but surely the man would understand?
Steve frowned even harder. “Tony?”  He was about to continue and ask what the fuck the guy was talking about, but felt a sharp prod from Nat’s elbow and subtle shake of the head, so he wisely changed his track. “I… yeah. Sure.”
Tony stares up at him, looking at the scruffy blond hair and slightly parted lips as he breathes softly and evenly, still curled around Tony protectively, even in his sleep.
He broke away, hands leaving Steve’s face in order to flex angrily in his lap. He looked back out to the window, face tight. “I
“Fuck you both!” Steve called angrily, rubbing his fingers over his eyelids and telling himself that now was very much not the appropriate time for popcorn. Now was the time for work. And math. Yes.
stay back, let the people who weren’t susceptible to machine failure go in and handle it but you never fucking listen to me-“
He lifted their joined hands and gently, so gently, pressed the lightest of kisses against Tony’s knuckles. Tony stilled, mouth shutting as he looked at where his skin met Steve’s lips. Then his chest shuddered and his face crumpled, and he shook his head softly as he looked back into Steve’s eyes. “I missed you so much, you fucking prick, I missed you so so much—”
Tony came back better, more relaxed. Steve could admit, he did too. It had just been nice to escape it all for a little while, just be with each other, no distractions. Steve’d forgotten how it felt to be normal, and not deal with alien peace conferences or interdimensional space-hopping or whatever else had the potential to pop up in their ever-confusing lives. And Tony had seemed so happy there, so much more relaxed. Steve had had a hard time keeping his hands off him for longer than a few minutes at a time, if he was being honest. Call him cheesy, but there was just something so goddamn beautiful about seeing Tony smile.
“How does it feel,” Tony had asked when it was finally finished, lifting it up and touching it against Steve’s cheek. It was incredible, how… how real, it looked. If not for all the missing scars and marks that Steve had long since memorised on Tony’s old hand, Steve wasn’t sure whether he’d even have known it was a prosthetic at all. Hell, even the hairs were the same.
Steve gave him a soft kick in the side, and then suddenly felt the air rushing over his face as Tony’s hand curled around his ankle and tugged him down too. He made an embarrassingly high squeaking noise, which quickly turned to a hiss of pain as his ribs flared up painfully-
“Give Steve over there a scan. Check for brain trauma, breaks, that sort of thing,” Tony waved a hand in Steve’s general direction and then dove back into his cupboard. Steve watched as various things were thrown over his shoulder and sent crashing carelessly.
Tony was, in fact, stepping back up onto the windowsill, shuffling back under the window and then grabbing onto the ledge with firm fingers. “I’m leaving?” He said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world, but grinned cheekily when Steve shot him an incredulous look.
Tony huffed in frustration, but the small movement of sitting up had already made him nauseous and the pain was slowly starting to edge in. He felt weak, cold and yet hot all at once, and he couldn’t move without shaking. He truly didn’t have much choice but to just lie there and be useless while his friends worked around him.
Tony had nodded once, curt. He’d been trying, ever since being pulled out of that hellhole, to remember what his suit even looked like. But he couldn’t. Not unless it was shown to him in a picture, in which case it just gave him an immediate migraine and then slipped straight out of his memory as soon as his eyes had left it. If Tony hadn’t been so distraught about that, he would have commended the scientists responsible. He’d never heard of something like that being done before.
“Oh, but here’s an extra fact,” she said as he felt the drug release into his system, “those little computers over there? They can decide what it is you see. I’m sure you’d love to know what it is we have lined up for you, Captain Rogers! It’s going to be so much fun!” There were two delighted claps, and it sent his head spinning with the harsh noise. He winced, but then looked back up at her, defiant. He would always be defiant. They couldn’t break h-
Except it didn’t. Thud, that was. In fact, he never felt the floor at all. Instead, he found himself buffeted by something hard and yet soft. Unyielding yet gentle. humming in surprise, he valiantly attempted to pull his eyes back open and see what it was that was holding him.
Steve ducked into an alleyway to avoid the army guys and SHIELD vans currently swarming into the area now that the robot was down. “Where are you?” He whispered worriedly, “are you okay? I didn’t see you take the thing down.”
Eventually, when Steve downright refused to accept the latest suit Tony had made him and then finished by yelling at Tony to stop being such a goddamn idiot, Tony had had enough. They were getting sick of him even when he was doing his best to give them what he wanted, and it was only a matter of time before they sat him down and told him that they needed him gone. He just knew it. Maybe some would call it a product of his sleep-deprived self hatred, but he didn’t fucking care. The Avengers were all he had, and whether they hated him or not,
“Life’s kicked you down, buddy,” Rhodey looked at them all, then glanced at the door where the intercom was just beginning to buzz with the arrival of what had to be the rest of their friends. “Luckily though, you’ve got about nine different people who are gonna do everything they can to help you back up. You’re not gonna be alone through this. Not ever.”
Steve chuckled wetly. He must look a fucking mess right about now. “No. I don’t want to use drugs to solve my problems.”
. Because he was too strong, because he hadn’t even been able to hold it together enough to keep Tony safe-
And more than anything, Steve wanted to make it worth it. To help him, whatever way he could. Steve just wasn’t sure how- although when it came down to it, he knew that all he’d really need to do was make sure to get in the way whenever Howard Stark got pissed off, and it’d do the job pretty nicely. If it meant he didn’t have to glance at bruises or cuts and wonder where they came from, he’d do it. In a heartbeat.
“-well about that,” Tony said somewhat sheepishly, and Steve felt his heart start to drop in disappointment, “actually, I’m just driving back from a quick stop off in Brooklyn to get some parts for one of my engines, and so I thought I’d take a detour and- well, I was just about to ask if you wanted me to come over for a little bit, actually. Seeing as I’m like, three minutes away right now.”
. You are…you are the last thing that I would ever feel any sort of embarrassment or shame toward. You’re the damn smartest decision I’ve ever made. Why the fuck would I ever regret that, or want to hide it? That’s the fucking thing-“
Steve smiled and shook his head. Tony just raised an eyebrow. He was very good at not showing more than just little traces of his emotions.
Tony couldn’t really see the figure. His head was hurting so, so much. But it was blonde and there were blue eyes and his touch felt like home, and he just wanted the person that all of that belonged to to tell him everything was going to be okay. Steve always made things better. It was part of the reason Tony loved him so damn much.
something at the back of his throat stopped the words from coming out. It felt a little bit like fear, but that wasn’t something he wanted to think about at all, so he shoved it down and just focused on trying to be more gentle with the way he spoke after that. After all, Tony had been the one who’d fucked this all up. Steve had been the one who’d suffered because of it.
“-And she was the only person back then who seemed to ask me about how my day was and really mean it,” he continued, eyelashes fluttering as he blinked. Tony hummed to show he was still actively listening, and Steve continued. “Anyway. After the Battle of New York, I didn’t see her again. Her stand was right underneath the tower, pretty much. I’m not… I don’t know whether she was among the dead. I didn’t see her name on the list, but…”
“They’re going to ask you about it,” Tony said throatily, “they’re gonna… say shit. About you. For being with me. I’m sorry. It’s all corporate BS, they try to start smear campaigns and make the stocks drop, it’s business, but usually they don’t find any new material and—you know, it’s just—”
“Um, excuse me?” Bruce said, just as Steve opened his mouth to object. “how come Steve gets away without diaper duty and not me?”
Tony squeezed their hands together. “Oh, I know. I’ve just wanted to hold hands with you since I was twelve.”
Steve, of course, said nothing. Tony straightened back up after another second, and then looked up at the ceiling. He didn’t really fancy going through that bloody stairwell again. If they were gonna get out of there, they might as well do it fast. “JARVIS, there are no Avengers that have arrived in the building yet, are there?”
Mrs. Wilson sighed again, remaining quiet as her fingers tapped over the wheel. He kept his eyes down at his shoes, feeling the muscles in his shoulders as they bunched together.
But he never found what he always was. A second later and he was out, the blood-loss knocking him into peaceful oblivion. The last thing on his mind was Tony’s face; creased with concern and determination, and something that looked dangerously close to love.
“You okay?” Steve asked, voice not even anything above a breath as his finger trailed up and down Tony’s ribs.
He gasped in pain and tried, tried so hard. But his head was spinning too hard for him to even know which way was up, and all he could see from where he was looking was the dusty view of a red and gold armour, lying in the same spot twenty feet away from him. He wondered whether Tony was looking back at him, thinking the same things that he was.
“It’s HYDRA you should be hating, bud,” Rhodey came to stand by him and rested his hand gently upon Tony’s shoulder, “they threw the bomb at you.”
But yeah. That made- what- seven? Seven new people. A month in and he only knew seven new people, what the fuck was that? It was disgraceful. He could never tell Bucky or Peggy that- they’d never stop laughing.
It was proof that this was real. This was where he was. A broken mess of a man sobbing on the floor as the love of his life held him through it all. This was real. It was embarrassing and humiliating, but it wasn’t…
“Steve? Oh, for fuck’s… Steve, you idiot, sit back down. Your bicep’s all torn up, okay, just lie down, lie… there we go.” He blinked in surprise as suddenly a face loomed above him, one warm hand pressing against his chest. Tony’s face was pinched in worry, the bruises around his face having changed a few shades since Steve last looked at him. He wondered how long he’d been out for.
Natasha smiled, patting him on the head and then pulling out yet another candy bar from the inside of her jacket pocket, whilst Steve just stared in incredulity. How many of those goddamn things had she stolen?
Steve kept looking at him. His mind felt fuzzy and it hurt like a motherfucker from where he’d been hit-
“Because my boyfriend is in a place so shitty that we can’t even sext, you goddamn heartless bitch!” Natasha’s muffled voice called out from inside the fort.
“No no, it’s fine,” Tony told him reassuringly, looking down and pulling his face into his best rendition of a smile, “but don’t worry. I’ll get Iron Man back to me soon and then it won’t even be an issue. Promise.”
“He said something,” Steve blurted, loud enough to make Tony jump a little. It had been mere hours since their whole city had been on fire, and Steve could still see the tension in the other man’s eyes. “He said something to me, that threw me completely off. Surprised me. It was how he escaped and—and I
"What?" Steve said from the bed, shuffling around to look over at them. Tony held up the sticky note and raised an eyebrow.
He looked left, and his heart sped up a few paces as he spotted Steve, also fast asleep, his head tilted back against the cushions as one arm laid gently against Peter’s back. The boy was splayed out like a starfish across Steve’s vast chest, eyes shut and dreaming peacefully.
“Anyway,” Tony said after a few moments of silence, “apologies on behalf of my terrible friends aside, I did actually call for a reason.”
Tony twisted around, looking at him in embarrassment. “Please forget they ever did that and ignore whatever they said, it is lies and they’re both getting their asses beat the next time I see them.”
Tony cracked a smile, the look on his face turning almost fond. “You’re very hard on yourself, you know.”
He grabbed an apple from the fruit bowl and chewed on it as he walked away, watching Peter while Peter watched him, hands still reaching out, trying to grab. It was only because Tony was the one who'd actually held him since he'd arrived here, though. Babies probably just... imprinted, or something, What the hell did Tony know?
Tony just rolled his eyes, scooping up a handful of bubbles and then pushing it into Steve’s face, much to the man’s surprise. “It’s bathtime,” he informed him, “it would be tremendously hard for you to be ‘bad’ at it.”
Tony just shook his head. “You didn’t need to start a fight with him, Steve,” he said quietly, “I assume you just got suspended, otherwise you wouldn’t be here right now. That’s gonna be on your school record forever, now. Colleges are gonna see that.”
dead, maybe Steve’s dreams were just flashbacks, he could hardly even tell what was real and what was fake, his head was spinning, soon he’d just black out from the oxygen deprivation alone and maybe that’d stop him thinking, maybe that would be a good thing.
He triggered the alarm purposefully as he forced his way into the lobby, because it was just an easier way of getting what he wanted. After that, all he had to do was wait for a member of the Fantastic Four to get from the penthouse down the ground floor.
It just so happened that they passed a clock in the corridor in that moment, and Tony came face to face with the depressing realisation that it was only 2 in the afternoon. And like he’d said, they weren’t even close to being done yet.
Tony glanced up at it, and then looked back to Steve. The man huffed. “You probably don’t remember,” he murmured, “But you woke up for a bit when we got you on the jet and, uh, told me what you’d been planning.”
It was inevitable, really- six people, two of them meeting everyone for the first time- it was bound to cause studying problems. And also the fact that Clint brought a crate of beer to ‘help with their concentration’.
But he couldn’t just do that for Tony. Because he knew the boy, dammit, and so Steve also knew that there was no way Tony wasn’t going to be splurging out on the best ever gift for Steve. It would be something amazing, like it had been for his birthday, and then Steve was going to feel like an absolute tool when he turned around and gave Tony something shitty in return. He couldn’t do that.
Steve just laughed and then leaned back, sliding away in order to hold onto the railings behind him and look down at Tony. He looked absolutely ravishing; well fitted jeans and a blazer, with a dress shirt tucked in and creasing around washboard abs Tony knew were underneath. As he leaned back onto the rails, the fabric stretched to try and accommodate the flex of his muscles. Tony wanted to tear the whole thing right off him. Alas, there were a few more hours to go before Tony got to do that, so he resigned himself with simply observing. That was half of the fun anyway.
“I’d rather not risk it, thanks,” Tony jumped down the staircase and grabbed another denim jacket from the coat-hanger by the door, “I’ll take this one, you take that one. Then we are both appropriately equipped for riding around New York.”
Tony opened his mouth and then grinned. “Yep,” he said with an enthusiastic nod, “yep, I am… one hundred percent. Sorry about Thor, by the way. He likes to pick up strays. Makes him feel useful.”
“Where’s Nick Fury,” the woman said, voice hard, face tight—and Steve realised, for the first time, that the universe was bigger than just them.
you’ve driven me halfway across the state to undoubtedly complete the act you just asked me whether or not I was okay with?”
“Alright Sam,” Steve pushed his forehead back, sending him rolling across the floor, “time’s up. My turn now.”
There was a round of murmured agreement, and Tony stood back up again gently, walking over to Steve and sharing an apprehensive look. "Right," he said with a swallow, "back to bed for us, I guess."
Clint pulled a face, but leaned back all the same. “I’ll show you all,” he muttered, “he’s a child prodigy, I’m calling it now.”
“Ha ha,” Steve rolled his eyes and swung off the door frame, “I’m gonna veto that rule on the grounds that Tony is super hot and I get to make out with him, which is honestly much more appealing than staying here and being sat on by Sam again. Sorry!” His friends booed at him loudly, but he only laughed as he ducked back out of the door and grabbed his keys from the side. “I say that with the utmost love!” He called out to them all, before pulling open the door and stepping outside.
Tony whines and shuts his eyes, which isn’t a good idea, because his sight is the only thing keeping him balanced, and he quickly discovers this as he keels forward directly into Steve’s waiting arms.
Steve could only follow as he was led toward soft lights and warm walls in which the dancer had spent his many hours practising in. It was very simple, Steve realised, once he was actually inside. Just nice pastel walls and polished wodden floors, with white carpeting that had somehow managed to retain it’s cleanliness running along the corridors and main lobby.
To be honest, he hadn’t even expected anyone to notice, really- they were just a few clothes, after all. Nothing special. The team used his stuff all the time- what made this different? Nothing, that was what. It wasn’t like Tony… hoarded it, or anything. And he
“Yeah- I need you to come over. Briefly.” Steve frowned when he heard a few clatters in the background and a muffled curse. “I’m having a few technical difficulties and I would appreciate some… assistance.”
A knock on the door interrupted him from his thought, and Tony turned just as Steve poked his head around the corner. His brow creased a little when he took in Tony’s posture, braced against the sink and holding a comb in his hand but making no move to actually use it. “Are you okay?” He asked at once, stepping in slowly, “you left pretty hastily back there.”
The man didn’t let go, but pulled Tony in instead, and suddenly Tony was pressed up against a soft, naked chest.
Tony was lying on the floor, but Steve couldn’t go check on him just yet. This monster was quickly and dangerous, and it would take only a moment to incapacitate Steve as well. Steve waited a second, watching the prone monster. It wasn’t moving. He approached it slowly, body coiled tight, ready to leap away at the slightest twitch. The body convulsed, the stinger swinging, and Steve stopped, ready. It didn’t get up. He approached again, still cautious. When he was within range, he swung, angling for the sharp part of the shield, and chopped the thing’s head off, then sprung out of range again before the stinger could decide to move anymore. Steve watched a bit more, just to be extra sure. (One of the previous monsters, a particularly vicious one that had the body of a hyena with too many teeth and a too big jaw, had been killed in a square. When they turned their backs on it, it had started attacking civilians.)
Tony walked through the halls and the corridors with a spring in his step and, he believed, a glimmer in his eyes. He was a man on a mission, and he knew what he had to do. He was going to finish his mission, no matter the cost.
Steve got up to check the door, but it was stuck. He was just about to look at the ventilation that the monster had come through, when he heard a choking sound.
That’s why they were here. Horrifying creatures had been appearing seemingly by random all over New York. It had taken them a while to find the source of the horrifying creatures, but here they were, at long last.
“This was… too easy,” Steve muttered. For all the trouble that the monsters had given them, he would have thought that their creators would have been more resistance than this.
Tony paused, confused.  Then, he had a sudden flashback to all the times Obie had put a small, brightly colored object into his pocket. He would do it in smooth motions, practiced to not draw the eye, and he had been doing them for years without anyone realizing. Magicians often used colorful talismans to help them in their spell-casting.
Steve turned, body naturally settling into a fighting stance with his shield held in front of him, and took in the scene in a moment: there was a monster in the room, some kind of raccoon thing with a scorpion’s tail, and on the ceiling, there was a vent with a monster-sized hole. In the next moment, he was moving. The monster was smaller than the others, about waist-high, but Tony was focused on the computer, so his reaction might be delayed. Steve threw the shield, but the thing was
There was a lock of hair out of place on Steve’s head, and without thinking, Tony reached up and pushed it back. His fingers pressed lightly into Steve’s scalp, and he looked up at him through his long lashes.
“Those who get stabbed by the smallest monster while in a suit of armor don’t have the right to complain,” Thor added, grinning.
Tony stared at their clasped hands, and then swallowed. He came to a decision. “Okay.” He nodded. “Okay, yeah. I’ll help you, whatever you need.” Tony lifted his gaze to Steve’s own bright, earnest eyes.
“I should hope so, I practically raised you,” he said easily, slipping a juicy prawn onto his plate.
“You’re free now,” Tony murmured, too weak to speak any louder. Steve was shaking his head, but Tony didn’t know why. He was now free to go back to protecting America just like he used to, or spending the rest of his life in retirement, if that was what he wanted. This was his happy ending.
“Oh, Tony,” the man sighed. “I wish I had the time to show you how valuable and precious you really are, but time is running out. I’m under a curse, and I desperately need your help to save the kingdom.”
Tony flinched, and shot to his feet. He ran to hide the magic books that he had left haphazardly on his workbench.
It was a lovely night. The air was clear, and the full moon shone as bright as the sun in the sky, shedding its gentle light on her subjects. The moon was kinder than the sun, Tony thought. She allowed whoever wanted to hide to be hidden, and whoever wanted to see could see. The stars shone throughout the sky like a tapestry, the most beautiful and majestic tapestry that no one could buy or sell. It was all he had, but it was turning out to be a good amount.
Tony looked her in the eyes, and his heart melted. What was he doing, distrusting his own girlfriend like this? Surely, if she said she could explain herself, she would. Tony nodded, and followed her to the door.
“What are you guys talking about?” Tony asked. He tried not to sound accusatory, but he wasn’t sure how well he succeeded. “I’m the one who attends the balls and galas… I’ve been keeping abreast of the political situation.”
Nothing. Finally satisfied, Steve moved to the next priority item: Tony, who had not assisted, nor shown any signs of movement since he had been stung.
Suddenly, Sunset was kissing him, warm and tender. Tony tried to pull away to say something, but she held him in place for a few moments longer. When Sunset pulled back, Tony was breathing heavily. “Tony, I love you so much. Please, trust me.”
“Tony, maybe you’ve missed the memo, but you’ve completely fucked things up,” Obie said with a finality that beat on Tony’s heart painfully. “You’ve lost it recently. We need to hand feed you the recent updates in the political world before every event, because you can’t be bothered to actually read up on the news yourself. No, you’re much too busy stepping out with that woman who only wanted to steal from you. Honestly, your father’s such a good judge of character, I don’t know what happened with you.”
“You said you were cursed,” Tony said hesitantly. “But you didn’t give the full details. I just… Steve Rogers is a legend. And he lives happily ever after, you know? So how…,” Tony waved a hand towards Steve, “the swan thing, I just—”
With jerky movements, he went out the door. He didn’t know where he was going, but he was going to get there fast. All while he walked along the corridors, the thought of
“Yeah. I don’t know why, but… well, he’s been talking to Barnes a lot lately. I don’t know. I know I’m doing a lot wrong, but I don’t know how to fix it.”
Another day, another charity ball. Tony had no idea what the ball was raising money for. He felt like the days were bleeding into each, and there was no time for rest. What he did know was who he had to talk to today to keep good relations up between them, and then maybe he could make an early exit and finally get some sleep. He was talking to an important ambassador when something caught his eye. He turned slightly to get a better view, all while keeping up the stream of small talk with the man. The hair style was different, but Tony would know her anywhere: it was Sunset Bain. She wasn’t wearing her usual dazzling ball gown. She didn’t seem to be trying to stand out at all, in fact, she seemed to be trying to disguise herself as a waitress. Tony felt his heart hammer away in his chest. Why was she disguised like that? Why hadn’t she been answering his calls? Why didn’t she just come to him earlier so they could figure it all out? He had been starting to doubt her in the face of his father’s accusations, but now that Tony could see her, all he wanted to do was just talk to her. It couldn’t be that their whole relationship was built on a lie. Tony felt reassured that they would be able to figure it out if they just talked. As soon he could politely excuse himself, Tony made his way to her.
“Yes, you’ve said that.” Tony could appreciate being smashed up against a warm chest, but he was starting to think that eye-contact might be important here. He leaned his head back so he could look the alleged Steve Rogers in the eyes. Steve stopped patting his head, which was a loss Tony felt keenly, and loosened his hold, but didn’t let go. That was a plus.
Steve cradled Tony’s face in his hands, and they stared into each other’s eyes like they were staring at their own salvations. “You did,” Steve whispered. “You really did it. I didn’t think you would be able to, but you actually got me out of there.”
“You want to read it again? But, it’s just a silly storybook…” Dum-E pushed the book into his hands. Tony grinned despite himself. “Fine, you big bag of bolts.” Tony sat down in a chair, and Dum-E came around so his camera was pressing right up against the book. Tony smiled and gently pushed the camera back so he could actually see the pages.
“Whoa, whoa, slow down there! What are you acting like I abandoned you for? I was just here yesterday.” Tony grinned and reached out to pet the bot’s support strut. Exhaustion weighed down heavily on him, and he ended up leaning heavily on Dum-E’s sturdy form. Dum-E beeped in question. “It’s fine,” he said around a yawn. God, he should clean up his workshop. He had left his books on magic out on the table where anyone could see them. They weren’t illegal or anything, but they were generally frowned upon, and his father would
“NO!” Tony shrieked, and took his gun out. Immediately, gasps erupted around the room and everyone backed away. Tony pointed the gun right at Stane. “Let him go!”
Steve’s body was curling in on itself, pushing in around Tony’s body, as if to shield him from the world.
When Sunset Bain had first appeared in his life, Tony had thought he had finally found someone who was really interested in Tony. Not Prince Stark, heir to the throne, but Tony, who had a soft spot for the old fairy tales, who played around with robotics, who had a picture of his late mom in his pocket watch. Tony shook his head, and tried to focus. Tiberius’s goal all along had been to appear on the front page, and Sunset, it now appeared, was just to get the royal seal. Tony was just a door people went through to go somewhere else.
In that instant, Tony noticed something. A slight hesitation, a fraction of a pause, a twitched eyebrow. Something infinitesimally small in Stane’s mannerism, but something that wouldn’t have been there if he hadn’t been guilty. Tony saw it, and felt sure.
Steve was a blur of motion. He grabbed the knife Tony had used, and ran at Stane. Stane turned and tried to run, but Steve was too fast. The next second, Steve grabbed him and stabbed him right in the heart. Stane gasped, fell to the floor, and writhed. He stared up at the blood-covered Steve in disbelief, and then his face went slack.
“Rothbart? The old magician?” Tony turned around and saw his father at his back. “He’s dead, boy, nothing but a legend. What nonsense are you talking about?”
Steve stopped more from shock than anything else. He had never heard Tony sound so small and unsure of himself. He turned to look at Tony. Tony must have been thinking the same thing, because he cleared his throat and sat up straighter.
“I’m Steve Rogers, the Knight of America. Please. The kingdom is in danger, and I need your help to save it.”
Steve noticed that Tony’s breathing had gone from hyperventilating to elevated, and he breathed a sigh of relief. But they were still alone in this dark, hostile room, with nothing else to do and nowhere else to go. Steve felt a deep, burning embarrassment at the thought that he had just sung for Tony. Tony wasn’t saying anything now, but what about later? Would he laugh, and tell the team about Steve’s out-of-practice voice, and the tune he couldn’t carry in a bucket? Steve shook himself. Whatever happened, happened, and there was no point in torturing Tony over something he hadn’t even done yet. No matter what happened next, Tony was now looking at him with big, hopeful eyes, and Steve just wanted him to not be afraid. To know that Steve would protect him, no matter what.
Tony flinched. He grit his teeth and breathed through the pain, the way he had learned a long time ago. “I know, but—”
“No, I know that you’ve been lying all this time. To us. To father. To me.” Obie made as if to walk away, but Tony stepped in front of him.
“You thought I wouldn’t notice when one of my own swans was just teleported to the middle of the palace?” Stane asked in a companionable voice.
“I’m sorry, Father. It, uh, must have been something I ate. Nothing more.” There’s silence. Tony doesn’t chance a glance up. “I’m… I’ll be fine.”
He ached for his picture of Mother, but they had taken that away too. He had tried replicating it in a piece by drawing it on a piece of paper, but the nurses took that away too. The only thing he had really managed to keep for himself was his feather, through a mix of tenacity and cleverness. This they would not take from him.
“Tony, what’s gotten into you?” A crease formed between his eyebrows when he frowned. “You’ve been off all night. For a while, actually. I was hoping you’d be over this business now that you’ve left that Bain woman, but you’ve just gotten worse. I—”
Steve was running, but he was too late. Tony hesitated in blasting the monster because it was so close to him. All it took was a second, but it was enough for the monster to latch onto his shoulders like a vice, and stab its stinger right into the weak point on his neck.
“Rothbart? That evil sorcerer that mothers use to scare their children?” Barnes scoffed. “What are you talking about, your highness? You’re joking, right? I just stepped out to get a breath of fresh air.”
And that was the moment when the King shot Tony an almost pitying glance, and Tony’s heart sunk. Why would anyone love him, anyway? He couldn’t think of a single reason, in that moment.
Tony put his hands down on the dresser. There was something wrong with him, he suspected. Some deep, gaping emptiness where his heart should be. That must be why no one ever stayed, or seemed to want to be with him. Before that had been Tiberius, who had just been using him for the attention from the press, and now…
Tony let himself be tugged a few steps, and then hesitated and looked back at the ball room. “Sunset, please, just  tell me…”
Steve ducked his head down. Relief softened him, and he looked very vulnerable all of a sudden. “Thank you,” he whispered.
Tony looked back, and found one of security guards running after them. The man startled when he realized who Tony was.
“You were a swan, mister, I’m not sure if it would be good for my sanity to even entertain this… I was going to just end it all, why did you have to stop me—”
, too tight and hot, flashed through his chest. He still did not know what to say, so he just threw himself through the door.
Steve’s left arm was limp, and he was covered in gashes, but he spared a glance at Tony. There was a pause in the motion. Then, Steve sidestepped a blow, barreled straight into Tony and his captor, and they all went down.
“Oh, Tony,” Obie said. Obie was the King’s advisor, and had been in the castle since the queen, Maria, had died. “There you are. I’ve been meaning to talk to you.”
Maybe eye contact was a bad idea. Steve’s eyes gave Tony vertigo. They made it a bit difficult to think. Tony closed his eyes and rallied his senses, and tried again. He stepped away so they could have a face-to-face conversation like normal people. He opened his eyes.
Steve was leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed. He didn’t want to go any further into the room and deal with any consequences of his actions, but at the same time he couldn’t bear to leave without seeing that Tony was okay. Tony was such a confident and larger-than-life character that seeing him so small and fragile had really shaken Steve.
“Tony, sweetheart, you don’t think I actually stole the seal, do you?” She fixed him with her big, brown eyes, and pouted. “I would never do something so horrible. I thought you trusted me!”
“Daddy’s home!” Tony called, throwing open the doors to his workshop. From the charging pod, Dum-E perked up and excitedly whirred his claw around. Dum-E nearly came barreling into him, and Tony held his hands up.
“There you are,” the King muttered. He came down the steps into Tony’s workshop. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you. What are you doing down here?”
Tony trailed off when he felt a nudge. He looked up through bleary eyes to Dum-E tentatively holding out a book. Not just any book, of course, but the story about the knight, Steve Rogers, who defeated the evil magician, Rothbart. It was a beautifully illustrated edition that the had treasured throughout his childhood. Continued to treasure, despite having grown up.
“Dummy? What, that dumb machine you programmed? You have got to be kidding me. Tony, get up here so we can fix this. Do you know what’s happened?”
Pressed slacks, dress shirt, light blue suit jacket, blue and green cravat, gold cufflinks, and Maria’s pocket watch. There was no real reason why Tony took extra care to dress for the ball, since it wouldn’t matter in the end when he finally confronted Barnes or Rothbart, but it was what he defaulted on usually. It was as far from real armor as you could get, but it made him feel safe and protected all the same. With a final look at reflection in the mirror, Tony nodded his head in approval and set off.
Sunset jumped. “Tony! I didn’t think you were coming today…” She trailed off. She wasn’t really looking at him, but scanning the room.
He began to chant words of the spell he had come up with himself, using an old English dictionary, pieces from magic books, and prayers.
“When you’re able to walk in a straight line, we’ll throw you a party.” Jan picked up her bag. “Well, we’ll leave you to your convalescing, Tony. Try not to take over the hospital while we’re gone.” For a split second, the way Jan was looking at Tony turned a bit fond. “Take care of yourself.”
Obie took his hand off, and continued to the rail of the balcony, Barnes right behind. Tony stood there for a moment, hands clenched. He was vibrating, coming apart at the seams. Would he explode and take out everything around him, or would he simply crumble into himself, bones collapsing and arteries spilling everywhere?
“I’m glad you think so, but we don’t always get what we deserve. My friend, Barnes, he… I lost him, during a quest. He was my greatest partner, and best friend. We were practically brothers. I couldn’t leave him to his fate, even though the King forbid me from going after him. In my arrogance, I thought I could take on Rothbart by myself… but I couldn’t. Instead of saving my friend, I got myself captured, so we were both stuck. We weren’t killed, but cursed to forever remain under his power. He keeps many warriors as his own flock of swans, and he turns us back so we can do his bidding on occasion.”
Barnes snorted, nastily. “Maybe you haven’t been sleeping because you’ve been boning your girlfriend.”
“Oh, quite well. I’ve always liked coming out to these fancy parties with their pretty rooms and even prettier girls.” A noblewoman half his age walked by, and Obie smiled at her. “And what about you, my boy?”
Sunset put her arm in Tony’s. “I know, babe, I’m so sorry. It was just so difficult to get in touch with you with all the security measures, you know? Everyone is so quick to believe that the poor girl is the one stealing their precious things.”
There was a soft quiet for a moment, filled only with the sound of water going by under the bridge, and Tony’s panting. Then, “What if I want it?” Asked softly.
Tony dumbly nodded, too stunned to say anything. Then, he jolted out of the man’s arms, shook himself off, and turned to him. “What the fuck was that?” He demanded. “You were an actual swan just… five seconds ago, how could … am I dead? Is this death? I thought it would either be really nice or really horrible, but this is just turning into a strange fever dream, and I don’t really understand—”
A piece of debris, broken off by the monster’s forced entry, fell from the ceiling and landed horrifyingly close to Tony’s face. Tony didn’t so much as twitch. Steve ran to his side.
He unbuttoned his shirt with hands that felt like lead, and wondered where on earth his energy had gone. It hadn’t been that taxing of a day, right? He had just been played like the world’s biggest fool.
Tony ran the whole way out of the room and back into the ballroom. He looked around until he found Stane, and he went to pursue him after putting the pistol back into his pocket. He was frazzled, scared, and unsure of himself. What was he going to do? The time was almost up for the completion of the spell, but there wasn’t much he could do about it, was there? He was just going to have to confront Stane in front of everyone. Maybe if he could convince his father, it would be okay.
