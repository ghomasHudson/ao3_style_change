Steve kept hinting and Tony knew it, but he played dumb. That could only last for so long. He wasn’t known as a genius for nothing.
“I know. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to come off as an asshole…” Tony sighs. “I’m just saying let me get you new stuff, stuff you’ll actually like and will be comfortable in. You also need things for the baby and-”
“He never did. Believe it or not but he forgave you for all the crap you put him through.”
“Okay. It’s okay. You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.”
But even if Steve was out getting some space, Tony didn’t like the idea of him being on his own. He didn’t want to accuse Steve of being unstable, but as of late his emotions had been a mess.
The rain pours harder and thunder continues to rumble from the dark sky. Peter ignores all of it. But then a new sound fills his ears and he lifts his head, a flash of red and gold filling his line of vision.
Steve sighs again. “But Tony is…different. He’s not talking to me and it’s frustrating. I just want to help like I do here.”
Eventually Peter breaks away and wipes at his nose with the sleeve of his hoodie. “Are you going to leave now?”
“I won’t?” Tony asks, even though he knows his son was right. That doesn’t stop him from trying to get inside the small tent. Peter giggles when Tony falls over and Dodger rushes to Tony to comfort him with kisses. “I’m okay, Dodge. I guess Petey-Pie was right.”
But Peter wasn’t it.
“Are you ready?” Bruce asks. Peter wants to shake his head and run from the room, but he finds himself nodding. “Great. Just lie back and relax okay?”
Tony doesn’t want to say it gets easier-he still struggles with his son on occasions-but he eventually understands more of what his son wants. Tony becomes so proud of his ability to care for his son that he no longer hides behind the walls of his penthouse. He takes Peter out, showing him around the compound.
“You have to fight, remember?” Bucky reminds him. “You never back down. Come on, Steve, you have to keep fighting.”
“I know he’s struggling. You don’t have to say it.”
He rises to his feet on shaky legs, one hand flying toward the wall to steady himself when he staggers. He cleans up the mess and splashes water on his face before stepping out of the bathroom and into his bedroom.
“You’re so good at that.” Tony smiles.
And this time Steve believes him. He could do this. He wasn’t going to hide away from the rest of the world anymore. His freedom was returned to him and he was ready to take that large step. The world was in his hand now.
“So listen I know I said I wanted to help you, and trust me I do, but I gotta know more. I can’t exactly help if I don’t know all the details.”
Tony returns with a calm Harley and he hands him to Steve. “He’s all bandaged and begging for you. I have to head out.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony says. “I’m so sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t be there for you and him. I’m sorry I didn’t make more of an effort to be in your lives. I’m sorry for all the wrongs I’ve done.”
Tony’s eyes fill with more tears and he turns away.
“Tony-”
It’s Bruce who answers: “We just wanted to make sure you were okay.”
Hearing his son ramble on and on about anything and everything brings a small smile to Tony’s face. The kid was bubbly and animated; it was difficult not to smile when he spoke.
Tony hums against his lips and pulls Steve closer. Steve follows willingly, the urge to be near his mate too strong to ignore. They break apart and Tony lovingly strokes the side of Steve’s face.
It proves two is better than one when it comes to building the crib. Steve had faith from the beginning that Tony could complete it on his own, but he doesn’t regret offering to help. They were both tired and not in their right minds.
“I think you have it all wrong. I couldn’t live without you. Tony, you’re the only one who can make me feel good about myself. I thought you’d hate me and how I looked, but I was wrong. I feel like myself when I’m around you.”
“You don’t have to do that.”
“Likewise. It’s great to have you back.”
Steve chuckles and joins Tony on the bed, wrapping an arm around him and pulling him close. “You know we need a doctor,” Steve points out.
They share one last look, then Steve leaves and doesn’t look back. Just like a breakup is supposed to happen.
Tony’s heart flutters at those words. They hadn’t shared those three words yet, but just because they hadn’t been said didn’t mean Tony hadn’t thought about saying them. There was no denying the way he felt for Steve. It wasn’t just trying to protect Steve and the pup anymore. Tony loved them both, more than he thought he could love anyone.
Sam smiles. “There you go.”
And Tony let him do it a lot.
The day starts off normal enough. Steve wakes before the sun to get to his morning workout, punches a few bags until he’s broken a sweat, then returns back to the penthouse and sets up coffee for his still sleeping boyfriend. He purposely waits on a shower, hoping Tony would join him and they start the day right.
“Favorite color?”
Steve crawls over to Tony and curls up against him, burying his nose into the crook of the alpha’s neck and inhaling his scent. Tony touches him this time, wrapping his arms around Steve’s frame and holding him close. It’s not long before Steve is purring.
Peter gets to go home a few days later.
“Pa!” Peter pats Steve’s leg and looks up at him with his bright, brown eyes. He flashes another smile. “Pa-pa!”
“Really? You’re ignoring me now? I mean I guess that’s fair since I blew you off but… dammit, Rogers I need you to answer me! Please tell me I don’t have a kid. I thought you and Barnes…” Tony sighs harshly and takes a second to compose himself. “Call me back. I’m...I’m sorry okay? I’m sorry and I want to talk. I’m ready now.”
“If you say so.”
“Hmm,” Pepper frowns and moves on from the tie to adjust Tony’s suit jacket. “That is scary.”
Harley giggles this time. “Shit.”
It’s Morgan’s whimpers that force them apart. Steve adjusts the bottle and she’s latching on again, greedily taking her fill. Steve can’t help but chuckle at her eagerness.
Just seeing it in person again brings tears to Peter’s eyes. He walks closer to get a better look, running his hand along the star. This suit was purposely made to contrast his papa’s original suit. No one could ever be him. It was time for a new Captain America.
It was one of Tony’s favorite things about Steve. And now it was his favorite about Peter.
Peter groans but fastens the button anyway. He was close to being late and didn’t have time to change again.
“Sorry,” Tony mumbles, the apology for his mate and not the other alpha. Steve wonders if Tony was even more stubborn than himself.
“What?” Tony asks.
“Uh-huh. We played all day and built a fort,” Peter responds.
“Speaking of baby,” Tony says and sets Harley down so that he can put Sarah into the stroller. “We better go. Pete’s not having it.”
He sounds every bit as sad as he looks. It was crazy how he went from happy about his son’s name to reverting back into sadness. And it was all of Tony's doing.
They’re both on the sofa. Alpine is in his lap, purring softly as he scratches behind her ear. Sam almost doesn’t want to disturb his husband’s pleasant mood. These days anything could set Bucky off.
Tony slams on the breaks and the tires squeal. Peter looks up, expecting to find them at a red light. But instead they’re stopped in the middle of the road. Cars are beginning to pull up behind them; a few honking their horns.
Tony’s head snaps up and finds Steve lingering near the end of the couch. He doesn’t seem upset anymore, the small smile on his face proof that he was willing to forgive and move on.
She loved her parents, even when they were too clingy or overprotective. They were doing their best and she appreciated their love and hard work.
Before Tony can answer, Sarah beats him to it. “Daddy, blew up tree.”
Steve breaks the kiss and shoves Tony back until he’s landing on the bed. Steve joins him, hovering over him and ducking his head down to connect their lips again. Tony moans into the kiss and grips Steve’s waist, both hands trailing down until they’re resting on his ass. Steve responds by grinding down, rubbing his hardening cock against Tony’s.
“No.”
Tony responds with a small grunt. He’s close too, just a little more and he’d be spilling inside. His thrusts become harder, faster. Steve is crying out his name and his back lifts off the bed. Tony groans when his cock is squeezed by Steve’s tight heat.
“I’m sorry.”
Tony huffs and pulls himself to his feet. “I guess you’d rather stay in there instead of having some of the delicious lunch Papa made.”
He’s about halfway done with the dishes when he hears Steve come in. The soft sound of his feet against the floor is difficult to ignore, especially since it’s a sound he’s been waiting for. He turns right when Steve enters the kitchen, and sends his husband a smile.
“Just a stupid mission.”
Tony clears his throat, the first sound he’s made since his family and guest sat down. He doesn’t miss the way his husband quickly reaches for his wine glass and nearly chugs most of it down. He reaches for Steve’s hand and takes it, giving it a reassuring squeeze that says, ‘I’ll be nice’.
“Hi, Petey,” Steve coos and gently brushes back his son’s messy hair. Peter yawns again and one arm slips free from the blanket he’s wrapped in. Sarah takes this as another opportunity to touch her baby brother. She giggles when he squirms.
“And if it doesn’t?”
“Yeah.”
“What? Go ahead. Tell me.”
Peter hugs her tighter. “I love you, Auntie Nat. Don’t ever leave.”
Two more people were still missing.
Natasha chuckles from somewhere behind him. Steve turns slightly, wincing from the dull ache that has yet to disappear in his lower half. He finds her sitting on the bed beside him.
The message ends.
Tony tries to reach for his cock, but it’s squished between them, rubbing along his growing middle and smearing precum along the underside of it. He forgets about jerking himself off, knowing he was going to cum untouched. He just needs a little more.
“I guess.”
Steve enters the room, sweaty and panting from his morning run.
“Bye,” James says quietly and waves.
Steve frowns at those words. “Take him back? Tony, I’m not taking him back out there. He could get picked up or-”
He remembered being bored out of his mind and eventually being dragged away from the party to meet with Mr. Pierce, but what follows is a blur. He doesn’t remember chasing after an omega. The only omega he remembers is…
“I hate to break it to you but I can’t get drunk.”
“Nothing, nothing. I have something that came up and can’t meet with him today.”
“Yeah,” Tony nods and types away with one hand on the keyboard while the other keeps his son secure in his lap. “What color, Har?”
“I’ve never seen you so grumpy. You’re usually up before the sun and cheery as hell.”
Steve frowns down at his son. “Duty, Har. D-u-t-y.”
“Come on,” she says and he follows after her when the elevator doors open.
Just thinking about the test and the results he read this morning make him want to gag. A hand travels down to his belly. He catches himself and pulls it away.
“When have I done that?” Steve questions. Tony doesn’t miss the way his voice takes on a defensive tone.
“True. We’ll figure it out. Go to sleep, Tones.” Steve presses his lips to Tony’s temple.
Tony whines low in his throat, the sound foreign to his own ears. The strong, warning growls he normally made couldn’t be repeated. He was broken.
Steve chuckles. “You’re pregnant.”
I’m sorry it’s taken me a while to update this one! Also sorry it’s on the short side. But it’s fluffy so that helps, right?
“It’s a...look, I’m working out the details okay? If it gets bad then I’ll get help.”
Tony ignores everyone else around him. Right now all that matters is the man in front of him.
“Really?” Steve sniffs again.
“Hydra. They wanted the serum for themselves. They had a leader, Johann Schmidt. He used to be partners with Dr. Erskine and together they worked on the serum.”
“You don’t think they’re helping, do you?”
If it helps...Peter is coming in the next chapter.
“Stark’s here,” Clint is the first to notify the group, and everyone turns toward Tony and Peter. Clint smiles and pats Tony on the back. “The missing piece has arrived.”
“He had you and those other crazy people.”
But Peter was letting himself get carried away. He needed to think and think and think until he was a hundred percent sure about what he wanted. He thought he could make a big decision alone, but maybe he needed another person.
“I was just trying to keep it a surprise.”
“You missed me being born. That was important, right?”
Steve blocks the man coming at him, taking him down quickly and moving onto the next. A fiery pain shoots through him, forcing him to stop. One glance at his right shoulder confirms his suspicion; he’s been shot. Steve grits his teeth from the pain and keeps fighting, refusing to back down.
“I missed you, sweetheart,” Steve tells her, his voice soft and soothing. It’s nothing like it used to be. There’s no anger or frustration in his tone; he appears happy to have her.
Tony would know. He’s been on a few different brands in his lifetime. It took time for him to find one that actually worked and mellowed the symptoms. But with Steve it’s different. He still has his good and bad days, but lately it’s as if he’s had more bad than good. The medication should be doing it’s thing by now.
Steve is gripped again by his shoulder and forced against the wall, his arms splayed wide on the cool tile. The hot water burns his skin and he hisses behind gritted teeth, eyes squeezing shut.
“You did good,” Tony says and interlocks their hands as they follow Agent Coulson back to their private room. Steve smiles and turns to hide the growing blush on his face. “I mean it. Talking about this stuff isn’t going to be easy.”
There was the idea of going through Peter’s room while he was at school, but Steve felt guilty for invading his son’s privacy like that. But he was at his wits end. He wanted answers.
His alpha snarls in anger and wrestles with the chains, but still he’s unable to rush to Steve’s side.
It was time to welcome the newest family member.
But regardless of the heart he had, he still managed to destroy someone else’s. He never woke up every morning with an agenda to hurt people. His company was proof that he cared about others. He wouldn’t be creating new tech to clean and save the world if he didn’t.
“Don’t think about that yet.”
“I’ll get in the habit of it then.”
“Thank you.”
“Because I know deep down it turns you on.” Tony waggles his eyebrows suggestively.
And to the person who wanted a SamBucky baby...don’t worry 😉
I'm not that cruel. There's no way I'd make poor Steve suffer by carrying Pierce's evil spawn. No more hurt for Steve!
Peter is ready to protest, too hesitant and terrified to let his dad take him. The rest of the team would discover that Peter had been lying and sneaking out to meet the one person they weren’t fond of.
“Where’s my hug?” Sam fakes offended. Peter hugs him next.
“You can just leave that there,” Tony gestures toward a spot by the door. Peter nods and leaves his backpack behind, then follows his dad into the living room. “You thirsty?”
A hot shower is exactly what Steve needs. The water feels good against his skin, especially when it hits the muscles of his lower back. The ache there isn’t too bad and for the most part he’s able to tolerate it. It’s not until his stomach cramps up again does he lose his composure and cry out. He leans forward, resting his head against the tiled wall of the shower, inhaling slowly through his nose and blowing that air out.
“Good. Guess we’re on the same page.”
“Promised what?”
Tony hums and he pulls away slightly so that their eyes can meet. “Why do I have the feeling this party was for you?”
Steve rips himself away with a huff. “You’re being immature, Tony. He’s part of our family.”
“That is not something you need right now! Dammit, Steve, you’re just giving up. Why? Why now are you giving up? That’s not you!”
“No, they’re not that bad.” Steve lifts his head and connects his eyes with Tony’s, offering him a small smile of reassurance. “I’m okay. Remember this happened with Pete, too. It’s fine.”
Steve is snapped from his thoughts when Tony touches him. The omega flinches and tries to pull his hand away, only to stop himself when he realizes there was no threat. It was just Tony. He was safe with him.
“No! No nothing like that-”
Steve doesn't hesitate to obey and he looks up, connecting their eyes.
He’s gone on countless missions with his team, but this had been the first where he didn’t feel like himself. The pain in his stomach never did go away, if anything it seemed to get worse. He ignored it to the best of his ability, but he was quickly learning that ignoring it wasn’t going to be enough anymore.
“Stop!” Natasha cries out. Hot tears are streaming down her face now. The bickering among the team dies down instantly from her reaction. “Just stop,” she says a little softer now. “This isn’t what Peter wanted. And this sure as hell isn’t what Steve wanted.”
And he’s terrified of leaving his son alone for the first time.
“Is that...is that okay?”
Morgan knows exactly what her brother is referring to. Every weekend Peter was training. Usually her parents took turns training him but lately it’s been their dad’s turn.
“At least I came home. Can you imagine me missing? Jesus the press would have a field day. You’d be a mess.”
He was free.
The smirk on Flash’s face means trouble and Peter is not in the mood to get his head dunked in the toilet or whatever it is that Flash has planned for him.
Before he makes his way upstairs, he pulls Tony in for another kiss.
Steve nods. Tony can see how shiny his eyes have gotten just by speaking about his former friend. He decides not to push for details. The last thing he wants to do is pour salt on the wound.
A snarky comment builds on Tony’s tongue, but for once he remains silent. He probably wouldn’t have time to even form the words. Bucky would have him dead in seconds.
Steve’s face lights up. The smile that appears is one of the brightest, most vibrant smiles Tony has ever witnessed on his husband.
He finds a bathroom first to relieve himself and fix his bed head, then he continues with his exploring. He’s seen the living room plenty enough and leaves it out of his tour. The kitchen is one of the largest he has ever seen. He doesn’t stay too long and keeps moving, his excitement only growing with every step.
“Okay so now you’re this huge omega that saves the day. Then what?”
“It’s okay. We probably need to get Morgan anyway. I’ll make it up to you,” Tony says with a wink.
“You’re leaving, aren’t you?” Peter asks.
“I thought you were going to kill me,” Tony retorts, making sure to muster up his own deathly glare.
It’s not long before he’s gathered what he wants to keep and items he feels content parting with. He gives up after a while and decides to join his aunt and uncle back in the living room.
“Just say yes. It’s that easy.” Bucky laughs.
The omega is writhing, spilling his own moans and cries of pleasure. He starts begging again, pleading for Tony to fuck him. Tony rips his fingers free and brings them up to his lips, sucking the slick off until his fingers are clean again.
“I’ll see what I can do.”
Steve winces. “Why do you have to say it like that?”
He forces his eyes open, regretting it the moment he does. Peter is lying over Steve’s lifeless body. Tony wants to rush toward his son and console him, to tell him everything is going to be okay.
Steve glances toward his left, eyes landing on his mate’s sleeping form. Tony is fast asleep, undisturbed by nightmares and past experiences. Steve can’t help but envy him for that. They both had gotten their lives back, but it seemed as if Steve was struggling a little more to regain his.
Morgan decides it was worth a shot. Maybe he wouldn’t mind if it was her waking him up and not the cries of her younger brother.
“I don’t know how to really explain. I just know I don’t feel like myself anymore.”
“Hey.” Tony holds up his hands. “Do whatever you want. We weren’t really a thing anyway.”
Tony sighs and gives up. Perhaps Steve was ignoring him. They hadn’t said much since that day with Happy. Steve had every right to be upset. It seemed the only person who was taking him seriously was...well, Jarvis. Tony had his doubts just like everyone else. He wishes he didn’t.
“Yes, sir. I feel much better.”
Steve shuts the water off and steps out of the shower and wraps one of the fluffy towels around his waist. Upon entering the bedroom, he’s greeted with the sight of fresh clothes laid out for him. Beside them is a large shopping bag, and one peek inside shows more clothes. They, just like everything else in this room, looked expensive. Steve almost doesn’t feel comfortable accepting them. But his old clothes weren’t going to cut it.
“It’s okay. Come in.”
Tony tries to keep himself occupied with the designs for the nursery, but all he can think about is the overwhelming urge to be with Steve and take their relationship to the next level. They’ve mated before, but Tony didn’t want a repeat of that night. He wanted it to be special.
He did not need to deal with Flash today.
Steve snaps his head up at those words. “What?”
“Oh my God.” Steve lets out a shaky breath and hunches forward again.
Steve nods and buries his face in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent of the alpha. Steve’s breath is warm against the sensitive skin there. One bite and Steve could claim him. Tony would be his alpha.
“Shh!” Tony shushes him and gets comfortable. “Pay attention because it’s a long story.”
He knows he should have let Steve talk instead of running away. Everything would be different now. Steve might still be alive and they’d be raising their son together. Maybe they would have ended up together at the end, get married and have a few more kids. Tony would still consider himself an Avenger and working alongside Steve and their team.
“Give me your hand, Pete.”
With one agent down, Steve focuses on the other. Rollins takes a little more effort, but soon he’s taking a hard punch to the face and hitting the floor with a thud.
Steve is hesitant at first, unsure of what he’s supposed to do. He’s never had sex like this before. He was usually forced to lie still and let the alphas take what they wanted. He was nothing but something for them to use.
“Shut up!” Steve pushes Tony into the wall, pinning him tight.
Tony didn’t think it was possible to be so nervous. He was usually more put together and full of confidence, but truth be told he wasn’t always as confident as people liked to assume. He had his moments where he didn’t feel worthy and it was times like that when he chose to hide away from the world. It was easier that way.
“Okay.” Peter smiles. “That sounds good. It’ll be fun.”
Tony rolls his eyes and pushes Happy out of the way. “She’s running a billion dollar company. She can’t just drop it and do whatever she wants.”
“No. Steve, you didn’t know about him. I’d be the biggest asshole in the world if I pointed the finger at you.”
Well, this story is finally over. I had a lot of fun writing it, even though it was hard not having Steve 😭
“I know, I know. I just thought it would be fun. Baby shopping is exciting. We still have so much to do before he gets here and I guess I just want to be prepared.”
“I can’t do this. I can’t do this.”
“Huh?” Peter glances down at his sweatshirt.
With Steve leaving the house every Wednesday and Friday, Tony is left in charge of their four pups. It’s difficult at first to manage them, especially when one of them loves to get into everything.
“Right. So getting her phone number was just for fun?”
Peter chuckles. “I do like you. I love you actually.”
“Right yeah. Well the offer still stands if you ever want to live here full time.”
“Pete-”
“Tony, no. Please.”
For the most part she does. The only time Morgan makes any signs of discomfort is when Tony shifts his arm. It’s easy to calm her down and soon she’s drifting back off to sleep.
“He has that onesie Nat made him,” Tony reminds.
Happy glances at Peter and one brow raises. “I did a background check on you. What kind of security guard would I be if I didn’t? You’re not a psychotic stalker. I don’t think you’re capable of hurting anyone.”
The bed is neatly made; it hasn’t been touched in weeks. Tony had trouble sleeping in his own bed, but lately he couldn’t bring himself to enter the large space. Other memories haunted this room.
They don’t race back. With his stomach acting up again, the idea of running back to the compound isn’t appeasing. Steve can’t help but wince when his stomach tightens and a wave of nausea crashes over him. He does his best to hide his discomfort, only to fail miserably.
“You look like your dad.” Steve sighs sadly. He reaches out to gently stroke Peter’s cheek with his thumb. Peter doesn’t even flinch from the touch. “You’re so beautiful.”
Peter’s eyes follow him. He had a feeling another lecture would be arriving any second now.
“At least Happy was there,” Tony points at the screen when his bodyguard appears in the video. Happy takes Tony inside and the SUV drives away. Tony huffs and scratches at his chin. “Guess I should’ve had him with me huh?” He says more so to himself.
“When you’re done with him maybe we can…”
Their glasses clink and they both take a drink. Even the champagne tastes expensive, but Steve’s not about to bring up money and the simplicity he asked for.
They hadn’t had any physical contact since their daughter was born. Steve still didn’t have the green light from his doctor to continue intimacy, but even if he did, he wouldn’t dare let Tony see his new figure. There was nothing appealing about it.
“Anyway. I want to make things right between us. I want to make up for lost time. I know you’re 15 now and I missed a lot but maybe we can still...yeah.”
“How long does it last?” Peter asks, and both he and Tony turn to Steve for the answer.
“Hey, Flash. I’m-” Peter cuts himself off when he sighs. He takes a breath before trying again. “Flash, I’m pregnant-fuck, no that’s-Flash, I know we hate each other and...that night at the party we promised we wouldn’t-but it happened and now I’m-”
He had figured Steve would’ve gone to stay with one of their friends until he was calm enough to work things out. But there was nothing to work out. Steve had made it clear that he was done. And it was all Tony’s fault.
Tony’s absence is unusual. He never arrives late anymore. How could he when he was married to the most punctual man on the planet? Before Steve, Tony was always running behind for briefings, but since they got together, Steve was making sure Tony’s tardiness became a thing of the past.
“Thanks, Buck. I’m just...scared. I don’t know what I’m doing.”
With his mind elsewhere and not on the project he was hoping he’d have completed by now, Tony takes a break and abandons his work. He doesn’t go to the bar, knowing damn well that there isn’t anything stocked to help him. He’s been drinking more coffee to fill the void. It doesn’t give him the same effect, but it was better than nothing.
“Anything?”
“I really am sorry,” Happy says after a few more minutes of silence passes between them. “I was a jerk. You’re actually not a bad guy.”
Tony takes Steve into his arms, careful not to hold him too tight and squish Morgan. He cradles Steve’s head, gently threading his fingers through the blond hair.
“Yes! Just...just give him mine and be done with it. Or better yet we name him Tony Jr.”
“Stop, stop.” Tony drops the bag and rushes to the panicking omega. He rests his hands over Steve’s broad shoulders. “Hey, look at me. He’s not going to find you. I got this under control.”
“Daddy?” Peter sits up and rubs at his eyes.
Tony waits for him downstairs, already dressed in a suit Steve had never seen before. Steve’s own suit doesn’t even compare, and for a moment he contemplates changing into something else, but then Tony smiles and his eyes brighten.
Peter looks up at the statue, wishing that he was staring at the real thing. He’d give anything to have more time with his father. He misses their long talks, the laughs they shared, and just his general presence. The void he left could never be filled.
“Oh.” Bucky sees the Mickey Mouse ears now. “How come I’m not there? I like the mouse too.”
Steve huffs. The book wobbles and falls over when the baby decides to switch positions. Steve chuckles and rearranges the book, only for another strong kick to push it off again.
“Hey,” Steve greets with a warm smile when he notices Tony entering the kitchen. “I made coffee and bacon. Just waiting on the pancakes.”
“You wanna?”
Tony trails his hands down to where Steve’s are holding him. “You don’t have to.”
Steve seals that promise with a kiss to Peter’s head. The newborn continues to nurse until his eyes flutter and his little tummy grows full. Steve hates that he has to wake his son when it comes time to burp him, and the whimper Peter makes when he’s disturbed only adds to Steve’s guilt.
“Sorry to bother you,” Morgan says and comes closer, still hesitant. Steve scoots over and she takes the spot beside him. “What are you doing?”
“Hasn’t moved since you left. I would have stopped him if he did,” Happy replies.
“She just said-”
Tony inhales sharply. Steve’s glad his back is turned and he can’t see the alpha’s face.
“Sorry if I woke you.”
“Thanks.”
Tony cradles his son close, smiling every time Peter does something simple as yawning or stretching. Steve is already on the verge of sleep, his eyelids struggling to stay open.
Tony goes to roll up the window, only to stop when Peter says, “I love you.”
Tony ignores Steve and takes his hand, leading him away from the lake and up a dirt trail.
I’m sorry 😢
“We don’t have to continue if you’re uncomfortable,” Dr. Strange finally says.
Not needing to be told twice, Tony positions himself between Steve’s legs and dips his hand below, circling a wet finger over Steve’s entrance. Steve tips his head back and his eyes fall shut, quiet moans and curses slipping past his lips when Tony rubs around his hole.
“And I’m not locked away, not really. You...you went a little overboard,” Steve chuckles.
“You’ll be okay,” Bruce assures, having sensed Peter’s hesitation. “Go ahead and make yourself comfortable. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
Steve allows Tony to pull him close and kiss him softly on the lips. He instantly relaxes the moment his mate’s arms are around him.
Steve nods his head. There was no point in trying to deny the feelings he still had for Tony. Everyone could clearly see how he felt. Tony saw it too but unlike everyone else, he chose to ignore it. It hurt knowing that Tony was hesitant to reciprocate those feelings, but despite that, Steve couldn’t stop loving Tony. He probably never will.
“It hurts. I just want it to go away. I need it to go away.”
“And the father?” Tony asks. Peter peers up at him, his jaw clenching. “Okay, okay. You don’t have to tell me. I just hope he’s not being an asshole.”
“Tony!” Steve calls out, rolling his eyes when he doesn’t get an immediate response.
When Tony’s not hiding away in his lab, he’s upstairs wearing a fake smile and pretending to be happy about the baby like he knows he’s supposed to be. A part of him almost backs out of his plan just because Steve looks so happy and excited. He’s practically glowing. He’s never looked so beautiful.
The elevator doors open and Peter is once again following Happy. They enter the penthouse together and Tony immediately greets them. He seems happier and not drunk. Peter’s happy with that. He needed his dad to be able to function properly.
“Did you have a good birthday? Or shower? We were celebrating both, right?” Tony chuckles as he carries armfuls of stuff up the stairs. He wouldn’t dare allow Steve to carry anything too heavy, which left the bags of clothes and bottles for Steve.
“Cap, forget the weapons,” Sam cuts in. “The point was to shut this operation down. Let this place burn.”
Peter snaps out of it when he hears his name being called. He blinks a few times before settling his eyes on the doctor in front of him. Both Doctor Banner and his papa are frowning at him.
“I figured you’d want your sweatshirt back. I’m sorry for taking it,” Steve says and hands the article of clothing back to its owner.
“Yeah. I didn’t sleep either.”
Steve studies himself in the mirror and tries not to frown at the reflection staring back at him. The bruises have begun to fade and the cuts along his face appear to be healing nicely. The physical damage might be gone but the mental and emotional abuse was still there.
The doctor rushes into the room a few minutes later. Steve is suffering through another contraction by the time Bruce is prepared and coming over to assist.
He understands now what his body is trying to tell him. He’s going into a rut. He can’t remember the last time he’s even had one. Between running a successful company and creating new tech, it made sense that his cycle would be off. And if he did have one, it was always spent locked away in his penthouse. Spending ruts alone was not ideal, but it wasn’t like Tony had a mate to share it with. He was a busy man. He didn’t have time to settle down.
But when he opens the door, he doesn’t find his friends. Tony Stark is standing in the hall.
The rest of the appointment passes with ease. The baby’s development is on the right track and Tony’s healthy. Doctor Patterson congratulates them and leaves the room to retrieve the pictures she printed for them.
, he tells himself.
“Come on,” Steve urges softly, carefully adjusting his son and bringing him closer to his chest. Another whimper is made until finally the baby is latching onto Steve’s offered nipple. Steve smiles down at his son. “There you go.”
“I know,” Tony says soothingly. He cradles Peter’s head close. “I’m sorry, kiddo. I’m so sorry.”
“Yes!” Sam cheers and brings Bucky back into his arms, smothering him with kisses. “We’re having Little Sammy!”
“I hope you don’t mind the color scheme,” Tony says, a small smile forming over his face. “Red and blue just made the most sense. I did add some white in the eyes so I guess you are sort of wearing the same colors as Steve.”
Sleeping is still something he found himself struggling with, but being near Steve helped. Lately, he found himself curled up against the omega more than usual. Steve’s nightmares were still a thing, and though they hadn’t been as intense as past ones, he still required Tony’s comforting scent to calm him.
Peter rises to his feet and grabs his backpack. “I have school soon so…”
“It’s okay. I love you so much.”
“I thought it was the start of another joke,” Steve huffs out a small laugh. The smile on his face falters, twisting into a look of agony. He lets out a groan and tips his head back against the pillow, blowing out a breath when the contraction peaks. A moment of silence passes between them before Steve lifts his head and offers a small, but reassuring grin. “I’m okay. It wasn’t too bad.”
That wasn’t him anymore. He was stronger now. But his size was intimidating to most alphas. If it weren’t for his sweet scent, anyone would assume he was an alpha. He wishes now that he had been born one.
“Dammit!” Tony curses suddenly, the sound of his outburst grabbing Steve’s attention. Steve whips his head around, frowning at the disgruntled expression on Tony’s face.
I’m updating again...is that really a bad thing? 🤔 I swear I’ll update other stories. This chapter just got finished first 😆
“What if I can’t do this? What if I can’t be a good mother to him? All the others...I failed them. All of them are gone because of me. I don’t want Pete-”
“J, run another scan,” Tony orders the A.I. and he sits back to wait for the results.
Steve screams this time, the sound painful for the alpha to hear. He’s never seen Steve in this much pain before, and he wishes there was something he could do to alleviate it.
There was still more that needed to be said, but Steve wasn’t ready to reveal everything about his past. Talking about his trauma was still too difficult. He had hoped Tony would understand and be patient, but maybe his patience was running thin. It makes Steve believe that Tony was going to throw him out onto the streets.
“Are you ready for the test? I hear the second half is pretty bad,” Ned says, completely oblivious to Peter’s strange behavior. Good. Peter doesn’t need him noticing yet.
Steve gives a small shrug in response. “It’s all right with me.”
A shy smile forms over Steve’s face and he ducks down, burying his nose in Tony’s neck. Tony holds him close and continues to run his fingers through Steve’s hair. The omega purrs happily.
“Hey, Buck,” Sam greets when he enters the apartment. Bucky looks up, a deep frown etched on his face.
“I’m really sorry,” Sara gives her condolences first. A few others do the same.
Steve is taken further into this new base, going down corridor after corridor until he’s at a metal door. The alpha on his right scans his badge and the door opens. The cell he’s thrown into is everything he was expecting. It’s dark and cramped, not a lot of room to move around. It’s cold too; Steve can’t help but shiver when his bare feet touch the floor.
His son responds with another push from his foot. It brings a smile to Steve’s face.
Pepper chuckles and wraps the tie around Tony’s neck. “So you two are good? He hasn’t been by much, or I just miss it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nope.” Steve shakes his head. “I thought I just had the flu...or drank too much.”
He wants to believe every word that came out of Steve’s mouth, but he's torn. The things Steve told him just weren’t adding up. Was Steve really abused and held captive all those years? Was he really from a different time period and frozen? Did they really meet and Tony sired the pup Steve swore was in his belly?
“Yeah!” Peter nods at the memory. “It’s so tiny like a little seed and it’s going to get bigger and bigger until it’s big enough to come out!”
The omega gasps at the unexpected voice, not realizing that he had been followed. He sniffs and wipes quickly at his eyes, not wanting Pepper to see him like this.
It was going to take a lot more to get him comfortable.
Steve scoffs. “I hope so. I don’t think I can take anymore of this.”
“Oh my God. Tony, that’s our-he’s moving!”
“But you’re not in heat and my rut-”
“He’s not,” Tony cuts him off. “This won’t be like last time.”
“Wait, you trained with him?”
Natasha’s eyes well with tears and she lets out a shaky breath. Clint squeezes her shoulder again, reminding her that he was still there. She smiles sadly up at him.
“This is all that fits! And I’m not wearing your jeans because those are too big!” Peter exclaims, on the verge of tears.
“Hey I’m not judging,” Sam holds up his hands in defense. “I think it’s awesome what you did. There needs to be more people sticking up for what’s right. You’re a hero.”
“And I like movies,” Peter says, still keeping his eyes on anything but his dad. “Papa loved them too.”
“What?” A part of Tony regrets pressing for more. He’s afraid to know what Steve is trying to say.
“Nice try. Maybe keep to the web shooting from now on.” Steve chuckles.
“Do you think he would…”
He’s no longer in bed, deciding that he’d rather walk around to get things moving along. His water had yet to break, and judging by the way his contractions were coming, he was sure it would break soon.
“How do you know that? Look what I’ve already done.”
“Honey, you feeling okay?” It’s a stupid question to ask. Of course Steve wasn’t okay. He just lost a baby.
“We both will,” Steve says and he turns back to his son, gently picking him up off the changing table. Peter doesn’t fuss or cry, completely content being in his father’s arms. Steve lays him over his shoulder, keeping one hand on Peter’s head and the other on his bottom for support.
“That’s it?” Tony points again at the blob in the center. He’s sure he’s said those two words at least five times now, but he couldn’t wrap his mind around the thought of his grandchild only being a blob. Or maybe he just couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that he was staring at a picture of his grandchild.
“You really think he would’ve pulled you away from your retirement?” Natasha asks softly. “He knew you had too much to lose.”
“He’d take it out on her?”
With a shaky breath, Peter rolls over and shuts his eyes, soft sobs ripping through him. Maybe it’s his imagination, or maybe his grief has conjured it up, but he swears he feels fingers brushing through his hair.
“So you want to live with him?” Bucky asks, and Peter peers up at him again.
“Begging doesn’t work on me,” Pierce sneers. “It never has.”
He’s back in the dark bedroom with Tony sleeping beside him. Steve sneaks a peek in his mate’s direction, relief washing over him when he finds Tony’s face clear of any damage. It had just been another nightmare.
Tony snorts and shakes his head. “Count me out. I’m done.”
“Thank you,” he replies, making sure his voice sounds wounded. He could stop wearing the fake smile now.
At those words, Steve’s eyes are shooting open and he sits up. “Why? What’s wrong?”
Tony sighs. “I’m sorry for how I acted. I shouldn’t have yelled.”
“Tony!” Steve doesn’t mean to cry out the name, but the contraction has worsened, along with the pressure deep in his pelvis. He feels the baby drop and he groans. “Tony, where are you?”
“How come the baby died?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers, eyes growing misty all over again.
Nothing. Not a single word. There’s no missed calls, voicemails, emails. Nothing from Tony. He didn’t even have the decency to reply to the letter.
“Hell yeah! Uh...I mean...yes, sir.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Peter quickly replies and sniffs. He hopes his eyes aren’t red. “I’m good. Real good. Never...never better.”
Steve turns his head, and that’s when blue eyes connect with brown. “P-Pete…”
He reaches into his phone and quickly types out a message.
“He’s harmless. Trust me. But thanks anyway. Now one more thing...can you get some donuts?”
“Oh. Um it’s Rogers.”
At the end of the service, the flag is neatly folded up and given to Peter. He nods at the soldier who presents it to him, and more tears run down his face. He takes a breath to calm himself, hating how shaky it comes out.
“Like a vacation! We haven’t been to Disney World in a while.”
“Nah you love me,” Tony says and directs his attention back to the clerk. “I’ll take that one.”
“Yeah.” Tony nods with a smile. His eyes flicker in the direction of their oldest son and he stretches a hand out to softly caress Peter’s face. Peter stirs and his dark eyes flutter open.
“Wilson. I don’t want to talk about…”
After they serve their food and settle in front of the large tv screen, Happy finds the remote and searches for his favorite show.
Peter nods. He knows exactly where this is going.
Hello! I’m posting this on my lunch because I couldn’t wait until I got off work. I think this is one of the longer chapters so that’s good, right? I hope you all are doing well! And enjoy this chapter 😊
“I don’t know.” Tony shrugs and steps away from the counter to grab the jar of sauce he left on the island. “You’re giving me orders like one. Oh wait! What about...spangles? You fought for this country, right?”
Steve disappears to his room when Tony walks Bruce out. They step outside and Tony shuts the door behind him in case Steve was to hear them.
“Guess you’re tired of being in there, huh?” Steve pokes at his belly, chuckling softly when his daughter responds with a kick.
But he made a promise to his son and he was done breaking promises. Peter wanted nothing more than to have his family together while they celebrated and remembered Steve. Tony owes his son a lot. Going to a party was just part of what Tony owed him.
“Yeah…”
“I will.”
“Are you sure you’re not...I mean, you’re crying like Tony did last week when you made him a sandwich and forgot the mustard. Have you tried taking a test?”
“Wait, wait,” Steve hates to ruin their victory. “How can I be you, Pete?”
Steve chuckles and sets the bag aside with the other gifts. There’s one left for him to open. The note says it’s from both Maria Hill and Nick, but Steve knows Nick probably added his name. He’s grateful anyway when he unwraps a car seat. He wishes they had showed up to the party, but being head of SHIELD was demanding. Steve makes a mental note to send a thank you card.
Steve rolls his eyes playfully. “No. Sam’s a friend. He lost his mate.”
“Hey,” Tony’s soothing voice is what snaps Steve’s from his thoughts. The omega lifts his head to meet his alpha’s eyes. He shifts in his seat, suddenly finding the plush leather uncomfortable. Tony gives him a small smile and takes his hand, intertwining their fingers. “Talk to me. What’s going on?”
“I’ll be downstairs if you do.”
Rumlow steps toward the pair, raising his baton to issue an attack to the disobedient omega, but he’s forced to stop when his superior orders him to back down.
Happy stares at him for a moment before turning back toward the front and driving away.
Steve squirms and reaches down to where Tony has placed his hands, taking them and forcing them away. “Don’t.”
“I can help you. Just listen to me okay? Listen to me. Don’t do it. Whatever you’re planning, don’t do it. Think about Morgan. Think about her, Steve. She needs you. I need you.”
The medical wing is no foreign place to him. For years he’s found himself in this part of the building, whether that was getting stitched up from his many failed attempts at fighting back, or when it came time to check on his pups.
“I love you, Papa,” he whispers.
“Natasha is a good name too.”
“Oh lord. I’m curious.”
“I know,” Sam’s voice can be heard next. “But he left you in charge, Nat.”
Waiting for the results never fails to be a nerve-wracking experience. Steve can’t tear his eyes away from the test sitting on the countertop. His finger finds its way into his mouth and he chews away the nail. His stomach is still doing somersaults, but he knows better than to blame the feeling on a possible baby. He’s done that enough.
“I love you, too,” Steve sobs.
“But my body-”
“Yeah right now, but what about later?”
“Okay. I love you, daddy.”
“Uh huh. The Avengers did great work. You should be proud.”
“Dammit. I thought this would be it.”
“No. No absolutely not. No. I’ll handle him okay? Just keep your distance from him if you can.”
Now that’s the type of vacation he could get behind.
The plan to fight back makes Steve’s stomach churn. For years he’s been taught to never fight and to always comply. In the past he’s fought back and the results were always the same. The rough beat downs were one thing, but when Alpha punished him, that was something much, much worse. Steve didn’t want to deal with that again.
“Sort of,” he mumbles.
“Protective. Is this how you’re going to act with Little Sammy?”
“You will.”
The dressing up part was another thing Steve didn’t find amusing. He already dressed up when it came to saving the world, and there were some days when he’d prefer just normal clothes. Those damn sweaters were his addiction. The candy he enjoyed from time to time, but the one thing he couldn’t wrap his mind around were the decorations.
Steve decides to end the conversation. His eyes land on the foreign device. He knew little about the different types of technology this new world had. Being held captive for so many years kept him from learning about this generation. He was still trapped in his old life. It was simpler then. It was all he knew.
“You’ll get there someday. I promise.”
“Oh.” Steve frowns. An idea comes to mind and he smiles shyly. “What about a small party? You can have Pepper over and I’m sure Happy would like to come.”
Bruce sighs. “Is Bucky with him?”
Steve shivers at the thought of going through more training. “I’m sorry, Alpha,” he apologizes.
Tony peers up at her, immediately regretting it when he catches the scowl on her face. “Okay so lying about an engagement wasn’t the right thing to do.”
“You will and I’ll be there every step of the way.”
Steve is ready to protest, but even if he wanted to, he’d never be given the chance. His belly contracts and the urge to push can no longer be ignored. He grips the side of his seat and gives in to his body’s need, bearing down as hard as he can. His efforts pay off and more of his daughter emerges.
“Exactly! He should’ve been there!” Clint cries. “Wasn’t it his own damn weapons that made you guys go?”
Bucky glances at his husband, searching for any confirmation.
Sam sighs. “No he’s not.”
Steve rolls his eyes and quickly ushers his son’s to finish eating. Once their plates are empty, both boys are rushing upstairs to brush their teeth. Steve knows he’ll have to help them otherwise toothpaste will end up on the sink and not their mouths.
Tony makes a face at those words. Weekly visits weren't enough.
“Thank you, Jarvis. I guess I need a name for him, huh?”
The first time Steve meets Sam Wilson is fifteen minutes before his therapy group is supposed to start. Being punctual had always been one of Steve’s strengths. Maybe it was from his time in the army or because at a young age his mother made sure to teach him the importance of showing up in a timely manner.
“Not good. Do I take him to a hospital? Tony, what the hell do I do!”
“I...I don’t know.”
Tony sighs. “Yeah, I guess so. Do you really think I could be a dad? I mean, you know how screwed up I am.”
“Mama!” James pats the spot next to him. Steve doesn’t even hesitate to sit down.
“Come on it won’t kill you.”
Bucky grumbles some kind of response Sam can’t decipher. He ignores it, knowing his husband’s mood was excusable. Bucky had every right to be upset. Steve’s death was still fresh.
“No!” Steve screams, reaching out to take his pup back. He’s slapped again, this time harder than before. He grabs his cheek and peers up at the alpha with tear filled eyes.
Peter stands awkwardly in the kitchen, sneaking a glance in papa’s direction and not missing the scowl that’s on his face.
They were supposed to be taking care of their son together, and though that plan had been working out initially, Tony’s honestly not sure how it was going to work now after their recent argument. Tony was willing to take the blame for the fight. He had been the one to upset Steve.
“Not your fault.” Steve sniffs and wipes again at the tears that continue to roll down his cheeks. Tony frowns and scoots closer until their knees brush together. Steve doesn’t flinch this time.
“Don’t worry,” Tony says when he senses Steve’s hesitation. “She’s in good hands.”
Yeah that’s all I’m gonna say.
“Tony, I don’t do this anymore.”
It shouldn’t bother him as much as it should. Those feelings he had for Tony never went away. It’s pathetic for him to continue to hold onto something he knew was never going to become a reality. Tony clearly moved on, and it was time Steve did the same.
“Are you sure you’re ready? You could always wait until next week,” Natasha tells him.
“Yeah but isn’t it like your job to make all the choices? And even if I do suggest something you’ll probably do something else!”
The penthouse no longer resembled its past self. It was usually kept pretty tidy, mostly due to the fact that Tony practically lived in his lab. He had gotten better at returning to his home to eat, shower, maybe sleep if he felt the urge, but ever since he asked Steve to move in with him, the space was drastically changing.
Thank you guys for a wonderful response to the first chapter! I hope you all are liking this so far!
“No,” Steve says with a shake of his head. “I wasn’t expecting-sorry, I’m ruining this.”
It’s at that moment when the pups rush toward them, wanting to show their parents just how happy they were. Steve takes Peter into his arms, hugging the little pup and kissing his cheek. Sarah runs to Tony, giggling when he scoops her up.
“Nuh-Uh,” Peter holds up his fist, ready to block any of her attacks.
“Rude. He already wants to leave us,” Sam jokes, then he waves Peter away. “Get out of here.”
“I know you can be a good dad. Just be careful with him. He’s sensitive.”
Tony snorts.
Steve’s eyes burn with tears and he has to squeeze them shut to prevent them from spilling. He doesn’t say anymore, knowing there was no point. Tony wasn’t going to change his mind.
Brock Rumlow and Jack Rollins. The two were always assigned to retrieve him. It was their special orders to make sure he was kept in check. They were the most respected among the team. They were Alpha’s right hand men.
“Let’s try one more time. And if it doesn’t work then…” Tony trails off. He takes a second to reply, almost as if he’s unsure about his response. “Then I’ll do it. I’ll carry the baby.”
Tony takes control again and their lips meet in another heated kiss. Tony doesn’t waste anymore time, knowing they were already pushing it. Sooner or later someone was going to look for them.
“Okay!” Peter cries out and covers his ears. “Stop! Can I go now?”
Tony nods in agreement. “It’s good for the baby.”
At the sight of another alpha, Tony stands up straighter and puffs his chest out to make himself appear more intimidating. Though it was hard to say if it was working when he was pushing a stroller, and had a fruit loop stuck to his pants. Steve chuckles softly and swoops in to help, picking off the dried cereal and kissing his mate on the cheek.
It only takes a few days for the envelope to arrive at the mansion. Tony disregards the rest of the mail that Pepper has forwarded to him, his eagerness to rip into the manila envelope too difficult to ignore. He sneaks away downstairs to his lab, far away from Steve for the big reveal.
But it was all a lie. Tony didn’t care. And Steve so badly wanted to have the same attitude, but he wasn’t like Tony. He might deny around his friends that there weren't any romantic feelings involved, but that was far from the truth. Steve did feel something.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers. The tears are rolling freely down his face now. He looks broken again, nothing at all like he had been around their friends. He had been wearing a mask then and he’d probably continue to wear it until he was strong enough to remove it for good.
This time Tony does cringe and he takes another drink, chugging down the rest of the alcohol. He didn’t understand how this poor kid could look up to him. He wasn’t anything special. He was the world’s biggest screw up.
“Help me do what? Raise it? I can’t have a baby, Ned! I’ve already made up my mind.”
“You’re fine,” Tony assures as they browse through the store. “Honestly, I don’t even know why you wear this getup.“
“-but the team is on their way back and-”
“Tony, he’s going through a lot. He just had a baby. You can’t expect him to bounce right back.”
Tony huffs out a laugh. “I knew deep down you loved them.”
Peter stirs when he’s laid down and Tony quietly shushes him and runs a finger along his cheek. It helps calm him down, and soon Peter is back asleep.
Their lives were changed forever.
“Damn,” Bucky sighs and places one hand over Steve’s shoulder. Steve already knows his friend can see right through him. Bucky was always great at reading him when everyone else failed. “Hey, Steve, it’s okay.”
Steve nods, liking the idea of having his doctor around. The last doctor he had experienced was no good, only caring about the future of Hydra and not that of the pup Steve was forced to bear. Not once did the doctor show him any remorse when his pup died, nor did he stop when Steve begged him not to take another away.
Tony makes a face. “Don’t remind me. It’s fine. And if it doesn’t go away by tomorrow then I’ll take a test.”
“Speaking of sleep…” Tony lets out a yawn. The exhaustion has finally caught up to him. He stretches his arms over his head, groaning softly when his back and shoulders pop. “Maybe we should actually sleep now.”
“He’d never let me-”
The moment he’s pointed out the life growing inside of him, his whole world shifts into focus. For once he’s not thinking about Tony and wishing for him to come back. All he could think about was his baby. The little life he was blessed to love and care for.
“I-Tony, I know. I never said-”
Tony sits up quickly, a hopeful look appearing over his face. “Can...am I allowed…”
It’s Peter who decides when it’s time for them to go. He wakes up from his nap, small but irritable whimpers escaping him. Steve gets to him first, releasing one arm around Sarah to reach down and place the pacifier back into his son’s mouth. Peter spits it out and cries, his tiny legs kicking off the blanket Tony had placed over him.
“Don’t worry.” Tony pats Peter on the shoulder in an attempt of reassurance. “If you can fend off thugs and save cats from trees then you can watch my daughter.”
“Yeah. I know what you mean. But you’re...you don’t have those days now, do you?”
Peter hits the training mat with a small grunt. He props himself up on his elbows, connecting his eyes with his aunt’s. He doesn’t miss the mischievous glint in them or the smug look on her face. She’s barely broken a sweat; her red hair is still neat and her face free of any sheen. He can only imagine himself right now; hair tousled, sweat dripping from his brow and panting heavily on the mat beneath him.
“N-no. Ned and I have to study for a test and…”
“I know. But it’s over now. He’s gone. He’s gone for good. He can’t hurt us anymore.”
“This one is from me.” Natasha smiles when she hands Steve the next present.
Tony waits outside the room, his right leg bouncing nervously and his eyes glued to the door a few feet away from him. He hasn’t been able to tear his gaze away since he was first asked to wait outside. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t hurt that Steve suggested he wait outside of the room. Tony gave Steve the space he wanted, but there was a part of him that wished Steve would have granted him access.
They don’t talk much after that. After crawling into bed and snuggling up against his alpha, Steve is on the verge of passing out. He tries to keep his eyes open a little longer, but the comfort Tony naturally brings is what eventually lulls Steve to sleep.
“Call Tony anyway.” Happy reaches into his pocket and hands Steve the black phone.
“I’ve touched you before,” Steve says, his voice quiet. “I wasn’t sure if I’d get to do it again.”
“Who? Our son?”
Tony leaves, slamming the door hard on his way out.
“I’m sorry, kid. I won’t ask again.”
“Can I go now?” Peter asks, beginning to rise to his feet. “I want to see my dad and tell him.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony assures. “It’s just Happy.”
Tony fights against the anger. Steve was happy now. That’s all that matters.
A shaky breath leaves him when he steps inside. He glances toward the kitchen, remembering all the meals they prepared together. A lot of the time it failed, but it didn’t matter because it was a chance for them to be together and have fun.
He should have some kind of award by now for how many people he’s pushed away. Maybe get put in the Guinness World Record book or something. It seemed like the only good thing he was good at these days was shoving people away and closing the door, locking it tight for extra measure.
This chapter focuses more on Tony and his grief, but I swear after this it will be focusing more on him and his relationship with Peter. They have a lot of work.
Steve curses quietly to himself and hangs his head between his shoulders, eyes burning with the tears that threaten to fall. He grips the edge of the countertop to steady himself when he sways. He glances toward his right, settling his eyes on the plastic stick he had just peed on.
Steve pushes forward like he does best. He focuses on the team and building them up to what they need to be. He continues to fight and save the world as the fearless Captain. Tony Stark isn’t on his mind as much anymore.
“Just do it. He’s harmless. Look at him. Do you think I’d have any trouble with him? Come on, let him go.”
Tony nods. He just needs to lie down for a bit. Maybe take an aspirin or two. He’ll be fine in the morning.
There’s still something off about the situation that Tony can’t place. It didn’t make sense for him to accept Alexander’s help when he barely even knew the man. Happy and Pepper was his go to people. He trusted them before anyone else.
Sam had been recruited to help with their latest mission after Steve met him working as a SHIELD agent. Taking down Hydra wasn’t a simple task and Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t thankful for the extra person on their side. The reward had its gains, stopping a Nazi cult was one of them, but for Steve, the biggest gain was getting his best friend back.
Harley was the same way. He could walk on his own, but he too struggled to form words and communicate properly. The pups were going to need a lot of love, care, and therapy. Steve would be there for them every step of the way.
“I’m not leaving you,” Natasha repeats.
“Then why did you agree to do it?”
“Don’t worry,” Tony assures and he leans over to press a kiss to Steve’s head.
He shouldn’t be nervous, but it was difficult to shake the uneasy energy coursing through him. This hadn’t been the first time Steve’s felt like this. The butterflies have swarmed in his belly before. It’s happened before missions and a few times in his personal life. Meeting Tony had been one of those instances, and again when Steve took his last name and promised to spend the rest of this life and the next with Tony.
“Why are you making this so difficult? Just do what you have to do to-”
After that cringeworthy dinner, they were surprisingly growing closer instead of further apart. Flash still kept a distance when he was with his buddies, but when he could get away, he would always seek Peter out and ask about the baby. Peter liked the new side of Flash. Maybe he wasn’t a bad guy after all.
He would be lying if he said his curiosity wasn’t piqued. He often wondered what this new world was like and if he’d ever find his place in it. A part of him wants to explore it with Tony by his side, but the voice in the back of his mind reminds him of the danger lurking outside. Alpha would stop at nothing to get him.
“Which one? You have a lot of parties?”
“Look at me, baby,” Steve says. He recognizes the same scared look in Peter’s eyes that he had seen in his own. He too had been terrified when he found he was pregnant. “Pete, we’re going to help you.”
“Hey,” he says soothingly and reaches for Tony’s free hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. “I’m sorry our shopping trip didn’t go so well.”
“I know.” Tony cradles Steve’s head and runs his fingers through his hair. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. I wish I could make you feel better.”
It was too much to take in, and though a part of Steve wants to panic, the other half is encouraging him to cradle the baby close and comfort him. He follows through with his instincts, bringing the baby closer to his chest.
“That’s his room. No one goes in there,” Peter explains. And just like that, his smile was gone and replaced with tears.
Steve sits back down and takes Tony's hand again. “Get some rest. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
“Papa,” Peter groans. “I’ve heard this.”
That all changed when he got the serum and then met and fell in love with Tony. Steve held onto that hope that one day their little family of two would become three or four. Steve wanted a big family, and for the longest time he was sure he would get it.
Tony pulls Happy aside until they’re further away from Steve but still nearby if the omega needed him. One glance toward the living room shows Steve still curled up on the sofa and oblivious to the rest of the world. Tony has never seen him so scared.
“I promise.”
“That was weird,” Bucky is the first to say.
Tony reaches down to cup the baby’s head in his palm. He doesn’t see the cord wrapped around its neck and he’s able to relax. But whatever calmness he feels is quickly disappearing when Steve lets out another scream. It’s painful to both hear and witness.
He makes a special trip to Brooklyn, lying to Pepper and claiming it was for a visit to a possible location to expand his company.
“Yep.”
“It’s just...Mr. Stark, I’ve never babysat a baby before. Like a baby baby. She’s so tiny and-”
It’s not long until Steve has all the ingredients needed for the pancakes laid out on the kitchen counter. Peter is right beside him, standing on his Mickey Mouse step stool and waiting for permission to put the chocolate chips into the batter Steve has just finished making.
Thank you guys for being so patient with me! I've been struggling with a lot of my stories lately, but I'm starting to get ideas for them now and this one I really want to finish. There's not too many fics with this kind of subject. At least I haven't come across very many. Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this chapter!
Steve brings the sweatshirt up to his nose, inhaling the familiar scent. He keens at the smell and sniffs again. The fabric is soft against his skin, and he can only imagine what it would feel like to wear. A thought crosses his mind.
“Tony?” Steve’s questioning tone is what snaps Tony from his thoughts, and he directs his gaze on Steve. “Talk to me. What’s wrong?”
“If he’s okay then why do you look so…”
Pepper was a little easier to warm up to. She had been nice the first time they met, but their brief interaction wasn’t enough for Steve to consider them friends. It was nice having another omega around and one like Pepper. She was smart, strong and independent; nothing at all like the omega’s Steve was used to. But times were different now and omega’s could be whatever they wanted to be.
The bedroom door is wide open, giving Steve a perfect view of a very irritated Tony. Steve can’t help but smirk to himself and lean against the doorframe to watch the scene a little longer. Tony is clearly struggling with his jeans, huffing and puffing as he fights with the little button that never used to give him problems before.
Bucky isn’t convinced. “Hold on.”
“Yeah. I guess we better go. I’m sorry for waking you.”
“It kind of sounds like a big deal. Has he said anything about what he wants to do?”
Tony rolls his eyes and slips the number the omega gave him into his suit pocket. “I can actually. And what happened back there was harmless fun.”
“I guess. Does it matter if I’m not keeping it?”
Steve rolls his eyes and tries to push Tony away, but the alpha just brings him right back and gently kisses him on the lips.
“It was before Steve-that mission,” Bucky says, his voice thick and eyes growing misty. He sniffs before continuing, “I didn’t know how to say it. And then we lost Steve and I just couldn’t.”
He hates the cheery atmosphere and the smiles on the staff they pass by. He hates that this was where Steve was going to be for the next few weeks. He hates that this is what their talk led to. It wasn’t fair.
“It is! How can you just stand there and not be affected? It’s killing me that he’s gone and I don’t know what to do.”
Steve knows she means to make up for not only waking up Peter, but because of Tony’s visit. There was nothing that was truly going to take away the hurt, but it was nice having her by his side. She could numb the pain, at least for a while.
Peter nods. “Yes.”
Tony smiles into the kiss. “I may or may not have done that on purpose,” he confesses once they break apart.
“I am taking this seriously. Why do we have to do this now? I’m starving and you promised lunch!”
“No.” The response comes faster than Steve would’ve liked. It shocks Tony if the look on his face is anything to go by. “I mean...I’m not. Come on, Tony, we’ve been through this,” Steve says.
“Yep. This was a little...weird. Maybe tomorrow will be better.” Tony gives a nonchalant shrug.
It takes a moment for them to recover, then they’re switching roles. Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t nervous. It’s been a while since he found himself on all fours with his ass presented.
“He would hurt me,” Steve whispers. “More than just the bruises you saw.”
“Children?”
“There’s more to parenthood, Tony. There’s the hugs and the kisses, the way they smile at you and tell you how much they love you. You’d be their hero.”
Tony smirks and brings Steve in for another kiss.
“Tired, mostly. Almost there.”
Steve wasn’t perfect, he knew this, but he couldn’t help but want a perfect evening. He prepared Tony’s favorite dish and brought out the good bottle of wine. Dessert was planned for later, and that was something that definitely couldn’t falter. It’s been too long since they’ve been able to do anything like this.
“Good! Tell Tony-”
“Hmm.” Steve frowns as he makes his way over to his son’s closet and begins going through the clothing. “And these don’t fit?” Steve holds up another pair and Peter shakes his head.
. Remember that voice? It’s a liar. Don’t listen. Just listen to me.”
He can end it all. No more pain. No more suffering. It would all be gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you sure?” Steve asks and Peter nods again. “Okay. But call me if you feel worse.”
Peter is laid down in the bassinet and Steve crawls into Tony’s large bed, scooting closer toward edge so that he can lean over and brush his fingers along Peter’s face.
The elevator arrives and the doors open. Tony’s hope of being alone is crushed and he aims at the gun at the three alpha’s inside. They do the same.
Tony decides to go first. “You had a baby.”
It strikes fear in him. They must know who he is and what he can do. Hydra had wanted to use him and perhaps SHIELD had similar agendas.
The nurse is coming back, and for a moment Steve fears she’s going to take the baby away and place him back in the incubator, but instead she’s coming over to assist with feeding.
“Steve,” Tony says softly, reaching out with his free hand to take Steve’s. “Honey, I’m sorry.”
Steve lets out a shaky breath when the tears roll down his face. “I need help. I guess I thought the group and the pills were enough but...they’re not.”
Peter is fast asleep the moment Steve lays him down. He lingers nearby, watching his son sleep, his eyes glued to the soft rising and falling of Peter’s little chest.
This is such a mess and poor Steve is so broken and Tony feels so guilty and awful. They’re going to talk some more in the next chapter. And I’ll bring in another character. Steve needs to find out how his baby’s doing.
“I don’t want a baby.”
“I didn’t want a baby. I knew I couldn’t be a good father.”
“Big. They miss you,” Steve replies as he gathers up his notebook. “I swear I’m going to invite you over. It’s just with the move and unpacking.”
“Really?”
“Actually,” Tony starts and he reaches into one of the bags and pulls out a twelve inch red plastic devil with black horns. “Here’s the devil and he’s going to look cute on our front door.”
“We all know you did.”
“Can I say something without you getting upset?” Pepper asks. Tony can’t help but roll his eyes. He’s probably going to get upset.
“Peter Benjamin Rogers. It’s cute.”
“Better?” Steve asks once Tony has been administered the drugs. Tony hums in response, a smile forming over his face.
“Tony, it’s not like that,” Steve repeats. “I tried to tell you. The phone calls and letters-”
Steve grips the knife tightly, his fingers growing white from how hard he’s squeezing the handle. Just one plunge into the alpha’s back would end him and Steve would be free for good.
“Well don’t bother.” Flash rises to his feet and heads toward the door, stretching a hand out for the handle. The door opens suddenly and he jumps back, eyes wide in surprise.
“Not happening.”
Tony sighs. “I didn’t know some of them were still out there. If there’s anymore-”
He can no longer take being away from his family and he makes his way inside. The first thing he notices is the silence. Steve can’t help but frown from it. Usually someone was still up and making some kind of sound. But there’s nothing. Almost as if no one was home.
“She’s not yours to keep, Omega. Haven’t you learned by now? They don’t belong to you.” The alpha directs his gaze back on the newborn in his arms, a sad sigh escaping him. “It’s a real shame this one didn’t work out.”
Natasha scowls and folds her arms over her chest, unable to find the apology good enough.
“Yeah,” Peter nods and sends her a small smile, “I’m starving.”
The lock on the door breaks through the quiet, forcing Tony to lift his head in its direction. He prays they’re not back to inflict more damage. He had been promised death, and if it meant them leaving Steve alone for a while, then Tony would take it.
“I know, I know. I’m sorry. We can reschedule and I’ll deal with the board and meet the interns. It’s just that guy-”
“You honestly trust him? He snuck out the last time we left!”
“I swear to God if he comes back I’ll kill him.” Bucky is seething.
“Shit! Okay. Um...I can do it in five minutes?”
Steve nods and holds his daughter close, placing a kiss to her soft blond hair. She’s already dozing off, bright eyes threatening to fall shut. Steve kisses her again before handing her off to Tony so that he can kiss his son’s goodnight.
“I know.”
“Me? I was far from it. Getting into fights all the time with alphas twice my size. Yeah, perfect kid.”
Peter forces himself to glance up at the poster, and that’s when he makes his decision. He jumps up from his seat and rushes toward the exit, muttering a ‘sorry’ on his way out.
“Well that’s what I’m supposed to be doing, right? I mean it’s all my fault Steve is dead.”
“Not really. The first night without you was the worst, but we’re getting better.”
“Speaking of...since you’re stepping down...you don’t really need a bodyguard.”
The urge to drink only increases and for a second he considers giving in and following through. But just in the nick of time, Pepper saves him.
“Because you have nowhere to go. And I don’t think you want to go back to your alpha.”
He tries to follow the nightly routine by starting off with a warm bath. Morgan fought and screamed through the whole thing, not once finding any comfort in the soothing water and mild lavender scents. Getting her dried and dressed seemed to only upset her even more.
Tony doesn’t respond and he curls up around his new favorite pillow. It’s not long before his eyes are falling shut and the room fills with the sound of his soft snoring. Steve smiles and reaches over the pillow to get to Tony’s hand, taking it in his own and smoothing his thumb over Tony’s knuckles.
Tony blows out a breath. “What do I do? I can’t do this, Pep. I don’t know how to be a father. I can’t be…I’m not Steve.”
Tony turns his head in Steve’s direction and they share a smile. Steve presses his lips to Tony’s temple. “Thank you,” he whispers.
“Yeah.”
Steve wanted to be there for that. He wanted to see his son graduate high school and then college. Meet someone and fall in love; start a family and be happy with the life he’s created.
“Something happened. He’s scared.”
“It’s fine,” the omega chuckles. “I’ve seen worse. At least you’re dressed. The others have been...well, you can imagine. I see he let you borrow his old MIT sweatshirt. You must be special.”
Tony straightens his tie for the tenth time before giving up and letting it hang around his neck with a muttered curse. His stomach churns and his palms grow sweaty at the thought of having to attend a party. He usually wasn’t this nervous when it came to events, but this party stood out among all the rest. This was Steve’s birthday party.
“I’m sorry! I didn’t think he’d give in so easily! We didn’t do anything bad.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bruce frowns. “Two weeks? Four?”
“Okay. I better head over to my place and shower.”
And yet he hates himself.
“Mama, he-” Peter starts only for Steve to cut in.
“Alexander Pierce. That’s the alpha.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky side eyes his nephew and then settles his fiery gaze back on Tony. He exhales sharply and the fist he has wrapped around Tony’s shirt loosens. Tony’s chest is rising and falling rapidly; his heart is close to bursting from how hard it’s pounding.
His fingers drum nervously on the wheel of his Audi R8. He had purposely told Happy not to bother being his chauffeur today. His friend had been hesitant to leave Tony alone, but Tony was quick to assure him. Peter was just a kid. Not scary whatsoever. But in reality he was the most terrifying person to walk into Tony’s life.
They don’t say anything, and even if they did, Tony doesn’t stick around to hear it. He needs to be with Steve.
Peter does as he’s told. “Nothing’s happening-wait, is this like some kind of VR?”
“I didn’t have a choice. I’m sorry for leaving but you were-Steve, don’t go.” Tony knows his attempts at making Steve stay wasn’t going to work, but he had to do something.
“No. No, Steve, no.” Tony drops down to his knees besides Steve’s limp body, taking him into his arms and cradling him close. He quickly checks for a pulse, panicking when he can’t find one. “No. No, Steve, don’t do this. Don’t leave me.”
Don’t worry I’m not that evil! 😉
“I love you, daddy,” Harley says and places a big, wet kiss to Tony’s cheek.
Steve sees nothing but red. He grips the alpha tightly and forces him toward the bench. He manipulates Pierce in the humiliating position he had been forced into multiple times.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t like your ideas,” Happy states.
Bruce finishes up the exam and hands Steve some paper towels to clean off the gel. Tony moves quickly to Bruce’s side, leaning in again to whisper something into his ear.
It’s tempting to expose Steve’s neck and place the mark, but Tony holds back. He doesn’t even know if Steve would want him that way. They might be having a baby, but Steve didn’t give permission for them to bond. Steve’s lost so much already. Tony didn’t want to take away something else.
Steve can only nod his head in response. He wants more and as if Tony can read his mind, the rest of the finger slides it, pulling a groan from Steve’s lips. Tony takes his time, not wanting to hurt his boyfriend in any way. He adds more lube and another finger, stretching Steve out and exploring his velvety walls. He’s searching for a particular spot and he knows he’s found it when Steve’s back arches off the bed and he cries out.
“Yeah. Guess it is.”
“Can you please come back to the party? Papa wouldn’t want you down here by yourself.”
Peter rushes into the elevator and presses the button for the first floor. The doors close and the car begins to descend to its destination. Peter leans back against the wall and runs a hand through his hair, tugging on it harshly when his eyes burn with tears.
His eyes burn with tears and he blows out a breath to calm himself, not wanting to give into the pain. He needed to be strong. He needed to pick himself up and keep fighting.
“No more yelling?”
Steve doesn’t even protest and he takes the muffin back into his hand, only to not eat it. He picks at the top before deciding it must not be appetizing and he sets it back down on the table.
“He’s at home,” Tony finally replies to the question. He lays Morgan over his shoulder, one hand supporting her tiny head and the other her bottom. She’s still whimpering. “Shh, it’s okay, sweetheart. You’re okay now.”
“I miss home. I miss you and Morgan and all of our friends. But I know this is good for me, for us. It’s just a lot harder than I thought it was going to be,” Steve admits.
“You’re...pregnant?” Tony says, his brows furrowing even more than they already were. Steve nods, his smile widening and his eyes lighting up. Fuck. Tony has never seen him so happy.
“Aren’t those jeans great?” Tony chuckles, ignoring the glare he receives from his husband.
“Shit.”
It never comes, and instead he’s forcefully brought to his feet and pressed against the wall. His arms are pulled behind his back and his hands are tied. He doesn’t bother trying to test out the strength of the restraints. He knew better than to escape.
Steve continues to go ignored. Alpha is ordering the other two to come closer and they force Steve to his feet.
“I know. I still love you.”
“C-can’t. I have to push.” Steve announces and he brings his chin down to his chest, pushing as hard as he can. The pressure is replaced by a fiery burn and Steve throws his head back with a scream. The stretch comes next and he reaches down between his legs, fingers brushing against wet, sticky hair. “Oh my God! She’s coming!”
“Never say never.”
“Can I really do this?” Steve finds himself asking.
“I’m here for my son.”
“Another?”
“Tony-”
“You don’t seem like you do.”
“You drank!” Peter cries.
Peter is curled up on the sofa, fast asleep and snoring softly. Tony peers up from the designs he’s been making for Peter’s suits. The video has stopped playing now and Jarvis hasn’t made an attempt to play it again. Tony abandons his work to clean up the bit of takeout he ordered for them and then to set up Peter’s room.
Sam nods and takes another drink from his beer. “We’ll discuss it later. All of us.”
The begging is too difficult to ignore. It pleases him.
Steve snaps his head up at the sound of the familiar voice, finding Natasha standing near the sofa with her arms folded and an amused grin on her face.
Steve lays his head over the bump, smiling at the thought of his son. He flinches when fingers run through his hair and he peers up to find brown eyes staring down at him.
“I suppose I don’t understand the part where you lock yourself away for days with barely any food or water while an omega that cares about you very much is left in the dark.”
Tony grins to himself and finally does what his boyfriend is begging him to do. He works Steve’s pants open and slides them down his legs along with his underwear. His cock springs free, hard and already leaking at the tip.
Steve releases a choked sob. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. This isn’t me, Tony. This isn’t me.”
Steve shakes his head. “No. We met.”
“I don’t know. Two Avengers shopping for baby stuff is going to draw a lot of attention.”
“You’re nothing without me. I’m your alpha.”
And I’m not saying Steve is innocent because he was involved too. He got screwed over yeah but in the end is was miscommunication from both of them.
He lies in bed, mind racing and playing back that horrible night. No matter how much he tries to think of the happy times, he’s left to relive the time his world changed forever.
“Okay,” Steve takes a moment to think it over. It would be easier and not as overwhelming. “You’ll be there, right? I won’t be alone?”
“I’ll miss her, too. But I’m allowed weekly visits.”
Steve picks up the book again and skims through it, determined to find a name for his son before the exhaustion fully kicks in. It’s beginning to look like he’d have to figure out a name in the morning, but then he finds a name.
It’s near his 16th birthday when Peter’s life changes again. To say he’s confused about his Uncle Sam dragging him away for a special meeting would be an understatement. Peter’s never been more confused and nervous in his whole life.
Weeks pass and still nothing regarding marriage pops up. Steve hadn’t even told their friends that a future wedding was on the horizon. They still asked and prodded for information. Steve didn’t blame them for being so curious.
“Did you...love him?” Peter asks. He’s ready to backpedal and ask about something else. It was already difficult for his dad to talk about his papa. “Sorry...you don’t have to say.”
Tony takes their glasses and sets them down, then he takes Steve’s hand and leads him out of the penthouse.
“He’s beautiful, Tony.” Steve smiles, his own tears of joy are rolling down his face. He leans forward to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “You did so good.”
“We weren’t that much older than him. I remember feeling the same way he does. You too.”
Tony relaxes but keeps his hands over Steve’s shoulders, needing to feel him there. “It’s not too bad,” he says. “I’m glad I can’t really feel it.”
“You’re not going to lose me. I promise,” Sam assures.
Tony keeps his sunglasses in place, even if it’s considered too dark to have them on. The sun was setting, painting the sky in pretty pinks and purples. Only there was nothing appealing about it. It was hard to find beauty in the world when his didn’t make sense anymore.
“We’re still here, Cap. If it becomes too much then turn to us. If you want me to track him down and kick his ass I’ll do it.”
The elevator he’s forced into is cramped and the musky smell the alphas give off waft through the air, making his nose wrinkle. He was used to alpha scents, having worked with a few in the past, but those didn’t compare to the ones he’s forced to inhale now. They weren’t the good ones, like Steve liked to say, and their scent was proof of that.
Steve comes over and kneels down so he’s at level with his son and lifts the helmet up, revealing the brown eyes he fell in love with since the moment they opened for the first time.
“Then we’ll meet in the middle and get some alpacas.”
“And our country’s.”
“What would happen if you didn’t?”
“You are.”
The figure tied to the bench captures Tony’s attention again and he finds himself moving toward him. From where Tony’s standing, the man resembles that of an alpha. His strong, muscular build is what makes Tony assume the man’s secondary gender. But the sweet smell wafting around the room can only be one thing: an omega in heat.
He wasn’t like Hydra.
“I’m Peter-”
Peter sighs. “I’m just curious about him, that’s all.”
The group chuckles and Steve smiles.
“Yeah,” Steve chuckles. “It does get pretty tiring.”
“Tony...move.”
Sam places a hand over Peter’s shoulder. “It’ll get better. I wish I could say tomorrow or next week, but it will get easier. He wants you to be happy. It’s all he’s ever wanted.”
“It’s a long and I mean
“I’m only looking out for your well-being, sir.”
“Yeah.” Steve nods and he passes Natasha the car seat. “She already ate and she’s clean. If you need anything Tony will-”
“You thought what! That you would take that away? You know that’s our time together. You know feeding her was my thing, Tony! Mine!”
Sam places his hands over Peter’s eyes and leads him a few steps until they’re stopping and he’s removing his hands. Peter gasps at the suit made just for him.
The teen grows silent and his brows pinch together in confusion. “How do you-”
“It’s okay. You’re here now. Better late than never.”
“Shit.”
Steve releases her instantly. “Where the hell have you been? I’ve called you, your dad’s called you. Peter went looking for you-”
“What did he say?” Happy asks.
Steve chuckles. “You and Sam are both his godfathers.”
“Shut up.” Natasha warns him, then she’s coming over to get a closer look at the new babies. She coos softly. “They’re so beautiful. Can I hold one?”
“Happy almost hit him!” Pepper exclaims.
Steve takes a deep breath and glances up at the doctor, meeting his gaze for a moment before looking back down and fiddling with his hands.
“Thank you. I promise. I’m done avoiding this place.”
Tony shrugs and sits down on the sofa. “You can sit. I won’t bite.”
“It’s not his baby.”
“Pop!”
“He has.”
“Tony, getting him help isn’t messing anything up. It’s you caring about him and his well-being. I’d talk to him.”
He sighs in defeat. “Okay.”
Peter does as he’s told, no longer nervous or worried about somehow damaging the expensive piece of furniture. He plops down with a tired sigh, happy to sit down and catch his breath from all the swinging he had to do to get here.
“Come on, Steve who are we kidding? There’s a reason you’re the one carrying the baby. I’m too old for this and maybe-”
“It’s not. I want to make this good for you. I know the others…”
Realization hits.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “Yeah I guess so.”
“We don’t say that word,” Tony corrects the pup, “it’s a bad word okay? Little pups like you don’t say that.”
“He needed you! I needed you! All you had to do was answer the stupid phone!” Peter screams and continues to punch the suit he used to admire.
“It wasn’t just me. You wanted a family too.”
“Shh. It is. I love seeing you in my space is what I’m trying to say. I love waking up and finding you here. And pretty soon…” Tony’s hand trails down between them and rests on the growing bump. “She’ll join us.”
“Don’t sweat it,” Tony waves him off. “I don’t sleep much in here anyway. And besides, my scent is all over this place. That calms you, right? Sorry. I’m not great with omegas. Or anyone actually.”
Tony’s unsure if those two words mean anything to his son, but he’s hoping they do.
“Yeah,” Tony nods and cups Steve’s face, smoothing his thumb over the soft skin. “It’s me. It’s just me. You’re okay.”
“It’s about time he showed up,” Thor interrupts, narrowing his eyes in Tony’s direction. “It’s been how long, Stark?”
“I’m sorry. I believe you...I think.”
Tony is still hesitant to jump back into a relationship with Steve. Using their son wasn’t a good enough excuse. There’s a part of him that’s worried about starting up their relationship. The fighting was an issue, but really Tony was worried about himself. He knew how much of a handful he could be, and though Steve could handle a lot, maybe one day, Steve wouldn’t be able to handle him anymore.
“For what?”
Steve ends their embrace and gives his son a reassuring smile. “It’ll be fine, Pete. This is my last one. No more missions.”
“Stop saying that. We don’t know if he’s…like me.”
“Look!” Harley points when the screens finish booting up and reveal Tony’s latest project.
“Hey, look at me,” Tony reaches out and lifts Steve’s chin so their eyes meet. “He’s not going to find you. I won’t let him. You’re safe. You and that baby are safe. I promise.”
The small whimpers she makes begin to rise in volume and Steve brings her even closer, his instincts kicking in now that she was in his arms. He manages to slip one arm free and lift his shirt, exposing his swollen chest to her. She latches on immediately and quietly nurses.
“Hey,” Tony urges Steve to look at him and Steve turns in his arms until their eyes are meeting. “Don’t say that. The last one wasn’t your fault.”
“Listen, kid, your dad isn’t okay.”
“I was gonna get those…” Tony gestures lamely to the bags.
“Is he okay?” Steve asks.
He takes small, cautious steps toward the toilet. He already knows what he’s going to find, but it steals his breath away when he glances down in the bowl. The bloodied clump of cells will forever be burned into his mind. He wishes he didn’t have to see this; wishes he didn’t have to clean up his child’s remains. This was all wrong.
Tony is too lost in the feeling of finally being inside Steve that he doesn’t notice the lack of physical contact. He moves faster, increasing the pace and roughness of his thrusts. Steve is vocal, moans and whimpers slipping past his lips with each hard thrust. The sound only urges the alpha on.
“Hi, Maguna,” Tony croons and he brings her closer so that he can press a kiss to her head.
Then an idea comes to mind. It was worth a shot.
Tony smiles and slips the engagement ring over Steve’s finger. Tony rises to his feet and brings Steve in for a kiss.
A glimmer of fear crosses Harley’s face for a moment, then it quickly vanishes and a look of defiance returns. “No.”
“Sir,” FRIDAY’s voice reaches his ears. “Medical personnel are on the way. ETA two minutes.”
“Of course. He’s a mama’s boy.”
Sam nods. “Yeah.”
“No, nothing like that,” Tony says and Peter’s shoulders sag in disappointment. “Something...something very sad has happened....”
Tony smiles and finishes his coffee, then kisses Steve goodbye.
He’s snapped from his thoughts by the sound of Happy’s irritated voice, and that’s when he realizes the elevator has reached its destination and Happy was waiting for him to get his butt out. Peter mutters a quick apology and rushes after the bodyguard.
“What? No! I meant it in a good way, I swear! I-” Tony sighs harshly. “I screwed up, didn’t I?”
“I’m the one who’s sorry. I shouldn’t have pushed you away. You’ve always had my back,” Tony says.
“When?” Pepper’s tone is full of irritation. “Before or after our wedding?”
“I hope that’s not all I was to you.”
“Do you want a snack?” Tony asks, completely oblivious. “I know how much you love my pb&js.”
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose in frustration. “Kid, you can’t lie to them.”
“I already filled out the birth certificate. I put down Morgan H. Stark.”
Tony reaches down between them, running the tip of his finger against the hole that he desperately needs to bury his cock in. The scent is stronger now, smacking Tony in the face with its intensity. Tony wants to drop down to his knees and lick up the slick that’s pouring out. He wants a taste of this beautiful omega.
But maybe it wasn’t as bad as Steve liked to think. He was finally somewhere safe. He was also near the pup’s father, and though Steve didn’t know him and they didn’t share a bond, he felt comforted by his presence. Maybe it was just his omega side finding reassurance in an alpha. Whatever the reason, Steve felt safe.
“Dinner sounds fun.” Tony comes into the room, smirking.
“I know, honey. Just hold on,” Tony assures and he jumps out of bed to help his husband.
“So you guys haven’t cleaned this out yet?”
“Can I?”
Sam sighs as he thinks it’s over. “I think we will. Just because he wants to live with Tony right now doesn’t mean he’s gone from our lives forever. And we were here first.”
Tony Stark wasn’t dead. He couldn’t be.
Natasha quickly reaches for more tissues when Steve starts sobbing again. Her eyes widen in surprise from how hard he cries and she reaches out to rub his shoulder.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers and his eyes fill with tears. “But I can’t keep you. I can’t. I’m not ready to be a parent.”
Peter claps his hands happily and babbles something Steve doesn’t quite understand. Peter has been saying a few words, but none of them had been what Steve was expecting. He was sure papa would have been his son’s first word.
“Let me go.”
Steve lets out a small laugh and reaches for his fork. “It’s the serum,” he explains as he twirls the fork around the spaghetti until it’s coming back with the noodles. He takes a bite and chews.
Steve’s lips purse into a tight line. How the hell was he supposed to explain to the Director that he had a one night stand a few months ago? He was America’s Golden Boy. The image of himself was forever tainted.
“You will. I’ll help you. I promise.”
“Someone’s ready to meet you,” the nurse says, her smile growing brighter. She wheels the baby over and carefully places him into Steve’s outstretched arms.
“Right. Let him know I’ll be right down. Thank you.”
That captures Tony’s attention and he perks up. “Why? Did he call?”
Peter bites down on his bottom lip and shakes his head.
“I’m okay.” It’s all a lie. Steve has never felt so...lost. He thought waking up in a new time was overwhelming, and maybe it had been, but now he has a baby to care for. A baby he had no idea even existed. It was a lot to take in.
“I’m sorry.” Tony squeezes his eyes shut. He doesn’t want to be here. He should be back in his tower, drinking his eighth cup of coffee and tinkering with his inventions. But instead he’s here. He doesn’t even know where he is.
Steve smiles and takes his son’s hand. “I promise.”
To Steve it was just another day. His birthday was something he had stopped caring about a long time ago. When he was a child it had been more exciting, and that was even when he and his mother were struggling to get by. She always managed to scrape together just enough to get him something every year. They’d spend the evening watching the fireworks illuminate the sky. The celebration had been for their country, but his mother never let him forget that those fireworks were for him too.
“Surprisingly no. No one really knows that I’m alive,” Steve says, shifting uncomfortably when the alpha looks him over.
Steve tunes the banter out, deciding to give all of his attention to the little boy in his arms. It still hadn’t hit him yet that he had given birth. Harley was unexpected, but a blessing at the same time.
Peter pales at those words. “You trust me with your life?” He squeaks in surprise.
“Mama,” Peter whines and tugs at the sleeve of Steve’s nightshirt. “Play! I wanna play!”
“You don’t believe me, do you?”
“N-nothing. I just-the cake and-”
“Step away,” Natasha warns when Sam gets too close. “I’m holding him. Get in line.”
They sit in silence for a few minutes, both unsure of what they’re supposed to say next.
But this time he won’t hurt Steve. He’ll find another way to take care of the problem.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Steve assures. He knew how guilty his mate felt. He’d never blame Tony for the trouble they found themselves in. It wasn’t the alpha’s fault.
Peter was still too young and luckily didn’t remember being under Hydra’s care. The little pup wasn’t showing signs of the serum affecting him either, but Steve and Tony still kept an eye out just in case.
Steve comes closer, reaching out until he’s gently cupping Tony’s face. Tony places his hand over Steve’s wrist. He finds himself leaning into the comforting touch, but then he catches himself and pulls away.
The nausea was finally nearing the end. There were still moments when Tony would feel sick and need to be near the toilet, but it wasn’t as severe as it used to be. The pregnancy was getting easier to handle.
Steve jumps up to his feet and Tony backs away. “Tony, please? You’re not him. Believe me you’re not.”
“I know who you are, Mr. Stark.” Natalie flashes a dazzling smile.
“Steve’s not here.”
“You took him away from me, from us, from Peter.”
“Where are we?” Tony asks then he gasps and his eyes widen. “Pete! The baby! Steve, the baby!”
“Steve? Hey, honey what are you doing out here?”
Peter nods. “Okay.”
Steve stills the movement of his hand, not wanting to bring Tony over the edge yet. “Get the lube,” he suggests.
“I know it’s difficult,” Nick continues, “but I need you to tell me everything you know. Alexander was an old friend of mine.”
“Ma?”
Steve is helped into a gown and his clothes are placed into a large plastic bag before being set aside. He’s carefully helped onto the bed and positioned to lie back with his head resting against the pillows.
Hearing that has Tony’s heart clenching in the most painful way. Steve put others before him. He probably put Tony’s feelings before his own. Tony wonders how many nights Steve laid awake thinking about him and the way things had been left. Steve was probably devastated but determined to reach out to Tony and make things right.
“He’s fine, Tony. He just wants love too.” Steve props himself up on his elbows and calls the dog over, earning another groan from his boyfriend.
“I couldn’t do this,” Tony says, this time meaning to share his internal struggles.
“You deserve one. I’ll be here,” Steve says.
Steve jerks his hips, needing Tony to hurry up and do something. The alpha can read his mind and he lowers himself down onto his belly until he’s eye level with Steve’s hole. The omega gasps when Tony places kisses along the inside of his thigh. Tony smirks and brings his mouth closer to where Steve wants, his warm breath ghosting over the sensitive rim.
They talk about Steve’s new life and the friends he’s made during his stay. Steve shows off all of his new sketches. He’s happier. He’s finally at peace with himself
