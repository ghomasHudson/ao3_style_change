Tony smiled softly to Steve and then he pushed Steve’s hand away that was trying to feed him.
Tony froze when he saw Bruce eyes turned green, he just kept looking at the man above him.
It's been a week since he was taking by Hydra. Frost couldn't keep his mouth shut and couldn't keep his distance, just when Wanda was about to stab Peter, Frost take the knife from her and stabbed her.
"Brother, please let's go back? Our father is waiting for us! Please, Loki?" Thor looks at Tony for help and Tony swallowed. Huh? He wants him to convince Loki? Loki who chocked him and throw him out of the window?? Loki who tried to kill him?
“No you’re not! You’re going to your bed now!” Bruce ordered him and dragged Tony to his bed.
She start laughing on him.
Thor kissed Peter who was shocked now and his tears falls when he heard Steve’s cheers for Thor.
“Peter what’s wrong? Are you hurt? What’s hurting you baby?” and once again Steve was imin his personal space.
“As you wish sir.” And that’s was Friday.
“Oh my god ! How I’m going to hide these shit !” Tony was angry when he saw the heickies but then he laughed at Thor .
“I’ll love you Tony . But , please love me back “ Thor said kissing him again and Tony nodded.
“That’s was my pleasure boss.” His AI sounds so sad and broken. He smiled and closed his eyes cause he felt that he’s tired now.
“Dad please? Stop ok! you’re being weird now.”
"Leave him! Damn you!" Peter screamed through the pain.
"Fine. How are you dad?" He asked Tony looking at him and seeing how pale he's.
Friday just opened the door and Steve was shocked to see Tony is laying on the ground breathing heavy!
He saw Loki hugging Tony and Tony hugging him back . He couldn’t understand anything anymore. Was Tony trying to gets him jealous? Or was he sleeping with the gods ? But this can’t be out from Tony . Steve left them before anything else happened  .
"Come on Loki sit down darling." Tony says to Loki who was pregnant with Bucky's child. Bucky helped him sitting down and Tony sighed.
He knows that he should do it for them, but he can’t.
“I wish I know that before Tony ! Cause I love you too ! Please don’t leave ! we could be beautiful together I promise you “
“No Tony . I’ve not” Thor replied and go to mark Tony’s chest .
“I ... I ? I want to get Peter home again Steve “ Tony said again his eyes filled in Tears
He coughed blood on the ground and rested his back on the wall and tried to take a deep breath.
“We are happy too cause we have you man !” Bruce said smiling widely and Tony matched Bruce’s smile
He's a murderer.
Peter is the most important person to Tony and now of course he’ll never talk to his son or look at his son in the eyes.
He looked up again at Clint to see one of the bullies is trying to bully the girl with Clint.
“Yes Sir “ Steve said looking at the ground.
“Then I’ll say you were my friend “ Tony said
He saw how Thor’s body froze and Peter stood and run away from Thor cause right now he screwed up.
Steve hold Peter hand and Peter smiled to him.
“So now he’ll stay away from you he won’t fight her I know that “ Natasha continued and Steve nodded she hugged him and he sighed he had to be strong only for Tony .
Steve doesn’t know why he did this but he had this feeling that Sharon is not guilty about what happened.
“Hey doll, you’re safe. No one is going to touch you sweetheart. You’re safe.” Bucky started whispering in Tony’s ears while Clint was rubbing Tony’s back.
Steve smiled and sit
“You did ? And what about you Steve ?” Bucky asked and there was no answer from Steve.
“ Ok “ And that’s was Tony answer.
“Tony? N-no I could hurt y-” Tony shush him when he pulled him into deep kiss.
How can Loki talk like that? He felt pity on him? All that because he knows what happened with his parents? He is not pathetic.
Tony tried to get his hand free from Steve but Steve hugged him.
“Tony ? You ok ? You’re not eating? You don’t like it ?” Natasha asked him and Tony smiled to her
He screamed in pain cause dah this is Thor the strongest one and he was beating someone weak like Peter, he’s right how pathetic!
Then when Steve was about to finger Tony he turned Tony so now Tony was facing the pillow like always .
“What if I fall in love with him ?” Thor asked and Bruce hugged him to confirm him .
How Tony supposed to live after what he saw? Loki wishes the time will get back so he won’t make the same mistake and let Tony see what happened.
After fighting his fear and winning his fight he decided to go and get Tony back between his arms .
"Tony we're trying to be team here so why you're like that? We're trying to help eachother and we're trying to stand for eachother, but tell me why you're like that? We're not enough for you, I know that, but can you please accept us. He's the captain here and we must follow his orders it's not a game Tony. For now after what happened..." She took a deep breath and Tony let his tears fall cause they can't see him right now. Maybe it's just because she's angry at him?
"He told you to stay in the back line because there is a plan ! Why you are always trying to be a hero, you are not a hero! You could never be a hero . You’re a criminal Tony ..” Natasha left him looking at the ground.
“Thanks Fri. You’re the only one who puts up with me through everything.”
"Always." He replied to her and she looked at him then she sighed and stood.
“J! Help me, I don’t know what to do!” He makes it worse when he rises his voice and he cursed when Bruce shoved him and opened his eyes.
He sighed and pulled Tony’s hand between his hands . He kissed it again and again.
But just when Tony entered the room he looked at him and he was surprised when Tony pulled Thor’s collar to kiss him . He was shocked he couldn’t hear or see anything except Tony and Thor .
He can hear Friday’s voice calling him.
"How are you feeling sleepy head?" He was grinning now and so she is.
“Ned gave us your message the first thing I did was going to Pepper and Rhodey thanks to god they were in the same place. so we go directly for Tony and we saw Sharon with him giving him magic and drugs by needle so we stopped her and we get the answers we wanted.” Stephan brushed Peter’s hair away and saw how Peter’s body froze but he knows why so he sighed and continued “Then I came up to you and broke the spell from them. But they can’t remember anything from the past month when they’re a wake.” Peter nodded and looked at them.
Bucky was sure that Tony was raped, but it was too late. Tony is under shock right now. Everyone is beside him, pleading him to say something for them, but there was no response at all.
"I'm Thor, God of Thunder and the prince of Asgard! I'm the strongest avenger–" Peter's face turned red once he saw Loki leaning on the wall and smiling at him. "Uncle Loki! H-hey! When did you get in here?"
“J? lights off and volume down please?” His AI did what he told him immediately and Tony wrapped his arms around his best friend protectively, he closed his eyes and slept as well.
“Hey Bruce? Just aske if you want to make out with me” Tony winked to him and Bruce turned red.
She was sitting and drinking a coffee.
Continue or leave?
His eyes start to blur and the last thing he saw was Sharon crouching beside him. She was smirking and the other Hydra soldiers were taking their positions.
Thor was biting his neck now while Loki was kissing him.
Warning: There’s a mention of rape. There’s a suicide.
In the second time they had sex was in the avengers tower but in the fifth floor where Natasha is staying.
“I’m sorry Tony that I wasn’t here for you” Bucky said and Tony didn’t replied to him and Bucky knows that Tony is crying in silence .
When they all turned around they didn’t find Steve with them . Looking down at the ground to find him unconscious.
In the evening Steve picked him up and took him to his room.
But he stood and nodded .
"Avengers, Let's go. All out now." He walked and saw Loki stabbing someone in his neck. Thanks god Loki was on their side.
He missed Pepper and Rhodey, if only they were here with him to hold him..
Hope you enjoyed reading it. Love you all♥️
He went to Loki who was calm and lost in his own thoughts, Tony cleared his throat and Loki looks at him. "Hey Loki." Loki rolled his eyes and sighed.
“Jesus! Man what the hell ! knock first !” Tony rolled his eyes but once he saw Loki is looking at his body Tony turned red and Loki smirked.
He felt a hand on his shoulder, he looked up to see Steve.
At first he was shocked from Steve then he nodded and left them with his eyes full of tears.
“But we can’t let you die Tony and I’m sorry. Steve doesn’t know about this part. Fury tried to save the world by killing you but we don’t care about the world Tony, We care about yo-“
“What if something happened to him ?!” Steve asked again and Bucky tried to speak but Steve shut him up.
Seeing Thor kissing Tony’s neck from behind while Tony is making food just like the way he used to do to him .
There’s something in Tony’s eyes telling him to shut up but he couldn’t shut up .
After time passed no one comes to them.
“Tony we’re going to be -“
Steve was shocked Tony surprised him and he was on top on him
“He should know of course “ Tony said and they agreed with him .
Tony’s tears were falling and he was only looking at them .
He just felt so weak he needed to feel Steve’s warmth now.
Tony’s eyes shoots open
He couldn’t stay here and let Loki show some pity on him, so he stormed off.
Then Thor ripped Peter’s shirt and took off his harness, for Peter he knows this is his end. He just looked around at them and seeing them all except Tony.
“That’s it dear” Thor kissed his forhead and Tony relaxed again.
Tony giggled and soon his giggles changed to be moans .
He wish he could cry between Steve’s arms and tell him that he doesn’t know if he was a demon or an angel!
“Yeah your friend Steve is shit” Thor said and Bucky narrows his eyes and Thor sighed .
Steve pulled his hand free and all though Tony wasn’t holding tightly. He looked into Tony’s eyes and says “You’re the wrong Tony.” Even when the lights are off he saw something in Tony’s eyes for a moment, but then Tony looked away and sighed.
Thor chuckled and stood behind Tony .
He always do that cause he’s trusting Steve with his whole life.
They heard a sound of a car approaching and Tony turned back and when they came out of the car.  He couldn’t help his eyes landing on Steve.
“Thanks pops.” Peter thanked Steve and then he stood and stormed out of the kitchen.
He was on his knees waiting to turn into dust like everyone else. But his luck prevented him from turning into dust like everyone else. His luck is always bad. Now he is blaming his luck and he knows that the mistake was that he could not prevent Thanos.
He dared to look at Tony and Tony was grinning but it was fake .
How was he supposed to tell them about what happened? It’s looks like they can’t remember anything and that’s they were being controlled by! He was pulled from his thoughts when Thor called him again.
Time passed by and he was on the floor waiting, Bucky sitting beside him. "You really love him, Stevie." Steve smiled and looked at his hands.
“I miss you “ Steve said kissing Tony deeply and Tony let him did what he wanted .
He looked at Pepper and she was saying that he can rest they'll be fine.
"Everyone in position?" He got the yes sir, and yes Captain. "Ok, now! Breaching, Breaching!"
“Maybe.I don’t know “ Thor said .
He excused himself and go to his workshop to lock himself there.
and Tony only nodded cause he couldn’t speak he was feeling embarrassed for what Loki did .
“I ended up everything with him “ Steve said and Sharon looked at him surprised.
“It’s Ned.” Stephan smiled to him and Peter smiled back and ducked his head down.
He looked at the door to see Steve and Tony.
“What ? You’ve changed your mind ?” Tony asked and kissed Thor who kissed him back.
Then there was an explosion and he was knocked to the floor.
“Woah easy tiger I know I’m sexy but now I like to take it easy on the bed and not roughly.” Tony wiggled his eyebrows and Bruce smiled to him and shake his head.
But he swore by his life that he won’t live without Steve for even a day. But now Steve is giving up on him .
"Sir, he's sitting alone on the roof."
"Eww how could they force someone like you to someone like her!" Peter starts giggling wich causes the soldier to smile.
Tony sighed and hide his face in his hands .
This is the first time he saw Tony’s tears falling.
“ Steve! Control your self damn it !” Thor pulled him
Tony looked at the ground and Steve pulled Tony’s chin up to force him looking into his eyes .
He lifted Tony's hand and kissed it.
Steve sighed and said “I can’t Natasha! I really want her and I can’t keep lying at him cause I can’t hurt him anymore!”
“I found the love of my life finally ! And I want to spend the rest of my life with her ! “ He looks at Natasha who was smiling to him . And he smiled back.
Tony wasn’t expecting Bruce to have nightmares like that, what happened to him? Could it be Hulk? he was waiting for him to calm down and then talk to him, but when Bruce opened his eyes Tony saw Bruce was hurting and he was in pain.
Like that Thor rushed to the workshop and everyone following behind him.
"I swear to Thor that I'll kill who ever stood in my way to bring my kid back! It's been a week Bruce! A fucking week!" Tony snapped at him and get in the suit.
He needed to tell Steve everything is going on with him but he can’t.
Howard was telling him to do things and if Tony failed with doing one thing then that’s mean he’ll sleep out in the coldness, bleeding and hungry.
“I won’t let anyone hurt you Tony I’ll always be here for you alright?” Bucky said cause Tony was shaking and Bucky kissed Tony’s hair several times.
“Yes Pete?”Jarvis sounds come
After 5 days:
“Wake up” the voice whispered in his ear and Tony wakes up .
“We’re not together now.” Tony answered like it was a normal thing but inside he couldn’t believe it.
Why Steve?
When he was inside Tony he groaned because Tony was hot inside and tight, but Tony took him without saying anything he just moans and pulled Steve closer to him.
“I’m happy they’re coming back.” He smiled to them and moved Thor’s head off of his thigh and then he walked to his room.
"Alright, Avengers let's go." And they did.
Thor stopped and turned to him .
"Telling lies, sweety?" Natasha won't leave him unti he gave her the answer.
He wish the time gets back just to kiss that beautiful neck . Just to mark Tony and tell everyone that he’s already taken.
And he did. He was in the kitchen in the middle of the night when Clint is back from his last mission. He didn't notice Tony was sitting until Tony cleared his throat.
“So you’re demon ?” Bucky asked kissing Tony’s neck and Tony chuckled . Bucky smiled in Tony’s neck
once Steve was out of Tony’s sight Tony fall on his knees .
"I missed you." Loki whispers against his lips and the winter soldier kissed him again.
And Tony knows that the thing had broke now .
"I-.. I need to brea-th!!" He choked out and Stephan chuckled and ruffled Peter's hair then he left Peter alone.
“I’m sorry about what happened Tony.”
“No ! I don’t need to be loved ! What the hell is wrong with you guys ?!” Tony said rolling his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’re all here now and I want to tell you something!”
but that’s let Steve worry more
Steve was standing with Natasha, Rhodey , Thor and Rocket
It’s been two fucking months and no one came for him.
Bucky is broken without anything else, and if he remembered then he’ll kill himself immediately.
“In LA . They’re going to put a serium to them “ She said kissing Steve and Steve asked her
Steve was just a new one to him . He needs the old Steve. He can’t live with this one . Noway .
“Bucky shut the fuck up! We’re trying to sleep!”
“Thor, pick him up now!” Bruce ordered and Thor obeyed immediately.
Why so sudden they’re being like that!
Clint punched him again and again and again until Tony was lying on the ground breathing heavily and Clint start kicking him.
“Loki I trust you the most with this. I know you’re overprotective around my boy.” Rhodey says and Loki smirked.
He can’t beg him anymore.
“Hello ?!” He tried this time harder . and there’s a light showed infront of him .
They were all in the room, all of them sitting except him and Tony.
Steve, Bruce, Natasha and Clint were all waiting for them? Natasha pulled him into hug that Tony was about to cry again but he just smiled and kissed her cheek. “Don’t you ever scare me like that again. Do you fucking understand?” He chuckled and nodded to her.
He stood in front of the mirror... Yeah he was looking fresh and new, now he was ready to face them. Yes he's ready.
and Tony’s smile never lefts his face he hold Steve’s hand that was on his cheek and kissed Steve’s palm and that’s worried him more
Nat noticed him she motions to them and Tony stopped talking.
“I have to leave this place “
Now Tony was in the bed with his boyfriend and Steve seems so quiet.
Tony sighed and nodded smiling he loved them all they’re like his family.
Tony exhaled his breath
Bucky was standing at the door and a gun in his hand he was looking at them and no one can read what he’s thinking about .
“No ! No leave me Please!”
“Tony if you’re strong then I’ll tell you that I’m not strong. I need to revenge, please?!” Steve pulled Tony’s elbow softly so now they were facing each other. Tony knows that they will do anything to make him feel safe again, but he’s better than this. He’s stronger than this.
He watched as the kid, Peter, clutching to him and crying saying they won, and the Rhodey and Pepper pulled him off of Tony.
Steve sinked down to the floor pulling Peter with him, they both searching for comfort from each other.
When he finish his call He go to the kitchen where the rest of the avengers are .
The next thing he knows that he was in a big trouble.
Tony can’t look at anyone of them without getting hurt.
“You deserve it !” Tony replied and narrowed his eyes.
“Yeah I’m . Thanks babe “ Tony replied to him and he kissed Steve’s cheek. Steve hold Tony’s hand
“What do you want? You took him from me. What else DO YOU WANT!” He can’t control himself anymore he was scared and he was alone.
“Hey! Leave them alone!” Tony saw Loki sighing but he stood and walked to stood with Tony.
“Yeah ?” Tony’s voice was as a whisper.
Tony smiled to him and Steve smiled back but he wasn’t expecting to be kissed in the middle of the dance floor
Peter fall to the ground, tears already falling and he was shocked. “W-why uncle Loki?” Yeah he knows that he betrayed the kid’s trust, but he had to.
He opened his eyes and took a deep breath. That’s right, because of him all of them died, his mother, his father, and of course May and Ben too.
“Guys can you please give me your attention?” He was grinning and now he’s sure that it’s only a week and everything will go back to normal.
“Baby, What’s wrong? Tell me, are you alright?” Steve asked him and his voice full of worries and soft in the same time.
He kept working and drinking to busy himself from thinking.
"Where's pops?" He asks hoping he'll get the answer he wants cause seriously that's his best friend so he shoul know.
till now he never looked into Steve’s eyes . He was looking everywhere except Steve.
“Come on, answer him Peter. Tell him where have you been!” Tony was only yelling at him and Peter was sick now, he had enough of this.
He stood and left them .
“What the hell were you thinking about! She’s was about to get shot twice just because of you! Is that a time to hide behind her! You’re such a coward! If something happened to her then you’ll be dead Tony.” And like that Tony just nodded to Clint. So Clint thought that Tony’s blood on Natasha was her. Then let it be like that. What Clint said was true, all this happened just because of him.
"Tony" answered her by giving her his name and she started working on a spaceship and he went to help her.
“What happened?!” Steve’s voice was loud that Tony’s face pinched in pain.  Steve crouched near Clint and start touching Tony’s face.
“I know what you’re thinking babybrotha “ Thor said and Loki nodded .
“Yeah I wanna take him . That’s the truth! I wanna keep him between my arms in the night! I wanna kiss him and take the pain away from him ! I wanna make love to him and make him forget everything he kno-“ Thor was cutted because Steve punched him in the face .
Once the door was closed, the soldier was in front of him checking him if he's ok.
"Alright, if he doesn't want to tell me about it then I'll see what happened." He said and Tony nodded to him.
“I’m so sorry baby.” Steve was kissing Peter’s hair, forhead, cheeks and his nose and Peter was now a mess between his pops hands.
“You’re a Doctor, you’ve had saved a lot of people without expecting any money from anyone. Hulk is good, he is a hero just like you. He saved a lot of innocent souls and he did the same thing you did, he wasn’t expecting anything for return. You’re not a monster Bruce. Hulk is not a monster. You’re an angel from the sky. It’s ok if you don’t believe m–” Bruce cuts him with a kiss, he was so grateful to hear something like that.
Bruce sighed and hugged Tony suddenly. Tony froze in his place. He doesn’t know what to do? Cry? Push Bruce away from him? only hug Bruce in return?
“It’s hurt pops.” his tear fall from his eye and Steve hugged him.
"Shh relax baby. Nothing's wrong, I'm here for you."Stephan was reassuring him that's nothing going to happen and everything's gonna be alright but Peter knows that's he's not alright and there's things going to happen.
"What's happened to you?" He really doesn't know what's wrong with pops and uncle Thor.
She stood infront of Frost and put her hand on his cheek, "You're mine. Forever." It felt like she's promising him.
“Tony wake up !” it was Steve’s  voice
Bucky came and hugged Peter who tensed and moved far from Bucky. Thanks to god no one noticed him.
••••••••••••••••••
"I hope he's gonna make it." She squeezed Steve's shoulder and left him.
“Ouch ! But I wanna see what’s under this towel!” Loki said and giggled once he saw All of Tony is red .
“Damn Steve! Warn me at first!” But Steve ignored him.
Tony was sitting lost in his own thoughts. It was midnight and everyone was out so now he was enjoying the silence.
He didn't care about the people and he'll never care about them when it's comes to Tony, his Love.
“ uhm ? FRIDAY ? What’s Steve doing?” Tony asked and FRIDAY took a time before replying to him
Then The lights was off. He cursed and felt so scared.
So yeah he wrapped his arms around Bruce and sighed.
Tony smiled and closed his eyes and his breath stopped
He finished his drink in one sip
He just hopes they'll start a new life again.
"Hey uncle Bucky! It was good, Thanks! What about your day with uncle Sam?" Peter giggled cause he saw how Bucky's face turned.
Peter felt happy. He can live now with his family.
“Loki “ His voice was warning to Loki and Loki just chuckled on him but never leaving Tony ((or taking his hand off Tony’s ass)) .
“Sir I’m afraid that we can’t answer you. Peter told us to delete what happened in the past month.” With what Jarvis said everyone was shocked.
“Hi I’m Loki” The man replied to him . They walked together no one of them saying anything.
“Tony? Open your eyes please?” And Tony did after moments. When he saw Clint is searching in his eyes, he looked away and Clint sighed.
the man was having  a dark hair man he seemed a trouble to Tony. Why he’s going to be with this one?
“No, you’re going to any mission you want to and leave Nick on me I’ll deal with him.”
Steve was talking to Tony about their last mission and how it end up with all of them getting injured because there was no air support from Ironman and how they wants him back.
He opened the Shower room and Tony was surprised to see him . Steve hugged him and Tony wasn’t looking at him .
This is really going to be a hard road.
“FRIDAY give me information about the demons and angels please?”
Thir felt sorry to see this family suffering. He just hopped this family will find the happiness again.
Everything was black .
“Tony no , I can’t not when you’re so tired like that and so pale !” Bruce said rolling his eyes and Tony smiled to him and put his hands together and said “That’s good then let’s work babe “ They smiled to eachother and start working .
He sighed and let his fingers run in his hair .
‘What if they remember everything and they’ll punish me again?’ He was shaking just thinking that they’ll abuse him again. He had to avoid telling them or even looking at them.
“Sorry I scared you babe “ Tony said his voice was as a whisper and Steve hate it when Tony is hiding things from him . But in the same time he was hiding alot of things from Tony .
He couldn’t hear what Tony was saying or what Thor was saying cause the next thing he know Tony asked Thor to fuck him
"He took everything from me, my parents, my brother! My life!" She was getting angerier with every moment passed and Peter was getting scared especially her red glow is spearding through the room and when she took steps toward him, he shoots her with his webs but it's like she expects him to do it; she holds him with her power and lifted him frim the floor and he was feeling something inside him is tearing apart.
So Bucky is also lost?
“You know? I’ll take your wings and I’ll give you to your enemies. Yes Tony I’ll give you to the angels We have a deal together. They’ll kill you and no one will miss you even Steve and you know why? Cause he’s going to be with me.” She stood behind him and she started to touch the wounds.
‘Everything is going to be better now. No one have to put up with me now. I don’t have to be broken now’  That was the last thing passed his mind before he let the dark claim him.
He hides behind the wall and then he looked to see Sharon giving them potions like drugs. She was sticking the needle into Tony’s neck.
Steve tipped Peter’s chin up to make eye contact, but Peter closed his eyes cause he just couldn’t do it and better say he mustn’t do it, Steve will know if he looks into his son’s eyes.
This is the last thing he wanted. He doesn't want them to stay far from him, he sleeps better when he knows that they're here and no one can touch him.
Everything was good until Rhodey came and told Tony to go with him.
"Look who's awake!" It was Loki's sweet voice.
He begged him so many times to stay with him and in the end Steve will stay with him .
“I’m sorry Tony.Sh-she is right I could never be enough for this team. I’m the reason of what happened to you.” He kissed her forhead.
“Tony look at me “ Thor said but Tony refused
In the next morning he saw Sharon standing and talking with his dads.
“Nah Nat the food is good but I don’t feel like I’m hungry “ He answered her smiling and she smiled to him but yet he can see the worry in her eyes .
They go down to eat their early breakfast.
"Bucky said he saw it too." Tony stood and start pacing around. It's true, there's noway they're just imagining things. They're all monsters, what happened? Why they were treating Peter like that? And how could no one of them remember what happened in the past month?
“I don’t care.” And he left them.
Clint and Natasha breached the room and Bruce following after them, telling them about Tony's health and they can't tell him.
He opened his eyes when he felt the door opened and shiver run down his body. He saw Steve standing at the door, he looks like he was having nightmares.
“Babe I’m really sorry ... even when I’m saying that I’m sorry you have all the rights to not forgive me “ Steve kissed Tony’s lips slowly and sighed.
Steve nodded and smiled to him
When they enter the hospital, they took Natasha and after minutes she was full awake.
He was hurting Tony alot . But he can’t help himself. When everytime he saw someone is touching Tony he’ll get mad . But if Tony’s happiness is being with Thor he will leave Tony ? No he can’t he loves Tony so much .
•••••••••••••
The End.
He give him his back and he can feel Tony’s shocked expression. But yet Tony hugged him and kissed his shoulder . Nat you’re so wrong For this reason Tony and I are the best couples !
But he remember what happened in Siberia and lowered his head to the ground and then looked again to find Natasha and Thor and ... Raccoon?!
He walked to the light . He was shaking . He was afraid of what will happen to him .
"N-no, Steve..." he coughs and Steve starts rubbing his back, "I want t-to rest pl-please?" It was Steve's turn to shake his head, "Steve li-listen to me! I-it's over, let g-go... It's ok." Pepper wanted to pull Steve off, but he shrugged her hands off and glared at her. She really didn't deserve someone to treat her like that, but he can't. He just wants Tony to be alive.
He suddenly felt weaker and he closed his eyes and let the dreams take him away from his reality.
"I could have lost you. I can't even imagine what I would do without you babe." He leaned down and kissed his husband's forehead.
But he couldn’t cause all he can think about is Tony .
Seeing Tony sitting in Thor’s lap and hiding his face in Thor’s neck cause he’s tired from some boring meetings.Just the way they always do after every meeting or interview.
“Tony !” Rhodey called him and Tony was out of the zone when he felt Natasha’s hand on his shoulder he jolted and looked at them
“Tony ?” Bruce’s eyes waterd
So what you think guys? It’s really wasn’t good enough but I hope you enjoyed it.
“Seriously man ? I was enjoying this fight “ Loki said and they all ignored Loki .
Steve moved the hair away from Tony’s forhead and he kissed Tony’s forhead.
“Screw you and screw everything about you ! I won’t let you kill him !” Bucky stood and walked to the door
They put him on the bed and Bruce was with him
He looked at Natasha and squeezed her hand and then he go out just to gasp in horror at the sight in front of him.
“Steve ! you’re the worst ma-“ Thor stopped talking and looked behind Steve
ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
“Come over here “ Steve said to Tony who was about to come but Thor stopped him .
<———><———>
(See the end of the chapter for
Then suddenly image of Thor and Tony kissing shows in his head .
Then they were sitting and watching Brooklyn nine-nine. It’s only about hald an hour and Bruce was sleeping with his head resting on Tony’s chest.
“Why did you take me with you ? all I want it is just to stay home but you ? you decided to kill me . Why Mr Stark ? “ Peter asked also walking to Tony
Two spies, two super soldiers, two gods and a fucking deadly robot was running after him!
He closed his eyes and hopes he'll heal faster.
There was Steve having sex with Sharon again.
Suddenly Thor lifted Tony and put him on the counter.
And once he finished and go to sit with the others he wasn’t looking or talking to Natasha and she was looking at him .
and Steve just nodding to him
(See the end of the chapter for
*Warning there’s alot of (abuses/angst/etc) in this chapter* if you don’t like it don’t read it ♥️
And now they all know that they should save their Tony.
She nodded and again hugged him.
“uhm ? We all except Sam and Thor “ Natasha replied
And when he was about to push Sharon away from Steve suddenly he was in the kitchen.
But Tony refused to tell him he just kissed his hand and said
He felt Tony’s tongue inside his mouth and he just couldn’t react he was just putting his hand on Tony’s shoulder and the other was dropped he wasn’t pulling him closer or pushing him away
They all were looking at him now .
Steve looked at him snd he was worried about him and Tony’s face turned red.
“Thanks Tony, you’re the best.” He gave him one last kiss and then he stood and started wearing his clothes.
"Natasha is also shot, but she'll be awake soon enough." Steve nods to him and enter the cave.
Wanda screamed at what she saw. And everyone was shocked. Natasha’s tears were falling. Bruce, Thor and Loki had seen this before but not that much of blood.
“I need you Why you’re not here!? I fucking need you right now! I-.. I need a shoulder to cry on where the fuck are you! I hate you!” He kept crying on the floor until he was exhausted and slept.
“Loki! Don’t! We just have to stay with him now.” Loki nodded to his brother.
“Rhodey?! He - he looked at him! He moved!” Rhodey run inside once he heard Pepper’s voice.
“I..? I don’t get it? Why you’re welcoming me? I. I thought that you would kick me out of the compound?”
“And who are you again?” Steve asked and Tony sighed when he saw Thor is smirking.
"He takes the shot instead of me." Everyone looks at her and she continues, "He made himself a human shield, the idiot. I can take this bullet why he thought that I was going to die?"
They finished and both of them were shaking. Bruce looked at the man under him he was passed out, He kissed Tony’s forhead and he lets his hand resting on Tony’s cheek. Tony opened his eyes and kissed Bruce’s palm, Bruce smiled to him and Tony smiled back,
“Yeah I’m . relax we don’t want a thunder to hits the tower “
Peter was Tony’s favorite. He will always make everything better. He’s Tony’s own happiness.
"You're scared." Peter looked up to see Wanda standing at the door looking at him. "But, not about yourself. You're scared about Stark."
Loki take a long breath then he pressed kiss on Tony’s shoulder and Tony was closing his eyes and he was shaking .
It’s like Tony never loved Steve.
“Kid “ Tony and Steve laughed and They back to kiss eachother
“M-morning..” He mumble to them and looked at the ground.
Thor’s eyes widened
He go to his bedroom and Steve wasn’t there and then he go to the bathroom and again Steve wasn’t there he asked FRIDAY where he can find him and she told him he was out side .
“What!” Clint jolted awake.
and Steve turned around to see Tony
He hates making weapons, he always had. It was the best decision he made.
“I told you they will be a couple” Natasha said making them to broke the kiss
All this was not fair for him .
"Thor please let me go." He requests politely and Thor didn't seem to let go.
“ ‘s o-k” He mumbles and hide his face in Stephan’s chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Damn I’m getting emotional!” Rhodey chocked out but hearing Tony laugh again was enough to bliss his day.
"But maybe he'll get hurt.. I .. I don't know if I can." Thor kneels besides them and takes Tony's hand and great they hadn't noticed that Tony was trying to hold something so he can make the pain go away.
Steve’s hand was holding Tony’s hands above his head and the other was pressing Tony’s chest .
He saw three guards running he attacked them and killed them.
Tony noticed the hints of tears in Loki's eyes and then Loki disappears leaving Tony and Thor alone.
He saw them all shocked from his chest, so of course they’ll feel disgusted by him again.  He felt uncomfortable under their gaze and then Wanda came.
“What ? Say that again?” Bruce couldn’t believe that Steve is cheating on Tony !
Maybe he’ll talk with Wanda and Steve in the morning, for now he’s tired and he want to sleep.
If he told him that he want to face him Steve would feel hurt cause again he doesn’t deserve Tony but he’ll face him . He’ll do anything Tony wants from him .
The next time he wakes up to a flashlight and sound of laughter.
"It's not your fault." He looked up at the sound. Thor, of course he's trying to make him feel better.
"Stay out of my head." He growls ar her.
“FRIDAY? Who was here ?!” Tony asked
Bruce , Thor and Loki entered the room And Steve technically rolled his eyes on Thor and Loki .
comments? kudos? Thanks for reading.<3
Peter was looking at them all arguing and he was smiling at them.
He felt better after turning the room into hell.
"Enough, let me go." He pushed Steve away and stood with Natasha.
Thor sitted beside Tony and wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist but it’s look like Tony was still thinking.
This should be over but why it’s still torturing him!?
“ I want to get some answers about who helped her with magic.” Rhodey replies.
So now just because he disappoints them, Clint is going to ignore him? It's hurt so bad. He started rubbing his chest trying to ease the pain in his heart.
“I think that too, Buck.” He replied and looked at Tony who was passed out for five days.
He asked as Thor was on top of him. His voice was shaking and as another storm hit the place, his grip tightened on Thor’s shoulders.
He wanted to go to Thor and that means he had to pass from Steve's side and what he passed him
"Oh no!" His hand run through his hair.
He turned and punched whoever was holding him.
He received a smack in the head from Bucky.
He just imagined Tony’s reaction, What will happen to him? What if he locked himself in his lab till he dies!?
He pushed Thor lightly so Thor could leave him and he did, but once his legs were on the floor, he was about to fall. Thanks god Thor picked him up again.
“What’s going on here?” Rhodey asked and Tony pulled away and tried to stood, but his body was still weak and Rhodey rushed to support his friend.
"You're going to feel nothing but pain." She whispers in his ear, then she looks at the Soldiers and nods. They took him away and drugged him to another room even though he was trying to keep himself steady.
He finished the food for them and when he was pouring tea for Bruce he spilled it on him.
“Sir? We’re here.” Happy’s voice cutted his thoughts.
Steve was on top of him and they were looking at their teammates
But Tony was feeling guilty cause he can’t tell Steve what’s going on with him for the first time .
It’s surprised him when two others come to support Quill.
He saw how the angel’s wings be they were so beautiful and pure white . In the other hand the demon’s wings are black and like the bat’s wings it was scary.
Steve kneeld beside Tony and held him between his arms
What Steve did to him even the enemies hadn’t done it to him .
“Come on seriously?!” Loki sounded so annoyed .
The last time he was like that was when Steve tried to kill him. And he stopped drinking and locking himself only when He was with Steve again.
“W-what are you doing here?” Tony asked feeling the heat reaching his ears.
“Proud of you! Yeah yeah ok! I got it!” Tony snapped at his father. He never liked the military he was so peaceful he won’t hurt a fly. But it’s like always his father gets him into troubles saying he’ll be proud of him.
“I- ... I’ll miss you cap “ Tony said before passing and fall
He couldn’t sleep and then Tony started shuffling and he was having a nightmare . Steve was surprised cause he was sure that Tony was over the nightmares . But now here he was having a nightmare .
•••••••••••••••••••••
“Shh you’re okay I got you ... You’re safe babyboy” He kissed Peter’s forhead.
The last thing Steve wanted to do right now is talking with Tony. He thought Tony was in his lab or with one of his bitches. Of course he won’t go with the team cause he got more important things and he gots no time for his teammates. What a person?
“But once we stood to leave Fury asked me to stay and then he told me a different thing.” Her voice start getting lower and he looked at Steve who was now grabbing the table behind him so tight, His knuckles were wight and he was looking at the floor. He was angry and Tony can see that.
The next time he wakes up to see Natasha and Clint talking quietly to eachother and when they notice him Natasha smiles to him while Clint looks away. Tony lifted his eyebrow, but then smiled when Natasha sits beside him on the bed.
He knows that he doesn’t deserve Tony. Tony will be more happy with everyone else except him.
His arms pulled Tony closer to him .
He was thinking in a lot of things.
“Tony ?” Soon Tony’s laughs changed to be sobs.
“You scared me Tony . And No you’re not ok ! “ Thor said trying to sound serious but he failed he sounded so worried.
“Tony I swear to you he wasn’t knowing what’s going on ! They did this to him ! Tony believe me Please!” Steve was trying to explain but Tony wasn’t listening
Was Steve in love with Sharon?
Tony on the other hand was flirting with everyone and Steve always hated that .
“Then I’ll kill him.” Rhodey said and Tony shakes his head No again. Rhodey sighed.
“Why ?! Why you didn’t leave me to die ?! I hate you ! I fucking hate you !” Tony kept crying and he was trying to get the air inside his lungs but he couldn’t.
He didn’t hear or see anything. When he regained consciousness, Bucky and Loki were holding Thor . They were Stopping him from killing Steve, but Thor was very angry.
“I’m hungry do you want to come?” Tony asked Loki when he was wearing his black t-shirt.
Tony fainted again. Eich made Bruce kick them out of the room.
Peter run to his room and locked it behind him, he threw him self at his bed and buried his face into his pillow. He kept crying and fearing that they'll give up on him or they'll go back to their old habits and hurt him again, or worse what if they felt guilty for what they did and they'll never be the same again.
Then they respected his own needs to be left alone right now.
"I'm fine, Frost." Peter tried to seem like he's ok, even though he's not.
“Tony that’s enough.“ It’s hurts Hearing Steve’s voice defending them and He can’t shout or shut Steve up. He can’t hurt the man he always loved no matter what .
Tony shrugged and kept drinking  and The night kept going
He looked at her pleading her with his eyes, she nodded to him.
“You look like shit Brucie.” Tony said smiling and Bruce was about to snap at him, but he sighed and shak his head.
Tony smiled and Bucky rolled his eyes.
"A new home finally!" Peter shouts opening his arms wide then he starts running around the house like the child he's everyone knows.
“Oh sorry ‘bout that you know that we’re the same but I don’t have Fury to brake me like he did to you.” Her eyes widened at Tony and then she nodded to Clint who punched him in his stomach. Tony wanted to fall but Clint hold him.
"It's ok, he's going to be ok. He can't leave us just like that." The three of them were looking at Tony.
“He’s going to be ok . control your self soldier “ Natasha said and Steve shake his head
“It’s 6 am “ Thor replied and Tony’s eyes widened.
Sharon should be dead right now but he promised Tony to not kill her .
Peter blushed and nodded to him, Loki brushed Peter’s hair and Peter flinched away from him and Loki sighed.
"We need to talk about this now!" Tony said calmly and Loki nodded to him.
I don’t know this time maybe the next one is the last chapter. I hope you liked this one. For me I’m not convinced with this chapter. sorry :(
“I can’t do this anymore! Natasha please help me “ Tony wS shocked that Steve is pleading Natasha just to get rid of him .
He was calm and he smiled to
Shit he hates that he had a bad feeling something is going to happen so soon.
He saw Tony sleeping he can see nothing but an angel. He doesn’t deserve Tony . He kissed him then he decided to wake him up .
“Wake up Tony.” He opened his eyes to see a man crouching beside him.
Stephan chuckled when Peter was purring like a cat and he pressed a kiss on Peter's forhead.
ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
“Easy there Br-“ He caughed blood and start to continue.”Bruce It’s ok nothing happened I don’t want you to smash anything i-“ another caugh. “In this room. Jesus it’s hard to speak” And yeah he was making his situation funny and just a joke.
“Seriously Cap? I don’t want to fight you, but right now you’re acting like a bitch.” Tony moved so now they’re inches away from each other. The fire was their eyes, Steve wasn’t going to let him win this fight no matter what and for now let the party begin.
Steve and Sharon were cuddling now .
"Brother!" Loki shouts at Thor warningly
“Nothing “ he kept his eyes on Steve
“Can I murder him ?” Bucky said
“I miss you “ She whispered and Steve was shocked that she kissed him infront of Natasha , Clint , Sam and Wanda .
He sighed and started working on Clint’s arrows to waste his time cause he doesn’t want to face Bruce, Thor and Loki after his panic attack so he kept working until he can face them again.
“He’s safe sir. He’s sitting with Thor and Loki.”
But he just nodded to him .
“You like the show ?” Tony asked smirking.
they were standing infront of him .
and Tony entered his lab his legs couldn’t hold him anymore and he fall on his knees and he broke down crying.
His never wanted to show her his tears no matter what.
‘So that you don’t have to keep me distracted’ but he choose to walk down to his lab and Bruce followed him .
He sighed and go back tp work.
“Fuck off bitches we’re coming through!” Sam said
Now he is working on his return and to see what he caused from his loss. What happened because of him in the first place.
"No, I.... I imagined Thor slams Peter's head here." Tony's face paled and Loki was looking at his hands now. And he's the one who thought it was caused of sex, but he was wrong it was because of his son and the god of thunder. He closed his eyes but he imagined what happened so he opened his eyes and rubbed them hard. "I always imagine us hurt Peter so bad. I– I know this seems crazy to you, but the blood and his screams seems so real Tony..."
"ANTHONY!" Thor screams from the other side of the room, but Tony ignored him. "We're not the same Loki and you know why because you're a monster and that's why Odin is treating you like this while I was a good person all that I wanted was a good compliment from him, from Howard! And who are you to get in my head? Did I give you the green light to see my past?" Thor was now standing beside them and Loki was looking away from them and he seemed hurt, but there's no turning back that's why Tony carry on.
Tony smiled and nods.
Peter broke crying again.
“Tony, he’s all yours. You can kill him.” Steve said and Tony shakes his head.
Tony stood and go to the mirror. He gasped and Thor’s giggles filled the room.
“Tony I’m sorry I’m really sorry . I’m not going to make that mistake again I promise you I won’t leave you again Tony “
“Tony no ! If someone has to leave then this one should be Steve or Sharon or maybe all of them but .. Not you Tony “ Tony looked up at Loki and he just needed a hug . Loki can read like an open book so he smiled to Tony and opened his arms to him . Tony was greatful for that and he hugged Loki who just kept holding him .
Loki smirked and everyone gasped .
"Because we're giving you drugs that won't heal you."
After putting all the negative energy in punching the sand bag he go to take a shower .
“Bruce seriously I’m not tired.” Tony tried but Bruce ignored him.
“Thanks J” He smiled to the nearest camera and lay on his stomach cause his back was on fire and he slept there.
“Love me Thor ?” Tony whispered when the kiss was over .
Tony's body starts shaking "I see those things too.. What if it was real?" Loki's eyes widened and then what he said surprised Tony.
Ross passed out and Loki starts laughing.
“Yeah sure ! who puts their money on me ?” Tony said grinning
“Tony, I- I know that I don’t deserve you and I know that you deserve someone better, but I know we can make a beautiful couple if we tried. Of course we’ll argue and fight over the stupid things and I know that we’ll have each other’s backs. Will you stay your whole life with me and bliss me with every morning when I see you sleep between my arms? Will you love me even though I’m being jerk? Tony will you marry me?” Tony was crying and he jumped on Steve who fall and hugged Tony.
He walked to her room and put her on the bed then put the blanket on her.
They were eating together or better say only Bruce eating cause Tony was just playing with his food .
He had seen his parents getting killed and he tried to kill the winter soldier. Steve’s best friend.
They went to make sure that he was breathing and yes he was breathing but with difficulty.
“They’re coming “ this was the last thing Stephan said it before he passedout .
In the next morning he had to see Tony and this time FRIDAY lets him in .
He looked at Loki and Thor who avoided looking at him, then he looked at Bruce who just sighed and shakes his head.
“But I don’t understand that what I’m ? Am I angel ? Demon? And why the angels want to kill me ?” Tony asked
He felt a hand pressing on his forehead, he flinched at first, but when he noticed it was metal. He opened his eyes, cause of course he's safe! Bucky is here to save the day.
“What was THAT?! Why did you do that? We don’t even know what’s the story is!” Natasha was screaming at them and Wanda was still shocked by Tony’s emotions.
Thor tried to touch him slowly and Peter flinch away.
Tony doesn’t know why he had this feeling of just going and crying between Bucky’s arms but he did .
When he saw Ross in a room, he stayed calm cause he knew his friends got his back. He knows that Steve will kill Ross if he tries to put a finger on him.
there was a chuckle and Tony took a step back .
“He’s a bitch . And she’s a bitch . Don’t worry your self if you want come with me we can live together. You , me and Peter “ Bucky suggested him and Tony giggled.
“Thor don’t enter your self again between them . They’re couple this is normal if they had a fight . This is normal if they took a time away from eachother “
“Ok ?! I feel we’re sitting between demons ! Jesus ! Let’s go Tony “ Bruce said giggling and Tony joined him .
“Peter they’re just trying to help you and you know that you should tell them.” He was surprised to hear Pepper’s voice, he turned to see her standing and Stephan was standing behind her.
"I'm the one who should apologize Tony." Tony knew that Thor should apologize, but for now he couldn't let Thor like that. He wishes Loki was also here so he could apologize to him too. Loki didn't mean to, he was just saying that Tony didn't deserve what happened to him.
Yet the surprise in Bucky’s eyes sent something warm inside Tony’s heart.
Thor looks up at Tony to see the fear in his eyes. He was scared because of their teammates.
“Sir ? Mr Stark is awake now .” FRIDAY told him and he putted his book down and go to see Tony .
He looked at Steve in his eyes
When they finish Steve go out of the bathroom and changed his clothes .
“Steve why you’re doing this to me ?!” He asked again and this time the tears falling from his eyes.
“Friday? Call Bruce tell him to come here please?” He managed to speak and he closed his eyes.
He moved closer and Steve was only looking at him
Are they going to break up ?  The story of their love was just a lie ? Steve is going to give up on him ? No , this can’t be real . The last time someone give up on him when he go to Afghanestan and it end up to him being near to death . His worst nightmare is there . And Titan of course. The first and last time Steve give up on him was in Seberia but now for Sharon ? Seriously?
Peter quickly looked at the ground.
Just when he was about to enter the room Tony was getting out . They kept looking at eachother . Steve can see how Tony’s face was pale and so tired.
“No, I can’t walk.” He said looking at the ground.
Peter is more important than anyone in this room . Tony can’t take it anymore Sharon didn’t get enough in hurting him she decided to hurt the people he loved.
Steve was on him he was hitting Tony with his shield
He opened the door and there was no sound at all, he sighed and moved in then he froze when the lights turned on.
“What’s funny? Come on tell me.” He raised his eyebrows.
“What do you meant missing?” Natasha asked. She was calm and not saying anything and yet she talked. So Steve didn’t tell them about what happened? Ok?
Of course after that Steve apologized by kissing him on the lips for the first time after while, but Tony couldn't cry in front of him even though his heart was aching and his mind was screaming and telling him it's ok to cry between Steve's arms while his body is refusing to let him relax.
Steve kept saying sorry for him and He kept kissing Tony’s head.
He looked around at the passed out bodies on the couches and only Steve was on the floor.
“I bet he can’t kiss him !”Sam said
Tony finally felt safe for the first time in a long time ago.
Steve give his back to Tony and this is the first time he did something like that after having sex ! Tony’s heart stopped beating for moments then he sighed and hugged Steve even when Steve is giving his back to him .
The next chapter is for Steve. So (Bucky’s lovers) Are you happy now XD !
“Yeah maybe cause he shouldn’t be with you ? Or maybe cause we’ll be beautiful together? Or maybe when he was hurt and laying on the floor you decided to leave him and ask about him only after he woke up ?!” Thor snapped at him And Steve was feeling Thor’s words as a knife to his heart. but it’s look like Thor’s words had affected Tony too .
“ Tony you should rest seriously babe we can’t resk your health like that “ Steve said putting his hand on Tony’s cheek .
There was no answer and When Tony turned he was surprised to be slammed on the wall .
Thor puts Tony on his bed and Tony was breathing faster than normal. “Thor, what are you doing?”
Bucky couldn't control his body the Winter soldier is controlling him again.
“I’m fine darling “ Bucky replied then Steve and Sharon entered the room and Steve’s eyes locked with Tony’s for a second then Tony looked away.
“I’m making you blush doll ?” Loki asked and what Loki called him made him blush harder .
When he grew a little older, his mother began to call him a loser too .
“Hey..I’m Tony” Tony introduced himself to the man who nodded to him and smiled back.
The movie nights were the worst for him, cause there was no place for him no matter what.
She pulled a knife from her pocket and she wanted to cut them but the knife was only tickling him. Everyone was surprised even Tony was surprised.
Glass after glass . Bottle after bottle. until he was fully drunk.
Tony was pulled out of his thoughts when Thor lies his head on Tony's thigh. Technically Tony start brushing Thor's hair with his fingers.
Just when they reaches the hall they saw Tony with Loki in a mess of blood around them and Hulk roaring from another place. But what pulled Peter's attention is his dad sitting on his knees without a faceplate, he was closeing his eyes and besid him lies Wanda with blood around her body, dead.
Guys you’re the best! Love you all!
Tony opened his eyes slowly and smiled to Steve
Tony was looking at Natasha and she glares at Peter because he started to drift off. She wanted to pull him away from Tony, but Tony’s hand stopped her.
Tony stood and slapped him, Peter immediately fall to the floor. He looked at Tony and he doesn't want to believe what's going on with them.
He didn't see anything but anger, hate and evilness. God what's he got himself into? He shivered from just looking at her, it was a clear fight; everyone knows she'll win. That's why Frost stay out of it. He won't blame him at all.
"T-tony I didn't mean to..."
“FRIDAY? “ Steve called her
“We’ll get them back together alright Tony ?” Steve said and put his hand on Tony’s cheek He noticed how Tony leaned into the touch
“I’m sorry babe.” He kissed Tony’s forhead and start leading him out of this place and leave the others to continue this fight.
“ What are you saying Stark?”
"Peter, I promised your father to keep you safe." Peter snorts. He can't let Bucky gets hurt. Hell, what he'll tell Loki? Oh, he stayed with me and the witch get mad and killed him? No way!
They kept kissing each other and they both were hard but Tony was the first one to be hard of course.
“What!? No! Why would I do that to my boy!?” that’s Steve voice and- oh he’s sitting in Steve’s lap and not on the floor, while his back pressed to Steve’s solid Chest!
He hold the bottle and throw it to the floor.
But Why he slapped him ? Why he broke up with him ? He hates himself for doing this.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This can't be real! I... I thought it was only my imagination!" Steve stood and wanted to leave, but Tony stopped him.
He stood and go out .
He had to put a line fir Tony who was shocked .
He buries his face in Thor's neck and Loki was watching them and smiling.
Steve took a step forward to them and he felt his heart is broken. Maybe Tony wants to stay with Thor ? But , yet he can’t lose Tony .
He’ll never be enough for them.
“W-what about the nice things you were saying to me dad? what about me being your lovely son pops? Uncle Thor, you never let me fall, you were always with me making sure that I never fall. Just p-please tell me what happened?” He was happy with himself that he’s not crying anymore and he’s just calm.
“Sections? why how many sections are there?” Loki asked and Clint seemed he doesn’t like Loki and Loki give him the same look Clint was giving.
“Steve ? Thor? please stop it !” Tony was done with them but yet they ignored him .
“What do you want ?” He asked dryly he wasn’t ready for  her complaining him for leaving Sharon alone .
There was a silence and finally he opened his eyes to look at... At his wings.
Rhodey was covered with blood. He just doesn’t want to see any blood right now, so he closed his eyes and started taken deep breath.
slap after slap after kick in his stomach after back hand slap after punch after kick again and what's leads to many kicks. After that he was being hit by harness.
“Hello! My name is Clint! You’re new right?” The man was so loud and Tony knew he could get in with him easily.
“You know that he’s not going to let you touch him again right?” Finally she looked at him and he smirked.
And here he was crying on Steve’s chest begging him to wake up.
And once Tony and Thor was out of his sight he go to his room saying that he wants to sleep .
Natasha switched the team in the middle of the fight.
He crouched beside Peter and start brushing his hair.
“You can’t babe. And. Stop. Calling. Them. Your. Wings. Cause they’re MINE!” He shouted at her and she punched his face.
“Where’s your bitch?” He asked looking at Steve again. Steve rolled his eyes.
“It’s ok leave him Sweetheart.” Tony told him and he left Peter who fall to the ground.
Thor pulled Tony’s wrist and They fall to the ground and Thor was on him but they continued laughing .
“I wanted you to do only one thing and all you did is disappoint us! Why he’s even between us Tony? I don’t get it!” Hearing this from Steve the lovely dad he’s, from Captain America the greatest man ever is still hurting.
Why all this is happening to him? First his parents, then his school was shit, further more Obi was in charge to take care of him after his parents died and he abused Tony, next it was Obi trying to steal Tony’s heart to make it a war machine, and then he tried tom make everything better and it turns to be worse and worse. For now his teammates, he’s troubling them and they can’t kick him out of the team just because he’s supplying them with the best items.
“What do you want Tony?” Bruce doesn’t want to be rude with Tony, but sometimes Tony gets so annoying and no one can take what he says. specially his sex jokes.
“Clint why you were avoiding me?” That slips from his lips and now there’s no turning back.
"Brother I told you to do the spell on my beloved Bruce so I can have a baby from him." Thor says and Bruce huffs out.
"I apologize ... but he went into a coma and it’s  hard to get out from this coma "
"What have you done to them?!" He tried to free himself which caused her to laugh.
“Ignore them Tony” Loki said not looking up from his food and Tony nodded to him.
He look up to see Loki kicking Clint’s ass .
"So we will lose together"
They nodded to him but he was surprised when two voices joined them.
The door slide open and Tony looked to see who was that. It was Loki.
“Y-yeah “ Steve agreed and they go to Bruce
Steve was fighting his fear cause he knew that he should be with Tony and not with Sharon.
When he wakes up he was having a bad headache.
“And who are you again?” Steve asked Thor making him smirk .
"It's my fault Steve! It's mine.... I... I kileed her parents and then her brother." Tony like usual taking all the blame in himself and Steve hates it so much when Tony's like that.
He took a sip from his beer and he was about to choke himself from it.
Bucky’s eyes were full of happiness, guilt and sadness in the sametime and it’s breaking Tony’s heart. “Thank you, Tony.” Tony nods to him and turns to face the other avengers.
After Clint was talking on the phone with his wife Tony took the chance and leave to see Steve and he was searching for him but his heart stopped beating when he saw Steve is marking Sharon’s neck .
But Tony never admit that. Tony will always leave everyone to stood by Steve’s side  .
He sighed and followed his captain.
"She took him from me! He's hurting Steve! I know it, don't lie to me!" Tony was screaming at them and tried to leave the bed for millions times. Steve called Thor and Loki, they know that even the trackers aren't working. While Loki can't find them with his magic.
And then there’s Wanda,There’s something weird by the glares that she was giving it to him, but he ignored her and closed his eyes.
“I was kissing you be-“ He start coughing blood
He was such a mess.
“I’m sorry babe. I swear to you we were searching for you! Tony, I’m really sorry!”
"I love you and good night." Steve chuckled and kissed his forhead.
“Though Hulk liked her and he’ll never hurt her and never let anyone hurt her no matter what. I hope I’ll never see her again in my whole life. I’m a ashamed.”
His green magic outspreading the room and then he let them see what he saw. Everyone was shocked and in pain.
"If something happened to anyone of them then that's on you! I'll let you regret what you did! We told you to go back and take Bruce with you so why you're still here?!" Tony's eyes were wide and he thanked his god that they cannot see him because right now all he needs was his armor.
“No Thor, put that food away. He’s grounded.” Tony said without looking up from his tablet. Everyone was about to tell him that he cannot prevents his son from eating something, but Peter smiled and nodded to his father.
"Shut up! I hate you!" Bucky groans and Steve entered the room.
And here he’s now, his teammates hates him and he’s not blaming anyone of them. The least thing he can do for them was giving them a house to live in.
Steve was sitting beside Natasha and Fury was talking to them .
"Mrs. Stark!" Peter screamed and Steve looked at the ground.
“Tony she’s not the on-“ before Natasha can continue he shoot her a warning look .
And suddenly Tony wasn’t thinking about anyone he was just enjoying to hear the heartbeat of Thor’s.
"She's not. Back when they bring her. She was just a child maybe 6 or 7 years old and they told us that we're going to marry once she's old enough."
“Yeah maybe cause he shouldn’t be with you ? Or maybe cause we’ll be beautiful together? Or maybe when he was hurt and laying on the floor you decided to leave him and ask about him only after he woke up ?!” Thor snapped at Steve but it’s look like he hadn’t hurt Steve only . Tony was breathing heavily and Steve ignored Thor and looked at Tony .
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath in . He opened his eyes and the tears were in his eyes .
How could they do that to Tony ? He was like their brother and more ! They’re really animals just like him ! Tony deserves the best he doesn’t deserve to be treated like that !
He start walking to the elevator, he just wanted to sleep right now.
“Well we have to wait for it ! maybe some enemies took it !” Natasha said rolling her eyes
Seeing Tony Helping Thor close his shirt buttons and kissing him . Just the way he did to Steve.
“What’s wrong Thor ?” Tony asked and Thor sighed.
Tony chuckled and Bruce rolled his eyes.
Peter was lying between his dad and pops, they were out in the middle of the night watching the beautiful stars together.
“Excuse me ? I’m not going to waste my time in convincing you that Tony won’t give up on me “ He left her again and he go to his room he was happy to hear the sound of water .
Steve nodded
“Oh god, oh god!” He kept saying it while trying to press hard on the wound.
He looked with horror at her.
They’ll never leave him again and Ross is going to pay for it.
When he’s with them he feels like he’s scared and in danger.
"Tony?" Steve stood and Tony sat on the couch next to Thor .
He hadn’t noticed that the morning come he looked down at Tony and kissed him
Bruce was thrusting hard and Tony was moaning loudly and Bruce didn’t care about the moans.
Wanda was like a kid and all he was trying to do was protect her but something happened.
“Tony that’s enough “ Steve wanted Tony to stop but Tony wasn’t going to stop.
And Clint? Clint was humoristic at the time of Fun and earnest at the serious times . But his heart was always clean.
“Why didn’t you tell me about this?!” Tony looked at Steve who was very angry at Thor and Natasha, But why?
They searched for the people who raped him and killed them. Although Ross had killed them all to clear his crime but Two were lucky to escape. Soon they were also killed.
Suddenly Tony remembered that no one ever kissed him like that. It's just felt so warm and he remembered that he should know this feeling very well, but he can't cause his parents were too busy abusing him.
“Relax Bruce I’m just kidding. I’m going to my workshop see you late-“
“Your aunt had connected with that stupid wizard Strange an-“ Tony cuts Loki
"That's my uncle bitches! Take that!" He put a hand over his mouth and Frost turns towards him with wide eyes, but then he chuckled and shakes his head. Peter felt himself blushing, but he didn't care. His family here to save him.
And he kept drinking.
He sallows and he was on fire . He was burning jealous.
“Fuck off bitches !” Tony rolled his eyes again and then suddenly he was in the sitting room.
He saw everything happened . This guy helped him to see that they don’t love him .
He gasped when he saw that there’s wounds in his back . That’s true they’re for his wings . How could they be ?
Bruce came and give him a syringe to let him sleep. And when Tony was on the bed again and looking at Steve like he betrayed him, Natasha and Thor enterd the room and call Steve.
I’m back! sorry I was busy with school and the exams 🤦🏻♀️💔 :( .. any way here’s another chapter. Hope you’ll enjoy it ;)
Tony went to see Stephan who was sleeping and wearing pain expressions.
But what he did to let the people die? And why they don’t care about him ? And what’s about this mission? Why don’t they just tell him what’s going on ?!
“If any one puts a finger on you then that’s mean I’m dead “ Thor said still smiling to him and Bucky kissed Tony’s hair to let him know his answer.
“L-love yo-u Rh-odes.” Event thought that he’s still can’t talk like before, but it’s warming Rhodey’s heart and Pepper who was standing at the door crying.
He hates to admit it, but yeah, he thinks about it too.
He was their baby boy , what happened?
Soon Tony opened his eyes wide and kept looking at them then he whispered “T-tha-anks.” Even though it was hard to hear it, but they were so happy to hear him.
When Tony saw Peter hugging Thor and Tony felt like this is his own fault. Peter should be living with him now .
Their Teammates were clapping and whistling for them except Thor , Bucky , Loki and Bruce they were shocked .
“They are out having dinner sir”
Who ever he was, he got a bad influence towards Ross.
Why they’re here together? Why Thor hadn’t told Steve that Tony is not enough for them? Why Thor here’s protecting him? And After all if someone saw them like that they’ll say of course there’s something between the two of them.
“Why you did this to him even if it was a mission!” Bucky snapped at them suddenly and Tony jolted and put his hand on his heart .
“Good! I’m glad you remembered that you have a friend to call.” There’s sadness showed in The colonel eyes.
Tony start panicking he shaked his head and his body was hurting him.
Tony sighed and brushed Stephan’s hair.
“Steve?” His voice was hoarse and Steve looked at him then he ignored Tony and continue walking. Tony sighed and stood.
once Tony stepped back he excused himself and go down to the workship.
Steve was really scared on Tony he wiped Tony’s tears and Tony kissed Steve’s hand .
Then two men came and they start beating him.
Kid was standing at the door, tears running down his face then he run to Tony and kneels beside him then he pressed his forhead on Tony’s hand and kept crying.
He hurts him alot . He just wished that Steve refused him from the start .
“No Bucky . Let him finish then you can murder him “ Tony said rolling his eyes.
And there stood a red haired woman she was smiling evilly at him.
He’ll break up with Thor . Thor is not responsible on him cause he got alot of troubles to think about it . And then it comes to his teammates. He’s thinking in leaving the tower for them . He can’t be with them anymore. And maybe someone will kill him and just have mercy on him to get him rid of this life .
After that he doesn't know how he fall a sleep.
he kept crying.
“I’m staying here . And if I hear anyone saying something bad to Tony I’ll make sure to kill him . understood?” Bucky asked and they nodded he smiled and left them .
“I wanna see how you look like . Come on “ He was talking to his wings and he smiled to himself he realized that he loved them before he know how they’re looking.
Tony stood and tried to stop himself but he fall to the ground and he was only shocked.
She lost a lot of blood ‘course she’ll pass out like that. The pain is killing him and he can’t do anything about it.
“What are you talking about? Of course I wasn’t avoiding you.”
Hands were everywhere.Too much skin. Tony gasped when Bruce bit him hard that he drowned blood from him, he pulled Bruce closer to him and he wanted them to go to bedroom better than this couch.
“They’re running away!” One of the guards shouts and  Clint shakes his head in disappointment.
When he was down he saw Sharon his eyes widened .
But she always worried about them all. He really missed her and  her violent behavior.
Bruce closed his eyes and tried to control his breath, why Tony was under him? And why they’re still sitting here?
“Well he need time to rest “ Bruce said closing the door behind him
Steve puts his arm around Peter’s shoulders and pulled him closer.
Thor let his hand slide through his hair and Tony ignored the desperate person in front of him.
“Hello mother fuckers !” Loki said grinning as he walked to set on the chair. Steve’s chair .
•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•
“He didn’t. I found out when he went missing for three days.” Rhodey said dryly.
Then Clint looked up at Thor who was still standing.
Thor was surprised like the others .
“B-but I’ve got work to do now-yeah..ok”
<———><———>
“You’re a whore “ Tony get closer to her and she was taking steps back .
“No....m’so-rry- ngh” Tony was confused only looking at Bruce who pushed Tony away.
“And I don’t know Peter anymore “ Tony said and Steve laughed and kissed Tony and Tony melted into the kiss
The door slide ioen and Sharon entered the room.
“No, d-don’t. Leave him.” They all can see how weak he’s now, and then Tony came and he was so angry they all can notice that.
“This is the nerd’s bed” Clint said and Loki ignored him.
"It's about Peter." Tony said and Loki can't blame the man for his shaking voice and body. He was so scared that he's the one who hurt his son.
“You? You of all people telling me this?! When was the last time you had taken a nap?” Bruce asked while he was pointing at him with his index finger and there’s something in Tony’s eyes, it’s different. He never saw it before and when Tony realized Bruce is searching for something he looked at the floor again, technically avoiding looking at Bruce.
Tony’s heart warmed he smiled to Bruce and hugged him .
He couldn’t make it though cause in a second Thor was in front of him.
She sits beside him and hold his hand in her hands .
He didn’t want Tony to see him like that. Tony definitely gonna tease him about it. Forever.
There he was alone and he couldn’t see anything.
“Sorry I scared you babe “ Tony said his voice as a whisper
And suddenly he was on the floor with his back pressed to what ever it was and someone was touching his face.
“PETER GOD DAMN ANSWER ME!” Tony started yelling at him but Peter was afraid that he’ll slap him or let Steve do his things with him instead.
“Y-yeah ...” Tony answered and he felt another warm kiss on his shoulder from behind then he realized that he’s shirtless he pulled his t-shirt and wear it .
"Where's he?" He hears Natasha and Clint from anither room.
“It’s ok ! it’s ok you’re here you’re with us “ Rhodey said and Tony finally looked at Steve
And Wanda she was like his daughter. even sometimes he’ll be hard on Vision just to treat her right .
But Thor nodded and hold Tony in the Bridel style.
Steve pulled Tony’s chin to force him looking into his eyes .
“Jarvis? Friday? I can’t believe you’re back!” His smile was genuinely happy.
What she's talking about? It's all he can think about,she's so Idiot! Everyone is in the tower and they could kill her without blinking, especially Natasha. And why she hates a super hero? She looks so young, how old is she? 20? 22? There's alot of ideas running through his head right now and he was pulled out of it by her talking,
“Tony I’m sorry about what I said earlier. I was angry and I put the blame on you while you were already injured.. OH SHIT! You’re still injured!” Natasha pushed him to the couch and took off his shirt. His eyes widened then he smirked.
“Sir I’m going to call Captain Rogers.”
“No one has to kill me . No one had to keep me busy and distracted. I don’t love when I’m being like a wall between lovers! I love you Steve but I can’t see with her anymore “ he was crying harder with every word . And he cut his wrists.
Tony doesn’t know why he stood and go to them.
Tony and Steve were so busy kissing each other to not even hear them
Thor smiles.
Tony just wanted to hide himself in Steve’s chest.
Tony walked back to his stool and Natasha was sitting beside Bruce
This time when the door was opened, Frost couldn't move away from him, so she saw them. Her eyes hardened at them once she saw them.
Tony felt like he’s talking with a kid and not a growing man. Clint was scared and Nick Fury was a bitch! And the one who was abusing Clint is in the jail!
For now there’s no breakfast and the last time he didn’t make breakfast he was burned in his hand and of course cause Clint was in bad mood so he just slammed Peter’s head into the table, and then he was making breakfast for them while he’s bleeding.
Bruce was red now, he looked at Tony and answered him “I-.. It was before this accident and I stopped having sex. Who’ll want to make sex with me anyway?” He shrugged and looked at Tony down him and Tony was blushing. Bruce rises his eyebrow.
Wanda look at her teammates faces they were all feeling guilty and so is she.
He entered the room and Tony was so busy working on A new suit. Steve can guess it was for Peter.
Tony rolled his eyes his family could never be so good or just fine like the others family.
Of course Natasha was more important than him, after all he was the last favorited one so this is what he should do and he did.
Just remembering the day when Tony gets back from Titan . He has to admit that day he was so much happy to see Tony’s a live. And Tony cried between his arms omce he saw him and that’s warmed Steve’s heart .
“Friday? Jarvis?”
“Sections 4 never get closer to them. They’re so damn bastards. They like to make a lot of troubles to section 1 and 2 wich mean our sections “
Steve stepped forward for him and he wrapped his arms around Tony protectively. He just kept him close to him.
He was just sitting and enjoying the peaceful silence.
••**••**••**••**••
When They finish Steve left Tony and go to change his clothes and leave .
He sitted on his chair in their room .
He couldn’t blame them and he will never do.
He closed his eyes and fall a sleep.
“Yeah .. Thanks FRIDAY” Steve said
Peter nodded his head slowly and he felt a kiss on his forhead.
“Hey Peter it’s ok breath.. Just breath, no, no! Peter calm down sweetheart,” Bruce voice make it worde some how.
“You told him about what happened between the three of us?” Steve finally spoke and it was like he got betrayed.
...............................
He go to the room where his teammates are .
“Tony you’re not alone we will be with you no matter what ! Don’t think about Steve and the rest of the avengers all you have to think about is to control your self and stay with us “ Bruce said smiling widely to Tony and Tony matched Bruce’s smile .
“I need you Steve. I love you” He Kissed Steve’s lips and when he stood to leave he saw Natasha with clint standing at the door looking at him.
“Just tell me if you want someone to fuck you ! You’re a whore Tony ! You let everyone fucking you even your father . I’ve seen so much dirty people but you’re new . You’re the worst. You’re just a trash . I’ll make you feel better...”
When he woke up from a nightmare, his body was full of bandages. Tony came out and thought everyone was asleep but he was surprised to find them all sitting .
“We’re glad to see you Peter.” The two AI replies in the same time and damn if they were human he’s sure they’re having tears in their eyes now.
“Tony we need to be together to get out of this trouble “ Steve said and Tony nodded before he pass out
“Tony please breath !” Thor was pleading him to breath and Tony noticed that he was facing Thor now and He wasn’t breathing.
He looked up to see Natasha reloading her gun and someone was about to shot her, he couldn’t let that happen no matter what. So he did the one thing in his mind, sacrificing himself.
"Pops?" Steve hummed and Peter continued
“Steve?” He called him but Steve couldn’t hear him .
He closed his eyes to gather himself. He wanted to shout at her and tell her that he tried to kill him self, but nothing happened.
Sharon sit in his lap and kissed him infront them all .
He started writing for Ross and the governments to let them forgive the Avengers and somedays he can’t sleep cause he’ll be traveling from country to other.
He was ... He was taller than before. He was prettier than before. His manly beard that Tony wanted to touch. And his blue eyes ...
He entered the car and it was hurting him seeing his father controlling him and he was just like a doll in his parents’s hands .
Now he needs to feel the presence of at least one of them To tell him that this is not his fault and that they will find a solution, but they should not give up.
"Hey Pete. How was your day?" Bucky asked him and wrapped his arms around Peter's shoulders.
Number four 4
“Everyone cut the chitchat now. Go to your rooms or do what ever you want. Rhodey come with me. Loki go outside and try to calm your ass down!” He breathed deeply and left them all shocked.
“Take off your t-shirt please?” Loki asked and Tony took tome before nodding and he started taking it off.
“Glad to see you alive Tones.” It’s dings in Tony’s head this is the voice who was talking to him.
the grab around his wrist tightened, he closed his eyes focusing on everything but pain.
And Steve couldn’t go back to sleep he was thinking about the man between his arms . Tony did everything for him . Tony sacrificed himself just for Steve. He even chooses him on that wizard. But now here he was cheating on him because of a fucking mission.
He’s going to give on Tony . He was never enough for Tones . He loves him but Tony deserves one more beautiful and stronger and even someone richer tham Steve .
Just because of Sharon everything is change.
“If something happened to him I swear by my life that I’ll make sure to drink all your blood!” He warned her and she started crying. He rolled his eyes. Again she’s going to act like she’s the victim here and he’s the guilty one.
Tony smiled and nodded
“Seriously Steve? in our room? in our bed ? You’re saying these words to her ?” he shaked his head in disappointment.
Another 5 minuets won’t hurt anyone, right?
“I’ll leave you to rest ok Tony?” Steve smiled and get off Tony and closed the door behind him
Thor didn't apologized about what happened.
He walked to the beer that’s was on the shelves.
He was laying on his stomach when the door was opened.
“I love you “ Steve said to Sharon who kissed him .
D : Do not trust anyone.
“Sooo Loki ! I need a word with you “ Tony smiled to Loki just nodded to him .
“HYDRA are having a new project “ she said when he was kissing her neck he looked at her
Steve had left him in the time when he needed Steve the most . He doesn’t want to forget Steve but Steve is the one who’s forcing him to get over him .
“When your friend Ted-” Peter cutted him.
Peter lifted his head to look at Tony and Tony smiled when he saw Peter’s puppy eyes
“You know what Tony? You know why I can’t forgot what happened? Because I was scared, I was broken and I was alone. The worst part I wake up every night cold eating me and I can’t do anything about it. You were always warm and what ever you need was in front of you. You could never be a hero no matter what Tony. You’re worthless.” Tony freezes and closed his eyes and Steve hand was touching Tony’s nipple and Tony ignored the pain in his heart and focused on Steve’s pain instead.
"Stop! Do not try to touch me again!" Tony felt dizzy again but this time Thor reached him before he could fall andTony was very grateful.
“Tony I know why you’re doing this “ Thor kept looking at the ground and Tony sit beside him .
“Anyway after that Everyone will get out of the spell and when Tony the idiot realized what he did, he’ll kill him self and after that it’ll lead Thor and everyone else to be in the prison forever cause they cannot forgive their selfs about it.” She sighed and continued “And Steve will be alone and broken just like the avengers.” she finished and Peter’s tears were falling again and he’s the one who thought he doesn’t have any tears left.
“I know you love him Tony . I can’t do it . Just when you get rid of your feelings for Steve in this time I’ll do it with you “ Thor replied and still hadn’t looked at him .
"U-uncle Thor???" His voice was shaking.
"Stop running Tony!" But Tony didn’t  stop and Thor also.
“Look there’s 10 sections as you see the base is big. In every section there’s 30 one
The door of his room opened and Sharon entered in he closed his eyes and she thought that he’s sleeping so she slept beside him and hugged him but he couldn’t hug her back cause he was thinking in Tony .
“They know about us babe “ She said and kissed him again
“Oh god ! My SHOE !” and everyone was arguing again
“I’ll go talk to him.” Natasha says and Peter wiped his tears away. He shakes his head, he wanted to tell them that Tony’s right and he can do what ever he wants to Peter, but the words dies in his mouth.
In the next morning he was hoping it was only just a dream but the pain in his body nah it's already another thing.
"What a funny guy!" Tony was chuckling and then his face got serious, he never saw him like that- damn he neversaw his father mad like that even when he's fighting evils he'll always be calm but now? This is not his dad! No way! "You're going to pay for me and you know how?" He stepped harder and receive a sob from Peter. This man is just merciless while the real Tony is kind and lovely he'll never step with his shoe on someone helpless! "You're going to work like the little slave you're and when I think you've done enough I'll leave you." Tony says to him and Peter was shocked (Slave!? Seriously??).
They started eating and no one of them dared to speak a word.
“They’re coming” And like that he fall on Tony who tried his best to hold Stephan.
“What are we going to do?” she asked him and he sighed
“Sharon started to lose her trust in you “ Natasha said still looking at her coffee.
Everything wasn’t helping him. It was freezing here in Kazakhstan and everything was white because of the snow. He sighed and kept walking.
The time had passed he saw Sharon calling him multiple times and he ignored her .
“I don’t know Nat “ she hugged him cause he was about to broke down .
"Yeah, whatever. I'm going to kill you and send your body to them." She sing song it and befor he can open his mouth to piss her off more, she lifted him with her power and hits him to the wall.
“W-what was that ?” Steve asked looking into Tony’s eyes
“He told me that he knows that you’re half angle and half a demon and he wanted to make you break up so when you die no one will feel sad on you or the captain won’t get weak after you know..” Tony tsk and stood he run his hand in his hair, He was so nervous how could they do that to him?
Peter's death was because of him. The death of everyone because of him .
“Stop please! Your tears shouldn’t fall on people like Steve and Sharon?! You’re strong Tony you don’t need them “ Bucky’s heart was broken because of what Steve did to Tony .
Loki swallows and continued
and suddenly the fight started in the middle of the cafeteria.
“ I’m not doing this because you take Steve from me .. No , I’m doing this cause you go to the best part in mylife ... Peter. Yeah you bitch you’re just a trash I don’t care about you ... Seriously find something better instead of destroying happy lifes . huh what a whor-“ He was slapped by no one except Steve.
"It's ok.. You didn't mean to chock me twice, I get it."
He can’t see Steve only in nights cause no one is there beside him so he’ll just sit beside him and run his fingers in Steve’s hair or hold Steve’s hand between his hands or kissing Steve’s cheek.
"She just thinking that we're going to be a family." He never stopped playing with the kid's hair.
He did not see any of them after what happened in Siberia.
Tony turned to see who was here but Steve pushed him and slammed him into the wall .
“Yeah ?” Tony was to busy that he didn’t even bothered himself to see who entered and was standing behind him .
“Dad! Uncle Loki wants to get inside my head!” He couldn’t finish what he’s saying cause Loki already start seeing what happened.
“There was three angels and three demons broke the law of the heaven and hell . Your mother and father was from them . So the other angels and demons were killed. No one left except your mother and father and they bringed you to the life . Your mother told her sister to put a spell on you to stay a human. After that your parents had died .” Loki said looking at Tony and seeing how he’s connecting the things together while Bucky was hugging Tony tight to tell him that he was here for him and he shouldn’t be scared.
“Thor, I trust you to keep him safe this week. I’ll come back with them and I’ll make sure no one says bad word to him.”  Rhodey said and Thor’s head turns to look at his brother who was playing with his knife now.
Loki laidback with them and he used Tony’s chest as his pillow as well.
Steve tried to catch him again but Tony distanced himself.
Quill smirked and walked to Tony.
"Thor can you just fly him? I don't think he can make it if he stays any longer like that!" He doesn't care how much he sounds so miserable even to his own ears, but Tony got shots! They're talking about Tony.
“I’m not a kid !” Peter moved and pushed Bucky and Bucky stumbled and pressed on Loki’s shoe
Tony giggled and puts food for both of them. They sitted together eating peacefully and with Bruce talking about some projects and Tony looking at him smiling and nodding.
This time their friends clapped for them .
He turned slowly and saw Tony.
He stood and left broken
“Yes Nick ?” Steve used his soldier voice
"You're going to be ok, darling. Please, stay with me?" Tony shook his head and Steve frowns.
He left her shock behind him. When he reached the door she called him.
Peter kept sobbing and crying he can’t feel safe anymore and Tony won’t blame him .
"Peter take care of your self. I know it's going to hurt you when you tell them but you have to do it." Stephan cupped Peter face with his hands and Peter nodded to his uncle.
Steve smiled and looked at the floor
What Steve did was totally wrong cause Tony was crying and screaming and he was trying to get himself free .
“Steve what happened?! you were afraid from the cold air if he touched Tony ?!” Bucky asked and Steve sighed .
Tony sits up and Steve sighed, he should search his son, but he can't leave Tony alone while he's like that. "Babe, I promise I'll bring him back to you and let hi rest between your hands" Tony just shakes his head and tries to stood but he fell to the ground.
He locked the door behind him . He stood infront of the table he put his hands on the table to support him . Everything was spinning. He closed his eyes and inhaled . The tears start falling.
"How many bases in russia?" He asks with his captain's voice.
A : Do not engage with the bullies!
"Come on, let's go." He helped Peter up and start walking outside and killing Hydra's soldiers without blinking. Peter was looking at Frost with wide eyes filled with love.
He looked at his wrists there was nothing. he was sure that he cutted them . He was breathless. Who was this guy ? And What happened?
I love you , take care of your self.
“Tony, what are you talking about? Peter what’s going on?” Steve was on his feet now, Peter was trying to avoid looking at them. After all it was bad idea to come here, he should be in his bed now.
“Tony do you want to sleep in my room with me? I-I don’t feel good with letting you out of my sight today.” Tony chuckled and hugged Bruce a quick hug.
Tony sitted Peter on the couch beside Bruce and turned to face Sharon .
“Fuck off Quill we don’t want any troubles!” Clint snapped at him wich lead to the one who called Quill pushing him to the floor.
"Oh, what are you going to do about it? I've done a lot and yet... it's nothing compared with what your dad did to me!" Her power was filling the place again.
“My brother is kinda a bitch ok ? But in the same time he’s so kind “ Thor was telling Steve about Loki for the million times .
“Ugh ! Fuck ! Any other idea mr sexy voice ?!” Tony hide his face in his hands and slept on the bad .
No one care about him ? Why he’s still a live?
How's he supposed to tell them about what happened.
“Sorry that I was so busy to call you baby. And I’ll be more sorry to tell you that they accept your request. After 1 week the avengers are coming back.”
They were eating when Tony’s thoughts come to him .
“Nothing..” Bruce said
He missed Jarvis. He missed Rhodey. He missed Pepper and Hogan.
"What's the plan?" He asked because he didn’t want to go deeper with Steve and did not want to be hurt again.
Tony hugged him and kissed Steve he hugged him as if Steve will leave and go back to Sharon .
I know it wasn’t good but I tried my best. I hope I didn’t disappoint anyone. :)
They left him on the ground bleeding and maybe Clint broke his arm.
“ I’m not responsible about what happened I swear. Please believe me. Steve?” She asked Steve’s help. He’ll stand for her of course and Tomy knew it. They’re so fake. He can’t do this anymore.
Why ?
“Yes wong?...oh? now?” He looked at Peter and Peter sighed.
But the the third time they had sex its surprised him . He was sitting on his chair next to the window when she entered their room Tony’s room ! And they had sex on their bed ! On Tony’s bed !
Once Steve was out of Tony’s sight he leaned on the wall .
“Then I guess I’ve to stay with Peter?” Stephan said smiling to Peter and Peter smiled back.
Thanks for your comments and kudos <3!
Tony was looking at Peter between his arms
He sighed and moved so now he was laying his head on Stephan's thigh, he closed his eyes again when Stephan started brushing his hair.
“Can I come in?”
"You're just a foundling. Tell me who you are?"
“Actually... yeah you will if you can’t control your self “ Thor said and Loki nodded to him .
“Then tell us baby, I promise you if you wanted to tell only Tony then I’m ok with that we just want to help you.” Steve was calm instead of panicking like Tony.
“So we’re good?” Nick asked him
He was moving his hands, so when did they untie him? He looked around him. No one was here just him and Frost, while he was sleeping on the floor with gis head resting on Frost's thigh.
“T-thank you.” When Peter’s voice comes out like a whisper, Stephan hugged him closer to his chest.
He heard an explosion outside and that’s what’s stopped the guards from beating him again.
“I-..I need to breath, please?” Peter says or better say whisper but Steve heard him and let go of him slowly.
Thor kept slamming Peter’s head against the wall until Peter was breathing hardly and he passed out and Thor slammed him for the last time then left him.
Tony closed the door slowly and his whole body was shaking he went to the elevator and go to his lab .
Tony’s tears start falling and he go to take a shower then the door opened and Steve entered the bathroom Tony wanted to hide his wounds but he was too late .
“Tony, you need to sleep and I need to sleep too.” Thor smiled to Tony and Tony nodded to him.
“Oh my god ! We’re so idiots but thank you guys “ Tony said
Thor smirked and left Tony slowly .
“With who you were talking?” Thor asked and Tony laughed and he knows that he sounds like a crazy one but he doesn’t care .
Steve never hold his hand like that when they’re eating. Why Steve doing this to him ? why everyone doing this to him ? Of course he did something wrong so they’re acting like that . He should ask FRIDAY about it . He looked at them to see Sharon whispering in Steve’s ear and She was half hugging Steve’s arm and Steve was laughing. He can let him laugh he can love him more . Why can’t he see that ? Why Steve is so blind to not see Tony’s love for him ? Why everyone chose Sharon on him ?
They all were talking and Tony was looking at them . How could they do this to him after all he did to them ?
“Beautiful “ Loki said and kissed Tony’s neck “Perfect “ Tony pushed Loki away and Loki chuckled and winked to him .
“Steve you’re the only one who could do this mission “ Nick said and Steve nodded but he doesn’t know what mission he meant .
He sighed and turned around “Let him in J."
Tony doesn’t know when he starts shaking and all of his teammates were around him .
with what Bucky said Tony pushed Steve away from him . He could take all the bad news but Nothing about Peter. Peter’s like his own son and now he was about to get killed?!
Fin<3
They took him to the hospital and were waiting outside.
“You’re such a pathetic creature!” Thor pulled his hair and slammed his head to the wall and Peter was sure there’s blood from his head on the wall.
Bruce was really a good bro
Everyone notices the tension in the room. "I wanna go home."
“We have to end this war before it’s happens!” Vision continued and Tony was confused what war they’re saying about .
“Congrats “ Tony said to them and it’s sounds faker.
“No Nat.” He points at his chest and continued, “This mess in my chest, it’s my fault. I don’t take care of myself. I wasn’t mad when she said frankenstein to me.”
“Tony ? What’s wrong ?” Natasha asked she was really worried about him like the others they were looking at him
there’s people will share the room with him? He hoped Loki will share the room with him.
Then Steve came and did not make any difference whether he fell in love with this man who reminded him of his father when he told him you are a loser .
The next thing he knows that he’s been shoved away.
“Bring him to me.” Sharon ordered them and they run towards him.
He kissed Steve’s lips softly and smiled to Steve.
Clint sighed in relief and let the sleep take him away.
He remembered Tony had dizzied a lot today so he decided to do the guards and let Tony rest for a while.
“You know what it feels to lost your best friend in the middle of the war? You know what it feels to see your friend’s face and calling your name to save him, but you fail? You know when you promise the love of your life a dance but you sleep for 70 years? No you don’t know because you don’t have friends and you never know how to love someone.” Tony was about to beg him to stop, he didn’t need someone to remind him of that, but only if they knew that his childhood was a torture for him. He moans when Steve bites his shoulder and makes it bleed. Steve left Tony’s wrists and they were bruised from Steve’s hand. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck for support.
<————><————>
"You think that's it's all about you right? But no believe me we don't care about you and we told you to take Bruce and leave not because you're injured... No it's because you'll slow us down and that's the last thing we wanted." Tony's head turned to look at Natasha while she spoke and he doesn't want to believe that's coming out of her.
He stood and left them .
“You should have see how he believed in me! Oh my god! He is such a fool!” Steve was laughing hard and Peter was watching them with horror in his eyes.
“If they want to hurt him again, then they’ll regret their choice.” Loki says and Rhodey sighed in relief.
“Seriously Thor ?” He sighed but still laughing.
“ And so he is “ Steve said looking at Tony
Why ?
Suddenly everything came back to his mind. The punches, the metal arm pulling his arc reactor and the shield in his chest. The hands that touching his body and rap- He pushed Bruce away and hide himself with his arms. They’ll hurt him of course, Steve sent them to do this or Ross told them to rape him so he could get information from him. He felt a strong hand on his shoulder and he jolted away.
“Hey Tones, how are you baby?” He asked Tony who nodded to him.
••**••**••**••**••
He felt his legs couldn’t hold him anymore .
“Hey .. It’s ok . You hadn’t cheated on me ok ? I know that Thor was in love with you . And I just was about to end the things between me and Thor “ Bruce hugged Tony tight and Tony patted his back .
He was injured and Steve told him to go back, but of course he can't leave the team alone.
Peter couldn’t cry anymore even when he was about to get raped his first few tears drop and then there’s no tears at all.
•••••••••••••
After all he can’t tell them even if they’re already remembered what happened.
“As you can see I’m angel,” Tony snorted but the man ignored him and continued. “If you want us to have mercy on you and let you die then you have to give your wings to them.” He smiled politely to Tony who was laughing now.
"You know I'm going to tell uncle Loki, right?" He starts giggling again.
She decided to hurt Peter after hurting him and taking Steve from him and also taking his teammates.
Tony wakes up because Thor was biting his neck .
“Peter baby? Open your eyes and talk to me, please?” Tony says softly whispering to him like there’s no one in the kitchen just the two of them.
“Fuck off bitch.” Tony smirked when the man’s eyes widened.
“I’ll tell you . B-but promise me you won’t go and fight with her or with Steve or with anyone else?” Tony said looking at Bucky face and Bucky nodded .
Loki putted his head between Tony’s shoulder and neck . Tony stopped breathing.
He is not going to ask why this is happening to him cause he knows that it’s like there’s a curse on him. He’ll be sad to the rest of his life.
"In his room, Bucky stayed with him. Natasha and Clint in Shield, while Loki and Thor are back in asgard."
There were only inches between them and the last time that’s happened he remembered it was painful, Steve using his shield against his son was a bad memory for Peter.
He started wearing his clothes as well and then he left to his lab.
“You know what I’m talking. You won’t get anything by giving the hottest news to Hydra cause you know that I’ll always stand in your face “
Tony wiped his tears away and took deep breath then he wanted to forget his son situation.
...........................
Peter couldn’t hear what they’re saying anymore, they were yelling at eachother. The only one who was silent was him. Everyone in the room was yelling and there’s sounds of punch and he curled on himself. He just wanted everyone to just shut up and let it go.
Tony is better, he is talking normal again, but he still walks on shaking legs. His hands are shaking too, but it’s better than nothing.
Tony had suffered alot but he’ll always smile. He’ll always laugh . He’ll always tell jokes about himself to make them laugh.
Tony was in his bedroom. He was sitting on the end of the bed . He looked at Steve’s side and remembered Thor’s words . Why Thor said this words to him ? He never showed that he’s interested in Tony until now ? What happened? And why Steve was jealous on him ? He keeps cheating on him and then he’ll be jealous on him ? That’s ridiculousness !
"Don't leave me alone Steve. Please, no again." Loki was shocked to see Tony broken like that, not lol at anything tears run down his cheeks and his voice was a whisper and the worst he was asking Steve to not leave him.
"Peter!" It was Steve's sound. They turned all to see him.
“Good . What about you Buck ?” Tony asked and Bucky kissed Tony’s cheek.
In the end he was really happy to have Bruce with him .
"There's three bases Captain, We should check them and then we're going to search the bases in russia." Natasha filled him in.
“Burn who ?” Thor asked narrowed his eyes at his brother.
God he just hoped that someone will kill him and end this shit.
He was happy because he won’t be able again to see Steve with Sharon.
He was pulled out of his thoughts because of Sharon cause she was tugging his hair.
they finish eating and he followed Steve when he go to see Natasha .
(See the end of the chapter for
He tried to move but he was chained to the wall.
“ I hate you brother!” Loki shooted back
He has saved his life but in return now he is on the bed. He's supposed to be on the bed and not Steve. Why does this always happen with him? Why didn’t Steve leave him to die ?
Finally Ross was between their hands. Rhodey was away from Tony for more than two weeks. He was trying to take Ross down. The truth is they couldn’t take him down so they’ll kill him and say that he killed him self. But Steve said that Tony is the one who should kill him and Rhodey agreed with that.
ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
He went to Peter room and it was empty. l
Bucky offers a hand to him and Peter took it he stood only to be forced back to the wall, his hands were above his head and he looked at Bucky confused.
And when he fucked him Tony was pleading that Steve will turn him to face him and Tell Tony how much he loves him but Steve just Kept fucking him hard and not caring if he’s hurting Tony
"Hey Pete."
Thanks for reading guys ! in the next chapter we’ll back to Tony and we’ll involve Loki in the next chapter! Please support me with your comment and kudos! Love you all hope you enjoyed! muah .*Be ready for a new supernatural in the next chapter xD*
He was trying to control himself and he pushed Steve from him .
“Thanks Nat.” Tony thanked her and she ruffled his hair.
Clint's eyes widened in horror, all things clicked into his head.
Steve, Thor and Natasha were so mad at him, but Natasha didn't say anything and so is Thor. Steve was scolding him and Tony can't accept The great captain America talking to him like that in front of a lot cameras.
“Bruce? Really help me to stood first.”He tried to drop it starting by helping him to stood And they did.He leaned on Thor and they walked to the midic wing.
“A-Are you ok ? “ Steve asked looking at the ground and Tony smiled to him .
“What happened?” Tony asked and he was
And everyone was shocked
“No he’s not!” A voice made them all look at the door where a man was standing. Damn it he was so scary.
"Thanks, Thor." He turns his head and looked down at Peter who was sleeping now. Thor kneeled and picked Peter, Steve nods his thanks to Thor, who puts Peter on the sofa.
Is he dead?
But he's so friendly with the winter soldier. What caused him to show up?
“What’s wrong captain? And it’s like you care about me?” Tony asked leaning back to the chair he was sitting on.
He lost everything. At least he could forgive Steve and return friends. Damn him and his delight!
“My aunt?! I have aunt ?” Tony asked his heart was about to jump out from his chest .
It’s seems Stephan is talking to him but Peter couldn’t hear him.
He was looking at himself and he was beating his own son! Peter was pleading him to stop, but he was too busy hurting his son. He can’t see himself slapping or punching or even kicking Peter. And the worst part Peter wasn’t stopping him, he was bleeding and when he see himself stopped he sighed in relief, but of course Tony was shocked to see himself pulling Peter from his hair and dragging him god knows where!
“I’ll fuck you Tones “
Once they were alone Tony sighed heavily.
Tony just killed her?
Once he was sure that he was alone he stood and go back to his lab .
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked back at Tony and leaned down to kiss his forehead.
“You’re going to push Stark away from you cause we all know that he doesn’t like to share you even when it’s a mission!” Nick said and Steve can feel his heart is aching but he nodded again .
<————><————><————>
“She wanted to cut them with her knife.” His voice was as a whisper and Steve sighed.
“Haha you idiots! come on I’m the strongest avenger!” Tony was singing it
"Peter! Breath sweetheart!" Bruce catches him and pulled him to his chest. He kept whispering everything and nothing in his ears until Peter fall a sleep between his arms.
Tony started wearing the clothes they gave to him.
Tony is innocent, he would give everything to the others and he did. Friday showed them what he said about the company and the compound and it was all bullshit cause he’s the one who should be having them and not what he called them family. God! He was seeing them as his family and they screwed up everything.
'What I was thinking when I trusted them now?' He sighed and started working and dealing with the damage in his suit.
Clint was mouthing “No No!” Over and over, but Tony ignored him and he wishes he didn’t ignore Clint.
Today is the day. He’s standing in front of them all. Rhodey by his side. He received glares from everyone, but he ignored it.
God, help him. There's no way his parents are going to find him. Especially when his dad's in the hospital. Is he ok?
“I’m sorry “ And Peter despaired
"Tony, breathe, you're safe here, no one can touch you." Nebula was trying to calm him down, He smiled to her .
He closed his eyes to prevent the tears. He was so weak near to Steve and this is wrong.
The winter soldier kept brushing petting his hair and it did nothing to comfort him, cause he's in a cold room and feeling pain inside his chest. Where's everyone else? If Bucky is here of course the others are here, but in another rooms maybe?
and There was a silent
He took the paper and someone had written to him a message by the blood.
She was right. But yet calling him a whore it’s reminding him of what happened back there. It’s reminds him of their filthy hands on him. It’s reminds him of their whispers.
He looked at the guards when they gave him their back, he moved and Clint’s eyes widened.
"There! There! In this file." Steve entered the place and found The guy's head on the table while Natasha holding the gun to his head and Clint just watching.
"Nothing. He's already taking, and if his boyfriend saw you, he'll kill you." He smirked when she rolled her eyes.
“Guys can you please give me your attention?” Steve asked grinning and Tony looked at him confused.
Sharon was his real nightmare.
“You bitch.” She pulled harder for what he said to her.
It's been a week and he got scolded in front of everyone because he didn't tell Clint that he was shot. Then he got grounded and he was shocked.
He kept locking himself until the night come he was worried if he’ll go to his room he’ll find Steve with sharon he sighed and asked FRIDAY
It’s hurt hearing those things from Steve, but he deserves it in the end. If making sex with him make Steve calm down then he’ll go for it. If it’s make Steve feel better then he’ll go for it. He broke the kiss to breath and Steve started kissing his neck and he moans softly when Steve started leaving his own mark on Tony. Steve was holding Tony’s wrist above Tony’s head in one hand while the other was opening the first bottoms of his shirt and again they were kissing.
“Yes sir ?”
"I - I can work and pay you?" Peter suggested for him and Tony smirked and stepped on Peter, his shoe was on Peter's chest and Peter's tears were running down his face.
“Shut up Buck ! Any way Tony I’m here to tell you that I know why it showed right now . You know what I mean “ Loki said and took a deep breath
"Me and Romanov in the right wing. Clint and Thor in the left. Loki you're going to try and reach Peter and Bucky. And Avengers... kill'em all." Just once they were in positions, the Ironman suit with a tired Bruce showed up.
he whimpers and he was trying to get himself free from his dad’s grips and they start shoving him from one to another, he was pleading them to stop.
“Come on Brucie Bear!” and like that Tony leads them out the lab.
Tony walked to him and kissed him . Thor’s eyes widened. but his back was to the others they couldn’t see him .
He was all alone even though Steve was begging him everyday to eat something and he'll ignore him.
"Th-thor.. I swear to you it was the lack of sleep and food that's caused the tear to fall.. I-.. I'm ok I swear to yo-" Thor shushed him and Tony closed his eyes.
"We don't treat our prisoners like this, soldier. Or are we going soft?"
Steve was looking at Tony seeing how much he’s beautiful even when his face is so tired and scared like that . He was about to kiss Tony and say sorry to him but once he saw the heickies in Tony’s neck he forgot everything.
He jumped in front of her and pushed her and the bullet was near to his stomach.
Tony wakes up to Jarvis’s voice, he tried to breath but he couldn’t. He stood on his shaking legs and the bed was empty Steve is not here.
Tony would be lying if he said that he didn’t felt safe.
Tony stood beside Steve he was looking at him
"So we all saw it, right?" Tony asked and again his voice was shaking. Who are they to judge him?
“Sir someone hacked the system and turned me off I’m sorry that I don’t know who did this “ FRIDAY replied to him and he hide his face in his hands .
