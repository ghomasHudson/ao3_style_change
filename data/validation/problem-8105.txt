“Steve,” he whispers, pushing the bedroom door further open. “
Five more minutes pass.
Okay so Steve clearly knows about his alone time in the bathroom but he’s a
“Okay, talk to me,” he says.
Arto thinks about it. “Can you tell him for me? I don’t mind him knowing but I don’t wanna...saying it out loud is making me tired.”
“Calm down,” Steve said, using his soothing
“No,” Arto lies, even though he’s a little scared about just how real that nightmare was. It’s never been that bad before. “I’m okay.”
And the anger is swelling, growing stronger, nastier. Violence itches right under his skin. “That’s it? Just okay?”
Oh shit, they’re getting loud. And Arto’s confused and annoyed and angry too but he cannot deal with anymore fighting, he’s had enough and he just wants everything to go back to normal. If Steve heads back towards the Tesla, Arto will be throwing himself over the hood because they are
“Yeah, Steve,” Arto says.
Steve nods, runs a hand over Arto’s sweaty hair. “How about I stay here until you fall asleep again?” he says.
out,” Bucky says. “Apparently he owns a mansion upstate?”
It's not a no, which Arto recognises and appreciates. But still, he’s not earned the label of argumentative for nothing.
“So, you got papped,” Tony says by way of greeting. “TMZ say that hot pink is totally not your colour.”
He creeps out of his room, intending to go fetch a glass from the kitchen. He gets as far as the lounge and stops in the doorway because Steve in there, sitting on the couch with his phone to his ear. He’s leaning forwards with his elbows on his knees, head ducked low-
the deal.”
Arto’s stomach goes cold. “Work?” he asks, coughing around the wet, closed up feeling in his nose and throat.
“Tee!” she says, pointing over his shoulder.
He leaves the grossness and goes to find Bucky. Anna reaches for him so Arto gladly takes her, her weight a familiar comfort in his arms.
“Guh,” she whispers back, eyes big and wide like’s surprised at the quietness.
“It doesn't matter if any character is a boy or a girl, but yes. I think he'll make an excellent pumpkin,” Natasha says, and leans back against Steve. He loops an arm around her shoulders, gives her a grateful squeeze. “Shall we ask your dads if we can go find your outfit this afternoon?”
“Don’t make a point!”
Arto pulls back, not because he really wants to let Steve go but more because he wants to start reading. As he does he spots another bag by Steve’s feet. “More books?”
Steve’s thumb hovered above the call button. “Maybe?”
“No.”
“You always give me the whole, be proud of who you are, thing.”
“Where are we going?”
“You can. We’re meant to be best friends.”
“Like how Peter isn't texting you back? Are you sure you don’t have a crush on him?”
“Okay,” Arto says, taking a deep breath. “But...can we do something...less obvious?”
On the TV screen, Tony takes the phone away from his ear and leans back towards the camera. “What do you know, he got my message.”
“Sure.”
“Steve!”
Arto regains his footing, seizes Peter around the middle and hugs him so tight he lifts him off the floor. Peter yelps and it’s only then that Arto realises that Omari is there too, grinning widely and bouncing on his heels.
Steve sits on a stool next to his chair, just like Natasha did all that time ago. He seems very at ease, like going with his son to have his nails done is something he does every other Tuesday. He’s not even wearing his baseball cap and sunglasses, which he normally does when he doesn’t want to be spotted. He’s just sitting there, watching Arto swap his pink glittery gel polish for a bright blue, tapping away on his phone.
He barely notices the shock on Tony’s face. “What, Parker isn’t talking to you? Since when?”
challenge. Bucky sighs and concedes, though does reach out to brush his metal fingers over Clint's shoulder.
Arto kind of needs him to stop mentioning Tony’s name. He thinks it’d do them both good right now.
“Oh please tell me you didn’t,” Steve despairs, as Tony is clapping his hands over Arto’s ears and hissing, “Not in front of the brat!”
“Call me if you need anything,” he says and then he’s gone, pushing Anna’s stroller towards departures. He gets about five steps before he’s about turning, grinning sheepishly as he retrieves his boarding pass from Steve. He salutes - which Anna does her best to copy and it’s so cute that Arto could cry - and then they really are gone.
Arto walks away. And the worst thing is, Tony doesn’t even come after him.
“Charms!” he gasps, and pours out the bowl. He looks around wildly, and then before anyone can say anything he lunges at Bucky, scrambling up onto his knee and nearly bashing him in the face with the box that he’s still holding into.
“Right. First of all, don’t you say that,” Steve says to Arto, who scowls and twists into Steve;s side, wedging his face between Steve’s ribs and the couch. “Second, you need to slow down and tell me what actually happened.”
“No. They were being nosey about why I was taking you out of the state but I guess their job is to worry about you,” Steve says, pulling open the refrigerator. “You want juice?”
Opening his mouth to pitch the idea to Steve, he doesn’t get a word out before Tony’s beating him to it.
Bucky looks him right in the eye with that laser focus he has. It’s unnerving. “Look, I’m sorry you’ve been dealt another curveball, another thing that you’re gonna have to fight for,” he says seriously. “But honestly, you’re a Rogers, you’re built for fighting. Just pick your battles.”
see me then they’ll think something and I like
“No,” Nick says. “Definitely not.”
“I am going to knock you out,” Steve says flatly. “In five, four-”
“No, I want to be normal,” Arto says, choked up.
“I told you, parents don’t go to school, that’s just lame,” Tony calls, walking over to smack a kiss onto Arto’s cheek. “We stay here and tidy up the mess you made, ready for you to make a brand new mess when you get home.”
“Where are we going?” he asks.
“I can’t just drop everything-”
He wakes up the next morning feeling groggy and unsettled after a night of broken sleep, brief catnaps punctuated by strange dreams about a weird white room, the ground trembling beneath his hands and the smell of smoke on the air. He ignores it and drags himself through the shower before heading to find breakfast. Just like Clint said, the tree and decorations are gone, and it reminds him that the holidays are nearly over; four more days and he’s back at school. The very thought makes him feel sick because on Thursday he’s supposed to be back at Midtown and that means facing up to Peter who now hates him.
So, this is what people mean when an event is like a car crash in slow motion. Arto watches as Steve finds his phone and hits speed dial. Eight hundred miles away, and with only the slightest lag in the feed, Tony at the gala abruptly stops listening to the reporter and picks up his phone.
Arto puts his head down on Steve’s pillow. “I’m in bed.”
As soon as he threw it forward against Tony’s shoulders, he knew Tony recognized the soft fall of the white leather against his skin, because he smiled to himself, closed his eyes, and relaxed into it.  Steve smiled at that, too, a little touched at the response, skimmed his hand up Tony’s leg to rest it behind his knee, as he let the falls spread out over Tony’s skin, dragged it down, then brought it up, threw it again.
Steve looked up at him, blinked slowly, licked at the tip of him again, then pulled off.  Tony whined despite himself, bit down on the web between his fingers and thumb—and then both Steve’s hands were curling around his hips, steadying and warm, his thumbs rubbing in against the crease between Tony’s thighs and hips, and then he was taking a breath, taking Tony into his mouth again, and oh,
“Call back later?” Steve murmured, and kissed him.  Tony moaned, leaned up into the kiss, reached up until he could take hold of the back of Steve’s head and pull him down into it, soft and wet and lingering.  Steve kissed him gently, deeply, slipping his tongue into his mouth, cradling him against his body, stroking the side of his neck, holding him even as his cock was still hard deep inside him.
They finished off that cookie fairly quickly, and moved on to some of the sugar cookies, some iced, some sugared.  These were in the shape of the mansion itself, unicorns, pegasi, dragons, reindeer, and Christmas trees.  There were also spiced cookies and peppermint candy cane twisted cookies that Tony seemed to enjoy feeding Steve piece by piece.  Eventually, by the time they’d finished off the plate—which didn’t take as long as it probably should have—and drained their cocoa (and a second cup each), Steve was feeling warm and loose and a little drowsy, not like he was really tired, but more like he was so relaxed he couldn’t bring himself to be all the way alert.  He slid Tony to his feet and rinsed out their cups in the sink, continuing their conversation about what they’d done that night—the details of Steve’s mission, Tony filling him in on the way he’d set the mansion’s security functions, the extra updates he’d given it since most of the Avengers would be distracted or off duty, though luckily not all, the presents he’d finished wrapping and setting up for everyone.
Tony smiled again, leaned in and pressed a kiss to Steve’s eyebrow.  “Yeah,” he breathed, and his breath felt cool against Steve’s hot skin, the sweat gathering there.  “Give me a color, sunshine.  How do you feel?”
, like that.  Steve still had that mischievous look on his face. Tony gave a questioning noise, shrugged his shoulders.  “Al-already in, inside me, champ,” he finally managed to get out breathily.
“Yeah?” Tony purred, damp and hot against Steve’s neck.
But Tony wasn’t breathing like that now; he was breathing deep and juddery and slow in the way that meant he was deeply turned on, and he was rubbing his knee against the blankets, curling his toes, so Steve just rubbed at his rump a little more, then slid his hand up, caressed the small of his back as he admired the hot rosy shade he’d turned the skin of his rear already, and reached for the first flogger he’d picked out for Tony tonight.
.”  He opened his eyes, and it seemed to take an enormous effort.
“It’s a deal,” Tony said, and laid his head on Steve’s shoulder.  “It’s a deal, big guy.”
, and it made Steve almost eager for the next round, the next time Brock slapped his ass or his thighs and called him a—a cunt, because it felt like he deserved it for thinking about Tony like that, without his consent, when he’d never want it.  God, if Tony could see him like this, he’d probably be
“Gotcha,” Steve said. He was still stroking, rubbing there gently.  “Can’t say I’m surprised.  You always tighten up so fast.”  There was a wet noise, sucking, from behind Tony, and Tony realized Steve was sucking on his fingers, and groaned.  His cock jerked again, and then Steve was petting a wet finger over his hole, working it slowly inside.  He was being gentle, slow, but it felt—it felt huge, with just his spit slicking it, made Tony feel invaded, open, fragile somehow, as it burned slightly against the tight muscle.  Steve crooked it inside, rubbed gently around him, massaging, even as he felt him go up on his knees, reach over his head to snag the bottle of lube out off the dresser Tony had left his makeup on.  Steve was rubbing his other spit-wet finger against Tony’s perineum now, and the touch made Tony feel sensitive, strangely good, shivering and breathless, and he realized he was relaxing with that pleasure even as Steve drew his finger out (the burn, the friction, making Tony groan, tight and hot), then slicked it, rubbed slick lube over his hole, massaging around it, over it, for long moments before he pushed his finger back in.
, pain rocketing through him, all over, head to toe, left him gasping.  He realized his eyes were open, and there were blurry buildings obscuring a blue sky.
The thought was a bit of a thrill.  He’d always admired Tony Stark.  Wished he could be half as good as he was, back when.  Steve didn’t examine it too much, just moved onto another stretch. But really, competing against Tony Stark, when Stark was at his best, and so was he?  The whole idea was amazing.  Exciting.  Stark didn’t even know who Steve was, he was sure, but Steve remembered him.  Tony’d been notorious for being a party boy, for skating hungover, and him only sixteen, but he’d been amazing, even still.  Even with only one quad jump.
“Are my kisses better than Jarvis’s whipped cream?” Steve asked, pressing more kisses against Tony’s eyebrows and cheeks.
“You’re so sweet,” Steve said again, so fond and warm, stroked at his hole with two fingers through the lace, making him tingle, suck in his breath, at the warm swipe downwards, then pulled Tony’s panties down around his thighs, reaching forward and gently freeing his cock, holding it in his hand for a moment (God, he felt so big and warm, and Tony squirmed, panting, in his hold), stroking his thumb just under the tip.  “You’re wet already,” Steve said, softly, moving his thumb up over the sensitive head until Tony gasped, gave a desperate wet little noise, bucked his hips helplessly. “Ah, baby, that’s so good, that’s so nice.  Now just let me make you wetter.”
for someone else’s hand, someone else to show him what it would really feel like, and where else was he going to find that?  When else was he ever going to find out?  Sure, maybe it was—was more acceptable these days, for a man to want to take it in the rear, but it wasn’t like Captain America could just go out to a bar and try to make it with a fella even now.
.  Did it feel amazing?”
“Yeah,” Steve said, with a soft, rueful smile.  “How d’you feel about that, fella?”
Steve shifted a little on the bed.  “Um,” he said.  “What about the peach gelato from Castelli’s?”
Steve felt his face on fire.  He was probably red down to his rear, from the way the flush felt, the way it prickled down his spine, his tailbone, down his chest over his nipples.  “He’s with someone,” he said, instead of everything else he could have said, and had to swallow hard, again.  His cock was throbbing, and it was hard to get a breath.
“Well, then I want you to,” Tony whispered, and Steve smiled up at him.
Steve moaned again, even deeper, low in his chest, in his throat, vibrating around Tony’s cock, and his eyes fluttered closed, just for a moment, and he sucked harder, messily, on Tony’s tip.  Tony found himself sliding his hand through Steve’s hair, stroking it off his forehead, making a mess of it, and felt Steve shuddering against him.  Steve moaned again, voice breaking huskily, a low scratchy rumble.  It felt so good around his cock.
Tony’s words echoed in Steve’s head as he turned off his motorcycle, and he sat there, just for a second.
.  He felt like he was disintegrating, falling apart, and yet loving every moment of it.  He groaned again, lifted his hips, and Steve took him obligingly, curled his tongue around him all the while.  His fingers bit into Tony’s asscheeks again, tight little points of pain that lingered wonderfully in his muscles.  Tony hoped they bruised.  Steve was clearly urging him on, so he let himself settle into a slow, easy rhythm of rocking his hips up and forward, hopefully one that wouldn’t be too difficult at all for Steve to follow.
Colors.  The colors meant things.  Colors were how he got Tony to keep going.  Green.  That was the good one, the one he wanted.  “Green,” Steve managed to moan, because that was the one for Tony, don’t stop, please, I feel so good, and that was what he would have said if his mouth wanted to form words that weren’t
Steve snickered, and Tony laughed, and then Steve was laughing, too, opening his eyes again.
“That you can,” Brock said, then stopped, hesitated.  “You know, Rogers,” he said.  “I wouldn’t mind—keeping you around a while.”
Tony rolled his eyes playfully. Seemed that Steve was the master of breakfasts and everything had to be perfect. For Tony, it was tasty as it was, but he could humor him. “Cabinet on the left,” he said, putting a piece of banana in his mouth and almost spitting it out in panic. “NO! The other left!” Tony called, but it already happened. Steve opened the cabinet and jumped to the back when the contents spilled, falling in a mess to the countertop and to the floor.
"That's sweet," Tony smiled, "and you will be always handsome to me, even when you sneeze your lungs out and get teary-eyed," Tony joked, meaning the allergies attack.
"Stevie!" Sarah brightened as soon as Steve walked into his childhood home. She went to greet her son, her voice becoming stern suddenly. "Did you wipe your shoes on the doormat?"
"Peter, what's the meaning of this?" Steve asked, voice quiet and demanding.
It was a regular bar, with a regular bouncer standing outside, big, buffed and seemingly bored, and regular customers. From the outside, it didn’t seem like anything special. A big sign with a neon and the name of the bar in a simple font embellished with a martini glass and an olive on a toothpick, flashing with purple, green and red did attract attention but wasn’t anything special enough to attract the looking for adventures New Yorkers. Inside was inviting and warm, with round mahogany tables and comfortable chairs and a small lamp in the middle of every table. There were a bar and a stage with silver, glittery curtains, promising entertainment and a good time. It was a bar like many in New York. But late evenings, magic happened inside.
"It is just -" Steve rubbed his forehead more vigorously. "I have something to do, but I don't want to mess it up and lose what I already have. I don't know if I am doing the right thing here."
"Good luck with that," Tony grinned wider, moving slow and sensual, the subtle twist of his waist and hips making Steve's brain short circuit. They could easily move to round two from here, Steve already stiffening from the wonderful feeling Tony's skilled moves invoked, but Steve could be difficult too when he wanted to.
Sam cleared his throat before answering, knocking his fist on the table. “Beer, please,” he said, sounding an octave lower than usual.
“Yhm.”
Steve blinked, seeing Tootsie, standing in front of his usual table in the Olive, full lips turned down in an upside-down u shape, eyes, framed with thick eyelashes and black eyeliner, shooting daggers at him. She wore her usual grungy style of clothing, torn flannel and tights, chunky earrings that were painful to even look at, and shorts so tiny and revealing as if Bucky wanted to make a statement that he was able to tuck perfectly, despite the origin of his drag name.
Tony narrowed his eyes, not liking how easily Steve could read through him. When it came to food, Tony’s mind worked in a simple way - he saw food, he ate it. There was no point in wasting a good pizza and pout that your husband was too busy for an impromptu make out.
"Hmm, somewhere here," Tony smiled charmingly, pointing with a finger to his neck. Steve leaned down eagerly, ready to suckle and kiss the offered skin, when the irritating feeling came back and he straightened up abruptly, sneezing again.
"I can't tell anyone, because my family depends on it!" Tony yelled back, pressing fists against his eyes to stop a wave of crying. Steve was taken aback by that.
Steve sighed, clasping the bracelet around his wrist. Today showed that he shouldn't doubt his husband and trust him. With a smile, Steve walked after Tony and wrapped an arm around his husband, joining in listening to Tony's instruction about using the suit and following Iron Man's orders.
Steve gently lowered Tony’s arms, feeling happiness growing in him when the other man allowed that and leaned down to kiss the tip of his nose. It was silly and sweet and Tony giggled, his eyes and nose crinkling at the simple affection.
Steve laughed in relief. He liked this side of Tony. He was feeling they were getting somewhere when Tony looked at the clock and clicked his tongue.
“Maybe not problems, but a lot of confusion,” Red Velvet answered, walking out, in a short silk robe in vivid gold color. Steve felt stunned again, noticing the bare feet and silky smooth, shaved legs. In fact, Tony as a whole was very smooth. His arms and the part of the torso peeking out from the material didn’t have any body hair either.
"Me?" Steve asked. Sometimes he felt that he should be the one thanking Tony. After all, if it wasn't for Tony's confession, Steve would be kicked out of school and he knew how much it had to cost him. Even his record remained spotless, and Steve knew that it was solely thanks to Tony and his dad, who was set on protecting the teen who saved his son from further abuse.
“You know it,” Tony grinned adorably.
The concept of snacks wasn’t strange to Steve. Heck, back in his apartment in his own pantry, he always kept a stack of animal crackers for the days he felt nostalgic, and always had on hand a bag of salted potato chips to have something to snack on during watching TV. Having snacks was perfectly normal. But this… This was numerous bags of pretzel sticks, potato chips in five different flavors, pop tarts, sugary cereals… Clearly hidden away. And so the abundance of fresh products finally became clear.
"Tony is fine. You can go back to sleep."
And that being said…
"Steve."
"Woah!" Red gasped, and her hands jumped up to her face in shock, a very Tony like gesture, before she toned it down and pressed one hand to her lips. "Steve, what's happening?" she asked, her hand sliding down, just a little to not obscure the words.
"What?" Steve asked, opening his eyes and looking at Red Velvet smiling hopefully at him. "Me and you? On the stage?"
"Nooo," Tony giggled out, too comfortable to move away, and resorting to snapping his head out of Steve's reach. "Stop, okay? Just stop," Tony asked, a twitching smile not leaving his lips. He screamed and laughed, when Steve launched himself at him and Tony latched to soldier’s muscled arms, trying to keep him away. "I said stop! What is with you today? Do you have a thing for me being pregnant?"
"You should invite him over next time! Where did you meet him?"
Those posts were Tony’s. That account was Tony’s. Tony had two Twitter accounts? Steve looked back, just now noticing that it wasn’t Twitter after all. At the top of the screen on a background of dark blue in white letters was written Tumblr. Steve didn’t hear of the app, it wasn’t listed as one of the most popular ones for celebrities and that’s probably why Tony used it for -
"But you know, that Wakanda is on the other side of the globe?" Wanda taunted, but she was ignored and had to squeeze closer to Tony, when Pietro and Steve stood up, high fiving each other, forming some sort of magical bond over sports.
"At least I tucked in properly at my first attempt!" Sam defended his name choice while ridiculing the origin of Bucky's drag name. Tootsie Roll was a good name too.
“Okay, this won’t be so easy! Which blush, this one or this one?”
"Heck, no!" Tony rejected the offer and Steve laughed loudly at the outright protest. Of course, Tony didn't need any fashion advice. "You actually look really good like this. Or I am that great. Probably both, but you should consider having this hairstyle for longer," Tony kept talking, gently tugging at Steve's hair with light fingers, fixing strands in place.
“Thanks, Loki,” Tony smiled, without makeup and out of drag, walking out of his changing room. Steve had been in the corridor, waiting for Tony to be done and stood up when the man approached him. Tony skipped a bit, as if trying to find back his balance after hours on high heels and looked tired, but happy. His shows always attracted a lot of people and he loved the attention.
“Sure,” Tony said, and there was a tension in his eyes, and Steve didn’t know why, wished he could ease it, even as Tony’s smile grew more careless, more bright, and less, somehow, soft and real.  “Why not?”
“Oh!” Tony whimpered, and bit down on the side of his finger.  “Oh, oh, goodness, darling.”  Steve licked firmly at the underside of his cockhead, and he moaned out what wanted to be another whimper, clenching his teeth so it just came out a long moaning noise.  “That’s so good,” he managed to gasp out.  He could feel his chest heaving.  Steve hummed a little, and it felt like the vibration went straight down to his balls, hooked around something in his stomach, hot and hard, twisted tight and pulled.  He groaned, let his hips roll forward just a little, and Steve just sucked at him harder, pulled him farther into his hot, wet, welcoming mouth.  Tony groaned again, despite himself.  His face felt very hot.  He made himself take a deep breath, slide his hand up along Steve’s shoulder, his neck, his jaw, to push back into his hair, stroking it as Steve sucked at his cock, bobbed his head over it.  “Touch yourself, sweetheart,” he murmured.  “Remember?  I want to see you feeling good.”
“Are you saying I should give you a break on this one?” Tony asked.  “Give you this one for free?”  He was still smiling a little, and he’d taken Steve’s hand in both of his now.
He felt too heavy, too soft and uncoordinated, his limbs like they weighed about a million pounds each, to pick himself up after that, but somehow Tony managed to get him on his feet, managed to coax him to put one foot in front of the other—giving him another kiss helped with that, fingers curled in Steve’s hair at the back of his neck as he tugged Steve lightly in toward him—and then Steve was in the other room again, and Tony was pulling a pair of loose pajama bottoms up over his feet, his legs, his sore rear.  “No undies for you right now,” Tony said, smiling, “take it easy on your poor ass and freeball it, okay, stallion?”  There was a pajama top a moment later, Tony buttoning it up.
“I, I,” Tony tried to think. “I did two, two enemas, with solution. It took a long time?  About two hours.  But, uh, you, you knew that.  Sorry. I, uh, I should be really clean, though, honey.  I let it go all the way in, uh, both times.”  He’d done a fresh wax, too, applied lotion, so he should be all nice and clean and smooth for Steve.  He hadn’t taken the cage off, though, couldn’t—Steve wore the key around his neck, Tony could see it, nestled coyly against his skin, almost hidden behind his dogtags on their chain, and the lock was one Tony had designed; there really was no getting it off without the key where it fit tight and snug against his cock, against his body.  Steve would take it off later, wash Tony’s cock, check it over gently, like he did for Tony every night when Tony was locked up like this.  Tony looked forward to it, not for the time out of the cage, because it wasn’t like he was allowed to come then, either, not when they were doing this, but because of the gentle care Steve always showed, the way it felt being washed clean and fondled by Steve’s strong hands, or the way Steve would watch and help while Tony did it.
“Okay,” he breathed, and let Steve have his way.
“I don’t want you . . .” oh, ouch, that hurt, yeah, that was painful, how Tony was shifting him, oh yeah, and there was a strange pause, like Tony froze in mid movement before carefully resuming, “getting in any trouble for me,” Steve managed, as firmly as he could, and then Tony was lifting him up onto his feet and he couldn’t think about anything other than not crying out in pain as he hissed out his breath from between his teeth to try to stop himself, feeling cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.
“Oh, sweetheart,” Steve murmured, feeling the endearment well up within him with the soft tug of warmth in his chest at that
why Tony had bothered to get dressed up like this in the first place, however vulnerable and fluttery and tight with strange anxiety it made him feel in his stomach.  Because it made Steve look at him like
Steve grinned at him, grateful for the consideration, and grabbed a piece of bacon on his way past.  He was loopy and a little faint from hunger, and surely Brock wouldn’t begrudge him that much.
—said immediately, smoothly.  “So, you don’t want to be called America’s sweetheart, then?”
Arto’s shriek of triumph is probably heard throughout the tower, utterly drowning out Steve’s attempts to keep him calm and rational about the whole thing.
Arto’s insides do a strange little wallop at that. Bucky will shit a brick if he knows Omari is planning on handing in an essay about him, and Arto’s kind of ridiculously proud. On the other hand, Omari’s answer throws him a little off balance because Bucky is
Bucky doesn’t reply, but does one of those patented Bucky moves that’s oddly sinuous and graceful, the sort of thing that he really looks too fucking stacked to pull off. He swings his legs out of the bed and slides out down onto the floor, crouching down next to Anna’s travel cot where it stands next to the bed. He gently reaches in, eyes intense as he checks her over.
“Oh, I don’t doubt that,” she says. “I doubt my ability to keep Tony calm while you swim twenty-eight miles.”
“Yeah,” Steve says into Bucky’s shoulder, but then, “What if he gets kidnapped again?”
Arto nods. “Yeah,” he says quietly. “You’re both my dads.”
“No,” Steve says. “If this is happening, I will freak out less if I know you know some more ways to protect yourself. If it ever came to that.”
He hangs into the revelation like its a lifeline, clinging to the idea that it's even okay to be a certain person now and change his mind later on. If next week, month or year rolls around and he decides he does feel more like a girl than he does now, then it's okay. If he never feels anything differently then that's okay too: he can stay as a boy who likes wearing all sorts of clothes, including the ones that other people might say are for girls.
“No, because then if
“We know,” he says. “The whole of New York knows your first port of call is murder when it comes to protecting the baby.”
“Whoa, whoa, take it easy-” Clint is laughing, and Steve looks over to see him grappling with Arto, Arto’s wrists in his hands. Arto is laughing as well, but as he shifts he catches Clint in the ribs with a knee, knocking a pained grunt out of Clint’s chest.
“No, it’s just the climbing and webs and strength and reflexes,” Peter says.
“Arto! I’ve got drinks,
,” Arto says like Steve’s an idiot. “Dads don’t come to school.”
Arto presses his phone to his chin, tapping his nails against the case. “Why will they be mad? Tony’s the one that did something wrong, right?”
“He does too. I’m going to get Bucky,” Clint says, getting up and walking out of the room without looking away from the TV, tripping over a pair of boots on the way.
“Art?”
“Maybe you want one in pink.”
He cocks his head curiously as he reads what he can when he’s standing on the wrong side of the screen. The intrigue momentarily outweighs his annoyance. “What are nanites?”
“I have him,” Natasha says, and Arto turns towards her, but steps back into Steve’s side. She holds out the bear, speaking again in a calm voice. “Don’t worry, Solnishka. I just didn’t want King Hawkeye to take him.”
“How much your friends care about you is not directly linked to how many times they try and call you,” Steve says firmly and far too reasonably. “You didn’t answer the phone. Ball is now in your court. Your move, pal.”
Arto smiles. “I know. But he’s scary and I think it’ll be hilarious.”
“Hey, he’s fine, calm down,” Tony says, pushing up his welding goggles. “He’s okay.”
“Any surveillance?”
“We are still very much married and in love,” Tony says with a one shoulder shrug. “But I made a tactical error and boy am I paying for it. But I would like to take this opportunity to say lesson learned. Cap, I have understood the consequences of my actions. You were so right and I was wrong and I will never, ever do anything like that again.”
“Not yet. One more thing to show you yet,” Bucky says. “Come on.”
There’s a tense silence, and then Bucky is the one to break it, by lifting Anna up and looking her right in the eye. “You are never allowed to think about boys or girls, not ever,” he says solemnly, and Tony, Clint and Natasha all bite down on laughter as Anna smiles and kicks her feet happily, none the wiser.
shut behind him. “You’re in my chair.”
“Can I see your eye?”
“No, smartass,” Steve says. “You’d probably get a lot of followers, so you’re stepping into being a celebrity in your own right. Though on the upside you could tell your own story first hand, which could possibly limit the amount of bullshit TMZ could get out there. And we’d have to seriously consider security. And privacy. Just an example - you’d have to be incredibly careful with what you shared about me. I’m your dad, but I’m also Captain America.”
“What,” Steve says, “Why are you giving me that look.”
He heads to his dads’ room, planning on hiding behind one or both of them and sulking about stupid Bucky spoiling Anna and buying her things that Arto doesn't even want anyway-
“And a tiny bow and arrow,” Steve agrees. “Okay, I can order pizza.”
“As long as you get Bucky his outfit too,” Steve says seriously. “I think he should be Cinderella’s fairy godmother.”
“Arto!”
They get back to New York in record time, guided by the address that Bucky has sent to Steve’s phone, uploaded onto the Tesla’s console. They follow the roads not into Manhattan but further North, winding their way through small towns and open swathes of green, finally pulling up outside a huge pair of iron gates. Arto’s hanging out of the window trying to see what’s beyond but all he can see is the gravel of the drive and the curve of the hedge.
Steve nods slowly. “What society says you shouldn’t want,” he corrects, sounding absent. He’s thinking hard, Arto can tell. It takes him a while to blink back into focus, rubbing at the back of his neck in a giveaway worried tell. “I am way out of my depth here, Arto. We need some help.”
He reaches for the door handle just as Bucky starts to laugh. Obviously Bucky underestimates Steve's willingness to kick him for mocking him, and also hasn’t thought about safety because the child-locks aren’t engaged, letting Arto shove the door open.
Arto frowns at that. Says ‘Superhero,’ like it’s obvious. Steve sighs and repeats himself for the tenth time.
“What?” Steve says. “He wanted to go and do
Arto huffs but sits back down on his heels, reaching for Clint’s other arm. Clint makes a sound in the back of his throat and Arto hastily loosens his grip.
Arto huffs, annoyed that Steve hasn’t simply agreed with him. “But he has been a bad friend.”
“Why would you expect anything less,” Tony says. “Hey, kiss me.”
“Yes I know,” Steve says. “But still. Do not call him an idiot like that.”
die of embarassment if Steve does, he’s sure of it.
“Tee,” Anna says, the best attempt at saying Steve she’s had yet. “Tee, ub.”
No-one answers him, which is possibly the shittiest answer they could have given.
And then, a message comes through.
“Yeah, it’s my communication skills that still need working on,” Steve says with a roll of his eyes. “When are you thinking of starting the handover?”
Arto shrugs. “Glittery shoes and shit?”
Nick leans back in his chair. “As your friend, I am telling you that poking people’s missing body parts is not what we call socially acceptable.”
Tony just stares at him. For the first time ever, he doesn't seem to have anything to say.
Arto nods. “Fine,” he says and his voice cracks around the world. He looks absolutely mortified. “Yeah,” he says louder. “Fine, thanks.”
“You mean how much he’s been told about, or shown?” Bucky asks, and Tony nods.
He comes to an abrupt halt when he spots Clint and Bucky sitting at the counter, which is not unusual in itself even at two AM. He’s more distracted by the fact there are countless boxes of Lucky Charms spread over the polished marble, and the way they’re both systematically going through the opened ones, picking out the marshmallows.
Tony looks up with a frown; he and Arto are elbow deep in the engine for his new bike - the bike that it has taken them six months to persuade Steve to let them build - and suddenly the kid wants to bail?
“What the fuck is that even supposed to mean,” Arto chokes. “I’m so angry at him.”
“No. Though regular blue denim would be okay.”
“And you can shut up as well.”
He swallows hard. Tries anyway. It’s only Steve hearing it out loud, which isn’t so bad. “If you forgive someone who does something bad,” he says. “They win.”
“There’s definitely no Jarvis here, is there?”
Nat closes her magazine, walks over to take Anna from Clint. “I’m borrowing this,” she says, smiling at Anna and brushing their noses together. “Come on baby, let’s go and sort him out.”
“Right,” Arto says, and the woman gets to work.
Just to make his good mood even better, that text is followed not ten seconds later by a text from Peter, who goes for ‘OMG THATS THE BEST NEWS EVER NO MORE SPY BUCKY’ Arto laughs to himself, shoves his phone away in his pocket and carries on with his mission to get pizza, smile still in place.
He barely has to wait ten seconds before Omari sends back a thumbs up and a green love heart, followed by ‘
He hands over the bag. Arto's unnerved enough by Steve's nervousness and doesn't say anything as he takes the bag and upends it onto his knee.
An hour is a hell of a long time to be arguing with Tony, though. He would know.
“You can’t win a gladiator fight with a shield,” Bucky says. On the TV, a gladiator with a sword does his damnest to best the hero of the story. “You need a weapon.”
which is a pretty typical Peter-butt-text, and the second says
He nods, shoves his hands in his pockets. “Do you...do you want a hug?”
Arto leans back and seems to give Bucky a once over. He shrugs, but then twists around so he’s sitting on Bucky’s knee, reaching for his bowl of cereal.
“As you were,” Bucky nods at a scandalized looking salesperson, all polite smiles before he turns back to Arto with a shrug. “Honestly, who gives a shit?” he says. “I can find a guy who loves me even though I’m a chewed up vet with one arm and some serious anger management issues. You’ll find a girl who likes you, no matter what you’re wearing.”
“Yeah that’s what I said,” Arto says. He sighs, turns to stare out of the window at the darkening sky. “He’s...acting weird. I don’t like it.”
“Ah, ah, massage time,” Natasha says firmly. “Finish up.”
“What do you mean?” Steve demands. “Is he okay? Tell me he’s not done anything with that fucking Extremis project-”
Steve sighs. Looks at the drawing of Arto he’s done next to the one of himself. They’re almost the same height in cartoon form, though the Steve one looks more serious.
“Just when I think we’ve got that kid worked out,” Bucky remarks, coming to stand next to Steve, folding his arms across his chest and leaning back against sun-warmed metal. He slips his sunglasses on, using their cover to do a casual visual sweep of the grounds.
“Yep,” Arto says quickly, though his voice feels all weird. “Modern art, lets go.”
“Hey Art!”
While he’s been yelling, Steve has hung up the phone and tossed it aside. He walks over to Arto with a hand extended and a concerned look on his face and for a split second Arto thinks about shoving him, hitting him, but he doesn’t. He just stands there, shaking and welling up with hot tears.
“You can go,” Arto says, eyes locked on Steve and Tony. Tony straightens up and flips the faceplate of the armour. He looks tired, chin covered in uneven stubble instead of his usual well-shaped goatee. He’s speaking rapidly to Steve, who is apparently hearing him out and then nodding, stepping aside so Tony can come in.
“He’ll be fine,” Tony says, and Arto catches the way his eyes flick back into the workshop.
Arto throws up an arm to cover his eyes. “It’s not fair.”
“I thought that’d be more up your street.”
Understanding what she’s getting at, Steve hums thoughtfully. “Is it not gonna confuse him?”
Pepper’s face re-appears on the console, accompanied by the same chiming sound. Steve bites back another curse but this time answers it.
He gets up and pushes away from the counter, walking over and sitting on the couches with the others. Bruce is sitting back with a book on his knee, idly watching the television. Natasha is curled up still with her eyes back on her own book; Bucky is sitting on the other couch and holding his phone out to Clint who has moved to sit on the floor near Bucky’s feet. Whatever it is on the phone is making Clint’s eyebrows climb higher and higher up his face; that coupled with the wicked grin on Bucky’s face makes Steve very sure he doesn't want to know what’s on it.
That’s all he needs to do.
The woman doing his nails stifles a laugh. “Okay, what do we want today?”
“Yeah,” he says, looking down. “Yeah, I fucked up.”
“No?”
Arto nods, passes Anna over. He wants to keep her close but he knows he needs to talk to someone about the horrible feelings twisting in his gut, and he can't take Anna into the workshop. “Going to find Tony,” he mutters and walks away from Clint before Clint hugs him or something stupid because then he’ll start to cry in front of Bucky and Sam.
Tony isn’t so sure; he’s still sort of butthurt by Arto saying that he’d rather go to Bucky than him, but he kind of senses that that is how it’s going to go with things like this. Taking a back seat for once is not something he wants to do, but he kind of gets it.
Arto throws out a hand to hang onto the door handle, both alarmed and thrilled at the speed. “Do you think Tony’s really gone crazy?”
,” Arto says.
“Dad,” Arto says, closing his eyes. “Please just tell me.”
“You’re just going to leave your super expensive car here?”
He hears Tony come close. “Come here, Smart-Art,” he murmurs, pulling him round and into a hug. Arto stays stiff and uncooperative, even though he wants to just curl up on Tony’s knee and be hugged for the next three hours.
“Exactly! It’s that! Just that! It’s not complicated or anything, it’s just my taste in clothes! Well, I think anyway. It might just be some things, not like all clothes.”
Arto slides back onto the couch, sullen. Luckily Clint comes in before he has to summon up a decent apology. Clint takes one look at the TV and gasps, clutching the front of his shirt. “Aw, Natasha, no! Did you know this was happening?”
“Yeah?”
“Stairs,” he says, hands dangling down in front of him, appearing quite content to be carried about like a sack of potatoes. Steve isn’t surprised; Bucky had dropped him off carrying him by an ankle the day before yesterday and Arto had just grinned and waved at him, upside-down and red in the face.
“Stop being an asshole, you’re going to get us into trouble-”
“You are, you’re my kid,” Steve says. “Now drop it.”
“Alright, but that’s enough,” Steve says. “You keep forgetting you’re too strong to play like that with Clint and you’ll end up hurting him.”
“Just like a hoodie or something,” Omari says. There’s the sound of shuffling on his end of the line. “I’ll send you a picture.”
To Steve's surprise, it's Bucky who chips in, looking at Clint thoughtfully. “Right now he's a guy?” Bucky  hedges, a question in his voice. “Who temporarily has female parts?”
Tony tosses his toothbrush back onto the side and glares at Steve, swiping a towel as he stalks out of the bathroom. “That’s sleeping on the couch talk, Rogers.”
“Congratulations,” Clint says, leaning against the wall. “You just got outwitted by a seven year old.”
,” Arto tells him, shoving ineffectually at Steve’s stomach. “I want to go but I don’t so now I’m stuck.”
Meeting Tony’s eyes, Steve smiles faintly back before Arto grabs at his hand, pulling at his fingers. He looks down to take his turn and Arto makes a triumphant noise as Steve’s counter slides down a snake and ends up languishing behind, right near the start.
"What the fuck would you have done if I'd not come down here?!"
Steve shrugged, making a show of getting his phone out. “Bucky wasn’t. I think he should know.”
“You sure of that?” Steve asks cautiously.
Arto leans forwards slightly. “What
“You come with me,” Arto says, pulling at Steve’s collar.
“Yeah?”
Steve smiles at that, rolling his head again the headboard to look at him. “You seem much more okay with this than you did at eleven o’clock last night.”
Tony grins. It’s so fake, Arto can tell. “He’ll get it. Anyway, I better go. My companion for the evening is getting bored-”
“No!” Arto says, indignant.
“Where’s Steve? He behaving?”
“He’s growing on me,” Natasha replies, lifting an eyebrow slightly. “Not just me, I think.”
“I want to come home,” Steve is saying. “I know, yes, I know. We can deal with the press, we’ve been dealing with the press for ten years.” He pauses, laughs unsteadily. “No. Not forgiven for that. The whole country saw your stunt- no I don’t know the ratings, the point is that...yeah, that’s exactly the point.” There’s another long pause, he’s obviously listening. And then he says, “Yes. Okay, okay, we’ll come home, I’ll get everything packed up in the morning-”
“It means flashy, Art, I didn’t mean it as an insult,” Tony says. “Oh man, we need to get better at communicating, huh?”
"I want to go but I don't want to go-o-o," he sobs, bringing his hands up to cover his face.
“Absolutely not,” Steve says sternly, reaching for him and cupping his face in his hands so Arto can’t turn away. “You are my son and I love you, even when it’s hard. You got that?”
Arto shakes his head violently. He hasn’t had sessions with Julia in like eighteen months and he’s not about to go back to that. That’d be like undoing all his progress, like literally going backwards.
“Hi I’m Arto Rogers nice to meet you,” the kid rattles off, and then pulls his hand back. “Are we friends now?”
Arto makes a sympathetic noise. He knows how Omari feels when his scales get too cold. It’s like Bucky’s metal arm but worse.
He claps Steve on the shoulder and grins and one day Steve is going to strangle Clint Barton, though not today because his son is having an increasingly loud meltdown and he kind of needs to deal with that. So he settles for rolling his eyes and heading over to the couch, standing close enough so that Arto can slump dramatically into his chest.
Bucky barks out a laugh, expression smoothing over. “I’ll bet. Your spoiled ass will have to get used to doing things manually.”
“Makes it almost feel like we can actually do this?” Steve says, and Tony nods.
"Green," he says quietly as Arto vanishes inside the building with one last wave, and then turns back towards the car, hoping Bucky will relax the 'Steve is not allowed behind the wheel of my car' rule so he can go home.
Doesn’t stop him buying a new pink sweater though, or a super long white tank top with a hem that floats around his knees. If he wears it over leggings it’ll look a bit like a skirt. That freaks him out a little, but not enough to stop him loving how light and floaty it is. If he spins around, it twirls around with him like he’s a ballerina or some shit.
Arto’s face breaks out into a grin. He glances left and right, feeling his heart swelling in his rib cage. “Nah,” he says. “Not bad at all.”
“Mhhhm,” Arto says, and sits at the long breakfast bar. It’s all wrong, and as he sits down he fiercely misses his seat at the island counter at home, the huge oblong that has enough space around it for everyone. “Is there any syrup?”
Arto scowls at his bacon, jabbing at it with his fork. “I don’t get how you’re defending him now.”
He takes the cushion away from his face. Sam meets his questioning expression and shrugs. “Maybe they’re… making up.”
“Where are you?” Pepper asks, sounding subdued.
“We have established he’s being weird, leave him to it,” Tony says.
"Oh, no!" Bucky says, waving his metal hand at the screen, where a princess is caught in motion, mid-twirl. "Cinderella! Which is better, Cinderella or Clintina?"
“Morning-” Bucky says, cuts himself off when he sees it’s Arto and not Steve. “Is he
“It probably would have done nothing,” Tony finally says. “But there was a possibility that it could have put me in a coma or killed me.”
are my dad and I am coming with you.”
Arto rears back, looking horrified. “I don’t want to sleep with her!” he says. “That’s
He’s barely been off the phone for a minute when it rings back at him. He thinks it’ll be Julia calling back to tell him that he is in fact crazy but it turns out to be Peter, which is exactly what his poor shredded nerves need right now.
“Seriously, what did Tony do that means he needs to apologize on TV?” Arto says. “Will someone just tell me?!”
“No he’s moving
Steve smiles, warm and fond as he salutes Arto back just before the doors slide shut.
The exasperation comes back. “You came down here to smash open the door and you don’t know why?” Tony asks, edging into incredulous. “I thought we were over this, Art.”
“Nope. The suit in the seat opposite me wasn’t a fan but fuck that guy. I’m a veteran and it’s about time that got me some goddamn perks.”
“Arto, can we not,” Steve says quietly. “I’m tired.”
Steve groans. “I hope not,” he says. “He
“Yep,” Tony says. “I’ll be waiting right here. I won’t even move.”
Omari calls him back literally two seconds after the message clears to Peter. Grinning, Arto answers it and throws himself back onto his bed.
Tony smiles tiredly. “Have I ever let you down?”
“I can do it!”
“Did you find anything you liked?” Steve asks.
He sighs and holds up three fingers. Tony nods, face softening. “I vote for that one too. Me being an idiot is a conversation that can wait, let’s talk about you.”
The relief is so strong it’s almost enough to knock him down. He just nods into Steve’s shoulder, feeling suddenly both very young and somehow older than he ever has before.
He tries to clear his throat and shrug his shoulders. Natasha just observes him quietly for a moment and then leans back into her rooms, grabbing her coat.
“Then if he carries on being weird, corner Peter and ask him what’s going on.”
“It’s not all about what a person looks like, Art,” Natasha says. Her eyes are closed, lazily enjoying the sensation of Steve kneading firm circles into the back of her skull. “It’s about what they feel and who they want to be. You can have what people know as girl parts, and still feel like a boy.”
There’s more, Steve’s sure of it. He can tell by the way Arto is looking at him, and restlessly twisting his fingers together. Hell, he wonders if he should call Tony up out of the lab; if Arto is about to say something revelationary, Tony should be here for it too. “But…?”
“Why are you wearing a coat inside?”
Arto nudged him. “That was super cool.”
“Yeah,” Peter says. “They really suit you.”
Tony doesn’t look up. “I know,” he says quietly. “I didn’t think and now I’m paying the price for it.”
Arto nods and smiles, hidden safely away in Steve’s side.
Arto shrugs, looks at Steve’s back where he’s busy preparing breakfast. “I dunno,” he says, and holds up his hand. “I broke a nail.”
"I'm shutting this down. Tony, move-"
He’s across the room in four steps, flinging himself onto Tony. Tony wobbles back a step under his weight but recovers enough to wrap both his arms around Arto’s shoulders, holding him tightly enough to make breathing difficult.
He’d fallen asleep still wearing his long dress-shirt and has a moment of wondering if he should change into something that looks less like a old-timey nightgown, but apparently whoever is outside his door isn’t fond of waiting.
“What, like you’re sorry for ignoring me for weeks?”
“So, have we decided about-”
Steve shakes his head. “The same books. I bought a copy for me and maybe for the adults in the tower to read, if you wanted them to. I sent Tony a link for an E-copy too.”
“I don’t even want to join in, I just want to watch.”
There's a long silence.
Probably.
“Fuck,” he says, voice muffled. He pushes against Steve, sitting up. “I better go head her off.”
“I know. Idiot of the year award,” Tony says. “I made the wrong call. I was doing it for the right reasons, but I made the wrong call.”
With only Steve and Arto left in the apartment, the evening feels calm and peaceful. There’s a movie talking to itself in the background and Steve and Arto are drawing on the wall, next to the scribbles that Anna made. Steve’s doing little caricatures of the team. Arto’s drawing himself riding a dragon, wearing a flowing blue dress and his pink sneakers.
Arto shakes his head, looking suspicious. “Clint says high five?” he ventures.
Bucky’s face does something weird and scrunchy and then he’s striding over to Steve and hugging him. Steve hugs him back, clinging on in a way he really hopes Bucky doesn’t mention.
“What?” Tony says, “You pissed him off, why do I have to go?”
Tony’s still talking, full steam ahead. “And I spoke to Pepper about it and she actually thought it would be a good idea. Because this way we get a fresh start. And this way I’m completely away from the Extremis project. The tower is work, this is home. I’m drawing a line. I mean, I still have a workshop here but that’s for personal projects.”
“He’s being weird,” Tony says.
“A little. For cursing at Tony. But you know Steve. He loves you even when he’s mad.”
They’ve just climbed back into the car after a restroom-coffee-snack break when Steve’s phone starts to ring, a picture popping up on the center console. It’s a scowling face obscured by a metal hand trying to push the camera away. Arto immediately thinks that Bucky’s been caught up in some mess at the airport. Steve obviously thinks the same, leaning over and tapping the screen to answer the call. “Do I need to come rescue you from the TSA?”
he texts back.
“People stare anyway, we’re two not-small fellas with a baby. People spend ages trying to work out if we’re queer or not.”
He pulls his knees up. His hands go over his ears. “No,” he says. “
He takes a deep breath, presses his mouth back to Arto’s hair. “Let's do it a step at a time, huh? Thinking about school is big and scary, right? So let's just think about step one. I need you to do one tiny thing and go wash your face.”
After an hour and a half, both Arto and Clint are whining they are hungry. Clint is quickly hushed by Bucky smacking him upside the head, but dealing with Arto in the same way is definitely not an option. Steve manages to placate him by getting Jarvis to put a documentary about sharks on the television, and Natasha procures a packet of Belgian cookies from somewhere that definitely isn't’ the communal kitchen, and shares them willingly with Arto and deliberately not with Clint.
Steve sighs. “We should probably stop it.”
“Because Tony said my nails were dumb and he was all like yeah everyone will judge you and why are you suddenly wearing nails it’s a stupid habit.”
“Did you just self-censor the word
Arto slowly stands up on the couch, leaning over the back with his hands curled into the cushions. His eyes keep darting between Clint and Steve, then he opens his mouth and simply bursts into tears.
Arto watches the look and then belatedly realises that it’s weird that Steve is still asleep at eleven AM.
“Then she’ll just go back to eating your car keys.”
He misses his home. He misses the rest of his family.  He misses his friends.
Arto nods. “You just were doing a bad job of showing it,” he says before he can stop himself, and Tony visibly flinches.
“But?”
“Thank you.”
“Sand in my scales, no thanks.”
“You shouldn’t even know what a rack is,” Tony points out to him, and then swats at Arto who is squinting, head turned to the side as he stares at Clint’s chest contemplatively. “Arto!”
“I’ll make it right,” he says, and Clint just smiles, leaning over to turn off the ignition.
Steve’s summation that he might just be getting a handle on things lasts around an hour.
“The rule is fucking stupid,” Arto snaps back before he can help himself. There’s a beat of silence around the table and then Arto pushes away from the counter and walks off, needing to just get
“I’m not bisexual either, Nat, will you please stop,” he says, even as a nasty voice in the back of his head points out that he’s shouting about being straight while getting his nails done in pink glitter polish.
Unfortunately, backup is locked in the workshop and Jarvis is not letting him in. Arto resorts to banging on the glass in frustration again, though he holds back on the kicking front. The crack from last time hasn't been fixed yet.
Arto shakes his head. “No,” he says. “Stop asking.”
He drops the books and throws himself at Steve, almost knocking him off the edge of the bed as he hugs him. Steve returns the hug, squeezing him tight and burying his face in Arto’s hair.
“It’s
Being out by himself is weird. He’s never really been alone at all, apart from those times when he was little and he was locked in the bedroom adjacent to the laboratory. That time of his life is all a little vague though, the memories pushed aside in favour of remembering his new life with Steve and Tony. It’s kind of scary, walking along the snowy streets and knowing that Bucky or Clint or Nat aren’t around. Unless Steve decides to attempt some sneaking, there’s no-one out here looking out for his safety, other than himself.
Clint.”
“You adorable, tragic, little meatball, you’re just like your Dad,” Tony sighs, and ignores Arto’s glower. “Okay, second thing you need to know. When you’re younger, age gaps are a big deal.”
fight, not again, I just want to know what’s going on and why we’re here-”
“Shhh, okay, okay,” Steve says. “Don’t talk yet, just sit.”
“Like Mount Rushmore,” Clint says, starting to laugh.
“Looks like I’ve chased the beast away,” Clint announces, and steps up onto the arm of the couch, above where Arto is hiding.
“So. First I didn’t think I had to tell you squat about what I was doing in the workshop,” Tony says without preamble. “Then when I realized just what a fucking idiot I’d been, I didn’t want to tell you.”
"You want to get the kid to school or not?" Bucky says, folding his arms across his chest.
Mid-morning finds them taking a cab to the Art Institute of Chicago, which Arto manages to be insanely excited about even with everything else ticking over in the back of his brain. Steve does not seem as excited as he should be considering art; he’s got his cap pulled low over his face and seems to be kind of lost. Not in a
– and Tony is also Prince Charming, because Arto says so. Natasha is obligingly the King and spends most of the evening bossing Tony and Steve about. She takes being in character very seriously. Bruce is cast as the Captain, and brushes up very well, but spends most of the evening tugging at his collar, fiddling with the buttons on his jacket and smiling apologetically when Arto tells him
He takes Steve to the conference floor, and steps out of the elevator and heads towards the landing between the two staircases. It appears deserted, and Steve frowns irritably at him, but Tony holds up a hand in a gesture to wait.
“But why don’t they just-”
Arto opens his mouth to argue but then realises that yeah, that’s probably exactly right. He looks down at his feet, wriggling his toes in his thinning Hulk socks. “I want you to stay,” he mumbles.
“He is not a creeper, he’s in love.”
“Because he doesn’t care about me right now, he cares about his stupid workshop.”
“That’s why he’s going to school. Steve. Calm down.”
“No no no no - ahahaha, fuck!”
Steve was no expert on relationships. He never was in love, but he could tell that there were no warm feelings between the couple. And looking at today's encounter, there was something more happening… Something really, really bad.
"Then what is stopping you?" Tony asked in a whisper.
"I… I will think about it," Steve gave up, lowering his arms.
Steve didn't answer the obvious provocation, just smiled. On his way back home, he would have to stop at pharmacies and do some research on nicotine gums.
Red Velvet made some gesture with her hand and piano music started to seep, filling in the room and Steve’s heart. Calming and soothing and sad. Red Velvet closed her eyes and started to sway her beautiful hips to the gentle music.
“Tony? Tony, are you okay?!”
"Whaaat?!" a young girl with a head full of black curls showed up, holding a notepad and looking irritated. "You told me to do a stocktaking! Do you know how many types of tires we have here?!"
Red Velvet made a sympathetic sound and walked to Steve's side, pulling his head down to press to her chest. "You are getting all emotional, baby."
"Bucky is coming over?" Steve asked, putting the bowl aside. Somehow he couldn't picture his friend discussing material for dresses and lipstick colors.
"You kinda did what I asked for," Tony admitted in a small voice. "Just in wrong circumstances."
Everyone turned to her, waiting for the moment of truth. Red looked down, thinking about the last months with Steve. Steve was kind and honest and sweet. He had some hidden heat in himself and a lot of passion. But most importantly, he seemed to love both sides of him, equally fascinated by Red Velvet as by Tony Stark. Tony felt safe and loved and pampered, but Steve also wasn't afraid to give him a piece of his mind when needed. It was very rare to find a person like that.
"Thanks," Red smiled, fixing the front of a lovely auburn color bra with lace on top. "It is a new bra, it doesn't want to listen to me - oh," she stopped talking when turned around and finally took a good look at Steve and his new style.
"No," Sarah laughed and winked at Tony, "it is girls only," she said and Tony chuckled.
“Yup. This is Steve. Steve, this is Arrow. I think you know each other already,” she introduced, turning back to the door.
"The movie? I can change it," Tony said, gently playing with Steve's hair.
Red's breath stopped when she saw the ring on the black insert. She looked back at Steve, eyes glistening with emotions, and said something Steve certainly didn't expect but found very fitting.
"TONY! Logan came earlier!"
"Good night, Friday," Steve lay back in bed, pulling the covers to himself.
"It's great," Steve said enthusiastically, although he felt that nothing could top good ol' double chocolate chip cookies. "Is Mama here?"
Tony smiled, a cheeky little smile, “a woman never gives her age,” he answered smoothly, “but I am something some would call a seasoned queen.”
Tony doubled with laughter, when Steve closed the door, a wet towel slapped across his face. Judging by the laughter coming from the other side, it had to be Bucky who had shrieked, while Sam's was howling.
I am writing next chapters and heads up - the story is taking an unexpected kinda dramatic turn I didn't plan D: still thinking if I want to go that route though but decided to post this chapter without further delay and waiting for myself to make a decision.
"Ready. Eat up," Sarah smiled, putting in front of Steve a plate with a huge scoop of mashed potatoes and a generous portion of beef tips, all smothered with dark and shiny sauce. Delicious, homemade food.
“What color is better for me - this one, or this one?” Tony asked, holding in his hands two lipsticks. He was trying to hide it, but his lips were twitching into a mocking smile, almost as if he planned to torment Steve with the task.
Tony almost jumped away, when Steve came closer and wrapped arms around him. After a moment of hesitation, Tony buried himself into his soldier’s arms, his face pressed against Steve’s neck. Probably the last hug he would receive from Steve. This whole thing won’t make Avengers stuff awkward at all. What if Steve would quit the team? Tony couldn’t imagine not being able to see Steve anymore. He needed him. He would change, he would do better. Steve couldn’t break up with him.
"I will take a look at him," Tony said, sliding out on the rolling platform and sitting up.
"Coming, coming!" Steve opened the door, seeing Bucky, holding a bottle of sparkling wine and six pack of beer.
Steve leaned in and placed a lingering kiss on Tony’s forehead. The story he just heard was filled with sadness and grief and although Steve couldn’t relate, he would do his best to understand. Words couldn’t describe how happy he was with being allowed into Tony’s past and it was a warm, wonderful feeling.
"What are you two talking about?" Steve turned around and looked behind himself. Better just to get involved or his alone time might never come back.
"So, what brings you here?" Red Velvet asked, curling in the corner of the couch and patting the cushions next to her, motioning for Steve to sit down. "Lately you only show up minutes before my show."
"Oh my gosh, how did you even - " Steve laughed, still not believing what he was seeing. He was an artist and had a good eye for color, but it was like Tony used the whole palette of red and pink shades and sprinkled random Valentine's day accents all over their bedroom, from the cheesiest giant pastel pink teddy bear, ending on the enormous deep red bouquet of royal roses.
"Yes, I killed my father," Peter agreed, rolling his eyes, "or worse, he will come back now as a zombie and terrorize us."
Ten minutes later, and Steve stomps back into the communal area and pulls a beer out of the fridge, scowling.
“So, there was this thing, for science, this tour of some labs, and spiders, and one bit me and now I…” Peter trails off, shrugs. “I have spider powers.”
“Course it does,” Bucky says. “Why do you think I’m letting you do it?”
Arto pulls a face. “Oh, you’re gross.”
The rest of the day doesn’t really go his way, in that he doesn’t get to find out what the conversation on the balcony was all about, and he doesn’t get another opening to talk about his stuff. He wants to, he desperately wants to tell Clint everything but every moment seems to be wrong or just not quite right. Ugh. He’s a Rogers, he should just be able to do it. His dad might as well be an advert for freaking Nike or something; whenever he decides he wants to do something there’s very little that can hold him back. Tony’s a big fan of pointing that out on a very regular basis.
“You called them ostentatious.”
“You’re sneaky.”
.’ It makes him literally laugh out loud, a loud snort that has Steve looking quizzically his way.
Tony pauses. “Because. The work we did was connected to my DNA. We weren’t sure that the prototype nanites would work with anyone else’s cells.”
“Put his shoes back on,” Steve says. “That’s it. Just shoes.”
“Because he’s Tony,” Steve says with a smile that looks sad and strange. “Sometimes he’s like me, needs something big to make him see sense or change his mind.”
“Are you okay?” Omari asks, his softly quiet voice filled with worry.
“Call him,” Bucky says.
“Good luck,” Steve says, and Tony leans in and presses a quick kiss to the corner of his mouth before leaving the room. Steve watches him go, feeling uneasy and a little lost. He should probably go with Tony, to at least be there to back him up and help explain to Pepper.
He tries to get himself lost in the artwork, he really does, moving from section to section with Steve just behind him. However, as well as appreciating lines and style and colour and atmosphere and message, he finds himself scrutinising the subjects of all the paintings, seeing how his brain reacts. He definitely doesn’t perk up at any of the male subjects. Some of the women are definitely beautiful and make his cheeks go warm if he thinks about it too much. It’s the same way he appreciates the Victoria’s Secret models in Times Square so he remains ninety-nine percent sure he’s straight.
She flips a page, wriggles to get comfy in her chair. “You’re welcome.”
Arto thinks back to yesterday, when Tony has been so annoyed at him for interrupting. He shakes his head quickly. “I’ll go get my coat,” he mumbles.
Bucky snorts with laughter as he walks behind them, pulling open the driver’s door. “He’s got you there,” he says. “Hey, Short Round, what music are we listening to?”
He’s practically vibrating with it by the time he and Natasha swap places. He knows a few of the women in the salon are looking at him so he just stares back in challenge until they look away. Natasha swats him gently on the shoulder as he does, taking up his vacated stool.
“Of course you are,” Natasha says. “He’s sixteen, your job is to let him think that you’re ruining his life.”
"Ste-e-e-e-ve," Arto whines, but he doesn't put much effort into protesting. He slumps over Steve’s shoulder, feet half-heartedly kicking against Steve’s stomach. Steve carts him all the way back up to the communal lounge, dropping him onto the couch and then standing there, rubbing his hands over his face and wondering what to do next.
“Pancakes,” Arto replies automatically. “Can we get pancakes?”
Steve squeezes his shoulder and then gets up. Arto panics for a moment but Steve comes back within a minute, a glass of water and a pack of cookies in hand. “Here,” he says, and passes Arto both. “I can go find you hot chocolate if you want?”
“And on the quinjet on the way home-”
“Steve, don’t,” she says. “You can’t do anything.”
“Steve’s a jerk,” Arto says moodily as he flicks at the straw in his glass, watching it spin around.
Tony shrugs. “I didn’t exactly plan this very well,” he says. “I jumped in a suit and flew straight here and neither thought of the consequences or packed a toothbrush.”
Arto immediately jumps at him, making Steve laugh as Arto hits him, wrapping his arms tight around his chest. He’s still not as tall as Steve, even if he’s matched Tony. He closes his eyes tight, squishes Steve that bit harder.
“Nice try, Short Round,” Clint says, with an apologetic grimace. “Hey, the shoes look good!”
“Future Arto has to go to school,” Arto says, reaching out towards Tony with his fingers spread. “I’m not in the future so I don’t have to.”
“Pass,” Tony says. “Look, Bucky and Clint are taking you, just like we decided. You have to take Clint to school because he can’t read or do math. You’re his only hope, kiddo.”
“No,” Arto says, throat too tight. He points at the princess again, yanking on Steve’s sleeve. “I. I like.”
“I thought my brain was broken,” Arto says, slotting the coins back into the piggy bank as Clint takes alternating sips from his mugs of coffee. He doesn’t say anything though, just waits and blinks sleepily. Arto picks up another plastic coin. “It’s not. When Natasha took me to get my nails done it make me feel all weird. And then Bucky bought Anna that headband and I wanted one and it was even weirder and I didn’t know what was happening.”
Arto whirls around, points at Steve. “I knew you were texting Bucky, you were, weren’t you?!”
“Good catch, Short-Round,” Clint says from right behind him. “Tree’s coming down tomorrow so she’ll stop trying to eat the baubles.”
“Should have distracted him by touching his junk,” Bucky shrugs. “That’s your best bet.”
“Bucky’s staying with you two a few more days,” Clint says, watching him go. “He’s bad at goodbyes. If he cries, it’ll ruin his rep.”
Arto goes still, phone in hand. He doesn’t look at Steve, but he’s listening.
“We’ve been friends with Peter for like...nearly four years? And you’ve fallen out with him enough so that you’re never going to talk to him again?”
“Lucky Charms for life,” Arto says vaguely, popping marshmallows into his mouth. Bucky lets out a bark of laughter and Arto twists around to look at him. He sits back and reaches for Bucky’s metal arm, pulling it around his middle and holding onto his thumb.
“I’m a tactical genius.”
“A special box, just for you,” Steve says. “You didn’t win, and Clint and Bucky were sorry you got sad, so they-”
“I,” Arto says. He looks around for a distraction. Anna’s piggy bank is on the counter so he flips open the side, fishes the coins out. It’s easier like this. Gives his hands something to do so the conversation isn't quite as intense. At least he’s talking to Clint, rather than Steve and Bucky with their super-soldier laser stares.
A spark of something - anger, maybe? - lights in Arto’s chest. His stomach goes tight.
Steve nudges back at him. “Arto,” he says gently. “You have not had the best time recently. Between this, Peter, TMZ splashing you all over the web...if you
“Well, he’s not wrong,” Tony says, pushing himself off of Steve so he can step in closer to Arto, catching his hand in one of his. “What has present Arto got to do now he’s washed his face?”
“You can?” Arto asks in surprise.
The reporter sank back into his chair. For a moment he looked relieved but then his gaze narrowed, suspicious. “I’m not afraid of your lawyers.”
“True,” Arto says. “What do I do?”
“See, he’s fine,” Tony says, spreading his arms expansively.
Steve leans over him, resting his chin on Arto’s shoulder and wrapping his arms back around him. “And I’ll tell you now,” he murmurs. “Tony would say exactly the same as I’m saying, though probably with more metaphors and gesticulating.”
Arto’s face crumples, and he pushes at Steve harder. “Not too strong,” he begins, but then stops, chin wobbling. “Strongest.”
“Oh thank god, then it’s not Pietro you have a crush on,” Tony says. “I’m sorry, he’s too obnoxious for my tastes.”
“Ooops,” he says tentatively, and he slides uncertain eyes up to Steve, holding the string out. “Sorry.”
The car roars to life. Jarvis is protesting from the console but if Jarvis dares shut that door on him he’ll drive straight through it, and he screams as much at him as the shutters slowly start to descend. He slams his foot onto the accelerator, the car lurches forwards-
“So, your child is having a meltdown,” Clint says conversationally. “I mean Steve’s child is having a meltdown. Buck, chill, our child is fine.”
Arto’s eyes slide up over the store. He can see a mannequin wearing pink leggings and a light denim jacket and it has a flowy pink and white scarf draped around the shoulders. He wants to go over and run the scarf through his fingers. But between him and the mannequin there’s a group of girls about his age and they’re all giggling and one of them is super pretty and if he goes into the women’s section they’ll all think he’s gay or something and he’s
Steve sighs, shoves his hands in his pocket. “You gonna be okay flying solo?”
“So did you ask him who it was?” Steve asks that night as they’re getting ready for bed, side by side in their bathroom and brushing their teeth, elbows knocking.
Bucky breaks into peals of laughter, slumping forwards over his chair. Natasha’s mouth quirks in an unwilling smile, and Clint is laughing too.
“I will politely decline,” Bucky says, giving her the finger behind Arto’s back. “Anyway, what were you saying about me and my delicate nineteen forties sensibilities? I hate to break it to you, but people in the forties had eyes, and with my eyes I can see that Clint is clearly a girl right now.”
Bucky drops the cigarette to the floor, grinds it out with his heel. “You don’t have that kind of money, sugar,” he says, pulling open the cab door. “Come on, let’s go. I want a beer.”
“Okay,” Steve says. “I’ve got my cell, please don’t go anywhere.”
Steve didn’t reply right away. Technically, Arto
It’s not just the attitude though; he’s also edging back into clingy territory, angling after hugs and wanting to be in Steve’s pocket. It drives Tony mad because it's not consistent, either. When he’s not being surly and acting like the world is out to get him, he’s pretty chirpy and bright.
“Okay,” Arto nods. “So you’ll just check Bucky’s training plan and annoy him about it?”
“Pushover,” Tony’s sleep-thick voice says from behind him, and all Steve can do is agree.
“Arto, you’re killing me here.”
"Would you look at that," Tony says with a quirked grin. "Saying no works."
He should probably try and turn that into words or something. Say something nice and sincere. He opens his mouth, and what comes out is, “Can we have pizza again?”
“Yeah,” Tony admits. “You're smart.”
“Shoot.”
“I don’t know,” Arto says, and he starts to cry. He can hear Omari talking, tone wavering between frantic worry and forced calmness, trying to get Arto to calm down, trying to get him to go and find someone.
“I know, pot, kettle, right? But like recognizes like as well, so I’m gonna keep asking why you’re being weird. Oh god, you’re not about to go through more puberty are you?”
“Yeah,” Arto says, yawning. He still feels wired though, all giddy and hopped up on his discovery. “Can we go out today? Can you take me to get my nails fixed?”
Arto jolts back in surprise. “I'm not allowed.”
“Yeah!” Tony says indignant all over again. “He told me he’d rather ask Bucky for girl advice than talk to me!”
“You want to help with paperwork?” Tony says slowly, narrowing his eyes.
But he’s angry so of course he decides to keep his mouth shut, too resentful to try and explain it.
Arto thinks about it. “Reading in the bath?”
Steve grimaces. “Maybe,” he says. “But understand...I’m your dad. If I had to teach you self defence, like actually showing you what to do if someone tried to hurt you...I’m not sure I could handle that.”
Arto doesn’t wait for him to find the words. He storms away and doesn’t look back.
“Steve said I could,” Arto responds immediately. He doesn’t look bothered by Nick’s presence in the slightest which is interesting; Steve and Tony have both said about how twitchy he gets around strangers. They’ve never actually met properly; the only other times Arto has been in SHIELD, Nick hasn’t been there. Really, considering the whole kidnapping thing, he’s amazed that Steve lets Arto anywhere near the place.
And so Steve, feeling scolded, got back to his and Tony’s shared floor, planning to hide, except that he was assigned a very simple task for the week.
“It’s a matter of getting used to. The better wigs, the less pain. You can take a look at mine, there are in the closet,” Red Velvet said, pointing him in the right direction.
“Hmmm. I thought we could eat outside. I want to take you somewhere today,” Tony said, his voice sounding a little timid.
"Yhhm," Steve smiled, taking another sip. And then another. And another.
"Finally!" Steve breathed out, happily kicking off the pumps, his face saying pure relief. Tony slid his feet into the shoes and did a short test walk, before smiling wide.
“Thanks,” Steve took it in both hands and slowly sipped. It was working and soon he felt warmth spreading over his limbs and helping him think. He looked at Tony, who was actively avoiding his gaze and sat on the edge of the bed, near him, waiting.
"It's probably nothing big," Tony soothed, his posture still relaxed and eyes sparkling happily. "Last time, Rhodey called alarm, it turned out Riri and Harley secretly planned to turn Chevrolet Camaro into a transformer. Rhodey found blueprints and all, and they even started to modify the car. Maybe this time they succeeded and I really want to see that - to discipline them," he corrected himself.
Tootsie waved him off. "I tried to steal them, but she made copies. She even stuck some on the mirror in her dressing room!"
"Maybe it didn't yet, but after I do this," Steve made sure that Peter was a little out of his breath before he let go and threw himself at Tony, blowing a long and wet raspberry on his husband's neck. That made Tony shriek and laugh out loud pretty nicely. When he moved away and pinned his hand back into Tony's hip he was rewarded with a booming laugh. "And now it works," Steve grinned. There was something about raspberries that immediately unblocked Tony's reactions and made him ticklish all over. More ticklish all over.
Steve remembered polio outbreaks back from his days. When he woke up to a polio-free world, it was great news, but the 21st century had its traps. Flat-Earthers, parents declining to vaccinate their children, and a new, unknown virus, spreading all over the world. The Avengers team was known as the Earth Mightiest Heroes, but pandemics wasn't a time for heroics. It was a time to put down their armors and give an example. The Avengers' social media has never been fuller. Photos of movie nights, game nights, group training, even domestics things like Thor washing the dishes, or Steve doing the laundry, as all cleaning services had to be canceled (Tony made sure that all providers were paid a year in advance, just to be sure and not deprive anyone of a job). The Avengers tried to stay in and be safe and give an example. Just... It wasn't their thing. A month had passed, stretching into more months, and the situation was not getting better and everyone was at the end of their wits, handling it better or worse.
Thor nodded. "Nice jacket, by the way."
"Hi, Mr. and Mr. Stark-Rogers!" MJ called, waving to them and just then Ned got out of shock and said his hello, still a bit intimidated by the superhero couple.
"Only if you have some better proposition for me," Tony fluttered his eyelashes in a flirty move. As an encouragement, Steve kissed him again, long and sweet, letting the feeling linger.
Somehow, Steve didn’t believe him. Instead, he believed the comment.
Couches were the worst. The couch in his and Tony's living room was the worst. Steve felt like setting it on fire.
“Hi,” Tony said back, waiting for something to happen. When it didn’t, he moved in closer, putting his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, soldier’s hands wrapping over his back. They both took a deep, calming breath, the sleepy atmosphere coming back. This was good. Yet some thought didn’t want to leave Tony’s mind and he had to do something about…
