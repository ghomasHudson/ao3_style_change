The first few pictures are from inside the restaurant, darker shots with the slightly grainy quality Steve has been learning to associate with camera phones. They show him sitting with Tony at their table, talking, smiling, one of Tony laughing, and then a pair from different angles – must have been from two different tables nearby – of the two of them leaning in a bit over the last of the dessert, fingers linked on the tabletop. One of the photos even has their hands circled, with an enlarged inset.
“I spoke with Stark about the ceremony. He said you might require my assistance, as you have few friends in this time.”
Natasha shakes her head, slicing into a bagel with slightly unnerving efficiency. “It seemed like the quickest way to get you up, and I wasn’t going to barge into Dr. Banner’s apartment and wake him up when I knew I could get you here with a minimum of fuss.”
“Bowls are in the cabinet to your left, Captain, if you would like to save your eggs for later. I suggest putting them in the refrigerator in the meantime.”
Steve glances down at himself, realizes he’s still in running clothes, and feels abruptly awkward. “That might be a good idea,” he agrees, thinks he should probably shower, as well. When he looks up, Tony’s watching him, but he turns away almost immediately. Steve frowns, opens his mouth to ask, but Tony speaks before Steve can get the words out.
“It is thirteen minutes past four o’clock in the morning, Sir,” Jarvis’s voice is low and soothing, and Tony tries to cling to it. “You are in your bedroom in Stark Tower, in Manhattan, New York.” The lights come up slowly, not too bright, but enough that Tony can see more than just the shadowy suggestions of furniture.
Steve makes for the farthest bar, tucked away in a quiet corner, knows with uncomfortable certainty that he can take as long as he needs, and Tony will keep the vultures so busy they won’t even notice Steve’s absence. Not only has Steve been too quick to judge – and judge unfairly and harshly – but he hasn’t even been pulling his own weight, even though he really is just as much to blame for this situation as Tony. He can change that, though.
“Barton said you had a meeting at SHIELD?” Tony has taken a piece of bread from the basket in the middle of the table and is methodically shredding it onto the little plate he has in front of him.
“Right,” Steve says again. He grabs a bowl, dumps the eggs in and drops the pan into the sink before putting the bowl in the fridge. “Do you know what the trouble is?” he asks as he heads for his room, tugging his shirt off as he goes.
There’s a slight twitch from Tony’s hand in his, and Steve feels himself frowning. “Maria’s?” he asks before he can stop himself.
“Put him up,” Tony taps the air by one of the screens, and Bruce appears, looking only minorly ruffled. “Good morning, Cupcake.”
Tony stares for a long second, then laughs, can’t help it. This hadn’t exactly been how he’d thought this day would go, but it definitely could have been worse.
It’s not fair, Tony thinks vaguely, that Steve can look so casually classy in khakis and a button-down shirt, when anyone else would just look like someone’s grandfather. His stomach twists a little as he gets closer, sees the awkward half-smile Steve is wearing, and he tells it firmly that he’s not that hungry, it doesn’t need to start acting up.
“Welcome home, Captain,” Jarvis’s voice greets him as the elevator doors open into the penthouse. “Your personal effects have been placed in the third room to the left.”
That gets a grin, which Natasha tries to hide behind the mouth of her bottle, and an eyeroll, that she makes sure he can see. “Come on, then,” she jerks her head towards the mats spread out along another stretch of mirror. “Let’s see if you remember anything from last time.”
Taking a deep breath as the elevator slows, Tony pushes himself upright. “What’ve we got, J?” he asks as the doors slide open again. He steps out and activates the deployment bracelets for the suit as he heads towards the landing pad, glad he’d remembered to put them on. He really needs to be better about that.
“The team knows we’re not sleeping together,” Tony insists. “They wouldn’t like it.” And he knows they don’t see Steve as a national icon, not really, not anymore, but if anyone knows what a trainwreck Tony is, it’s their team, and there’s no way any of them want that for Steve, national icon or not.
Agent Godfrey laughs again, and waves at the other agents. “Let’s get a move on, folks. We’re on a deadline.”
Steve blinks. “Yes,” he says slowly. “But I’m not quite sure how you think I could hurt Tony. I know we fight a lot, but I wouldn’t –”
Steve’s mouth does the almost-smile thing again. “It should taste good, too,” he points out. “Just be careful not to burn yourself.”
“Great.” Tony steps into a pair of shoes, ties them off, and heads for the elevator, Jarvis pulling up lights as he goes.
And Steve’s left with a half-finished sketch of Tony’s tower, a slowly-cooling drink, and his own noisy thoughts. “Well, hell,” he says aloud, and barely refrains from dropping his head onto the table.
Clint eyes him. “We wouldn’t want to interrupt your connubial bliss,” he says, and he almost sounds sincere.
Steve is starting to get whiplash from this conversation. It’s an unfortunate side effect of talking to Fury, sometimes, even though it always seems to turn out later that everything was actually connected. It’s trying, but he usually at least attempts to keep up. “You were,” he pauses, “close?” he decides on. “With Howard Stark.”
“I couldn’t say, Captain,” Jarvis replies, which sounds vaguely foreboding, but at least not as if another alien invasion is imminent.
Steve can feel the heat of embarrassment creeping up the back of his neck. “It wasn’t intentional,” he feels compelled to point out.
Tony carefully hangs his towel over the back of a chair, next to the one Steve used, and tries to decide which of the openings he’d practiced while brushing his teeth will be the least likely to end in bloodshed.
Bright sunlight floods in, and, with it, the view of Manhattan, spread out below him like a child’s mess of a patchwork quilt.
“They’ll buy that Captain Rogers does, and Tony would do anything for the love of his life, right, Tony?” Ms. Potts gives Tony a significant-looking eyebrow raise. He grins back, bright like he does for the cameras.
Tony looks startled for a moment, but his eyes flicker briefly back towards the party and he relaxes.
Clint shrugged. “What can you do? One foot in front of the other. It doesn’t go away, not really, but you let it be a part of you instead of all of you. And that’s good. You don’t want to forget, but you need to let yourself move on, if you can.”
Tony blinks. “I. Yes?” He is not awake enough for this. He gives himself a little mental shake. “I mean, no. I mean.” Tony throws a glare at the slow drip of coffee. It refuses to speed up. He turns back to Thor, who is still beaming happily at him, though starting to look a little confused. “My – Rhodey – my friend – best friend – he’s coming in tomorrow night. Tonight, more accurately. He’ll be my best man.” Tony frowns, a little. “I hope, anyway. I haven’t asked him properly, but he claimed it decades ago, so he gets right of first refusal.”
The mission itself only lasted three days, plus another half-day on each end for travel, but by the time Steve gets back to the Tower after debriefing at SHIELD, he feels like he’s been gone for a month. He’s a little surprised at himself, but he also realizes he’s missed Tony while he was gone.
“Of course,” Natasha nods, smacks Clint’s hand when he tries to reach for the folder. “Do you want to do the paperwork?” she asks.
“What’re we all standing around for, waiting for takeout?” Steve asks, approaching rapidly as the elevator doors slide shut behind him.
The bang and crackle of late night fireworks outside the Tower windows make them both jerk in surprise.
The sound of Tony swearing comes loud and clear over the comms, then the whine of the repulsors as he gets himself back under control.
“What?” Steve looks up, startled, from his contemplation of the tiles, as though they might hold the answers he’s looking for.
“Do I need the suit?” Tony asks, but he doesn’t mean it. There’s no hostility there that Tony can sense. Hasn’t felt any since he crashed in the field outside. There’s just a background tension there, making the air between them vibrate with a frequency Tony can’t hear. He wonders if Steve can hear it, with his enhanced senses.
And this, this right here is what Steve keeps forgetting in the heat of the moment, when his blood’s up and the adrenaline is high, when he’s worried, or angry, or frustrated. Right now, in
“Sometimes,” Steve says, voice still low, eyes fixed on his hands, and Tony has to shake himself out of his thoughts, “I’m back there. In the middle of a battlefield, or on the Valkyrie and going down. Sometimes I can pull out of it. Sometimes I can’t tell what I’m pulling out of.” He looks up at Tony then, meets his eyes. “Sam asked me once if I was thinking about getting out. Out of the military. Out of SHIELD. Out of fighting. I told him I didn’t know what I’d do with myself if I did. I don’t. I don’t have anything else. If I’m not Captain America, what am I?”
What seems like only a moment later, Tony blinks his eyes open and realizes he’s missed more than half the movie. He’s got one hand wrapped loosely around Natasha’s ankle, the other flopped on Steve’s thigh, and he’s somehow cuddled up against Steve’s side, head on Steve’s shoulder. Steve has an arm draped over Tony’s shoulders, probably because it couldn’t have been very comfortable to have it trapped between them, though possibly just out of habit at this point.
From the look Fury is giving him, though, that wasn’t what he’d meant. “If you were going to kill each other, you would have done it by now,” is what he says. “No one is expecting any miracles from the two of you on that score. But being married isn’t about not fighting, it’s about picking your battles, and having them in the privacy of your own damn home.”
The view and the early morning sunshine that streams in when he pulls back one of the curtains go a long way towards making him feel better. It’s hard to hate the world when it looks so incredible.
At the soft sound of his name, Tony spins, screwdriver held out defensively, but it’s just Steve. Of course it’s Steve. No one else could get in without Jarvis causing a fuss. At least, no one who would be looking for him at this hour. “Steve.” Tony forces himself to relax, straighten, lower the screwdriver. “What can I do for you?”
“Well, it’s appreciated.” Steve knows he sounds stiff, but he was mostly not thinking about the wedding, and getting along well for it.
“Ms. Potts is on the line for you, Sir,” he explains before Tony can remind him that he’s officially not home, and shouldn’t be getting calls, anyway. “She asks that you not make her come down here again, or she will ensure you attend and participate in every accounting meeting next quarter.”
“I don’t know what’s got your star-spangled panties in such a twist,” Tony snaps back, slaps away the book Steve still has up in front of him, “but I suggest you –”
The washcloth is warm, and Tony lets Steve clean him up, thinks maybe he should protest, but all the stress from earlier was exhausting, and orgasms make him sleepy. “Stay,” he says, catches at Steve’s wrist when he goes to move away. He maybe shouldn’t ask for this, but his filters are low, and he doesn’t want to sleep alone. Not now.
Tony takes a deep breath, because another outburst is not what anyone needs right now, least of all him, when he has to go out there and, fuck,
“As part of the remodel, Tony designed apartments in the Tower for all the Scoobies,” Pepper sounds equally long-suffering. Tony figures she, at least, is probably entitled. “Sorry, Captain,” she adds across the table to Rogers.
For half a second Steve just stares at him, then he breaks out in laughter again, pulling Tony in closer.
There’s a huff of air over the comm, but Steve doesn’t argue. A moment later, he and Natasha jump lightly out of the train. Barton joins them after another few seconds, and Tony drops to the ground next to him. For a long moment, they all just look at each other in the dim lighting.
“You’re right,” he says, and Steve’s not entirely sure he’s not speaking to himself. “I don’t learn. I shouldn’t push. Have you ordered anything to drink?”
ever share anything – but I’ve read the files. Stane mentored you, practically raised you, and then locked you out of your own company, and McPherson was a honeypot.”
Tony starts to nod automatically, then freezes, mid-nod, and narrows his eyes. “You kiss babies with that mouth?” he demands, and it’s not like he’s never heard Steve swear, but not usually so casually, and he can see the way the corner of Steve’s mouth is twitching, trying to curl up into a smile.
“If they’re calling you out for bank heists, I will personally have words with Director Fury,” Pepper is full-on frowning, now. “The police can handle it, they don’t even need SHIELD, let alone you and the rest of the Bod Squad.”
Steve abruptly recalls talking to Tony on their first date about drawing, and his mother, and her irritation over his penchant for using charcoal. He can’t believe Tony remembered. Or cared enough to do something like this. And it had to have been Tony. Even if Jarvis or Ms. Potts (or both) had actually carried out the setup, Tony had to have given them very specific instructions, and Steve is almost positive the note is Tony’s handwriting.
Tony leans back against the counter and shrugs. “Jarvis screened them. I figured you had it under control, and I didn’t want to rock the boat.”
“And it has mostly worked very well,” Pepper agrees. “You’re very creative when you’re feeling vindictive, and you’re less likely to piss the board members off if you’re quiet. But
. “Enough stalling,” she says, and that’s the end of that. “You won’t get better just standing here.”
Tony waits, doesn’t know what to say to that, doesn’t know if Steve’s still going, but the silence stretches.
Tony thought, thought about the people he loved. Pepper and Rhodey weren’t speaking to him. Peter wasn’t speaking to him. Steve was dead. Jarvis was a Skrull and he never, even for a second, noticed. There was an entire invasion and Tony never noticed.
“Aww Normie’s doing this? Didn’t know he cared.” Parker didn’t take off his mask, but the disgusted look on his face was easy enough to visualize. “Should I be worried?”
He felt a possessive curl deep in his stomach every time one of them tried the blue ring, loosening at every failure. That’s Steve’s, his mind supplied, even though that was ridiculous, even though Luke and Peter and Sam had been using it for months. Steve loved that ring; the voice in his head repeated, and he forced the voice out.
Steve loved the blue ring. “It just feels right,” he confided in Sam while they patrolled. “Using it, it’s like you know you’ve done something good. It only works if you feel right. It can make a shield, see? Not everybody can use it, but I bet you could.” And so Sam did and, even without his wings, he began to fly. Peter learned the same trick, flying around the streets with the blue ring under his costume. Peter stuck a note on the safe Tony kept the rings in, “save green or blue for your friendliest Spider-person,” because no matter how hard or long he tried with the others nothing ever happened.
Charles Xavier seemed to take an interest in the indigo ring. “If nothing else they do, at the very least, seem rather useful, don’t they? Shielding, healing, flight—all without your suit, Tony?” Tony wanted to shift a little but managed to keep his back straight. His voice came out robotic when he said, “I’d be nicer if any of the other ones worked for me anymore.”
Osborn tried to use the violet ring for what must have been the fiftieth time. Stark leaned up from the wall, watching him, or something else, with rapt fasination. This was not the first time. This would not be the last time.
He stood stock still as the rest tested the violet ring, only loosening when Black Bolt was the only one to even make it twinge. At least he could still be useful. Tony was tired of people taking things from him.
Strange set the box down on the table. “It’s a language. The writing on and inside the box. A language and what appears to be an explanation on the properties of these rings. They seem to be based on, well, personality traits perhaps isn’t the right word to use here. Concepts might be more accurate. Concepts and how individuals embody them. And from what I can tell, they can do considerably more than what we have seen from them so far. Richard, you mentioned you thought they might be from another universe?” Reed nodded. “I think something like that might be the case. This marking on the top,” he ran his finger across a circular marking, “seems to translate to something like ‘elsewhere.’ And the marking on the side name the rings, the what they represent, and what they can do. In the right hands.”
with security codes. He built a ball that would only open for his thumbprint, left it in a safe hidden in his office. Sue Storm screamed at him for corrupting, for manipulating her husband, threw the white ring at him like she couldn’t stand to keep something Tony had given her. It hit his chest, rolled down onto the ground, and now he had that one too. He’s had too many factors to deal with, quasi-military organizations to run, former friends to avoid, nightmares to sink into, to many points and worries to expend so much energy to the rings, but he did need to deal with them. They were too powerful to leave locked up in SHIELD, too much danger into falling into the wrong hands, even though Tony could hardly tell who the right hands were anymore.
Each of them had their favorites. It took a while for any of them to work their way up to trying one on, but eventually, after several days, intensive examination from the Fantastic Four, more scientists, two more psychics, and three magic users, it was eventually determined they would never figure out what the rings did unless they used them. And so they did.
Tony’s first reaction was an embarrassing, inexplicable feeling of hurt. Then the full implications hit him.
“It’s easy, mama!” Toni assures her mother, not aware that a three year old shouldn’t be able to do what she can do.
Toni had been a little confused at the sheer amount of requests she already had waiting for her. It hadn’t come this easy in Richford, and she had had the added benefit of people already loving her parents there!
“Yes, I do,” Toni confirms, curling up, expecting the same insults and scoldings she gets from her classmates and teachers.
“These two lives in particular are simply linked, in a way. There will come a point in Phase 2 that Phase 1 will be remembered by you, your soul,” Soul steps in, cooling Power’s anger.
“Annie, honey, what’s going on?” Alice grabs Toni’s chin gently, tilting her head up to meet Toni’s chocolate eyes.
Toni snaps to attention, gasping for breath. She hadn’t realized she’d been holding her breath. She looks away from the man in front of her just as tall, strong, and brunette gets up and checks on him, grabbing his shoulder and asking if he’s okay.
Okay, listen. So, I was going to have Toni write “At Last”. You know, the version Etta James sang, but that made me uncomfortable because I didn’t want to just,,, have Toni, a white woman, be the one to write it? I mean, I know Etta James isn’t who wrote the song, but it can’t be denied that she’s the one who made it extremely famous and I didn’t want to take that away from her. I also don’t know if Toni could muster something like that (because she’s not a super flowery person, she’s more straightforward), so the song is “Daydreamin’” by Ariana Grande. Because listen guys, I think that song is cute as hell and it’s completely true to Toni and Steve lol. It’s not really the big love admission I was initially looking for, but I decided to just give that to Toni in classic panicked babbling form. I took out some bits to make it a bit shorter and less modern (none of the stuttering or anything like that).
“Do you want me to stop, kid?” she asks, not wanting to make the child any more uncomfortable than she already is.
Toni’s heart sinks down her chest and settles heavily in her stomach. “So I was right? I’ve been reincarnated? As my
“That’ll be $0.35 Mr. Carson. I don’t give discounts for unwanted advances. Now, the $0.35, if you please,” Toni has gathered her tools through his bout of spluttered curses, turning with a large and heavy wrench in hand, poised in a defensive manner.
“Yes. You wielded us effectively in your home universe, Antoinette. Your time as Antonia Maria Stark has passed, as her body did when you wielded us. Your soul, however, has moved on to a new identity. A Phase 2, you could say,” Reality, despite lacking facial features or inflection in their voice, came across vaguely amused.
“Ah, yes, darlings, we haven’t had such a warm welcome in quite some time,” their mother bowed at the waist and held out her hand for their father, who grabbed it and spun into his much shorter wife’s embrace.
“I wasn’t lookin’ to do business. I was lookin’ for some pleasure,” his presence moves forward once again, and Toni screws in the last fastener for the shell of the radio before turning it on. A boxing match rings clearly through the air as Toni flies from her crouch, twisting to face the man who is now only a foot or so away from her.
“It’ll be fine,” Tony says, already itching to sink back into the new prosthetics he’s been working on.
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that. “What’s in this file?” he asks eventually, isn’t sure that’s the most important thing, but it’s been a while since he’s hacked into SHIELD, and he doesn’t know what they’ve changed in his absence. He makes a mental note to look into it.
Tony nods, still trying to get his breathing and heart rate under control. He presses one hand hard against the cover of the arc reactor, grips the sheets tight with the other, and tries to count slowly in his head while he breathes. In. Hold. Out. Hold.
Tony looks as baffled as he always does when Steve asks questions about his work, but answers gamely enough. “No, nothing new, just some specs for the new phone SI wants to release in a couple months. R&D was having some trouble with the new battery integration, so I said I’d check it out.”
“It’s like the Pied Piper, but backwards,” Tony tries to explain, keeps tracking the movements of the rats in the video feeds he’s getting. “They’re not being created or blown up or –”
Tony opens his mouth to say something – probably to brush this off, too – but Steve sees a gaggle of finely coiffed women descending, and decides to test his theory. Before Tony can say anything, Steve tenses, tightening his arm around Tony’s shoulders, partly in warning, and partly because he knows that’s how he tends to react when he’s bracing for impact.
Reeling a little from the unexpected one-eighty in a conversation they’ve barely even started, Steve snaps out, “At least I’m learning,” before he’s even thought it, and watches as Tony’s face completely shuts down. He opens his mouth to say – something, anything – he doesn’t know, but Tony cuts him off.
The couple laugh like Tony’s told some great joke, and maybe he did, but Steve is more familiar than ever with Tony’s paparazzi smile, and he can see the slight tension at the corners of Tony’s mouth and eyes that he’s pretty sure no one else notices. Certainly these people can’t tell the difference – or don’t care enough to – and they wander off still laughing to mingle with other rich people.
Steve blinks, already caught in staring around. “Thank you,” he says automatically, and steps out into what appears to be the living room.
The sound of Iron Man landing behind Steve makes him turn. “Good show, kids,” Tony says, claps his hands together with a squeal of metal that makes Steve flinch. “Breakfast party back at the Tower. No pigeon on the menu, but Jarvis is ordering everything else.” The mask snaps open and he grins at Steve. “Well done, Mon Capitaine. That little twist you did that one time was particularly impressive.”
And that wasn’t even something Tony thought he wanted to hear, but it gets him right where he lives, and he just stands there for a long moment, trying to think of something witty to say, but mostly just gaping like a fish.
Rhodey and Pepper are standing a little way down the hall, talking quietly. They both look up at the sound of Tony stepping out of the room he was using for last-minute preparations.
The suit registers Steve’s grip tightening as they pick up speed, and Tony tells himself firmly that he’s not upset that he can’t actually feel it. He has plenty of opportunities these days to appreciate being pressed up against Steve, feel the warmth of him seeping between them. He doesn’t need this, too, just because Steve looks genuinely thrilled to be clinging to Tony for once, clearly enjoying the way the wind whips past them as they streak through the air above the city. It’s maybe a little inappropriate how much Tony has been appreciating all of the other times they’ve been pushed together, and it’s possible he’s taken more advantage than he should of the constant media presence to tuck in close, or steal a quick kiss or two. But Steve Rogers is a thing of beauty, and as much as he can still get under Tony’s skin, Tony has come to the sinking realization that he truly enjoys spending time with the man, that he likes his sense of humor, and that he honestly wants to learn more about him, hear all the bits and pieces of stories he’s willing to share, and more. It should probably make him feel guiltier than it does, but then he’d have to admit that his definitely-just-a-crush might be a tiny bit out of hand, and he couldn’t handle facing either Pepper or Rhodey if that happened.
“Sorry,” Steve offers a rueful smile and holds up the offending book in explanation. “Didn’t mean to startle you.”
Shrugging it off, Steve heads for his own room to drop his bag, change out of his mission uniform, and grab a quick shower.
“– isn’t that right, darling?” Tony asks, tips his head to look at Steve from his by-now-customary place under Steve’s arm.
has been pleasant. It makes for a surprisingly nice change, though Tony’s a little concerned that Steve might be a pod person, or trying to lull him into a false sense of security. To what end, Tony doesn’t know, but thinking about it is helpful to Tony being able to keep himself in check, and not get too used to Steve being friendly, which is all kinds of dangerous.
“Your tests have come back complete, sir,” Jarvis says, interrupting Tony’s staring contest with the contents of his mug. “There is no significant change in the purity of the output.”
Pepper eyes him critically for a moment, as if she knows exactly what he’s thinking. She probably does.
,” Tony says shortly. He turns away, goes to sort through the cufflink options Pepper left out for him. “I was nineteen, and you promised never to bring it up again.”
like something as why he does. Tony’s pretty sure this is the most Steve has voluntarily spoken around him since they met in Germany, and instead of being bored to tears, Tony is actually, well, having fun. He can almost hear Pepper’s dry voice saying, “Wonders never cease,” and wonders if she’ll be put out when he tells her he had a good time looking at art after she tried for so many years, or if she’ll just be pleased he didn’t somehow burn everything down by tinkering with things better left un-tinkered with.
Sure enough, Steve’s sitting in one of the big armchairs by the windows, looking for all the world completely absorbed in whatever he’s reading.
“It could be a business party,” Tony points out. “At least half of our investors are in there getting trashed to the sounds of the Star Spangled Banner.”
“It would appear there are overly large pigeons attacking passersby in Central Park,” Jarvis reports.
Tony stops at the doorway to Steve’s room, doesn’t follow him inside. “Jarvis will send you whatever we’ve got. Police reports are starting to come in, and SHIELD and Jarvis are crowdsourcing. I’ll meet you with Mr. and Mrs. Smith at the hangar.” He takes several steps backwards as Steve pulls the uniform out of a closet. “Only a couple minutes’ flight up to the Bronx, and we can get underground closer to the hold-up from there.”
“Yes, that’s why you’re here,” Natasha tells Clint, elbows him sharply in the ribs to get him to move. He barely winces, but he sidles along the counter to let her get at the food.
Steve shuffles through the papers again, and he understands what the aim is, now, but the wording hasn’t gotten any less ridiculous. He wishes, for half a second, that he could ask Tony what he thinks of all of this without so many other people around. He feels like he gets more straightforward answers when they’re one-on-one.
“It’s happened five times,” Rhodey corrects, somewhere between gentle and exasperated. “The last time was when you and Pepper split up.”
“It can’t all be bad,” Mr. Cooper says. “I do have internet access, you know, and I see some of the nice stuff getting sent your way.”
Steve scoffs. “Maybe if you’d been less of an arrogant brat, your father would have liked you better.”
For a long moment, Tony just watches him. It’s so rare to see Steve relaxed, Tony can’t help but want to drink in the sight, just a bit, the way he practically glows in the sunlight, comfortable and easy without the sharpness he usually carries in Tony’s presence. Steve’s shoulders are loose under the plaid flannel shirt he’s wearing, and while Pepper is right, the plaid really doesn’t do as much for him as, say, the workout clothes he wears that hug every line of his body, she’s also wrong, because it gives him a certain softness that’s appealing in an altogether different and less comfortable kind of way.
“Paparazzi,” Tony says, low, then, before Steve can turn, “No, don’t look,” and “Don’t punch me,” he adds, leans right up into Steve’s space, and kisses him on the mouth.
It’s all surprisingly touching. And as the majority of Steve’s anger dissipates with these revelations, the guilt he’s been feeling over the things he said rises to the forefront.
“Now, at least,” Time greets Toni in uniform with their compatriots. The rest quickly follow suit, bowing their heads to Toni in a sign of respect for a reason she cannot comprehend.
Toni has a certain tolerance she utilizes when she is heckled. If it’s about her being a woman, she persists with confidence. If it’s about her intelligence, she talks circles around them. If it’s an unwanted verbal sexual advance, her words turn sharp and she ceases all conversation not about her task. If it’s an unwanted physical sexual advance, she beats them to the ground and leaves immediately, her task incomplete if necessary. If it’s already complete, she demands her payment from the broken man she had taken by surprise then leaves him on the floor.
“Another scrap in the schoolyard, Annie?” her mother sighs everytime Toni comes home with split knuckles or a busted lip.
Howard had met the Briggs who, of course, loved him to bits. From then on, Toni introduced Howard to Joey Cartwright, the owner of the diner on Newport with the amazing milkshakes whose Jukebox she’s repaired more than once, Patricia Cuddy, the clumsy school teacher whose enthusiasm for Toni’s intelligence almost parallels Mama and Papa’s, and Beatrice Cook, the quick witted and smile-ready factory worker who keeps Toni company when the machines need maintenanced.  Besides the Briggs, they’re all really work friends. They make Toni happy, though, so she still includes them in her and Howard’s exploration of the town.
“Antoinette for my mother,” Alice, her mother, Toni supposes, answers, a tired but loving smile stretching across her face. She’s pale with freckles splashed across her nose, her blonde hair falling into her copper eyes.“And Alice for me,” she continues, her smile turning into a playful smirk aimed at her husband, Toni’s father.
“Are you sure you can handle it, doll? It’s a pretty big radio,” his voice holds all the condescension of a bully and Toni’s knuckles turn white from pure exertion.
Eventually, Howard begins to pull back. Toni follows him up and grabs his wrist before he can fully stand.
“I have to go get cleaned up and make a run to the grocery store before dinnertime. Would you all like to join me? I think I’ll make spaghetti and tomato sauce tonight!” Toni stops in front of where the Briggs had been relaxing on their couch.
Howard stoops to grab his bag on the way, setting it carefully just inside the door before pulling Toni onto the loveseat.
Opening her eyes to the seeming oblivion surrounding her, Toni can’t help but be a little relieved. That was all a dream. Cool. She can’t imagine growing up in the early 1900s. A shudder wracks her frame before six figures step from the darkness.
, truly, I understand. But I’m 20. It’s about time I get a job, move out, learn some independence. I love you both so much, you know this, but I can’t live with you my entire life. I need to strike out, be my own person, earn my way,” Mary Ellen’s voice is stronger than anything Toni’s ever heard from the typically bubbly woman. Toni compares her to the sun often in her mind, but she somehow overlooked that the sun
Her father kisses the top of her head and her mother squeezes her hand and they both exit to head to their jobs.
“Get offa my sister you yellow-bellied baby dewdropper!” Howard yells, puffing protectively between the bully and his little sister.
Toni remembers them every day. She smiles when she sees the corner her dad would utilize to sell fruit. She can’t make any clothes without feeling her mother’s soft touch to the back of her hands, correcting sewing patterns. She remembers them, she loves them, she misses them. She does not, however, cling to them. Not the way the city folk are.
“Look closer at the base, Annie,” Howard’s voice has dropped to a soft whisper, eyes full of love and longing.
“But the teacher is the same way! She snaps at me when I answer her questions and glares at me when I read quietly!” Toni complains with tears streaming from her eyes.
“Alice, sweetie, what should we name our gorgeous girl?” A male voice dances across the room, a playful affection rooted deep in his baritone. Toni’s eyes snap to him and his warm smile widens. He is holding a toddler, a boy, with the woman’s warm copper eyes and the man’s deep brown hair.
“Maybe actually go to recess every now and then, too. Even a genius needs friends,” She winks and moves back to the front of the library, leaving Toni with her words of wisdom.
“Oh, c’mon, Howie, you know she always harbored a huge crush on you,” Toni laughed and avoided the swat aimed her way.
“The lovely Alice has titled this number “Timeless and True”, a tale of two people finding love in quiet ways.”
Also, Steve’s song is called “Annie’s Song” by John Denver, which I think is a beautiful, short song with just the amount of flowery goodness our Stevie could write lol.
“This has happened with few other souls in the history of our existence, child. When their memories were awakened, they were but a memory for the souls. Fond memories, yes, but detached in a way. You will be safe from such heartache.” Mind assures Toni.
Toni showed Howard some of her favorite haunts, including a couple alley ways where she’d had to beat up some jerks.
They are all similar in form. Tall, broad, and thoroughly androgenous. No discernable facial features were to be seen, but this, for some reason, did not unsettle Toni as it usually would. The only difference between the six figures is that each of them emit a faint glow of color unique to themselves. Green, orange, purple, blue, yellow, and red.
Toni nods. “Alright. Let me get my tools and change into my coveralls real quick. I’ll be back with you shortly.”
“Papa. You and Mama have made a difference in this community, as I’ve stated. You are kind, generous, loving to your customers. You are giving more to the community than I’ll ever be able to truly understand, most likely. I want to be like you guys. I want to help the people in the best way I can. So, I’ve been learning how to repair all common machines I can. Ovens, heaters, ice boxes, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, cars, radios, you name it! I can fix it, guaranteed. Low prices, bartering, even for free if need be. The people need a cheap repairman, and I’m the right girl for the job.” Toni holds her breath, and watches her family’s reactions.
“At least I’ll still be a genius… Is this setting me up for heartbreak?” Toni is hesitant, but bordering on desperate in tone.
“So… do I get this meeting between each of my lives or what?” Toni’s temper has died down to annoyance.
As they open the door, Ernest leans in slightly and whispers, “Thank you for that, Toni. She gets some trouble at school for her reading habits. It’s easy to tell that she already looks up to you.”
“Not many, Antoinette Alice Stark. You were destined to wield us in your home universe, just like you are destined to live out a life as Antoinette Alice Stark, events… confidential as of right now,” Soul also finds this amusing, and Toni’s anger is growing.
They stay in the cold for as long as they can stand, huddled together as they give their silent farewells to their beloved parents.
Life is going very well for the Starks, and for the first time in a long time, they were all breathing easy.
“Hello, my name is Antoinette Stark. My family calls me Annie, but I’ve always preferred Toni. I really like math and science, and am looking forward to learning as much as I can.” Toni finishes with a large smile, beaming at her fellow classmates on her first day of school. She adjusts her blue dress and looks to her teacher for further instruction.
Lenny shows that she’s her mother’s daughter when she bursts her way out of her shell, face lighting up in the same way Blanche’s had earlier in the hallway.
Howard. Alice. Alice was Toni’s paternal grandmother’s name. The man who is now her father looks an awful lot like her old father.
“That we did, darling,” Walter boasts, scooping Howard up in one arm, Toni in the other. Both of the children squeal, laughing wildly as their father flops around, smelling of sweet apples and juicy peaches.
She mentions factories and restaurants and houses and continues to speak 80 miles and hour. With every new word out of Mary Ellen’s mouth, Toni watches Ray and Lucy grow further alarmed, further back into their original stance.
Toni sighs and plops herself down on the other side of Lenny, smiling up at Mary Ellen apologetically.
“You have offended me, and I am a goddess in my own right,” Toni mutters from her position on the ground.
A few months in, a couple weeks after her 14th birthday, she got her first creep. He had heard that she could fix whatever was needed and called upon her for his heater.
“Oh thank God, I won’t remember that Howard is my father my whole life as his sister?” Toni can’t help but be supremely relieved at this upwards turn in events.
Toni, however,  is soon crestfallen. She already knows all of this! She had already worked through all of Howard’s old workbooks and it seems that they haven’t updated curriculum in the past two years. Toni slumps in her seat, but vows to visit the library soon to see what books she can borrow.
“I have room in my apartment, Mary Ellen.” Toni’s words take Mary Ellen by surprise before she lights right up.
“Howie. I will be fine, dandy really, I promise you. Just keep up the letters and we’ll be fine, too,” Toni promises, leaning against the door to their little house- her little house, now.
“Gender is easier for our small minded classmates to understand than class is, Annie. I’m a boy, so it’s acceptable. The world isn’t fair, Anne, and it’s never pretended to be. You’re going to have to fight if you want to continue being the genius you are in the world we live in.” Howard’s seriousness shows in the quality of his voice, his mouth pressed into a firm line, too stern for his 11 year old face.
Sure, she still deals with the odd pervert and her fights outside of her job never really slow down, but she’s become as much of a staple in Brooklyn’s community as she had been in Richford. The people know her, they respect her, and they like her. She feels more at home in Brooklyn than she did in a parentless Richford.
“We’ve been needing our heater fixed for quite some time! What are your rates?” she asks excitedly, not a wisp of discontent on her face.
“... this is the first time anything’s gotten physical, Howard. I should have known better, I pushed Smith too far… I just get so angry when he’s always lying and saying I steal your work or I’m clearly not smart or I’m
That they do. There are a few farewell get togethers she attends, but most of the goodbyes she cares about are done when she’s caught on the street or completing a final repair.
“I’m simply setting boundaries for this professional exchange, Mr. Carson. Now, I only have a few more adjustments to make here, then I will be on my way,” Toni keeps her tone light, but she tenses herself, ready to fend off any possible passes that could come her way.
The four Starks smirk at each other and Toni is bolstered with a stronger confidence than she’s ever felt.
Christmas is taking place in this chapter, bois, so prepare for some relationship and friendship goodness!
Even if she did live with Mama and Papa for most of her life, she’s always felt independent. She enjoys the freedom of living by herself- her family home simply feels wrong when it’s just her instead of the loving family that once inhabited the small house.
Toni considers her father words for a few moments before nodding. “That sounds completely fair to me. Thank you for allowing me this chance.”
A few moments after they’ve settled down, their father pops out of the bedroom, a luscious feather boa wrapped around his neck and lipstick smeared onto his lips.
“I’d rather be a cancelled stamp then play at being a bimbo, Smith, now move!” Toni angrily stands, shoving the other child to the side as she stalks through the crowd of bandwagoning children, intent on sneaking into the library to read for the duration of recess.
“We understand, child. You’ve done great things for this community. None of us ever really expected you to stay here for too long- we figured you’d follow in your brother’s footsteps sooner rather than later,” Mrs. Daley grabs her hand with a warm smile on her wrinkled face.
A quick seven hours later, Toni sits down at the table with her parents. They both look uncertain and nervous, but quickly hide it when Toni turns to them.
“I call first bath, then you can clean yourself up and you can meet my first friends.” Toni closes the door, his gobsmacked face the last thing she sees.
“Here. My landline and post box are on these business cards. I post a week’s worth of appointments on the bulletin board at the Post Office. They can just pull the date and time stub they want, write the appropriate information on the lines provided and drop it into my Post box. Or they can call and work out an appointment that way. Thanks for the offer, Ernest.” Toni hands him a few business cards.
“. . . Is that supposed to make me feel better?” he asks, releasing Toni and pursing his lips at her.
“We aren’t granting this to you because we want- or need- you to find a job. We’re doing this because you’re obviously miserable. Maybe reconsider the college aspect of our discussion last night. It doesn’t have to be anywhere fancy or large, but you’ve always enjoyed learning and creating above all else, just like your brother. Just think it over, honey,” Her mother interrupts her when she’s about to protest, a smile on her face.
Luke Cage was the first person to actually find the box and, as a sensible sort of person, when faced with a broken down wooden box in the middle of a counter with a gold latch on the side and intense, black indented scribbles written on nearly every inch, which had, he distinctly remembers, not been on the counter when he had been sitting there ten minutes ago, turned and walked out the door. Jessica Jones, who had followed him into the room, took one look at the box and followed him right back out. “This is going to be some kind of weird Avengers thing, huh.”
“That was really rude,” Tony called after him, but Strange only gave a swift flick of his hand before he was gone.
Strange’s explanation was absolutely fascinating, and Tony would have been riveted if it hadn’t entirely involved magic. He hadn’t realized how many questions he’d left in the back of his mind about what exactly made up the rings. How they were made, if he could replicate them, and he realized he hadn’t spared a thought to them in at least a year. Where had his curiosity gone.
“With the messages?” Storm asked, stretching, as his sister wandered off. “No idea. I think Osborn’s got a mole.”
Peter continued to babble and Steve opened the box. Expectations were low, or high depending on how one looked at it. Low for anything they wanted to deal with and high for danger but what none of them really expected to find at the bottom was seven small rings.
In another world, perhaps, Tony Stark forgot the Civil War, forgot his time as Director of SHIELD, his life on the run, the lives he mourned.
Tony dealt with bomb threats, nukes, several highly persistent villains, the general hell of running SHIELD, and a past Steve Rogers coming to torture him, before Dr. Strange called another meeting. Tony supposed he must have been busy, but he couldn’t imagine he’d been busier than Tony had been. And besides, all in all, it was still sooner than the Illuminati usually meet with one another.
In this world, he woke up in a hospital bed with Pepper on one side of his bed and Rhodey Rhodes on the other, hesitation on each of their faces, and asked about Norman Osborn.
Tony opened his mouth to explain but was cut off by Reed who launched into a long, tech-heavy explanation on the rings, their mysterious arrival, their various properties, and the effects they were able to produce. Tony cut in on occasion to give a little more detail on the history, but let Reed do most of the talking. Reed had been talking a lot less, lately. It was nice to hear his voice. “It’s fascinating—they react fundamentally differently depending on who’s using them. There’s a limited amount of crossover in the power they can produce. Even people who were able to use the same rings didn’t necessarily create the same power when using the same ring. It’s fascinating—it’d be so hard to design technology so individualized to the person.”
He felt himself shiver, set the small silver ball that held the rings down, letting his armor phase back into his body for just a moment so he could press his fingers in. The ball uncurled and Dr. Strange’s eyes widened slightly when he saw the rings on the table, focusing in and picking up the yellow one examined it. Black Bolt frowned. “And what,” he asked, “are those?”
The Avengers decided early on the rings should be communal. Tony locked them up in the Avengers tower, but if anyone wanted one to use, even if they weren’t an Avenger, they only had to ask. This would not be the case for long, but that was then and then it was.
The one fortunate side effect in Osborn’s current level of power was that he needed to have at least some plausible deniability when it came to committing horrifying acts in defiance of the laws of man. There are murders one can get away with as a giant flying goblin and there are murders one can get way with as the head of a spy organization and there is little overlap in the venn diagram between the two. Fortunately for Peter Parker.
You won’t be able to use it, you know, Stark said. It’s not in your nature. It’s not why you do what you do. Stark’s face was bloody, but he smiled, a secret sort of smile. He never said anything past the first time. Today was no different.
It’s true that Toni’s never let a few weasels stand in her way before, but this is… different. Toni hadn’t yet been able to find someone to accept her for who she is. She’s bold, sassy personality wise, spitting out sarcastic comments the moment a man questions her position in the community or doubts her intelligence. Some have called her defensive- mainly Howard and Mary Ellen- but Toni likes to say she’s on top of the game.
To her non-perverted customers, she was warm and considerate. She took whatever they could afford to give her, and never once complained. She got her jobs done efficiently and provided witty banter along the way. The people of Richford soon loved her as much as they loved her parents.
“No, Ma. I need to do this. I need to be independent. It doesn’t mean you guys lose me. I swear, it doesn’t. I’ll still be in Brooklyn, you’ll still see me.” Ray smiles warmly at Mary Ellen and turns to Lucy, pride shining in his eyes.
Toni wants what her parents had. Love, devotion, total acceptance, and just… clicking so easily and naturally. She doesn’t want to just find someone with a shit personality and big muscles then go to town. That’s not what she wants, not in any way.
“Stark Industries, right? I’ve seen the company logo designs you keep with your machines,” Toni smiles, leaning into Howard.
Howard only raises an eyebrow at the kids, helping Toni up off the ground. He places his arm around her shoulders, smirking at Emma Brown. “Annie here is the smartest person I know, including me. She’s a bona-fide genius, truly better than you Dumb Doras in every conceivable way.”
“Enough of that, young lady. You are 13 years old, the responsibility of this family lies with your mama and I, not you or your brother.”
Toni’s answering smile is quite large. “Oh, Lenny, you wound me,” Toni clutches her chest and arranges her face in a tragic grimace, “None of that Miss mess. Toni will be just fine. You didn’t answer my question, though. Interests?”
“Annie,” he breathes out and drops his face into her hair, bag falling to the ground as he wraps her in a boa strength hug.
“Ernest mentioned you’d discount the price for some good conversation? Or a meal? I’ve got some sausage right here-” he crowds Toni’s space and the exact moment his hand comes in contact with her hip, her fist smashes into his cheek, pushing him back a few feet as he stumbles with the blow. Toni gets in a powerful 1-2-3 jab, cross, left hook before he falls to the ground.
A flush of infuriated humiliation rips across his face before he lunges for the coins and slaps them into her hand.
“Do you want me to teach you how to fight, Annie?” Howard is looking intently into Toni’s eyes and she’s a little taken aback.
Once they have gained permission from Blanche, they’re off to the diner. Toni’s still in her work coveralls and some grease is streaked up her arm. Lenny’s in her regular school clothes, but both are relaxed and happy, laughing the whole way to the diner.
Toni closes her eyes against the deafening silence that answers her. After a few moments, she opens her eyes to see Howard looking defeated.
Writing this fic has been so much fun thus far, and it’s very easy to grant a lot of the credit to you guys. Every review is new weight in the enormous dog pile of love I feel, so thank you all, very, very much for reading.
Their father began, his smooth baritone crooning out sweet words of love and light, leaning further into their mother’s embrace. Her head popped out from around his shoulder and her clear soprano mixed with his voice, her own words pouring like honey from her mouth.
Howard had yet to meet Mary Ellen, but he was a big fan of her purely based on how much “livelier” Toni has seemed since becoming her friend. Mary Ellen is also a fan of Howard. Toni sometimes catches her just… looking at the picture of Howard and Toni that she had insisted be taken the last time he came to visit. When Toni interrupts, she turns bright red and scuttles away, making excuses to leave the room.
“It was my fault, again,” Baby Blues’ eyes are red and his deep voice comes out a little wheezy, but his small smile as he turns back to her is the most beautiful thing she’d ever seen.
“Is it easier for you? To be away from Richford?” his voice is muffled in her hair and Toni’s heart aches somehow harder at his question. She has to swallow the lump in her throat before she can answer him.
Toni travels to Brooklyn 3 times in the next month to prepare for her move to the city. The first trip, she simply wanders to take the city in, becoming as acquainted as one can in a single day. The second trip fell the day after her 18th birthday, and she spent this trip at the main government building, updating all of her identification and paperwork. She signed a lease for an apartment in downtown Brooklyn on her last trip, which she’s excited about despite the sleazy landlord. All that’s left is to say goodbye to the people of Richford.
“You guys won’t regret this, and neither will I, I swear,” Mary Ellen smiles the sun-shiniest smile Toni’s ever seen and starts to babble about her options.
“You said yourself we needed a workable alternative,” Fury points out, and Steve is surprised to realize he knows the man well enough to detect the hint of smugness.
“Right.” Tony shakes his head again, then the rest of himself for good measure, and walks determinedly out of the library. “Give me a warning with enough time to get ready for the interview if I’m not back up by then,” Tony says, and turns his attention resolutely back to pacemakers as he takes the elevator back down to his workshop.
“You get to marry Captain America,” he says aloud to his reflection. “You get to go out there, and kiss Steve fucking Rogers on the mouth, and promise to be his husband. This might not be the absolute worst thing to ever happen.” Instinctively, he touches the center of his chest, feels the smooth solidity of the arc reactor as it hums, the light hidden under the layers of his suit.
Worrying about it doesn’t seem to be helping, though, and it’s not like Steve has a lot of time right now. He gives himself a firm mental shake, and pushes himself to his feet.
Which is all maybe a little unfair of Tony, even in the privacy of his own head, but he thinks he should be allowed. He’s been so good for months, now. They’ve only had a few spats since the thing after the alligators, only one of them semi-public, and even Steve had to eventually agree that Tony pulling those teenagers out of the cave-in was worth the damage to the armor on that one. It was only cosmetic, anyway. Even Pepper’s been impressed with how many SI meetings Tony’s actually shown up for, and if the looks she’s given him have said she knows exactly why he’s sitting in a conference room instead of in his apartment or workshop, well, he’s still there.
“No,” Rhodey agrees softly. “And now you do, and I know it’s all tangled up in the way you two fight, and your dad. And maybe
Up to now, Steve has mostly been letting Tony call the shots when they’re out in public, has just been following along. But he can be better. It’s not as if he dislikes Tony, and maybe if he tries more with this, other things will be easier between them. It wasn’t fair for him to just assume being forced together more often would make them get along better. Just because he’d never planned on being in a relationship with
“I’ll just,” he jerks his head towards the front door. Agent Godfrey waves an acknowledging hand at him and one of the other agents straightens up like he’s going to salute and thinks better of it, but no one else even glances in his direction. “Right,” he says, and heads outside, not bothering to lock the door behind him.
“Yes,” Tony says before he can talk himself back around again, and his stomach swoops at the look that crosses Steve’s face, surprise and something a little like hope. “If you – I – we – yes.”
he slept, which, well, fair – and he’d even gotten them both coffee refills one of the times Tony actually sat with him.
Tony looks Steve full in the face at that, wonders if that’s why he’s awake now, if his nightmares are full of gunfire and bodies or ice and nothing. He almost asks, almost offers to listen, almost shares, but the words stick in his throat, caught between his still-jagged breathing and the heartbeat he hasn’t quite brought down yet. “Tea?” is the only thing he manages to get out.
Steve watches for a moment, then gives himself a firm mental shake and goes to collect the things he doesn’t want random SHIELD agents prodding through.
Steve snorts. “No. But the two of us are stuck in this together. This isn’t something either of us wants, but at least we’re in the same boat, and if it’s what the team needs to be able to do its job, well, it’s a lot better than some of the things we’ve sacrificed.”
“You have no idea,” Tony tells him, then gives Ms. Potts a cheeky half-smile when she narrows her eyes at him.
a publicity stunt, in the simplest terms. He’d always thought getting married would be more. Intimate. Personal. Something he’d planned with the person he was marrying, not a battle plan discussed at a table.
“We finalized the pre-nup with the lawyers this morning,” Ms. Potts explains. “They were going over it until late last night, but it should be all set now. We just need to get it signed and notarized. Thank you for coming up to be a witness.”
“Draw professionally?” Steve asks, looks like he’s considering for a long moment. “I don’t know,” he says finally. “I haven’t thought about it in years.” He smiles a little ruefully, and, “Well, decades,” he corrects himself. “Since before the war. Even when I was doing it for the war effort it was just to be doing something useful, it wasn’t what I wanted to be doing.”
– whatever Steve may have been yelling about – but he is a little sore, and he’s got a fairly impressive black eye that probably wouldn’t go over too well with the director of the Japanese engineering company he’s trying to contract.
Steve almost says that’s exactly what he’d like not to do, when he realizes Jarvis doesn’t mean the penthouse, or his room there, even though that’s where Steve’s been living since he moved to the Tower. He hasn’t thought about the apartment Tony set aside for him, as he’d done for the others, hadn’t been a hundred percent sure until this moment there even was one, though why Tony would have apartments for everyone but him, he’s not sure – if nothing else, Tony has never been petty in that way. “I’ve never seen it,” Steve admits, unnecessarily, since Jarvis would know if he had. “Could you take me there?”
“We have a situation,” Pepper announces. There’s something off in her voice, and that’s what makes Tony turn. The tight twist of her mouth makes him frown.
“On whatever happened on your mission.” Ms. Potts makes a face as she says it. Steve tries not to smile.
“What about before that?” Tony asks, and he’s genuinely interested, hopes Steve realizes that, and doesn’t think Tony’s mocking him. It wouldn’t be the first time.
But Coulson’s nodding. “A marriage is infinitely more believable. And it is far less likely to end up accidentally offending the people you are trying to help when it ends. A broken engagement could easily come off as a mockery as well as a publicity stunt, whereas a failed marriage is an attempt at permanence, and then two people who didn’t work the way they’d thought they would at the start of the thing. Divorce rates aren’t as high as people tend to believe, but they are still fairly high, especially for high profile couples. The marriage would have to last for some time, though, to prevent any negative backlash regarding divorce rates among same-sex couples, since they are significantly lower than with heterosexual marriages.”
“Only when it suits the media,” Tony reminds him, turns around, still holding the gauntlet and screwdriver. “And mostly –” his voice cuts out, and he has to tilt his head back a little to see Steve’s face. He hadn’t realized he’d gotten so close, and it’s abruptly difficult to draw a full breath. They’re never this close in private, and it’s conjuring up all sorts of memories Tony does not need right now, of every time they’ve ever kissed or danced or stood with Steve’s arm wrapped tightly around Tony’s shoulders, keeping him close for the eagle eyes of society and the press.
“I can’t reach Cap,” Bruce says, ignoring the greeting, “but tunnels and subways and the Other Guy don’t really mix.”
“No, we haven’t,” Steve agrees carefully, when it’s plain Ms. Potts is waiting. He realizes abruptly that the elevator is moving incredibly slowly, unlike the carnival-ride drop he usually gets.
“They’ve shrunk back down and decided they’re bored, if that’s what you mean by ‘done’,” Natasha’s voice comes across somewhere between amused and disconcerted.
Steve glances around the space. There’s not much here he’s particularly attached to, just a few things he’s picked up over the last months, and even those aren’t all that important. He’s still settling in, really, hasn’t had time to make much of a home here. “Why don’t you start out here, Agent…” Steve trails off expectantly.
Steve shrugs. “Not something that comes up a whole lot. And I haven’t drawn professionally since I made it over to Europe.”
Tony opens his mouth to lecture – because this is not behavior he can condone – but he’s cut off by an alarm on the main speakers and his phone vibrating its way across his desk where he’d thrown it while he showered.
“No, we’re doing that next – I hope you don’t have anything planned for this morning. Phil’s handling it, so it shouldn’t take long, but you do have to go together, in person, and we’d like to keep it as low-key as possible, since we’d rather people didn’t know you were getting married this weekend until after it’s happened.”
“More like guidelines,” Coulson clarifies. Tony doesn’t find that particularly comforting. “Cap, you’ll be moving by the end of the day. I’ll send a few agents to your apartment when we’re done here to help you with any packing, and they’ll see everything’s relocated without any fuss. You have dinner reservations this evening. It will be private, but not too private. Photographs will be taken of you holding hands at the table and of you returning home together. The rest of your week has been similarly planned. We don’t want to overdo it, but we want it out there before the wedding next Saturday. Ms. Potts, you are drawing up the prenuptial agreement?”
Tony takes the opportunity to kick out of his own boxers, and stretch out across the bed to dig through his bedside drawer.
In the half-light of the kitchen, Steve looks pale and rumpled, sleep pants low on his hips and hair sticking up in several directions like he’d been tossing around against his pillows.
upstairs, he didn’t even show up with his stupid bagels, so he clearly wasn’t all that eager to see me, either.”
To their rapt audience, Steve is pretty sure it looks like Tony is turning him pointedly in the direction of the bar, but Steve is paying attention now in a different way, and he can see the way Tony is carefully shifting them so that he’s firmly between Steve and this newest crowd they’ve drawn.
Pepper clears her throat, taps the clipboard again, says, “Jarvis, would you run a web search for Tony Stark? Just project the first link that comes up.”
Tony steals another glance at Steve, still by the bar with the same woman. Their heads are tipped close, her hair just a few shades lighter than his. Even though the thought makes him grit his teeth, Tony can see they’d make a lovely couple, if a little monochrome for his tastes. They’d have very blond, very tall babies, at any rate. And that’s really not a thought Tony can be having right now.
Tony frowns, rolls his water bottle between his palms. “So that’s why he came to babble some unnecessary apology at me for yelling in public again? He thinks I’m about to keel over at the first big hit?”
certain about – loudly so – is that he still hates the Giants and the Yankees. Tony’s pretty sure Barton puts the games on just to rile Steve up, and he can’t say he minds. Steve can get pretty creative in his outrage, so watching him swear vehemently at the TV is a new experience every time.
Ms. Potts makes a noise that’s half-thoughtful, half-impatient. “Well, now they’re interested. And they’re going to be even more interested if we continue to stand here.”
“This,” Fury continues, like Tony hadn’t spoken, “is a workable alternative. The press will have a field day, but the entire country will eat it with a spoon. Everyone loves a love story. Even Middle America. And at least they’ll be out for both of your blood, instead of thinking you’re out for each others’, so maybe they’ll stop harping on team discord endangering their lives and just go back to baying about immorality endangering their sensibilities.”
“Let me guess,” Natasha gives him a pointed look. “You told him not to bother? Water under the bridge?”
“So it’s just an ‘Oops, you caught us, no one was supposed to know anything until after the wedding’?” Banner asks.
Steve stares. For all Rhodes’s expression and tone, he could have been talking about the weather. “What?” he manages to get out.
They’re on their third loop when Tony starts to slow. “We’ve got a tail,” he says quietly, leaning in a bit, shifting so that they’re angled more towards each other.
The corners of Steve’s mouth twitch, like he’s trying to smile, but doesn’t quite remember how. “Not until tomorrow,” he says.
Steve takes a slow breath and tells himself this is not something he needs to start another fight over. Tony is not actually withholding information, and it’s not even like that’s something he does, not intentionally, he just. Forgets. Or, rather, he gets distracted, or doesn’t think it’s important. It’s not like this is mission-related, anyway, this is entirely personal. And Steve gets the impression it’s more personal for Tony than it is for him.
“Back up whatever footage we got and send a copy to SHIELD to analyze,” Tony tells Jarvis. “I’ll go over it with Bruce when we –” he cuts off when a gloved hand grabs him by the arm. He stops, looks at the hand, then up at Steve’s face. “Did you want something, Cap?”
“The tailor called,” Pepper says, in her infinite wisdom choosing to ignore half of what Tony’s said, along with his tone. “The suit you wanted to wear was delivered about an hour ago. And I had a few things sent over for Captain Rogers to choose from. They used the measurements they have on file, so unless he’s added a few new muscle groups in the last few weeks, everything should fit. You get to tell him he’s not allowed to go in anything khaki and/or plaid.”
His eyes meet Toni’s again and her chest aches. His baby blues are wide and wary, a fire buried deep inside that burns brighter than anything she’s ever seen, and in this moment, Toni is the reckless, enchanted moth unable to stay away.
“Good God,” she whispers, before sighing and speaking up. “Okay. Okay, if that’s what you want, you should do it.” Lucy swallows before sending her daughter a watery smile, reluctant pride in her eyes.
Toni simply nods, resonating with his sorrow but steeling herself against it. Her parents needed this. She would do this for her parents.
“What? No, Howard! You have plans, goals! Dropping out of school won’t help anything!” Toni protests, her soul screaming how wrong this is.
as well as J.R.R. Tolkien’s lecture on said poem. Lenny had nearly died of excitement, hugging Toni around the waist and squealing loudly enough to bring up their grumpy downstairs neighbors.
“I will say, however, that the soul knows who it is familiar with. If you are to meet those you’ve known, you will likely be drawn to them.”
His eyes flick down to the wrench and back to her face. He breathes heavily as he considers his options for a few moments. He growls and shoves a hand into his pocket, retrieving the appropriate money before flinging it at her.
“Well, oh so great one,” Howard teasingly mocks her, setting his bag next to her face, “I brought you a gift, brat, and
“I’m sorry I’m worrying you so much, Howie. And we both know I can’t promise I’ll always be safe. But Howard, these men are just as dangerous outside of their homes as they are inside of them. They definitely have more confidence to try something in their own homes, but the… desire,” Toni shudders at the grossly lacking word to describe their disgusting urges, “would be there if I were to cross their path in the street. All women have to deal with pervy men. I simply have to do so more than the average woman because I enter many homes,” Toni shrugs.
“Howie, can I talk to you?” Toni asks rather meekly, fairly afraid of the discussion they are about to have.
“Now. Enough of this. Mama and Papa would have tanned our hides if they saw us laying around for hours like this,” Toni smirks, walking to the bathroom. "Now, we're going over to meet the Briggs." She spins around in the bathroom doorway.
“I can’t… I can’t stay for long,” his voice is pained, “but I couldn’t not see you. It’s been a month. Have things gotten better?”
“Come inside, Howie,” Toni pulls him inside her apartment, eyeing the Brigg’s door warily. They’ve seen her knuckles, but she’s never discussed her work issues with them. Especially not in front of Lenny. She can stay relaxed for another few years.
“Toni, Toni, Toni! Let’s go visit Mary Ellen at work and get milkshakes!” She’s lunged forward to grab at Toni’s waist, grinning up excitedly at her with big green eyes and a hopeful little smile. That’s playing dirty because Lenny knows that if she makes that face Toni will cave no matter the request.
“Hey Sunshine, I had just gotten home from work when pipsqueak over here demanded come here. For the milkshakes only, it had absolutely nothing to do with you.” Toni smiles and laughs when Mary Ellen smacks her shoulder, leaning away and behind Lenny, using her as a human shield.
“We’ll pay you with money first, next time,” Blanche promises, smiling softly at Toni at the mention of their new friendship.
“Aw, don’t be that way, kitten! I’m just tryin’ to make conversation with ya!” his voice is still deep, and Toni feels his presence draw nearer behind her.
“He’s been helpin’ you since first year, you cancelled stamp,” Smith spits spitefully at Toni, his fury reddening his cheeks. The kids that had gathered around them laughed and jeered “cancelled stamp” over and over.
“Wait, wait, wait,” Toni interrupts, “I thought you said I was special? I’ll not have met any other souls, surely, if they’re all unique to their universes and I am new to this universe?”
Toni glances at Ernest to check for any judgement but simply finds him smiling fondly at his wife’s enthusiasm.
“You misunderstand us, child. Your soul is special because you bounce between two identities. Most souls are restricted to one identity that is present in many universes. For example, in every universe in which he exists, your father is Howard Stark. Gender may vary.”
“How many encounters have you had?” he holds her eye contact, but relaxes slightly, granting her the trust they’d formed over their lifelong companionship.
Startled, Toni follows his command and promptly freezes up, tears filling her eyes. She blinks them away so she can read more of the gorgeous words circling the base, words of love and longing, words of tranquility and contentment, words of loyalty and devotion. Their mother’s songs circle the microphone, words so small and tight to fit as much as possible in  and Toni can just
“Gah! What is this, National ‘Let’s All Abuse Toni and Bruise Up Her Precious, Precious Shoulders Day’?” Toni stands and flounces away from the smacking hands, walking backwards and directly into someone, sending both of them sprawling to the floor.
“I was thinking of doing the same thing,” Howard confesses, smiling weakly at Toni when her shoulders slump.
“That’s mighty kind of you, Toni. It’d be an honor to have you work on our heater,” Ernest shakes her hand, respect written all over his face.
“Are they doing anything to you, Annie?” Howard steps forward, fury burning in his eyes at the mention of the boys in school starting to become attracted to her.
Toni reflects on Howard’s words of wisdom for a moment before steeling her resolve and hardening her will. “Starks are made of iron. Teach me to fight, Howie.”
“I’ve got something you could adjust right here,” Toni doesn’t have to look to know to what he is inferring.
“Howie! Howie! C’mon, Mama and Papa are gonna sing tonight!” Toni calls, racing through their small house to find wherever Howard’s doing his homework.
“I ain’t givin’ you shit, bitch,” he yells, a snarl forming as he wipes no small amount of blood from his nose.
“1… 2… 3!” They both leap up, money left on the counter as they sprint from the diner, laughs knocking around the snowflakes drifting from the navy winter sky.
“Right,” Howard snorts, “I’ll definitely take you up on that, though, Annie… in the meantime, why don’t you just join me in the “lab” rather than sneak out at night? You need to sleep more,” Howard shoves Toni’s shoulder, standing and walking to the bedroom, intent on sleep.
“Hey, Mary Ellen, we gotta go,” Toni turns to see the man Mary Ellen had been flirting with with a hand on Baby Blue’s arm, seemingly supporting him.
The woman is cooing at her, and Toni can’t help but stare at her. She’s so familiar, so comfortable, so safe. Who on Earth is she?
“I… I really like reading. Fiction,” Lenny clarified, surprisingly bold in the face of sharing personal information.
Mary Ellen has become everything Toni didn’t know she needed. She mends Toni’s knuckles after a long day, is amazing at baking (like holy hell so good), and gives Toni another woman to confide in things of which she was reluctant to share with her brother. Calling her a friend almost isn’t enough most days, so she’s upgraded to sister status. She got along with Blanche right away, the two going together like fire on a house. Lenny also loves Mary Ellen, who shares her love for reading. Ernest isn’t forthcoming with his emotions often, but it’s easy to tell he likes her.
Howard had moved on to the next school, so Toni had to put her new fighting skills to use, defending herself as best as she could.
provided entertaining conversation. That’s all the compensation I need!” Toni smiles moves toward their door, which had the same peeling, yellowed paint of Toni’s door.
“Phase 2? As a new person? How many people get this end of the deal, hot shots?” she asks, tired with this discussion already.
“Hey, a girl can only learn from her own experiences how to handle the world,” Toni shrugs, figuring it was probably obvious that she had faced similar struggles. “So. what’s happening with this bad boy?”
“It’s your choice, I suppose. But I don’t think you should drop out, Howie, not at all,” Toni sighs and leans up to hug her brother, unease coursing through her body.
It’s appealing to Toni, being with her big brother again, but at the same time, it’s completely unappealing.
a relief to be away from the townsfolk. They wanted to talk about Mama and Papa all the time. I couldn’t… I couldn’t get away from it. The grief. I said my goodbyes at the funeral, but I still miss them. I see them in everything, Howie. Mama’s voice joins the carolers. Papa’s hands touch mine every time I pick up my tool bag. I taste their cooking in every meal I make. It was like that in Richford, too, but it’s a blessing her in Brooklyn. It felt more like a curse back there.” Toni admits quietly, guilt tearing through her chest. She never would have dreamed of betraying Richford as a child, but the thought of returning made her ill.
“Not a chance. With smarts like those, you two will dig yourselves out of this depression,” their father promised, pride and hope warring for dominance in his tired eyes.
“Good Lord, Walter, we gave birth to two geniuses,” Alice gasps, watching Toni easily complete Howard’s old math workbooks while she finishes mending a client’s shirt. Howard sits next to her, breezing through his current workbooks with the same ease Toni seems to be experiencing.
Black invades her vision and she glances her wife’s beautiful face one last time before she succumbs.
“Well, a great man once said that Starks are made of iron. I’ll just have to prove him correct, now won’t I?”
The next morning is quiet, but good. Neither wants to part, but both know the other will always be there should it be necessary.
“Nah, that’s only at work. If I meet a mouthy fella, I show him how to be a lady. Besides, I’m not the only woman in the city that men feel they can take advantage of,” Toni looks straight forward as she says this, knowing how Howard will react.
Not even a month later, Howard shows up on her doorstep, a bag in hand and a bright smile belied by the concerned eyes hovering above.
The scalding blush that returns with a vengeance is enough answer for Mary Ellen’s grin to turn toothy, the sun bursting from her eyes. Toni can only look down, refusing to encourage the hopeful burn rising in her chest.
Looking to her father… older brother? He is looking at her with curiosity, the hand not in his mouth stretching for her. Almost in a trance, Toni flails back until her baby hand latches onto his. They connect and Toni is overcome with a barrage of emotions too intense for her new tiny baby body. She yawns and lets go of Howard’s hand, turning into her mother’s soft arms and burrowing until she’s asleep.
“That’s right. I’m going to turn our name into something, little sister. I know you sneak out to study my experiments every night. I know you probably know them better than I do or ever will. I could use your smarts around my undoubtedly extremely successful business,” Howard teases Toni. Her heart constricts with the amount of affection pouring into her chest.
Howard stuck around for a couple days after the funeral, insisting that he didn’t have to meet his scientist friends for another few days.
Mary Ellen has found out how to have fun in her independence, and she dates quite often and rarely seriously. She’s dragged Toni on more double dates than Toni cares to admit, all ending in Toni storming away from the scene with an embarrassed and infuriated flush on her face and Mary Ellen staying at her dates for the night, getting a good pounding that she’ll insist upon sharing with Toni the next day. She doesn’t understand why Toni doesn’t just lose her virginity to one of the many men with whom she’s been set up.
“I truly am sorry to leave you all like this. I just can’t… I can’t be here anymore,” Toni admits quietly to her favorite customers, Mr. and Mrs. Daley, a kind old couple who ran through most social circles with smiles and words of wisdom.
“C’mon, Stark! We both know you cheated off your brother! No girl could ever score higher than a boy! Not at anything!” His nasty teeth gnash together as he flaps his jaw at Toni, looming above her after he’d forcefully pushed her to the ground.
Toni just rubs his back and lets him get it all out. Her shirt grows wet and heavy, but she just pulls him tighter to her. They lay this way for hours, soaking each other in.
Antoinette. I never even,” a sob works its way from his throat, “I never even thanked them once for being so amazing,” Howard breaks down against Toni and she falls back onto the loveseat, bringing him down with her.
try to take advantage of me again,” her voice is dripping venom, and she advances threateningly with the wrench still in hand.
“But you’re also the son of a fruit salesman and seamstress. I mean, sure, you’re a boy, but you’re just as smart as me! No one ever gets angry at you for it!” Toni cries more at the simple unfairness of it all.
Howard and Toni continued to grow as much as they could, soaking up more and more knowledge the older they got.
“Okay, Bucky. I’ll, uh… talk to you later?” Toni’s too busy staring in horror at Baby Blues to notice the meaningful glance in her direction, then Baby Blues’ as the man, Bucky, it seems, dons a large, shit eating grin very similar to Toni’s not even five minutes earlier.
“You’ve helped me so much, Toni, I ain’t takin’ that money,” he points a spatula at her, mock threatening her.
“What seems to be the problem with the radio, Mr. Carson?” Toni asks, keeping her voice tight and professional, tension clear in her posture.
“Shit, fuck, oh my God, I am so sorry!” Toni scrambles off of the person immediately, standing and dragging them up with her. Her face is bright red and she sees the grease from her arm smeared all over the person’s white button up shirt.
“Well, I normally have 6 to 10 appointments lined up in one day, so 36 to 60 appointments in one work week. From those appointments, I’d estimate there to be probably 3 to 5 in one work week that escalate to violence,” Toni shrugs slightly, but Howard has paled and leaned back, hands unconsciously coming up from her own to rest on top of her face.
Toni tilts her head to the side, considering the small child before her. She stops just below Toni’s rib cage and seems to be extremely embarrassed by her observation. She can’t be older than 10, and Toni’s eyebrow quirks upward.
Alrighty, guys, that’s it for Chapter 2! I hope I painted Toni’s childhood well enough for you all! Chapter 3 should be up soon! Thank you for your continued support!
“Annie,” he breathes out before leaning his head down and scrunching his knees up to pull her into a hug.
“I can help, though! I’ve been learning a lot about engineering, I could do repairs around the city and-” but Toni’s protest is cut off by her father.
Toni makes it about ten feet before a hand grabs her hair and drags her to the ground, a crushing pressure settling on her middle as Smith presses a knee into her chest, fist cocked back, intention clear.
“Oh, please don’t apologize, Lenny! I understand your excitement. It sounds like an exciting book! I, myself, get that way if someone asks me a couple of engineering questions. When I get going, my brother, Howard, is the only person who’s ever been able to keep up with me. Never apologize for your interests. They’re yours. You’re allowed to be vocal about something that excites you. Don’t shut that away,” Toni’s speech is impassioned, even to her own ears. She clears her throat and takes a bite of her sandwich, awkward in the face of their silence.
“And you, Howie? How are you faring?” Toni pulls back to grip his face and look into his eyes, not trusting him to “burden” her with his emotions on his own.
“Sorry, Ma, Pa. Sorry Miss Toni. I like it- it’s swell,” her blush intensifies once more, but a small smile is present on her face, and Toni counts it as a win.
“I’ll help you with any designs should you need it, Howie, but the business world just isn’t for me. Besides, there’s hardly anything out there that I can understand if you can’t.”
And Toni knows that! She truly does. She knows her parents were a very large part of the community of Richford, they were the ones who inspired Toni to try to make a difference herself. It makes sense that the community is taking it so hard. That doesn’t change the way Toni feels about it.
“I’m so sorry for your loss, Toni, Howard. They were stand up people.” Mr. Martinelli from the hot dog stand downtown is the last straggler at the funeral, and Toni and Howard are quick to dismiss him.
“It’s in the bedroom. Please, after you,” he holds an arm out in the direction of a door, presumably his bedroom, and Toni marches stiffly onward, feeling his slimy eyes slithering all along her the entire way. To her extremely miniscule relief, he stops at the doorway.
“Then they’re all idiots who don’t deserve you anyway,” Howard growls out, clear anger in his voice.
“Well, my new favorite book came out last month! It’s called The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien! It’s fantastic! It has magic and dwarves and elves and magnificent battles and the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, is a hobbit! They’re really short and have furry feet and they don’t like adventure, but Bilbo is different from his people! He goes on an adventure with this wizard named Gandalf and a bunch of-”
“Truly?” He comes flying around the corner, colliding with Toni. They fall to the ground, laughing and wiggling around.
far away from the warmth her and everybody else feels from it. It’s beautiful, and Toni feels connected to Mary Ellen in a way she never had before.
“Your experiences and acquired knowledge in Phase 1 will be relevant to your life in Phase 2. Necessary, even. Dr. Stephen Strange didn’t get around to this universe when he checked the 14 million, you know,” Soul’s cheeky comment sends Toni to the brink of panic.
A lot of customers hire her with the intention of testing her, seeing if her recommendations are accurate. When she lives up to them, those skeptics turn into believers, and she gets more recommendations.
“Antoinette,” he breathes, chocolate eyes shining with love and pride. “Born on October 14th, 1919.” He shakes his head with a smile and moves forward, reaching his hand down to rub a finger down Toni’s cheek. She leans into it and coos form the overwhelming safety and love she’s being coddled with.
She hadn’t experienced a customer like that in a couple of years. She had forgotten how small it can make her feel, the fear of the bigger, stronger man looming over her. While she’s confident that her fighting skills could take down a much larger opponent, even if he isn’t surprised, Toni still experiences the near paralyzing effect that type of fear can blanket over her.
“Ugh, fine. I have to ask your parents, first, kiddo. If they say, then we can go.” Toni points at Lenny, a faux stern look sitting neatly on her face. Lenny just rolls her eyes in response.
“Oh! Well, it’s wonderful to meet you, Briggs family. I’m Antoinette Stark, but you can call me Toni,” Toni’s smile is more genuine by the end of her introduction.
Their last night is spent at Joey’s diner, chuckling over empty milkshake glasses and the cold remnants of a plate of french fries.
“Then you must be an incredibly smart girl,” Mrs. Stevenson smiles at Toni, leaning down to bump shoulders with the 7 year old.
beat them into smithereens.” Toni’s panting by the end of her rant, cheeks bright red and wild eyed.
“Oh! Yes, yes, that sounds wonderful, Blanche,” Toni checks her pockets for her key before shutting the yellowed door and following the family into their own little apartment.
Howard stays with Toni for a grand total of three days before he has to zoom off to another business conference.
“Don’t forget- rent’s due the first of every month,” the pudgy little landlord tells Toni for the fourth time, condescending as he dangles the keys before her like one would tease a dog.
Toni feels sick with the  guilt bubbling in her gut in response to the sweeping wave of relief that whooshes through her body.
“Well if it isn’t my favorite ladies! Welcome, welcome!” Mary Ellen stands up from where she’d been leaning on the counter in front of a rather tall muscular man. While she’s beaming now, Toni had seen that look before. That’s Mary Ellen’s patented “We’re Going To Have Sex At Some Point” smile. And it works every time.
Okay, guys! Sorry, that took a bit longer than I expected! I hope you all liked Steve and Toni’s first date! I don’t think I’ll make it completely smooth sailing for our babies, but I just couldn’t throw a wrench in there so soon! They deserved this, OKAY?
“You most likely will not like it, Howie,” Toni beats around the bush, nervously tugging at her fingers and tapping her feet.
“I know I don’t say it often enough, Annie, but I am so proud of you. You took up their mantle of kindness so easily. You’re a stronger person than I could ever hope to be,” He burrows into her a bit, and Toni almost breaks and demand he stay at least a day more.
“Good as new. That’ll be $0.35,” Toni meets his lustful stare with the hardest eyes she has in her repertoire. He’s shaken off-kilter when she’s done so quick, but recovers quickly, a smirk working its way onto his face.
“I know you said that it isn’t what you want, but you will always have a place in my professional life,” Howard assures Toni, wrapping an arm around her shoulders and squeezing tightly.
“What did I do to deserve such a tenacious sister, huh? What gods have I offended?” Howard smirks and stands, dumping Toni onto the ground and dancing to his bag, away from her flailing limbs.
Papa is blinking rapidly and swallowing repeatedly. Mama isn’t in much better shape. Howard, however, is staring at Toni, eyes sharp.
“I don’t see why not. We already know we get along, plus I wouldn’t mind help paying rent every month. I even know someone who needs an employee, if you’re interested,” Toni barely makes it through the sentence before she has a lap full of Mary Ellen, squealing into her neck.
“Oh, God, and I got a bunch of grease on your white shirt! Jesus, I am so sorry,” Toni groans, keeping her face bent down as she wipes at the stains, only succeeding in spreading the black around.
Toni’s not getting much sleep these days. She stays awake at night, dreading the next day of facing the city folk. She doesn’t need a play by play of their grief for
“Can I have a few too? I’ll spread the word with the ladies at the salon,” Blanche takes the business cards with a wide smile.
“But it is your name, young one,” Space steps forward, bowing their blue head at Toni in a similar manner to Soul.
“But Howard, she’s been stealing your work! She’s been pretending to be smart, trying to be like you, we suspect,” Emma Brown speaks up from the crowd, smiling toothily at Howard, her crush obvious.
has the audacity to be more intelligent than them,” Howard takes a deep breath and wipes at the tears that have rolled down Toni’s face.
“NO!” Lenny shouts in a clearly uncharacteristic moment of volume if her parents’ reactions are anything to go by.
By the time she turned 16, Toni was a staple in the community. While it hadn’t been her original purpose, she was helping her parents out with money quite a bit. While she charged little, she got so much business that it made up for her extremely discounted prices. Her parents were able to relax a bit and even wrote and performed a song for Toni for the first time in many years.
“Static flashes in and out. It also doesn’t receive any stations past the news. I’m missing out on all the boxin’, kitten,” His voice is forced deeper than it had been earlier, and Toni keeps herself alert as she nods.
“I don’t know why you pretend like I’m better than you in any way, Howie. You’re strong, you’re ambitious, you have
“Howard, darling boy, this is your baby sister, Annie,” Alice introduces her to her brother… Howard. Huh, what are the odds?
Howard hadn’t been around much for the past couple of years. He graduated High School early and began travelling around to various business conferences and meetings, learning everything he could about the world of business, making connections, and raising up the social ladder. He was getting closer and closer to his dream of Stark Industries. Toni and their parents couldn’t be prouder of him.
“Eleanor, take a breath!” Blanche cuts Lenny off in an affectionate tone, betraying her stern expression.
“Sorry, guys. I have rules set in place. Conversation and meals are payment, and I was already paid for my services. I break my rules for no one, not even my friends!” Toni answers sternly, hands placed on her hips.
She squeezes her eyes shut and prays the rest of her post box won’t be composed of assholes like Andrew Carson.
“Okay. Okay, I’ll leave you be. And you better believe I’ll keep the letters up, I have near endless designs that’ll require your input,” Howard smiles and steps forward to pull Toni into a crushing hug.
Mary Ellen lets it go for now, but Toni can just feel her devious plans forming from across the room.
felt that way. You were making us proud, Howie. You’re still making us proud. Me, right here in Brooklyn, and Mama and Papa, wherever they are.” Toni smiles at Howard, gripping his hands like a vice before standing and kissing his hairline.
“That I am, Lenny, that I am. I’m a repairman, so I need to be able to bend and move easily,” Toni explains, looking back to Blanche and Ernest, waiting for their reactions. Men have a hard time swallowing her way of living, but women provide just as much judgement a lot of the times, society molding them to look down on those who rebel against the norm.
“A woman?” The blonde man at the door scoffs when Toni introduces herself. “Ernest didn’t say you were a woman.”
The Depression hit America soon after Toni’s 10th birthday, hitting the Starks just as hard as it hit the rest of the country. Money had never been particularly abundant for the family, but Toni simply never realized just how bad it could get.
“How long had they been sick?” Howard asks Toni quietly, huddled together under a pile of blankets on their parents’ bed.
Toni’s mama’s sewing business also drastically suffered. Folks would rather go with torn clothes than spend money on a non-essential. Toni’s mom also took discounted prices, but eventually began to offer free lessons in mending clothing so the families could keep as warm as possible while only occasionally buying a new spool of thread or needle.
“Life can throw a lot at you. You might not be prepared for all of it, but one thing will always ring true: Starks are made of iron.”
“You know, honey,” Mrs. Stevenson bends until she’s seated next to Toni on the floor, “that’s some really advanced material you’re reading. Do you understand it all?” she asks, tilting her head to the side and studying Toni.
“Oh, it’s fine ma’am, please don’t worry about it. It was my fault, I should have been looking where I was walking.” Slender hands with long, graceful fingers grab her hands to take them off his chest, and Toni’s eyes shoot up to meet the bluest eyes she had ever seen.
Toni looks away, eyes wandering until they fix onto the vase of flowers in the corner of the tan room. She studies the healthy flush of the petunias and sturdy ribs of the vase. They were an impulse purchase on the way home from work two days earlier. The last time she had fought a customer. Something about the flowers had called to her, and she had needed something bright and cheery in her apartment, as Lenny couldn’t exactly be a permanent fixture.
Before Smith can unleash a punch, a new set of hands dig into each of Smith’s shoulders and rips him off of Toni, sending him sprawling a few feet away, breath knocked from him at the force with which he landed.
“Wait- Howie,” her voice is hoarse, but she pushes through, “I need you to know- they knew. They knew how much you loved and appreciated them. Every letter you sent home, every update you gave was met with smiles and pride. They
“And you’re smarter than anyone I’ve ever met, Annie. Dropping out of school won’t get you anywhere, either! But Mother and Father… they’re working too hard. It’s just not healthy,” Howard concludes, shaking his head, and wrapping his hands tightly together, the knuckles turning white from the force.
Toni shrugs. “Times are rough on the good folk. Nobody should have to go without the basics in life. I taught myself how to fix any machine under the sun so I could try to help as much as I can. Plus, I’m a woman. Folks are more likely to utilize my services if it doesn’t cost a pretty penny,” Toni shrugs once more, aware of the realities of the world she lives in.
Toni eyes the man and then Mary Ellen, eyebrows up with a shit eating grin stretched over her face. Toni loves watching Mary Ellen when she’s on the prowl. It’s one of the most fascinating scenes Toni can ever watch, but then she remembers Lenny, who has already enthusiastically sat down as close to Mary Ellen as she can. So… right next to big, strong, and brunette.
Her father has sold fruit for as long as Toni can remember, and he continued to do so in the face of the depression. Sales, however, tanked drastically. No one could afford fresh fruit anymore, so as not to waste perfectly edible fruit, he often gave it away for extremely discounted prices or even for free to the needier families before it could spoil.
“I’m very good with machines. Have been since I was a kid, like you. Anything that interests you, Lenny?” Toni doesn’t like to outright admit she’s a genius if she can help it. Nobody likes a peacock. Especially if it’s female.
“I don’t have any friends, mama. No one wants to be friends with the freak genius girl who wins fights and wears pants. I’ve no need for school anymore. They can’t teach me anything new and I’m miserable every day I’m there,” Toni admits, dropping her gaze to her hands, folded in her lap.
Toni takes a deep breath. “I’m going to drop out of school to help mama and papa support the family.”
Toni pockets the money without taking her eyes off of him. She slowing crouches to grab her toolbox then backs out of his apartment, eyes on him and wrench raised the entire way to his door. When she pulls it shut after she exits, she sprints down the hallway and stairs, not stopping until she’s burst onto the busy Brooklyn street, gulping lungfuls of city air. She gets a few weird looks, but Toni ignores them, walking briskly until she’s a block away and collapsing on a bench, taking a moment to collect herself.
The man she’s now staring at is turning red under his soft looking blonde hair, eyes flitting awkwardly to his feet as he bites his lower lip. His slender shoulders and skinny arms are covered in a tan jacket that accentuates his lithe form, his head stopping just below Toni’s eye level.
“We made sandwiches for lunch! Is tuna alright?” Blanche flits over to the kitchen where four sandwiches were waiting on plates.
Toni returns the handshake with a firm pressure, affection for these strangers swelling in her chest.
“I know you are, Annie. There’s no one I know more capable of protecting themselves than you, but damn if that doesn’t stop me from losing sleep over the thought of you here, by yourself, surrounded by men who want to hurt you,” he admits, curling tighter into their embrace.
“A lot of people don’t know how to handle a powerful girl, Toni. You thirst for knowledge and absorb it quicker than most. I’ve seen you in here, most days, for the past two years. The titles you put under your belt get more and more advanced every time I see you. Don’t hide from your intelligence, child. Don’t be ashamed of it or wary of it. It is a gift not to be taken lightly. Others might not see it that way. But your opinion is the only opinion that matters when it comes to this, Toni. Listen not to what the others have to say.” Mrs. Stevenson stands, smiling down at the still gaping Toni.
A few more perverts tried to take advantage of her in the next year, but word spread pretty quickly that she could and would beat you bloody if you tried anything with her.
“You’re special, Darling. Smart in a way they’ve never seen. Kids get jealous very easily and can lash out in anger when they don’t understand what they’re feeling,” Papa explains to Toni, tone patient but eyes sad.
He left feeling no better about her work situation, but knowing that there was naught either of them could really do. She had taken him around the city, introducing him to the people who meant the most to her in terms of friendship.
Toni looks back at the counter to see Lenny bent over at the waist trying to keep her laughs in. Mary Ellen, however, is darting her eyes between Toni and Baby Blues, a slow smile growing. She turns hopeful eyes on Toni, flicking them back to the man, a question in her eyes.
They let silence fall for a while. It’s better than the silence that’s been permeating the air ever since Mama and Papa died- much lighter, like maybe things won’t be so bad.
“Okay. I think I already know the issue. I’ll have it fixed in a jiffy,” Toni gets to work immediately, crouching down and keeping track of the hovering presence behind her with ease after years of practice.
“Thank you for being mature about this… Annie, when you’re making your plan, please don’t take our family’s finances into account.” Her mother requests, a pained look clawing onto her face.
Or the conflict of the story can be purely external? I JUST WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY. IS MAKING THEIR RELATIONSHIP SUPER EASY BAD WRITING?
Toni doesn’t know how to say goodbye to these people. Sure, she hasn’t been particularly fond of them since her parents died, but these are still the people who she’d serviced for over four years with dedication. At this point, a lot of them had accepted her the best anyone could. They accepted her genius and her spunk- they expected nothing less than a mean right hook if any one of them were to act slyly. They liked her. She feels almost as if she’s betraying them with her move.
Her mother looked worried with how persistent Toni is being in light of this argument. Howard had offered no protests at their denial, looking only grateful and relieved. Toni just looked desperate.
“Antoinette Alice Stark,” A voice calls from the darkness beyond her closed eyes. She’s standing? Oh, she’s an adult again. Thank fuck.
It takes three trips to bring all of Toni’s stuff up. The apartment came partially furnished, a bolted down double bed and navy blue loveseat installed with great pride from Mr. Davis. Toni only brought her clothes, books, and basic living supplies with her, donating everything else to the homeless shelters of Richford.
He made one pass at her and Toni sent him a sharp look and continued questioning him about his heater. He set his hand much too low on her back and she snapped, grabbing his arm and twisting it away from her person, maneuvering herself to kick him in the balls as hard as she could.
Howard was waiting outside Toni’s classroom after school so they could walk home without Toni being caught by another jealous classmate. The walk is silent until about halfway home, Howard stops walking and turns to Toni.
“Yes! Mama finished a poem yesterday, and her and Papa are gonna perform for us!” she gasps, hauling Howard to his feet and dragging him to the tiny living room where they fall onto the couch and wait for their parents to put on their show.
“No! Go for the child, not me!” Lenny laughs and joins in, so now both Mary Ellen and Lenny are smacking at Toni.
Mary Ellen Johnson is an incredibly kind woman. She’s only one year older than Toni, and she has to be the sunniest, most lovable girl Toni had ever met. Her and her parents, Ray and Lucy, are some of the wealthier people in Brooklyn. They always insist on paying Toni in full for her services, and they donate often to the homeless shelters. Toni likes them all quite a bit, so when she hears them arguing, she can’t help but listen in from her spot shoulders deep in their icebox.
“It’s been a year today,” Howard’s voice pulls Toni from her memories. She looks up to find the same wetness from her face trapped in his eyes. She sets the precious gift back into his bag and stands, pulling him into a tight hug.
“Yes, Mrs. Stevenson, everything is dandy. I was just reading this physics book. Real interesting stuff,” Toni sniffs, tilting her head down and into the book.
“But in your dreams, whatever they may be, dream a little dream of me,” Toni answers, smile wide enough the split her freckled cheeks right in half.
She stops by her post office box on the way home to see if any new appointments have been submitted when she sees a letter from Howard. Smiling, she resists the urge to tear into it then and there, withholding only because there might be sensitive data within. Howard had contacted her a couple months ago with the amazing news that he’s done it.
Toni returns the hug as tightly as their awkward position can allow. “I know that you’re worried, Howie, but I’m sending my message. I don’t start the fights, but I end them. People are starting to gather that. Besides,” Toni adds, shrugging around their embrace, “I think I’m getting near the end of the line of pervs. It’s slowed down significantly in that area since I sent you that letter.”
Toni and Howard sat, entranced by the songs as per usual. It wasn’t often that their parents performed for them, but when it happened, it was always this off mixture of silliness from their parents and true, heartwarming love delivered in beautiful tones.
“Give me some time, Howie, I’m making them better than you ever could!” she calls back, smirk even bigger than his, knowing that he’d see it for the joke she meant it to be.
“Oh, yeah, it was a really common issue. Should be good as new!” She finishes up putting her tools away and straightens up, smiling at her neighbors.
“How many people will want to hire a girl, Anne?” His voice isn’t condescending or mean, simply searching.
“Let me show you to the heater, Toni,” Ernest stands, leading a bit into the room and to a small closet door in the back right of the apartment.
“Okay, folks, here goes. As you all know, I’m very interested in physics and engineering. I, much like Howie, quite enjoy experimenting and inventing. I also, however, quite enjoy repairing broken objects. It’s cathartic, in a way, to fix what’s been ruined. I know that you guys said to not worry about finances, and I want you to know that this isn’t what that is,” Toni breathes in deeply and relaxes her shoulders, lost as to when they had tensed up.
Walter and Alice Stark are overwhelmed by a fever in late January of 1937 and die in their sleep. The community grieves them, and Howard comes back to Richford for a week to help plan the funeral with Toni.
“No. I’ve enjoyed a few lookers, but nothing with intent,” Howard shrugs, not looking particularly bothered.
“I understand, Mr. Davis, truly,” Toni’s smile is sharp, bordering on a snarl, as she snatches the keys from his sausage fingers quicker than he could blink.
Her door is a few inches above her 5’7” and peeling yellowed paint. There are children’s height measurements lining both sides of the doorjamb which Toni refuses to ever paint over. The door opens to reveal two adults a few years younger than her parents and a young child, all dressed in their Sunday clothes.
“You and Papa are working so hard and doing so much for the community, mama. You’re making a real, genuine difference for all the people you help. Howard is experimenting more and more, making strides in engineering as a 15 year old. All I’m doing is going to school, learning nothing because I already know everything, then winning fights with chin wagging bullies who are starting to see me as a choice bit of calico rather than a goddamn person who can and
“Yes, young one, you are in a different universe. The soul cannot exist more than once in any particular universe.”
“Yeah, he wasn’t very nice, but did you see his chest? Or those thighs? He coulda made an honest woman outta you, Toni.” For such a bright and happy person, she can get surprisingly dirty when she wants to.
“You’re doing a marvelous job, Annie,” Alice soothes Toni, smoothing her dark brown curls back and pressing a kiss to her forehead.
“You’re a genius, Annie. It doesn’t come as a surprise that school isn’t enough for you. Not wanting to attend college is a bit of a surprise, what with how much you’ve always loved to learn, but that’s not our decision to make. You’re suffering at your school, more than we knew, and we’re not going to force you to stay in school if it isn’t conducive to your health.
“You should have told me you were going to visit! I would have bought a second bed,” Toni laughs, nuzzling into his embrace further.
Without too much thought, Toni knows that she is somehow meeting personifications of the infinity stones.
“You, young one, exist as either Antoinette or Antonia Stark in the universes of which you are apart. Never as both- only one can exist per universe.”
“So… you keep saying home universe. Since I didn’t have an Aunt Antoinette, I’m guessing I’m not going to be living through the same events this time around. I have my dad, but… will I have anyone else from my life? My wife? My kids? My friends?” Toni’s anger boils hotter, thinking further into her current situation.
“I have a prototype ready for the new body armor,” he tells Ms. Potts. “If Agent Smith is here, I can show both of you before we go? Get his input for SHIELD, and you can check the military contract for specifics.”
“No, Tony,” Steve cuts him off, isn’t sure if Tony’s genuinely confused or deflecting, but either way, Steve wants a straight answer from him. “Wrong with you. Right now,” he clarifies before Tony can launch into a laundry list of his own defects, or come up with some sort of witty “I’m perfect and this is why” barb. “What is bothering you right now?”
Steve opens his mouth – to, what, thank her? He has no idea – and shuts it again when he realizes she’s not finished.
“We’ll have SHIELD teams do more thorough sweeps of the trains and the tunnels,” Coulson puts in. “If the rats are actually gone, your team is clear, Cap. I’ll let you know when we’re done here, and we can debrief at HQ.”
“The last of the civilians are in that car,” Coulson announces, ignoring the chatter. “We should have them out in a couple more minutes.”
“She was,” Steve’s smile is a little wistful. “She was a nurse. Used to bossing people around for their own good. Wouldn’t take no for an answer. If she wanted something, she got it done. She used to catch me sketching when I was little. Stubs of pencils and corners of old newspapers, whatever I could get my hands on. I never would have gone to college if she hadn’t decided I was going to do it. She said one of us should do something fun with life, and she spent all her time on the wards.”
“I’m not ignoring you. Would I have answered the phone if I was ignoring you?” Tony feels this is a fair point.
. And if Steve says this is what they’re doing, then he’s not going to go off and do anything with anyone else, with or without an NDA, and feeling jealous and guilty about it every time he wonders where Steve is, and who he is with, and what they’re doing has been killing him.
“He’ll probably say I was slacking, I don’t know, but it worked.” Tony feels that’s what Pepper should be taking away from this, and Steve had been thrilled not to have to sit through another meal with Tony – had vanished into his room as soon as they had gotten home and hadn’t come out again for the rest of the evening – so he shouldn’t have any complaints, either.
Not that he’s uncomfortable. Just. Waiting. Aware of the sidelong looks he’s getting, though he can’t quite parse why. At least when Tony’s around, he knows people are looking because it’s ‘Tony Stark and an Avenger’– not because he’s underdressed. Though maybe people will be watching them for other reasons now, and that’s the kicker. Steve hasn’t seen Tony since they got back to the Tower the night before, they’d grabbed takeout on the way, but hadn’t eaten together. Steve had gone to his room and Tony had gone, well, wherever it was Tony went to. His workshop, maybe. Steve hadn’t asked, had just been a little relieved to be able to hole up in his own space and draw, get out of his head for a bit.
. He’s been reminding himself every time he starts to relax that this thing between them isn’t real, that they couldn’t see eye to eye on anything, could barely even be in the same room together before they were forced into it, that just because Steve doesn’t completely tense up at the sight of him anymore doesn’t mean he wouldn’t leap at the chance to be spending time with anyone else if he could. And here’s this guy asking if they’re planning on
, and knows she means it. “Just because we weren’t right together doesn’t mean that I don’t still love you, or that you won’t find something that works with someone else.”
Someone makes overdramatic gagging noises. Steve’s instinct is to suspect Tony, but it sounds more like Natasha.
“They are preparing for departure,” Jarvis tells him. “They should all be assembled in the hangar within five minutes. Dr. Banner is already boarding the quinjet.”
“You have been in love with this guy since before I knew you,” Rhodey snaps, then draws in a sharp breath that Tony can hear even halfway across the room. “Tony, listen to me,” his voice has gone abruptly very gentle.
“Of course, Ms. Potts,” Coulson’s tone matches Pepper’s. “I will inform Agent Barton.” Coulson pauses, then adds, “Though he is likely to hear it from Agent Romanoff as soon as she is made aware.”
“I shouldn’t be here,” he says after a long moment, quiet like it’s a confession. “I shouldn’t – this isn’t where I belong. Nothing’s right here. But it wasn’t. I saw. The dream, I guess. And it wasn’t right, there, either.” He glances up, gaze skittering over Tony’s face and then away again. “We fought a war.
Tony is still trying to process. He has no idea what’s about to come out of Steve’s mouth, but he’s sure it can’t be good.
A corner of Ms. Potts’s mouth ticks up. “Yes, Captain. I have these for you and Tony to sign.” She passes him a folder of papers. “He should be here in a minute, and Natasha said she would find either Agent Barton or Dr. Banner to be a witness.”
“No, but it seemed more tactful than directly quoting that you would ‘bang him like a screen door in a hurricane.’” Jarvis’s voice is prim.
“Fury still won’t clear him for overseas ops,” Steve shakes his head as Tony’s frown deepens. “I don’t think he’s in as great shape as he’s pretending.”
He shrugs like it doesn’t matter, like he hasn’t been hoping and bracing for this since before he knew if Steve had made it through the Snap. “Pull up a couch.”
“No, I –” Steve shakes his head, but not as a denial. “I’d like that, Tony,” he says. He knows how private Tony can be about his workshop, but the way Tony’s shoulders drop just the tiniest bit is proof enough that was the right thing to say. “Let’s go talk in your workshop.”
Tony rolls his eyes, though he knows Steve won’t see it, picks up a different screwdriver to adjust one of the gauntlet’s fingers. “They’d pick up a story on Tony Stark cheating,” he says. He doesn’t add that there’s a good chance there will be stories even if he hasn’t done anything. He’s surprised there haven’t been any before this.
, and that. That’s maybe not what I need to be taking from this, but right now? Right now, it’s something I never thought I’d have.”
“There’s nothing to know, J,” Tony snaps, then takes a deep breath. It’s not Jarvis’s fault Tony’s infatuated and doesn’t filter himself when he’s not in public. “It’s a crush. I’ll get over it. He doesn’t know, and he’s not
“He had a lot of information before he ever met me,” Tony says darkly. Not that he’s still bothered by that.
Tony isn’t sure how to answer that, stares at the cufflinks in his hand, tries to focus on his breathing.
The rats aren’t clever, but they’re aggressive, and hard to take down. And they keep coming, swarming out of the tunnels. Tony knows they have to be coming from somewhere – they’re certainly not just coming out of the walls like regular rats – but they’ve got him and the gang pretty well pinned down, and he’s afraid to use anything more effective than the repulsors with civilians still trapped in the subway cars around them. At least the platforms have already cleared out, and the rats haven’t made it into any of the cars yet. Or made any move to get above ground.
Pepper purses her lips, and Tony isn’t entirely sure whether it’s out of annoyance over his general existence and inability to do anything other than make life difficult for her, or if she’s trying not to laugh. She’s tricky like that. “Rhodey said he’d send in some initial reports on the body armor tomorrow,” she says after a moment, clearly deciding to just carry on with her to-do list. “Phil said he was on-call for the weekend, so he can come by in the afternoon with updates from SHIELD, if there are any changes since last week. I’d like you to be there in case anything needs further adjusting. The military should have final notes within another week, or so – Rhodey said they’d want to get these going as soon as possible, so they’ll make it a priority. If all goes well, we should present to the board on Monday.”
By the time Steve reaches his apartment, there are already half a dozen agents waiting outside, sitting on the stoop and chatting. Steve is never sure if this sort of thing is generally how SHIELD operates, or if it’s just down to Coulson’s special brand of efficiency.
Noise is coming in a low rumble from the direction of the living room when Tony gets home late one night after a two-day conference in Hong Kong. He’s worn out from the conference and the flight, but not sleepy, exactly, and while he was hoping to just faceplant in his pillows, he’s not sure how effective that would be. It sounds like John Williams and fighter jets, and further investigation proves that Return of the Jedi is playing in the darkened living room, his four teammates clustered around the big TV.
“Aren’t you used to the press?” there’s a hint of a confused frown in Ms. Potts’s voice, but Steve can’t quite see her face from this angle, and he doesn’t want to look away from Tony, doesn’t want to break that focus that keeps the flashes and yelling faces firmly in his peripheral vision.
Steve can feel his neck getting warm. “I just thought. Well. Engaged couples fight all the time, right? About wedding plans and. And other things. And if we’re getting married, clearly I have nothing against same-sex marriage. And it might help encourage more states to legalize it, even, if we were to set the example. This morning, in Illinois, they were having parades, and I was thinking it would be nice if there was something I could do to help that along in other places, so if we –” Steve realizes he’s rambling, cuts himself off, and looks down at his hands for a moment, before looking back up at the faces still turned to his. “It would prove there are no problems among the Avengers, and it might help a good cause,” he says, more succinctly, finally lets go of the table, and folds his hands neatly in his lap.
Steve watches him for a minute, pretty sure he just got the shovel talk from his fake husband’s best friend, and unsure whether he should be laughing or concerned.
“Right,” Steve pointedly doesn’t roll his eyes. He gets the feeling, sometimes, that Coulson knows when he does, even if he can’t see him. “Is that everything?”
Steve opens his mouth, ready to tell Tony he’ll thank him when he’s done something to be thanked for, not when he could have let untold numbers of giant, raging birds loose on New York because he had to come showboat all over the place when Steve was
Steve huffs out a breath, and Tony hears his footsteps come a little closer. “That’s ridiculous,” he says. “You’re the same person.”
“Not this,” Steve waves his hand around again. “Everything else. You and Bruce. You’ve been keeping all kinds of secrets, and they’ve turned out to be a hell of a lot more dangerous than Clint’s. What else do you have going on?”
“No,” Tony admits, and thankfully doesn’t have to elaborate as the server returns to take their orders.
After too many pictures and too many questions, with no way to politely excuse themselves, Tony’s inclined to agree with Howard, much as it pains him. He thinks,
. But Steve’s watching him back, and Tony isn’t sure why, determinedly doesn’t reach up to touch the arc reactor again, keeps his hands safely tucked away.
Maybe that’s why the sight of Steve flirting with a woman Tony doesn’t know over by the bar doesn’t feel so much like a slap in the face as a slow sinking in the pit of his stomach. Like he was waiting for this. The focus on them has been steadily shifting away to other, newer things in the past few weeks, and while they still regularly get mobbed by reporters or have pictures of them out and about show up on all the gossip sites, society itself is less interested. Tony was hoping that might mean attending fewer fancy events, but Steve, who so clearly was uncomfortable with all the attention, seems to be enjoying himself now that he’s just one of the crowd.
“Let’s move,” Ms. Potts suggests, though it sounds more like an order. She suits action to words, and steps smartly around the pair of them, walking purposefully up the carpet towards the entrance.
Mr. Cooper gives Tony what might be a commiserating sort of look, but somehow makes Steve’s jaw go tight again. “Let’s start out easy, then,” Mr. Cooper suggests, and Steve tries to relax.
“Tony,” Steve looks startled, and Tony almost asks if he was expecting someone else, but manages to bite back on the impulse at the last minute. He can do this. And the way Steve’s eyes sweep him from head to toe and back is both unexpected and strangely gratifying. “You look,” his eyes sweep up and down again, and he swallows. “You look good,” he says eventually, and even though there’s a stranger in the room, Tony’s pretty sure it’s not for her benefit.
For what feels like a long time, neither of them speaks. Tony doesn’t know what to say. If he did, he wouldn’t have avoided the two of them being alone together this long. Sorry doesn’t cut it, and he’s not sure he is, anyway. But it wasn’t worth it.
“Have you eaten or slept at all?” Pepper asks, her tone indicating she knows the answer already, but feels compelled to at least try.
By the time Steve comes back and crawls into the bed, tugging the sheets up over both of them, Tony’s mostly out. “You’re warm,” he mutters, curls into Steve’s chest, feels the arm Steve drapes around him.
Tony looks up from the glass of Scotch he’s been holding long enough the ice has melted. He’s not sure when he lost track of everyone. He’s pretty sure Bruce and the new woman, Carol, had been sitting next to him on the couch, talking, only moments before, but now Carol’s across the room, deep in conversation with Rhodey, and Bruce is nowhere to be seen. It’s just Steve, hovering in front of him. Cap. Rogers. Tony’s not sure enough of where they stand to know what to call him.
All of the ways this will probably implode are still circling around his brain, but, for just this moment, Tony tells them to shut up. Maybe this wasn’t something either of them wanted, and maybe Steve would rather punch Tony in the face instead of kissing him, but, for now, they’re stuck with each other, and maybe,
. He goes over the article praising Illinois for legalizing same-sex marriage twice, feels that odd mixture of proud and sad that he’s become so used to since he woke up. It’s so hard to wrap his head around the idea that not only is homosexuality no longer illegal, but men can marry other men, women can marry other women. Except not everywhere, and that hits him in the chest harder than anything. He doesn’t quite understand how it can be accepted and not accepted at the same time. It just doesn’t make sense. The pictures in the paper of Chicago, though, he can’t help but smile at them, couples kissing in the streets, crowds waving rainbow flags. Baby steps, he thinks, baby steps.
Tony snorts. “I don’t doubt you’ll survive it, I was more concerned with the manner of your survival.”
pick out a wedding venue, so I get a roommate tonight and a ball-and-chain next weekend. Don’t be jealous, you’re still my favorite.”
There are a couple tricky moments Tony would rather have done without, but they could have been worse. One when Natasha shouts a warning, and Tony only just gets to Barton in time to prevent him from getting eaten from behind – and who knew alligators could stand on their hind legs, that’s absolutely horrifying. Another when Steve’s down in the muck, shield knocked out of reach by a scaly tail, and there’s a ‘gator baring down on him, jaws wide, and Tony barely makes it before the thing’s teeth close on him. He gets his own arm in there, and the armor dents under the pressure, but holds, which is more than Tony can say for what Steve’s scale mail would have done. Tony gets knocked ass over teakettle for his trouble, but the distraction gives Steve enough time to regain both his feet and his shield and get back into it, so Tony figures it’s a job well done, even if there is an Iron Man-length crack in the wall he hit.
