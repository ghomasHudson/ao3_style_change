“JARVIS, call the others back in. You three keep your cards face-down,” Natasha sighed, taking out her own phone, “After they give their answers, you show your respective cards.”
“He wants you to prove it,” Thor said, glaring back at the Prime, “You do not have to, Tony. You are still a guest of mine if you choose to keep your privacy.”
Tony hummed at that, looking down at the child’s soft features.
After much coaxing, he finally got PJ to his feet and helped him into the room. Shushing him softly, Tony held his hand out again, watching as the boy shakily rested his palm on top of Tony’s.
“Thanks, Doc,” he hummed, thankful that Bruce let it drop, “So. How does he look?”
A four-poster bed with sheer curtains was pushed against the far wall, large enough to hold at least three full-grown men. It was dressed in blue linens, draped with various exotic furs from animals that he was sure the Prime had killed himself. A drafting desk sat on the opposite wall, covered in parchment and books, clearly left as though the man was in the middle of a draft when he had been called to the throne room. It looked intimidating, but the Prime only smiled at him, sweeping his hand toward a wooden door on the other side of the room. He jogged over to open it for Tony, ushering him and Peter into a large bathroom.
“I can’t help it! I’ve never, this isn’t
He managed to get to the closet to dress for the day, opting for loose clothes on his sore body. The stupid nursing garment stared at him from one of the drawers, but since Steve was asleep Tony stuck his tongue out at it and left it where it was. With one last glance over at the Warlord--
When Sarah was silent, Tony picked his head up, trying to quell his swimming vision by squinting. He squeezed Sarah’s hand, panic swelling in his chest when she didn’t answer.
“I think both are viable options,” Natasha said, “But Tony, you need to recover. None of us are going to let you back into the field in your current condition, and since you are PJ’s main caretaker, he goes where you go.”
“We’ll need to get matching family pajamas, then.”
Tony looked up at him and nodded his go-ahead.
“Ain’t that the truth,” Clint muttered, only to yelp when Bucky smacked his arm.
“Where’s Peter?’ He demanded, getting to his feet to stomp over to the door, pain be damned, “Where’s the kid? If you’ve hurt him, I swear to
Clint had the decency to look mildly ashamed and he turned his eyes away, clearly caught. Tony turned back to Thor, who smiled.
nurturing seems to have kept the subject alive and calm. Which, for me, is optimal for completing my tests.”
“Can we talk? About this?” Steve asked.
“He’s a good kid,” Steve murmured, causing Tony to stand up and give him a surprised look, “He’ll need time, but I think he’ll be okay.”
, I’ve got you,” he soothed, his heart aching at how positively upset the boy was, “Look, Papa and Uncle Clint already changed your sheets, and now Papa’s gonna come with us for some warm cuddles. Cuddles are really, really manly, you know. They also can solve any problem
“Finish up your bath so I can bandage your cut, okay? I want to check on Peter for a quick moment.”
The figure’s head snapped up, and upon seeing the familiar brown and blue eyes looking back at him, Tony nearly broke down into tears, lifting up his arms. The child dragged himself over and collapsed into Tony’s hold, sobbing deeply into his bruised shoulder.
“It is how I feel these days. It is a good practice in learning patience.”
. I don’t know what Zola did to him while I was passed out, so we’re taking him to medical to get checked out. That’s the responsible thing to do, and you know it, so drop it,” he eventually snapped, looking into the rearview mirror to make eye contact with the Captain.
PJ giggled more, nodding as he bounced on Tony’s lap. He couldn’t help but smile down at the child, tucking a stray curl behind the boy’s ear. If he could keep that smile, that laugh, that
Tony felt the dizzy spell coming on and quickly put Peter back down, barely managing to get the infant settled when it hit him full force and he collapsed onto his bed, groaning as black spots fuzzed his vision. He heard a rustling and loud thumps, then felt someone touching him, gently shaking his arm.
The boy Bucky had been playing with earlier looked up from trying to fit barbie clothes onto his triceratops, quickly getting to his feet and running over.
“…Did he just get jealous?” Tony asked, looking between the boy and Pepper, “I did just see that, right?”
“Fine. But I’m telling Bucky about it,” Steve decided, grinning as he pressed a kiss to Tony’s hairline, “You guys can bond over it. He loves that stuff.”
“PJ?”
“I know it is awful. But I have to go next before we can get out, and you cannot be on your own. I know you, mister, and the first thing you will do out there is take your wet little self over and wake up your father,” Tony said as he hurriedly scrubbed himself down, “He likes being woken up by you, but not when you are drenched and naked.”
“Do you have a medical kit in here? I need to clean this,” Tony said, probing around the wound despite Steve’s grunts, “What happened to you? To your braid?”
“The chair stops part way. It won’t move down anymore,” Tony explained, stuffing down the desire to scoop the boy up and show him the world he missed out on, “See? You’re safe, pumpkin pie. I won’t let you fall.”
“Well, let’s get him out of here, then,” He groused, “He seems to be suspended in what I
“You should probably get the other two before they knock the door down,” Tony reminded him, earning a big pout from Steve, “What? You know I’m right. Well, okay, they can enter on their own time, I guess—”
“Yeah! It’s always been like that. Steve gives zero shits about what people think and Tony looks at him like he plucked the moon out of the sky and gave it to him. Y’know, I told him that once, and he told me that wasn’t possible because it would cause a gravitational shift or something-or-another. Steve just told him it was a nice thought, then proceeded to
“Seriously, man!  Get down from there! You’ll get hurt,” Bucky called up.
The once blinding fluorescence of the overhead lights seemed like a distant comfort now that the inky blackness of the room began to seep into his bones. He tried to cry out for help, but the mask over his face and liquid in his lungs kept the noise firm in his throat. Frightened, he tried to move, but quickly realized he could not feel his body, save for flicking his eyes back and forth in terror; he struggled until exhaustion crept through the few muscles he could move, causing him to sink into the complete darkness.
“I will be, partially,” he said confidently, a whisper of a smirk on his lips, “After we get married, that is.”
“Rhodey,” he croaked, feeling his stomach roll, “Peter--”
“Sam is right. We need to get both men back to normal,” Thor murmured, scratching his beard in thought, “How are we supposed to break a feral state?”
Once Steve spoke, PJ looked up at him, eyes widening slightly. A bit curious, he took a step toward Steve, only to look back at Tony nervously. Silently, Tony stood with his palm out, letting PJ touch him ever so slightly. He walked the boy over to Steve, feeling his own heart thump faster as they got closer. Once they were close enough, Steve finally looked down at PJ, a harsh breath escaping his lips as a strange look overtook his face.
“Not yet.”
He squeezed Tony’s hand again and headed to his locker, so Tony bottled up his concern and did the same. After putting his costume up and shouldering his backpack, Tony fondly stroked a finger over the robot drawing on his inner locker door; it was a little crinkled after having it for so many years, but Steve had given it to him, so he kept it. He looked around to make sure no one was close before pressing a small kiss to the paper and closing the locker door. Quickly, Tony headed out front, finding his friends chattering in a small group.

“How bad is it?” She asked, peeling off a strip of cheese from her cheese stick and popping it into her mouth.

“No, they’re definitely HYDRA,” the archer replied, barely looking as he used his arrows as melee weapons, “I meant, are we sure this is just an outpost? Most outposts only have twenty-some foot soldiers. Never this much artillery—”
“I thought he was never going to go back to sleep,” Steve admitted quietly, an odd expression on his face as he glanced between Tony and the babe, “You’re good with him. It’s incredible.”
“Again! Again!” He giggled, “
“I’ve been out for a week?” he said quietly, not at all surprised at Natasha’s actions.
“We do have things to do this morning, my love,” Steve murmured into his ear, “As much as I want to stay here wrapped around you, we promised the others we would get up for group training today.”
touch you again—”
“Good morning!”
“I never was good with kids. Even during touring with the USO,” He replied, a distant look glazing over his eyes, “Holding babies got awkward and tiring. They screamed a lot, and with the enhanced hearing and all…”
He stood on creaky knees, ignoring the various stunned and amused looks he was receiving from the team. With a gentle touch on the shoulder from Nat, he headed off toward the guest room, toward the increasing sounds of swing music. Poking his head into the room, Tony couldn’t help the small gasp that escaped his lungs; the room had been cleared of regular furniture, and there was Steve, wiping sweat from his brow as he looked down at a finished small bedframe up against the wall. Hearing the gasp, Steve swiveled toward the door, causing Tony to reflexively shrink back.
“Exactly!... Exactly,” Steve said, much quieter the second time, “We…we were okay. But we weren’t us.”
“No, we are not tying him to Bruce,” Bruce grumbled.
“Talking to Steve in the morning would be good,” she said, “You guys need a bit to think before you hash out whatever relationship you guys want to have. And you’ll need to do it without the kid. I’ll take him for the shift after breakfast.”
“Make the water colder,” he found himself saying, accidentally startling the man.
Gently, he moved Tony off of him and got up, pressing the heel of his hand against his forehead to stave off an oncoming headache. Tony watched him slowly move around to dress in more traditional clothes, only to growl in annoyance when Steve turned to go. The Alpha froze, sending a wide-eyed look over his shoulder at his Omega.
“Tony, love. You aren’t, and you never will be. You are so much more than he ever was,” Steve murmured, pointedly moving up to sit on the bed, resting a hand on Tony’s knee, “You couldn’t ever be like him, even if you
“She isn’t coming, Tony,” Sarah said, holding Tony’s hand a little tighter, “She’s sending Edwin to pick you up.”
“Yeah, you.”
“Foreskin, thanks Tones, he didn’t get the foreskin cut off or whatever, so it’s hard to tell.”
“Alright. We’ll take Thor and Steve, then.”
“Okay,” the Captain said as he stood, adjusting his shirt, “Fine. But we have no idea how to get back to the Tower, and I’m the only one who can fight. Any more smart ideas?”
“Haven’t gotten to that part yet. Just wanted to make sure I told you that I love you and am proud of you for being true to yourself.”
“No,” Tony mumbled from Steve’s chest, smiling when he laughed deeply, “Okay, maybe a little. I’m ready to go home, for sure.”
He turned his head and hacked loudly, wheezing and gasping for breath between coughs. A hand settled between his shoulder blades, providing a stable point to concentrate on while he sucked down air, bringing his cough down into a manageable state. The hand disappeared when he slumped back onto his pillows; he felt exhausted, but Peter continued to wail, and from the quiet words Steve was exchanging with Thor, he was not about to get any relief.
“Take me to bed,” he mumbled, wanting nothing more than a distraction to take him out of his head.
“Oh, good, my wake-up call,” Tony drawled, wincing as he helped the boy up onto the bed, “Good morning, peaches. Is it morning?”
“I should have grabbed your dolly from Bruce,” He tutted, pushing the bowl and spoon away so Peter could no longer try to grab them, “You just like causing mischief this morning, hm?”
Finally, he managed to get himself fully sheathed and he stopped, holding himself up above Tony to wait for him to be comfortable. He leaned down to gently kiss Tony's neck, hushing him when he whimpered.
He nodded and stood, having to pat Steve’s hands to get him to let go. He wedged himself in between Natasha and Clinton’s seats, hoping that neither Warlord could smell his discomfort.
“We only ever shared a bed the one time, and the only reason we did is that she went into Heat early, and if she went home, she would bond with… an unsavory individual,” Tony continued bitterly, “I could not let that happen to her. She hid out in the woods in an old cabin I managed to make comfortable, and I visited her every day to help her through the Heat. It was unbearable for her to have someone close but not be fulfilled… I knew that if it was my situation, I would have asked of her the same, so when she asked for my help, I said yes. And, as you know, Omegas are more fertile in heat. Which meant there was a large chance for pregnancy, even with preventative measures.”
“I’m fine, Tony,” Steve said gently, smiling down at his shirt as he tugged on it, “Riddled with holes, but they’re healing. Should be okay by tomorrow, I promise. Clint and Buck took the worst of the damage, as far as I know. How are you holding up? How’s the kid?”
“Finally,” Tony sighed, thunking his head back against the bed, “Hospital food is nasty, even across the pond.”
If it were not for the occasional unpleasant scrape of teeth over his sensitive chest, he could have fallen asleep with Peter attached to him. He languidly petted the babe’s hair and soaked up his warmth until the creak of the bathroom door gave him a moment of focus. Tony easily recognized Steve’s barely-concealed jealousy and beckoned him over, motioning to him to slide behind him. Now, with his bondmate spooned up against his back and his baby in his arms, he was ready to sleep the day away.
“Okay, okay, I—PJ, I need to check and see what they did to you, honey,” Tony finally admitted, swallowing his guilt as he forced himself to peel the child away from him, “Let me look you over, then we can have more warm hugs, okay?”
It was quiet in the room for a second, causing Tony to look up. Seeing the other three staring at him, he shrugged, putting his cards down.
. Suspicious, Tony moved onto the starch and picked up a cube of potato, popping it into his mouth. Confirming his theory, he watched Steve’s eyes follow his fingers into his mouth before dropping back to the plate, like a hound waiting for a scrap.
“It’s no excuse. I fucked up, I hurt you, and then you got even more hurt because I did what I thought was right for both of us without ever asking you. And I’m way past looking for forgiveness, mostly because I know I don’t deserve it. I just—I don’t want you to hurt like this, Tony. Ma’s working with the authorities, and she thinks she’s got a really good case, even if Howard brings out his best lawyers. We’ve all volunteered to testify, too. Plus, she thinks she can get Maria to help. Even—even if you don’t want me around anymore, I wanted to do
“Jesus, Tony, no. I know you can’t have that,” Steve interrupted, looking a bit horrified himself, “Besides, I wouldn’t even know where—”
Caught off-guard, Tony said, “Well, I’m not going to.”
“Good. I love Miss Sarah,” Tony purred, forcing out a giggle instead of a yelp when Steve smacked his arm, “What! I
can wait, I would always wait for you--”
“I’ll go tell Captain Rogers to meet you down here with PJ,” she said, sliding off the table with grace, “Please try to be nice, okay? Apologize, but keep it G-rated.”
“I can do it, I can do it, you just gotta stretch me, use four fingers if you have to, lick me out, I do not

“Some stuff.”
PJ glared at Bucky from where he was tucked into Tony’s side, only to turn his gaze toward Natasha. He smiled bashfully, putting his face back into Tony’s side when she waved at him.
When they began the lessons, Tony had to admit he was a little bit more than confused; not only was the vocalization of the Northern language completely different from the South, but the shapes of the words on parchment were strange and blocky, as compared to the South’s soft cursive script. It was a challenge to tackle, but he eventually found his footing, and from there he sped through grammar lessons. He learned most easily through immersion, so he and Bruce often frequented the markets speaking only in the Northern language unless he wanted to ask for the translation of a word he did not know. His mind soaked up the information, and after almost two weeks of engrossing himself in language books and literature, Tony was nearly fluent and able to hold complex conversations. He thanked his perfect memory and genius intellect for carrying the heft of the work, but he knew it was all going to be worth it when Steve came back home and they could
“I heard that,” Clint yelled from somewhere in the safehouse.
The elevator halted and started moving upwards again, only to stop and open at the communal kitchen. Moping, Steve trudged to the freezer, ignoring the way his heart sank when he pulled out a tub of Butter Pecan. He grabbed a spoon and headed for the couch, curling up on the end with his head perched on the arm. Sighing, Steve tucked into the ice cream, about to call it all moot when the couch dipped and a heavy body was soon sprawled over his own.
“You are in too dense of jungle for the flight system to operate on autopilot, and I would not recommend manual mode with the child onboard. I can, however, direct you toward a more open area.”
“Yeah, yeah. I’ll help,” Bruce conceded, rolling his eyes as he pulled open a drawer to gather some sterilized equipment, “But you need to help me, first. I’m not getting this kid—”
Tony considered getting up to check outside the door, but a crash and a yelp quickly stifled that thought and he shut his eyes tight, laying perfectly still as it would make him disappear. A quiet whimper had him peek open an eye and he smiled, seeing that the baby had finally decided to join the fun.
The two boys wrestled around on the grass until Miss Hill came over to pull them apart, sighing as they both giggled at her. Tony smiled at the scene and held Tasha a little tighter, only to have the look wiped off of his face.
“Steve?” He asked, putting a hand on the man’s chest, “Are you alri--”
, Captain Crunch, I got us out of there safely—”
“Okay. You’ll be okay, sweetheart, I’ve got you,” Tony promised, “And if—y’know, since you have sensitive nipples anyway, if you get hard, that’s okay. I’ll take care of you after, too. Alright?”
“Foreskin.”
Once again left standing in the middle of the room with the ghost of the engineer’s hand on his shoulder, Steve watched as Tony left, then glanced down at the toy. He fiddled with the knobs for a bit to get the hang of it, then decided that maybe he could master something the great Tony Stark could not in terms of tech.
“Perhaps you should retire for the evening, yes?” Bruce said, interrupting him, “Maybe some, ah, alone time together will help. I will have Thor send for someone to bring you both supper later.”
. It was quite a change from when they first found him, and he hoped it was for the better.
“Fine. I will go and allow myself to be tortured for your amusement.”
Tony reached up himself to touch his cheek, eyes wide with surprise. Thankfully, Miss Hill called for naptime before he could respond, so he could file it away for dealing with later. He and Steve walked hand-in-hand back into the building, helping each other set up their cots before grabbing their blankets from their cubby. Secretly, Tony grabbed his fluffy rabbit from his backpack, keeping it tucked under his blanket so the other kids wouldn’t be able to see it. He wasn’t a
“I know, babycakes. Sand just isn’t your thing, huh? Me either. I can’t wait for you to see PJ, we’ve made such good pro—
wearing that. It is uncomfortable and, as you can see, I do not need it. Put it back.”
“Okay, okay. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Just—try to tuck that on the back burner for now, alright? Now, let’s get this other one done, and we’ll go from there.”
It was meant to be a joke, but Steve stood, sliding out his hand from between Tony’s hand and PJ’s back.
Tony watched Clint’s shoes go by as he ran off and he sighed, wincing when Steve rolled his hips again and huffed into his ear. He tried to lay as still as possible and shut his eyes, attempting to ignore Steve’s nibbling up his neck and on his jaw.
Rather, he stood there, looming over PJ and Tony both, to the point that Tony glared up at him and stood from the chair.
“Steve,” Tony interrupted gently, reaching over the bed to curl his hand around the Captain’s wrist, “Just ask the staff to bring a second bed. You can stay.”
“Awe, Tony, baby,” Steve sighed happily, reaching up to press the heel of his hand to his eye to try and keep the tears back, “I’m—I’m
PJ leaned back to pout up at Tony, who merely giggled.
“Well, I’m going to get him,” Tony said abruptly, ignoring the others pained looks, “You all stay—”
“Weak,” Tony whispered, “Achy. Hot. Vomit. Winter’s warmth.”
He watched as Steve rose up from the ground, eyes tracking his every movement. The Prime backed up to the wall and looked back and forth between Tony and the cell door, clearly forming a plan. Just as Tony figured out what he was doing, Steve pushed himself off the back wall with his left shoulder forward, slamming the entirety of his weight against the door. It went flying off of its hinges and crashed into the opposite wall, leaving Steve standing in the middle of the hallway with no barrier between him and Tony.
“Will it hurt him?” Tony interrupted, still focused on the scan.
“Yes,” Tony confirmed, unable to watch Pepper’s eyes widen, “He is mine. Genetically. His name is Peter James Stark. PJ for short.”
“Steeeve,” Tony whined softly, pouting up at the other from under his long eyelashes, “Trapping me here to compliment me isn’t
will not be that way with me,” Tony said, to which Bruce laughed again, “What? I have no time for bottled-up emotions and brooding. If he wants to be that kind of Alpha to me, he can do that by himself.”
By the time Steve returned with his arms laden with clothing, Tony had gingerly sat down on the bed, trying to rest his aching feet. He leaped up as soon as Steve walked in, but the man snorted and rolled his eyes, gesturing at him to sit back down. Slowly, Tony sat, watching as Steve dumped the clothes on the bed and began to rifle through them. He found what he was looking for near the bottom of the pile and held it up for Tony to judge. It was a light pink infant gown with an embroidered hem and matching undergarments; Tony could not hold in his sharp breath, eyes going wide at the gesture. He carefully reached out and took the offering from Steve, swearing that his skin tingled when he brushed up against Steve’s hand.
Which, of course, meant him, which is why he looked up at Vision when the android entered the jet and beckoned him over, motioning to his arm. Steve grit his teeth as Vision easily re-set it, breathing easier when he could flex his fingers without hurting.
Francis. Anything else can be accepted.”
After his usual morning workout, Steve always headed upstairs to his own floor to shower, even though there was a perfectly good shower room attached to the gym. Figuring that no one had noticed—or at least didn’t care to comment—he split off from the team, seeking out the new solace he had created. It was his bathroom: Stark had said he could do anything to it he wished, so with his new strength, it wasn’t too hard to wrench off the showerhead, allowing the water to flow freely. Though it wasn’t the soft, fluoride-filled stream from Brooklyn, he could at least use a washcloth for an almost sponge-bath-type-thing, and it was close enough that he wasn’t going to complain.
“Stop,” he chastised himself aloud, shaking his head as he grimaced at the floor, “None of that, Stark. This is no time for wallowing.”
“Are you going to torture him?” Tony asked, “I do
Tony was used to Alphas fighting over him, but this was a little much.
“I hope if you are there, things will go over more smoothly,” he said to the baby, dancing them around the room, “Perhaps they will be kinder if a babe is present.”
“Shh, baby. I love you so much, I’m so proud of you for being able to share this with me,” Steve barreled on, “You are the most wonderful man in the world, I can’t believe I get to wake up next to you and call you my husband—”
“It’s okay, you’re doing so well,” Tony panted, squeezing and teasing Steve’s pec to make sure he’d been milked thoroughly, “I think—I think this one’s almost done, okay? It already looks less swollen.”
,” he explained, opening the fridge to pull out the milk, “The hardest part of the whole process is to make sure you don’t burn the milk.”
“O-oh. Oh, gods, you all scared me,” Tony breathed, relaxing at Thor’s explanation, “I thought something was about to happen to me.”
Fondness turned into nausea, so Tony rolled over in his bed, juggling with conflicting emotions that did not have room for each other in his small chest. Eventually, he decided that whatever may come, he would do what was best for Peter, come hell or high water. Content that he had made a proper decision, Tony settled and fell into a dreamless slumber.
“Tony, if Steve’s DNA is also in this boy, he needs to know,” She said quietly, “But if you want to wait, fine. You have my silence. But I
“Ya tellin’ me. Stevie and I should be the only freaks runnin’ around,” Bucky snorted, “It was hard ‘nough for you guys t’take
“He took my spot.”
With great effort, they managed to peel Steve up off the floor once Tony promised to let him keep a hand on his back as they walked. Carefully, Tony lowered Peter down from his shoulder to be cradled in his arms once more, unsurprised to see that the baby was quite sleepy.
“Hey,” Steve’s voice called before the Captain’s face poked around the side of the recliner, “How is he?”
“No,” Steve growled, “I will
The silence in the room was deafening but was unable to capture the bone-deep grief that the men had to swallow.
“Come, show us what you know,” Thor finally said, turning to him with a smile, “I will translate, so do not feel pressured to stop talking to allow me to catch up.”
He stood and got to an angle where he could still stitch and gently guided Steve’s head to his neck, knowing he was putting him right at his scent gland.
“I missed Steve?”
“Would you two stop comparing penis sizes over there? I’m trying to listen to Jane ask about shaving,” Pepper hissed from the other side of Tony, kicking his desk.
,” Thor said quietly, “He would like to take care of you, himself. You are unclaimed, and he has been searching for a worthy mate. You would not have to bond right away, but he would like you to stay in his quarters, where he can woo you and bed you.”
“I made a joke and he got upset,” Tony said, sifting a hand through his hair, “He was ganging up on me with Bruce to stay in medical, so I told him I wanted Barnes to babysit since he was the ‘shiner model’.”
Steve leaned in to kiss Tony, reaching up to cup his chin.
That was the last straw.
“Shhh, Tony, shhh,” Steve soothed as he squeezed Tony’s hand and petted his hair.
Steve raised an eyebrow and looked down at the device. It seemed simple enough; two knobs, and when he turned them, a black line would wiggle across the white background.
“You fell. Hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. You’re just lucky Clint and I were there to grab you,” Bucky said slowly, raising his right arm to show off his hot pink cast, “The others are pretty ticked, but they let me in since I was technically already back here. That, and it took pretty much the whole cavalry to keep Steve from bursting in here.”
“I’d rather lose the company than keep killing innocent people, Rhodes. I’m—I’m not Howard. I don’t
. For now, we need to focus on the harvest and keeping
“Yeah, we’re good. I’m assuming you don’t want to fraternize in front of the larger children?” Steve murmured, reaching up to gently squeeze Tony’s bicep, “Don’t worry. Everything’ll be okay, we’ll get Zola, and I’ll be back in time to try your cooking.”
“My, Anthony, you sure have collected quite a few friends, haven’t you?” She teased, “It’s lovely to meet those of you that I haven’t met before.”
food?” Tony replied, dismissing it with a wave of his hand, “I’m the one who’s really,
“I—uh, we need to make sure PJ stays calm, and you and I are the only ones who seem to be able to do that successfully,” Tony continued, smiling as the boy toddled over and hefted himself up onto the bed, “Plus, if I’m supposed to be staying in bed, you’re more likely to let me leave.”
Now, with graduation on the horizon and college just over the hill, it was difficult to watch Steve be so domestic when Tony knew that Steve was going to have to leave him for months at a time. Sure, they’d have texting and snail mail, but he thrived on touch, and not having him there—
“Winter’s warmth? What is that?” Thor asked, grunting when Bruce shoved him aside to be able to get close enough to Tony to feel his forehead.
“What? What is it?” He asked, raising an eyebrow at PJ, “It’s called an arc reactor. It’s a big magnet in my chest. It keeps shrapnel from slipping down into my heart. It’s really important. And it glows.”
In the silence, the doctor carefully slipped the needle into PJ’s arm, only keeping it there as long as absolutely necessary. Once enough blood had been drawn, he removed the needle, having Tony hold a strip of gauze on the mark until he could put an Iron Man band-aid on it.
“Okay, yeah, so what if I tend to overanalyze little things? That’s how I got to where I am!” He sputtered, putting his hands on his hips, “It’s not—there are too many things here to just all be
to me! He
Tony shrugged.
“Well, I try to cook when you and Thor are both gone, if we’re being honest,” He sighed, grabbing a mug, a thermos, and a ladle, “You two eat enough for seven people each. It’s already difficult enough to make some of those dishes for four people, let alone fourteen, and that only feeds two people. If you want some, you need to eat beforehand, then have small portions of the good stuff.”
“It’s about the device in your husband’s chest,” a second doctor said, pulling the sheets down slightly to reveal the light, “We aren’t sure what it is, but it has certainly been medically implanted. That is, it isn’t necessarily a foreign object that should be removed. In fact, when we tried, he went into shock. We replaced it, and within seconds, his vitals returned to normal. When he wakes up, you need to ask him what it is. I’m no engineer, but I have reason to believe that Mr. Stark-Rogers made the device himself.”
“Whatever the doctor said to him must have worked,” he murmured to himself, blinking slowly as the effects of Bruce’s medication began to make him feel drowsy.
“The what?” Tony asked, snapping himself away from staring at Steve’s extremely flushed face.
“What if we took Rhodey to an upper room? Or moved him to a room in the tavern?” Bucky suggested, “Maybe without his scent, Steve will think the threat is gone.”
such a simple treat could taste. After watching Tony eat it, PJ picked up a piece for himself to nibble on. Once he got a taste, the boy quickly went to scarfing down the sandwich, crusts and all.
“I know that,” he said evenly, “But I also bore witness to their fighting and already stitched one of them up. Forgive me for
Tony flushed a bit and shrugged, not quite meeting Bruce’s eyes.
! Which, Tony didn’t really blame them: if he was dating Clint, he wouldn’t want anyone else to know, either.
“Yeah, he said he doesn’t
Steve’s brows drew together in thought, “Yeah. PJ pulled him off of you.”
It annoyed him that the others had not included him in whatever was going on, but his stomach’s rumbles took precedence over curiosity. He tried to console Peter in one arm as he furiously ate the breakfast Steve had put before him, groaning in satisfaction after each bite. Really, he had never considered himself one to be too concerned with food outside of necessity, but the Warlords’ cuisine made him look forward to eating more than ever.
“...Hello?” He called.
Strong hands settled on his shoulders and guided him back to his chair, pushing until he collapsed and sat. A water bottle and granola bar were put in his hands, but he knew that if he ate he’d just throw it back up. After a moment, Bucky’s face came into view, his eyes flicking back and forth, presumably examining each of Steve’s eyes.
Tony laughed and batted Steve’s hands away so he could shove down his pants, his own erection springing free. A hint of sheepishness showed in his grin, which Steve took as a victory point.
She laid a careful hand on his arm and another on his back, rubbing comforting circles onto his stressed muscles. He barely acknowledged her touch, only slightly turning his head toward her. Sighing, she rested her head on his arm, squeezing his bicep.
“Poor kid,” he whispered once PJ was asleep, “He’s had some rough couple days.”
No sooner had he settled did Steve and Thor’s faces appear above him, but he refused to acknowledge them. Rather, he rubbed smooth circles on Peter’s back, hoping that the babe would fall asleep and force the others to be quiet, so they would not disturb him. Steve began to talk, and after retreating footsteps, the door closed. Tony assumed it was just the three of them, but he still would not look at Steve, choosing to stare at a spot on the ceiling. Steve spoke again; despite not knowing what the words meant, Tony could hear the disappointment in his voice, curdling his insides as he realized that Steve could easily kill them and bury them without the others knowing—or caring, for that matter.
PJ nodded from inside the towel, giggling when Tony plucked it off to show his face. Thankfully, all of the boy’s clothes matched relatively well, so he didn’t waste too much time on picking out an outfit, merely wanting to get it onto the child. Once his shoes were velcroed together, Tony set him on the floor with a kiss on his cheek, causing the boy to squeal in laughter.
Steve choked on air as Tony held in his laughter, digging through the medical supplies for bandaging. The bath had taken care of the cleaning portion, so all he had to do was wrap Steve’s waist and give it a loving pat.
Once the plane stopped, Steve was up and out of his chair, crossing over to Tony to hold his hand again, despite the grumbling around him from the frantic paramedics. The world around him blurred as they started to move. He ignored everything around him, focusing only on pouring his love through their linked hands, hoping that Tony would just
get him killed one of these days. He says that his little skirt and boots are an image he needs to keep up, but I do not believe him one bit. If you ask me, he is almost tempting fate to come after him,” Bruce said, shaking his head.
“Hi, kids,” Steve said, squeezing Tony’s hand, “Look what Mom got me!”
“Clothes. Then we can go run. I’ll even take you to a special level where Papa and I go to run around,” Tony said, making a mental note to add a park scene to their holodeck, “Okay?”
the trophy?”
. It will be over faster than you think.”
“I can easily design and build some weaponry that would only take one or two men to operate,” Tony answered, thinking about the hot oil machine, “It depends on the resources available to me. I am most proficient in handheld weapons, like crossbows, but defensive mechanisms are not difficult. If you can tell me what your most common opponents wear and wield, I can curate designs to properly counter each one.”
“Considering you’re the one who writes up the reports? A little,” Rhodey had joked, shouldering Tony, “But for real man, I miss you. Text me when we can hang out and I’ll come over.”
“No, Papa’s right here,” Steve said as he walked in, slipping an arm around Tony’s waist as he kissed both of them on the cheek, “I was sent to collect you for dinner. Thor roasted a boar and it is just about ready.”
,” he cursed as she ran fingers over the deep bruising on his side, “Broken ribs, definitely broken—”
“Steve?” Tony rasped, licking his bloodied lips before coughing and wheezing in pain, only able to manage one more sentence before passing out:
He offered no other explanation, simply waving him toward the bathroom. Thankfully, Steve had apparently relit all the candles already, so Tony had no trouble with stumbling into the next room. He quickly splashed water on his face, staring at himself in the mirror above the small basin. The skin under his eyes was dark and his cheeks were slightly gaunt, accentuated by his scraggly goatee and unkempt hair. He fixed the latter with water, smoothing it down to try and make himself look presentable when a knock on the door dragged him out of his thoughts.
“No, Tony.
“Which did you assume I don’t want: fatherhood, or you?” Steve asked, looking up from PJ to stare at Tony.
“Tony, it’s okay,” Steve said, trying not to giggle too hard, “If its safe, bring him over. I missed him.”
“No, you move,” Steve murmured, ducking his head to try and hide the bright red flush that dipped down to his neck, “Yeah. I think she was just trying to make my stubbornness into a good quality, though. I have a tendency to do that.”
Thankfully, Peter stayed quiet, sated by his meal and Tony’s warm arms. By the time he was being lowered into his bassinet, he was asleep again, not even twitching when Tony covered his legs with furs and bent down to kiss his forehead.
“Fine, fine. Just ready to eat and get the day started, is all,” Tony lied, moving Peter up to his shoulder so he did not have to look Steve in the face.
Rhodey winked and snuggled himself closer, tucking his head into Tony’s neck to scent him. Tony grumbled, but it had been so long since he had seen his best friend, so he carefully did not look at Steve and pretended like he was not aware of what was going on. Instead, he turned to his dinner, making sure to pay attention to Peter while he ate. The one time he snuck a look at Steve, the Prime was staring back at him, his eyes seeming to bore into his soul. He quickly looked away, unsure if the feeling in his stomach was fear or guilt.
“A good walk then?” Rhodey teased.
he thought distantly, turning the page.
He yawned softly and snuggled down under his blanket, reaching out to grab Tony’s hand. Baffled by the admission, Tony stared at their hands again, feeling emotion well up behind his eyes and threaten to spill over. To keep himself from crying, he ducked his face into Mr. Rabbit’s fur, squeezing Steve’s hand back.
“On your knees, cheek on the bed, please,” he requested, “I want to check you over again, just to make sure nothing tore.”
“What’s this for?” Steve asked in a tight voice, taking the thermos and clearly holding back from crushing it.
“You’ve always been there for me. Whether or not you knew it,” he said quietly, dropping his hands to his lap, “I just—I wanted you to know that.”
“Are you better, friend?” Thor asked nervously, breaking the silence, “I did not mean to sour you, I swear.”
He blinked and nodded, trying to process all that was going on, but his head was fogged and heavy. Thor gave him a smile and gently nudged him toward the Prime, signaling to him to go. Obedient, Tony padded behind the Prime as they exited the throne room, keeping his head up to begin cataloging the layout of the castle. They only walked to the first wooden door, which the Prime opened for him, gesturing for Tony to walk in first. Tony stopped and looked at him; it was odd, to allow the Omega to walk into a room before the Alpha, but in the grand scheme of how the day was going, he decided to let it be and walked in. For the umpteenth time, his mouth fell open, unable to convey his awe at the grandeur of the room.
“At ease, Prime. No one is going to steal us from you,” he teased just to watch Steve’s cheeks tint pink, “You cannot help yourself, can you?”
“Yeah, yeah, I love you too, you big sap,” Tony snorted, scooting off of Steve’s lap, “You have fun with your wank material, babe, I’m going to keep working.”
“I think
“Can you feel me, Steven? Buried deep in your gut?” He purred, “You like feeling my thick cock filling you up?
, his mind said, recognizing the pressure of the nails on his scalp.
The illness had left him shaking from root to toe, which included his hands. Every time he tried to tip the wineskin down, the milk would slosh and he would pull back, afraid that he would accidentally pour it all over Peter and himself. Frustrated, tears pricked his eyes and Tony thrust the wineskin into Steve’s hands, motioning toward Peter.
“I cannot help that his Prime Alpha biology is not sated easily. Believe me, I do not wish to have an audience just as much as you do not wish to have a show. He needs it though--if he did not have to sit on his throne and face the people, he would have me speared in our bed and talk to them through the window. It seems to be the only way to get him to think clearly.”
It was quiet again, and Tony took the opportunity to look out of the window, watching the fields and trees roll below them. There was a sigh from the backseat, which nearly made him turn around to start another shouting match, but he kept his mouth clamped shut, deciding to be the bigger person.
“I am sorry if he makes you feel jealous, darling,” Tony said, snuggling into Steve’s side to rest his head on his shoulder, “He trusts you about as much as you trust him, and you have seen what lengths he will go to to try and make sure I am safe. Though I figure that you could hold your own, I still do not want you two to fight.”
“Tony just—get
“Hah. Tired already?” Tony teased gently.
Ask me questions over @avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
“It should be okay. Pete will nap for a while anyway,” he decided, “Let me tell him so he does not worry.”
“May--Can I join you? To rest?”
“If I knew you weren’t going to turn into a big green angry jelly bean, I’d tell you to fuck off.”
, you know. It’s not like I can do it to you.”
“It is no excuse, though. I should… I should be able to control my jealousy and not be so strung-up when I see other Alphas ogle you and your body.”
“I do not want him to get hurt on accident if he can reach it,” Tony said sadly, not really wanting to let the warm cloak go.

“He doesn’t like to be bothered.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Doesn’t mean I’m happy about it or that I’m not going to try and get to the workshop sometime when you all are asleep,” he pouted, folding his arms over his chest.
Just an added bonus. Enjoy!
“Hey. He’s okay. He’s a tough bird,” he said gently, moving to place his hands on Steve’s chest, “He’ll be okay.”
please
“Okay, sailor, what’s wrong?” Tony pushed, turning his body to give the other more attention, “All of a sudden you’ve been acting weird. First, it’s the stumbled awkward greetings, then the constantly trying to help when I don’t need help, then you looked at me like a
“It didn’t fail,” Tony said quietly, “He has one success. And from Bucky’s insight into the Winter Soldier program, it's technically possible that Zola could, if he got his hands on the kid, reprogram him with a chip that could be accessed wirelessly. And if Zola got into the internet…”
He scoffed and rolled his eyes, but he considered it, nibbling on his lip as he thought.
“N-never, never--”
“Hey, you going to say hi to Steve?” He asked PJ, watching the boy stare at the Captain, “He won’t bite. He’s just a bit big. Don’t worry, he scares me too sometimes.”
A soft moan slipped out, startling Tony and jolting his foot in Steve’s hands. Steve did not let go, instead applying more pressure and moving down the arch to his heel, tugging on Tony a bit to pull his foot into his lap. Looking down at Steve in disbelief, the Alpha merely batted his eyes back, features innocent.
“Hi, you. Sorry it took me so long. I was talking to Uncle Bruce,” Tony explained, crouching down to PJ’s level, “I’m guessing the nurses said it was okay for you to go back up. Why don’t we get you some juice and finish making up your room, huh?”
Together, they squished onto the couch, ending up with Tony on Steve’s lap, his back pressed up against Thor’s arm. It felt warm, comforting,
“Oh, gods, they were that scared? Psh, then they have no business being at a brothel,” Tony said dismissively, “If it had been me, I would have happily been ripped in two by your delicious cock.”
Bruce reached over and took Tony’s free hand between his own, squeezing tightly.
“Hey. Look. You both have feelings for each other, and now you have the little guy to take care of. You might as well try it, because neither of you are getting any younger, and he’s going to need both of you. If you choose to just let it be, fine, but really. Do us all a favor and just—y’know. Stop making us all awkward with the sexual tension. Now, I’m going to go upstairs and gossip, and leave you two to do whatever,” Rhodey sighed, standing and brushing out his suit jacket, “And you, little man, are going to play with the train set I brought you later, okay? Be good for your dads.”
“Barnes said he would have liked to keep you,” Thor explained, rolling his eyes at the antics, “He is lying, of course, he is
“You—is that not how you feel?” Steve asked, mirroring Tony’s confusion, “You—I mean, we talked a bit, but you seemed to be saying that you just—that you
“I know you do, but somebody has to look out for you before you get knotted on some asshole you regret bonding with,” Rhodey said, patting Tony’s back, “And, seeing as he’s already gone to town on your nipples, I am a
“You didn’t have to.”
“What? Have I been thoroughly investigated now?” he snorted.
“You did so well, darling, you were so good for me,” he praised softly, crawling up the rock to lay down next to the Alpha, “Are you alright? Do you hurt?”
“I’m not.”

can fix it. I am not the one Steven is gone over,” she answered.
mean?”
Forcing himself forward, Tony exited the room and closed the door behind him, choosing that moment to realize how hard his heart was thumping in his chest. Sensing the panic that was rising in his chest, he scanned the area before ducking into the room over, quietly closing and locking the door so he was alone. Knowing that SHIELD liked to soundproof things, Tony opened up a call, sitting down heavily on the empty bed.
“We lost a few soldiers,” he continued roughly, “Natasha will provide a listing so the families can grieve. For now, we will rest. And as consolation--”
He gently licked at Steve’s bleeding bondmark and kissed it lightly, loving how Steve shivered and jolted as he rode out his knot. He sighed happily and nuzzled Steve’s cheek, careful to not hit his nose.
He was just glad that he had worn two pairs of underwear so he could actually sit on his bottom without squirming in pain.
Steve rolled his eyes, scooting off of the bed with a sigh as he stretched out his arms.
He quickly scooped Peter up and hurried him over, tucking him in with one of the smaller bed’s furs in the hopes that the scent that lingered would keep him calm. The noises started up again and the door handle rattled; Tony all but threw himself back onto the big bed and dragged the furs over his body, feigning sleep just as the door creaked open.
“Do not fret. The Prime has no trouble in battle, but if it brings you comfort to know that I am at his side, then I will be there,” Thor promised, “While I watch for him, keep an eye on the good Doctor for me. He gets into trouble without the rest of us around.”
The sentence was translated, then the two men quietly left the room, leaving Tony alone with Peter. Carefully, he stood and held the baby up against his chest, turning around to push the clothes off of the bed and onto the floor. He lowered himself onto one side, letting out a soft sigh as he settled down on the unfairly comfortable bed, adjusting Peter so he was laid stomach-down on Tony’s chest. He knew he should wait for the others to return so he could crawl into his own bed, but the day had exhausted him to the point that all he had to do was let his eyes rest for a second or two and he fell asleep.
“Mmm, the
Embarrassment roared through his body.
“Steve’s health had gotten to a point that it was either sign up for shady experimental testing or die,” Bucky said, pretending to not see Steve’s face twist up and look away, “I wouldn’t let him do that shit
“Uh—” Steve paled slightly and coughed, shrugging, “Sort of? I always carry some water with me, so I used half of it to wash out the tannings.”
Jarvis visibly stilled, the guilt in his eyes betraying his confidence.
to have to suddenly be a father. Hell, you’re barely what, twenty-six? You should be out living life,” Tony replied, ignoring the twist in his gut, “I can take care of him. You—you can take a get out of jail free card here. It’s okay. I mean, I understand, he’s also mine so I get it if parenthood with the least capable of the team seems like the worst idea in the world—”
. Breathe for me, honey. In and out.”
“He’s right. If Sam’s out there, he should have the best of the best, which is, of course, invented by yours truly.”
Wanting to snap back, Tony sucked back his words as pain nearly made his knees buckle when two of the guards yanked him up out of his seat. He managed to get his feet under him as they walked the same path back toward their cell, with PJ still tucked into his shoulder. He followed the guards into the medical wing, extremely reluctant to let any of the staff come near him. Eventually, he was corralled back toward what looked like a decontamination shower with six guards standing watch.
“Sorry,” he apologized, scooping Peter up out of the crib to start the baby’s morning routine.
“Then I want Bucky to babysit me since Steve isn’t on my side,” he decided, smirking when Steve’s face fractionally dropped, “Yeah, that’s right. I’m trading you in for the shinier model.”
“Nothing,” Tony said quickly, cursing his inner monologue from escaping.
He reached down to tweak one and Tony yelped in pain, reflexively sitting up and smacking Rhodey’s hand away. The two men stared at each other for a moment, but Tony cut in before Rhodey could say anything.
“Of course,” Bruce answered slowly, raising an eyebrow, “Do you want me to get Steve? Or at least find out where he went?”
“He takes my favorite jam,” he blurted, eyes widening as he realized he couldn’t back out, “I mean, uh, yeah. At breakfast. He likes to have jam on toast some mornings, and he knows I import my blackberry jam and that it is
If Peter was opposed to his plan, he made no comment on it, as he complied with wriggling into his new clothes and being laid down. Satisfied that the baby was set and safe, Tony rummaged through the closet until he found new underwear and one of Steve’s few shirts. Out of habit, he looked around before putting the fabric to his nose and inhaling deeply, allowing the scent of the Prime to ease the tension in his body. The shirt went on, and though it only hung to mid-thigh, Tony decided to skip pants for the time being. He much preferred wearing Steve’s larger clothes and there were no pants or skirts of the Alpha’s that would stay up on his smaller frame.
“He wasn’t there, inconsistent, Steve,” he mumbled, wishing he could hug the drawing without crumpling it.
“Up and at ‘em, Stark. Zola wants to see you. Bring the subject,” the lackey said, hefting his weapon in his hands, “Move.”
“Yes, Tony,” Nat snorted, “Alright, Steve, what does Tony think is your most annoying habit?”
“Yeah, I’m over having your meaty paws all over my work,” Tony said, laughing as he tilted his head to kiss Steve properly, “Mmm, you need a coat. It’s a brisk day.”
,” the guard barked, pointing his weapon up rather than at them, “Get the kid and
“Sometimes, when Howard became particularly violent, I would experience what my godfather would call ‘episodes’…I lose time. I see things, hear things…hallucinations,” he explained, feeling uncomfortable with Thor and Steve’s gazes on them as Thor quietly translated under his breath, “Eventually it tires me out and it goes away. I… I think Steve’s yelling triggered it, but I am not sure. Only Howard had ever caused it to happen before.”
Tony rolled his eyes and smacked Steve’s hands to get him to release, heading over to PJ to inspect the problem. The boy merely pointed at the sink, reaching his hands up toward Tony with a whine.
“Out of wedlock, but more importantly, his mother is—was—an Omega as well,” Tony said.
“Sorry, honey. I know it is not fun, but you would not like soap in your eyes,” he said, immediately tucking Peter back into place once he was done, “See? Not so bad. Now, all you have to do is lay there while I finish up. Then we can have some Daddy-Peter time, yeah?”
“Bye, Steeb,” Tony said, and with a bashful wave, let his Mother lead him out of the classroom.
Tony followed Bruce over to the group and acknowledged them with a wave, only smiling when Thor turned to beam at him.
Tony could only hide his face in Peter’s cheek, biting back the shame that swept through him when dry fingers prodded around his hole. It was
“What?” Rhodey interjected, clearly confused.
“It’s okay. I like-like you too.”
, he will always follow you, even if you go away to school,” Natasha said quietly, starting to dab foundation onto Tony’s bruising, “It is how bullies are. Something should be done.”
“Clint. Could you send Steve and Bucky in here?” Tony asked, sitting down on the bed next to PJ.
He eagerly climbed into the limo, finding himself squished between Pepper and Steve. The others were happily chattering amongst themselves, seemingly uncaring that they could all barely fit on the bench. Of course, Bucky tried to inspect the liquor cabinet, but Jarvis had padlocked it shut, which made Tony feel much better.

“Yes, Lang, we established that,” Natasha sighed, shaking her head.
“That’s it, that’s my husband, nice and easy,” Tony soothed, “Better? Yeah? A little bit?”
Tony barely got one footstep toward the door when a sharp pain electrified his heart and crackled through his ribs. His gasp was silent as he stumbled and smacked a hand on the wall, stunned by the sudden surge from the bond. It was difficult to concentrate on shaky legs, but Tony shut his eyes tight and tried to feel around the bond anyway. Searing heat radiated from the connection, burning in fierce rage and protectiveness. Unable to withstand it any longer, Tony’s eyes flew open and he forced himself to move, knowing that he needed to find Steve.
Go Team Asgard.
Taking a careful breath, Tony steeled himself against the bait in favor of looking down at PJ with a warm smile.
“You had your turn, Alpha. Your knot will just have to wait until after I get to breed you.”
“We finished outfitting the Prime’s room for you,” Thor explained with a smile, stepping back to allow Steve to help Tony up, “I hope it is too your liking—if you need anything else, I will do my best to have it arranged and brought to you.”
you—”
Tony muttered a quick
“Yes, he said a few words before he passed out in the wreckage,” he answered nervously.
, and
“PJ threw up on your hoodie.”
Eyes widening, PJ nodded quickly, letting go of Tony to grasp at Natasha’s curls. A rare smile skirted across her lips as she put her hand out, letting the boy hold onto her. Together, they walked over to the group of Avengers; quickly, Natasha scooped him up under his armpits and set him on his feet on the arm of the couch, putting him at everyone else’s height.
Even Bucky had to frown at that, leveling Steve with a stare.
He poked the baby’s belly and smiled at his tiny squeals, playfully kissing his tummy until the babe squirmed in protest.
“If he starts to cry or get too fussy and you cannot calm him, bring him to me. Otherwise, I trust you will keep him safe until I come back?”
“Then--what?” Bruce interrupted, only to wince under Tony’s gaze, “Sorry. Continue.”
He really should have realized it sooner, but he supposed that in adjusting to the new century, Steve hadn’t really taken the time to recognize Tony’s ‘help’ as advances. He honestly thought the engineer was just being
Subconsciously, Tony began to arrange the pillows around them in a circle, then grabbed the furs to drape over himself and Peter’s legs. The babe was laying next to his head and only a small glance at Peter’s face told him everything he needed to know.
“Is it about Steve?” Bucky asked, clearly not believing him.
“Oh, screw off, I can carry it,” He snapped, only to recoil and look ashamed, “Sorry. I didn’t mean that. It’s just—”
“When this is done,” he said, looking into Steve’s teary eyes, “I promise you, I’ll take you to see her. We’ll go together. Alright? You’re not alone in this. Same way I know that I’m not alone in this, either. Sure, I’m not exactly a kickass, beautiful dame, and nothing about our lives is ever going to be normal, but you’ve got me, the team, and now this small bean. If Aunt Peg was here, she’d be proud, Steve. I know she would be.”
Tony blinked his misty eyes and nodded, only to shake his head and sniffle.
“Children,” Bruce interrupted, rolling his eyes, “Please. Just focus on making sure PJ gets through the next two nights, alright? And Tony, stay in your damn bed. The Other Guy isn’t happy you got hurt.”
“Steve, stop it, I’m an ugly crier and you know it—”
“Imagine learning that there are more than three states of matter after being told there’s only three for most of your schooling. Learning that something so simple as
“Right. You’re on the team headed to the Sahara,” Tony said, shaking his head when Steve opened his mouth, “I agreed you should go. Bruce and Wanda are staying here, so they need the manpower. We’ll be okay while you’re gone.”
“Good. I don’t ever want to do this again,” Bruce agreed, fixing his glasses on his face, “I’ll stick to the library, thank you.”
He honestly really hated that he had to use a rolling backpack, but if he was going to carry his AP Calculus, AP Government, Physics, and ACT study guide textbooks around, Tony recognized that he did indeed have a weak back and would not be able to carry them around by himself. However, Steve
“For you, anything.”
Steve gave a tight nod, so Tony applied pressure, unable to help his soft gasp as milk spurted from his nipple in a stream into the thermos. He barely managed to hold on, as Steve was writhing and arching under him, lip firmly between his teeth to hold back his whimpers.
Thankfully, the ride back to the Tower was mostly uneventful, other than the lectures from Steve about being more careful, and the panicked calls from Rhodey and Pepper about leaving (Rhodey) and being gone (Pepper). PJ kept his little face pressed to the windows as they traveled, eyes wide as he watched the ground speed by below them.
“Oh, no. Same. Me too. Dudes, I mean. Yes. Absolute yes,” Tony said quickly, stumbling over his words, “I just—with Howard and all. J knows. Mom probably does. But yes. Dudes are a yes.”
“Oh, no, that’s the
The arms around him were strong, solid, comfortable; Tony buried himself in Steve’s chest and savored the feeling, only to squeak in surprise when he was lifted up, instinctively wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist.
Steve’s glare softened to a pout and he turned back around, haughtily folding his arms over his chest again. Tony sighed and rolled his eyes.
Steve put a hand on Tony’s knee and squeezed gently.
All eyes turned to the babe in Tony’s arms. Even though he was used to a thousand gazes, feeling Pepper’s and Steve’s eyes on him made his reactor suddenly feel a hundred pounds heavier. Attempting to steel himself, Tony nodded, shifting PJ to better hold him.
“You are very cute when you do that,” he admitted, seeing a bit of himself in the expression, “You look like a kicked puppy. Not that
The two looked at each other until Bucky cast his glance away, lips twitching slightly in annoyance.
“Then turn your ears on.”
Steve nodded, offering a watery smile. He looked around at the team, took one deep breath, and stood, pulling Tony up with him without letting go of his hand.
Tony watched as she left, momentarily stunned. A bit of guilt nagged at his brain as he immediately thought about Steve, but he shoved it down, knowing he needed to focus on the situation at hand. Carefully, he reached over to take PJ’s small hand in his own, careful of the IV in his hand. He finally realized how fragile the small child was: not only was he weak to the point of barely being able to function like a normal child, but his abused psyche no doubt affected him in ways that even Tony had trouble understanding. It was all he could do for the moment, to sit and wait and
“That’s it. You can sit. Time for socks and sneakers, then you’re all good,” Tony continued to talk to PJ, soothing him as he slipped the items onto the boy and set the shoes’ velcro straps, “There you go, buddy. Why don’t you go show Tasha how good you look, huh? She likes a well-dressed man.”
“Rhodey could also take care of him, but necessary time could be wasted in attempted translation. Since you can speak both languages, if something goes wrong, you will be able to keep everyone in the loop,” he explained, “Plus, I have seen you with Peter already. He is comfortable in your arms.”
“I’m always here for you, Anthony,” Steve said seriously, forcing himself to meet Tony’s eyes, “I promise. Til the end of the line.”
“Are you sure? I don’t—I can’t wake up again and have you not be here,” Tony confessed, fisting his hands into Steve’s tactical suit.
Peter continued to cry as Tony checked his undergarments and bounced him, mentally ticking off reasons as to why the baby could be upset. Finally, out of desperation, Tony shucked up his shirt and the stupid nursing bra, holding the hems in his teeth as he guided Peter up. The babe took a second to latch, but once he did, he settled and his tears dried up. Relieved, Tony sent up a quick prayer to the divine, thankful that the babe was only hungry and not traumatized by Steve’s and his behavior. Careful of the material, he slowly let the bra and his shirt down, tucking one into the other to keep it in place.
“Still! I can’t believe he’s shacking up with Stark and telling him shit and doesn’t even have the balls to admit it!” Bucky shouted, turning to face Natasha.
Smiling in relief at the boy’s giggle, Tony quickly wiped the last of tears away as he carried him out to the living room. With a grunt, he sat down on the big couch, letting PJ curl up in his lap with the elephant still attached to his hip. Unsurprisingly, Steve collapsed down onto the couch next to them, placing the cup on a side table and sighing, either in tiredness or frustration. Seeing the Captain, PJ glared, immediately shifting to press his face into Tony’s chest and turn his back to Steve.
He watched her go with a sigh, finishing off the rest of his coffee and sticking the mug in the dishwasher before going back out to the communal lounge. Sure, he didn’t mind having the kid to himself for a few weeks, but without Steve? Everything was so new; they’d barely talked about where they stood relationship-wise, and now he was going to be gone—
“I already told you, I am not feeding him from my breast, even though you want me to,” Tony said, wishing he felt well so he could properly glare at Steve, “I said
Realizing he didn’t reply, Tony awkwardly cleared his throat and shrugged.
“But we will only get dirty again, we could wait--”
“If anything, you should be grateful, since he put together my escape plan
“Shh, don’t cry,” Tony tried to soothe, shuffling forward, “Let me help, okay? I have to touch, though. You’re too small to get up there right now and we don’t have any step stools or anything. Is it okay if I touch?”
It was quiet for a moment before Tony shot out of his chair like a rocket, but Steve was faster; he quickly shoved the book under his ass and sat up, folding his arms even though his husband pulled and pushed on him.
Steve was about as red as a spring poppy and starting to smell of embarrassment, which made Tony giggle and put a hand on Steve’s cheek.
“Good gods, Steve. I get it, alright? I get it. You think I belong to you and that Rhodey has no right to care for me,” Tony snapped, turning on his heel to face the Alpha, “Well guess what? Rhodey has known me for a
One of the drivers in front of them turned around and spoke to Thor. He nodded and spoke back, patting the driver on his shoulder.
“I do not think I could, even if I tried,” he admitted, “My head is filled with thoughts of protecting you and the baby. I need to silence my mind if I want to truly rest.”
“…Kisses for my lovely wife,” he mumbled, embarrassment tinting his cheeks.
He yelped when Steve rushed him and grabbed him around the waist to attempt to take him to the floor. Thankfully he had half the mind to plant his back foot, allowing him to jut his knee up into Steve’s sternum. Steve grunted and his grip slackened enough that Tony could shove him back.
When he dropped the engineer’s portrait off, stuck firmly to the Etch-A-Sketch, he told Tony to try a bit harder next time he wanted to be embarrassed. Tony merely smirked up at Steve, a mysterious twinkle in his chocolate eyes.
“Well done, my love,” he murmured, wrapping one arm around Steve and raising the other so he could pet Steve’s hair, “Communication is not so bad, right? And we did not even need Thor this time.”
“Well, shit,” he said, his voice sounding foreign to his own ears, “Tony’s trying to
He leaned forward and carefully ate the fruit from Steve’s fingers, relishing the sweet taste. The fresh foods he had eaten while in the North had been nothing short of delicious, and he found himself able to ignore the other Warlords’ gazes while enjoying it. Eventually, the others sat and began to eat as well and the room filled with chatter, easily dissipating the strained tension that had lingered in the air. Once Tony had eaten, he shifted on Steve’s lap to turn himself inward, then moved Peter down into his arms. Making sure that no one was watching, he guided Peter up to his chest, having to juggle him a bit until he could latch on. Tony hissed, still unused to the feeling, and a hand settled on his back; Steve could no doubt feel the ache radiating off of him and was trying to provide some comfort.
“No-one has experience in parenting until they have a child, and given that repertoire, don’t you think I’m the best candidate for relating to the child and helping him cope?” Tony snarled, curling the child closer to his chest.
“Babe, I love you, but I’m not having full sex here. I’m not risking that with dinosaurs around. So we either have to do this standing up or—”
“Awe, baby, you had a crush on me?”
“Why did you say that I am Peter’s only parent? Did you bond with me under the assumption that you would not also become his parent?”
“Ah. The experiment,” Fury said once the team approached, his one eye fixed on the child, “Good. Bring him in.”
“He is—was my best friend,” Tony explained with a wince, pretending not to watch Natasha stalk around the room, “He was my first friend in preschool, he befriended me for literally no reason other than liking my shirt, he was my first and only crush and I’ve been in love with him since he kissed me on the playground the first day I met him, god, Rhodes, he’s everything I’ve ever wanted and he threw me away for
“Is everything alright? You left the dining hall so quickly,” he asked, nodding at Thor to have him join their conversation, “Do you need to leave? I want to know what is going on.”
“—Steve? Are you even listening? God, you better not have died while I was talking, that would be so incredibly rude—"
“I wasn’t sure what you’d like, so I went with Black Widow,” Tony explained, grinning at the boy’s wide eyes, “That’s Nat. She looks pretty cool on a shirt, yeah?”
“Why are you here, Steve?” He finally asked, deciding to poke the elephant in the room.
, I will personally eject you from the top of the tower,” he growled, “You are going to sit here and help me with
Steve jutted his chin out at them, crossing his arms over his chest and looking at them with the kind of determination that made his spine tingle. Tony stared back at Steve, and then he stared some more, only to turn on his heel and march down to the door that he had remembered led to Steve’s—and now his—quarters. He did not bother to close the door behind him and barely took in the additions to the room, choosing to instead plop himself down on the newly added single bed. After arranging Peter on his chest and pulling up blankets and furs over them both, he stared at the ceiling, trying to sort out what had just happened in his head.
Steve interrupted him by laughing, leaning to knock his head down against Tony’s. He turned to smile at him, reaching up to cup his cheek before pecking him gently on the lips.
“Hey. Shh, little one, it’s okay,” Tony soothed, motioning toward Natasha for the abandoned box of tissues, “You’re okay. I’m not going anywhere without you, okay? No need to cry. I’m right here.”
Wonderful.
“You are insufferable. He just wants to walk. Even if he
bad. Really, he knew he was just going to miss having him by his side on the field to pass fancy footwork back and forth.
“We have a guest,” he said, voice still thick with sleep.
“Wow. I mean, you’re right, it may help, but wow, Tony. I thought the whole telling Steve about Margaret even
He stopped them and turned Tony toward him, reaching up to cup his cheek in his large palm.
“Are you alright?” He asked.
The pull to join the baby in sleep became unbearable. He shifted the furs around so he was covered up to the neck and closed his eyes, breathing in the mixed scent of both Peter and Steve to calm his thoughts. Exhaustion from the hectic morning settled in his bones and he was dead to the world. He slept dreamlessly until commotion outside of the room triggered something in his brain and his eyes snapped open. His poor heart pounded as he sluggishly grappled with trying to figure out what woke him up.
“I’m awake, you can come in,” Tony called over Rhodey’s response, grinning at the other’s clearly displeased look.
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve panted, glacially pushing in to give him time to adjust, “Y’feel so good, darling, so
“It will feel strange for a while,” Tony said as he juggled eating with a curious, handsy baby, “It will take a bit to get used to.”
“Not for you, my love. Not to eat, anyway,” he soothed, turning off the tap and stepping into the warm water, “Are you hungry again, sweet one? It has been another eventful day; I would not be surprised—”
“Do you have a game today?” Steve asked, wincing as he slumped down into the desk.
“PJ, be kind. He isn’t going to take Nat away,” he said, watching the boy shuffle on his feet, “He’s trying to be nice to you.”
The soccer team that Tony was the Captain on, allowing them to spend time together after school when Tony’s parents would usually whisk him home to force him to study.
A clothing stall with cloaks caught his eye, but before he could head over, a cold hand on his left arm startled him. He turned and blinked at the young woman who was talking quite animatedly.
sorry for
The nurse looked unimpressed, but nodded, waiting for Tony to stand before ushering them both over to a gurney. Tony quickly picked PJ up and set him on the bed before sitting on it himself, only showing any signs of pain when the nurse began to poke at the mess of bruises on his left side.
“If its any help, his vomit was disgustingly orange. I’d say its something with the sweet potatoes,” Tony said.
no us. You—you
“No!” Steve shot at Clint, growling slightly, “That’s gross, Clint.”
,” he said casually, making sure his ID was close enough for her to read.
Without looking up from his phone, Steve said, “Stealing his jam. The French brand. It reminds me of stuff I managed to snag during the war, and it’s really good, but that shit’s expensive. I eat it anyway and it pisses him off.”
“Our best archer, Clinton Barton,” Thor said, switching to the Southern dialect for Tony’s benefit, “His pinpoint accuracy with a longbow is unparalleled. He, along with our falconer, train and keep our band of fellows. He knows pieces of your language, but he prefers to speak with his hands.”
“I shall ask the good doctor. He knows more about pheromones than any of us,” Thor said.
“If you are going to make a fuss, try not to be too harsh. If Peter starts wailing, Rhodey will come running and I do not want him to know that I am feeding him like this,” he said quietly, turning his eyes up to meet Steve’s piercing gaze.
An enormous washing tub took up the middle of the room, sized like it belonged in a bathhouse rather than in one’s home. The faucet over it suggested running water, which surprised Tony the most out of everything that he had seen so far. He had never thought of the Warlords as having a technologically advanced society like his own, but here he was, watching the Prime fill up the large tub with steaming water.
“As soon as I can get the message to Pepper, I’m shutting down the weapons sector of Stark Industries and moving fully into green energy,” he continued, surprising all three men, “I already have the plans—the arc reactor is going to be the center of it all. It’s a little ironic, but it's sustainable. It
. That’s pretty awesome. I like counting myself. I’d love to teach you to count higher, if you want. I bet you could learn to count to
He closed his eyes again and focused, attempting to comfort Steve through their link. It was like trying to have a conversation using only facial expressions, which meant Tony could not tell Steve where he was, but he could send over his hunger pains. The bond settled and Tony opened his eyes, having to bite his inner cheek to keep from laughing when he heard the sound of bare feet running on stone; the dining hall doors burst open to reveal Steve, clad only in his traditional skirt. He locked eyes on Tony and strode over, cupping his hands around the Omega’s face.
He was quiet for the rest of the carriage ride, busying himself with attempting to calm Peter down enough to rest and thinking about what he had gotten himself into. Sure, his father had forced him to study various cultures in order to prepare him to assume the throne, but his few hours of lecture about the Warlords said nothing about tolerance in general, let alone that for couples. It was startling to hear that a group he was raised to think of as violent warmongers was actually quite progressive and, so far, quite kind. Kindness was a rare commodity, and to be gifted it by a stranger that looked like he could snap him in half with a flick of his wrist made Tony feel confused and a bit uneasy. His ability to trust had long been shattered; he began to bundle Peter up once again, swaddling him as tight as he could in case he needed to flee from the colony. Most likely, he would not make it far, but he would take his chances if his situation began to sour.
“Oh, so he tells me he’s swiss cheese then changes the subject—I’m fine, it’s been relatively boring around here, save for the mutant son we—
“Oh, yes, please make yourself at home, not like I wanted that warmth or anything,” He grumbled, watching PJ snuggle up to Steve’s side, “You’re a brat, you know that? You come in here, take him
he wouldn’t let him hurt me anymore and he
Once the agonizing pain started to subside, Tony let out another painful scream at a sharp tug and give. The guard tsked and one arm came around to show Tony the bloody GPS chip in his palm.
“This. This is weird,” Clint voiced, “Like,
He smoothed Peter’s wispy hairs down, smiling at the babe’s sleepy face. Carefully, he managed to pull him away from his nipple, easing the babe up onto his chest to pat his back and burp him. With Peter finally settled, Tony reached for the bowl of broth that Thor had brought, sighing happily as he curled his hand around the warm bowl. He slowly brought it up to his mouth and drank as much as he was willing to risk since he was still worried about not being able to get out of the bed if his nausea returned. No sooner had he put the bowl down did a knock sound at the door and it opened, revealing the good doctor.
Thor answered, but he did not quite hear it; he nodded anyway, figuring the Prime would follow them. Eventually, the castle came back into view and Tony wriggled, intending on walking by himself. He pouted when Thor refused to put him down and intended to make noise about it until he was gently placed on a cot and swarmed by Steve. The receding panic left Tony feeling groggy and unable to fight, so he lazily tried to swipe at him, only to have his hand grabbed by Bruce.
“The child is our priority, first and foremost. We’re all adults, but he is
“Actually, he’s been the one carrying up these boxes. JARVIS had some stuff delivered express,” Pepper corrected, finally taking her eyes off the boy, “He’s probably down in the guest room by your bedroom building things and setting stuff up.”
Tony growled when his mind supplied
“What happened?” he asked, rolling over whatever Steve was going to say next, “Who died? Do I need to kill someone?”
He wrinkled his nose at the thought.
to me, little one,” He murmured once he was calm, “I think I’ll keep you on goat’s milk for now, love.”
The more he let the name perch on the end of his tongue, the more Tony decided it wasn’t too bad of a name.
“...Yes, for Peter and I,” he clarified, “What did you think I meant?”
“I suppose you are right,” he conceded unhappily, “But I still hate the thought that she is suffering and I am not there to console her. If only I had kept to myself, I--”
Silence was never good.
“He has been such a sweet baby. I have never seen one so docile and easy-going before,” Bruce said, “You really are good to him, you know.”
think is best, but I said
It was tempting bait. Being pampered and fussed over by an Alpha sounded blissful, but Tony had always been too stubborn over his pride to let go. Instead, he crawled into the single bed with Peter and laid the baby on his chest, making sure to keep his legs slightly open to alleviate the ache. If it were not for the disappointment and worry tugging on the bond, Tony would have easily fallen asleep.
“Possibly,” T’Challa answered with a nod, “Shuri got in touch with Vision and Dr. Banner, and the three of them have pinpointed an outpost similar to the one you originally infiltrated. However, it is deep in the Sahara Desert, so we suspect that it is a much larger complex than what scans are showing. Plus, it’s an ideal location for keeping hostages, as they cannot possibly escape and survive in the desert for very long.”
“Would you ever fuck Barnes?” He asked, wincing when Steve whirled around to glare at him.
Steve did not seem to care about Tony’s protests, but he quickly became bored with just Tony’s arm and tried to pull him in again. This time, he tugged a little too hard and Tony cried out in pain, jerking his arm out of the cell to cradle to his chest. He ignored Steve’s growls and pathetic whines and stood to leave, pretending as though his knees were not knocking together in fear.
“Da?”
, my little Omega--”
up,” Rhodey said.
“Steve.”
“I know, I’m such an uglier crier,” He sighed, smiling when Tony finally turned to give him a look, “What? I am.”
“Hey, love. What’s up?” Steve’s voice finally said.
“Papa,” PJ acquiesced, nodding.
“Wanda would have a fit,” Bruce interrupted, pinching the bridge of his nose.
As always, unbeta'd. Comments and kudos are really appreciated. Ask me questions over
your fault,” Tony said, starting to rub circles onto Steve’s back, “There’s a lot of people at fault, but not you. Never you, sweetheart. Besides, the people who did this are long dead.”
Natasha turned to Thor, who raised his card sheepishly.
That was, except for Tony.
“Sorry, peanut. I can’t right now. Soon, okay?” He promised, “How about you hold my hand instead? We have to go back down to the funny smelling place so I can get checked out.”
Tony looked up at Steve, and seeing the distant look in his eyes, knew what he was remembering.
Natasha stared him down without judgment in her eyes, but the crawling feeling of shame latched onto his neck anyway, making him hang his head to not meet her gaze. Instantly, her hand was in his hair, manicured nails delicately scratching his scalp.
“So, Natty dear, what’s the 411?” Tony asked, “We got info on HYDRA’s whereabouts?”
He could smell the concern radiating off of Steve, but he did not ask any questions, which Tony was thankful for. Steve stood and carried Tony bridal-style back to their room, gently laying him down on the large bed. Tony grabbed at him and pulled him down before he could get too far away, capturing his lips with a throaty whine.
“I think I just died,” Steve answered, grinning at Tony’s laugh as the other clambered off of him, “I’m pretty sure I died. I just died and went to heaven and met the most beautiful angel—”
This was Steve’s second Christmas without his dad. Last year had been awful; Miss Sarah only had a landline as it was, and Tony could clearly remember the night when their own phone rang, and a sobbing Steve had asked to speak to Tony. He was allowed an extra two hours past his bedtime to stay up to talk to him, but he still felt like that hadn’t been enough. They hadn’t talked about it since, but because it was nearing that time again, Tony wondered if he should say something.
He nodded and let his head loll back, momentarily wondering if Steve could open a window to let the draft in; after a second, the hand left his arm and he was scooped up, tucked back into the hot bed and propped up on more pillows that seemed to appear out of the air.
Watching Steve carefully, Tony held his breath until the blond finally gave a real smile.
“I came to check on the Prime,” Bruce said as he entered and closed the door behind him, “How are you feeling, Steve?”
he would just go away—
“A Southerner?” The Warlord said, smiling at Tony’s surprise, “I speak many languages. It is why I patrol the borders for trespassers such as yourself. Why are you here, in the Northern Territory? Surely you know your people are at war with our own.”
“Really. I can last until we get back and get to medical, jeez,” Tony grunted, only to wheeze again as PJ finally pulled himself from the glass and crawled into Tony’s lap, “Hey, kiddo.”
“Tony,” Steve chided, squeezing his hands again, “Let me get through this, sweetheart. Okay?”
Bruce’s mouth was open for a moment, a stunned expression on his face.
“Yes, Tony bed,” Tony said with a yawn, closing his eyes.
“What was
Knowing Steve would come investigate, Tony hurried into his walk-in closet, ducking behind his Armani suits until he could feel along the wall. Finding the panel he was looking for, he placed his palm against it, swinging open a secret door to a tiny elevator.
Steve nodded, staying still as not to accidentally spook PJ. The boy still had his thumb in his mouth, idly chewing on it while he stared at Sam, Natasha, and Bucky, as if he was attempting to listen in on their conversation. After a beat, Bucky noticed, raising an eyebrow at the boy.
allowed to walk all over him and Peter. Annoyed, Tony scooted over in the bed and wriggled his way out of Steve’s arms, growling when he tried to reach for them. Tony curled his arms over Peter protectively, flushing slightly under the Alpha’s gaze.
He heard Steve whimper and he smiled, forcing himself to relax in the hopes that a calm aura would keep him sated through the procedure. Unfortunately, the cut was long, which meant that he would need at least twenty stitches, and the longer it took to stitch him the longer Steve would be at his gland.
“Tony.”
to be ashamed of.”
“Make your closest right-hand turn,” JARVIS said.
“Someone did their homework,” he said, carefully taking PJ’s thumb from his mouth to poke the sippy cup back in.
“We’re getting
going to hear the end of it,” Tony threatened, stuttering a bit when Steve added a third finger.
Turning, Tony smiled, pulling Steve with him so they could sit on the edge of PJ’s bed. He hushed the boy softly, reaching up to sift his fingers through the boy’s hair.
Sarah laughed next to Steve, who flushed and leaned down, planting a kiss on Tony’s forehead. When he pulled back, Tony frowned, pouting until Steve sighed.
More silence.
Pepper raised one perfectly shaped eyebrow at that, her other rising to match it when PJ nodded. The elevator opened back up onto his floor, so Tony patted PJ’s back, signaling to the boy to emerge. He let go of Tony’s slacks and ran off toward his room, only tripping once and catching himself before getting there.
blame both of you,” he said, pouting when the Warlords started to laugh, “This is
“Speaking of, I was surprised you even took PJ in,” Bruce commented, quickly changing the subject, “You’ve not exactly ever been the fathering type. At least, in my observation.”
“Steve, if you could pick your last meal, what would it be?” She asked quietly.
Tony peeked open an eye just in time to see Steve hobble over to the crib, carefully picking Peter up to nestle on his shoulder. He shushed the babe and rocked back and forth while rubbing slow circles on his back. There must have been witchcraft involved, for Peter’s cries dissolved into sniffles and then soft snores. The whole room seemed to let out a sigh of relief; Steve gently eased Peter down into his arms with a smile and tucked him back into his cradle. Before he could turn around, Tony closed his eye again to keep from getting caught.
“You are…. surprising,” Natasha commented, turning to him with a raised brow, “Where did you learn childcare like this?”
“He—the kid—is the only survivor. At least, that we found at this compound. By their timeline, he’s roughly a little over a year to three years old. We’re not really sure what his exact age is. They didn’t exactly celebrate birthdays in the compound,” he explained, attempting to ignore the others’ sympathetic looks, “I was going to have you look him over when we get back to the Tower.”
“Bed?” Steve repeated, the word sounding odd coming from the man.
entered Tony’s head, rooting themselves deep into his psyche where he knew that he would have nightmares just from hearing those descriptions. By the end of the multi-page ordeal, Tony had reached across the divide to clasp Steve’s hand, bracing his elbow on his knee so he could hide his face in his other hand. Steve wasn’t faring much better, his shaking shoulders betraying the emotion he was desperately trying to hide. He dropped his head, letting his tears fall and stain his pants.
He paused, eyes widening slightly at hearing PJ’s timid voice.
Once everyone had a slice of cake and a plastic cup of water or juice, they settled around the large family dining table, somehow unable to fill up all of the chairs despite their number. Tony was seated next to Scott, who, seeing that Steve hadn’t sat down yet and that there was no chair on the other side of Tony, willingly moved without either of them saying anything.
“Sorry, not for this game. You’ll be back on next week, though, don’t worry.”
“Look, man, just because it’s the Air Force doesn’t mean we’re formal and uptight,” Rhodey grunted, an easy smile resting on his face anyway.
of me, lay back down, you maniac—Tony was just going to tell me about when you two started boinking,” Rhodey explained, holding his finger out toward Tony to get him to stay down.
going to do our best to try and keep you as safe and happy as we possibly can. There might be a lot of bumps in the road, with nightmares and getting you caught up to speed with English and Maths and stuff, but we’re going to do it. You’re safe here. You don’t have to be afraid anymore,
“So you know Sam’s paramilitary?” He started, grunting when Tony nodded, “Well, he doesn’t use a parachute. Turns out he flies with mechanical wings, like a fucking bird. He zooms around the air in a winged backpack invented by the
“Kind of, yeah,” Tony admitted with a hum, “And you woke the kid.”
He looked up at Steve, relieved to see that the man had finally started to come back, his eyes focused and present. Steve offered a small smile to Tony, gently moving PJ so he could press his lips against Tony’s with a relieved sigh. Once again upset at being left out, PJ pressed his face up against Steve and Tony’s, making the adults laugh and pull apart.
Tony threw on his clothes and leaned against the counter, rubbing the bridge of his nose as he thought. He wanted to launch into another tirade, but even thinking about it gave him a headache. It frustrated him to no end that the Alpha was acting like a caveman. He turned to say this, only to find Steve staring at the water with a flushed face, eyes glassy and lips trembling. All of that anger immediately turned into guilt, and by
Tony crouched down to PJ’s level, putting his hand out. The boy easily stuck his out to rest in Tony’s palm, giving him a quizzical look.
funny. You’re hurt, sweetheart, and I don’t want you to get hurt worse because you want to fool around,” Steve tried to scold, already feeling his resolve buckle under Tony’s pleading look, “Tony—I’m
Putting on his best puppy dog eyes, Tony let his lower lip jut out slightly and tilted his head down, blinking his long eyelashes at Bruce.
Steve looked up with an odd emotion plastered across his face, like something between guilt and constipation. Tony merely raised an eyebrow, patiently waiting for the Captain to reply.
Tony giggled and peeked over Bruce’s shoulder at Steve, biting back a full-on laugh at Steve’s sheepish look.
“Okay. We can stay here for a little longer,” Steve acquiesced, “But once Peter is full, we go. Deal?”

“Oh,” he said miserably, sinking back into the pillows of the hospital bed, “When?”
“What’s
Tony raised an eyebrow at Steve’s smile, rolling his eyes despite his gratefulness for the change in topic.
“…Tony.
above average,” Bruce continued, leaning back from the microscope to scrub his eyes, “But also, we don’t know how the serum will continue to react. For all we know, as he gets older, the serum could naturally divide more than the regular white blood cells and he could develop full super-serum abilities. I don’t really know—it’s just a guess.”
did you give Peter and me a scare.”
“Sam Adams.”
was interesting. He did not know much about bonds beyond basic knowledge, as Howard had not thought it relevant to his curriculum. Sure, Rhodey and Pepper had gossiped about bonding before, but Tony would have remembered if
“What if it doesn’t? What if I’m gonna be like this?” Steve blurted out, “I mean, with all my stuff, maybe—”
Tony spared him a glance, then stared down at the sheets covering his legs.
The Warlords are called out on a mission, leaving Tony and Bruce to find companionship in each other.
“JARVIS, stop, take me to the main lounge,” he called out sourly, shoving his hands in his pockets.
Tony closed his eyes, so he didn’t have to see Steve getting choked up.
, Tony thought, but he nodded anyway.
He let himself be guided back to his quarters and mindlessly placed Peter in his crib, allowing Tony to take his hand and guide him to bed. They would wake later to eat, but for now, all he wanted to do was hold his Omega in his arms. Clothes were forgotten onto the floor as they curled up together, Tony with his face buried in Steve’s chest and Steve’s chin resting on top of his head. Uncertainty fizzled between them through the bond, bringing only one question to the forefront of their minds:
“Hey Tony?” Steve asked as he settled onto his cot, turning to face Tony, “You’s really swell. I liked playing with you today.”
Tony grunted at that, but didn’t
to walk away. For once, Tony was being the adult and owning up to the situation at hand. Yet, PJ was still screaming and crying across the kitchen, moving away each time Tony tried to get closer. At a standstill, he sat down fully against the bottom cabinets, letting PJ cry to himself as he huddled against the fridge.
Steve had no reaction to him, save for a small sigh. He stood up and stretched—to which Tony found himself unable to look away—and shuffled to his closet, blindly grabbing clothes to toss onto the bed. He then picked out a second outfit for himself and tiredly trudged to the bathroom, quietly shutting the door behind him.
“You think I would leave you to fuck Rhodey. I think that to keep things equal, I should believe that
like you. I promise. He knows your smell and almost immediately calms down when I give him pieces of your clothes. However, if you feel like you need something to work on, perhaps you could voice your feelings earlier instead of pushing them through the bond? He can feel that, you know.”
“Thank you,” he murmured, “For not killing him.”
“Ms. Potts said you wanted to see me?” He said in a clipped tone, keeping his chin held high.
“I’ve saved this since you arrived, Sir,” he explained, offering a gentle smile to him, “I was saving it to give to you upon your graduation, but I think it may serve you better now than then. Perhaps it can give you the answers you are looking for.”
“Alright. You do that. That means all three of you, plus Vis, Nat, and Sam are on Team Alpha,” Tony said, pouring himself a cup and holding it between his hands, “I’m here, for sure, with Bruce. I’d like Wanda here, too. I know splitting her from Vis is hard, but we could use the manpower.”
“Better than nothing.”
“You’re okay. It’ll only take a few seconds,” he said gently.
word you could have used, what era is this, the nineteen sixties? We are
He slid his eyes over to guiltily look at Tony, quickly shoving his pack into his locker and pulling out his books for first period.
Feeling a strong domestic urge tug at his heart, Tony kissed the palm of his hand and held it down to PJ, nearly fainting as the boy did the same and put his palm on top of Tony’s hand.
Once the elevator doors were shut and Tony knew they were secure, he let out a sigh of relief, feeling his shoulders sag from the tension leaving them. He turned to his left slightly, nodding over his right shoulder.
Tony laughed and leaned in to kiss him. The Prime eagerly returned his affection, content to lazily swap kisses as they dried in the sun. They laid together for the better part of the afternoon, and they only bothered to move once the chill of the quickly setting sun began to set into their bones. It took a great deal of effort to re-dress, but soon they were on their way back to town with only one noticeable limp between them. Once they reached the market people began to stare, some with knowing looks and some with interest. Tony ignored them for the most part and finally got Steve back into the castle, giggling at his mate’s quiet groans.
Tony squirmed at that and stepped closer to Steve, letting him put a hand on his hip. He offered a sheepish smile, and after a second, realization smacked into Rhodey’s face and he gasped.
“Fine. But only if you tell him he’s not allowed to yell at me,” Tony grunted, folding his arms over his chest, “I don’t need to be in medical, anyway.”
Steve hissed again, then mumbled a whine of embarrassment when more liquid leaked out, dripping down his chest.
With the invitation, the child easily scrambled up into Tony’s lap, snuggling up against his chest to be next to the arc reactor. He put his little hand up to rest on the glass covering, accidentally leaving sticky residue from the jelly that had gotten on his fingers. Tony grimaced, but didn’t comment, deciding to just make sure PJ’s hands were washed before he was allowed in laps.
Steve shushed him again and kissed him gently, closing his eyes to concentrate. He tried to think calm thoughts, hoping that his scent would calm the poor Omega; the minutes ticked by, but eventually Tony began to relax, leaning heavily onto Steve’s chest.
“Taking Matters into His Own Hands.”
He reached up to touch the mark on Tony’s neck, sending electric shivers down the Omega’s spine.
“Nothing. I’m just asking if everything’s alright.”
“Malnourished, which is to be expected. But, remember, if he is Steve’s, it’s possible he has Steve’s original body type,” Bruce answered, pulling the table full of phlebotomy equipment next to PJ’s exam bed, “Let’s do his draw now so I can take a look at it. That’ll also give us better judgment on what to look for. It’s possible that, if he doesn’t have the serum and still has pieces of Steve’s genetic code, he could develop all of Steve’s old ailments.”
“There, there,” he soothed, resting his chin on Steve’s shoulder, “It will get better soon. Once Rhodey is back to normal, we can all sit down like regular adults and talk.”
“Alright? Better?” He asked.
“Nothing. I’m just…very glad to see you happy, Tony,” She answered quietly.
“Wow,” he whispered aloud once they walked in, keeping a hand on Peter’s head so the baby would not look up at the bright embers, “It--It is
PJ managed a nod, his eyes fluttering shut as he turned his head to nose at Tony’s palm. He shushed him again and moved his hand back into PJ’s hair, gently scratching his scalp to try and help him sleep. Slowly but surely, the boy drifted off, his even breaths a relief to both men. Standing from the bed, Tony beckoned to Steve, closing the door to a crack once they both were out of the room.
“That’s what I’m afraid of,” Tony replied guiltily, putting his hand on top of Steve’s on PJ’s back, “I don’t want—I don’t want him to suffer any, but I also know it’ll help us understand HYDRA’s intentions better if we have more information.”
Steve rolled his eyes, shaking his head.
,” Tony interrupted again, yanking on his pants, “You have to help me out here, I--”
“It has been a rough day, hm?” He murmured, stroking the back of Steve’s neck, “You should rest. I cannot imagine how exhausted you must be.”
though.”
“Now, now, that is not tasty, Peter,” Tony said softly, gently removing the baby’s hand from its mouth, “I bet you’ve been ready to feed for a while, yeah?”
Discouraged, Tony stood up and did as he was told, staring at his shoes the whole time. Sliding into the seat Steve had stuck him in earlier, he figured he was going to sit by himself, only to be surprised as Steve slid into the seat next to him.
“Kisses for my lovely wife. I hear my own Pop call Ma that all the time,” Steve said smugly, poking Tony’s cheek where he’d just kissed him.
“I don’t want Captain Cranky coming after me,” Scott teased, high-fiving Clint as he sat down next to him instead.
Unbeta'd. Comments and kudos are really appreciated. Ask me questions over @avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
“Okay, I will stay. Can—can we get on with the meeting?” Tony said, pulling back from Steve’s embrace.
“We are not sure why or how, but Pete imprinted onto me in a way that created a… uh, like a bond. He can sense how I feel, so I have to be careful to not get too upset or the poor thing will cry. I do not know how large the distance could be, though. Perhaps he is just a sensitive baby.”
“If you are going to spend our walk being pissy, just know I am not falling for that trap of an argument. I am going to enjoy the outdoors, and you can decide if you want to enjoy it with me,” He said as he tied it around his neck, snuggling into its warmth.
with Rhodey…
“Peggy asked about you a lot. I’ve got all our pictures up still, y’know. She asked about them and why you weren’t around and…and I guess I was just so taken with her and everything that I never—I didn’t—”
“Hey. None of that. It is
“What? What’s wrong?” Tony asked, the glance not going unnoticed, “Steve’s a good guy.”
“Couldn’t they just send in the Chair Force?” Steve said, earning a laugh from his best friend, “Alright, let’s go do some rescue. Jeeps ready?”
PJ shook his head, wiggling himself back against Tony’s chest. His eyes bugged from the pressure on his ribs, but he managed to not shout, breathing heavily through his nose as an alternative.
cry—"
It quickly dissipated as Tony hitched in his sleep, his brows furrowing and lips quivering in response to whatever kind of dream he was having. Steve quickly shushed him and rubbed his thumb at the worried crease, leaning forward to kiss the curve of his jaw until Tony settled again.
Tony couldn’t help but giggle at that, turning to press his lips against Steve’s forehead as a silent thank-you. He closed his eyes against the swell of emotion that knotted up in his throat, but his body betrayed him and let the tears fall, turning into wracking sobs that made him feel raw and exposed. The arms around him became impossibly tight and it took all of his strength to keep from outright wailing.
“Please don’t tell me this is a serum thing, then,” Bucky said mournfully, “Am I gonna start too?”
“How’s he holding up?” She asked, nodding at the elephant.
Looking up, Tony grinned, watching Natasha pad into the room in her pajamas and sit down on the bed next to him.
“He does not want money, Tony. Rather, he wants
the covers, you are a little monster—”
“And? I get nightmares,” Steve said, sliding his gaze over to the archer, “Tony’s reactor helps with them. Plus, his bed is self-heating.”
“You tried to leave,” Bucky answered, shrugging.
The Prime Alpha carefully shuffled in and closed the door, kicking off his shoes and garments until he was down to his trousers. Then, he crawled in under the warm furs, hesitating to put an arm around Tony.
“Steve. Quit.”
“T’Challa, Shuri, and the Dora Milaje are headed back to Wakanda for repairs,” Natasha offered from the cockpit, her red ringlets bouncing when she turned her head, “Thor headed to Asgard to check in with Odin and Heimdall. He may be bringing back mead for us, considering we took a pretty bad hit.”
The name didn’t make much sense to him, but the date made his core run cold. December of 1991 was a familiar date to him, one that Tony rarely talked about, and one that he never pushed on. The event happened late in the month, so this must have come right after. Steve glanced down at Tony, but the man didn’t grab the book or try to stop him, but he did seem a little tense, so he carefully opened it, flipping to the first page with words. There it was, Tony’s familiar scrawl, but it was all wrong; his loops were shaky and his lines disjointed.
“Your plan was a flying suit?”
“Yeah, you talk enough in class that they decided to give you a silent role,” Bucky joked, earning a high-five from Sam.
not to Steve. That being, he was the one who had designed the team expedition, and Steve had warned him about going to the Savage Land without the proper provisions, but he’d waved it off and said he’d ‘take care of it.’ Steve, his now-boyfriend of maybe a month had rolled his eyes and pressed a kiss to his forehead before wheedling at him to go to bed.
He pouted and rubbed his arm, glaring at Bucky, who merely smirked.
“I know, I know. Believe me, I’ve had—I’ve thought about it. I tried to ask the others how you were since you pretty much ran away every time I tried to talk to you,” Steve continued quickly, “Nat and Bruce were tight-lipped, and none of the others knew anything other than you were taking courses. I really—I thought you didn’t want to hear from me anymore. I thought that space would help, but—”
to pick up the box of notebooks as well.
“That,” Steve said, drawing Tony out of his thoughts, “Is my seat.”
“You are the worst best friend I’ve ever had,” Tony said, grunting as Rhodey laughed again, “I’m
At the thought of Steve, Tony sat up straight as he realized their conversation had never finished. However, the movement caused more pain to tear into him and it surprised him enough that he gasped out loud, clapping a hand over his mouth to stifle the noise. He feared that the guards had heard him, but as silent seconds ticked by, Tony relaxed, only to have the iron door swing open and bang loudly against the concrete wall. The noise caused him to scream, the sound dying in his throat as a small figure was shoved into the room and the door was yanked shut with another bang.
Tony blushed but rapidly shook his head, pouting at Bucky’s laugh. This year, a few new girls joined their class and he had become fast friends with Virginia Potts, who he started calling ‘Pepper’ because of her no-nonsense attitude. However, whenever a boy started to be friends with a girl, rumors started to swirl. Which made Tony mad.
“Better than Howard’s magazines?”
“Omega pheromones help block pain receptors, but do not get too bitey while you are there.”
,” Tony said, using one finger to inch the plate back again, “
“Well, you were—”
PJ looked at his feet and Tony glanced over his shoulder, giving the girl a suspicious look.
“What? What happened? He was
“Thanks, guys,” he said to the doctors as they packed up and left, one of them advising he stay in bed for at least one day before going back up, “Yep, got it. Thanks.”
That last statement surprised Tony the most, making him crease his brows in confusion.
Standing upright, Tony stretched slightly, offering his palm to PJ again.
The Prime tilted his head and glanced over at Thor, then asked a question. His voice was sweet but rough, as if he had been woken up for this meeting. He and Thor exchanged a few gruff sentences, then Thor turned to Tony.
“The time is currently seven past five A.M., Sir,” JARVIS said.
He could only hope that his calculations were right.
“…What?” He croaked.
Looking up from taking a bite, he blinked up at Steve, noticing that he was oddly nervous.
Peter did not answer, but the baby seemed to understand and settled down, allowing Tony to don his knapsack and wineskin as he ducked out of their hiding spot. He wrapped his arms around the baby and started into the rain, walking for another few hours before a small sound drew his attention. He continued to move, but he changed directions every few minutes, listening for the sound again. An hour passed without incident, so he let himself relax, smiling as he finally exited the other side of the forest. The clearing was not large, and the sun felt good on his face, so Tony paused, looking up into the sky. He let out a deep sigh of relief, closing his eyes and letting the warm rays melt over his skin. However, once he began to move again, a cold, sharp object was pressed into the back of his neck. A chill swept through his body and his Omega nature took over; he pivoted on his heel, crouching over slightly as he faced the person behind him. It was a woman, a little taller than himself, holding an elongated spear out so its tip was pointed at his throat. His senses started going haywire and he pivoted again, finding himself completely surrounded by similarly-dressed men and women, all holding spears to his neck.
“Clint, do not be so dramatic. Natasha is all three of those by herself,” Bruce said.
“I wish I could show you how the others look at you. Perhaps you are so used to a lingering gaze that it does not bother you anymore, but it bothers me plenty.”
“Not yet. We will. At some point.”
“You are already so tight around my fingers… I bet you will feel just as good around my prick, no? I want to fuck you open until you are loose and sloppy and feel empty without me inside you. One day I will have you like this in our bed, where I can tie you to the bedposts and fuck you whenever I please, like a good little Omega, hm?”
Tony bit his lip nervously, laying his head on Steve’s arm.
Tony only laughed as he and Natasha ducked back out of the room, following the right-hand wall deeper into the maze of the HYDRA complex. Together, they crept as silently as they could with Tony leading, repulsors lighting their way.
people, honey. Plus, we can still talk, I’ll have a satellite phone and you won’t even be thinking about me while you’re off making the world a better place at MIT.”
, with me—”
of you to safety,” the Warlord said, nodding to direct Tony to follow him, “Out here—the forest is not always protected. Anyone could have gotten to you both when you are this far removed from the colony. If you were willing to take that risk, I have no doubt that your need is mighty. I will make sure our Prime Alpha sees you as soon as we reach the city.”
“You know I slept the day away again—I need to eat,” he said sheepishly.
PJ tilted his head before nodding, then looked back over his shoulder at Steve and pointed.
Steve blinked, then laughed, turning Tony around to pull their bodies flush together so he could kiss him better. He pecked soft butterfly kisses all over Tony’s face before landing on his lips, languidly drawing out the affection.
He’d nearly clocked the therapist for that one, but Steve had dragged him into his lap and held him tight, shushing him softly and telling him an assault charge wasn’t going to help anything. It took him a few minutes to settle down after that, but he’d stayed perched on Steve’s lap, arms laid over top of those wrapped around his waist. The contact was warm and comforting and it didn’t take long for their therapy sessions to move from sitting on each other to cuddling on the couch. If he thought about it, Tony knew they’d always been like that; whenever Steve was close, they were touching, almost desperate to feel each other underneath their fingertips.
“We cannot stop. We need to push on until we get to Pepper,” Clint countered, “If he faints, we can tie him to Bruce.”
“Now, now. Thor means you no harm, small one, see? Nothing to fuss over,” he tried, moving Peter down from his shoulder to the crook of his arm, “Shh, sweetheart—I bet you are just hungry, yeah? A little milk will—”
“I’m including Dummy.”
“You’re going to straight to medical when we get back.”
“Okay, darling. Have fun, and
He cooed over the baby as he dressed himself, only to pause when he went to reach for his shirt and realized that one was not there. He sighed and stared down at his leather pants then looked at Peter, noting that the baby did not seem to care about his plight.
“Where’s Mom?”
“Home. Now. We haven’t had a good I’m-glad-you’re-alive fuck in
“Leave! God, go have your walk, I do not want to have any more of these images assault my mind,” he complained, “And in front of your son!”
“No, Tony, you were only standing up for yourself,” Bruce soothed, “It is a natural reaction. I am sure Steve understands and will help you have a relaxing evening to wash off this accident.”
“I am sorry for dinner,” Steve whispered, unable to look Tony in the eyes, “I know you told me to behave, but--I do not know what got into me. I usually have such control over my nature, and yet one small act of possession flipped something in me. I do not think I could have stopped, even if I tried.”
“We need a marriage certificate
Blinking slowly, Tony watched the nurse leave, listening to the sound of PJ’s screaming dwindle as the pounding of footsteps came up the hallway. It didn’t take long for the child to appear in the doorway, his face blotchy and eyes rimmed red from crying. He scrambled over to the bed, sniffling as he tried to climb up.

want to be knotted when the baby starts to cry?”
Tony squeezed Steve’s hands, trying to give him a comforting look. PJ shifted on the bed, so they stayed quiet for a moment, waiting for the boy’s soft snoring to pick back up.
her over me. You thought with your dick.”
With that smile cast on him and him alone, Tony was unable to help his own shy smile, picking up the drawing and holding it to his chest.
“Thank you,” he whispered, shyly ducking his head.
He took a second breath, making sure he and the babe were buckled before starting.
Steve hummed and nodded, his short mohawk falling forward onto his forehead as he ducked his head to eat. Pleased that the subject had been dropped, Tony attempted to finish his meal while prying Peter’s free hand off of his spoon every time it came near him.
lately but for no real reason.”
“Bartering doesn’t work with senior citizens. Unless you’d like me to move your housing to a swingers’ community?”
Of course, once the electronic drawing pad arrived, Steve couldn’t help but grin as he tackled his next art project, determined to best the Stark again.
“It really isn’t.”
Tony laughed, sniffling as Rhodey reached up to wipe the last of his tears from his face.
“Hush,” she soothed, reaching up to cup his face, “It’s okay. I finally get a child to spoil that I can leave with his parents when he decides to be a brat.”
Heat flushed his face and Tony snapped his eyes over to Rhodey, who was intently watching them while listening to Thor translate. His eyes widened and then dropped to slits as he smirked, clearly enjoying Tony’s embarrassment.
Standing up, he watched PJ run back to Steve, the elephant’s big ears flopping as he skidded to a stop at Steve’s feet. Tony walked over, shouldering the overnight bag as PJ stared expectantly at Steve.
“What? It’s okay if you haven’t dropped yet,” Tony whispered, wanting to reach out and pat Steve’s shoulder, “I’m just really early. It’ll happen eventually, I promise.”
“It’s not a third testicle, you bitch,” he grunted, making Steve giggle as he pushed the box over, “Here. I’m going down to the shop for a bit before bed, alright? I’ll see you in a bit.”
“If I were him, I wouldn’t either. I’ve known that brat since he was in diapers and he’s always been stuck to Steve’s side, whether it be in class or on the playground. We used to call them Mom and Dad, it was so bad.”
“Yes, Sir?”
“What, Steve?” He muttered, “What do you want from me?”
Thankfully, it had not caused any rift between him and the Alpha. Steve was quite aware of his tendency to cave into Peter and Tony could not blame him; the boy was damn cute. Every day Peter looked more and more like him but with Mary’s round face and dimpled cheeks. It brought a twinge to his heart each time he thought of his late friend, so he kept that feeling tucked away from the bond, hoping and praying to the gods that Peter never felt his father’s guilt.
“PJ? Hey, hey baby, wake up, it’s okay, you’re having a bad dream,” Tony coaxed, sliding them both down onto the floor in case the boy had an attack, “Honey? C’mon, you can wake up, I got you, it’s okay—”
“Any minute,” Nat answered, now seated on the windowsill, “Why don’t you give him to Steve? He produces a lot of body heat. He can keep the kid warm until the Avengejet gets here.”
option to keep that baby alive and free and you
Glad for the distraction, Tony walked out, trying to calm the thousands of thoughts knocking in his brain.
Steve tried to bite back his smile as Tony babbled on, shifting himself down in his chair to make himself more comfortable. He couldn’t help the swell of affection that filled every nook and cranny in his chest, wanting so desperately to be home already just so he could hold them.
“Maybe I will take a nap myself,” Tony admitted, petting Peter’s fine hairs, “All of this excitement has worn me out.”
If anything could put the fear of the Gods into him, it was that statement. Heat? He could not possibly be going into heat. He took suppressants daily! Hell, he even brought extra from the kingdom--
“Peter, thank you?” Steve asked, leaning over to look at the baby, “Peter, Tony?”
, but Mr. Rabbit was comfy, and nice to hug.
part of the discussion for today. We won’t discuss the parts of the male and female genitalia until next week. Today’s discussion is an introduction to how bodies develop through adolescence.”
Steve shook his head, leaning down to kiss the Omega as he moved his hands away. Tony almost immediately began to whine into Steve’s mouth, grabbing at his thighs to dig in his nails and show his displeasure.
“No, no, it’s fine,” Steve groused, slapping at Tony’s wandering hands, “Really, it’s okay—
Realizing Steve had reached over to carefully play with the lock of blond hair in PJ’s curls, Tony swallowed the lump in his throat, trying to determine whether or not his hesitation was from guilt or self-loathing.
“I’ll be fine!” Tony shouted back, rolling his eyes.
Tony managed a nod and settled back down onto the bed, steadfastly ignoring the emotional tears that rolled down his cheeks as he let his eyes slip shut. Steve watched him for the better part of an hour, waiting until he was sure his husband was asleep before standing and heading for the door. Peeking out, he motioned to one of the nurses nearby and quietly asked her to bring both Bucky and Rhodey back. Once she was on her way, Steve quickly returned to Tony’s side, carefully picking his hand back up.
. I also know it’s possible. I’m just saying—”
“And me?” Clint asked, raising his hand.
The elevator opened to the common lounge, where Avengers new and old had gathered. Even Pepper had come down, her delicate form perched on the edge of the long couch as she laughed at one of Sam’s terrible jokes. They all seemed to be lost in conversation, but once Tony and Bruce approached, the noise died down to suffocating silence, all eyes on them and the bundle in Tony’s arms. Out of the corner of his eye, Tony saw Steve shift, and he nearly turned to bolt, but a familiar hand rested on his arm to keep him from moving.
They clasped hands and parted, but Tony skidded to a stop and started to run back toward his room. He could hear them shouting at him, but he only needed one thing--thankfully, their quarters had not been infiltrated yet, so he grabbed the item and some other necessities. Clint looked murderous when he met them halfway, but Rhodey stilled him before he could chastise him.
“Aw, geez, Cap, no need to kill me here,” Tony grumbled, swiping his tool back up to keep working, “Jay said you…weren’t a fan of the shower. So, I’m fixing it.”
“Tony!”
“Well, I talked to the nurses. Rumor is it the doctors will give you the all clear soon. I may have told them that we signed you up for therapy in the States already and that we need to get you home,” he said, smiling when Tony perked up, “Pepper will meet us when we land with fast food and the limo to take you all back to the Tower.”
Tony bit his lip, eyeing her carefully as she stared into her cup.
He reached his hand into the water, feeling his own heartbeat quicken as the water dampened his skin. With a heavy swallow, Tony stepped under the shower and worked himself over with the tiny shampoo bottle and soap first, focusing on his feet to try and keep from panicking any more than he already was. Stepping out from the spray, he sighed, thankful that he at least felt a bit cleaner.
“Yes, of course. No worries. I will try to remember,” Bruce interrupted, adjusting his spectacles with a nod, “I will go make a batch of medicine for you to take and I will pass along your dietary treatment to Thor. I already informed the Prime, so he knows how to care for you. I hope you feel better, Tony.”
“I do not know how she died,” He said in a very small, scared voice, “But Pepper smelled so strongly of blood that I cannot help but assume she hemorrhaged. If we had been able to go to a doctor, she might still be alive, but--”
Looking up from tucking PJ in, Tony quirked an eyebrow, then nodded.
“We just finished making the bed and he started jumping on it, then laid down and just passed out for no reason,” Tony explained in one breath, hovering over Bruce’s shoulder as worry built up in his gut, “He wouldn’t wake up when I shook him—”
Unable to say no, Steve nodded, but he took his hand off the reactor, gathering both of Tony’s in his own.
“That….is a big house,” Scott observed, looking fairly green, “You can’t get lost in there, right?”
Natasha nodded in agreement, helping PJ off the couch now that introductions had been made.
Left with the mess to clean up, Tony put his hands on his hips, shaking his head fondly. It was a good sign that the child was acting so positive and like a
Bruce sighed, waving the light over the eye to check dilation before letting the eyelids close. He turned to Tony, watching the brunet pace around the room.
“You’re fucking kidding me,” Bucky wheezed, cackling in his chair, “Oh my
The Warlords all looked at Natasha, who shrugged.
“But you liked it enough to do it again.”
“Oh, god,” he said weakly, smoothing a thumb over the trail, “Okay, I can—I can deal, this is fine—”
“He says he is sorry he attacked you,” he tried, only to be cut off by Rhodey’s laugh.
“What about Pietro?” Clint suggested quietly, looking up from his quiver, “He—”
“Do you wanna play with me?” Steve asked, turning back to Tony, “Bucky’s playin’ with Sam, and I don’t wanna draw alone. Plus, we can share cubbies!”
Tony waved at them as they headed off, reaching up to place a hand on Steve’s hand curled around the handle of his chair.
“That is
“Aw, dude,” Clint grumbled, wincing as he stepped further into the room, “Come

. I will get Peter arranged with Bruce, okay?”
“Hot,” he whispered, “Thor, help—”
and cried out in pain, tears springing to his eyes.
“Let me. I can dress your wounds,” Tony said softly.
“Their cocks will feel like fingers compared to mine,” Steve interrupted, moving the arm that was holding Tony down to abruptly shove two fingers into him, “It is a good thing you get wet so easily... I am not sure there is enough oil in the world to slick you up enough to be ready for me.”
“See? Not going to hurt you, I promise,” He said, sitting back on his haunches, “I’m just concerned. We rescued you from a pretty bad place and we want to make sure you’re okay. Now we don’t really think you’ll actually
“Every time I look at you, my heart feels so much lighter,” Steve sighed fondly, unaware that Tony could understand him, “You are such a treasure to come home to, little rabbit. You and Peter.”
“I know, love. The noise is something awful, yeah?” He murmured, giving Pete his finger to hold onto, “Do not worry, Papa will make it better for you. Then we can all sit and ea--”
, so desperately and so deeply that the others had started to make comments about his thick scent.
They all looked wrecked.
He shook his head and took a swig, then handed it back. Suddenly, he felt more tired than he had been before. Sleep called to him, but Peter’s whining was much louder and demanded his attention. The poor thing had to be hungry and scared, and he had no real way to explain to the tot what was happening.
“No. I want to tell you now while I’m pumped full of the good stuff. You know I’ll just weenie out later,” Tony said weakly, “Let me? Please?”
“Yes, but
“Hey, wait, where’d Steve go?” Clint piped up.
“Fine. But I will be watching his every movement,” he said firmly, an Alpha growl leaking into his tone.
“She said we’re comparing penis sizes.”
He took a moment to collect himself, heaving against the wall as the pains in his chest subsided to a persistent throb. Thunking his head back against the concrete, Tony groaned quietly and opened his eyes, allowing himself point-five seconds of self-pity before forcing himself to his feet again. Walking around the room, he counted his sluggish steps, mentally constructing a blueprint of the room in case he would need it. Once he was assured in his calculations, he finally went back to the beds, allowing himself to lay down on a mattress.
He invested in theatre-grade makeup. It was thick and easily covered the signs of abuse, even allowing him to stop asking Natasha for help. Secretly, he felt guilty when he told her he didn’t need the makeup anymore, as she smiled and squeezed his shoulder. He didn’t deserve the affection, not when he knew what he was doing to himself, but he couldn’t find it within him to care that much. After that, he distanced himself from the others, not wanting to accidentally out the situation he was in. He blamed his lack of time to hang out on college work—it wasn’t false, he did have a lot of homework to do, but he usually had it done within an hour. Even his college friend, Rhodey, asked him why he was spending less time at the college lab.
He grit his teeth at the thought and planted his forehead against Bruce’s back. Sweat rolled down his back, uncomfortably plastering his shirt to his skin. Peter whimpered and he shushed him, closing his eyes against the headache that was beginning to form.
“Yeah. I guess. If that counts,” he mumbled, “After I—after that was finished, I pretty much went and told Rhodey right away. Not that he didn’t know, considering I went out with both men and women when we roomed together, but yes. You—Cap—is the first person I formally said that I was interested in all sexes to.”
“Not quite,” Steve admitted, standing up from the floor as he eyed the child’s red, white and blue pajamas, “Now, I heard you say I’m supposed to read a bedtime story?”
Before he could sink into anymore self-loathing, Bucky popped back in, waving his satellite phone.
“...Yes?” He asked, annoyed.
Glaring over at Clint’s shit-eating grin, Tony merely turned his gaze to Steve, sighing as he realized the situation he was about to put himself in.
“Ready to eat?” Steve whispered, putting their foreheads together.
“Jesus, I’m too old,” He grunted, shaking his head.
“Yet you do not contradict me when I say I took advantage of you,” Steve said quietly, “Did I?”
“Can you make sure Ste—that the Prime stays away? Tell him I can spread the sickness or whatever you can think of. I have barely been here a day and that man has already pushed me into doing… things… I had
“You should have said something.”
“What I
,” Tony whined, grinding his half-hard cock up against Steve’s abdomen.
“Could we get a blanket? Kid’s practically shivering and it’ll help keep us warm,” Tony asked, bouncing PJ in his arms.

you, Tony, I need you like air in my lungs and feeling you go limp was just—”
The words echoed in Tony’s mind for the millionth time, hurting just as deeply as they did the first time he realized it was a lie. He was sprawled out on top of his high school’s main auditorium building, a nearly empty bag of weed next to him as he blew smoke circles into the sky from his latest joint. The marijuana helped ease the pain and aches from the fresh bruising that had been laid on top of the fading, yellowing marks, but there was no hope for it keeping up with his stream of consciousness. Combining that with the fact that it was the first day of his Junior year and that he’d already skipped two classes just to smoke, Tony had no problem closing his eyes and letting himself sink into the flashbacks of the shitshow that had been Sophomore year.
“No, I banged myself up in my cell. He did not get to me to hurt me, you know that. You were there,” Rhodey soothed, pulling up his sleeve to show Tony the mottled bruising on his upper arm, “Really, Tones. He is quite… impressive. You sure have him wrapped around your finger.”

“I...I guess I can try.”
“Hey, I don’t like to
to be unwrapped.”
“He looks like his mother.”
“Oh, goodie. Lumberjacking,” Sam sighed, following Tony to the forest, “So how the hell are we supposed to chop down a tree? We can’t exactly use Bucky’s arm like an ax.”
“Yes, you idiot, we all—fuck, Tony. You are not invincible, as much as you might think—”

“Hey, Tony?” Steve asked softly.
. At that moment, he silently vowed to keep Tony as safe as he could and knew his own Papa would be proud that he crossed his fingers when he promised so he could go home and tell Momma about everything without feeling guilty.
Tony bit his lip, nodding. He turned to offer Rhodey a thankful smile, reaching up to pat his hand.
PJ flicked his gaze over to Steve for a second before ducking his head back into Tony’s side, causing him to giggle.
Natasha turned last to Tony, who was busy using his phone as a screen to work on updating the suit.
Of course, that night when nearly his entire
“JARVIS told us to take a car from the garage,” Steve explained as he shrugged into the clothing and strapped the shield to his back, “It’s a, uh, black car. Sleek. Mustang, I think.”
Shame washed over him and he turned around, intent on scurrying out of the room to hide somewhere else. He was used to causing Alphas to snap, but feeling such anger and despair from a fellow Omega broke his heart in a way that it never had before. If he had felt it, he was sure that Peter had also felt it and was screaming because of it. He got one foot out of the door when an arm came around his shoulders and turned him back in, carefully pulling him into a familiar chest.
Steve’s only acknowledgment was a sharp exhale through his nose. Tony ignored it and took his hand to pull him into the bathroom, pretending as though he could not feel how heavy their bond was with his mate’s guilt. He left Steve standing by the counter so he could grab the medical supplies he needed to re-disinfect and rebandage the wound.
Bruce laughed and clapped his hands, shaking his head fondly.
“Yes,” he said, flicking worried eyes over to the Prime, “Yes, I’ll—I’ll become his Omega.
Steve jumped back and Tony laughed at the other’s embarrassment at being caught, unsuccessfully stifling his giggles into his arm. Unimpressed, Bucky, Clint, and Natasha walked in, the former cuffing Steve on the back of the head.
“Yes,” Steve answered immediately, “All of them. You trusted me with them, so I’m going to read each and every word in them.”
“Hey there, happy boy. Are you doing okay?” Tony asked softly.
He shifted a bit so he could nestle his head to the side, allowing him to see Peter’s face. The babe was fast asleep, most likely exhausted by all the commotion. Content, Tony let his own eyes drift shut, only to open them seconds later when two faint knocks sounded at the door. He looked up to see the door silently creak open and a familiar head poked in, showing only Steve’s hair and his worried eyes. Tony barely made eye contact and the Prime’s gaze dropped to the floor; he shuffled in without looking up, scooting over to his bed to grab the tray Thor had brought in earlier. Tony waited for some sort of acknowledgment, but Steve remained silent and submissive in his body language, quickly exiting the room and closing the door again.
“Hello, my little love. Did you miss me? Hm? Did you have fun while I was away?”
“Hi there,” Tony soothed, “Are you feeling any b—”
Steve’s brows shot up to his hairline before he backed off with a sheepish grin, putting a hand on the back of his neck.
Tony nodded and felt heat gather in his cheeks, so he quickly ushered Bruce out with the baby and closed the door behind him. Finally able to get a breath into himself, Tony kicked off his shoes and peeled off his shirt and bra, collapsing belly-down onto the bed with a sigh. The day’s emotions exhausted him, and all he wanted to do was curl up with Steve, but thinking about the Prime only turned his stomach.
“Hey! Nice work, baby,” Steve cooed, pulling Tony over by the zipper to get a better angle for kissing the side of his lips, “See? I told you that you were getting much better. You’ll be back to welding in no time.”
“It’s a lot, huh?” He said quietly, flicking his glance back and forth between PJ’s eyes, “I know it’s a lot. I’m—ah,
,” he whined, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder, “Do we have to watch that one?”
Rhodey bit his lip, but he relented, sighing and nodding as he withdrew his arm.
son,” he continued quietly, tightening his grip on Tony’s hand, “I wish I could tear his throat out, but making sure he doesn’t hurt anyone else will have to do.”
Tony watched as Steve waited patiently, wary of the other boy as he opened up his backpack and took out a book, clutching it to his chest. With a nod, Steve led Tony over to one of the tables, making sure he was seated okay before sitting down himself and spreading out his art supplies. Tony tried to open up his book and keep reading about Geronimo Stilton, but the gentle scratching of Steve’s pencil on paper kept him distracted. Mesmerized, Tony watched as Steve sketched out, inked, and colored a big, red robot, giving it yellow accents and big, blue eyes. Eventually, Steve looked up and caught Tony staring; he blushed at being caught, mumbled an apology and looked away.
“Clearly, I was kidding, but he took it seriously and left. Bruce got mad that I made Steve upset, so
“Should I carry you as well?” Steve asked, a completely serious look on his face, “You’re clearly in pain, Tony.”
“Be careful. You saw how I held him earlier, keep his--yes, like that. He just had a small episode, but hopefully, he will fall back asleep for you and not give you too much fuss,” Tony ticked off, “The Prime wishes for me to accompany him on a walk, so you do not mind watching Peter for a bit, do you? He has already been fed, and Bruce can fetch his dolly, so he should be--”
“Is what? Possible? I know it’s possible.”
As he hugged the boy tight, Tony watched as SHIELD personnel filed into the room, bringing a tray of equipment with them. One of them started to talk about the drainage process, but Tony waved them quiet and carefully rolled onto his right side, giving PJ a small smile as the medical team started to work.
. You’re almost done,” he murmured, quickly scrubbing PJ down with a scrap of washcloth, “Then we’ll get you all wrapped up in a towel and
“We’re going to have words later when there aren’t small ears,” Tony grumbled, shaking his head, “Or I’m going to make Barnes and Wilson have words with you.”
Tony unknotted the t-shirt and slipped it off PJ, hurrying his movements once the boy started to shiver. With quick instructions and oversight from Natasha, he managed to get the boy to cooperate with the training pants and small jeans, then the Black Widow tee and a tiny zip-up grey hoodie.
At least, that is what he
“Team exercise successful, Sir,” she said into the device in her sleeve, allowing herself one skip in her step.
“If you do something stupid—”
Tony sat up, ignoring PJ’s whine for the moment so he could put his hand on Steve’s shaking shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze.
Steve nodded, lips trembling as he leaned down to kiss Tony’s dirty forehead, not caring that he smelled of sweat, blood, and urine. God, if it weren’t for the pulse that he could feel under his fingertips, he’d be more than a right royal wreck. Still, he was afraid to cuddle Tony any closer, not wanting to aggravate the light in his chest.
“There’s plenty of room in here for both of you.”
“That’s good. If he didn’t have amnesia then, he most likely won’t have it when he wakes up. He may be afraid, though. We’ll be monitoring the whole time, but if something happens, ring for the nurse and we’ll come running. Now, there’s one last thing to discuss, but we’d like to tell you privately, Captain, if that’s alright?”
“O-of course, little rabbit, I will make sure we treat them right,” Steve stammered, “I--I will not let them do anything you would not allow, I promise--”
“What about room?” He asked.
“Ooooh,
“My MIT one? The one you took?”
Tony left Rhodey’s side to run up to Steve, peeking at the baby in his arms. Fat tears rolled down Peter’s flushed cheeks, but he did not look hurt, only upset.
Ever quiet, Steve leaned back up and offered him a small smile, then settled back down on the bed. He tapped his ear and rolled over onto his side, closer to Tony. Just as he was about to ask what Steve was doing, their bedroom door flew open to reveal Thor, hurriedly attempting to catch said door with one hand and a large platter balanced in the other.
“Honestly? I am not sure. His control will come back eventually, with time.”
A muffled ‘got it’ came through the wall, so Tony relaxed back into the bed, noisily humming as he finished off his breakfast and half of the pot of coffee. He moved the tray to the bedside table, scooting himself out of the nest of blankets and bedsheets to get himself ready for the day, already grinding away possibilities in his head for ways to help Shuri scan through the Sahara base they had located. By the time he was dressed with the last cup of coffee in his hand, Tony realized that Steve still wasn’t back, and went to check on him.
“You’re still disgusting.”
“Shhh, my love, I am here,” he whispered, finding that it was easier to talk that way, “You must be ready for a change and something to eat—”
Tony felt a bit guilty at that, blushing some himself.
Jerking his head, Tony stared as Steve got the message, nodding and practically sprinting from the room. Tony rolled his eyes, but he kept up his soothing talk to PJ, bouncing a bit to try and help his cries.
Tony sniffled and nodded, wiping at his eyes.
“Thank you,” he said, looking up at the Alpha.
his brain yelled, nearly drowned out by the waves of intrusive thoughts that threatened to send him into a full-blown panic attack,
As he ticked down the measurements, he kept PJ’s hand held in his own, idly rubbing his thumb over the child’s tiny knuckles. Once he got to the bottom, he looked over at the boy, a tiny frown on his face.
“Papa sad,” PJ said, his own small voice worn out, “No.”
“You need to go, Tony,” one whispered, pressing their foreheads together, “We’ll stall as long as we can, but you need to go
“Don’t worry, Stark, I’m sure the Captain is fine,” Thor added, petting Bruce’s hair from where the doctor had fallen asleep on his shoulder, “He has survived worse.”
With a shaky hand, PJ reached out to touch the shirt, only to burst into tears. He plopped down in the doorway and sobbed, rubbing his eyes. Tony was taken aback for a second before his brain kicked in and he attempted to soothe the boy.
Regardless, he poured through the sheet had ended on. By the end, his face had gone pallid, mouth open slightly as he tried to accept what he had just read.
“Daddy’s sorry he left you for your first night alone,” he said quietly, pretending as though he did not want to yell from how much pain his body was in, “I missed hearing your tiny breaths when I tried to sleep. The Prime is warm, but not as comforting as you, my love. Perhaps we can cuddle tonight, yeah? Would you like that? More time with Daddy?”
“A-ah, Alpha,
Balancing Peter on his chest, Tony went over and put his fingertips under the running stream. He flinched at the heat and turned the other tap until the water began to cool to slightly above lukewarm. Looking up at the Prime, he nodded and stepped back. The man put his own hand under the water and grunted, but Tony could not tell if it was a positive or a negative response. Once the tub was a few inches full, Tony reached over and shut the water off, pretending as though the Prime was not staring, watching his every move. Theoretically, he could do without a bath for a while, but Peter needed to be cleaned, and he was willing to sacrifice a bit of dignity if it meant the baby was happy. He sighed and carefully began to undress, juggling Peter around like a hot plate as he stripped down to his underwear.
He must have visibly winced, for Steve’s eyes immediately filled with tears and he sat up, managing to slip his legs off of the bed before Tony could grab onto him.
“Do you think I will ever get used to him?” Tony quietly asked Peter, peeking down his shirt at the lazily gumming baby, “Or do you think I will always be taken aback by him?”
, he thought distantly, letting his exhaustion finally pull him under.
languages. If you do not like it, you can take lessons from Bruce, just as I did,” he said with an edge to his voice.
“We’re already in suits,” Steve continued on, reaching into the bag to rifle for his jeans, “And, because I’m always prepared—”
,” Steve said brokenly, “I grew—I grew out of my asthma at the beginning of last year—have—have I not—this whole time?”
“Please,” Tony begged again, blinking away tears as the sky above him started to move.
went.”
Steve nodded, so Tony focused on getting PJ cleaned up, deciding to do another sponge bath; after hearing about the submersion torture, he was more than wary on trying to introduce him to a regular bath or shower. Thankfully, PJ was tired enough that he didn’t whine too much as he went through his bedtime routine, eventually finding himself tucked up against Tony’s chest in Iron Man pajamas with his teeth brushed and his hair combed.
At Tony’s hesitant nod, Bruce moved the tray and sat, holding up the jar to Tony’s lips. He sighed and sipped at it, screwing up his face at the taste.
. One more growl out of you today and I will put you back in the dungeons myself,” Tony scolded, “We can decide this
“Thor?” Tony asked, praying to anyone who was listening that he was not blushing.
“This is all fairly new,” he admitted, running a shaky hand through his usually perfectly coiffed hair, “God, Bruce, I’m drowning, and I know the instant that I sit down, stop moving, and just
“The halo is really itchy, I promise you it isn’t as great as it looks.”
Still hiccupping slightly from the outburst, PJ pressed his face into Tony’s touch, seeming to seek out the comfort rather than his usual stance of shying away from it. Tony was careful to take even breaths, not wanting to scare the child again; he waited until PJ’s breaths evened out and he was snoring quietly for him to sigh in relief.
“Are you sure you want to stroke my ego this much?” Tony laughed softly, his eyes twinkling with mischief, “Though I’m not necessarily
“Huh?-- Sam, what is so funny?” He whined, “What did you
“Steve drew this,” Bucky said proudly, showing Sam the page, “
Steve’s startled laugh warmed his belly and made him feel quite light inside; sensing a shift in the mood, he took the opportunity to lead Steve down to the infirmary, where a ruckus reached their ears before they ever reached the door. Once they got to the threshold, they realized why it was so loud: it seemed that all of the warlords had gathered in the room, breaking bread and taking turns cooing over the baby currently propped up in Rhodey’s lap. Tony cleared his throat and popped the bubble as everyone shut up and turned to look at him. Rhodey’s gaze flickered up and down his body and then over to Steve, where a smug look slowly spread across his face.
“So he has a small dick.”
“That’s not fair,” he finally said, dropping his arms to his sides as he turned back to Bruce, “And you know it.”
to know how they got my DNA, of all things.”
“It was an accident,” Tony grumbled, quickly crossing the room to take Steve’s hand, “It was a reflex. Do not let it go to your head.”
“I think Steve would agree and happily take it from you. Nothing beats him up more inside than the fact that he’s failed Tony once and will probably fail him again, y’know? He’s never doubted loving Tony, he just didn’t really know what that meant until he nearly lost him. I don’t think he’d ever purposefully try to
“Tis a good name, Anthony,” Thor answered, hefting Mjolnir onto his shoulder, “Aye. I think it is quite fitting for the son of the Man of Iron to be strong.”
The blade was close to being finished and only needed to be sharpened and polished once it was fully cooled. Tony looked it over and set it aside, then trudged down the hall to the armory itself where he had stored a small bed of furs. It was late and he reeked of ash and smoke, so instead of attempting to go up to bed and get clean without waking up his toddler and bondmate, Tony kicked off his boots and laid down. He barely had the strength to pull the furs up to keep him warm, but once he was covered he fell into a deep sleep.
“Could he? What if it was
Tony sighed, but he tamped down the urge to bolt, instead focusing on the child currently trotting over to him. He raised an eyebrow, smirking down at PJ.
“Idiot. He is not trying to take me from you,” Tony scolded right back, leaning back up to look at Steve, “He knows that we are betrothed and he is not stupid enough to try and break that.”
Steve sighed, uncharacteristically not arguing with him. Instead, he sat back, picking up the bag off of the floor to rummage through it.
They stood together for another minute to confirm that Peter was settled; Steve pulled away first, beckoning to Tony to follow him. Obedient, Tony went with him, confused when they ended up back in their bedroom. He wanted to question him, but Steve had already gone into his closet.
“He’s stable and should be waking up soon,” the one in the front said, “Now, there are a few things you should know before you go back and see him. Mr. Stark-Rogers has experienced a large amount of physical and emotional trauma. We’re…unsure of how mentally stable he will be when he wakes up. Now, when you found him, he was lucid, correct?”
“Can you hurry? Please? With the baby sleeping, I do not--”
“Honestly. He seems like a whole new man and you have only been here for two seasons,” Sam chimed in.
Tony had never felt more grateful for the device in his life.
Tony hushed him and pulled his fingers away so he could move them toward the edge of the lake where large, flat stones covered the ground. Thankfully, they were big enough to fit two grown men, albeit slightly uncomfortably. Steve did not seem to care, as he scrambled out of the water to present himself on his hands and knees for Tony, looking back at him over his shoulder with hazy eyes. Gods, he looked stunning with his skin all slick and dripping, shining under the sun. Tony’s mouth watered and he finally moved up to kneel behind him, eagerly kneading the Prime’s asscheeks and spreading them apart.
wasn’t a regular state of matter—man, that was—”
be my favorite. It’s the flavor I got when we went to Coney Island and I threw up on the rollercoaster, Buck. I thought you knew that.”
“Hey kid, I’m going to need you to hold onto me, okay?” Tony asked PJ, giving him a serious look, “If we’re going to get out of this one, we gotta keep the touch for a while. Can you do that?”
sleeping together. I think I would know if we were.”
young, I didn’t think I was ready to have a kid, and with all of Afghanistan still fresh in my mind, I wasn’t mentally ready, either. That really spurred the first time we split. So, to win her back, I read every highly rated parenting manual I could find. Then, once I fully came to terms with the whole anxiety-and-depression shit, I read as much as I could on abused and traumatized kids to see how my past would affect my future.”
“Hey!” Tony griped, only to sheepishly look up at a concerned Mr. Coulson, “…Can I have that back?”
“If you need help, ask,” he was saying, pushing cutlery into Tony’s hand, “I figure you can cut stuff up, but if it makes your side hurt, I don’t mind doing it. I’ll be right back, I left PJ in his highchair with juice and I need to make sure he doesn’t cause a tsunami in the kitchen. Pills have already been crushed up and added to your eggs since you don’t like taking them regularly. Do you need anything else? That is, anything that isn’t ketchup.”
“My friends! It is good to see you in good health,” he said in the Southern language, “How was our homeland while we were gone?”
Steve’s eyes went wide and the other men burst into raucous laughter, having to hold onto each other to keep from falling over. Tony watched as Steve’s cheeks grew rosy, so he closed the gap between them, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder.
“Yeah. We probably should,” he finally managed, unaware he’d protectively tightened his hand around PJ’s without telling him.
because he’s afraid he’ll punch holes in the walls. Clint’s wadded-up paper balls miss the trashcan.”
“Middle of who-the-fuck-knows Florida. I had to leave behind the War Machine suit so I could infiltrate the base, steal a uniform, and try to get you out. Finding you and commandeering the truck was easy, but the second HYDRA guard wasn’t in the plan, so that’s on me,” Rhodey sighed, “I didn’t have my comm on me to tell the others, either, since it was in the suit. For you, other than the neck wound, nothing’s too badly banged up, save for your chest injuries. I had to do some emergency stitching when we got back, but I got word to Steve and I was able to staunch the bleeding until he got here to help. So, other than that, you might have bruising on your back from fainting in the truck and hitting the back divider at a good 85 miles an hour.”
