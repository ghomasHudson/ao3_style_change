“Agreed,” Natasha said.
Tony couldn’t tell if it was three of them, or if one of them had fused into a single thing with two heads.
“It seems like the lab retained a staff to gather and collate records on the local population, and I can see why.
“Finish your beer and let’s go see what the others found.”
“Hear what?” Steve said.
One six year old girl died of ovarian cancer at Virginia Tech, and it looks like Machen had all her files sent here and then someone made them classified.”
Wait here for me.”
“He’s getting worse,” she added.
He should have looked ridiculous, his hair mussed from his short nap and still loosely wrapped in an ugly blanket, but something about the way he spoke filled Tony with dread.
Tony didn’t point out the lack of facilities or the agent’s dropping vitals.
“When?
Steve, I’m…”
“Gwah?” he said into the wrong end of the communicator.
“Negative.
“Stay with us, Clint,” Tony said.
Beyond the heavy door was a small, bare hallway that ended in another door.
He tried an experiment and this time the face visor of his suit opened without giving him any warnings.
“Why did you call us back?”
He held his hand out, but Steve didn’t take it.
“Quarantine, remember?” Tony said.
“Better to be prepared.”
Let us know if you need help.”
She accompanied the shift in the conversation with a shift in her body language, relaxing until there were just Nat and Tony, two friends talking, instead of Iron Man and the Black Widow.
She typed something into the keypad and brought up a document.
“Unnecessary,” Thor said.
Steve pressed him, firm but gentle, back to the mattress.
Someone had knocked a tray of instruments askew, or perhaps the explosion had done that, and the scalpel blades were stained with the same dark substance.
The Whateley family founded the town, such as it is, in 1819, but before that I don’t think there were any white settlers on the mountain.
He pulled himself over the edge and stood, shaking and glad no one would ever know, and clutched the metal frame of the clunky old machine. After a moment he put his back against the suit. He hated having the bottomless pit behind him but he found he couldn’t look away from the hideous goat.
He reached for the communicator, but he needed to talk to him like a boyfriend, not an Avenger.
He gestured to their crate of food.
And I worked in Pennsylvania and Ohio before I came back here.”
“They get spotty once you go back to before the mining boom, but there are cuttings and journal entries all the way back to Makepeace Whateley, who came down from New England and founded the town.
“But what was that at the end?”
Mother’s hands were gentle as She tore the armor apart.
The bodies were burned.
Is that why you never tell anyone what’s in all those pouches?
I’ll leave you instructions.”
“Worse.
His scanners still showed nothing; Thor might not have ever existed as far as they were concerned, and he could not sound the depth of the chasm at all.
“Come,” he said.
My theory is they are afraid of a rogue agent or sleeper cell, and you should be able to handle that.
The light bounced off a monstrous, shadowy face surrounded with writhing black lines.
He handed them a small bioshield bag and Steve shifted the contents until they were visible in the little clear window.
“I’ll be fine,” Steve said.
, Steve’s voice called to him from the infinite dark.
“Smell that?” Steve asked, and Thor nodded and grimaced.
“Thor, really do not touch that stuff.
He could taste death in his mouth, a whiff of decay as Steve sucked in his breath.
“Tis an evil thing,” Thor agreed.
They’re gone.
Now that Steve was close to him, his visor refused to stay open and kept snapping shut as he spoke and he had to flip it open every few words.
“How long ago was that?”
But this way, I can work until… Until it’s time.”
“I thought you were resting,” Steve began, but she glared at him.
They reached for him, beckoning to him, and became hands.
Mjolnir opened the way for them, but Thor let his own body punch through the roof of the cavern and widen a passage out of the top of the mountain, slamming into layer after layer of stone and wood as the Old Crow Mountain Mine collapsed.
“Duly noted, Captain Pedantic.
“The serum will fight it off.
“But what did he want out of a mine that’s been closed for a century?” Steve asked.
“Tony…”
“Allow me to open the way,” Thor said, hefting his hammer.
“Bullshit.
Of those that escaped, another seventy fell ill not long after and died of something that officials referred to as ‘black consumption’.
Throughout the compound, Tony could see high-contrast lines of delineation where the modern facility had updated the nineteenth century mine works, gleaming steel and concrete jointed on to pitted and scarred iron and wood.
Machen lay crumpled against the wall and the dark glisten of his blood had stained the goat’s leering muzzle.
“Go,” he insisted and waved Tony on.
It felt like the darkness wrapped around him, cradled him and slowed his descent.
Tony gave up on dignity and cuddled against him as his body began to gain awareness of all the places it had stiffness and pain.
“He’s not dead.”
“You see a future in which humanity still clings to their electric replacements for campfires and numbs themselves to the true horrors of the universe with the pabulum of glowing screens.
The light went out and the darkness poured in.
He kept his voice and his hand steady, and pinned Machen against the stone wall with its line of crudely carved worshippers.
A thought caught him and jerked him back to the pain and he fought, irrationally, to sit up.
The road snaked through switchbacks and sharp drops, an incongruous ribbon of fresh black tarmac, though the builders had not bothered with signs or guardrails.
He heard it in his head like a remembered conversation or an annoying song, and the longer it went on the more he wanted to pick up the hideous creature instead of kill it.
“Then I think you have to ask yourself what you’re most afraid of,” she said.
“Tastes like piss and water,” Thor said with a grimace. “Do you want one?”
They writhed and withered and their psychic shrieking echoed through Tony’s head again, changing character rapidly like a radio going up and down the frequencies, as though they tried to find one that affected the system that was causing their death.
Clint would be gone already if he could think clearly to escape.”
“We were fixing to leave,” she said to no one in particular.
“What is Mother?”
His teammates continued their investigation while JARVIS argued with the computerized locking mechanism.
Steve’s eyes went wide with surprise but Tony silenced his protest with a kiss, willing Steve to feel everything he didn’t have the time, or the words, to say.
Buckman was an educated man in his early thirties, and Tony thought he might have chosen a wife he could talk to.
“I’ll leave the secondary in place,” Tony said.
“I can hear Her.
“So come get some rest.”
Tony wasn’t sure any of the others knew Thor well enough to see the doubt in his eyes, but he spoke with all the conviction he could summon.
The sensors and electronics that studded it had gone dark and lifeless, and the metal looked as though it had burned or eaten into the flesh until it had fused with the skull itself.
Like the crown of a newborn’s head, the rest followed in a slippery rush.
The suit surged through the rest of the barrier and into the chamber beyond.
“You almost done?”
But when he caught Tony’s eye, he gave a slight shake of his head.
A massive sound, something like Thor’s thunder and something like the awful goat laugh he’d heard several times before, shook the cavern and the portal quivered and shuddered and, to his horror, widened.
Even Steve would soon be gone, and Tony had expected to see him strong and handsome as ever when he himself was hobbling around a nursing home and raving about rocket canes.
The deluge stopped as quickly as it had begun and the lights came on with a click and a hum.
They did not pass any other vehicles.
Everyone is coming out of this alive, and if you try to imply otherwise, no more Trenta Pumpkin Spice Lattes for you unless you find a place in Manhattan that can give change for a gold coin.”
Panic rose within him and fought to override the tactical part of his mind, but he put his left hand taser to full power and shocked the one on his arm.
I’d feel slightly less horrible.
They left Mjolnir to stand her lonely watch.
Or they might have, if he could have taken off the armor.
Clint lowered his bow and pulled his collar up over his mouth and nose.
“Are you going to heed my advice?”
“Bullshit.
“Not much time left.”
The light dimmed to almost nothing for a moment and came back, though not to its former brightness.
Only a few wisps of hair, thin and colorless as cobwebs, clung to his scalp, but a metal circlet sat at his temples.
“Fury,” he said.
“All right,” he said aloud.
Do you read me?” Steve’s voice sounded different, less annoyed and more worried.
Thor should have been at his side, should have kept them from swarming him.
“For once, you aren’t the last one.
Tony took hold of the front of his clothes and hauled him up, and though he heard the rotten tearing sound his metal gauntlet made, he didn’t know or care if it had been fabric or skin that made it.
“How long?” he asked.
The bald trees they passed were still veiled in heavy gray fog and the light that filtered through the dim white sky did little to burn it off.
He faced his repulsors into the dark, and to his side he saw the flickering light of Mjolnir as Thor stood against the great crevasse at their back.
Tony could not see his chest rising at all, but he could hardly trust the shaking, rushing dark at the edges of his vision.
He overrode them, set them back to minimum levels and rerouted power to the weapon systems.
“I’m not… He’s never going to stay with me, Nat.
That’s what it feels like, anyway.
Each time he terminated it before it went through.
The next few moments passed in a blur of lunging darkness and light that swung crazily around the irregular rock of the cavern.
But your time away makes you an outsider.”
“That’s the trouble.
“We can try there first,” Steve said.
He descended from above the rows of bodies like a spider, the lower part of his body now organically connected with the cave.
And you aren’t, either, but I see the way you two look at each other, and you would be an idiot to let him walk out of your life because you were afraid to have a little faith in him.”
Lady Pepper helped me with it.
“At least back to the lab, then.
The cavern’s deep cold seeped through the thin layer of his breeched undersuit and the first serious shiver shook him.
The adrenaline rush of denial began to fade, leaving Tony with a cold, empty ache in his stomach, numb and unable to process the thought that Thor had truly gone.
They have more equipment than I do here; maybe they can get more out of it.”
He and Natasha headed for the municipal building.
Tony pointed to the screen, where the date showed October 13, but where the year should read there was only a line of corrupted graphics.
He took a few steps and started to say something before he realized that Steve wasn’t behind him.
“I will recover,” Thor said.
He opened the wooden door and found it unlocked.
“Did…did someone explode over there?”
“One of us must be wearing something that doesn’t permanently smell like cat piss,” Natasha said.
“But you have done your part.
He could feel something thicker than blood running from the wounds in his inner thighs and his whole body felt fever chilled and tired.
“Medical files,” she said.
They were probably just backwoods snakehandlers or something.
“Please tell me you have another suit,” he said.
I want to be able to talk no matter how much gets between us.” Tony winced at the unintended weight of what he’d said, but he didn’t try to amend it.
“You are so reassuring,” Tony sighed.
He let himself in and undressed in the mudroom, dumping his gray denim coverall in the washer for the morning.
Tony sighed and began scanning the building for traces of the compound he’d seen at the lab.
His light played over the stone and spattered gore.
He reached in and disabled the safeguards.
For the first time that day, he felt some hope for them, even if it was mixed with irritation that Steve wanted to send him away.
“So give me a stack,” Steve continued.
I tried to make them comfortable.”
“What about there?” Thor asked.
What the fuck was going on up here?
Very few things were a match for Thor’s strength, but when the cool blue light fell over the scene, Tony saw the God of Thunder was in trouble.
“It looks like the CIA thought they were running pretty standard telepathy and mental manipulation experiments up here to develop tech that can protect the brain from interference, but there’s one item of equipment Machen purchased that he didn’t bill to his official backers: an old mining exo-suit.”
Tony was at last able to raise the visor and breathe air that, if not fresh, was at least different.
“She heard me.
He pointed to the Clean Zone door.
“Something is here,” Steve said.
His scanners displayed nonsense numbers as he peered into the darkness, but the bright beam of his reactor fell on Thor.
Thor was gone.
These were all off, blind and showing nothing more than a reflection of the abandoned dinner tray on the desk.
“I’m scanning for…”
“I’ve had worse.”
“How do you feel?”
Tony didn’t even want to move enough to see.
Tony and Thor hurried to meet up with them.
One entire side was devoted to an enormous screen and the cool LED lights of sleeping computers winked below it.
“I doubt a bunch of dead miners from a century ago have anything to do with the problems at the facility they built eight years ago,” Tony scoffed, but he didn’t really believe it.
He worked the controls, out of Tony’s sight below the edge of the bed, and the back rose up enough that Tony could see where they were.
Thor scanned the trees and looked over his shoulder every few moments, and three times he paused so long to listen to the low rustle and drip of the mountain that Steve and Tony had to stop and wait for him to catch up.
Despite the delays it appears my faith in you was well founded.
“Mother,” he said.
“He was done up on Old Crow, and we were going to get Brandi and move to the city, have Jimmy Junior here and get a kitten and a little apartment in the middle of everything.
She crossed her arms and gave him a cool stare.
“I know it’s a baby whatever it is, but I think we should kill it,” Clint said.
“You had better get used to it,” Steve said, and he gave Tony one of his million dollar smiles, dimmed by worry and lingering hurt, but real.
Another cot had been prepared next to his, with an IV stand and a tray of loaded syringes lined up next to it, but Natasha sat at the room’s computer console.
He did not want to play what he’d found for Steve, or anyone else he cared about, but he hit the button anyway.
“For Clint?” Natasha asked.
Tony could hear them now, and Steve’s jaw tightened and his eyes swept back and forth.
“We don’t have any time,” he said.
Steve cocked his head and listened with unfocused eyes, trying to make out the sounds.
“Are you referring to the reactor core that currently resides in your chest, keeping you alive?”
He was back in the cavern, at the edge of the crevasse.
Tony kept his opinion about the odds of that to himself, but from the looks on their faces Thor and Natasha shared his pessimism.
We left him in an empty building for an hour,” Tony asked.
“I will.
The woods on Old Crow Mountain were no more lovely by day.
He pulled his arm back inside the cramped suit and tapped a brief message into the comm panel: 38C CORRECT TUNNEL.
Machen has a detailed list of her activities and locations, and I find his thoroughness chilling.
“He wants to see that you are serious,” he concluded.
“But they don’t move like humans,” he said.
Steve’s voice called his name, but something was wrong.
“Tis the eve of a great battle, my friend.
He felt tempted to shoot the poor man himself, but his scanners were really freaking out now and his mind raced to make sense of the impossible data they reported.
“I will.
“Her lullaby is as sweet as the end of the world,” he continued.
He didn’t know what he wanted to say to him, but he knew he wanted to say something.
“Just like being back in college,” Tony joked.
They continued into a spacious kitchen, wooden shelves loaded with Ball jars and lacy yellow curtains hung from the window over the deep sink.
His armor at last decided he was safe enough to open up, and Tony let himself be glad as his helm folded up and he felt air on his face.
“Don’t get careless,” Steve told them.
Steve stood patiently as Thor and Clint restlessly scanned the narrow corridor and the darkened doorways that branched off.
Steve shot him a look full of disobedience and for a moment Tony feared he would get closer instead, out of compassion for the agent and spite for his co-leader, but the others backed off.
Once Tony heard the hiss of the door behind him, he raised his faceplate in relief.
“First of all, people disappear here,” she said, ignoring his question.
“Shouldn’t it say ‘Welcome to Crows?’?” Natasha asked, breaking the silence in the vehicle.
Their hearts were beating, sluggish and failing, but he got no readings for brain activity.
You know he wants to help.”
Fury had only lost contact two days ago, so where were the rest?
Had people been coming here for years, adding more crudely sketched worshippers to the image?
If Tony had to guess, this was the true center of civic life in Crows.
Steve picked up the bag but left the weapon.
Hawkeye is in trouble.”
I don’t want to force you into anything, and I’m not asking to take over your life.
“Like shit,” Tony croaked.
“Is he even alive?” Steve asked.
Tony switched the suit to full spectrum scans.
On top of everything else.
And would not reopen without a code.
The cold, damp air made Steve cough and choke and twice they had to halt so he could get his breath back.
He took two cautious steps to the left and knocked over another skeleton.
He hit the soft, pungent soil and plowed up a deep loamy furrow.
“And he only lives downstairs.”
“Can you stand up?”
With each call, he tugged again, growing weaker each time.
COMING.
Before Thor could strike, they had torn it in two.
Tony could see in his face that Steve had the same thought that they all refused to voice: What if Thor tried to access the Clean Zone, and couldn’t?
“Can you hear it?” Tony asked.
He found his phone as he sipped coffee and started several times to make the call.
It was a casual thing to you, I get that, maybe I’ll even accept it eventually, but right now we have much bigger problems to deal with.”
Once I thought…”
He made his way over and stood with Tony.
He pointed across the street to a tired, dilapidated building of unpainted wood.
“Any time you have need of the hardest head in all Nine Realms, you have only to ask.”
“Later,” Steve said, but he smiled.
“Let’s find Thor,” Steve said.
He set his blaster to full power and shot the thing, its coils now thicker than his wrists.
So it is not the loss of control you fear, but the intimacy?”
I talked to Fury.”
“We found something,” Natasha said.
“This is even worse than we thought.”
He considered putting a trash bag on the seat to protect the battered old upholstery, not wanting any lingering traces of the goat’s cavern to remain in his life, but he didn’t like the way the light shone off the black plastic.
He sighed and pulled away.
“Good.
“He’d have to be…”
Steve gave him a quick, hard smile, and Thor seemed not to have heard him at all.
“Bruce is a physicist, not an MD.”
The pale nap of the fur was damp with rain and plastered with fallen leaves.
“Stark.
He studied Steve intently through the visor as a series of readouts appeared on his screens, assessing his pulse, his respiration, his injury status, shield and armor integrity, everything except for what Tony really wanted to know without having to ask.
He fiddled with his suit instead, checking the power levels and the range of motion after the fight in the cavern.
They still weren’t really talking to each other, and Thor looked about ready to grab them and shove their heads together.
He thought instead about last night, pouring his heart out to Thor .
“What is it?”
A cheap, cruel trick to lure prey.
“We’re here to help,” he added.
“I’m sure he’d love to meet you.”
He vomited and a flood of clotted, gelatinous fluid pooled at his feet.
“You’re right,” Tony admitted.
It’s in you already.
He could not, at that instant, have said if he was glad of the reprieve or sad to have lost his chance to join Her.
“Try again,” Tony said.
Tony nodded.
Tony had not believed the story, but he had seen that Thor believed it, and as he watched his friend walk toward the unfathomable inky darkness before him, the engineer within him could not help but calculate the distance in steps.
He clicked off the torch with relief.
Bodies he could deal with.
There was a brief pause, but just as Tony prepared to repeat himself, Steve replied.
“We only came here for information.
“Steve, I wanted to say…”
He wondered if they had been trying to write something.
It hit the wall with a faint splat and clung for an instant before it launched itself at Tony.
Steve gestured to the computers, encased in his Captain America uniform almost as thoroughly as Tony was in his armor.
She held Steve’s hand and for the first time looked him in the eye.
Tony thought.
Tony toggled his communicator and responded.
He took off and followed Steve to the porch.
“This place is abandoned,” Tony agreed.
And he hadn’t referred to him as “Iron Man” outside of a judicial hearing
She’s worse than I am but better than you.
He fired blindly, but for each one he hit it seemed another two took its place.
There’s a phone number written down on her birthday.
Doctor Machen’s response appeared on his screen and spurred him to return to work.
Serve Her.
“But he was the field leader
“Who were they letting in?” Steve wondered.
“Be careful,” Tony said.
Catch DUM-E and get my date book from Pepper.
Put on your big boy pants and talk to him.
He stood up, strengthened by the added weight of the hammer.
Tony cycled through his scanners, but none of his night vision modes could pierce the darkness beyond.
He wasn’t sure how long he fell into darkness.
The one we saw was certainly aggressive enough.”
Not human ones, though.”
The entire transformation had taken only seconds.
“Come on, let’s check on the others,” Tony said.
He hesitated.
She let them drip, blacker and thicker than blood, onto her breasts.
He’d decided what he wanted to say, and there was nothing Tony could do about it.
She got Thor.
I haven’t heard anything from them for the past two days, so see if you can figure out what happened to them as well.”
“No, on second thought, that’s already toast.
It towered over them, Tony saw, great fleshy lips that glistened with thick, black fluid.
A ten year old kid never came home for dinner in the fifties.
“I haven’t gone all the way through his file, but Machen vetted him extensively before he brought him on board.
A reckless, fatalistic sense of rage burned through him hotter than the fever that was taking root.
“This is the part that collapsed,” Steve said.
“Tony!”
Tony thought about the spray of gore as Steve sliced through tentacles and Sarah Buckman’s blood soaking him up to the elbows and wasn’t surprised.
“Are you ready to wed?”
“Thor, watch him.”
“We were too late before they even sent us.”
“Try me.”
“But there is something…”
“For him, and for you.
“I am trying to understand.
“I am sorry,” Fury said, and this time he sounded sincere.
Everyone’s gone, or will be, soon enough.”
As the agent’s vital signs plummeted, another set seemed to impose over them and grow stronger, like a parasite.
The disaster in 1903 had left no survivors, and much of what had happened remained an insoluble mystery, but the rocks weren’t where they should have been, and he was becoming increasingly sure of it.
“What’s your name?” Steve asked.
He caught a glimpse of lab coat, the filthy gray still shocking white against so much black, and a final snatch of mad, wet tittering as the thing that had been Doctor Machen scuttled over the lip of the chasm and disappeared from view.
Thor was always hungry.
“Can you hear it?” he asked Steve.
“I’ll have a few other things for you in the jet, but it’s deeply classified.
He knocked it out of the air and with the same fluid motion he brought the shield down on its head.
Iron Man, get me a quick aerial recon while we go through the front, then join me at the rear.”
“Any thoughts on how we stop it?”
It seemed unnecessary to even comment.
Only one lift had been repaired and updated, the others left to rot and rust, but even the new one didn’t inspire much confidence.
“We have to go down there,” Tony said.
Thor’s first annual Midgardian Yule party, to be exact.
Despite the wet coughing he battered the blindly writhing tentacles away from them.
They rounded the silent exo suit and Steve signaled them to a halt.
“Rotten,” he explained.
He put the ring in Steve’s hand and knew that someday, it would be a wedding band.
It was not until his scanners came online and began checking also that Tony realized his helm had snapped shut again.
“So there’s some strange things about this mountain,” Natasha told him.
“It will keep me alive for a few days, if that even matters.”
His hand plucked at the rags of his once-white coat while the tentacles that had replaced his other limbs spasmed and wriggled as though they were a separate thing from the rest of him, and would have liked to escape.
“We’re losing him,” Tony said.
“What’s the plan?”
“I did talk to him,” Natasha said.
“But I knew it wasn’t you, either.”
“Don’t you usually fly point, big guy?” Steve asked him.
He looked away from them and added, “I am not hungry.”
She can’t stay out here alone, waiting for a dead man.
I know you aren’t interested in talking to me, but you could at least try to behave like a… a professional, while we’re working.”
The bronze had an uneven patina that left the miner covered with dark stripes, but they seemed an intentional part of the work, shifting coils that bore him down or bound him.
“Mmmhhmm…” the man pleaded.
He wanted to grab Steve and make him listen, make him see, but Steve had closed him out and they could hear the outer door of the Clean Zone whisking open again.
“How mad is he?” Tony asked.
Lightning arced all around the clearing, striking the grasping arms, and they writhed and smoked where it struck them.
He kept his gaze down as if that would keep them from noticing how red his eyes were.
“Nat.
I promise,” Tony added.
Thor did not answer him, but he went behind the counter and took down a filmy mug.
He turned to one side and moved his shield to cover Tony’s left.
The momentary calm he’d achieved while working dissipated instantly when the Director appeared on the screen.
Steve stood beside him with black ichor spattered all over his suit and his face, but Tony didn’t have long to see him before he returned to the fight.
They fell to the moldering carpet of leaves and Thor rolled to cushion his teammates.
“She is not my Mother, then.”
The tiny bit of pain might as well have been someone else’s for all he could feel it, and he hated the disconnected, clumsy feeling of his gauntleted fingers.
“But SHIELD has their position.
Steve’s brow furrowed with annoyance, but not before Tony saw something near panic fade from his eyes.
Steve asked.
They each had more blankets than he remembered, and Thor watched over them with sunken, bruised looking eyes.
“In a minute.”
Can you sleep in that?”
Crude candles, melted and dark now, sat incongruous atop the monitors and above them the rock had been smeared with dark gore in rough human shape.
Far below, the armor detonated with a bright flare, burning through the cavern and the portal.
What was that thing, and what does it have to do with the missing scientists?”
She gestured to the screen in front of her.
“We need to know what this is,” Steve said.
He lifted his foot again and struggled, tense with exhaustion and fear, to keep from bringing it forward.
Steve raised his shield and started down the tunnel, approaching the dark hulk of the suit with slow caution.
She turned to leave, but Tony caught her shoulder and held her back.
“Mother…” Thor whispered.
“Maybe,” Tony said.
“Get ready.”
“It’s not that long until dawn and you need to sleep.”
The afternoon temperature was already falling into the forties and a clammy mist stretched grey tendrils through the skeletal limbs of the trees.
“Sounds romantic.
He tossed the dead agent’s recorder in his direction, still not turning.
“Faint but moving.”
He realized that the armor had clicked shut over his face again but this time he let it stay.
Thor gave him his most harmless, charming smile, then turned it on Steve, then back.
“And it didn’t say anything about alien parasitic fungal infections that make you lose your mind and throw yourself into a bottomless hole.”
I think it’s this place.
It seemed he was above them, on either side, and even below them, tittering madly and slipping between German, English, and something else as he spoke.
He kept his bow trained on the helpless agent.
Thor shrugged until his cape would cover his shoulders, Steve acted as though it was not happening, and Natasha and Clint stared up at the sprinklers with distaste.
It crawled and lurched about at Steve’s feet, blind and mewling.
“Sort of,” Steve said.
He tried to sound confident, and not think about how pale Thor had been on the way back, or the rasp in his voice and the gleam of fever in his blue eyes.
I couldn’t do this without touching you one more time.
“Please…I’d like you here when I do it.
He studied it for a moment, his own face and hands and body captured in action and repose.
He?” Tony shook the old man and fought the urge to crush him against the wall as Machen giggled.
They each dropped the half they were holding and looked at Tony.
He just had a feeling that he would want doors he could close and lock around here.
“But they can’t keep her out.”
“What aren’t you telling us?” Steve asked.
“And let me help.
They sat for a moment, and the scratch of Steve’s pen was the only sound. “What are you drawing?” Tony finally asked.
It’s just taking a while because a lot of it is offline, and if I boot it all back up the security measures could get a little annoying.”
He never heard it hit bottom.
Not that Tony was surprised, but even with Thor’s help to hold his hand steady, the scanner returned an angry red light and the door remained shut.
Not that he wanted to stay.
“What are you doing?”
Get your tin ass in here.
What if we come back, but it’s really whatever this thing is?”
I hope we don’t have to spend the night.”
He pointed to the last structure of any size, an old clapboard country church that had been painted an odd dark greenish gray.
“I’ll go check on Clint.”
“Tis good to see you awake,” Thor said.
Tony asked him.
“The place looks like it was abandoned the same day that the lab was.
It shook him to his knees and the shield clanked against the floor as he supported himself, one hand flung out to brace against the wall and the other clutched to his side.
It might impress him, or anger him further.”
“Tony, come back.”
“I will stay with Clint and Natasha,” he said.
His latest screw up.
He struggled to his feet, swayed, and dropped back to his knees, fresh black blood draining from his rent armor.
“Human,” he said.
A familiar dark substance had stained its worn, smiling muzzle, hand sewn from castoff corduroy by some mother or grandmother.
Natasha knelt down and examined the inner control panel.
“Those could have been here for ages,” Tony said.
“I couldn’t tell you with scientific certainty.
They all went silent and still, listening at the heavy double sealed door.
When have you ever been worse?”
“Celebrate what?”
“Mother!” he wheezed.
Behind it, Tony could just make out some ancient railroad tracks, the gravel embankment grown over with weeds and stained with rust, and the ruins of a turn of the century train depot. An abandoned freight car had rotted through sometime in the past and dumped some of its cargo of raw anthracite coal down the side.
My team will join me with the rest of our equipment soon.
“Too late to stop Her,” he sang.
He backed away from the wall, one deliberate step after another, taking in the vast multitude of tiny human figures carved all around the black goat in a hopeless throng.
“We really need to talk to him,” Steve continued.
He opened his eyes to the bright, clinical white of a hospital room and winced away from the light.
He saw Steve only in images, bright flashes in the dark like single stills of film, but he could not stop himself from trying to keep track of Steve along with the shifting mass of their enemies.
The clammy damp of the cavern clung to his skin and he felt a cough tickling at the back of his throat.
He groped again for the far door and the handcuffs rattled.
Thor was keenly interested in anything that could dispense caffeine or alcohol, so it surprised him less that he could program the fancy machine and more that he would think to do it.
Tony scoffed.
Tony had known he would.
Tony wished he could take it back, because it seemed they were still going for “cool and professional” in front of the others.
It plunged the hideous goat mural back into the blackness, but revealed the lip of a chasm beyond, a plumbless depth of unknowable void that was worse than the crude attempts of man to depict the thing within. For an eye blink, it caught one of the things in the light.
He took the brightest lantern he had with him and clicked it on, leaning over and shining it around the floor.
The visor slid up and at last they were eye to eye in the dim blue light of the reactor, as they had been on so many happier nights before.
It wasn’t much of an improvement: musty from constant recycling underground and harsh with the lingering scent of disinfectant, but at least the carbon dioxide meter in his suit would soon edge out of the orange warning range.
The bodies dropped, one after another, into the sludge at their feet and sank within the mire.
“The mission has to come first.
Any promise he could make sounded hollow.
Pick me up and we’ll fly down there.”
“They are trying to surround us,” Tony told Steve.
The less I know about your personal life the happier I am.
“So what’s the link?” Steve asked.
It’s sort of symbolic, of course, but it will hold you until we can add you to all the biometrics.”
Think you can do better than those spooky assholes down in the pit?
Tony blasted it from the air, aiming for that middle pulse, but too many tentacles were in his way.
Steve bowed his head and shut his eyes, and Tony wanted more than anything to know what to say to him.
“And I think they knew about it.”
“Because I think it’s in
“Very well,” Thor said.
Thor’s head momentarily eclipsed the dim light as he stepped inside with the others following.
“Something you want to ask me?”
All three of them recoiled from the huge, insensible thing before realizing that the lines were not tentacles but veins of coal and dark-stained carvings etched into the stone.
“You didn’t do anything wrong,” Steve said, but he was not looking Tony in the eye.
“You did?”
I should never have played the Carlton recording for him.”
How long can you stay sealed in there?”
“What does she…Look out!”
“Just in case?”
“Proceed with caution, then,” Steve said.
“How are they?” Tony asked.
I’m Sarah Buckman.
Thor refused to join them in the Clean Zone.
He promised.”
Or, you know, hang a new bag for us.
“Thor?
We can help you,” Steve said, though it clearly left a bad taste in his mouth to offer it.
His team had had over a dozen researchers and assistants, Tony knew, and he still had no way of knowing how many were down here in the dark, but he knew they were about to find out.
“Yes, yes, I’ll think about it.
Thor gingerly sat on one of the stools and it creaked and swayed under his weight.
His eyes went distant and a veil of gray mist passed across his eyes like thunderheads forming.
“She is mad,” Thor said.
Buckman’s probably lost with all the others.”
He thought of the previous morning, but it only made him remember that Thor was in trouble and could not have done it.
They rounded a final bend and the town itself came into view.
“Of course,” Steve said.
The tentacles detached with a meaty squelch and fled into the shadows.
She settled back to sleep at the sound of his voice and he stroked her heavily pregnant belly.
Steve admitted.
She stretched her shaking fingers back toward the panel, but paused before she touched it.
“Hawkeye, I want you to stay here,” Steve said.
Thor’s eyes had vanished and pools of darkness shifted overlarge in his sockets, the same deep, cosmic emptiness that Tony had seen beyond the portal.
“But we shall not know for sure unless we give it a try.”
Bioweapons?”
His voice rumbled with quiet intensity.
“Sorry,” he muttered.
“The area they were clearing.”
After that, things get hard to piece together.”
She followed him back through the dim laboratory to the Clean Zone.
Everyone just got so bored they fucked off to find a decent cheeseburger.
“Is that Natasha with him?” Tony could make out a familiar splash of auburn and a pair of scrubs like Steve’s next to Clint’s bed.
“What the hell did I just listen to?” Steve asked.
We have intelligence to bring back.
“We must,” Thor said.
Tony looked away quickly, but he could not avoid seeing the dark veins that stood out against his neck of the way his fingers twisted helplessly as he struggled.
An old television showed a muted golf game in short bursts interrupted by long patches of static next to a pair of small beer taps under the shelf and off to the side there was a blank door labeled MEN in uneven letters.
“Thor. Wake up.
“Not even a little.
“And we need to know if they are missing a child along with this bear,” Steve said, and the others nodded in grim agreement.
If there’s an explanation for it that doesn’t involve medical experimentation on humans, I’d love to hear it.”
All you have is that tin can of yours, and I would prefer we listen to it.
A feeble attempt, but he needed something to distract him from the sound of Thor laboring to breathe. Steve smiled for a moment before Captain America took over.
He walked in, damp with disinfectant and dressed in just his undershirt and briefs.
Give me Plan B.”
The slab was sticky with thick black gunk which had run over the sides and clogged in the drain.
He shook his head and scrabbled at the thing with his gauntlets, but it clung like tar, sticky and amorphous.
He continued as though he had never translated any of the whispering, but he hunched into himself and Tony read confusion in his eyes.
Clint sank back into the office chair and folded his arms on the desk, then rested his head on them.
They listened in silence as he choked and gasped and called out one word, over and over again: Mother.
He set Steve at the edge and flew over the chasm, and so had a last glimpse of Thor as coils of black like the bottom of the sea wrapped him and pulled him into oblivion.
“There was nothing left of him.
That you wanted me in your life, not in charge of it.”
“You can hear Her, can’t you?” Tony and Steve followed the voice, pinpointing the source somewhere up the darkened mural wall.
Mjolnir hit the stone with a heavy, resonant thud.
“We all die anyway and then whatever is on the other side of this gateway comes through and eats our entire galaxy,” Tony said.
You meant hands and stuff.”
The foreman, by all accounts a cheerful man with a new fiancée and no history of mental illness, hung himself from a tree outside the front gate a week later.”
“What if Thor comes back like that?” Steve finished, putting into words a thought Tony had been trying to avoid.
His eyes were shut tight in his pale face and he shook his head as if to clear it between bouts of retching, but he supported himself on
“No cars outside,” he said, and tried to brush aside the off feeling of the little church.
It was a lot of skepticism.
“Tony!
“Blueprints were among the many things Fury didn’t include for this mission,”
“Whatever we did to close the portal worked, I guess, and once the link broke, the disease lost a lot of its strength.
We are on our way to you now.”
I want to talk about it, but it keeps going wrong.
Thor stood and opened the plastic for Steve.
Steve caught it as Machen vanished into the portal, his shrill scream of terror and ecstasy cut off as the membrane between the worlds rippled and then went still.
Thor thought it was terrestrial, just old.”
It would only screw things up.
“What’s wrong with what I’m wearing?” Steve asked without looking up.
He turned them off and switched to regular visual input, increasing the light from the suit as much as he could even though it felt like painting a target on himself.
“Anything you want.
She’s…She’s getting to Steve.”
“We can’t leave him here,” Tony said.
He wanted to turn back around, head up the shaft and out of this state, take Sarah and the baby and move to a huge soulless city with no untamed woods, no view of the stars or low, ancient mountains.
“What, Steve?
He wanted things back as they were, like last night never happened.
“Nice to see not everyone around here is trapped in the time of the Robber Barons,” Tony said.
He wrapped it clumsily around Tony’s shaking shoulders and Steve caught it on the other side and tucked it around him.
“Is it some sort of panic room?” Natasha asked.
Steve was with him, though.
He could not form any further words, only wet retching sounds as he brought up more fluid onto the sterile green concrete floor.
Steve is spooked.”
“You should come to bed,” Steve said.
This is your team.
“OK.”
His own limbs felt heavy and clumsy, and only his right arm still felt like it even belonged to him.
, he wanted to add.
Tony’s light faded by another dim degree and off in the unlit darkness the portal continued to rumble and chuckle to itself while the flare charged at its base.
Soon Fury appeared in a box on the screen, and whatever he saw in Tony’s face made even the unflappable master spy blink and flinch away.
The vibration of its final scream broke a dead oak nearby with a wet crack and the tree crashed to the ground as Thor went to his knees.
“Go ahead,” he said, and his gentle voice made the emptiness in Tony start to fill with the dull ache of anger.
“To care for your mother.
Tony tuned him out.
There was no body at the base of the long smear where he’d left Machen.
“Shall we?” Tony asked Thor.
The tentacle in Thor’s throat tugged at him as the thing writhed and died, and Steve sliced through it with his shield.
They didn’t speak much at all as they made their way through the chuckling woods of Old Crow Mountain and down into the twice-abandoned mine.
“You did.”
“No one, babe.
In the pause of the conversation, they could hear Clint in the other room, retching and calling out, and Thor’s answering low murmur in response.
“Hostile?” Clint asked.
Without further warning, one of the things grew brave enough to leave the protection of darkness.
They climbed into one of the lab’s long black SUVs and Tony joined them for the drive down to the town of Crows.
“Yeah, fuck that.”
“I need an extraction yesterday.
“Both,” Tony said.
Thor and Clint had their horns locked over the box, empty save for one glazed cake donut, and they each seemed to be waiting for the other to back down or glance away long enough to snatch victory.
“Fury?”
In fact I rather hope word doesn’t get round or I’ll have all manner of charlatans and archaeologists bumbling around.
“No one here,” he said.
He shivered even inside the suit’s climate control.
He grew up around here, left for high school and got a degree from WVU.
“Yes it is.”
“It’s Captain America?” he tried.
Steve’s eyes met his for an instant, and Tony knew he’d danced closer to the truth than he meant to.
I’m going to check on the others.”
“A teddy bear?” Steve said..
“We’ll just wait for him to come home,” Steve said.
“Forward thinking of him,” Tony commented.
Tony wasn’t so scared to die now.
“But I couldn’t get in here until I took it off.”
Natasha looked up as though she would be able to see through the wall before bowing her head and focusing on an old sheaf of yellowed papers with renewed vigor.
“What happened here?” Steve asked her.
“I know.
It showed drips and smears of the same dark residue on the floor and walls as well.
Most of the leaves had already fallen here and formed a thick carpet over the roots of the gnarled oaks and maples.
He looked up at Tony, and his eyes were so young and vulnerable that it made Tony’s chest hurt.
Out here, nothing came between them and they had no need to speak as they blasted and battered their way past the pursuing tentacles toward the heaving bulk of the thing’s other end.
“I guess it’s alien, but it doesn’t match anything from my databases either.”
“Nobody home.
“Well, you would.”
Something lunged for him at eye level and he shielded his face with his hands out of instinct as something far back in his brain seemed to be screaming.
He sat with his hands braced on the console and took a few deep breaths, seeking the distance he would need to work.
“But I want you to listen to this.
Tony had difficulty locating the house even from the air. Ancient pines and maples formed a dense canopy that obscured the unlit houses and even the roads from his perception, and it took almost an hour to find the right house in the deepening dark.
Cold sweat dripped, thick and ever so slightly gray as it ran down his clenched jaw and his stride lost its strong, easy grace, but his eyes remained grim and focused in their bruised, sunken sockets and the shield never wavered in his grip.
“I guess they are gone, too,” Steve said.
In the dark, she was little more than a collection of dark and pale smudges.
The leering face of the black goat shot past behind Thor’s back, filling Tony’s sight for one last moment before lightning ripped her and her blasphemous throng apart and hurled them into the depths along with tons of stone and coal and brittle human bones.
The coroner had given it back to him after the accident, pristine once the blood had been washed away.
I don’t want to do whatever She wants me to do.
Desperate times.”
The thing blocked him and one of the many lashing arms fell smoking in the dirt.
Thor raised a heavy, shaking hand to his neck and unfastened the tattered, filthy remnants of his cape.
“The baby…” he began to say, but she interrupted him.
“Look at his eyes,” Thor said as Clint gasped for air.
“I was, when I was a mere mortal.”
“Alexander Carlton,” he read.
“Tony, bring up the rear.”
Thor swallowed the last of his beer in a final slug and slid off the stool.
That was the leap of faith he’d talked himself into.
Its ruined head hung limp amid the rolling mass of its tentacles, blind and dragging a rope of dark clotted brain matter along the ground.
He coughed, a low, rasping bark, and covered it by arranging the green blanket around his shoulders with exaggerated dignity.
She lowered the rifle but kept it handy.
“Tony, watch out!” Steve called, but all around him the darkness surged forward and caught him.
“I will tear you apart as you cry out in ecstatic joy to feel my smallest touch.”
“Whoever left it open knew the proper override codes.”
“Stay with him.”
“Very faint, about five meters ahead.”
“I’m not letting you go unless that’s really what you want.”
He muttered and fought to break the restraints that bound him to the bedrails, and although someone had covered him with a scratchy, industrial green blanket, the skin of his hands and face showed grey against it.
He coughed a few times as he headed, still dripping from the shower, up the stairs.
Steve at least tried to keep it from sounding like an accusation, and Tony tried to keep from taking it as one.
You have done a great service for your country, and you shall have your final reward in your account on the morrow.”
He looked tired and ill, and Tony wanted more than anything to find him somewhere to lie down in the Clean Zone, to take care of him as Thor had done so many nights, but they had no time and Thor would not have welcomed it.
he thought.
Chills shook him and he was glad that the dim blue light made it hard to tell if the fluid seeping down his chest was blood or more black corruption.
He had handcuffed himself to a narrow water pipe and could not escape, though his mangled wrist and the dark clotted blood on his hand, the floor around him, and the sad remains of his somber dark suit testified that he had tried.
His eyes fluttered closed.
“It whispers, all the time.
“This place is so far off the ass end of the world it doesn’t even have a McDonalds.
“Thor, that thing isn’t anybody’s mother, OK?
“I have heat signatures on the infrared,” he said.
He didn’t want to go down there either.
He needed to get Steve alone, get past the Captain and try to explain.
“I’d like to know where those drains empty out,” Natasha said.
“Stark.
I…We need your help.
“You are too late, too late,” Machen crooned, his voice only partly human.
But I will wait until you are not in the suit and you’ve forgotten why, just to be sure it’s a surprise.”
But it’s creepy, isn’t it?
Though I could bring you a stuffed bear, if you require one.”
“Stay safe,” she said.
“I will recover,” Thor said.
Thor’s smile was pure indulgence, a sure sign that he did not even believe that the prototype could hurt him.
“I’m safe in the suit,” Tony told him.
“You missed your last check in.”
I’m just not sure he knows what he’s getting into.”
The agent sagged, the handcuff and his dislocated shoulder bearing his whole weight.
“Your godling hears it now.”
“He hasn’t woken up yet, but Dr. McCoy tells me that he’s starting to make progress and they think he’ll pull through like you did.”
You’re safer in there.
It was still almost impossible to see if the thing even had a central mass when it hit his helmet and latched on.
“Has that ever worked?”
Sadly, I built Waterbed Mode into the model with the roller skates, so that’s off line.”
“Fuck this,” he said to no one in particular.
He just wanted to hear it from Thor.
“I could ask you the same thing,” Steve said.
He shook Thor’s shoulder, light but insistent.
“One so ancient I do not even know Her name.”
Something went wrong with his team and got progressively worse.
The windows were so dark that they had to be covered or painted, and in the poor light he could barely discern the outlines of an angel and a lamb in the stained glass rosette above the door, as though whoever was in charge did not like to see the traditional images.
“Did you call in the cavalry?” Steve continued.
Steve put his shield over Sarah and himself and pulled her into the doorway of the house.
“Tony?
I’m not kidding,” Steve said.
Thor shoved it closer with a very meaningful look.
Jimmy managed not to jump too much despite the frayed state of his nerves.
His voice and the set of his neck were stiff and Tony longed to ask him to stay, but he couldn’t do it.
“It must have taken ages to gather all this,” Tony said.
Listen, I have to go stop the end of the world, but I want you to take care of my team.
He cuffed himself to that pole and waited for us.
“Did you guys open it?” Tony asked.
“Taking you back?”
The door to the stairwell was also jammed open and they started climbing down.
Dibs on the head.”
An enormous carved mural covered the side of the cavern with the grinning face of a massive black goat, horns curled into a sinuous twist.
“We want to find the missing people, and understand what happened here so we can stop it.”
Steve weakened as they got closer.
Who can say what will happen on the morrow?
No mistaking the rasp of a suppressed cough in his voice once Tony made himself listen for it.
Should be locked down tight with a retinal scanner, even if no one is home.”
The door slid shut after him and one by one the rest of the team pushed the scanner and got the green light until only Tony remained.
Tony swung the light around and black things scuttled away from it.
“I had to call all the way over to Charleston to get any info on this place.
The awful fleshy tendrils worked up his back to his neck and wrapped his helm.
They nodded to him when he entered, but there seemed nothing to say.
“You do that all the time,” Tony said.
Ropes of tentacles enveloped him, leaving little visible, and pinned him to the slimy carpet of fallen leaves.
Like dead fish or something.”
Some of the lines were cut and some black pigment rubbed into them, but others were the natural lines of coal, though he had never seen layers of strata like them in all his studies.
I…I called it the Thorbuster, but it’s really to neutralize any Asgardian level threat, and I would never…”
“Yeah we’re killing it,” Tony said.
He settled in to the work, calmed by the soothing routine of shifting and breaking and smoothing down a path.
What had seemed random scratches at first glance coalesced into something horrible.
Steve stood as well and Tony tried but failed to do the same.
“In Memory of the Old Crow Mountain Mining Disaster, 1903,” he read from the bronze plaque.
He skimmed the light over the ground and illuminated the bones of the lost miners, trapped down here a century ago.
I really am.
He hoped Fury would send someone to rescue Clint and Natasha.
You think he’s perfect?”
Steve stood on his left, still leaning on him, and on his right he could feel the forlorn weight of Mjolnir grieving as the earth breathed around them.
“Leave him for the moment.
He held Tony’s hand, but now that he was awake he could see that the burning numbness spread from an IV in the crook of his elbow.
“I knew the story about the lost miners, but…” he agreed, hating the tight breathlessness of his voice.
They did not speak of their lost friends, nor the fate of the world, the missing people, or of themselves.
Tony paused at the door.
The picture flickered even though Tony had triple checked the signal strength, and the audio hissed and crackled in a familiar way that he refused to contemplate too closely.
The pit itself stood open beyond a deserted guard tower and four wide-open gates.
Tony and Steve came to stand behind her, and Tony’s hand went out on its own to wrap around Steve’s waist.
He accepted the MRE from Steve and began the mechanical process of eating it.
“I really couldn’t say,” Steve said.
Tony paused, shocked by the look in his eyes.
“We are all meat for Her feast!” Machen raved.
It doesn’t really get it across.”
“You will be later,” Steve said.
“Let me try,” Thor said.
“Stay with me,” Tony said.
It seemed, in a horrifying echo of his memories, like it would rip him apart.
He leaned forward until his head was between them, gleaming hair filling Tony’s peripheral vision.
Just get it done quick and clean and come back, and if it maybe isn’t possible to salvage the place, I would not weep for its tragic loss.”
Tony got a breath of cold mist, heavy with the rotten taste of autumn, and he gulped at the rushing air like the sweetest of wines.
Maybe it was the depth, or the solitude getting to him.
The beams of light couldn’t penetrate to the far wall.
Hang… hang on…”
“Besides, if it’s terrestrial, there could be more of them somewhere else.”
“Mother.
We have to make sure there aren’t any other survivors.”
Jimmy crossed himself and whispered a prayer, though he’d never felt so far from his mother’s God before.
“It is in the mine,” Thor said.
I can start the drip on both of us, and you three will have about twenty hours to solve the problem.
Actually he thought they were Men In Black types, black helicopters, tinfoil hats, the whole works.
“He’s Asgardian, he won’t be affected.”
His mini laser gouged a long line into the wall and Tony was glad that the place wasn’t on the historic register.
“There’s something wrong with this place,” Clint told him.
One latched onto his right gauntlet and knocked his shot wide.
Tony longed to make a sex joke about coming in the rear, anything to break the weird tension, but Steve hated it when he brought up their personal life on missions.
“What’s your call?”
I should never have brought him to this godforsaken place.”
“I have something to report,” Tony said.
They went out the heavy door and it sealed behind them, leaving Tony alone in the Clean Zone.
“I think I found the man who did the digging.”
I’ll take Thor and Iron Man to the Buckman residence and see if we can talk to anyone.
“What the fuck died down here?”
Missiles?
He took a handkerchief out of one of his suit pouches and held it in front of his mouth.
Steve still tried to apply pressure to the hole she’d shot in her belly, but more and more blood spread over the bowed boards and dripped over the top stair.
“So?” Steve said.
“You don’t have to go into the darkness,” she said.
At the far end, a serious set of metal doors stood gray and immovable and the controls for them included a glass plated hand scanner.
He took a step closer.
She stepped into the pool of moonlight from the window and the curve of her heavily pregnant belly came into view, swathed in a loose pink nightgown.
“Yes, but it was just the same shit we’ve been finding everywhere.
“Doesn’t have the same ring to it, does it?”
Thor looked pensive for a moment, and Tony noticed a faint sheen of perspiration on his upper lip and forehead.
“But I do not think it should be here.”
Something softer than bone crunched and squelched beneath him and he sprang back to his feet with nothing on his neck, looking for Steve.
“I will stay with them until it is time to depart,” Thor said.
“You don’t think that’s what he was really doing?” Tony asked.
You say the nicest and least coherent things.”
“Christmas is sooner.”
Did I teach you that one?”
“But what did he want to warn us about?
His suit wouldn’t open.
She did not sound curious, only tired.
Tony turned and in the spotlight of the beam he saw Thor, now only one step from the edge.
Have we gotten anywhere yet?”
Want to shake hands on it?”
More of the tentacles punched out of the man’s mouth and a spray of broken teeth clicked against the floor.
“But no way am I tired enough for that yet.
He let Steve’s hands hold his own, though they radiated a deep cold up his arms and into his heart.
The quiet gets to you, and then that shit is even worse than the silence.”
Tony turned back to where he’d left the doctor, determined to get something useful out of him.
He hoped the abyss wasn’t literally bottomless.
Thor still lay where he’d fallen and Steve lowered them both to the ground next to him.
Thor struggled and Tony could see the muscles in his arms strain to pull away, but the thing continued to draw him deeper in, closer to its center.
Shadows shifted and waved madly as the writhing tentacles roped and bound Thor, so the horror of the scene had a slow-motion strobe effect.
His voice had gotten stronger and he used the wall and Tony to pull himself to his feet.
Tony shut the door behind them and Thor led the way out, past the dim vivisection room with its record of nameless horrors to the more neutral research room beyond.
“Don’t listen to it, Thor,” Tony said.
What is that saying you told me?
Loathsome ropy tendrils held them, burrowed into mouths and eyes and navels.
“But there is an empty seat since Bruce remains behind.”
“We were going to ask you earlier, but things got a little hot for a bit and we haven’t had a chance.”
Its weathered sign proclaimed it the Crow Mountain Mining Company Store, and it might have been abandoned along with the entire company store system, but the old manual gas pump out front had current prices, a satellite dish protruded from the roof, and a small neon Budweiser sign still glowed above the door.
At about the same time, he made this recording.”
“It’s not alien.
But if we can’t, you had better be ready to bring this mountain down.
But you can’t hear it, can you?”
Dr. McCoy is working with the data you sent earlier, and I have new reports from the Captain to show him as well.”
He woke up the computers and found the familiar hum comforting.
Turn the light back off.”
The whole room was swathed in white plastic and biohazard symbols, but Steve wore soft cotton scrubs and a bracelet with his name on it.
“Somebody had the money to build this house, and if there was coal in the mountain, it made somebody wealthy.
To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”
A strong hand tugged his face plate open and he was able to spit and retch the black jelly from his throat and nose.
“What the hell can block them?”
His shield cut through the tentacles that held Tony and the suit’s systems came back online rapidly as they fell away.
“What did you find out?”
Steve held him in place from behind and Thor pulled them both as close as possible.
But I’m the only one.”
When the jet was nearly ready, Thor flopped into the empty spot and set his hammer between his feet.
“That isn’t the point.
“What should we do?” she asked.
“Oh, I know.
“We won’t.
Whatever had been there seemed to have burst, leaving jelly like slime in the center of the table and a radius of dark cast off droplets against the burnished metal of the walls and ceiling.
“Is something wrong?” he managed to ask.
Anything that leaves the area is going down.”
It struck the old man in the narrow remains of his chest and bounced back.
His suit reported that the temperature had fallen to thirty-six degrees since sunset, though the cold didn’t bother his teammates.
“Stay here, then,” Steve said.
Whatever is left of it.”
“But this place is creepy,” Clint said.
“He’s right,” Steve finally agreed.
The sound popped and crackled every few seconds as though the machine that recorded it, or the machine that now played it back, had struggled to render what the agents had heard.
She’s supposed to be in bed.
He felt the need to hear her voice, was all.
“Not forced,” she reported.
A hunting party went up there in the eighties and never came back.
Have... Have you seen Nat?” Tony asked.
“Three days ago, Agent Barton, we sent a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to have a look around.
“There’s something I want you to listen to.
“Hey,” he said.
Cold, filmy moonlight shone on the old house, but no light came from the windows.
“That is better than nothing,” Thor said, though he looked disappointed.
He found Steve and Thor in their makeshift hospital, watching over the still bodies of Clint and Natasha.
The hissing continued in this entry, but much louder, even though he had not changed the volume.
“I recognize the artist,” Steve continued.
Jimmy widened the opening, keeping an eye on his improvised meters and gauges for instability or poisoned air.
“If Thor tries to return, I have authorization to send up Lt. Col. Rhodes in the Thorbuster prototype.”
“The experience was most unpleasant, as is our continued presence here.
Tony spent the longest fifteen seconds of his life without even breathing.
A portal yawned beyond Thor, draining the god as it had drained so many others.
“We’re…”
“They don’t have restraints good enough to hold me,” she whispered.
No one was supposed to know about it.
Increase the range, override the simple commands with his own, that kind of thing, and develop the tech they were building here at the same time so he would be immune to it.”
“Gone?”
“Stark, report,” he said.
They’ve been unaccounted for for over a week now, and we’ve got no ransom demands.
Someone has some pull, though, to convince my superiors that it’s worth sending you lot.”
Even if it was the same endless, indifferent void he’d glimpsed through the portal, at least he would be with Steve, and not banished to the gloating darkness that consumed life and birthed endless horrors.
“You need to try harder,” Thor said.
The sound bounced strangely through the undefinable empty space and he knew with some certainty he shouldn’t be here.
But I’d like you to consider taking me back.”
Maybe he had told her about the…well not really a fight, per se.
Thor turned, pale and grey in the gloom, and caught Tony’s eye one last time.
Crow Mountain loomed beneath them, taller than the low green ridges around it.
“Why is this the only door that they shut behind them?”
“The new world will be born.
If that’s what it is?”
But I swear I can still hear it.” Thor asked.
I’m not long-term relationship material.”
“I do not need sleep.
Steve raised the shield to protect Tony’s face as well as his own.
Mother chose him.
Thor had said he would keep watch, but he and Tony both knew he wanted to lie down, and Tony let him.
Steve’s hands reached out of the chasm and beckoned him closer, and Tony took a step forward, then another.
Instead of grappling him as a fighter would, though, it only tried to hold his arm out of the way so the rest of it could seek his face and neck.
Voices, calling him here.
“Wait for us to get there.
“So how does an avant garde artist from New England end up doing a huge bronze for someplace so far remote as this?” Natasha asked.
“Clint is in there,” Natasha told him.
He took one last, dim look at Steve before the visor clicked shut between them.
The smoking stumps that still protruded from Thor’s wounds began to lose shape immediately, sublimating into gelatinous fluid and gas that drained from his body.
“Maybe to start with.
He almost got Thor.
They had not yet gotten to the final few sounds of the tape, and he was glad.
“Thor, stay with Clint for the time being.
“I hear my mother,” Steve said.
The man I was would even have been jealous, to have Her favor so callously transferred to another, after all my years of tireless work to find Her.
Thor’s body was alive, though critically wounded and weakened, but he had no idea how much was left of his mind.
“I do not fear death in our battles,” Thor had told him once, late one night while in his cups, “For my death is already foretold.
Sarah was in bed, of course, and she murmured sleepily when he joined her, a wordless question.
Change of plans.
“But still boyfriends?”
one knee.
“Hawkeye is down,” he began.
“I read you.
He just wanted his money and out of this hole for good.
His voice was calm, but Tony saw his intensity in the tension of his jaw and the tight line of his back.
“They are working on a treatment for it based on the information you were able to send back.”
That was the deal.”
He pulled his hand back to reach for something, fumbling at his suit coat, but whatever rode him drove away his last sane urge.
He only half paid attention as he flew, letting the scanners do most of the work for him.
He twisted in panicked revulsion to escape, but as the skin gave way his leg went numb.
“Come on, Big Guy, come back to me,” Tony said.
Don’t move around too much.
Tony thought of and immediately discarded a variety of questions, and they crunched their way over the broken glass in silence.
Though his sensors were gone, he could feel the armor failing, Mother’s tentacles peeling away his protections layer by layer.
By the last few, you can hear it distinctly.”
“I’m staying.”
He still had his hand at his temple, but his eyes were focused on Thor as though the darkness was no impediment at all, and he whispered and crooned tunelessly to himself.
Tony had not heard him cry out, and even the flickering light of his hammer had vanished.
I came back to warn you, you son of a bitch, in case She can use him like She did with all the others.”
“It won’t be in time,” Tony said.
Interns or something?”
The flat helm of his armor showed no expression, but Steve swore it did, able to read such minute changes in Tony’s voice and body language that he could usually tell what he was feeling even without seeing his face.
He guided Tony back to his pillows and pressed the bag into his hand.
You go ahead and turn in.
She warned me there would be struggle.
The swollen body was shown from the side but a dark pit yawned between the hind legs, the distended vulva picked out with vile detail, and from it dropped monstrous young, tangles of serpentine blackness that spread far past where he could see.
“I’d like to do more than that, once I can get out of this thing.”
Its reputation is pretty unsavory.
He removed what was left of his gauntlets, though Mother had done most of the work for him.
Come on, get in here.”
You can tell me what you are ready for, and I will respect your boundaries, even if you decide to break it off.
Tony had his database entry almost as soon as Steve finished speaking.
Tony started to think that maybe he would rather try to get his boyfriend to take him back.
Still cross-checking it.”
Tony tried to scan, but his equipment behaved strangely, giving back strange colors streaked with black instead of life readings.
His eyes slid closed and he waved them on.
He couldn’t wait to get away from Tony, it seemed.
The scent of coffee reached him as he crushed the pills in his mouth, the bitter burn of them spreading across his palate like a well deserved punishment.
Tony knew that Thor knew perfectly well what the altimeter was.
He had done that on purpose, as though Thor could still be protected if he diluted the sound somehow.
Tony raised his head and heard the sound of Mjolnir splintering trees in the distance and a low rumble of thunder as it came to a stop.
It was after one in the morning when he came out the mouth of the main shaft.
“They’d stay longer if you let them.”
“He doesn’t even know I have it.
“Because I care for you and your happiness, my friend.
Thor succeeded in cracking the ice between them, at least superficially, by the time they landed—mostly because he was willing to steamroller his friends with sheer charisma—but the rift was still there.
“But I want to know what’s going on here.”
His only thought was the white noise hum of the ventilation.
A plaintive psychic wail echoed through the cavern, but only in the mind, like a lost child crying in a memory.
Apparently he’d decided to look after Tony and that included making him eat some form of breakfast, even if it was already afternoon and he didn’t want it.
“And I hope you won’t think too badly of me if I admit I don’t want to go out there in the dark again.”
He felt a rising, irrational panic and longed to run, though the suit couldn’t turn in the tunnel and couldn’t be put in reverse without five minutes of cursing and a wrench to the drive shaft.
“Don’t be so dramatic,” Clint told him.
Thor launched into the air and thunder shook the mountain like an earthquake.
He unfastened the sealed ring around Tony’s bed and came in carrying a small paper bag in one hand..
It’s been here, too.
Clint tried the instrument panel and a row of fluorescent lights in the ceiling came on.
He had to know, but he suspected the dull ache of grief would spike sharp and piercing with the answer.
“These go back ages,” he said.
“We’re under quarantine,” he said.
His teammates had to be feeling the same thing, only worse.
I wouldn’t expect you to understand.”
Thor went stiff in his arms and Tony did not resist when he pulled away, though he did not go far.
Clint shrugged and rested his forehead on his hand.
He could tell that had been the wrong thing to say, because all it got him was Captain America back.
Thor, you have point.
A fine, cold mist of antiseptic surrounded them, and even though the filters in suit made it impossible, Tony felt like he could taste it at the back of his throat.
Tony turned one of his repulsors toward it and lit up the palm of his hand, primed to fire, as Doctor Machen at last made an appearance.
Steve smiled down at him and Tony could no longer remember why he’d been afraid of this.
He used his free arm to cover his eyes and struggled, blind, to cross the room.
And his wife… we lost her, too.
“I found out who was really controlling this place, who at least who thought they were.”
Tony switched it off in a hurry.
“Hang on, Big Guy!” Tony called, but even as he approached it moved to claim Thor.
If it’s abandoned, we’ll find whatever intelligence is around and come back here to plan a trip into the mountain.
The prickle and burn spread from both thighs up into his belly and from his right armpit into his chest.
He used the reactor in his chest to illuminate the scene and he and Steve moved forward in practiced unison.
“Not…not really,” Steve said.
He nearly had to force the ancient register, but he was not surprised to find a few crumpled bills and yellow carbon copy receipts inside.
He clamped the metal arms around the stone and shifted it off the brittle skull.
he thought.
“Can’t get it past the doors.”
He’d been thinking it for a while now, but hadn’t wanted to give it voice.
“Suit yourself,” Steve said.
There are entries in his recorder, but they are less than helpful.
“The answers we seek,” Thor said.
“Natasha and I brought back what little we could find in the library and records, but I want to know what was going on up here, and who was funding it.
Tony was tempted to take the Thor-sized dose and was even scooping them up, but he thought of Steve and stopped.
Tony thought not; if he had known, he felt sure he would have kept the gun close enough to use on himself.
It set him on an even, sloped surface, a tunnel or trench so narrow that he could brush both sides with his fingers.
I can get it to open without your signature persuasiveness.”
Tony didn’t have time for this now.
“And my lovers rarely stay long,” Thor pointed out.
“Why?” Tony asked.
He’s right here,” Sarah said, while at the same moment Tony put it together.
He steadied himself against the cavern’s wall with one hand and held the other out, palm up like a prayer.
I can let Thor have a crack at it, see if his Allspeech can get anything out of it.”
“Give me some light, both of you.”
He shook Thor’s shoulder, gently at first and then with more insistence, until his blue eyes cleared and he shook his golden head.
The overall impression it gave Tony was of an imposter, a camouflaged predator trying to masquerade as something harmless and familiar.
The place is government affiliated, contractor I think, and I haven’t been able to get much even unofficial on what goes on down there.
“Yeah,” Tony said.
“Tony, this is not your fault.
“I don’t want to let him get close enough.
“Fury says they are working on a treatment.
The phone was in his hand; he didn’t remember putting it there.
He grabbed for it, ready to hurl it against a wall or stuff it under the mattress just to restore blessed silence.
The disinfectant sprayed at such high pressure that it dislodged stains and scoured the blood and gore off the concrete, until it ran off the middle of the room into drains at either side.
“We’ll keep regular comm check-ins,” Steve said.
“Yeah.
“Sorry.
He focused on the details.
“But none are so stubborn as the Mighty Thor.”
He hoped Steve would be all right if he didn’t make it back.
He heard his mother’s voice calling his name, far away and faint as a memory, and he struggled harder, thrashing in vain with the tiny bit of strength he had left.
Jimmy didn’t believe he gave a bent nickel about the lost men from the turn of the century, any more than he’d cared about the bizarre chain of misfortune that had followed every crew he’d brought down here to clear the abandoned shafts.
The darkness breathed around them.
“I am chosen,” he said.
Though it seemed like for every one he severed, two more appeared, Tony freed one of Thor’s arms before he and Steve were overwhelmed.
Sarah leaned against one of the support posts and looked into the distance.
Tony turned also, and as he did the bright light of his armor swept across the tunnel.
Even the morning frost was not crisp here, but formed a rotten cobweb film over the damp brown carpet of leaves.
“Don’t come any closer,” Steve said.
“Hold on, Sarah,” Steve was saying, “Stay with me.”
“Look,” Thor told him.
He felt his face grow pale inside the suit, because he had never shown Clint the dead agent’s logs, or let him hear the strange recordings.
He longed for some dynamite and a crew of miners to speed things up, but the old machine— Hammer Tech with the serial numbers filed off, if he wasn’t mistaken— got him through the thick slabs and drifts of gravel left by the long ago cave in.
He held Tony in the curve of his body, careful of the tubes and monitors and bandages, and cradled Tony’s numb arm in his lap.
“December 19, 1938,” Steve said.
“Steve, get her out of here!
He would rather fly, but there seemed no point in wasting the suit’s power just to avoid a few awkward minutes with Steve.
Put that in to get access to his secondary programming, and tell him “Santa Claus is not real” and he’ll give you the information for the rest of… Everything I’ve got that you can have.”
Steve ducked without needing a warning and Tony shot it, burning through part of it so a chunk landed behind Steve with a wet plop.
Fortunately, they set off fireworks to remind him to buy Mister Fourth of July a birthday present.
Thor is fucking compromised.
“I should take you somewhere nice to celebrate.”
Whatever had been working its way out of her made one last effort, grasping and straining for the outside world, but it fell limp and began to disintegrate.
“I wouldn’t expect you to,” Fury said, but Tony cut the connection.
He went through the complex process of leaving the bubble and sealing it after himself.
The balcony door was open, admitting a clammy, foggy draft.
“If we don’t make it back.
He didn’t have words for this, but at the same time the black goat felt familiar, as though he should have recognized it, known its name.
“I take it he didn’t live in town,” Steve said.
We have men on the ground blocking the roads and the Helicarrier is en route to patrol the sky.
Clint tossed and moaned in a heavy bed.
As Steve reached inside, Tony realized that Agent Carlton had been preparing himself, alone, in here about the same time that Steve had been asking him to move in together in New York.
“What is it, Nat?” Steve asked.
“He’s not the one I don’t have faith in,” Tony said.
They filed cautiously out of the jet, Steve in the lead, and no one came to greet them.
Tony asked.
The light over the sensor turned red.
“What happened to the others?” he asked.
Thor nodded and crouched next to Clint.
Across the concrete floor from Agent Carlton, Steve spotted the dark gleam of his field recorder.
But you won’t like it.”
Black flecks stained his lips and his voice gurgled with wet choking.
You do not wish to shack up with him?”
“Thor…”
He sat at the computer instead and tried to focus, though his ears strained to try to keep track of what Steve was doing behind him.
“How does one ‘sort of’ make up with a lover?”
“Do you truly wish my assistance, or did you want to allow the Captain some time with his friend?” Thor asked.
Six days ago all communications from the facility ceased and someone is getting antsy about it.
His pallorous, grey tinged face was hard and closed off with suppressed pain, but he managed a smile for Tony.
The thought of losing him entirely was much the same, but he thought he’d told Thor last night that all paths seemed to end with him losing Steve.
“Fine.
“I’ve got this,” Steve said, though he did not take his eyes off the monsters.
But I’m no stranger to stuff like this, Tony.
“Yeah.
Tony brushed the hair back from his forehead as tenderly as he could manage with the armor’s gauntlets.
Black tentacles began probing at the eye slits and seals and Tony lost visual and auditory communication with his team as his armor activated various defense systems against it.
It’s been a long time since I was part of an ‘us’.”
“There will be.
“You only delay—“ but Steve cut him off.
“Thor would…he will understand,” Steve said through the comm link.
He saw a young man, with fear creeping in his eyes.
“Says who?
Tentacles began working their way up his armor, caressing him and probing for weakness, vulnerable places where they could gain access to meat and marrow.
He thought he heard his mother again, behind him, and he turned around to look for her just as he stepped off the ledge into the lightless abyss of the chasm.
He leaned in closer and longed for the familiar touch of Steve’s lips on his, but his visor snapped shut again with a decisive
“Mother!”
He waded in with Steve behind him and this time, the remains of the research team had no chance to gain an upper hand.
“I couldn’t hear you,” Tony said.
“Nay, if I am honest.
We don’t know how it’s spread.
It is more of a luxury for me.
You and Thor go on ahead and we’ll take the car.”
Right before Thor…”
“You still have not talked to him,” Thor said.
He followed the sound of Steve’s coughing, wheezing and asthmatic.
Tony wondered what, if anything, might have taken the elevator.
Your version will be better than what happened.
“We were all very frightened,” Thor murmured.
“I like Squirrel Girl,” Thor shrugged.
He wanted to warn us.”
The blue light of the arc reactor made the dark streaks of gore on his red cape stand out in stark contrast and gave his skin the grey pallor that Tony dreaded.
This hillbilly Satanist…thing?
“But I doubt I ever will be.”
“What’s through here?”
To his relief, he did not see a single hint of grey in his veins or any other sign he was less than perfect.
“I doubt we will find anything,” Steve told him.
A little sign on the front door of the house said “Back in 15 Minutes” but there were two trucks with current plates in the small gravel parking lot.
An especially thick tentacle worked free of the others, up and over Thor’s unprotected face.
Beyond it he could see a dirt road littered with broken bottles and cigarette butts that led to the peeling plastic and aluminum hulks of trailers and old modular houses.
“I think so,” Tony said.
“You’re on the Helicarrier.
Let Her feed… I will go to you, Mother.
“For how long?
Either way, Machen said there was more of it trying to come through from somewhere else, and we have to make sure that doesn’t happen.”
“Not my mother.
He’s been bothering HYDRA and organizations like it for decades to get a facility here, and when the CIA built one for him, he finally got someone to listen.
Steve smiled fondly.
“It’s PB and Js for everyone.”
Be careful.”
Lightning crackled down the walls of the cavern on all sides and Thor’s eyes glowed blue-white as he called the full power of his storm.
Don’t we have someone else to go look?
“Like dead fish, but worse.
“It is cold, at least,” Thor offered.
“Let's see what he had to tell us,” Steve said.
It’s just a trick.
He heard Machen’s mad tittering as the great void pulled him closer.
Tony thought he could guess the answer.
“A minute or two.
Only the final digit looked fresh, as though someone in the town still bothered to change it to reflect births and deaths.
But after I stopped the audio… Steve, he could still hear the whispering.
“But that’s only four days before Christmas.”
“It seems not.
His last entry says: ‘It’s in me now.
The standard Avengers communicator was designed to beep with a steadily increasing volume until answered; by the time the sound penetrated Tony’s skull it could probably be heard in New Jersey.
The double gates stood open despite their razor wire crown and severe notices about trespassers.
He held out his hand and for a moment Tony thought he would stroke her hair, but he seemed to think better of it and gripped her shoulder instead.
He cut the audio with as much haste as he could, but Thor continued to stare into the distance, mumbling the rough, heavy syllables of his own tongue.
“I hate to leave them here,” Steve said.
“We have to get her out of here,” Steve said.
“This damn thing,” he muttered.
“Can we?
“I’m sorry,” Tony told him.
Steve was fully encased in his own set of armor, one hundred percent Captain America, and he gave Tony nothing more than a nod of greeting, with perhaps fractionally less eye contact than he made with the others.
“Thanks, Captain Wikipedia,” Tony quipped, but the look Steve shot him said he was far from forgiven enough to tease.
He did not waste time with the hows and whys of their history, because they were already out of time.
He wanted to blame the moonlight, or the blue tint from his visor, but Tony could still tell that all the fluid was too dark, and too thick.
“You need to.
What was left of the SHIELD team crouched against the far wall, to the left of the doors, and he sobbed in the harsh light.
Jimmy Buckman knew he’d cleared the right tunnel when he started to find bone.
He put the phone down with a sigh.
“Steve, there’s just one thing I want to tell you.”
“Are you hurt?” Steve asked.
Soon they fell quiet and broke down into formless lumps of sludge.
The wind shook the tree tops closer to the house now and the branches rustled.
“Nope.
Get Rhodey into the Thorbuster and tell him… Tell him I said not to scratch the paint.
“Do not proceed until we reach you.”
He was
Just mice in the wires, that’s all.”
Tony held his hair back for him as he wretched and wished he could banish the clumsy gauntlets.
Maybe it’s something… Something like you,” he finished.
He was sort of counting on it, actually.
He closed his eyes and wished he were a praying man.
Steve and Thor tore it away from his face and held it between them.
“Don’t wrap it around a tree or anything.”
He didn’t say anything about how they were supposed to wait but Tony could hear the annoyance in his voice.
He sank into one of the uncomfortable swivel chairs, dwarfing it with his size.
It was only a matter of time before his frantic scanning distracted him from a closer danger.
You have a briefing fifteen minutes ago.”
Hawkeye shook his head, his short blonde hair plastered to his head with sweat, as though to clear it.
Shadowy tendrils reached out of the chasm before him, more than he could count, moving like smoke.
Clint too.
The bright light made it more disquieting than the semi darkness had.
“Keep an eye out for anything that might be a threat.
“I had typhus and pneumonia at the same time.
Steve seemed, for the moment, to have forgotten the night before and even the anger and panic of a few minutes earlier in his curiosity.
He fired the jets on pure instinct, but the snare induced total vertigo, unable to fall or fly.
“There’s no wind,” he said.
They landed at the base of the stairs, an unknown number of floors beneath the surface, at another open door that should have been locked.
Tony could, with the sensors turned up, faintly hear something from the other side, a hiss of metal scraping metal and a soft clink at uneven intervals that made him think there was something human causing the noise.
“What the
No one wanted to get into the elevator; it went without saying.
He lowered his arm, but he still kept his eyes turned away from the emergency lights.
“And we will do our best to find your husband.”
At the bottom of the plaque, true to Steve’s artistic opinion, small letters said the statue had been created by an H. A. Wilcox of Providence and dedicated 1934.
It writhed on the concrete in its vile amniotic fluid, a ball of sinuous appendages, and even though it had no sign of a face, it shattered the silence of the abandoned lab with a deafening psychic wail.
She got him.
Steve placed him in Thor’s grip and he wrapped his one responsive limb around Thor’s waist.
They had all frozen and seemed to struggle to keep their weapons raised.
An over life sized bronze sculpture of a man dressed in miner’s overalls knelt on top of another piece of weathered, black-striped green stone.
As he trudged back up the marked and stabilized shafts, he realized that he had no idea if the sun would be up when he got out, but he hoped so.
But I don’t know how Wilcox could have been connected, unless it was through his family or something.
The man had been a monster long before he’d come to this mountain, and a fanatic, but Tony thought he had always been a coward as well, someone who never wanted to get his own hands dirty, and he might still be capable of feeling fear.
“How far back do they go?”
Still nothing.
Thor was with him.
Finally he thumbed the buttons too quickly to let himself think and listened to his heart beat louder than the ringing of the phone.
“I don’t know what’s gotten into this thing.”
He stopped briefly to vomit just inside the entrance to the mine, but waved Tony’s hand off.
I will cut off your Starbucks card.”
But She has shown me the world to come, and She will need more strength than this old husk can provide to give birth to it.”
Steve’s bangs flopped into his eyes, undisturbed.
He didn’t want to let Thor hear it either, if he were honest.
He raised his left hand, took the glove off, and placed it against the glass sensor on his side of the barrier.
Hundreds, or even thousands, of victims, picked clean and left to rot.
“As far as we can go with mortal aid.”
When Steve heard the heavy step of Tony’s metal boots, he straightened up and forced himself to stop, but not before Tony saw him force himself straight and swallow hard to keep it in.
“I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
Tony increased the audio and heard that it was not German he spoke, but some much more ancient and foul tongue that human mouths had never learned to truly replicate.
He was getting to the point where even bodies would be reassuring.
“Come into the darkness from whence you were born.
The back of the room was similar but the table had no restraints and faced a half dozen morgue style drawers.
“What is it?” he asked.
“So I told him he had his answer.
I know you’re a genius and all, but it’s not going to help anything if you get yourself killed.”
He took his normal seat but the air between them was tense with the things they weren’t saying.
Come on, we still have work to do.”
“Hey, if we all live through tomorrow, I’ll take you to the place Thor found in Iceland.
“What did they do at this lab?
Steve didn’t argue with him any further, and Tony heard the cot creak as he settled in.
I can’t be sure.
As soon as it clicked back into the cradle, the ringing stopped upstairs.
“Stay there,” Fury said.
“Steve…”
“We hear you, Nat, go ahead,” Steve said.
Even on full power, the light he threw into it vanished without touching the other side.
I’m stuck up here until my blood work comes back clean, but every time they test me I’ve gotten more of it out of my system.”
He walked to the chair and sat in front of the sleeping computer.
What did he want to say?
With Steve’s help, Thor sat against Tony’s left side and peered at them, his face still gray and cadaverous in the darkness.
Let’s go save the world,” he said, and Tony let it drop.
Against the wall a set of refrigerated cases hunched dark in the dim flouresent light.
“I didn’t think he was that into it.
Drinking.
Tony struggled to sit up and several monitors began to beep in distress, but he did not care.
“What are you going to wear in the meantime?”
The door wasn’t even locked.
“What if there is no later?”
He had Steve alone, at least for the moment, and he knew he should take advantage of that.
“Over here,” came back the response.
Tony, you cannot mend this unless you come to a consensus with yourself.
The safety line slithered and went taut with a hiss, and he felt absurdly disappointed for some reason when it caught him.
Though Steve kept them at bay with his black-streaked shield, they drove him closer and closer to the edge.
We’re going to talk about everything else when we get back.”
“Sounds like we’ll have to take the long way back up,” Steve said.
It was not quite so distinct this time, muffled by his helm and distorted through the tinny speakers on his armor.
He held the haft with both hands for an instant, eyes closed as if in prayer, but something even stronger than his bond to his weapon pulled him away.
Putting his hands on the surface took all his will, as the stone was in shadow and he couldn’t see what he was touching.
In the dim blue light, Steve’s eyes were in shadow as he looked into the abyss.
And she’s not supposed to be inside the bubble.”
He was…He’s your friend too.”
Black, sludgy fluid seeped out slowly and the bit of brain visible appeared shrivelled, dry and grayer than a lab specimen, but Machen still tittered and chuckled to himself.
They followed her back into the unsecured part of the lab.
He shut his eyes for a moment and braced himself to deliver the news.
Steve liked the bad news first.
“No.”
“We will be there in less than five minutes,” he said, and cut the link.
“I’m going back up to the jet to check in with Fury.
A spray of black liquid hit the wall behind it and the scream stopped.
“There’s only three of us.”
“It’s blank?” Steve asked.
They did not see Steve but it felt as though he walked behind them, their shared affection for him like a physical presence.
Even the armor couldn’t entirely stop the thing’s screaming from reaching him.
“What?” Steve asked.
Electricity crackled over the black coils of it and it emitted another scream that he heard deep within his mind as it began to smoke.
“Will you be OK down here?”
“It’s not your fault,” he said.
“I’ll…I found some IV Haldol.
He tried for a reasonable tone of voice, but suspected he had failed to achieve it.
“What did they do to me?”
The thought that Carlton might have secured himself to the post in the hope that his rescuers would be in time to save him, or at least take his report, hurt even more than the idea of his despair.
He didn’t even scream as he went over.
“It sounds like voices.”
“Just play it.
“And that would kill you,” Steve said.
It’s been worse since they built the lab, but it goes back as far as you can find.
Steve left and was gone for over an hour, and returned with his face white with anger.
“But you are a defender of Midgard, and my friend.
The fleshy, rot-soft lips of the portal shivered and parted further, and Machen capered at the gate, his mutated limbs rolling with the fluid grace of the deep ocean.
He started coughing again and had to support himself against the damp rock.
Probably not, actually.
“I’ve got its bio signature now,” Tony said.
“You did?
The great World Serpent will rise from the depths and I will wound it mortally.
And he could hear her calling from beyond the stone, deep within the house, deep within the earth.
The light in his chest flickered back to life as his heartbeat stabilized, diffused and unfocused after the damage to the chestplate and housing, and the suit began trying to eject the sludge that clogged the exhaust ports and vents.
He didn’t say anything, you know how he is, but we need to act fast before they get any worse.
He was the first to see Her.”
He heard another knot of fighting off to his right and turned the beam of light toward the sound.
Tony put as much skepticism into his voice as he could manage.
He had, on several sad occasions, scanned a woman after fetal demise, and she did not match that pattern either.
Thor and Tony turned and walked to the corner so they could see what he had found.
This is more “little gray men doing butt stuff to yokels” territory, but we’ve heard of parasitic offworlders before.
Steve and Thor’s breath drifted away in little puffs as the mountain air stole their warmth and they all trudged along the road to the mine in a huddle.
“Hey shit head, how’s it going?”
“He’s not my type anyway. As I said to Steve earlier today, I’ve got a thing for leggy blonds,” Tony quipped, enjoying the sound of Steve choking on his drink, again.
“Peg, it’s fine, really. Go make sure Nana and Sharon are alright. I’ll keep her as long as you need me to.” Steve said, taking a bag of what Tony could only assume were items for the child. He stood there awkwardly for a moment, as ‘Peg’ finally turned to look at him.
The somewhat playful smile Steve had on his face fell immediately, as he started to put the pieces together.
“Tony do you hear yourself? This is ridiculous!” Steve said, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Steve immediately caught Natasha’s eye in the rearview mirror, the two of them exchanging a look. He was fully aware she knew exactly why he was so excited.
“Well,
“Steve, she’s here. Our little Mason Alexandra...she’s here, and she’s beautiful. They have to take her away to let Bruce set her up in the NICU, but my god, Steve...our daughter is absolutely perfect.”
The omega messaged. Within a few seconds he got a text back from Carol.
“Of course you were the football captain,” Tony muttered seemingly louder than he’d intended. Steve gave him a puzzled look, to which Tony responded to with an apologetic smile. “Sorry, continue.”
anyone? Sam or Clint would have helped if you had asked! Wait...is this why you had been so sick beforehand? Did you know you were going into heat?”
“Did you mean what you said earlier?” Steve asked, in a small voice.
Tony grabbed the keys from his desk and threw them at Peter in a huff. “Here are the damn keys, kid. You’re lucky I don’t find a way to fail you.”
“Who is she?” Howard asked, keeping his voice as calm as possible, which Tony knew meant trouble.
“Yes, pwease,” Cora responded before yawning. Tony could tell she was getting tired, so he made sure to take it easy as he moved across the living room to sit right in front of Steve.
"Oh come now, I'm not that bad once I've gotten a few drinks in me."
“I’ll say! MJ and I have a pretty solid idea for the bot we’d like to build. I can’t wait to get started!” Peter said, excitedly.
“…So maybe everything won’t be our standard procedures of operations.”
Initially, Pepper disregarded the question as she moved her things.
“Yeah it’s...it’s a lot bigger when it’s just me here all by myself,” Tony answered, now feeling like he’d exposed too much of himself than he’d originally intended.
“Steve, hey!” Tony said loudly, waving as he made his way over. “Don’t you look spiffy,” the brunet observed.
They got a booth in the back, where they always sat the people with little kids, and skimmed the menus.
“No,” Tony answered, desperately hoping that Steve would believe him.
“Just trying to remember a time when I was this happy.”
Steve’s hair was an absolute mess, his skin was drenched in sweat and his pupils were blown wider than Tony thought possible. Simply put, he looked like he’d been wrecked.
“You alright over there babe?” Steve asked, slightly concerned.
After their trip, Tony’s collection of oversized sweaters mysteriously managed to make its way into his closet at the tower, though now they seemed to be a staple in Steve’s wardrobe more than anything else. Tony wasn't complaining, though. After all, a deal is a deal.
When Steve had offered to be the robotics team assistant coach, he honestly thought it was just going to be soccer for robots. But after watching a handful of matches from the previous year, he soon realized just how unique this was. The students had to build and program these machines, then guide their bots through soccer-like games. It wasn’t just a matter of who scored the most goals so much as it was about who built the best bots that were up to the task. The nuance and skill that was required of these teens was nothing short of astonishing. He wasn’t entirely sure why Tony had agreed to let him be his assistant coach, but Steve was a little more than proud knowing that with his background in strategy he was able to offer something of value to the team.
“I’m sure a lot of that is coming from the fact that I’m carrying his baby, more so than anything else.”
“Where will you be staying? Not in that concrete box of a dorm room. I will never understand what that idiotic university of yours won’t let someone of your talent live in a better dorm.”
When they got to the apartment, Tony looked for a place to park. Steve assured him it would be okay to just drop him off at the front of the building. The moment Tony put the car in park, Steve took off his seatbelt.
“You what?! Why didn’t you
The look on Ty’s face told Tony that the man would no longer be causing any problems. He clapped his hands together before standing. “Alright well, I’m done here, unless you have anything else to say, you’re welcome to go.” Tony walked to hold the door open, and smiled as Ty walked out. “Oh, shoot, I forgot one more thing, Pepper sends her regards and wants you to kindly fuck off.” He slammed the door without giving Ty a chance to respond.
“Ah-ahhh,” Steve cried out as he came untouched, ropes of cum shooting up and painting his belly.
Tony threw his head back and cackled. “I am willing to bet that never before has a person with a child referred to themselves as a sex noob.”
“Tony...I need—” Steve breathed.
“Well, it’s nice to know that you’ve got someone who’s
One would have thought that after an entire night of venting, Tony would have gotten over his tiff with Steve. However, Tony Stark has never been known to just let things go (he currently holds the record for longest grudge ever held). So Pepper knew that something was up when three weeks later, Tony was still griping about it.
The pair of them then went on to eat their meals in silence for a few moments, exchanging glances and smiles every so often.
“Tony I…I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Honestly, I was just kidding.”
“I know that, Stevie, I meant why don’t you take up bartending as a second job. I could teach you a few things to help fast track you through your certification.”
“Bruce, you said you were hungry, so I brought you to a place with food. Plus, I don’t have the key on me, so I can’t give it back today, but I’ll bring it with me next time for sure.”
“Not really, I’m kind of freaking out here,” Steve answered, honestly.
“You’re younger than I thought you would be when you called to make the reservation.”
“I need your help.”
. Staying in his cabin, serving his favorite dinner, wearing his sweater.
“Yeah, I’m okay. I’m sad to hear you won’t be around for Christmas, Coraline and I will miss you, but I’m sure you’ll find a way to make the most of your trip.”
here.”
“Come on sweetie, let’s get you changed for bed,” Steve offered, sweetly. Cora smiled wide at that, forgetting about the mean man who’d hurt her feelings only moments ago.
Tony accepted the sandwich, too distracted by his newly realized hunger to feel embarrassed by the loud rumble emanating from his stomach. He quickly took a bite of the food and let out a moan. “Good god, if I’d known this was all it took to get such deliciousness hand delivered to my classroom, I would have invited you to the workshop and told you all about my bad habits a lot sooner.” Tony smiled to himself at the way Steve looked away and blushed at that.
“Yeah, it’s that easy.”
“Pepper…”
“Oh uh...I thought we were supposed to start getting admin stuff done,” Steve asked more than stated.
“I know you know I do, but… I just wanted to say I love you and thank you for sharing this with me.” Steve looked down at him, a confused smile on his face, but gave one small nod.
“Well with you all dressed like that, I’m sure you’ll get so much candy tomorrow night!” Pepper offered, trying to ease Cora’s mood. It worked, as she turned to look at the red head with wide eyes.
“Tony, I’m so sorry--I should have known,” Steve offered, truly regretful.
Steve moved to walk behind her, thinking that he hadn’t been this nervous to meet with a principal since he was in high school himself.
“Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou” the blond repeated, planting kisses all over Tony’s face.
Steve didn’t even know where to begin with how embarrassed this whole situation made him, but he just tried to remind himself that there was a point to all of this. He went about his day, making an early dinner, watching a few shows, and catching up on some reading before resigning to just go to his room and get this foolishness over with. He pulled up a few Google searches to figure out exactly what he was doing. He then poured a small amount of each lube into his hands to figure out which one he felt would suit him best. After figuring everything out, Steve got himself situated with a video and ready to go.
. It took Steve a moment for his brain to reboot, but once it did, he walked over to wrap his arms around his boyfriend.
“It’s… it’s just a dick.”
“Look, I know you guys mean nothing by it, but it’s just...I don’t want to fuck this up by getting us in trouble for something we aren’t doing. So just...cool it on those kinds of jokes, okay?” Steve asked, now feeling a little drained from getting ready for his trip and dealing with his friends.
“You know how we talked about moving in together come the end of the semester?”
“It’s fine…” Tony answered, slowly withdrawing his hand from the table.
“Happy to help,” Steve said with an understanding smile. “It was pretty evident by the split second look of fear and annoyance, when that first guy introduced himself, that you didn’t really want to deal with that kind of stuff.”
,” Sam whined, “tell me who you have a crush on. Teeeeeeeell meeeeeeeee!”
He considered everything about the day that they had spent together. Steve was an absolutely amazing guy, but was he really ready to date a man with a child?
Tony wasn’t the only one who enjoyed having company around. Steve couldn’t say he always understood what was going on, but he liked watching Tony work so hard on things that really mattered to him. Steve knew that they had been spending a lot of time together in the workshop, but he didn’t notice just how long they’d been down there until Thor brought it to his attention.
Wow, okay, so this chapter is all Emily, you guys. I think I wrote maybe two scenes? This chapter is amazing and I just have to thank her for picking up my slack.
“No time to explain, I just need you to let me know whether or not Steve’s at work.”
“Nah, I should be good from here. Get yourself to the B&B I booked for you and rest up for your drive back to the city tomorrow,” Tony replied. Happy gave a nod before climbing into the car and heading off to his accommodations for the evening.
“Sandwiches okay?” Steve asked. Tony nodded halfheartedly. “Are you alright?”
“Why’d you buy the man a scarf?” Clint finished, abrasive as ever.
Steve let out a laugh at that, earning himself a faux astonished look.
Tony Stark was something else entirely.
“You shouldn’t.”
Tony looked up to see the judgmental look on Carol’s face.
When he opened the door, though, Tony’s eyes went wide in amazement.
“Anything on your mind?” Tony asked, noticing the strange look on Steve’s face.
Images of the fight he’d had with Tony flooded Steve’s mind, making the throbbing in his head from the budding hangover even worse. He needed water and he needed food, but getting up to get either of those things seemed like an impossible feat. As if on cue, a knock came at his bedroom door.
"Are you planning to open a smoothie shop in here?"
He quickly opened up the booklet to look at what Tony had left behind for him.
Once he and Cora were alone, Steve bounced her in his arms. “Wanna watch
“Who’s that?” Sarah asked, still smiling.
“Hmm, is everything alright.”
Natasha sat silently, letting those words sink in, but Steve could tell there was something she wanted to ask him.
It took Steve going home, unloading the groceries, and preparing the most intense fruit salad he'd ever seen in his life to realize that maybe he'd gone a little overboard and maybe he should have actually bought something dinner related. Unfortunately, this epiphany hit him all too late as he suddenly heard a knock at the door. He greeted Tony with a sorrowful and apologetic look.
Steve took a steadying breath.
Steve had usually appreciated this side of Natasha, but today, he genuinely wished she’d just let him be. He knew what was ahead of him back at his apartment and he didn’t want any part of it. Having to explain himself, what happened back in December, the feelings he’d been having for his friend...it was all too much right now. But some very small part of him wanted to reach out and ask Natasha to never leave his side. He’d been holding on to the secret of what had happened between him and Tony and he felt as though it had been eating him alive. Little did he know that feeling was just evidence of what had transpired between the two, growing for all the world to see.
Not much else needed to be said to convince Tony. He grabbed hold of his cock, gasping at the feel of his own hand. He lined himself up, noticing the fresh slick leaking out of Steve and thrust in. Both men moaned as Tony fully seated himself. He had to take a second to savor the feeling of the omega but once he wrapped his mind around what was happening, he lost himself completely in the moment.
“You know? What do you know?” Steve asked, clearly confused.
. In all their years as friends, Steve tried his best to look out for Bucky and protect him as well as he could. The few times that the roles were reversed and Bucky had been the one trying to hold it together for the both of them had been some of the toughest times in Steve’s life. He didn't want this...thing with Tony to be added to that list.
The pair of them sat there for a few moments, before the brunet clapped his hands together.
The hand on Steve’s back came to a complete stop at that.
, Barnes, so unfortunately you don’t quite fit the bill. But if things ever go south with the missus and you dye your hair, give me a call. I can’t promise I’ll actually answer but you’ll never know unless you try.”
Tony froze instantly at the question. No one but Bruce knew that Tony had held on to Steve’s apartment key after their break up. Initially, he’d blamed the high tension and emotions for his forgetfulness. However, once confronted with the reality that he needed to give back the key, Tony conveniently managed to leave the key at home every chance he got. He didn’t want to admit it, but he secretly hoped there would be a reason for him to use it. Though he knew that hope was far fetched, he still couldn’t bring himself to part with the key.
like me the same way.”
“Yes, you! We’ve been working in the same office for three years, and somehow it took a blizzard and a completely empty office for me to finally get your attention.”
Steve took a seat and watched as Tony pointed out different items and what they did. He’d shown the blond a raspberry pi (which indeed was not a dessert at all) that was used as the ‘brains’ of the bot, an arduino microcontroller and several other small components. After learning about what everything did, Steve decided to build around a raspberry pi with a camera that used visual input to help control the bot.
Tony pushed in, going as slowly as he could. Steve tried to hide the discomfort in his face but Tony knew. He leaned forward and placed light, butterfly kisses across Steve’s face. “I love you so much, Steve. So, so much.”
“In AA they say that the first drink gets you drunk. Once I start I don’t know if I’ll be able to stop.  I… want to. Fuck, I want to so badly. I don’t want to be a buzzkill but—”
“I really miss you guys,” Tony spoke, honestly. “I love you both and I can’t wait to talk to you again later tonight. Bye,” he waved, waiting until Steve ended the call.
“I’ve been alright...Look, I’m sure you know I’ve called you hear to talk to you about Steve,” Bruce stated, trying to tread as lightly as possible.
“Don’t think too hard or you two might hurt yourselves,” she joked, taking a swig of the beer before handing it to Bucky. “What are you two thinking up out here, anyway?”
The alpha cursed under his breath, which earned him a smile from the blond.
“Excuse you, vanilla is amazing and it goes well with every dessert.”
“I think, if Sarah were here, she’d tell you to stop being such a damn worrywart and tell the man that you love him. And you know, I tend to agree with her on that.”
“Not at all, please make yourself at home.” Steve answered, grabbing two bottles of water from the fridge.
Tony was floored. “Please.”
"James..." Natasha spoke in a hushed but angry tone.
“I’m not going to break. I promise. You can keep going.”
“Oh, well, at the time I thought I might be happier doing graphic design, but to tell the truth, I’ve really missed building web content for clients,” Tony answered, honestly.
“Lucky? I’m sure there are plenty of people that would beg to differ.”
With that out of the way, Tony flagged down a taxi, and once inside he began his nightly text conversation with Steve. When he finally got home, Tony immediately started on dinner, never once letting his phone leave his side.
“Are you sure? I don’t have to go in to work at the bar tonight, and I don’t have any plans with Bucky so I could stay if you wanted.”
“I love you too.”
Steve’s brow creased in confusion as he shook his head.
They continued on their way to the kitchen, and once there, Steve closed his eyes and breathed in, deeply, to take in the aroma.
“Hello sir, welcome to the Omni, how can I help you this evening?” the attendant asked, sounding chipper.
“I’d be happy to go if you’re in the mood for a drink, but being a recovering alcoholic, I try not to spend much time at bars if I don’t have to,” Tony said with a sad smile.
“That right there is our baby.”
“I mean there’s another topic but this one is more fun so we can stick with this for now,” Tony answered.
“No, but really though! Technically, Steve is Stark Industries property. Maybe I should let him know that I’m not above refreezing things that I own.”
Tony broke their kiss and began peppering a trail of love bites up to Steve’s ear. “If you don't mind,” he began to whisper, “I'm going to suck you off until you cum down my throat. Then I'm going to fuck you until you can't even remember your own name. Sound good?” Steve let out a needy whine before nodding his head. “Good,” Tony spoke into the skin of Steve’s neck, sucking a small hickey there before returning to the previous task at hand.
“Yeah, I...have too much snow out,” Steve internally cringed at how idiotic his response was. The confused smile on Tony's face didn't help any, either. Steve shook his head and tried again. “It seems like everything’s shut down, but I could have sworn the snow wasn't this bad an hour ago.”
“No, I’m here alone. Tony doesn’t know that I’m here right now, but he is the reason for my visit,” Pepper said, standing in the middle of Steve’s living room. This was the first time Pepper had ever seen his apartment, and Steve couldn’t help but feel a little nervous about it. His place wasn’t a mess by any means, but he was glad that Sam had picked Cora up earlier, giving him a chance to clean up the toys left lying around. There weren’t many; Steve was very particular about her putting her toys away.
“It’s a little bit of both,” Tony said, smiling at her as he poured her glass.
The three of them sat there quietly for a moment, trying to make sense of it all, before Nat moved to place a hand on Steve’s arm.
“Thank you so much, Tony. This is a big help,” Steve said, genuinely grateful for the gesture.
“Alright, well it was great to meet you, Steve,” Fury said, extending his hand one last time. “You should be hearing from us within the next two weeks about the position. And don’t worry, I’ll put in a good word.”
“He has always been extremely guarded. It took years of hard work, patience and love for me and Rhodey to get anywhere close to where you were in your friendship with him. I don’t even think
Once the elevator stopped, the voice returned. “We have arrived, Mr. Rogers.”
“Steve?”
Steve looked at him, beaming. “I think I’m okay with that,” he said before pulling Tony into another kiss.
“I’m saying it because it’s true,” Tony began, raising to his feet, trying to seem slightly angry.
“Can we go now? We should go now!” Tony said, practically bursting with excitement, legs still wrapped around Steve. As they made their way out to play indoor mini golf, Rhodey leaned in to Pepper.
Tony had been harboring the biggest crush known to man on Steve, the aforementioned asshole, since day one of the semester. It took all the courage he had that first day to ask Steve to be in his group for the (stupid and pointless) semester-long research project, but ever since then Tony had been dropping hints left and right that he was a little more than interested in the blond. However, no matter how badly it seemed he wanted to, Steve never reciprocated.
“Add dinner to that and I’d say you’ve got yourself a deal,” Steve responded, standing up and moving towards the door.
Steve took a moment to let everything sink in. He’d been trying so hard to take care of Coraline on his own, when Peggy had never intended for him to do so in the first place. She believed so completely in the love that he and Tony had that she left her daughter in their care, knowing that they’d be able to give Cora a life that she felt she couldn’t. That realization hit Steve like a ton of bricks, and immediately he thought back to the previous night. He’d been so heartless in how he acted towards Tony, and to kick him out after they’d had sex…
“Did you really rescue all those men from HYDRA?!?”
Steve had had a great time at work for his first few shifts. Though the lack of customers made things a little dull, he loved spending time with Clint, Sam and Natasha. In an unexpected surprise, he stumbled upon a customer who seemed to be having a rough night. Steve simply wanted to lighten the man’s spirits, but ended up thoroughly enjoying his company.
"I knew cravings were a thing but I had no clue that could be this adorable!"
date. That means I can’t actually tell you anything until we get there,” Tony answered, taking his eyes off the road for a moment to look at his boyfriend in the passenger seat. Steve had managed to nod off in the seconds it took for Tony to respond. He just smiled to himself, brushing a piece of hair off of Steve’s forehead before returning his attention back on the road.
“So, I don’t mean to ruin the moment,” Steve started, causing Tony to prop himself up on his elbow to look the blond in the face. “But you left for Christmas break without telling me where you went. You came back and you never talked about your trip. Now, you’re going ‘home’, wherever that is, and you’re not really giving me any information. What if something happens and I need to get ahold of you?”
“I think there’s a bar at the indoor market if you’re interested in a drink,” Steve offered casually.
as you couldn’t be real.” Tony said, rubbing his thumb over the back of Steve’s hand.  “But you are, and you’re so much better than I ever could have imagined. I just—my only hope is that you can forgive me, and give me another chance to show you how much you truly mean to me.”
Tony’s eyes narrowed and he bit the inside of his lip, considering what had just been said. After a moment, though, he gave a curt nod. “Alright.”
Steve had been so kind to them throughout their entire stay, even making a joke about some of the specials that they had. Tony had been so miserable all summer without Steve, but he’d finally found a way to get his fix. It seemed harmless enough in the beginning, Tony told himself he’d just stop in to the Olive Garden maybe once or twice every few weeks. But it only took two weeks for Tony to learn Steve’s schedule, and to show up every time he was working.
“This is literally still about you stealing from me. How do you keep forgetting about this?” Tony asked playfully.
“You’re a menace, all three of you. You’re all the absolute worst,” Steve mumbled angrily, fastening his seat belt. Tony barked out a laugh as he hit the gas.
“What the fuck, Carol, I literally talked to you earlier today.”
“I yelled at her, Buck. God I… she just wouldn’t eat her peas and she’d been so awful all day and I snapped. She said she didn’t like me anymore and that she wanted Tony and I lost it. How am I supposed to get through raising her alone the rest of her life when I’m already doing such a shit job only a few weeks in?”
“Okay ma’am!” Tony saluted. Steve handed over the present and Cora immediately grabbed it.
“Yeah, that’s not going to keep working, I hope you know that,” Rhodey replied taking a sip of his water.
“Babe, if you don’t stop I will turn this car around and drive us home.” Tony said through clenched teeth. He was trying his best to stay patient but Steve had been asking about their whereabouts constantly for the better part of two hours.
Steve gave a sad smile in response before sighing. “I just...I feel like I’m breaking my back just to barely scrape by. I know I could be doing something I actually enjoy that pays enough for me to be able to make ends meet and have a little extra left over.”
“I’m really sorry to do this, but Cora will be home soon. I want her to know that you’re back in our lives but I’m just not sure tonight is the best time.”
“Please, boy, sit down before you get too worked up. These people, you think you love them, and that they love you. But you know as well as I do, the second they find out who you are, who we are and all that you have, they’ll use you and rob you of all that you have.”
“Hold on.”
“I’m going to overlook you judging my taste in wonderful television programming, and just focus on the rest of your statement,” Steve said around a small laugh.
“Thank you for taking such good care of Tony.”
“I guess...I can try to have a good time...or whatever,” Steve finally gritted out. He rolled his eyes at the look of faux excitement on Bucky’s face.
Tony grinned. “I’ll take it.”
“Tony, I’m not busy, and I would love to come. Thank you for inviting me.”
“So the fact that you want to bang him has nothing to do with it?” Rhodey asked, lips quirked up in a small smile.
“Spot’s all yours,” Steve responded, sliding over to make room.
“Who said I liked Steve?! I never said I liked Steve!” Tony answered, frantically.
“Can I take off the blindfold?” Steve asked, perking up at Tony’s voice.
Tony was halfway out the door when Coraline made a sound. Tony turned around to see the baby’s eyes trained on him.
“Hey kid, why don't you take my keys and warm up the car, I've gotta get something I left in my classroom. I’ll be right back,” Tony assured, handing over the remote for the car.
“What are you talking about?” Tony asked, genuinely confused. “I don’t want the people I love most in this world to suffer.”
“Sounds like you’ve got a good thing going,” Sarah said, with a soft smile.
“What if we just… start over again?” Steve asked, as Tony moved to rest his head on his chest.
“We’ve been trying to take care of Cora as best we can for people in our situation,” Steve explained. Coraline was on the floor in front of them, playing with blocks. “Peggy lives at home with her sister, Sharon, and Grandma, so they’re able to help look after Cora while she takes night classes for nursing school. Then she comes to visit me every other weekend. That’s why the school allowed to let me live off campus as a freshman. You know, so I could take care of my daughter. I don’t get to see her as much as I’d like to, but I always have to remind myself that I’m doing this for her,” Steve said. He got down on the floor with her and took her in his arms. She giggled wildly and pretended to fight her way out of Steve’s grip.
“Tony, no. it has nothing to do with that…”
“Dere,” she announced. Tony plucked the marker out of her hand and added the “’s” to the end.
“Thanks Steve. I, uh… I’ll see you around,” Tony replied, with a small smile.
“Tank yew,” she giggled. “DADDY’S PRESENT NOW!”
They ate fairly quickly, shoveling down some bacon cheeseburgers and fries. Tony tried his best to keep any clues as to where they were out of sight, but the second they left the diner, Steve took a quick look around the parking lot.
“Ah, yeah, that. I told him that you’re a very special guy, and that all of us care about you. I let him know that if he was up to anything hinky that he’d have all of us to deal with, which I assured him he wouldn’t want.”
“I’ll let you have one if you promise never to judge me about my love for them ever again.”
Tony smiled and shook his head. “I love you, too. Let’s get some sleep.”
“Your cock feels so good, Tony, so fucking good,” Steve looked down at his lover as he spoke. “I love feeling you so deep inside me, filling me up. You’re the only alpha who could drive me wild like this, who could fuck me like this. Your knot is the only knot I need, and I need it,
“I always hated P.E.” Tony said offhandedly.
“Thanks for inviting me along this weekend. I learned a lot and I had a really great time.”
Steve had assured him that he was fine, that he was keeping busy and not to worry, but Tony couldn't help feeling guilty. This was their first real trip as a couple, and the brunet had spent almost half of it at work. At this point, he wanted nothing more than to just cuddle up next to his super soldier boyfriend with a nice hot drink in front of a roaring fire. Every second spent not doing that had Tony growing more and more impatient. Thankfully, he knew the ride wasn't much longer, as they made the turn onto the long road that led to the cabin.
Pepper led the way as they walked through the house to find Tony and Rhodey. Once they were all together, Steve immediately went for the brunet.
“Okay, nugget, time for bed,” Steve said after he wiped the potato from his face.
“Yeah,” Steve answered in a hushed voice, “As long as Tony is part of the package, I'm more than okay with anything else that’s included.”
“Because people have told me they’ve loved me before!” Tony shouted. “I’ve been happy and warm but I was nothing to those people. I thought I was in love with them but then I met you and goddammit, Steve. You told me you didn’t care what the internet had to say about me but I was so far into the lie that I couldn’t get out and every single time I went to say something,” Hot, angry tears were streaming down his cheeks now; “Every time I went to say something you got this look like I was special and that I was special as a
“I’ll go if you want me to, I swear, just listen to what I have to say,” Tony pleaded.
That night, though, when Tony had less control over his thoughts than he would have liked, his dream ran wild. The brunet found himself faced with a naked Steve, working himself open, and begging for Tony to take him. The smaller man was panting, telling Tony that he could use him however he wanted; that all he wanted was to make the taller man feel good. Somewhere in his mind, Tony wanted to resist, but his dream self wasn’t going to pass up such an amazing opportunity. He obliged the blond’s requests and sank into him. From there, it didn’t take long for both of them to finish, Tony coming with Steve’s name on his lips.
“Hello again Miss Potts…”
“Well hello there, only child of mine who, for some reason, refuses to ever speak to me. Nice to see you again.”
“I miss you too,” Peggy said, heart visibly breaking from having to be so far away. “But I’ll be home very soon, okay? I’ve just got some things that I need to do here, and then I’ll be back to give you the biggest hug and kiss ever!”
“What the fuck?” Tony asked, turning to see Steve standing beside him in nothing but an apron.
“No need to be. It’s weird, I know. It gets better, though. Promise.”
“Buh-bye Ony, I love yew,” Cora turned to listen to Steve as he whispered something, and excitedly turned back to blow a the screen a kiss. Steve moved the camera, so that he was all Tony could see.
“Yeah, I know, but I just really need to say this, okay?”
Tony just smiled and gave a shrug, earning himself an eye roll.
“Honestly, Stevie, all I can say is you need to talk to him. If it’s that big of a concern, you just have to be blunt and bring it up. I mean, I doubt it’s anything shady, but really he could be getting that money from anywhere. You don’t want to come to find out that he’s selling drugs or stolen goods or something. If Tony’s going to be around you and Coraline, you need to make sure everything is on the up and up.”
“Oh, uh…” Steve began, taking out his phone and swiping through. He’d come across his ‘Arting’ playlist that he’d listen to while drawing or painting. It’d become one of his favorites, but he was somewhat self conscious about sharing this playlist in particular. Before he had a chance to select something else, Tony reached over and pointed to a song.
“You mean the night when you and Tony ditched us at the bar to sit in the living room for hours?”
“Sure thing,” Tony offered.
“This isn’t your problem anymore, Pepper.
“No! No, baby, no. Nothing like that,” Tony surged forward and kissed Steve. “I’ve had sex. I’ve had a
“What?” Steve asked, confused.
“Seems the alcohol you have here is still fine, so I’m a little confused as to why you’ve been spending all of your time at a bar.”
For a moment, Tony stood in front of the cabin, taking it all in. The sun was setting, giving off the most beautiful yellow, pink and purple hues over the winter wonderland before him. That scene along with the thought of finally getting to relax with Steve was enough to put a smile on Tony’s face. He walked up the front steps and into the front door as fast as he could without seeming too desperate.
Tony followed Steve into the kitchen where he watched Steve take down two wine glasses and pour the deep red liquid into it. “Hide it,” Tony instructed once Steve had finished pouring. “Steve, hide the bottle from me.”
“Does it bother you that Tony said he thought you were cute?” Natasha asked, softly.
“Well hello there, lovely ladies!” Tony sang as he opened the door to the building. “I hope you know that we appreciate you helping us with this costume, but my need for perfection is also going to drive you insane… so let’s get started!”
“You’ve got that stupid look on your face, that ‘something involving Steve is happening right now and I’m giddier than a schoolgirl about it’ face,” Carol pointed out, waving the steak at the end of her fork at Tony and his phone.
“I swear to God, Clint, if it weren’t for the fact that Nat would kill me, I’d throw you out the window right here and now,” Bucky grit out with clenched teeth.
“Well, I’m gonna put Cora to sleep and then we’ll discuss what I owe you for babysitting.”
“Ok, so you invited Steve to the Christmas hang out and he said yes…” Carol reiterated, slowly.
Natasha looked down at Steve, worry written clearly across her face, but gave a single nod.
“Yes, alpha,” Steve answered, before quickly correcting himself, “I...I mean...yes,
Tony was always deft with his fingers, and tonight was no exception. He worked his digits expertly, drawing moan after moan out of Steve. After several minutes, Steve gently nudged Tony’s hand away, earning himself a look of concern, to which he shook his head. “I told you I wanted to show just how much I love being yours. Let me take care of you,” Steve whispered, maneuvering them back to his initial position atop of Tony.
“Can I cawwy somfin’?”
“Listen, everyone, I just wanted to say I’m sorry I’ve been a blubbering mess, but it really does mean a lot to know that each and every one of you cared enough about us to come out and celebrate today,” Steve spoke, unconsciously placing his hand on his belly to emphasize who he meant by
“Oh… yeah, right, okay then.”
Rhodey was clearly stunned, but sighed as he ran his hand over his face. “Wow, okay well you can look it up if you'd like but I'd really suggest getting the story straight from Tony when he’s ready to share it—I definitely preferred flying the AV-8B Harrier II over the other combat aircrafts,” Rhodey finished, quickly nodding over Steve’s shoulder.
“I need to talk to you today, around noon about something in my office” the man said, giving Steve a strange look.
“What’s this, love?” He asked, taking the paper in hand.
Once Tony got settled in the driver’s seat, he started the car and pulled up the GPS on his phone. They had three hours to go before they reached their destination, and Tony knew his nervousness of what was to come would eat away the entire time.
“Drive carefully. And remember, you’ve got precious cargo,” Bucky said to Tony in a motherly tone.
“We making our way to the lake?” Steve asked, knowing the answer.
The heartbreak was clear on Pepper’s face, the second those words left Tony’s mouth.
Tony felt a familiar weight in his gut--the same weight that came about whenever Coraline brought up his absence. “I hope not, baby girl.”
“Well Tony, he’s from a different time…”
“Really Tony?”
“Do you think just because you’re away at school that you are not going to be held to the same family expectations as in years previous? You are a Stark by blood and you will join your mother and I in Italy, end of story. Now I really must go.”
“You gonna just stand there looking like a Greek statue, or are you gonna come in?”
“Leave,” was all the omega said, before turning to look away from Tony.
“I...I’m so sorry, sir,” the girl, ‘Heidi’ as stated on her nametag, began typing, clearly starting to panic.
“Are you sure?” Tony knew it felt good, but he also knew that the first couple of times hurt a little. “I don’t want to rush anything if you’re not comfo--”
“You know what about. I’ve been keeping my distance since I found out about Steve being pregnant, but I think it’s time we actually talked about this.”
“Pepper I… I was scared,” Steve tried to rationalize. “I had no idea why Peggy was really leaving Cora with me, at the time, but I was horrified that the same would happen with Tony.”
“I probably will, but only time will tell,” Steve answered around a smile.
“You, my friend, need to stay focused on your homework. Remember, people who think I’m just ‘alright’ don’t get to have fun with me and Mr. Harvey.”
“Bullshit.”
At this point, Howard was seething. Tony hadn’t seen the man this angry since the day he stated that his mother was better off dead than continuing to live with Howard as a husband. The older man stalked over and stood in front of Tony as he sat in his chair. Howard braced his hands on the arms of the chair, leaning in close to Tony’s face.
As his eyes fluttered shut, Steve was able to catch Jarvis’ last words.
was entirely too good to pass up. So Tony moved some things around and planned a winter getaway to his cabin in upstate New York.
“This...would be my dad.”
The shy smile that Steve gave in response was enough to take Tony’s breath away. It was several minutes before either of them moved their hand, but after that they returned to the same comfortable silence they had started with, as they finished their food.
The blond really thought that he had conquered his initial fears about this pregnancy up until the day that he was cornered by Pepper on his way back to his office.
Though Steve was fully aware he was only offering his help because of the burgeoning crush he had, he still saw Tony’s assessment as a challenge. He wanted to offer his time out of the goodness of his heart, and because it was an excuse to spend more time with the brunet, but now he had something to prove.
Tony pulled Steve into a kiss with a ferocity that surprised even himself. It only took a few seconds, but soon Steve was giving as good as he got, nipping at the brunet’s lip and sucking on his tongue. They stayed there, kiss increasing in urgency, for several minutes. Tony was the one to pull away, resting his forehead on Steve's as he tried to catch his breath.
No matter what it took, Tony was going to make sure that Tiberius Stone answered for what he’d done.
“Are you guys done?” Steve asked, clearly past the point of annoyance.
seen him like this. You know how he is with emotions and stuff.”
“I’d like that a lot.”
Her bottom lip quivered and she looked up at Tony with doe eyes. “I’m sowwie, Ony.”
“The part where the entire movie happens…” Everyone let out a laugh at that, as Cora ran over and grabbed onto Tony’s leg.
“Water would be great, thank you.” Pepper replied from her seat. “Do you mind if I take off my shoes? It’s been quite a long day on my feet.”
“No idea, sir,” Steve responded, now beginning to get a little worried.
“No. I want to be miserable forever,” Steve said, finally sitting up, and frowning in Bucky’s direction.
Tony wracked his brain to think of who he could call to see if Steve had come into work without letting on about missing the appointment. He quickly dialed Carol’s number and waited for her to pick up.
“You’re Ony’s daddy,” she said, excited.
Tony moved to greet Natasha, taken aback by the hug that she pulled him into. “Glad you and Steve were able to make it,” she said, smugness dripping from her voice.
“No, Pep, hear me out. I am really good at fucking things up. I know that 364 days of the year, everyone just tolerates me...some more than others. But this is my chance to redeem myself, so everything has to be perfect."
The pair sat there naked for a moment, Tony eventually moving to give Steve a soft kiss. “Are you ready?” Tony asked, looking for any signs of hesitation. All he saw, though, was a look of happiness and possibly something he didn't dare to pinpoint, as Steve confidently answered yes.
“Of course Miss Potts, anything you need.”
When Tony finally brought himself to look at the woman next to him, she was smiling at him, fondly.
“I know you’re not sorry, because you’re as hard as a rock right now.”
"The guests of honor have arrived!" Bucky announced, in a loud whisper.
School started again in a few days and Pepper decided that Tony needed to get out of his room, get some fresh air, and become human again before that happened. So here they were, at the Olive Garden where Pepper insisted they go. Tony hated the Olive Garden.
“So, if I check your bank statement am I going to find that you’ve thrown away all your money at a certain bar named after a spider?”
“Aww, but we weren’t done gossiping about which student couples we think made it through the Summer break,” Barton whined.
Steve had been worrying about Tony's finances ever since Valentine's day. He wanted to trust his boyfriend, but something didn't seem right.
Steve looked away at that, seemingly trying to compose himself and hide the additional tears that fell.
They sat through the rest of their meal, quietly exchanging glances and small smiles. Once they were finished, Tony offered to wash the dishes while Steve set up a movie for them to watch. Tony finally joined Steve on the couch, as the movie began playing.
“Honey, I could honestly care less about who you date, as long as they have a good heart. I can tell just by the stories you’ve told me of your time with him that Tony has a wonderful heart. At this point, I’d be mad if you
Steve could see the quick look that Natasha exchanged with Bucky, before she sat up to give the blond her full attention.
“No. These are important questions that
“We get to see my favorite of all the doctors today,” Steve answered.
“Look, Coulson promoted me too. I’ll be managing the web dev team, so I mean...we’ll still be working together but not like before. So, with that in mind, maybe you can come back to work?”
“Hey everyone,” Steve started, “as Mr. Stark said, I’m Mr. Rogers. Let me know if you need anything today. Otherwise, I’m excited to get to know you all and to do what I can for the team this year.” He ended with a sincere smile, giving a barely noticeable sigh of relief once the students started welcoming him.
Steve looked at the man beside him, in slight shock. Tony never struck him as the kind of guy who cared enough about how his actions affected others to throw a party just to apologize for them.
“Oh, well then,” Tony stammered, clearing his throat. “While I usually don’t accept payment for my good deeds, I think I can make an exception. Just this once.” Steve gave a triumphant smile, as he stood. “Somehow I had a feeling you might.”
The remainder of his transaction with Tony went smoothly. Once they’d gotten past the initial awkwardness, they were able to conduct themselves like adults.
“So...do you need me to help find chaperones or…?”
like to do?”
“Do you…are you serious? Would that actually work?”
“I assume you came here to ask if I would be ok with you seeing a man.”
“James,” Natasha spoke in a warning tone.
Aside from telling the brunet just how much he was missed in his absence, though, Steve had been anxiously awaiting the moment when he could finally tell Tony that he wanted to be his bond mate. The thought was exhilarating and terrifying all at once, but after some extensive conversations with all of the women in his life; Natasha, Pepper, Carol and even Bug, Steve concluded that it was finally time. So, sitting there, in front of all those who were happy for he and the alpha and the arrival of their baby, Steve beamed, thinking about all that was to come.
, but that pesky part of his brain that hoped for acceptance from him took over.
“That’s doubtful but if you’re lucky, you might catch a full smile as opposed to that thing he does that just looks like a muscle spasm at one corner of his mouth,” Steve joked. Both men laughed at the thought when Peter interjected.
Steve spent half of the walk to lunch in silence with his hands crammed in his pockets. Though he and Tony had gotten to know each other over the past couple of months, Steve still felt nervous asking him out for lunch. It started as a good faith gesture, to show the brunet that his previous actions really had been forgiven, and somehow it transformed into a regular occurrence. There wasn’t a single day that Steve didn’t look forward to these lunches, and though all of his friends liked to think it was because Steve was crushing on Tony, it was really just because he enjoyed getting to know the alpha.
“Ready?” Tony asked, taking hold of Steve’s hand. The blond smiled wide, nodding. “Yep, let’s go meet some penguins.”
Steve had felt the weight of everything crashing down on him for a while now, but this was the first time that he’d admitted it, out loud, that he didn’t think he could do this. Bucky looked at him, sympathetically, before sighing.
