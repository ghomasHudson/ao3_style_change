It’s indeed during one of these searches that an ad about “spending the holiday of a lifetime on a deserted island” pops up in the right corner of his screen; he disregards the offer, but that gives him an idea that right now sounds just about perfect (although he couldn’t tell if it’s the suggestion itself or rather the fact that he’s bored beyond his mind): he should buy himself an island. Why? Just because. Also, he reflects, that could be useful in case of a big catastrophe, or, you know, if his game gets discovered and he needs to disappear from the face of earth (it’s funny what kind of scenarios your brain can conjure up when it needs stimulation). He opens a black market server he’s been a member of since he was sixteen and does a quick search, setting filters like ‘less likely to get hit by a tsunami’ or ‘availability of a helicopter pad’; ten minutes later, he’s shortlisted three possible candidates, and he puts an offer on each of them, just to be on the safe side.
he remembers it. Soon enough he gets overwhelmed by his presence though, and before his brain can rationalize the whole situation he finds himself ceasing the dance, pushing Steve gently against the wall and pressing his own body against his, lips finding each other as if they had shared many intimate moments before, and the kiss that follows is passionate and deep, failing to hide the sense of eagerness and longing they both feel. There aren’t any moments wasted this time – that’s a luxury you can’t afford yourself when there’s a global war raging just outside your building – and before more words can be exchanged Tony’s hands slip inside Steve’s boxers to find their way to him, stroking him gently and slowly as his mouth sucks on the broadened neck, leaving marks of promises and oaths as their respective moans echo quietly in the air, allowing them both to forget the ugliness that rambles on just a few feet away.
“W-Who?”
when I lost consciousness!” Tony exclaims, now properly sitting up on the bed. He feels weak as hell but he can’t just lie there while one of the most powerful object ever known to mankind is far from being in safe hands, whomever they might be. “Where’s my suit?”
A few steps away, Rhodey stops abruptly, turns around and goes back up the stairs, fully knowing his friend is going to be real mad at him later. But he refuses to be in the middle of whatever this is going to turn out, whether a make-out, make-up session or another stubborn superhero civil war. One was enough for a lifetime, as long as he’s concerned.
Tony Stark doesn’t often indulge in sentiments – mostly because he was brought up to store them all away – but right now he just can’t help himself. This feels too good not to rejoice about it. Not to scream it to everyone. So although he normally would never believe in such a thing, he sends a prayer up to the sky to let them win this. Because, for the first time in his whole life, he just can’t wait to see what else is in store for him. And although he’s over one-hundred years old, right now he feels
The first venture out in the world takes place about a week later, after they’ve practiced enough to at least
Again, a small grin creeps up on the other’s lips – Steve knows it’s there even though he can’t see it, still not ready to face the azure eyes – preceding the answer that sounds more serious than it was intended to be: “You talk like you’re unaware of the fact that I’ve got alerts with your name set up in every possible language known to mankind, Steve, alien ones included. Remember how complicated Krullian is?”
he thinks with no little anguish,
Steve blinks, puzzled out of his mind for a couple of seconds, then scratches the back of his head and looks around, embarrassed, not entirely sure of what’s happening or what to say at this point. Tony glances at him for a while, but only manages to keep a straight face for a minute or so before bursting into laughter.
“We never agreed to anything…”
– lying on his elbows, legs spread to reveal his butthole, dick dangling hard between them. Yeah, Steve read the clues correctly alright. He smirks without any joy, and if he could see himself in the mirror he wouldn’t be able to recognize himself.

a proper date, and to follow his usual plan, but before he can make his first move, his rational side takes over, shortcutting his brain and making him go on talking instead: “I would consider this a successful date, Steve, yes,” he hears himself replying, and god, how much he hates the sound of his own voice right now.
It doesn’t take long for Tony to find his way to Steve’s tent. He tells himself it’s
So Steve tells him, and by the end of it, Tony is so angry and frustrated that sex and love are at about the bottom of his thoughts.

Once more, the familiar shiver runs down Tony’s back, anticipating new tears forming in his eyes; he looks at Steve again, and this time instead of talking he leans forward to kiss him, hoping that some miracle will make it possible for the other to feel it as strongly and heartfelt as he does.
“What
Steve tries to smile, but it’s so tiny and fragile that Tony has to look away: “We are… a couple of i-idiots, you… you know that, right?”
“He said you’re not to be trusted.”
Steve is about to say something but gets beaten to it by Janet, although the remark isn’t exactly the kind he had in mind.

But judging by the look on Quill’s face he isn’t kidding at all. He knows it shouldn’t matter – wasn’t the purpose of this finding himself, having time away from everything and everyone? – but still he can’t deny that it feels…
“Relax, Cap, it’s all good. Let’s go finish this, c’mon,” he winks at him, patting softly his bicep before answering, loud enough for the rest to hear: “Coming!”
It makes sense, obviously, but he’s still very doubtful about his own participation in this matter. Labels and he don’t really go along, never have, so he never stopped to consider what his not so secret affair with the other meant, way back when. And now, well, it simply doesn’t matter anymore, because what’s the point? It’s in the
Tony desperately wants to throw up, not only the three cups of coffee he’s drank today so far, but possibly his own soul too, or what there is left of it. Probably not a lot, after all that’s happened recently.
“Would you go on a date with me?” Steve lets out all in a single breath, keeping his gaze on the other even if he’s awkward and shy as hell.

“C’mon, pal, you’ve done your stunt, time to go home” the big guy says, putting a decisively non-friendly, mighty hand on his shoulder, squeezing it in a way that sends sparks of pain around his body.
When he finally comes around, a solid hour has gone by, but his headache gently reminds him of its presence the moment he opens his eyes, thus realizing he’s in the sick bay of their new base. He groans lowly, sitting up for a couple of seconds before carefully throwing his legs off the bed to stand up, and of course the room starts immediately spinning around him, so fast that he has to stretch a hand to the wall in order to steady himself and not fall on the floor. He does a brief scan of his surroundings, soon gathering that he’s the only one here, a realization that is accompanied by the dreadful feeling of his stomach turning upside down. His first coherent thought goes to Steve, as usual, and it doesn’t take long before images of the past night come up in his mind: the youth homeless shelter, the workshop about self-defense, and then the dark alley, the drug courier trying to recruit kids, Tony spotting him and phoning the police, only at that point other three or four thugs seemed to appear out of nowhere, managing to catch him off guard. He had tried to keep them at bay but they seemed to be

Steve is a little taken aback by this revelation, and looks at him with sincere eyes, the kind of stare which makes about anyone have little doubts about his sincerity. “I... had no idea that’s the reason why you spend so much time down there...”
He holds a sigh in, shrugs instead, but avoids meeting her glance all the same: “You’re reading too much into it. I’m just helping him out, that’s all. We’re already friends, which helps. Other than that, it’s all in your mind, Danvers. You’re in love and assume everyone else is too.”
They end up talking at the same exact time, nothing more than a coincidence really, but it makes them chuckle because it’s never happened before, and isn’t that a sign of a deep connection with someone?

“Not if they have a super-soldier serum in their veins.”
“You know? That’s probably better. Not everything can be explained

“He told me, and Steve. Maybe Peter, but I’m not too sure about that.”
“They’re… not from around here.” Nick replies enigmatically, and Tony doesn’t manage to get him to say anything else on the subject, no matter how hard he tries.
“What does it matter, Tony? Her signature is on my chart so I guess she’s the one in charge. Anyway, she said I could go whenever I wanted to, as all levels are getting back to normal and I’m making a speedy recovery.”
“Ah-ha, very funny. Just tell me when, and I’ll be there.”
“I’m a nurse.

“Oh Tony…” Steve shakes his head, but a tiny smile appears on his lips as he gets closer, throwing his arms around the other’s neck, pressing his lips against his forehead in a soft gesture that Tony adores, and was missing deeply.
“Glad you like them…” the other replies, pausing for a second before adding: “Hey, look what I’ve just found…”

Steve nods, although his face tells that he’s not entirely sure he can keep his promise; nevertheless, after a few more seconds in which he reminds himself of what exactly he was saying, he begins talking again, and for a short while he seems to have found his pace. That is, until Tony decides to step up the game and nonchalantly starts rubbing his thumb against the back of the other’s hand. With what seems to be an enormous effort, Steve forces himself to not stop at this, although it’s clear just how

“… Uh. Interesting,” Thor’s brother comments, before a new moment of his hand sends one of the lockers against Steve’s body. “That should keep you occupied for a minute.

That armor cannot do anything against my
, a voice from within tells him, and yes, that is the truth. No matter the consequences or how long it might take him, he always finds a way to get his man back. Does Steve know? Probably, but he’s never said anything, and Tony guesses that maybe it’s better this way. It’s their silent pact.
Tony pushes the child away from him a little so he can look at her face, "Hey buttercup, you with us?". What with her high temperature and what Bruce told him earlier, he hadn't completely expected her to be totally conscious. "Do you know what's happening?".
It had turned out to be some sort of blessing, the super-soldier and crime-fighting-genius could cower in the corner whilst their small child cupped the demon-creature in her tiny hands and softly spoke, explaining that she would deposit them into a garden and they’d be safe and happy.
Maybe, if the bite mounted to nothing then nobody would ever know..
Mila pauses as her eyes scan the room, confirming to herself that she is actually home. With a contented sigh, she sits down on the floor, ignoring the aborted “wh-“ from Tony.
Percie's heart sinks. When her dad hadn't immediately torn her to shreds she'd hoped that he didn't know about the Oscorp situation, and that she'd be able to keep it that way, " 'm sorry" she mumbles, pressing her face further into her dad's shirt and wishing she'd disappear, " 'm sorry i killed the sp'der".
Mila is nestled between her dads, relishing in the physical contact and appreciating their body warmth. Tony combs his fingers through her curls and Steve is drawing circles on her back with his thumb. Given the choice, it’s probable that the family would freeze the moment forever. For just a moment it felt as though everything was perfect.
The billionaire smiles softly at the typical Mila response, assured for a third time that this is her (and she is still her), though his hands are still shaking and a distant part of his brain keeps warning him that he could vomit at any given moment, “Come on sunbeam”. He places his hand on her back, desperate to keep up the physical reassurance, and guides her towards the elevator, wrapping his arms around her once they’re inside and the metal box begins to ascend.
“Dotty get off my ankles”, the smile that blooms across her face is warm and genuine and as she looks up to meet Steve’s eyes, it brightens even more.
“What are you thinking about Mila Moos?”, Tony ducks his head in an attempt to make eye-contact with her, noting that she’s been quiet for a few minutes.
Percie is confused and panicked and overwhelmed, she doesn't understand where she is or why Ben and May are there or why everything is so bright and loud.
She headed straight to her room, burrowing under the duvet and attempting to sleep. Dinner time came and went, her dad didn't call her and so she didn't leave her room. He'd probably forgotten to eat again and with Percie out of sight she was also most likely out of mind. That was fine.
“I’m still having him check you over”, he eyes her warily as she crosses the room, determined that if there is any sign of discomfort or pain he’ll catch it; unfortunately, she’s much too like him in that she has a talent for suffering silently, “and I can’t say I’m the biggest fan of that blue tint you’re sporting there Mila Moos”.
And there’s an element of Steve that’s aching.
Despite the severity of the situation, Tony can't help but huff an exasperated laugh. He presses his forehead to hers, ignoring the ridiculous heat which is still radiating from her tiny body, "I don't care about the spider, Persephone, I just want.. I need you to be okay, got it?".
Osborne will pay the consequences.
By the time her eyelids fluttered open he was a bawling mess, stroking his thumbs over her cheeks and praying to every god he doesn't believe in that he'll see her baby blues again. The relief that hit him when she made eye contact with him was almost painful. "Hi honey, hi baby, good girl, keep those eyes open for me". She blinked up at him, dazed and confused but trusting in her dad (who had yelled at her forty seconds ago). "We're gonna head down to the MedBay, yeah? Try and find Uncle Bruce", he tried his best to smile reassuringly, with full knowledge that even sick and delirious she's too clever to fall for it, but she managed a tiny nod anyway.
She’s warm and dry in a soft t-shirt and sweatpants, the stripy fluffy socks that Steve bought her (after seeing them in the store and just knowing that she’d love them) on her feet.
Mila lets herself drop to the floor, lying on the wood and covering her face with her hands for a moment before sitting back up with a grin on her face, “Holy shit, we did it”.
"Oh bubba I'm sorry", he whispers under his breath as the elevator begins to move and he realises that this is the first time he's held his daughter since she sobbed on the floor of his workshop. With her cheek pressed against his neck, the heat radiating from her skin was concerning him even more. "Jarvis what's her temperature?".
Persephone can't see him though, her face is pressed into her dad's shoulder. It's been so long since he held her like this instead of actively avoiding her, there's a hazy memory of him carrying her but she isn't entirely sure whether it's real or if she imagined it out of pure desperation for human contact.
That isn't completely true, there are things he should definitely be doing, like calling Steve, the rest of the team, Percie's school, Happy and Pepper and Rhodey... but that would mean living through it all over again, explaining it to people.
Then, something catches her attention, more so than anything so far on the trip.
There's a crash from the opposite side of the room, and then May and Ben are gone, replaced by a face Persephone hasn't seen in a long time.
Bruce nods slowly - a temporary acceptance of her response - but crosses the room to his computer to make note of it.
By the time the elevator doors ping open, the genius’ curiously has begun to get the better of him. Where the hell has she been? Who knew where she was? Where did that video come from? Was she actually kidnapped or did she just decide to dip? No, that isn’t Mila.
May's sobbing doesn't relent, but she thanks him profusely before the phone call ends.
“I’m sorry I- I had to get it out and I couldn’t find it and I’m.. I’m sorry”, tears begin to track down her cheeks and Tony has that primal, instinctual mother-hen sensation that he gets every time she cries, tugging her much-too-small body close to his chest and pressing his face into her curls.
Knowing that her dad isn't mad, at least not at her, provided enough relief that she can feel herself falling back into the instrumental, soft piano notes winding themselves around her thoughts and weighing them down, "I'm tired".
Growing impatient, he skips through a couple hours of footage, stopping only when he suddenly notices the duo aren't with the group anymore. The billionaire skips back a few minutes. Percie and Peter stand at the back of the group, Percie's gaze wandering around the space, not focusing on anything.
Tony has never felt more like a monster.
Bruce glances at Persephone, then at the vitals that Jarvis is displaying, “Honestly, Tony? I really don’t know”.
He nods.
He shakes his head, "Or the press have caught wind of this already".
"Tony temperatures like this cause brain damage, she's essentially cooking in there, the chances of her fully recovering from this are..".
Tony watches as Bruce’s brows furrow and he places a hand on Mila’s shoulder to steady her as he inspects the scars closer.
, Daddy, just because he bit us doesn't mean he is undeserving of an identity. Why
Pepper picks up his phone and reads the caller ID, "Tony, it's May".
Bruce hands the teen a water bottle with a sympathetic smile, “Mila when was the last time you ate?”.
And they do, rejoining their class as if nothing happened. Tony watches the footage as they pretend to listen to the tour guide and ignore the unrelenting nasty comments from another child (How long has this been going on? Why didn’t he notice?), all the way through to Percie clambering into Happy’s car.
Too tired to properly look around, she just assumes there's nothing else to see and lets Ben support her head.
Persephone feels her dad shift, "Is that normal?".

There’s more unsaid that said in that one sentence, and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out what the underlining is: this is too good to be true, it could well be a trap of some kind. That’s just what Washington is mainly about, after all. And it’s only now that Tony finally gets just

It’s only a few days after they get back to Earth – and their bodies and minds are back to function normally – that the subject comes back into Tony’s mind, along with an idea of what their next step should be. So, once he works out the details, he heads to the gym where Steve is busy skipping the rope and, leaning against one of the punching bags, he half-smirks at him to catch his attention.
Tony can't even remember that morning. He can't remember if he said he loved her, made sure she ate, or even saw her at all. Guilt continues to eat him alive.
Dr Cho, who had been standing by the door and watching silently, withdraws her phone from her pocket and exits the room.
Despite her blue lips, pale skin and shaky legs, her curls are as wild as ever, tumbling around her shoulders in the same coils she’s had since she was a toddler, the same curls that Tony adores. As soon as her name leaves his mouth, her face splits into a grin, “You are not going to believe the shit I’ve been through”.
She's not dead, she's not dead, she's not dead.
In one moment she's assaulted by multiple realisations.
Tony looks to Bruce for confirmation before responding, "You can sleep baby".
Mila gladly reciprocates the notion, resting her head on her father’s chest and appreciating the steady inhales and exhales which move it rhythmically.
"Tony, I'm going to be honest with you and you need to try your best to stay calm, okay? Because you're all she's got right now and she needs you", Bruce speaks softly, raising a hand to rest on the genius' shoulder.
Suddenly, Cho was there with her team. Percie was torn from his arms, letting out a cry of protest at being taken away from the only person she had left, but it was drowned out by Helen's orders and random people calling out statistics that Tony doesn't understand. Eventually, it all gave way to a ringing in his ears, static white noise which couldn't quite overpower the pure regret boiling in his stomach.
By the time the sun crept into the sky, Persephone had decided she couldn't take it anymore.
Though Tony ordered food for all three of them, Mila is the only one who eats. Her parents sit there, forks in hand and bowls of pasta in front of them, but they don’t even touch their food, they just watch her as she eats her macaroni, no trace of the desperation that a kidnapped kid should have when handed food.
"Sorry, I think I'm missing something", May speaks up from the corner, Persephone had completely forgotten she and Ben were there, "What spider?".
A spike of fear shooting up his spine, Steve shifts and the movement snaps the teen out of the trance she’d slipped into. She snaps her head round to face her parents, brain lagging a little behind, “What am I... oh!”, she blinks, “I don’t know.. there’s a lot. I was just-“.
If there's one thing Tony Stark knows about himself, it's that he's a mechanic through and through.
And then he's stood in her room, staring at her body.
They were both too intelligent to even convince themselves to believe that.
“Tony wha- oh. . . Mila”, despite his obvious shock, the scientist’s voice and demeanour are soft. He smiles, his eyes scanning the child for any obvious injuries. In finding none, he relaxes a little more.
A face appears in front of hers and as her eyes begin to focus she can identify it as Ben, Peter's uncle.
Her tone tilts more on the confused side than concerned, which only fuels her fathers’ anxiety more.
It makes sense, why would they give her more clothes? But the prospect of his baby with nothing to protect her except for a leotard and a t-shirt stirs the bile in his stomach.
Steve stares down at her in surprise, but the mongrel is gone, shot down the hallway like a fluffy bullet.
By the time Ben and May arrive, Peter is in the ICU with Persephone. Ben has his arms wrapped around his wife, guiding her through the halls as soon as he spots Tony. The woman is shaking, her face tear-stained and eyes red. The billionaire supposes that he probably looks no better.
Then the ink bursts from the pen and spatters across the page, or a line is struck in a place where a line shouldn’t be, or you wander the paths so aimlessly that you find yourself lost somewhere near the middle and hope dwindles and your baby is gone. The pattern is ruined and your baby is gone.
As Bruce begins the task of putting the IV back in and re-connecting his kid to all the monitors, Tony has to ask the question.
There's a few minutes of footage in which nothing really happens, it's just the Oscorp representative (a smiley blonde named Katie) giving a typical pre-tour introduction, not too dissimilar to the one at SI. And even though Percie has heard the SI spiel a thousand times, she's always attentive - always listening and contributing and beaming. But now, there's no engagement. Her expression is indifferent and it seems as though she's not entirely aware of her surroundings, there's no sign of her personality at all and Tony wants to vomit.
The notion that Bruce was on his way sent a jolt down Tony's spine, Bruce has been MIA for months, providing zero proof that he was even alive. Tony had texted, called, emailed and received no response, not even a read receipt. He would never admit to the uncomfortable buzzing in the back of his brain that felt much too like betrayal, because Tony has no right to know where he is.. but the man was as close to an intellectual equal as he'd ever gotten, and he understood him in a way that even Steve never did. And, he was good with Percie.
The atmosphere inside the ICU is unsettling to say the least, Peter is now pretty much in the same state as Percie. They're side by side, Bruce and Helen stood in the middle of the two. In the years that Tony has known both of them, he's never seen them looking so puzzled and concerned. He's not a fan of the fact that this is happening in regards to his daughter and her best friend.
“Mila what’s that?”.
She doesn't get too much of a chance to worry about it, because her dad bursts through the door.
Weeks composed of debilitating days, and nights which brought nothing close to relief, cups of coffee, created and discarded, periodic texts from concerned family and friends: How are you doing? Are you looking after yourself? We’re sending our deepest condolences to you and Steve; all playing their part in some sick pantomime which saw the ‘genius billionaire philanthropist’ feel less and less like a genius and more and more like a fraud, a failure, a father who had lost his purpose.
She nudges Peter, guiding his focus to a door. It's open just a crack, like someone forgot to close it. Through the small gap, Percie has noticed the absolute carnage that lies inside.
“Jarvis call Steve, right now, don’t let him reject it”.
"Persephone has a body temperature of 107 Degrees Fahrenheit".
He does, albeit reluctantly, the pounding of his heart filling his ears and disrupting any sound-waves. His ribs might burst with the force of it, every moment which passes before he sees her he's drawing one step closer to collapse.
She chuckles, shaking her head, “Let me go get changed and I’m sure I’ll thaw out”.
Percie stares up at her dad. For so long it’s felt as though there’s a whole ocean between them, despite being in the same penthouse, she’s never felt further away from him.
Only to freeze upon eye contact.
“Oh my god”, he murmurs, letting go of Tony and opening his arms in time to collect her in a hug, “Oh my god”. His hand cups the back of her head, fingers gripping her curls with a hollow kind of desperation to ground himself.
They both know that she means more than just physically.
He sends a shocked look to Tony, probably fearing an intruder, but before he can chase after the dog, his boyfriend places a hand on his chest, “Steve, listen to me, this is absolutely crazy but I swear, Mila is- she’s-“.
There's something choking her, air is being pushed in and out of her lungs but she's not controlling it, she hates it.
"What the fuck?", panic begins to overwhelm him. 107 degrees is insane, he would have panicked over a 104 but 107- he definitely would've panicked more if it weren't for the opening of the elevator doors.
Mila looks just as shell-shocked as everybody else in the room, her mouth forming an ‘o’ and her eyes wide.
It hits the wall so hard that the paint chips, the usually very composed Tony Stark flying into the room like a hurricane of pure panic. His eyes dart around the room before he properly enters, locking onto Persephone with an intensity which has the child sinking back into Bruce.
It’s a good half an hour later that they’ve all calmed down enough for Tony to call Bruce. Despite Mila insisting that she’s fine and doesn’t need medical attention, neither of her dads are taking any chances. They won’t lose her again.
To make things even worse, it's evident that Peter's trying to suppress his glee about the trip from his facial expressions, to match Persephone's mood - flickers of excited smiles shining through when he'd catch sight of something particularly cool before being dampened by the realisation that his best friend isn't sharing the experience.
The moment is so expertly crafted, so fragile, resting on chance and desolation. One wrong word, one breath heavier than the others, one movement too sharp and she could just disappear, vanish into thin air and Tony would be purposeless again.
Tony doesn’t like that at all.
Bruce definitely notices, holding her a little tighter, "You're scaring her, Tony".
She loved them so much that she did a school project on them.
The night passed with no sleep, only tossing and turning, sweating and whimpering and wishing that Papa was there and Dad was Dad again. With her rising temperature came more distress and she found herself getting more and more worked up. Jarvis asked if she was okay a few times, he probably alerted her dad that she was distressed, but it was like he wasn't even there.
The frown that makes itself known on his daughter’s face makes Tony uneasy. The fact that she has to struggle to recall the last time she ate makes him burn with rage.
"Daddy please", the words that leave her mouth are a miserable cross between a whine and a moan of pain and he finally shifts his eyes to look at her. She's flushed and sweaty, her eyes glassed over. He doesn't know what to do with a sick child. She's been sick before, but he always had Steve.
Persephone Fern Rogers-Stark knew she'd made a mistake as soon as the arachnid sunk its fangs into her soft flesh - yet somehow, couldn't quite bring herself to be too concerned.
She isn't, but she may as well be.
This is the contact they’ve both mourned for weeks. Both Starks have wept for it on nights when they just wanted to be held and nobody else would do.
i have not proofread this
She nodded slowly, still not saying a word. It made sense, both of her dads hated her already, if there was a way to prevent aggravating them even more then she would make sure that was the path she took. There was no reason to alarm anyone if she was going to die anyway. "Okay.. we should get back to the group".
Another body joins their hug, Steve can tell by his arms and his breathing pattern that it’s Tony and he’s crying.
Despite his frantic thought process, Tony nods along with the two other men in the room, though they all make wary eye contact.
For a moment she looked as though she was going to burst into tears, eyes wide and shocked. But the tears never came, because almost as soon as his own words hit him, her eyes rolled back in her head and she hit the floor with a sickening thud.
The super-soldier closes his eyes as he hooks his chin over the top of his partner’s head, desperate to keep him close and safe in the way that he didn’t manage to do with Mila.
"Oh God, what did you two do?", May rubs a hand down her face, looking between the children, "Why do you always have to find trouble wherever you go?".
. Peter he- Tony I-".
An undeniable glow seems to emanate from her rosy lips and cheeks to the shine in her eyes, even reaching the bouncy curls that tumble behind her.
Tony Stark was sat at the breakfast bar, staring at the polished marble and wishing for an imperfection, a problem to work on and solve and fix, something simple enough for him to not mess up, but with enough of a challenge that it could drag his brain away from the knowledge that his husband left him and their daughter for another man.
new years resolutions are stupid but i’ll try to write more because woah
He returns the sentiment, “I’ll be right here”, resuming the position on the couch that he had come to adopt over the past couple of weeks, tumbling into a bottomless pit of self-pity and mourning. The only reason he’s bothered to eat a microwave meal in the first place was that Steve locked him out of the lab and wouldn’t let him down there unless-
"Doctor Cho is currently on shift in the MedBay, she has been alerted of Persephone's condition and is preparing a team. Doctor Banner has received the message and is on his way".
"Dad?".
Jarvis ends the video, leaving the billionaire with a whole lot of guilt, and a whole lot more anger.
She’s alive, she’s alive, she’s alive.
Tony can’t stop looking at her - can’t stop repeating to himself that she’s alive.
"Fucking hell, Persephone, suck it up and go to school!".
“I am never wearing pointe shoes again”, she rolls her eyes dramatically as she tugs at the ribbons and removes the shoes and pads from her feet.
“Stay?”.
"Okay what the fuck", the genius mumbles, sliding the phone back into his pocket, "Pep could you stay with Seph? I need to sort this".
“Okay I know this isn’t going to completely fill you with faith.. but I need you all to not freak out, and preferably not ask questions right now. I just- I need to process everything before I talk about it”.
Mila peeks over her shoulder at her back, “Honestly?”, she makes eye contact with Bruce who nods, “I don’t really remember.. I mean it’s a bit more complicated than that but I don’t really.. I don’t remember, I just woke up and they were there”.
Sleep has been abandoned as a priority and substituted with coffee, the billionaire can't afford to waste any time. He keeps both Percie and Peter's vitals on a holographic screen by his bench and gets to work - pointedly ignoring how ridiculous the numbers are.
Then May is there too, running her hand through Persephone's curls and speaking in the same tone as Ben.
Another man who killed his parents.
She doesn’t meet his eyes, staring at the far wall, responding with a vacant shrug.
Too quickly for him to register, Tony has crossed the short distance between them and scooped her into his arms. “Oh my god, oh my god, Mila you don’t- you aren’t, oh my god, baby I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. Mila”. He presses his face into her hair and breathes in her scent. It’s clouded by the shadow of blood and smoke, but she smells like her. Her legs wrap around his waist, her arms around his neck, the familiar feeling of her skin against his acting as the only proof he needs that this is his baby and she is alive. The thrum of her heart and the steady intake of breath to her lungs are tactile through his own chest, confirming to her dad that she’s okay, she’s here, and how or why isn’t currently what matters.
Regardless of where she is, who she's with or what she's doing, Persephone Rogers-Stark has always has some variation of a musical symphony (or cacophony) weaving itself in and around her thoughts and feelings. Sometimes there are words, sometimes it's just a soft piano, or a whole orchestra, but it's always there. In catching her tapping out rhythms or subconsciously playing piano keys on the table, Dad would call her a little weirdo - but kiss the top of her head so she knew he wasn't serious - whilst Papa would correct him, something about an internal rhythm and emotional intelligence.
Or, at least, he thought she was.
It had been a blessing, and then the mutant Oscorp tarantula sunk his fangs into Peter Parker’s arm.
In a second Mila has leapt to her feet, staring at the elevator doors. Her stance is confused, halfway between defensive and elated. Her shoulders are pushed back, spine arched, but her fists can’t land on clenched or open and her mouth opens and closes a few times before she gets words out “Who is it Fri?”.
Except he could swear that she’s stood in the lobby of Avengers Tower, not even ten feet away from him, shivering and soaked to the bone. Her flimsy grey t-shirt clings to her body like a second skin, pasted there by the unforgiving army of raindrops outside which were sent from the sky as a response to some kind of vendetta.
Steve and Tony feel as though they’re watching a movie. They sit and watch as their supposedly dead daughter leads a situation in a way they’ve never seen before, her tone of voice is new and her posture is new and the ambiguous underlying emotions are new. Everything is different, but only slightly. It’s as though every element of their world is the same, just moved a millimetre to the left. There’s no focal point, no proof that something is slightly off, just an undertone that doesn’t quite make sense.
"Okay! Okay listen, I'm sending a suit over right now for Peter and a car for you, I promise we've got the best people over here and they'll do everything they can".
"May? May you've got to slow down I can't.. what's up with Peter?".
"..Yeah, yeah of course", Pepper nods, clearly curious but opting not to ask.
After thirty seconds of clinging to each other, the group melt apart.
Although, in a way, the absurdity of the situation is a tad comforting. Normally, temperatures like that would kill, it's insane that the kids managed to reach those kind of numbers anyway, meaning that this isn't a usual sickness. If Percie and Peter aren't reacting in the way that they should, there's a chance that they could just miraculously pop out the other side, bubbly and bouncy as ever. That's the knowledge that fuels Tony to keep his mechanic brain in control, his dad brain can wait.
Her first thought is that he's mad.
And then he leaves and Tony is left with her once again.
Assuming that his boyfriend had had another in a long series of nightmares, Steve cuts off his rambling with a hug, his heart twisting when he can feel tears begin to soak his t-shirt. It isn’t the first time that Tony has fallen asleep on the couch, or in his workshop, and woken up having had a dream that Mila was back with them. It kills them both every time.
"It appears that Miss Rogers-Stark has almost fully metabolised the sedative".
“I do not believe that will be necessary, boss, Mr Rogers is currently in the elevator”.
"Got it".
He just wants to go back to this morning, gather her in his arms and tell her that he loves her. He loves her and he isn't ever letting her go. He wouldn't push her away, or ignore her, or shout. She wouldn't end up seizing on the cold kitchen tiles.
“We didn’t”, she whispers, just loud enough to be heard over the heavy silence coating the room.
“It’s okay baby, it’s all okay”.
The look on Bruce's face as he retreats from the ICU is enough to tell Tony that this isn't the flu.
Almost immediately, fear makes itself known in the form of Tony’s shaking hands. He doesn’t want to know how his baby acquired the scars - he doesn’t want to think about it. The thought of anybody causing his kid pain in any way, shape or form ignites a steady burning in the pit of his stomach. It would be so much easier, so much tidier, to just accept the utter miracle of her turning up on a wednesday evening relatively unharmed and erasing the past months from everybody’s memories.
"I don't know he- he came back from the trip last night a bit peaky and so I gave him some Tylenol and put him to bed and then- then this morning he didn't come out for breakfast and Ben couldn't. . . he couldn't wake him up, Tony, and then he started seizing and- and we can't take him to a hospital because we can't afford it Tony, please, we don't know what to do and I wouldn't ask but he's-".
"Would you just fucking spit it out?", Tony snaps, angry at Bruce for not being able to help, Steve for fucking off and leaving him with Percie, himself for being useless.
He doesn't know what to do with a sick child.
"She just panicked a little bit, pulled herself away from the monitors", Bruce explains softly.
“Okay... we should get back to the group”.
Jarvis automatically switches the footage to that of the wrecked lab, just as Persephone slips through the door, her accomplice close behind.
Tony didn’t even notice until the boy let out a shriek of terror, some kind of tarantula scuttling up his leg.
Realistically, he’s aware that there’s no way that she’s navigated the past months without encountering some kind of trauma - but she’s just popped up out of nowhere, whole and breathing and smiling and he’d thought that she was dead.
“Are you hurt?”, he queries softly, rubbing a hand up and down her back.
The genius has never understood his child’s fondness for arachnids. Both himself and Steve have been awful role models in situations with any kind of creepy-crawly. Despite never killing the creatures, they’d ignite enough panic that on occasion there may have been a tear or two. But Persephone was different, so gentle and careful with anyone and anything, including spiders.
It takes a few attempts, and the symphony seems to speed up with the effort, a steadily increasing beat attacking her from all sides. The voices stop and she can sense eyes on her, the discomfort that the sensation brings being the final force she needs to open her own eyes.
She nods woefully, tears starting to stream once again, "I killed the sp'dr" she   whines, " 'm sorry, I didn't mean to kill him".
The linoleum floor is littered with shards of glass, tiny daggers just waiting to pierce a child's skin. Puddles of sizzling chemicals have grouped on the floor, Tony doesn't need to know exactly what they are to know that they could cause some serious damage to a ten-year-old. But what worries him most, is exactly what seems to have intrigued his kid.
When the scientist sends a message through Jarvis to say that he’s in Medbay (oblivious to Mila’s return), the family head down in the elevator.
And the visage shatters, Mila glances from the exposed flesh on her arm to her right hand, blood and skin built up under her nails, and then she turns a sickly shade of green. In a split second Bruce has a dish under her mouth and she’s heaving bile.
As soon as Pepper's soft words make it through the barrier he's constructed, tears begin to roll down his cheeks and before long, full blown sobs wrack his body. She pulls him into a hug, holding onto him in the way that he should've held onto Percie when he had the opportunity. He doesn't know how long he sat there, in Pepper's arms, bawling, but by the time he'd calmed down, Bruce was jogging through the elevator looking the most dishevelled he ever had.
What’s left of a father once his baby is gone? Though elementally the logical response would be: who they were before fatherhood, once put into practice, that notion becomes evidently null and void. Fatherhood changes people, whether for the better or worse nobody finishes the first year of parenthood as the same person who started. Year upon year, they learn and evolve as their tiny human  grows and develops;  it’s a beautiful phenomenon that blossoms and repeats itself over and over like a geometric pattern.
He'd ruined the relationship between her and Steve, he knew that much. With such a clever kid he should've taken better care of the footage, destroying it completely would've been the best way to deal with it. But no, he left it lying around, drowning in self-pity, and of course she hacked into his suit to see it. She wanted to know what made her Papa leave, what left her Dad a ghost of his former self. And she did. He'd found her, a miserable mess of tears and snot on his workshop floor. It took hours of rocking her to calm her down to a level of coherency, at which point she told him over and over that she never wanted to see him again. She never wanted to see her Papa again. She never wanted to see him again.
The boy in the front of the group breaks into a grin. He has soft brunette curls that flop onto his forehead and big doe eyes. Though he’s thinner and his hair is longer than in the pictures on the news, Tony recognises him as Peter Parker, the first kid to go missing. “We did”, he beams, stepping forward and out of the elevator.
Camila Stark is the latest name to be added to the list of what is thought to be serial kidnappings in and around New York. The six other children reported missing and thought to be connected to the case are Elinor Bennet, Kasper Adams, Peter Parker, Luna Daniels, Sage Brooks and Mateo Vine. Camila’s parents, world-renown ‘Avengers’ Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, held a press conference earlier this afternoon expressing their grief and desire for their daughter to be returned home.
“Do they hurt, Mila?”.
As she brings herself closer and closer to the surface, Persephone can pick up on some words. She's fairly certain that they aren't actually part of the song, they're somewhere outside of her neat little bubble. Unable to comprehend exactly what the voices (she thinks there's two) are saying or who they're saying it to, she reaches the conclusion that she needs more information, and to get that information she should probably open her eyes.
The rest of the trip passed uneventfully, nobody had even realised they were gone. A few more hours of monotonous tour guide babble and Flash throwing in snide comments at any given opportunity came and went, and soon enough she was sat in the back of Uncle Happy's car, face pressed against the glass and thoughts slowing by the second. Her foggy brain filtered out Happy's concerned glances in the mirror, that and the fact that she was beyond the point of caring. Happy would assume that she was just upset about Papa leaving her to suffocate in her dad's mourning and that would be that, no questions asked.
Mila is strangely relaxed as Bruce leads her to sit on the table, an easy smile rests on her lips, her shoulders are back. As a baby, Mila had always been calm and soft. Her cries were outnumbered by giggles and Tony had nicknamed her sunbeam for a reason - though as she grew, she naturally lost a little bit of her glow - replaced with a seriousness that her dads loved all the same. And then there’s now, swinging her legs with her head cocked to the side, Mila looks much more like the innocent, curious toddler that Tony hasn’t seen in years, and much less like a fourteen year old who has been missing for two months.
Her head flicks up to stare at the elevator.
Even now, with her thoughts redacted and coded in some complex way which the child hasn't quite managed to decipher yet, the song is there. There aren't any words that Percie can pick out, just indecipherable music that spins on and on like a record that somebody kept composing and composing and forgot to ever bring to a solid conclusion.
She manages a small nod, though whimpers a little when the room starts to spin.
he be a Colin?").
"We can't tell anybody", Peter's voice quivered on every word, Percie raised her eyes to meet his, "we aren't supposed to be in here, we'll get in trouble".
He's saying something as he tries to calm her thrashing, probably trying to settle her but she can't focus on the words and it only upsets her more.
The man opens his arms to accept his (apparently alive) niece into them, collecting her in a gentle and so-very-Bruce hug.
"We've been running some tests, and we need to run some more because right now we don't know what's causing this. We're keeping her temperature as low as possible with some fluids and cooling packs, but she's still running at 106, and that isn't ideal, nor is it normal. She's had two more seizures, likely induced by the heat however there could be another cause, and after the last we lost her for a few minutes, so we're keeping her on support for the time being", Bruce's voice is so soft and steady but Tony can't understand how because he didn't seriously just tell him that his child died.
(See the end of the chapter for
Initially, he didn't even check the caller ID, he rejected the call without looking at the screen. But then it rang again, and again, and then Pepper gave him a nudge, "Go on Tony, pick it up, it's clearly important".
When he panics, when his world flips and everyone runs around like headless chickens, his primal urge is to tinker with a piece of scrap metal. More importantly, if there's something he can fix, he will.
“Of course”, he presses a kiss to her head and manoeuvres them both so that they’re lying down, Persephone curled into his chest. By the time he’s managed to achieve a comfortable position, she’s already out.
Once she's sitting, she can see that she's in the MedBay. May is crouched at the end of her bed and offers a shaky smile when they make eye contact. Persephone just frowns.
All she could think about was the fact that if she died then Papa would probably never know.
The child whimpered, pressing her face into his neck, unable to convey just how miserable she felt, "I know baby, I know", Tony pressed a kiss to the top of her head, wishing more than anything that he could fix this like he could a glitch with Dum-E or U. Human babies are so much more complicated. The mechanic has had way too many moments over the past eight years in which he's panicked with the knowledge that Persephone is a real human being with real emotions and a personality and human requirements, way too many moments in which he's wondered if he's fit to be a parent, if adopting her was the right decision. She could have stayed in the system, met another (less dysfunctional) family, and maybe she'd never have ended up in this position (deep down Tony knew that Persephone Fern Rogers-Stark would manage to find trouble wherever she went, even with a different surname). And this kid worshipped him, Steve had said it a few weeks after she came to live with them, she looked at him as though he hung the stars in the sky; though she loved Steve, she'd always been Tony's child at heart.
Tony is fully aware that this is an insane situation. His daughter - his daughter who was kidnapped after her dance class, who he searched for relentlessly for weeks, who he watched die on camera - has walked right into her home, largely unharmed, talking to them relatively openly. And that is the only reason that he isn’t demanding straight answers.
“Wednesday, February 12th”, Bruce replies evenly.
Although, in a way, the absurdity of the situation is a tad comforting. Normally, temperatures like that would kill, it's insane that the kids managed to reach those kind of numbers anyway, meaning that this isn't a usual sickness. If Percie and Peter aren't reacting in the way that they should, there's a chance that they could just miraculously pop out the other side, bubbly and bouncy as ever. That's the knowledge that fuels Tony to keep his mechanic brain in control, his dad brain can wait.
“What day is it?”.
A jarring monotonous tone begins to blare and all Percie wants to do is get away from it all.
“Dot I swear if you don’t stop that right now I might just leave again”.
She frowns, “Sometimes, I mean, if I move too much they can-“ she lets out a small grunt of frustration and brings her hands up to cover her face, dropping them back down after a moment, “It’s complicated I’m sorry, I don’t know how to explain without.. without describing the whole thing”.
Percie hasn't just caught some 24 hour bug and reacted badly, she isn't just stressed and worked up, his baby is sick and in trouble and it isn't going to be fixed by Pepto-Bismol. The doctor says nothing, just nods his head in the direction of the room which Percie is in and waits for Tony to follow.
“Yeah, you’re missing the fact that it’s Saturday evening, you shouldn’t be working.” Tony smiles at him, gently taking the piece of paper Steve was still holding into his hands and putting it away with the rest.
There’s a sudden spark into Steve’s eyes that tells him yes, this is something he can most definitely do. Almost out of ideas, Tony sighs of relief as the other launches himself into a passionate account, lining more words one after the other than he’s done during the whole evening.
. How can you even just
worry about the future, his brain constantly running at high speed because stillness equals death to him (alas, the high intake of caffeine in his blood definitely doesn’t help – so although total silence is not in his repertoire, he settles for the next best thing: brevity. He looks at his companion, and for a brief, mad second he’s actually tempted to lean his hand over Steve’s again,
“Stark?”
, but now he’s got all of his attention.
now, and although it’s nothing unbearable, the gesture alone is enough to enrage Tony more than he frankly has the right to.
“I… I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done that.”
The glance that Steve gives him now is one of pure confusion, which tells him that maybe he did, maybe he didn’t, but either way, he never came up with an answer that completely satisfied him. He stays silent, shaking his head.
For a couple of seconds, no more, nobody talks.
“It’s okay, once you see
“Say it, Steve.” he sighs, and he swears, he’s gonna buy him a book about flirting one of these days.
“So, I… I’d got you a thing, right?, back when… I mean, just after you slept at my place, in the summer. And, I don’t know, I guess it was supposed to be for Christmas or something, I didn’t know how long we were gonna be gone – Fury didn’t tell me
Steve has said these last words somewhat slower, and if Tony didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was because he was back at being his usual awkward self, but that’s not it. He could be wrong – and he probably

“You know, I’d never seen sushi like this.”

The robber doesn’t indulge him further though, carelessly waving his gun in the air as he warns him: “Not another movement of
, he would not hear the end of the tease for a damn long time.
From his part, Tony is one hundred percent sure that he hasn’t heard him correctly, it just can’t be what he thought the other just asked. He frowns, and although he’d rather not have to do this, he pulls out of the armor and back on the table, grease on his hands and his face as he grabs what used to be a white towel to wipe some of it off his skin as much as he can before looking at Steve.
“You can say that. Shall we?”
There’s a soft general chuckle in the office between the other employees, and Miss Goodwin winks at him as if they were sharing a secret – Tony is totally sure that she’s had a crush on him since he first walked in for his interview, fourteen months ago – but other than that, nobody tells him off or seems to take notice of his one-minute delay or the fact that he’s clearly been sprinting all the way down here. That’s one of the reasons why he likes working here, despite the inherent element of danger that a job like this carries along: he gets to be around nice people, have a stable schedule which allows him to work on his side project as well, and the pay is good. Of course, this is not what he wants to do with his life, but hey, when you’re 29 in this century you can’t afford to be just a dreamer, you need cash too in order to survive.

“Woah, take it easy, can’t just expect to start talking with a tube down your throat now, can you?”
everything in the room is. He’s seen a few hospitals in recent years – mostly British, but also some field ones – and none ever remotely resembled this. And it’s not only about the environment around him either. It’s also the fact that he’s
“Oh, by now I eat anything, really. Although I have to say, I don’t understand half of what’s written on this menu…” he chuckles softly, and Tony has to keep himself in check to not stretch his hand over his.

“Steve, wh—“
, he thinks as Steve stands up and begins pacing up and down the living room, spitting out so many words in one go that Tony can’t recall another time when he got so long-winded.
“Answer my question, Stark.”
“No, it’s… it’s
The morning alarm pierces through his ears and brain, making him painfully aware, even before he opens his eyes, that a huge headache is going to hit him as soon as he does, about fifteen seconds later, unable to ignore the incessant blip on the clock.
Which is a good sign, isn’t it?
“Nat helped.”
“What can I say? You make great speeches and I didn’t know what to say in reply so I figured…”
“This is more fucked up than I had imagined, Jesus Christ…”
“I’ve never… stopped.”
“Then I’m gonna take my sweet time with you.
Steve shakes his head, now visibly awkward, and sighs heavily before distending one of his hands underneath a pillow and taking a small black box out, holding it tight as speaking again.
“What mission?”
“Harder, Steve, go
“And I talk way too much, that’s why we work so well together” he interrupts him, mostly because he wants to understand what the hell is happening. “Just spit it out, Rogers, c’mon.”
“Thank god you’re all in one piece…” he mumbles as soon as air hits his lungs again, sniffing the other’s neck and smiling more convincingly now that he knows it’s for real.
He lifts his gaze on Steve, finding a dead-ass stance in his blue eyes now.
They speak at the same time, which makes him smile, earnestly albeit just a bit, because that always used to happen and it’s good to see that after all old habits are indeed hard to die.
“Sir, I was wondering…” Jarvis’ voice recalls him to the present, and even before the butler can ask his question, Steve already knows he’s going to say yes. Please give me something to do.
?” he replies, puzzled albeit all too happy to see Steve in front of his very eyes, in his joggers and t-shirt, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.
“Thought I’d give you the benefit of the doubt… Besides, if I had said something, you’d have never made it out of bed. You know that, right?”
“Yeah, pretty much…” he agrees, suddenly feeling as tired as ever and needing a cup of coffee. “How are things around here anyway?”
“Steve…” he whispers – now even just saying his name gives him goosebumps, and how significant is that? – shaking his head lightly whilst struggling to find the courage to say the words he
mention the idea of marriage on a first date?”
Rhodey’s jaw drops down at the further disclosure, his face one of pure disbelief: “Okay,
about it, not just because he and dating don’t exactly go along, but also because Steve and he have very different taste about people, not to mention the qualities they look for into a potential partner – the subject has come up a few times before, because although being a superhero sounds thrilling, there is indeed a lot of waiting around involved, with related boring conversations.
“Oh, it wasn’t me, believe it or not.”
“I’m… fine, I just… remembered something.” Steve manages to articulate eventually, blinking away his stillness although still averting the other’s gaze. “You… You go ahead, I’m gonna walk a bit longer, I think I ate too much…”
“You didn’t really believe I would back down so easily, did you? Don’t worry, your baby is safe and sound. Just a couple of scratches, but once I finish with this new coating paint I’ve been developing, it’ll be good as new. As I said, you’ll get it back once I’m sure it’s safe for you to be active again.”
It’s almost six pm on Christmas Eve and although Tony has someplace to be downtown Manhattan (more than one to be fair, but you get the gist), he is still sitting in the kind of garage that has been serving as his lab since the Avengers have found their new location in this cave/mountain upstate New York. He’ll get to the party (part
Fury’s voice brings him back to reality. He takes a deep breath, closing his eyes for a moment, then shakes his head: “Can’t do it right now, Nick. I’m a mess. If you can put it on hold for a while, then maybe. But I need to clear my mind first. I hope you can see my point.”
“Who’s Jocasta?” asks Steve, frowning and looking down at him, visibly confused.
“Okay, I’ve had enough now, out of my r—“
for the longest time, the thought never even entering his brain. How could it? It was enough to lose Tony for all of seven years – time he so wishes he could reclaim back, only it doesn’t work that way, does it? – but now that it’s
“How do you conclude a date, Steve?” he answers, the tone of someone who’s explaining how addition works to a three year old. “Let’s say you’ve walked me home or whatever. You’ve enjoyed this person’s company and would like to see them again. Put this into action.”
help, or go against his wishes. “Except if it comes from Pepper Potts or Steve Rogers.”
Of course, Steve reacts in the only way he possibly can: he freezes up, and stops talking abruptly, right in the middle of a sentence, his eyes throwing not so subtle glances at their two hands joined together.
. The word almost steals a laughter out of him.
“Wow. You’re so good at motivational speeches, Nick…”
“Do ten, for fuck’s sake! He’s a super soldier, don’t you know that?!”
. So he straightens his back against the beach chair, takes a sip of his whiskey and spits the truth out once and for all.

“Welcome to the world of Nick Fury, Mr. Rogers. This is his modus operandi,” the guy with the glasses – Bruce – explains, just before turning his attention back to the man sitting at the head of the table. “Speaking of, why are
“Because… like it or not you were born at the beginning of last century, and the way we grow up… well, I believe it stays with us no matter what we do or how hard we try to fight it or forget it. Mind you, nobody ever came up to me and say it plain and clear, but these are our teammates we’re talking about, don’t you think they would eventually notice something was up with the two of us? I mean, I was actually surprised it took them
“Nothing, I just wanted to know how did I score today,” the other shrugs, and then, as catching his interrogative glance: “You know. The scale. Zero to ten?”
But what nobody else knows is that Tony does indeed have a contingency plan. One that, if it comes down to it, he won’t hesitate to put into action. He has been working on it for quite some time now, although it really came together once he got back on Earth, after that solitary and atrocious journey in an alien spaceship.
So he stays silent, and just lightly brushes his pinky finger against the other’s hand, his glance fixed on the swaying couples on the floor, a tight knot in his throat because he can’t believe what he has just done. But before he can get overcome by second thoughts, the gesture is returned, his heartbeat picks up pace, and a joyful smile quickly occupies the width of his face.

“... He had help.” Tony comes to his rescue while he finally takes a seat, giving the brief shake of head to Carol to divert further questions on the topic, hoping that the movement would prompt his partner to follow his lead. Which, although in an extremely robotic way, it does, Steve nodding to nobody in particular as sitting down next to him (Tony had made sure they agreed on the seating plan beforehand to avoid further elements of disturbance to Steve’s ability to get through the dinner - read: foot touching foot, rubbing of each other’s hands and so on).
Tony is not exactly the romantic kind – cheesiness doesn’t come natural to him, possibly because growing up he never saw any display of affection between his parents, and although his mother never failed to show him love and attention, he was mainly taught that a man

“The hell with that,” is the curt reply, a hand already stretched out to find the reassuring hardness of the wall; only before it can, his strength already abandons him and his body gives way. Luckily for him, Steve is already on his feet, ready to catch him.
“It’s the garden, sir. We have just received a delivery of fruit trees that need to be transplanted.”
“Yes, don’t worry…” the other nods, although his voice sounds a bit rough. “Your shield absorbed most of the blast anyway. What kind of material did you say…?”
“Steve,

. A year is a hell of a long time to be gone. People have probably thought him dead. Suddenly, he starts thinking about Steve, and Pepper, and Peter, and Bruce, and the kids Fury told him about before he left. A growing sense of uneasiness mixed with guilt is easily finding its way into his heart.
Anything but this.
“Could you shut up about this?”
. He’s impressed.
“Kept waiting on an invitation, but it never came. Told myself not to take it personally, but well... hard to do when you’ve invited even Hank’s ants over and not me...”
Tony nods and holds his breath as if he was underwater until the man leaves the room and closes the door behind; the silence explodes between the walls and inside of him, and all he can do is dropping on his knees, shaking as he begins to sob and cry as quietly as he can.
“I-I’m going back to sleep,” he murmurs eventually, slowly walking all around Steve in a circumference so big that he almost touches the walls all around.

, that Tony is always left wondering about his thoughts, his emotions, sometimes – when he’s feeling particularly low – even his love for him. Tony has accepted and gone along with it for as long as he can remember, thinking that because he wasn’t aware about other people knowing the truth it would be better to make it
Tony stays silent for a couple of seconds, mostly to give the impression that he’s really
Steve snuffs, really wishing the guy hadn’t touched his drink without asking – he doesn’t know why it bothers him, but it really does – and swallows the rest of the liquid to prevent both answering the question and the accident to happen a second time. Mark gives him a long glance, and just as Steve is about to take his leave the guy grabs his hand and pulls it to make him stand up.
“Ssso, to summarize… It’s 2019, I’ve been frozen for seventy years, superheroes and demigods actually
Steve is the first one to come back to his senses, thanks to large part to his military experience. He rushes towards him, managing to catch him as his knees give way, just before he goes crashing on the ground.
It’s not exactly a nightmare – he’s living through the worst thing that could happen to him, he believes, so nothing that comes up in his sleep can ever be a match – but it’s not pleasant either – again, nice dreams stopped being a reality a good three years ago now – because he’s stuck in a dark, tiny prison cell with no windows in sight. He can spot a key hanging on a wall, but no matter how hard he tries to reach out for it, the distance stays the same.
The jet is almost back to the Tower when it happens, and although there’s only the tiniest change on the screen (if you can call the fact that for just a couple of seconds the blue dot doesn’t move as such), Tony immediately picks up on it, because… well, it’s not that he has a sixth sense or had a premonition, but by now, worrying has become sort of his second nature.

The conversation naturally switches to their usual topics – whether they should update the team’s rooster and with whom, who is Clint dating, how long until the X-Men bring another disaster to their doorstep – and for a while they forget they’re on a pretend-date, at least until the bill gets left on the table for anyone to grab. Tony doesn’t flinch, waiting to see what his dining partner will do, and despite stretching a hand to grab it, Steve actually stops halfway through to look at him, biting his lip as withdrawing his fingers.

He’s already out of the room when Steve’s voice reaches him from behind: “Clothes? What are you talking about?”
“Fair enough. I… I’m gonna go back then. Let me know if you need anything.”
“What was her name?”

“Right…”
“G-Guess so…” he replies, noticing just now that the other’s hand is upon his. So he takes it to his lips to leave a soft kiss on its back, staring at his man in silence and smiling as brightly as he can.
“You guys are late.” Danvers remarks in a jokingly way, immediately followed by Drew’s comment (“If this was a real date someone could think it’s because you were having hot, pre-dinner sex”) which, hadn’t it sounded so impromptu, one would have thought it had been rehearsed.
“Woah, slow down. You saw an
voice – says all of a sudden, and Tony has to really keep himself from screaming out loud now. He ventures a look at Steve, trying to smile despite it all but falling short in his attempt. He snuffles then, quick to hide any trace that could spur the rumors that he is indeed, after all, irremediably human. Tony can’t allow that to happen, not today, not in the nearby future. Not when there are so many things to discuss and settle; not when he’s the only one both the public and the government can rely upon.
The man gestures toward a couch on the side that he hadn’t noticed yet as is kind of hidden away at first sight; Tony would prefer to stand, or at least to sit normally, each of them at the opposite sides of the desk, but he has no alternative except following the lead.
Rogers?”
“… Oh.” It’s all Steve says in response, feeling quite dull right now, having weird flashbacks to the faraway time before he became Captain America when this kind of embarrassment was an ordinary event in his life. He doesn’t exactly know why this stuff is so damn hard for him, and wonders why Tony’s influence is not having a better effect. If anything, it seems to be making things
“I don’t know, I wasn’t told.”
“Had to see you.” he smiles harmlessly, and that’s enough for Tony to snap off his trance and leap towards the other, grabbing the collar of his t-shirt to pull Steve’s face to his lips, starting to kiss him with a hunger that he had no idea was residing within him. His rational side knows that this can’t be a social visit, that there’s something else, that Nick would have never ever agreed to tell him his location, but right now he couldn’t care less about any of that, all he wants are his kisses and feeling his body against his and smelling the perfume of his aftershave on himself, because it’s been too fucking long and it had been driving him insane. Tony’s hands are already slipping underneath his shirt, caressing his abs while his mouth goes on Steve’s neck, nibbling it slightly harder than his intentions were, but self-control has never been his forte, it’d be stupid to think he could have any now; he can feel his briefs and trousers growing tighter and the thought of that makes him moan on the other’s skin, and before he realizes his hands are trailing down to undo his belt as his head starts feeling even lighter, all of his thoughts disappearing from his mind because he just can’t think anymore, he has to explore and touch and…

Of course he does. And of course these words make all the sense in the world. Tony slowly nods and gives him half a smirk: “Alright, hot shot, we get it, you’re very…
That does the trick, because Tony finally opens his eyes with what seems to be a huge effort, blinking a couple of times as taking the room in before focusing on the two arms around his body.
Tony thinks with a hint of sadness, without saying it out loud; instead, he finds himself completely captured by the way Steve is now talking, totally different from just a few seconds ago, as if he was reciting the words of a prayer which gave him the strength to go on, no matter what sorts of problems might come his way. Matter of fact, he gets so deeply fascinated that he even forgets that he wanted to test Steve out by seeing how he’d react when confronted with a sudden change of circumstances. So when he lays his hand upon the other’s after a while, he himself is not quite sure whether he is doing it on purpose or because it just felt like the right thing to do.

“Tony…”
It’s only when the head physician starts shaking him by his arms that he opens his eyes again, regaining a sense of himself and his surroundings.

“Great, uh… I’ll see you tomorrow, then.”
“Oookay, enough is enough!” T’Challa’s voice echoes in the room, powerful and hard, making them both shut up all at once. “Look, I don’t know what the hell is going on with you two today, but I don’t want to hear it. Solve whatever problem happened last night
He knows Steve is right behind him now, so he takes a deep breath and turns to face him.
But as it turns out, Steve has no intention of actually letting him using the sofa. Tony has just sat down on it –

“Yeah, today. If you don’t have plans already, of course.”

“Look, I know it might not look like it, but I’m actually Tony Stark, I’m technically your boss, so…”

“Because it can happen if what you’re saying resonates with the person in front of you or it’s fascinating...” he replies, feeling like he’s actually having a chat with a ten-year old kid instead. Which is probably what Steve is, coming to think about it, when you consider the time during which he was a teenager and how the Second World War practically took away that from him and many others of his generation. In comparison, his despised years at boarding school look like a walk in the park

“Guess you’re right…” the other man says, slowly as to take time to come up with something else, but as his eyes meet Tony’s, still smiling, he finds himself incapable of doing that, just because he doesn’t
“Sorry I’m late...” he offers as soon as the elevator doors open, but much to his surprise there’s nobody there, except for the holographic projection of one of his I.A., serving as the welcoming party for the Tower.
“Do you need to check in with your chickens and cows – do you have cows? – for the day, or are you pretty much free?”
Tony sighs deeply, rubbing his forehead and staying silent because he wouldn’t know what to say, not yet; a vague idea has started forming in his brain as hearing Steve talking, but he’s not very fond of it and doesn’t want it to share until he has more data. That is, if it’s still possible to speak in such terms now.
, he wonders, and for the first time he realizes he is able to
“You’ve mistaken me for my twin brother…” Tony replies, and just like that the spell is over, the other’s walls are back up as they always are. Steve sighs whilst leaning back against the pillows, and watches with slight amusement the comical sketch that ensues. After Tony is made to leave - he suspects it is for good this time - the nurse, whose name is Sarah, asks him a few questions about any pain, whether he’d like something to eat or drink, and how he feels on a general level. He replies politely, reassuring her a couple of times that the visit didn’t disturb him at all, but his mind is someplace else, rewinding the mostly one-sided conversation he just had with Tony. All throughout, there had been a lingering feeling in his words, but it was so well-hidden that he couldn’t name it, not exactly. He’s thinking about guilt, remorse, sadness, impotence maybe, but neither of them quite cuts it. There’s more.
“Gotta be honest with you, Steve. Your conversational skills kinda suck.”
There is a collective holding of breath as he pronounces that name, and that makes him want to smile because, in a dark day like this one, this might be the only good thing he gets out of it. He’s been in contact with Bruce on and off since getting back from space, knows
“Late for what? It’s Sunday.”

The guy is about to reply something far less kind, when a familiar voice makes them both stop and turn towards her: “Tony?”
, taking a tentative step towards the other man. Which has the only effect of making Tony take one back, stretching both arms out as to put more distance between the two of them.
“This is really unnecessary, Steve, the sofa thingy will do just fine.”

And properties? And…” he stops before his words become an overflowing torrent. He shakes his head and tries to give Pepper a smile, which doesn’t quite appear. “Sorry. I’ll be okay.”
“At least I’m having a good time…”
“What?”
“Honestly? I don’t have a clue!” he replies in all honestly, finally turning to face Steve, grabbing the hand that’s keeping him in place by the wrist and pushing it away. “Now if you don’t
when the truth appears to be so self-evident that it’s kind of impossible to ignore. For the first time, an incredible thought flashes out in his mind: could Steve be feeling the same way he is? Furthermore, would he consider this to be an

to ask the question back: “Do you?”
“Steve Rogers… Captain America is dead, sir.”
“Why are you so edgy?” Tony chuckles, patting his cheek as an encouraging gesture, or at least that’s what he tells himself, because he has no idea what just prompted him to do that. It doesn’t make any
it because his own body is refusing to cooperate; his hands are on Steve’s back now, almost grasping to it, and his legs want to cling around his waist so he can be held into his arms, suspended from the floor, away from every perception of being somewhat grounded. As if he was indeed reading into his mind, Steve catches both of his legs to give them the chance to wrap around his own body, and in that moment Tony has to make a plea, because it’s now or never.
“I thought you had done your research, Stark. Our new ‘president’ did. He doesn’t like folks like me in a position of power, whatever that might be. So before he could sack me, I resigned. That way, I got to maintain my dignity.”
It’s not hard to imagine the situation – after all he had always felt Steve and Ross were two sides of the same person, kind of like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, both incredibly stubborn, both absolutely convinced of the implicit
Steve is about to push him aside when Tony intervenes, with a surprisingly calm voice.
Still, as he makes his way out of the car and into the bank, Tony can’t help but wishing he hadn’t behaved like he did, because after his outburst Jarvis had not come anywhere near him until he left, not even whilst he was having breakfast (usually he’d get distracted for a reason or another only to find the kitten either licking butter off his toast or with his tiny paw inside his coffee). He had tried calling him with a soft voice and even a few treats just before opening the front door, but Jarvis hadn’t come anyway, and when five minutes has gone by Tony had had to give up to not be late for work. Still,  his mind has kept going back to the kitten throughout the whole ride, and even now his thoughts are all for Jarvis, home alone for the next twelve hours.
“If you’ve gotta know, I
His back is turned against the soldier now as he takes a few steps away from him, a dull hope that distance might help whatever this is hurting less. Of course, it’s pointless, and he didn’t expect it to work in the first place, but sometimes you can’t do much except wishing for the best. As he moves to the big window behind his desk, Tony’s eyes encounter many pictures, all too painful memories of their life together, the same life that now Steve is tearing away just with a few, almost whispered words that nevertheless feel like precise stabs to Tony’s heart. Except for one – which is of the whole team after their first victory together – all of the others are from

“Oh you know I like to keep my eye on you.”
The days waiting in the hospital, the flipping out about Steve wanting to get out, the lack of interaction between them afterwards.
Tony nods vaguely, wishing he could focus on whatever Steve has just said but finding it impossible to do, not when his body is in such a disarray of feelings and needs. He lets his crotch go once he’s sure the crucial moment has passed, and forces himself to lift up his glaze on the man in front of him, shaking his head to get rid of the fluster on his face.

It’s relatively quiet – after all it’s before six on a weekday – and they play good enough music, nothing of that nonsensical pop that sounds all the same, with no meaning whatsoever. They sit on a table away from the dance floor, much to his relief, and Sam walks up to the counter to order some drinks. With him gone, Steve realizes he hasn’t had a proper conversation with either of them since… the first snap, of course, but also after the second one, his heart becoming whole as hearing their voices and seeing their faces again for just the shortest while before breaking all over again. And this time, Steve immediately
Tony blinks – this is the first time in almost two weeks of knowing him that Steve has been

“Tony, what—“
“Woah, slow down. We’re not even in New York, not yet. Plus, we still have a mission to complete. I said I won’t be joining the others, but that doesn’t mean I—“
After a few minutes, he feels Steve’s hand on his shoulder, its firm but delicate grip has become so
“I… guess…? I mean…” he pauses, bites his lower lip and sighs softly before finally meeting Tony’s eyes, waiting for him. “I had a… really nice time, Tony. Thanks for agreeing to it.”
Tony lets a puzzled whistle go: “And you’ve had time to buy all of this stuff in just two months?! Never took you for a hoarder, Rogers…”

, he thinks to himself, standing up and taking the flowers from the other’s hands, sniffing them and closing his eyes to avoid a slight fluster from conquering his cheeks.
, but before he can formulate a complete thought or even just say goodbye Tony has left his side.
“You are most welcome.”
, he asks himself, but of course looking back at it now he can see the signs popping up at more and more increasing speed ever since early 2016, four years ago. Damn, the Accords themselves could easily be inserted in this same narrative of fear and xenophobia.
As it sometimes happens, Tony doesn’t actually know what that word means, so he just shrugs lightly: “Getting acquainted with it…”
The high-pitched voice of a woman brings him back to the present, and to his plan for the night, which is to dance until his feet hurt and maybe snatch a kiss (or two) on the dance floor. But in order to achieve this, he needs to forget about his work and the war raging outside, at least for a few hours. He can do that, right? He damn

“C’mon, let it loose…”

and not awkward, which is allowing both of them to relax and be like their usual selves.
“You’re just an incompetent bitch! I wanna talk to a manager or something!”
“Nothing escapes Tony Stark, uh? And you wonder why I want you to be my partner…”
“Sir? We’re here.”
It takes them almost four hours to accept the new arrangement, and it’s only after a couple of shouting matches, a few flying fists and a demonstration in which Tony proves that the backdoor
“We’re here, we’re all g—“ Steve starts replying, but before he can finish his sentence Tony closes the already small gap between them and leans the tiniest of pecks upon the other’s lips. When he’ll think about about it later, it’ll surprise him to realize that he didn’t actually
“Strongest cocktail you can,” he replies, slipping a hand into his back pocket to get ahold of his wallet. But before he can grab it, an arm gently hugs his waist, making his eyes widen with surprise and mixed feelings surge into his stomach. It’s rejection and guilt and sickness, but also need for intimacy and release and an anger he’s never actually dealt with.
“I think there’s a reason why you didn’t.”
anywhere, or that there’s even a bottom or end to be reached. He’s just about to give up and call it off when again, the tiniest flicker of a light catches his attention, and he follows it without hesitation. A couple of minutes later, he emerges in what seems to be a clearing of sorts – although he has no idea whatsoever how such a thing is even

that the words refuse to come out.
“What!? Tony! What am I supposed to do with all that stuff?”
“I need to get back…” he mumbles, more to himself that to his audience. He pauses for a second, trying to work the logistics out, then looks at Quill again and does something that he would never have thought he’d do: he asks for help.
“… Would you mind if I held on to you again? I feel like I’m losing balance…” he explains after a moment of hesitation, because he just had a weird sensation right in the pit of his stomach when Steve gave him that look, and he has no idea
“How long are we talking about, exactly?”
“Always.”
He wants so desperately to lie, to say that he was just really pissed off with Nick for the way he’s kept him in the dark this whole time, as if he was not to be trusted; but he’s tired from having to lead a double life as it is and he knows Steve would read right through his thoughts, so he just goes with the truth: “It’s hard, one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. And I’m so… forcefully isolated that I had to upgrade Jocasta to have someone to talk to…”
“I don’t exactly have one, Rhodey. I just need to get away for a while.” Tony replies after a few seconds of consideration, then turns to face his friend: “I’ve called off the engagement too. I just… The past eleven years have been so crazy that I don’t know who I am anymore.” he pauses again before reiterating the concept, just in case: “I need to get away for a while.”
“Not at all, I’ve been up for a couple of hours already.” he lies, grabbing his sPad to order a triple shot caramel macchiato from the coffee shop nearby. “How are you, John?”

“Yeah, well… Fury helped me setting that up. For appearances, you know.”

“Getting these damn rings back, that’s what I’m doing. I’ve lost enough time trying to play nice. Turns out my father was right after all. Sometimes the end does justify the means. This is an example.”

He lifts a hand up, moves some of the blond hair out of Steve’s forehead, sighing quietly as doing so, because his skin is cold and sweaty and Tony knows it’s not a good sign. He stays there, still and mute, and doesn’t even know how much time passes before he starts rambling, more to himself than to Steve really, because at this point he’s very much sure the other is passed out. Nobody
“Why did you suggest it then?”
They should hug, but they don’t. He’s scared of what his mind could conjure up in those few seconds. Unwanted memories. Painful feelings. He gives her the faintest of smiles and then he’s on his way.
But Tony is not about to let that go, and finishes the sentence in his place: “It was your plan all along, wasn’t it? This was indeed a date, you wanted it to be… Wow, I have to say, I
“Well, yes, I’d say so, since I’m talking to you…” comes the reply, as he moves his right hand out of the sheet so that Tony can grab it.
Tony shakes his head, frustrated and tired and so wanting to be done with absolutely everything. It’s merely been a few months since he’s got back from his space adventure, but it already feels like a decade.
“Is he conscious?”
So that’s why he didn’t know about it. Feeling somewhat relieved, Tony’s brain fires up a couple of moments later as realizing that this will give him a perfect opportunity to have a face to face with Fury (and hopefully Steve too). He just needs to get the message along.
“The rest of the team
this night is going to live up to its potential: he can feel it in his bones and maybe even smell it in the air. Or maybe it’s just wishful thinking from his part, the desire to escape what has now become a dull normality for his days, in and out of that badly lit room, back hunched over papers and maps for hours on end, progress too slow for his liking. And so, when he caught the voice of someone mentioning there was a new music hall in the neighborhood, just across their office, his ears latched onto that new bit of information and held tight to it till the end of the day when, having bid goodnight to the rest of the company, he took the turn for the exit instead of the stairs, and promptly made his way to the subway, where he got on the first train towards downtown.
, and I didn’t ask your permission…”
Peter would like to ask him
. Why, are you saying you couldn’t date an ex alcoholic?”
Steve.”
As he steps out of the elevator, he notices just how
what he does now, bowing slightly to pass underneath his arm.
The ringing of his phone wakes him up abruptly after a mere three hours of uncomfortable sleep – he dozed off while working on an algorithm to broaden his pagers’ frequency to more than one thousand miles, something that has been proving to be really challenging; he taps the button on the side of his StarkBud and answers the call, rubbing exhaustion off his eyes.
“Thank god for shift changing,” the other smirks, taking a seat right where he had been the day - probably days, now that he has been filled in - before. “How are we doing?”
about it.”
So, as he usually tends to do in circumstances like this, he starts investing money (turns out winning an election is a massive boost in your finances) in the most random stuff Pepper passes on to him: charities, MIT projects, medical studies and so on, he doesn’t even read the prospectus because he trusts her judgement and knows she’s extremely thorough (way more than he himself could ever be), but he always makes sure that the source is listed as a subsidiary of the Stark Industries and not himself, as to have deniability. Figuring it’s time to stop living in hotel rooms, he buys a penthouse near Central Park and moves in the day afterwards, spending the weekend ordering furniture and appliances he doesn’t even know if he actually needs online and waiting for it all to be delivered, making sure to tip generously the person as working on a Saturday must be a pain in the ass. Although he gets off the right foot, taking his stuff out of the boxes and storing it away with some resemblance of logic, he pretty soon has enough of this dull exercise and just starts pushing it all in one corner, promising himself he’ll eventually get on with it, once he’s more settled in. After a week, the majority of the boxes is still unpacked and he spends most of his time either in the mini-lab he’s assembled (in what used to be a living room) or monitoring the internet for any possible sign of Steve in news written in a language he has no idea even existed.
Ben appears in her field of vision, on the opposite side to Bruce. They're both much more gentle than Percie can ever remember them being, including the time when Bruce had to remove shards of glass from her foot. It's slightly unsettling.
Her arms wrap around his middle, her face pressed into his drenched t-shirt, and although Steve knows this, he can’t quite believe it.
There’s a crater in her upper left arm.
Mila grins, “Hi Uncle Bruce”.
happy 2021 babies
They tiptoed across the floor, dancing around shattered glass and spilled chemicals, slipping out through the same door they entered in and leaving the room exactly as they found it, save for the spider in the middle of the floor.
"Jarvis time it", he choked out, throwing himself from his stool to the cold, tiled floor and placing his hand under her head to prevent it smacking against the stone again. Her breathing was ragged and laboured, leaving her mouth with soft whimpers that twisted invisible hands around Tony's throat, "Oh baby- I'm sorry, I'm so sorry", he ignored the telltale sting of his eyes that meant tears were about to roll down his cheeks, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry". If she didn't wake up, if she stopped breathing and he couldn't get her to start again, the last thing she will have ever known will have been her only remaining parent swearing at her for feeling sick. His last days with her will have been spent practically forgetting she existed, wallowing in self-pity and mourning the loss of a man who abandoned her.
She trails off, and though none of the adults in the room are comfortable with it, Steve puts a comforting hand on her back and the topic is abandoned.
"I did... Jarvis?".
"Tony.. what is it?", May queries, a level of uncertainty implying that she's wary of the answer she might receive.
He registered Percie's entrance, that something was off, but interacting with her meant facing the reality that he was a single parent now. The baby he adopted with Steve was solely his responsibility and she couldn't be more perfect, way way too much purity for him to taint and twist. He should've taken her with him, Steve and James could have raised her, given her a good shot at life without the possibility that Tony could just fuck it all up with the slip of a tongue.
Tony has to ask himself the same question.
And as though they have their own centre of gravity, two bright red, irritated and inflamed scars drag everybody’s eyes towards them. They slice across Mila’s shoulder blades at almost 45 degree angles, stretching from her shoulders to mid-back - appearing to glow against her pale skin.
It would be way too coincidental to not be related to Oscorp, Tony mentally berates himself for having not known about the trip in the first place. He probably wouldn't have let her go, Oscorp are into some shady, unethical shit - things he ideally wouldn't have his daughter in the same world as, let alone the same building. Norman Osborne unsettles him on a grand scale.
(See the end of the chapter for
He's unsure as to how long he sat there, gripping her hand and willing her to open her eyes to no avail. At some point, not long after Bruce left, Pepper entered, teary eyed and quiet. She sat beside Tony in another horrible plastic chair and put an arm around him. That's how they stayed until Tony's phone rang.
On reflection, Tony is fully aware of this. Kids don’t just go missing in bulk and then turn up on doorsteps completely unharmed. In all honesty, the mechanic had completely forgotten about the six other kids that vanished at the same time, until he couldn’t anymore.
Dad was distant, like usual. He didn't seem to notice that anything was up, and if he did then he couldn't muster the energy to respond. Percie decided that it was probably better that way, if he found out about what she'd done then he'd just be angry and she didn't want him to get angry again. All she had to do was keep her head down until the nausea passed or she keeled over and died, whichever came first.
She dragged her aching body out of bed, every part of her protesting the movement. Her vision blurred and span, causing her to reach out to hold onto the wall until her cotton-wool-stuffed head could catch up with the minor change in altitude. Heavy and nauseous, her body carried her on autopilot to the kitchen, steadying herself on the counter as soon as she reached where she needed to be.
Both Bruce and Tony look up at Steve, then follow his eye-line.
Mila Stark is padding down the hallway, light-footed as always, her doggy-companion mouthing at her ankles and causing the teenager to stumble in her attempts to avoid stepping on the mongrel’s head.
Peter looked horrified, his hand still suffocating his own arm with its identical puncture marks, two pinpricks of ruby-red. The poison which flowed into his bloodstream licked flames up his limb, fizzing as it travelled further and further into his body. He didn't know much about spiders, not like Percie did, but he was sure that this was going to kill him, and now he'd gotten his best friend killed too. Distantly he recognised that panicking probably wasn't the solution here, he should tell an adult and get help from somebody who knew what they were doing, perhaps there was an antidote somewhere in the building. Surely people get bitten all the time.. right? There must be an antidote.
Ben frowns, "What do you mean?".
“Steve I swear, she was- she was in the lobby and I brought her up here and- and look Steve those are her shoes I swear she’s just getting changed and she promised she’d only be a second and I promised I’d be right here waiting for her I-“.
He's going to leave her like Papa did, and when Bruce finds out what she did then he'll go too, and then May and Ben, and she'll be alone.
He almost vomits.
As soon as his baby's body hit the floor, Tony Stark was jolted out of the nightmarish trance he'd been trapped in since Siberia. Her eyes were open, but only the whites visible, her limbs hitting the ground in sudden jerks. His medic brain told him that she was seizing, his dad brain told him that he had fucked up and his kid, his ten-year-old child, was paying the price.
He knows about the spider, that she led Peter away from the tour group, that she got them both into danger. He's angry because she trespassed, damaged property, lied and wasted everybody's time.
Steve and Tony feel as though they’re watching a movie. They sit and watch as their supposedly dead daughter leads a situation in a way they’ve never seen before, her tone of voice is new and her posture is new and the ambiguous underlying emotions are new. Everything is different, but only slightly. It’s as though every element of their world is the same, just moved a millimetre to the left. There’s no focal point, no proof that something is slightly off, just an undertone that doesn’t quite make sense.
He doesn’t get a chance though, because as soon as the first piece of metal makes contact with his body, he watches Persephone’s vitals take a nosedive.
"But she-", Tony's voice cracks and he takes a moment to pull himself together, "She's gonna be alright though, yeah?".
” Tony replies, eyes doubled in size. “I mean, you must be used to them and all, but in the Forties they were still… mysterious and precarious, every flight such a gamble. Human race has really gone far, hasn’t it?”
be happening if he wants the plan to work, it’s already hard as it is. He finishes his beer in one long sip, keeping telling himself that he
“Okay, I’ll go first then.” Tony sighs, defeated, taking a sip from his virgin Mary, “I’ve always liked engineering more than anything else because I felt I could control the outcome in the middle of life’s chaos, even as a kid. That’s why when things don’t make any sense – and in our line of work they often don’t – I go down to my lab and tinker.”
“—I was referring to mission details, isn’t it?” he anticipates him, returning a giggle, “Yeah, I gathered that by the way your eyes seemed to double in size within a second.”
“Nice to meet you.”
But after Mjojnir accidentally destroys a couple of walls (thankfully not foundation ones) to get to him one night when Thor is staying with Bruce – Steve was just stretching in bed, trying to ignore the sounds coming from the other room – he realizes that
last night after Tony mentioned his hotel, and if Captain America reacts like that to an innocent suggestion, you can bet your ass it’s as serious as a matter can get. And that’s why he knows his brain has already made a decision, although his heart is begging him to ignore it.
It wasn’t his intention to make a big deal out of his going away, but when it came down to actually plan it, he soon had to realize that there wasn’t any other efficient way to do it if he indeed didn’t want to be found. So now that this part is finally out of the way he can move up to the next step of his strategy: forcing himself to actually do it. Because yeah, goodbyes were hard and definitely not his strongest quality, but that’s a walk in the park compared to let go for real of everything else. Because what if his calculations were wrong, and somebody attacked Earth when he was away? Would Steve actually call him? Would Pepper? Or would they think they could handle it, no matter how complicated things got? Would Strange make that call for them? He trusts the magician would not think it twice if it came down to it, and that thought soothes him a bit.
. Tony feels like he’s suffocating. He can’t spot Steve anymore under all those white coats and that makes everything ten times worse. Then the heart rate machine grows silent, the voices louder and Tony’s ears start ringing as if someone was dragging their sharp fingernails across a smooth surface. He only manages to hear random words: “Cardiac arrest”, “ECG” and “paddles”, followed by ever increasing numbers shouted in the air. He covers his face to try and filter at least some of the noise out, but with little result; soon enough, his own body goes into safe mode and he just stays there, not able to think or move, for god knows how long.
Tony knows what he would do if this was a normal circumstance: take the person’s hands in his, smile gently to them, wait a few seconds for them to be comfortable and able to move away or stop him if they wanted to, and then, if they stay in their position, lean in and kiss them slowly and gently, no tongue involved – that’s for a later time.
. And, well, I don’t.”
it feels, and this what is now scaring him shitless, because his instinct is very rarely wrong.
“Yeah. He called to try and convince me to stop you. And I told him that he should let you do your thing.”
“So how was space?” asks Steve after a while, munching along. Tony should be surprised that he knows, but it doesn’t take much to figure out who the leak was.
“Buenos dias, senor. I thought today was gonna beat you, but I was mistaken,” the old man replies, making a hint of salute as passing him by, something that he started once he told him he’s an Army man.
, in fact, a date. No matter what Carol thinks she knows. It just can’t be happening. Nope
“I need to take a break, Pep. From everything. Iron Man, the company, us… I’ve realized the past… ten years of my life have been an absurd rollercoaster of events and I’ve dragged you down with me more times than I would have liked to because you were always there by my side to help me out in a way or another… And I kept telling myself than once the latest emergency was over,  I would take a step back to understand what was my endgame, but then of course things kept happening over and over and I just couldn’t stop, so I went along with it. But now… now it seems the time has finally come, and I need to do this if I’m ever gonna be…
, he wants to shout, as although what he’s doing is a purely symbolic gesture, it still carries along implications and responsibilities that he
“Do you want to… uh, walk back home?” Steve asks once they’re alone, and by the tone of his voice, he’s glad to notice his prayer didn’t go unanswered.
loudly against this, but right now he knows it’s for the best. He can’t take risks, not with everything that his body has gone through recently. ‘
. And that’s because people tend to be – consciously or not – intimidated by his person, creating this
“S-Steve Rogers,” he mumbles in response, stretching his hand forward a fraction of a second later to be polite; Thor looks at it for a few moments, as if unsure what to do with it, but eventually holds it, so tightly that Steve is about to groan. Luckily for his dignity, the other lets it go just in time.
“I know, I know. I’m a bit… changed. Hope it’s not a deal-breaker.”
. I’m glad it’s gone, it took every bit of self-control to not say anything about it.” Tony confesses, raising his eyebrows before taking another sip of tea. He makes a face: “Please, tell me you didn’t actually make it yourself.”
It’s only a few minutes later than Tony lets a deep sigh go, once he’s sure he’s completely alone again.
“First lesson: never,
“Who’s Peter Quill?” interrupts Steve, an even bigger frown on his face now, getting lost as realizing just how much he doesn’t know and feeling like he
what he ended up doing, isn’t it? Him with his stubbornness. Destroying every good thing that ever happened to him. He shivers, for a second returning to the present and his surroundings. What is he doing? This is stupid, doesn’t make any sense. It’s not going to

“It’s actually the other way around,
So he tells him, and after he hangs up, he puts down on paper some questions he needs to ask people once he gets back to the US, before heading to the bathroom to take a shower. But as the warm water pours down his face and body, new fears start crawling up to him, making him shiver so much that he has to cut his ritual short. What if something happens to Steve while he’s on this mission? Would he even hear about it right away, or would Fury keep it from him until a ‘more suitable time’? And what about if he gets hurt and taken to a foreign hospital? Would he be allowed to go inside his room, sit by his bed, hold his hand and whisper into his ear that everything will be alright? He could probably get away with it in his own country, given his official position in the government and everything, but what about in a foreign nation that is not Wakanda? He doesn’t think they would give a damn about the US Secretary of Defense if that meant going against protocol, or the patient’s privacy. He has never thought about it in those terms before this very moment, and he wishes he wasn’t doing it now either, but for some reason these considerations keep popping up into his mind like bullets straight off a machine gun, and no matter how
deal with. He figures they can just ignore each other during the meeting, and then he’ll talk to T’Challa to remind him how it’s really not
doing
it. They seem to belong more to a scientific conundrum than to a battlefield. Which incidentally means, he feels like a fish out of water right now. The newcomers all shake hands with Fury before taking each a seat around the table, and it appears is only in this moment that they become aware of Steve’s presence.
the task is going to be. This is Steve Rogers, one of the thickest persons he’s ever known, which is only made worse by the fact that from time to time he still seems to somehow forget he’s living in the twenty-first century now, despite having been in this era for quite some time.
And then there’s
“You know what I mean…”
There it is, the chuckle again; Tony has to distract himself to keep from jumping on Steve, so he figures the time has come to actually take a sip of the tea; it’s overly sweet and watery and he doesn’t like it one bit. Which is perfect, in a way.
if Pepper hadn’t sent him a present, which of course he got notified about just because the courier couldn’t leave it outside his Manhattan apartment (he hasn’t set foot in it ever since he got summoned in Washington) – and on New Year’s Eve he actually falls asleep on the sofa at 6:30pm after a long day tied up to a polygraph machine in a remote military base somewhere in Virginia. He’s so exhausted all the time that he only realizes a new year has indeed started when he puts the wrong date on an official document, writing 2020 instead of 2021, and although he chuckles it off with the aid, he knows he can’t possibly go on like this – which in itself is quite indicative of his wellbeing, as normally those kinds of thoughts are as foreign to his mind as possible.
” comes the reply, quick and sharp, that seems to surprise the guy himself, his glance moving to a not better specified point behind Tony’s body.
“Why you keep calling it ‘Giant’, by the way?” Steve asks out of nowhere when the movie credits start rolling on screen. The question catches Tony off guard, and he takes a few seconds to realize what it refers to.
” Steve’s voice again, less edgy and more controlled now, which soothes Tony, even if just a little, and prompts him to try his best to come to a sitting position, fighting against his own body, whose energy seems to be running out. It’s a very weird feeling that he actively despises.
“Was about to wake you up, but it seems you beat me to it. We’re here.” Steve explains before pulling away from him. And again Tony has to fight the impulse of keeping the other close. What the hell is up with him? Why can’t he keep himself in check all of a sudden?
the Tower, nor the Mansion, or any of the places the Avengers have been staying before.
“How do y—“
Steve stares at him silent for a couple of seconds, and the look in his eyes tells Tony that he probably
He’s pretty sure he was, which of course, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything: sometimes people can’t wait for a payment to come in and they keep going back and forth until they receive their money – internet banking hasn’t really picked up around here yet, so most of their customers over forty still make their weekly or monthly trip to the bank to check their balances, collect their wages and such. Tony nods to himself and goes back to his position, telling himself to stop getting lost into his thoughts to avoid having déjà-vu in the middle of a shift.
“Nah, I was just…” he begins, but then stops and shakes his head, realizing he doesn’t know how to put those sentiments into spoken words. “Never mind, it was just a random thought. Please, go ahead, it was fascinating.”
And how the fuck is he meant to explain this? ‘Hi babe, did you have a nice walk? Funny story, I know that we watched our daughter die over and over again but actually she just turned up on the doorstep’.
He knows about the spider, that she led Peter away from the tour group, that she got them both into danger. He's angry because she trespassed, damaged property, lied and wasted everybody's time.
Steve’s hand finds Tony’s.
But she wasn't.
"Daddy?".
hi, i’m sorry it’s been so long! school is crazy. i’ll try my best to update soon :)
As rage takes over, Tony calls a suit, one hundred percent prepared to blast his way into Oscorp and find anybody who could be responsible in any way. He wants to make them pay.
"Okay, come on trouble", he snaked a hand under her legs and another around her back, scooping her from the hard floor in one fluid movement, distantly registering that she should definitely weigh more as she rested comfortably against his chest, not dis-similarly to when she was a toddler and couldn't find the energy to climb up the stairs to her bed.
Mila crosses her arms over her body, lifting her t-shirt up and over her head.
The man glances at the phone before his resolve crumbles and he takes it from Pepper. He opens his mouth to greet the woman on the other end, but a sob breaks through before he has the chance, "Tony,
There’s a pause, then a surprised burst of laughter erupts from her chest, “Let them in, Friday”. Though considerably more relaxed, her eyes don’t leave the elevator doors for a second. Steve can’t help but mentally compare her calculating stare to the one he’s seen on Tony on countless occasions as he assesses whether or not to call a suit.
"Good job Seph, I think we should get that tube out of your throat, is that okay?".
Steve.
“Let’s go get some food, Moo”, Steve suggests, placing a guiding hand on her back and making wary eye-contact with his partner.
"You'll be fine, Percie, go to school".
The situation seems.. oxymoronic. It’s unfairly fair. Mila’s back, the kid he met, fell in love with and grew to love as his own, the only person he loves more than Tony. But it feels incomplete, because they need answers before they can even begin to relax, answers which Mila seems reluctant to give. And he can’t very well demand them from her, as much as a part of him would like to shake her and see the words spill out, he can tell that she’s processing and she’s fragile and nothing’s going to settle anytime soon. It’s bittersweet.
"Morning Seph, make sure you eat breakfast before school".
She's ready for him to start yelling, to tell her that he regrets not going with Papa, that he never should've adopted her in the first place.
And he worshipped her right back (up until Siberia when he didn't have the energy anymore).
Like, more so than Steve could ever remember her being.
Percie knew she should be upset, for one, her spider knowledge had failed her, and then there was the fact that her and her best friend had definitely just both been poisoned by an Oscorp spider. Oscorp were definitely unethical, she didn't need her dad to tell her that, which probably meant that her life was in danger and that they definitely wouldn't care and that was something she should have been worried about.
"It's not.. something we see often", Bruce admits, somewhat tentatively.
Making eye-contact is the hardest part.
She’s right here, in his arms, breathing and moving and alive.
She wouldn’t leave him.
Tony sighs heavily, rocking back a little, still clinging to his child, "I uh.. I think I found the cause of all of this".
Sure, he’s probably discovered the cause of the mystery illness, but it’s suddenly ten times scarier. Not only does this leave a million terrifying questions, but after watching one child (a child he quite likes) get bitten by a biochemically engineered spider, he’s pretty certain he’s about to see his kid get attacked too.
Tony’s heart sank like a rock to the pit of his stomach.
Mourning and pity swims in Steve’s baby blues, seemingly boring right into Tony’s soul, he lifts his hands to rub his boyfriend’s upper arms, “Tony”. The sorrow in Steve’s voice makes the mechanic feel physically sick. “Tony she’s- Mila’s gone, baby, I know it hurts, trust me I know and I miss her so much but-“.
Such apprehension coats Tony’s lips that when the name spills out he almost attempts to swallow it again.
Being able to inhale and exhale herself is all she needed to relax a little.
Though still uncomfortable, she's no longer trying to escape, confident that Uncle Bruce will handle the situation. She blinks.
And then the chaos stops, the lights dim, there's no more beeping, the air is no longer being pushed in and out of her lungs.
First of all, it's way too bright, to the point that she has to close her eyes again for a moment. Paired with the burning sensation overwhelming her body, she genuinely considers for a moment that she could be on the sun.
The stagnant weather had previously elicited the sardonic observation that the gods were punishing the world with a vehement fury, pelting them with liquid bullets as retribution for the theft of a life, for seven lives. It’s probable that this was just a reflection of the mechanic’s own numb rage, partly due to the fact that he doesn’t believe in any God which he hasn’t regarded and touched whilst sober. Thor just so happens to be the only being to fall into this category.
Tony panicked, cupping her cheeks in his hands and hating how hot they felt. The heat was somewhat reminiscent of the extremis, a thought which made his stomach turn. Surely it wasn't normal for his child to have a temperature this high? His desperate pleas began as a low whisper, building with his panic to an uncontrollable sob, "Come on Seph, wake up baby, please honey, open those eyes, don't you dare check out on me,
Two kids could die, all because of an Oscorp field trip. He could lose his kid because Norman Osborne is unable to refrain from messing with things that shouldn’t be messed with, creating things that really didn’t need to be created, that the world would have been a hell of a lot safer without.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bruce rubs a hand on her back, when Percie looks up at him he looks a little like he could cry at any moment. She leans into him for comfort, appreciating the way he wraps an arm around her but unsettled by his rapid heartbeat.
Bruce looks like he's going to cry himself, biting his bottom lip and placing his hand on Tony's shoulder. The mechanic tries his best to remember that his friend has been a fairly prominent figure in Persephone's life, he could go so far as to say that at points, Bruce has helped to raise her. But he's so consumed with regret and grief that he can't even manage a nod when the man mumbles a soft and genuine, "I'm sorry, Tony".
Peter breaks the silence, “We can’t tell anybody. We aren’t supposed to be in here, we’ll get into trouble”.
The innovator whips his head around just in time to see his boyfriend exit the elevator, Dotty in tow. They’re both drenched, dirty rain water dripping onto the floorboards; a shiver shoots down Tony’s spine as he is suddenly thrown back to the lobby and the eerie tension which coats the tower.
"Hi Percie, can you blink twice if you can hear me?".
And then the doors open, and suddenly there are six more missing children in the penthouse.
"They were bitten by some genetically fucked tarantula at Oscorp, it's too weird of a coincidence to not be what's causing this".
In all the years that he’s been alive, Mila is the one important figure that he’s never had to worry will leave him.
