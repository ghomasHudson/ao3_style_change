Bruce thinks back to the quarantine, and how Steve spent most of the time anxiously checking his Stark pad. And his grin when it would chime indicating he got a letter. And how he would draw Tony constantly, making a show of having Bruce see every drawing he did of something that was
His hands move up to press over his eyes and then back through his hair. What’s wrong with him? Saying the right thing used to just come to him. He casts around helplessly and looks out the window. “The A is gone. Off the tower…”
For dessert the night after the story breaks, Scott brings out a cake with the best kiss photo printed on it in icing. The team has a good laugh at his practical joke (plus, cake!).
Rocket has accompanied Thor as usual, and is poking around in some random drawers in the background.
“Okay” says Steve, and Tony let’s out a relieved breath. Steve believes him. They’re okay.
It’s a lock when he wakes in the morning from a hyper-realistic dream where he and Pepper and Steve had an adorable baby, named after Pepper’s eccentric uncle Morgan.
“Tones! Hey, give me a sec to get somewhere secure.”
“Earlier I think I was just realizing what a big change this all would be. Things are so different now, and I knew people wouldn't be against us, against me liking men too... I just had some old fears hanging around in my head. But telling everyone, it's been so good. I'm ready. I really – god Tony, I don’t even have the words to tell you, there aren’t any that seem like they are enough. Even “I love you” seems too small.”
liked when you slapped me in the face with your cock.”
Tony usually only calls him pet names when Steve is anxious. It’s reassuring to know that Tony can read him so well, but he doesn't want to let Tony down.
Steve’s mouth quirks like he’s trying not to smile, but he remains stoic as he lifts Tony’s thin gown up past his chest, exposing Tony from the clavicle down. The room is cold, like a real doctor’s office, and Tony shivers. Steve’s hands come down to press firmly against one peck and then the other. It's almost like a massage. Steve’s large warm hands feel amazing against the cool air. His fingers graze Tony’s nipples, but in an unfocused way that Tony can tell is supposed to seem unintentional.
Steve practically muffles a sob in response.
. And yes, I
“Uhh, yeah we’ve been watching Scooby-Doo a lot” says Tony.
Flashes of every sex act imaginable flit in and out of his brain as he starts to feel the beginnings of that final rush of heat. But that’s not what would happen yet. No, they’re taking things slow. Who would have thought that would be so fucking hot? Imaginary Steve continues to stroke him, slowly rubbing his thigh and the side of his torso with his other hand, still pressed so close. He’s pressing as close as possible now, crowding Tony toward the glass. He slides his free hand down from Tony’s side over his ass, squeezing slightly.
already know about us?”
Steve’s heart rate skyrockets, beating faster than it did when the not-Godzilla had Sam trapped in its mouth.
Steve pauses for a moment then smiles. “I always prefer the old school methods. Tried and true.”
“Mmm, I don’t mind, I want to feel you.” says Tony.
Oh. Okay, Tony can see that Steve isn’t here to play around. He’s… god he looks like he’s gone about 100 rounds in B.A.R.F.
, with this guy? You could do better…”
Steve does exactly that, his gloved fingers gently part Tony’s cheeks and brush over his hole. “Do you have any discomfort in the area?” he asks, sounding so professional and unaffected that Tony wants to cry. He shifts up on his elbows on the table, backing up slightly to allow his erection to hang freely.
Steve lets out a small noise and focuses on staying completely still. One of Tony’s hands moves to cup the back of his head, while he moves to wrap the other gauntlet around his own length. Steve wishes briefly he could let go of the hammer and be the one to take Tony in hand, but is quickly distracted when Tony gives himself a gentle pump, stopping before his hand makes contact with Steve’s lips.
Tony eyes Steve’s pulsing errection. “Can it wait… two minutes?”
“I know! I know, maybe I’m crazy. And this is in
It’s like he’s lit a fuse and Tony is off, telling him everything he wants, the words tumbling from his mouth like a waterfall.
“Yes, Tony?” Steve reaches out and slings an arm around Tony’s torso. He’s already drifting off but he wants to hear what Tony has to say.
Steve settles into the rolling chair again and rolls up to the edge of the table between Tony’s legs. He presses on his knees again, more firmly this time. “Please keep your legs apart Mr. Stark.”
"I don't care what it cost!" yells Thor. "He took
of his body? Because I feel like that’s like, a PPE issue, or a bodily materials hazard we all need to be aware of…”
“How about you stop throwing my shit around, and I show you after I’m done with Thor’s arm?”
He’d made a point to wear the sunglasses all day, sneaking looks at Steve as they walked and ate. It was almost as good as having the helmet on, or his armor. But when it came time to take pictures with the newlyweds in the park, Steve came up to him and broke into the unspoken one-foot personal bubble he’d kept between them (except for the motorcycle ride), neatly taking them off his face.
Tony pants, leaning against the sink, eyes closed.
Both gauntlets are on him now, framing his face and cradling his head as he slides his tongue down to the base of Tony’s erection and breaths deep, catching his breath. He moves lower and gently takes one testicle into his mouth, then the other. Tony seems content to let him slowly explore; occasionally he pauses to rest his head against the cool metal of Tony’s armored thigh.
I don't think all those details really fit here in this fic, but I'll probably explore all that in a different story... Probably with a side of medical-kink haha.
Dubious science and smut (pretty much the summary for this whole fic...)
Tony makes a strangled noise and removes his arm to look at Steve, who has his pants open and is stalking around the bed toward Tony like some kind of jungle cat. He makes a pit stop at the bedside table to grab some tissues.
“Ro-ni.” She points the tip of her nose at Tony.
Steve moves up the table to stand up by Tony’s head so he can look him in the eye. “It’s true that the,” Steve pauses for about half a second, “the apparatus, is quite large. We will need to take our time inserting it to ensure we don’t hurt you.” He touches Tony’s shoulder “Don’t worry, I’ve done this hundreds of times, and no one has ever gotten hurt.”
The thing Tony is most proud of however, is the exam table. It’s an actual doctor’s exam table, top of the line. Atop it is a crinkly paper cover, and a hospital gown.
“Ant Person! Welcome back, how’s things?” Tony rattles off as he leans over the bar to shake Scott’s hand.
“I don’t know Tony, I look at what we have, what we’ve built. And any reality like the ones you've described are pretty hard to imagine.”
“Ruh! Ruoni. Rowni” she barks. Looking pointedly at Tony.
She clears her throat. “So, they changed their menu and they have a crab-avocado burrito I think you’ll like…”
Steve uses the comms to tell everyone at once, “This is no good, they just keep coming. We need to figure out how to actually stop them. Look around for anything that seems different or out of place.”
Steve is half-way down Tony’s throat and about to come when Friday insists that Bruce’s call is urgent.
at least for a little while?”
As comforting as anything can feel when someone is poking at what is your hand, but what actually looks more like a piece of pepperoni pizza.
So when they come to a stop Tony lets go right away; he does the right thing. There’s no lingering embrace or dip of his fingers under Steve’s t-shirt as he slides away.
Tony runs his hands through his hair, sits back onto his heels and takes a few deep breaths. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry I freaked out there… I just, I thought you were hurt, and I couldn’t deal with it for a second.” He huffs a laugh and keeps talking “Fuck, I guess I really have lost it, huh? I can’t even keep it together when Captain America gets a little sand burn.”
Steve smiles a little at the ‘you and me’ part. Christ, Tony really wanted more time before they did this…
Yeah no, Tony doesn’t need to hear this.
. My planet, gone. My people, gone. Heimdall, gone. Loki, gone... just when he'd proved himself a true brother."
sound even
“I’ll have you know my bloodwork shows I’m in perfect health. Better than perfect!”
Steve turns to kiss Tony again, how many can he get in before he has to leave, he wonders? “Better.”
and it makes Tony’s teeth ache. He wants to tease Steve about those cheesy educational videos he’s made for the US Departments of Education and Health, but doesn’t want to break the mood.
“JARVIS, where is Tony?”
... Or is it? See end note about this expanding into a series.
But then it passes.
“Stay just like that, you’re doing so well Steve.”
Tony and Steve find a new rhythm together and with the team. Now that everyone knows, Steve takes particular pleasure in putting an arm around Tony’s shoulders when they’re hanging out. Or pecking him on the cheek when he does something thoughtful.
Pepper holds up her hand to silence Tony’s stuttering. Tony hears the shower turn on. Shit, he can’t let Steve wait too long or he’ll come back out here. He turns 180 degrees so that the view-screen is no longer facing the living room and bathroom, at least. Now the view Pepper has is just his super classy bookshelves and widescreen TV. Maybe she’ll think it’s so well-appointed she’ll be distracted from the fact that she just saw Captain America’s ass.
even after you blow me…”
Steve burns at the thought of Tony inserting various toys inside himself, pretending they're him. Thinking of Steve while he pleasures himself, while Steve has been doing the same, thinking of Tony.
Steve puts his foot down, causing his legs to make a “V,” with Tony kneeling between them at his feet.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve’s head lolls against Tony’s, temple to temple. He’s already close, fuck, where’s that cup?
He showers and checks his beard. Moisturizes. Puts on some deodorant, all while raging to the open air and Friday about all the things he’s mad about. Not just things Steve has said or done, the whole lot of it. The entire clusterfuck of the last four months. Hell, the last four years.
Tony methodically scrubs at Steve’s scalp with the mint and aloe shampoo. The shampoo and all the soaps in the shower are edible (even tasty!) and 100% biodegradable. Nothing is worse than having a great shower and getting the acrid tang of soap in your mouth, or the sting of chemicals in your eyes.
“Well for bath stuff like that it’s usually at random,” Tony replies. “Honestly there isn’t a ton of difference when it comes to loofas and soaps. The best thing about this shower, is that it can change to accommodate the activities and preferences of the user. There’s a setting that creates a bathtub, one for nice soft floormats to appear wherever you want, platforms, seats, handrails… we could watch TV if we wanted.”
“Very good Steve, I’m going to take such good care of you.”
Everything has become so… he knows he should have found some way to tell Tony sooner. He knows he should have found some way to be better.
Tony’s heart lurches a little bit, and he pulls Steve into a hug. Just holding him gently in the soothing warmth. He wants to wrap Steve up and protect him from the world. He wants to make Steve forget there’s anything remotely close to “bad stuff.”
Tony is about to go off down memory lane to some of his less-than-sensitive moments around Rhodey (Stripper plane? Most of his 20s?) but sobers remembering why he called.
Scott jumps up to leave, he knows an opportunity to escape reprimand when he sees one.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony speaks first “Okay, so, this is it. The big bad, bigger than anything we've seen before. How do we stop him? What’s our timeline?”
Maybe 15%, tops.
Tony flies to Malibu the next week and 'does lunch' with Pepper. It’s incredibly awkward.
But if he’d known. If he’d known that he had even a one-in-one-billion chance with Steve he would never have done any of it. He knows he can be better.
Friday declares his destination as the doors close.
Shit. All of it is from Sam. So it’s probably not anything connected to the team's well-being, otherwise Natasha or Clint would have contacted him.
Steve notices of course, but doesn’t press. Tony will come out with it in his own time.
Scott gets back to his room and flops onto his bed face-first. Jesus.
He’s not going to push, but he’s not going hide either. He’s not going to call Becky out, or let slip that he did a fist-pump when he read that she possibly-probably ended things with Steve.
The idea of Tony sucking him, coming into his hyperactive mouth, blocking that constant prattle with his cock… is amazing…
“I – um, yes, please let’s do all of that.”
“Well done, Mr. Stark” he says, smiling a full blinding smile.
He doesn’t want to pass this up, but he also can’t let Cassie down.
The sick shame of getting off to someone he knows hates him. Must hate him after all that’s happened.
Their son is born a year later.
There’s dead silence as Steve
By the time Steve puts his head in Tony’s lap, Tony knows he can’t keep things platonic.
Tony is shaking above him as he pulls out and leans heavily onto Steve’s kneeling form. They stay like that for several minutes, just slowly breathing, Tony draped against Steve, letting his superior strength support him.
Tony leans into his touch, and Steve almost expects him to purr. And he thinks again about that old grey cat, and wonders if it was the right thing to say.
Steve expels a blast of air through his nose and composes himself. “Tony… these communicators were supposed to be for official Avengers comms…”
Tony responds, “Now… there are three more days until the penthouse needs to be packed up and cleared out. And then, we part ways for a little while and move forward, together.”
Finally, after being sequestered for five days straight, Tony emerges triumphant. He looks like absolute hell, but the team gathers around as a distinct dog-shape pads around from behind him.
Steve buries his face in his hands.
He squeezes Tony’s ass.
Thor steps forward.
Tony watches as Steve strips down, quickly and without fanfare. Hmm, maybe they can work on that later. Though there is something to be said about efficiency. They probably have a lot to work on… Steve is eager as they come, but he's also literally begging to be told what to do.
The shower wall with the handles is absolutely covered with Steve’s ejaculate. The auto-rainfall cycle starts, rinsing the wall clean. Tony absently wonders if he should disable that feature. He turns back to Steve on the bench.
He braces one arm across both of Tony’s legs to keep him exposed, tilting his ass up again with a gentle pressure. Rather than move to get the lube Tony knows is located somewhere around his head, Steve scoots up and presses the head of his cock against Tony’s entrance.
Steve deserves a Becky.
Steve moves down to slowly bite one of Tony’s nipples, his ass ghosts against Tony’s leaking cock.
Sam>> I’ll let the team know, see you soon.
“I need words, Captain.” Tony’s voice is teasing, but there’s an undercurrent of gravity.
Bruce glances at Steve uncertainty. Tony waves an impatient hand, "It's fine, I want Steve here too.”
A similar set-up to the shower setting Steve initially saw all those weeks ago emerges, with a single shelving unit coming out adjacent to a six-inch-high platform against the shower’s main wall. This platform is about a meter wide but only about a foot deep. Two sets of hand-rails emerge from the wall above it.
Steve looks at the screens in awe. “Tony… I can’t believe… well, no I can, because you’re you, but... just... thank you.”
“I know… just, can’t it wait? I know what you’re going to say and I…”
She’s never heard Tony sound so sure, except maybe when he’s talking about Iron Man. Her eyes well up and she nods. It hurts like hell, but she takes a moment, nods, and looks down at the menu.
He doesn’t really want to spend the evening with Thor and Rocket any more than Steve does, but Steve has the most adorable blush going, and Tony knows the entire dinner is going to be full of awkward!Steve, which is his second-favorite Steve.
Tony gives him a quick kiss and moves so Steve is out of the frame of the call. “Pop in if you want Sugar-britches, I’ve got this.”
He’s nervous. Jesus he hasn’t been nervous to have sex since… well maybe the last time he did this? It really has been 20 years. He said it to shock Steve, but now he wonders if he told him so he’d know what a big deal it is.
The plane ride back will be fine. It will be good to try to sleep again.
Tony rubs his temples and then drags his hands down his face, letting out a strangled groan.
Tony eyes him with a predatory look and says “I promise you will, Steve."
improve the formula to adapt to the elements and provided a few-“ Tony goes on about Spiderman’s web-shooters for a few minutes until Natasha straight up just gets up to leave.
Next up, things get explicit with you guessed it, more shower sex! (See Whatever It Takes the first story in this series to understand Tony's high-tech shower).
Steve smiles and closes his eyes. “Okay, five minutes.”
He wants Steve to see him.
“Pfft, Steve you do know I have like 50 cars, right? And I have people for that.”
Steve nods and picks up the lube before rounding the exam table to stand on the other side where Tony can have a clear view of him.
. Fuuuck.
He hasn’t winked at anyone… maybe since before Iron Man, what’s gotten into him?
Steve looks totally blissed out.
“Tony, I don’t want you to feel like –”
“Steve, Steve” is all he can manage as he’s taken almost all the way out of Steve’s body and then right back in, again and again.
His shower has everything you could want, and a few things most people wouldn’t even dream of… yes he definitely needs to get Steve in the shower.
When it’s over, Nebula stretches in wonder. “There’s… no pain.”
of sites online that dissect all the slightest body language from paparazzi shots and stuff! Anyway the other week someone was sending around this shot of the two of you getting ice cream at this place in Brooklyn? And I
Steve is conflicted. It doesn’t feel healthy to just abandon his routine and come running just because the others are out. They need to figure out how to do this without it feeling like, like some kind of affair.
The car pulls up and Steve gets the bags as Tony pays the driver. The house is insane. Steve can’t think about what a place like this must cost. It took him a while to get used to the tower, and he isn’t really even comfortable with that yet. Tony probably has places like this all over the world… it makes Steve feel like there is an even bigger gulf between them, thinking about his childhood and then later the tiny apartment he could barely afford. Even if Becky was out of the picture, and even if Tony’s flirting has been due to romantic feelings… how could a relationship between them even work? Could Tony even see anything past Pepper right now, if ever?
Strange jolts out of it. “I’ve looked forward in time, to review alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.”
“And Rocket! Don’t forget my small woodland friend, he wouldn’t miss this opportunity to experience sushi!”
Tony’s hand stills over Steve, who has begun to go soft at what he has overheard anyway.
Tony takes Steve’s hand from where its resting at his lower back and slides it down, down.
God Steve must be close. He knows it's probably just his inexperience. To offer up "anything" so easily like that. It makes Tony want to wrap him up and keep him away from anything that could ever ruin that perfect openess.
He stabs once, twice more and then moves one hand up between Steve’s legs to press hard on his perineum with two knuckles. Steve loses it, clenching down on him so hard he’s almost forced out. He fights to stay inserted as he dimly realizes that Steve is coming untouched, hands still glued to the handholds on the shower wall. Tony fights to stay pressed inside as much as he can as Steve rides through his orgasm.
“Steve, where are you?”
It’s just like any other day. The Avengers are called in to the city to stop the latest villain of the week. They seem to be popping up more and more.
didn’t want it. He feels like Tony is speaking a different language. Can't he see this is about how Steve let him down?
- Tony and Steve reunite after their month+ separation. At first they need to play it cool since the whole team is around.
Steve’s mind is overrun with the barrage of imagery.
Tony can’t take anymore, he drops his head down to the table and says “Okay, are we ready? I feel ready.”
Steve buries his head into Tony’s shoulder as soon as Scott is out of the room. “Oh my god, Tony. Is everyone going to find out about us by seeing us in some phase of having sex?”
Steve is no longer looking confused, more… thunderstruck.
“I got some messages from Sam. On my phone... which I basically ignored for two days” Steve rubs the back of his neck, embarrassed. He and Tony have accomplished a lot in the past two days, but they’ve also been going at it like bunnies. It feels a bit like he’s been skipping school.
“So,” says Steve, who are we telling next?”
“Steve.”
He dries off (“activate instant-dry”) and heads for the bedroom, anticipation coiled tight in his belly.
Tony considers recording their encounter for just a moment, before telling Friday “Total blackout keyed to my codes. If a world-ending Avengers-assemble threat occurs patch it through.”
Steve looks ahead and sees a long hall, also lit by the floor lighting. At the very end he can see the glow of real lights coming from an open doorway. He forces himself to walk.
. Christ, doesn’t that just…
Steve doesn’t understand. “How is this possible? Are you saying Tony has somehow been injected with the serum? Or injected with small amounts over time?”
“Okay, yep, I need to shower.” Tony announces.
He gets to press himself against Steve’s back and fucking
“Oh, um yeah Thor they do have sushi. But actually I was just going to dinner with Tony-“
Steve follows, but if he’s honest he isn’t totally feeling this whole process. So far sharing their news has been mentally and emotionally exhausting.
A noise escapes Tony in response, as he lets go of his harsh grip on Steve’s hair in favor of placing one hand on his broad shoulder for balance as the other combs gently through Steve’s hair along his crown.
Bruce takes a deep breath and appears to be gathering himself. Tony is pretty sure he’s doing his meditative breathing.
an interesting offer… maybe not my cars but, you could get all dolled up and spangle-y and wash the armor?”
Tony rubs his hands over his face, almost laughing because it’s so horrifying. “She did… she also saw your naked ass walk across the frame, because I was on the call with the whole room in the background when you came in."
“Tony, I'm not uncomfortable with you. I’m the opposite of uncomfortable. I just…” What can he say? There is no way to sum up all the aspects of the terrible conflict he’s feeling here. So he just says it: “I can't decide if you're the biggest mistake I could make, or the best thing I could ask for.”
Next up - Nat, Sam, Wanda and Vision.
Tony is actually starting to blush, because of course his perverted mind can’t get off the submission/blowjob thing, and of course his fire hose of a mouth does nothing to keep those thoughts from just spilling out.
Steve smiles up at him as he brings his hands to rest on Tony’s angular hipbones. His head is still leaning back against the stone, like he can’t be bothered to lift it. Hmm maybe they really are done for the night.
After sushi they get ice cream, and then they all take a paddle-boat ride in Central Park.
They return to Earth through Strange’s portal, where Wong updates them.
Steve’s eyes go wide and his blush returns in full force. “Oh.”
“Oh god” says Tony, leaning back to grip the sink and just hold on.
“Mmm-” is all Tony manages to respond as Steve moves down, placing gentle kisses along his nose, then his eye-brows and finally on his ‘thing’ under his mouth. Steve continues to kiss Tony, bracing himself over him on one arm, resting the other on Tony’s torso, playing with the edge of the collar of his undershirt.
Tony has Friday hack the kid’s phone and blur their faces just to mess with him.
had. That is, until the next night…
because I built it, but…”
Steve motions for Tony to come sit by him. The view-screen follows him, settling in front of them so they are both on-screen with Rhodes.
Steve holds in a groan and settles back down onto the mattress. Tony’s right. He nods and huffs a breath, settling down again into his pillow. His arm is still thrown around Tony, but his mind is too busy to do much else.
It’s almost enough.
“Tony?” Steve sounds worried now, and apparently wants a response. What can he say that will convince Steve that this is okay? He probably can’t. But he can at least convince him that he understands.
Tony’s head snaps up from where it was angled down at Steve’s perfect chest. So different from his own; not one scar.
Tony deflates like a balloon. “Huh, well, Pepper was shocked!” like that’s somehow proof that his huge crush on Steve wasn’t as obvious as Rhodey is making it sound.
Steve steps forward, poweraid forgotten “Who is us?” (Sam mumbles, “Uh yeah I’m here to, third Avenger, right here… don’t address me though portal-guy, that’s cool…”).
After they've eaten again, Tony says, “Come lay on the sofa with me, I want to talk some more, but it’s not like, logistics and planning. More just, general “us” stuff.”
“Alright everyone,” says Steve. “This training course is Tony’s brain-child, but that doesn’t mean he has the answers. Friday is manning the course, and it’s on us to work together to beat it.” A count-down clock appears as a hologram above their heads, it begins counting down from two minutes.
everything we have done tonight. I am 100% over the moon about it, everything that’s happened. I have most definitely wanted it all; in fact I’ve been the one “taking the reins” right? Just because I’m not hard doesn’t mean I’m not so satisfied, so incredibly
Bruce stiffens at the familiar twinge of rage pulsing at the edges of his consciousness. Tony comes up to him, already half-covered in his nano-armor.
LASS-E shakes her head and begins again.
Steve’s eyes go soft. “I’m fine, Wanda caught me. Comms are down.”
was thinking about all those stupid tabloid stories about his “orgies.” So yeah the shower has been the source of a lot of fun for him, but this is the first time he’s gotten someone in here with him in years, and it’s
Before he goes back to San Francisco maybe he will give them the heads up that if they are trying to keep their relationship off the radar, sitting basically on top of each other isn’t the best tactic.
He built an arc reactor in a cave in the middle of the desert. He flew a nuke into a hole in the universe. But Captain America is an impossibility, and he knows it.
for? What exactly do you have floating around in that head of yours? I mean I
Tony lets go of the base of Steve’s cock and grabs his hips firmly, redoubling his efforts on Steve’s hole. Saliva and the lube he deposited there with his fingers make the way smooth and easy.
A different kind of pleasure floods through Steve now, even the visual of Tony’s now damp leg doesn’t embarrass him the way it would have a few minutes ago. Because he’s perfect.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony is squirming now, trying to get more of Steve in him. Steve takes his hips and stills them.
He shifts and stands up, and waits for Steve to do the same.
Steve slowly pushes forward, advancing at a snail’s pace. By the time he’s seated fully inside Tony he knows he needs to do something to slow himself down, something more than mindless thrusting.
, ring pops!” says Quill. “I almost forgot those were a thing. Drax, when we finish with Thanos we should swing by Terra and get some Earth candy. I hope they still have pop rocks!”
Yep, he needs to get Steve up off the ground now before he gets an embarrassing erection which his incredibly thin and expensive lounge pants won’t do anything to hide.
“Anything Tony, anything…”
Tony comes back at him in retaliation with everything he has, his nanoparticles turning his entire lower half into a battering ram. “Hands off the merchandise, Frankenberry. He’s mine!”
Steve can’t focus the entire flight home.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s so stupid, he didn’t think it would feel like this. He feels… he feels safe.
“Four months to go, right?” he asks, like he doesn’t have a little count-down clock in his head. He is going to have to talk to Pepper about planning the surprise party soon. It’s sad to say but Tony has absolutely no idea how any of the events he’s involved in (or supposedly is in charge of) get done. Pepper and her teams do it all. He should get her something… something showing appreciation but not romantic. Maybe a new vacation home.
“Wha- What?” Is all Tony says, before his face goes blank. Steve doesn’t know what else to say, and Tony just sits there, and doesn’t say anything for a solid minute. He thinks Tony’s brain may have actually broken, because he has never been quiet this long when he has something to say.
“Could I ask you something, Bruce?”
Tony sighs. “I didn’t plan this, okay? It’s not something I ever even thought was possible.”
Steve is starting to blush. God, Tony thinks, why is it so hot when he’s inarticulate? Steve is always clear and eloquent when he’s in Captain America mode. Delivering the rallying speech that gets the team in gear. And that’s it, Tony realizes. This fumbling, awkward person is Steve, not Captain America. And the most incoherent Tony ever sees Steve is during sex, so any hint of hesitation automatically brings Tony’s mind to blushing Steve… about-to-get-fucked-Steve.
“How are you doing?” Steve asks, and Tony wonders if he’s getting off on this as much as he is, because Steve’s tone is still one-hundred percent professional.
But he doesn’t want to argue, and he doesn’t want anyone to try to stop him.
Steve looks bemused. He tells the team to shower/go relax and they’ll meet back up later to debrief, then pulls Tony in for a quick kiss.
After the debrief, Steve and Tony are relaxing in the suite’s living room when Tony gets a text. It’s a screenshot of Peter’s text conversation with Ned.
Steve sighs and leans in to rub his forehead against the side of Tony's. He doesn’t love
Bruce blinks, his cheeks dusted pink and he clears his throat. “Well, that is, I meant a sperm sample.”
“Yeah, yeah Tony let’s go shower.”
He puts a hand on Tony’s armored shoulder. Needing to feel him there, to be sure they really made it through.
Tony clears his throat. “I’m clean, I can have Friday pull up my latest tests… and I think you are probably covered by the serum?”
Strange responds, “there are still almost 20 outcomes where we win, but they aren’t pretty. So, I need a clear picture in my mind of where to go, do any of you know where the witch or the shrinking man are right now?”
Bruce takes his glasses off and closes his eyes. “Well, I mean I saw you two were getting along really well… Wait, Steve likes men? Gah, sorry let’s focus on the issue, Tony’s health.”
Tony stills, breathing fast.
He grabs the lube and thinks to tell Steve “My lube is always in the gold tubes. Gold means go, easy to remember.” He knows Steve probably won’t be in the tower long enough to make use of that little tip, but he’s put the same shower with the same general layout and supplies in the master suite at the compound… if all goes well he’ll be able to start working through all thirty of the shower's settings with Steve in the not-too-distant future.
His body does it before he can consciously think to move his muscles.
Steve’s heart pumps harder at the words “exam room.” The instructions are simple enough; he doesn’t really want to talk to Friday right now.
He guides Steve to stand in front of the mini- platform facing the wall, and steps up onto it himself so he’s facing Steve. With the added six inches he’s slightly taller than Steve. Perfect.
Steve’s eyes are still shut in bliss but he raises an eyebrow at the last part, which is obviously another command for the shower.
he might need to-“
“She says it’s urgent, Boss.”
“If I knew you thought I was… look, really, I know you don’t think of me that way and that it’s never going to happen. I’ve always known where we stand, this wasn’t about that… please don’t feel weird about this, shit.”
Things are calm for a single day. The day after Bruce gets back, they all get the call from Steve via their nano earpieces.
… And he knows that that’s not enough. He knows that Steve doesn’t deserve to be shackled with his neurotic billionaire baggage. Steve didn't deserve to see the mess he was in Japan, and sure as hell doesn't deserve the media cirus that follow's everything Tony touches.
Tony feels the hot liquid spill inside him and almost forgets to touch himself, just enjoying the feeling of Steve letting go, picturing what his face looks like when he comes. He slides a hand down to grasp his cock. It’s rough and a little dry, but he’s leaked enough that he can thrust into his own hand easily enough and he’s coming in seconds. Tony comes all over the side of the exam table and goes boneless, thankful for the table itself and Steve who is still holding his hips.
Tony retracts the helmet and covers Steve’s hand with his own, giving Steve a determined look.
Tony keeps his hands resting lightly on the sides of Steve’s face and neck. “Go ahead and take me out, but don’t pull my pants all the way down, you’re going to want them there in a minute.”
“Nah kid,” says Tony. “It’s just a reminder in case anyone panics or gets pinned down. Just say “I heart New York” and the whole program will pause. We just picked a phrase that nobody would actually say in battle. If we made it “I can do this all day” for example, the program would probably pause in the first two minutes thanks to everyone’s favorite Brooklyn boy.”
Tony hasn’t moved forward.
“You know, I’ve noticed your jokes get worse and worse the more worried you are.” Steve says.
Steve hesitates, he sees where this is going.
Tony squirms and makes impatient grabby hands for Steve to join him in the bed, which Steve does once he’s devested himself of the rest of his clothes. He drapes himself fully over Tony, but pulls back when he tries to kiss him, waiting for an answer.
“Oh you know, just arriving at the Avengers compound, shaking Iron Man’s hand, about to negotiate the terms of my status as a team member… really boring, normal stuff.” Scott knows his grin is a bit manic; he hopes his hand isn’t sweaty.
Strange does the eyeroll he seems so fond of.
The resolution is crisp, the sound clear. He watches Steve pause, and the look on his face causes Tony to snort a laugh. God, he almost looks confused. Does Steve even
Tony takes one more deep breath.
Bucky tested him constantly in their youth to see what, if anything, could wake him. On the list of things that didn’t work: tickling his feet, an ice pop on the neck, loud noises like yelling/banging/clapping, shaking, nose-honking, hair pulling, and ear-flicking. Even the smell of his favorite stew… nothing.
- Steve washes Tony's armor as promised ;)
“Whoa whoa, Sunshine, hold on.” Tony watches Steve turn from blissed-out, to full-on panic mode on a dime. He replays what Steve’s said and feels a creeping dread. He has to get ahold of this now.
“Tony. I understand how much you are going through right now. Or, if I don’t understand I’m trying to. I don’t think you’ve lost it. I think you are holding on in a really terrible situation, and I want to be here for you… Tony, it’s okay that you were worried about me. How do you think I felt when I heard you’d gotten into a car accident overseas? I was… god can we please talk about this?” Steve takes a deep breath, and forges ahead.
“I’m- I’m good, you know, a little nervous.” Tony grins, and he can’t believe they are doing this.
“Steve!” Tony says a final time before he’s spilling over his own hand and onto Steve’s chest.
Steve steps forward, one hand out. Enough thinking about what to say, he’ll just... tell the truth.
The shape and joints look realistic, but the face has slightly exaggerated features, with big eyes. To everyone’s surprise Natasha is the first to kneel down and pet her. The metal looks smooth, and seems to give very slightly under Natasha’s touch.
But well, while that is all true, Tony is also basically just dying to see his boyfriend again. Or, partner? Special fella? That’s the thing, he doesn’t even know what they’re calling themselves.
“So I’m crazy?” asks Steve, smiling and feeling lighter than he has all day.
“Tony.” Steve interrupts. He knows Tony will go on like this for a while. “Why don’t you move on to the point you’re trying to make?” He’s smiling indulgently, where once he may have been frowning at Tony’s lack of focus. Turns out that’s what happens when you’re in more-than-love.
His eyes land on Tony leaning against the bar; he looks at ease, he looks
?” Sam yells after them.
why he’s come?
“Who’s on Cap?” Tony demands into the comms as he blasts away from the grateful mother without a word. The buildings have blocked his view and he didn’t see where Steve landed.
Tony actually draws blood, while Widow, Steve, Black Panther and Wanda hold him in place, managing one limb each. They have him splayed out like he’s on a saint Andrew’s cross.
Steve rolls up his sleeve. “That’s fine Bruce, whatever you need.”
- More blended family fluff with Steve/Tony and the kids, possibly the birth of each.
Tony’s right, he’s still hard. Once the sparks clear from his vision he begins sliding in and out of him again. He’s a little sensitive, but the incredible amount of ejaculate he just released eases the way. He finds a smooth rhythm almost immediately.
After toweling off Tony turns the knob of the bathroom door, eager to get back into bed with the real Steve.
But he wonders if she has seen enough of this latest iteration of Steve. And even if Steve wasn’t so obviously taken with Tony, Bruce can’t help but feel that Tony deserves more credit than Natasha is willing to give.
Steve doesn’t want to try and lift it. He knows somehow in the dream he can’t. He doesn’t feel particularly worthy at the moment anyway, and knows trying will be pointless.
Steve scoops him up into a bone-crushing hug, lifting him off the ground and even spinning him around in one tight circle.
“Show me what you got, Cap.”
“I am okay to continue,” says Tony, “I think, maybe my prostate may be a little sensitive though?”
Tony and Vision take aim at the orb, held firm in the distance by Wanda’s red power. Vision sends an energy beam from his forehead while Tony fires one of his smallest, but fastest missiles.
He wants Tony to do it again. Harder. He wants to know how hard he can possibly hit him. He wishes he could drag this out, but there’s no way. If Tony hits him again like that, he's not going to last. And if he doesn’t get up against Tony’s leg soon he’s definitely going to drip on to the rug… that possibility fuels genuine panic within him, causing him to blurt:
Steve interrupts any further social planning, “Tony, they’ve almost breeched the forcefield, where are we at?”
“What happened to him?”
“Urnngg”
Steve is leaking enough now that Tony has lubrication to work with. He begins running both of his hands over Steve in random, erratic patterns, like he can’t even focus on a single technique to pull him off.
After Siberia Steve starts waking up every few hours. It’s odd, but he doesn’t think much of it, he has a lot on his mind after all. The days pass and he finds it harder and harder to fall back asleep and stay asleep. And he starts to remember his dreams. He can’t get the images out of his head. Cold. Pain. Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony glances down in an effort to understand Steve's sudden distress. Steve has now edged off of him, and is holding himself away from the matress, eyeing the mess they've made of the comforter like a harangued house cat.
It’s just not his business.
“Mr. Stark?” Steve prompts. That’s right, he asked a question.
Tony scoops Steve up and flies him back in the direction of the chaos. “Yeah well, you try making top-tier jokes when someone you more-than-love is in danger.”
“What does this mean Bruce? My biology is pretty rusty.” says Tony.
Steve knows how medical testing goes. It’s endless, and there’s rarely any answers at the end of it all.
Bruce marks something down on his Stark Pad, and asks “And how often do you have intercourse? Ideally you would estimate a total, and also, the umm, percentage of that total amount that Tony is the receiving party.”
“Jesus did you open yourself enough, you’re tight, shit…” Tony’s head thrashes as his hands slide around on the mattress, desperate to grab on to something.
Sometimes they aren’t about Siberia at all. It’s something from his past, or somewhere he’d never even seen before, but it always comes back to Tony. And not the Tony he remembers, or anything based in reality because oh god… Steve can barely think about it without flushing. These dreams about Tony are, for lack of a better term… explicit.
It’s not something he ever did a lot actually. Back in the day his sexual experiences with men were primarily made up of quick blowjobs in the backs of clubs, or the occasional hook ups that tended to be him topping because… well, it just seemed the thing to do. He’d only ever let a couple of guys fuck him, people he thought actually might stick around. Both times he regretted it almost instantly because it turned out twenty-something Tony kind of went for assholes.
that Nebula is blue, she’s also bald, which makes her head look exactly,
Also, her name is Becky.
So, three plans.
Tony steps forward, “Okay so first of all, her name is Wanda, and she’s probably not keen on being called a witch? But yeah she should be at the compound with Vision and Black Widow. Scott, aka Ant Man, aka the Shrinking Man, is probably at home sitting down to breakfast with his kid. I can easily pull up satellite images for both locations for you to get a visual.”
Tony nuzzles Steve’s neck as he smooths his hands in little circles on Steve's sides and hips. “Hmm? Oh, yeah, the original Jarvis… He was our family driver/butler/you name it. He pretty much raised me.”
Steve looks pleased, but not totally convinced. “So you just said it without thinking…”
Sam snorts, and Steve playfully elbows Tony in the ribs, even though he’s already in the armor and can’t feel it.
“Welcome again, you can pick from any of the empty rooms. The first official team meeting will appear in the calendar on your new phone.”
Incredibly, it works.
Gah if this chapter was a 10 on the sex-o-meter, the next few turn it up to 11... Stay tuned eeeeee...
“Well,” Tony says slowly, like he thinks Steve is missing something obvious. “He’s still a wanted man, right? He can’t hide in Wakanda forever. We need to figure out how to get him exonerated too, offer him a spot on the team if he wants it. I probably owe him a new arm too, now that I think about it…” Tony shrugs, eyeing the last dregs in the coffee pot wistfully.
If you want to get technical, he seduces Steve Rogers with his genius.
After they tell Scott, Tony and Steve are still on the sofa in the living area. Tony sits up and smacks his hand up to his forehead. “Oh god, I need to call Rhodey!”
Tony’s mouth works for a couple of seconds without any sound coming out.
“Thanks for coming, Scott.”
This is now a series! Apparently if you subscribed to this story, that doesn't mean you'll be updated that it is now a series or when the series is updated.
wish he didn’t have post-orgasm fuzz-brain because he doesn’t mean it like
anyone to know. It’s just already so complicated…”
Finally he leans back away from Steve enough to peel the soiled pants off his legs and carefully ball them up before tossing them toward the area of the bar. He goes back to Steve who is still kneeling and wraps his arms around his neck, sliding down to align their bodies until he can capture his mouth.
Hot humiliation rolls over him until Tony’s soothing voice assures him he’s okay. It’s hot even, he said… And then Tony is pressing himself into his mouth again and explaining where he’s supposed to come instead, slotting them together and encouraging Steve to rub up against his leg
“I could clean your lovely hard dick next. Run the cloth over it, massage your balls with some sweet soap and lick them clean. Take you in hand, then into my mouth…”
Tony is blissed out, just leaning back against Steve with his eyes closed and his mouth agape in pleasure. Steve notices the shower doesn’t seem to be hitting them with water, more like the entire stall has filled with a warm, pleasant mist.
“You want me naked” Steve says.
Inside there is a note with some directions. There is a simple a single instruction at the top: “Get dressed.”
his hand it’s going to be Bruce.
Just as he’s almost out of the room, Tony says, “Oh Scott?”
“Hmm, yes Steve?” Tony asks as he rubs the cloth up gently to the back of Steve’s knee while kissing the knob in front.
Steve takes Tony’s hands off the bed and slowly kisses every inch of them, holding them captive. He starts rocking his pelvis experimentally back and forth. He isn’t getting much leverage on Tony’s cock, more just moving with him, clenching down on him as he rocks them into the mattress.
“For better or for worse” says Tony, eyes bright.
The end is here!
Luckily, his brain takes notes even when he’s distracted. He plays back everything Steve said, closing his eyes for a moment to focus on the words.
Tony quietly groans and buries his nose into Steve’s neck, breathing him in. “Please mom, five more minutes.”
Huh, Tony and Steve in bathing suits, putting sun block on each other’s shoulders… and other parts.
Becky.
“Uhhh, no I mean, that will probably cost a fortune you don’t need to-“
“Why don’t we start with you and see where we get? My life doesn’t appear to be in imminent danger, right? I mean, if anything I’ve stumbled on the fountain of youth. And fountain is right, you should really see-“
And if he always used to have his bags brought inside before Afghanistan and Obi, so what? It doesn’t hurt to do a little moderate lifting.
Steve gets distracted by the taught line of Tony’s jaw. He wants to bite it. Oh god. Shit, he knew his dreams had started bleeding into his waking thoughts, but… Jesus, he needs to focus. Was he always this attracted to Tony? Maybe.
That sounds about right.
Bruce feels useless until Tony tells him Friday is picking up some kind of micro-spore on the suit that came off of the plant. When the team returns, Bruce leads the decontamination procedure for them to re-enter the compound. He also takes several samples of the spore, and a sample of each team member’s blood for analysis (except Vision, who doesn’t have blood… Bruce really should set up a time to better understand what is going on there…).
to get Hulk to come out. Five years ago he would have given anything for the other guy to suddenly develop a case of stage fright.
Friday’s silence speaks volumes; he knows he has to say something else or he won’t even get past the ground floor. Panic wells up in him, his mind is blank. Even if Steve had some grand speech ready, now he can hardly speak, his throat closing up with a hundred emotions. So much pain and so much regret.
Steve isn’t sure how much longer they could have kept at it without more of the team stumbling upon them. Staying apart was too hard, and they’d started to get careless.
Finally, after Steve has eaten three sandwiches and finished off all of Tony’s orange juice (Tony eats one sandwich and a pot of coffee), they can’t put it off anymore.
Steve and Tony knew they couldn't keep their relationship out of the public eye forever.
Tony, Scott and Peter all start talking at once. Eventually Tony is able to yell above them to be heard by the group: “Hold on, team emergency! Who here has
Steve smiles a little at the idea of Tony as a genie, his fingers itch to pick up a pencil.
“Okay I’ll get clean and then meet you in the bedroom, Steve. I’ll be sure to stay nice and tight for you. Nobody has fucked me in about two decades, so I’d say you’ve got your work cut out for you.”
“Perfect, that’s right let it all go… you’re doing so well Steve, thank you, you’re mouth… so perfect… just for me, that’s right…”
“Like, boyfriends?” asks Peter.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The expander is holding you open and ready, but I also need to prep the medication.” Steve says as he unbuttons his khakis and unzips them. He isn’t wearing underwear. He keeps the pants on and takes his hard cock out letting it stand at attention while he opens the lube and pours some into his hand. He sets the tube down and moves slightly closer to Tony, about a foot away from his head and shoulders where they are leaning on the exam table.
“… My planet destroyed, my father dead. Had to kill my sister. My brother died, he’s back but he did die of course... Oh what a year.” Thor refuses to break eye contact with Steve, who is now a lovely shade of strawberry.
(See the end of the chapter for
As soon as the orb explodes, a giant hologram of the Chinese Celebration Ball emoji appears above them, exploding with digital confetti as the Star Wars throne room ceremony music theme from Return of the Jedi plays. The remaining orbs drop to the ground, inert.
Steve gets quiet for a while, some old worries swirling around his brain at the hard prospect of leaving Tony.
the wrong thing.
Steve sighs and moves around the side of the building toward the nondescript foot-traffic entrance that was used exclusively by the Avengers when they couldn’t take a vehicle in or out of the tower.
2. Scott hasn’t even really
When it's over he takes a moment to brace his arms on either side of Tony and find some equilibrium. Steve knows he’s made a huge mess of Tony, but he doesn’t want to just leave immediately to clean up. Tony solves that for him by pulling him down so their chests squelch together. He presses Steve further, encouraging him to rest more weight on top of him.
Rocket pauses and looks up at Tony, eyes narrowed. “Impossible, how do you work around the quantum toxicity?”
Scott summarizes the visitation situation with Cassie. He also tells Tony about the side-gig for his new security company.
Honestly, about 75% of him was glad, because fuck Becky. But the other 25% knows it’s because Steve is kind of messed up too, isn’t he? And he probably needs to work on a lot of things before he gets involved with anyone.
Tony looks at him like he’s crazy. “I’m coming with you! That’s standard practice for these kinds of things, right Bruce? The spouse can come with?”
. But can I ask you for something before we dive back into everything?”
Steve’s heartrate starts jack-hammering.
Tony drops the screaming girl into her mother’s arms and watches helplessly as Steve goes flying hundreds of feet in the air in the opposite direction.
As Scott sets the cake on the table, he says, “I call the lips!” Then he blushes. Then he says “Kidding! Haha, I mean, I actually like the corner pieces… just a stupid joke, uh, who wants cake?”
“I know that, Steve. Tony’s kept me updated on all the work you guys did with the Accords II. Speaking of, naming the super PAC after Steve… another not-so-subtle clue there, Tones…”
“I think Scott.” says Tony. Steve is surprised. Scott is the newest member of the team and knows Steve and Tony the least.
He takes off his tinted glasses and sets them down along with the fork. Pepper always hated talking to him when she couldn't see his eyes.
"Our?" questions Thanos.
Tony does not let out a whimper. It’s definitely not a whimper… but whatever it is he doesn’t dwell on because imaginary Steve’s hand moves from his hip to grasp him fully, hesitant but strong. His whole body weight would be braced on the glass, pressing back against Steve. He’s so close now, and Jesus all he’s thought about is Steve’s hand wrapping around his dick.
Tony groans around Steve’s errection and lifts off. He continues to stroke Steve as he tells Friday, “No video Fri, just put the call through.”
Steve, the reason I want you is to take all this longing and admiration and incredible passion I have for you, and reflect it back to you. To show you we’re in this together, that you’re not alone.”
Steve shakes his head, which is still down in his hands.
<<Four misses calls>>
“I don’t mean to send mixed messages…” Steve sighs, leaning down to brush a kiss of his own onto Tony’s forehead.
Pepper grins uncomfortably. “Okay, I’ll… I’ll leave it there. I know it’s a lot to ask, and a lot to think about. I would want you two to of course discuss it privately, and think about whatever level of involvement you would want post-birth… Just, think about it. I’m not banking on this, there are a ton of highly respected sperm banks in this city, and so if this is a “no” from you I totally understand, I’m okay. Totally.”
(See the end of the chapter for
His phone blinks to life at 10%. Steve looks over at Tony, who is still basically passed out. Steve shifts tenderly as he swipes in his code and settles gently on the edge of the bed so as not to disturb him. In their last round Steve got his first experience bottoming and his ass is still tender. It’s fading quickly, but he flushes at the intensity of it. Tony really didn’t hold back… shit, he’d better focus on the phone before he gets sidetracked, again.
His lightning fast reflexes press a hand up into Tony’s chest, half on the multitude of scars there, preventing Tony from getting any closer.
“Yeah, no, you have
Jesus, could Steve be any more confusing? He says they need to keep things non-sexual, and then puts his head on Tony’s crotch...
Steve laughs, wrapping his arms around Tony. "No, I'm really not."
“Beg,” Steve promptly responds, voice rough.
Finally Steve tells him, “It’s time to speed up now, once you feel the first dose coat you, you’ll be able to touch yourself if you want.”
know that saying ‘there wasn’t a good time’ or anything of that sort doesn’t hold water.”
“Your tongue, um, the rimming. Please.
Tony confirms, “Yeah it’s air-tight. It can go underwater, into space. The spores shouldn’t have had any way in.”
“Steve, Steve I think there’s been a misunderstanding. Can you tell me, can you tell me why you wanted to have sex with me?”
“I cannot wait for Gamora to try a Blow Pop!” says Quill. His voice fading into the distance as Tony and Dr. Strange prepare to depart through the portal he’s opened back to New York.
Plus, he doesn’t think of it as spying, more like a… Security Heist.
Tony finds this hilarious and laughs and laughs until he can finally from words again. “Come on, let’s go shower, I have cleaning bots and a service to take care of that.”
“Well, I actually just got it on good authority from Tony Stark himself that ‘It’s doesn’t matter two fucks what kind of doctor I am, I’m smart enough to switch when needed.’” Bruce rolls his eyes, but affectionately.
Once his breathing calms down he says “I think that’s the fasted I’ve ever come. Even like, counting my teenage years, when I was on a hair trigger. Fuck.”
Steve’s head spins a little. There’s a little twinge, but it’s not bad. More like the feeling when you stretch out a sore muscle. It’s good.
Jesus, that woman is terrifying.
“Anyone? Cap, Steve what’s your 20?” he’s flying full-speed in the direction he knows Steve was blasted.
He gulps. Do they know he saw them?
But he’s frozen.
The count-down gets to zero and the session begins. The “enemy” of the course emerges immediately as a group of 10-12 floating orbs. The floating balls range in size from about the size of a baseball up to a basketball, and they all shoot lasers at anything that moves with increasing accuracy.
Steve blows air out his nose in amusement, shifting slightly as he feels himself grow even harder at the thought of Tony being filled and loving it, even though there’s no orgasm in it for him… yeah that’s…
Steve and Tony deliver drinks and glasses while Vision and Wanda serve up the food. Once they are all at the table Tony gets a funny little flutter in his chest. Sitting down as a group and eating together wasn’t something that happened every day at the tower, but they did it enough to make this feel familiar, like coming home.
“Hmm,” says Tony, “well Option 2 is me finally getting my mouth on you so I can get a taste of your cock to compliment the taste I just got of your ass.” Tony is touching his cock again, just feather-light touches along his length. Steve has an absurd vision of Tony as a snake charmer, Steve’s penis slithering out of a basket, swaying to his siren song.
Tony’s been in a modified crunch during the exchange so he can see Steve, but he relaxes fully onto his back, letting his head fall to the mattress to get comfortable. He can’t see Steve anymore, and jolts in surprise when he feels Steve lift him up to meet his tongue.
boyfriend material. Okay, yes Steve is stubborn, but so is he. And maybe Steve doesn't really know what he’s doing when it comes to being in a relationship, but… god, is it wrong that Tony actually finds that appealing? Like, for once he isn’t the only one that’s clueless about how “normal” relationships work. That for once it wouldn’t be someone trying to pull him into their idea of what he should be… always pulling. Even with Pepper he felt like… but Steve is just this unending force of acceptance. It’s addictive. He doesn’t feel like he’s being pulled at all, it’s like he’s got a fucking life raft.
He understands that he can’t be Steve’s choice.
Steve is talking with their driver about learning to surf, and Tony is finally starting to feel like he can relax. Well, he actually started to feel that way on the plane, but then, he slept for eight hours.
When anyone asks, that’s where they say they got engaged.
Dr. Strange sighs, “The sparkly portals, we can use these rings to create them” he’s speaking slowly as if to children, “Tell us who you need and we can gather the rest of your team.”
Tony takes stock of himself, his head clearing a little. His ass feels used but not too sore. He can feel that Steve is still fully hard inside him.
And Tony is still apologizing, and still trying to explain how this won’t ruin things and Steve knows he can’t let Tony go on thinking he’s politely not interested…
Steve is sucking in desperate gulps of air, overwhelmed by the path Tony has laid out before them.
Okay, so the exercises kind of work. Tony’s heart is no longer racing, but he still has an obvious issue to deal with that isn’t going away. He peaks an eye open and glances first at the tenting of the sheets, and then to Steve, who still has his forehead pressed against Tony’s temple.
Steve expects to swallow the length again, but Tony keeps it shallow, just resting the head inside the tight seal of Steve’s lips like some obscene lollipop.
Tony looks at the photo for a long time before replying.
Or when she sits in Natasha’s lap after an especially taxing mission, turning on her warming function to sooth her aching muscles, and absently licking her arm as she reads.
The strain is too much for even Thor’s divine body, however.
Tony starts absently stroking Steve from base to tip, the precum making it slick and easy. “Hm? Oh yeah I know. That doesn’t matter…”
Rocket’s ears go flat at the mention of Jane. Tony can relate. They both brace for one of Thor’s many speeches where he either lists all of Jane’s best qualities, or describes at length why their break-up was mutual. Mercifully at that moment Steve enters the workshop.
The flight to Hawaii takes eight hours, and Tony sleeps the whole way there. Steve can’t help but smile to himself as he looks at Tony across the aisle, snuggling further in to the fancy blanket that is wrapped around him. Tony’s private jet isn’t quite as nice as the five-star hotel they’ve been staying in, but that doesn’t seem to matter because Tony is finally getting some solid sleep.
“I’ll… I’ll make that reservation for four.” says Steve.
Tony says "Sure thing," blows a kiss to his friend and waits, bouncing on his heels slightly. He’s not nervous, more excited. Maybe a little nervous that Rhodey will say something to scare Steve off since he won’t know he’s just out of frame. Rhodey knows more about his past relationships with men than anyone, and he’s seen some things that aren’t exactly pretty. But Tony’s been transparent these last few months about Steve stepping up and making things right. Rhodey never held Steve responsible for things going to shit really, it’ll be alright.
Oh god Pepper, he’s been sleeping with Tony in his dreams for months and never gave her a second thought. He flushes with embarrassment, eyes darting around to see if there’s any trace of her in the open floorplan.
It’s been a five days of sly glances, heated texting, hurried kisses in abandoned hallways and two aborted attempts to sneak into each other’s rooms in the middle of the night (you try hooking up when you live with a guy who phases through walls and doesn’t need sleep). Tony is actually considering building a secret passageway between the compound’s master suite and Steve’s room, or kenneling Vision at night. Or hell just announcing their relationship at the next team meal, because Five. Days.
Steve can’t stand it. He can’t stand any more of this. Side-stepping everything with a smile. He sits up and folds his legs in front of him, scooting so about two feet remains between them on the sand.
Tony’s breathing hitches at that. Steve slowly moves his hands over Tony’s body. It feels like such a luxury to have time. They’ve only been at the compound together for two weeks, but it feels like longer, having to constantly keep track of who is home, always ready to break apart at a moment’s notice so they wouldn’t get caught.
Steve opens his eyes and watches Tony select a pretty standard-looking washcloth and an orange bottle. The smell of citrus erupts around him as Tony wets the cloth and pours a liberal amount of soap onto it.
Tony can only mumble, “Uh-huh” and push back on Steve’s gloved finger. Steve takes his time, as always, slowly circling inside him, pulling the finger back to almost the edge of Tony’s entrance and stretching out the rim of his hole, then sliding it back in over and over. Just when Tony is about to complain, Steve slides a second finger in with the first. Again it’s tight, and the stretch and burn feel amazing against the blissed out rush of endorphins this entire scene is setting off within him.
“Here comes the first dose Tony, remember to wait…” Steve is breathless, and comes quietly, shoved all the way inside of Tony.
“Why haven’t you done this with anyone else in so long?”
Okay so, I think this may be the last of this series for a while. There is still more I want to write (including "Tony and Steve go camping and Tony fucks Steve up against a tree," and a more angsty "Steve is nervous to hold/care for Morgan" story).
Steve looks at the time stamp on the voicemail. Four hours ago. Okay.
It has to work out.
to. God, all I want is to stay here with you.”
It seems like those are the only words Steve can come up with. Tony. Please.
Tony makes a partially aborted wave of his hand toward the toy baskets. “Hey, yeah sorry this probably looks like a lot! But this isn’t, I mean, it doesn’t have to be… we can do as much or as little as you want.”
The stones are gone, Thanos’ armies are turned to dust before their eyes, and Thor’s people are alive (though for whatever reason Asgard itself could not come back).
Natasha and Sam exchange a long-suffering glance.
Tony's bite doesn't leave a mark though he bit with intent. Interesting. He makes a mental note to test what exactly he'll need to do to leave lasting marks on Steve's body.
Tony scoots up close to Steve, but stops a few inches away, resting his head on the pillow. His eyes are warm as he slowly, achingly slides the last few inches and places a kiss on the underside of Steve’s jaw.
This series is a set of stories based on the AMAZING epistolary fic “1796 Broadway,” where ‘Captain America respectfully requests that all complaints be addressed to him in writing.’ I really admire what the authors are doing, and the slow build they are creating is so so lovely… that said, my brain won’t shut up after each post with “what now???” so this is an answer to that.
Even thinking it feels insane. There's no way he can turn it down, but he also doesn’t get where this leaves him with Cassie, or the security business he's been brainstorming with Luis since they served time together (X-Con Security Consultants). Maggie technically has sole custody, but Scott knows she and Jim want him in Cassie’s life. Steve (he can call Captain America "Steve" now!) assured him they want him on the team, but that they will do whatever it takes for him to see his daughter and keep a life outside of The Avengers.
Steve tries to keep his voice calm, but fails. “What do you mean?
He’ll make it up to him. Tony has a private three-bedroom bungalow on a private beach on Oahu, which is where they are headed now (he also has a place in Maui, but there are always people on the beach there from the surrounding resorts).
Tony smiles, relief flooding through him “Then I think that gets us 90% of the way there. Steve, we need a leader, and we need a single point of direction in the field. When it comes to bigger stuff, we’ll all work together to figure it out.”
“What do you recommend?” Tony asks, breathless, cock twitching. He put the dildos out to see what Steve would do with them, to give him options.
Tony gulps, nodding before a breathy “Yes” escapes. He closes his eyes, and Steve can feel him getting harder under his hand.
Tony is half hard and getting harder by the second. Steve can only shut his eyes and press and rub against his arousal, pulling him as close as possible, his large hands gripping the entirety of Tony’s ass, almost lifting him off the ground in his haste to get closer, soak him in.
“I can’t believe we have to use condoms. If I’d know this was going to happen I would have enjoyed our last time bareback more. Feeling you so raw and hard inside me. Feeling your cum spill into me, filling me up. God I love that feeling.”
Bruce tries, he focuses on the danger, on the people who may get hurt by this mystery plant. But it’s no good. The feeling fades and Hulk is gone.
Tony suspects that this whole thing is playing into Steve’s need to control and protect. Taking every step one at a time, checking in to see how Tony is feeling. No wonder he jumped at this.
Steve is flushed all over, his cock deep red. The titanium handholds creek under his grip.
Bruce can handle dealing with damaged people. He’s worked with lepers for god’s sake… but he really isn’t -- he just doesn’t really know what to say here.
The facade of the building was designed so the entrance looks like it’s a part of the adjacent building. “Entrance” is probably too strong a word, Steve reflects. The door which isn’t easy to see in the first place reads more like some kind of storage, or maybe maintenance access. A blasé utility box hangs on the wall next to it. If anyone opened it up they would see a series of ancient-looking switches and couple of cracked dials which connect to nothing, perfecting the misdirection.
- Tony+Bucky friendship, possibly with more about Tony upgrading his arm.
“Friday, complete blackout, keyed to my usual code.”
“Oh, yeah I’m fine, just distracted, it happens sometimes!” Tony assures him.
Tony is ready. He plans to lead with how insanely happy he is, how there’s no doubt in his mind. Rhoedy just wants him to be happy. It’s going to be fine.
Steve definitely likes when he talks. He just needs to paint him a picture. “There’s so much I want to do with you Steve. To you. I seriously can’t wait to get in there. To soap you up, to have you soap me up. Really take our time, touch you everywhere. I wanna open you up Steve, and take you apart. Show you how good it feels, to be in control, to take what you want...”
Tony sighs relaxing into Steve’s strong hands. “I would love that.”
Because Tony is doing the right thing.
“Steve, it’s okay, like I said I’m totally on-board with everything we’ve done-“
“Rabbit! Why have you absconded with my arm?”
It’s almost two weeks later when he tells Steve casually after one of their team training sessions (wherein a Friday-manned giant lizard monster that looks like Godzilla almost took out Sam) that their
“Uhh, pretty sure I can.” says Rocket, weighing one of Tony’s wrenches in his small hands.
Steve laughs even harder at Tony’s scandalized expression, and soon they're both laughing, and it’s like that day at the pond… but with erections. They laugh until they ache, until finally they’ve both calmed down enough for Tony to blurt out:
After Morgan is born, things change.
… in a couple weeks it’ll be like it never happened at all.
Thor relinquishes the rule/establishment of New Asgard to Valkyrie, and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy.
- Tony teases Nebula more and finds out she has a crush (Captain Marvel? Bucky? Sam? ... Loki? They are both blue, hmm)
Instinct that has been informed by months of dreams where Tony fucks him within an inch of his life. So. Maybe not the most sane move.
Pepper has just started outlining the issue with the new payroll software system for SI when she stops mid-sentence.
Steve has never heard Natasha laugh. She looks up at Tony and, well, it’s not a squeal. Natasha doesn’t squeal, but she makes a… noise, and says “Her tongue is warm!”
Tony brings his arms up to cover his eyes. Steve slowly moves his fingers in and out, scissoring them. Soothing Tony with a gentle rhythm.
And it’s not like he’s asking Steve to pretend to be Johnny Storm or something, more like… a doctor version of himself. Maybe instead of joining the army, Steve decided to help people with his mind and went to medical school. Something like that. He’d still be
Tony steps off the platform and motions for Steve to get on in his place, and drops to his knees. His genius of a shower reads the motion and flips up a soft memory foam bathmat where his knees land. He’s not crazy about being back on his 40-something knees, but the look on Steve’s face is worth it.
Clint hasn’t looked over toward Tony, but says “I can’t believe Stark actually made something actually badass for once. I wonder if she’s battle-ready? I bet I could attach an extra quiver of arrows-”
It’s always Steve's choice. The dreams are frustrating clear there. He could take his hands off Mjolnir, stand up, push Tony away. The hand on the back of is head is resting, supportive, but there’s no force. Anything that happens in the dreams is Steve’s choice, and he always choses Tony.
Carol Danvers flies into their lives like a comet, and Steve sees his chance.
If he can pull this off he should qualify for superhuman status right alongside Captain fucking America.
“Uh, well we met up about five weeks ago to get everything figured out with the Accords… it sort of happened then.”
He turns back to Steve and Tony. “I gotta head back. See you guys in a few months, don’t get married before I come home.”
all of the time. But we need a way to work out what to do when I, or anyone else on the team, thinks something isnt right.”
Tony for all the patience he’s shown up until now has had enough. His now-free hands grab Steve’s errection and he pumps him roughly. As usual the precum Steve has leaked provides more than enough lubrication. Steve is shocked by the sudden touch, hard firm strokes that feel similar to how he treats himself when he’s alone. But he’s not by himself, and seeing Tony limp from his own orgasm, face set in determination, working him over with both hands is enough to set him off. He shoots long white ropes of cum all over Tony’s chest, some gets up onto his neck and even into his facial hair. Oh god.
Everything. Becky. How confused he has been by Tony’s, well, flirting. How confused he is by his own flirting…
“I know now isn’t a good time, and I’m not asking for you to be ready to deal with it, but I have to ask… Why did you invite me here? Did you want to go to Hawaii with me because you want to relax and see hula girls, or because you
But he misses dreaming.
check in. I’m pretty sure you would check in from the grave. But you suddenly disappear to see Tony and then go unresponsive for 48 hours? Of course, you were knocking boots.”
happen, and when it does, we need everyone together. The previous Accords were drafted out of fear and reactionism. The CAP PAC and the changes it promotes to the Accords are the key to a safer present and a safer future.”
Tony rips his mouth away from Steve’s, rutting his ass back in a fervor. Steve stills and allows Tony to take control of the pace, thrusting his hips forward into Steve’s waiting hands and then his ass back onto his hard cock.
"We were able to sequester Vision in Wakanda. Their advanced cloaking and shield technology makes it the ideal place for him and the stones until we can figure out what to do."
The next fifteen minutes are a torturous affair. Steve moves in and out of him like a metronome, in and out with such consistency that Tony feels like he’s getting fucked by a machine. Tony just sinks further into the table and loses himself in it.
That does it, seeing Tony’s cum on skin sets him off. He still manages to be careful. He doesn't squeeze or bend Tony’s less-resilient body, just holds him, pressed fully inside, filling him. God he can tell he’s somehow coming just as much as he did in the shower. He feels like he's coming and coming and will never stop. When it's over Steve stays still, just enjoying the last moments he'll be inside Tony before he has to remove himself. His cum feels sloppy around him, like it's about to slide out at the angle he's still holding Tony.
Bruce appears to be reaching his limit. “Just put the sample in the mini-fridge with the biohazard symbol when you’re done Steve. I’m going to head upstairs to give you some privacy.”
But then Tony starts talking.
Nat rolls her eyes. “Come on Steve, we know you. We were sequestered in a series of tiny shacks and hovels with you for months. After you came back from seeing Tony it was like you were a different person. Not to mention in the months before you left when you could barely eat or sleep. Something was tearing you apart from the inside, and when you got back you were whole again.” She shrugs and spoons another bit of paprikash into her mouth.
They said the serum made him perfect. They didn’t say that it wouldn’t matter how perfect he was when everything else is so… He can’t seem to get it right. No matter what he does he can’t seem to do this…
Steve and Tony deal with the aftermath of sharing Tony's bed. This is p0rn, but all they actually do is touch foreheads... Tony's POV with Steve's to follow in the next chapter.
He feels stupid for being so wrung out over the idea. He isn’t ashamed
to ask if Steve will actually do it. But he doesn’t want to freak him out.
“Please Steve, I can’t wait any more.”
- Steve and Tony break-in the compound shower with one of the level Red settings...
It's great that Steve and Tony are in love and all, but Thanos is still coming for the stones...
Tony’s eye twitches as Rocket puts the wrench back in its foam casing backwards.
Steve feels like his hands are shaking, but when he looks down, they’re steady.
then?”
Tony isn’t even watching the movie; he’s just curled up against Steve with this blissed out look on his face. Peter sneaks a subtle photo.
Steve lowers Tony’s body back down to the bed and slides his hands up to the juncture where Tony’s hands have been gripping his own legs to keep himself open. He pulls Tony’s hands back and replaces them with his own, holding Tony's legs back a bit more. He just holds him open there, taking a moment to look at the result of his efforts on Tony’s entrance.
“You’re wrong if you think I’m not ready to jump into this with everything I am, Tony. You, god I feel everything you just said for you too. I want, I want like you said, to reflect it right back at you.” Steve lets go of Tony’s hands to bring them up to cradle Tony’s head in his massive hands.
Steve hums and seems willing enough, but Tony obviously isn’t getting his point across if Steve isn’t jumping up and bridal-carrying him at a run into the shower.
Steve smiles into the wind.
Tony strokes himself half a dozen more times, the anticipation building with each stroke, then says:
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter chimes in again. “So do we… do something with the shirt? Like is it part of the game?”
Steve nods against Tony’s chest. “I’ll talk to the rest of the team, you talk to the other rest of the team, and we’ll hopefully be back together soon.”
It takes hours. The plans Tony already has in place get them halfway there, but none of it assumed the rogue Avengers were on board. Many things need to be re-worked, hard timelines and goals outlined to move things forward. And it’s only the beginning. Tony will have a lot more to communicate to his lawyers and the Wakandian leaders once Steve can confirm the rest are on board.
He looks at the tiny golden tubes of lube in his hands. Tony gave him about ten. He’s not sure if that’s what he’s supposed to use or if it’s wishful thinking on Tony’s part. He’s pretty sure Tony used two on him. He takes a few and puts them on the bed where they will be easily accessible, then takes a few more and puts them on the nightstand. The last ones go under the pillow Steve figures isn’t Tony's, and is therefore his. There, strategically-placed lube.
“Welcome to the team, Scott." says Steve. "How did everything go in California?”
Scott doesn’t turn around, just raises a thumbs-up over his shoulder “Will do, sounds good. For sure. I’ll for sure do that. Thanks.”
And if he turns around and doesn’t make eggs like he planned it’s not because seeing them together is a problem for him.
“How do I
It seems insane how well-matched they are. Tony doesn’t believe in fate or anything like that, he’s a scientist. But it's just so statistically unlikely that he could find Steve, and for Steve to feel the same way. And for them to have been at such odds with one another and still find themselves here, now, snuggling on his sofa. As much as he hates to admit it, maybe some things exist outside of science.
As they pull up to the gate that marks the start of the private road only accessible by Vibranium-level Stark-card clearance, Steve’s eyes widen. Maybe he thought they were going to some five-star hotel like they were in Japan? Well, why have access to one of the most beautiful, modern, exclusive (Pepper is the only other Vibranium-level Stark-card holder) beach bungalows in the world if you can’t use it?
The rest of the group is waiting for them in one of the open practice fields. Tony introduces the kid and then tells the field “Activate training green 1.”
If Tony was thinking of stepping back from the Avengers before, he goes into semi-retirement. He’s on-hand for their tech needs, or strategy for big picture stuff, but beyond that his days are full developing new advances for SI, taking on a larger role with the Maria Stark Foundation, getting BARF out there to the masses and of course, Morgan.
Bruce simply records the data and moves on.
remember the last six months. They were some of the hardest of my life. And you know what? Because Steve and I were able to figure our shit out, I’m actually optimistic that the next six will be the best.”
Tony grins.
“Don’t call me blueberry.” scoffs Nebula, voice low and threatening.
Steve stands and begins to pace, like sitting and listening to an AI give a report about their sex life is just too much to ask.
“Very good,” says Steve, with such warmth that Tony loses track of what he was about to say.
Tony continues, “So Yeah, the idea of you taking me while I can’t come, while I just lay there and let you use my body (with both of us consenting and knowing full-well it’s more than that), is so fucking hot I can hardly believe I’m not hard. In fact, I am having like, phantom limb pain but for erections? A phantom erection? Like I
He reaches out to grip his legs behind the knees and pulls back to where Steve put him. It’s comfortable enough for now, but he’s not sure how long he can hold this. “Yes I can hold myself open for you, Steve.”
Bruce is about to prompt him again when he breaks his silence: “I suppose… I suppose I didn’t want to risk that things with Tony would change. I wanted to keep… I wanted to keep him.” Steve shrugs sort of helplessly, not sure if that makes any sense to Bruce, given how little he’s explained things (though Bruce is certainly asking some pointed questions, so maybe his feelings for Tony have only been unclear to himself?).
Tony pauses considering what Steve has said so far. What he needs to hear.
what he has to say, but he can't control that.
Tony’s hands are around him now, both of them, just applying firm pressure up and down the length.
Bruce nods and makes more notes.
“I know, I know. And honestly I don’t care, I would love nothing more than for you to come all over that thing like a Jackson Pollock painting, but it's arranged that movers will clear the penthouse out next week and the rug is being donated to some museum… It’ll be a whole thing.”
Steve traces his hands over Tony’s body for several long moments before crawling up on the bed, and inserting himself between Tony’s legs. He slides his hands up Tony's hamstrings and pushes, curling Tony’s legs up toward his chest. Still slow and easy.
“Sit up straight for me.” Tony says after one such interval.
There’s no time for finesse, Steve is obviously almost at his limit. He’s stretched a decent amount from Tony’s fingers, so Tony seals his mouth around Steve’s lighty-abused hole and with one hard thrust inserts his hot tongue.
from Steve right now, that’s okay. It’s enough.
“Scott, can you shrink down and take a look at what’s going on inside it? Wanda, keep it immobilized. Everyone else, fall back and provide cover from these other orbs.” As they’ve been talking more orbs have launched and continue to fire on them.
Steve groans.
“Steve,” Tony’s voice is dead serious. “I need you to listen to me, can you do that?”
we did that I didn’t like. I feel so comfortable with you; it feels so natural... I’ve never felt like this.” Steve’s throat gets tight.
“Please what, Tony?”
Bruce steps out from behind the mystery doctor and suddenly they’re off. Dr. Weird whisks them off to the “New York Sanctum” and lays it all out.
It was the shirt that did it, Tony realizes in horror. It’s so clean, and makes Steve looks so fucking good. It was easy to imagine the shirt as a lab coat, and well, here they are.
Steve trails his hands over Tony’s chest and stomach, slowly sliding further and further, conscious that him being so tight might also be too much for Tony. It seems fine though, as Tony is now just wantonly thrusting his hips in little abortive movements and grabbing brutally at the comforter beneath his hands.
“Shh, shh, you’re okay Steve.” Tony smooths his hands over Steve’s neck and chest, chasing the blush. “It’s honestly super hot. Nothing wrong with getting into it, I bet it makes jerking off a dream… But the rug you're kneeling on? It cost over $350,000.”
“You’re wrong.” Says Steve, voice low.
“Uhg, as if you have anything I would want!” Rocket scoffs. “The tech on this planet is so out-dated. Thor, I don’t know why you keep having him adjust the arm, I’m telling you, I can do better.” Rocket casually throws a series of bundled wires back where he found them.
Tony coughs, and Steve begins to move the meeting agenda along to training when Vision speaks.
“Tony, what?” Steve clearly hasn’t connected the dots, and is looking increasingly desperate, side-eyeing his t-shirt crumpled on the ground next to the elevator.
Peter leans over so he can whisper to Tony that he now understands his joke about “No ticket” that he made when The Avengers were guests of honor on the Goodyear blimp for the Superbowl last month, but the words catch in his throat.
He feels petty and angry and wants to punish Steve. Drag him down low to where Tony’s been these last months. Fuck, maybe he shouldn’t even see Steve face to face. Maybe he should leave him down there to rot.
Water has started pouring out of 6 of the faucets, steaming up the shower and making it pleasantly warm, but not hot.
Tony is basically non-verbal now, just moaning with the occasional word slipping through like “yes” or “fuck.”
Tony is doing everything he can not to roll over and ravage Steve. Like, literally everything.
“Tony, come let me fuck you in the shower!”
It’s what he deserves, he knows. He really meant what he wrote to Steve: he is thankful for his friendship. No matter how many times he treats Steve like crap, he still comes back, all full of respect and warmth and…
Tony isn’t 100% sure what the right thing is, but for right now, for Steve, he’ll take a step back, and take his sunglasses off, and just enjoy watching him drink from his lion cup.
Tony’s mouth drops as he watches Steve slowly piston his cock back and forth through his own hand, spreading the lube and the precum.
Another almost-pained groan escapes as he answers “N-noo.”
, thinks Tony. Shuri stifles a startled laugh.
“Let me guess,” says Steve, “you have more options.”
