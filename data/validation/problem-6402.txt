At that moment, Ryder finished talking to the driver and leaned back in his seat. Cali then chose to focus her attention to the passing buildings. Ryder ran his fingers alongside Tony’s jaw and smiled.
Steve’s chest grew tight and he knew that he had a long way to go, but he was never one for giving up.
“Nope, don’t say anything. I just wanted to get all of this off my chest and I’ve been practicing in front of my mirror for weeks and my mirror never said anything back. So like just…don’t feel like you have to say anything, okay?”
Steve chuckled at the easy acceptance of his compliment and Miles took out different colors and compared them with the two they decided upon. They finally reached the decision that they would do silver. The two began coloring and Miles discussed how much fun he had on his trip. He told him all about LEGOLAND and how Tony fell into a duck pond. He told Steve not to tell Tony he knew, but his Uncle Rhodey had pictures.
Tony wordlessly stared at Steve his own eyes widening at Steve’s admittance. Tony didn’t know how to respond and thankfully Steve didn’t prompt him to say anything.
“Says the one who has suffered from the violence that his own brother has reared. Tell me do you think that car accident was truly an accident or it was intentional and somehow you were the lucky one that survived.”
All of them had been wondering whether they should leave Tony in the dark or tell him about what was happening. There were heavy arguments for both sides.
“I thought you and Rhodey are his only friends,” Sam said. “That’s all he ever talks about. Never mentioned a Ryder.”
“Alright Miles how are we feeling about chicken nuggets,” Tony questioned walking outside of the lab.
Ryder shrugged. “Don’t know. Don’t really care too much honestly. You may have lost it in the car with all that waving your hands angrily. Probably slipped off your wrist, didn’t seem like it was sized to good,” Ryder said and stuffed a piece of bacon into Tony’s mouth.
Steve casually picked up a book that was left behind in the cleaning and placed it on the bookshelf as he made his way to Tony’s bed.
Once Tony had slumped back onto the bed and his breathing had calmed down, Steve pulled his fingers out of Tony.
“You need legal counsel especially for that reason. All of you are rather close to the Accords. There is an emotional closeness that will prevent you from viewing things holistically. Tony felt that if he were to discuss things with you all, you would not listen. From your refusal to look me directly in the eye I am guessing I am correct,” Isa pointed out. “And from the fact that Tony looks like he’s being brought out of an attack I know I am correct.”
Now he knew why Natasha really wanted him to come to Karen’s. For a moment he tried hiding in Karen’s, but Karen merely raised her eyebrows and directed him elsewhere.
So when he had seen Steve again for the first time, he felt hollow. The second time, he realized that hollow feeling was a feeling of loss at something he had never knew he had obtained in the first place. Everything that had happened came all too quickly. Suddenly, they were fighting each other and then fighting others at opposite ends of the world…no…correction universe.
“Welcome!” Miles shouted now actively pushing away from Tony to get some room. Tony slightly lessened his hold on Tony so that he could grab a cracker from the box Miles had been eating out of.
“Yeah, I don’t know how, but this kid just has like a super grip on everything. Thanks again for this Steve I really appreciate it,” Tony replied honestly taking the bowl of spaghetti from Steve.
Tony nodded and pushed open the door to Miles’ room. Miles was sitting in his bed and coloring in his coloring book. Tony smiled and went to go sit down at the head of Miles’ bed before Miles flung the coloring book at Tony and pulled the covers over his head.
Everyone in the kitchen, sans Sam and Bucky began chuckling. Steve stuffed his mouth with a piece of toast, before handing a full plate to Tony. Tony accepted it graciously and began to eat. Steve smiled softly at him, kissing the corner of his mouth fully aware that no one’s attention was on them, instead entirely focused for the moment on Sam and Bucky’s complete and utter lack of secrecy.
Clint giggled and rubbed his hands together. “Oh I like this talking Bucky. So was there crying involved or hugging?”
“You’d think Mr. Stark would know how to control his kid in a public setting,” a parent said scoffing.
The conversation was over some prank which Tony knew he should be somewhat concerned about, after hearing frozen ice and hair dye, but he figured that was a topic for another day.
But now here they were, nearly the same spot where they were in the beginning trying to be earth’s mightiest heroes. Tony had wondered whether they could do this together, whether they could heal.
But the children’s therapist that Tony had hired to help deal exactly with what all of them were going through helped show him that it wasn’t anything to be concerned about it was just them establishing a sense of comfort and security and eventually once they knew nothing was going to jeopardize their family they would eventually start sleeping in their own rooms. In addition the fort nights had slowly tapered off into one every week as opposed to how they originally slept in each other’s room every day. So there was progress being made.
Tony seemed to internally struggle with what to do. Logically he knew with the state of his hands he couldn’t bandage his hands. However, his heart wanted nothing to do with Steve. He wished that Ryder were here because as a doctor he would have been equipped to handle this. He had lately been equipped with handling the bruises and scars on Tony’s body.
“Ryder’s been the only one that has been the main person in Tony’s life so far, besides Peter and little strawberry,” Pepper softly whispered.
Mrs. Thompson soothed the wrinkles in her dress, before addressing Principal Davis. “Principal Davis I am sure my son is not to blame for this little skirmish. I have raised him to be a respectable young man. Now Principal Davis I am certain that you and I can reach the conclusion that Peter and Harley are not quite respectable. Although they can’t be to blame, their home lives are not quite as structured as ours.”
“And you know sometimes on those nights, when we laid together I’d whisper to him,” Ryder petered his voice off to a whisper, “that Captain America would have left bruises far deeper and darker than the ones I had. After all, that’s what happened in Siberia. You made it so easy. If he was so accepting of the bruises from you, that made it all the more easy to justify the ones I gave to him. After all, yours was done out of poorly misplaced anger. Mine was done out of love. Every bruise, every scratch, every single piece of smooth skin that I ran over with my teeth and-”
He smiled widely at Bucky and then turned back to Steve. “Then who are you talking about? Everyone is seated together at this table. So I’m sure you have a lot of potential talking companions. I mean I’m pretty sure Tony organized it to fit all of us because the other tables only sit fifteen.”
“Yeah, well when you basically grew up with absent parents you had to learn how to make your own food. Plus Jarvis’ wife, Ana, was our cook and I often gravitated toward her so she taught me everything I know about food,” Tony said smiling fondly.
His hatred from Ryder grew even stronger and Steve hadn’t even realized he could feel so strongly like this before. He had only felt like this once and it was against Hydra. Steve couldn’t make the distinction between either now.
They nodded their heads as though that was all the answer Tony needed. It wasn’t. He raised an eyebrow and shifted his body, mindful not to wake up Miles.
Tony had no good reason to answer him why. He shouldn’t have left him here and not visited. He could only imagine how this must have affected Miles.
It was as if everything shuttered off and Steve wished he could retraces his steps back to when those warm hurt-filled brown eyes were staring into his own, hopeful that Steve could protect him for the night and hopefully for the rest of their lives.
“You had suspicions,” Steve growled stepping closer to Natasha. Then he backed down seeing as though first she was Natasha and second they were all in the same boat.
Of course Tony had been fast asleep, dead to the world and hopefully being accepted into his safe world of dreams.
“I’m not saying that you are Tony. I would never try to control you because human beings are not meant to be controlled. I just don’t want you pushing my away like you have done, since you have woken up.”
Miles especially wanted out of Tony’s floor and sought to explore. He had looked at Tony with big eyes and a heavy pout that should definitely be illegal and asked Tony if they could go play downstairs with the others.
Harley gave out a long groan. “Ugh, dad please this is not the time for a pep-talk over how unfortunately boring Peter is. It’s not okay to lie.”
“You said that you would get better. You made me promise to be patient and I have been patient. But how can I continue to be patient, when every time…every fucking time I am around you I end up with bruises, a swollen this or that, scars from broken glass, a sore throat, and more. How can I fucking know what upsets you, when everything I do upsets you! You just want me to stop being me?” Tony questioned loudly trying to push Ryder’s hands away from him.
He stepped back and took a few calming breaths and handed the gun back to Bucky, who then placed it in his holster.
“Please, I can lost very long. It was you who fell asleep during act three. But I suppose what can I expect, I’m just that good,” Tony smirked.
Tony frowned and looked at Peter, before going back to watching Miles. “I thought that things were getting better?”
Tony tugged on his hoodie and left the room. Until he reached his tower, he would continue looking at his surroundings. He didn’t want to be caught off guard. He hoped Cali was as genuine as she seemed. He settled into his seat and rested his eyes for a little bit, hoping to sleep off the rest of the alcohol. He was able to sleep for about an hour, before the pilot announced he was home.
“I’m fine with what I’m doing right now,” Sharon cheekily proclaimed. “It’s actually rather amusing. Though I do have to agree that my cousin should have been back by now. However, I don’t even know where he went off to so maybe he’s just kept up talking to someone.”
“No touching! No more touching,” Tony screamed hands pushing away Natasha’s. His words caught on sobs, each cry a fragment of its own kind. His eyes went back and forth.
“Hey, no Tony. Can’t fall asleep,” Natasha soothed raising his head and gently pressing her hand into his back.
He went to Miles’ first and then Harley’s. Seeing no adult sized genius in there, meant that the third place he had to look for Tony was in his lab. And lo and behold said genius was in there, a sense of wild frenzy in his eyes.
Steve parked the car and got everyone out, Harley helping with Peter’s bags. The four of them all went into their home, quickly dropping off their bags, before heading to the roof where Sam and Bucky had been putting things together.
Bucky’s and Clint’s insistence that he give Tony his original gift brought Steve to grab Tony and ask that he meet him. So there he was.
Whew, how long has it been, since we've had a relatively short chapter? Does this mean that some stuff is going down (most of which you all have been hoping for lol) in these last few chapters and the author is just giving y'all a little break...possibly.
When the ride was over, Steve curled an arm around Tony’s shoulder. Tony patted Steve’s back. “It’s alright Captain. I won’t tell anyone about you screaming like a newborn baby,
As the coffee brewed, he settled on looking at all the pictures and art work stuck to the refrigerator. At first Tony wondered why so much was on there, but Peter had assured him that lots of families put important pictures and home drawings there. And who was he to stop that, when everyone began adding pictures, some fighting for the best spot.
After what seemed like a few more minutes, Ryder sharply pulled himself a way and rubbed himself before he spent himself all over Tony’s face. Tony weakly pushed at Ryder once he was done and leaned over the bed to dry heave.
“Make it ten,” Natasha said standing from her kneeling position from the ground and slightly towering over Isa. “I went into this thinking the Accords were fair. Now I know that they are. Packet.”
“Little children’s ears incoming,” Clint called from the vent as Miles, Harley, and Peter ran into the kitchen.
Tony scoffed. “Don’t feel like you need to sugarcoat things. I can’t get over this simple kidnapping. Hell my whole life was preparing me for this.”
Steve grit his teeth together at the performance Isak was giving. He wanted to shake his shoulders and pour out of him the truth that was stifled behind his lying lips.
“With all due respect sir this started with Tony’s refusal to listen to my concerns about the Accords,” Steve said leaning forward.
Isak stared at Steve, expressive eyes dulling for just a second. His eyes shifted to Bucky and Natasha who were at the two opposite corners, before his eyes found Steve’s again. He sighed, pinching the bridge of his noise and smiling self-deprecatingly.
Tony reached out and grabbed ahold of her wrist. “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. You help me out of here and I can get you out of this CMPNY, whatever it is. I’m Tony Stark,” he added smirking painfully. “Or go look for my watch and I can handle the rest, yeah?”
Rhodey was leaning against a wall, unwilling to sit down even if his leg was giving him pain. He wanted to be ready at any time, if a doctor happened to call upon him saying Tony was awake. He was in conversation with Pepper. Both of them spoke in hushed tones. Pepper wiped wearily at her eyes and shook her head at something Rhodey said. Rhodey in turn nodded and stared in front of him, motioning with his hand to a vending machine. The two quickly parted from the group and headed toward the machine, but not before asking if anyone wanted anything.
When he went into the kitchen, he silently began to make some coffee. He looked as his phone and saw a few missed messages from Pepper and Rhodey. The two of them had been checking in on him throughout the week, as they usually did. He had no doubt in his mind that if Rhodey wasn’t off “training” with his physical therapist and Pepper wasn’t closing deals in Italy this weekend, the two of them would have been here.
Steve hadn’t minded. Instead he had made sure Tony was all taken care off. He placed him in a pajama set that Clint had given him jokingly. Though it was slightly large on Tony’s smaller frame, Tony hadn’t minded all that much when he had to wake up and change into it.
He turned his eyes toward Cali, who ran her fingers over the empty bottle of liquor. Tony smacked his lips together wincing at the taste of alcohol lingering on them. Ryder leaned forward and grasped his chin pulling him closer to his face.
Pepper sighed tiredly, talking to the Avengers was draining the energy out of her. She smiled sadly at them all, wondering just how bad things had gotten in such a short amount of time. She used to admire these heroes and praise them on how they made Tony into a better man. She thought they were all changing him for the better, giving him a life purpose again. Admitting that she was wrong, once again, sent a sharp flicker of pain through her body.
“Get off me! No one listens! I said stop touching me. Why are you touching me?” Tony cried eyes hurriedly looking at everything in the bathroom, searching for any method of attack. “Stay back.”
Ryder gave a brief look around his surroundings to make sure no one was following, before he slid into the seat beside Tony and then the car sped off.
Tony tried his best to stay awake, but could not resist the pull of whatever had been placed on him. It reminded him of what Ryder had done, when he said no to the proposal. Ryder had simply nodded and placed something on Tony’s neck. The rest was spent in a blur.
“No,” Tony mumbled into his pillowcase. “Not…going…to…sleep,” he said each word punctuated by a yawn.
“No, you won’t. You won’t forget I existed. Don’t think I don’t know some marks on your body won’t fade. It’ll be a nice little reminder of all the things I did to you won’t it?”
Jaime laughed and Tony tried ignoring the warmth that spread in his body when Steve whispered close to his ear. It reminded him of the closeness and the warmth that spread to him, when Steve had pressed a kiss against his check last night. Tony wondered if he should bring it up to Steve. Thinking less of it, he decided he wouldn’t. Besides it was probably just a good night thing. Plus things were good right now and he didn’t want to make it weird.
“Because Tony is a nice person. Do not know why it is so hard for you all to notice that,” Isa told him. “He’s been taking care of your family and keeping them out of the spotlight. I’m sure you would have known that if perhaps you gave your wife a call. But oh well guess exiles don’t really have access to a phone.”
Of course in his hurry to get home Steve hadn’t thought of that. All he knew was that he wanted to get to Tony as quickly as possible. However, looking down at himself and seeing the scratches, bite marks, and cracked blood on the part of skin that was visible he told himself that Tony did not deserve to see him like that.
“And…I’m not seeing what’s wrong about that. I’m making sure my son is healthy,” Tony said, heading to the conference table.
“Tony you have to stop placing everything on your shoulders. This was a messed up situation all around. Rogers fucked it up even more, but that has nothing to do with you. Tony please just stop telling yourself that you are to blame.”
Steve evened out his own breaths, his breathing having picked up from slight panic over Tony’s current state. Tony’s brown eyes met worried blue ones. Tony averted his gaze and shook his head, breathing still having a harshness and wheeze to it, sounding like Steve in his asthma days.
Isak stretched his hands out toward him in a placating manner. Steve wondered what it would take to get his hands cuffed tightly, so that they bruised whenever he shifted.
Steve looked around and breathed, heart thumping with anticipation. “No, now we just need to wait for the guest of honor.”
Steve scratched the back of his necks. “Yeah, I guess like you I came to my senses. Plus Isa’s explanation left no room for disagreement. I would have been a fool to deny the pros of signing the Accords.”
Steve looked around himself and began to look as confused as Tony felt. Tony opened up the cabinets and started looking in them. Lately Miles had developed this thing where he liked hiding in small places as though him and Tony were forever playing a game of hide and seek. So far the hiding spots had been relatively safe. So it nearly gave Tony a heart attack when he raised his eyes to see Miles standing on top of the refrigerator.
“So please, don’t destroy the little bit of family I have left. Because next time Rhodey and I might not be fast enough. And I’d really hate to be giving you this speech again, when I would also have to make time for making a eulogy.”
Sam didn’t even look up from where he was making biscuits. “Natasha what a wonderful surprise. Mind telling me why you are breaking into my home this early in the morning.”
Natasha wanted to dig deeper, but knew it wasn’t her place anymore. She had to earn that trust back to where Tony could confide in her.
Steve walked off to his room and immediately went into his bathroom and ran the shower water. He waited until it was warm, before stepping inside.
Ryder had soothed the space between his brows, forced a pill between his lips and told him to swallow. Tony woke up disoriented and his limbs wouldn’t move at his own command.
Miles held onto Tony tighter as Tony tried placing Miles down in his seat. Eventually Tony was able to sit Miles down. Miles head rolled onto Tony’s lap and Tony let it rest there.
“I’m thankful that Rhodey finally got his head out of his behind and defined his relationship with his physical trainer,” Tony joked. “Thankful that Pepper continues to be a guiding force in my life. Gosh, thankful to May for raising such an incredible young man who I’m very much looking forward to passing down the reins of my jobs to as soon as he’s graduated.”
Steve rolled his eyes at Tony and pulled the blanket over his eyes. It didn’t stop Tony’s laughter though. Steve smiled widely at the sound of Tony laughing again. He caught a few nurses, doctors, and patients looking at him oddly. He wondered the source of their looks, before he realized he was smiling albeit probably a little crazy, while carrying a body hidden in a blanket. He had the thought to stop smiling, but then figured that would be way worse.
Steve felt a warmth settle in his body as he reminisced how he and Bucky would often prepare food with the little rations they had back in the day…though he was fairly certain Bucky had done more of the cooking. Even the Commandos had known that Steve couldn’t be trusted to make anything after his first incident of cooking for them. To this day he still argued that his soldiers just couldn’t stomach the spices he had found from that market place.
He snatched the patch off and placed it in his jacket pocket that was on the floor. He figured when he got back, he would have Bruce inspect it and see what it was. He set his jacket aside and looked for any telephone in this room. As he got up he swayed a little on his feet. As the wave of nausea passed his eyes moved around the room and with a sinking feeling he realized he was in the same room he had been when Ryder first
He knew that Bucky could have stopped him, before the first shot rang out. He had the skillset to prove it and if not Clint was more than capable of diverting Steve’s next actions.
The two smiled stupidly at one another and it was as though for that split second in time that all of this turmoil and paint that had happened had vanished. Steve felt his chest loosen at the thought that Tony was here and he was safe. He had no thoughts in his mind that Natasha was not capable of protecting Tony, but it was better seeing him safe and sound with his own eyes. Tony seemed to be doing much of the same, eyes traveling all at once over Steve’s body, tracking for any signs of scarring or blood that had not been there when they were last in each other’s spaces.
Steve shrugged. “I don’t know. I mean it’d be hard you know with us basically staying on alert for if anything happens. But I know Tony has a plan implemented for Miles, if something were to happen when we need Iron Man. So…I don’t know he just seems lost and I think maybe it would be good to get him in a smaller environment to let him deal with his-”
Instead, he just sent the kids to go set up the music inside and hopefully by the time they came back to the roof this argument between Sam and Bucky would have ended.
“I just…I’m so tired,” Tony admitted. “I’m tired of having hope. I’m tired of thinking for once that I’ll have something good in my life and having it taken away. I have you both and Miles. I think I have the Avengers. I just…I keep waiting for the day it’s all taking away.”
Tony shook his head and pushed weakly at the warmth he wanted to lean in toward. “Ryder’s gonna come when I wake up.”
“Morning Uncle Tony,” Peter said plopping down. “Hey Dr. Banner quick question,” Peter started on some project he was working on, Bruce already awake and alert adding his own commentary. Harley himself interjected a few times, before he was pulled into conversation with Clint who had since left his spot in the vents to sit down on the kitchen counter.
Steve agreed. His feet seemed to carry him to Tony’s room and he let the comforting warmth ease the energy vibrating through his veins. A sense of peace, coupled with the warmth, took over him. He smiled softly, opening the door, ready to tease whether Tony had fun with Pepper, Rhodey, and the boys.
“Aww you get to leave early and with Mr. Stark. So cool,” he whispered as he handed Peter his backpack.
A pause in the conversation meant that Peter was replying and while Steve’s hearing was really good, he could only pick out a few words from Peter.
“Okay, Steve. So Thor and Bruce will be on their way with catering. Pepper and Rhodey said they stopped back at the office for a bit, but will be stopping by in a little bit. They’ll let you know, when they’re ten minutes out.”
Steve put the dirtied washcloth in the trashcan and went toward the medicine cabinet to grab the medkit. Tony stared blankly at Steve and reached his hands out for the medkit, only to wince in pain when the contact from the kit met his burning skin.
His smile froze on his face as his eyes settled on the empty bed. Immediately his heart began thundering and the thought, “Not again” was constantly being repeated in his head. He first went to check in the bathroom, when a whimper caught his attention.
Miles looked at Steve and wordlessly pointed to the fruit snakes. Over the past few days the two had grown closer over their love of art. Miles had expressed a wariness to all of the Avengers. The only one he had latched onto had been Natasha. Anyone besides her and Tony he refused to engage with. However, that had changed four days ago.
Their hands clasped together and Steve’s thumb rubbed against the skin between Tony’s pointer finger and thumb. Tony shivered at the touch and brought his hand down. Steve took the hand back and nervously rubbed the back of his neck.
The rest of their time was spent talking and watching cooking shows. Miles would wake up every now only for him to fall back asleep. Tony was disappointed when Peter told him that it was time to go to his Aunt May’s. He and Harley had homework to catch up on. Peter grabbed a sleeping Miles. Tony had wanted to say goodbye to his son, but figured that he didn’t want the chance of Miles possibly growing upset that he had to be leaving so soon.
Steve at some point had begun reciting them aloud, but he was too far gone to stop now. He was only glad that Tony was still resting peacefully. His fingers ran through his hair, much like his mom did when he was younger.
He saw Wanda looking more relaxed and calm than ever, while talking to Vision. He looked as Natasha and Bruce engaged in a conversation with shy smiles and bodies slightly worn with tension. He saw Sam and Rhodey comparing short and often amusing stories about their time in the military. He saw Thor attempting to steal dessert from the other tables, while Loki grinned mischievously his hand outreached and…wait…
“I was for amending it. Then we found Bucky and my focus shifted. Soon it became more about protecting Bucky. And I had to protect him because I couldn’t last time. So I figured the trouble with the Accords would distract him from what was happening with Bucky. I thought us fighting over that would manage to hold his attention and-”
“You’re the one who decided to hit me in the most fucking visible place asshole,” Tony hissed fed up with how Ryder was making it seem as though this was all his fault.
Peter nodded in understanding. “Is that what your fight with Flash was about? I mean I just jumped in, but you never really told me what happened.”
“He’s fine. He’s been wondering why you have been ignoring his messages and not making your weekly visits. I tried easing his worries and making sure he didn’t show up at the tower, but Tony you should make sure to talk to the boy.”
Steve looked over at Bucky and smiled, knowing immediately where his thoughts were. Bucky smirked back slightly, mouthing, “Punk.”
Tony struggled for breath against a broken rib. He coughed and felt a piercing pain in his chest. He looked down to see Ryder’s hand pressed firmly against the reactor. Tony surged forward, attempting to throw Ryder off of him. Ryder only tightened his thighs that encompassed Tony’s waist.
“You’re right. You don’t need my protection,” Steve rasped. “That doesn’t mean I’ll ever stop trying to protect you. You don’t need it, but I do. I need to protect you from me.”
Steve laughed, wrapping his arm around Tony’s shoulders. The rest of the team slowly began to give their own congratulations and jokingly argued about their spot as Tony and Steve’s best men. The night continued full of laughter and celebrating the engagement. At one point Clint had humorously called for speeches and it was all fine and well…up until Thor started weeping as he quoted he was so overcome with emotion.
He waited a brief moment for the sentiment to be shared, but his only response was the click of a phone hanging up. Tony rubbed his hands over his face.
Steve shook his head and continued rambling. “You don’t understand. I can’t breathe, when I know that Tony is hurting because of me. It’s always been me Nat. I was hoping things with Tony would eventually develop to-”
His thoughts slowly raced around his head and his mind grew dizzy. Would Natasha be there too? He wanted Natasha. Natasha could stop this feeling of powerlessness and emptiness resting in his body. He wanted Bruce because he hadn’t seen him in so long and maybe he’d help him figure out why his eyes couldn’t focus and why he still felt like panic was gnawing at the back of his tongue.
He walked in so fast, he barely missed tripping on a lump on the floor. He would have mistaken it for just a few blankets tossed on the ground, if it weren’t for the quiet ouch coming from underneath it.
“Okay, what’s with the whole silence?” Tony questioned, trying to insert a little laugh to lighten up whatever the hell just made things tense.
“And he didn’t Steve. He never did,” Tony gasped wetly. “I kept trying. Everything that I did was because I believed in those promises that he would get better. I lied to my son. I lied to Rhodey, Pepper, all of you. And for what?”
The stressed sound didn’t ease Steve’s worries. Instead he kept massaging Tony’s hands and Tony was completely content to just stay like this.
“Yes, it is a delicate one that need the most utmost attention,” Marley said, leaning heavily on Sophie. “I am quite certain it might be the most important mission of your life, kind sir.”
“Steve you can’t just tell him you’re going to take him to see his mom,” Natasha told him. “You need to have your information with Karen and you need to be safety trained, which you aren’t.”
“Oh, really?” Natasha sarcastically commented. “How could I be angry, when you clearly just disrespected a teammate, a friend? I mean that was completely unacceptable Clint. Lately, you’ve just been blatantly rude to Tony and for what?”
Steve looked hopefully at her. Natasha grabbed his chin lightly and repeated the mantra of in and out. Steve managed to match her breathing and slowly felt the tightness in his chest loosen up.
Rhodey breathed lowly through his nose. “Nah, you know I would never leave you Tony. You’re the best friend I have, besides Pepper. I just saw you shivering and I couldn’t let you be even more uncomfortable than you already are over being in this hospital.”
The questioned startled him, just as much as it startled Tony whose eyes quickly blinked open. Steve shook his head at how Tony tensed and his expression grew tight. He wanted to sooth those lines in his face and get rid of the tension settling between his eyebrows.
“Umm, nothing much else planned to be honest. Tried to keep my schedule fairly open to get ready to head to Italy…Steve!” Tony shouted as Steve swallowed him down in one steady movement.
“Listen Little Stark Steve and I got into a lot of rough mishaps back in my day. So I think I know that isn’t simply a lab incident.” He raised his index finger and waved it to the spot on Tony’s cheek.
A feeling so deep overwhelmed Tony. It was this feeling of nothingness, but it felt so heavy inside him. It spread throughout his entire body and a sob threatened to ease itself out of his throat, but he swallowed it back. His eyes had lost their focus and the tapping at his chest grew frantic and he felt himself lean over in the chair struggling to breathe.
Pepper shook herself out of her thoughts. “I don’t know. I mean something in the back of my mind was telling me something’s up with Ryder. So when Natasha asked us to you know separate the two for a while, I was kind of hoping that I’d find out what doesn’t sit right with me. I mean you understand, right? I’m not just going crazy or overprotective?”
Clint offered him another and went to grab another wet towel. They continued sitting there in that cramped stall listening to people come in and out, not knowing that two of the world’s mightiest heroes were off hiding because they didn’t know what to do.
“Ryder, I’ve heard that is such a delightful place to go in the spring,” the voice moaned. “There is a part of me that hopes he denies your proposal if only to go the estate. Has he been there before?”
Natasha smiled as she closed the door behind her. “I believe that we can make a short stop at a flower shop on our way to the hospital.”
“Love you too kid,” he said. “Take care of this one and tell May I said thanks again for watching him and Harley.”
Miles sent an unimpressed glare to Tony. Tony waved his hands in defeat. “Okay, bambino. Have at it.”
“I should have taken a break and stayed with him. We were family, but I didn’t.” She shrugged her shoulders. “But wow this was so not supposed to be about me. I see what you did Rogers, deflecting.”
“Hi, you’ve reached the voicemail messaging system of Steve Roger to leave a message please wait for the tone,” the automated voice message
Ryder rolled his eyes. “Come on Tony. Don’t be like this. This was all just a lesson. I didn’t even let Winston touch you. I just needed to make you realize that you and I are forever. There is no Steve. Because at the end of the day, Steve will leave you.”
So he hurried himself in the bathroom, stripping himself of his uniform. Dry cleaning was going to be awful.
“Well Barton one of the benefits of the Accords is that we will be able to protect your family and friends,” Tony began, fingers moving to his chest, a habit he just still couldn’t break off. “It will make sure that those closet to you will be offered safety in the chance of something going wrong. It will also make sure that your family is not indicted on any charges if you-”
Even with the absence of a last name he was Iron Man. He had no reason to fear this man who he could easily crush with his suit. He had destroyed others ten times the size of Ryder. Then why didn’t he?
So she handed Miles over to Vision, but not without some complaint from Miles. “I know Miles, but we just want to make sure Tony is okay. Vision is going to take you back to the ballroom to watch the puppets, okay? The next time you see me we’ll have your baba back.”
“Well, it must not have been serious with how long he stayed. Did you ever ask him, if he wanted to leave?” Isak questioned.
Her own tears fell over her eyes because she had always loved seeing people who came in who genuinely wanted to adopt a kid and provide them with love. Karen ran her hand soothingly over his back as Tony’s shoulders racked with the vibrations from his sobs.
“No, you’ve apologized to Laura. You have not apologized to Tony and frankly if I am being honest Clint Tony is the reason you are able to still get in contact with your wife,” Natasha said heatedly. “And I am not saying this to guilt you into an apology. If that’s the case, I don’t want you apologizing. It has to be sincere. However, I will say this I have never been so disappointed in your behavior these past few weeks in regards to Tony.”
Tony and Steve were putting up groceries, when Tony pulled out a box of fruit snacks. He frowned, distinctly remembering that he had made sure that he hadn’t bought any. He turned to look at Steve who was looking down with flushed cheeks.
“I know that I haven’t been the best boyfriend to you. I know that the bruises I leave on your skin don’t fade away in days. It’s just sometimes I can’t control my actions and I know that it may sound like I’m just making excuses. But just listen to me honey,” Ryder whispered and leaned toward Tony.
Tony nodded at that. “I know, but I am okay. Know why I am okay?” Miles shook his head. “Because I am surrounded by three of my most favorite people in the world.”
Ryder tried lifting his arms, but was not able to do so. Wide terrified eyes looked up at him and he struggled in his chair, rocking his body forward or so he thought. In all actuality, he had never moved.
He didn’t however mention to their therapist how many nights he found himself seeking comfort in that fort made of pillows and blankets as well.
Bekah continued. “I spent three years in the army. Then I got pregnant and when Harley was born that too became the greatest moment of my life. Raising Harley became the main goal in my life, the only thing that mattered to me besides well you know,” she trailed off, knowing that Steve at least knew a little bit of her struggle with drugs.
“I am so sorry you had to deal with them alone. I meant to be here on time. Please forgive me,” Isa exclaimed looking at Tony wearily.
Ryder entered the room pushing Tony further into it. Behind him were Winston, Cali, Miriam, and four other bodies. Tony’s body grew aflame with anger and he pushed back at Ryder. Ryder raised an eyebrow.
And damn if Tony wouldn’t try to pretend to do exactly that. Exactly what he has been doing, with no one being the wiser.
“I may have never been involved in the physical aspects that Ryder often had my sister or other agents enforce, but I was his informant. Anything he wanted to know, I had everything made available to him. I gave him files on…children…sick children whose parents wouldn’t miss them when we would do experiments for our serum. I changed hospital records to make it seem like it wasn’t Ryder’s fault that his patients were dying.”
Two more hours passed and it was nearing the time for Steve to take Harley to his mom. So he set Miles down and told him he could probably go play with Natasha, until Tony woke up again. Miles quickly went off to find Natasha. Steve made sure to let FRIDAY alert him, when Miles made it to Natasha. A few minutes later he got the confirmation.
It had been three days since Steve had learned that Tony had adopted Miles and it had been three whole days of Steve trying to talk to Tony, but Tony running in the other direction. Steve tried not to feel disheartened and rationalized with himself that he deserved this distance.
“Tony,” Rhodey said. “Your lover boy was getting a little dead looking so we all suggested he go home, take a shower, and get an actual good meal. He’s been watching over you, he hasn’t really taken time to look after himself. And if he gets to the point where all his energy is depleted he won’t be able to. So we told him we were on our way to visit you anyways and so he left with the others. They’ll all probably be back soon, maybe not Clint though. He had to visit his wife and kids.”
“Look how easy it is for you to fight, but not for you to stay,” Bucky mockingly said. “Didn’t know that leaving him in Siberia would set the trend.”
Julie had come back into the waiting room, hearing the commotion. Her eyes zeroed in on Harley and the doctor. She tried seeing who she should direct her attention toward and settled on Harley. She pulled him into a hug and Harley awkwardly let her do so. Natasha walked toward the two of them and whispered to Julie. Julie nodded and led him away to the trains.
“You know that’s all they’re going to be talking about for the rest of the class,” Peter told him throwing his backpack over his shoulder.
Ryder was quick to enter the bathroom that time and coo to him as though he were a child. He cleaned up Tony’s mess and helped him brush his teeth. Tony had bit at the fingers that came close to his lips. Ryder frowned and walked away.
“Ryder manipulated you at a time where you were feeling vulnerable and he knew exactly just how to make everything fall into place. He knew that the people you trusted, your friends, your family had all but gone off to separate corners of the world.”
“Because if me saying I forgive them gets them to stay, I’ll keep telling them I forgive them. It’s fine. Eventually they’ll forgive me for whatever they think I need forgiveness over and it’ll be okie dokie.”
Sam had also spoken to a few therapists that he felt he could recommend in his honest opinion to come work there. He had met a few through Sam and had felt a closeness to them, whenever they spoke of their passion for helping others and being a support system.
Peter groaned aloud and slouched his shoulders. “I swear he’s out to end me Mr. Stark. Seriously, every paper that I have submitted to him has at the most gotten a C+ and I don’t know why. I have done the prompt. I have gone to writing labs and I even took my paper to the head of the English department and she said I should have received an A+.”
Tony patted Peter on his back. “I’m glad to hear that. Well Steve and I are off to ride more rides and win more prizes from children.”
“Hardly would let you receive all the credit for my corruption. I was in the army Tony. I have no idea where the world gets off on me being a virgin,” Steve laughed.
Tucking one leg under his bottom, Rhodey leaned forward and spoke softly just so that his words wouldn’t travel to Tony. “No, you’re not. I mean the man goes off to Harvard without a word and Tony after that was just…well distraught for a while. They didn’t exactly leave off being buddies. Now suddenly he’s back. I mean sure reunions or whatnot. And I mean I know he had a crush on Tony. That was obvious every time we would come down to visit.”
Tony had ended his weekly visits, but still kept on sending gifts and checking in. But he couldn’t go there and see Miles and know that he couldn’t keep him. He definitely wasn’t fit enough to be a father and he shouldn’t get Miles’ or his hopes up that he ever would be able to adopt him. There would be some family who eventually came and saw Miles’ bright face and decide to want to bring him into their home. Tony clenched his jaw at the thought of someone taking his Miles…his bambino.
Isa easily handed it over to Natasha and succeeding in not glowing at the fact that she managed to get Natasha to sign. Of course she was more than positive it was mainly due to her closeness to Tony and her own understanding of the documents.
Tony picked at the blueberry muffin and began eating. Natasha went to grab her own muffin and began taking out the ingredients to start making breakfast for the team. She set the things on the expansive island in the center of the kitchen, eyes stealthily checking to make sure Tony was still fine. She would never admit it to him aloud, but those first few weeks after Steve, Bucky, and Clint came back from the Raft she was worried about Tony.
Tony’s brows furrowed. He rested his head against Ryder’s shoulder as he rubbed Tony’s shoulder. Tony shook his head.
Bruce’s presence was so silent that Steve had even forgotten that he was still in the kitchen. Steve went to the refrigerator like intended and grabbed some apple juice and poured it into a cup, which he gave to Miles.
“And ma…there’s been so much that went wrong. But I’m trying. I’m trying and I need you to give me strength. Speak to me and tell me how to love without feeling like I’m going to do something wrong. Because I can’t live without him…”
Steve stopped for a moment to clear his throat. “And so I kept being cold and I kept waking up feeling like this wasn’t the time I was supposed to be in. People kept wanting me to adapt quickly and be Captain America as though no time had passed.”
After his call ended with Cali, Steve immediately gathered the Avengers around him. He sent Peter and Miles to Pepper and told her to watch after them. The two had followed albeit a bit slower, not truly wanting to leave after hearing Tony’s voice. Steve was certain Harley would be disappointed that he hadn’t gotten the chance to hear Tony.
“You may say that, but I’m always going to worry about you…have since you decided you wanted to eat fifty lollipops to see if it honestly takes the same amount of licks to get to the center of different tootsie pops.”
Panic took ahold of his body and Tony felt it wrap tightly around his chest, forcing air out of his lungs. The edges of his eyesight became blurred and he could no longer differentiate who was standing in front of him, hands outstretched to touch Tony. He pushed the hands away, when they came close enough to clear up in his vision.
“You fucking sick bastard,” Steve rasped out, hands coming to rest thickly on the junction between shoulder and neck on Isak. “You’d be a fool to think I would ever let you near Tony.”
Fury shook his head. “No, Ryder’s body was nearly unidentifiable. We only know that it was Ryder because Isak, the brother, woke up and identified him.”
Bucky turned the stove on low and wiped his hands on his pants. “Alright, all the food is ready. You just have to set up the table and maybe clean yourself up a bit. I’ll take the little kids here and take our portions to go.”
“No, you wanted to know so that’s that. So just stop. Stop with the whole questions and I need therapy. Because I’ve been going, but I’m not a fucking head case. And could you just imagine seeing that in the news? Headline: After providing counsel for the Tony Stark, the therapist has to go find her own therapist.”
Eva looked disturbed for a brief second, before breaking out laughing under the impression that her husband was merely exaggerating as he often did when he complained about having to work with the snobs in his job. “Oh, Isak do not be so serious. Was he this serious as a child?”
A chill went through his body as he imagined Ryder deflecting his anger onto Miles. The night at the Gala had come the closet and he would be lying if he said he wasn’t reconsidering his relationship at that very moment. No one would dare lay a hand on his son. He would kill them first.
“And what are you trying to imply?” Isak said, mouth pursing into a thin line. “What is the meaning of dredging up this painful history? Do you wish to cause me to go down memory lane of one of the most awful instances of my life?”
There he was met with the rest of the Avengers, minus Tony of course who was back at the Tower entertaining some children from Karen’s and hanging with the boys. Clint locked the door behind him and went to stand behind Bruce, whose skin was verging on a dangerous green.
And Mrs. Frederick was amazing. He had met her, before the school year began and one could truly tell how much she loved teaching and how much she cared for her students.
Steve shook his head and brought Tony close to him. Tony fell into the embrace rather quickly, readily seeking to absorb the warmth that Steve offered. Tony turned his face toward Steve’s chest, refusing to meet his gaze.
“You’re not lying to me right?” Ryder said raising his body up to bring himself closer to Tony. His hand rested on Tony’s hip and he used it to draw him closer. “Because I was pretty sure your whole day was cleared off. Remember we both decided we would take the today off to just relax in bed?”
“Yes, you have. Don’t lie to me,” Ryder said looking back to the bracelet hanging on Tony’s wrist. “You responded so well to me this time.”
“Help?” Ryder said eyes turning off the road. “You think I need help? I don’t need anyone’s fucking help. What I need is for you to shut the fuck up.”
“What the hell do you think you’re doing Ryder? Are you insane? No, you are and I’m just noticing it,” Tony hissed. “I don’t know what type of sick game you’re trying to play, but I am not a player in it. I highly suggest you give me my things and watch me leave.”
He first caught on to that when he saw the split lip that Peter was sporting and the bruise beginning to blossom on Harley’s chin. Flash meanwhile had his shirt torn and a small cut above his eye. Harley straightened his shoulders defiantly and Peter seemed to shrink in on himself as his eyes caught on Tony’s.
Steve had been saving this sonnet to include in his vows and sure Steve was thinking ahead, but he could only hope. Even as the years passed by and his relationship with Tony grew, there was this ever growing desire to continuously love and to be loved by Tony. Despite his mom’s instructions of love and everything it encompassed, he hadn’t truly known what it felt like until Tony.
Ryder tsked as Tony made a choking sound. “Oh calm down. Tony’s not giving me a blowjob…though I can say that he awfully looks good on his knees. I was surprised to find out you hadn’t rendered his services yet. But don’t worry he’s only being served the greatest liquor this limo has to offer. Oh Cali he’s chocking. Tilt his head back and make sure he catches every single drop.”
“Aren’t you two coming in? I know Peter will be happy to see you two and Harley and Miles are always excited of course. I know we didn’t go to the bakery, but I think there may be some leftover cookies that Thor made, if you all were just craving something sweet.”
Miles pushed back at the covers angrily and nodded. He crossed his arms over his tiny body and stared at Tony.
Bucky’s eyes grew bright and his facial expression took on this dark and mysterious look of amusement. “Isak told Fury he would do everything he could to make sure things were cleared up. He’s being brought in by SHIELD in five days.”
Miriam shrugged. “Or we can just release the camera shots. Playboy Tony back in action,” Miriam announced loudly forcing the alcohol down Tony’s throat again. Miriam hummed in the back of her throat and watched on with glee as Tony could barely keep his head up straight.
Winston gave him a look that seemed so innocent as though he didn’t understand why Tony didn’t want this.
Before he was able to even think about making his way to the window, he could hear the excited chatter of Miles. The door opened and he let out a relieved sigh. Peter came in holding a flailing Miles, followed by Harley.
Ryder refused him and even pressed his hips harsher against Tony’s chest. He rocked his hips forward pushing his cock deeper into Tony’s mouth. Ryder let out a pleased moan as Tony chocked and gasped for breath every time he would pull out.
Miles laughed and Tony immediately snatched Miles from Steve’s hands. “That is not funny Miles! You could have gotten hurt and broken something. You cannot fly bambino. You also should not climb on anything that is taller than you. You could get yourself killed and then…”
Bruce looked at Tony and Clint huddled together and shook his head. Tony sent a bright smile to Bruce.
A soft smile lit her features as she toyed with the blanket resting on her lap. “I’m doing much better. Everything that Tony has done for me has been so beneficial that I may leave here healthier than I’ve ever been.”
He hadn’t noticed until now, but all three of them were laughing. Karen’s face was bright with joy and she waved at the two.
Tony’s eyes widened as May leaned back into her chair. Looking at Tony she shrugged and resumed paying attention to the video.
Steve made a noise. “She’s decent, but I have two trained assassins questioning her right now and to be frank if she doesn’t give us any information soon, we’ll be forced to take measures we would much rather not. Though I am sure, we can reach some type of agreement that will secure your sister’s safety that is if she means to you what Tony means to me.”
He knew it was selfish to think that he was the only hero who Miles admired. He couldn’t exactly monitor the teenage volunteers’ stories of the mighty Avengers. Even though the rhetoric had changed to take in the fact that they were still exiled, until recently, the volunteers regaled the children with the times they fought cohesively as one unit.
He yearned to have them here with him and maybe he wouldn’t need Ryder as much. Maybe then he’d have people he could at least pretend to want him, but wouldn’t cause him to go into work feeling bruised and not able to sit down at conference meetings. However, he should be thankful he has Ryder who he doesn’t have to pretend with. He knows what he was getting himself into with Ryder. He needed to be thankful.
“Yeah, you’re right. Guess I’ll just have to take more snapshots of these moments, before our kids get too old for us,” Steve said, leaning over to kiss Tony on the cheek.
“Ah, give me my favorite Stark,” Pepper announced reaching her hands out to Miles, who was now slumped over the lunch basket. Rhodey passed Miles over. “He doesn’t let me hold him as much as I used to. Apparently he thinks he’s a big boy now.”
He led the others to the table and they all sat down. Miles who had been sitting on Natasha’s lap went to sit on Tony’s lap. Tony watched all of them with a smile on his face. This, this is what he had been waiting for and wanting. It had taken some time to get there and they still had a long way to go, but here they all were.
So why shouldn’t Tony enjoy this affection, at least for the little bit of time he would receive it.
Steve followed him and quickly closed the door behind him. All of the others were in the room, in the same spots that Tony had left them. No one dared say a word, waiting to see what Tony would do next.
Steve forced his body to stop the warm spread of heat travel this his body as Tony’s breath ghosted across his jawline.
“Isn’t it though. Look at me and tell me honestly that you never loved me,” Ryder said smugly. “In all that pain, there was pleasure mixed in it. Happiness, even. You were always so soft and kind for me. Can’t claim you’re a victim, if you love me.”
Steve’s mind went to Harley. He didn’t know when Tony would be coming back and maybe he could help Harley to see his mom more than once a week. “What would it take to foster a kid?”
Bucky raised an eyebrow in question. “I know my memories may still be a little scattered, but I do distinctly remember the knowledge that you don’t know how to cook.”
Steve began to feel the confidence settle in his shoulders. He had a long way to go, but he was certain that at the end of the day Tony felt the same or at least a little bit of what Steve was feeling. After all if his feelings weren’t even slightly returned, Tony would have somewhat kindly told Steve to leave his lab.
Tony’s eyes widened in the dark, heart freezing in his chest at the confession. After only officially dating for about four months, they hadn’t said those three words. They were intent that after everything they take their time and start from the beginning. Tony hadn’t wanted to rush into anything so soon, after finally washing his hands clean of Ryder.
Tony pushed back at Steve’s chest. Steve allowed some space between the two. Tony looked back at Steve.
Peter nodded his head. “Yeah, like if Aunt May just told me something like that I would be devastated. I’m sure your mom would understand.”
And so they set out to build it, a mixture of actually building it, throwing blocks at one another, joking around, and taking turns to bringing snacks into the lab.
Bucky suddenly gathered Steve into his arms and felt the tremors shake Steve’s shoulders. Steve turned his face into Bucky’s neck. He tried reigning in his sobs, but Bucky wouldn’t have it. With a soothing voice, Bucky told Steve to not hold it in anymore.
“Well, how about we have them come here tomorrow instead? It’s not like I have anything particularly planned,” Tony announced, handing a block over to Sam. “Also Miles will be here, since I’m back home now and it’ll be his first day back. Oh, and Harley too of course.”
“Look Steve it’s not your fault. It’s not Tony’s fault. It’s mine. I knew I had a wife and kids at home that needed me. I just didn’t prioritize my family over my job or my supposed duty to my friends. I should have said no when you called,” Clint told Steve.
Isak hummed lowly in the back of his throat. He looked down briefly, before turning his direct attention back to Steve. He licked the corners of his lips and brought his cuffed hands to wipe at the moisture lying there.
“I know, but…it’s just Ms. Natasha put me in charge to make sure you kind of stayed here,” Julie whispered. “I can’t fail.”
“You and your sweet tooth. How about we go get something to eat with the closest nutritional value,” Tony offered up.
Tony shot out of bed. “Oh! Now you have to tell me what dame you had going after you. Who knew? Bet you met at the dock and gave her some flowers or something.”
“Hi?” Tony said confusedly, stepping a little closer. “I didn’t miss a birthday or something, did I? Your birthday already passed and crap…no our anniversary was three months ago? Wait…Steve I knew I’d forget something.”
Cali looked at him sadly. “You can’t, but I know you can’t trust them even more. I don’t like doing this line of work and I can’t let them hurt you like this. You don’t deserve it.”
Tony dug out his phone and handed it to Peter who then gave it to Miles. Tony sat in the chair beside Harley and nodded his head as Mrs. Thompson who was cooing over her son. Flash seemed to preen at the attention and Tony didn’t mistake the glint of mischief in that kids’ eyes.
“I thought you were straight,” Steve rasped out, pulling his chair closer to Isak. “I didn’t know straight guys could get…physically turned on by pictures of guys.”
Steve didn’t bother turning around to say sharply, “You’re right. It’s going to take time and he will not be the same as he was.”
“Sorry, I was going to call you and tell them you were here, but then I figured you were on your way home pretty soon so,” Ryder said to him and looked at the kid in Tony’s arms.
Ryder scrunched up his face at Tony’s suggestion. “Oh, Tony. I hate that you think you’ve been placed in a situation where you can make suggestions.”
Then when Steve and Bucky came back from wherever they were he observed Steve’s eyes brighten as he sat in front of where Tony was sitting. Bucky sat beside Steve and looked up as Tony poked Bucky’s arms talking about all the new designs he was working on, while his hand ran through Steve’s hair.
Bruce, Thor, Sam, Wanda, and Vision all came in. Thor was seen pushing a cart that had three different Lego sets on it. Tony raised an eyebrow in question as Thor brought it in front of him.
Nick looked at all of them who had various degrees of confusion, anger, and shame expressed on their faces.
A brief flash of regret passed her eyes, but Natasha refused to waver especially right now. “I did, but not to the point of Ryder being Mr. Mean Bad One. I thought he was cheating or something, but then I found nothing so I dropped it.  But still get in touch with them and let them know.”
“Just talk to me sweetheart,” Steve replied back, wrapping his arms tightly against. “We can figure out the rest as we go, together.”
Tony looked away, then back to Steve testing the honesty in his expression. Steve probably didn’t mean what he was saying. The nurses probably told them all to be nice to the patient and not to rile him up so much. It was all conditional.
“So not only do you take my food, you want to talk about my height. I will not suffer under these conditions,” Tony said slitting his eyes at Steve. “Go get your own.”
Steve picked up the folder and opened it up, breathing harshly through his noise before turning one picture to Isak. Natasha took a sharp intake of breath and Bucky crack his knuckles.
Tears flowed freely down Steve’s cheeks and his lips trembled. “Nat I’ve lost him. I’ve truly lost him.”
“Fine, our funnel cake,” Tony laughed. “And don’t think I won’t notice if you give me the smaller piece.”
Steve tried nine more times, before sighing frustrated. Steve looked back at Tony. “Why are you laughing? I am trying to get in concentration mode.”
All of a sudden, laughter whelmed inside of Tony and tumbled outside of his lips. Bright tears poured out of his eyes and he struggled to control the gasps that accompanied the peals of laughter.  Natasha looked all too entirely pleased with herself as her shoulder bumped into Tony’s.
“So where’s Miles? I mean I came here for all the children, but I wanted to check up on him and see how he’s doing.”
Also I made some update schedule changes for the next three chapters. For my "I apologize in advance for many tears shed" 3 part series
“I’m so tired Steve,” Tony confessed against his chest. “I just want to have one night of sleep, without waking up. I don’t want to take any more sleeping pills…I just want to sleep on my own and not have him there waiting for me in my dreams.”
The faces went so fast before all of them that no one would even know how to recall a particular face.
After the conversation he had with Tony, he was pretty certain that he was the reason for Tony’s bad dreams. Talking about everything in the past year probably brought everything up to the surface for Tony. He didn’t want to be reminders of a terrible past for Tony.
Sam narrowed his eyes at Bucky. “No, maybe that’s the thunder you’re thinking of. Maybe you’re losing control of your powers Thor. Might happen in old age.”
As they began to pack their bags to head back to the hotel, Tony peered at the letter again. He passed a garbage can and wondered if he should throw it away and pretend he never saw it. His hand hovered near the trashcan. However, his fingers would not let the letter go. Tony folded the letter and placed it in his basket.
Harley smiled shyly and immediately got up. He grabbed a change of clothes and nearly ran to the group bathroom. Steve turned up getting ready to leave and ran into Natasha. Natasha didn’t even try to hide the fact that she had been eavesdropping. She simply followed into step with Steve on his way to Karen’s office.
He woke to two hands moving in circles under his knees. He raised a hand to push at the hands, but was stopped in his movement. He blinked his eyes several times before he saw two figures sitting on the bed beside him. One man and one woman. With his heart in his chest, he tried pulling away.
“Kill him,” Clint choked leaning forward. “What…is that something that we need to be concerned about?”
“Then why are you leaving me,” Tony said eyes bright with tears as he looked up at Steve. “Why are you leaving me? I told you I needed you all. I told you I needed you here. I need you here. Is that what you need? Do you need to hear that no matter how things are still rocky I still need you here…as my friend.”
“Don’t worry about that. You stay wherever you are right now. I’ll meet you in an hour,” Cali commented, not allowing Steve to respond before she hung up. Cali went to where Tony had fallen asleep and pulled the covers up to his neck.
“I hate the cold. Like I truly hate it. After 70 years submersed in cold water, it would seem like I would get used to it, that it would become like some sort of second skin. It never did. When I first woke up, besides feeling disoriented from being in a different time, I felt cold,” Steve told him.
“So why aren’t you answering any of his calls?” Peter inquired shifting in his seat so he could look at Tony. “He’s been trying to reach you almost every hour since we left the school.”
Ryder set his phone down and smiled. He had seen his past actions and knew what he needed to do. He had already prided himself on being a fast learner. And he certainly had no patience in the desire to see Tony’s destruction.
“Hey, it’s Ryder. I wanted to know if you were ever able to get in touch with Tony,” Ryder questioned.
He didn’t know exactly what he wanted, but it wasn’t this. He had spent most of his life trying to stay out of unhealthy relationships. His relationship with the Avengers was the epitome of an unhealthy relationship (at least according to Pepper) and he shouldn’t want to go back. He shouldn’t want Steve to tell him about how much he messed up. He shouldn’t want Clint to yell at him for breaking up him and his family. He shouldn’t want them to blame him.
Tony looked up at him through hazed eyes and smiled. “You know I think someone promised me a cheeseburger? I think that was you Cap. So how about we blow this Popsicle stand and leave. I promise I won’t tell anyone you’re my accomplice. Also how does my face look? Your grasp on my hand was pretty tight, so I couldn’t leave to go to the restroom, which by the way is kind of far. But you know I’m perfectly fine, so I don’t even know what the hassle is, every single nurse checking on me. Also hello boundaries? Though Helen provided nice eye candy in this otherwise dismal place, I need to leave.”
Julie walked to them pulling on her coat. “I’m coming with you. Come on Harley,” she commanded grabbing Harley’s hand in hers.
Sorry, I have no other excuse than I got the little procrastination bug. Hopefully, 13k word chapter made up for it. Also I couldn't get all of Tony's past with Ryder during college in one chapter, so we'll be continuing that in next chapter as well and then we'll get to his last part of his talk with Steve :)
“You don’t need them as your family. Tony we’re your family. Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, Peter, your soon to be adopted kid. You don’t need this in your life,” Rhodey pleaded.
“I would like it for it to go into the rules that this winged creature, who is without wings be silenced while I present my building. I was silent during yours, I would like to be given the same courtesy,” Thor said, pushing away at Sam’s shoulder.
“I do understand this, but you all know that if we hold him any longer Eva is going to get suspicious. Things will be eventually tied back to us and we can’t afford that to happen. I’m only saying what needs to be done,” Fury said.
“I meant to tell you, but then I forgot. Don’t look at me like that Pep. We’ve been out in the sun for like three hours and it has drained me,” Rhodey defended. “But yes we’ll take the delivery. Tell Natasha we said thank you.”
“I know that Rhodey. I was their when Zemo showed us that Golden Globe’s worthy film,” Tony sneered. “But how would me keeping this anger and unforgiving nature in me helpful? How would anyone want to stay around me, if I can’t let go of my anger toward them, huh? Please tell me.”
Thankfully, Ryder pulled back and leaned forward to speak in hushed tones to the driver. Cali turned worried eyes at Tony. Their eyes met and Tony hoped he could convey a desire to leave into his eyes. He hated to plead. He hated to ask for help, but he needed it. He just needed her to reach for his wrist and push…
He hated to admit it, but even now months later sometimes the feel of someone being this close was a little stifling. He was doing better, but sometimes it was hard to adjust. Steve was always understanding of him needing space, but damn it all if Tony just wanted to get through one night of sleep without waking up Steve and making him concerned.
The Avengers was on the mends or at least trying to be on the mends, but he didn’t know if he could fix the Barton family.
He retraced his steps letting his previous statement of, “Leads me to wonder what exactly else you are hiding” fade away, in favor of asking, “So why did you follow your brother into that car? What made it worth going after him, after all of the trouble he has caused for you and your family.”
“He is not to be trusted. I have half the mind that if you were to ask him anything in regards to the location he would activate his kill switch over jeopardizing his loyalty with Ryder,” Cali said.
“I’ve been having the papers ready for you to sign since the second month of you coming here,” Karen admitted warmly. “I think…I know you will be a wonderful father to Miles.”
“My whole family took her into our homes, into our hearts. He became serious and reserved. We all figured this was him becoming mature. He was finally growing into a respectable young man. They stayed together for seven years,” she said.
Everyone minus Steve had the decency to look ashamed and bury their faces back into their packets. Meanwhile Steve stared stone faced at Isa. Despite the stoniness of Steve’s expression, Isa continued on.
Steve grabbed another bowl of soup, seeing as how the one Tony had been eating was empty. He had heard Tony’s stomach growl. Tony had waved him off saying he was fine, but Steve knew that whenever Tony’s body loudly admitted that it was hungry Tony really needed to get food or he would be found slumped over his work bench.
“Yeah. Haven’t really felt motivated to shave,” he announced, whispering softly enough so that Tony wouldn’t have to feel like he had to move. “Is it too much?”
Tony frowned at him. “He doesn’t get to me. He hasn’t said anything that anyone hasn’t said before.”
He opened his eyes to mouth a thank you to Steve who had returned to putting away groceries. Steve mouthed you’re welcome. Moments later the two returned to putting away groceries and Tony made sure that this time Miles stayed either attached to his hip or seated at the kitchen table. Once the two were satisfied with the placement of the groceries, Tony made a quick lunch for them.
He wished he could take out some of the pleading, but he couldn’t. He didn’t want to be alone in the kitchen right then and there. He just needed the presence of somebody and if that somebody was Steve then so be it.
“Is this because of Steve?” Ryder questioned spitefully. “How many times do I have to get it into your supposed genius brain that he will never love you? You think him coming back after leaving you is a sign of love? I am going to make you love me and only me, once you realize that I’m all you have.”
Shaking himself of those thoughts for a moment, he had to blink away the tears that were surfacing. Tony had to center himself back to where he was in this tiny makeshift fort where three of the most precious kids were still lying asleep.
“And this is my baba…wait no my dad…wait no it’s Mr. Stark. I…this is Mr. Stark. I totally don’t call you baba or dad in my head. Or aloud! Like because that would be weird and like yeah I don’t do that. I just heard Miles calling you baba and like unconsciously…you know? Umm, can we just like redo this? This is Mr. Stark, but you all obviously already know that.”
Sharon looked down at her hands and sighed. She placed a lock of her hair behind her ear and looked at Steve.
“Hmmm,” Peter hummed in the back of his throat and began to play with the a frayed piece of his sweater.
Tony didn’t smile, but his eyes had lost a little bit of that deep-rooted sadness. Clint smiled and let his body melt against the wall. He felt drained and all the same energized to get back his whole family a family that included Tony. Maybe he should have stopped separating his family and realized that Tony shared the same importance in his life as Laura and the kids.
Ryder gave a few calming breaths. Every time he thought of that day…the beginning of it all he grew upset. That had started something inside of him that tainted his soul. When he went to Harvard, he was ostracized. Apparently news had gotten around that he had been fired by Mr. Stark because of something scandalous. Rumors flew around and then reports of his past started circulating. Ryder had to study abroad in South Africa just to get away from it all.
Bucky tilted his head to the side in confusion. “How is it that I was brainwashed for years and I still know the rules of the kitchen. Steve!”
Harley raised his legs and propped his chin on his knees. He face his head to the door and tried to discreetly wipe away tears that were falling. Peter meanwhile let his fall freely, tears catching onto his chin before falling onto his lap.
All Tony wanted to do was leave the comfort of this bed and curl up into his closet to hide. He wanted to submerse himself in that darkness in hopes that it could silence the thousand thoughts whirring through his brain.
“This isn’t fair. Why would he do this to me?” Tony asked the two of them. “I didn’t ask for Steve to love me. He can’t love me.”
Before he could further question himself, his eyes latched onto a movement. Turning his head down, he saw that it was Tony who had switched positions.
His heart leapt in his chest and he tried reminding himself he wasn’t some young teenager experiencing his first crush. But here he was getting all messed up simply because of a handhold. Steve grew closer to him, his thump repeatedly drawing circles in the skin between Tony’s thumb and index finger.
“52 days,” Ryder exclaimed giddily. “It’s been 52 days, since we’ve been together and they haven’t found you. Probably realized their resources were better spent elsewhere. So sad, is it not? You give your all to them and they don’t even give you an inch. I’m sure that if your precious Steve had gone missing they would have find him at the most within three days.”
“Mr. Tony, now this is a very time sensitive,” Julie began, but was stopped by the sound of his phone vibrating.
Steve tilted Tony’s head so that he could face him. “Was Howard the main reason you two were you know distancing yourself, at least from Ryder’s part?”
“Oh give me grace,” Steve whispered as Tony’s head fell to his lap. Steve’s hands hovered slightly over Tony’s head where it was resting on his lap. Deciding that Tony was well into sleep, he began running his fingers through the strands that were beginning to become longer and curled at the nape of his neck.
The bell chimed above the door and all three of them stepped inside. Steve walked in the store moving between different customers who were all looking around trying to buy different things. A few people stopped and stared as they realized who exactly was in the building. Thankfully, no one bothered to take pictures of them.
“Okay, cool. I’ll come with you. Just let me freshen up real quick and we can go,” Clint said. “I’m tired of being in this house all day and I need a break.”
Ryder looked at him now completely unclothed and motioned him to come to the bed. On shaky legs Tony walked over to the bed and sat down on it. He tried covering himself, but Ryder shook his head.
Even with the room being dark it seemed to only grow darker. He felt like he wasn’t there in his body. He felt disjointed and fragmented from himself. He had no control. He couldn’t even allow himself to let the tears fall from his eyes.
Tony pretended to be disgusted as the two kids kept peppering him with kisses, but he was secretly delighted. Who was he to stop coming to his weekly visits? Ryder couldn’t keep him from the orphanage in fear that his heart would grow too big and he would want to adopt.
Apparently he said this aloud because Clint snorted. “Of course and we should plan things on your own term?”
“But you are hurting me. You let this happen. If you love me, you wouldn’t do this,” Tony said laboriously that sentence taking every little bit of energy he had. His eyes fluttered close and his breath became low and even.
“Now go, go. Fall into a wonderful Hallmark movie romance, not a lifetime one. I will be very disappointed if you try wooing my sister-in-law Miranda with a lifetime romance plot. Understood?”
“I don’t know,” Tony grit out. “Can we stop with the 21 questions? We’re not blushing teenagers in high school anymore.”
“Aye, man of iron we have come to the conclusion that you must judge which Lego building is the most wondrous to your eye,” Thor explained. “I would like to proclaim that mine is the best fitting toward your test. I have created the most desirable building across all of the galaxies. Loki would attest to this, seeing as how he gave a few suggestions.”
Ryder grit his teeth together and grounded out, “You’ve been marching around and playing house with Steve. You think I haven’t seen the photos of you and Steve at the winter carnival or you and Steve with Miles at the grocery store. Or how about the time you and Steve were seen running together? And here you’re just glued to him at the hip as though you’re ready at any moment to drop to your knees and obey your captain.”
“Yeah, we were seeing how long it would be for you to spring Tony out of the hospital. We all gave you the maximum four weeks, until we stepped in and sprung him ourselves,” Bucky hinted teasingly. “But how’s he doing?”
Julie watched all of this with unbridled amusement, knowing that she should probably step in, but she was just enjoying it so much. It was Karen who eventually decided that enough was quite enough.
Clint pressed a hand against his heart and then pressed it against his forehead. “Why must you be so cruel to me?”
After a series of meetings, Tony was so thankful that Rhodey was meeting up with Pepper and himself for lunch. He needed a break from that lot of annoying business people. Sometimes he really wanted to just fire them. He’d have to ask Pepper about that a little later.
So Tony knew that the threat of picking him up would serve its purpose. The two walked slower and if it was because Tony wanted to drag out the walk to give him time to gather his thoughts…well no one would be the wiser. When they reached the living area, Tony scanned the room to find everyone already sitting down patiently waiting for Tony’s arrival.
“Why don’t we have Tony come talk to me and decide for himself whether or not I am the man I say I am. After all, he is the one who spent the most time with Ryder. He is quite possibly the only one who can decide whether or not I am who I say I am, which I do.”
“You don’t think I changed?” Ryder implored, pressing his foot on the gas a little more. “The years have treated me with favor and perhaps I have grown.”
Tony walked back to Ryder and placed his hand in his. “Alright kids play nice. Don’t break anything at the Tower. I am especially talking about you Thor and Loki. I swear.”
“Man, I should have brought a jacket,” Clint said while rubbing his arms. His teeth clattered and he tried drawing closer to Natasha, hoping she would take pity on him and give her the extra blanket she had stored in her bag.
“Look I didn’t call you with the intention of making you upset or making you cry. I just wanted to remind you that it’s okay to take time toward forgiveness. You don’t have to forgive them all in a day, a week, or hell even a year. You don’t have to feel rushed Tones,” Rhodey whispered softly.
“Trouble? Oh, it’s sweet that you are so concerned.” The woman smirked. “Honestly Jack, I have seen better. How much do you think we’ll get for him?”
Tony leaned away from Steve and Steve allowed him to put some distance between them. Tony pinched the bridge of his nose and knelt beside Miles.
Tony’s hand rested on the back of Steve’s neck, pulling him closer. Steve broke away from Tony’s lips to begin its descent on Tony’s neck. Tony’s fingers tightened around Steve’s neck and released with each breath against his neck.
“I was supposed to get rid of Hydra. I was supposed to keep Bucky from falling off of that train. I was supposed to stay in the 30s. I was supposed to die in that ice. If it hadn’t been for me and this stupid serum, your parents would still be alive. Your parents’ death and many others happened because of me. My serum success story is the reason there are people creating super soldiers. My greed made Bucky into the Winter Soldier and made Hydra conceive plans to kill your parents.”
“Oh, he’s Tony Stark. We could easily rake in a lot of money. I’m almost offended that Ryder chose to hole up this amount of cash in these walls.  Just think if we took him right now.”
“Ryder,” she said slowly. Just as she was connecting the dots, a man entered the living area carrying a small toddler on his hip.
“A broken collarbone for falling weirdly at the skating rink. My brother hated skating. She said that she wanted to take him there to get him out his comfort zone. So I believed her. Then he fractured his wrist slamming into a wall accidentally not even four weeks later. He didn’t say anything.”
“How long are you going to be in the lab?” Peter questioned his mouth already full with a bite of his sandwich. “Because I know you have no concept of time.”
Tony laughed at Steve’s affronted look. “Alright Jaime I think you’ve hurt his feelings enough. Let me have a try.”
“I realized that, when mom started getting really sick Jack would start taking my sister with him on his trips back home, while mom was in the hospital. But CPS was called and so here I’ve been shifting through group homes back and back.”
Steve couldn’t calm the thrumming of his heartbeat underneath his chest. He couldn’t quite manage the ability to cease his mind’s thoughts about who was currently occupying the interrogation room. He had tried to stop his train of thoughts from wrapping his hands around the neck that provided breath for that man to continue to lie.
Tony distanced himself from Ryder. Miles stared at Ryder and wrapped his plump arms around Tony’s neck. Tony hoisted Miles further up on his hip and looked silently. Ryder’s eyes widened and he clenched his jaw from the pure disrespect that kid had just shown him.
None of them vocally admitted that they hadn’t agreed with Fury’s offer, but Steve could see it in their faces.
Steve nodded. All of them waited tensely as Thor went to go retrieve the visitor. When he came back, he was met with a young woman who bore a striking resemblance to Miriam. The two could nearly go as twins. Her face was sunken in as though she had experienced great trouble and she was wringing her hands together in obvious discomfort. Her eyes kept flitting around the room settling on the various individuals.
“No, because I do not like any of you. You all made baba cry. So I don’t want to color with you,” Miles announced to everyone. “No good colors for bad people.”
Steve grew amazed at Tony’s speechlessness. He was hoping that the gift would be well received, but Tony not being able to form a coherent sentence was unexpected.
“First of all Miles is never going into my line of business. I’m already training him to be a professional artist. All those coloring books are a part of my master plan,” Tony admitted.
He was hoping that Tony would just let him leave and not make him answer these questions. He was hoping that Tony would appreciate the distance, so that he could actually recover.
The three of them remained silent for a few moments, before Tony suggested that they watch some TV. They settled into watch some cooking show on Food Network. Peter leaned on the bed placing his head by Tony’s lap where Miles hand was hanging off of. He rested his head on his arms. Harley did the same, choosing to grab ahold of Iron Bear and use it as a head rest.
Tony had recently relocated to the main floor so Miles would have easier access to things around him and wouldn’t have to rely on the elevator so much.
Steve laughed softly as he remembered Natasha screaming, “Fucking useless idiot” to Clint when he announced that he had accidentally sent Laura some flowers that had wilted and died.
Steve wondered briefly why Tony would be having conversations with his intern. Had he had this close of a relationship with other interns? Steve racked his brain trying to find out, but knew that Tony rarely ever took on any interns for himself. He said they needed to gain work experience not the Tony experience.
“It’s nothing short of some obsession. Ryder was obsessed with the destruction that Tony seemingly caused him and at some point he truly loved him. He felt betrayed that someone he loved would ruin his life, take away his opportunity of great scientific discovery. But for a few years he forgot. That obsession had dwindled down to just a fading interest, but then someone called him saying that Tony was alone after the Accords.”
The hair on Peter’s arms stood still and he felt he couldn’t shake this weirds feeling. So looking around he noticed that Miles had left his seat and took out his earphones to ask where he was going. When he looked up to see Miles about to chew a piece of orange gum, he quickly ran over and grabbed Miles.
Tony had muffled his cries in his towel as he sank to his bathroom floor. He cried in sorrow for feeling like he had lost something and then he also cried because of the sheer relief he felt. He had never known how much he had wanted Ryder’s presence not only gone from his home, but also gone everywhere.
“I’ll be back in a few minutes,” he whispered to Steve, not caring that Steve wouldn’t even be awake to notice his absence.
He wanted to ask, when. He wanted to know how long into their relationship it was, before Ryder decided to…
Steve looked down at the nurse. “I know, but you see I wasn’t really asking for permission to leave. So as much as I appreciate you following your procedure, I think I know Tony better than the rest of all of you. That means I know he needs a break from this hospital room he’s been kept in. But look I promise to have him back here within three hours and I’ll even tell you where we’re going.”
Harley shifted under the serious gaze directed at him and turned to explain. “Honestly, Mr. Stark I’m not even sure why we are here. Flash and I just got into a little scuffle and Pete here tried helping out. Nothing really worth noting.”
“You think you love Steve. You think that you love your team, the little family you have built. But this team won’t come for you. After all, it was you who called them and not them who called you on our way here. Makes me wonder if they truly cared whether you had left,” Ryder exclaimed pressing his fingertips in the space at Tony’s collarbone.
“Steve, how many times must I tell you to call me Bekah? Surely, you don’t want to upset a patient,” Bekah addressed. “Now sit down you’re making my neck hurt having to look up at you. Goodness, just built like a tree. Trust me, if I weren’t married…”
“Oh, I am sorry if I thought that is what you wanted to ask. I apologize if I have offended you in any manner,” Isak said, slowly trying to breathe roughly through his mouth. “Did you instead wish to ask me if I was a part of my brother’s CMPNY. The answer to that is no.”
Karen rolled her eyes. “You don’t even know the half of it. After snack time, is when she starts using her best materials.”
“Tony we’ve talked about this. I asked if you wanted to bring Miles, but you said you didn’t want to. I already told my parents we were coming.”
Tony closed his eyes and waited for Ryder to leave. When he was gone, he surveyed his body quickly and stared at the purple patches. He spat out the pill that Ryder had fed him, which he had been hiding under his tongue. After he was done, he was drained. Ryder would at least be gone until the end of the day. If he got just a little rest without the pill and without the patches, he could maybe wake up and figure out a way out of this hellhole.
Also quick question I've been trying to figure out. Should Peter eventually transition to calling Tony: baba, dad, Uncle Tony, Tony (with Aunt May's permission of course) or just stay with Mr. Stark? 'Cause I don't know yet lol.
“Did that night at the gala mean nothing to you? Did my confession to you that day you came back from your trip mean nothing to you?” Steve whispered. “I love you Tony. Nothing you say or do is ever going to alter my love for you.
“Good. Hold on just a minute,” Ryder stated, holding up his index finger. He motioned to a woman in blue scrubs. She came closer to him and gave him a friendly kiss on the cheek. “Did they get Carl up to CT yet?”
“Mom says she needs to talk to you,” Harley shrugged. “Don’t know what for, but guess I’ll sit here and wait.”
More laughter and some moving of plates. “Yes, I am fairly sure your aunt would approve of that. No, but maybe I should come to school and see this Michelle person you have been talking awfully about. Yeah, you know what I think that’s what I’ll do.”
Apologies for such a late update, this chapter started at 5 pages and then quickly became 20+ pages. I just wanted all of the expectations I laid out for Ryder's consequences to be the way I promised. Hope it was good for y'all as much as it was for me writing it!
Coulson’s mouth was tense and he kept looking at Tony then back to the floor again. He hadn’t knowm it was that bad. He’d have to retract a lot of what was said from the official document, when it was handed over to the people at the Raft. They didn’t need to know what happened.
Tony’s eyes widened at that. “Please don’t. I don’t need you two giving Steve the shovel talk. Besides I’m not even sure that there is need for a shovel talk.”
“But it all ended amazing,” Tony inserted, remembering the face on Rhodey’s face when he had tossed his twentieth lollipop to the side victoriously and said him and Tony were about to make a huge scientific breakthrough.
Steve strangely felt a sense of Déjà vu and called to mind the time that Tony had woken up from a nightmare and told Steve not to leave.
. Despite what he wanted and hoping he had the greatest intentions, even Steve knew that at first he had come back because he needed a purpose again…he needed to be Captain America.
Ryder waved his hand in the air dismissively. “Isak? That’s a nice name change, probably why it was so hard to find you at first.”
Tony clenched down his body spasmed chasing after a growing release. “Harder,” Tony moaned deeply, nails scratching at Steve’s back leaving a fiery trail in its wake.
The two followed Clint outside of the tower and began their day. They first went to David’s Burger Shack as Clint had hoped and sat down in a booth. Clint sighed and melted into his seat.
“Now send my son back up to me please. I bet he’s wondering what we’re up here talking about and my son is awfully curious,” Bekah laughed.
Karen’s eyes looked concernedly between Miles and Tony. Karen would never dare say anything to Tony right now, but she had always assumed eventually Tony would adopt Miles. Now never say she had ulterior motives for agreeing to let Tony bring Miles home, when she would have never let any other person do the same. But maybe this would bring Tony to the decision he’s clearly been contemplating since he came to her orphanage.
He leaned forward, hands pressed on Ryder’s knees. He dug into the skin there so tight that Ryder wouldn’t notice how his hands hadn’t stopped shaking.
“Peter I have told you mean time you don’t have to refer to me as Mr. Stark. You can call me Tony, the ultimate superhero, or even the greatest genius of all time,” Tony suggested.
“Alright I think Mr. Stark has heard enough of your brilliant singing,” May exclaimed, quickly pulling Tony toward her. “But the program is about to start and we really need to get to our seats.”
“Oh, nothing,” Steve said not willing to lie to Harley. “But she wants you back in her room. I think we have another hour or so of visiting, so go.”
“I suppose he had some success with Tony, huh? Is this why you had me called here? Did you want me to somehow tell him how Ryder loved him and would want him to move on? I am sure that his sudden death would have left a heavy burden on his heart, if they had engaged in a serious relationship. Though I shouldn’t presume they were involved. Tell me Steve, was my brother happy in this relationship should he have been with Tony?”
“Okay, I’ll take on guardianship while you are away. I truly hope you know what you are doing,” Steve implored, waiting for any sign of hesitation. Not seeing one ounce of hesitance, he nodded. “I’m sure you will be the one to inform him.”
Fury on his part managed to look completely gut-wrenched. He wanted to apologize for asking this of Tony, but he knew it was the only way. Now that they had verbal proof, physical proof, and more thanks to Ryder’s need to talk they had the ability to put him away for the rest of his life…however long or short it would be.
“Isak’s wife is with her husband right now,” Fury said. “I just thought you all should know, since you all, as I did, wanted to make sure he got what he deserved. Looks like fate worked in our favor.”
He sobered up. He didn’t remember being unconscious. Then he listened to the other part of Cali’s statement. Ryder had his armor. Granted he wouldn’t really be able to access the suit without his voice command, but the fact still stood that he had it.
Tony immediately did the same. “And a sleepy one at that. I’ve never met someone who sleeps so much.”
“That’s…that’s not okay. None of that was at okay and those events are not preparation for some bigger scale kidnapping event,” Steve asserted. “Those were all awful events that Howard should have prevented. He should have protected you. I can’t believe…I mean four years old and Howard didn’t even care?”
“No, you need someone to take care of him until he’s recovered. I have the resources. I could get him an appointment to make sure everything is fine. Once he’s up to code, I’ll have him back here healthy and ready to go. Unless…I mean you’re right I’m probably not fit to take care of a kid. Probably can’t really take care of myself.”
“Love you and call me if you need anything. I’ll only be at SI so I’m not far. Also I’ll be back tomorrow in the morning probably,” she said.
Steve, Bucky, and Clint all trailed after the guards neither of them comfortable with just leaving him there. They all needed the assurance that he would be in that cell, once they left for good. The guards had told them that the majority of the CMPNY were here in the Raft and the other lesser offences had been relocated at other prison holdings. Admittedly, some CMPNY were unhappy with Ryder’s role in their capture.
Steve nodded sleepily already sinking back into the covers as Tony tucked him in. He slipped on his slippers and rose off of the bed and turned back to Steve, leaning over him one more time before he went to the kids’ bedroom. As Tony pressed one last lingering kiss to his forehead, Steve breathily whispered “Love ya, sweetheart.”
“Yeah, sure. Well look Rhodey it’s been good talking to you, but I’m pretty sure you have a date coming up in an hour with Nurse Miranda,” Tony teased.
Ryder let go of Tony’s arm to open the door to their room. Tony wasn’t expecting any roses or anything special. However, he hadn’t expected darkness that was only lit by a desk lamp. Ryder pushed Tony into the room and followed him inside. The door creaked behind him and Ryder closed it and made sure to lock the top lock.
“He would take time to marvel at the arc reactor and you would shy away, just as you did our first time together. But he would make you feel like that arc reactor was something to be proud of and how he loves it because it keeps you alive,” he explained pressing a kiss to the arc reactor.
His voice became more slurred.  He shook his head and kept repeating the same mantra to himself. The shaking of his body became more violent. Natasha stepped forward and Tony screamed again, his hands tore at the patches on his skin. Her eyes traveled to the scratch marks around the patches and wondered how long he had been trying to get them off.
“Hey ‘m sorry. Went to sleep,” Tony sleepily murmured into Ryder’s chest. Ryder chuckled softly and began to lead Tony away to the elevator.
“Bruce do you think you’d be able to come with us or would you need to stay here,” Steve questioned not blaming Bruce if he decided to stay.
Wanda wished that she could have some alone time with him. She knew that she could pull the fears to the forefront of his mind. She could make him scream in desperation, claw at his skin as thought it was his enemy, and cry to the heavens for forgiveness.
A hand-shaped bruise was blossoming against his throat. His face was almost to the point of being unrecognizable. Steve thanked them internally for leaving that for him. Bucky noticed him first and then Clint, who had been going away with breaking Ryder’s fingers.
Tony waved goodbye to them both as Happy pulled off. Tony watched for a few seconds, before he went inside his home. Immediately, he was confused because usually the Tower was full of voices, especially during this time. But now everything was silent.
Steve silenced his thoughts and leaned against the headboard of his bed. His eyes remained shut, but he couldn’t get his thoughts to be completely suppressed. He opened his eyes when a harsh knocking sounded through his room.
“I told you I didn’t need your protection! Or did that night conversation just go inside one ear and out the other,” Tony screamed. “Is this like last time? You told me you were actually just wanting to protect yourself? That’s bullshit. Tell me the truth Steve. Tell me.”
“I don’t like this,” Tony exclaimed, running his hands through his stuffed animal’s fur. He needed to name this thing. “This thing got a name?”
He was going to say goodbye to Ryder, but Ryder had already fallen asleep. Tony softly exited his room and closed the door gently behind him. He sent out a quick message to Happy to tell him he would be downstairs soon and wondered briefly if Happy had some other place to be before Tony had texted him.
“You think I’m broken,” Tony said and it comes out accusatory. His statement is harsh in the moments that were silence. His breath stuttered. Steve watched as the color left his face and the energy that Tony had, arguing for Steve to say, left his eyes.
“I am here to provide legal counsel and to soothe out and question and concerns you all may have in regards to the Accords,” Isa said soothing out the wrinkles in her skirts.
“No, we were just done here actually. I didn’t know you were here. When did you get here?” he questioned.
“Ryder!” Isak said eyes widening with the increasing speed that his brother was doing. Wild hands went to grasp at the hands on the steering wheel, hoping to intervene. “Slow down.”
Rhodey looked confused for all, but a second before his expression smoothed out to one of sadness. Pepper reached out to hold Tony’s free hand, but he pulled it back sharply. Pepper suck in a breath, but let her hand stay on the edge of Tony’s bed.
Pepper frowned as she saw Tony’s eyes become misty. “Oh sweetie. I wasn’t going to say anything, but well do you even like Ryder?”
Steve complied to the demand and tried fitting himself into the small supply closet. There wasn’t a whole lot of room so the two let their legs entangle and Steve had to hunch his shoulders a little to allow for some space in the crowded closet. Steve’s breath ghosted over Tony’s neck and Tony had to resist not to bare his neck, allowing the warm breath to caress his skin. He was thankful for the darkness in the room that disallowed Steve from seeing his cheeks grow warm.
“That’s a lie,” Peter announce. “Hello, I think I was the most integral part to this. I brought the ring back from Wakanda.”
Natasha smiled and leaned forward to kiss his cheek. Ryder followed the movement with his eyes, but choose not to say anything.
“What took you so long,” Natasha muttered frustratingly, trying to cool her anger. She wasn’t angry at Bucky and Steve showing up minutes later, while she had to listen to Tony’s hoarse screams.  She was angry at herself for not knowing how to help, for not seeing that he needed help before all of this happened.
“I’m not a little spider and I’m not interrogating you. I am just asking questions. I’ve never met him so I don’t know him personally. And if you’re ignoring his calls it must’ve meant he did something for you not to answer any of his what…fifty calls.”
He stared at the phone once more and faintly let the voice of the newscaster travel into his ears. The lady brought up his name and then mentioned Ryder’s. Soon a few pictures popped onto the television. Tony’s face had been hidden by Ryder’s shoulders as though Ryder was shielding Tony from the cameras.
“I’m not sure,” Tony whispered. He began picking at his fingers, a nervous tick Tony had developed as a child.
Karen laughs softly. “Oh he is too precious. He does realize that the whole group will probably be coming, yes?”
Pepper came in, quickly followed by Rhodey. Pepper smiled brightly at him, holding an Iron Man teddy bear. He placed his shaking hands underneath his thighs so they wouldn’t draw their attention toward them. He smiled widely at them, though all he felt like doing was curling up into a ball because it was still so cold in here. Or maybe it wasn’t cold and the coldness from his time there simply was just going to stay there for the rest of his life.
“Bucky?” Sam questioned. “From what I’ve experience he doesn’t really talk and the times he does talk I wish he hadn’t.”
Tony held onto Steve and laughed as well, feeling the relief settle in him as the tear stains dried on his skin. As the two of them spun around, feeling this sense of lightness Tony found Natasha’s eyes. She was nursing her arm closer to her chest, but she smirked at him and nodded.
Tony then looked straight at the wall. “And then I remember the bruises, the words he said to me…how he made me feel like you all…” his sentence broke off.
“No, they don’t,” Miles disagreed. “You say that. I’m not growing. Aunt Natasha says baba eats his veggies and he’s still tiny.”
Thankfully, neither of them had to make the decision seeing as though in a few seconds later it was made for them.
They waited for nearly three minutes until they came back. Ryder had an arm lying on Tony’s shoulder. Tony turned to Natasha.
“Be good for me sweetheart and show me how beautifully you come apart,” Steve said, mouthing at Tony’s neck.
“So there’s no problems of me fucking you into the mattress that’ll it’ll be hard for you to walk straight for a little bit,” Steve teased.
“Yeah, Tony you laugh now. But just wait until Miles starts webbing it up or builds his own suit to fight bad guys in,” May huffed not pleased with how Tony was laughing at her.
Tony smiled at the softness spoken in the words. He rested his head on the chest and turned further into him. He tried blinking his eyes open again to look at Steve once more before he fell into complete unconsciousness. He wanted to see that face and thank him. Thank him for coming for him.
Bucky stifled a laugh as a cough and Clint had to turn away pretending to be busy with making coffee. Natasha shrugged her shoulders.
“Hey, we don’t have time for this. I thought we needed to make him disappear before Ryder returned. He didn’t say he was leaving for a long time,” the man stressed holding Tony’s legs tightly together.
Even though the two were moving forward in their relationship, there were still the occasional arguments between the two. At the foundation of the arguments was a growing fire ready to overwhelm the two. Thankfully, their arguments had never escalated that quickly. This time it was Tony who had given in.
He came quietly into the lab and was about to find where Peter was, but was stopped by a different voice in the room and some shuffling. He hid himself behind one of Tony’s machines and tried going unnoticed.
“Is that what you want? To leave?” Tony said evening out his tone in order to hide any hints of sadness.
“But I’m not doing anything Pepper. We were just stopping by at the bakery after you were done and everyone’s seen me in worst.”
“She drove them both off of a cliff and they died on impact,” she hoarsely whispered. “And now I don’t have my brother. Di doesn’t have her uncle. He didn’t get to see me get married. I wanted him to be my daughter’s cool uncle. Now the only way she’ll ever know him is through photos and trips to the graveyard. And the said thing is I found a note not even a few days later saying that if he had told someone no one would believe him because certainly he could take on a girl. I would have believed him.”
Natasha rolled her eyes good naturedly, while reaching into her bag. She threw it toward his face which Clint immediately wrapped around his body. He let out a contented sigh and smiled brightly at Natasha. The corners of her lips lifted and she continued walking to the entrance of S.H.I.E.LD.
With Peter listening to his music and focusing on his homework he didn’t realize Ryder coming into the kitchen. Ryder settled his briefcase softly by the table and looked at the two of them. Peter was bouncing his head up and down to the music.
Tony’s lips quivered. “Damn it. And I said I wouldn’t do this. ‘Cause I swear I’m done…this is the last time. The last time you’ll ever hear my name because I hate you, you piece of abusive lying shit. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you!”
“Do you want to stay with Tony?” Sam asked turning away from the disgusting image of Bucky eating that syrup soaked biscuit.
“Sweetheart. From you it sounds nice. Can you keep talking? I promise I’ll try to stay awake,” Tony said, fully knowing he wouldn’t be able to. Ryder had placed six different patches up and down his body, before he had left. It seemed he wanted to be extra cautious that Tony wouldn’t be able to gather energy from the air and escape.
He couldn’t wait till he could send his fist through his teeth. He pulled back his chair and stood up with the binder.
Tony tried maneuvering his way to grab ahold of his ringing phone, while carrying a sleeping Miles toward the couch. Finally, he was able to grab it and quickly answered it upon seeing Isa’ name on the screen.
Natasha read the letter again except this time in her head. “The best for Tony? Okay, Ryder has just come back into Tony’s life. He doesn’t know Tony like you do…like we do. This is just a guy who’s become jealous and has possibly grown weary of the closeness that you and Tony have had lately. You really let a piece of paper…” Natasha broke of frustrated.
“It’s hard,” Tony said, hands clenching around. “It’s always been me taking care of myself. I can probably take care of this too.”
Tony ran his tongue over his lips and Steve followed the motion, forcing himself not to give in this once and just bring himself closer to Tony. He had to hold himself from wanting to gather Tony in his arms and watch as Tony relaxed and his breathing fell like a warm breeze on his neck. He had to stop himself from doing all of this because he would want to stay.
He walked out of his bedroom and headed a few doors down to Miles’ bedroom. He just wanted to check on his son and make sure he was sleeping okay. It was the first week that Miles had not insisted on sleeping in Tony’s room.
Tony laughed dryly. “Someone who was weak wouldn’t have gotten themselves taken in the first place. I’m supposed to be a superhero and I get taken more than the average citizen probably. And crap what if they start taking Miles and I can’t protect him or…”
“I put you on speaker baba!” Miles said. “Peter! Harley! Baba on phone! See I tolded you,” Miles announced. “Say hi!”
As Miles eyes fluttered closed, Tony shifted so that his back was against the arm rest. His knees were tucked under him and he kept a hand running up and down Miles back. The coughs were less frequent now, but Tony still kept a check on it.
“And we’re here to provide helping hands setting everything up,” Harley said, watching as they pulled into their home.
The two girls nodded and closed the door behind Ryder. One girl locked the top lock and the other rolled in her suitcase. She looked back at the girl and grinned.
They walked around for a bit, Tony making sure to say hello to the donors that were there. Tony knew that they often liked to see their money being put into action, so he figured this was as good time of any. Plus it may lead them to donate more at the Christmas Charity Gala on next Saturday. Steve followed him and also made his own introductions.
“Ryder,” Steve growled overcome with bright fury and wanting nothing more, but to grab Ryder’s neck and squeeze. “If you lay one hand on Tony, I will cut both off.”
“It was really good actually. Peter did an amazing job, but that was never in question. But how are things there? Hopefully, you all haven’t burned the building down yet or anything.”
“We traded details back all the time, back in the 30s now you’re too delicate to know what I get up to in between the sheets?” Bucky laughed, seriously amused by this change in his friend.
The blankets nearly swallowed his whole frame and did nothing to bring to life the color in his cheeks. It only served to further darken this whole atmosphere. Tony would hate that when he woke up. Without thinking, he ran to the gift shop and bought an assortment of colorful things. He dressed the room up, ignoring everyone’s looks as he went back and forth until he was satisfied with how the room looked.
He sat down in the chair and grabbed ahold of Tony’s hand, the one that didn’t have an IV drip stuck in it. He ran his fingers over the cooling skin of Tony. He remembered how cold Tony had been. He then took of his jacket that Pepper had brought back from the tower.
He turned to look at Steve and whispered urgently, “You don’t think that Aunt Nat will like kill me right? I’m fairly certain I’m high in the rank of nephews, dad.”
“So what he’s a momma’s boy?” Karen said, feeling the need to defend her sexy firefighter, with whom she never got the chance to date.
“Excuse, me I didn’t hear you,” Ryder, smiled seemingly thinking that he now had the ball in his court.
“Well the boys will be here after school. I figured once Dr. Cho told me that you were able to stay awake for more than an hour at a time, the boys should be able to visit. Peter and Harley will probably swing by May’s to pick Miles’ up and head over here,” Pepper told him. “They’re really excited to see you.”
Steve faltered briefly, his movement to take another shard of glass was put on pause. He brought his eyes up to meet Tony’s. However, Tony’s had his face turned toward the resting palm in his lap.
Steve stopped shortly, not really knowing how to respond or if to respond. He loved Miles, he truly did and he was really grateful that Miles had been placed in Tony’s life. He knew that if he truly wanted to pursue Tony and having Miles say he wanted him to be his dad instead, well that got to him.
Steve wished that there was a way to communicate to her without hearing her voice. “Where are your CMPNY’s headquarters?”
“Because! Because I couldn’t find him by myself, I couldn’t bring him back. I had no idea where he was. If it was just me, he would still be there Buck. He would still be there,” Steve rasped out, his breath hitching from trying to control the way a sob wanted to break out.
“I’m not nervous. I’m just a little…well okay possibly a little nervous. It’s just I’m hoping to impress Tony. I just want to do everything I can to express through both my words and actions how much I love him. I’m nervous that at the end of the day this won’t be enough,” Steve admitted taking a piece of the loaf of bread he had pulled out and popping it into his mouth.
Steve heard a glass break and a body falling to the ground. Immediately he ran into the kitchen and spotted Tony lying on the floor, hands a bloodied mess. His head hung low on his shoulders and on his lap the palms of his hands were upturned. Steve stood looking at Tony as Tony brought his hand up to wipe away a tear.
“Who cares what they think? The only opinions that matter are yours and mine. You have no reason to be jealous,” Tony placates. “I am yours and only yours, when are you going to realize-”
Steve grew enflamed at the comparison of Ryder and Bucky.  Bucky had been brainwashed and used against his will. And even then Bucky had still shown great remorse for his actions. He hadn’t tried hiding away from the consequences of his past life. He didn’t try to make a new identity and pass himself off as someone new without the scars of his past clinging onto him.
Or worse having Steve look at him like he was the cause of all of this…because he wasn’t and he could never be.
“I had everything ready for you and me to talk and then you up and fucking disappear with Bucky. And I think oh okay…things will get sidelined for a little. Because I understood what Bucky meant to you. And with me knowing how he was basically the Rhodey to my Tony, I was going to help you. I was going to tell you about ways to get him acclimated back into society, ways to do things legally, how to help heal his mind and his body. But you never gave me the chance to.”
“Come on I know you’ve been wanting to feel me up since day one. Now I’m giving you the opportunity.”
Tony was grateful that when he entered the school, most students had already been called to the gymnasium for the program. The only thing he needed was to get a name tag from the receptionist and give them some form of ID.
Steve tried reigning in the need to scowl and roll his eyes. Instead he nodded as though understanding the man’s confusion.
Steve wanted to know why, but figured that he shouldn’t be pushing his luck right now. So he refused and just continued talking with Tony. While there were still some awkward silences and moments of tension, the hours passed before their eyes.
Tony sighed inwardly. He knew that Pepper had managed to work her ways so that Miles would be out of the spotlight as much as possible, but he was still concerned. He didn’t want anyone coming near Miles that was not him. However, he had a four year old that needed to get his energy outside of running around the tower.
“No!” he yelled then added softly, “No, of course not Tony. Look Ryder’s lying to you okay, he’s trying to hurt you. He doesn’t care about you.”
“Does it fucking look like I’m on drugs? And if I am what are you going to do, report me to your little nice American sense of moral justice?” he growled. “Fuck off. Why the hell are you even in my room?”
“Did you happen to forget that we had dinner reservations? I told you that I didn’t have the night shift tonight so I wanted to take you out. Thought since we had been apart for a month you would have looked forward to our date or at least remembered it.”
Tony sighed at the movement, but allowed his body to be maneuvered gently by Steve. That was until Steve tried placing Tony in an upright position. Tony removed Steve’s hand and twisted his body so that his legs were elevated on the bench’s arms and his head was placed on Steve’s lap. Steve swallowed down the need to whisper, “I love you.”
She would have held back for Tony seeing as though he was currently employing her, but well he wasn’t here to physically stop her from saying anything that was…well less classy.
Steve looked down at his feet, before turning his gaze up to meet Tony’s. His eyes were heavy with the burden of a thousand weights. Fury could see the tension running all throughout his body, yet Steve remained a solid sign of strength. His shoulders were still straight and his gaze hadn’t wavered, since he started looking at Fury.
“Baba’s hurt,” he said frowning, brown eyes quickly filling with water. “You…you said he was better.”
“No, I’m pretty sure he said what he meant,” Steve exclaimed shaking his head. “You all have fun now.”
Ryder checked in to whatever place he had brought Tony too. Tony ignored the slight swelling in his eye, a Christmas gift that Ryder had been all too ready to give, while in the car. The driver had said nothing as the sound, of Ryder’s fist meeting Tony’s face, echoed in the car. Tony wondered briefly if Ryder had paid the driver not to say anything.
“I want you to promise me, but also…” Tony bit his lip and looked to the side of the room, narrowing his eyes like he was training them not to betray him and release the waterworks.
He knew when Ryder was growing agitated. He would make a clicking noise with his tongue against the back of his teeth.
“Steve, look I know this is a lot to take in, but Ryder is dead. Be happy about it. Tell Tony,” Fury said. “There’s nothing more to look into.”
Steve looked down at his hands, running his hands over the healing marks where Tony had tried scratching his way out of his hold, screaming for Tony not to touch him. He could see Tony’s unfocused eyes looking everywhere, but to the man holding him as if he was terrified. Tony had nearly pleaded that they just let him go or that he didn’t want to wake up.
“How is Peter doing by the way?” Tony questioned as he followed Karen to the room Miles’ shared with four other boys.
Natasha walked in just as the judges were about to announce the winners. She stepped over Clint’s legs and threw herself onto the couch.
He looked at all of them gathered in the kitchen with food splayed before him. He watched as they all turned their eyes to focus on him with layering expressions of anger, resentment, tiredness, and things of the like.
Gabe had tried handling the situation civilly, but when Steve had heard about it…well everyone knew that Steve hated bullies. He was just getting used to his new body too and that could be explained with the force that Steve sent that soldier across base camp, but Bucky knew better.
Isak looked down. “I…I’m not sure really. It’s just I was at home having a nice family outing with my family, you know since everything with my brother…and then some of your agents I guess…erm SHIELD came and picked me up. They didn’t really tell me anything, but maybe you could? I’m certain my wife is very concerned.”
Steve curled his hands against Tony’s head and felt for the baby hairs at the nape of his neck. It took only a few seconds to recognize that Steve was crying. Tony raised his arms even more and curled them around Steve’s neck. Steve gasped out, the sounds seeming horrifying to his ears.
“Yeah, it was a pretty cool day. Everyone was excited for vacation. Kelsey is going to Colorado and she said she’d bring me back a snow globe! And Aron said he’s going camping. Lunch was bad though like really bad. Can you go back to making my lunch dad?” Miles rushed out.
When Steve closed his bathroom door to step inside his bedroom, he was surprised to see Tony hovering over his StarkPad, one he had no doubt gotten very interested in as Natasha had left to go get some water. A warm smile brightened his equally tired expression. Steve wanted to run his hands through Tony’s hair and entreat him to get a few more hours of sleep.
“I haven’t. I swear Ryder,” Tony whispered, greatly fearing what Ryder could do with his imagination.
“God Natasha it’s awful,” Steve broke though. “I just wanted to protect him and I wanted Bucky to be my best friend. I wanted to be right because everything else was falling apart around me. I kept feeling empty during all of this, but I was finally whole when I thought that I was protecting Tony. I felt like for once I was saving someone I lo-”
She was tired of listening to him try to justify his brother’s actions and place everything on Tony.
“I can’t stop now. I think if I were to stop I wouldn’t have enough courage to continue,” Tony breathed. “I’m fine. Just let me…give me a second.”
Julie simply took it all in good faith, even taking some time to make her own kissing faces to a brightly flushed Harley.
“Clean yourself up Tony. You look a fucking mess and we have guests. And for goodness sake tell that fucking kid to stop coughing,” Ryder replied thumb smoothing over a point of tension in Tony’s thigh. “When does he leave? Already feel like he’s been here forever.”
“Oh, I most certainly do,” Tony said finally giving in to Steve. It wouldn’t hurt…and if secretly Tony had been hoping this for almost his who life no one would ever know.
“I always knew what you wanted,” Ryder yelled, eyes growing wide with fury. His mouth was also taut with unrestrained anger at the way Tony was getting vocal with him.
“It is a concern yes,” Helen said truthfully, “one we have addressed. The next few hours will be critical. I must be honest with you all. Tony does have a high drug content. The state he was in mirrors that of an overdose patient and then you add the concussion, fractured ribs, esophageal damage due to his body ridding itself of its stomach’s acid contents on a frequent basis, probably due to the large amounts of alcohol we see..”
Bucky shrugged his shoulders and followed Natasha. He figured it would be best to just not question it.  Natasha looked back to Tony and smiled mischievously. Internally, Tony was already praying that Clint and Bucky made it out of this carnival uninjured.
“Please, please, please let me out,” he cried, the palms of his hands meeting the cool tile floor. “Please let me out. I can’t breathe in here.”
An update on a weekday? What is happening? Well tis the season for giving and I wanted to give you all an extra chapter! Your comments made me smile and I just felt like you all deserve a little treat. So please enjoy. I'll see you again on Saturday. :)
She stood up and walked toward him. A resounding smack was heard as her hand met Steve’s cheek. Steve’s face went backward from the sheer force that Natasha exerted. Natasha coolly sat back down in her seat as Steve tried to register what just happened. He could feel the stinging pain begin to settle in his bones. He hadn’t known Natasha could hit that hard…he never had reason to care how it felt. But now he did.
Ryder interrupted Tony’s statement with a harsh bite to his bottom lip. “Ah, now there’s the feistiness that I hate to love. You are certainly a picture of beauty, it is a shame that Steve didn’t realize what he had in front of him. Otherwise he probably would have found you sooner. Guess, you didn’t give him reason enough to look for you. Do you want to know how long it has been? How long they haven’t been looking for you?”
Steve’s chest prickled and he just felt his body need to get out of the seat and want to beat Isak. He had never felt this strongly in his life and he wanted to push Isak over a cliff and have his body bounce off of the cliff’s rocky edges. He wanted to poison Ryder from the inside out.
Tony blinked away tears that was coming up due to the pain in his shoulder. Through bleary eyes he looked at the two women entering the room. Ryder looked back at Tony. He kept the door open.
Tony looked back toward where Steve was helping guide children to their specific rides. He looked at Tony and flashed a warm smile at him. Tony gave one back.
“I love you. I love you so I need you to wake up, so you can see that fucker be put down,” he cursed, thinking to how Tony would have jokingly made a remark on his language. “I don’t know what you’ll need, but I’ll be there for you no matter how long it takes. Ma always said that you can wait forever for the ones you love.”
“No facial recognition in the database,” FRIDAY noted with what sounded like a bit of disappointment.
“No, we never want to leave and we will never want to leave. We should have never left in the first place” Steve answered. “And I’m all for talking things out from now on and figuring what to do from here.”
He looked at his ring, gosh he was a whole fiancé…he smiled dopily and smiled at Steve. He leaned back into his embrace and held the hand that was rubbing circles into his waist. He pulled away and Steve followed.
Tony felt a deep sense of discontent settle thickly in his throat. He tried reigning in that liquid hot anger, so that his words would come out literate and not verging spite.
Natasha turned her head around to look at the trains that were situated in the main lobby. She then looked back at Julie.
Wet eyes met Natasha’s. “Natasha…you have to believe me I didn’t want to leave…but it was better. I…I have a letter.”
Steve…Steve wasn’t quite sure what he was doing. All he knows is that one minute he was watching all of them and the next his eyes blinked out for a second. There was a bright flash of anger that surged in him and fear all at the same time. The two emotions were so powerful that they threatened to overcome him.
Harley jumped out of his sheet, quickly washed his dishes and grabbed his backpack. He knelt down to grab his poster board and tugged onto Steve’s hands.
“Crap, they’ve caught on to us. Come on Bucky let’s move out,” Clint said pulling along a passive Bucky. “Thanks for the funnel cake.”
Well, if Tony had forgotten what it felt like when Steve hit Tony’s chest with the shield, he certainly remembered now. The fingers at his chest shortly lost its rhythm before he began a steady tapping once more.
His throat tightened from holding in the confession again. He wanted to tell it to Tony every day, but ever since he said it to Tony that first time he woke up in the hospital, Tony would flinch at the statement. Steve would like to say it wasn’t him that was causing the flinch, he felt like he knew that he wasn’t…but at the same time…
“We have to be honest from now on. I don’t care for whatever reason. Just be honest and listen to me. I know more than I let on,” Tony announced.
“Yes, understood. Now guess I’ll go lug my humbug downtrodden self-down to Nurse Miranda who’s going to what…help heal me through the joys of caroling and children?”
Familiar and unfamiliar faces went in and out of the room. He’s never left alone and if he was, he’s tied up. Tony didn’t know which one was worse. He hated when Miriam was there. She just didn’t seem to care. It seemed she was paying off whatever debt she and her sister had with joy. While Cali seemed to painfully do as she was instructed, Miriam loved to go above and beyond.
A few minutes passed before he felt his phone vibrating in his jean pocket. For a brief moment he imagined it was Ryder asking why the three hour meeting was quickly veering toward five.
Tony winked at Nathaniel who laughed. Tony passed him and went down the stage. On his way down he greeted everyone who was invited and thanked them for coming and for their donations. He said hello to their children and other members of their family.
“He’s in Peter’s room. Small sir has been there, since later on this evening as soon as Peter came to visit for the weekend,” FRIDAY answered back.
“Then you would have never suggested to bring in Tony, if you actually had cared,” Steve told him. “So no, he’s not coming. He’s staying as far away from this situation as he possibly can.”
“Yeah, I think the hardest part was admitting I was wrong. But after Natasha gave me some helpful hints,” Clint added unconsciously rubbing his shoulder, “I realized that I needed to confess my own wrongdoings and admit them to Laura.”
He could remember his ma, her arms wrapped around his thin frame as she recited word from word the sonnet she loved so dearly.
Peter sat down and looked at the screen that Shuri was on. “I just want to go out there and help. They won’t let me because they think I’m just some intern and then the one time I showed up as Spiderman Steve benched me saying I was too young.”
Natasha quirked an eyebrow at him and titled her head. Tony raised his hand in defense. “Sorry or I don’t know spying on some local bystander. Just nothing with me going to the orphanage. Nothing with me at all okay.”
Not even seconds later, Steve’s phone buzzed with an incoming text. He frowned slightly, when his brain provided the fact that Tony never liked paying attention to his phone, while with company. It was actually the only time that someone could see Tony unattached to his phone, unless it was an emergency. Tony had told him it was the one good thing he took from his father. He may not have always been attentive to Tony as a child, but he was never rude enough to have his attention anywhere else beside the food in front of him.
“And I know it’s not the same. You were brainwashed for like 70 years and you had no agency in your decisions. I figured it wasn’t fair to seek forgiveness, when I couldn’t forgive someone who didn’t even need forgiveness. So I don’t blame you. I blame Hydra. I am sorry for placing everything on you. That wasn’t fair of me.”
“I thought…Tony for a second I didn’t know if…”  he broke off, hands tightening to the point they would leave marks at the back of Tony’s neck, but he wouldn’t mind. Tony would feel them as a reminder and that Steve’s presence grounded him into the present.
“Come on. Fighting should be easy, given how many times you’ve fought Tony when he was defenseless. I don’t like repeating myself, Ryder. I said get the fuck up,” Steve said pulling him up by the tattered clothing off of his back.
It was Steve’s turn to flinch. Tony’s response to it made him wish he had better control over his reaction.
Bucky sniffed and narrowed his eyes at the burning butter. He quickly grabbed a towel and placed the skillet on the part of the stove that was not hot yet.
“Stop staring, punk,” he joked easily as if this was something he know did. “I’m pretty sure the building will still be here tomorrow.”
“Never can be too sure,” Ryder addressed worriedly. “I would rather check to make sure everything is okay, then him blood hemorrhaging and dying.”
Natasha quirked an eyebrow at him, as though that statement alone refuted what he had said, which in all honesty it did.
Bucky tilted his head back and closed his head. “It was a B.A.R.F. day so not the best, but I’ll survive. It’s been helping so…”
“And I thought all of this fighting would eventually work its way out because in the end I wanted to protect him just a little longer from the heartache. I wanted to protect Bucky from being vilified. I wanted to protect me because I knew that there was a chance I could lose both of them. I could lose my best friend and Tony. And guess what I did!” Steve exclaimed with faux enthusiasm.
Thanks my love for all your wonderful comments, bookmarks, and kudos. I love all of you for your support and thanks for sticking with this WIP.
He spoke through gesticulated hands and body movement. He used his words as his defense. But he couldn’t here. He couldn’t call upon his armor.
He desired for someone to want and need him. He had that with Ryder. Ryder demonstrated to him that he wanted him and truly needed him because no one else could be with him. Tony knew this for what it was then. He hadn’t told anyone what happened in that unnamed place, but he had told himself what happened wasn’t a dream no matter how many times it had a recurring presence in his nightmares.
The girls all laughed, shaking in excitement and ready to explain just what they were about to do. That was up until Tony’s phone rang again.
“How dare you try to laugh this off as not something serious,” Bucky said, for once speaking up from his corner. “This isn’t some game.”
Tony nearly blissed out, clung harder onto Ryder as he drove deeper inside of him. Ryder pressed hungry kisses against his nape and move forward shaking as if he himself were overcome with joyous emotion. Tony rocked with the movement and realized that if in this moment things were okay…if for once he actually felt desirable and pleasurable as Ryder moved within places he rarely ever let any people go…then maybe he should say yes to what Ryder wanted more often than not. If only for these few short minutes of love.
Despite all instincts telling Bucky to probe deeper into the reason for the reddening and beginning to bruise mark on Tony’s face, he remained silent in thought. He couldn’t say anything. For all he knew Tony did run into something in the lab. He hadn’t known the man very long, but the others often spoke about how clumsy Tony was.
“I’m sure she would want to know Harley. You wanting to spend time with your mom for a few more months is valid,” Tony said.
“He’d spread you apart and just look at you and you would preen under that attention. Never had that before, so you’d love it. He’d run his hands all over you a pleasant weight. Then he would spread you apart with his fingers,” Ryder unzipped his pants and pushed Tony’s hips up to slide them off.
Tony cried onto the floor, body wracking with shivers. He couldn’t stop dry heaving. His arms curled around himself.
Steve was pressed beside Tony, not wanting to crowd his space, but also not wanting Tony to not have physical comfort. His hand hovered over his shoulders, before he placed them by his sides, unsure of what touch could mean to Tony right now.
“I’m going to go visit Miles. The children at the orphanage are quite fans of Black Widow you know. The girls especially love you. Though I’m pretty terrified about that because I think those girls have been holding secret meetings about training to be little spies and assassins. Fairly certain their first mission is to kill me with cuteness over how they all are taking all the plastic knives from the pantry. You know what never mind that’s not cute. I should probably tell Karen about that. Right?”
“I can’t seeing as though Ryder never told me the specifics of the location. However, I know a driver who can. Unfortunately, he hasn’t been found since he lost favor with Ryder,” Cali said without further explanation.
The two talked for a few more minutes, before Principal Davis went toward the podium. Following him were Peter, Michelle, Ned, and two other students. They all were led to their seats as Principal Davis stood in front of them. Principal Davis began to introduce the guest speaker, going over his list of accomplishments and the sort. Shortly after the guest speaker came in thanking Principal Davis for his kind words then directed the audience’s attention toward a video that he had brought along.
He thought Ryder was correct. He thought he had cared about him in his belief that Tony was stronger. He started thinking that maybe he had recovered all that he could and maybe he should be fine with that.
Tony looked on confused as he rubbed the spot where the coloring book had come into contact with his forehead. He would have laughed if it were anyone else but him Miles’ was throwing the coloring book at.
Clint gave out a dark laugh. Something in the back of his head was begging him to stop, to tell him there was no way of coming back from this.
“Come on your eyes are red and you can barely keep them open,” Steve said reaching over Miles sleeping body to close Tony’s eyelids. “Go to sleep.”
Cali leaned back wordlessly and picked up Tony’s head. Tony shivered and shook. He smacked his lips together and turned sluggish eyes toward Miriam. Miriam petted his hair and then leaned over to grab another bottle.
Apologies for having no update last week. It's just been one of those weeks and I would much rather give a late update than a chapter where my heart and mind wasn't in it. This also means I'm late to responding to comments, but know that I've read them, I've loved them, I've highly appreciated them, and I'll be getting to them soon. :)
Much love to everyone who has commented, sent a kudo, bookmarked, shared, etc. I truly appreciate it :)
Steve smirked, “Sure, but that was before you were thinking of dating her pseudo daughter. I think I caught her sharpening her knives one day just for the guy who’d ever ask Julia out, right Peter?”
