Then Thanos happened, and Tony held Peter
Tony pointedly ignored the way his heart sunk as he sat back onto his bed. All he wanted was some goddamn pancakes and here he was thinking about how even children feared him.
“11 people.” Steve said blankly.
Steve shook his head. “It was different back then though. We were in the recession, war was looming on our shores. The second world war wasn’t some sort of gradual thing. It grew, we could see it coming from miles away, we just didn’t have the power to do anything about it. Roosevelt provided security, he had experience, he knew how to lead us out of the war. And he did.”
sort of impact on them, however small it was. “Oh that’s incredible, what’re you building?”
They had to wait far too long for one of their so called friends to answer.
Bruce raised an eyebrow, slowly smirking. “Care to explain, Natasha?”
Steve groaned. “There’s so much to keep up with.”
“This is the first quiet spot we’ve been too in the entire gardens.” Bruce commented absentmindedly, putting his phone away.
“Ah yeah, all the boys loved those hidden lists with our names hastily scribbled on them in brothels whilst our existence was illegal – but I get your point.” Steve said. He rubbed his neck rather shyly. “So, how do I woo him?”
. Like all the baggage that he carried with him, his doubts, his insecurities, his inherent anguish fly away, into the wind behind him. There wasn’t anything out here that Tony wasn’t connected too. The heat of the sun on his back, the cold of the winds on his face, the warmth of Steve’s back on his chest, the smell of vanilla and grass. It was a total, and complete unification of his mind, body, and soul, and it was spiritually uplifting. Nothing else mattered.
“God Natasha, he’s just – he’s wonderful!” Tony flailed. “He’s good,
FRIDAY hummed. “Isn’t that a conflict of interest? You helping Steve could swing things to go your way.”
FRIDAY hummed. “He’s on the punching bag now but… Thor. He was sparring with Thor earlier. It got a little bit rough.”
And God, how was Tony’s heart supposed to stand up to that?
Natasha hummed in agreement. “Definitely, and Clint, don’t you dare flick those at me.”
“Could you tell them to get their asses down here?” Clint asked. “Thor’s hungry.”
And wasn’t that a thought. That despite everything, they had always been in sync in battle. Tony dropped his wrench, he shouldn’t have been surprised by that, but he was, he had always been in sync with Steve. Which is why everything meant so much to him, the fighting, the comradery, the friendship, that wish for something more.
“Or me.” Thor said. “He’s therefore upset about something.”
Hours turned to days, and days turned to weeks. Steve stared at the polystyrene tiles that paved the roof, watching as the shadows from the trees danced in the flickering moonlight. They moved like monsters, preying on Tony, waiting for his last breath before they struck.
“You bought it for him, didn’t you?”
“Hey FRI,” he asked, lying back into his previous position. “Is there anywhere that delivers pancakes?”
“Bruschetta, huh?”
Tony found Steve in the kitchen, his head buried inside the fridge. “Sorry,” Tony said in lieu of a hello, “We don’t have eggs.”
Bruce nodded. “We’ll grab Tony and watch the original trilogy. If you
Natasha was impressed, at first glance she wouldn’t have suspected anything was there.
And Peter – Peter called him by his first name, Peter was prepared to joke and have fun with Tony, Peter, sweet wonderful Peter, who Tony had caused to die, and come back to life, who had been his rock after Siberia, and had helped him grow into someone he would be honoured for Peter to be proud of. Tony had always had that, regardless of anything else.
Tony collapsed back into bed.
Tony leapt out of the bed and raced down the hallway. “Steve!” He cried out. “Steve wait!”
” (11)
Clint was rubbing a hand over his mouth, nodding slightly in awe. His eyes hadn’t left the archways roof. “I don’t-. When I was a kid, we had this pot by the front door, overflowing with these flowers. It was the one, nice thing about that place.” Natasha blink at him, she hadn’t ever thought Clint would open up about his childhood like this. She gave his shoulder an encouraging squeeze. “When me and my broth- Barney. When Barney and I left and travelled, I’d see them around the place, and I’d feel less alone.” He shook his head, his eyes slightly glassy. Natasha knew the parts of the story Clint hadn’t said, the abusive, awful parts that he omitted from his own memory. To speak out like this – he had to have been moved. “How did he know,” he whispered, “how on earth did that stubborn genius know?”
Steve smirked, before returning to his book. “Sure Tony, you tell yourself that’s why you’re helping them.”
“I was with the punching bag!”
FRIDAY chuckled. “That’s why I only observe,” she turned to Natasha, “speaking of, keep your phone on whilst at the gardens, I’m invested in this.”
“I’ll admit I’m wrong about this if it turns out I
“God yes,” Tony said. “I heard about your admittance last year, Dean Bahng and I are friends – you were almost as young as I was!”
Tony was a laughing mess as they finished, playing at his hair in a futile attempt to clean it. “Aw man,” he breathed out, Steve collapsed onto the bench in laughter. “I’m gonna need another shower.”
Steve would be able to hear Tony’s shallow, nervous breaths,
Even though Pepper had said it was sweet.
Steve’s mind shies away from the word ‘drunk’, but that’s the best adjective. It’s soft and sleepy, hard to understand if Steve hadn’t had a short lifetime of learning to decipher its unique decibels, the meanings behind each individual intonation, the lilts and the stresses.
“Can I make a side bet that Tony will make the first move?” Thor asked. “Just for $10, like Bruce.” Natasha hummed, looking towards Bruce and Clint. “I’m okay with it if you two are.”
“Of course.” Steve said immediately, turning to the groceries they’d bought from the markets.
“He wants Tony and I to bring them back -”
“Yes,” Tony said, interrupting Steve. He swallowed, composing himself, “No, yeah, that sounds good.”
Tony arrived in 24 minutes, and he may have done a little dance as he got out of the suit – but there wasn’t anyone around to see it, so it was okay. Tony had always loved this place. It was his parents winter cabin and as a kid, Jarvis – the human one, would drive them up through the dying autumn leafed trees, to set up the house for Christmas.
“The funny thing is, I’m not even afraid of what he would be like in a relationship. Ty – Stone, well, he was
“Well,” Steve said. “You didn’t see them in the forties, forget the tesseract or the… Nazi stuff, their clothing alone made them evil enough. It was depressingly awful.”
And somehow, that wasn’t exciting, like Tony thought it should have been, it was just…
Tony raised a suspicious eyebrow at her, which she only returned with a sharklike grin. Steve shrugged like that was perfectly natural. “Alright, I’ll be back in a bit,” then his hand slipped out of Tony’s and he was off and lost into the crowd.
There were a couple of more statues they pointed out to Thor and Steve as they walked on.
Tony stared at the bike as it spluttered pathetically on the side of the road. He had to admit, when he woke up deciding he was going to have pancakes, he didn't see his morning turning out quite like this.
-Century adventure?”
Steve’s smile grew into a reflection of Tony’s. “And I love you Tony Stark, I really truly love you.”
Steve scrunched up his face. “I understood those words, but not in that order.”
Steve looked stricken.
“You’re hilarious,” Tony said, but he slid out of his chair nonetheless, because he did not spend 4 hours out of his day getting everything he needed for pancakes to just
“I would be offended by that,” Steve said. “If I didn’t know first-hand how incredible Spiderman is.” Steve said, oblivious to Peter and his identity.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck, his skin turning an adorable shade of red. “Steve, you can call me Steve.”
“Yeah,” Tony breathed out, raking a hand through his hair to clear his thoughts. “Yeah, I’m finished.”
You have to give Tony more credit.” (7)
“So,” Natasha said as the others walked in. “Who won the bet?”
“The best Avenger, huh.” Steve said with a smile, which well, honestly, made Tony feel kind of warm and fuzzy.
Tony buried his head into the crook of Steve’s neck. “Just an FYI, this is the best gift I could’ve asked for.”
Whilst Steve was gone, the others took turns to make sure Tony was never alone. Natasha always stayed at the foot of the bed, eyeing both the door, and Tony.
The glass.
Tony wouldn’t forgive himself if anything happened.
Steve’s face fell with shock. “Seriously?
Natasha grinned, thinking of the bet. “Yeah, Tuesday could work.”  Clint cackled. “Yeah, we’re going to need to comfort Nattie-bear somehow when she loses the bet.”
Biting his bottom lip – it seemed he hadn’t stopped, Tony looked up at him in shock. His eyes were warm though as he considered Steve, as if he was just blatantly confused and guilty more than anything, not angry by what he had seen. “Me,” he breathed, “it was all me.”
“Sixteen?” She said. “I get most of my supplies from MIT so-”
Natasha stilled her hand.
Clint grinned manically. “Oh no, I’m definitely not. Your reaction alone made it worth it.”
“Yeah, I did, didn’t I.”
“It would be so easy!” Thor said, “the two of you are some of the smartest men I have ever known! If anyone could do it, it would be you! Surely there is some dinosaur DNA somewhere that-”
“The second one,” Steve corrected, “and it wasn’t just the war. He was president for about ten years before that.”
“I’ll take him,” Steve said, standing.
Tony lit up whenever he was surrounded by anything to do with florals. Be it actual flowers, clothing, the myriad of artworks Steve did or the design of the take away coffee cup from that cart he and Natasha went to the other week.
“Say that again,” Natasha said, “but slowly.”
Not long after, Steve emerged from the bathroom. Tony’s breath caught in his throat, Steve was
“What are we classifying as move here? Is it flirting or just straight on to kissing?” Bruce asked, sitting in one of the sofa’s. Natasha followed suit, planting herself on the arm of the chair.
So, for a selection of somewhat observant superheros with
There was a corner store at the end of the street, but was it worth the trip? He would have to get dressed up, sunglasses, a hat, a baggy hoodie, the whole works. His scratched his chin, his beard was shaggy and somewhat outgrown after days in the lab. He could pull off a disguise. On a Sunday morning his demeanour could easily be excused for a hangover.
“There’s an art to these things.”
“How is this a short cut…” Clint asked, raising an eyebrow.
Natasha gazed at the flower, smiling softly. She didn’t have the words to describing how she felt in that moment, except, she didn’t want to win the bet. Tony deserved to be happy
Natasha set Steve bandaged right hand on the table with his left, sighed, then raised her head so she could lock eyes with him. “So let me get this straight, you don’t think you’re good enough for him, even though you think that’s for him to decide – no Steve, you just said he’s too great and has created too great of a world for you to fit in, don’t argue with me. You also value your friendship and don’t want to lose that, which is fair, anyone in your position would be. Those are your main concerns.”
Natasha nodded. “FRIDAY, could you please bring up the details of the Mom and Dad bet please?”
“I’ve done it before.” Steve said, as if that made it any better.
Right now though it felt like a damn waste.
FRIDAY grimaced. “Yeah… No. They’re a bit busy right now.”
Tony screwed up his face, it sounded so…
“No that’s important too,” Tony said. “It’s important to go through life at your own pace, to not let people rush you,
Steve felt the hot surge of shame crawl up his spine as he stood there dumbly in the workshop, suddenly feeling very out of place, like he was intruding. He had been spending years of his spare time in Tony’s workshop, had grown something strong and warm and safe with the man.
“There is a restaurant called ‘Mighty Cakes’ in Sydney, Australia that delivers in their general vicinity,” FRIDAY replied. Tony could have sworn there was a hint of amusement in the AI’s voice. Good.
U, ever the better behaved of the two, rolled over with the marker in hand. Tony took it, patting U’s frame. “Ah, that’s a good boy, thanks.”
happen on a Monday, and it would throw her out for a loop. (8)
“Sure looks like something.” He said, careful to keep his voice level; because Tony Stark had been looking through Steve
“I promise,” Tony said again, “it’s not what it looks like.”
Steve looked absolutely broken, his eyes flicking away from Tony’s. “Yes, Tony, I did – I do.”
incredibly crowded today. The reopening of the botanic gardens had attracted people from all over the city. It was even more popular due to Tony’s elaborate, and accidentally highly covered involvement.
Natasha tied the wrap off. “But then you looked at Tony a different way…”
“They’re not here?” Tony asked, peeling his shoes off with his feet.
Tony swallowed, this was…
Tony. It’s sweet, it shows you were thinking about him, that you were thinking about how you could make him smile. He’ll love it.”
His pancake cravings were making him act like this, that’s all.
He took his wallet and winked, sliding his glasses onto his face and walking out.
“Just a thing.” Clint said quickly.
Bruce spluttered. “Hey! Don’t incriminate me in this.”
“We had no reason to unlock them.”
The water was warm on Tony’s face, and instantly he felt calmer.
Because honestly,
Tony waved a hand in the air. “A software update for the Starkphones. About 10 people,” Tony paused, counting them up in his head. “No, 11 people complained the browser took to long to open. Then there was the display issue with the clock, and that thing with the phone not marking notifications for voicemails – which, who even uses voicemails anymore, so we just figured to roll an update out before Christmas.”
“Well it was either that or letting some Shield agent I didn’t know take charge,” Steve shrugged, giving a ruthful grin. “So in hindsight it was probably a good thing I took her up on her offer.”
They worked in harmony, repairing Steve’s bike. For the first time in what felt like forever, the silence between them wasn’t stifling, but rather, it was comforting. They were both consumed in their own little projects, but aware enough of the other person to give a helping hand without being called upon or asked.. It had been so long, Tony had forgotten what it was like to just casually work on something with Steve, he missed it, he missed
Tony was… in love. He had to physically force himself not to moan as he ate. It was delicious. When he told Steve as much, the grin he got back was so kind and endearing, Tony momentarily forgot about the food.
“Several, sir.”
“Nattie-bear?” Natasha asked.
“But we’ll talk about that later,” Steve said, relishing in the way Tony felt in his arms, it was just so right.
“Always. I won’t let you fall again.”
“They’re probably making out.” Clint snorted, dangling off of a ledge Tony had installed for him.
chose that.”
what Tony would have seen. He couldn’t –
The girl scouts for example, could have easily been explained away that there weren’t any waivers for the experiments, Tony was cautious, of course, he would never want to hurt a kid. But Tony knew he could get carried away, an innocent fire experiment for him, could be a lawsuit waiting to happen for the girl guides.
getting the final checks tested so Tony could put forth his new software baby into the world.
Steve took a sharp turn, leaning to the left. It was exhilarating, as though they were defying gravity. Tony could lean his face forward and let his nose graze the road, if he wanted to. He could see the little cracks and splits in the bitumen that showed it’s age, he could taste the dust and smell the burning gravel, singeing his nose. It was like flying, but on the ground, with his arms wrapped securely around Steve.
“It’s hard to remember why we all hated him when we have an angry Cheeto as president now.” Clint remarked.
There were a lot of things that went through Tony’s mind in that moment. He didn’t let anyone drive him – ever. Not since his parents died, and certainly not since Afghanistan. Sure, he’d make an exception here and there, Happy could drive him sometimes; if it was important enough, so could Rhodey. Other than that though, no, he couldn’t.
Natasha smiled softly, watching as Steve’s own smile grow into a bigger, dopier grin as he spoke about Tony. Half of her wanted to smack him on the back of the head for not realising he was feeling this earlier, because
It took Tony 0.3 seconds to realise what had happened.
Tony sighed as he arrived at the front gate. Yeah, he could ask Steve for a favour.
“Romanov, I appreciate punishing Clint, but if you’re breaking my tower in the process-”
They were only a few minutes into the movie when Tony raced inside, dragging Steve behind him with his hand clutched in Steve’s. “Sorry! We got side tracked, Steve was playing fetch with U, Dum-E was getting jealous and Butterfingers kept hiding the ball, it was this whole thing.”
And because of that, Tony had
Tony’s face turned solemn. “I am sorry y’know, for looking through it. I really didn’t mean to.”
Tony shook his head, collecting the bags, and whilst putting things away, called out. “It’s a bunch of cold stuff, wouldn’t want it to spoil.”
Natasha hummed sceptically, rubbing her hands on the barre as she finished he final stretches. “So you pounce on everyone?”
was engaging him. It was like he was in the suit, except he had no barrier against the outside world, not metal hugging his body, protecting him.
either.  Natasha timed her steps which each hit of the bag, using it to hide the sound of her movement. She leant to the side and clutched the bag with force, stopping the bags movements and so forcing Steve to stop too.
Which brought down the mood instantly.
untouchable?
“You haven’t-”
They were out of the woods now.
the right way to warm your face, without shining obnoxiously in your eyes. It was the most serene way to wake up.
Natasha wondered how long it would take the rest of them to find out. She winked at Thor who smiled softly back. They could discuss it later.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and Thor, standing on his tip toes to walk between them. “We’re under the café I think, or the green house next to it. No one above will notice this is here.”
Tony raised an eyebrow, trying not to laugh, only Peter would forget about his secret identity. “Oh, you did kid, did you.”
Then it happened again.
“We can’t take the armour off of him Steve,” Clint said, he was looking at the suit with almost a critical gaze. “Would you even be able to sustain it?”
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
“It was nice seeing you FRIDAY.”
“By all accounts it should do Boss,” Friday said. “However if you are planning on going out, wouldn’t it be more convenient to just buy some pancakes?”
of us?” Clint asked.
but he didn’t sound upset by it. Steve didn’t know what to make of it.
“They’re known as the ‘mile-per-minute’ vine.” he said to Steve, continuing what Natasha had been saying. He paused for a moment, blushing slightly. “But also – I,” He sighed, gathering his thoughts, “when I was building this bit, I was in charge of it, and well – I was kind of, no, I
“It’s okay,” Tony said. “You caught me.”
“What’s next week?” Tony asked.
FRIDAY materialised on the sofa reserved for Tony and Steve, and snorted. “Obviously, and of course Doctor Banner.”
“FRI, do I have some cash anywhere?”
“No!” Steve said, “of course not.”
Bruce shrugged. “Hmm, add that it will have something to do with flowers.”
Tony smiled softly. “I didn’t know that’s why you did that, thank you.”
“I can’t believe you betted on us getting together.” Tony said, but it held no malice. A goofy grin stretched across his face, and Steve wore a similar one.
Thor nodded and gently shrugged Tony off. “Interesting.”
“And those?” Clint asked as they stumbled to the side of a dirt path, which wasn’t the right way to where they were going according to Bruce – who had the map, but none of them really minded. He pointed at a collection of gorgeous pink and yellow flowers with a yellow centre.
“Now,” Natasha said, sitting to face him and taking his left hand, “are you going to tell me why you have decided that destroying your hands is the best thing to do with your day today?”
Natasha sighed, passing them the second bowl she had made. “He really wont.”
Making pancakes was all Tony could think of. He saddled up next to Steve mentally mixed and matched ingredients like he did when building, adding just the right baking powder to help the dough rise, and a third of a cup of buttermilk instead of normal milk to help kick start the baking powder and make the pancakes more tender and fluffy.
of work to do. It was a couple of days until Christmas, which meant the latest StarkPhone software update needed to roll out within the next couple of hours. That is, if they wanted ample time to give out holiday bonuses and give everyone actual, decent breaks.
Tony had a hickey.
“I stole his shield once.” Peter said.
“You obsess over your mistakes, and so force the rest of us to as well, even though we either don’t think it’s that big a deal, or don't think it actually matters in the first place. Tony, whatever you did as a dumb 20 something year old can be forgiven with everything you have done now to help those you once hurt.
Steve propped his bike on the stand. “It just seems to be clutch cable and chain, they can often blow out at the same time if you’re not careful,” he said after careful inspection. “I can replace the chain, easy, I’ve got the parts in the saddlebags, but the clutch cable has snapped…” he looked sheepishly at Tony. “We might just have to go without.”
Huh. “Okay,” he said. “Yeah – no, yeah. That could be fun.”
Steve worried his lip. “Well yeah, I – I got it on a whim. I was jogging home and at the traffic lights, there was this man selling roses, and I thought, well,
Steve smiled softly, stroking Tony’s cheekbone with his thumb. “For years, Tony. Why do you think I have a sketchbook filled with drawings of you?”
could see the joke coming a mile away. How were these idiots so dense? “I – um, no, you’re right. It’s, it’s not the right thing to do.”  Clint was never winning the bet.
“I’ll be there in about…” Tony checked his watch, jogging towards the elevator to go to his floor. “20 minutes –
They didn’t.
of chronic gambling.”
Natasha almost rolled her eyes, this speech felt like deja-vu
Tony nodded, pulling Steve down beside him, who was staring dumbly at their still interlocked hands. “I promise you Thor,” Tony was saying, “you want dinosaurs after we’ve watched the trilogy, I can get an island.”
Various tubes and beeping machines connected to almost every inch of Tony’s body, Steve couldn’t begin to interpret what each one did or what it meant. His eyes roamed Tony face, searching for something Steve didn’t know, couldn’t understand, but wanted to find either way.
Steve tsked. “Tony, he’s the president, you can’t just replace his statue with a pumpkin.”
“Reagan still would’ve played a hand in Webb’s death though.” Tony replied.
Tony’s heart melted, this girl was so kind. “Whatever’s easiest for you, honestly. I don’t have that far of a walk.”
“Tony,” Steve repeated. “You dropped everything to help
Tony blinked, absorbing what Steve had said. He took a moment to process it, to recognise the change of tone, how sincere Steve had been. Steve had complimented him, not necessarily on his intelligence, but on how he utilises his intelligence and improves on it, which was –
Tony shrugged. “It’s because I liked him enough to not make it Katniss, and we all knew the Hunger Games craze was going to die,” Tony paused for a moment, he couldn’t believe he was suggesting this, he wasn’t even sure if he was serious. “Before we watch Lord of the Rings though, we need to watch the Hobbit Trilogy.”
switch it off, it was
“You just have to stay true to yourself, true to your heart, and you’ll excel.” Steve added, and Tony grinned at him.
Natasha opened Bruce’s bar next. “So Bruce, you bet $50 that they would get together in March, but you have no circumstances as to how or why. Confident in adding any yet?”
“And we’ve been friends ever since.” Kamala said.
Tony looked at him aghast. “You gave me a hickey.”
“Huh.” Tony said, because he didn’t really know how to reply to that. The markets were somewhere he had admittedly, never been to before, Tony had, had no need to go there. He wasn’t really sure what to expect, or what to bring, or what to wear. Would his disguise be enough, should he shave, would he need to –
Clint shrugged, shuffling so the top half of his body was hanging upside down from the ledge reaching his hand out to shuffle the un-popped kernels along. “I’m trying out nicknames.”
And in that time, she had created an iron man armour,
Tony smiled at that, he had made them happy, he had engaged with those kids, and now he was what, friends with them, a mentor of sorts?
bag repetitively, rattling the string that hung it. The coarse jingling sound echoed through the otherwise quiet room, it was almost deafening in the silence. Natasha leant against the doorframe, staring dumbly, she knew Steve’s revelation would rattle him, but she didn’t think it would result in
“And I know he cares about me, but it’s just like how he cares about all of us. You, Bruce, Clint, Thor, Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, FRIDAY, his bots. He loves us all so much, I know that, but he loves us in the sense that we’re his family. He doesn’t love us – me, in any sort of way that could signify anything more. And I don’t blame him.
Natasha almost recoiled as she entered the gym, it was a sore sight. He was stood in the centre, a pile of torn through punching bags stacked pathetically in the corner. Bloody knuckles pounded the current
Clint hummed. “Next movie night!”
“With Natasha’s 40, and my 60, I believe that is 100 dollars from each of you.” Thor said with a grin.
“And you didn’t tell us?” Steve said.
“Does the corner store at the end of the street still take card?”
“Why do you need a disguise anyway, we’re just going down the road.”
Natasha hummed. “He never has for me.”
Tony frowned, his heart leaping into his throat. “A different idea? Besides driving?”
“I know that idiot cares about me, he shouldn’t, but he does, just like the rest of you. But I -  if I confessed how I felt, god, he would be so good about it. He would be sweet, he would let me down gently and ensure that were still friends.”
“It’s a Russian idiom. It means that you can’t control who you love. If you love him, who’s to say he doesn’t love back, or isn’t capable of loving you back? Would he stop being your friend just because you confessed your feelings?”
Tony and Steve had certainly been friends, Tony could say that with certainty now. The things they had gone through together, the work they had done together, the things they had caused both because of that and despite it, that had cemented a relationship that would always be important to Tony. They
“Wednesday then?” Natasha suggested.  Bruce sighed.
“The Boss won’t be free either,” FRIDAY said. “He’s got a dinner meeting with some new investors. Pepper’s been on his arse about it for weeks, it’s actually really rather funny.”
Steve grunted as she poked and prodded. “Don’t pretend you don’t know.”
It’s funny, what perspective does to person. Before Thanos, Tony wouldn’t of gone near Steve – he
Natasha almost rolled her eyes, now she was
Natasha waved a hand towards their sofa. “Sit down, the movie’s playing.”
“Then there’s me, I stand to the side. It’s like I’m there, but I’m not at the forefront, you know. He has so much, he
Was it even his place to do this, to set up a meeting between the two. He was going off the bat that she would like to meet Captain America. Five years ago, it would have been a sure fire idea that anyone would want to meet him, but now, well, Tony wasn’t so sure. As Emine had mentioned, Thanos and the Accords weren’t yet a distant memory.
“Wait, apprentice? Sam, how exactly are you an apprentice.”
Then he blinked, composed himself, and dug his spoon out of his bowl. The moment was over, and no one else had been any the wiser.
The man went nuts for them.
Bruce, busy stuffing four five dollar notes into his pocket said. “You cannot possibly know that it’s next week.”
“Don’t let them know we call them the super-idiots.” Thor said.
Tony groaned. “I fucking know, right.”
Pancakes.
“Oh, so nothing changed then?” Tony said. “I remember Stern.”

The door opened to a Steve Rogers with windswept blonde hair (Tony forced himself not to think about Steve clinging to Thor on the way over,

Tony laughed, his face lighting up as he kissed Steve again, “I can’t believe this.”
.” He rubbed a hand behind his neck. “It was just like how my mother used to make it.”
Kamala squinted at Steve for a moment, and Tony enjoyed how her face morphed from indifference, to confusion, to realisation in the span of two seconds. “You’re Captain America.” She breathed.
Dum-E swung his head to the side, like a huff, before rolling over to his corner. “Oh don’t sulk,” Tony cried, scrambling after. “You know you deserve that. You almost broke my blender!”
Steve stifles a sob. “Yeah, Shellhead,” he says. “We had the best.”
Steve was grinning back, and it was in that moment that Tony realised he was friends with her, that he was most likely friends with every seller in this market.
he wasn’t going to die, but, but-
“Oh!” Peter said. “I came in here at one point last year after I left the mansion, and Kamala and I pretty much geeked out for two hours.”
“You almost died-” Steve choked, and his heart shattered into two. Every emotion he had absorbed, every thought he had, had burst. Steve cried, exhaustion collapsing him. Tony had almost
“This is what you wanted to show me?” Steve asked, coming to his side.
Tony swallowed, Emine’s words sinking in. This is the place Steve had started coming to, to connect with his past. Markets, bartering, people with shared memories, of course this would be his safe place, his happy place.
he doesn’t love you back, sure it’ll be awkward, but you’ll get over it. And if he
“Besides, this place is so close to Avengers Mansion,” Tony said as he walked back up to the counter. “What if one of them comes in wanting to make pancakes?”
“Actually…” Bruce said, his eyes glued to his wallet as he fished out the notes. “The back door was unlocked the entire time.”
eyes – yeah. They knew.
, because of your tendency for a self-deprecating streak of idiocy. The moment he decided to care about you – in any capacity, is the moment you became good enough for him, because it’s not up to you to decide that, to make that decision for him. It’s up to him.
“Yeah,” Natasha said, “you’re stopping that.”
Clint eyed them carefully. “Abort, this was a terrible plan, they’re even worse now that they’re together.”
“Don’t do too much,” Natasha warned, “flowers are vague, especially with Tony concerned.”
“Uh…” Tony’s brain short circuited. This had
Tony did look healthier, however. His skin was warmer, there was colour to his cheeks, it was almost as if… As if Tony still had some colour for himself.
Tony glanced down at his clothes in confusion, then back at Steve. “What do you mean? This is my
Which in this case, was definitely valid.
Bruce sighed. “And what is that, Thor.”
he didn’t say. Steve never had to know about that stage of Tony’s life, it was
Steve shot Tony a look. “I’m not about to go destroy your house just because we can’t open a door,” He picked the bag back up off of the floor. “The wood is
Steve shrugged, knocking his hand a bit. Natasha steadied it, but otherwise ignored it. “You noticed it at breakfast.” He said.
“Yes.
Steve cocked his head to the side, a look of hope on Steve’s face.
Clint blinked slowly. “Do I
Natasha dabbed the antiseptic a little harder to shut him up. “If you don’t clean this out and aid the healing, then your body will mess up the healing process. Think of skin growing in the wrong place, blood clotting and forming a longer lasting bruise, that sort of thing. Sure, it
Tony chuckled, touché. “Alright, Scotty, patch ‘er through.”
Tony gave a small smile, feeling – well, feeling more optimistic than he had in a while. “Yeah Steve, we will.”
“It’s why it’s law now that you can’t do more than two terms, because the republicans didn’t want to be run in a ‘Democratic Party Police State’, so they changed the law after he died.”
“Don’t disregard his own decision making skills, his own
“Speaking of bets,” Thor said, “I believe there’s something wrong with the phone Tony.”
Natasha hummed, placing his hand on the table and taking his right hand.
what I was designed to do. I feel like I’d have an unfair advantage if I got involved, since I can see everything and control, well, most of everything.”
Natasha stilled her fingers on the table, she had no need to worry.
He no longer felt safe.
“Steve, it doesn’t have to be extravagant. Like I said, cater it towards the individual, do something you know will make him happy.”
The girl fiddling with the machine whipped a fruit box from her side, humming over the straw at her mouth as she followed Kamala’s gaze. “Oh, sorry guys, we’re just fixing the eftpos machine. It won’t be a minute.”
“Yeah, you’re right. I shouldn’t be surprised.”  “My point is, you didn’t lose Rhodey did you, you’re closer than ever.”
A man who trusted him, and who Tony trusted in return.
Steve tried the door. “It’s locked.”
Steve flicked some sauce at Tony as he went to taste the curry he had on the stove. “Nope, you don’t get to taste it until it’s done.”
As soon as Steve let him, Tony poured the spinach and tomato into the pot, watching in fascination as the Spinach shrivelled into half its size, and the tomato blended seemingly into the rest of the curry. “
“What plant is that?” Steve asked, pointing at the vines on the columns that opened the archway. His tone was subdued, as if he was taking it all in as well. Natasha wasn’t surprised, it wasn’t common to see 1930’s art deco anymore, he was probably being reminded of home, too.
Steve pulled out a red rose. “I got this.”
Steve’s eyes grew slightly. “Oh, well, only if you want -,” he sighed, “Yes, I am. Do you want to come to the markets with me?”
The early morning air was rather cold, and Tony was grateful that his getup included a hoodie. The streets were calm at this hour, so Tony was free to be more at ease. He passed a pair of teenagers sitting on the curb whilst waiting for the bus, and so pulled his cap lower on his head and readjusted his the hood to conceal his face. It was odd seeing anyone out this early, especially in Manhattan at 7am on a Sunday, but FRIDAY – through his glasses, told him that they weren’t a threat. Their heartrates were normal and they seemed at ease.
“I was going to break the front door.” Steve said.
Steve held out his hand, and Tony almost had flashbacks. “Do you trust me?”
Steve snorted. “You never met Pierce though, he was worse.”
that I’ll confess, and then I’ll gradually lose him. That something will permanently shift between us in a way we could never come back from. This rising
“I did not know about this specific plan.”
Even from the bike the market seemed busy. Packs of cars lined the carpark and people seemed to mill in between them like they were suburb streets, parents chatting as children played, couples eating as they wandered back to their car. It was less like a carpark, and more like a communal gathering point, that just so happened to have cars.
. Prove that you know him well enough, and that you’re willing to put in the time and energy to make him happy. ‘Honouring him’ – as you put it, has nothing to do what anyone else has done in the past, and focuses on what you’re doing now. Just, respect him, and keep loving him, and you’re fine.” Natasha almost cringed,
She squeezed his hands in reassurance.“
“He was lucky, the blow was mostly knocked off course, only one of his kidneys was punctured, and our best doctor was conveniently free,” Christine said. “He's a brain surgeon actually, so for him this was, and I quote, ‘a walk in the park’.”
“They’re probably arguing.” Clint said. “Explains why Tony was holed up in his workshop in the first place.”
His head was spinning; he simply couldn’t understand. Tony knew Steve’s sketchbook was private, that he didn’t want anyone seeing the contents inside. It was like Steve’s diary, an intimate collection of all his innermost thoughts and feelings. And he had left it here, in Tony’s workshop – Tony’s
Tony cackled. “That’s brilliant.”
Steve tried the door handle again, rattling it, but it wouldn’t budge.
“In the workshop,” Tony continued, obviously thinking Steve’s nod translated into a prompting, “asleep at my work bench, with the holograms, talking to JARVIS, spinning in my chair when I get a good idea, dancing along to whatever music you let me blast through my speakers, on the sofa with DUM-E trying to tuck me in,” Tony’s voice grew smaller, “my smile, my eyes, my hands.”
Her eyes twinkled as she gazed back at Steve. “Eggs. You came all the way out here for some eggs?”
Natasha hummed before hanging up. Always a pleasant woman.
For once, Tony should be speechless.
“They do this every week.” Natasha added, although, she was secretly hoping tonight was a little bit different.
Clint walked under the arch way gazing up at the purple flowers that headed it. “Hey I recognise these! What’re they called?”
Kamala nodded. “I can put the eggs in a separate one? And have a bag for the milk and flour, and a bag for the juice? It should make it easier to carry.”
“C’mon,” he gestured with his hands. “Head up.”
Clint still wasn’t right though, it’s not like it was freezing or anything.
Tony looked desolate for a moment before sighing. “Fuck it, I’ve already messed everything up between us anyway.”
Tony had to admit, Steve’s lovingly restored 1942 Harley-Davidson WLA Liberator was unbelievable,
FRIDAY paused, most likely scanning his timetable. “He should be.”
With the speed Steve raced to the bathroom with though, Tony somehow doubted that.”
“Are you kidding?” Steve asked. “They had pretty much forgotten I was there, it was all about you. Hell, that girl made a suit because of how much you had inspired her.”
Tony gave a small, dopey smile. “Yeah, he does stuff like that a lot.”
Natasha was chuckling too. “Was it the flower?”
Steve couldn’t breathe, Tony was here, he was alive, he was safe, and he was looking at Steve like he didn’t want to look at anything else.
Steve sighed, the anger leaching from his body and replaced with wicked shame. He forcibly unfolded his arms, swallowing in a guise to loosen his jaw. Hesitantly, he walked over to pick up his book, noticing Tony flinch away slightly, as if believing Steve would lash out at him. In all honesty Steve probably had the right, but right now he was too embarrassed to care. “What did you see?” He asked, barely surprised in how timid is voice was.
At least according to Steve.
out there.” (3)
“You’re amazing,” Clint said, with more life in his eyes than Steve had noticed since they arrived. “Thank you for saving him.”
After a week, Lt. Colonel Rhodes, ‘Rhodey, please Steve, we’re not on duty, and technically, you’re not in the Army anymore’, arrived with a collection of clothes for Tony – including a new hoodie.
She shook the thoughts from her mind, running a hand through her hair to tuck the loose strands behind her ears. She was proud of this dish. It brought a soft smile to her face and warmed her soul. Judging by the way Thor was stuffing his face with it, it tasted good too. She rolled her eyes in amusement, she was reminded of safety, of home.  And she felt pretty much at home here.
It brings forth a number of moments and flashes, each one brighter than the previous, even though Steve knows some of their moments were dark. But looking back at their discography… it’s hard to see anything that dims its brilliance. He and Tony shine as bright as a phoenix.
Each of the Avengers had come sat vigil with him at some time or another. At one point Pepper had physically moved Steve from his chair and Thor had taken him home so he would shower, change, and get some sleep.
“And we’re all still in school!” Miles said with a bright smile.
Natasha took a shuddering breath, running a hand along a window that cut into the hedge, it could have been taken straight out of her childhood house. This place, it reminded her of St. Petersburg – of home.
“Yeah, actually Peter, why are you here?” Tony asked, genuinely curious, because not that he didn’t love the kid – he did, but he hadn’t been expecting to see Peter late on a Sunday morning in a corner store down Fifth Avenue.
“So every time you take his hand, or make him breakfast…”
Tony gave an awkward, solitary nod. “Lead the way solider.”
Steve nodded, not willing himself to speak. Tony hadn’t sounded angry or mocking, and Steve didn’t trust himself to pick out what other emotion Tony could be feeling. It gave him hope – and there was no place in his heart for that.
Tony latched onto Steve’s hand. “Follow me,” he said, “I want to show you my favourite part.”
it was to be around Steve. Everything about Steve was easy. The man was funny, witty, with that incredible dry sense of humour that made Tony go weak in the knees. He was intelligent, and kind, and Tony hadn’t been this happy in such a long time.
“I’ll find out.” Natasha said.
, that Tony’s colour was gone. Steve had taken Tony’s colour, consumed it like it was his own, because Tony had been so open, and been so willing to give it to him, and Steve had been greedy, taken everything he could get.
Tony took a chance glimpse at Steve, who was observing the flamboyant scene with a grin on his face. Tony couldn’t help his own smile stretch onto his face. This was Steve’s place, this was something Steve knew, and apparently, found joy in.
Tony had always wanted Steve to care about him like Tony cared about Steve, but they had never allowed it. Tony’s hand ghosted over the long curved scar across his chest. A morning alone with Steve would be intimidating, confusing, and…
Because that was part of Steve’s draw, he was the kind of man you wants to remember, the kind of man you could grow old with an say, ah, yes, he was a true love of mine.
. Zemo had been right, up this close, there was some green in the blue of Steve’s eyes. But saying that his eyes were green and blue was like saying the sun was yellow. It was sufficient, but not accurate to capture the starlit fire within them.
“Not really,” FRIDAY said with a shrug, “I just find your reactions incredibly interesting.”
“Ooh yes, a movie marathon when we all have wicked food coma’s!” Clint said, taking a handful of popcorn, “Love Actually, Valentine’s Day, The Lorax, The Giver.”
Natasha didn’t like Monday’s. Not because of some capitalist
Tony turned his gaze to Bruce. “You knew?”
“No,” Natasha snorted, “evidently you wouldn’t." Natasha sighed. “Look Steve,
, and Sunset only wanted my tech’s secrets. Rumiko was, well, that’s a story and a half, and every single time, they betrayed me, they hurt me. Well, with Stone it was probably a good thing he left because
Tony rolled his eyes. Ridiculous.
Tony collapsed into the space next to her. “Rhodey is currently off on some super-secret mission with the Air-Force, Pepper has blocked my calls for another two days – don’t ask, and you’re the only other person I could think of whose sane enough to talk about this with; and, quite frankly, I’ve been sitting on this for months now and I think I might just explode.”
Steve looked as if his world had been turned on its head – which, Natasha judged, it probably had been. His eyes had grown wide, and were glued to Tony’s forehead. His spoon clattered into his bowl and was sinking into his forgotten porridge. Natasha would reprimand him if she didn’t have an inkling of what was running through Steve’s mind at that moment. He was shaking his head slightly, as if in awe, or as though he couldn’t quite believe it what he was thinking, what he had realised. It was most likely both.
U knocked the table slightly in curiosity. “He’s sulking over there,” Tony waved his hand in Dum-E’s general direction. “You can go over if you want.”
Natasha almost groaned. Damn that man was an idiot. “Give it to him, if you have something for you he’ll let you in.”
“You shouldn’t have looked through it.” Steve said, not allowing himself to say anything else. Like; what did Tony think, what could it mean, why Tony liked them. Questions like that only bought answers that made Steve’s head spin, and his growing feelings for Tony couldn’t handle the inevitable rejection like that. The leering, the anger, that was sure to come – because Steve had basically been drawing stalker pictures of his best friend.
Now, Natasha didn’t often admit she was wrong. She wasn’t often wrong, and when she was, it was for good reason, so she had no need to recognise when she was wrong. She prided herself on knowing what others can’t know, of predicting things that others couldn’t, and for controlling the pieces in the game to give her the result she desired. So for months she had assumed that Tony was like Steve, in love but just too oblivious to realise it. She had had no reason to assume otherwise. For the entirety of when she had been aware they were in love with each other, she hadn’t seen Tony’s behaviour change and she couldn’t pin point a time beforehand that his behaviour had changed. Nothing had been suggested that he didn’t know.
Tony focused on his gut, thinking about asking Steve for a favour, asking him for anything, didn’t cause his chest to tighten with worry. There was no invisible cord slinking it’s way into his lungs and cutting off air supply, and there was no rock growing and hardening in his gut. He was completely…
Steve’s heart lurched. “What do you mean by feelings?”
Tony came beside Natasha and squeezed her shoulder, obviously not fooled.
“Wait,” Bruce said, “Tony left the workshop?”
Tony was the first to pull away, heaving for breath as he rested into Steve, their foreheads resting against each other. This close, Steve could feel Tony’s heartbeat, an erratic staccato, like an antelope racing for the sheer sake of it. Steve supposed his heart was acting similar. Tony looked up at Steve, his face flushed and lips bruised and raw. Steve’s breath caught in his throat, he didn’t think he had seen anything more beautiful than this. “Thanks for humouring me.” Tony said. His eyes glowed but he looked so heartbroken, as if Steve was going to leave. Tony looked away swallowing, speaking so quietly Steve was sure he wasn’t supposed to have heard. “You’ve always been too good to me.”
Tony paused on his slow trek back to the mansion. Steve? Tony hadn’t asked Steve for any favours since Thanos, but that was a
Steve was blushing. “I um, yeah.”
For weeks he had been dragging various friends (mostly Steve) to different nurseries, even overseas. If Natasha had been bothered to find out why, she would have. But quite frankly, she didn’t
Tony groaned. “We’re on speaker, J, you put us on speaker, didn’t you.”
“Now hold on,” Natasha said, holding out a hand, “Tony, did you have to chase Steve down?”
Steve chuckled, slipping his phone into his pocket. Tony envied him, Steve was so clearly comfortable, it made Tony squirm. “Yeah, well, this guy I know made this newfangled device easier to use, probably because he’s getting older himself.”
Steve lifted his head up, brushing the tears off of Tony’s wobbling chin. “I love you.”
And Tony had loved every second.
“That’s a terrible disguise,” Steve giggled when Tony arrived back in the kitchen, their ingredients haphazardly strewn on the kitchen bench.
The other girl physically spat out her juice, staring point blank at Tony. “I’m sorry, you’re
Tony was in love with Steve.
“You have to remember Tony, most of us are old enough to remember the war. My country was neutral during the war, but that does not mean the people were. We lived on the border near Bulgaria so even though we were safe in Turkey, we felt first-hand the effects of Bulgaria’s anti-Jew sentiments and laws, especially when they joined the axis in 1941.
, thinking of all of you, as I made this.”
So they bought the buttermilk and took a variety of selfies, individual ones, them as pairs, group ones, every single combination. Peter even took a selfie with Steve – because, again, Steve technically hadn’t met Peter yet.
, and looked up to find Steve sitting on the bed, staring at him with wide eyes. Tony looked down – oh. The scars. Steve was staring at his scars.
Tony gave a slow, tentative grin back. He was going to be making pancakes,
“I volunteered to stay behind,” Steve said with a small, almost cautious smile. “I didn’t want you to get here and find yourself alone.”
Emine snorted. “You can tell.”
“Thor,” Steve asked. “Are the others making you do damage control?”
“Yeah and maybe after this we can do that Star Wars marathon you promised me.”
God Tony loved that man.
. “Well, not like that, but, well, yes, I am. I just need a 20, and I can transfer you the money back like, right now, I just need cash basically and I can’t be bothered walking a block and a half to the nearest ATM machine.”
“Well, you put that into my report so…”
It was loud, and vibrant, and there wasn’t a place that didn’t have
Steve hissed. “Nat, it will heal on its own, do you really have to -”
life, and I’m – well, I’m just a lucky kid from Brooklyn that ran into the right scientist at the right time.
“We had a good run, didn’t we, Winghead?” Tony asks. His voice is slow, almost—
And there Steve was again, going and making Tony’s heart melt.
Tuesday was nerve wracking. Natasha hadn’t heard anything from Tony – he had locked himself in the workshop, and Steve was everywhere and nowhere. She had taken herself to the dance studio to calm her nerves. It was less about winning the bet now and more about the fact that Tony and Steve could be barrelling towards a catastrophically disastrous blow up that she would have to solve.
Steve shook his head, smiling fondly. “Only you would wear a blazer and think it’s casual.”
“It’s different for everyone Steve, you’ve got to cater it specifically to Tony. There’s the generic stuff, chocolate, movies, dinner, all the Valentine’s Day crap. It depends on him, and you would know more about what he likes than I would.”
Tony Stark?”
Her face pulled into a frown. “Oh sir, um, we’re only taking cash right now. The eftpos machine is down – my friend’s coming over a bit later to fix it, but um, until then, it’s cash,” she looked rather sheepish, “there’s a sign on the door.”
known. But she wasn’t going to tell him that. “So, if you’ve known for months now, why is it only now that it’s becoming too much to handle?”
“Oh no Steve, I wanted to show Tony around a couple of stalls, the poor boy seems overwhelmed.”
Tony let out a breath and passed them inconspicuously, the kids didn’t so much as glance his way.
“No,” Steve said, bundling his clothes. “You didn’t overstep Tony, not at all.”
Clint would sit beside Tony, playing a video game and telling Tony about it.
.” Tony explained, gesturing to the plants around the bench, “I couldn’t really think of anything that represented you more.”
Natasha had never seen anything like it. He had dived into the project like
“Bill Clinton,” Bruce said, walking ahead of the others. It was a smart move, Natasha wasn’t interested in seeing any sort of argument between Tony and Clint.
Tony hummed, turning away from talking to Steve to see what Thor had been looking at. “Oh!” he said, dragging Steve with him as he walked over to Tony. Clint snickered beside Natasha, whilst Bruce took some photo’s on his phone, feigning that they were of plants. “That’s an
The group froze, staring at the purple blotch slowly growing darker on Tony’s neck.
And that was the question, wasn’t it. How long had Tony loved him? He tried to think of an answer, he did, but he couldn’t think of an exact time where it wasn’t true, where it wasn’t the case. It was perpetual, he had just been to blind to see.
“Wait,” Steve said, completely ignoring Tony’s excellent pun. “What is this bet anyway?”
It had been a look Tony had seen a lot in his life, but not a lot recently, which was… A lot of things really. “Please,” Steve said. “Call me Steve.”
.” Natasha said before Tony could respond, her hand grazing over the leaves. She had recognised them immediately. For a moment she was brutally reminded of her and her cousins pulling them out of the vegetable garden and stacking them by the wall. It was a nice memory.  She covered up the appreciation she had with an ire that she wasn’t feeling. “Which is idiotic, may I remind you Tony. They grow fast, grow everywhere, and are almost indestructible.”
want us to make dinosaurs after… we’ll talk.”
(That was the most logical reason, after all)
sometimes she couldn’t believe the conversations she shimmied into.
“This feels almost like it’s an historic moment. Steve Rogers is introducing Tony Stark to something new in the 21
“We could start without them?” Clint suggested, pouring his microwave popcorn packet into a bowl.
Tony Stark.” The girl gave a pointed look towards Peter.
“Yup.”
Tony had always known Steve was attractive, it was both an objective, and subjective fact of life. Steve had been made to be the physical peak of human perfection, so that would evidently mean he was the peak of attractive beauty. Steve had that kind of ruggard, apple pie sort of charm, the kind that made you want to ask softly if we were going to Scarborough Fair, and what will we do when they get there.
Tony frowned at Natasha momentarily. “That’s probably because you like to pretend to be a closed book. Anyway. He spends time with me, he listens to me, he lets me go on for hours about new ideas and talk about whatever it is I’m working on. And it’s exhausting and exhilarating all at the same time. Each new idea, each new though that passed through my mind, each new adventure or moment I just have to share with him, I don’t know how to not let that closeness, that bond, infiltrate the entirety of my heart.
“I know.” Tony replied, and he sounded so broken, so lost, as if he too believed this was the end. “I just – when it fell it opened on a random page and it was just so beautiful that I- I couldn’t stop.”
Emine tsked. “Steve has come here every Saturday since 2012 – barring that awful business with the accords, and he had never brought another person with him. He’s spoken about friends, James, Sam – apparently I remind him of Natasha,” Tony snorted, yeah, he could picture that. “But never,” she continued, “has he brought them down. It’s like we’re his own personal separate world,
And it wasn’t as if Natasha underestimated Clint or his deduction skills, Natasha trusted him almost above all else for a reason. It’s just… they were plants. It would have been more up Bruce’s field, or even Tony’s.
Steve froze in the doorway, eyeing Tony carefully. He was hunched over one of the tables in his workshop, pressing a battered workbook close to his chest with trembling hands. Steve eyed it warily, realisation settling in his gut.
Natasha grinned, patting Thor on the knee. “Of course buddy.”
Riri was practically beaming at Tony. “You think so?”
gone near him. The most communication he had, had with Steve was through proxy with Vision and Wanda, to help set up their little rendezvous. The accords, Siberia, his parents… Steve had almost broken Tony, and it had taken so long, and taken so much work, to bring himself to a sense of, not ease necessarily, but complacency moving forward with his life.
Bruce leant over to Natasha, his eyes on Tony, who still had his arm wrapped around Steve. “Is it too late to change my bet?”
Steve hummed. “Well, actually, if we have no eggs, there’s always the markets?”
Nat, and I’m… well, I’m me.”
So I got it. And now I have it.”
So, honestly, Siberia seemed so trivial now, that it didn’t really matter. Tony had moved on, and it was no longer a place in his life that held any sort of weight to him.
Dum-E turned his claw head petulantly towards Tony, stopping so suddenly anyone else might have thought Dum-E had broken. All was silent as Tony held his breath. Three. Two.
“You have the best eggs Emine,” Steve said, taking a carton. “Of course we came all the way out for them.”
Natasha nodded, including the note, and then opened Clint’s. His name flashed a harsh red, his deadline date – today, glowing an angry yellow. “Clint, betting a week before Valentines Day. You still have time to back out, then you don’t owe us a cent when you lose.”
“It might be, that’s what I’m going to find out.”
Tony shrugged. “Just watch,” he said, before dramatically parting them to the side, revealing a cave.
comes out alright.”
“Right, do you want to put what we bought away – except the eggs and flour, and I’ll grab the rest of the ingredients?”
Thor sat beside Tony, leaving Mijonir at the foot of the bed, ‘for extra protection’.
Tony looked like a deer caught in headlight as he stared at Steve, incapable of replying. “I-I don’t…”
“Yeah that’s true.” Kamala said.
Natasha hummed. “I’m not sure, you’re friends – good friends, and that’s a solid foundation for a successful relationship, but I can’t differentiate between what you’re doing now and what you need to do differently. That’s what you need to do – you need Tony to realise that he’s special to you, more so than the rest of us.”
, is when it comes from a place that’s pure and genuine. Steve, you don’t have to change how you act, just be more obvious about it.”
“How come?”
“No.” FRIDAY said, she closed the table. “Look, you have the choice in whether you know or not, I
FRIDAY was playing with their Superidiot Bet Table whilst they waited on Steve and Tony to show up, a smirk permanently plastered on her face. Natasha drummed her fingers on the table whilst they waited – that smirk could mean anything.
who bought the place for them.
Steve hated this, he hated waiting.
Bruce panted over the comms. "I can head to the quinjet, and bring it over."
“How else?”
But Tony had no other way to describe that look.
to ask for money a day in his life – which probably said a lot about him that Tony didn’t want to acknowledge at this hour in the morning. “You’re asking me… for money?” Steve said.
Not that he would let it get to his head.
He gave the flower to Natasha. “I saw how you were looking at it.” He said softly, walking past.
to know why they had to go to so many nurseries all over the globe. Most probably it had to do with supply and demand, but when Tony got passionate about something, he also boarded over the edge of an eccentric rich man, so Natasha often avoided it. (1)
“Romano.”
Natasha slung her bag over her shoulder. “There’s no rules saying I can’t.”
Tony dragged himself out of bed – again, and stumbled towards his walk in closet. He pulled on his nearest hoodie – which was left dangling on the back of the closets door, and a pair of pants that were left in the corner beside them.  The hoodie was his old ratty MIT one – well, it was Rhodey’s technically, but Tony had stolen it and so by law it was rightfully his now.
Bruce was curled on a bench, which was surrounded by small trees, looking at the garden with a soft, serene expression. “That’s, that’s really sweet Tony.”
“Love Actually is a Christmas movie.” Bruce said.  “And The Lorax?” Natasha said, “You just started listing movies Taylor Swift is in.”  They waited until Clint had finished chewing. “There’s romance in those movies too!” Clint defended.  “I’m sorry but I won’t be here for that,” Thor said. “I will be spending the day with Jane.”
He pulled out a pan for Steve. “Here, so you can make your eggs.”
“There’s been more than one!”
Thor hummed in agreement.  They neared Trumps statue – or, where it was supposed to be.  “Is that a pumpkin in lieu of Trumps statue?” Steve asked, staring at the pumpkin in front of him.
Steve grinned. “Of course not.”
No, that would be absurd. Steve would say something, he was the type of person who would. Besides, it wouldn’t ruin their friendship or anything, Steve wouldn’t let it.
Clint scoffed. “We’re all third wheeling a glorified date in a couple of hours, I’ll be fine.”
Steve almost forgot his embarrassment as anger flared inside him again, for a completely different reason. “Good enough?” Steve said, scandalised, “Tony you’re more than good enough,
“Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are giving us life advice, I never thought this would happen in my life ever.”
“Still though,” Steve said. “It’s an incredibly generous thing to do. I’ve never had a Christmas as nice as this before, and I don’t think many of the others have either.”
Tony rubbed the back of his neck, not surprised at all that she knew exactly who he was, that’s what he got for ditching the disguise, anonymity was almost a foreign concept for Tony. “Truth be told, this is my first time.”
Steve gasped, before jolting away. “Oh God Tony I’m sorry,” he said before Tony had time to process what he’d heard, before he had time to even open his freakin eyes. “I didn’t realise you were awake.”
Which to anyone with half an eye, was completely obvious.
Without permission.
, just hanging between us. Every interaction, every glance, every conversation, some moment that would mean something different for me than it would for him would happen, and we would just be hammered by this thing over and over again until it becomes too much. Steve wouldn’t leave like that,” Tony snapped his fingers together, “he would be a stubborn ass about it and stick around as long as he could. But it would weigh on him, it would weigh on me.
Steve’s jaw hurt as he stared, incapable of moving. He was mortified, frozen on the spot. He could feel his face burn ugly and fierce, like a hot stove, could
“Long enough,” Natasha said. She looked down at his hands and winced. They were mangled beyond recognition. Steve’s flesh was bruised and mattered, blood poking out through the rips and tears in his skin. “Come on, we’re cleaning this up.”
Huh. Maybe this standoffish behaviour was why kids hated him.
He kept steeling minute glances at his thumb, opting to carry his plate with his left hand instead of his right as he came to the table. So he’d hurt himself.
Tony forced himself to relax, burying himself into Steve’s warmth and closing his eyes again. Five more minutes, Tony could steal this for himself for five more minutes.
“Forced the country into the worst recession we’d seen since the Great Depression.” Tony added. “But he has a dog now and is a family man, so most people forgive him.”
He needed something to do, a way to feel useful.
Tony worked for a little while longer, before it hit him. “Steve,” Tony said. “How long has it been since the others left?”
“Yes ma’am,” Steve said.
She finally pulled up her own, which was pink since her deadline was five days away. “And I’m adamant that it will occur two days before Valentine’s day. Steve will make the first move, and it will have something to do with flowers.”
Steve stood there, as if he were glued to the floor. He didn’t know exactly what to make of the situation in front of him. ‘This isn’t what it looks like’,
“You’re changing the subject.” Natasha said. “Your biggest weakness is your tendency to overthink anything that becomes remotely significant for you. Like this. You’re not taking a shot in the dark with this, you’re not going to lose him, not gradually, not at all. You forget that you both work together, you’re perfect in the field, and that says a lot about your relationship. This isn’t even the first time this has happened to you either-”
“Steve don’t be ridiculous,” Tony said, surprising himself. “Neither of us will fit on those – not even a kid could. We’re two grown ass adults, we can share a bed.”
“Look – I know that it’s not like I’m not good enough for him, that’s for him to decide and I wouldn’t take that agency from him. But, he has this whole world that I couldn’t possibly fit in, this whole life where right now, I can squeeze into, but anything more and I’d just throw myself out. He just holds
“Yup.”
“The others are all safely in Avengers Tower. They are currently watching
to meet Steve, and made Steve uncomfortable. He didn’t want that for Steve either.
“The nearest one is about a block and a half away, Boss.”
“Incredible. You’re incredible, I built my first armour in my 30’s, and you’ve done it at
Tony was unsuccessful.
Hell, Tony had let Steve drive him.
“I’ll sleep on the couch so you can have the bed,” Steve offered immediately, “it’s fine.”
Tony swallowed. “So… their rooms aren’t unlocked?”
. The light from the bathroom shone, giving him an ethereal glow that transported Tony. Water clung to his chest and dripped down his arms and Tony was lost as Steve shone in front of him. Time froze as Steve came out, ducking his head as he went to his bag.
“There’s six rooms Tony, it’s not a cabin.”
Clint groaned, forking over ten. He looked over at Natasha. “Shout my coffee at the botanical gardens today and we’re even.”
The glass on the screen of the phone.
A few moments later Steve sighed deeply and had Tony not been so close to Steve, he may not have heard it. “I Love you.”
Steve poked his head up, his eyes meeting Tony’s. “Oh, hey Tony. We really don’t have eggs?”
The girls however, had all been much too intimidated to even talk to him. As they had wandered the mansion, delighting in the other Avengers, they hadn’t come near him. Tony tried not to be surprised by that, he’d thought that maybe he had changed his image somewhat, in recent years, but obviously not.
“So, what’s the issue here?”
“Gary Webb uncovered that story in the 90’s, not the 80’s” Clint said.
Tony gave a weak grin, hind mind still racing over what Emine had told him. “That’s great Steve, that’s really… great.”
Tony smiled at her, he recognised the kid immediately. It was hard to forget the girl who made a serval hour journey every Sunday to Manhattan from New Jersey because ‘it’s closer to where the Avengers are!’.
“Well,” Natasha said again, a slight lilt in her voice, “
Shit, shit,
“How much are you betting with friend?” Thor asked.
They laughed, Natasha shoved him slightly. “Nice one.”
, then everyone’s happier for it.”
the first time Peter had met Steve.
“Alright, put the family’s Valentine’s Dinner in there then.” Bruce said. “And Steve will come if Tony’s there, right?”
“Tony,” Steve said again. “11 people complained and you decided to change your entire work schedule to fix their issue.”
The ringing cut off, only to be immediately replaced by Natasha’s hard voice. “Tony, why aren’t you here yet? This is
He thought about Steve, about sharing a bed with him. It
“Ms. Romanov, sir. Shall I direct the call?”
Tony stumbled into the room with messy hair and was wearing a hoodie that was far too big for his frame – it was Steve’s hoodie then, Natasha noted. She got up from the table to dish another bowl for Tony, who joined them at the table. Steve passed Tony a mug of coffee – because of course Steve had made Tony a coffee, whilst Natasha passed Tony his porridge and sat back down. He nodded towards Natasha, and smiled softly towards Steve.
Steve rolled over two eggs his way, and placed both brown sugar and normal sugar beside him. Tony added them immediately, not questioning how Steve knew what he needed, just going along with it. Tony had realised earlier that he and Steve were a clockwork, well-oiled machine.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “Well… I kind of had a different idea of getting us there.”
. They’re native along the Mississippi River, but particularly up north in area’s such as Wisconsin and Iowa.”
“Right,” Steve said, nodding dumbly. “We can share it.”
” Tony said, gesturing in front of him. “We got 44 different sculptors to do every president and lined then up along this path. We’re hoping it’ll be a thing.” (5)
Their faces were so close that Tony could feel Steve’s ragged, shallow breathing across his face. Tony couldn’t take it, Steve was miserable – Tony had somehow made Steve think he should
it was. If it had been him caught in the crossfire, he would have been fine.
“The one on when the Boss and the Captain finally get together?”
what could it have been? Because it damn well looked like Tony had been going through Steve’s sketchbook.
“Truth be told, I’ve never been.”
“It may be more apt to classify it as a home,” Jarvis suggested.
Steve put the spoon he was using into the bowl of cereal Tony had made him – because of course Tony had made it for him, he always did. “When would you like to go?” He asked. Natasha drummed her nails on the table, these two were still too wholly oblivious, and she was running out of time.
Eventually the conversation drifted and Tony and Steve left the room, leaving only Bruce, Thor, Clint and Natasha. Tony had gone down to the workshop to work on something for Pepper, and like clockwork, Steve had followed shortly after. Natasha ran through their interactions in her mind, there wasn’t really any change from last week.
“Spiderman! He’s the best.” The little boy on Kamala’s shoulders cried.
pancakes, they were soft, fluffy, heavenly pillow bites that you could douse with maple syrup and throw blueberries inside of.
Slowly, Tony cracked an eye open. “Steve,” he breathed, and it was like everything in Steve’s universe righted itself in that very instant. Steve looked into Tony’s eyes and it was like he was drowning. They were bright, they sparkled, they were colourful, they were
Holy crap. He had just engaged with four new kids, just because he had gone down to see one of them smile. He frowned at his past interactions with children and thought that maybe, just maybe, they weren’t trends, they were flukes.
“No, no, no, no, no,” Tony stuck his hands over his ears, grinning. “There’s no need for that kind of talk in here.”
“Steve!” She said, taking Steve’s hand in her own. “It’s been so long, we thought you’d carked it.”
FRIDAY paused for a moment. “He’s in the gym, tearing through his knuckles.”
Tony gave a wobbly smile, but it was enough, for it brightened his face like the morning sun never could. Steve could feel himself brighten too, with it. “I love you too."
“So Peter came along too,” Kamala said. “Because he’s got a theory that part of the reason it’s not working is because of how it’s connecting to the computer.”
“Palmer,” she said, shaking Bruce's hand. “I’m Nurse Christine Palmer.”
“No, the snapped chain has pretty much loosened everything,” he said. “I’ll get onto repairing that and you can continue with this.”
Peter, who Tony noticed was furiously blushing, spun away so he could face the computer. “Yeah, there’s been no improvement, we might have to wait a bit for the eftpos machine to reconnect, once Riri gets it back together, that is.”
“So,” Natasha said, moving back to the topic at hand, “Tony.”
“You literally have no genuine excuse for not pursing this. You can’t use your own insecurities as a reason to force yourself into unhappiness, not when you can actually access it.”
Natasha bit her tongue, she really
“Cabin,” Tony corrected.
Tony had lived with that,
Even if everything surrounding him was blanketed in a thick layer of snow that went up to Tony’s heel.
Steve chuckled. “
“And I have to honour him, honour our friendship. He’s had so many people hurt and use him in the past, I

“That’s a good idea,” Thor said, stabbing a chicken with his fork, “I could eat a horse.”
Bruce smirked. “Five dollars please, everyone.”
”, he said when Thor asked about a plant whose small purple flowers clumped together like a bush. “Native to Japan actually, most hydrangeas are from around East Asia though.”
“Every single one of us love Steve. We don’t all agree with every single one of his actions – again, that awful accords mess comes to mind, but he’s family, to us. I always make some my mother’s baklava for him, Greg always sets aside some cheese, Meryl always has some spare honey, Grace sets aside a new juice blend she thinks Steve will like, and Joan always makes him a hot chocolate when she sees him.
Clint collapsed dramatically onto the floor. “Rigged, this whole thing was fucking rigged.”
Tony laughed a hollow, empty sound. “I know, it’s awful, I know. I’m taking advantage of him, of our friendship. But,
Tony chuckled despite himself, she was sweet. “Advil sounds good, thanks.”
“Let’s put your bag away and we can put the fire on?” Steve suggested. “That’s what I was doing when you arrived, which is why it took me so long to get to the door.”
"This isn't what it looks like."
Steve tapped the cap on his head on their walk back to the mansion. “You were amazing with those kids, Tony.”
The boy turned around, his hoodie flopping down comically around his neck. “Mr. Stark – Tony, sorry, still getting used to that,” he fumbled out of his chair, standing upright. “Hi.”
“Not very hard.”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “Woo? I haven’t heard that phrase since I was a kid.”
“Are they arguing?” Thor asked.
Bruce grinned. “Pay up then, 50 dollars each.”
Tony ignored his worries, scrubbing it away with the dirt and grime his body had accumulated in the hours he’d been here. He focused on the water massaging his scalp and body as he rinsed off, letting it soothe his stressed mind.
The boy sitting next to her stared at Tony inquisitively. “Huh, the cap, the glasses, the hoodie, it’s almost like you’re just wearing your helmet.”
Steve didn’t know Tony had a crush on him, did he?
something to him, and personally, I value that.”
Natasha smiled. “
Natasha shook her head, returning the smile. “You’re an idiot if you think I didn’t start caring about you the moment I met you.”
Steve looked almost dazed. “Huh?”
Tony flinched, swallowing again as he looked away. He opened his mouth, as if to say something, but then closed it quickly thinking better of it.
it staves the hunger and you enjoy them more.”
Steve nodded dumbly, choosing not to argue with her. Good. She was right, after all.
“Sorry,” Steve said. “I didn’t mean to go too far or anything.”
cold out there.”
FRIDAY materialised in the empty seat Tony had been sitting in. Her hair was longer than it had been yesterday, and it reached her shoulders. She hummed. “No, I’m good. This is just amusing to watch.”
As soon as Nurse Palmer was gone, their gazes fell onto Steve, it must have been clear on his face, because none of them seemed to even want to suggest anything different.
“Well, you wouldn’t of had to.” Emine replied earnestly. “But, you can pay me back by going to see Greg, he’s been almost as worried as I have.”
Natasha rolled her eyes but otherwise didn’t comment, the nickname was harmless and Clint wouldn’t use it to embarrass her, he wasn’t like that. “FRIDAY, is Tony free on Tuesday?”
Then he realised the cocoon of warmth was Steve’s body.
He had posted to social media a lot.
“The original guy to use ‘Make America Great Again’.” Natasha added.
Clint pulled Thor’s fork back with his own. “They’re off somewhere making sure Natasha loses the bet.”
Ah, right.
“That was a dick move,” Steve agreed, but he said it with no malice, “and a huge violation of my privacy.”
Steve almost did a double take, Tony thought Steve’s drawings were beautiful.
Steve thought for a moment. “I hang out in the workshop a lot, I sketch,” he added with a blush, “– him, mostly, when I think about it. He forgets to eat so I make him food. We play chess, or he takes me to different art collections even though he hates it. Honestly – I just love being with him.”
“Emine I’m at least 10 years older than you, if you’re old then I should be dancing with the dinosaurs.”
Natasha rolled her eyes, these two were idiots. “Alright Tony,
would have survived. But of course, he wasn’t paying attention, and Tony was paying for it – for
you got the idea from a Disney movie.”
, Steve and Tony were curled up on the floor in front of the fire, Steve reading one of the books scattered around the house aloud to Tony, as Tony lazily ran his fingers through Steve’s hair.
Before Bruce could reply, Natasha intervened. “
Steve, you’re never going to find out the truth. Your biggest weakness isn’t your obsessive daddy issues or some made up bullshit narcissism issues-”
Tony himself huffed for real, before stalking towards his wheelie-chair. Dum-E would come back – hopefully not with a smoothie, and all would be well in the Stark Workshop again.
“But it would be awkward. We would dance around each other. We would pretend everything is normal, when it wouldn’t be. There would be this big, angry,
The team had arrived to the hospital shortly after Steve had, which Clint said was a feat, considering they’d crossed over a block to get the quinjet.
Steve swallowed thickly, stroking Tony’s palm with his thumb. He wasn’t leaving until Tony was alright. He would leave after, he didn't want to live colour blind again, but he had to let Tony find his colour again, set him free.
She had been wrong.
Tony took the moment to really look at Steve, really
No, no. This was a good idea, she would be thrilled to meet her hero, Steve would love to meet someone who respects him and is down to Earth, and Tony would get his buttermilk. Steve even had some cash on him.
“Dramatic,” Tony said, eyeing the curry hungrily.
like poetry in motion.
“Well you see Capitané,” Clint started, before a crash resounded through the speakers.
Natasha closed her book and shimmied down the sofa, patting the seat beside her. “Not that I don’t appreciate this level of trust, but, why are you telling me?”
Thor nodded. “Yes, that’s what I was thinking. I
“Huh, coulda fooled me.” Tony joked.
Well, that last one was redundant, Tony obviously cared.
“You love me.” Steve said, his voice betraying no emotion. Tony stared at Steve intently, Steve’s tone may have given nothing away, but his eyes were another thing. They were wide, consuming Tony whole. They were raving over Tony’s face, as if trying to find something.
Tony sat up, but Steve was already stumbling to the front door. “I shouldn’t have- I shouldn’t have taken advantage of you like that. I-I’m sorry, I’ll go. Break the nice wood and go home- back, to the tower.”
“If anyone can do it friend, it’ll be you.” Thor said, patting Bruce on the back.
“Do I give it to him?”
It was perfect.
“Oh he is,” Christine agreed with a fond smirk, “but he’s good at his job," She put her clipboard to her side and put a stray hair from her pony tail behind her ear. "He's not out of the woods,
Grinning, she slid out from the register and ran to the back of the store. Tony walked through the aisles aimlessly, gathering what he needed and soaking in the nostalgia of his childhood. Of all his years on earth, this store had barely changed. The yellow paint was peeling off the walls, the lights in the ceiling flickered sporadically, the constant smell of disinfectant permeated the air, and it was
to something new?”
As Tony stepped out of the shower, all that stress came rushing back. He’d left his bag in the bedroom.
Tony had never felt more at ease.
“Yet still just as attractive as you were in your 30’s,” She winked, before her gaze landed onto Tony. Her eyes showed recognition immediately, but she seemed to brush it aside like she brushed her long, grey pony tail behind her. “And who’s this?”
Natasha nodded. “FRIDAY, do you want to get involved?”
“You locked us here in the first place Barton,” Tony said. “That’s not exactly playing by the rules.”
Genius.
Behind her, Steve sat in one of the wooden chairs in the room. Natasha rolled another one over, setting up the first aid kit on the bench beside them.
And Steve had been completely serious. When he looked at Tony, it was like he wanted nothing more than to just hold him forever, to make sure he was never harmed again.
“Why the hell have you locked us up in here?” Tony asked.
On the 26
“FRIDAY,” Bruce said, “can you let the super-idiots know that we’re starting the movie now, with or without them?”
“Dammit Nat,” Clint said, “you almost blew our cover!”
Tony almost groaned, but contained it, it wasn’t her fault that the machine wasn’t working. Tony almost offered to fix it then and there, but knew it probably wouldn’t go down well if a customer tried to fix an eftpos machine out of the blue.
“What?” Tony asked as he took his seat at the table. “Why is everyone looking at me like I’ve grown a second head?”
Tony lunged for Steve’s wrist, spinning him around. “Do not break my door,” Tony said, and geez, that wasn’t the way to start this.
“No, of course not,” Steve agreed, “Trying, that’s a good idea. Let’s do that.”
Tony looked up at the tablet to glance at Steve, who was… looking at Tony with awe? That couldn’t be right. “What’s your point?”
Warmth filled Natasha chest as she gazed at her friend. She smiled softly at Tony, hoping it was enough to convey the gratitude, the sheer amount of love she held for him in that moment. By the look she got in return, she thought it did.
Steve nodded, taking his own tools and removing it. Tony leant over so he could loosen the locking nut.
Tony was agog, he was aghast. “That’s an absolute travesty FRI, how can nowhere deliver pancakes?”
Natasha hummed, pouring herself and Bruce more juice from the jug. Clint was speaking just a tad too fast for him to be believably calm. Bruce patted Natasha on the hand in thanks as he took his glass. “Technically it would be third, fourth, fifth, and six wheeling. We’re a bus. There’s no date there.” He said.
Tony recoiled slightly, drawing into himself further. Under the roar of rage that swam through Steve’s mind, he was almost guilty. He never wanted to hurt Tony, he cared about him, Tony was the most important thing to him in this century.
“No,” Steve said slowly, standing back up, “They said they’d unlock their rooms when they went to the car to grab their bags. I came with Thor so I had my bag already.”
Natasha had just been waiting for Tony to actually mention the botanic gardens.
Tony laughed. “You’re Russian Natasha, I thought you didn’t get cold.”
“I met him, you know.” Steve said after a quiet moment. “After I became Captain America. He was a decent man.”
Natasha shook her head, looking towards Steve. She didn’t understand what Tony had said, how could she? Natasha was a good read, but she didn’t know Tony like Steve did. Tony’s voice was getting lower, his voice coarse, like fragmented rock tumbling down a mountain.
Tony gaped like a fish, opening and closing his mouth repetitively. Natasha blinked, it was almost as if she had broken him.
, they’re brilliant.” He let go of Steve hand to crouch down beside Thor. Natasha noticed Steve’s look of mild shock, before he too crouched down on the other side of Thor. She sighed, Clint wasn’t winning the bet today. “They grow from Ethiopia to Senegal, and they’re in South Africa too. Basically it chills out around watery or boggy areas, so it’s a good spot here.”
Natasha raised a pointed eyebrow at FRIDAY.
Unless…
Steve swallowed and nodded, he would come to her later.
She hummed, her heart rate dropping. “I could get you some Advil? It’s out the back. I’ve heard orange juice is good too – not that I, um, get hangovers or anything, I don’t – I don’t drink, but I’ve heard it’s common knowledge, so I guess you would know that already, but, well, it’s there.”
“What,
“Be that as it may,” Bruce said after their laughter had died down, “Reviewing the terms of the bet is a good idea.”
Bruce stood up in relief, reaching for her hand. “Thank you, Nurse…”
“Hmm, I don’t know,” Bruce said, “he wouldn’t let me in either.”
But a
Tony laughed.
Villainous Eve – as she called herself, had swung into New York with all the rage but none of the politics of a tree hugging activist. She had ripped the earth from the botanic gardens and weaved it through the city, trapping civilians in venomous vines and collapsing buildings.
He was going to run them into the woods.
Tony nodded slowly, swallowing down some nerves. Natasha watched in almost fascination as he composed himself. He rubbed his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt from his free arm. “That’s, that’s all well and good Nat, but it doesn’t matter.”
“Do you remember what I did with-”
“Um, well, yeah,” Peter said. “My Stark Internship.”
“That’s how you’re going to the markets?” Steve asked, again, his tone inexplicably curious, like he couldn’t quite believe Tony was serious.
Tony paused. “Eggs? We don’t have…
“I almost I thought you were with the others,” Steve said, ushering Tony inside.
The archway was spectacular, blank, strong, white stone lined the edges of the top of the archway tunnel. It let the flowers weave along the top, which was peculiar since they didn’t seem to be the sort of plants that climbed. Yet, it worked.
Riri bit her before grinning. “Actually, I’m trying my hand at my own iron armour, you leave a lot of scrap metal around Mr Stark, what with all the aliens you fight, and explosions and stuff. I’m not up to the nanite stage yet, but I’ve got a pretty solid baby in my garage.”
wasn’t that big of a deal. It’s not like it was anything more than platonic, not like Steve would ever see Tony as anything more than platonic. Steve was just uncomfortable because sharing a bed wasn’t the Most Chivalrous Option. Yeah, that was it. He wasn’t uncomfortable with Tony, right.
Bruce rolled his eyes. “Steve spent the afternoon burning the kitchen, they’re not making out.”
He didn’t let go of Tony’s hand.
“Did you mean it?” Tony asked, his voice surprisingly strong despite how fast his heart was beating, how much he heart was hoping.
“Wait Peter, I thought you were only friends with MJ and Ned?” Tony said.
She would be waiting.
Tony sighed, peeling off his hood, taking off his glasses, and shoving his cap on Steve’s head for good measure. “Technically, I only knew Kamala would be here.”
“When it’s almost cooked," Steve said. "You want it to be warm and soft so the flavours infuse, but you don’t want them to go too soft that the spinach just kind of… shrivels up into nothingness and for the tomato to soften itself out of existence.”
“Yeah but, he locked himself in the workshop yesterday – complete black out mode, won’t let me or Bruce in and FRIDAY has tried convincing him to get out or to let us in but he’s refused so, I don’t know if it’s welcome.”
“When did those come out?”
Groaning, Tony swallowed his pride and knocked on the door, teeth chattering as he swayed on the balls of his feet.
Pepper would take the tray Bruce used as a make-shift desk and do paperwork on it, muttering about how she was ‘covering his ass and doing your work for you, and I’m not going to be making a habit of this so you better get well and wake up already’.
she could see the heads of her friends, because she was surrounded by them.
“I should hope not,” she said and Tony only just noticed the hint of an accent in her voice, the playful tune in which she spoke. Tony couldn’t pick it exactly, it was soft, you had to be listening for it, but it almost seemed Turkish. “It’s not polite to keep an old woman wondering.”
“Ah I see, so you only came so you could take my eggs out from under me.”
They neared a water fall (“which is still off track, Tony, we’re never going to reach the statues, just look at the map!”) which housed a variety of different ferns. Thor crouched down and stroked through a smaller one which was deep in the water. “There’s no sign here Tony, what is this plant?”
“That doesn’t help at all.”
“My family crossed the Black Sea into Russia, travelled hundreds of miles to the nearest airstrip, and boarded a plane to America. He doesn’t remember, but I was a child when I met Steve, and that day gave me hope that we would survive the war.
wrong about this.” Natasha said.
. He’d heard from Pepper that one of the employees – Margaret, had her daughter’s girl scout group coming to the mansion to sell cookies for some fundraiser or another. Tony prepared the workshop, gathering a variety of chemicals to create different coloured flames to entertain them, the cookies were just a bonus.
“Oh Emine, I would never die without letting you know first.”
“Yeah, but it’s tacky. Something has obviously happened and this random rose isn’t going to fix things. Clint showed me that new Netflix comedy special, Ray something-”
puns. She had been hanging out with Tony far too much.
Tony watched Steve’s face fall, and his heart beat through his rib cage like it was a rabbits.
Which brought Tony crashing back to reality. There was no way Tony could be with Steve, and Tony just had to accept it.
“You have phones on Asgard yet you insist on a raven.” Clint said.
introducing
“Boss, if I may,” FRIDAY said in his ear, “Captain Rogers always carries at least $100 in cash.”
Worrying his bottom lip, Tony slid Steve’s sketchbook back on the bench. “I- I knocked it over whilst working. I hadn’t meant to see anything.”
“You’re getting a bit too sure of yourself though Natasha,” Thor said, “maybe we should review the terms of the bet.”
He was a goddamn
“It’s fucking
Tony swallowed, forcing himself not to follow Steve’s gaze, the last thing Tony needed was Steve to notice that he was not so subtly checking him out.
“Half the founding fathers wanted the president to be president until they died, Hamilton ranted about it for six hours at one point.” Natasha explained, choosing to omit the fact that she only knew this information because of Broadway, “Madison wanted it too. The proposal lost by 6 votes though. After Washington left to sit under his ‘own vine and fig tree’ after two terms, it became tradition to do the same. FDR didn’t though, he stuck around and was elected for four terms.”
“There’s no predicting where you’ll appear, and you don’t make a sound.” Natasha said, but she wasn’t irritated, because then that would mean FRIDAY had annoyed her. She was just… slightly exasperated.
