“Okay. Well, not to worry. My friend will come get us very soon, and we can take you back to where you’ve been staying.” He had a sudden thought and winced. Grit his teeth and ploughed on. “You can even see your pal Bucky again.”
Everyone’s conversations paused. On the far left of the room, Rhodey was hip to hip with Wilson, who had a hand on Rhodey’s arm, beseeching. Lang had paused in the act of bringing them both coffee. To the right of that little group, Barton and Vision were arguing about something with a scowling Maximoff, who was nervously fiddling with her metal bracelet. And in the far right corner, T’Challa was discussing something with Barnes, who looked remarkably thawed for a corpsicle. Despite having braced himself for the inevitability of running into Barnes, Tony couldn’t stop the prickle of dread creeping down his spine as Barnes turned and looked at him, his mouth a flat line.
“I told him he should,” Barton said, butting in with that same wide-eyed, bushy-tailed, well-rested-and-eager-to-get-stuck-in, siryessir look. Romanoff was staring at him with a flat, thin-lipped look and he wilted a little under that stare before visibly perking back up. The fucker even bounced a little on his toes, drawing Tony’s attention away from the silent supersoldier in the textbook
Barnes made himself meet Tony’s eyes, something flat and hard in his gaze. “There is minimal risk, Stark; Wanda and I can fight this swordsman. We can defeat him. There is very little danger, and… and it is what Steve would want,” he said, in the tone of a commandment, as if saying made it so.
Mordo shrugged a little and seemed to retreat at that, with a quick flickering glance at the back of Wanda’s head.
He wasn’t even sure what he was missing, exactly. It wasn’t as if he had any experience of this - from either side, really - so it was mostly still… fantastical. Something you could watch, akin to a movie, and imagine as perfect and rosy and wonderful.
For a moment, he stayed perfectly still. Everything was exactly as he had left it when setting off earlier. The toys were all tidied away - that’s assuming that Steve had actually played with them - and his artwork of the previous day had been carefully added to the walls, joining a variety of unlikely-patterned animals and a great many superheroes. Steve’s Kevlar-lined winter jacket was over the arm of the chair beside the bed, and someone had folded his jeans and T-shirt neatly on top of the dresser. The red Iron Man sneakers - complete with tracker - were by the side of the bed, where they could be easily put on. The monitoring pebble was on the bedside table, alongside the panic button that would summon the guards.
. It was the same look Tony saw in his own eyes when he looked in the mirror, after all; the one that said he knew what Tony had done, what he was responsible for. (If Tony knew Wilson at all - and he rather thought he did, at least in this - he wagered that he looked at himself in the mirror in exactly the same way.)
On the whole oversight/decision-making issues... Tony is still not in a great place re: the Accords. He believes in oversight, dammit, and he believes that being held accountable is the right thing to do. (And I agree to be honest - I'm a humanitarian aid worker and I'm used to working under stringent standards and frankly if you have access to vulnerable people you should be held accountable because people are awful and without accountability there is abuse.)
“You’re not going to tell me that I’m looking at this all wrong, that I need to look at the bigger picture?” Tony didn’t look up from the open faceplate and exposed HUD.
today, and I have many feelings. Luckily, as this fic is set before S-M: Homecoming, pretty much nothing in IW impacts it at all. There may be small elements of non-compliance as obviously I started this before IW, but I hope it doesn't spoil your enjoyment of the fic.
If reasoning with him didn’t work, if finding common ground wasn’t possible… well, they could always find out who the madman loved, and… “It’s like the whole concept of humanity has passed you by entirely, hasn’t it?” Came out of his mouth before he could call it back.
M’Baku smiled and looked away, making a big deal out of examining his fingertips. “Hmmm. Ask me again later, mzungu.” He laughed at Tony’s expression then leaned in again, expression softening as he pointed at Steve’s drawing. “That is an interesting picture, Steve. Who’s that?”
is in his workshop, announced quietly and without any fanfare by FRIDAY. Tony really would have preferred for this conversation to happen a little later - say, fifty years into the future, with Tony safely dead and buried - but Rogers has never really paid attention to Tony’s preferences on that front.
He couldn’t move, and Barnes was here, and there was someone with him - someone helpless, someone he had to protect - and he couldn’t move, and
Barton, sat in front of a separate screen with Wanda by his side, looked up at Tony briefly. “I think that means she doesn’t want to get in the way of the epic bromance.”
Something unclenched in Tony at that. “Good, that’s - thanks, Vis. That would be good.” Rhodey and Wilson, they’d both put Steve first. And Vision could get him out of danger if it all turned sour. It would be OK. M’Baku felt confident enough in the security to let his kids play with Steve, didn’t he? He’d hardly do that if he thought Steve was being actively targeted. It was fine. It was
he’d thought all those days ago, and it was true. There was a gulf between the child and the man that yawned ever wider with every trauma the child suffered.
A painfully bright light was waved in Tony’s eyes and he irritably smacked it away. “Go away, my head hurts.”
Copies of Wanda’s bracelet were around the swordsman’s wrists, crackling faintly with power at random intervals. Tony guessed that it was the swordsman’s work, testing for weaknesses.
“Stay back,” Okoye hissed, and positioned herself so that she was shielding him with her body, her weapons drawn.
he thought, but did not say. He turned back to the jet, and to the first body lying just inside the door. Wanda - she must have tried to prevent Mordo from leaving the jet, he thought. She looked to be physically unhurt, but he didn’t dare shake her in case she had been injured, and she did not respond to a sharp pinch. Her eyes were closed in sleep, her hair in disarray beneath her as she sprawled on the cold metal floor. Tony confirmed she was still breathing and then moved further inside.
, the two of them had done what they did best; hide the truth and squirrel it away and treat everyone like a
Wait. “Wait,” Tony said. He flicked back to the earlier set of data in his data pack, comparing. “Wait, hold on.” He found it. “The spike in the radiation levels. Doesn’t that seem...”
Everything had seemed crystal clear when he’d been thinking it over at Steve’s bedside, but that didn’t guarantee that what had seemed obvious to him would be evident to anyone else.
Yeah, OK. She was either with their equivalent of the State Department, or part of the security detail the General had been briefing, earlier. Because, OK, she might have recognised Rhodey as Colonel Rhodes, fine, but she also knew that the kid with Tony was a ward of the court, not Tony’s own. Which was… interesting. “Is fixer not correct?” He asked pleasantly, falling into step with her, Rhodey on his other side.
That probably wouldn’t have made for a comfortable conversation. Well, then, it was a good thing that Maximoff was volunteering.
a pattern, enough for there to be a vaguely predictable map drawn up - and if this guy had Harry Potter powers at his disposal, he’d have been able to track her down a lot more easily. And he hadn’t. He hadn’t even taken a step in her direction, heading straight for Steve instead. “What does a ‘method of entry’ mean, exactly? A weapon?”
“He’s not wrong, though,” Rhodey said, even more quietly, and ducked when Tony attempted to smack him.
“He hasn’t exactly endeared himself to us,” Tony broke in. “And he’s using you as his get-out-of-jail-free card. Said you’d vouch for him.”
Steve twisted a little in Tony’s arms so he could see the cover of a the book. He sniffled and nodded, settling himself down. “OK,” he whispered.
They exchanged a few more pleasantries - Happy had a quick update for him on Peter’s latest escapades, which seemed to include honest-to-god rescuing a cat stuck up a tree - and he rung off, feeling considerably happier and more prepared. Pepper would figure things out. So what if he was planning to turn up on her metaphorical doorstep with a seven year old tomorrow?
“Sam, you have to quit worrying, I told you I’m fi-” The rest was too quiet, the words becoming inaudible as they moved out of earshot.
Next to her, Happy was nodding vigorously, looking a little more awake but just as rumpled as he squished in next to her on the loveseat. There were pillow-creases on his cheek. “Boss, maybe you should put the brakes on a little bit. I mean, you already have two kids in the pipeline, you don’t need a third just yet. And not,” his nose wrinkled, “not one with that much baggage.”
He shook his head. Time enough to talk through it all later. “Go, before Wilson comes back to fight me for your honour. I’ll be fine.”
There was a weird expression on his face as he said it; if he didn't know better, Tony would have thought it
Maybe he hadn’t known exactly where Steve’s room was; maybe he hadn’t had the range, previously. Maybe precision wasn’t something that was guaranteed with these things. But whatever the reason, it was clear that he knew where he was going now. He knew who he needed to get to.
Tony left the suit in the main room and padded to Steve’s bedroom in his socked feet, closing the door gently.
“You said a bad word,” Steve piped up groggily from under the blankets. He blinked up at Barton. “Are you here to rescue us?”
It turned out that not even the most advanced nation on Earth had been able to do away with post-op recovery times.
"Uh huh," Tony said absent-mindedly, gulping down a coffee and flicking through the briefing pack T'Challa had emailed through.
“Um…” Steve looked up, panicked, from where he was attempting to spoon the spilled jam from the floor back into the jar. “I can put it back in!”
change anything. (Something seemed to go cold in him at that.) Was he supposed to be sympathetic that Rogers bruised his goddamned knuckles when he slammed his fist into Tony’s chest? Is that how this was supposed to work? He was supposed to have
Or something tied to this Convergence that Dr Foster was investigating? Both of them, not to mention Loki’s sceptre, had been able to open Einstein-Rosen bridges. What if it was another artifact like that one? Or - worse - another powerful entity wielding one of them as a weapon?
That wasn’t the worst plan Tony had heard. Unless Ross could pass emergency powers he wouldn’t be able to yank anything out of escrow, and if Hill - and more importantly,
That was Steve’s voice, all right, but there was something wrong. There was an odd, deep timbre to it, as if an older man was trying to speak through a child’s voicebox.
“Not keen on life under ISIS, probably,” Tony prompted gently. His thumb stroked gently over the back of Rhodey’s hand.
“Wilson, then,” Tony said unthinkingly. “Or Romanoff. Or - Barton, if he's still there. Lang, maybe. Plenty of choice.”
He staggered out of bed, pulling on a pair of black slacks and a grey cashmere sweater before heading into the bathroom. The illuminated mirror greeted him with a bruised-looking reflection that was perhaps not unexpected, given that he'd had a grand total of seven hours' sleep in two days.  He grimaced and ran the cold tap until it was icy, splashing some water on his face. He looked like a raccoon, for fuck's sake. Did he have time to tidy himself up a little, try to cover up some of the bags under his eyes? Probably not, if T'Challa was calling him urgently. He dragged a comb through his hair and called it quits. At least he looked reasonably alert.
The clear defensive advantage of Jabariland was part of the reason why Tony was OK with being confined to bedrest for a little bit. Well, not
. Tony groaned, shying away from the hand prodding him awake, and tried to peel his eyes open. The light was excruciating, more or less stabbing him in the eyeballs as he blinked himself awake. He was in a bed, weighed down by an impressive pile of blankets and furs, and there was a thatch of blonde hair peeking out from beneath the blankets on his right. And was that - yup, that was the kid’s knee digging into his bladder.
Tony thought, suddenly certain. Romanoff would have backed Barnes, and the others would have fallen in line, willing or not.
“There has been a complication.” Tony looked at Mordo, who seemed a trifle nonplussed by Vision’s response. “Vis? How’s Steve?”
Tony blinked at that. “OK, point one, I wasn’t aware that I had been - that was you?” She nodded. “Well, fine, proactivity is always a plus. But more importantly, how the hell does he know I’m back in the country? I landed like five seconds ago!”
would have gone away entirely at this point so Rhodey's injuries are probably still exacerbated by that.
“That’s OK, I came to talk to you,” she said. She abruptly coloured, as if she had said something shocking or risque. “I’ll just… I’ll just set this down.” She maneuvered her way around the couch through to the little dining table off to one side, and set down the tray with its teapot and clinking little cups. “It’s
Tony thought, appalled. And again, the shame hit. Because if Wanda was too young, then so was Peter. And Tony had barely hesitated before bringing him in.
They reached the conference room before most of the others - who were presumably trickling in from other parts of the palace, so Tony didn’t know what their excuse was for being late - but the room wasn’t quite empty.
Easy, easy now. I’m not here to hurt you,” Barnes said quietly, half-catching the child as Tony startled and decanting him back into Tony’s arms. “Did you… did you sleep? You’re good with him,” he added, as if remembering an instruction.
!” And damn Romanoff, too; Nat had always known how to go for the throat with him, hadn’t she? Between her shoving these recordings at him, and Barton shoving the kid at him, what was he supposed to do when he was so thoroughly outflanked? What the hell did they want from him? Was he supposed to just roll over and - what? - forgive and forget?
Mordo held up his arms in surrender, faint amusement still on his face. “My apologies. I shall endeavour to restrain myself from over-familiarity.”
Because - of course - it didn’t matter if Tony had figured it out. He wasn’t going to expose Steve to more danger by attempting to move him if there was still a chance he’d have a stroke mid-flight, not unless they were definitely under attack.
, don’t look!” He grabbed for the kid, clapping a hand over his eyes. “Why are you out of the suit? I told you to stay put!”
(Because he didn’t know what he’d do if it had happened to him, with no hope of recovery, no magic blue pills or heart surgery to get everything back on track.)
Surely, he thought, whatever the outcome, preventing the bleed would be in Steve’s best interest. In
Don't fly after surgery, kids. Seriously, don't. (Yes, Sam is on the team going off to find the child-killer. No, this isn't a fun time for Sam or for Rhodey.)
As they sat down, Wilson reached over a hand over Rhodey’s knee, not squeezing, not even looking at him for any length of time, just letting it rest there. After a moment, Rhodey settled his own hand over Wilson’s.
Yeah, no one is having a particularly fun time at the moment. Don't worry, Bucky doesn't disappear for the duration of the fic. But Tony isn't going to be able to just hand Steve over and run away, either.
And then Steve was in a room and Howard was there (so impossibly young) and an older man, someone he trusted, someone he cared about, and Steve wasn’t fast enough (he was never fast enough), and the older man was falling, blood on his hands and in his mouth, and he was looking up at Steve -
he thought. Howard and Obie had both similarly guarded access to Tony when he’d been young and impressionable. At the time, Tony had thought it another set of rules to chafe under; in retrospect, he could see it for the attempt it was of structure, of guidance.
There was a strange look in Mordo’s eyes at that. “An apt choice of words. Tweedledum… well, let us say that although Tweedledum was safely beaten back, Tweedledee is still here, and eager to reunite with her sibling.”
“You said we were friends,” Steve sobbed, his whole body shaking. “You said it, but you don’t like me at all!”
He got down on one knee so he was facing the kid face-on. “OK, kid, I wanna be straight with you here. I’m not sure how much the doctor told you. Obviously, until we figure out how to turn you back into an adult, we can’t leave you on your own, you need someone to be in charge of you.”
!” Steve slumped against Tony, clearly exhausted from his spirited re-telling of the Great Zoo Trip.
. At least he was being upfront about things with him, which was considerably more than anyone else had managed. A thought occurred. “Hey, Sam?”
fainted on a Lord, like a Jane Austen heroine. Well, it was one way to make an impression, he supposed. As long as Lord mountain guy didn’t want to evict him or Steve in response… He passed a hand over Steve’s hair, gently checking for any lumps or bumps. “Is the kid OK? Everyone else?” A thought occurred, freezing him. “Oh, God. Is Rhodey OK?” Fuck, he’d left Rhodey at the palace, fucking
“- when they - what?” Tony blinked. The last he’d heard - the last every scrap of available information had assured him - the Avengers had been broken out of the Raft, and had been safely ensconced in Birnin Zana.  He'd tracked them himself. “But I sent -” he snapped his mouth shut.
Well, if the young princess had someone as sensible as T’Challa looking out for her, he was sure she’d have a better time of it than he had. Especially if T’Challa’s view of ‘suitable company’ had thrown her in the way of Jane Foster.
. “The initial signs are that the surgery was successful and I am pleased with your progress. However, we need to ensure your body has sufficient time to heal from the trauma, not to mention we need to assess you prior to full release.”
“Don’t worry, doc, I’ll make sure he does his exercises,” Barton assured the doctor, squeezing Tony’s knee.
“I have your briefing for you. Do you want it now or after you arrive?” Hill sounded very much like she’d prefer option number two. She was looking at Tony front and centre and up, her gaze determinedly a few inches above the top of Steve’s head.
“No,” Tony said. “No, it wasn’t him.” He’d kept the suit on but had opened up the chest plate, rubbing at the ache in his chest, from the tight knot beneath the sternum up to the lump in his throat, a numb line radiating pain across his ribcage.
“I made an elephant,” Steve said with great dignity, and shoved the crumpled purple elephant at Tony. “See?”
“Please,” Tony said gratefully, and awkwardly shook her hand. “Er - Dhakiya, this is Jim Rhodes, War Machine. Rhodey, Dhakiya, the king’s… fixer?” He was fairly certain that ‘tour guide’ was probably wrong.
Steve looked up from examining his new sneakers, with their red base, gold laces and triumphant Iron Man motifs. “My shoes have your armour on them,” he said solemnly. He still had a rasp to his voice, and the mask was hanging loosely on an adjustable strap around his neck, but at least the nebuliser had been switched out to a portable one in the form of a kid-sized backpack. Someone had clearly given him a bath before getting him all ready because he was clean and his hair had been neatly combed to one side.
Not that Tony could talk; he’d failed spectacularly in his own apologies to both Pepper and Rhodey on numerous occasions.
hard". *pokes fic* I know where I want it to go, but it keeps veering off down random little side-streets and I keep having to herd everyone back to where I need them to be for the plot.
“Mr Stark is of course happy to cooperate with any initiative authorised by the UN Accords Committee,” Hill said in a perfectly blank corporate register. “He’ll be delighted to discuss what form that authorisation might take during this transition period at a time convenient to the Secretary. However, the Secretary must be aware that Mr Stark is currently out of the country on personal business and unfortunately that personal business will likely keep him occupied for the foreseeable future upon his return. Mr Stark reminds the Secretary that the Avengers Initiative is temporarily on hold until such time as the legal questions raised by the Secretary’s timely intervention have been addressed and, moreover, there is no major threat currently identified which would warrant overriding of such suspension.” She leaned back in her seat, folding her arms. “This isn’t my first rodeo, Tony. And Ross isn’t the first jackass I’ve had to stonewall. If he pushes, we’ll shove the information assets into escrow and cover it with lawsuits from a dozen different shell companies.”
She looked at him for a long moment. “You think I will harm him,” she said. There was an odd look in her face, as if she was in pain. “You have been afraid of me for some time, and I thought… I thought you were afraid of what I might do if we were on opposite sides. We had been, and you had seen me work, and so it made sense. But that is not the whole truth, I think.” She reached out slowly, her hand open. Tony kept himself perfectly still. “It is one thing to be afraid of what someone might do to you if they have a reason to,” she said quietly. “But you are afraid of more. You are afraid of what I might do to someone who cannot defend themselves. You are afraid of me. Not of what I might do. Of
He’d told himself after Harley, he’d be more careful. He’d make sure those around him weren’ taking unnecessary risks. And instead… “There’s this kid in Queens,” he said abruptly. “You - you remember the spider kid?”
soldiers on the team. People that can make that call for him. So that betrayal... it feels personal in a variety of ways.
There was a long silence. Barton’s hand landed gingerly on Tony’s shoulder, squeezing gently. “... Yeah,” he said. He sounded as though he meant it.
He looked out of the window, his fingers carding through Steve’s tousled hair, thinking. Damnit, he’d probably have to talk to Barnes about this. He might have some idea about what Steve had thought as a child.
Okoye gave a stiff nod. “We are reviewing all security footage from all of the previous attacks,” she said. “Now that we know we are looking for a woman, one who has been at all sites, it may lead to visual identification.”
He had about an hour or so before Steve would wake up. Not enough time to make any sort of inroads on the recordings, but… well, he wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to listen to them. There was something screwed up about it all; another way in which Rogers could have his say and Tony’s rage would have no outlet.
“I think you’re making a mistake,” Natasha echoed, very quietly. She unfolded her arms. “I understand why you’re doing it. But you’re exposing yourself, and Steve, to a lot of risk. What if Umar decides to track you down?”
Steve looked conflicted, but finally nodded. “OK.” He bit his lip. Framed by the tight straps of the mask, his eyes looked swollen and scared. “You’ll stay until then, right?”
To a man who truly had no place in the world. Whose only use had been to kill people like Tony’s mom.
“Hey! Just because you’re taken doesn’t mean the rest of us can’t flirt,” Tony said crossly. He smiled at Dhakiya. “So, raincheck on the walk? I’d love to see a bit more of Birnin Zana.” Especially the labs of whoever had come up with Barnes’s new arm.
“I know, Steve. I wish I could fix it for you. But it’s gonna take a little while longer.” He reached out and carefully stroked Steve’s hair back from his face, so it wasn’t hanging in his eyes. “And in the meantime, you’ve been a bit ill, what with running around barefoot in that cold place, so we’re just giving you some medicine to make you all better. OK?” He didn’t know why he was asking. It was not OK at all, obviously; the poor kid must be scared out of his mind, and the hospital set-up was probably not helping.
Tony thought, a millisecond before Steve spotted him and immediately ran over, a bright smile on his face. The child hesitated for a moment, then seemed to take his cue from the kids crowding M’Baku and clambered over Tony to demand his own embrace.
“So, it is settled. We shall depart imminently in that case. I suggest that everyone review Captain Rogers’s notes and observations, in case there is anything pertinent in there which we did not spot at first pass. Colonel Rhodes, I understand that there are some tests my physician wishes you to undertake, so if you could please contact him at your earlier convenience.” Rhodey gave a terse nod at that. T’Challa looked down at his tablet, ticking something off. “And Dr Stark, the PICU have contacted me to inform you that Captain Rogers is awake. There are some forms to fill in to allow him to be discharged into your care as your ward. Sergeant Barnes, General Okoye will be your primary contact for your safety and for the safety of those around you. Please do liaise with her in the first instance. Any other business before we proceed?” There were heads shaking around the table as everyone gathered their papers and tablets.
“Rhodey,” he whined. “C’mon. Everyone’s acting so fucking weird, I’m starting to wonder if I’m not concussed.”
At the pilot’s console, Barton was slumped forward, his body tense, his eyes moving rapidly beneath his closed eyelids.
Tony looked away, feeling more self-conscious than before. He’d never really looked at Maximoff before, dimly aware that she was young and a teammate (sort of) and damaged (definitely) and… well, looking hadn’t really been the done thing in those circumstances. (He hadn’t wanted to make her nervous. Uncomfortable. Angry.) He was surprised to see the stress lines on her face, carving themselves into her forehead and around her mouth in sharp little grooves. No crow’s feet around her eyes, but whatever few years she’d lived had left their mark on her. Well, they all had their scars, he supposed.
The image changed. Steve was on a train (a train? Why a train?) and Barnes was falling into the snow, a broken ragdoll with his neck snapped. Steve followed him into the snow but it was too late (it was always too late). Barnes’s lips were moving, blood spilling down his chin, his eyes milky-white with death.
Umar, who might be terrible enough that Mordo viewed whatever actions he took to stop her as nothing more than a necessary sacrifice.
He woke somewhere warm an indeterminate amount of time later. He couldn’t see anything, and he couldn’t move, but he was warm, and there was a breathing, snuffling little body curled up against his, so it was probably OK. It was probably fine. Even if he was in the dark, and he couldn’t move, it was -
“Does he always behave like this?” She asked Rhodey on her way out, raising an eyebrow at Tony’s offer to walk her back to her… base? Quad? Wherever it was she lay down her weapons, anyway.
It would have been Barton against, Tony realised, Barnes for, and then which way would the rest of them have split? He’d bet his eyeteeth they hadn’t told Rhodey, because if he’d known, he would have been contact. Hell, he would have been
He tried for petty satisfaction, but it just felt hollow. Barnes’s pain did nothing whatsoever to lessen his own issues; it just made him conscious that there was another variable at play.
Judging by the narrowing of T’Challa’s eyes, though, it had not gone unnoticed. “I was detained elsewhere,” the king said smoothly. “Affairs of state.” He offered Tony his hand to shake. “It is good to see you back on your feet, Dr Stark. I was … concerned.”
His hands were trembling. He touched the carefully-drawn blonde hair of the woman, his fingers tracing the waxy crayon marks. He didn’t know when Steve had drawn it. Was it a new drawing? Something he’d done to help process the shock of having to stay in the present? Maybe it wasn’t as rosy as it appeared and Tony’s focus should be on the presence of Sarah Rogers, rather than the Iron Man holding Steve’s hand firmly. Or maybe Steve had drawn this back in Birnin Zana.
Had forcing him to see Steve’s nightmares been her own attempt to force a detente, or had it simply been an attempt to ‘correct’ his nightmares?
didn’t know about her? When she has been here for millennia, hidden from sight? When I cannot access the libraries, when I -”
Slowly, Rhodey nodded. “I can’t speak for where Sam falls on this,” he said after a moment, “but for what it’s worth, you know I got your back on this, any way you need me.”
He scrubbed a hand over his face. “Did something happen?” He asked, his voice softer. “Did you hear something? Is that why?”
Another exhale. “He’s having flashbacks,” Rhodey said, very quietly. “He doesn’t… he can’t sleep from them. His whole day is already tied up with me, and with Rogers, and with everything else. I don’t want him to…. He doesn’t have the space to…” He couldn’t seem to find the words to finish his sentence, instead sinking back down into another stretch.
He looked down at the sleeping child, at how his hand had crept without his volition to gentle the tangled sweaty hair and soothe away his childish terrors, and he knew the truth of it:
“Do you?” She pursed her lips. “That child… he has already lived his life once. He has a mother, and a home. Maybe not right now, but… don’t make the mistake of thinking this way is easier. That it would be less complicated. The longer we leave it, the harder it’ll be to turn him back.”
“No,” Tony said, opening up the small toolkit he had in one of the inner suit compartments. It was wholly inadequate to do a complete repair job, of course, but would be enough to get the suit operational again - he hoped.
Beside him, Romanoff gave a small sigh and took the chair to his right, reaching under the table to pat him on the thigh.
Well… if it meant he’d take care of Rhodey, Tony wasn’t going to pretend to be anything other than relieved. He didn’t know Wilson, hadn’t spent any time with the man. Hadn’t even traded much in the way of pleasantries with him, before it all kicked off. He wasn’t going to lose any sleep over Wilson’s prior traumas, as long as they didn’t make things worse for Rhodey.
Tony took back every nice thought he’d ever had about Sam fucking Wilson. “Yeah, in a gross breach of privacy!”
He smoothed Steve’s hair back from his forehead and stood, walking to the adjoining room and closing the door gently behind him.
He thought about taking her hand in his. (Felt the chill down his back at the thought.) He leaned back in his chair instead. “I just wanted to keep you safe.” It sounded like a confession.
,” Tony grit out. He could feel something hot and wet trickle down the side of his face. Then, a moment later, “sorry, baby girl. But I can’t land. Not until it’s safe.”
For all of Barton’s carping on the subject, the obligatory ‘goodbye’ gathering was actually fairly small. Sam and Rhodey were still in Birnin Zana, due to return back with Vision in the next few hours (once Tony and Steve were safely out of range). Barnes and Barton were of course accompanying them to the US and were already in the plane, double-checking they were ready for lift-off. Okoye was the only Wakandan present; T’Challa and M’Baku presumably busy doing whatever it was the Wakandan aristocracy did in the middle of the day.
. The Bartons had all disappeared within days of the Raft break-out, and Tony had no fucking idea where they were. He'd
With a sidelong glance at Barton, Tony squared his shoulders. “I did - I do. Whoever built Barnes that arm - they’re the one helping Dr Foster on the Einstein-Rosen bridge work, on what’s happening with Steve, right? I want to meet them. I am… not happy… about having the kid used as bait in this plan, and even less happy about being kept in the dark on this. And I am not convinced that - even if everything goes hunky dory - we’ll be able to contain the attacker.”
, not by staring directly at the innocuous facade.) Tony could picture this place as a holy headquarters very easily, especially if the disciplines could portal in and out. “After you.”
That drew a startled laugh out of Mordo, and a snort from Okoye. “As I said. My apology is quite genuine. My sole intention is stopping Umar; I have no quarrel with you or yours, Mr Stark. I do not do this for fun. I do it because it is necessary, and because to
a grown-up,” Tony said coldly, a little irritated at this unnecessary critique of his rescuing skills. “And your pal’s in no shape to mount a rescue.” He grimaced at the stricken look on Steve’s face. “We’re gonna be evacuated to him soon, and you can see him as much as you like then. But try and stay in the suit, ok? I don’t want you turning back into a Capsicle before then.”
“My advisers believe that the effect on Captain Rogers - and the sacrificed soldiers - was unintended. There are significant indicators that the pain of the soldiers was used to create a temporal event, as you describe it, Dr Stark.” He frowned, tapping his fingers on the table. “If the event was a door, then the soldiers were part of the doorframe. Captain Rogers was in the blast radius.”
Some joker - Tony was starting to suspect Barton’s hand in all this, and the bastard was lucky that he’d scarpered - had put the kid in an Iron Man T-shirt, tiny little baby khakis, and even tinier Converse sneakers. With more Iron Man on them.
“Boss?” FRIDAY said, sounding as surprised as it was possible for her to be. “Are you okay? Is the suit damaged? This line is not entirely secure,” she added chidingly before he could speak.
By the time Tony had staggered to the coordinates - the right boot repulsor entirely dead, and the HUD interface flickering worryingly - Steve had gone limp and unresponsive in his arms. Tony’s vision was starting to prickle, the kaleidoscopic visual disturbances becoming more pronounced.
(Steve was smiling up at him, hair sleep-tousled and eyes bright. He was reaching up to catch a hold of Tony’s hand.
After a beat, Tony looked away. “Yeah, okay,” he said, trying to to keep his tone even. “Thanks, I guess.” He could hear the bitterness in his voice.
Beside him, similarly ensconced in a child-sized seat and carefully colouring in age-appropriate pictures, Barton smirked. “Yeah, Tony, you said a bad word. Shouldn’t you be setting a better example?”
Parts of the call with Rhodey were originally planned for earlier in the fic but I needed to give him a bit more time in recovery. I wanted to give him some tangible gains from the surgery, but we know that canonically that he is still using the braces later on so obviously he couldn't have all the damage repaired. But he should be mostly recovered from surgery - certainly enough to be in the room having opinions, even if he's not well enough to be back in the suit yet - so that adds him and Sam back in the mix. I took my guidance on Rhodey's reactions from a variety of websites re: the mental impact of life-changing events, but would welcome input from anyone better informed, especially if I've managed to get it completely wrong.
“You certainly smell like it,” Barton muttered, but he brought the coffee over and sat back down at the table.
Shuri blinked at him. “To see - what would disrupt the existing signature? We needed to know how to hide him, if the tracking was active.” She looked at him a little uncertainly. "It's why I suggested taking him to M'Baku - the mountain would cloak him..."
Tony took a deep breath. He still wanted to ask about the relationship - because, nope, he was pretty certain he wasn’t wrong on that score - but there was a more pressing concern. “Are you - did he get you help? Did he listen?”
Tony debated mentioning the fact that he’d had to explain to Steve what the situation was, but both Hill and Barnes were looking at him with interest at this point so he opted to keep quiet. He’d mention it to Barton later. He’d know what to do with upset kids; hell, he must have had experience explaining these things to Cooper, right?
Tony flashed him a quick smile and set the water and food within reach of the suit. “I think you need it more than I do, given that you’re running around in a t-shirt. Eat if you can.” He retreated back to the pallet, wrapping the blanket around himself. It was… not the cosiest he had ever been.
He took the hand away and blinked in the soft glow of the artificial light. The curtains weren't open; it must still be dark outside. What time was it? "FRIDAY, it's the middle of the night; who the hell is calling me?" FRIDAY wouldn't put anyone through unless they rated as important enough for her to skip the automated voicemail... or unless they had managed to convince her that what they had to say couldn't wait.
The guards standing behind Mordo stepped forward, and the guy - to his credit - did not protest. He nodded politely to T’Challa - and Tony, of all people - and left with them, Wanda and Barnes still flanking him. Barnes looked back over one shoulder and nodded to Tony as he exited.
Barton gave him the finger and reached out his other hand, activating the pebble, effectively silencing any riposte.
“Steve. I’m not stealing him.” He’d waved the tablet - Barton’s note still on his notification screen - accusingly.
Barton shrugged and took Steve, Barnes at his shoulder. They closed the door on the limo and went up to the house, doubtless to check whether any Hydra assassins - or worse, paparazzi - were hiding in the crockery.
There was a pause. “Done,” she said. “Help will be with you in a few hours to assist with evacuation. Are you in any immediate danger?”
this Ayo, however much she might have impressed Romanoff. And he wished he trusted those who were going out there a little bit more, Vision’s presence notwithstanding.
One of the nurses was urging him onto the gurney, hanging up an IV bag on each side of it, presumably one for him and another for Steve. He didn’t need the gurney, to be honest, but as Steve hadn’t let go, it would probably be easier to just lie down for a little bit so they could examine the kid more easily.
Tony wasn’t sure whether the clinginess was a normal reaction, or something to get checked out. He’d rather gone along on the assumption that the parents in the room - which seemed to include M’Baku, interestingly - would tell him if there was something wrong with the kid. So far, though, both M’Baku and Barton had both just spoken gently to Steve, but otherwise left him to his own devices. Surely they would have said something if there was something seriously wrong?
Hopefully they’d have some useful data from the recording, and whatever readings Shuri and Jane Foster would have gathered.
The source of the sound - a small boy, bare-legged and dwarfed by the Captain America upper body armour - peered tearfully out from beneath one of the discarded doors. He was blue-lipped, almost frozen.
Mordo folded his arms and leaned back in his chair, his lips quirking as Barnes jolted next to him at the movement. “I did not bring a resume with me. I trust that you will not require character references?”
The screaming was growing fainter and fainter, as if the world was easing away from him. As if he was falling, and if he looked up he could see the surface of the water receding, the light flickering and fading. He strained against it, trying to drag himself back up to where the screaming was coming from, to where he could hear the child in severe distress.
She shrugged a little. “The restraints are holding. And Wanda’s right there, in case they don’t. I’d say we have a reasonable chance of being able to contain him.”
Barnes seemed unruffled by this possibility, or by Tony’s comments on his memory loss. “You are very fragile, even for a baseline human,” he observed. “The heart condition, the cerebral haemorrhage, the…” He waved a hand, as if indicating the entirety of Tony’s… everything. “And you don’t look after yourself properly anyway. I doubt anyone could pin it on me.”
She shook her head, her expression changing into one of dismay. “I - oh. I didn’t realise. I’m sorry. Stark - Tony - I’m
I've tagged this as Sam/Rhodey background only, because this fic is through Tony's eyes so it wouldn't be the same level of focus/page time as the Steve / Tony main pairing. (Although I do love those two together, so I'm toying with later writing the companion piece to this where they get together.)
Tony sprawled down next to him, feeling exhausted already. “We’re going on a field trip.” He looked at where Steve was still busily making green handprints on the paper (and the table), not having noticed him yet. “How was he?”
Hill smiled back at him, unfazed. If he didn’t know better, he’d think she was genuinely pleased to see him.  “Hello, Tony. Pepper made a persuasive argument on why my presence would be required. Congratulations on your new arrival.” Her gaze lighted briefly on the child asleep in Tony’s arms and then slid away, as if she didn’t want to look at him too closely. “I imagine it was a bit of a surprise.”
“Boss. That goes from me as well. You don’t have to do this. Whatever you decide, we have your back on this.” Happy reached over and took her hand in both of his and Pepper shifted so that her shoulder was pressed against his; an army of two at his back, standing against the world.
name. “We’re going to stay by the beach. There are some people there who might be able to help, and I think it’ll be better for you to be back in the US.” It occurred to him, belatedly, that he hadn’t asked Steve’s input into any of this. “Would you like that?”
His mom had said during one particularly angry argument, the words ringing long after the argument had ended.
Steve was asleep. The nightlight on the bedside table cast a faint glow over his sleeping face, blotchy and red and half-hidden beneath the bedding. He had one arm resting on top of the covers, enough for Tony to see that he was wearing one of Tony’s T-shirts, rather than his own pyjama top.
Moving gently so as not to wake him, Tony deposited Steve back down on the foil-pallet, his back to the open suit. “FRIDAY, crank up the heat a bit.” He tucked the foil blanket around Steve carefully, frowning at how cold his fingers felt. His capillary refill was also worrying. He’d warmed up some, but he was still dangerously cold, and he hadn’t managed to eat any of the food Tony had brought him. None of this filled Tony with any confidence.
Barton shrugged a little helplessly. “It’s what we give to Cooper when he’s sick and we’re out of baby Tylenol.” He reached out and brushed a lock of sweaty hair out of Steve’s eyes. He looked up at Tony and his lips were a thin line. “How long has he been wheezing?”
Tony had already sent his thanks to them both for their hospitality, and to T’Challa for a bit more than that. Mordo was presumably in the Jabari equivalent of a time-out.
“Give me a minute.” There was strain in Wanda’s voice, her hands clenched. Her own bracelet sat open on the table in front of her, inert, as she focused.
She looked down at her fingers around his wrist, watching as the gauntlet retracted, leaving Tony’s hand bare. Slowly, carefully, she tucked her hand in his.
“Don’t tell anyone,” Tony confided, “but so am I. Go take a shower or something before you go snuggle my honeybear, Sam. And get some fucking sleep, OK? You look like shit.”
“In my defence,” Barton said, laughing, “I did actually know that.” He lifted up the colouring book. “Are you going to help Steve with his colouring in after your physio? I’m sure that’s good for his recovery, right?” His eyebrows were raised meaningfully, as if he was hinting so heavily that even Vision would be able to spot it.
Tony squeezes his eyes shut and curses the day that Rogers was ever born. “I'm not holding him fucking hostage,” he says wearily, even though he knows he was doing exactly that. Fuck Rogers for calling his bluff.
And so Rhodey had been forced to hide it, and Wilson had watched him hiding it, and… “That’s why he’s against the Accords?” He said, incredulous. “Because he’s pissed about how the US armed forces treat the troops and the vets?”
“And then what?” M’Baku asked, sounding bored. “You will twirl your little sword and she will tremble?”
The truth of it was, even in the best of all worlds - where they stopped Umar, where Mordo turned out to not be a double-crossing bastard, where there was no collateral damage - they had no guarantee of what would happen to Steve.
The swordsman did not appear to be the least bit impressed by the intimidation tactic. “I am waiting,” he said amiably, “but my patience is not infinite.” He was sans sword, at least, but otherwise he looked the same as when he had attacked the palace, Tony noticed. However they had captured a guy, he didn’t have a fucking scratch on him.
And Rogers. Of course, Rogers. Just because Tony had Steve to look after, that didn’t mean that the question of Rogers went away. That didn’t mean that everything was magically solved.
“Suit’s fine, I’m fine, it’s all fine. Listen,” he looked back at the almost-asleep Steve cuddled up inside the suit and grimaced. “I’ve found who I was looking for, and he’s not in the best of state. I think I need to get him back to his friends, but we can’t travel in the suit. I may need a hand. Are you able to arrange it?”
“He already had this fight with Steve,” Barton interrupted, folding his arms. He looked away and sighed, raising a hand to rub the back of his neck tiredly. “Look. It’s not my place. But… Barnes went back into cryo a couple of days after we arrived in Wakanda, before the rest of us left. Steve said…” His throat worked. He glanced at the child sprawled in Tony’s lap. “He said he’d said something to make him choose that. Had driven him away. Had… expected him to be his friend from childhood, and not respected the changes done to him, the life he’d lived.” Barton’s jaw was clenched. “He said Barnes had chosen to go under in part because he needed to not be in the same place as him.”
Wilson looked back at him, his expression stony. “Yeah,” he said finally. “You have an hour or so before we need to be there, there’s one more person who needs to be - who needs to arrive.” He looked down at the small hand in Tony’s and seemed to hesitate. “Don’t screw this up,” he muttered finally, turning on his heel to leave.
A little while later, he looked across at where Mordo continued to sit perfectly still, his eyes closed, his body lax, without a hint of guilt for his actions. The noble statesman, willing to make the morally grey choices those around him shrank from; more sinned against than sinning.
“Yeah,” Tony said into Steve’s hair, trying to peel the kid away from where he was plastered against his side. “He’s been turned into a munchkin. Maybe six years old?”
Something in Tony broke at that. At having someone that pleased to see him, as if his whole world had been made better by Tony being in it. He hadn’t felt that way since -
“Our love’s more 24/7 than 7/11,” Tony snapped back automatically, then made himself take a breath. No reason to take it out on Wilson, no matter how much he wanted to cry, or to wring Steve’s (or Nat’s) neck. “Sorry. Habit. I can’t get through to Rhodey, and Barton said he was in surgery - is he out, yet? How’s he doing?”
“That’s the one. He’s been harassing me ever since, you know? I made him the suit so he’d be a little safer, but…” Tony shook his head. “He’s on his own out there - he was on his own starting out, and he’s been getting into bigger and bigger trouble - and I just…” he shrugged. “I don’t know. I think I may have made a mistake. Maybe I should have just put a lid on it, kept him small, local, you know?”
A - shield? something like that, anyway - seemed to sprout from the guy’s fingers, twisting in complicated runes around his wrist, bright and crackling with energy. The repulsor blast hit the flat shield and seemed to dissipate, sputtering out in a shower of sparks across the entire glowing circle.
Tony stared at the child-sized bed - and the colourful Iron Man duvet cover - for a full minute before he managed to look away.
“You in there, Rogers?” He waved a cautious hand from a safe distance. Three metres was good, right? Not close enough to panic the kid into a sudden movement. (The last he needed was explaining to the world why he’d allowed a pint-sized Captain America to skewer himself in his presence.) “Hey, Steve? You recognise me, right? It's Ir- it's Tony. We’re friends. You remember that, right?” He inched forward carefully, his eyes on the blade.
“Romanoff already went over it all with a fine-tooth comb,” he said quietly. “All that’s left is… I don’t know. Not that.” He was silent for a long moment. “I listened to one. It was short, and I thought… I thought it’d be OK… I don’t know.”
“Not to interrupt a family reunion,” he interposed, “but maybe we could check that my people are all still intact before you get into it.”
And waited, in the freezing cold, probably scared out of his mind, while Tony was asking T’Challa why couldn’t
- the temptation to pretend that everything was OK… he had rung that number over a dozen times, whiskey glass in hand, before he’d finally made himself hit
T'Challa is very much the Wakandan James T Kirk. M'Baku is... I guess the Wakandan Spock? (Don't overthink it.) Anyway, they're both leaders, they are both used to setting their personal feelings aside for the greater good, and frankly, if they can work with (a controlled, monitored, under their thumb) Mordo to prevent what is a big crisis about to happen, they damn well will.
Tony shook his head, focusing on her. His paranoia could wait, probably. “At least eighteen hours,” he said hoarsely. “We gave him a dose of albuterol and a quarter of a tablet of Tylenol for the fever. He’s been… he has, uh, pleurisy, I think. But the whistling is new. And he was in extreme cold for close to a day with inadequate thermal protection. I think we warmed him up before hypothermia or frostbite kicked in, but…”
At the front of the room, Romanoff gave a tight nod. “He also identified himself,” she said. “So that the Russian authorities - and Interpol - knew there was something strange happening, that the children had once been adults. Unfortunately, that was all the information they were able to gather.”
it verifiable?” He asked sharply. “Or are we going on Gnostic texts at this point? What next, a quick round with the Apocrypha?”
The flight back took approximately five hours, if you went by Barton’s chronometer, or eighteen days, if you went by Tony’s measure of subjective time. “Come
“I was,” Rhodey said, and there was a hint of something shamed and defensive in his voice. His fingers beat a tattoo on the wheelchair armrest. “I did. Look, I didn’t want to commute to New Jersey every fucking day, okay? Bethesda’s just a lot easier, especially if you have someo- somewhere nearby. I needed to concentrate on getting better, Tony, I didn’t lie. But then this kicked off, and…”
Then having a kid who looked like his BFF telling him that he wasn’t Bucky Barnes was probably going to do a number on him.
However this thing played out, it wouldn’t look especially good to the UN to have a major US industrialist expire on Wakanda’s doorstep. Not if T’Challa’s programme of internationalisation was going to go ahead. “I’m grateful for your assistance. Your guards are formidable.”
Tony was mildly disappointed that he still had the capacity to be surprised by how much the universe hated him.
“No one is handing anyone over,” T’Challa broke in. M’Baku tugged Mordo out of the way and T’Challa stepped in front of the prisoner, putting his body in between Tony’s repulsor and its target.
“OK,” he soothed, his movements slow and gentle. “It’s all OK, you don’t have to see him, I’m here.” Without thinking, he pressed his lips to the top of Steve’s head.
Dhakiya chose that moment to enter the room, smiling to see the kid up and about. “May I interrupt?”
The others filtered in mostly individually, availing themselves of a coffee or juice on their way to a seat, Barton sitting down in the empty chair to Tony’s right.
Tony shot him a startled look. “For me?” Not for his mom, or his - his Bucky? (He wasn’t gonna dignify the Barton thing with a comment. Sure, Barton had asked for him. Had asked
you what you need. So here's my favor, Cap. A small, simple one.” The gray swamps him again, and his grip on the worktop tightens to the point his hands start to cramp. His mouth feels like it is filled with cotton wool and the bitter tang of bile, his tongue moving so lethargically he worries he's slurring his words. “I've tried everything I can think of. All the possibilities I can access legitimately, and some not so legitimately. So now I need someone to work out what other avenues there are. I need someone to find them, and open them up for me.”
Tony signed off and paused, staring at the console thoughtfully. Probably it would be best to power the system down entirely and preserve the scarce fuel… but the distress call had already gone off, help was on its way, and their best line of defence was the suit. And what if FRIDAY needed to contact him in the meantime?
Lang made a sceptical noise. “Sorry to butt in,” the guy really needed to quit apologising for his existence, Tony thought with exasperation, “but is unshrinking the Cap really the priority right now? Mr Stark seems to have a handle on things with him, and - well, whoever turned that base into an abattoir wasn’t kidding around. Don’t we need everyone on this?”
That at least some of them would be better people than Tony - more able to compromise, to forgive - that, he could believe. But Rogers had run off half-cocked to fucking
“I…” He coughed. “I have to go to a meeting in a little bit. But…” They’d said that they were waking up Barnes, right? “Your pal will likely be at the meeting as well. What say I bring him down with me afterwards?” He tapped the face mask. “Hopefully they’ll have mask off you by then, and you’ll be breathing more easily. Yeah?” And then Barnes could take over, and Tony could… He’d just...
Tony’s vision is almost entirely grey, now, and he can hear his heart thundering in his chest. It's not fast, but it is loud, so loud it almost drowns out the rushing sound in his ears. “The way I see it, your boy - your
Barton looked even more uncomfortable, if that was even possible. “Someone had to watch you. Wanda had to be there for the surgery, and you were agitated, didn't recognise anyone else, so I had to be there, you know, to... Everyone else is still out in the field, tracking down Aragorn and trying to get ahead of the next attack. It's OK, the Dora and some of the Jabari guards were with him the entire time.”
In the corner, Steve’s head shot up. “You said a bad word,” he said around a mouthful of crayon. “I tell you, and I tell you, and you keep saying the bad word.”
Natasha was waiting for him when he left the room a few minutes later, Barton busy at the little kitchenette, making a fresh pot of coffee. “He’s OK?” She asked, sounding a little uncertain. “We had some trouble getting him to bed. He seemed to quieten down when M’Baku put him in your shirt, though, but we had to leave the nightlight on.” She bit her lip, uncharacteristically abashed, as if the shirt - or the concession to a child’s terror - had been some great transgressive act. (Perhaps, for her, it was.)
Which was all fine, except for one large problem that had just been slipped in there, sight unseen. “Wait,
1) Shuri's amazing lab was trashed completely in Black Panther, so although there is still advanced tech throughout Wakanda, it's not as miraculous as we saw in the film until the lab is re-made.
Of course, he hadn’t expected Wilson to be spending time with Rhodey, either, so that was probably a factor. That is, if this thing was something recent, and not something that he was noticing just now. Bethesda, though… He couldn’t remember where Wilson’s place was, although he was fairly certain it was near DC. Had Wilson gone back to the US after the clusterfuck in Siberia?
“.... Steve.” Hesitantly, Tony reached out and gathered the child to him. “I would if I could. You know that, right?”
He powered up the jet as silently as he could, letting FRIDAY take control of the autopilot. “FRI, we may need a quick getaway, get us set up, please.”
Tony felt a chill at the thought. It wasn’t at all like what had been done to him and Bruce, of course, but… well, the intent was the same.
“M’Baku spilled the beans?” Barton snorted. “Yeah, he wasn’t very keen on us not mentioning it. Said it was dishonourable.”
After a moment, Barton snorted. “Don’t worry about it. I’m just making sure you keep our appointment in the gym.” His lips quirked in a smile. “Drink the fruit shake, Tony.”
“I’ll bet.” He looked down at the HUD innards. “Out of interest, what’s the plan once you drop a cargo net on Inigo Montoya and drag him to our dastardly lair?”
They moved into the clinic, Wilson taking up place behind Rhodey to give him a break from maneuvering the wheelchair. Tony watched them go, thinking. Hadn’t Wilson also lost a teammate previously? He seemed to recall something like that having happened. It had been in his file. Robert? Roger? Something like that.
“Vis, take Steve, will you? We need to meet with -” Romanoff looked down at Steve, still half-hidden behind Tony, “with the King.”
- had to be for a reason. He was betting that the layout was recognisable to… well, okay, he wasn’t sure who would recognise the layout, because he tried not to socialise with people who dismembered children. But someone would know what the hell had happened at the base.
“Were you even paying attention in there - he killed thirty-two guards already! And god knows how many others we don’t know about! And now you’re just going to let him go?” Let him go and give him access to
? For God’s sake, how often do I have to do that before he passes me? Any more repeats and I’m gonna start wondering if the interest is purely professional!”
He is inches away from wringing his hands in worry, the fucking boy scout, Tony thinks viciously. “Underhanded,” Tony manages after a moment, “trying to blame my favorite girl when I know it was all that traitor Pepper.”
“You swooned like an overwrought Victorian maiden,” Barton said placidly, and held up a glass of water. “Now take your painkillers like a good boy, and get some sleep. The entire team is here, not the mention the scary Amazon army, and there’s a whole bunch of yelling happening right now that I promise you, you’ll want to be asleep for. Apparently the politics here are just as much fun as those at home, and I don’t know about you, but I’m not real keen on getting stuck in the middle of it all.”
“I think we should get him the action figures,” Rhodey said, watching the interaction with no small measure of amusement from the far side of the room. “Or maybe the plush toys.”
Tony turned, tensing. Maximoff and Barnes were both there, as if summoned by magic, or by… OK, well, that just confirmed that he was being surveilled.
Umar, who seemed to belong more to the tales of Ur and Babylon than in the modern world. Umar, who tore open the membranes between worlds with the pain contained in children’s bodies.
The Steve in Tony’s mind’s eye had both hands up on the screen, trying to position it so that he could see properly. He’d managed to climb up on the table, unsettling the pebble and the screen, and was now trying to fix it with all the grace and efficiency of a distressed child.
“I have thirty-two dead guards who would disagree with that statement,” T’Challa said, his voice eminently reasonable. “Who are you, and what do you want with the child? I will not ask again.” At that, M’Baku shifted silently from foot to foot.
(There should always be one, Rhodey had told him, after he’d said goodbye to his own mother and shipped off for his first deployment. There should always be at least one person whose priority is not the mission, or the war, or the world, but you. Just you, and your safety, and having you come home at the end of the day. There should always be one person for whom you come first.)
To his surprise, she nodded. “I know,” she said quietly. “That’s why I told you to listen. So you’d remember there is still unfinished business.” She looked up at him and smiled. “You know, I had a whole section in your assessment - your first team assessment - about your compulsive need for family. You look for it everywhere you go. You collect people into it, and when you need more than what’s there, you make them yourself, with your own hands.” She reached out and closed a hand around his gauntleted wrist. “Every time you look at that child, I want you to remember that you can’t resolve anything that happened between you until Steve is back.”
The thought had occurred to Tony. “If so, I’ll get us out of here.” Somehow, he doubted that anyone would be coming back. What he’d seen in the other room - the careful arrangement of bodies, the ritual aspects of it - had seemed pretty… final. Wherever the magic user had gone, they’d taken what they’d needed. Why would they come back for the corpses? “Tell the rescue to hurry, would you, baby girl? This place gives me the creeps.” He glanced back at the sleeping Steve. “And tell them to bring blankets and medical supplies, okay?”
“There is no one else,” T’Challa said. He looked away briefly, looking troubled. “Mr Barnes has elected to go back into cryogenic suspension. And Ms Maximoff would attract too much attention if she leaves Wakanda.”
Steve looked up from where he was carefully smoothing down his drawings on top of his neatly stacked dozen or so books and clambered to his feet. He presented himself to Tony - clad in clean and mostly rumple-free clothes, sockless feet jammed into his Iron Man sneakers. “I’m all ready!” He declared, pointing to the small box of toys and the pile of books with clear accomplishment on his face. “When are we going?”
But his own aborted attempts to make peace with Wanda Maximoff were neither here nor there where Steve’s best interests were concerned. Especially not when he had other options he could explore. He sighed. “Look. I’m not going to rehash a discussion that’s already settled. It’s not because of you, it’s -” He stuttered to a stop, unsure of how to articulate his feelings. There was a lot in there, and most of it wasn’t stuff he was willing to share. Things about whether Rogers might actually
“What the hell do you want, Barnes?” Tony looked down at the wriggle in his arms and let Steve slide free to promptly hide behind his leg. “Look, you frightened him. Nice work. Kill any rabbits lately?”
Tony thought, his heart in his mouth. To harp on about privacy having listened to that recording… He should have refused outright, or just deleted the files, he should have done anything other than -
“About an hour ago,” Vision said with a smile. He was wearing a human guise, the red and green - and the cape - cloaked effectively behind a blonde, blue-eyed innocence. Tony wouldn’t have been able to pick him out of a crowd if he didn’t know what he was looking for. “The need for subterfuge expired after we knew the trap had worked. It is good to see you recovered from your injuries.” He looked down at where Steve was hiding against Tony’s leg. “We have not met, Steve,” he said softly. “I am a friend of your older self. My name is Vision.”
“You haven’t listened to them yet?” Wilson interrupted, surprise on his face. “I’d have thought… OK, no, go on.”
Back in the living room, Steve had grown tired of waiting for him to come back and had attempted the large jam jar and the unwieldy butter knife by himself.
“Ah. So you’re here to play babysitter in case it all goes belly-up.” Tony looked across at the suit. It could still do with a few more hours, but he hadn’t lied to the kid: if the proverbial hit the fan, he could fly them both out of there. Of course, there wasn’t anywhere
Okoye straightened up beside Barnes. “There is no strategic value in using the child,” she said slowly. She tipped her head to one side, concentrating. “Unless there is a link between the creator of the portals and him that we cannot see.”
, and everything else was just a little too slick to have been handled by civilians. The identities for Barton and Barnes were of actual people who’d worked for him previously; well, Barnes was, and he’d bet that Barton was also wearing the face of someone who had been on the Stark Industries payroll in the past. The airport was fine - Pepper would likely have gone for the same one - but the two cars flanking the limo were definitely over-kill. Tony hadn’t allowed that level of security since he’d first come home from Afghanistan, and maybe not even then. Pepper would have known that. Hill… Hill wouldn’t have cared.
Tony squinted at him. “FRIDAY provided the quinjet,” he said flatly. “Right. Rather than sending Vision, or -” or Rhodey, he’d been about to say, but snapped his mouth shut before it could escape.
“In more ways than one,” Romanoff said, sotto voce. She laid her monitoring pebble on the table and picked up her own mug of coffee, sitting back in her chair. “You sure you want to do this with us here?”
Next time - efforts kick off on multiple fronts on the de-magicking plans, the deployed group gets a chance to see first-hand what's going on, and Rhodey really hates physio.
(Barton had volunteered to come along mostly to act as a buffer zone. It was either that, or he wanted front-row seats for when Tony and Barnes finally strangled each other.)
“Right.” Tony folded his legs and leaned back in his seat, spreading his arms in as easy and welcoming a gesture as he could manage, given the lingering strain in his shoulders and back from spending the night slumped in a chair. “The child. You know what happened - the portal, the mind stone - when I was away?”
“Yeah, no, I’m not OK with this.” He didn’t fucking care what sort of yarn this guy was spinning. Not after what he’d tried to do to the kid.
(Maybe it would have been better if she had been just as cold in turn. That, at least, he knew what to do with. Not a Natasha visibly hurt over his jibes. Not one who seemed to be trying to meet him halfway.)
the thing-that-wasn’t-him said, and there was something frantic in the way that it wound itself around him, wet and pained and grasping.
had turned out. Had he been able to get away this entire time, or had there been an opportunity while Tony and Okoye were away?
Steve hesitated another couple of moments, then shyly let go of Tony and extended his hand to shake.
The image that sprang up - Steve, pale-faced and too-quiet - instantly killed off any remnants of levity. Tony’s hands clenched on the table-top at the look in Steve’s eyes.
He was under no illusions about the level of contact that T’Challa expected the research lab to maintain, or that he was essentially removing the one real block - himself - to Mordo putting access to Steve back on the table.
“Perhaps we should clarify. We have come into contact with an associate of yours, and he has advised us to contact you.”
“Sure. He’s having a lie-in, huh?” He’d been aiming for some vague note of innuendo, mostly by reflex, but judging by Rhodey’s expression he’d fallen somewhat short. “I mean -”
He was on his feet suddenly, shoving at her, at the false image. His hands were icy where they touched the edges of it, trying to erase it.
Okoye did not seem particularly pleased to see Tony, barely sparing him a glance as she glared daggers at the swordsman on the screen. “He is stubborn,” she said, sounding frustrated. “They are both stubborn.” She said something else in a language Tony didn’t recognise, but by inference thought was not particularly complimentary about either T’Challa or M’Baku’s sense of self-preservation. Beside her, one of the other Dora smirked. The Jabariland warriors behind them looked long-suffering.
Rogers gazes back at him evenly. The balls on the guy, Tony thinks, to come down to Tony’s workshop and ask Tony for
he had said, as if he acknowledged the weight of what he had tried to do, and yet would do it again at the first opportunity.
Steve stirred a little under Tony’s hand. “Mom?” He asked drowsily. His eyes were still closed. Trusting.
He cleared his throat, looking down at the towhead leaning against his shoulder. “Hey. Why don’t you get dressed and then help me pack, huh? You can help me pack up your drawings so they don’t get crumpled.”
(His cardiologist says the tachycardia is a worry, and gives him beta blockers. His psychiatrist says that the anxiety is a worry, and gives him beta blockers. Whatever it is, the symptoms are the same, and the treatment is the same, and as long Tony has a problem with a name, he can fix it.)
Trying to figure out Wilson's reasoning on the Accords has been such a struggle, not least because I would have thought that - as he has a military background - he'd be in favour of oversight. The fact that he wasn't, combined with his direct experiences of how the US military treats mental health needs, made me think on this point. No, this isn't the reason why Wilson is pissed off at Tony, but it does explain why - at least in part - why his instinctive reaction to the Accords was "hell, no!" and why he tried to work out a way to compromise afterwards, once things turned south.
in that voice. As if he’d been thinking it over and over in his head, this perfect impossible ask - next to the
Minoru nodded. “Then consider him vouched for. I know of this threat, and we have been considering our response to it. We shall need to coordinate on this, once we have our method of entry.”
“Good tailwind,” he said, his eyes on the closed bedroom door. “Katniss, you know where the coffee is, help yourself.” He waved a hand in the vague direction of the coffee pot. Barton could caffeinate, or not, as he pleased; with Romanoff available, he’d probably be more willing to open up, anyway. Actually, come to think of it, that's probably why he’d followed Tony in the first place, old habits dying hard. “How’s Steve?”
“Lunchtime. We’re going to chase the sun all the way out to California. How’s that sound?” He laughed at the way Steve’s eyes widened and pointed at the little table in the living room corner where he’d placed the breakfast tray delivered earlier. “Go on, time for food first, and then we’ll go say our goodbyes.” He thought for a moment. He really wasn’t looking forward to that conversation.
She glowered at him and turned to Barton, who was busy examining his shoes in an effort to give Tony the illusion of privacy. “Agent Barton. Can I trust you to notify us if his condition deteriorates? He is cleared, but the risk of blood clots without the anticoagulants cannot be eliminated entirely.”
Human, then. Or at least familiar enough with Western pop culture to pass as one. “I’d respond appropriately, but, to be honest, you don’t especially seem like a decent fellow, so I’m afraid that -” He lunged forward, mouth half-open to try the unibeam on the lowest setting. “FRIDAY, uni-”
Because it was obvious even to him that Barton wasn’t. That Barton hadn’t been sleeping, and hadn’t had his wounds tended to. And where was everyone else, other than ‘deployed’? Not that he was in any fit state to be of much help, of course… “Well, given everything, I guess we’ll have to raincheck that round at the gym, huh?” He said instead, tentative. He wouldn’t have thought that Barton would care that much, but…
Steve looked up at him in wonder as the suit heating elements kicked in, cranked up a little higher than normal to compensate for the open chest plate.
, he really is, but every time he opens his mouth, it just seems to be to fit another foot in there. (I like to think of him as subscribing to the 'fake it 'til you make it' philosophy of reconciliation.)
“I’m sure he won you the entire stuffed animal gallery, Barnes, that doesn’t mean you can give him a gun,” Tony said sharply. He didn’t know how he felt about Barnes making an effort - and he had, clearly he had, albeit an odd and clumsy one - and he didn’t know how he felt about Steve’s interest, either. But some things - such as a gun near the kid - he had very strong opinions on. He put a hand on Steve’s shoulder and firmly steered him towards the bedroom. “OK, kid, let’s get you into your travelling gear if we have to make a speedy exit. Action man over here can watch out for Norman Bates.” He made a face as he ushered the child out of sight. “Can the seven year old handle a gun, my God…”
“How about with - well, gosh, Tony, I’m glad you’re coming back to the US, it hasn’t been the same without you and Stark Industries sure does need its Head of R&D back! Sure, I’d be thrilled to help you with this little thing!”
Numbly, he nodded. He should probably hand Steve over to the med team and be done with it - he needed to be there to talk with the others - but... well, he wasn’t too sure whether he’d be welcome at the briefing, if truth be told. Not if Barton and Romanoff were running the show. And Steve hadn’t let go of his death-grip on Tony’s undersuit, not even in his fevered sleep.
doing here? I told FRIDAY…” He’d told her to send help. And he’d got Barton and Romanoff instead. Where was Vision? And what the hell was Rhodey doing in Wakanda, he was supposed to be in - “You said you were doing down to Bethesda,” he said, bewildered. “I asked if you wanted to stay in New York, and you said you needed some space to concentrate on your recovery and you were being transferred down to Walter Reed. You
He planted himself in front of his tablet and managed an approximation of his usual ‘investors’ stance - shoulders back, limbs loose, big smile - before tapping the ‘accept call’ button. ("Always take important calls on your feet, Tony," Obie had used to say, back when Tony had been learning the ropes. "It makes you more alert. It also prompts people not to waste your time."
Tony gave him a full twenty seconds of maximum glare before finally relenting. “Other than her walking in my dreams, that is.”
“So why are you carrying it out of if it’s such a stupid idea?” Tony asked, half-turning away. Steve was still too rigid in his arms and he hoisted him up a little, trying to position him in a more comfortable way. “You just finished telling me that there’s no risk, now you’re telling me that you disagreed with the plan? You can’t have it both ways, Barton. Why are you going along with it if you argued against it?”
Barton shrugged, his eyes on the viewscreen. For all his advice that Tony should relax, he didn’t look especially laid-back himself. His jaw was clenched, and the skin was tight around his eyes.
“The attack happened.” T’Challa turned ashen-faced. “The radiation increased when the attack was happening. The child - the child is still linked to the portal?”
There was an almost imperceptible pause before FRIDAY answered. “His majesty, King T’Challa, is on the line for you, boss. He apologises for the late hour. He says it's urgent.”
Pepper had yelled, and Tony had been good. He’d let the doctors tape up his ribs after Siberia, and when they asked if there was anything else, he’d said,
She did not pretend to misunderstand. “There is a recording for you to review. He’s asleep for the moment.” Her eyes flickered between Barton and Tony. “He’ll be pleased to see you. He was a little… stressed.”
Tony shook his head to clear it. “I - all right,” Tony said, hating how uncertain he sounded. “I’ll do the physio.” Because, really, what were his options? The Wakandan court had ruled him able to take care of Steve; if he was badly hurt, they could easily rule the other way. And if Steve was with someone else, some
ready for something that drastic, not when there was still a chance of Steve re-aging to adulthood. But it was good to have options, he reasoned. Pep surely knew that as well.)
Little wonder that there hadn’t been any serious move to get Barnes set-up with babysitting duties; in the event that the kid’s affections had been transferred, Tony had little doubt that T’Challa would have placed Steve with child services and arranged for carefully-supervised visits by the Soldier. In retrospect, possibly it was a smart move on the kid’s part to not attach himself to the one man who wouldn’t be allowed near him unsupervised. But that didn’t remove the immediate problem. “And what happens when Ross finds out that I have in my custody a seven year old Steve Rogers?”
Put him in a suit, give him a lectern and an autocue, and he could be standing in front of world leaders explaining calmly, gently, why Umar was a grave threat, and why the world needed to work together. Why they should choose option A, and not option B. Why Mordo’s judgement on this should be relied upon.
This was so completely 180 to what Tony had thought they were discussing that all Tony could do was blink at him, stunned.
T’Challa smiled a little. “He will not. Data protection is taken very seriously in Wakanda, and medical records have our highest protection. No one will be able to access them. And there is no reason for General Ross to suspect that the Captain is now a child.” He got to his feet; everyone automatically followed suit. “I believe we have planned for all eventualities, Dr Stark. On balance, this is the approach that will provide optimum results. Please do sign all the forms the Child Safeguarding Team provide, and I will leave to you, Sergeant Barnes and Ms Maximoff to decide on what approach to take to attempt re-aging the Captain. Colonel Rhodes, thank you again for your assistance. Everyone else - thank you all for coming, please be ready to depart in two hours.”
Well, OK, probably that was more for the kid’s benefit than Tony’s; and sure, Tony could probably stretch to that for half an hour or so. He’d never done it before, and it might even be fu- “Is that an
“You’re OK, it’s all OK. Come on, now, why don’t you tell me what’s wrong? You hungry? You hurt anywhere?”
. We didn’t know if you’d found a corpse, or if there’d been serious damage and we’d find both of your bodies, or...” He glanced down at where Steve was splayed out on Tony’s chest, the small face tucked over Tony’s shoulder. His expression softened. “FRIDAY sent me a copy of your conversation with her. D’you know how freaked out you sounded? You both needed rescue. What did you think was gonna happen when something like that kicks off, Stark? We fucking
“I see.” Minoru looked thoughtful, leaning back in her chair. Then, “well, I do apologise for wasting your time.”
It was wonderfully cold and soothing against his parched tongue and he sucked hungrily. He drifted off for a moment - longer, maybe, then resurfaced. He'd missed something, maybe... “Hmmm? You say something?”
Steve, the Steve that had smiled at him from across his workshop, that had sparred with him long after everyone else had gone to bed, the Steve that he’d looked at and thought,
RE: Rhodey... let's not kid around, if he was receiving treatment for mental health issues such as depression or PTSD, no one would clear him to be flying around a suit of armour with missiles all over it. The fact that Tony could do that as a civilian is another interesting perk of the US position on weapons control (but that's an argument for another day).
The small face scrunched up in thought, the knife wavering. “I don't know you. And I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.”
Mordo would 100% prefer any version of the plan to involve him being in charge, and not being leaned on by Wanda. Them's the breaks, Mordo, maybe don't go after Steve's head and everyone would play nicer.
he wasn’t alone, and wasn’t that the kicker? Because that knowledge had been volunteered, it had been surrendered to him as a peace offering. It had to be because the thing inside him had announced itself, had made itself known, and not because he had figured it out or learned to tell the difference of what was his own fear and that brought to him by someone else. It had to be, because he knew, now, that what he’d thought before hadn’t been his own mind at work, and he still wasn’t sure if he’d be able to stop it from happening again.
Tony thought with dismay. If Rhodey was able to function as War Machine - if he still wanted to - he’d be damned if he’d let some neanderthal machismo posturing on the part of anyone else get in his way.
Yeah, no. “Really? Just like that, the whole gang back together. Is everyone singing kumbaya? Did I miss the group hug?” He could feel the assholishness of his tone grating, but he couldn’t stop himself. Sure, Rhodey and Vis would be kicking back in Birnin Zana, probably having a nice drink with Wilson, maybe playing a bit of croquet with Maximoff.
Tony was abruptly awake, suddenly aware of being sprawled out in his chair with a child slumped in his arms, Barnes bending over him. “Christ!”
“Good girl.” Satisfied with the suit’s instructions and general readiness, he headed back to his seat.
Tony looked down at the pebble he held in his hands. He’d carried it with him from Birnin Zana, he’d had it with him during his convalescence.
Barnes looked at Steve. Steve - peeking around Tony’s leg with interest - looked back. “He… I thought… We went to the Boardwalk on Coney Island, one summer. I thought…” He shook his head. “I thought I remembered…”
After a moment, Tony dropped him to the ground, disgusted. He kept the repulsor trained on Mordo’s face as Okoye stepped forward and grabbed the bracelets, hesitating. Was it even worth putting them on him? Master Minoru stood to one side, seemingly not inclined to intervene one way or the other. They had to check on the others, they had to make sure that no one was hurt. They had to - “FRIDAY, check in with Vision.”
He didn’t need to look down to see how his hand was curled around the bowl rather than the handle of the cup.
The light abruptly dimmed, and Tony opened his eyes cautiously. Rhodey smiled back at him from beside the bed. He looked tired, dark circles smudged under his eyes and stubble on his chin. His clothes were rumpled, as if he’d been sleeping in them. “What -” Tony started, distressed. Something was wrong. His arms closed around empty air, the movement strange and upsetting. Where was…? Something was...
Tony was wondering if this conversation was one he should have saved for when they were safely within US territorial waters and it was all a done deal. As it was, Steve was busy packing up his things and getting dressed, and Tony had thought, foolishly,
Her first loyalty would be to the crown; her first priority would be having T’Challa’s back. Which was fine, except in cases where T’Challa decided to make stupid fucking decisions.
He hadn’t had one that bad for a while. He’d had disturbed dreams, sure - the week or so immediately after Siberia hadn’t exactly been a cakewalk - but he’d thought he was getting better, dammit. He’d thought…
He was watching Hill with narrowed eyes, seeming to think it over. “Yeah, OK. That’s… OK.” he relaxed slowly.
” He looked back at the closed door behind him - Vision having closed it behind him with pantomimed emphasis - and then back at the screen. “Mr Vision was with me when it happened, and I remember bits of what happened, but not all of it,” he said. He’d shifted so he was too close to the screen, cutting off the top of his head and giving Tony a view of his neck and ears and not much else. “I think Mr Vision was scared, because he went away and didn’t come back again. Miss Natasha is watching me now.” He scooted back down so only his eyes showed, filling the entire screen. “But I do remember, bits of it, I told him all I could.” He seemed to be pleading with Tony to understand that he had done his best, that he had pulled together all the recollections he had of something terrifying; something
“That! The - the overcompensating.” Rhodey’s mouth was a thin line. He turned away abruptly. “Look, I need to get down to the physio anyway, why don’t you walk with me. We can talk on the way. I was… there was something I wanted to talk to you about, anyway.”
Romanoff came to collected him about twenty minutes later. Tony hastily extricated himself from the suddenly frantic Steve - repeating his promise to come back straight after the meeting, and to bring Barnes with him - and followed her, hurriedly throwing on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt to replace his fetching open-backed gown. (The hospital didn’t kick up a fuss about him leaving, which just made him suspect that neither he nor Steve were technically registered. T’Challa would probably not want any paper trail of their visit.)
He thought about keeping his mouth shut, but… “You should take your own advice a little bit. I get that you’re angry at Rogers - and me - and I get
“It’ll keep the heat in,” Tony said, with more conviction than he felt. He knew the physics of it, of course, but his brain didn’t want to believe the truth of it, not when it looked like what you’d use to truss up a turkey. “It’s a space blanket.”
He’d made good progress on the results and implications around residual trace radiation after a portal connection when there was a faint sound from outside - from the corridor - that made him pause, pen in hand. He frowned. It hadn’t sounded like fighting, precisely, but there was something strange about -
Pepper took her hand away; the better to scowl at him, Tony thought. “Well, gosh, Tony, I’m always glad you haven’t managed to get yourself killed - though not for lack of trying on your part I assume - and I’ll of course help you, but have you lost your goddamned mind?” She dropped out of the mocking tone, her mouth twitching as she visibly willed the frown away. “I’m serious. This is such a bad idea.”
“It’s not that easy.” After a moment, Rhodey looked at him and managed a smile. “You remember when I was in Iraq, the last time?” He asked.
“It’s totally SkyNet,” Barton muttered, sotto voce. “Steve is probably a reincarnated John Connor.” He smirked at Tony. “Hey, does that make you his mom?”
The doctor stood, slotting the tablet against the foot of the bed. “OK, well, I’ll leave you in the therapist’s capable hands. Agent Barton, you’ll be around, yes?”
He heard again, from a long way away. Someone was nearby, someone who meant him harm, someone who was a danger to him and to the child. Someone was -
Yes, when he’d thought that it was just a question of the kid’s recovery! But truth be told, he hadn’t considered what an undocumented child would mean, and what ‘being in charge’ would entail. He’d had sort of vague idea of being around while Wakandan nannies and health care workers did the actual job of looking after the kid, at least until they could turn him back. He’d also assumed that they hadn’t been registered at the hospital, but obviously T’Challa disagreed with flying under the radar by burning all traces of his presence. No, he was instead drowning them in bureaucracy and protocol.
FRIDAY’s familiar lilt washed over them both, picking up smoothly from where Tony had left off when reading to Steve those nights back at Birnin Zana.
“Probably the intention.” No one thought twice about a shop-front; put flashing neon signs on it and people tended to glaze over, their tired eyes skipping to the street crossing lights or the glare of the car headlights or the glow of their smartphones. (You could find Stark Tower by looking
RE: Rhodey, soldiers, Pep/Happy, priorities... Tony is very much not a soldier. And Steve is very much one. So when Steve chooses to put his family before his country (before - in Tony's view - justice), that's a major kick in the teeth to how Steve has portrayed himself to others in the past, especially Tony. I'm 100% sure that Tony would follow orders that he knows he wouldn't survive, as evidenced by New York. I'm also 100% sure that he wouldn't be able to give those orders to someone else. Maybe that changes further down the line, but to my mind, where he is at that point, that's not a thing he'd be able to do. So, while he acknowledges that he is not a soldier, and the other civilians are not soldiers, I think he has come to realise that there
This did not seem to perturb Mordo as much as Barton might have wished. “Perhaps,” he said quietly. He looked back at Tony with that same open, sad look in his eyes. “Perhaps I should have asked him to choose instead. But you need to understand something: he would have made exactly the same choice.” Tony tensed at that, and Mordo shook his head in response. “Perhaps not the guards; maybe he would have taken a different approach. But the child? One life would not hold this world hostage. One life could
Steve was still straddling Tony’s hips, his hands on Tony’s chest. Tony’s eyes were wide and fearful, and there was blood, so much blood, Steve’s hands slippery with it as he clamped them down over the wound, trying to staunch the flow.
He hears Rogers sigh a little as he turns towards the door. “Tony,” Rogers says and then pauses. His whole body is rigid, as if braced for a blow. “Uh… if there isn't anything to be done...”
, is linked to his mental state rather than his physical one. Half of him - the same half, so mad he is almost vibrating - wants to tell him that all he needs to do to make Tony feel better is
“OK, we’re ready,” the stranger who had to be Barton - and wearing the same suit / wire combo, sans gloves - said. He had a Stark Industries pass clipped to his belt. “The car’s signalled us. Is there anything that isn’t safe to leave to your staff to transport?”
eavesdropping, and sighed. “Let’s get this over with. Legolas, hurry up with the coffee, I’m dead on my feet.”
Would he be able to say anything at all? Or would he be looking at the child’s bed, and the abandoned sneakers on the side, the Iron Man motif rampant on each foot, a tracer tucked in beside the laces….
“He’s said no for the moment, but he may not have a lot of choice. We haven’t made much headway in tracking down this Umar who’s supposedly the Big Bad, and I doubt Mordo is going to be sitting and cooling his heels if we don’t kick things off again.” He took a deep breath. With him and Barton gone, who did that leave to argue Steve’s corner? “I know it’s a lot to ask, especially as you’re just out of surgery. But I need someone I can trust to be in that room.”
Hearing the sword guy’s yell of rage as he sped them out of reach was possibly the most satisfying thing he’d heard all week.
He didn’t know if it was possible to preserve this version of Steve, or even if that was the right thing to do, given everything the child had gone through. But it didn’t seem any more moral to simply reset the clock and try to put Steve back, as if the last few weeks had never happened, and get the adult Steve in his place. Functionally, it would be putting Steve back where he was supposed to be, in his mother’s arms.
Barton returned a few minutes later with an armful of sniffling child. “Mister!” The kid sobbed, and more or less flung himself at Tony. Only Barton’s steel hold on him prevented him from landing on Tony’s chest, face-first. Instead he was lowered gently to Tony’s side so he could crawl up to wrap an arm around Tony’s neck, Barton’s admonishment to be gentle going unheard. He looked up at Tony, disconsolate, face streaked with tears and snot. “You’re alive!” His voice was shaky with hiccuped sobs.
Tony thought, but did not say. An awful lot of the team’s success had hinged on blind luck in the past; he could only hope that it wouldn’t abruptly run short. He cleared his throat and tried to focus. “OK, so Interpol got into it. Then what?”
Steve hesitated, looking quickly up at Tony, then back to Lang. “Yes,” he said in a small voice. His grip on Tony tightened, as if he was afraid that might be the wrong answer.
Okoye elbowed him sharply. “Master Minoru,” she said - and turned to the woman at their side. “I apologise for my error.”
“It distressed him,” Tony said bluntly. “He was aware of the presence of the other Steve’s mind inside his own, and it was very frightening and possibly painful for him.”
Maneuvering back to the pallet, Tony ended up with his back against the wall, Steve curled up in his arms, the blanket wrapped around them both. “FRIDAY, bring the suit here and crank up the heat as much as you can, alright,” he muttered, and the suit obligingly got up and positioned itself beside them, the chest still open. He patted Steve’s back. “I’m really sorry I yelled, Steve,” he tried again. “I was just tired and angry with everything. I shouldn’t have taken it out on you.”
he thought uneasily. Steve could be altered in any number of ways and they’d have no way of knowing until he woke up. Checking up on him was pointless.
“Oh, I’m sorry if I gave the impression of caring about any effects,” Tony bit out and then winced at the kick Barton delivered to his shin. “If he’s not gonna help with the kid, what use is he?”
“Something is happening outside, I need to go check. I need you to stay out of sight, OK? Stay inside the room, hide out of sight if you can. Alright?” He shook Steve’s shoulders a little, forcing the child to make eye-contact. “Look at me. Promise?”
but hadn’t he wanted Barton to do that? Wasn’t the whole point to deposit the kid at casa del A-Team and then get back to a full schedule of nightmares and anxiety?
; believe me, I do, and if I could give anything to undo it… but, listen. You’re no good to Rhodey if you don’t look after yourself, ‘cause all it does is make Rhodey do it. And he has enough on his plate.”
Shivering as the cold hit him dead-on, Tony made his way outside - not too far, and keeping the entrance in his line of sight - to take care of the call of nature.
Tony got to his feet with a hiss of pain at the stiffness in his joints, pointedly ignoring the quick look Barton threw him. “He’s cold, malnourished and not breathing especially well,” he said shortly. “Did you bring blankets?”
“Yeah, but they probably thought you’d have someone spotting your form or something.” Tony sat down behind him, his legs spread wide on either side of Rhodey’s Buddha position. He eased Rhodey up then carefully adjusted Rhodey’s hips so that he was sitting evenly and his back was straight. “OK, try it now.”
He should have known better. Dammit, he should have known better! It was human nature, and it’s not like he was above it himself. Wouldn’t he trade Barnes, Maximoff, Lang, the whole fucking lot of them, for just ten more minutes with his mom? Wouldn’t he trade them all for the chance to bring back those he loved?
Well, that answered that. Tony briefly wondered what ‘real sick’ constituted, but then decided he didn’t really want to know.
” Tony frantically converted the time zones in his head. “05:24 local time - that was in Oakland, right? So that would make it...middle of the afternoon, Wakandan time.” He turned to T’Challa. “Right around the time -”
Which probably explained why Barnes had bolted at the first sign of rejection on the part of kid!Steve. Tony didn’t buy Rogers driving Barnes away, not when he’d burned his entire life on the pyre of getting even a fraction of him back. But Barnes could have run, sure, if he felt that he was in danger of being rejected. He looked down at the child in his arms. Maybe this version of Steve was too familiar to what Barnes remembered?
Barton’s jaw clenched. “We didn’t have a lot of choice,” he muttered, visibly trying not to fidget. “And with everything - there wasn’t time to reach Rhodes, so…”
Tony took a deep breath of mountain air, closing his eyes against the memory of Steve’s pale face, tight with terror. “I’m fine, Legolas. Let’s get on with it.”
Because he’d hated Steve Rogers when he’d found him not a soldier or a hero, after all, but just a man, who’d put his family first. (Because Steve had lied, and said otherwise, and made Tony feel guilty and small for his own fears.)
“Of course he aced Chem, he’s a good kid, he studies - just keep him on ice, OK, I’ve got my hands full a bit, and -” He just had to get this sorted, and then he could pick things up with Peter (who was old enough to hopefully not get killed in the meantime, and man alive was Tony ever grateful for the ‘training wheels’ protocol).
Rhodey would tell him to lay down on the wire, if it came down to it, Tony had no hesitation over that. Rhodey would lay down his own life; hell, he’d already made the sacrifice play. Tony had no hesitation over following Rhodey’s orders into doing the same.
“Absolutely,” Tony agreed easily. He slid his hands in his pockets, turning his back to the window and leaning against the glass. “So, if it wasn’t about Barnes, what was it about, then? Just for my own edification.”
Tony shoved him off and pushed past Okoye to reach the cell door as it slid open. He had a repulsor six inches from Mordo’s face before Barnes rounded the corner and caught up to him, Wanda on his heels. “That’s close enough, D’Artagnan,” he snapped. “Back inside.”
M’Baku rolled his shoulders back. “Stark makes a good point. Fairy tales and monsters - it is a good story. But all we have are children’s corpses and radiation. For all we know, you are working with this butcher and this is simply a ploy to access the one child you have not slaughtered, yet.”
It came out sad, somehow; as if she’d been hoping for something that now remained out of reach. Tony felt an odd pang of regret at that. He quashed it, straightening his back, feeling absurdly under attack. The warm glow from earlier hadn’t entirely faded, and he’d have liked it to continue just a little longer, thank you very much.
He let Barnes stew in the resulting silence and just tried to keep the kid comfortable. He hadn’t eaten yet - and there was no telling when their trap would be sprung - so he grabbed some of the leftover pancakes from the night before and coaxed Steve into munching on a couple of them, wincing a little as greasy, sticky fingers promptly smeared passion fruit jam all over the suit’s shoulder joint.
?! Tony, look at me, are you OK?” Rogers at least has the courtesy to grimace the moment that inanity leaves his lips. “Stupid question, sorry. Uh… FRIDAY mentioned that you had, uh, medication for your heart. Is it here? Should I get it? Or, some water? Or…”
“You didn't answer my question,” Steve said, waving the knife menacingly. His voice had gained a shrillness normally associated with missed naptimes or the loss of favourite toys. “Are you a bad guy?”
No, he fucking didn’t. Why was Barton there? Wasn’t he in - oh, wait. No. Hmmm. Siberia, Ossetia, Wakanda, the sword guy -
“Ah.” That seemed to clarify several points for Minoru. Something perilously close to grief flickered across her face for a moment. “I understand now. The ‘Steve’ whose welfare you needed to reassure yourselves of, earlier.” She looked back at Tony, inclining her head thoughtfully as she stared up at him. “Very well. When the time is right, we shall… discuss it.”
“Um,” Tony said, trying to stop himself from turning bright red. “In that case - thank you for the kind gift?”
Between them, Happy and Pepper had managed to hit more or less every point he’d hoped he would be able to skirt over. And this one… well, it hadn’t been a pleasant negotiation, and he was still of two minds about it. How would they react, knowing what they did? He winced. “Um…”
Tony thought. For all that Barnes had clearly taken Tony’s earlier words to heart and was trying to connect with Steve, seeing him in this state was probably not doing his mental state any favours. A little too familiar to the face in his memories, and yet completely uninterested in being best buds; that was bound to be both confusing and painful.
Those who know their Doctor Strange comicverse may have already worked out who our mystery evil sorceress is. Mordo certainly has, and he's not terribly pleased.
“Human is good?” Tony asked, a little doubtful, and took hold of Steve’s hand, falling into step beside her.
She didn’t need to say anything else. Tony had seen the state of the bodies in the storage room; he couldn’t imagine anyone surviving that sort of torture for very long, even if medical care had been immediate.
. If he was being charitable, Tony could ascribe his tendency to be a perpetual asshole to a lack of brain matter rather than active malice. (Or assholish impulses quickly tempered by bouts of conscience.) But no amount of forced levity was lifting the grimness in the room. Lang, for instance, had been grey-faced the entire time, visibly holding back the impulse to vomit. (And no, Tony really didn’t need to listen to Barton’s bonding sessions with Barnes to add to the roiling feeling in his own stomach. If Barton had been intending to distract him from his flailing stagger across their verbal minefield, he’d done a piss-poor job of it.)
of it are green. Those are avocado. The orange bits are mango. And the red bits are some sort of local berry.”
Well, that issue was being resolved, one way or the other. This particular apocalypse clearly didn’t need him in the field (at least until they figured out where said field was), and he was no good to anyone moping about in a cave in Wakanda. That way madness lay. No, going back to the States was the right move, he was sure of it. He had a lot more in the way of options there, not to mention resources, allies and commitments.
“Oh, now.” Tony’s brow furrowed. “Not that I don’t appreciate the paranoid stalking, and we all know I’m in no position to cast stones. But, still.” He frowned. “I’m gonna have to do something about that.”
Steve shook his head, his eyes still on the foil-wrapped pallet. “Why don’t you put the suit back on if you’re cold?”
He glanced back at the closed bedroom door and decided to make the most out of having the kid still asleep. He showered as quickly as humanly possible and fixed up some coffee. He’d need to get the suit fixed, of course. It was patched up enough to have some of the emergency functions back, but if they had a prolonged fight coming, it needed a few more hours of work.
“Yeah. Wasn’t pretty. Barnes - he didn’t have too good a time of it, either. I think whatever it is Steve said to him really upset him.”
“I could really do with Shuri’s help,” Tony said, almost stumbling over his words. He looked away. “I can’t do anything here. We need to get Steve to her lab, I need to be able to confer with Shuri and Jane Foster without having to hold things up to a video screen or try to guess at what interventions we can try. I need access to that lab, and to their research.”
The glowy shield flashed bright across Tony’s vision as it moved - confusingly, incomprehensibly - from being on Tony’s right side, below him, to suddenly being on his left, and above him. It came down, once, twice, the impact across the HUD sharp and jarring, making Tony see stars as his head rang. The shield lifted for a third time, and started to come down - the edge, this time, sharp as any knife - heading unerringly towards the vulnerable eye-slits in the face-plate.
Plus, this line of questioning had the bonus of making Barton blanche and squirm as if someone had put a hook through him. “Er…” He hovered uncertainly over the chair by Tony’s side, as if contemplating bolting.
. He sighed. Sam would likely agree with that assessment. He knew Wanda would. And hadn’t everyone else evidently managed to stay in touch and work around their sundering
Tony's options re: Steve and the US are fairly numerous actually, but most of them he wouldn't want to use because it would draw Ross's unwanted attention. Better to just keep below the radar for as long as possible.
The quote, "Grief is the price we pay for love" is from a longer quote from psychiatrist Dr Colin Murray Parkes, from his book, “Bereavement: Studies of Grief in Adult Life” (although it's more commonly remembered from a speech given by the Queen following 9/11).
“I don’t need any medication, and you didn't answer my question,” he demands instead, hating himself a little. He knows it's weak. He's sat on the floor, Rogers carefully keeping him upright, and DUM-E is already wheeling over to try to investigate if he's OK. He has one hand tangled in the soft cotton of Rogers’s T-shirt, and the other is clutching a meaty bicep.
. He found that thought oddly cheering. Sure, he might not be a part of it any longer (and certainly not if Steve stayed a child), but at least the others seemed to be getting on OK.
Steve said, soft and broken. Behind Tony’s closed eyelids, he had that same lost look he’d worn after SHIELD fell, after everything had turned out to be another lie. (After his world had been upended, yet again.)
Not that he wanted the kid to be sick, of course. When he thought of him as a kid. When he thought of him as a kid, he wanted to go yell at his doctors about upping his meds, or getting him an extra blanket, or maybe arranging for some toys to be delivered to his bedside - not that T’Challa hadn’t already beaten him to that, but anyway. No, when he thought of Steve as a
