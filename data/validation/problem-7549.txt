And most often, where are you?
“Most people are good, Tony. Most people are also easily distracted. Turn on the news.  You might find something that interests you.  If you’re done with your Star Trek thing, that is,” Steve said easily and handed Tony the remote.  He clicked it on and hit the button for the cable news.
Steve hadn't taken the money. Steve had loved him. They could have this. He could have this again, all of it, without reservation, nothing held back, because this was real.
“Tell me I'm wrong,” Tony repeated, softly this time, almost a whisper, head tilted up towards Steve. “There's always been this—this
“Sweet dreams, Tony,” Rhodey replied, ignoring him.
That was next.  He wanted to stop.  Take a break, get some air, tell himself he would finish it later, but, there was something about this that felt like a penance he couldn’t step away from, a path of coals that needed to be walked at one time, so he could feel it, feel anything, by the end.
“You don’t know the ways these people can come at you, Captain.  Trust me. And if they can’t get at you, maybe it’s your Omega who’s the bad influence, huh?  How about that? All these rumors about him, all that talk—where there’s smoke, there’s fire, right?--and now Bonded to Captain America.  Maybe it’s this Omega who’s the probl—
“That’s ridiculous. Such aspersions upon my character. I’m hurt, Brucie-bear,” Tony muttered, frowning at the test tube as he placed it back in the rack. “Maybe I just wanted to chat, the two of us. Science-y science type things.”
What, exactly, was waiting turned out to be a carriage hooded in an oval-shaped canopy draped in red and gold cloth, held up by swirling poles in fanciful colors.  Ornately scrolling twines of carved leaves and the same flowers that decorated Zola’s compound wound their way along the sides and wheelcovers  over brightly painted and gilt-leafed scenes depicting various flora and fauna.  Two horses in matching livery pranced in front of a driver’s box, where a man sat holding the reins, though he secured them and hopped down as soon as he caught sight of Cam and Steve.  Cam chattered with delight, admiring nearly everything and everyone, though the carriage in particular seemed to fascinate him and provide a source of ongoing commentary.
“I’ve got a call with the investigators this afternoon, just to check in. Like Pepper said, they’ve backed off a bit since Stern isn’t cooperating anymore, but they know something’s up, Tony.  This whole thing with Batroc, it needs to happen quickly,” Matt pressed, standing up and extending his walking stick.
He wondered what would happen if he put it on.  Put it on, then walked out to the kitchen to get a glass of warm milk or whatever crappy excuse for Look At Me he could come up with.  Reaching up, he fingered the dog tags that hung in the center of his chest and looked at himself in the mirror.  Probably nothing would happen except then he could tell Steve they needed milk because Tony had forgotten to put it on the grocery list Happy dutifully purchased in the weeks Steve had been gone.  So, a win for calcium, but something of an anti-climatic shirt experiment, Tony thought, sharking his head and giving his reflection an annoyed eye roll.
“They aren’t for credit,” Tony said quickly, which was a mistake, he knew instantly, wincing at the level of sheer stupidity he was about to attain around Howard.
“How long has it been since you had a date?  Nineteen forty-something?” Natasha asked.  “You can’t tell me you’re happy with sleep, eat, punch things, repeat.”
“What the hell?” Tony asked the empty room.  Heal, he thought. Yeah, tell me about it.
“What’d he have to say?” Tony asked.
“Sure,” Tony heard himself say.  “Why not?  Old friends and all that, right?”
,” Anthony suggested.
“It’s just…” Tony trailed off with a long sigh.  “The whole thing with you-know-who—”
Steve wasn’t going to die.
“It was you,” Steve replied, making Tony stare at him for a long moment before he dropped his gaze and turned around to face the wall.  “You were some kind of whirlwind, that’s for sure,” he added.
“There’s an X-box,” Tony added with a slight shrug.
Yeah, that’s a real tough nut to crack, Rogers. Going to have to think on that some, Steve mentally admonished himself.
“Since I carried you out of that, ah.  Place.  Before it went up like a bonfire,” Steve said, as gently as he could.  The thought of it was still something that could make his insides go cold, always cold, despite the memory of heat.
“I’ve got you, Tony.  It’s okay now, baby.  No one is going to take you from me again,” Steve was whispering hoarsely into Tony’s skin, ghosts of words branding themselves into his flesh like invisible scars.  It hurt, to hear Steve like this.  Maybe I didn’t leave my heart in the cave after all, Tony thought, slurry with sleep and medicine and safety, scattered thoughts that kept gathering to pool in his chest before skittering away again.  He couldn’t quite grab them, not and hold on, so he held on to Steve instead, and let those thoughts go.
“Can you not call me that?  Why am I even in this?” Rhodes asked, but he was already taking off his sword and bracers.
“What about you?  Working on anything interesting?” Steve asked.
It felt familiar and brand new, Tony’s mouth on his, like the memory of a dream.  Steve moaned into the wet heat of Tony’s mouth, and Tony’s tongue slipped past the seam of Steve’s lips, delving deep, searching, sliding along Steve’s own.  It felt like an invasion.  A taking. A
Tony sucked in a shaky breath against the pillow and with another groan, pushed himself over onto his back and let out a puff of air.  Tapping his fingers lightly across the reactor in his chest, he grabbed for his phone and checked the time. Seven-thirty-four in the morning.  Dear Lord, it had to be true love, because he wasn’t even annoyed, just sort of mildly, adoringly amused at the karmic retribution of falling for a morning person.  He rolled his eyes and stared at the ceiling, then frowned, glancing towards the bathroom, where the door was closed, but a bright line of light shone through underneath. The soft susurration of the shower filled his ears.  And…something else. He frowned, momentarily confused, trying to pick out the different sounds. His eyes widened, gaze darting towards the bathroom in surprise as his face pulled into a disbelieving smile.
“Thank you.  For this. For trying, I mean,” Steve said.   He ran a hand through his hair and over his chin, scratching at the beard that was growing back in there, and looked over at Shellhead.
“I didn’t...I didn’t mean to make you feel like that,” Tony said carefully, gaze watching Steve’s hunched shoulders and the drawn, tight line of his jaw.  Tony scrubbed a hand over his mouth, flattening his lips together and glancing heavenward for support or guidance, he wasn’t sure.  “Damn.  Dammit, I should’ve thought…I got ahead of myself, and I wanted to, I don’t know, show off, I guess.  I wanted…I wanted them to know you were special.  Pepper called over, you know, to tell them what to expect. She does things like that. Thinks of things.  They didn’t even know who you were.  Had to look you up in some directory, and I just…I thought, that’s—I can’t have that.  Them not knowing.  It was stupid,” Tony admitted harshly.  “It was stupid, I know.”
Steve trailed his mouth down Tony’s neck, stopping to suck and nip, then lave with his tongue, until he found the curve of Tony’s neck, where he undid the tie at Tony’s throat and slowly peeled the top of Tony’s shift apart, following the line of skin it revealed with his lips.  He pulled back and parted the shift with one hand, letting out a shuddering breath as he looked down at Tony.
“I’ll heal,” Steve said matter-of-factly, though he brought a hand up to his chest and rubbed almost absently at it while the other hand gripped the edge of the table.  Scratch that. The other hand gripped
to dance,” he added, grinning down at Steve.  “You got, like, two left feet or something.”
“I don’t remember,” Howard replied sullenly.
“Maybe,” Tony muttered.
This was little stuff.  He knew that.  It didn’t even matter to Tony, not really, Steve knew that. Tony cared about power grids and robots and whatever it was he was ordering right and left for his machine, his CAD, that was what Coulson called it, when Steve thought it sounded magical, but hadn’t wanted to say so.   He knew none of this was actually important.
“Well, that’s…incredibly descriptive and unnecessary, but thanks,” Tony said, poking at the buttons until the beeping stopped.
“Why don’t you tell me why you’re so interested in my godson’s whereabouts,” Peggy suggested evenly. “He’s at school, I told you.  I asked Obie, but he said Tony hates these things. Always has. Refuses to come. Especially now, when his mother isn’t…” she trailed off.  Steve could picture her biting her lip, the way she used to when she wanted to take back whatever words had slipped out.
“Same for you?” Steve asked with a frown.  He could see Howard in his head, all bright-eyed and larger-than-life, full of noisy ideas that seemed to need to be shouted, all bombast and giddiness and enthusiasm, just like his son.  Or, Steve had always sort of assumed that was the case, and Stark seemed to go to great lengths to confirm the presumption, down to hosting a new Stark Expo, though from the footage SHIELD supplied, that had ended in slightly worse shape than a flying car that wouldn’t fly.  At least Iron Man had been there protecting Mr. Stark and able to stop the drones before anyone was seriously injured.
It was only a couple more days.
“I had a good time, too,” Steve said, raising his brows, a light dancing in his eyes.  “Don’t know much about taming you, though. Sounds like a tall order.”
This..this thing with Tony…it was still so new.  Fragile, though Steve didn’t think that was due to the newness. Not exactly, anyway.  Maybe fragile wasn’t the right word.  This didn’t feel fragile, standing here, letting Tony strip them both down, take all the layers off until all they had was what they carried with them.
“You killed my father, didn’t you?” Steve demanded, the words coming out breathless and choked. He should move.  He couldn’t move.
What?  His head swiveled.  “Who’s there?” he demanded, sitting up quickly enough to make bile rise in his throat.  He looked down and frowned in confusion. He was wearing, well…pajama pants, he supposed they were called.  That was odd. He’d worn his uniform going through the first time, then again going back. And…he reached up, cupping his jaw.  His face was smooth. His beard was gone.
Steve bent at the knee and lifted Tony enough to withdraw almost completely, then braced his hand by Tony’s head again, eyes shifting quickly to Tony’s face.  Tony nodded, face already slackening, and Steve pushed up, seating himself fully again.  Tony’s body juddered as Steve’s thrust found its mark, his cock bobbing between them spurting fluid.
Tony swallowed thickly, throat bobbing with the effort and reached out to pull open the conference room door.  His first thought when he walked in was that it was bright in the room, which was meaningless, but still true.  Bright sunlight streamed through a bank of floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out over the desert in the distance below an infinite blue sky.  His second thought was that Captain Rogers was probably the absolute most opposite of Obie that you could get without literally turning Obie himself inside out.
“Go ahead, laugh all you want. I may not exactly be a scintillating conversationalist, but at least I’m not the one who’d be on a plate with a side of butter back in Manhattan,” Steve grinned, pointing at the creature.
His face was almost blank, but it was the heavy weight of sadness in his voice that sent a stab of panic through Tony’s gut.  I’m losing him, Tony thought, reaching out blindly and stumbling forward, though Steve was too far away for him to touch. What could he possibly say that would make any difference? It wasn’t like what Steve was accusing him of was anything other than the truth.  He swallowed past the lump in his throat. It was the things you didn’t prepare for, the hurts you didn’t see coming, those were the worst, and nothing had prepared him for falling for Steve. It was like the universe had given him someone he was destined to lose, like one final payment on his debt come due.
“It isn’t perfect, I know.  But, it keeps the worst of it at bay, at least until you get a couple of dumb kids wanting to show off like today,” Steve said.  “We’re handling it. I—yeah, I do think it’s important, Tony.  But, it isn’t as important as you.  It never was, and I shouldn’t have let that get away from me.”
The memory was so viscerally real, Steve could smell the bitter, pungent aroma of whatever was in the holy man’s concoction.  The world wobbled and twisted in front of him, then righted itself, and he was present again.  Solid.  The first of many, Er’Skeen had said, before tipping the cup to Steve’s lips.  Steve had thought he meant more soldiers for Fury to parade in front of the lines as chosen, and maybe the holy man had thought that, too. Blessed.  Whatever story it was Fury wanted to use him to tell.  The army, the country, everyone had needed a rallying point, and if the star shield, with its storied history was to be it, why not a ritual to bind him to it?  The people needed to believe, Steve thought, and again remembered Tony’s words.  Power is about belief. Not so very different, after all, Steve realized.
“Tell me that again tomorrow, how about?” Steve prodded, running his hand through Tony’s hair.
He wasn’t so sure Sam and Bucky had the wrong of it, though, even if it wasn’t what he had wanted to hear at the time.  They were his friends, and surely wanted the best thing for him.  He knew that.  He hadn’t been in a place to really listen, not then, not when he just wanted to forget everything and move on, but… well.  It wasn’t like it would hurt to try some of the programs like what Sam offered.  Bucky went.  Mostly because Nat practically dragged him there at first, when he was having issues with his meds and the drinking, but he said it helped.  Talking about it all.
“Sorry, Shellhead.  It was only a joke, and not a very good one at that. Didn’t mean to offend.  Besides,” Steve paused, then smiled mischievously, “you’d probably taste terrible,” Steve said with a shrug.
Bullets.  God.  Bullets.  Plural.  The plural of bullets.  He needed to see Steve.  I have my special viewer.  I need to see him, Tony thought again.  It still didn’t make sense, except it did, somewhere, in the back of his head under the rubble, it made sense.
“No,” Steve managed to husk out after a long moment.  He absently nudged Tony’s neon golf ball towards the hole with the tip of his golf club.
“He—he was fine,” Tony repeated, looking around dumbly as Thor placed Steve carefully on his side on the medical table.  There was some kind of tube coming out of Steve’s mouth connected to a bag that Bruce was slowly squeezing in and out.  “This isn’t happening.”  He didn’t realize he’d spoken aloud until he heard Natasha reply.
Two of Zola’s eunuchs stood waiting.  Steve cast a quick look over his shoulder as one gave him a small shove down the hall.  He turned around.  Faced forward.  There was a long, thin window at the end of the hall, where it sank into a winding staircase.  If he looked, he could just see the bottom of the moon, hanging low in the sky, where the tops of trees seemed to reach up to catch it.  He kept his eyes on that until he had to duck into the low tunnel that burrowed its way back to Zola’s compound.
, I don’t care who. Got it?”
He stepped to the front of Steve's door and stared at the black 4B. He'd noticed it before, of course, but like so much with Steve, he hadn't really looked. Underneath the bold, black lines, he could see tacky glue marks where the ancient apartment numbers had peeled off. He wondered if Steve had been the one to put it there. Probably. It wasn't neat or artistic or anything like that. A little messy, even, and he thought of Steve's hand clutching a marker and trying to keep it steady at the odd angle. But, there was something absurdly defiant about grabbing a sharpie and drawing on the damn door when the stickers peeled off that screamed Steve Rogers and the hill he would die on.
“There’s nothing wrong with you, Tony,” Steve replied tightly.  He pulled back and held Tony’s face between his hands for a heartbeat.  “I’m sorry anyone ever made you feel that there was.  You’re…you’re the most amazing person I’ve ever met.” He stroked the pad of his thumb over Tony’s cheek and smiled sadly.  “You’re so smart and incredibly brave.  Funny, kind, generous…I just wish you could see yourself the way I do.”
Rhodey cocked his head and listened.  Another crash, this one with a more splintering sound.  “Yeah.  Computer monitor, zero, wall, one, I’d say,” Rhodey tallied.  “We should get pizza after.”
“Am I really going to forget?” Steve asked.
Steve was looking down at him with that expression Tony was beginning to think of as something reserved for him alone, this gentle, delighted awed look that made Tony’s stomach play Twister.
He let his eyes fall closed and lay back down on the pallet, though he knew he wouldn’t sleep again.  He wasn’t going to think about it.  What was going to happen with this Lord Hammer tonight.
Steve nodded, eyes dropping to his hands, though he could feel the heat of Tony’s gaze on him. His hands shook as they pulled at the stays of his robes, eagerness and anticipation churning into a heady, pulsing sensation deep inside.  It was so easy, now, finding this feeling, like he didn’t even have to chase it anymore, it was always right there, just out of reach until Tony told him what he needed to do, and he could do that, that one thing, and make Tony happy.
Steve pushed open the door and they stepped out under the canopy of a massive, blue and green-lit shell-like dome next to valets, a line of taxis and other guests arriving at the hotel.
Steve had missed him, and there was a stack of letters in a box that screamed regret, and Tony wasn't going to be able to un-see that.
“It is of no consequence to us, I tell you,” Tony said with a quick laugh that he immediately tried to cover up at Steve’s expression.  “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t make light of it.  You have been burdened with this, and I--I do not like that this has caused you to worry.  There is no cause for it.  My feelings for you—surely you know?” he asked, tilting his head to the side.  “Would you have me say them aloud?
“The thief who you claim can squeeze through virtually any opening?” Tony replied around a yawn.  “Your team is strange, you know that, right?”
“This once, Tony.  Just…this once,” he said firmly.
“Fuck, God, Steeeeeeeeeeeeeve,” Tony cried out, hips arching into Steve’s hand.  Tony’s hands were scrabbling at the sheets, hips juddering, his eyes glazed over, and he was reaching, reaching, grabbing for Steve’s hand.  Steve gave Tony’s cock a harder stroke, squeezing lightly, then harder, circling and jerking around the sensitive head.  He caught Tony’s hand in his own, let his cock pull almost all the way out again, and then rammed in hard enough to rock Tony back against the pillows, hitting home.  Tony managed a harsh, stuttering cry, then low grunt, fingers flexing around Steve’s hand as he came in long, white stripes across his stomach.
“I was thinking about asking Peter and Sam if they would come back to New York with me,” Steve said.  “Peter thinks his aunt might still be alive. Sam’s never been, but he has a bit of the wanderlust in him, and I think maybe he’d come. He was in the Corps d’Afrique during the War. Well, first the Louisian Native Guard, which was mostly free men of color from around New Orleans.  That’s where he’s from. New Orleans. General Butler had it occupied at the time, and he put it together. Sam said they mostly dug and chopped wood. Not exactly what he wanted to be doing, so he ended up in the Corps d’Afrique when that formed out of the old Native Guard. He was in the heavy artillery unit,” Steve explained as Shellhead’s interest seemed to be suddenly piqued by whatever it was Steve was saying that fascinated him, which God only knew what that was.
I want, Steve wondered to himself.  God, that was a loaded question. His mind flashed to Tony laughing at one of Steve’s stories over dinner, his eyes bright and filled with mirth, and how it felt to talk about something real in the helicopter, something that meant something, and to have someone listen to him. Really listen. It was nice.  Not that Brock didn’t listen. Or that they didn’t talk, because they did. They had, anyway. When they were serving together.  They talked all the time, then.  Mostly about stupid stuff, maybe, but Steve had good memories of long talks while trying to keep the flies at bay and get his pack ordered or his gun free of sand. Just being together, having a unit, a
“She already out?” Steve asked, turning from the driver’s seat to look back at them.
Steve stiffened, shock and anger warring their way up his spine.
“Sounds good, Tony,” Steve replied, ducking his head a bit and looking at where Happy waited for Tony with the car.  “See you then.”  Should he kiss him?  It was probably too soon.  Better to wait.  But what if Steve was expecting him to kiss him?  He’d initiated it last time.  Steve hadn’t exactly reacted well, though, so there was that.  He didn’t want to push it, move too fast, try for more and end up with less than nothing, but if Steve did expect it and then he didn’t, well, maybe he should---
The water prickled against his skin, stinging slightly with the force and heat of it.  He leaned in, letting his forehead rest against the cool tiles, bracing his good hand against the wall beside him, letting the water wrap its warmth around him.  He still felt cold inside, couldn’t quite shake it off, despite the heat.  He adjusted the water temperature slightly, making it even hotter.  His mind was filled with smoke and explosions, a sudden, shooting pain and then soft eyes, a warm, determined grip, the slam of a door.  It all rolled around in his head, one after the other, a muddled jumble of pain and comfort and some vague idea that slipped through his fingers every time he tried to grab onto it.  He’d wanted Tony’s presence tonight, no sense in denying that.  Tony was his friend, and certainly, if he’d asked…if he’d said…well, Tony would have stayed, of course.  That’s what friends did.  And Tony would understand not wanting to be alone.  Wanting someone to be near, just to reach out and touch something real and solid and warm
Steve kept stroking Tony’s cock through his orgasm, wringing the last of it from him, then sped up his thrusts. He could feel his rhythm falter, feel the pressure build, the way his balls drew up and tightened, and then he was coming, spilling hot streams of come into Tony’s body, filling him.  He groaned, low and long, pumping deep into Tony. He thrust a few more times, chasing the feeling, then collapsed, managing to catch himself before falling entirely on top of Tony and rolling to the side instead.
A part of Steve wanted to demand to see. To know. To find
“Tony,” Steve managed to gasp out, then felt the warm rush of Tony’s cum fill him, coating his insides.  He clenched down around Tony’s cock, holding him there while they rode out the wave of sensations.
“Which ones?” Steve asked curiously. “Which networks, I mean.”
“Yes,” Steve replied.  “You don’t even know me.  I could be anyone.”
“Yes,” Tony agreed as neutrally as he could. He wouldn't know, not really. He hadn't had his own space in, let's see...oh, right, ever. But, he imagined it was nice. It must be, since everyone kept taking it away.
“I’m glad, too, Tony,” Steve said.
“Well.  I guess goodnight, then,” Tony said, hovering a bit between wanting to make a break for it and wanting Steve to ask him to stay.
“This isn’t going to just go away. No matter what I do or what Matt or JARVIS does. I wish I could make that happen, but I can’t,” Tony told him with a sad sort of wry smile.  “Trust me, I have a bit of experience with how hard it is to get rid of videos on the Internet. I know how it makes you feel to have that out there and not be able to do anything about it, to have your privacy violated like that all so some people can get their rocks off feeling superior for a minute or two.  It’s really shitty, that’s what it is. I’m sorry, Steve. You’re the last person I would want to have to deal with this.”
“Feel free to play Dory all you want,” Tony said with a shaky breath.  “The forgetting.  Fish.  The fish, it’s a—you know, just, ah, saying basically carte blanche for the kissing thing. Is all. With the fish.  Shutting up now.  But. Well, yeah.” Steve smiled in response, almost shyly, then retreated backwards, moving to the hallway.
“Well? What’d they say?” Brock demanded.
“I retired last year,” Daniel said.
“Oh yeah?  Seems like it’d be right up his alley,” Brock replied.
“Hello!  Mr. Stark! Welcome!” a man in a black polo shirt emblazoned with the Romotive Group logo on the front said as he walked towards them from where he waited at the building’s entrance.  “Carl Estes, Vice President of Development.  Wow, we are so thrilled to have you here—honored, really. I’m a huge fan, as you can imagine, being in the industry and all.  I couldn’t believe it when your assistant called.  Told my secretary someone was pulling our leg!  But, here you are!  Wow.  Tony Stark.  The Tony Stark!”
“Yes.  Master,” Steve said, then clamped his jaw together and looked somewhere over Zola’s shoulder where a statute of a knight raised his shield to ward off a dragon’s stone fire.
Then…then that damn thing with the power grid and, sure, he hadn’t exactly meant for what came after to happen, but he hadn’t exactly not meant for it to, either.  After Malibu and Killian, Extremis and what Pepper went through, then the break-up, too long and slow in coming for both of them to have the acute pain of surprise, but almost worse for not actually being all that bad….and then Barnes and SHIELD and the giant shit-ton of wrong that went down there…God, with all that filling the space around them, it had probably been fuck or fight and thankfully, they’d ended up settling on the former.
Except nothing happened.
“Stern wants the tech, true, but don’t think the Las Vegas PD or some hot-to-trot local FBI wouldn’t love to be the one to serve up Tony Stark’s head on a platter. You’ve got to be smart about this,” Matt urged. “Not your usual kind of smart, the one that goes off half-cocked and tries to catch a shark with a cane pole. Stern played you, Tony. They’ll try to get a warrant for whatever is on that drive that Batroc says he was trying to buy, at the very least.”
“HOLY FUCKING SHIT!” Tony shouted, everything slamming into him at once.  “What the—“ he gulped, running both hands through his hair and grabbing at the ends, giving them a sharp tug to make sure he was still conscious.  “What the hell did you do?  Holy shit.  Holy
The sex had been great, obviously, but...the whole night was good.
“Look at me,” Tony said softly.  Steve stopped staring at the light fixture and let his eyes drop to Tony’s.  “This is only good for me if it’s good for you, okay?  What I like--more than anything, what I like--is making sure my partner is having a good time.  Are you having a good time?”
“Oh, no, no, don’t be silly.  Night’s young.  Stay and enjoy yourself,” Charles interjected, rising from the sofa and saying his goodbyes to the rest of the group.  “Sugar, Rebecca, you two take care of Tony, would you?”
The mall wasn’t too crowded, being a weekday, but there were more people than Tony was used to seeing.  Families chased after squealing toddlers, who ran towards the jets of water spurting up from the ground in front of the fountain.  Couples strolled past store windows.  Groups of teenagers hung together in packs.
“Of course, Your Majesty. We’re leaving this instant.  Again, my most sincere apologies.  Allow me to make this up to you by sending several of my very best, most accomplished---“ Zola stammered, nearly tripping over his robe in his effort to bow and seem contrite instead of as blisteringly angry as the look he leveled at Steve indicated.  Zola was going to make him pay, which meant Zola was going to make Cam pay, and it was Steve’s fault, yet again.  He had to try.  Something.  Anything.
It was Steve who spotted the outcropping. A nice, high rock ledge that had a good windbreak and was well away from predators. Steve set the lean-to up there, while Tony got a fire going and set a few traps, hoping to catch dinner. Steve came up behind him as he finished the last one, looked down at what Tony was making and shook his head and smiled, making Tony flush warmly with pride.
“Yeah.  Yeah, I do,” Steve repeated, glancing over at the building with ill-concealed disinterest.
Steve started shaking his head…that was…that was crazy…no one in their right mind would…
“Hmmm?  Oh, yeah, right.  Like the punching bag,” Tony repeated dully.  “Well, night then,” he said, then stood there stupidly for a moment, as if Steve was going to stop him, but he didn’t, and Tony was too tired to lie to himself that it didn’t hurt.  But, he was apparently a sadist, so heard his own voice cutting into the darkness, “So, ah, tomorrow.  I thought, maybe, if you wanted, we could check out that new Thai place down on the corner.  If you want to see more art I can’t understand, there’s always the MoMA.  Or we could try the Guggenheim.  The space is incredible.  You’d probably like—“
Anto handed Steve the water bag next, then turned to go, only to have Steve reach out and grab his arm, then hastily drop his hand.  He was making more words that Anto didn’t understand, but he held up his hands in a stopping motion as he backed away, which Anto assumed meant he wanted Anto to wait.  Anto watched him duck into the cave, then pop back out a moment later, this time with Anto’s blade in one hand. He had dropped it the day before, and had just assumed he would have to make himself a new one, which he could do, but spending all that time knapping a new blade while trying not to break it or shave off his finger wasn’t exactly how he had wanted to spend his morning, so it was actually rather pleasing that Steve thought to give it back to him.
“You know, despite what some would say, I don’t actually talk just to hear the sound of my own voice,” the King remarked lightly.  “I asked you a question.  I expect to be answered.”
Steve watched him walk away, feeling suddenly drained.  He had the inescapable feeling that he had been outplayed somehow, despite the bag of chips clutched in his fist.  He zeroed in on Tony, still surrounded by other players and hangers-on at the blackjack table. Justin Hammer, Steve noticed as he approached, was sitting to Tony’s right with a few chips in front of him.  He was toying idly with one of the chips, spinning it against the top of the table while leaning over to say something to the woman standing next him that Steve couldn’t quite catch. Steve wasn’t surprised to see Hammer here tonight, but it was still an unpleasant revelation on top of another.  He sighed and sidled up next to Tony, who looked up at him with a questioning look.
Instead, Tony just continued to stare at him, face screwed into an expression that Steve couldn’t place, somewhere between confusion, fear and something that looked vaguely like hope or desperation or both.  It didn’t last long, or Steve didn’t get to see it long, because the elevator doors squeezed open and Tony spun on his heel and entered the cab of the elevator without another word.  The doors closed before Steve could formulate any kind of further response.  Staring down at his would-be dinner, Steve realized he had actually managed to lose his appetite.  Only Tony Stark could leave him that confused with mere words.
“Yeah, you’re adorable.  Can you focus? There’s a thing.  Maybe a thing. Nat thinks there’s a thing,” Bucky told them.
“Whatever it is.  It wasn’t me.  I don’t care what the…guy?  Guy, told Romanov,” Clint insisted hurriedly.
“But, I’m not tired,” Tony said.  Or possibly whined.  “I’m insecure. Remember?  Wildly insecure. Even Happy could tell.”
“Keep your hands at your sides. Now, open your mouth for me,” Tony commanded.  Steve let his mouth fall open.  “Good,” Tony praised, his voice light. Steve waited patiently for the familiar taste of Tony’s cock sliding past his lips and settling on his tongue.  Steve wasn’t expecting the sweet taste of a plump, honeyed date to fill his mouth, and almost drew back in surprise.  “Now. Chew,” Tony said around a laugh, as if he knew what Steve had been thinking. He probably did, Steve thought as he chewed.  The date was delicious. He had eaten them before, but this one was fantastic. The sweet flavor filled his mouth as he chewed the fleshy fruit.  Tony hummed thoughtfully as Steve swallowed, and a moment later, he felt the hard edge of a goblet at his lips and drank a few sips of watered wine before Tony took it away.
“You should feed him something first. Bet the little guy is hungry,” Clint pointed out.  “Thor, you headed out?”
For a second, his mind just blanked.  There was nothing there. He couldn’t process it. There was no frame of reference for it.  Like suddenly looking over and seeing the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man walking stepping on a church.  He had no context for something like this.
He wasn’t sure how he felt about seeing Steve after all this time.  What had begun as a bewildered sort of disillusionment and morphed into seething hate, as much for his own stupidity as aimed at Steve, had long ago faded into something like acceptance. Bitter acceptance, maybe, at times, anyway, but acceptance.  It was part of what shaped him, after all.  For better or worse, he thought dully, as he pulled his sunglasses off and tucked them into his breast pocket.  He wasn’t blind to what he’d become in the years since he’d left MIT.  Or even to the reasons for it.  He’d accomplished more than even dear, old Dad, and each time he looked, the line kept moving, jumping ahead of him, until he’d finally realized he was chasing something he was never going to have.
“Small boats can navigate those shoals, Marshall, and the Stone Steps are still there, however much disrepair they may be in after all this time,” General Rhodes pointed out as he, too, climbed down from his horse and handed the reins to one of the waiting slaves.  “Some of us, who shall not be called by name, used to climb down them on a dare and return with a shell to prove it.”
“Rock-paper-scissors for who gets the guilt?” Bucky suggested.
“Mine,” Tony heard himself say. “Sorry,” he said, casting a quick glance at the armor still standing guard next to the bed. He was really going to have to clean that, though he kind of liked how it looked. Steve would probably not like come-soaked Iron Man showing up in the papers though. Tony would like to put spray ‘My Omega Steve Did This’ in glow paint on it, but that would also probably be frowned upon. “I just---really like saying that.”
No. No, he wasn’t going to think about it. Everything was fine. Every
The road was empty.
He’ll tell me I’m beautiful, some other part of himself whispered.  In that dark, honeyed voice of his, with his eyes burning soft.  He’ll call me his and look wondrously upon me, as if he is surprised by it all.
“You looked like him, you said your name was Steve…sure, I thought that was just some part of the whole fantasy thing at first, but then,” Tony’s mouth flattened.  “You wanted the plans. I’d barely looked at them, but I knew what they were. What he was going for, I mean. Time travel. A wormhole of some kind, but the math was way, way wrong.  Of course, I didn’t know at the time that he was using the Tesseract for the basis of his calculations.”
“Yes, my King?” Cam replied quickly, spinning around like a top.
Steve just shook his head slowly back and forth, but otherwise said nothing and made no move to enter the room further.  He did walk over to the bookcase and trace a finger along the spines of the various volumes there, histories and biographies mostly, Tony noticed, though now that he actually looked carefully, there were a number of art books, no surprise, and a somewhat battered Introduction to Electrodynamics textbook with part of the spine missing showing the tan board beneath.  The thing looks old enough to have been used by Edison, Tony thought, rather surprised to see something like that in Steve’s room.  Tony stared at it curiously, almost reaching out to pull it off the shelf before catching himself.
“Well, why would you think you couldn’t do it, then?” Steve asked.
When he finally left the garage, the moon was hanging over the mountains with a Cheshire-cat grin.  It was bright enough that he could see tufts of clouds moving past it, casting night shadows.
talk to him about that?” Natasha asked.  “He builds weaponized metal suits three floors below you.”
“I’m calling this the I-Don’t-Want-To-See-You-In-Another-Man’s-Shirt-Shirt,” Clint said, holding up a dark blue button-down.
“Mine,” Steve ground out through gritted teeth.  “Mine, Tony.”  He traced a finger under the garter where it followed the line of Tony’s thigh, then higher, over the arch of the belt where it curved over the top of the panties encasing Tony’s cock and back down the other garter, like the bastard was in no hurry while Tony was
By the time they made it outside, Happy had the car waiting with the door open for them, and Steve ducked into the backseat after Tony.
“I was supposed to shelter them, and I failed them,” Tony choked out. “I failed them.”  Steve sank to his knees by Tony in the damp earth, letting his hand drop from Tony’s shoulder.  Before him, the ground curved down in a shallow cradle of dirt.  The soldiers had not bothered to bury them very deeply, seeing no need to hide their crime, not out here where no one was likely to risk visiting.  He could see the whites of what he knew were not rocks poking out of the dirt, as if determined to be seen, though he could not bring himself to look closely.  Bone does not burn so well, he thought, but was oddly glad for it, that something remained of them.
, for him.  He shouldn’t revel in it.  He shouldn’t.  But, he did. Just a little.  That this man would tear the world apart for him.
Another blow, and then another, the strikes coming faster.  The silence was punctuated only by the clap of the strap meeting his skin and his count.  Eight, nine, he thought he sobbed out ten as Tony laid them atop each other, right across his hole, sending the metal cock thrusting hard, pinging that spot deep inside him.  Pain and pleasure threatened to overwhelm him.  His cock throbbed, all but forgotten, and his ass ached with indescribable agony, but it was good, too, all of it, like everything with Tony, this mix of everything Steve wanted and horror at wanting it.
“Uh, I believe it’s pronounced ‘
“Here, let me see,” Tony said, holding out a hand.  Steve put the recorder in it, and Tony turned it over in his hand, studying it, then banged it against the edge of the desktop.  “Yep.  Broken.”
“That was a nice story,” Steve said softly.
too needy.
“Just, you know. Curious,” Tony replied with a quick look at Bruce, who was frowning down at the clipboard he was holding. Ah, fuck it, just ask, Tony admonished himself bitterly. He reached out to run a hand over the row of test tubes, making them clink together in the silent lab. “Did, ah. Was there anything in—in Erkisne’s notes on Rebirth about it? How the ah, how the serum might, you know. Affect…things.”
It was on the cusp of Tony’s lips to offer, when, miraculously, Steve tried the door and it…just opened.  Huh.  Maybe he had left it unlocked, Tony thought with a mental shrug.  Steve got them inside and kicked the door closed behind him, then wound his way through the darkened apartment to Tony’s bedroom by memory.  DUM-E whined softly from the corner.
He wrapped his arms around himself and rubbed up and down.  It wasn’t all that cold here, but he felt cold, like the warmth was seeping out through the pores of his skin.  His eyes caught on the toe of his shoe.  There was a drop of dark oil there. Motor oil, his mind supplied.  One shoelace was half undone.  It was honestly that lace dangling in the dust and gravel by the side of the road next to his guilt-gift of a car that came the closest to making him want to assume the crash position and simply check the fuck out.  It wasn’t tempting, so much as the only option for that fraction of a second.  There was ‘pull chord’ or he was going to face plant in the dirt at Steve’s feet, and no other choice seemed to exist.  Then the moment was gone, and it was just a lace, and he was just an idiot again.
“Jus Primae Noctis,” Tony said, though Steve didn’t really register the words at first.
“Okay, well, good.  I’ll just—I’ll see you for dinner, then?” Steve asked.
“Alright, sit tight for a sec,” Tony Told him.  He pulled out a golden bottle that promised no more tears.  Yeah, promises, promises, he thought, then turned to Steve.  Or where he’d put Steve, anyway, which was now an empty space definitely not filled with Steve.  Tony swung around in time to see a foot disappearing out the bathroom door.
“I want to see you,” Steve repeated more firmly, setting his jaw, and Tony knew that part of the discussion was over.
Stark Expo, 1974.
It was easier to focus without looking at Steve, though he could feel Steve watching him.  Steve’s gaze felt heavy, as if it had weight, like one of those lead vests they put on your chest when you get your teeth x-rayed.  He couldn’t not give an answer.  For a lot of reasons, not the least of which was that his Alpha was asking, but also a little bit because there was a drawing in his room that said it could be just a question and not a test.
“Aww, did your daddy not love you enough as a child, Barnes?  Do you need a hug?” Phillips demanded. “Move it.”
“Clearly,” Steve agreed.  “Ms. Potts is okay with it though?” Steve asked as the elevator doors whooshed open revealing the hallway that led to Steve and Clint’s suites.
“Huh.  Well, let’s see what the good doctor has to say,” Tony muttered, opening the attachment.  Thermonuclear astrophysics?  Bit hefty for late night reading, but at least somewhat interesting, he mused.  He managed to make it as far as quantum tunneling effect before switching off the tablet, blinking at the sudden darkness.  He reached up and jerked off his bowtie, undoing the buttons of his dress shirt and untucking it from his waist before pushing himself up and shrugging it off, letting it fall to the floor.  He toed off his shoes, then kicked off his pants, padding to the bed in his boxers and socks.
I’ll start leaving him tomorrow, Steve thought with a jolt that felt like being dunked in ice water.  He wasn’t ready for the next blow, which hit low, finding the place where his ass and thighs joined, so hard it made him jerk forward with the force of it.
“Hey, Boss,” Happy said.  “How’d the bus ride go?” he asked when he climbed back behind the driver’s wheel.
.  And I went.  And now, here we are.  If this—if not getting some possible thing with a guy I like—if that’s what I get, then that’s what I get, okay?  Maybe that’s—penance or balance or, I don’t know, the universe getting her Karma on, whatever.  Fair’s fair.  It’s--he’s one guy.  I mean, a great guy, sure, but it’s not the end of the world. It’s fine. I’m good.  Really.  Look, I do have to get ready, though, so…we good here?”
“Tony, that’s not the same, and you know it.  I don’t want everything to be a fight with you, I
“Um, okay,” Tony replied a bit jittery.  Steve paused a bit because something about Tony seemed off, though it was probably Steve’s own guilt over the fact that not fifteen minutes ago he’d been thinking about Tony while he…well.  Steve tried for serious, because he did really want to talk to Tony about the poster.  It was only fair since Steve had basically changed the whole marketing scheme regarding Iron Man without even consulting Tony, who had apparently had no problem with it.
“It isn’t—it’s not just about that, Tony,” Steve replied, though the words were stiff and halting, because Steve was a terrible liar.
“I thought we were out of money,” Steve reminded him.
“You just what?” Brock asked.  “That’s what I thought,” he said when Steve didn’t say anything. “Jack’s helped you a lot, back when you got yourself fired ‘cause you couldn’t keep track of what day of the fucking week it was.  I think the least we can do is do him a solid while we celebrate.”
“Do you need the records?” Steve asked gruffly, shooting Tony an annoyed—no, scratch that, pissed--look. “Or, do you want to just repeat it some more? I know the concept of paying things off over time is probably a bit new for you, so take all the time you need. Please. I'm really starting to enjoy our little conversations.”
The figure in the mirror shifted, making a rushing swoosh of a sound as stockinged thighs rubbed together.  Okay, so, yeah, Tony thought with a sigh, this whole idea was probably crazy, but he was usually in jeans and whatever morally objectionable t-shirt he had handy, and he wanted…he wanted to be beautiful.  For Steve.  Be the kind of Omega that Steve had thought about all those years ago.  Had Steve sat in a bunker canopied by barbed wire with the whine of mortar fire overhead and thought about one of those Omegas?  About
“Just go.  Enjoy.  Whatever,” Tony interjected with a wave of his hand.  Steve recognized a dismissal when he heard one.
Steve pushed open one of the front doors and held it for Tony to enter.  The small, dim entryway was lined with a bank of mailboxes for each apartment and a corkboard message area with a singular flyer posted offering a sure-fire way to earn money from home with two of the small, paper stubs torn off.  “Watch your step,” Steve warned, nodding at a patch of floor where the tile was in partial chunks.  He shifted the paper bag in his hands again, and started up the steps, one hand on the worn, wooden railing as he went.  Neither of them spoke as Tony followed Steve’s heavy steps up the stairs to the fourth floor, but silence was laden with a heavy expectation that they were going to have to speak.   After all these years.
At the restaurant they’d gone to on their date.  Steve said the map was wrong.  Tony remembered it looking like a boot with a leaning tower marking Pisa and poorly-drawn David with an unfortunately small fig leaf standing sentinel over Florence, but other than that, nothing stood out as being wrong about it.
“Okay,” Tony breathed out in a long, wavering huff.  “How do we do this?”
“Yes, Tony,” Steve replied, his voice slurry and rough from the rawness of his throat. More hands. More words.  Good words, Steve thought, which meant he was good, and he liked that.  Being good.  He was supposed to be good all the time, but he couldn’t, and sometimes, sometimes he was too slow, and sometimes, he thought he might be terrible.  Being good for Tony, though, that was so, so much easier.  So easy to just let go and be good for him.
“What you do…with SHIELD.  It’s dangerous, right?” Tony heard himself ask.
And Ross?  Tony knew him more by reputation than anything, but Obie had glad-handed the General enough that Tony could believe there had to be something there.  He would just…ignore JARVIS’ question about why now, with everything else going on, Tony had a sudden interest in ferreting out political corruption involving very specific individuals.
“Hello,” Steve managed to get out, though his voice sounded barely recognizable, like it hadn’t been in use for a very long time.  He started forward, holding out his hands to—what? He wasn’t sure, but he forced them to his sides and caught himself, drawing to a halt.  “Ah.  Thank you.  For coming today, I mean.  All the way here.  I know that was a trip.  For you and your family. I really appreciate that,” Steve stammered, then forced himself to stop speaking and take a breath.  He drew in a gulp of air, and it warmed his chest, much to his surprise. I’ll say his name, Steve thought. I’ll say his name, and this will all be real. He could feel the flush grow across his skin at the thought.  You are mine, and I am yours, and that’s how we’ll know.  “Ah…may I call you Anthony?”
Astronaut Tony meets Alien Steve.
“I was trying to help!” Clint argued.
Steve didn’t know how long they stayed that way, wrapped in each other, hovering between sleep and wakefulness. Floating, Steve thought, though the familiar unsettled feeling that usually accompanied the path to sleep did not surface this night. Tony, Steve thought, breathing deeply into the warmth of Tony’s skin. Tony is here, and he won’t let me go. He can’t. Life and death, a beginning that is an inevitable end and an end that cannot exist without a beginning. The same thread, viewed from different sides.
He also remembered watching his father drink himself into a stupor when Challenger blew. Though, to be fair, by that point, Howard hadn’t needed much of an excuse for that.
He waited. Paced for a bit, then sat down with a slight wince. It seemed to take a long time, but when he saw the time counting by on his phone, it was really only about ten minutes before the woman’s voice came back onto the line.
“Let me,” Tony said again.  He reached out and wound his fists into Steve’s tunic, twisting the fine fabric into his hands.  “Don’t send me away.”
“You should take her some,” Steve suggested.
“I’m sure, and no, thanks hon, I’m fine,” Steve said, clearly trying not to smile, so Tony assumed he was pleased with the dinner plans.
“Can’t think of a better reason.  Well, technically, the starving children, but you get my point,” Tony said with a nod.
Steve stared. Sucked in a breath.  Tony’s eyes were dark, intense, and suddenly, the water seemed too warm and the space too cramped, but gooseflesh rose on his arms and neck.  He felt a bit like he was standing on the Skywalk again, dizzy, lightheaded, his perspective thrown off by the way the sky and the ground seemed like one infinite circle. What were they talking about?
, at least.
“I’ll just stand,” Tony replied quickly, moving behind Steve, pressing just close enough to let some of Steve’s warmth leech into him. “You never answered my question,” Tony pointed out, voice soft and thick. He felt his breath quicken, heart pounding in his chest as he waited for Steve to say something. Anything. Really, anything at all. Let’s talk about the urine-covered bench again, Tony thought wildly.
“No,” Tony replied dully, momentarily thrown off-kilter. He couldn’t quite explain the sensation, except that everything about this felt off somehow, like he was slowly sliding down some hill and couldn’t quite see the bottom.
you,” Tony said.
The problem was, Steve realized when he got outside the building, he didn’t really have anywhere to go.   He was halfway down the block, walking aimlessly, thinking maybe he could find an all-night diner, when he realized that wasn’t true.  Of course he had somewhere to go.
“Would that this were true, General Ross. It would certainly make my job far easier,” Rhodes replied.
“I did, Colonel Rhodes,” JARVIS announced.  “He assured me that he is on his way, and asked that I remind Sir not to say anything at all whatsoever to the police or to any other emergency personnel who may respond, though he seemed to regard this as an unlikely outcome.”
“Good!  Good, that’s good to hear,” she cooed, then paused, and Tony could almost hear her clicking her perfectly manicured nails on the top of her desk.  The gilded, gold-leafed monstrosity she’d bought because someone told her it was classical and she confused that with classy.  “Everything’s alright, then?  With you and Captain Rogers?”
“This is Pepper Potts, Mr. Stark’s personal assistant,” she told him.  The name, unusual as it was, sounded vaguely familiar to Steve. He figured he probably picked it up by osmosis, the way he seemed to pick up most pop culture, then remembered Stark saying something to him last night about Pepper and art she made him buy.  When he was complimenting Steve’s artwork, that was apparently still up on the school’s website, which had been really nice--if slightly unnerving--of him.
“Well, that’s the question that keeps me up at night, Steve,” she said evenly.  “And don’t even get me started on what happened with Hammer.”
“Technically, when I was done, you couldn’t hear the noise anymore,” Tony reminded him.
“Ready?” Tony asked, as Steve lingered in the hall.  “We can stay longer, if you want.”
“My mother used to tell me that her people used to worship the Great Spider, back before the faith came for her people’s lands.  Our world sat in her web, they said. She would weave certain souls together,” Steve said. “I always liked that story,” he added, pausing for a moment, then wrapped his hands around Tony’s where they gripped his and cleared his throat. “I love you, Tony. More than...more than I ever thought possible, too.  I will…” he began, swallowing thickly and looking down at Tony. He started again, his voice strong and sure this time. “I will love you with all of my being, forsaking all others. My hearth shall be your hearth. My table shall be your table. The children of your name shall be the children of my name. I bind myself to you, in this life and the next. So, as I say, it is done,” Steve finished, watching Tony visibly relax, his eyes growing bright and watery.
“I’d say real swell about covers it,” Tony muttered under his breath.  “I’m just going to look around a bit.  Maybe pick up a couple of things.”  He didn’t need anything, but he was supposed to want stuff, and Steve seemed intent on Tony leaving with something other than a hard-on.
How had he forgotten how good it was just to talk to Bucky about nothing?  Had it really been two months, like Bucky said, Steve wondered, thinking back.  He supposed so.  That might be the longest stretch he had gone without talking to Bucky since the first day of kindergarten when Michael Donaghue broke Steve’s pencil, and Bucky threw little Mikey’s lunch on the ground.  Good times.
“About a mile a minute,” Daniel said, his voice slightly muffled by the wind.  “Seems to be really looking forward to school, I think.  Worried the kids won’t like him, but that’s normal.  I told him if they were mean to him, I’d come kick all these asses.  Shake my cane at them.  Think he got a bit of a laugh out of that.”
“I’m sorry, Sir, getting you a clue is outside the scope of even my programming,” JARVIS responded primly, the snarky bastard.
One shield, an annoyed glare from Steve while he held it and they all watched to see what would happen and a modified ‘shrink ray’ later, Tony was studying Steve where he sat on the table in medical at the Tower in his undershirt, which swallowed him, and briefs, which, God bless America, didn’t.
It took a moment for Steve’s vision to focus again.  His whole body was tingling with energy, and yet exhausted.  Loose.  Languid.  When he looked down, he realized he still had his hand wound tightly in Tony’s hair, and Tony still held Steve’s cockhead in the warm of his mouth, tongue swirling lazily around the tip.   Reluctantly, Steve drew his hand back.  Finally, with a quick, pleased look up at Steve, Tony pulled off with an obscene, wet sound, wiping away the long strand of saliva that clung to the rounded tip of the condom and his chin.
The stranger came. Steve could feel it happening around him. The clench of the man’s inner walls, the sudden shudders, the sharp, tight movements, then the transformation to a languid bonelessness. The man’s stuttering cries quickly became muffled moans from behind the wall. But it still, it just—it wasn’t right, it wasn’t—
Tony sipped his water while Steve paid the check, and glanced around the dining room again.  There were several pairs of Alphas and their Omegas scattered among the mostly Beta crowd.  One couple had two young children with them, and the Omega was picking noodles out of the toddler’s lap while the older child colored with an intense concentration Tony reserved for propylene torches and separating the marshmallows out of the Lucky Charms cereal.
“I didn’t mean…sorry.  Sorry, it’s just, he’s…it’s one thing after the other with him, you know? Got into a fight, and they wanted to suspend him.  Me come get him or pay to get him home, can you believe it?  In the middle of the damned Vegas trade show, which he knows—he
“Thats not a, “Fuck off, weirdo,”’ Tony pointed out, showing the response to Rhodey.
But, I will not be here for that, Steve reminded himself.  I should be paying attention to the comings and goings from the city, not pondering how to improve Tony’s defenses, Steve thought with a sigh, though his mind spiraled on.  The heat, he told himself, as he thought about the positioning of ready forces and longbowmen in the hills and steppes, back where the biggest menace seemed to be very determined goats.  Voices and the sound of hooves on hard sand sounded, and Steve turned to watch Tony and the others approach.
“Laugh all you want.  If you take this asshole back, I’m calling Phillips.  Don’t think I won’t,” Bucky warned.  “He’ll chew you a new one from that backwater swamp hellhole he retired to.”
A shiver racked his body, sending sparks of heat from low in his belly down to the tip of his cock.  He ran a hand through his hair and rolled his tongue over his bottom lip, taking it between his teeth.  He swallowed thickly and felt his chest tighten.  He was strangely conscious of each breath, in and out, each beat of his heart pulsing against his ribcage.  Every sound was exaggerated, pounding in his head.  The cool air from the fan hitting his skin made gooseflesh rise.  He ran his hand over the soft sheet, then higher, over his chest, tracing the row of buttons up his shirt to the collar.
“I should’ve told you.  They told me not to.  Not to tell anyone.  And I listened.  I don’t know why, except…” Steve trailed off, gaze flicking to the spot where the shield leaned against the wall before coming back to rest on Tony.  “I wanted something that wasn’t
“What’s fine?” Steve questioned, still frowning, eyes drifting back and forth between Tony’s face and where the dog tags hung.  Probably still loopy from whatever they’d been trying to dose him with, Tony figured.  “Tony?  What’s fine?”
“Yeah, okay, the name needs a little work, but you get where I’m going with this,” Tony said quickly, waving his hand in the air.  “We could do something really good here. Well, not us, but people. People we hire to do the actual work while we spend very important time doing what I
Steve glanced at Peran over Cam’s head and caught the gruff, older man trying to hide a smile.
“I know.  I don’t
“He brought me here, you know,” Tony said, staring at the heavy canopy that covered the bed.  “After my parents were killed.”  He paused, blinking up at the dark blue fabric that made him think of a river as it folded into the curtains around the bed.  A river that flowed away.  He shivered, though the room was warm, thanks to the fire in the hearth. He had thought that once, he remembered, or thought he remembered. “I thought he was going to comfort me,” Tony huffed out, mouth filling with the tang of long-held bitterness.  “I was so stupid.” He swiped an angry hand across his eyes and blinked, twisting his head away to look at Steve, who peered at him over his sword, a deep furrow marring his brow.
“Good,” Steve spat back, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Thank you.  Now, rest,” Tony said, standing up with a huffing groan.  “You,” he called out to Cam, who looked up, mid-chew. “See that he is ready for our outing this afternoon. I should be returned from the hunt sometime after luncheon.”
No one else would ever see Steve like this.  No one else would ever feel what it was like to have Steve be a part of them, the way Tony got to.  For this time, they were one being, and every barrier between them had to fall away.  Tony was pain and violence and fear and longing, and Steve was light and love and warmth, and he thought it was the same for Steve, only reversed.  That was what this brought them, this nearly unbearable closeness, where they couldn’t hide, not from each other.
be my Omega,” Rogers said, blue eyes dark and soft with something like sadness.  “Looks like we’re compatible, after all.”
He let the last note fall, then opened his eyes.  Shellhead was watching him, though Steve couldn’t make out his expression very well.  He hummed, a throaty, clicking sound that Steve had come to understand meant something akin to contentment.
“Thanks, Pep,” Tony said. “See you soon, okay?”
“No, no, I’m happy.  My name.  Happy Hogan, that’s me. Actually, it's Harold, but no one ‘cept my Ma calls me that. I’m Mr. Stark’s driver and bodyguard. Used to box, you know, back in the day. You’ve probably heard of me,” the driver--Happy, Steve corrected--informed him proudly.
Tony made a beeline for the coffee machine, and Steve watched the rather comical way his whole body deflated at the sight of the empty pot.  He couldn’t help but laugh a bit at Tony’s dramatic disappointment.
“You can really do all those things Tony said, huh?” Bruce asked, then whistled when Steve nodded once, jerkily, the gold discs dangling from his veil clinking as he did.  “Hell of a thing, that. If there was something like that, some kind of concoction...think of what it could do. That could...that could change the world. People would kill for something....”  he trailed off, gaze darting from Steve to Tony.
“Steve,” Tony repeated, this time more forcefully. Steve dragged his eyes to Tony’s again, then Tony felt Steve’s whole body shudder once underneath him, almost as if it took that much effort to keep his eyes focused on Tony’s.
. He could be home, but here he was, waiting for scouts to return and tell him nothing moved in the mountains save the small desert mice who burrowed in the rocks and the strange lizards who flared their throats in warning at the soldiers as they passed.
the way a gargoyle waits over a church’s door, on guard for sinners. The way a hungry wolf waits for a lamb to stray too far from the herd. There was waiting, and then there was
“You always shone, Tony,” Steve whispered, then leaned up and kissed him again.
“He has a lot of books,” Cam observed, nodding at the desk.  He didn’t touch them, just tilted his head and looked at the spines.
“That’s…okay, well, you’re not wrong.  Obviously.  So, what now, Cap?” Tony asked.  What am I supposed to do with you, he repeated to himself.  Tell me what I’m supposed to do, how we’re going to deal with this, or how we’re going to ignore it, but please, God, tell me something because I’m going crazy, and it’s all messed up in my head, because you needed me and you liked me, and it was all right there and then it wasn’t, and I want you to be you, of course I do, but it was simple, so damn simple, and I’m afraid it might be too simple to let it happen now.  Maybe it already has.
want to make it better for everyone there. I know you do, too. I know things are...fraught...right now, with Stane and, well, I don’t know everything happening in the world, but, I know you’re right about the threat the Free States pose.  I haven’t...” he stopped, drawing in a breath. “I haven’t wanted to think about that, I guess.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve left him.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, I didn’t pick the names, Howard,” Peggy replied affectionately, holding up a placating hand. A small smile played on her lips, and she cast a quick look at the camera.  Or at the man behind the camera, more likely, but it hit Steve between the eyes, the way it always did with her, like getting to peak behind a curtain and finding the Great and Powerful was even more amazing.
Whatever the reason, it hurt to hear those words fall from Tony’s lips.  He wasn’t even sure who the pain was for, himself, at what he was seeking by coming here tonight instead of making a break for the wall or hurtling himself off some nearby tower, or Tony, for being willing to get so little in return for all that he was willing to give.
He didn’t know how to say all of that, and he’d already messed up, trying to kiss Steve, so he just stood there, watching the agents build and test and tweak and—okay, Thing Two was not seriously going to use nitrogen pressurization in the landing gear when they could just put in an upgraded shock absorber, was he?  God, they were Philistines.
“You do,” Steve agreed with a smile.  It wasn’t quite there yet, but he could see it now.  How it would look when he finished.  “Glad you like it.”
“He thinks I won’t go if he doesn’t,” Barnes said.
“Maria, you look lovely as ever,” Stane observed, handing her a wrapped box.
“Yes, I know.  I see it,” Tony said when Steve kept pointing and then looking up at him.  Tony waved, watching his reflection do the same.  Steve chortled with utter delight at that, so Tony did it again, and then tried to stop, but Steve started flapping his arm up and down in an attempt at a wave, so Tony felt obligated to keep doing it.  Over and over.  And over.  Apparently, this didn’t get old when you were one-ish.
“Room Six doesn’t have a time limit,” the man told him, mouth pursing a bit. “By request,” he added, looking up at Steve. “Enjoy,” the man added perfunctorily.
“I’m not asking you to be the same person you were when you were nineteen, Steve,” Tony assured him in a soft voice.  “God knows, I’m not the same person I was then.  We should’ve done this whole figuring life out thing together, I know, but we’re here now.  We’re where we are.  I’m not—I’m not talking about ‘fixing you.’  I’m not.  Well, okay, maybe a little.  Your hand and back.  That kind of thing,” Tony said, wobbling his head back and forth in admission.  “I’m talking about you and me.  Us.  One day at a time.  The good days and the tough ones.  I know there will be tough ones, Steve.  I know that.  But, come on, you really think we don’t have a better shot at this if we’re together?  ‘Course, you don’t.  You’re annoyingly stubborn and noble, but you’re not stupid.  So…so, we try this.  Deal?”
“Kiss me,” Tony ordered, so Steve obliged, long and slow and sweet.  He pulled back long enough to watch Tony’s face as he breached him with a third finger.  Tony just sighed into it, eyes blinking closed, a small gasp escaping him. Tony hummed again, a pleased, happy sound that made Steve’s cock jump in response, like it was on some kind of tether to those wonderful little sounds Tony was making.  “I’m good, I’m good,” Tony sighed, all shaky and breathy, like each word was effort. I did that to him, Steve thought with a burst of amazement. “Please. Need you. Need you now, Steve.”
He finished the rest of his workout uninterrupted, then went back up to the suite, showered and changed before making his way out to the  kitchen in search of food.  Instead, he found Tony with a phone headset of some kind sitting at the dining table sipping a dark green smoothie that looked like the picture in the dictionary next to the word ‘revolting.’
When he finished, he snapped the notebook shut and tossed it aside, then leaned across the bed and unzipped the duffel.  Steve half expected something to pop out of him, snake-in-a-can-style, but it was just clothes and a pair of running shoes.  He had to rifle through the contents a bit before finding his shaving kit near the bottom.  There was a stick of deodorant and his toothbrush with a tissue wrapped around the bristles, along with the scrunched up tube of toothpaste, shoved into a sock next to it.  This had the feel of Bucky helping with packing, Steve thought, the corners of his mouth tugging up in amusement.  Bucky would have helped, no doubt, if for no other reason than to get Natasha out of the apartment that much faster.  A few shirts, two pairs of khakis, some jeans, boxers and his gym clothes were all that remained, except for Nat’s silent judgment about his wardrobe, or the lack thereof.
That made no sense to Steve, so he just frowned and slowly shook his head.  “I told you.  Last night, what I said…” he began, then faltered, the rejection still singing.
Honestly, this was probably what Bucky meant when he said Steve had no idea how to talk to people.  He just…Tony walked out, looking amazing, and Steve’s mind went blank, which in no way stopped his mouth from working, apparently.  He’d already spent nearly twenty minutes trying to de-slushie his mouth, because it was that or spend an evening with Tony Stark while looking like he’d been snacking on a bunch of Smurfs.  And now he was staring at Tony Stark the way he used to press his face to the glass at Williams Candy, with its rows of blue and pink cotton candy dangling in the window over trays of candy apples they dipped right there in the store.
“Don’t give me that look. Pepper’s on her way up, too, so grab a pillow, there you go,” Rhodes nodded as Tony complied.  “Subtle.”
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said, raising a gauntleted hand in greeting.
“Hey, buddy, no throwing, okay?  We talked about this,” Clint shouted across the room.  “Admittedly, so far it is a strong no on Hulk handling any baby duties,” Clint nodded agreeably.
After what seemed like long, lazy minutes of Tony’s mouth and hands slowly taking him apart one nerve ending at a time, Steve felt Tony reach out somewhat blindly and open a drawer in the nightstand.  A few scattered sounds followed, and then he heard the familiar sound of a condom wrapper being torn open.
“Look through your special viewer, Tony.  Try,” Jarvis urged softly.  “Let yourself see things a bit more clearly.”
“No.  No, Pep, I shouldn’t have put this on you to begin with.  I wanted to avoid---well, a lot.  Surprise, surprise, I know.  I thought this would be easier.  Us not having to see each other again.  Thought  maybe he—fuck, I don’t know, felt bad or something.  Wishful thinking, clearly.  I wasn’t going to be a petty bastard about this. Bygones and all.  But, hell, if Steve wants to play hardball, fine.  I’ll handle it,” Tony said.  “He’ll sign or he can deal with every lawyer in New York breathing down his neck.”
“The check?” Brock chuckled lowly.  “God, you’re cute when you’re all sleepy.  Wake up, bank opens in ten.”
“I can take it,” Steve said with a lopsided smile.
“Yes.  We were having a--” Steve stopped, shaking his head at the memory, bright and burning in his mind all of a sudden.  “A snowball fight. It was the middle of the war, and we were pinned in by Schmidt’s forces, and we just...I don’t even remember how it got started, but...it was stupid.  Stupid and crazy and...a good day. He was looking at Natasha, and I just remember thinking…”
“Can we please not have this discussion again?” Clint pleaded.  “I cannot fucking take it if you start in on their flaky outer crust.”
“T--T--Tony,” Steve gasped.  “Please. Oh-oh-oh! Please, Tony,
“Okay, so, that—that was not how I wanted to start this conversation,” Tony said around a sigh.  “Fuck.” He dipped his head into his hand and rubbed at his temples as the elevator took them to their suite.  Finally dropping his hand, he glanced over at Steve. His jaw was clenched so tightly it made Tony’s ache in sympathy, and he was studiously looking towards what must have been a very fascinating part of the floor.  “Steve? Can you…can you look at me for a second? I know, that was sort of just sprung on you out of nowhere, and God knows, that wasn’t how I wanted this to go, but I can explain. Or, well, I don’t know if explain is right, or—can you please just look at me?  I’m sorry, okay? That—that shouldn’t have happened like that. I’m sorry. I know how all of this looks. Believe me, I know how it looks. But--”
“And this is why we don’t play twenty questions,” Steve said sourly.  “Last time, you picked quark.  How is anyone supposed to guess that?”
“Dude, I will have sex with you right here on the table if you’ll shut up about the fucking pillows,” Barton offered.
“I think,” she began, then slowed her steps, tilted her head and looked up at him. The music and car noise was loud, covering their conversation, not that anyone was paying attention, Steve noticed. “Look at what’s happening in the world.  Things are changing faster than I think any of us, except maybe Howard, ever anticipated. The world needs someone like you, Steve. Someone to believe in again. We haven’t had that in so long.
“Well, this was…unexpected. Definitely.  But, fun,” Tony announced, gaze darting around the room for a bit before finally settling on Steve for a quick moment.  “You ever need a cheap model comfortable with casual nudity, let me know.  For a good time call, and all that.”
“We’ll go together this time.  Pick out one you like,” Steve promised, as if he hadn’t just somehow chucked a quarter million dollars and about a ton and a half over the side of a mountain.  Tony stared at him, mouth working open and closed.
“He is,” Tony replied.
Steve nodded and threw a leg over one side of Tony’s stomach, straddling him.  He could feel the hard, round head of Tony’s cock against the seam of his ass, leaving a damp path as it sought entry.  Steve reached a hand behind him and wrapped it around Tony’s cock, lifting himself up on his knees and slowly guiding the head to his entrance.  He sank down, just a bit, eyes going wide as he felt his hole stretching to accommodate Tony’s cock.
“Good morning, Steve.  I’m glad you’re up.  I was hoping I wouldn’t wake you,” Ms. Potts said with a sort of bracing professionalism that caught Steve off guard.
“It turned out ‘Something Like Mylie’ wasn’t it,” Steve interjected with a lopsided smile aimed at Bucky, though he saw Tony’s gaze trip over to him before darting back to Bucky.
“Relax, Tony.  Let me take care of you,” Steve urged, voice soft and throaty as he let go of Tony’s neck.
, the children would sing-song before falling into peals of laughter.  Steve shivered, his eyes going to the mountains, where nothing moved tonight except the clouds.
“Try to lie down so I can strap you in. We’ll be wheels up as soon as they’re onboard,” Natasha urged, finishing up where she was poking his wound with a hot stick of salt or whatever the fuck she was doing that burned like hell.
That was the thing.  Everyone had someone.  Maybe you didn’t find that person, but they were out there.  No matter who you were or what you did, there was someone who would love you.   Sure, it didn’t mean eternal bliss, even if you found that person.  Real life wasn’t a fucking storybook.  But it meant—well.  It meant you were someone who could be loved.  You had that.  And as it turned out, just knowing that meant something to people.  Maybe you wouldn’t be happy.  There were no guarantees.  But, everyone had the chance, and that mattered a whole fucking lot to people.  Hell, murderers had soulmarks.  Hilter, Stalin…Trump.  They all had marks.
There was exactly one number in the phone.  It matched the number of the phone he had sent Tony all those months ago.  The phone was brand new.  No calls had ever been made or received.  It had no text messages.  T’Challa had arranged it and loaded it with a preset number of minutes.
“I’ll drive,” Rhodey told him, nodding for Tony to toss him the keys.
Steve limped out carefully, each step sending a cascade of want stabbing through his aching cock.  He rubbed his palm over it and pressed down at the base, to no avail.  One of the guards opened the door for him and he stepped out into the hallway, where two of Zola’s flower-crested guards waited to escort him back.  He swallowed his embarrassment and tried to concentrate on walking without causing more of an issue.  The guards didn’t seem concerned with Steve’s condition and nudged his shoulder to hurry him along.  Back at Zola’s compound, they led him to his room and one of them lifted the long metal lockbar from the door, while the other gave Steve a hard shove inside.
The strange thing was, he didn't think Steve was lying. Not exactly, anyway. Everyone had a breaking point, though, and Tony knew from past experience that he tended to find those boundaries with the enthusiasm of a niffler at Tiffany's.
They would have probably gone mad.
Finally, Steve looked up and caught Tony’s gaze.  Tony was still standing in the same spot next to Ms. Potts with her box of watches, except that he was looking at Steve now, one hand held out in midair with a watch dangling from it, eyes wide and tracking up and down Steve, his mouth slightly parted, as if he was on the verge of saying something.  He looked like someone had pushed pause on a video and the picture slanted a bit before it stopped, perfectly still, but slightly off-kilter. Steve wasn’t sure what to think, though Bucky’s words echoed in his head, and he felt himself relax, some of the stiffness ebbing out of him as Tony’s gaze, warm and most definitely appreciative, trailed over him.  Tony didn’t seem to think he looked ridiculous, which was—it was nice. Embarrassing, in its own way, but a good kind of embarrassing, though that didn’t make sense. It made him want to tug at his collar, as if it had suddenly gotten too tight, and his insides churned with a fluid warmth that settled low in his belly, heating his skin. He could feel a flush creeping up his neck.  I’m getting blotchy, he thought with a careening sort of dazed humor that finally knocked a smile out of him. Tony just stared. Ms. Potts nudged him, and he rocked on his heels a bit with the motion, but didn’t break eye contact with Steve.
“I’m sorry you went through that,” Steve said after a moment spent staring at a whole lot of nothing over Tony’s shoulder.  When he did look back at Tony, his eyes were soft and glazed over with sadness, but Tony couldn’t detect any judgment there.   “All these years, I would see you on TV or in one of those magazines Nat swipes from her office, and you were always smiling.  I told myself, see?  He’s happy.  But, I knew.   I tried to tell myself, it’s just the camera, the flash, bad angle, caught him by surprise, whatever, but, your smile, it’s different when you’re really happy.  It was easier, thinking you were happy.  Nat says I’m a terrible liar, but I’m pretty damn good at lying to myself.  I’m sorry, Tony.  I should’ve…I don’t know. Done something.”
“All of them,” Steve insisted.
Steve turned, slowly, letting Tony’s hands guide him around.  Blindman’s Bluff, he thought nonsensically, recalling the childhood game, Bucky’s hands spinning him through the darkness and pointing him the way he was supposed to go.
“I do,” Steve agreed.  It was easy to agree.  Too easy, perhaps, but that was a path for another day.  “I was curious. I did not know your rules,” he said in what he hoped was a reassuring tone.  The boy’s shoulders sagged and his face relaxed somewhat.
“I’m working on it,” Pepper said, typing away on her tablet.  “Would you give me a few minutes?  It’s not exactly one-click buying, Tony.”
“Among his many talents,” Tony confirmed with a nod.
It had been that spring, the last time he saw Joshua.  The fat, grey-furred squirrel met him on the deck and climbed onto Tony’s shoulder to eat the pecans that Tony handed him one by one until his cheeks were stuffed.  That spring.  It was always ‘that spring’ in his head.  The spring they had finally managed to find time to coordinate a stay at the cabin with one of Tony’s Heats.   They never managed that feat again. Not the only thing from that spring they never managed again, Tony thought, closing his eyes for a long moment before opening them again and looking over at the lilies.  That spring was when he lilies first appeared, a bouquet Steve brought back to the cabin in a rush of excitement that translated into a shopping spree.
“You do, Tony.  Nothing that happens—or doesn’t happen—on the island is going to change that,” Steve assured him.  “Hey, listen, if you want, tomorrow, you can tweak those rocket schematics that I know nothing about.”
“Just you,” Steve said, capturing Tony’s gaze. “Just you and Peter. And Cam. That’s what I want.”
Home, where he would do what he was supposed to do, the dutiful, prodigal son, wanting to please the only person who was pretty much required to love him. He wanted Howard's love so badly, the man had been dead years and Tony was still trying to please him. How long had he let that clean energy idea sit in his computer files, reviled and ignored, but not quite deleted, like the Internet Explorer of his work projects? Years. Years of not wanting to touch it because the person who thought of it didn't exist anymore, or so he'd believed.
Too many good things were happening at once.  It was throwing his game off, Tony thought with a bit of disgruntled amazement, trying to reconcile everything in his head.  Dr. Barker.  Dr. Barker, who Steve had introduced him to at the gala.  Dr. Barker, who he had wished his Omega was interested in adaptive armor and who Tony had remembered to ask questions of instead of just info-dumping the poor bastard.
Tony took a goblet of water from the other, drinking his fill before handing it back.  He took a robe one of the slaves held out and donned it as he walked over to where Steve and Cam waited. Cam’s mother said her people used long, hooked spears to fish the river for monstrous fish twice the size of a man.  They told a story of a young boy who spent so much time in the water, he fell in love with a copper-scaled fish and grew gills and fins so as to be with her, and that is why the first fish of the season was given back to the river, so that the people may be blessed with their children to feed them through the long winters.  Cam told Tony that his mother thought Tony had this boy’s spirit, which Tony scoffed at, but Steve knew that he not-so-secretly cherished the thought behind the idea.  She made Tony a robe with one red and one gold-colored fish circling each other, which he wore each time he rose from the waters.  Steve wasn’t sure who the gesture pleased more, Tony or Cam.
With a sigh, Tony pushed himself off the bed and crossed the hallway to the bathroom.  Tony washed his hands and splashed water on his face, blotting it dry with the hand towel.  He braced his hands on the edge of the sink and leaned forward, looking at his reflection in the medicine cabinet mirror, then over his shoulder towards the open doorway where he could hear Steve puttering around in the kitchen, opening and closing drawers and cabinets.
Tony slid his hand into Steve’s and climbed out, gazing around at the crowd of people filing into the hall in pairs and small groups.  Around him, camera’s flashed and clicked.  He hadn’t really thought about photographers being here, but he supposed it made sense.  There were a lot of important people in attendance, at least based on Steve’s mental list.  Not like reality TV star kind of important, but still.  Tony felt Steve wrap his hand around Steve’s outstretched elbow, and realized he’d been standing there like it was his first time facing the Kodak soul-stealer or something.  He sucked in a breath and straightened his shoulders, looking up at Steve only to find Steve watching him with an expression that made Tony’s mouth go dry.
Right.  He was supposed to talk.  Convince Tony this was a good idea.  Steve had imagined this moment over and over in his mind, played out all kinds of scenarios, but he hadn’t known, then, what it would feel like. He hadn’t known that Tony’s happiness would be this strange, brittle, breakable thing that held Steve’s own.
“Rumlow said Bucky, and I asked how high he’d like me to jump,” Steve bit out, then let his head dip down to his chest for a minute before giving it a shake, like he could clear it, but the rushing hiss of the water hitting the tile filled it like white noise.  “It was my fault. They’re going to blame Wanda.  You know they are.  You gotta—you gotta tell Ross.  He’s looking for a reason, and I gave him one.  If he wants to come after someone, then it’s on me.”
“I—yes,” Steve replied, though he honestly couldn’t remember if Zola had said any such thing.  It seemed the answer the King expected to hear though, because he let out a small huff of laughter.
“Sleep,” Tony repeated, then turned and pulled Steve by the hand towards the bedchamber.  When they reached the bed, he nudged at Steve’s shoulders with a grunt, then gave Steve a satisfied look when Steve sat down heavily on the bed.  “Sleep, my soldier. Rest your mind from all of this.”
“And Stern?” Steve asked.  “With the whole punching thing?”
It didn’t take long to get the various wires and leads hooked up.  Dr. Cho oversaw everything via a video monitor, assuring him with her usual composure that they would be keeping a close eye on his vitals, though at the moment, she and Bruce were going over whatever dosage protocol they’d cooked up for what was supposed to help ease Steve into the appropriate state of consciousness.
“For you,” Tony hummed as Steve’s hands traced delicate lines over his shoulders, down his arms and across his stomach.
“Told you I could fly,” Tony announced, then flipped the faceplate up.
“Capra,” Steve chimed in.  “One of his better ones.”
“Look, I should just say, up front, you know I’ll give you the money.  Way more than that stupid seven thousand,” Tony offered with a grimace, expression going tight.  “If that’s what this is about, just say so, and we both finish this thing out, no complications.  I’m not judging,” he said quickly, slashing the air with his hand as if to emphasize how much he wasn’t judging Steve for the idea that must have taken root in his head that Steve might be angling for more.  It hurt to hear, that Tony would even think that, but Steve could imagine why.  How many people had just been there to use Tony over the years? Rhodes, Ms. Potts, Happy, and the lawyer, those seemed to be virtually the only people in Tony’s circle, even after a lifetime of glad-handing thousands. “I get it,” Tony rambled on. “You’ve got Barnes to think about, the whole benefits thing, not to mention getting yourself back on your feet with that asshat Ross blacklisting you from the kind of jobs you
“Man, I bet you know all about dealing with all those nutsos, huh?  You being you and all.  You must have some stories, am I right? He does, doesn’t he? I mean, this thing with the stripper.  Craziness, huh?  Vegas.  What are you going to do?  Not that I blame you.  Hell, who doesn’t want to come to Vegas and marry a stripper?  Living the dream, man, I’m telling you.  Legendary,” Estes said with a broad smile, looking over at Pepper, who was scowling, and Rhodey, who just puffed out a long breath through his cheeks and muttered something that rhymed with sass under his breath.
.  How did that work?  How many lives were lost while you struggled to find what you needed?  I am not sure I would call that managing. Here, the Lords and Ladies send me soldiers to fill our ranks, taxes to pay for our defenses and foodstuffs for our soldier’s bellies.  They could not do that were they struggling to tend to their own lands.  We have known peace for centuries, and none of that would be possible if things were different.  The realm would split apart, and our enemies would leap at the opportunity, as you know far too well. You have seen that for yourself, I believe. Your Free States barely survived a single generation. When we lived across the desert, on the shores of the Salt Sea, it was one of Tony’s ancestors who roused us when the earth would have opened up and swallowed us or spewed her fire on us.  She brought us here, and for more than a thousand years, a Stark has sat the throne.  War, famine, floods, a storm they still speak of centuries later, disease….but,
“Not well,” Steve affirmed.  “That’s…something of an understatement, but let’s go with that,” he continued with a slight smile that Tony thought was directed inward as much as to Tony. “Tony…look, we’re not always going to agree.  I’ll try to handle it better than I did this morning.  I meant what I said.  About Simpson.  If he’s your guy, then that’s good enough for me.  But…I get mad sometimes.  I say the wrong thing.  I don’t say enough of the right things…I’m trying, though,” Steve told him, voice ebbing with weary frustration.  “I really am trying, Tony.”
“Who was here before?” Steve asked.  “Before your people arrived, I mean.”
“Well. That’s up to you,” Steve said quickly, giving Tony a look before going back to watching the road pass by outside the limo’s darkened window.  “There will be dancing.  I don’t really dance, but, ah. I could try. If you wanted.”
“I believe you, Tony,” Steve finally rasped out, one hand coming up to curl against Tony's back, rubbing up and down for a few, soothing strokes before he dropped it down to join the other at his side.
Dr. Sloan’s.  That had been the name, Steve recalled, seeing it sitting there on the wobbly little bedside table she had painted blue when he was a baby, though long, thin strips of brown wood had long ago peeled away the paint.  Dr. Sloan’s Liniment. Amber liquid in a clear bottle with the black and white picture of a man sporting a bushy, handlebar moustache.  His memories of before the serum weren’t like now, but he could see the bottle clearly in his head, sitting there on the table by his bed, and how he hated that he would smell like that for days.  That piney, turpentine smell.  How he hated what that smell meant.  Sickness.
***********************************************
“Nor was my father,” Steve admitted.  Cam caught his gaze in the glass, then looked away, biting his lip.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, voice almost soft, picking at the words carefully.  That was enough to snap Tony out of his daze, because damn if Steve got to be concerned about him at this point.
“You know that the more you tell me it’s no big deal, the more I know it’s a big deal, right? And even if it wasn’t, it would be good for me to be there, right?” Steve said.  “For you. Especially with the whole thing with your Board, right?”
A handful of other Omegas milled about in small groups, chatting amiably, with occasional bursts of loud laughter.  Tony caught a few curious looks aimed in his direction.  Most everyone seemed to know each other, which made sense, he supposed.  Omegas were such a small part of the population as a whole. The stereotype that they all knew each other wasn’t completely without some merit.
He should stop.  He knew that.  But he hadn’t been counting stars instead of sheep, he’d been sitting at his window, watching the only science, the only math, the only thing that made sense slowly drift by, night after night, a glimmer of something wonderful and terrible that they couldn’t take away.
“Slowly,” Steve said, stroking a and over Tony’s hair.  Tony drank half of it down, then fell back into the cloud of down and burrowed in, hearing a soft chuckle from Steve at his efforts.
“Come to me,” Steve heard himself say.  Then nothing but a deep silence, though he thought, maybe, just a whisper in his ear as he slipped under,
“I’ll walk you up,” Tony offered, nodding to Steve.
He let himself into the apartment and made his way as silently as possible to the couch where he slept.  When his mom had her accident, Bucky had been kind enough to offer Steve a place to crash for a bit while she recovered. It was supposed to be a temporary thing, but the weeks had turned into months as Steve learned all about traumatic brain injury and other phrases, like “maximum medical improvement.”  Sinking to the couch, Steve put his head in his hands.  This whole evening was completely messed up.   He had no idea what to make of his evening with Tony.  It still held some dreamlike quality now, in the darkness of the night, that he was sure would fade come the morning.  But for now, he decided he’d hold onto that.
Steve nodded, turned, then stopped. He tugged Tony’s hand to his lips and brushed his fingers across the knuckles, well aware that all eyes were on them now that they had returned.  Tony watched him, opened his mouth to say something, then clamped it shut, but his eyes were lit with something bright and intense.
Maybe it was that simple to Cam, who had never known or expected any different.  It wasn’t as if Steve didn’t understand what Cam meant.  There were enough sleepless nights on an empty belly in his memory to understand.  Had he not watched his mother toil herself to an early grave, working even when her skin stretched across her bones so thin that Steve wondered if it would simply tear apart one day?  There had been a time when Steve’s own, useless body had promised little more than a life being a burden or a beggar, and what freedom, what choice, was there really in that? Not much, save for the hope that it could be better, that
A thing.  Tony had a thing.  Which was Tony-speak for he’d met someone and was done with team-bonding for the night.  It hit Steve right in the solar plexus, a stabbing burn that made his eyes water and he blinked to clear them.  It was unusual these days for Tony to abandon Steve alone at one of these functions, knowing how much Steve hated the dancing monkey act.  At least it was bearable when Tony was shilling it up by his side.
“Steve, he’ll leave,” Rhodey said.  “He’ll walk away.  If that’s what you really want.  It’ll kill him, but he’ll do it. For you.  Because he loves you that much.   So, you either treat this as something real, something that can go somewhere, or you cut him the fuck loose.”
It was an odd emptiness that followed.  Not the needy, desperate emptiness of before, just more of an awareness of absence, of having been full and now being different.  Not unpleasant, exactly.  Good in a way, even, with the dull, pulsing ache left behind and slow trickle of Tony’s seed as it leaked out of him somehow satisfying.  The King crawled off the bed and walked over to a pitcher on a stand by the window, dipping a cloth into the bowl next to it before returning to Steve.
“And then,” Tony sighed, wiping a hand over his mouth.
“Shut the fuck up, Stark!” he heard Decker shout from down the hall.  Tony’s mouth flattened into a thin line as he shot Steve an annoyed look.  Steve rolled his eyes, but shook his head slightly in apology.
How lonely such a life must be, though, Steve thought to himself as he surveyed the room.  Had the person, whoever they were, in their abject loneliness, found some dark craft in one of these books that let them reach out to others in their dreams?  Someone who used these books and strange objects and bottles of potions to make the lights in the sky and the noises that sometimes rumbled down the mountain? It seemed like something out of one of his mother’s stories, but just as far-fetched as any other explanation he could think of for all of this.
“Well,” Fury started, drawing out the word and bringing Steve’s attention back to the present.  “Just that he’s a bit, I don’t know…I guess you’d call it
“I don’t want you to hate me,” Tony said in a thick, shaky voice, then squelched his face together, his whole body shaking with the effort to hold back the emotional tide that threatened to overwhelm him.
“We’ll make it, Tony,” Steve cut in, coming over to drape his large hands on Tony’s shoulders. “It isn’t much further.”
Steve made a surprised sound, then shook his head in amazement. “Wow.”
“You should have something.  You barely ate that…entire plate of food. Wow, okay, when did that happen?  Anyway, I’m stuffed.  Couldn’t eat another bite,” Tony said.
at you.”
“What about my ass?  Tell me more,” Tony jibed, craning his neck to the side to peer over his shoulder with a speculative glance.  The elevator doors dinged open across the foyer and Ms. Potts walked in, phone to her ear.  “Pepper, Steve’s talking about my ass.”
not good?”
Tony hurried down the steps before anyone could gainsay him and nearly fell into the workshop in his haste to get inside.   He strode across the workshop floor and flopped into one of the rolling chairs, letting his head fall back.  He opened his eyes and stared at the fluorescent lights overhead until they burned a black spot in his vision, then let his eyes drift closed, trying to focus.  How much had he missed?   Think, dammit.
At first, he wasn’t sure why it surprised him, that his thoughts should belong to him, but when had they been his in any real sense?  In a way that couldn’t be derogated, controlled or contaminated by someone else?  By his own fear?  By the demands of a society that just wanted him to
“Billionaire,” Tony reminded him, then rolled his eyes.  “I will roll up the toothpaste tube if it will make you happy.”
Steve, my weapons, killed them!”
“Again, sorry about that,” Steve cut in, frowning.  He wasn’t quite sure how he always ended up apologizing for not getting a birthday gift, though he supposed he really shouldn’t have jumped to conclusions when Brock came home on July 4th with a twelve-pack of beer and a sandwich from the corner deli and nothing else.
Steve regarded him with an entirely too serious look.  Probably gas.  Damn lasagna.  Steve let out a soft snort, then blew air against his lips making a loud, rolling wet sound that seemed to please him an unjustifiable amount by the delighted laugh that followed.
He was so full.  It was crazy, but he felt he could feel it in the back of his throat, making it hard to swallow.  Tony let out a long, low moan and pushed his hips back and up, feeling his body adjust to accommodate Steve’s girth.  Steve pulled out halfway, then plunged in again, slow, but hard enough to rock Tony’s body forward.  The rush of feeling, the stretching pressure, the burning fullness, it was almost too much.  Out again.  Almost all the way.  The head of Steve’s cock caught just on the rim of Tony’s hole before he thrust in again.  Tony could feel his passage loosen and fill with slick.  It leaked out around Steve’s cock, making an obscene squelching sound each time Steve thrust inside him.  A hand on his hip again, and the angle changed, lifting him higher, and
“It was a three-wheeled—you know, you can all—Fifty bucks?” Rhodey demanded.  “You assholes.”
“Does it hurt?” he heard Tony ask from behind him on the bed. He felt it dip and move as Tony crawled down it, the heat from the other man’s body warming him as Tony drew closer. “Damn it, Steve, you should’ve said something! What the hell were you thinking? You shouldn’t have been—fuck. I’ll get Bruce. Just—just stay here, okay? Don’t move. No, wait, should you lie down? How bad is it?” Tony demanded, the litany rolling off his tongue in one long stream of panicked words.
interested, Peggy…I—I don’t know.  It’s so hard to tell where his head is these days.”
He always got so worked up over how it was going to go, and then the anxiety just made it worse, and he
“Yeah, Jesus, that’s good, huh?” Tony muttered.  “Like to make you come from this.  Bet you’d be gorgeous, huh? So fucking hot, Steve, Christ.”
Bucky paused, holding the egg atop the spatula over his plate.  “You hear what you’re saying, right?  I mean, you hear the words coming out of your mouth.  And you’re telling me I’m not supposed to--”
“Okay, so, like I said. Anything you need, just come find me,” Tony repeated as he headed for the door, Steve following behind him.  “Anytime.  Really,” he continued as he stepped to the other side of the threshold and turned back to face Steve, who had one had on the door and one braced against the frame.  “There’s a control panel on the table by your bed, if you need anything.  It’ll call me—or, really any of the team--or just have JARVIS put you through.  I’m usually up pretty much all hours, so it isn’t a bother.”  Oh, for fuck’s sake, just say ‘pretty please with a cherry on top’ and get it over with, Tony grumbled to himself, closing his eyes tightly as he tried to make himself focus.  “So, I guess this is goodnight then.”
as large as the sex stuff, Steve thought, a rueful smile forming.  He could feel a blush racing up his neck, and reached up to adjust the little fan above his head.  Wasn’t his fault he could barely form a coherent thought, Steve decided with a slight smile.  Tony lived up to his reputation.  And then some.
“Sorry to crash your little love nest, Stark, but you kind of stumbled onto something a lot bigger than just revenge pranking your walking Daddy Issue because you felt really, really bad about signing some papers,” Fury replied.
“So, it’s some kind of coma?” Steve asked, turning to give Bruce a frustrated look before looking back through the glass window where Tony lay in a hospital bed, hooked up to all kinds of machines, most of which Steve didn’t recognize.  One he did, though.  Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing. That was what Tony called it.  Steve privately thought the name had been just Tony’s clever way of downplaying just how much time and energy Tony had invested in the idea of creating alternative memories, though he’d never said as much to Tony.
“Your mom was okay with it?” Kirk asked.  “I mean, assuming you are.  Though, you are full-on Friend of Judy.  Obviously.”
“Of course. Always a delight,” Tony agreed with a slight nod as he took the pipe offered by the Ul. The Ul took a pipe of his own and, soon enough, passed it to his companions, who then offered it to Ross and Rhodes, though Steve saw that the latter declined.
“What did change your mind?” Tony asked.  Someone shouted congratulations at them as they walked, and Tony raised a hand in acknowledgment, though they didn’t slow.  “Rhodey can be persuasive, but you strike me as post-nuclear-winter-cockroach level of not letting go of an idea.”
“Please, please, Tony, Alpha, please,” Steve begged, eyes squeezed shut against the sensations.  Unable to resist the temptation, Tony bent his head down and swirled his tongue around the rim in one, long swipe.  Steve threw his head back and screamed, surely loud enough for half of Manhattan to hear and rocked himself towards Tony.  Tony looked down and watched in wonder as Steve’s hole widened before him, clear, gleaming fluid coating the rim.  He lined the head of his cock up with Steve’s entrance, pushing just the tip inside, feeling the warm, wet heat of Steve wash over him.
Tony looked up at the Captain, a question on his lips.  The man just took Tony’s arm out from under his cloak and pushed back the sleeve of Tony’s tunic where a bruise darkened his skin just above his elbow.  Tony opened his mouth to say something, tried to push his sleeve down or jerk his arm back.
“Not the point,” Rhodey said.
“A man who knew his way around words,” Tony said with a soft, fond smile, his eyes bright.
“I—yes. I’m glad, too,” Tony stammered, frowning down at his mug of lemonade.
“What have I told you?  Huh? Huh?”  Howard demanded, shouting now, a wet, spittle-filled sound that seemed to fill the kitchen and spill out into the small room where Steve sat riveted to the bed. A sharp sound, then.  Steve’s breath caught, hitched and shuddered. His heart wrenched in his chest, twisting up and pulling his stomach with it, as he tried to swallow back a keen of anger and pain.  He knew that sound far too well.
Fast, pounding thuds, shoes on stairs, Steve’s mind supplied, and then Tony was there, rounding the bottom post where the stairs turned, red-faced and wiping a hand over his eyes, blinking in horrified surprise at the room full of people, with an angry, red spot blooming on his cheek.  Mortified humiliation flickered across Tony’s all-too-familiar face.  Younger here.  Rounder and softer, in too-big clothes that seemed to swallow him, hanging on a frame that was still all angles.  Steve watched the younger Tony swallow, open his mouth as if to speak, then stop and swipe his face across the crook of his elbow.  He dropped his gaze down to his feet, then, though not before Steve caught a glimpse of shame-filled guilt, because there was looking and then there was
“Right, right, the toroidal field lines keep it self-sustaining while—“ Tony looked up, blinking at him in surprise.  Steve dropped the towel.  “Yeah, we’re done.”
“’Course we’re good here, Tony, come on, man.  You know I got your back,” Rhodey responded immediately.  “Call me tomorrow, okay?”
He smiled and picked up the papers, turning towards the fireplace. Holding them up to the light, he rearranged the papers one by one, then flattened them out together with the back of the stack towards the fire. An image came together from the bits and pieces on each of the papers, long and deadly and made to smash walls and rain fire down from above. He didn’t have a word for what it was. He wasn’t sure it existed in this world, though it did now, he supposed. Though he could not name the thing, he could see clearly enough what such a thing could do.
“Yeah?” Steve replied.
“There,” Steve said when he was done.  He laid back down, satisfied, though he kind of wished they didn’t need the condom. It would be nice to feel Tony for real, and he
Steve breathed in deeply, enjoying the musky, sweaty scent there, a trace of smoke and the greasy tallow Tony sometimes used in his workshop underneath it. He could feel his own cock pressing hard and insistent against the ties of his breeches, and shifted a bit, settling himself lower between Tony’s thighs. He took Tony in his mouth then, wrapping his lips around the sensitive head and sucking lightly, the way he remembered the first time Tony had done this for him that night in this bed, when Tony had come to him, and Steve had believed it an apology or gratitude, and certainly a goodbye, and it only now occurred to him, as he wound his tongue around the soft skin of Tony’s cock, tasting the salty bitterness that filled his mouth, that Tony never again sought him out here. Always, Steve came to him, in Tony’s bed, at least until today, and he wondered at that, the thought buzzing around the back of his mind as he watched Tony come undone above him.
He drank a few more sips, then Tony set it aside and held up the towel that had been draped over his arm. He reached out with it, then hesitated.
“We handled such things then, and we will handle them again if they should arise. Besides, Schmidt’s overconfidence likely led to his defeat as much as anything the Free States did. Truly, the Free States are barely a union, General,” Tony continued, “brought together only by war, and with that threat gone, likely to fall back to their farming and crofting. They are little threat to us.”
“You would send me to this place?” Steve asked, trying to picture it in his head, him and the likes of Kadina and Danen doddering around like relics well past their prime.  He shook his head.  It was a crazy idea, and yet, no, it had not occurred to him, nor had he thought to ask.  Zola’s threats clouded everything.  He couldn’t even get his mind to settle on how such a concept even fit in with his notions of this world.  A kindness? An obligation? To people who were your property?  Did such a place even exist, or was this some fantasy fed to Tony by those who did not want him to question what was underneath all the gilt and fancy baubles? Not that it mattered, of course.  Steve would be long gone by then, one way or the other, he reminded himself with a mental shake.
“I…no…no, I’d just like to…wait…just a bit.  On the contract, I mean.  Just…I need a couple of days,” Steve said.
Fury was looking around the room, gaze darting from the kitchen to the sunken living room where Steve was relaxing on the sofa. He turned to Tony, opened his mouth to say something, then apparently couldn’t quite find the right words to explain just how impressed he was, so clamped his mouth shut again.
Comments and kudos will be given high-ranking goats.
.  Then, it turned out he was wrong about a lot of things he thought he knew about the war, about what they were doing, and how they were doing it.  And now, it felt sometimes like he couldn't trust his own instincts.  Didn’t know which way to go and just kept floundering, hoping he’d finally land on sand that didn’t shift out from under him.
, Tony thought with no small amount of glee.
“Oh, he brought it,” Tony said with a smile.  “You’re really not mad at me?”
“Brock Rumlow, three tours in Afghanistan.  Definitely
“I—I know.  I know, he wouldn’t blame me,” Steve said, swiping a hand over his eyes and drawing in a shuddering breath.  “Kind of makes it worse, you know?” he huffed out around a bitter laugh.
Steve stared down at Tony for a span of heartbeats.
He smiled at Steve.
“Supposedly.  Wanted to fight in the pits when he first got here.  Too pretty for that though, aren’t you?” Rumlow demanded with a sneer, gripping Steve’s chin and forcing his head around.
“Shhh,” the King admonished suddenly, placing his hand over Steve’s knee again and rubbing lightly, soothingly, different than before.  “It wasn’t meant as a criticism.  People, they…it is just that they rarely surprise me anymore.  But you…you leave me astonished at regular intervals, and I assure you that is quite more the accomplishment than you may realize.  I keep telling myself, it is an act, and one that will falter.  Another of Zola’s attempts to gain the favor he craves, and it is, isn’t it, in its way?  I am not so far gone as to not realize what the little toad is about, sending me someone like you, and yet you…I think he stumbled upon you without quite meaning to, without quite realizing what it was he was giving me, didn’t he?”
Yet another route twisted through the castle this time, though Steve recognized the winding stairs that led up to the King’s apartments as soon as they reached them.  Zola took a huffing breath when they reached the hallway that Steve remembered from the prior evening and cast a sharp, studying look at Steve.
Tony sighed heavily, hands flexing into fists where they hung at his sides.  There was wrong and then there was completely fucked-up and pulling the stripper with a hero-complex into this mess of a plan was definitely tilting firmly towards the latter, Tony had to admit to himself.  He glanced over at Pepper, who caught his look and started to open her mouth, then snapped it closed again, teeth worrying at her bottom lip instead.
“It’s complicated,” Steve said again.
“Yes.  Good. That’s good, Steve,” Tony said encouragingly, making Steve realize he was rocking his hips, pressing them down on Tony’s fingers.  Steve threw an arm over his face and bore down again, letting out a hiss of air as Tony added a third finger.
“That’s not what I—that’s not what this is. I told you. I couldn’t let them—they hurt him, Bucky! You really think I’m going to just—“ Steve heard himself shouting and tried to force his breathing to calm against the flow of words, lest they carry outside the tent. “We had a mission here. It was the right thing to do. I said we were going back, what more do you—“
Steve had no choice but to follow Zola and the guards, though the route they took was entirely different than the one they had taken the night before.
“Thoughtful,” Tony repeated.   He did remember David.  Small and stick-thin, with wide gray eyes and an avid interest in those romance books with pirates or knights or whatever strong, handsome Alpha was going to sweep him off his feet and carry him away from mundanity.  David’s Alpha was sixty-something years old, pock-marked, liver-spotted and balding, save for a few long strands he combed over his head.  Congrats, David.  Bet that watch was super-helpful. Tony rubbed a hand against his forehead.  He could almost swear he heard ticking, but it was his heart, beating in his ear that held the phone to it.
The elevator pinged and the doors slid open in front of him. He stepped out into the living area, walking purposely towards the hall to his room, but stopping short when he finally looked up to see the team gathered around the kitchen table at various points in their breakfast routines.  He couldn’t help that his eyes immediately found Tony’s, where he leaned with his hands gripping the back of one of the kitchen chairs.
“Have you, ah...lived here long?  I can’t believe I’ve never heard people talk of this place,” Steve said, glancing around a bit to take in the unusual array of things in the room again.  “It’s old, isn’t it? How did you find it?”
“It wasn’t just me, it was everyone.  Well, everyone I knew, anyway. Everyone was always hungry, always worrying about the next meal.  In fact, there were so many hungry kids in the city without parents, they didn’t have places for them.  They put a bunch of them on trains and sent them out west, on account of I guess the people there needed kids,” Steve said as he absently knotted and untied a length of rope over and over again.
“Steve?” Tony panted.  “Steve?”  Dear God, if he’d fucked this up—
“You’re killing me,” Tony said, rolling his eyes.  “On purpose, I see,” he added at Steve’s satisfied smile.  “Fine, have your fun.  Alright, let’s hear it. Come on.  Early life portion of your Wiki page.  Go.”
People called out Tony’s name like they knew him as he and Steve passed through the front entrance, and, Steve supposed, in some way, they probably thought they did.  Tony either ignored them or gave a nod and kept going, dragging Steve along in his wake.  He seemed to consciously make himself slow as they walked inside, cleaving to Steve’s side so closely that Steve could feel the brush of Tony’s body moving in time next to him.  Probably ready to throw himself bodily in front of anyone Steve tried to talk to, Steve thought, giving Tony a sideways look.
Finally, they got Lily strapped in to her carseat.  She was already yawning, dark eyes starting to droop and mouth forming a small O, as she made a few half-hearted suckling sounds, blinked up at Tony while he stroked a finger across the fine hairs on top of her head, then drifted off.
Anthony needed someone else.
Steve doubted that was true.  Steve doubted the man liked or disliked much of anything, not anymore.  Whoever he had once been had long ago been wiped away, and now the man had gone somewhere else in his mind, the same way those poor souls Steve remembered seeing after they liberated one of Shmidt’s camps had simply left themselves or gone so deep inside, they couldn’t find their way back.
, “I’m…I’m fine.  I’ll just…I’ll just go.” Steve said, scrambling from the bed now.  His clothes were in the living room, so he grabbed the discarded towel and without looking back, moved out the door as fast as he could, closing it quietly behind him.  He quickly made his way to the living room, where his pile of clothes waited.  Dressing in a hurry, he didn’t bother with the jacket or many of the tiny, frustrating buttons.  Looking around, Steve remembered that Tony had said someone called Jarvis would help him.
“Tony,” he whined, plaintive and pleading.
Steve nodded jerkily, once, his mouth falling open.  “I might…you know.”
Steve would be warm and soft, but solid, which didn’t make sense, but it felt true.  Tony could curl up against his side, lay his head on Steve’s lap, and feel Steve’s fingers lace through his hair, and it would feel so good.  So very good.  Tony had looked at Steve’s open hand, splayed out on the plaid sofa cushion, and wondered what would happen if he slid his own over Steve’s palm.
His stomach turned over.  Part of the bread stuck to the roof of his mouth.  He had to force himself to swallow it.   Were they really going to do this here?  Now?  You came here for this, a small voice echoed inside his head.  Away from the workshop and the technology.  Away from the Pollacks and matching cups and the bed big with the dip in the center of the mattress that curved around their bodies.  You brought him here, where he fell in love with you.
“Are you kidding? It was like a fucking telenovela up here, Christ,” Clint grimaced, shaking his head.  “I was this close to blowing the whole op, barging in here, and telling you two couple of pining idiots to just please, for the love of God,
He sucked in a calming breath and closed his eyes, opening them again and reeling off the names of the stars in his head as he looked skyward.  It helped.  The routine of it.  How many nights had he sat at his window back home and looked at this same sky, mentally checking off his list because he could, because it was something they couldn’t take away from him.  Even when he was in his bed and couldn’t see the stars themselves, he could see them in his head, bright pinpoints across the backs of his eyelids.
“Bad luck to toast with water,” Tony said automatically.
A foot nudged his shoulder, waking him.  “Up,” a rough voice shouted.  Another kick.  Steve sat up and looked around, then down at his feet, which throbbed with a sudden jolt, now that he was awake.  He wasn’t going to be able to walk.  He knew it.  “You can ride today,” the man said.  Steve looked up in surprise and recognized the wagon’s driver.  “Get ‘im up there,” the driver said to two of the guards.  “Best we be getting on our way.”
“I mean…it’ll take another thirteen thousand years or so…” Tony added, frowning in confusion.
“I don’t—there’s nothing really to say,” Steve replied.  “I’m fine.  Everything’s fine.”
“Okay,” Rogers said after a long moment, letting out the word with a slow hiss of breath that he’d apparently been holding.
Their movements slowed and the steps Tony had spent years practicing melted into little more than a gentle sway, as the last strain of the song echoed and then went silent.  Tony tore his gaze from the view he was barely noticing, and looked up at Steve uncertainly, nearly choking on his breath when he did. Steve was looking down at him with an expression of such unbearable tenderness that it was almost painful.
“What?” Steve huffed around a questioning laugh.
“Hey, you’re the one who said you like how I talk,” Tony reminded him, going back to trying to arm wrestle his tie, though now he could feel the weight of Steve’s attention on him, sharp and watchful.  Noticing things.  It made Tony’s fingers tremble unsteadily, nearly unraveling the knot—nope, damn it, not working, Tony’s mind blinkered.  He let his hands dropped to his sides with a grinding, frustrated grunt.
“Security should try harder,” Tony’s driver said over the din.  Happy, Steve remembered.  Like the dwarf.  Guess that made him Sleazy, Steve thought with a grim, determined sort of humor.  Tony had his head slightly down, eyes shielded behind the sunglasses, religiously not saying anything. Steve wondered if he even heard it anymore or if this was so common for him that it all just bounced off.  I’m rubber, you’re glue, Steve mentally recited the familiar refrain.  It had been crap when they were kids and it was crap now, he thought, glancing over at the top of Tony’s ducked head.
“Are you---are you sure?” Tony huffed out. Steve was either going to hit him or kiss him, so he went for the latter, grabbing him, suit and all and shoving him up and back against the wall, lifting him off the ground a bit as he claimed Tony’s mouth again, and that, well, that finally seemed to get the point across.  They somehow managed to make it to Tony’s bed, pieces of armor littering their path like shiny breadcrumbs, Tony stripping his clothes off in record time with absolutely no hint of embarrassment, stalking after Steve with an almost feral gleam in his eye.  Steve wasn’t sure what exactly it was he said to Tony, but it was apparently enough to make the other man practically rip his uniform off, so Steve figured it fell into the right thing to say category.   He was finally naked, sprawled on the bed with Tony hovering over him, and this, God, yes, this was what he’d been waiting for all these weeks, months, years, forever.  Tony was babbling about various gods for some reason Steve couldn’t fathom, but Tony wasn’t touching him and that seemed to be the more important point.
“Still…helping Rhodey, though…I wish you’d just come to me for money like a normal person and not…” Tony muttered, letting the thought trail off with a wave of the hand Steve wasn’t holding.
“Ms. Romanov…she told me about…about the money,” Steve managed, stumbling over his words because none of them sounded right.
“You’ve just described any of over a hundred possibilities in the downtown area alone,” the investigator snapped in annoyance.
“You didn’t say anything to them, did you?” Steve asked.
“It’s okay. Forget it, Tony, it’s fine,” Steve repeated.
“Thank you,” Tony said, though he sounded clearly pleased by the compliment.  I should do that more often, Steve thought. Everyone always fawns over the King, but how many have the chance to tell Tony that he is beautiful? Tony should hear that, as much as I can give it to him, Steve resolved to himself.
“I can—” Cam started, but Steve shook his head.
It was, Steve supposed, the only kind of strategy someone like Cam could afford to think about.   Someone like Cam, Steve scoffed.  Was he really all that different?
--up here, which doesn’t make sense, alright, but, I get you to myself, no SHIELD, no Nat dropping literally dropping in—still not over the parachute on the roof thing, by the way—but, then, there are all these memories, and I think about how much has changed since we were first here, and--“
At Steve’s urging, Cam bought a steady stream of foods from carts and vendors, then promptly gifted them back to the adoring crowd.  Full bellies, an afternoon’s entertainment and a few coins to rub together, and most of the people would go home basking in delight, never quite questioning what they saw, at least, not enough to scratch away the surface.  They do not want to see, Steve thought, and it is so very easy not to look when you are shown the exception.
“I can do more,” Tony said after what was both interminably long and far too quick.  She slid the needle out and capped the bag, still warm with his blood.  “Come on,” he said, tapping his knuckles on his knee.
“I look stupid,” Tony grumbled while his reflection frowned back at him.
to stop thinking of him.  He didn’t even know why he was thinking about all this stuff.  The worry about what to say to Brock was messing with his head or something.  What he needed to do was clear his head and stop--stop thinking these crazy thoughts.
“That would be great,” Steve replied in a sort of shaky, relieved tone.  “I’d love to meet them.”
“Who are you?” Tony asked, tearing his gaze away from the deep fissures and back to Steve.  “The Director of SHIELD plays matchmaker to keep you happy.  Coulson pulls his Dr. Phil routine whenever he sees me.  You’ve got that X on your tags, which means something to somebody, but I looked all over the DoD’s server—ah, website--and there’s nothing about that even existing as a designation.  You’re strong.  Not normal Alpha kind of strong, but, like, strong-strong,” Tony pointed out, rubbing a hand over his mouth.  “Alphas, even the ones that are the size of something that tries to trash Tokyo, run for the hills at the drop of your name.”
Proposal.  It hurt.  He couldn’t very well lie to himself.  It was that deep, tight ache of not quite being able to catch his breath.  It shouldn’t, maybe.  Maybe it was unfair of him.  It wasn’t as if he had ever had any claim on Tony, and certainly not now.
Tony had time to think the odd thought that the alien’s fingers were incredibly smooth, and then the creature closed its--his, whatever--eyes, and Tony felt the panic subside as suddenly as it had come, just like it had a moment ago, but far more intense.  It was if all the fear, the pain, the worry, every horrible scenario playing out in his head was just gone. Sucked out of him. A sense of peace filled him. Serenity. Safety. Then, unfettered joy, like the first time he took the suit flying, but not quite that, and somehow, that feeling was different than the others, but still comforting in its own way.  He felt himself relax, deep breaths filling his lungs as he stared up at the alien above him until brilliant blue eyes snapped open again.
Except that
Tony shot a forlorn look towards where Happy sat in the warm Bentley, then tugged black leather gloves out of his coat pocket.  He slipped them over his hands and brought them up to his mouth to warm them with quick puffs of breath.  God, it was cold out here.  Stupid nature.
“Tony, what? You can tell me,” Steve insisted.
The room was not at all what he was expecting.  He blinked, so confounded for a moment that he half expected this was the point he would simply wake up and realize all of this was nothing more than a dream, but nothing so fortunate as that occurred.
“Reforms.  Changes.  Improvements.  I don’t know, but just because it is the way my father did it or how it has been done since time immemorial, what does it matter if we can make it better?” Tony asked.  Steve felt his eyes widen in surprise, and opened his mouth to say something, though he wasn’t sure what.  To say that he thought it amazing of Tony to hear him out and seek to make changes?  Or to tell Tony that the system could not stand, no matter what reforms he made?  Could he not at least try to make things better for so long as he was here and had the King’s ear?
“Does it?  Work like that?” Tony asked.
“It’s ready,” Tony said. “Just look through here.  This adjusts the zoom.  This one is for resolution.”
After that night, things largely went back to normal between them.  Or, rather, nothing actually changed, except Tony stopped hiding and shelved the embarrassed sulking.  Steve was still remarkably, unpredictably nice.  They watched movies.  Steve read books, and Tony read LIGO detection reports, and sometimes Steve asked him about what Tony saw in the numbers, and sometimes Tony could get Steve to talk about Asimov or Clarke.
“Do not, under any circumstances, do that,” Ms. Potts cut in.  “We are working on the name.”
“What if you don't have to lose any more?” Rhodey asked rhetorically. “Come on, Tones. You gotta know, one way or the other. Then, whatever you want to do, man, you know I'm on your six.”
He could tell Steve the thing he bought was like that big, diaphanous floral thing Hepburn wore in Bringing Up Baby, all demure and flowing, not like this, what he had chosen, this stupid, black lacy thing that made him look like---the front door opened.  It always creaked now, since it’s unfortunate losing bout against horny supersoldier.  Steve had replaced the door, of course, but the frame was messed up. Something to do with the stress on the wood.  Stress on the wood, Tony’s mind sang, and a nervous, shaky giggle burst out of him.  Oh, God, he was going to do this, wasn’t he?  All because Steve may have thought about some random Omega, decades ago, and wouldn’t talk about it, which meant it had been something,
“Something like that,” Steve replied softly, pressing another kiss to Tony’s temple.  “Something a lot like that.”
It was, he realized abruptly.
Steve closed his eyes and drew in a shaky breath, then opened them again and stared up at the canopy above the bed with its vines and birds forever caught in mid-flight.  “If it was possible to lay all of this down for anyone, I would do it for you. Please believe that,” Steve said. Tony sighed deeply, looking up at Steve with recognition of his own words in his eyes.
"JARVIS, note to self: Move," Tony sighed.
“3B,” Steve explained, turning to Tony.
Tony was laughing now, his eyes bight with mirth, clearly relishing Steve’s story of his misbegotten youth and the troubles he and Bucky invariably managed to themselves into, this particular tale involving a sofa on tiny wheels someone dumped behind their apartment building, a street near Prospect Park with enough of a slope to make it a challenge, and a lesson in friction when the left front wheel spun so fast it ignited the sofa, which careened wildly off course and sent the two of them hurtling through Mrs. Haskins’ fence being chased by a flaming piece of living room furniture.  Not their finest moment, admittedly.
Steve and Cam swapped a look, and then the boy pointed at the spread of food set out on the table in front of the fireplace.  Steve shrugged his acquiescence, and Cam bounded over to the tray.  Steve tried to eat, but his stomach was fluttering too much to have an appetite.  He found himself constantly looking towards the door, waiting for Tony to arrive, though the time dragged on with no sign of the King.
“You said.  You said, whatever it was, we’d be okay,” Tony reminded Steve in rough, broken voice that he barely recognized as his own. It sounded like a plea.  He thought maybe it was, as useless as it felt. Steve was already gone. They both knew it. Tony was just prolonging the inevitable. A part of him understood that, but he couldn’t seem to just let go and walk away, as familiar as that song and dance should have been to him by now.
In the years after that night, the sky above the mountains flashed with lights and echoed with deep, booming thunder. People said it was just storms, but they crossed themselves when they said it.  Steve liked to watch it from his vantage point in the tiny loft where the window at the foot of his narrow bed opened up to the distant peaks. The noises and lights never frightened him, for some reason, though his mother always prodded him to say his prayers and go to bed, which he did, because he didn’t want her to worry, but the bangs and clamors filled his head as he drifted off and he thought, strangely, of flying, like a bird, but at night, so close to the stars, he felt he could reach out and touch them.
“I know how Steve likes his burgers,” Barnes replied.
“I multitask,” Stark replied.  “Why’d you drop out? You won an award and everything. I’d buy this. It’s way better than what Pepper makes me buy, trust me. ”
“I just wanted to help.  To do what was right.  Zola, Stane, people like that…I’ve known them before. Their kind.  They hide in plain sight, and only show their true selves to people they think don’t have the power to do anything about it,” Steve replied. “Anyone else would have done the same.”
Steve didn’t know how long they kissed. Minutes, hours, time seemed to flow with no meaning to him. With a broken groan, Tony finally pulled back, leaving Steve’s mouth aching and kiss-swollen.
“No!  No, I am fine,” Steve assured him quickly.  “I am, Tony. It—it was just a momentary malaise. It has passed.  I think, I should eat, perhaps. That is all.”
“It’s okay, you know. If you’re a government lab rat, I mean.  I don’t mind,” Tony said, keeping his eyes forward and trying not to squirm in his seat.  In the rearview mirror, he saw the driver’s eyes flick to his before going back to studiously pretending Tony didn’t exist.  “It wouldn’t change anything about…anything.”
Steve could feel his body vibrating with anger, fear, wrongness, that gunmetal, coppery taste in the back of his throat that always tasted like seawater when he swallowed.  He was standing, though he didn’t remember getting up. His fists were clenched tight, white-knuckled, though Steve could feel the blood pounding through his temple, a shuddering-throbbing sound that drowned out Fury’s voice to a dull pinprick.  The room swayed in his vision, a red-hued tableau that Steve hated with a blinding intensity for a moment.
“Tony?” Steve said in bewilderment.  “How did you get this number?”
Steve saw the color drain from Tony’s face, his eyes go wide and mouth slacken in shock.  Tony’s eyes locked on his, a horrible question forming in their depts.  And Steve had a moment, oddly touched, to think that Tony remembered, remembered to ask him, when Tony said, “Is that…is that…Steve?” in such an awful, choked voice that Steve wanted to wrap himself around Tony in one fell swoop, but couldn’t seem to get his body to move from where he was rooted in place.
“Huh?” Tony started, then shook himself out of his stupor.  “Right. Well, let’s not keep him waiting, then.”
.  He watched until they turned the corner, and then he turned his head to the side, searching for a moment, and laid his head back down, thoughts flitting through his mind a bit like memories from a dream, all hazy and strange and
“Listen, ah,” Bruce started, swiping his thumb against his lip and twisting his mouth into a grimace.  “Whatever you see in there, it’s—I mean, it’s not real or anything.  It’s just, you know, a dream or whatever.  Something to keep him from trying to throw off the tech.  Like a fantasy sort of thing.  Keep him docile, so he doesn’t even really care about figuring it out, see?”
“Look at you,” Tony breathed out.  He reached out a hand and held it over Steve’s chest, then pressed it down, tracing a pattern down Steve’s stomach.  Steve felt his cock twitch again and caught Tony’s eyes darting down to the motion before coming back to follow the trail of his hand across Steve’s chest.
“Thanks,” Tony responded flatly.  She hadn’t expected him to pick up and had been preparing her voicemail in her head, he could tell from the surprise in her voice.
“He doesn’t…” Steve began, then decided he couldn’t pull off that big of a whopper.  “He just doesn’t know you like I do.”
“But, there is often a lot of work to be done after the big battle is over. SHIELD assists with that, and when necessary, so do the Avengers,” Fury continued over Clint.  “The nature of this radioactive living island requires some delicate handling to fully contain.  I’d like Natasha, Clint and Thor to accompany a SHIELD team to the Pacific to ensure there are no problems with containment.  Dr. Banner, you’ll be on stand-by, if you don’t mind.”
That was the whole point of this, of course.  The money. It had been his decision to do this in the first place, not something Tony had pulled him into.  No one forced him to do this.  It was his choice.
Steve scrolled through the photos on his phone.  He had plenty of photos  of Brock.  There were, he noticed as he scrolled, only a few of the two of them together.  He should make it a point this weekend to take some more while they were on the trip, he thought, as he found one that was clear and showed a good close up of Brock’s face.
said--”
Instead of sitting at the small table and chairs where Steve sometimes ate his meals when he had the energy to get up, as Steve expected, the man walked over to the fireplace, doffed his gloves and stoked the flames with the nearby poker.  He held his hands out to warm them and stared down at the fire.  Outside, thunder rolled and a whip-crack of lightning followed, making the house shake enough to make Steve’s teacup jump, as if it, too, was unnerved by the noise.
If he isn’t available, I won’t go, Steve told himself, letting out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. There. That made sense somehow. It wasn’t as if he really deserved this, even from a stranger. Maybe particularly from a stranger. This kind of trust… he shook his head, grimacing as he looked away from the phone. No. He didn’t really deserve that from anyone, did he? So, if the man from Room Six wasn’t available, for whatever reason–not that it was any of his business–then he wouldn’t go, and that would be the end of it. The end of all of this. He would just have to deal with… everything.
answered, Tony noticed, turning back to look at their blurry reflections in the metal of the elevator doors. He had no idea what to make of it.
“Hey! Congrats!” Happy burst in.
“Thank you,” Steve said, but the line had already gone dead.  He should feel a sense of accomplishment or relief, he supposed, but it was hard to trust the universe enough to let himself.  Maybe he should have waited until he actually had the rest of the money from Tony.  Probably would have been the smart thing to do, but he’d been waiting to make that call for months, since Estes had shown him the door for the last time with a trespassing threat following Steve out.
“Well. People like us. Just a few.  We found each other, you could say,” Tony told him.
“Well.  This is…unexpected,” Natasha said evenly from the doorway just behind Rhodes.  “Hey, James.  Pepper. Tony,” she finished lowly.
“Care to share with the rest of the class?” Tony asked, somewhat bemusedly as he looked up at Steve from the glow of the pool.
And what did those hands do with it, he thought with a sudden rush of bitterness as he turned the thing T’Challa had given him over, looking for some kind of clue.  I had no choice, he told himself but the words were empty now. Cold. I had no choice is the mantra of a man who made a choice and wanted to believe he hadn’t, and Steve wasn’t going to lie to himself.  Not anymore.
to being sure of that.  No one kisses someone like that without there being some kind of—of feelings there.  Granted, he had zero actual knowledge of this, but it felt like it
“Jesus fucking Christ, Steve,” Tony ground out, closing his eyes again and trying to think of differential equations.  “Okay, okay.  Okay,” Tony babbled.  “I’m going to get you loose now, okay?  Just try to relax.  It’ll feel weird at first, but you’ll get used to it.  Anything you don’t like, just tell me.”  He took a deep breath and dug around in the mess of a bed for the tube of lube.  He squirted a liberal amount on his hand and rubbed them together, warming it, then added another dollop to his index finger.  He pushed Steve’s thighs even further apart and touched the tip of his finger lightly to the rim of muscle around Steve’s hole, coating the raised edge.   Tony looked up at Steve, who was staring down at him, pupils dark, a fine sheet of perspiration on his brow and chest.
“Good thing I don’t really have any plans,” Steve said as the doors slid open.  A couple of people got off, then Steve stepped in, holding the door for Natasha.  “Going up?”
“This…ah” Steve began, when the man finally put him down, “Tony, this is Tor, child of Frigga, and Nasha, child of Mela, of the Eagle Camp of the Midgar peoples. Tor, Nasha, this is Tony. My Omega. And this is his companion, Dummy, who answers to him.”
“Talking birds,” Steve said, shaking his head and falling back flat against the bed.
And okay, that hurt.  He understood Happy was looking out for his boss, but he couldn’t escape the guilt he felt at the judgment evident in Happy’s tone.  But, he’d come all this way.  Unless Happy planned to have him thrown out, which now that he thought about it was a definite possibility, he wasn’t leaving without seeing Tony.
Though, the prospect of an outing certainly interested him.  On many levels.  The idea of seeing Tony out and about in his regalia, waving to an adoring crowd while he made his way through the city, filled Steve’s chest with something akin to pride, and, at the same time, he wondered what Tony saw when he looked at the sea of faces and saw collars worn like invisible chains.  Lets everyone know your value, Steve recalled, touching his fingertips to his collar.  Did Tony look upon the ironclad slaves who toiled behind their masters or mistresses and measure their worth the same way he would some other piece of chattel?
Everything hurt.
“Yeah?  I’ll have to ask him about them,” Tony said, tilting his head to the side and regarding Steve across the back seat of the limo.
kept you up nights.  He was fancy, little night music, I don’t know,” Tony replied.  “Look, the point is, I’m trying here, so can you…you know, give me something?” Tony asked plaintively.
“Steve,” Tony began, his voice heavy with an unspoken apology.  “I’ll get JARVIS on this, we’ll scrub everything we can, okay? And Matt—Matt can do some kind of cease and desist thing or—or something.  I don’t know. We’ll figure it out, just…shit.”
He wanted Tony.  Wanted Tony to take him to his bed, touch him, make him feel.
“That honestly might be the best thing I’ve ever felt in my whole life,” Tony said in a breathy voice as Steve finally dropped his hands away and rinsed the soap off of them.
Steve frowned, but didn’t press it.  “So, you mentioned the gym and some charities,” Steve said, clearly searching for a new subject.  “With SHIELD gone, what exactly do I do around here when we aren’t saving the world?” Steve asked, looking around the room as if a daily schedule might appear, which, quite frankly, was entirely possible, knowing Steve and his damn lists.
The Stranger nodded at him, drawing Anto’s focus back to him.  He bared his teeth again and pointed at the poultice in Anto’s hand.  It was different when the Stranger made such a face. There was no malice or anger there.  Instead, his face went soft and his body relaxed. His water-eyes crinkled at the corners. Anto thought he looked nice like that, at least once he got used to it.  Now, Anto rather liked the Stranger’s bared-teeth look and sometimes tried to do things that seemed to produce it, like bring the Stranger something to do with his hands while he sat, though since Anto was Omega, this mostly meant tasks like weaving and separating plants and animal parts to be dried and hung.  It had surprised Anto when he had brought some work to the cave along with the man’s food that the man had been interested in what he was doing, then shocked him all the more when the man actually started helping. It hadn’t occurred to Anto that the man could do those things, even if he had wanted to. A Clan man couldn’t.  He would have no Memories for it.
“Not at first.  Catholic, remember?  But, she came around,” Steve said with a slight huff of air at the memory of her in her rainbow scarf, which she knitted herself and wore even when she was in the hospital trying to get one of the young doctors to take Steve to coffee.  He’s a doctor, Steve.  He’d take good care of you, Steve remembered her scratchy, weathered voice whispering loudly over the machines.  Bruce had, though not the way Steve’s mom had hoped.  He’d walked a numb, drained, robotic Steve through the process of finalizing everything with his mom, stayed in the room with Steve and Bucky until the machines stopped beeping, and then pointed Steve to one of the nearby apartments and a landlord who liked the produce from Bruce’s garden and would cut Steve a deal.
“Oh, sure.  If you want,” Steve said quickly, rubbing his hands against his sides and crossing his arms over his chest.  He’s nervous again, Tony thought, the idea filling him with a flood of warmth.  Whatever it was, he would tell Steve he liked it, he realized.  For maybe the first time in his life, he’d happily pretend to like something to spare someone else and not himself.  It was...strange.  Not unpleasant.  Just strange, the way it felt to see Steve happy when it wasn’t caught up in worrying about what Steve’s unhappiness might mean for him.
Tony hadn’t seemed particularly excited about the shopping or the gala, for that matter, which surprised Steve a bit, if he were honest.  He thought Omegas liked that kind of thing?  Getting all dolled up and showing off a bit.  They
“That...you signed that,” Tony clarified. “Before we got—union-ed or whatever the kids were calling it in those days.”
he thought, flushing with embarrassment.
Steve sucked in a breath, pausing for a moment.  “Guess they were for you, anyway,” he said finally.
The Event was an outlier, Tony decided.  The problem started that night, really.
“Uh…you, um…you doing okay there?” Tony asked, trying not to sound like he was concerned.  What if he’d done something wrong?  While he’d been with Omegas in the past, he’d never actually done this part of things before.   Seemed like entirely too much effort and risk for far too little reward at the time.
“Troublemaker, huh?”  Tony asked in a light, teasing tone, as if he had been reading Steve’s thoughts. Steve let out a bark of surprised, nervous laughter before he could help himself, then felt himself let out a relieved breath of air.
“Probably. After...how many Night Stalker combat drops was that for you? Got an Air Force pilot buddy who grudgingly admits those guys could possibly fly some tourist choppers over a beach or something, which, you know, high praise from the Air Force,” Stark said, tossing him a smile that did something to Steve’s stomach that momentarily distracted him from what Stark was saying.
The camera flashed to dark, then the screen lit up again on a large, tidy kitchen with white-washed cabinets and a black and white tiled floor, filled with a group of people, all seeming to be talking over each other, having about three different conversations from what Steve could tell.  Maria and Jarvis were talking about picking up more supplies in town, but lamenting who might be open on the holiday weekend.  Stane and the man Steve assumed was Vernon Van Dyne were discussing the lack of funding coming out of the DoD and uniformed branches lately, and the two girls were debating popsicle colors while staring into the open freezer with the same fervor.
Steve smiled, inordinately pleased at the notion, and dropped his head back on the pillow. “Shutting up now.”
“What? Nothing.
“I didn’t give you leave to go,” Lady Bain said, tightening her grip.  “Tony always was far too soft with his slaves,” she added in a voice that made Steve’s stomach curdle.  “You see what happens, Almec? I’ve told him many times that he needs to have a firmer hand,” she said, then smiled, wolflike.  “Tony always did enjoy a firmer hand, you’d think he would have learned how to handle himself by now.”
Steve spent most of the ride back to SHIELD staring out the car’s window while Allen chattered on about interest rates and something to do with points.  Steve had money now.  More than he ever imagined having, that was for sure.  Back pay. Hostile Fire pay.  Per diems.  And, apparently, the Army had decided that his time in the ice qualified as some kind of prisoner of war status, which meant he progressed in rank the whole time.  Seventy years of promotions without doing a damn thing.  Must be the US military, Steve thought with a sigh, though said nothing as Allen droned on about the closing.  Technically, that gave him the pay of modern-day four-star general, though, as he’d told Coulson, he was a bit attached to the moniker of Captain, whatever his pay stub might say.
Mostly, Tony had just been royally pissed.
“Tony,” Steve laughed. “Go.”
Steve nodded again. Of course, he didn’t want to be a distraction. Hadn’t he promised earlier that he wouldn’t keep Tony from his letters?  He thought so. It wouldn’t be so difficult, just to touch himself. He could do that. He could be good while Tony worked.
It got to the point that doing something, anything at all, with the damn thing was enough of a victory over childish emotions that he found himself curled on the floor next to his bed, unscrewing the casing and pulling it apart to reveal the vacuum tubes, plug-in crystals, a capacitor and coils looped inside.  Immediately, he could tell that the batteries were corroded, and most of the other parts needed replacing or repairing.  The stuff was so outdated, ancient, really, that fixing it was probably a lost cause.  He tossed it aside, then shoved the pile of parts under his bed.  He had plenty of better things to do with his summer holiday than waste time on a relic.
