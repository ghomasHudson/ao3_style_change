"I was about to," Howard answered. He took off his glasses, rubbing at his eyes before he put them back on.
“A long-term enchantment, such as the one of which we are speaking, would require an enormous amount of energy to sustain, else it would wear off eventually. Certainly sooner than the many months the prince has been missing,” Thor tried to clarify. “Such spells are usually cast by the power of the sun, so that they falter or even fail at night, depending on the magnitude of the enchantment, before resuming at sunrise. If the man in this castle is indeed an impostor, he will have to have some sort of power source available, or else the spell is dropping and recharging at nighttime.”
Steve turned slowly to look at Tony, who was standing in the doorway in his nightgown and heavy red robe. He had clearly just awoken: his hair a fright and his eyes still a little bleary. Sam was already looking in his direction, somewhat aghast, and Natasha and Bucky had to turn slightly over their shoulders to see him.
Tony fidgeted, and Natasha sunk her fingertips more viciously into his shoulders in warning. “Come back with us,” she said, somewhere between a plea and a command.
“Was there I saw it, Highness. Looked like a battle’d been fought ‘pon the road. The trees were smokin’ even in the rain, Highness, burned like a been struck with lightnin’. Whole grove of ‘em missin’ on the edge of the ravine, Highness, I daren’t go no closer with the road in such state. Scuffed marks on the groun’, an’… looked like somethin’ big fell right o’er the cliff, Highness. I came’s fast as I could to tell ye. Somethin’ dangerous out in the royal forest this night, Highness.”
“A knight, someday,” Natasha corrected, gingerly reaching over to grasp Bucky’s hand where it was fisted on the tabletop. She looked at him sadly for a moment while he was too upset to look anywhere other than his bowl, then she sighed and turned to look over at Steve. “Tony is a prince, and he's kind, and intelligent, and it's a very good match. He loves me, and I love him, and it's not the same, but it's better than what most royals get. We both know that. You should be happy for us.”
Their shouts had drawn the attention of the hotel guests inside, and Nia saw her opportunity as all the wealthy and important men and women in their suits and ties, their dresses and uniforms, turned to see the commotion. She slammed herself into the window at full force. The glass didn't shatter, but cracked in fine spiderwebs in its frame, and she screamed for help.
Nia felt a wave of relief wash over her. “Thank them,” she said, gratefully. “Thank them for me.”  She smiled, wearily, at Ty, and pressed her face into his tee shirt. He put one arm around her, kissed the top of her head, and held out a beer.
The next year, Prince Tony was sent back to spend the summer with Princess Natasha at her beautiful hilltop castle. This arrangement pleased both children immensely, after the wonderful weeks they had spent joined at the hip when they first met.
Natasha greeted Tony upon their arrival with her customary crushing hug, as well as an effusive kiss upon the lips, which was new. She gave him a sly look and then glanced at Bucky, who flushed quite charmingly. Tony grinned at the pair of them, perfectly happy to serve as a go-between for inappropriate public displays of affection. If he were astonishingly lucky, he might even be invi— no, he cut off the thought as he always did, not willing to even fantasize about something so precious. Natasha and Bucky were a perfectly flawless couple, and they certainly did not need him interfering in their dynamic any more than he already did.
Bucky tightened his grip and cut off Stane’s air. The regent fell mercifully silent after a small retching noise, before he was quickly gagged. His eyes stayed on Steve, though, reveling in his hurt.
Years ago, months ago, even days ago, Nia would have jumped at the chance, if Howard had invited her to see him work, but today-- this morning-- after the previous night, it all seemed too sudden.
As they watched from the bank, Bucky and Tony held a series of contests on who was the better splasher, the better swimmer, the better hand-stander or the better breath-holder. A lot of those Tony won, but probably only because he was three whole years older than Bucky, Steve thought mulishly. It wasn’t really fair; he was cheating.
The room was impeccably clean: tile floor, as she’d guessed, and whitewashed walls. The wall to what had been her right-- now her left-- with all the little colored lights, was just that, a huge rack of machinery, with dials and sensors and gauges, all fed by the object in the center of the room.
Nia growled. “Did he come over here?” she asked. “We--”  She realized she couldn’t exactly tell her mother everything without admitting that she’d sneaked out of the house. “We had a fight yesterday. It’s fine; it’s over; we’re doing different things now, anyway.”
a scary monster.” Then she winked at Steve, who clearly had no idea how to react, and returned to tapping on her phone.
They ate supper together as a group in Natasha’s private dining room, and the long-suffering Lady Hill had long since given up on pretending there was any sense of propriety to the princess dining unsupervised, nightly, with a foreign prince, two squires, a falconer, and a mercenary who had once been sent to kill her.
Any remaining hope he had of engineering his own escape deflated in his chest, and he had to fight with everything he had not to give in to the despair.
His entire body went cold, then hot again in a great wave. He felt his face flush. “You're taking his side?”
The castle was his home and he knew it as well as anyone, so it was simple to slip out of his chambers in his stocking feet, down the hall and up one of the servants’ spiral staircases. The guards’ routines were equally as familiar to him, so he avoided them with ease and finally made his way un-accosted to the exact door he wanted. Any extra noise he made was swallowed by the sounds of the warm summer storm pouring rain outside, wailing against the stone walls and glass windows of the keep. The door he wanted opened easily under his hand in the split second gap between the guard’s patrol of this corridor and the next, and Steve was inside in another heartbeat.
The organ inside was vivid, red and blue and shining, and Nia watched it expand and contract, pumping away as if there were still blood passing through it.
Steve stared blankly at him for a few seconds, then cracked a grin. Okay, so Tony was almost incomprehensible with the teeth in, whatever, it made Steve smile. (Now
“Costume contest, of course,” Tony informed him, holding on even tighter to Steve’s waist and neck like a demented sloth. “You’ll definitely win Best Monster.”
Natasha went rigid for a split second before shoving Steve back and out of her way, reaching over to her would-be husband, and grabbing the chain around his neck just visible beneath his fine shirt. With no further ado, she dragged the heavy amulet up and over his head. Steve had one quick moment to notice that it was definitely not the same amulet as the one Thor had given Tony – and then the spell it had been enchanted with broke. The entire assembly of the great hall seemed to inhale as one, before the shouts of confusion and outrage began to ring out in instant riot.
She woke once, when the flight attendant came on the loudspeaker to warn them of turbulence, but Nia barely felt it. It was dark, then, nighttime in whatever part of the globe they were currently flying over. The darkness of the cabin made it feel smaller, more tightly wrapped around her, like a shell or a cocoon. She dozed right back off, and then next time she opened her eyes, the window shade beside her head glowed gold with morning light. She slowly pulled it up, and peered out the tiny porthole window. She could see snow-capped mountains beneath her-- craggier and darker than the ones she was used to at home-- and wispy cirrus clouds floating alongside the plane.
Tony laughed. “I can hardly believe that man was arguing for a cartouche at all,” he chortled. “How very primeval. A lozenge would be a far better choice for the arms of a lady of your stature, am I right?”
Her uniform was as clean and crisp as could be, and she sat up a little straighter, reaching for her blue cap. She always had imagined herself tall and elegant, with long legs and a tiny waist, looking just like the photographs in the pamphlets UNITY sent to all graduates. But she was still small, still had short legs and a pudgy belly in spite of her valiant attempt to do as many sit-ups as humanly possible. She felt like a child playing dress-up in someone else’s clothes.
Steve noticed, of course, and peered disapprovingly at him. “You haven’t been sleeping this week,” he said, in that voice that made Tony’s insides go all wriggly.
Tony’s hands bunched in the fabric of Steve’s jacket, his grip painfully tight and perfect. “Not your fault,
Littered along the drop were the bodies of horses and men, some intact but some splayed in obvious death upon the ground and the hefty, unforgiving trunks of the trees below. At the sight of it, a wave of nausea swept cruelly over Steve, and it was all he could do not to turn away in horror. For all he was in training to one day become a knight, he had not been exposed to death before. Not like this. Nothing like this.
He swallowed nervously and took her hand upon his own, and they both ignored his uncertainty. The prince brought her knuckles to his lips and kissed them obediently, then smiled down at her when he caught her softening expression.
The source of the blood became all too clear. Steve felt his knees give way briefly, but it was enough to send him crashing down into the mud.
, which he's certain would have been far more pleasing had it not ended up with him flat on his face in the sand with one of Natasha’s strong, trouser-clad thighs wrapped around his neck.
Tony stared at him, as if that were the first time someone had asked him to challenge one of his father’s opinions. It may well have been. There was another long silence before some energy suffused back into Tony’s body, like he was taking it directly from the flames at his back. “Notes. Nothing not already in my head.”
Yinsen smiled. “The last time I saw you, you were…”  He held a hand out, at waist-height. “Smaller than that. I always forget, you’re nearly the same age as my granddaughter.”
They stared each other down, but Steve supposed he at least owed it to Bucky to help keep Tony as far away from Natasha as they could, so he relented cheerlessly.
He hopes his smile doesn’t look as brittle as it feels as he obligingly ducks out of the bathroom, and hustles for the front door.
By this point, Tony had gone from sober to tipsy to almost-sober again, and most of the room was somewhere along that scale. They all congregated in the living room, filling it to capacity and spilling out into the kitchen and hall. Jan stood tall on one of the armchairs at the edge of the room, one foot on each of its arms and holding an enormous bag of candy on her hip.
The summer Tony did not visit, Steve discovered Peggy Carter, and forgot all about his love for Natasha.
“Six  point six two six oh seven oh oh four oh times ten to the negative thirty-fourth joules per second,” Nia answered.
He staunchly refused to think about the wedding night, pushing the thoughts back to the recesses of his mind whenever they reared their heads.
Sam would still be rooming with Steve until he became the official falconer of the castle and could move into the quarters by the mews, but for now they were all comfortable maintaining the current arrangement. (Well, Steve could currently think of a single rather compelling argument against it.)
Clint shook his head. “He simply vanished. We have received no ransom demand, no communication of any kind. We have scoured the mountain many times over. There is no trail, and no remnant of him whatsoever.”
It was inevitable that he would try to escape, and he had to factor in that Loki would surely know that. Tony tried to to admit it even to himself, but Loki’s words did not disappear as soon as he said them – rather they embedded themselves in Tony’s mind, and the niggling doubts accumulated.
“I requested you because you're not a surgeon,” Natasha told him perfunctorily. “Any fool can take a man’s arm off. I wish for far more care than that.”
She wasn’t sure what made her say it, but it was out of her mouth before she realized what she’d offered.
Loki had last been seen in the capitol, rotting in a prison cell beneath the city after his attempt to murder his father, the king, and his successful murder of his queen and mother. As far as all official reports were concerned, Loki was still imprisoned in Asgard – but Clint had found out on his last trip it was suspected that the wayward prince had in fact recently escaped his father’s and brother’s clutches, and disappeared into the wider realms.
Their closest neighbor across the central Sea of Midgard, the small kingdom of Menahahte, proved to be their greatest ally in the years following the plague; sending workers for shares of the produce and establishing promises of future trade. King Howard of Menahahte was known for his brilliance – but was often used as a cautionary tale against a dependence on machinery and invention. The pollution from his production mills and other such advancements had cost his kingdom much of its arable land, but Lord Fury was able to trade his plentiful food for King Howard’s expertise, elaborate gifts, and designs.
, but there was a freedom from expectations, when it came to interacting with strangers, that she relished the opportunity for.
to acknowledge your own foolishness,” he sneered. “Then nothing is stopping me from keeping you here by magical means. If, as you say, there is nothing I could do to you that would change your mind.”
They built a fort of branches and twigs in the woods (which the girls ruthlessly demolished the next day despite the boys’ best counterattacks, through a calculated and worryingly impressive military effort), they helped out in the kitchens for the joy of the treats the cooks lavished on them, they played in the stables and with the dogs, and they discovered every conceivable hiding place within the castle walls – including a certain nook in the battlements which hid Rhodey so well that he was very cold and
He squeezed her hand as they sat. She withdrew it, guiltily. They were surrounded by other students now, students who knew them both, students who’d spread gossip if anything was overheard.
But after all that, Tony didn’t so much as stir, and Steve’s control over himself slipped. He slid his hands under Tony’s torso and dragged the man up to cradle him against his chest, burying his face in the crook of his neck and his other hand in the thick mess of his hair. It had been a weak hope, but it had been a hope, and Steve desperately fought back tears, as the realization that this must truly be the the end of the man he believed was half of his heart began to sink in.
down his spine, and screams torn from his own throat as he collapsed from the cot onto the filthy stone floor. Through flashes of agony he saw that Loki had vanished along with his dreadful scepter, but that the door was wide open. With a shout of horror at the phantom sensation of his flesh sloughing from his bones, he lurched to his feet and staggered as fast as he could manage from the cell.
Steve, Bucky, and Clint all blinked at him in confusion, while Sam began covertly grinning into his napkin.
Slowly, though, she found herself sketching the prototype for the prosthetic heart her mother had been working on when she left, and then, she started filling in a figure around it--  a figure with a broad chest and narrow waist, a square jaw and straight nose....she did it absently, without thinking, and was startled when she looked down, and, in spite of the fact that she wasn’t the best portraitist, plainly recognized it as Steve, the prosthesis filling in the spot where his scar marked his chest.
He pushed open the door when his knock yielded an invitation to enter, and he quickly saw Tony sitting upon the wide windowsill with a book in his hands. “Good evening, Tony,” he greeted, walking over and folding his wrists behind his back. “What are you reading?”
Eventually, King Odin of Asgard lost his patience with Lord Fury, and demanded that Loki be returned to face Asgardian justice. With little in the way of alternate arguments or options, Lord Fury conceded, and Loki was shipped back once more to the realm he had fled. Nobody was pleased with this development, least of all Loki himself, who protested vehemently each step of the way to the ship – and presumably the entire journey over there as well. Thor vacillated for a long while over whether or not he should leave to escort his brother, though in the end he decided to stay in Natasha’s kingdom at least until the wedding, since he was the only person they knew with any understanding of magic to help with Loki’s notes.
Then, with scarcely a pause, he brushed something against Tony’s inner elbow. The bright pain it caused told him that it was a sharp blade, and his stomach dropped when he realized what the plan was.
it like a blinding light. The noise kept getting louder and louder, until there was no way it was just some electrical malfunction. Tony was half-paralyzed by the sound, and half by his own bewilderment. There was a buzzing in the air, across his scalp and his skin, like he’d skidded across a carpet and then shocked himself on a metal rail.
“Loki wants Nat’s kingdom,” Tony pointed out, turning in place to stand beside Bucky, facing the other three. “Very predictable. The fake me is unexpected, I’ll admit – I don’t think that was his plan to begin with.”
Carol brushed Nia’s hair out of her face and kissed her, softly, on the forehead. “You never have to see him after today, okay, love?”
“I should be glad, I suppose,” Thor continued after a moment of awkward silence, not sounding the least bit upset. “That you did not simply break into my palace and steal the information you desire.”
Nia looked to Howard. He was looking away, up at the trees, a sort of lost expression on his face, as if he were searching for something he couldn’t see. She watched him, over her shoulder, as she followed her mother inside.
He darted from the bedchamber with nobody attempting to stop him. It was only a short trip from Bucky’s room through the suite’s antechamber and into the room he and Sam still shared. He collapsed on his own bed and sunk his head into his hands, elbows tight against his knees, his back bowing from the strain of not bursting into tears.
They passed out of the poor area of the city, Nia feeling ill at ease as the dusty, crowded road gave way to a broad boulevard lined by emerald lawns and marble fountains.
But that first wedding night was nothing at all like Steve had expected. After the evening ceremony, the newlyweds had been escorted to the king’s chambers and promptly left to their own devices. As it turned out, Bucky and Natasha had—allegedly—been more adult and had more conversations about the issue of post-marital bedroom activities than
She and Natasha stared at each other for a few moments before nodding mutually: a chamberlain’s daughter and an heir to the throne, and Tony was very concerned about the pair of them reaching any sort of truce.
Nia shot a glare at Ty. “Of course,” she said. “Of course; I’m coming. Can you take me to him?” she added, hoping that the other girl’s company would keep Ty at bay.
Steve had to shake his head again, and he felt Sam’s hand clamp down on his shoulder in sympathy and support.
A great golden medallion gleamed in the center of his chest, likely some sort of royal trinket. It was the precise color of his hair, flashing in the sunlight like his curious eyes.
At that, the other boy—Steve—puffed up like an angry little sparrow. He turned his glare briefly on Bucky, who ignored it with what looked like long experience. Tony sensed that he was on thin ice for some reason, but wasn’t feeling too charitable towards the child who looked to have been mentally throwing rocks at him this entire time.
He slinks back into his apartment without another word, with the intent to simply crawl back into bed and lie there until the sun is actually in the sky. But this very reasonable plan is derailed half-way through execution by another loud knock on the door. Tony groans into the pillow and outright hopes, for the first time in his life, that an extremely hot man is not on the other side of the door waiting for him.
He came to Steve, and all they could do was stare at each other until Tony finally broke and held out his arms. And although Steve was taller than Tony now, able to just barely tuck the prince under his neck so that Tony’s nose pressed against the bone of his jaw, Steve felt like Tony surrounded him completely. Tony was safe, and kind, and an infinite challenge.
The robotic man behaved as if he hadn't heard her. “We will provide passage,” he said. “For you to come to an undisclosed location. One of our leaders is in need of medical assistance. You will give him the required aid, and we will release your daughter.”
Nia took the card, nodding, and read it over before sliding it into her pocket. “Thanks, Officer Knight.”
With a few close calls, Steve made it to the end of the vertical face and staggered forwards slightly as the ground began to even out. He steadied himself with a tree branch, feeling its charcoal surface brush off on his hand.
“Thank you, Jan!” Tony shouted, waving his hand with a flourish. “Now we must bid you adieu. I’m afraid my beast is the shy kind!”
Bucky snorted at him, then pulled him in abruptly so he could press his mouth to Tony’s cheek with affection and relief. “It’s… so good to see you, Tony. I was afraid I never would again.”
"Til the final reckoning," Jim had joked, when she'd confided this to him. "We're good, Nee. You know we’ll be friends even when me and Carol are in the air, right?”
She did as she was told, and he shone the light down her throat, then put his fingers to her pulse point and counted, bobbing his head along as he mouthed numbers silently.
He’s seen this particular neighbor before, but only ever in passing. Most of Tony’s time in the hall between their apartments is spent scurrying between his door and the building’s front entrance in varying states of panic. Not to mention the fact that the guy keeps horrendous hours—out of the apartment before Tony is conscious, as far as he can tell, and returning either long before or long after Tony does. Tony has only seen him a handful of times, and has always been given a polite smile to nod at as congenially as he can manage.
Nia growled. “Yeah,” she snapped, as she opened the door of the car and slammed it shut as loudly as she could. “Yeah, we
“Why are you being this way?” she spat at him, stalking near and glaring with all the force of her royal pedigree.
Steve twitched in his direction, then reconsidered. Then he decided that Tony could hit him if he really wanted to, but Steve wasn’t going to let anyone scare him away for any reason. He walked over, bent down, and grabbed a handful of pegs from the basket, holding them in his cupped hands so that Tony had easier access. Tony was staring at him again. And Steve gazed back, realizing that he was not really afraid that Tony would hit him, because Tony would never do something like that.
Tony looked as gorgeous as Steve remembered. Clint must have told him to shave off the beard entirely – it would certainly have looked strange to the guests were the prince to have grown a full beard and mustache in the space of an hour. He looked less gaunt and sickly than he had at the lake, perhaps after a good meal, and newly dressed in his old finery. He and Natasha had both chosen to wear red, their joint favorite color. Her dress was liberally trimmed with white lace, and her copper hair was coiled around her head beneath a short white veil. Tony’s silk shirt was red, the rest of his clothing black and tightly fitted, from the decorated leather overcoat to the fine leather boots.
Once he had captured both of Tony’s hands in his own, the guy pressed them against his chest in a sweet gesture that would have melted Tony in most other contexts. He sought out Tony’s gaze earnestly, then smiled at him once he had it.
“No,” Tony continued, sending dirty looks at a smiling Natasha. “In the story, a swan’s egg gets placed in a duck’s nest by accident, so when it hatches the mother duck and the other ducklings think it's just a very ugly duckling. But then it grows up and it turns out to be a swan.”
“Steve,” Bucky said abruptly. “Look.” Despite how keyed up he was, Steve did so immediately – looking to Bucky and then following his gaze out to the middle of the lake, where one lone swan was floating and staring directly at them.
Howard took a breath, and swallowed so loudly that she could hear it. “Because I did it,” he said. “I made the call.”
“Put that away,” Howard instructed. “Keep it on you; don’t let it out of your sight. It means ‘priceless.’”
Eventually, after Steve’s stomach had almost completely finished crumbling into ash, Tony spun around and stared at Steve like he had failed some secret test.
“Why?” Nia asked. She shivered, a chill running down her spine, and she reached up, grabbing at her hair, twisting it around her hand.
Nia threw the receiver across the room. When the cord extended too far, the phone came off the table, knocking a vase to the floor, where it shattered, smashing into tiny fragments of cream-white porcelain. Her shoulders heaved; she
Glee and a sort of vindictive thrill carried him back to his room. But as he lay in bed he found that sleep still would not find him. Something sick dragged at his belly, and a dawning sense of horror started to rise in him as the sun peeked over the horizon. He said nothing to Sam when they rose a little while later, nor to Bucky, but insisted that he accompany Sam to the mews that morning after their breakfast. Sam—who knew that Steve pretty much hated birds, with their sharp little feet and loud squawking—was duly suspicious, as Steve usually found any excuse not to be anywhere near them, but did not refuse the offer of assistance.
Natasha reached the pinnacle of her ability to stay quiet about the situation one evening where they had all come together in the drawing room. Tony was not in the mood to play the harpsichord, but Clint could play a mean lute and was serenading them all with increasingly bawdy and hilarious drinking songs, egged on by Bucky and Sam. Natasha did not involve herself, but was obviously enjoying it as much as the rest of them.
“There was a mix-up with the cars,” Yinsen answered, shrugging. “I drew the short straw.”  He chuckled, and shook Howard’s hand. “And this is Antonia?” he asked, looking Nia over.
She wasn’t seeing this; she couldn’t be seeing this. It wasn’t possible; it wasn’t possible for her to still be alive if--
Miss Carter was the daughter of the castle steward, but everyone knew she had more to do with the running of the castle than anyone else. She was very smart, and very beautiful, and Steve was hopelessly in love from the first time he laid eyes on her. She was a little older than him, but he did not care about that. He was in love, and a trifle like the twelve year age difference was not going to keep him from her side.
Nia blinked. She looked back at Steve, still and serene in his encasement, and bit her lip. “You tried kissing him?” she asked dryly.
Steve, Tony, and Bucky would soar over the grassy hills together, and Steve considered himself a brave man, but even
She got into the backseat of the car, Howard’s fancy State car with the UNITY emblem emblazoned on the sides. She thought it was a little ostentatious for graduation, but it was just the sort of thing Howard would do. Jarvis greeted her warmly and told her that she looked very grown-up, and she felt a lump at the back of her throat, and murmured thank you.
“A final gift from my mother, young Prince,” Thor said somberly, quietly: as though the words were just for Tony, and touching his fingertips to Tony’s cheek affectionately.
, now, as if going to a new place would give her a new chance. The Northeastern Territories were far-- twelve hours on a plane-- and she’d only seen them in books, and on television. She wouldn’t see anyone she knew-- except for some of the people Howard worked with. Sure, people would know
Anthony is your betrothed, Princess. Your kingdom is no small prize. Men have killed far more attempting to control far less than your lands.”
“He hasn’t woken up,” Bucky pointed out into the following pause. “Whatever you did, can you do more of it?”
Not when Loki told him that in the wake of Tony’s disappearance, Natasha had quickly married herself off to Loki’s brother Thor, crown prince of Asgard: a far superior match.
His sole consolation in this matter was that Bucky, Sam, and Clint were trapped in similar vestments, so that they all looked almost like a matching set if they stood side-by-side. But unlike Steve, Bucky wore all black and gray, Sam preferred white and burgundy, and Clint was looking unquestionably spectacular in royal purple (which Natasha had deemed appropriate for the ex-mercenary, over Lord Fury’s strenuous objections).
“Are you proud of yourself?” Tony asked him, smiling up to where Steve was gazing down at him thoughtfully.
The first wisps of early morning light were just visible over the trees as Nia made her way, groggily, up to bed, and flopped down on top of her sheets.
Footsteps sounded in the hall. "That'll be your mother," Howard said, not sounding as if he relished the thought.
“Not when we weren’t sure we could save him,” said Howard. “It would have crippled her. Can you imagine? If she’d come every day down here to visit him? If she hadn’t been able to move on with her life?”
The ugly noise that came from his friend’s throat was one of the most wonderful things Steve had ever heard.
“Next time, call us first?” said the Peace Officer. “Legally, they can take your photo, but if they’re
“There’ll be time,” Ty urged, and he unbuttoned his own trousers when she made no move to. He snatched up her hand with his free one, slid it down the front of his pants.
“Howard said cocktail dresses,” Nia said, holding her hands up, empty. “I don’t have cocktail dresses.”
. Tony’s eyes fly wide as soon as the sentence is finished, mirrored immediately by the baby blues opposite him. Whatever proto-teenage hormones have kept Tony frozen in place from the moment he opened his door to find this Adonis until now… they dissipate all at once with a shock of embarrassment. He slaps a hand unthinkingly over his eyes and ends up slamming his glasses—
He fell silent instantly when Natasha’s elbow caught the side of his head. He slumped in Thor’s arms, and the prince picked his limp body up only long enough to carry him off the platform and drop him on the first row pew.
Howard was silent for a moment, brow furrowed, and he opened his mouth once, twice, a third time, shutting it again and again, as if he were thinking and rethinking what to say.
. Tony had pointed out that it wasn’t like you could see Steve’s… bits, what with the thick coating of hair, but Steve would not be swayed. Tony had managed to prevent him from wearing a shirt, not least because carding his fingers over Steve’s magnificently tufted chest was one of Tony’s new favorite anxiety-reducers.
For a guy who had (from what Tony had been able to glean) been cooped up inside that building for at least few years,
“You must be!” Tony snapped, giving Steve a look of disgust. “Why else—” He cut himself off abruptly, before putting his hands on his hips and fixing Steve with a deeply unnerving stare. “That is sad, Rogers. Falling for a
But on the other hand… Steve did not want Tony to marry anyone, even Natasha. He supposed this feeling was irrational, since he was fairly certain he had spent most of his childhood loathing Tony. But when he expressed this feeling to the others, Sam gave him a pitying look, Bucky gave him a thwap on the head and told him not to be an idiot, and Natasha just flew into another rant. He was not, to be honest, entirely sure what to make of all this.
Natasha was simple – they would be married, they would produce at least one heir, and hope that the child looked sufficiently like Tony that they would never have an issue with nosy and traitorous would-be usurpers. He loved her, and she loved him, and that would be that. It was not at all unheard-of for married people to take extramarital lovers, not even for royalty. Perhaps especially for royalty. He and Natasha were definitely the exception for royal marriages, since not only did they already knew each other, but they already liked each other greatly.
Then Tony’s face settled into a cool mask, the one he tended to wear around Lord Fury and Lady Hill, and he nodded coolly at Steve. “I'm glad. Excuse me.”
And Tony – Steve loved every look of Tony’s from dirty blacksmith to carefree noble horseman, but he could admit to himself that Tony in his princely finery was
They arrived at the old castle early the next evening, after just a few brief stops to allow the horses a rest and for them to eat a small meal or two. They rode right up to the edifice this time, perhaps foolishly, but even Natasha’s protests fell short compared to the desperation to find their friend.
Tony closed his eyes and pressed his cheek against the rattling frame of the carriage window. The rolling mountains and steep drops were beginning to give way to the hills, after which there was one tall hill to climb, upon which Natasha’s southern castle was perched. The now-familiar feeling of roiling excitement was building in him as they approached the castle. When he finally succumbed to the urge to stick his head out of the latched window, he saw all his friends gathered there outside the gates. He was too familiar a fixture around the castle by now for Lord Fury to bother greeting him personally, but that did not bother Tony in the slightest.
“Only one neighbor I want to impress,” Steve retorts, smiling cheerfully and guilelessly over the table at Tony.
Dozens of folktales shot through Steve’s mind at the words, stories of love’s true kiss solving every ailment from melancholy to evil spells to death itself. And it may have been a little absurd, but by this point Steve was past caring. He would gladly do anything to save Tony’s life.
Tony tried admirably to coax Steve into something resembling a dance, and Steve concentrated on the lines of Tony’s body as he moved and suggested how Steve should be moving – and after a little while, some missteps, and a great deal of trial and error, they actually managed to create a passable dance between them.
The musicians were playing Natasha’s favorite song, one that Tony had played on the harpsichord for her and Bucky to dance to many times, and Steve couldn’t help elbowing Bucky in the side with a grin. Bucky grumbled but couldn’t quite hold back a playful grin. They both perked up when, with a swell of the music, Natasha entered through her set of doors with Lord Fury at her side, and at the same time Tony entered through his with Lord Stane.
“It is of little consequence,” the man said, as though they were not literally discussing Tony’s life and his death. “I know of your Steven Rogers. I watched you, Stark. It is a shame he was not present upon the mountain, for me to strike him down in this terrible accident. I suppose his dear friend Barnes will have to suffice.”
“Hello, Steve,” Tony said tightly. Then, “Hello, Sam,” he beamed in Sam’s direction, which made Steve scowl even more.
And with that he gathered up the bloody amulet, twisted the knife around once in Tony’s chest, obviously relishing the pained cry Tony let out, and swept out of the inner storeroom door. Tony heard the key turn in it from the other side, then looked over at the other door. It was locked but only latched – if he could only get over there—
When Tony drew back, he gave Steve a bit of a watery smile. “I will see you next summer.” Steve swallowed and nodded, and Tony’s smile grew a little less sad. “Your eyelashes are wet.”
Nia was trembling, now; she ground her teeth into her lip. “I don’t have to listen to this,” she said quietly.
“Well,” she said bitterly. “If they wanted to entice me, the least they could do is show up to my graduation.”
And yet the situation was even worse than that, because it was not that Tony wished to take male lovers, which could perhaps have been excused, but that he wished to take one specific male lover. Sexual relations with other men had certain times and places in which they could be easily ignored, especially in times of conflict, or where the partner in question was a lowly stable worker or some other such position. Though Tony did not actually care about such social distinctions, he was still very much aware of them and their uses.
Thor roared like he might actually happily tear Stane’s head from his neck, while Natasha ordered him to be arrested even through Stane’s virulent protestations. Pepper sprinted for the doors, followed hotly by Sam.
, and Bucky felt the need to scold Steve blazingly for not talking to Tony before tying himself into knots of panic about it. He promised to also go yell at Tony later, in the interest of fairness.
Steve and Bucky went through their day amiably enough, and Bucky was deliberately not talking about Tony, Steve knew. They shoveled out the stables and ran through their various other chores as assigned, but as companions to the princess their work days ended promptly at midday. They ate lunch together down by the creek in the woods rather than partaking in the communal meal in the great hall, chomping their way through the delicious bread, crumbly cheese, and fresh fruit one of the cooks had sliced up for them.
She winced, and stepped back. “Gross,” she said, feeling suddenly guilty. “I’m sorry, Steve. Especially with you, uh--I’m not looking at your junk; I promise I’m not looking at your junk…”  She put a hand up to shield her peripheral vision. “Sorry. Okay. Like, if you’re even remotely conscious even with your synapses all fucked up like that, and you remember any of this, I am so, so sorry.”
Steve sighed, keeping his eyes closed even though the phantom of Tony behind him had dissipated. “He's a prince, Sam.”
She didn’t know if Ty was following; she didn’t look back, just kept her eyes on that unmistakeable patch of copper, so intently that she almost smacked into a person.
They were dead, now, but Nia had been unsettled by their smiling faces. They had looked like ordinary, happy people, not traitors or terrorists.
This was wrong, something was wrong. He looked across the aisle at Pepper, who looked back at him strangely. She’d already told them that she had assurances from Lord Stane that the impostor would be detained long enough for Tony to change places with him, and before the ceremony Clint had gone to make certain. Surely Clint would not have failed. He would never allow the impostor in here without even attempting to warn them. Not unless… unless something had happened to him.
Tony took to Clint like a falcon to the air, and was calling him ‘Hawkeye’ with poorly-disguised glee after their first afternoon practicing archery out on the training fields. Tony was no mean shot himself, but he was outstripped by Natasha and Bucky by a fair margin, and Sam by a slight one. Clint, however, was in a whole different realm from the rest of them. He was secretive about his past, but Steve got a good feeling about the man – mostly since he had snuck into the palace in the dead of night several months before, risking life, limb, and more, to warn Natasha that one of the feuding Asgardian houses had recently put a bounty on her head.
With a strangled yelp, Tony jumped away from whatever he was now hugging—Steve or otherwise—and raised both hands in front of himself defensively.
The day went by at a loathsome crawl for Steve, and after his discussion with Pepper he decided he could not stand to be in Tony’s company for one more moment not knowing what was wrong with him. He was also willing to admit, if only in the privacy of his own mind, that he had been hurt deeply by Tony’s rejection the day before, and felt echoes of that pain every time even the mere thought of Tony came up. So he trained with the other knights as usual, though with the noteworthy (and somewhat humbling) addition of Thor, and then the two of them lunched with Sam as they always did upon the fields. Though the foreign prince sat and heartily enjoyed the small meal with them, today Bucky did not join in as he was normally wont to do.
She didn’t have an opportunity to find out more, as they were let off at their floor, on a balcony that overlooked the lobby. From this height, everything below sparkled in the sun. Nia felt her breath leave her chest, and stepped to the railing, entranced, leaning over as far as she dared. Something in her, a tickle in her shoulders, made her want to spread her arms and leap, as if there were a vestige of some ancient avian ancestor that had been slumbering quietly inside her, wakened by the opportunity to fly. She caught herself leaning further, and stepped back, breaking the spell.
– Steve’s spine twinged and his knees faltered. Tony caught him quickly, keeping him upright long enough for Steve to find his feet and surge forwards.
“And you, Steve,” Tony replied coolly, swallowing back a litany of increasingly pathetic questions. “If you will excuse me, Nat, I'm not hungry.”
Aunt Peggy scooped her up in both arms and whirled her around like she was still a child who weighed nothing. At least, Nia thought, at least even if neither of her parents showed,
Here, the outer walls of the house were lined by thick bushes; there was nowhere to easily lean. She sank, weak-kneed, to the grass, crawled beneath the nearest bush, and shut her eyes. the twigs and leaves of the surrounding shrubbery pricking at her uncomfortably, scratching at her arms. She felt herself start to drowse.
“No, no, my boy,” Obadiah scolded almost kindly, batting Tony’s hand away. “I wouldn’t do that. If you take that dagger out you’ll have nothing plugging the hole it’s made in your heart.”
Everyone was given an assignment that seemed to suit them, and no one looked displeased. Of course, this was an elite Academy and Nia had heard that at the less prestigious schools, students didn't always expect assignments they would enjoy. There were people assigned to menial jobs, people assigned to infantry, whose lives were at much greater risk than the young officers graduating into the military from the Academy. But that didn't happen here. The Academy was made up of the best and the brightest, the smartest and most ambitious, and, of course, the most wealthy.
He did not understand where he was running until he all but tripped over a thick growth of cattails, and stumbled blindly through them into an icy body of water.
In the middle of this nest reclined Tony and Natasha, wearing very little clothing between them. Steve’s throat went dry at the sight of almost all of Natasha’s cream-colored, glowing skin before him, displayed through a robe that must have been Tony’s. It was only tentatively tied at her tiny waist and showed the entire expanse of her legs, and almost the entirety of her chest. The pink paleness of her skin was especially pronounced as she lay displayed beside Tony with his olive tan, much of which was visible as he was clad only in his cream breeches. His knees were curled up against his chest, one being used by Natasha as a backrest, and the other as his own writing surface as he scribbled in his omnipresent notebook.
“Can he do that?” Steve asked, feeling like his brain was no more than a cloud, floating pleasantly inside his head.
She decided five minutes couldn’t hurt. She curled up, resting her cheek on her arm, her bare elbow in the dirt.
decided that a certain amount of torture removed his ability to possess genuine free will, but Loki was not shying away from psychological torture, at least.
The ceremony continued around them, the rest of the graduates marching down the stairs just in front of them, and a few moments later, it was over, and they were playing the recessional march.
She forced her eyelids open and came face to face with a yellow sheet, cutting off her view from the rest of her body. The rest of the room was blurry-- she saw a man-shaped figure which she suspected must be Doctor Yinsen, but not much else.
“Nooo, come on, we can’t go now,” Tony retorted, ignoring the fact that he’d just been thinking more or less the same thing.
Nia got up, and then looked to Howard, still sitting in his chair, slumping, looking down at the floor, his expression drawn.
Loki wanted his blood. For what purpose Tony could not say, but it hardly took a genius of his caliber to deduce that whatever Loki wanted his blood for would not be beneficial to anybody but the traitor himself. So he refused. Time and again, Tony refused.
She remembered watching the graduates before her walk every year, in their rows of smart uniforms up to the podium to get their certificates and their assignments, patriotic marches piping triumphantly through the sound system. Every year, as her own graduation grew closer, it felt more real, more nerve-racking, and every year, her own vision of herself crystallized more clearly, from the time she had been a small child and the idea of graduation was something so very far-off and grown-up, when the graduates had seemed so old, so sophisticated, so tall. Now...she still felt like a child, scared and tentative, like it was too soon, too soon to be going out into the world, too soon to know what she was going to be when she grew up.
Then he drew back, and made a loud squawking noise. “Are you Steve or are you the man that ate Steve?”
Thor and Clint switched places so that Clint was up keeping a look out with Sam, while Thor was down in the dungeon using his mighty warhammer to break apart Tony’s chains. The welded shackle would have to wait until they were in the village or, preferably, home in Kingstown, but that would be up to Tony whether he wanted it off now or after he got home.
Tony recovered from his surprise first, grinning for the whooping crowd and holding out two hands to catch the chocolates Jan threw their way. He caught one without a fuss, but the other smacked Steve right on the nose—although Steve already kind of looked like he’d taken a frying pan to the face, and the little projectile actually seemed to snap him out of it.
“Spider,” Tony repeats, remembering vaguely what the guy had started babbling about as soon as Tony had opened the door. At the time he’d been occupied with blinking blearily at what he could only assume was a vivid, exhaustion-provoked hallucination of an Actual Angel descended before him. “In your bathtub.”
“Just be careful until we’re at the conference,” Howard replied. “The hotel’s a different story, it’s more civilized. But out in the city…”
“If you wish it, I will not attempt to convince you to stay,” the prince agreed. “I ask only that you wait for me to gather my possessions.”
“Not yet,” Howard answered, shaking his head. He got up from the bed, walked to the little desk in the corner of the room, and picked up a folder, which he handed to her  “But that’s the trick of the antonium. It fuses cool, Nia. It
“He’ll kill me!” Hammer whimpered, at which point Steve could no longer hold back a noise of anger, like a feral growl in the back of his throat.
And Tony – well, Steve did not know what would happen with Tony. He could hardly stand to think on the matter.
There had been different flags, different uniforms, not an entire planet of people dressed in the same blue.
His only comfort these days was that he now at least knew what the Asgardian wanted with him, why he had gone to such lengths and caused such loss of life. The trouble was that the knowledge did not actually help him at all.
He’d known there were secret passages all throughout the castle, but he’d never have guessed Natasha’s female ancestors would have been using them to… to—
Tony gaped at him. “For a political alliance, Steve. You know I love Nat dearly, but I don’t desire her as my
Natasha looked to him piercingly, taking her seat as well and indicating that the others do the same. “Thor?” she prodded, as Sam darted over to shut and bolt the door to the dining room. “Is that possible?”
Nia had put her hair in a high ponytail under her cap, and she followed behind her father with a little suitcase that rolled behind her on shiny wheel, and made a satisfying clicking noise every time she ran it over the tiles in the floor.
Steve dug his scrawny arm deeper into the great big pot and scrubbed more viciously. He hated Prince Tony more with every passing year, and it only made it worse that Bucky seemed to actually like the other boy now. If it were anyone other than Bucky, Steve would have called them a traitor and never spoken to them again.
It was a blessing, at least, that Bucky had been unconscious for all of this and not dragged in to defend himself against the ridiculous accusations.
That suited his purposes just fine, so he allowed it to pass despite Natasha and Pepper’s increasingly disapproving looks towards them both, over the months of their visit.
“You believe then that Loki is keeping Tony prisoner,” Natasha clarified, to which Thor nodded. “Do you know where they may be?”
She explained succinctly how they deduced that someone had warned Loki of their arrival, and Bucky’s face turned thunderous. “Who would dare?” he snapped.
in the misguided belief that it would simply right itself? He should have listened to Pepper – she was rational, she was smart, and she was by no means prone to spurious accusations and wild theorizing. If she said there was something wrong with Tony, he should have believed her. And no matter how much Steve loved Tony, Pepper had simply known him longer, probably even known him better, and, and… how could they have been so foolish?
“I want you to memorize those diagrams,” Howard replied. “And then destroy them. We’re not ready for this, not now. I’ll tell them there’s been a setback in my research, that something was missing.”
"What do you want?" Nia asked. She recognized the motto, recognized it from history books about Hydra and the Last War, but she couldn't quite bring herself to believe that anyone would align themselves with a group borne of genocidal ideologies.
“Obie’s harmless,” Howard said, waving away Yinsen’s remarks with a hand. “He’s been working for me since he was a kid. He’s just overeager; that’s all. He wants to be a hero. He’ll listen to sense.”
She stalked over and poked one porcelain finger into the middle of his chest, quite painfully. “You should be ashamed of yourself.”
With a reassuring tap on Tony’s shoulder, he reached into Tony’s shirt and pulled out the amulet, admiring its craftsmanship for a little while before lifting Tony’s arm to hover over his own chest. Tony tried to fight, but the blood loss not only from his elbow but also what was almost certainly leaking from the wound in his chest was leaving his head feathery and his limbs weak.
A few minutes later, Tony had in fact managed to leave the condo with monster reluctantly in tow. Granted, Steve was being extra shifty and trying to Pink-Panther his way out of the building, plastering his back against the walls and peering around corners. Tony beamed at him while he strode on down the hall and into the elevator, then from the elevator to the front door. They miraculously didn’t run into anybody until they were already out of the building, which was convenient, because Tony was pretty sure Steve would have done an immediate 180 otherwise.
He has no artifice in him—not a speck that Tony can detect. Not about his interest in Tony. He’s just so unlike any of the other people Tony normally finds himself in these situations with. He’s seen Tony at his most caveman-like phases of the morning and evening at least once a week for almost a year, when grunts in recognition of pleasant greetings are the best he can dredge up. And somehow, in all that grunting, Steve saw something in Tony that he liked well enough to engineer probably the most ridiculous, spectacularly unromantic meeting between them as humanly possible. And he admits to it with no shame—only open glee that his terrible tactics have worked.
Natasha was a woman so effortlessly beautiful that she could have—and had often—worn breeches and a loose linen shirt and been the most spectacular sight in the room. Dressed up as finely as she was in a black velvet gown trimmed with red, with long red under-sleeves tight down to her wrists, a wide golden belt hanging in front almost to the floor, and her bright copper hair swept up in a glimmering gold diadem and dripping tendrils upon her wide neckline, she was radiant. She appeared every bit the queen she would soon become.
There was really very little she would have put past them if she thought about it. The only reason she was certain she wasn't adopted was because Maria had taught her about the human genome by comparing their DNA, showing her the photographs of bright spots on dark agar, the places where Nia's genetics matched Maria's, and where they matched Howard's. But there weren't too many other secrets that either of them could be keeping.
And then Steve blinked, and looked up at her, and her heart began to hum in her chest, and she squeezed him in her joy, tightly, like a child with a stuffed toy.
But this time a figure, dressed in a blue UNITY uniform, plunged into the sea beside her, hard and fast, from an impossible height, and sank like a stone.
The emotion that burst open in Steve at the sight of it was one he could hardly put a name to. He gaped at Tony, then at Bucky, then at Natasha, and back to Tony. His heart beat with something like lust, something like excitement, and something very much like relief.
,” she groaned, and sat down on her mother’s sofa, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I hate him; I hate him--”
Tony shrunk into himself a little, ashamed. Steve was right; he should have known. He should have asked. Why else would Steve be living at the castle? Bucky was probably an orphan too. Like Natasha. Tony was so stupid – he should have known that. He forgot sometimes that not everybody had a mother like him, and now he’d upset Steve.
Lord Stane stood tall, his arms folded in a stately manner. “Lord Fury, please. Be reasonable. Surely you cannot believe such a ludicrous claim from this man?”
She ran a finger around the hermetic seal between the table where Steve lay and the enclosing box itself. “Where’s the…ah!”
Slowly, Tony lifted one hand from the cushion, dropping his weight onto his remaining elbow and his knee, which was now pressing firmly into the inside of Steve’s thigh. Steve’s breath hitched at the feeling of it, the flash of desire over the constant pulse in his stomach, and lower. Tony’s hand was both smooth and rough with callouses where it touched his face, feathering over his cheek, then his lips, and Steve wanted to reach out and lick the tip of his thumb as it passed by, but was not sure if that was proper.
The speeches seemed interminable, but eventually the Dean of the Academy stood, the stack of Assignments all neatly stacked beside her. The first row of students stood and walked to the stage, and Nia could feel her heart skipping a beat. It was too close, too soon, she hadn’t made a choice; what if they assigned her to something
“Steve,” Tony said his name warmly, with no indication of noticing the sharp downward turn Steve’s thoughts had taken.
Steve looked incredulously at Thor, who pretty much shrugged helplessly at him. “I am no expert. But it is possible that a love bond stronger than the spell bond could sever it. Spells must be verbalized too, as words created have far more power than words within our minds.”
Something jabbed at her chest, and she sucked in a breath, pressing a hand to her head. “Fuck you, Steve,” she said. “Sorry, It’s not your fault, but fuck you. I just...you’re one more stupid thing, you know? And you’re gonna be their priority until they wake you up.”
“Nat showed me,” Bucky retorted far too loudly, shrugging. He grinned back at Steve as he opened the heavy door and proved it to be unlocked. “It’s always good to be prepared, Stevie.”
They ended up with Tony, exhausted from his journey across the sea, falling asleep on Bucky’s well-muscled shoulder – which Bucky took quite gamely. Tony just
Nobody said anything for a few seconds. Something curled in Steve’s stomach; a feeling like he had forgotten something very important.
“I shall take your bet,” she said to Bucky imperiously, while Steve tried to figure out what exactly to begin protesting first.
She straightened up, trying to look brave, and listened for the names she recognized. Sunset, from her robotics class, was assigned to, well, Robotics. Carol!  Carol waved to the audience as she walked across the stage, sauntering gracefully like a fashion model. She punched the air when she was assigned to the Air Force. Jane Foster was assigned to astrophysics, which was a bit of surprise since Nia was fairly sure she’d never seen Jane actually attend any of her science classes.
he’s just the weirdo neighbor in an ancient sweatshirt and ridiculous slippers, and god, he’d forgotten how much he hates it when people’s disappointment finally appears. When they notice that he’s actually just a dull, dorky man not at all as advertised by the magazines, and not something they’re ever likely to come back to. It’s so much easier to just duck out before it gets to that point.
Tony paused, and Steve hoped desperately that Tony would not make him repeat himself. The force of the hope was so overwhelming, he felt a little lightheaded with it.
It was at that moment that Thor seemed satisfied with his cleaning, and promptly pulled the amulet over the swan’s neck. Tony’s body jolted immediately, and Steve lunged forward to lay a calming hand on his stomach. But as the transformation began, Thor pushed Steve’s hand away insistently.
Bucky’s mouth slowly broke into a grin as Tony rambled, and Steve realized it was the first real smile he’d seen on his friend’s face since he’d woken up after the accident. “I don’t know about a crossbow, but I’ll take as many daggers as you can squeeze in.”
With a sinking feeling, Tony realized that the magic-wielder was probably more than capable of doing so.
“Steve?” Tony had noticed, now, since Steve had all but frozen in place, staring at Tony’s huge, beautiful brown eyes, like Peggy’s, and supposed he had a certain set of preferences that were constant for both women and men, at least, that certainly lent a sort of poetic symmetry to the entire affair, and it may have been that his thoughts were starting to descend into the hysterical…
,” he spat the name. “Failed you. Did he tell you he made a vow of everlasting love to Hammer? That should have cemented the body transformation spell, according to that sorcerer’s notes. Magic,” he scoffed. “It didn’t work, of course. I guess the sorcerer didn’t care to mention that intent was as important as the words themselves. He meant it for you. Well, it was a nice thought.”
As though it understood, the swan’s head fell slightly and it began to drift back from the shore. It stared at Clint for a long time, letting out an oddly mournful noise, its wings drooping as the fight evidently left it, and eventually it turned and swam out into the middle of the lake, then round the bend where it was hidden by the rushes. Steve watched it go curiously, wondering what Clint could possibly have done to anger it so, before rounding the corner and jogging to catch up with his friend.
Nia sat in front of the mirror in her bedroom, fully dressed, hands on her knees, her heart thrumming in her chest like wingbeats. She tapped her foot nervously, looking herself over.
As the visiting royals were about to be escorted to their guest rooms, the princess surprised everyone but her guardian, Lord Fury, and her nursemaid and personal guard, Lady Hill—who were already well aware of her independent streak—by stepping carefully down the tall steps of the dais and approaching Prince Anthony. The prince appeared cowed as she stalked towards him, though he was almost twice her age and very nearly twice her height. He refrained from hiding behind his mother’s voluminous skirts, despite twitching helplessly in her direction.
Nia realized that she may have been better off wording it some other way when both of her parents began snickering, and she felt her face go hot. “You know what I mean,” she grumbled.
“Hi,” Nia said. “I, uh...you know who I am.”  She shook Nancy’s hand, and watched Nancy tilt her head, consideringly. She noticed Nancy’s eyes, then, a startling green.
“Of course I’m here,” Obie said, looking somewhat amused. “What happened, UNITY couldn’t figure out what to do with you, so your father put your to work?” he asked, though he gave Howard a sidelong glance and Nia wondered how much Obie suspected. He had to think
“It’s what’s keeping me upright,” Tony joked, not sure how much the others had told him and not willing to waste time explaining everything right now. “I hope you brought a change of clothes,” he said, shaking Obadiah’s hand away and looking around the small, dim storeroom. “I doubt Lady Hill would allow me to live very long if I tried to marry her princess wearing this.”
And now Howard’s gaze finally met hers--  her own vision was blurred by tears, and she was squinting at him, but she could tell his eyes were on her.
participation of the other person – the mind is a thing magic struggles to touch, no matter the power of the wielder.”
Natasha’s lips pressed into a thin line, while Clint was puffing up with anger and indignation at her side. After a moment, she cocked her head at Thor. “And yet he has asked no concessions of me. Why this extended silence?”
He wondered momentarily if he were back inside Natasha’s castle, but dismissed the thought after taking a deep, questioning sniff of the air and finding the distinct scent of mildew, feces, and stale hay. It smelled more like a barn or a particularly revolting cell, perhaps even a cellar or dungeon, and he was fairly confident he had done nothing worthy of Natasha’s imprisonment or even ire between being thrown off a cliff and waking up in this disgusting place.
Tony took him up on it eagerly, shucking his fancy jacket and shirt and splashing into the water like a dancing fool. Even Natasha removed her stiff kirtle and sat next to Steve in her floaty white chemise, dipping her feet in the water and shivering at the chill.
The only thing they hadn’t done was kiss, and not for a lack of trying on Tony’s part. So sue him; Steve might not be human (although he sure got shifty about the topic when Tony brought it up, so who knows?) but he was incredibly smart, snarky, and sweet. He was suave sometimes and utterly hopeless at others, and generally very much Tony’s Type™. At this point, he was moving swiftly past concerns about the whole fur-fangs-horns thing, and getting well into ‘love is blind’ territory.
Pepper nodded amiably, then rose to her feet. Steve, Thor, Sam, and Clint rose with her, and Tony stumbled up a moment too late. “Goodnight,” Pepper said to the other four men as a whole, then turned to Tony. “Will that be all, Prince Stark?”
“Thank the stars for that,” Bucky retorted gruffly before pulling back and looking up at Steve. “If he can’t leave the lake, we’re going to have to rethink our strategy.”
Without another word, Tony spun on his toe and exited the room, leaving Steve standing alone with the flames, feeling alone and ill and unaccountably uneasy.
—got married, and a few weeks later they were officially crowned the monarchs of their respective and joint kingdoms. Steve was in the front row for both ceremonies, naturally, cheering wildly and beaming with pride for his king and his queen. The day after the first wedding, they held a second ceremony – this one small, and quiet, and impossibly sweet. In front of a beaming audience of their friends, Tony said a second set of vows, then refused to let go of Steve’s hands while Steve echoed them back to him through the irrepressible smile on his face.
Before he could start to panic again, Tony companionably shoved his shoulder against Steve’s side. This caused him to let out a little “oof” and glare down at him, but Tony shrugged unapologetically. “No time like the present, Steve-o,” he asserted, reapplying his fangs before grabbing Steve’s elbow and using his surprise to drag him down the couple of steps outside the building.
To her relief, Thor nodded somberly. “Loki is not the son of my father and mother by blood, but we were raised as siblings. His betrayal has opened a wound upon my heart I fear may never heal.”
“Lord Fury,” the little princess said without turning around and without taking her hand back from the prince. “I will show Tony to his room.”
That Tony had been through a terrible experience. That he needed time to process what had happened to him. That all they needed was time, just time.
“Tony!” Jan shouted again when they were closer, eyes widening when she saw Steve. “Oh my god, who’s your ride?”
to your father,” Maria said, and there was real rage in her voice, in the way her eyes shone. “Sit. Down.”
“Whoever he has enchanted to look like Tony,” Natasha cut in. “Is likely then a reserve plan, should Tony refuse to give the blood freely. Were we to marry, I was probably not intended to survive long after the wedding. Loki clearly believes the impostor is firmly under his control.”
She read about the Last War, about the Nazis, about how the Allies decided that they had to keep such a terrible evil from surfacing again. She read about how, thanks to Captain America, the Allies had captured weapons from the shadow organization called Hydra, how they’d convinced the rest of the world to form the global UNITY state, how UNITY had been structured to include UNITY and its territories, the old Allied nations given privileged status for keeping the Nazis from their reign of terror.
Thor accepted this, and indicated for them to follow him as they retreated back through the palace towards the entrance.
“It can't remain that way,” Steve repeated, looking uncomfortable. “I am to be a knight. There are certain relations that can be… that can have their place, but you're – difficult.”
Nia shrieked. She couldn’t help it; she didn’t plan to do it; the high-pitched, anguished noise escaped from her throat, shrill and harsh and awful.
“Shh! Okay!” Jan chirruped, waving around a Milky Way. “For most accurate costume… Shuri, as a kinda scary-functional Inspector Gadget!”
Loki snarled, tightening his grip and cutting Tony off with an involuntary yelp. “I would tear your beloved Steven’s head from his shoulders if it would still permit you to agree freely, you insolent child. Take heart that this, and only this, is what will prevent me from slowly and agonizingly killing each and every person you care about to enforce your compliance.”
Nia shut the folder, slid it inside her notebook. “I’m gonna...take this to my room,” she said. “I suppose you don’t want me to tell anyone about this, either?”
“Tony wouldn’t have given up just because you yelled at him to go away,” he pointed out. “That’s kind of Tony’s specialty.”
Tony glanced up at Steve, who was wide-eyed and would probably be as white as Tony’s makeup if his face weren’t covered in chestnut fur.
The child followed a little longer, but the car sped up as the traffic cleared, leaving him in the dust.
Tony was marrying Natasha. At some moments it felt as though Steve had made his peace with that fact, and at others it still struck him like a blow to the gut. His heart wanted the man he loved for himself, not to be shared with
It still felt like a place for dancing, with joyful notes of song whirling through the air, and Steve had half a mind to ask Tony to dance with him before realizing that there was no music, and that it was a ridiculous request anyway.
“You have ten seconds to get out from under my bed and come out with your hands up, or I’m calling the cops,” he yelled through the safely closed door, willing his voice not to shake.
She wriggled out of his grip, snatching the bra off through one of her shirtsleeves, and dropping it to the ground, even as Ty cupped one of her breasts in his hand. Her breast was small, and his hands was huge, and covered it fully.
One night, Steve lay awake in his bed listening to Sam blissfully snoring from the other side of the room, and he wondered, briefly, if Tony’s actions would make more sense if he were feeling the same things Steve was feeling. The wondering soon stuck in his mind like a stubborn burr, and by the time the midday meal rolled around, he could think of little else.
Steve collapsed against a wall in a corridor he barely recognized through hazy vision. What if Loki had done something far more terrible to Tony than chaining him up in a basement and leaving him there alone for months? What if they had been ignoring the signs of a severe magical tampering with Tony’s mind for
She bit her lip; her face felt numb, and it wasn’t from the cold. “Unless I do,” she said, slowly, as the realization came to her.
That was the exact moment Tony realized that he was holding Bucky by the upper arm on one side, and the side of his chest on the other. His gaze dropped from Bucky’s face to his shoulder, and even in the dying light of the evening, he visibly went white. Bucky pressed his lips together, looking down at the ground, and the others just waited in a tense, uncomfortable silence. After some contemplation of the stump of Bucky’s left arm, concealed beneath the pinned sleeve of his jerkin, Tony reached up and put his hands on Bucky’s shoulders, his thumbs digging into his collarbones.
Her voice echoed, “wake up, wake up, wake up,” until it was ringing in her ears, and it wouldn’t go away, and Steve was still limp in her arms.
“Lord Fury sent me to escort you,” Bucky said distractedly, reaching out to curiously chuck Tony’s newly-bearded chin. “His informants are concerned that an attack may be made on you before the departing feast.”
But Natasha was shaking her head. “No matter what he looked like, Tony would come find us if he were able. You think he would let something like a magical disguise stop him from coming here and trying to convince us of his identity?”
Nia watched Howard’s face turn grim, his eyes go far away, and she knew he was thinking about the war. She bit her lip.
It was a relief, to hear him say it, in his reassuring, kind tone, and he reached over and patted her shoulder, and she straightened up a little bit. It was easier, certainly, than saying it herself, even if she still didn’t want to admit it.
Apparently not, because Steve is now dressed and pressed and put together, and, well… he’s still incredibly pretty, but Tony at least has some idea now of how he’d missed the incredible hotness up until this point. Somewhere between the checkered button-down and the pleated khakis lies the answer. But mostly now he looks at Steve and sees earnest blue eyes, a crooked grin, and a fetching phobia of spiders scrabbling up his leg while wet and naked, and oh god, his brain sticks for a moment on
“I do not wish to sully your hope, Princess,” he said, as they descended the stairs into the grand entryway once more. His voice had dropped low in deference to the numerous castle denizens now milling all around them. “But… I feel I should make myself quite clear. My brother does not appreciate loose ends being left upon his schemes. If he succeeds in extracting the willing compliance of your betrothed, it is unlikely that he will permit him to live.”
The tunic he wore as he and Natasha caught everyone’s attention was deep red and trimmed at every edge with a thick band of intricate gold silk, reaching to his knees but slit at the front beneath his belt. Over the tunic’s chest was a large embroidered piece, looking almost like a plate of armor, which glittered in the firelight with precious gemstones to match the formal scabbard at his hip. He wore black breeches beneath tall black boots, and sweeping down from his high, buttoned collar and over his shoulders was a black cloak falling almost to his ankles. The inside of the cloak was all gold silk, shimmering and billowing behind him as he walked with Natasha down the stairs to the stone floor.
It had been almost exactly like her bedroom in the other half of the house-- same paint, same wallpaper, same furniture, same carpet. Even some of the same tchotchkes and toys and books. Her clothing had been moved over from one side of the house to the other while she had been at the hospital, and the few belongings that couldn’t be duplicated had been moved with them.
-- that Nia felt at her most insecure. Four years after Jim had sought her out to invite her to a party because she was ”the smartest person in school," she was still surprised that their friendships had lasted right up till graduation.
She tightened her grip while Sam and Clint egged her on, digging her sharp fingers into the sensitive crook of his elbow. “Do you not find me enticing?”
She shuddered. The room was pure darkness; she couldn’t see a thing except for some pale lights blinking in green and blue and red and white along the wall to the right. She supposed it was unlikely the door was in that wall, so she put her hands out and slid her feet along the floor, slowly and carefully so as not to slam into anything, and moved in the direction of the wall opposite the window.
Steve’s eyes flashed open to glare weakly at the other man. “Of course it is. Even if he were not a prince, and not a man, for him to be married and for us to… I can't.”
“Nee?” Jim asked, as she stomped through the sand, back up to them. It was only from the expressions on their faces that she realized how awful she must look. “What’s the matter?”
Or… did he feel trapped living with Tony? It wasn’t like he had much of a choice, did he? The thought had occurred to Tony before, but he’d always managed to chase it away when Steve would smile at him, or start another food fight, or let Tony gently scrub paint out of his fur. What if Steve was desperate to leave, but he just couldn’t? He literally couldn’t go outside without putting himself in danger, and Tony had been completely oblivious because he
“Nah,” Tony barked eloquently, pulling back and holding Bucky at arm’s length to glare reprovingly at him. “I don’t know how you think this is your fault, but it’s not. You had nothing to do with it, I—”
Every sweet spark that may have been in Steve’s body disappeared in that moment. He snapped his sketchbook shut and stood up stiffly. “My ma is dead,” he informed Tony. “You would know if you wasn’t such a selfish jerk.”
After their meal, Bucky tore off his shirt and ran, whooping and hollering, into the creek. The water was far too cold for Steve to get into, and he was a big boy now, so he knew better than to get in anyway and get sick yet again. So he rolled up his too-large breeches even further than usual, up to his knees, and sat on the squat log they’d dragged over months ago, flicking his feet through the glittering water and laughing with Bucky.
This time it was Steve that all but pushed Natasha out of his way as he barreled into the room. Across from the door, chained to a ring on the wall by his left wrist, was a man Steve only recognized to be Tony because he had known the man for such a very long time. After almost seven months of captivity, the bright warmth of the sun had faded from his skin, the flush of health from his cheeks, and his hair and beard were long and unkempt. He was dirty, obviously malnourished, and the most wonderful sight Steve had ever seen.
Tony and Natasha were being cheered by the entire room, and Steve felt sick to his stomach. He jumped in shock when Bucky laid a hand on his shoulder, but when he met his friend’s sympathetic eyes he managed to regain enough composure to nod at the dismissal and make a quiet exit.
She put on the pair of blue shoes that were in the closet-- higher than any shoes she normally wore, with tiny spindles for heels, and she wobbled a little as she got her bearings. She twisted a bit of wire around the antonium capsule, then strung it on a chain from another necklace, and hung it around her neck. The metal was cool and smooth against her sternum, and it looked enough like a very modern piece of jewelry that Nia was satisfied it wouldn’t draw too much attention.
“I would not be so certain,” Thor said quietly from the other side of Bucky, thumbing the leather-bound hilt of his warhammer. “My brother is well-known for his trickery.”
And then she’d slowly realized that Jim and Carol were birds of a feather-- almost literally, the way they spent all their time talking about airplane maneuvers and the latest engines. Nia could join in the engineering parts of the conversations, talk about aerodynamics and design, but
Steve went stiff. He did his best not to let it show, and Natasha very quickly distracted Tony from his reaction—not to mention Sam and Clint’s horror-struck faces—by spilling what was left of her wine on his shoes. As she and Tony puttered about mopping up the mess, with Tony far more upset by the spill than he really should have been, Steve’s mind raced.
They were clearly in the king’s chambers. The décor was opulent and heavy, with rich fabrics and furnishings, the curtains drawn tightly over the window and the whole room lit only by flickering sconces and an enormous fireplace. The four-poster bed against the far wall was immense, though it appeared a little smaller since the curtains along two sides were shut, and the bed-coverings had been pulled up and set up around the perimeter in a sort of nest of coverlets and furs.
Pepper, Sam, and Clint were caught up with the scheme, and after that it became little more than a waiting game. Even having hardly left the impostor’s side for several days, Pepper did not know who Natasha’s traitor might be, unless it was Lord Fury himself. After all, the false Tony barely socialized with anyone but Fury and a few high-ranking representatives from his own kingdom. Preparations for the wedding were proceeding without a hitch, and the great hall had been filled with pews and stands ready to be filled with decorative flowers the next day.
Bucky and Natasha jostled with each other as they started towards him as well, though Tony saw a well-placed elbow take Bucky out of the running with a wheeze, and then Natasha was in his arms and he twirled her around as high as he could lift her.
Steve’s hands balled into fists at his side. “Even if… I was willing. I will not share you. It's not… it's not right.”
She had gone down to his office, the one that was in the house, the room with high ceilings and dark wood paneling, shelves upon shelves of books, and nearly every surface covered high in a mess of papers. She had sat down in the big, squishy chair that faced his desk, wearing the same slacks and blouse she’d worn all day, in stocking-feet, and waited for him.
“This is where the hotel is,” Dr. Yinsen answered. They drove up a long, flower-lined drive, and stopped at a gate where a security guard in a smart uniform checked their papers before allowing them through.
So she’d become comfortable with the idea of the two of them, a pair, a matched set, and slowly her crush had faded, and she couldn’t think of her life without either of them in it.
“Oh, for--” Howard started, and he waved the child away, shaking his head. “Get away!” he called. “We can’t help!”
Without a thought, he threw himself beneath the surface, and the pain did not recede but instead began to take direction. Pulses of it shot through his bones, heaving at his muscles and his skin. An itching fire spread across his flesh, as though he was being stabbed over his entire body. But with the water there, cold and still and liquid around him, the pain began to become tolerable and, eventually, it faded away entirely.
They were directed by the guards up to the guest wing, where Tony was being set up in what had unofficially become his chambers in Natasha’s ancestral castle. Natasha was there already, sitting cross-legged on the bed, while Tony was setting up some sort of ridiculous apparatus of metal rods and what were probably priceless glass containers on the desk in the corner. Bucky was cheerfully following Natasha’s direction, unpacking Tony’s clothing and stashing it all around the room – but emphatically
It wasn’t an ordinary bed, of course-- it was a high platform, covered with-- as she’d assumed-- a clear plastic dome.
It was her father’s voice, her father, who have never tried to wake her up once in her entire life, standing in the doorway.
Nia shut the door and copied her mother’s actions. The door sprang open, satisfyingly so. She grinned and popped it shut again.
Steve set off at a sleek gallop, trusting his horse to keep her footing as they sped back through the rain towards the castle.
She stared at the yellow sheet; it made her feel as if she were a floating head, as if there were nothing below it. She bit her lip, and, out of nowhere, wondered what had happened to her blue cocktail dress.
So Natasha extricated herself from the two men atop her legs and took his place. She immediately launched into a fast, jaunty reel, which Tony instinctively attempted to drag Steve into as soon as it began. But Steve was bigger than Tony, and refused to move; just gave Natasha a look pleading for mercy. She grinned sharply at him and segued into a much calmer, more structured rhythm, with lilting midtones and a solid beat to follow.
Natasha had been in a fine strop for the last few months, after Lord Fury received a missive from King Howard stating that his Grand Advisor, Lord Stane, had expressed deep reservations about the prince and princess’s impending nuptials, and that he would be accompanying the prince on his trip this summer to discuss the details further with Lord Fury. The princess stomped to and fro about the drawing room, her antechamber, the boys’ chambers (to Lady Hill’s exasperation), and most of the rest of the castle, grousing about the delay and expressing a strong desire to be finally married and able to control her own kingdom and affairs.
A journalist in the front, a woman with pale skin and brown hair, chuckled at the answer, and then grinned, and gave Nia a thumbs-up, and the laughter filled Nia with renewed confidence, and she got into the spirit of the thing, rattling off sarcastic answer after sarcastic answer, and, after a few questions, felt emboldened to pose for the cameras, trying to mimic the looks of the models in Carol’s magazines-- blowing a kiss over her shoulder, standing with one hand on her hip.
“Hibernating,” she said. “The obvious answer would be raising the temperature, right? So let’s assume they already tried that. I guess they’ve already calculated that this is the optimal temperature, right? Okay. So.”
Some way, somehow, Tony got them moving out of the bedroom and into the main room of his fancy condo. Possibly Tony had won Steve over with his superior debating skills, or possibly Steve was just tired of having his fur yanked on. Tony wasn’t questioning it. He released Steve for the moment and sped over to check himself in the hall mirror.
It was all over… and was Tony really to die here, in this quiet, wind-sheltered clearing alone and without any way to help his friends? He wanted to fight! But, oh, how he wanted the pain to end. It was not the mortal agony of some of his other transformations, but he could feel his cursed body punishing him for straying so far from the lake. Every second the pain beat within him, so that other thoughts fell from his mind as soon as they came, like water spilling hopelessly through his trembling fingers.
There was also the issue that Tony was not explicitly dead, nor injured, but rather vanished entirely. Moreover, if Bucky had, in fact, hired someone to perform the attack or kidnap the prince, there was no logical way he would have ended up in the middle of the crossfire, atop the carriage as it plummeted down – he certainly would not have lost his own
Steve shivered a little, and Tony could see his dog-like nose twitch slightly as he sifted the scents in the air. His eyes were closed, his mouth soft, and Tony wondered abruptly if he should offer him a hug.
“Tomorrow afternoon,” Steve agreed, directing his comment to the room at large. Natasha had a ship in port they could use, and there was little else to prepare other than their personal packs.
“No black,” Maria answered. “Everyone wears black. If you wear black, they won’t see you.. You want people to be forced to notice you.”
Then again, he had said he did not work with others. While it was possible he was lying, Tony had to at least consider that he was being truthful. Not least because of his enchanted scepter. And, in that case… he had caused the explosions and the carriage crash on his own, apparently flipping the enormous, gilded royal conveyance straight over the edge of the cliff. That would require superhuman strength – or
“What about Peggy?” the guy—it sounded like a guy, anyway, albeit one who gargles sand before bed every night—asked, sounding kind of lost.
She chewed her lip. It was a bad habit, one her mother had scolded her for time and time again, but it was one she couldn’t quite break herself of. At least in the privacy of her own bedroom, no one else could see.
Tony’s eyes grew very soft and warm, and Steve began to wonder, yet again, if it really would be so wrong to give in to this.
The expression on Ty’s face, confident and proud and raging, fell away, and his brow furrowed. He looked worried, frightened. “Public Relations?” he repeated.
Sam clearly took exception to that, and actually pulled off his shoe to throw it at Steve. Steve caught it on a reflex, which sent Tony further into giggles as he tried to communicate without being able to form sentences that Steve should be able to dance if he was able to display such otherwise fine motor control.
“Yeah, that makes up for all the hugs I didn’t get as a child,” Nia retorted, surprising herself with her anger. “If he respects me, he’d be at graduation.”
The noise came again, this time persisting until it caught on his vocal cords and became less of a croak, and more of a pained moan. Steve instantly grabbed Bucky’s hand while Natasha laid her palm on his chest, gesturing frantically for Sam to go fetch the doctor when he poked his head inside.
The prince led them to a set of stairs which they ascended in short order, then along a long corridor down into one of the wings of the palace. Judging by the way the traffic of other people disappeared entirely in this part of the palace, Natasha presumed it was the private residence of the royal family. They remained largely silent at first, until Clint commented on some of the ancient suits of armor lining the walls, at which point he and Thor began discussing the topic of what did and did not fall under the category of ‘too much’ armor. They discovered that Thor wore nothing more than wide-link chain mail upon his arms in battle, preferring the freedom of movement to the protection of plating, and Thor discovered that Clint had never worn metal armor in his life, to the prince’s clear shock.
He was more handsome than Steve had remembered. Tony was eighteen now, and he had lost all but the final dregs of childhood roundness in his face. His jaw was solid, his chin proud and jutting. His eyes sparkled still as he looked over at Steve, and Steve…
The groom looked at him a little oddly, obviously taken aback by the question, but he nodded and flashed a small smile. “Of course I do.”
Just before they reached the bottom of the staircase, Steve’s foot landed on a small pile of debris, perhaps from the crumbling walls, and his leg slipped suddenly forward. Bucky’s hand shot forward to grab him, his dagger pinched carefully between his thumb and forefinger, and stopped Steve from stumbling the last few steps down. He could not stop the echoing sound of the displaced rocks as they clattered before Steve onto the stone floor. Both men froze, going tense from head to toe as they listened intently. Just before Steve was about to raise a hand and indicate that they continue, Bucky’s fingers tightened on his shoulder and he flicked the knife to point to their left.
“I just came for some bread,” Tony said quickly, holding up the note they’d left telling him where to go. “And I will get out of your way.”
Nia threw her hands up. “Ask my parents,” she retorted. “They’re too busy quarreling to tell me anything.”
“I get it,” Nia said. She patted her pocket. “I’ll put it on a chain, turn it into a necklace.”  She grinned. “If I paint some hearts on it they’ll think it’s some dopey teenager jewelry; they won’t give it a second look.”
“Nothing more than what you can give freely,” the Asgardian said in what he must have thought was a soothing voice.
They went more or less obligingly, Steve and Sam, back to the room they shared in the set of chambers Steve and Bucky had lived in since they were brought to the castle. Steve was reeling with emotions, but he still knew better than to cross Natasha when she was that mad. Bucky joined them a little while later, but did not say anything. He just put on his bedclothes and retreated into his own room, closing the door quietly. Sam was quiet as well, leaving Steve to stew on it all evening.
Then Sir Alexander turned to look down at Steve. He was far smaller than the knight, but Steve had finally begun to see some progress as far as his vertical mission was concerned, and for the first time since they were practically infants Steve was of a height with Bucky. Bucky was still easily twice as wide as Steve, but at this point he was willing to take what he could get.
The guy… monster? Beast? He shuffled nervously and Tony kept staring in disbelief. Then the beast-man peered up at him with startlingly blue eyes and asked: “Are you scared?”
A thick, dark curtain-- a blackout curtain---obscured her view. She couldn’t place it; she certainly didn't recall seeing it from its reverse. She racked her brain, trying to put this room in position in her mental model of the house, trying the remember if those curtains might have draped a window in one of her father's storerooms, when suddenly, with a hitch of her breath, it struck her.
“Hurry,” Tony pleaded, sounding closer but not like he was on the other side of the door. “He could be back any time, he’s always here after the sun rises.”
“You’re also starting Academy in a few weeks,” Maria had answered, clasping her hands in front of her on the desk. “School is going to get harder. They’re going to start preparing you for your career. Have you thought about what you want to do?”
That light did not reach the bed where Steve sat. “I did what was necessary,” he said, after a while. His ribs felt too tight even as he told what he knew was the truth – he did not understand why it felt like a lie.
Tony peered helplessly around Bucky at the sound of Steve’s voice, and almost forgot about his nervousness when he caught sight of the other man.
It was already painfully late by the time Nia fell into her bed, especially given that she'd been up before six the morning previous, and hadn't exactly slept well, being a bundle of nerves about graduation.
Then again, a soldier knows how to use his arsenal to devastating effect, and Steve can scarcely go wrong with those killer abs and eyelashes.
, without quite realizing what she was doing, and for the second time in as many days, felt more helpless than she had in her life.
She pulled back and smiled at him – a precious thing, since the princess was good-natured but generally more reserved than that. “Welcome back, Tony,” she greeted, patting his cheek affectionately.
“The spell won’t last long if you take my blood unwillingly,” Tony hissed up at Obadiah, gritting his teeth so as not to cry out. By design, they had chosen a room where nobody would be able to hear what was going on inside – and even if he did manage to bring someone running to his aid, he didn’t know what Obadiah would do to them if they came. He was alone in this.
To Tony’s surprise, he found that more and more as the summer went on, Bucky tended to join him in leaving Steve and Sharon to it; clearly a better person than either Steve or Tony and willing to let bygones be bygones. So as Natasha and Pepper sauntered off to cause some sort of subtle and no-doubt terrible mischief elsewhere, Tony, Rhodey, and their new addition of Bucky kept themselves amused around the castle. Bucky had daily duties as a page, but ended up spending most of his free time with the other two boys in Steve’s notable absence.
She knew she wasn’t, though. She hadn’t done anything of note; she might be the daughter of important people, but she was barely out of the Academy; she had no accomplishments of her own to her name.
Steve felt a flush of panic, feeling that he had missed something, and that he would miss something bigger if he allowed Tony to leave right then. He jumped to his feet and reached out to grasp at Tony’s sleeve when he passed by. “Wait,” he said, not quite as urgently as he felt, pinching the white sleeve of Tony’s shirt between the tips of his fingers and trying to hold the man in place.
The room they were gathered in was in the center of the castle, so the only windows were the clerestory ones high on the southern wall, but at this late hour there was very little light entering through them. Instead, the cavernous room was lit by a vast number of candles, so that it was bright and warm, golden, and Steve briefly remembered flashes of kissing Tony in a room lit like this, tasting his skin and touching his body, and he flushed bright pink right there in his seat.
Even now, Tony felt torn between gratitude, wonderment, and stubborn anger at the very concept that an individual might reach out and bend the laws of reality to suit their wishes at any moment. Queen Frigga was noted for her healing gifts, but as he got older, Tony had begun to wonder if the queen truly had a gift for restorative magic, or if she simply chose to use her gifts that way. After all, if the terrible war between Asgard and Jötunheim that had broken out not five years later was any indication, many—if not most—of the magical Asgardians did not choose to wield their powers so benignly.
Then they were falling. Tony remembered the carriage spinning around him, as he, Bucky, and his parents turned far too slowly within it to keep from being hurt.
Howard scrubbed at his hair with his hand. “Do you know why we gave you such a stuffy old-ladies’ name?” he asked. “Do you know what it means?”
“Shut him up,” Lord Fury barked before turning on the dais, looking coldly over to where the crowd had parted around Lord Stane as if he carried the plague.
It grew more and more difficult, as the years went on and Steve started to leave the last of his childhood behind, for Tony to deny what he felt for him. Steve had turned sixteen the previous summer, and Tony was hard-pressed to find more than just traces of the white-blond, twiggy, sour little boy he’d first met in the man Steve was becoming. His hair had darkened to pure gold, like a crown gifted to him by Nature herself – though his skin remained pale, and changed in the sun only to display an array of freckles like constellations over Steve’s nose. He was still thin, but he lacked the sickly, frail look of his youth.
Clearly he was not dead, and if Loki intended to ensure that anybody stumbling across Tony in this place would not recognize him, the logical conclusion was that his appearance had been altered. However, due to the extraordinary pain of the transformation and the fact that all his limbs and bones and even his
Sighing, she put the blue dress away and found something more suitable-- a more conservative, tailored green dress with a cardigan in deeper green, and a pair of plain, respectable-looking brown flats.
“WAKE UP!” she shouted. The echoes doubled, now, crescendoing over each other, louder and louder instead of fading away.
Distantly, Steve could hear the melodious sound of Natasha shouting at Tony, then some movement around the table, and then Tony was gone, and he slumped back down.
It had been a long succession of weeks that Steve and his friends—with the unforgettable new addition of Thor—had been strategically combing the land around Natasha’s castle in ever-increasing rings. Now that they knew who they were looking for, now that they had an actual physical description of the man responsible for so much misery, their search was making strides. A simple sketch of Loki, done by Steve with Thor’s prompting, had been traced and posted in every major town in the kingdom, which had eventually drummed up a confirmed sighting not far from Kingstown. To Steve’s horror, it was less than a day’s ride from the castle. So terribly close, all along.
After a long moment of silence, Natasha pulled back and grabbed Tony’s face between her hands. She stared at him for a moment, then leaned in and pressed a kiss to his lips, the tip of his nose, then tilted his head down to kiss his forehead. “We are taking you home,” she murmured.
“Yeah, yeah, you just back away, go on,” Clint crowed, keeping the arrow trained on the swan as it retreated, then beginning to inch forwards, driving it back towards the lake. “Don’t give me that offended look –
, dusting some powder on her face and some deep, smoky shadow on her eyes. She could never figure out which lipstick was right for her skin tone; all of Carol’s were too light and too pink on her, so she put on a coating of lip gloss and called it a day, looking in the mirror and deciding that the end result was not unsatisfactory.
“That isn’t—” Bucky began at a volume slightly below a roar, when an arrow suddenly embedded itself in the dirt at his feet. The distance between the arrowhead and the toe of his boot was as thin as a fly’s gossamer wing. The three of them stared down at it in surprise for a moment, before Bucky dug it up with an angry yank and turned to shout at Clint, waving the arrow around. “That she's in range of your arrows does not mean she's safe, you buffoon!”
Steve flaps a hand up and down at Tony’s embarrassing attire. He hasn’t even changed out of The Slippers. “To go—for coffee?”
They left Obie, but Yinsen walked to an elevator with shining golden doors and floor-to-ceiling mirrors on the walls, and an
The time came yet again for Tony to leave, and he paid a fond farewell to Natasha, Bucky, and Sam in the castle courtyard.
“Wait, Ty, come on,” she said, and he frowned at her, resting his hand against the tree trunk, just above her head, hovering over her with an inquisitive look.
“Tony?” came a tentative voice from behind them, and Steve loosened his death-grip on Tony’s nape enough for Tony to peer over his shoulder.
The robotic man disappeared behind the curtain, and then reappeared with a transparent box, a box that had tubes and wires running in and out of it. He set it down on the small table next to Nia’s bed, just between Nia and the screen in his chest, obscuring her vision of her mother.
“Wrong,” Pepper supplied, and he nodded reluctantly. “Oh, Steve,” she said in a rush, grabbing his hand. “I cannot tell you how good it is to hear this. I thought perhaps I… but you’re right. The man in Tony’s room is not the man I have known for fifteen years, but I don’t know…”
“The nuclear bombs,” Nia said, biting her lip. “The ones you used to end the war. The ones you used to convince the rest of the world to join UNITY. They were--”
Clint gave Steve an incredulous look. “Do I look like a sorcerer? The only thing I recognized was notebooks—and jars I wouldn’t touch if you paid me in gold bullion—and more notebooks.”
written on it in a looping scribble, it isn’t that hard to figure out what just happened. Steve is still beaming at him, and he hasn’t let go of his hand. He’s obviously both pleased and embarrassed by his friends’ antics, which is oddly sweet on a guy who looks like he could take out anyone who crosses him with one punch (as long as that someone is not a spider, of course).
Natasha nodded. They'd had no word of Tony having been taken through any port in her kingdom, no matter how small – which did not rule out sea travel entirely, but suggested that he was still within her borders. With Fury’s extensive fortifications and guards, a land escape was even less likely. She nodded again, turning to her host. “If I may, Prince Thor, I must send a missive to my ship. We have friends with us here in Asgard seeking information they need seek no longer.”
Lying limply on the ground at Sam’s knees, Bucky’s entire arm was mutilated from his shoulder down past his elbow. Steve could not even tell what remained of his hand. It must have been caught in the carriage, or perhaps on a branch as he flew from the carriage in its violent fall. Steve thought he saw bone showing in some places, and he could hardly continue to look – revulsion clogging his throat and almost stilling his heart.
Tony went tense in her arms, and they all sprung to attention in response. “You can’t,” Tony told her, and Steve’s stomach dropped.
From the other end of the store, presumably from behind the counter, there comes a loud whoop of glee—Tony looks up in time to see a young man with long brown hair and an apron slap a hand down cheerfully on the shoulder of the man who’d taken their drink orders. Long-hair hollers something like “Finally! Damn, Stevie!” before the cashier hushes him with a gap-toothed grin.
“And shut him up as well,” Natasha added frostily, standing on the platform and staring down at Stane.
“This is not like him,” Pepper insisted, even as the others tried their own self-reassuring arguments on her.
The meal was subdued, but that was also becoming expected. Part of the problem was that Tony was usually the spring of their good humor, or at least the thread tying them all together. He was no longer either. Even with Thor’s exuberant contributions, their conversation floundered in uncertainty more often than not. And furthermore, Tony was actually responding in ways very unlike his usual self: he laughed at the wrong jokes, responded to the wrong people, and threw everything off-balance throughout the meal, to the point where it became impossible to overlook.
The place hadn’t been as dusty as Tony expected, which was his first clue; but of course he hadn’t really registered that at the time. It had belonged to some ageing socialite, or her daughter, or possibly her granddaughter, Tony hadn’t cared enough to ask. Whatever the case, it hadn’t actually been lived in for months. Possibly years.
Holding out one of the rings from the little pouch he had been entrusted with, he leaned in to whisper to Tony so only Natasha and the priest could overhear. “Do you have the amulet Sam gave you?”
Never let it be said that Tony was unable to tell where he was not wanted. His excitement retreated quickly when he noted Steve’s demeanor, joy leaking out from him like water from a cracked vase. He too drew himself up, trying to catch Steve’s eye, but Steve still would not look at him.
Her face went hot, and she ground down on her teeth, grabbing his hand by the wrist and tugging it free of her jeans. “This is how you want to remember me?” she asked. “Finger-fucked up against a tree?”
