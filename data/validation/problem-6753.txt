"Yeah, I needed it. Pep's gonna be calling me to come in, no doubt she and Bruce and them have been texting me--" Tony sighed into Steve's chest, forcing himself to breathe and not think.
"No wonder you chose this bed. It’s more comfortable than mine." He observed, picking lightly at the blankets.
"Please?!" Peter asked enthusiastically, practically jumping at the idea. "Then I can play in my room, 'n Unca Clint and I can play 'n I have Unca Buck 'n Auntie Tasha for cuddles!"
"I know you like the incentive. I'll leave the paddle out so you can think it over," Tony smirked, leaning down to smooch Steve's collarbone, "Or the crop. But that might be too heavy for you."
Tony steadied his hands on either side of Steve's chest, slowly thrusting into him. He panted softly, ducking his head to kiss at Steve's jawline.
Tony bobbed his head as he mumbled to himself, re-lighting his pipe to take another puff. As a second thought, he picked up the crossword, raising an eyebrow at the answers.
He felt his fingers intertwine with Tony's, the other giving his hand a reassuring squeeze. Steve was pulled into a gentle kiss, soft but heated and full of longing that both had built up for so, so long. When they parted, Tony looked up at him as their foreheads gently bumped together, a loving smile on the brunet's lips.
He winced at the familiar voice, but watched as the trembling camera approached his old room in the mansion.
"Damn, Tony. Such a great mouth. Always feels so good--" Steve praised, petting Tony's hair in encouragement.
"I'll eat later, hon, thanks for asking though," Tony hummed, turning onto his side once Steve got up, "I'm gonna try and sleep this spell off."
Tony didn't scoot over when Steve opened the door, unflinchingly staring at the Doctor's backside as he crawled over him to sit in his spot. He shut the door and whistled at the driver, still thinking as the carriage lurched toward Baker Street. Humming, Tony put his arm up around Steve, staring out his window in thought.
, Tony thought to himself, slowly moving down Steve's body to kiss his skin, tracing fingers over scars and moles, memorizing him like a map.
"Maybe I like being in trouble, sir," Tony replied, blinking innocently at Steve, "Or I'm just a bad boy."
"The guy we're seeing-- he's a psychologist and a psychiatrist,” he replied, "Pep really knows this guy, says he knows his stuff. Let's... Let's go before I wimp out."
"Fank you, Daddy." Peter chimed, getting up for a moment to hug Tony then going back to his drawing. "Come dwa'h too, Daddy!".
Peter sighed and chowed down his second helping of food, hopping off his chair to put his dishes in the dishwasher.
He moaned softly, whimpers escaping from his mouth. Steve worked on opening Tony up quickly before tugging his fingers away to slick himself up.
Steve let out a careful chuckle. "Not like that, baby. It means like... Kissing other people than the one you are dating or married to."
Two days later, Steve finally got his memories back. He said 'yes' before Tony even got all of the question out, sealing the deal with a kiss.
"And if I disobey?" Tony looked at his hand and then back at Steve, before reaching down with his other hand.
"You're the biggest cheeseball," Tony huffed, kissing his breastbone before they started to walk again, "But apparently, you don't know how to dance. I'll teach you to tango sometime--" He trailed off, leaning against Steve's shoulder.
"That decision to spoil me is on you, not me, love. You're the one who took me away from my job to 'work' for you." Steve chuckled, leaning just a bit to see what Tony was writing.
"You're so strong, betcha got super strength," he teased, "But even superheroes need to put on their undies and pajamas."
Tony looked to Steve, the other's blue eyes staring at him wide in askance from under the sheets. With these sort of things, Tony was used to either himself leaving soon after or his partners leaving. It wasn't normal for his partners to ask him to stay. Granted, this wasn't just any old fling, this was Steve. And they technically were going to be starting to date each other, so staying would be normal. Besides, Tony wasn't going to deny that he missed having a body next to him since he and Pepper had split. So maybe this would be a good thing.
The brunet held a hand carefully to his chest over the arc reactor, letting out a breath of relief that he didn't know he'd been holding. He did however notice the look on Steve's face drop a bit, embarrassment on the blond's features.
The singing ceased and without turning the billionaire swung his free arm around, palm open and the high-pitched whirring of a pulsar beam charge was heard.
Steve shook his head, “I don’t know if I can trust that right now. I really don’t. I-I…” He paced a little. “I feel like I don’t even know you anymore…”
“Well,” Tony poured himself another glass of gin from the near-empty bottle sitting on the next table, “Maybe it’s time for Tony Stark to change.”
Steve crossed his arms as he watched Tony succeed so excellently and easily in what he had been attempting for over half an hour. “So are you suggesting we just feed our son candy, then?”
His flight had gotten in rather late, so he was sure Steve would be asleep. He loosened his tie and started for the kitchen, intending to grab the most ready-to-eat thing he saw in the refrigerator, which would most likely be leftovers Steve had made.
Steve nodded and placed a hand on Tony’s reactor. They shared a look for a brief moment before the mask slid down and Stark blasted off. Slinging his shield across his back, Steve jumped on his motorcycle and sped off in the same direction, praying that Peter would be okay.
“And what if it happens again? You promised me you’d stop drinking so much, especially after we talked about adopting a baby. If you can’t even keep that then what…” He sighed again, exasperated.
“I’m so sorry Steve…” Tony whispered, barely audible and not able to look at the super soldier as he passed.
His blood ran cold. “Where exactly on the building did you say he was?” His voice was commanding, he was in Captain mode, no nonsense just straight to the point. Getting the information from Phil, he picked up his pace with a muttered “Thanks” before hanging up and breaking into a full-out run.
“Were you that worried about him not coming to our house? I mean, I know your father can get up to tricks sometimes but…”
Tony continued: “I can’t though, I just can’t. Because none of this is your fault. The only mistake you made was the decision to be with me, but even then I’m still partly to blame because I fell for you and stupidly thought that things might actually work out. But no, they never do because I’m too much of a fuck-up to get anything right. Why should this be any different?” He looked down. “Even now I’m causing you pain. If it weren’t for Pepper and that damned traitor of an AI you wouldn’t be witness to such a spectacle. No, this could have all been settled in the quiet of my lab…” He murmured the last bit, perhaps thinking that Steve wouldn’t hear him. “If anything were to happen to me right now, it would just hurt you and maybe not only because you’d blame yourself.”
Tony had removed the last of the rubble and was scanning Peter, “He has extensive surface injuries and some internal bleeding; we need to get him out of here now.”
Tony moved to pick Peter up, but Steve stopped him, “I know it would be faster if you took him, but we don’t want to move him too much with the state he’s in. The ambulance will be fine.”
Rogers froze when he heard those words, and it was then that he took in Tony’s appearance: disheveled hair, shirt half-tucked in with only some of the buttons done up, and most of them in the wrong holes, his suit jacket nearly hanging off of one shoulder, and his belt was a little looser than usual, not to mention his tie was missing. There was also a couple smudges of pink around his white collar; it wasn't hard to tell what those were.
“You’ve got five seconds to make your ass scarce or I will blast you from here to Wakanda.” His voice was steady and clear, devoid of emotion.
He turned a few of the jars around to get a better look at the labels before selecting one with a satisfied ‘aha!’
“What’re you going to do with that?” He said, in between coughs and clearly in pain, “Gonna charge me up?”
“He knows me better than to think I would do that.” His thoughts flicked back to that morning. “Or maybe he doesn’t…” he murmured to himself, “It wouldn’t make any difference either way.”
Tony was snapped out of his reverie by the gentle feeling of water on his hand and it took him a moment to realize that he had started to cry. He hastily wiped away the few tears that had formed and in doing so inadvertently brought the suit nearer to his face where he caught the faint scent of Steve’s cologne. Tony was surprised that it had lasted that long on the clothing, but nonetheless he brought it closer, closed his eyes, and inhaled. It’s funny how many emotions and memories can be incited by a single object or smell, and right then Tony was experiencing all of them, every second he’d ever spent with Steve. All of the missions they’d been on together, the fights they’d had when they first met, the feelings he had when he first realized that he saw Steve as more than a teammate, that first kiss they’d shared, their playful banter, meals cooked together when Tony-the-genius would manage to burn almost everything, those long nights of passion when the world simply melted away, and the simple comfort from being in one another’s arms.
“Steve,” he began, stepping towards his husband, “I swear, tonight was a one-time thing. It won’t happen again, I promise.” But Tony knew how empty those words sounded, knew he was grasping at straws.
"God you’re gorgeous. Look at you…" Tony murmured appreciatively as he ran his other hand down Steve’s back and he kissed and nipped at his neck and collarbone—just the way he liked it.
Steve raised an eyebrow and hit Tony lightly on the arm with the back of his hand. Tony gaped in mock offense, and when Steve laughed at him he got another spoonful of applesauce and flicked it right in Cap’s face.
Suddenly, he grabbed Steve’s dick, dripping with precome, and pumped. Steve tilted his head back slightly and groaned.
Tony’s head whipped around to face his husband, brown eyes wide with hope and fear at the news that would follow.
Tony nodded and closed his eyes, falling against Steve, who smiled gently. He slipped his arms underneath Tony and lifted him as he stood, carrying him bridal style. For once, Tony did not object, and let his weight fall into Cap’s strong arms and began to slip into sleep. As Tony listened to Steve’s heartbeat and his slow steps, Steve whispered, “I love you Tony…”
Tony shook his head slightly against the fabric of Steve’s shirt, “I could do so much worse Steve, I don’t deserve you, but more than that, you could do a million times better than this mess.”
He faced Steve once again with the look of a defeated man. His voice was small, not in the least bit commanding, and broken, “I’ve already caused you enough pain, Steve. I can’t make you suffer anymore.”
The child looked up suddenly, caught by surprise at his father’s appearance. It was then, in the dim light of the Christmas tree and the dying fire, that Steve saw the tears glistening in his little boy’s eyes.
“Oh yeah, we were going to go out to dinner tonight, weren’t we?” Steve mumbled, a faint blush dusting his cheeks as he realized what he must look like. He released his grip on Tony, allowing the other man to stand.
come over.” He took a set of keys and his wallet from the stand in the entryway and slipped them into his pocket before heading for the door.
Steve did a mental sweep of his body, wincing slightly when he tried moving his limbs but thankfully found that they all worked.
As he lifted a particularly large block, he heard very faint coughing. Quickly pushing aside more loose rubble, Tony beheld the shredded mask of his son and beneath it he could see one closed eye and a mouth.
Steve stiffened; the last thing he wanted to do was go there where he might run into Tony. But then again, Tony had always been as evasive with S.H.I.E.L.D. as possible and probably wouldn’t set a foot near it no matter how much they forced him. Probably.
When he was finished, Peter had all of the proper cookies picked out and chose a new reindeer plate for them, one that Tony had just rolled his eyes at in the store but that Steve had insisted was adorable and that they couldn’t go without it. Steve poured new milk into a, sturdier, mug and followed Peter, who was carrying the cookies ever-so-carefully, into the living room.
Smirking, he slammed Cap’s head once more into the ground and released his hold on him and simply walked away, a crying, screaming, thrashing Peter in his arms.
“I don’t want whatever is ‘better’!” His tone was sharp, and it startled Tony. He finally released Tony from his death grip and faced him with a tear-stained face. “Because that’s not you,” he whispered, “and you’re all I want.” He cupped Tony’s cheek and ran his thumb along the rough stubble.
He took a few of the cookies and munched on them while he recovered presents ‘from Santa’ from his and Steve’s secret hiding spot in the wall behind the painting and placed them under the tree. He also filled up all three of their stockings with already-wrapped goodies and was unable to resist shaking the little box designated for him in an attempt to guess what it contained. He downed most of the milk and double-checked to make sure that everything was ready to go for morning.
“Well then maybe you never knew me! Maybe I can’t live up to this perfect image that you have laid out in your head. Am I not good enough for Mr.Golden-boy? Am I not good enough for the all-mighty Captain America?” Tony stopped himself.
She tried a different approach. She knew Tony well enough to know that he could refuse to talk no matter how much you pressed, but she also knew just how much he was hiding underneath that emotionless mask.
All Pepper could do was look sorrowfully at the broken man and sigh softly before leaving him in what little peace he had.
Stark followed the coordinates that JARVIS had traced from the call, frantically scanning the city streets below for any sign of his son. As he was getting closer, he saw a pile of rubble where the better half of a parking garage used to be, surrounded by civilians and emergency vehicles.
He zigzagged around people, didn’t wait for traffic but merely evaded and leapt over it. That was only done because of basic motor function and instinct; his mind was preoccupied with keeping the intimidatingly large skyscraper in view and reaching it as soon as possible. The rest was a jumbled mess, repetitions of
Tony smiled half-heartedly and took the cup, his other hand having not left Peter’s. Steve smiled back, but it faded as soon as he turned to look at their son. “Anything yet?”
“Captain Rogers? It’s Agent Coulson. You’re needed at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters as soon as possible.”
“Mostly my head, I think, and my back, but I can move…” he said, voice rough and pained from the vice-grip on his throat earlier.
“Y-yeah, it’s me. Hold on, I’m gonna get you out of here.” He gently held his son’s face, noticing the flow of blood stemming from underneath his mask. He began to move the rest of the rock off of Peter.
“He…he can’t be gone…” Steve whispered, looking into off as if deep in thought with his brow furrowed in pain and confusion. He glanced back up and met those chocolate brown eyes, “Tony?” His voice was so small and helpless.
And sure enough, when Tony ran down to the lab, the Captain America suit and shield were gone. As if to prove to himself that it wasn’t true, he raced upstairs to the room he and Steve shared and proceeded to open the drawers Steve stored his clothing in. All were empty. He threw open the closet doors to find half of it full of his own suits, shirts, and pants, but the other half held only a few empty hangers. Tony ran both hands through his hair in disbelief and took a step back. He was gone. He was really gone. He obviously didn’t have any plans of returning if he took everything--
Tony’s mind could not formulate a response. He just stared. Before him, Steve was incredibly and perfectly naked. He could only gape at the sight and watch as Steve slunk forward, a smug smile playing on his lips.
He’d often wondered if Tony would ever call, but he shook his head at the thought. He knew Tony that well at least and he would not make the first move. Had Steve ever thought of calling him? Of throwing open that door and rushing to his husband, promising never to leave again? Of course he had, and half the time he’d been tempted to actually do it. One time, on a cold evening, he even went to Avengers Tower, but didn’t go any farther than the sidewalk. He had just stared up at the brightly lit, looming thing, hands in his jacket pockets. He couldn't even go to their own house. He couldn’t do it, he just couldn’t do it. Every time it made him think of which was worse: loving someone and not being able to be with them, or loving someone and having to share them, never knowing if your love was ever truly being returned.
Tony spoke, and fear laced his words as he gazed up at the ceiling. “Peter? Where are you? What’s happening?”
…the drink still hadn’t quite worn off, but that was no excuse for what he’d just said. Tony always got on the defensive during their arguments, but this, this was not the time.
Tony’s brain short-circuited completely as Steve did not hesitate and took Tony’s entire length into his mouth. He moved up and down painfully slowly, massaging with his tongue as he did so. When he pulled up and swirled his tongue around the head, Tony let out a long moan and grasped Steve’s hair in one hand. He forced himself to sit up slightly and, propped up on one elbow, he took in the spectacular sight.
It happened to be one of those days as Tony was working in his lab and his mind chose to relive finding Steve’s belongings gone. Continuing with his welding, he reached for his glass of gin and quickly downed it. He’d been working nearly non-stop on various upgrades and new parts for the Iron Man suit, but so far none of them had produced the desired effect.
“I’ll get him.” He pressed a quick kiss to Tony’s nose before climbing over him and venturing out into the hallway.
Tony paused. He had rehearsed this a thousand times over on the cab ride back--god knows he didn't want to face even Happy in these circumstances--but that made it no easier to say. “Steve there’s…something I need to tell you…”
Steve just rolled his eyes and placed a gentle hand on Tony’s chest when the other man started to get up.
“I’m sorry Steve…” he murmured, “I’m so sorry…for everything that I’ve done…I’m sorry…” Tears slowly began to slip from his eyes as he shook his head and repeated the words over and over. Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s, wiping away a few tears with his thumb and held the other man gently as he cried.
and a final decision made because yes he was hurt, he was hurt beyond measure and the pain would probably worsen if he continued his life with Tony, but GOD he loved that man, he did love that man more than he hated the pain and the mere thought of an absolute, of Tony being gone forever out of his life and out of this world…well Steve knew that such a world would be unbearable and impossible to live in.
Steve managed to half-tackle Tony and held him in a headlock with one arm while his free hand dangerously held an open jar above Tony’s head, and said man managed to look up with shock and horror written across his face.
He lifted his head to meet his husband’s eyes, his own brimming with tears as his voice broke, “He might never wake up, Tony.”
Steve finally spoke, his voice unsteady from his breathing that was just beginning to slow down, “Tony…I-I won’t lie and say that I wasn’t hurt. I won’t tell you that it didn’t almost kill me when you came home that night. I won't say that everything is going to be okay and we'll act like nothing happened. But Tony…” His arms tightened around the other man and he breathed deep, taking in the smell of oil, grease, and sweat, but he didn’t care. Tony was here,
“Peter!” He bolted upright, or at least tried to, but a wave of agony and Tony’s gentle hands easing him back down stopped him.
Now he was back at it, and it was all because of that stupid playboy. The billionaire that convinced him to go on their first date, was the one who made him smile truthfully for the first time in 70 years, made him trusting enough for Steve to tell him things he wouldn’t dare repeat to anyone else, convinced him that he might actually stay faithful. He was missing the smirk of that stubborn man, longing to caress his skin, breathe in his scent, hear the soft hum of the glowing arc reactor, and taste his delicious lips. Because despite everything, he could not forget Tony and he could not ever stop loving Tony, even if the other man didn’t love him.
Steve sat in the empty chair next to Tony and handed him one of the cups. “Here,” he said, “You were staring into space for at least an hour and hadn’t taken a drink. I figured I’d get you a hot one.”
His left leg was in a cast, he had numerous stitches and bruises covering his body, a split lip, a black eye, tight, white gauze wrapped around his torso, and a mask over his mouth and nose to help him breathe, not to mention the many IVs and machines they had him hooked up to. Tony’s eyes watered as he gently took Peter’s limp hand. He grit his teeth; no matter how much they cleaned him up or how nice and white his dressings were, Tony knew he would never be able to unsee the broken, bloody body of his son.
“Papa!!!” Peter screamed, but no matter how much he struggled he could not break free nor distract the Other.
Tony continued to work until he accidentally mixed the wrong wires together, causing a great flurry of sparks to erupt from his project. He jumped back in surprise and shook the hand he burned, which he proceeded to angrily slam on the table.
They broke apart, both breathless and staring at the other. Finally, Steve ran a hand through Tony’s tousled black hair and placed a chaste kiss on his forehead.
The heart monitor beeped monotonously in the dim, sterile room, accompanied only by slightly laboured breathing. The smell of disinfectant pervaded the air but was briefly relieved by the faint scent of the coffee held between two calloused hands. Not a word escaped the lips of Tony Stark as he gazed sightlessly across the room, focused on nothing and thinking of everything. He took a slow sip of his coffee but made a slight face and stared in confusion at his now ice-cold drink. Deciding against it, he set the cup on the table next to his chair, where his gaze wandered to the sleeping patient. Tony’s eyes filled with pain as he looked at the young man lying there: his son, Peter.
“No wonder, I mean Apple and Pork Casserole?” He set it down and picked up another. “Egg custard with rice? Seriously, where did you
Steve laughed softly and reached up to grab the back of Tony’s neck and pull him into a deep kiss. Tony wound his hands in Steve’s gorgeous blond locks and began to gently massage his scalp. Steve was working on pulling Tony’s shirt off when they heard a slight scuffling followed by a
Steve paused for a brief second and glanced back at Tony, whose head was hanging and back facing him, before walking out, slamming the door behind him. As soon as he was gone, Tony let his knees give and he slumped to the floor. He tried to laugh hoarsely through the sobs that began to wrack his body, but soon he was overcome. He sat there for a long time, staring at the small gold band still lying on the floor and wondering if Steve would ever come back and what he would do if he didn’t.
Tony felt Steve’s muscles tighten beneath his touch, felt his breath hitch against his neck and then he was spilling over into Tony’s hand and softly moaning Tony’s name.
They lay there for a long while, listening for the sound of reindeer on the roof, when Peter spoke in a sleep-filled voice: “Papa?”
"You really missed me that much, hm?" Tony murmured lowly, watching as Steve’s face reddened slightly. "Now it’s my turn to show you how much I missed you."
Stark heard the rumble of a bike and the squealing of brakes right before Steve appeared beside him.
"You’re beautiful, Tony," Steve breathed in between gentle kisses. Tony’s breath hitched as Steve’s mouth went lower and lower until he was just above the waist of his pants. He stopped there, however, and came back up with a small smirk.
“Don’t even try coming after the boy,” he hissed menacingly, “Or next time I’ll make sure your back breaks. I’ll rip that precious machine heart out of Stark, and there will be nothing you can do to stop me.”
He was startled by a soft voice when his husband came around the corner in nothing but shorts. “Tony? Is that you?” Steve’s voice was groggy, but it didn’t sound like he’d actually gotten any sort of rest. As he approached, Tony could see faint dark circles under Steve's eyes and the weariness that was etched onto his face; none of it from lack of sleep.
After Steve had stormed out that morning, Tony ordered JARVIS to let him know if he called or came back while the billionaire was out, something he was going to avoid doing as much as possible. The only word he’d ever heard from Cap was when he came home a few days later and JARVIS plainly said,
“You ride with him; I’ll meet you at the hospital,” Stark insisted. Steve nodded and jumped into the ambulance after Peter was loaded and took his hand. Before the doors closed he glanced at Tony, their eyes etched with fear and pain.
“He-he’s gone, Steve.” Tony’s voice broke and he bit his lip in an attempt to stop the sobs from choking their way out.
"Get some rest, Petey. Love you." Steve said as the boy left. He turned back, looking at Sammy with a soft look.
"I know, baby. Once the nurse comes and checks you over, we can leave and you can sleep while we drive home, okay?" Steve soothed, petting at Peter's hair.
The blond had been in a dead sleep with his boys, waking when he felt a slight twinge, almost feeling like a switch being held down. He was just about to get up to check on Tony, feeling the baby start to stir anyway on his chest, when he heard the doorbell start to chime.
Two weeks had passed since the last drawing session, but Steve and Tony hung out as much as they could outside of their class schedules. They would pretty much just enjoy each other's company, talking to one another as if they had been friends since childhood.
"Pete fell asleep on the couch," He laughed, "So we should probably put him to bed.... Or something."
"Jus' bout. I've got two questions left to answer, but I figured I could finish it later." Peter hummed, snuggling closer. "I'm spending time with you two now."
"I'll help you through it if it happens, baby." Steve answered back before Tony left, getting up to find his laptop and head to their bedroom. He settled on the bed and waited for Tony before he'd look up anything.
"We'll find a balance, pip, I promise," Tony murmured, kissing the boy's cheek, "You're okay, no need to get upset. Tell you what. We'll move our schoolroom down to the lab, okay? That way we'll all be together and I can still get work done."
"I love you too-- and I got an idea. I betcha Pete would love to go stay overnight at Uncle Bucky and Auntie Natasha's place," Tony murmured, "I mean, we haven't been...
"We should build a tunnel between our bedrooms. You're right about the sex thing, let's fuck in the hallway," Tony growled, tugging Steve up and off the bed, "You're gonna be my little bitch tonight."
Steve rolled his eyes fondly at the other as he tried to roll onto his back, grunting as he managed and plopped back down on the pallet. He looked up at the other carefully, clearing his throat and breaking the other out of his thoughts.
"We should try to get away, in a few months," He murmured, "Go to a cabin in the recluse. Just you and me."
"I'm not slow, you're just too fast." Steve teased, finishing up packing things. He scooped Sammy up in his blanket and grabbed the baby bag. "Just so much to do at once, munchkin."
Tony could feel the arc reactor whirring quicker as his heartbeat sped up from the contact. It was soft and warm and simple, but such an intimate gesture in the moment that it took him by surprise. He was still a bit on edge from earlier, maybe that's why it affected him as much?
"'Kay, Daddy..." He hummed, looking up at Tony before wiggling carefully out of Tony's lap to head over and wash up. He stumbled a bit, still a little groggy, but got up okay.
"Well, Steve, I'm sure Tony knows that you're faithful," Peggy continued softly, a giggle still in her voice, "But with that kind of brain, who
Sorry if this chapter seems short. It runs parallel with the next chapter, as to even out the length with perspectives
, that's obvious," Tony snorted, taking some clamps to hold the cavity open, "But look, around the stomach and liver? Some of the fat has been cut away, as if harvesting that, rather than the organs. And, you can clearly see--"
"Go have fun, baby and I will set up lunch over there," he hummed, stealing a quick kiss from Steve.
. We'll work from home," Tony snorted, "I would build my lab in the basement, expand it a little. Fix up an art room for you to face the hills."
"So you could breathe the whole time?" Steve said carefully, raising a brow at the human. From what he knew, humans didn't do that in water.
"I know, but his relationship with you is like a father and son's." Steve pointed out, wrapping arms around Tony. "My relationship with him is like a
"Oh, I can be less nice," Tony replied, trying not to shiver at the Mister, "I can very well go to bed right now and not romp around."
"I don't know how you fancy a madman like him," Natalia spoke up, helping Steve pull the sheet back up over the body, "I find it.... strange."
Peter, automatically intrigued by the new toy, scrambled out of Tony's lap to climb up into Bucky's, gingerly picking up the teddy.
"Uh--Yeah! Yeah, it's, uh, it's my bot." Tony stuttered, and since when did he stutter? Probably when he is met with intimidatingly hot guys.
"Don't you even talk to me about being old, mister." Steve chuckled in a huff, giving Tony's hand a squeeze. He leaned up to kiss Tony softly, nuzzling his cheek. "You are far from old, babe."
"Being stubborn is just in the Rogers' genetics. It's just science." Steve joked quietly. "But they will be a well-mannered child as well. We're good like that." He preened, leaning in for another smooch.
"G'night, baby bear." Steve whispered, kissing Peter's forehead before turning the light off and cracking the door.
"Nah, buh Daddies awe boys 'n Mommies awe gir's." Peter pointed out as his pants were slipped on. "'N Papas awe Daddies so Papa's a boy. 'S sciense, Daddy."
"Yeah, no tummy aches munchkin. That wouldn't be good." Steve agreed, taking a careful bite of the cookie and enjoying the taste. It was his mom's recipe, and the taste always reminded him of Christmases as a kid. "Enjoy your cookies, Petey."
"You change the sheets, I'll... Deal with this," he mumbled, rubbing his face as he headed for the medical kit.
Tony reached out to grab at Steve's shirt, burying his face in the familiar warmth of the cashmere sweater.
"Hey--" Steve grinned, kissing him back and wrapping arms around his waist. "Sheets are in the wash, dinner's in the oven, and we have about 45 minutes to spend until it’s done. What would you like to do?"
"Mmkay," Peter kicked his legs back and forth happily, grabbing another sheet of paper to try and draw another cat.
He gulped down a breath, trying to coax himself down from his anxious state, shivering despite the warm covers. Steve moved and curled up around Tony carefully, hushing him gently to keep him relaxed.
"We are going to let the hurt go away for a couple of minutes. Then you are going to lay down on the bed for me. Still on your stomach."
"Well I worry when blood is involved, Pete." Steve sighed, ruffling the boy's hair. "Did you help keep Uncle Clint in line for us while we were gone?" He smirked.
Peter shook his head gently, holding his clothes as they headed towards the bathroom. "I can sit myselfs. Just need help with da rest."
"Partially. I like collars, like a whole fucking lot, but the way you react under my touch....it gave me an idea is all," Tony explained with a sheepish grin, "I think you'd really like it."
Tony carried him downstairs, setting him down in his usual chair before kissing his cheek, moving to help Steve make dinner.
"Better?" Steve asked to be sure. "You ready for ice cream? You can get whatever flavor you'd like, okay? And you can help me pick some for Daddy."
, I want this. More than I probably should, but I do." Tony replied, tugging Steve closer. "There is so much I want to show you, Steve. So much I want to be your first of and so much I want to make you feel. Its selfish, really. But I do want to take the time with you; help you discover what you want and what you like."
He slid down onto the couch next to Steve, drawing his legs up while he waited for everyone to get settled.
"He's just gonna fix you up a little." He explained. "Style your hair, help find some clothes that'll look good on you. And don't worry about the cost. I can easily cover it all." Tony finished with a wink as Raavi came back in the room, leading Steve quickly to follow him.
Tony swallowed his sobs, worming into Steve's warmth. He whimpered softly, acid-like guilt making his cuts throb on his legs.
Peter nodded and shoved cheerios in his mouth, eyes glued to Hannah Montana. With that, Tony trooped up to the art room, closing the door and locking it behind him.
"That'd be good." Peter said contently, resting his chin on Tony's chest and looking up at Tony for a moment. "You 'n Papa are still gonna read 'bout Spidahman to me 'fore bed, right?" He asked with doe eyes.
He started up the water and crouched down to help Peter out of his clothes, gently placing him in the warm water.
"I didn't know Clint sews. Even better if they're homemade." Steve mused happily. "And I'll work on that. We need to get it done as fast as we can without shirking the craftsmanship. Take Your Child to Work Day only lasts so long."
"I was actually thinking the same thing. Clothes would be good." Steve agreed softly, taking Tony's hand as they got up. "And you take the time you need to explain things. I'm not going to judge you for anything. Never judge you, love."
He took his time to strip himself down to his briefs, spreading Steve's legs before kneeling between them.
"Shh, Steve. Hey, I know. Its okay, baby." Tony said soothingly, petting the other's hair and kissing the top of the blond's head. "That's the beauty of this place. I've been able to keep an eye out on you. I'm
"I'm not stressing. Nope. No stress here. Cooool as a cucumber." The brunet huffed, giving the other a careful look. "Just be good, okay Aqua Man? Keep the doors locked, and if you need help with
"Getting the list done will be good, too. We can do it now while dinner is cooking, if you'd like to?"
"That's right. Top secret stuff. Steve chuckled, following the boy. "I'm going to go get ready, then we can set stuff up for when everyone shows up."
"Yup. Sure have, man." came the voice of the said owl, but instead a guy in a purple shirt and covered in bandages showed up out of nowhere and stopped beside Tony.
"Ewwwwww!" Peter shrieked with giggles, wriggling around back on the couch and covering his face with the blanket.
Making sure Steve wasn't behind him--and utterly failing--Peter spread out Sammy's blanket and gently set the baby up, then scooted over to the other side.
"Yeah, uh-huh," Tony scolded, crossing one leg over the other, "Anything you want to tell me, squirt?"
"Hiding behind the recliner," Tony grinned, "He wants me to squish you first, though. He thinks I can hold you down-- well, I can, we've proved that
"Well, we all know why we're here, so we might as well get down to it," Sharon hummed, flicking through the paperwork in front of her, "I'm a donor to an egg bank here in Milwaukee, and you all were chosen to have one of my eggs for conception. This, of course, means I won't be having intercourse with either of you, but rather, whichever wants to be the genetic father will send a sperm sample to the bank, whom will send both specimens to the hospital to be put through the fertility process, which will eventually be planted within me for gestation."
"Maybe, but I'm your nerd." He chuckled, stepping back to see. "Not bad. Might fix it in little spots, but I have to do that on yours, too." He hummed, moving in to draw the letter high in between them.
"I'm not going to do that, Tony. The whole commitment means a lot more than a ring." Steve said softly, trying to keep his voice from breaking. He was afraid of where this conversation was heading. "It means we stick by each other, and that is what I damn well plan to do as long as you let me. I know I can't stop you from hurting completely, but I can at least try to lessen it the best I can. But you have to let me, babe. Please..." He thunked his head against the wall pitifully, clearing his throat. "Can you let me in? ...May I come in?"
"Honey, I'm thinking you're forgetting I'm a billionaire. You never have to work again, if you don't want to," Tony replied gently, drawing circles onto Steve's chest, "But that's up to you. As soon as I get some stuff settled, we can go house looking. I know a place I've been looking at that's a bit out of the main city, big neighborhood, three story Tudor with a basement--"
Steve hummed into him contently. "You can lay on top of me completely, though...?" He offered up, leaning into Tony's touches.
The stylist looked between Tony and Steve with a small sense of shock on his face before lightly grabbing Steve by the shoulders.
"I'll go start the coffee early," Tony laughed weakly, smooching Steve's cheek, "Keep his toothbrush out, and-- oh my god, I betcha I have one of Pep's hairbands around here, we can put his hair back."
It’s a bit difficult, given his size; But he tries. Steve is very good at body language, despite what people seem to think of his social skills – or lack of –, because he relied on body language almost his entire life. He was small, and everything he did was to make himself look bigger and taller. He knows how to make himself look imposing. And now he is so big, doing the opposite and attempting to make himself look smaller is almost like a challenge, not only physical but mental, a position he feels so uncomfortable in, but he had to learn how to do it, out of necessity.
Sam flinches and his entire body deflates like a balloon, and he has to change position to regain his footing, lowering his voice as if he’s afraid to talk about it out loud. “Are you serious?” Steve nods, and Sam takes a step back as if he’d slapped him. “
Tony usually loves when things start to makes sense, but now, he really, really doesn’t like it. He can still argue that Vision’s nature has nothing to do with him, and everything to do with Thor – the hammer thing was more than enough proof for him, even if Thor would disagree. But
Thor reaches for the nearest table, and he grabs a wrench and a screwdriver seemingly at random, holding them in his fists as visual aids, as if he cannot fathom any other way to demonstrate what he’s trying to say.
“I don’t understand.” Lang admits, thankfully before Tony has any chance to react negatively to any of this
“It’s my son anyway, Jarvis.” Maria all but pleads, sitting beside Jarvis in a chair she pulls up to herself. “Please, try to understand. I miss him too much. You do too, I know you do, Jarvis. Anthony was like a son to you, we all know it. You took care of him like he was your own.”
“Vision, Sam, and Wanda. King T’Challa, too.” Rhodey tells Lang, all posturing or hints of authority completely gone, voice carried only with loss and dread. “They didn’t make it.”
“Why.” Tony asks, in a childish tone. “Why would she do that, I mean, what was so important that she would have to call you?”
Sam considers him for a moment, thoughtful, and then nods in agreement, content; Like Steve has given him the answer he wanted to hear.
Tony runs his hand over Dum-E’s and U’s arms unconsciously, feeling the cool touch of the metal beneath his fingertips, pretending the feel of the smoothness of the polished plates isn’t ruined by the scratches and cuts on his palms. He’s so distracted by it he almost misses the sound of boots stepping closer, going around the foam he recklessly stepped into on his haste, slow like a predator circling its’ prey.
“Sorry, I’ll be right there.” He yells back, sounding a bit too frantic, and he’s absolutely sure Maria can hear it in his tone.
to do, what he had wanted – wanted for so long, for years, hopelessly fantasizing about this moment because he couldn’t
“He spent years chasing his mission. Now he doesn’t have any.” Tony explains. “The next thing he’ll do is find another.”
“New York.” Tony hazily remembers, after a long, long struggle to think over his haze, trying to keep himself focused, to no avail. But New York seems like the right answer, right? New York is home. Pepper is in New York—
“What happened?” Nebula asks, sounding actually very concerned, but Tony shakes his head, and squeezes his eyes shut again, a grimace tight on his face, fighting the urge to let tears spill out so hard it gives him a headache.
Rocket must see something in his face that’s telling enough of Tony’s thoughts, because he scoffs and interrupts right off, even if a little awkward, aiming for irreverence but not quite making it. “Listen, I know we’re not ones to talk, but she does have a point on this.”
“Not in a while.” He says, carefully, his words precisely enunciated and evenly paced, as an orator would speak to a stranger in the audience. “Mr. Stark has been very busy, or so I’m told.”
that interrupts. The raccoon, and Tony still can’t quite grasp that this is truly happening, no matter how many weird things he has seen during his years as a goddamned superhero; The raccoon finally pushes himself off his lean on the wall and walks closer, his stride surprisingly confident for someone that can only look so menacing being so short and…
as soon as he’s able to, because there is nothing that could have stopped him from reaching out to the best friend he thought he lost forever less than a few hours ago. There isn’t a single force in this universe, no matter how powerful or vengeful, that could have stopped them from being reunited.
, and Nebula isn’t worried or angry about anything – not any more than she seems to be on a regular basis –, so it all went well, it looks like. But at the same time…
“You can imagine my surprise,” Thor emphatically says, almost as if he’s daring Tony to contradict him, words drawing out in a knowing tone. “When I was told you arrived from space – when you shouldn’t even have survived, given your conditions –, but you did, and you had a woman with you, a
He doesn’t want to think about rights and wrongs now. Now it is too late. The Accords already exist, and Scott has already signed them. He is already beyond their reach. The only thing Steve wants now is to
A movement at the periphery of his vision draws his attention, and he realizes that all this time his bots have been standing right there, behind him. Surprisingly quiet. He had almost forgotten they were there. Tony looks at them and thinks, sorrowful, that he wishes he’d come home to a happy reunion. He wishes he could shrug off the weight that he feels like he’s dragging with him at every step, grab himself a cup of scalding hot coffee and head down to the workshop with them, throwing jokes into the air and pulling up screens with plans and schematics, immersing himself into work as if this day was just another day in his life.
“Wanna head down with me?” He asks, in good nature, the previous interaction all but forgotten, it seemed. “Pepper’s downstairs with the Agents. Let’s go over some plans and make sure they can handle it all before we settle into working on Thanos full-time.”
So long Tony has been haunted by this, by the idea that something out there was coming to get them, descending from space to kill them all, and every single day had been a struggle to get over his panic attacks and his paranoia, to try to be better, to
. “It was safer to threaten them, than to leave you exposed. I didn’t give them an opening, not for one second.”
The air gets stuck in Tony’s lungs, his entire body dead still and stone cold, suspended in time, like the second before a bomb explodes—
So he stops. He stops, and looks away, and he feels small and defeated, because how else can he feel after having lost something so important? How can he express his painfully acute awareness that he had no right to impose himself on Peter’s life like he did, but he did it anyways, or how Peter shouldn’t have admired him, but he had, and Tony had never felt so proud, of anyone or anything in this world, as he had when he saw the kid after the Vulture had been captured, when Tony finally understood just how deep and how complete Peter’s genuine

Ms. Carter purses her lips ever so slightly, pondering, looking over at the computer – at Tony – with a mildly unconvinced but pensive expression.
He would’ve done it, if he thought he could. He would have fixed everything. And every time he realizes he
“What?” Rocket asks, baffled, and Tony’s shoulders move in a motion that’s supposed to be a shrug, but it stutters, and it falters, as if he’s trembling.
Which means that it’ll drain Tony’s energy faster, which will cause the armor to fail faster, and make the mesh particles recede faster. And it’ll kill him. But if they go too slow, the residual titanium levels will start to poison him from the inside out, and it’ll kill him, or he might simply bleed out anyway.
Tony doesn’t react. He just stares at Steve, and Steve stares back, because he’s weak, because he’s a fool, and he’s been reduced to ache for any crumbs of attention Tony Stark might give him, to fruitlessly hope that he somehow will find a chance to make things right again, even though all evidence says otherwise.
By the fourth month, Steve could feel the way his jaw hurt whenever he looked at the phone, an almost imperceptive grinding of his teeth, the feeling of something dark and ugly growing deep in his guts, something that made him feel
Now, for another matter: Remember that gift fic I mentioned in the last chapter? You can vote for which prompt is going to be based on now!
. “The goal is to transform them into something that an entire team would approve of, before the document would be presented to any individual outside our initiative. It has been said by the UN that they have intentions of transforming the Accords into a base system which other countries can reach for help as they develop their first laws intended for the protection on superhuman individuals, but this won’t happen until the original Accords are
Tony stares at her, paralyzed in despair, and as she stares back, the iron-clad resolve that burns bright behind them is terrifying, and Tony can’t look away.
He thinks of the night that Mark 42 responded to his distress in his sleep and attacked Pepper, and she left – and the argument they had over it not too soon after.
“Why would the Stone talk to us if it hated us while Ultron had it? Or Wanda, or whoever it was?” Barton asks, crossing his arms and shrugging, incredulous.
“The star is surrounded by a circular structure meant to harness its power.” Thor explains, making a spherical shape with his hands in an explanatory gesture. “When the door to the structure is open, the beams that escape through it light up the forge and melt the metal.”
for Tony’s heart just to squeeze tight with a wave of complicated feelings, a rush of warmth mixing in with wariness, the lines between all the different personas Natasha has presented to him since they first met blurring together like words smudging in ink across a page.
“Where are you?” Rhodey presses, completely undeterred by Tony’s dark humor. “Tell me right now, I’ll come to you,
He cries because he feels like he has lost a part of himself with Peter, a hole gaping inside his chest in a shape no one else can fill, the space between his arms still feeling hollow and empty even as Pepper occupies the space with her own frame. Tony feels like his hands are still stained with his ashes. His muscles want to squeeze around a person who is no longer there, to comfort and be comforted by someone that can’t be reached, and he mourns, he mourns for the kid he loved so much he thought of like his own, the kid who made him wish for
what this ship can do besides fly and shoot stuff, apparently, because he can’t recognize the symbols that make up its main structure, but for now, it is enough. From what he can guess from the graphs on the screen, there is enough fuel – Energy? Not exactly fuel, but not electric force either. Something else, something that lodges itself at the back of his brain for later inspection, even when Tony tells himself he will refuse to think about this day for a very, very long time – to last for a long trip, hopefully long enough until they can reach Earth.
FRIDAY adjusts the projection almost immediately – the Tesseract becomes a miniature, much easier to manipulate, and it gets pushed to the left when a horizontal line cuts through the board like a spear, the number
The flashing images before his eyes, much like the lights of the HUD, are familiar and hypnotic, and he reads paragraphs and theories and debates of all sorts of areas and specialists, from ecologists to astrophysicists, and interprets graphs and readings as fast as he can, until his head aches, until he has no less than four theoretical outcomes, one bleaker than the other, a thousand of concerns, and not single one simple solution.
“We need safe houses.” Tony adds, his spine still tingling with the nagging leftover sensation of Rogers’ stare trickling down his back, the wary feeling of not getting the whole picture when it’s right there, but he ignores the uncomfortable sensation for now, in favor of more pressing matters. “Can’t put them in just any building ‘cause we don’t know which buildings are safe.”
We, meaning him, Natasha, and Clint – but that’s ridiculous because Cap is just standing here not doing anything!
loaded, even when her reply is reasonable enough. “The medics who tended to you did. They screamed at you when you passed out, on the way to the operation. They called you Iron Man.”
, and gets closer, speaking for the first time since they all gathered here, seemingly unable to hold himself back any longer even for his grief.
The possibility of losing the bots by Thanos’ hands had never been real, he knows this. They hadn’t been under any sort of danger, like everyone else had.
This is… This is one of those nights. The nights where Steve’s hands itch for the need to grip something as hard as he can, making sure he’ll keep himself grounded, for his thoughts seem to go so far away he can’t be sure his body isn’t being dragged along with them. The nights he regrets he can’t forget, because now he has to live with what he has done and with what he has
You came here for an Avengers reunion? Well. Here it is - And all the emotional baggage that comes with it.
He makes a noise that’s supposed to be a thoughtful hum, but sounds choked and tight, like a repressed sob, and not for the first time, Tony regrets that he even woke up at all today, wishing he had stayed in bed, asleep, with Pepper in his arms for the rest of his life.
Bruce exhales sharply, shaking his head. “My guess is… He didn’t want to be pushed back again. You know? He… He spent two years on the driver’s seat and
“And you can replicate it.” Rogers says, not as a question, but an affirmation. Tony nods. “You think the Tesseract might work in a similar way?”
Does it soothe my heart completely, after what Civil War has done to us? No, it doesn't. And I suspect it doesn't for you, either. You might have gotten all the way down here with maybe some small amount of relief that Steve is finally more aware of the consequences of his actions and his guilt - but there is still a little bitterness at the back of your tongue, isn't there? Because at the end of the day, Steve learns but doesn't give in. He changes, but we ache to see him act on that change. It's better, but it's not enough.
Tony shrugs, and bites his lip, shifting his weight from foot to foot just to keep himself doing the slightest bit of movement – dreading that, if he stays still, he might actually start crying again.
Her breath hitches when she grazes the bandages, the texture foreign to touch, and she looks at his belly with unconcealed terror.
“What reason would he have to run to Sokovia after he destroyed the Tower?” Rhodey says, rhetorically. “I’m just saying – he could have built his murder-trap anywhere in world. He could have built it in the Tower, to spite you. But he didn’t. Instead, he chose to go back, and find Wanda and her brother to convince them to fight with him against you. Do

They’ve got this all wrong, it’s the only explanation. He knows – he knows he was the one who said that they should stay together, and should be careful, and all of that, but it
And then it flickers in a burst of light, something quick and energized that Tony feels all the way down to the marrow of his bones, a pulse of energy running through every single spot of his body where a tracking chip of the suit is hidden underneath his skin – oh God, will it fry it all? –, the compartment whirs and glows – it’ll
“Just got home.” Natasha says, but offers no extra explanation. “And Steve is always up by this hour. He went running.”
“I mean, c’mon.” Stark says, shrugging, looking around the destroyed Shawarma place like he’s exasperated. “It’s not like you guys would be leaving a five-star hotel if you ditched your current landlords and just came back with me. And also, to be fair, the Tower
Tony takes in a breath, feeling, suddenly, like he’s walking on eggs, and he doesn’t like it. “Alright – I’m gonna need you to explain this to me like I’m a five-year-old, because I’m not
“We both had a rough time.” Steve interrupts, gently, and Tony gives him a silent nod. “I know it. But I think we both could use a win now, couldn’t we?”
That's not even all of it. There are so many details I couldn't include here because they would never be explored in Steve's POV. Natasha's and T'Challa's condradictory decisions being my main concern, honestly, but not the
“You want something?” Tony interrupts, as politely as he can manage without losing the hard steel in his tone, feeling immediately caged even though Thor barely gave two steps forward into the workshop. “I assume FRIDAY told you I was here.”
Tony could have chosen to tell her about the Palladium. About his PTSD. He could have told her, even if in the end she did end up finding out. He hadn’t needed to give the Mandarin his home address. He hadn’t needed to make so many suits, or make the Iron Legion. There were other heroes, after New York. Other heroes who worked as heroes full-time, not like Tony, who had a job, a billion-dollar company to take care of, and a girlfriend clearly uneasy with the consequences of his superhero gig. Tony wouldn’t have passed down the mantle, not while he was still able to fight – but as far as everyone else was concerned, the Iron Legion wasn’t necessary. Ultron wasn’t necessary. Tony had just been paranoid, and obsessed, and he had all chances to step back, to not get involved in the higher-risk missions, and he never
“That’s why I reached out!” Steve yells, actually yells this time, using the full capacity of his lungs, because, because—It doesn’t matter why! “What happened was a mistake! This whole thing was a mistake! I was trying to fix it!”
Howard raises his head from the contracts he’s going over, more on instinct than actually paying attention, and then he realizes he actually hasn’t hear a word Maria said. “What?”
From the way her eyes look sad when her gaze flickers in the direction of the bright blue light in Tony’s chest, Tony is
“She couldn’t do that. That was never within the range of her powers. I mean – I’m not sure how Wanda’s powers worked, Thor, but she never demonstrated any kind of… prophetic tendencies. I don’t know what you saw, but…”
to see him. It does. It feels like he’s been gutted with a dull knife, a feeling unlike any other wound Steve has ever gotten, something that echoes from so far within that he can’t even pinpoint its source. It’s like it reverberates from his very
It's like his bones are made of cheap plastic. How ironic, he thinks, as Nebula’s metal hand closes itself around his bruised forearm, and the pressure on the giant bruise there makes him flinch, just a little bit.
“It’s not an accurate prediction but it’s a safe one.” Bruce tries to clarify, but if his intention is to sound comforting, he fails miserably at it. “To assume it would be any longer could be dangerous. It’s not a good time-frame, but I believe it’s the best we’ve got.”
Steve and Tony both froze at the new voice and turned to see Natasha, paused mid-step in the archway to the complete mess that used to be the kitchen. Not missing a beat and not bothering to let either man explain themselves, she gracefully stepped around the splats of puree and whisked the applesauce-coated Peter from his high chair, who giggled gleefully at the sight of his favourite aunt.
Steve sighed; there was just no pleasing his son. A jar of baby food in one hand and a spoonful of mush in the other, Rogers was sitting alone at the kitchen table trying to get Peter to eat something. Other random jars were set on the table, the one in his hand being about the fifth he had offered to the child.
He glanced at Tony, his jaw set and his eyes full of agony. “I’m going to be at the old Brooklyn apartment.
Steve looked up to see Tony walking in, clad in a black muscle shirt and worn jeans, wiping his hands on an old grease rag.
No reply came as the device flared to life. There was no painful electric shock, much to Stark’s surprise, but his armour was faltering.
His thoughts were interrupted by the harsh ringing of his cell phone. Sighing, Steve rummaged through his bag until he found it and pressed the green ‘talk’ button.
When the shaking subsided and the tears were slowing, Steve pulled back from Tony. Slowly, cautiously, he gently tipped Tony’s chin up and placed a soft kiss on his chapped lips. Tony froze momentarily but soon kissed back, matching Steve’s tenderness at first but desperation quickly took over. He was afraid that at any moment Steve would melt away, that maybe this was simply another one of the twisted dreams that woke him so often in the middle of the night. Their hands roamed, running along muscle, beneath shirts, over familiar scars, not in a fit of pleasure, but to reassure themselves that the other was there, that this was
Steve, meanwhile, grasped the back of Tony’s head and supported him so he wouldn’t have to lean down as far. His free hand roamed down Tony’s bare chest and pinched a nipple which, much to his delight, caused a brief groan to slip from Tony’s lips.
,” Steve winced at that, “I wish I could just hate you. I wish I could beat the living daylights out of you for all of this and it would be over. I wish I could blame you for tossing your wedding band at my feet and leaving me that night.”
He hadn’t realized that he had stayed silent. “Uh, yes. I’ll be there right away. Is there a situation?” He began gathering his things, sliding the busted bags in their designated spot. Since he’d started coming to that gym, he’d made a bit of an arrangement with the staff; he would pay extra for all of the punching bags he’d need and they had them repaired or discarded. All of his actions stopped, however, when he heard Coulson’s next words:
He ran a hand through his hair and sighed, reaching for the bottle of gin. He was about to pour another glass but stopped himself and gently set it back down. He slumped into his chair and rested his head in his hands. A soft whirring and a nudge at his side alerted him to DUM-E's presence. The bot chirped quietly and poked at his master's hand. Tony looked over and placed a gentle hand on him.
At that moment, Steve’s eyes flew open and he stared up at Tony, the billionaire’s lust reflected in those baby blues.
Steve was stung by Tony’s words, but he let them pass. “No, that’s not it at all. Yes, I was told about…this,” he made a vague gesture, “but I was out the door before they could even think about giving me an order. I’m here of my own volition.” Tony gave something of a scoff, but Steve continued.
The small voice of the child was dwarfed amid the surrounding chaos and destruction in the Rogers-Stark house, but Steve and Tony heard it all too clearly. Tony blasted away another masked goon and rushed toward his son’s cry. His faceplate had been ripped away, however, and a well-aimed punch had him suddenly staggering. He shook his head and made to strike back when something that resembled a high-tech cattle prod jammed itself into the chest plate, just below the arc reactor.
“Num num,” Peter babbled, and opened his mouth for more even before Tony had the chance to get another spoonful.
"You present yourself to me the moment I get home and you perform so well for me…surely you didn’t expect me to leave you unattended?”
Steve was already rushing down the hall to get his suit and shield, likewise, Tony ran to the lab for his armour.
Steve just chuckled and silenced his husband with a kiss, pulling him close. Tony made a pleased noise and ran a hand down Steve’s back, before sliding it underneath his shirt to feel his warm, bare skin.
He was fully turned to face Steve now. His eyes were ringed by massive dark circles as though he hadn’t slept in weeks. His clothing was a wrinkled mess and his face was filled with pain, anguish, and self-hatred. His eyes were threatening to water, though it was clear that tears had already come and gone many times, and his lower lip trembled only slightly. Steve’s heart broke at the sight; he just wanted to take Tony in his arms and tell him it would be okay, that he would never let him go. He held himself back however, for he knew that the situation was far too precarious for any sudden action.
Peter’s voice was weak and he seemed out of breath. The husbands froze when they heard the pain and exhaustion clearly in his voice.
He rushed forward to the fallen man, who was groaning in pain, and snatched Peter out of his grasp, picking up his shield as well. The boy clung desperately to his father’s chest and as Steve held his arm protectively around him, holding the shield in front of him with his other arm. Sensing a presence behind him, Steve whirled around and made to strike with the edge of the shield, but a gloved hand caught it. He was surprised, but even more so when the Other, in an oddly intact and crisp black pinstripe suit, began pushing back against Cap’s super strength. The Other smirked behind his black full-face mask, as if he was toying with him, and gave a rough shove on the shield. It was as though Steve had been hit in the shoulder by Thor, the force was so great and he stumbled backwards, trying to keep his balance. He turned to the side, keeping Peter away from the man, but the Other had just calmly walked forward during Steve’s moment of distraction and proceeded to grab him by the throat, lift him off the ground and slam him into the nearest wall. Steve’s head and spine took the direct brunt of the impact and it left him jarred as he gasped for the air cut off by the Other’s tightening grip on his throat. Before he had a chance to think, the Other had plucked Peter from his grip and threw Steve into the ground, hand still wrapped around his throat.
They are inside the Quinjet in less than ten minutes, and Sam is flying them in the direction of the city as fast as he can.
– bite him in the ass someday. Tony’s playboy days had been long gone when he first met her, but that wasn’t the point, was it? Is just that she was
But Steve is stubborn. So damn stubborn. He has too many mixed feelings about Tony, about his team breaking apart, and having all of them here
He can see the whole extent of the wing, jutting out from the body, where the white paint creates a sharp, terrible contrast to the black soot that covers the cabin. It went through half of the third floor, taking down walls and windows, destroying the interior, and who knows what else it was inside.
It started somewhere around his fight with Natasha. Hell, it might’ve started even earlier than that and he didn’t realize, because he was so angry and so on edge it simply hadn’t occurred to him—
Pepper lets out a sob, that drags and scratches her throat from the sound of it, the dry heaving and the shallow breath, and she covers her mouth with her hand and turns around to hide her face, but not fast enough that Tony can’t see the way her eyes well up with tears, not fast enough that he doesn’t see the pain he’s causing her, that it won’t haunt him until the day he dies.
“Stark.” Thor calmly says. “I know this is hard for you. But we have to do it. If the Stone tried to say something through Maximoff, it could have tried to say something through any other host it had, and if we know how to use it, we have a better chance of winning.”
“Even if it’s to save someone.” She amends, firmly. “Even then. Promise me you won’t put yourself on the line if there’s any other way to do what you need to do.”
wrong. It is wrong for us to act so carelessly, that’s the whole thing that got us into this mess, but... I should have done something. I’ve been working alone for the past two years, I should know better.”
It’s just a language barrier. Tony knows this. But Tony is stressed and now they actually might have something more concrete to work with, written in these books they cannot read, and the world is going dark again and Tony feels like it’s swallowing him whole.
the guy’s chest is when Tony accidentally hist him when he raises his arm to stop him, ow. No way. He’s definitely more concerned about the tiny food stand right across the street, another idea sparking in his head.
“It’s what it’ll take to destroy most of surviving crops. Whatever’s left of the animal population after that will follow quickly.”
Because someone might try to put them side by side and see what picture they form. If they make sense, if compared. And that's exactly what we're gonna do.
His mouth clicks shut so hard it’s a surprise he doesn’t wince, jaw locking up and shoulders squaring up, eyes boring into Steve so intensely it’s almost like they could burn holes through him, like the repulsors in his armor. He’s bare and vulnerable, just in a T-shirt and what looks like dark gray tracksuit pants, eyes sunken in with exhaustion and unkempt appearance, a frenzied, restless look he knows matches their own after so many hours without sleep, but somehow, this is the most guarded Steve has ever seen him. He looks like—
“And you will take it back.” Nebula affirms, full of conviction, and Tony doesn’t have the heart to tell her how wrong she is, because he just
“It’s nothing, really.” Tony laughs a little. “It might even help me get back on a regular schedule, for once. Eating, sleeping, and whatnot.”
We are almost at the end now! I hope you guys are excited for that. For now, I'd like to thank everyone who has been so incredibly supportive so far, you guys make my day with your lovely comments and your theories, and I am incredibly thankful for your support. Once more, I encourage you to stop by and let me know your thoughts, your headcanons, theories, or whatever the hell you feel like talking about after you read this fic. I'm always very interested in learning more about it.
Tony sees, through hazy eyes and with gasping breaths, that Rhodey is stepping off the jet and running in his direction, and Tony wants to run towards him too, but his legs feel stuck, like he has no joints, a mannequin about to dismantle itself on the floor, his thighs and calves so tense and stiff he might give himself a cramp even if he’s just
Tony lets out a shuddering sigh, running his hand over his mouth and chin in an effort to keep himself silent, the pressure on his lips as a reminder to keep them closed. He feels a hand touch his shoulder, a brief, fleeting comfort, awkward and uncertain, but
” Tony rasps, opening his hands to wildly gesture in vague directions of the room, as if the chaos was there, as if it had followed them home – and in a way, it had. “This, that just happened? That crowd, out there, that is
And it’s tone in which he says it that makes Wanda turns to him suddenly, frowning, her tone unsure. “You’re leaving already?”
“The Ancient One had many books she favored, such as the old notes of Agamotto, the first person on this world to ever use the Time Stone and discover its power. Her private collection is considered too advanced for anyone but the most powerful Masters of the Mystic Arts, but given the circumstances, I’ll allow you to check it if you wish.” Wong gives a quick turn back merely to give them an approving look, before going even deeper into the room and descending a small set of stairs, that frankly are very small for such a large group to be following, and Tony suspects they are not meant to be here at
“Yeah.” Tony says, and it comes off a bit muffled, lips pressed against her head. “Better now that you’re here.”
There you have it, friends. Do you see where I'm going with this? I feel like this needs to be adressed, despite the MCU's obvious reluctance to face head on the problem they've created (or really, problems, in plural), but we're not playing their game here. It's a bit hard to keep track, but if you decide to watch the movies again very closely, you will notice that there is a lot that we know, but the Avengers don't. And this is such a heavy weight for us to carry, letting it affect our views and our opinions of their actions without allowing the characters to deal with them on their own, demanding trust when they only have half of the story to tell.
“And it stayed there, until Ragnarok arrived.” Thor informs, sounding forlorn, his eyes still locked onto Loki’s picture in the board.
Maybe that’s just his mind being nitpicky. Trying to find reasons to make itself believe he is, in fact, just
He steps closer, and then he realizes that in front of this crowd, talking amongst themselves, are Pepper, Rhodey, Rogers, and two other people. Tony doesn’t get a good look on their faces from where he’s standing, but even before he can try to get a glimpse, he steps close enough to attract attention, and someone in the crowd notices him. And slowly, they all do.
While Rhodey is still on the line, Tony glances over at Nebula for a brief second before making an impulsive decision and saying, “Please don’t come in guns blazing. I have a friend over.”
Clint’s words still ring fresh on his mind, a worry that he had pushed far back into forgotten corners of his psyche now out in the open and they are raw and bleeding and hurting, and Steve doesn’t dare to touch them, doesn’t want to give them any more power over him – but they take it anyway, the flood over his attempts of deflection with no trouble at all, drowning him in the inevitability of his own haunting.
Steve chuckles too, although what he’s feeling is something more akin to hysteria than actual humor, but he doesn’t think it makes a difference. “Yeah.” He agrees, the words flowing out of him before he can think about them, his whole façade just crumbling at Bucky’s feet, leaving him completely unguarded. “The team was… They were in a rough spot. I went to get them out.”
, from seven different points in the same room. No, Tony doesn’t want to deal with that right now. He’s hating himself enough for now without the added commentary from the third parties.
, who’s right and who’s wrong and they will never find the common ground if they never admit they are wrong—
But it is, isn’t it? Tony is the reason why this is happening the way it is, the reason why Steve refuses to talk about the things that hurt him the most, the reason why he might have pushed Natasha away for good now. After everything they have done together, ever since their first battle – her jumping on his shield, following him through a mission that would destroy everything she once thought she stood for, betraying others to go to him,
Like his nanite compartment. Maybe, if Tony tries a little harder, if he pushes himself a little further, he can find a way out of this, the same way he found a way out of that cave ten years ago.
Steve is sitting at the table, looking at some projections of 3D maps and energy readings, comparing to all the news of recent events they could find, when—
He could only imagine what it must be like, to share your body and half your mind with someone else, someone that’s not quite you, a someone you can’t control and is known for doing stuff you will regret. Even worse to know that someone
, the only name Antonio knows him for, is a frankly impressive man. He is tall where Antonio already is considered somewhat small, his hair is the color of sand and his eyes are a startling blue. A rare color in the South, but far more common here, from what Antonio can see in his husband’s company. His stature is imposing, but not as much as his width, shoulders so large that the fur laid on them does nothing to disguise how broad they are, just as his hands are big, from that Antonio could see, when they first met – when the Captain guarded his weapon of choice, a
Yes, CW is still relevant, even after the snap. What, did you think I would let it go, like the MCU has? No, friend. The MCU might be done, as they have no other use for it anymore, but I am not. And we will talk about it, extensively and carefully.
, side by side; Wanda, with her eyes rimmed red and shiny, her cheeks still damp from the tears, and Vision’s hand resting in her forearm, holding her gently, a touch so soft that feels far too intimate for a friend.
“I guess we have no choice.” Rocket mumbles, and jumps off the table. “We should check in on the ship, make sure Ant-Guy didn’t do any more damage than he says he did. If we gettin’ batteries, I wanna make sure she’s in at least good enough shape.”
“I got Space.” Rocket informs, going as far as to raise a finger awkwardly, looking distinctly uncomfortable when everyone throws him a considering look. “And Nebula got Soul.”
“God, Rogers.” Tony says exasperatedly, and it’s ruined by the smile that stretches so wide across his face that it hurts his cheeks. “You’re lucky you’re pretty, or else I’d let you starve.”
“Tell me you’re lying!” He screams, as Nebula closes her eyes and turns her head to the side, trying to hide her face from the screams. “No!”
So, he sits at the back, beside Nebula and Pepper, both of them already geared up for action, Nebula with her electric batons and Pepper in her armor – her armor, dear God, Tony almost gets whiplash every time he thinks about it, the sheer absurdity of it  –, and he lets the sound of the turbines drown out his voice as he asks for FRIDAY to pull up some research papers about environmental imbalance, studies on the effects of extinction of species in food chains, ozone depletion, solar radiation management, global dimming, the goddamned winter that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs – Anything he can think of that involves similar key elements, hoping he can somehow form a puzzle that fits, a projection that will allow him to measure the effects of the attack, the
“Hmm…” Tony leaned back and raised his eyes to the ceiling, poorly feigning pensiveness. “I think I’d rather sacrifice a few hours sleep to enjoy an early Christmas present.”
Tony began to make noises of protest as Steve pulled away, but stopped immediately when Steve’s hands began to work at Tony’s pants and he shifted and moved lower until he was settled in between Tony’s legs with his head above his crotch. Tony sighed contentedly and leaned his head back as his dick was freed from the rough fabric and he gasped when Steve licked the underside of it.
Steve took a shaky breath and ran a hand through his blonde hair, “He said…he said that while Peter’s condition is stable, they don’t know when he’ll come out of the coma and they don’t have any way to bring him out of it.”
“Tony?” A gentle hand on his shoulder jolted the iron man back into the present. He turned to see a worried Steve holding two cups of hot coffee, one balanced on top of the other.
“You know as well as I do that I wouldn’t be out here if I didn’t care at least a little. Tony…just come off of there a-and we can talk, or you can yell at me, punch me, whatever you want. So please Tony…” He had turned to pleading, he was desperate. He was offering Tony anything he could think of at the moment.
Tony nodded before crawling into bed next to Steve. “Yep, he’s all tucked in and cuddled up with his Hulk plush; though we seriously need to talk about that and get him an Iron Man stuffie…”
Steve just smirked, an evil glint in his eyes, and tipped the jar just the slightest, causing its contents to pour in Tony’s hair and down his face and neck. Tony scrunched his face at the feeling of the cold and weird textured stuff, especially as some of it wormed its way down the back of his shirt. He flailed, trying to get out of his husband’s vice-grip while Steve just howled with laughter.
The words were so quiet, but so pain-filled. They were merely a whisper but they might as well have been a scream for all that they pierced Tony to the core. He tried to explain, “I wasn’t in my right mind Steve. I had more drinks than I usually do and-”
While Steve carried him out of the kitchen, Tony’s mind raced as he lustfully imagined wall-sex and couldn’t stop a slightly disappointed noise from escaping his lips as Steve dropped him on the couch. His displeasure was short-lived, however, when the good Captain climbed on top of Tony and straddled him. He leaned down and undid Tony’s tie completely, letting the ends of it slip slowly from his fingers. He then pushed Tony’s grey suit jacket open and began to work at the buttons on his red dress shirt, kissing the skin as he exposed it.
Steve hadn’t realized it, but his punches had become significantly more erratic and violent and he soon found himself punching at air and stumbling from the force of his unstopped swing. Surprised, he looked down to see the bag on the floor, and when he felt a bit more pain than normal in his hands he found that he had worn the tape down and they were bleeding. He sighed and ran one bloody appendage through his hair, grabbing an already damp towel with the other and dried his face and neck.
Steve heard him take a breath, “He’s not wearing his suit, Steve. I don’t know if he took it off after he got up there or what. Either way, the only thing he has is an arm attachment to keep us away.”
“She…she was calling out for her daddy.  She was stuck in a crushed car and the ceiling was going to collapse. I-I couldn’t just leave her Pop…” he gasped hoarsely.
Tony sighed heavily as he closed the door behind him. Really, he didn’t understand why Pepper needed him to go to all of these Stark Industries meetings; she
“Woah, slow down buddy,” Steve placed his hands soothingly on Peter’s shoulders. “Now, how about we get this cleaned up and see if we have some more cookies hidden in the cupboard, hm?”
Tony had never seen Cap like this, and all he could do was pull his head into his lap and cradle it gently as Steve had done for him so many times before.
Steve was frozen during the entire speech and it took him a while to find his voice. When he finally spoke, it was with trembling words.
When he finally reached the floor Coulson had indicated, he went into the first room he came across and clambered out the window. A little more cautious now, Steve looked around frantically for Tony, easing his way along the side of the building. When he heard the soft sound of a melody being softly sung, relief washed through Steve, but only momentarily when he finally spied the other man around the corner. Tony was perched on one of the gargoyle-like eagle heads protruding beyond the edge of the tower. He sat with one leg crooked upright, his right arm resting on top of his knee. It looked as though he was surveying the city, the way he was slightly bent.
"Little bit lower." Tony managed to marshal enough energy to provide directions. "There's a hidden catch just under the jaw, on the side there, just wide enough for a couple fingers. You'll feel it. Press in and up, like you're lifting it out."
And with that, he climbed onto the bed, straddling Steve's legs, sitting down on his thighs, pressing him down into the mattress. Sure, Steve had the strength to lift him, or to throw him off if he wanted, but an extra couple hundred pounds was definitely going to increase that glorious agony he was currently feeling. Steve was trembling. His cock was so hard that Tony wondered if the slightest touch would set him off. With all the good cheer that only the opportunity for really excellent sadism could ever give him, Tony grinned down at Steve, proceeded to ignore Steve's cock entirely, and instead slid his hands up Steve's stomach to pinch his nipples, as Steve cried out and twisted beneath him.
"The only people these jackals are listening to anymore are each other," Jan spat out. "It's an echo chamber. I'm not saying we should stoop to their level, but I think we should meet them where they are. They won't stop if we just hold a press conference defending Tony and Iron Man. They don't care about our press conferences." Her jaw was set, like she was getting ready to step onto the battlefield. "I say we go on one of their shows, one of us. We're Avengers. We've got the truth on our side. We beat them at their own game."
He breathes and breathes and goes under, down to the sweet place inside him where time has no meaning. He thinks, dimly, that he doesn't deserve this, but he doesn't care. He's nothing. He's gone.
"Magnets!" Tony says, his smile brimming with pride, and Steve realizes Tony's never really gotten to show off the armor, not like this. He's beginning to suspect Tony's the kind of guy who loves talking about the things he's made, and he hasn't been able to tell Steve the half of it before now. "Wonderful things, aren't they? The metal itself is actually a flexible mesh that polarizes when it's all hooked up. That's how it molds itself to my body and provides actual armoring."
. And, sure, he may be with Iron Man, but he's only human, and Mr. Stark is attractive. It's not as if Steve's going to do anything about it. He's taken, but that doesn't mean he's blind.
He thought it would be good. He thought everything would be fine. There's no way that Mr. Stark's going to be kindly disposed to a man who has just scared him half to death, literally.
He hopes Mr. Stark will at least give them some time alone. Steve thinks he can manage to be pleasant to him for that long. Heck, maybe Mr. Stark will even apologize for what he said about Iron Man. That would be the best possible outcome. But right now, Steve doesn't really want to see him.
"You should do whatever you're most comfortable with," Steve tells him, because that's the truth. "If you don't want me to see -- if you don't ever want me to see -- you don't have to show me. You don't owe me anything."
Mordo began to rise. Tony was about ninety-seven percent sure he wasn't hallucinating. Mordo was actually floating. Up and up and then through the ceiling. To the next floor.
Tony's not crying -- not anymore, anyway -- but he's still not what Steve would call fine. Nowhere near it. This isn't enough, not this time. Tony's gone awfully far into the gloominess. He's had a hell of a night.
Steve heard the other end of the line start to ring, and Tony stood up and started to pace across the kitchen, gesturing as he talked.
God. Tony just came up with new ways to surprise him every day, new thoughtful gifts. And Steve was sure he'd have done it for anyone, too. He was just so generous. This was why Steve loved-- no, no, he shouldn't think that. He really shouldn't.
Tony's staring at him, frozen. One hand is raised, but he's not even aiming at where he has to know Ghost must be. The set of his stance is confused, off-balance, his head tilted. He looks like he's trying to remember what to do. His hand is still trembling. Steve realizes now that he didn't unmute Tony on the comms. Steve can't hear Tony at all, if he's saying anything. The only sound in the room now is Steve choking, gasping, the desperate need for air burning in his lungs. It's so hard to work free when he can't see what he's doing.
"No, no, no!" Steve said, hastily. "That's all right. He didn't kick me out. I offered to leave. It was my idea." He sighed. "I thought it would be... better... if I didn't spend a lot of time around him right now."
Tony looked genuinely surprised, like he'd never in his life thought that Steve would want to pretend to be anything other than the noblest paragon of virtue, even in a game. His eyes went wide. "A
"Okay," Steve said, sounding immensely agreeable given that Tony had just told him no one's dick was getting wet tonight, to put it in the crudest possible terms, "but you can still plug me up, right?"
And then, slowly, slowly, Tony pushed himself upright. Steve could hear Tony's joints crack, and Tony groaned under his breath. Tony's weight left Steve's thighs, and already Steve missed the feel of him; after a bare few hours of being next to Tony, his body had come to know that this was right, that this was where Tony should be.
"Steve," Tony says, brokenly, and he realizes he might not know how to say no to this man, in the end.
Steve's fingers are dextrous on the buckles, and soon enough he's loosened the bracer entirely, sliding it off his arm and setting it on the table next to him. A few more seconds and he's worked off the glove underneath, leaving his arm bare to the elbow. He turns his other arm over, ready to repeat the process on the other side, but Tony holds up his hand.
Tony was putting his entire heart in Steve's hands. More than that. This was every dream, every hope, every wish Tony had had for a decade, and it was all coming true. Tony could have this. Tony was trusting Steve with everything in him, holding nothing back. It was humbling and more than a little frightening to know that Tony was giving Steve everything he had. But he was going to try as hard as he could to be worthy. Maybe everyone else had broken Tony's heart, but that wasn't going to be him.
"That's fine by me," Steve allowed. "If you let me up at some point, I'll make the bed for you, then. Just tell me when you're ready."
"Take as long as you need." Steve's stomach was twisted up with nerves. He didn't know what Tony's answer would be. But he'd waited this many years, not knowing. He could wait a little longer.
Steve took a breath. "I want to go home with you, to our home. I want to walk down the hallway holding your hand. I want to spend the night in your room and not have to leave before anyone sees me. I want to know what it's like to wake up in your bed in the morning. Every morning. I want to sit next to you at dinner. I want to kiss you hello. I want to bring you coffee. I want to wash your hair for you. I want to call you pet names. I want to cuddle with you on the couch while I'm doing my paperwork, just knowing that you're right there and I'm touching you. I want to go out for brunch, like you offered. I want a picture of us on the corkboard in your workshop. I want to dance with you, proper dancing. I want our friends to congratulate us. I want the team to expect to find us in the same room when they go looking for one of us. If we get new recuits, I want them to hear about us the same way they'd hear about anyone else. I want to be able to talk about you, and I want to do it without lying, without pretending that we're only friends, without having to hide away every part of my life that has you in it. Because you're the best part of my life." Dizzy, he stopped, gulping air. "That's what I want. I don't know how much of it I can have, but that's what I want."
Tony's penthouse almost, but not quite, boasts one of those trendy open-concept floor plans. When Steve gets past the foyer he's confronted with the wide expanse of kitchen, living area, and office area. Just past that is a half-length wall separating the public space from the more private space; he can see a walk-in closet, the corner of Tony's bed, and the door to Tony's bathroom.
before he tried kink, but, God, it's a rush. It's dizzying, heady. He feels like he could do anything, anything at all, and Tony would let him. More than let him. Tony would
He'd given Tony the shield to hang onto, because Tony couldn't very well hold onto him if he was the one wearing it. He trusted Tony with it, Tony more than anyone else, which Steve supposed also said a lot of things about him that he was hoping Tony wouldn't figure out.
When he turned back to the living room, he stopped in the doorway. Tony had removed the helmet and set it down on the coffee table; he'd draped his coat and tie over the end of the couch. He was staring out the window at the night beyond. Steve couldn't see his face from his angle, but he doubted it was good. Tony was trembling harder, and had wrapped his arms around himself, seemingly trying to make himself smaller. Less obtrusive. Less of a problem, as Tony probably thought of himself. He wasn't a problem.
So Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and pulled him close, as they kept kissing. He wasn't that much bigger than Tony but he was sure he could still manage to make Tony feel safe. Tony was mostly on top of him again, the whole length of his body pressed against Steve's, their legs tangling. Steve slid his hands over Tony's back, and Tony moaned encouragingly into Steve's mouth as Steve's hands once again reached Tony's ass.
Something about Tony's explanation, though, had lodged in Steve's brain, like a thorny tactical problem. Donahue's story sure sounded like it was true, but the timing seemed... wrong. Why would Stone's father have committed suicide months
She shrugged, pulled out her identicard, and tapped out a message. "Not for another ten minutes, and right now it's Vizh, and it's not like he needs to eat lunch, right?" A reply flickered onto her card; Steve couldn't read it from here. "He says he can hold down the fort for half an hour while we run this urgent team exercise of ours. It'll be great. And you know you can't hurt me. Not without trying very, very hard, anyway."
He flips Tony so fast that for half a second Tony isn't sure which way is up, and his head spins like he's just pulled a loop at 3Gs. Tony breathes out, realizes Steve is above him, and figures that's as good a direction as any. He reaches out for him, his fingers catching on the back of Steve's remaining bracer.
Oh. Right. Sometimes Steve forgot about things like that, even after a decade in the future. Sometimes he forgot everything that was possible. It was all so fantastic, really. He undid the relevant pouch -- not the one Jan had poked -- and pulled out his cell phone. The clock on the front said 11:23. Ouch. No wonder Jan and Hank wanted to go home.
Tony was blinking back more tears. "God, Steve," he whispered. "How do you do that? How do you always know exactly what to say?"
When he woke up, his mouth tasted like cotton, Steve had strapped him into the co-pilot seat, and there were blue skies around him. Experimentally, he reached for Bleeding Edge in the back of his mind, and found it sluggish but responsive. He could call the armor if he needed it.
"Maybe not," Tony said. "Wanted to, though," he added, and Steve got the distinct impression that Tony felt the same way about it.
"I'd like to come all over you," Steve blurted out, because apparently he was once again turned-on to the point where he was just going to say everything in his head. "I, um. Oh, God."
Steve swallows hard as he knocks on the door to Tony's penthouse. He's in uniform, but he's still not used to this one, to the feel of his bare knuckles against polished wood, the sight of himself in navy and leather. The gloves are fingerless. He's wearing a weapons harness. Every time he looks at himself in the mirror, he hates the sight a little more.
That was also nice, but Tony was the one who was leaving. Tony was leaving, he suspected, very soon now.
It turned out that Tony had been very, very good at lying, that he had been in quite a lot of distress for most of his life, and that one of his highest priorities was not breaking down anywhere the public might be able to see him. And then, somewhere along the way, Steve stopped counting as a member of the public. And then, a year ago, Steve started counting as something rather more.
Tony's gaze lingers a little longer than necessary on Steve's cock; they both know how much Steve likes it when Tony admires him. Steve can feel his face heat, but it's not in a bad way.
," Tony spits out, like it's the lowest and most vile of sins. "I was helpless then, and I was helpless tonight. Ghost had a gun to your head and I couldn't do anything. I was just standing there. Just like with Machine Man."
Iron Man's eyes are even more dazzling than the chandelier above them. "Maybe you wouldn't. I did some research. It started out as the Yiddish Art Theater, for plays. It was a movie theater for a few years back in your day but I worked out that you were probably in the Army by then, or close enough. And then it was a regular theater again, and now it's a cinema again. Shows a lot of arthouse films."
The other power pack comes off, and the armor goes completely dark. Tony deftly removes the belt they were attached to, and then he raises his arms. Steve slides his fingers up the nearly invisible side-seam of the armor and finds two depressions, just below Tony's arms on either side.
That was... that was a whole lot of blood. And a whole lot of time. God, Steve must have been a mess.
It was clear that Steve didn't know. That he didn't think it would mean anything to see Iron Man's face, because Iron Man couldn't possibly be someone he recognized. Well, he was about to find out how wrong he was about that. They both were.
"Steve." Iron Man tries again. "I-- I care about you. Of course I want you to be happy. I love you. But that doesn't mean you should feel the same way about me. Loving me
Everyone would think it was one of Tony's little jokes, even if he said he was really with Steve, a joke like the pet names and the limp wrists and the campiness. No one else has actually asked Steve if they're together, though Steve bets most of SHIELD knows already.
Steve spreads his fingers wide and puts his hand against Iron Man's, matching the length of their fingers, flattening his palm against the glassy bump of the repulsor. Iron Man could hurt him with a flick of his wrist, but he won't. Steve knows that in his soul. He thinks that's one of the reasons they understand each other. They both know how to hold back their strength, in their own way. How to be careful.
Tony was in his bed. Tony was still asleep. Tony had, in fact, hardly moved since he'd fallen asleep; his head was still pillowed on Steve's shoulder, his arm flung possessively over Steve's chest. Steve wasn't surprised to find out that Tony liked cuddling even in his sleep. Tony looked so peaceful in his sleep, unworried, all his cares melted away. The bright sunlight -- God, it was probably almost noon -- peeked through the edges of Steve's curtains, painting Tony in golden light. He was beautiful.
Steve's heart sank. Tony didn't get it, not in the slightest. Tony thought Steve was doing all this because
"I think somebody turned out the lights," Tony said, trying for levity, as the HUD flickered and died.
Tony wasn't for him. It would be wrong to think about him like this. Not now that he knew Tony didn't want him, had never wanted him, would never want him. Tony wouldn't have wanted Steve to feel like this about him. It was wrong. It was a violation. And Tony was happy, now. Tony had found someone. Steve needed to be happy for him. He needed to put this behind him. He needed to get over Tony.
He knows Tony's had a hard life. They've known each other for most of their adult lives; it's not like Steve hasn't been there for most of the heart attacks, and the drinking, and the drinking, and the damn
doesn't have a tenth of Tony Stark's charm either, because he's staring at Steve like Steve's just smacked him in the face with his shield.
He's seen Tony experience subdrop before. It's been bad. He's damn near positive that Tony's going to drop this time, if Steve has to leave him. And it's going to be terrible.
. It seemed like a joke. Surely, any minute now, he would pull his cowl back up, stand straight, get that Captain America look in his eyes, and walk right out the door. But somehow, he was still here.
Steve didn't know what part of the ruined Quinjet the curved metal piece had come from, and he suspected he didn't want to know, but Tony lashed it very efficiently to his leg, over his pants, which was a good move because they would have been hell to take off anyway, over a fracture.
Does Iron Man really think Steve wants him to go bother Mr. Stark with a needless complaint about his bedsheets?
. Steve hates the cold; he's always hated it, even before the ice, back when he never had enough meat on his bones to keep him warm. He'd been thinking in the back of his mind that a chill was something he'd just have to endure, being with Iron Man, but it looks like he doesn't have to concern himself with that at all. Iron Man is perfect.
"What do you think?" Tony murmurs in his ear. "Should we do something about that? You've been so good to me. I'd like to be good to you too."
But Tony just smiled a little, an absently fond smile, as he ran his thumb over the book cover. He wasn't even looking up. "It's good to know that you're so open-minded," he murmured.
He slid the book out an inch or two, tipped it into his hand, and straightened up. Time to find out.
Steve knows it's bad when he's standing here wishing that Tony had the self-possession to lie about how he felt.
"I'm sorry about that," he says, finally, like he honestly thinks he did something wrong -- and Steve doesn't think he's apologizing for refusing lifesaving medical treatment. "I really am. I didn't mean to do that. I just don't-- I don't handle surprises well."
Luckily, he didn't have long to wait, because Tony was fast, and in no time at all, Tony was carefully rolling the condom over Steve's length, and even that touch of Tony's hand was amazing.
Tony calls Steve his It's Complicated, and Steve refuses to sign up for Facebook, so he doesn't know if Tony's actually listed him like that. He wouldn't put it past him.
Steve starts to turn away, to assemble the rest of a meal as Mr. Stark walks past him, clearly absconding with his coffee. But Mr. Stark clears his throat and catches Steve's attention.
And it's in the midst of one such battle, a few weeks after they start dating, that the rest of the Avengers find out about them.
So he grabs a worn, fuzzy pair of old sweatpants out of his dresser, peels off his uniform, and is in the process of pulling a t-shirt over his head when his identicard beeps again.
Steve's stomach twists. He already knew Tony wasn't okay. He wishes he hadn't asked. Half of him knows it's important for him to know; they'll be in combat in a few minutes and he's leading the mission and he needs to know his teammate's status. The other part of him knows he asked because he was hoping against hope that Tony would be okay, and in the best of all worlds, Tony would have said he was fine. But right now Tony's so screwed up that he can't even pretend he's fine.
What was Steve supposed to do? Tony was clearly having a great time. This was his old friend, whom he hadn't seen in years. Tony deserved to spend all the time he wanted with his friend. Steve couldn't just interrupt him because it was his bedtime and he needed to get going. But Tony was also his ride home.
On the way back to the mansion, Steve was willing to admit that he was still upset. Recognizing his feelings was the first step, wasn't it? He couldn't get past them if he couldn't accept them. So if his anger made the street swim in front of his eyes, if his jealousy weighed down his chest, if his sadness froze his very heart like he was about to spend another fifty years in the goddamn ice -- surely he needed to acknowledge that. Acknowledgment. He could do that.
He shut his eyes, and the world went away again, but this time he was safe and warm, surrounded by Tony.
Steve remembered the photographs he'd been looking at, just a few hours ago. In the pictures, Tony had been smiling at him, laughing with him, leaning against him. But this had always been there, all along, hadn't it? Tony had always felt this way. Every picture had been a love story.
"And he said he'd make it up to me." Steve had half a second to wonder if this was some kind of euphemism, and then, thankfully, Tony continued on. "He's going to hold a press conference. He's going to tell the world that he was the one who asked me to see Donahue for him, and that I was doing him a favor, and that that was all it was. I couldn't possibly ask for anything more, could I?"
Tony's face was open, earnest. He dug his thumb into the join of Steve's neck and shoulder, working out a knot there that Steve hadn't realized was there.
Tony's mouth trembles, but he's still smiling. "There are actually backups of everything he wanted, by the way. But they're on tape, offline, and very, very secure." His breath catches, but this time it might be a laugh. "I can't say I'm sorry he thought I was stupid enough to keep them online, though."
What was Steve supposed to do? This wasn't in his skillset. He didn't remember if the DreamVision demonstration had included Tiberius taking the volunteer out of it. Probably not. Maybe he should call Hank. One of the Hanks. Which one, though? McCoy, probably. Beast was a medical doctor and Goliath wasn't. Also, Beast knew Nightcrawler, surely, and that meant that if Steve needed him he could be here in about fifteen seconds. Then again, so could Strange, and Strange was
was the happiness again. Tony's eyes were wide, incredulous, but he was already starting to smile, a huge, gorgeous smile that just kept breaking through, again and again, as the look in his eyes brightened, pessimism crumbling in the face of so much hope. He couldn't hold anything back, and then he stopped trying to. He was radiant. He looked changed, transformed. A different man. Steve had never seen him this happy before -- not about a new suit, not about a new team, not about anything. But Tony had clearly been waiting a long, long time to hear those words. Steve had made him look like this, too.
He fumbles for the case one-handed -- so he doesn't have to take his hand off Tony's side -- and sets it on the bed next to Tony. There's a terrible half-second of blank staring before recognition finally flickers into Tony's eyes.
"I like that," Steve said, with a smile. It was sweet. Tony was just that sweet. And it was nice to know, in a way that sent a little thrill of satisfaction through him, that it had, in a sense, been him first.
The Avengers were there too -- well, not all of them, obviously, just enough to be representative, and obviously not including Iron Man -- because, after all, it was the Foundation that paid their salaries. So Steve, along with the rest of the team, was dragged on stage for a few seconds, the same as every year.
He wouldn't have said anything to Tony, though, not then. He'd been-- geez, he'd been engaged to Bernie, back then. He'd loved her. He really had. And he'd also known that it was possible to be attracted to someone without acting on it, and he'd thought Tony was straight, so nothing would have happened. Just another case of unrequited love. Someone he'd never have had a chance with. He'd told himself it would fade. But then Bernie had left him, and-- well, he'd still loved Tony. He'd always loved Tony.
Tony's imagination had only extended as far as Steve seeing him, and no farther. He hadn't ever entertained the thought that Steve would be able to touch him. Or that Steve might
Tiberius still hadn't stirred. He was still breathing, but he didn't look any closer to coming around. And Steve knew Tony didn't want to talk about whatever had just happened to him in DreamVision, but at the same time, there were a few things Steve needed to know, and his need to know them was rapidly growing more and more urgent. He didn't particularly want Tiberius to be awake, but if the police were in fact coming, they'd been called because the guard had thought Steve might harm Tiberius. And if Steve was going to be sitting here next to Tiberius' unconscious body when the cops came, it definitely wasn't going to look good for him.
, Steve amends, wincing inwardly -- fine, but he says his liver's still shot. So it's not impossible that his back didn't get included in the deal.
" -- he reached out and stroked Tony's cock again, just to watch him push up into his hand -- "I get to watch everything tighten up nicely." Tony's stomach practically rippled, the muscles standing out in sharp definition as he thrust up. "An appealing view. I like it."
"I-- I-- I--" Iron Man stammers. He can't even get a sentence out. "You-- you know who you're asking, right? I live in a suit of armor, Cap. You can have practically anyone in the whole wide world. I can't give you a normal relationship." He gestures at himself again, at his glorious armor, as if that's supposed to put Steve off.
touching Steve, though. The barrel of the gun is pressing against Steve's head. Maybe that's what Tony means. Maybe Steve needs to move away from Ghost. That has to be it. That's the only thing he can do.
"More than okay, Shellhead," Steve breathed, barely whispering, so that the nickname couldn't be overheard. Tony's smile was brighter than the sun.
Tony's hand went to his sternum. "God, I'm an idiot," he pronounced, mournfully. "I never-- I'm sorry."
Steve takes a deep, trembling breath. He can say this. Iron Man likes him. It's okay to ask. "So," he says, "would you-- would you be interested in a second date?"
Tony fishes the single-use lube packet out of his coat, takes the coat off, folds it over the nearest chair -- he wasn't raised by wolves, thank you, and this is a Van Dyne original -- flips the lube packet onto the table, and waits.
Oh, God. The noise Steve heard himself make was something very much like a whimper. His hips jerked up into empty air at just the thought of it, checked by the weight of Tony's body, searching for a touch that wasn't yet there. A dozen different images slid through Steve's mind, long-ago fantasies, brand-new fantasies, everything he'd tried not to dream about. But it was okay now. He could have this now. Tony was offering him this.
Steve told himself not to touch Tony. "It's not selfish. And I'm happy to be here for you. But you-- you can always tell other people, too. If you want."
So when Tony asks for it, when Tony has to ask for it, Steve can practically see his self-esteem take a hit, every single time.
"Sorry," Tony says. "The, uh. The groin plates are cutting in a little funny. Do you mind if I...?" He leaves the sentence unfinished.
"This is me," Tony says, softly. "This is what there is underneath all the masks. If you're looking for the man from the magazines, you're going to be disappointed."
"We were friends at school. I mean, I thought we were friends. We were roommates most of the time. I thought we were good friends. I-- I didn't have a lot of friends." Tony's mouth was twisted. "But we didn't-- we didn't get together until we were both 21. Long after we were out of school."
Standing up, Tony starts to peel apart the remaining two armor plates at his hip. "Don't worry," he says, brightly. "I'm decent." Then he frowns. "For a certain value of
This was why the Avengers were here. Sure, Damage Control could handle the rebuilding, but the Avengers had a lot of gear and data that Tony knew no one else should be getting their hands on, and it was up to them to sort it out first. It looked like his workshop was a mess -- but, well, it was his workshop, and he was the person with the best odds of being able to clean it as safely as possible.
"Maybe I want to do this again a lot," Steve returned. He paused. "I-- I love you, Tony. You don't have to say it back. I just want you to know."
"That's better, isn't it?" Tiberius said, with satisfaction. "The Phantom Menace. You can be Obi-Wan Kenobi! You can defeat Darth Maul! And, hey, maybe this time you can even save your master. Or, if you like old-school television, and who doesn't, am I right--"
In some ways, being a superhero is a lot like being any other first responder: firefighter, police officer, paramedic. But the difference is that those people work in shifts, and those people are on-call, and when they are off-shift they go home. Whatever happens when they're off, for the most part, is someone else's problem.
." His reply is absent, pro forma; Steve imagines that he's issued this emendation hundreds of times, to hundreds of people. Steve's not special. Tony's gaze is unfocused, drifting, like he's not paying attention to the real substance of Steve's comment.
He'd always felt a little guilty that five years on, a major part of his memory of finding out Tony's secret identity had also involved finding out his liking for skimpy underwear. Apparently it hadn't just been the one pair.
They walk in silence, up the stairs, down the second floor hallway, and they come to a halt in front of Steve's door.
Tony reaches out again, manages to actually grab Steve's hand this time, and tugs him forward. "Come on," he says, and he arches his hips. "I need that in me, soldier."
, and somehow Tony hadn't thought of that but Tony isn't really thinking about anything right now except Steve's big, hard,
"I don't--" Steve began to say, and then he stopped, because, Jesus, he'd never thought of that before, and he could
Iron Man obligingly closes the door, and Steve can't help but feel a little self-conscious as Iron Man looks around. Iron Man's never actually been in his room before. He doesn't know what kind of lifestyle Iron Man leads, where he lives -- although with his Avengers pay on top of whatever Mr. Stark is presumably paying him for his services, it's probably not too shabby at all -- but he hopes Iron Man's not judging him by the way he lives. Steve didn't have anything when the Avengers took him in, and he hasn't accumulated much: a few photos; his old footlocker, taken back from the Smithsonian; a few history books Hank and Jan gave him -- to help him settle in, Jan had said.
He likes this part. He hates how much he likes this part. "I'm here for you to use me," Steve says, and Tony's smile is bright and knife-sharp, as Steve's cock twitches again and soaks his underwear with even more pre-come.
"I sure am." Iron Man says. He sounds proud. "Hey, since you did such a good job, I have a present for you. Would you like a present?"
Tony had expounded upon his D&D theory of personality several years ago, one late night when neither of them could sleep -- and because it was Tony, Steve had listened to him explaining for twenty entire minutes about how to play D&D, including a nearly-incomprehensible digression on something called "THAC0." As far as Steve could determine, it all sounded a lot like playing make-believe with toy soldiers about being in a Tolkien novel, except with a bunch of dice and a whole lot more numbers. But Tony had explained the whole thing, and he'd talked about character attributes, and how, in his head, sometimes he liked to work out what other people, real people, would be like if they were in the game.
and I-- I-- I know we've both been so lonely lately, and I just-- I just thought maybe now was the right time--"
He and Iron Man go to a ball game, sitting in the cheap seats just like Steve did when he was a kid -- though even the cheap seats are a heck of a lot nicer than they used to be. Iron Man, as promised, loans him a movie -- an animated version of
Tony's voice went low, his eyes gone dark. "Oh, I'll show you anything you want," he said, and he climbed into Steve's lap.
He reached in, found a cloth bag within the box, and worked his hand past the drawstring. He felt the brush of leather loops against his fingertips, and knew what he had before he pulled the bag out of the box, and then the bag's contents out of the bag. First one flogger and then another, smaller one were revealed before him. Like the crop, they were both clearly used -- the leather had been broken in -- and they were well-cared-for by their mysterious owner, the leather conditioned and cleaned. They were expensive, too. Tony fingered the soft leather in admiration. One of the floggers was softer than the other, suede rather than finished leather, brushed delicately into readiness. The grips of both were sturdy, the falls untangled. This wasn't any of your porn-store pleather shit. Whoever owned this box believed in paying good money for good gear. Tony was beginning to admire them already.
"After ViaStone completes the DreamVision rollout," Tiberius continued, as he stood up and walked toward the computer, "the ViaStone cable box itself will directly deliver the user's requested content, obviously. But for the time being, I'll have to do the honors."
, Steve." His thumb and finger wavered and wobbled, as if Tony were threatening to close the gap between them. "Do you get it now?" he snarled.
"You asked me to kiss you," Steve confessed. "It was what you wanted. I know. And I-- I didn't make it in time. And I wasn't about to kiss you while you were passed out. So I spent the whole ambulance ride, the whole time you were in surgery, all the days you were on a ventilator, all of it -- I couldn't stop wondering if I'd missed my chance. If you were really going to die, and I'd failed you and I-- I hadn't given you the one thing you'd wanted, and I'd never even kissed you, and now I was never going to be able to--"
"I'm sorry," he said. He stared at his hands in his lap, bare hands against the half of the uniform he was still wearing. He hadn't even taken off his boots. "You asked for my help because you couldn't sleep and I've just made it worse, haven't I?"
Steve didn't see why he should believe a single word that had ever come out of Tiberius' mouth, and he wasn't about to start now.
When Steve gets the leg harness untied, the prognosis is much the same. Tony twitches his legs once or twice, like he's thinking about stretching them but then doesn't have the energy -- or maybe the willpower -- to do so. His legs are still bent back, and he shivers when Steve puts his hand on his ankle. It looks like the nice kind of shiver, though, the kind where Tony's body is still telling him he's going to have a nice night. His mind just hasn't entirely gotten the message yet.
"I don't know," Tony whispered, and now he sounded terrified again. "God, Steve, I don't know." His breath rasped. "I knew where I was. I knew what I was doing and who I was doing it with. I knew it was something that I'd wanted. But, for the life of me, I don't know whether I'd have said yes if I'd been sober. And I-- I think he knew that. He must have known that."
Tony's mouth quivered like he was trying not to smile. "We'll have to test that out sometime, maybe. If you want. I won't mind if you fail at that, though. I, uh. I like it a lot when you say my name."
"Don't you dare," Tony pants out, and there's a note in his voice Steve hasn't heard... maybe ever? It's discovery and wonder and joy all mixed together. It's like the way he talks about inventing things, but not exactly. "Oh. Oh, wow. Please stay right there."
It's not graceful; the suit's not aerodynamic enough for grace, not like this. He's falling like what he is, a man wrapped in a few hundred pounds of solid metal, and he's at least a hundred feet in the air.
He wondered if Tony was going to want to speak to him ever again after the show aired. He wondered if Tony would be kind enough to let him know before cutting off all contact. He wondered if Tony would refuse to talk to him even in meetings or on missions. He probably should have thought about that particular consequence first. But he knew he would have done everything just the same anyway.
"Yeah," Tony said. "Yeah, sure, okay." He stood up, unsteady more from nerves than from the scotch. This was really happening. "You gonna kiss me now?"
. "I know you've never even told me if you liked men, but I-- I've always thought maybe you at least liked
"So," Tony asked, letting desire purr into his voice like the hum of a perfectly-tuned engine, "you going to let me see you in a little... less?"
Icy sweat forms beads on Steve's clammy skin. His head is spinning. His heart pounds. He feels ill. He feels faint. He doesn't think he's ever felt this poorly since before the serum.
But he'd barely seen Tony at all, this week. So it wasn't as if Tony had had the opportunity to really see firsthand that Steve was still going to be Tony's friend no matter what Tony's orientation was. And Tony had spent the whole week being gaslit by a sociopathic murderer. So it wasn't really a surprise that Tony was still afraid, even if there wasn't anything for him to be afraid of. Right now, he was probably going to assume the worst of people. Even Steve. It wasn't something Steve should take personally.
And Tiberius wasn't out either. Steve generally didn't keep up with celebrity gossip, but it would have made headlines if the new richest man in America had been gay, or bi, or whatever he was. Steve would have remembered hearing a thing like that. Steve suspected that that level of power and influence wasn't particularly welcoming of anyone who wasn't straight. He couldn't name a gay Fortune 500 CEO. And Tony and Tiberius had probably both come to the same conclusion a long, long time ago.
They don't really have records anymore, do they? But they still have fancy cars, and here Steve is, a nobody from the Lower East Side, being treated with far more class than he has ever been accustomed to.
Steve could feel his face heat up. "Tony," he said, but try as he might, he couldn't even sound disapproving.
Steve nodded -- obviously understanding what he wanted electrical access for, good -- and held up a hand in the direction of the rest of the team. "Everyone just stay put for a minute!" he called out. "Iron Man needs to check something."
Steve didn't know what to say. He was almost glad this was a recording. He didn't have to come up with a reply. God, no wonder Tony was a mess.
"No," Steve says, a denial with all the vehemence he can bring to bear, and he realizes he's gripping Iron Man's arm even tighter. "No, never." His fingers slide over smooth golden metal. "Shellhead, I'm just a man. I'm not better than anybody. I'm human. Just like you. And you've never, ever done anything to make me think you're unworthy of-- of being cared for. I don't think you ever could. You deserve happiness as much as anyone. I want you to be happy. I really do. And if I can do anything to give you that... well, that's what I want."
This interview would have been much easier to navigate through if Tony hadn't had a damn secret identity. Oh, well. It was what it was.
and considered it. He didn't think Tony had read it yet; he'd read it intending to offer it to Tony when he was done. But it was probably not a great choice. He was remembering now that the reason he hadn't given it to Tony was that he'd been worrying that a plot about people who'd been genetically engineered not to need sleep might have been a little too inspirational for Tony. Also, right now Tony probably wasn't going to find that plot very amusing. He wanted something Tony wasn't going to already have those sorts of suspicions about.
Something about this situation was brushing up against the edge of Steve's memory, not quite connected to conscious thought. Something about this looked
Hank laughed. "I guess I must have." Then he blinked and peered past Steve, as if he were looking for someone else. "Are you here all on your lonesome?" he asked. "What happened? Did your date ditch you?"
talking to Tiberius Stone. He was bending over a table; it looked like he was sketching something out on a paper napkin. A heavyset man who must have been one of Tiberius' bodyguards was conspicuously lingering, several feet away from them.
"Breathe," he reminds Tony, and Tony obligingly takes a huge breath. "When was the last time anyone worked you over like this, Shellhead? You're all twisted up."
It isn't like Steve was trying to hurt him. "I'm sorry. I hope you find someone who makes you happy."
Bound, Steve tried to shrug, but both his shoulders moved as he twisted. "Not much of a choice. The cheap stuff breaks on me. Never holds up with how hard I need it."
Iron Man nods. "I'm fine." He pauses. Steve can hear him inhale. "There is one thing I miss, though, and it's... touching people. It's selfish, I know. But I have to wear the chestplate, and if anyone knew, they'd-- they'd know I was Iron Man. And I can't take that risk."
"I should have figured out you were the one who needed a vibranium alloy, though," Tony said, ruefully, "so don't give me all the credit." Time for the other question that had been eating at him all night. "Where'd you get all this?"
“Comms.” Tony immediately replies. “We need to bring power back to the city. We need it for heaters, for water distribution, for everything. Filters, too!”
“I thought you’d gotten the hang of modern economics, big guy.” Tony tries, gauging Steve’s reaction, trying desperately to find the source of this unease between them.
“How did they get here?” Tony asks, his chest constricting, a small but telling thought forming at the back of his head; but he doesn’t want to let it grow, not yet, not before he gets an answer.
“Boss.” FRIDAY suddenly interrupts, her voice calm but impossible to ignore through the speakers. “I’m sorry to interrupt – It seems like the Benatar is having some issues and it’s not possible to fly it at the moment.”
. It makes his skin crawl, memories of having his heart shredded open while Obie stood before him with his metaphorical heart in his hand, speaking in the same tones he used to when he was reassuring Tony of his value after a fight with his father.
They are all suited up, already. Some of them didn’t have anything else to wear. Rhodey and Pepper decided to suit up early, Tony has offered Bruce one of his Kevlar suits prototypes he had in his workshop, Nebula and Rocket have no armor besides what they have on their back. They say they don’t need it. Tony is the only one not in his armor yet, and while the others start to move frantically, gathering weapons, he turns to look at Nebula, his hand hovering on the nanite casing in his sternum, a hesitant question in his eyes.
“We have to work.” Tony says, just – just to say it. To give all of them and himself a reminder of their mission, even if he knows it’s completely pointless and unnecessary. He hopes the obviousness of it will make it easier to follow through if he hears it out loud, but it doesn’t.
Steve has nothing to say to that. It wasn’t even his intention to bring it up, he just… blurted it out as soon as he noticed it. He wonders if he’s really that out of it, or if this is just another small deflection that he has just spoken out loud by accident, so naturally he didn’t even realize he was doing. Whatever it was, it’s awkward. Wanda clears her throat a little bit, moving closer to Steve in light, soft steps, until she’s close enough so they can speak in a quiet tone.
, a denial, and Tony embraces it and allows it to consume him whole, even as it brings a lump to his throat, as his breath cuts sharp when he breathes in and his eyes burn with strain.
And just as cryptically as every other interaction they’ve had so far, Rogers gives him a small, almost shy nod, before he turns to the others and tells them to get some rest as well; And so, with the books shared between them, they start to leave, saying goodbye and goodnight in hushed tones and heavy steps, leaving through the door quietly, like ghosts. Rhodey lingers, of course, because he’s the best, and he lays a hand on Tony’s shoulder and shakes him a little, asks if he’s okay, and maybe it’s the bags underneath his own eyes or the slouch of his shoulders that make him accept so easily the weak smile Tony gives him in return, the obvious lie of
It’s almost midnight when he’s done. Maria is still awake, as she usually is these days, sitting in a chair of the kitchen with a tiny cup of tea in her hands. She flips through a magazine absentmindedly, her nails scratching under the lines printed on the pages, just scamming the articles without really reading any of them. Her lips are in a thin line. Her hair is loose, thrown against her left shoulder. She looks incredibly tired.

Nebula gets up from the chair and moves to the side, the panel illuminating her from behind like a holy image, a halo of bursting colors and shifting brightness, a display that is almost mockingly beautiful for a scene so sad. Tony watches her move curiously, forcing himself to focus on her movement and not on the shadows that lurk behind his eyes, burning in his retinas, the memories that will fuel his nightmares forever, if he ever gets to sleep again.

He is very obviously waiting for Steve’s reaction to it, which Steve can understand, considering that the last time T’Challa heard him talk about anything involving the Accords, Steve had been out of his mind, fuming with rage and betrayal, about to start a war with one of his teammates and closest friends.

Thor looks taken aback, overwhelmed by Bruce’s outburst. “Dark matter and dark energy are powerful forces. To control them means to control one of the universe’s foundations itself. Even in Asgard, our most powerful sorcerers don’t have a full grasp on their properties and strengths. It makes sense than an Infinity Stone would rule over it.”
Tony wonders if this is the irony the universe has in store for him. The last of the Avengers, standing with the last of the Guardians, both of them trapped in a deserted planet, to rot away slowly.
And he wonders, for a moment, if Thor has always been like this, always had this almost somber side to him, or if this is a recent development – and what exactly has happened, to change him like that.
“No, I wasn’t in my uniform.” Steve steps back, shaking his head, and he and Bucky promptly start a slow walk around the garden, aimlessly weaving through the corridors of flowers in a very lazy pace.

“That’s the spirit, big guy.” Tony says, because he’s an asshole who doesn’t know how to express genuine admiration, but he does want to say… something. He wants Thor to know he is listening, and that he is, as much as he can, trying to believe what Thor is saying. Though Thor’s wisdom speaks of experience beyond Tony’s capabilities, Tony owes him, if not for the fight, for this incredible display of trust on Thor’s part, to at least
He looks up with damning precision to where one of the speakers is installed right into the workshop’s ceiling, as if trying to capture back the sound, or the revelation that came with it.
He – He’s done with agonizing over what Wanda could or could not have done or thought or planned about… everything. Tony’s feelings for her could never be easily unraveled into palatable pieces when the very foundation of their
“No.”, and the taste of the truth feels weird in his tongue, like liquor, the tingling of it spreading through his body like a hit of a very powerful drug. “I didn’t think it was important. It didn’t hurt me.”
Thanos has the stones. All six of them. He could easily obliterate them if he wanted to. He is still the most powerful being in the entire universe, and he has all the advantage because he has the bigger stick and he’s very hard to kill, to begin with. To be honest – it’s probably… it’s probably a suicide mission. Tony’s best tech couldn’t stop him. He had only four stones then, and all Tony had done was to draw one drop of blood.
It seems like Steve broke through whatever walls Sam had with this admission, because suddenly, Sam can’t stop talking. His mind is running at the speed of light right before his eyes, connecting dots and analyzing memories, trying to make sense of it all through the shock the news have stricken on him. “So Stark lost his mind, and that’s why you fought?”.
He might not be their ruler, but he is their leader, and he knows how much his words can impact the actions of his friends. He has seen it happen too many times now to be oblivious to it.
“Xandar is destroyed.” Thor promptly informs, starling everyone who had been engrossed in watching Rocket and Nebula’s nonsensical discussion. “It was the first place Thanos went for the Stones.”
“Hey, hold on now.” Sam interrupts, stepping back so he can stand between Steve and the slowly approaching Natasha. “I’m no one’s errand boy, alright? I’m not here as reinforcement or whatever, I’m here ‘cause I’m worried about you.”
But his thoughts are still back in the house, in the study in the west wing, wondering if this will be night his curiosity will finally drive him to the point of breaking that computer apart.
And they know about Tony. He doesn’t know how many more, besides this one man, but one is just one too many people in the know for Jarvis’ comfort. This man does not seem like an enemy. But who can give him any guarantee that there are no others, with worse intentions, and more motives to act on those intentions?
“It doesn’t matter.” Steve continues, as if he cannot see Natasha’s displeasure. “Scott won’t need to tell them anything.”
” Tony says in a murmur, looking down, fearing the others might see too much if they can see his eyes. “What happened down here? When he… got the last one?”
, no matter the outcome had been – because in the end, it was still a trial. In the end, Scott is still being sentenced to jail for doing something so simple as helping Steve stalling Tony, as helping
, if we’re still being treated like criminals.” Sam argues, inclining himself forward so he can get closer to Clint’s face, challenging him unconsciously, making himself look wider and more aggressive. “That’s not good enough.”
in this story will be random. Nothing will happen "just because". Everything has a reason and a function, and I'm very excited to know if anyone can already see the impact this will have going forward on the story, and in Tony's character overall.
, because he didn’t fulfill his promise, and they still don’t realize how deeply the failed. He has no right to their breathless surprise. He has done nothing to earn it.
Maria has seen many blueprints like this in Howard’s desk, but she’s never seen this model. She doesn’t recognize it from anywhere else either. Where did Tony get this?
“Neither did I.” Thor admits, and his voice is so sincere it doesn’t even occur to Tony to think he might be lying. “My father kept many secrets. The existence of my sister and her location was one of those secrets. When they were revealed, the destruction caused by them cost me greatly – far more than my hammer.”
“His name is Anthony”, she tells everyone, loving and caring, holding him to her breast so gently one would think the baby is made of glass. “Anthony Stark”
to rest.” Tony says, a little too harshly, a little too ready to pick up a fight if it proves necessary.
“We’re listening.” Tony replies, honestly kind of grateful for the interruption, but worried about the weird noises being patched through the audio. “You are supposed to get back down here, Nebula too!”
