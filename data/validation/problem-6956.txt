“Come on, Rogers, it’s for charity.” Tony quips easily, not looking the least bit out of place on the large ballroom floor.
Steve laughed lightly at that. Tony had a way of making Steve’s issues feel lighter, like maybe he was helping lift the burden.
“Yeah of course, I should actually find Pepper, she’s probably got our seats saved and I don’t want to make a whole thing by showing up late…” Tony considers that for a moment, “Well, not again at least.” He gives the man one of his charming smiles and can’t help but throw in a wink while he’s at it.
Steve stops and takes a deep breath. Remembering all they fought for, what they were trying to accomplish, and the world they were left with.
Steve makes his way out of the ballroom and tries to find somewhere to step out for a moment when he spots a balcony off to the side. Steve makes his way for it, happy to note there’s practically no one out there. He walks out onto the balcony, the night air swooping in to envelop him and Steve feels like he can breathe easy for the first time in a while.
“I actually need to be going.” He glances back up at Tony, his whole demeanor suddenly looking more uncertain than he’s seen him this whole time.
Tony nods lightly, and Steve noticed Tony’s hand seemed to relax slightly where it rests on his hip. Steve forced himself to give in to the music and started looking around the room and actually taking notice of the people who were staring.
“Tony. It’s a book. Stop speculating and go get in line.” She shoves the book into his arms and practically shoos him off.
Tony watches Steve talking behind the podium, not looking at him while he moves his hands expressively and talks about his writing process. “This is the guy.”
Steve laughs lightly and remarks, “I’m beginning to think that might be glowing praise coming from you.”
Steve just nodded and continued swaying, and realized they’d already finished the first song and had continued dancing halfway through another.
He walks out to the edge, resting his hands on the railing. He stays there for a while, just enjoying the view and the distinct lack of people. He wonders why Tony even brings him to these, he can’t do anything good for the guy’s conversations or networking.
The reapplication of a little red lipstick had brought her fangs back out, the lilt to her voice dipping and swaying like a viper
Tony. The sex tapes and scandals had been Tony of the past. Tony was all for Steve now, he had promised him, and Steve wouldn't be here if he didn't believe it.
There was his miracle. Lube and condom, had to be. He dropped them to the floor near his feet with barely a glance, just dying to know if “came ready” meant what he thought it just possibly might.
As she made her whipcord way across the floor, he could see that what he’d taken for the top half of her dress was actually a three-quarter-sleeved, one-button jacket, opening upward in a broad triangle that revealed the square-necked front of the dress itself. A wide, rectangular diamond and ruby bar-choker paralleled the flat neckline, with similar strands of gold-set jewels flashing at her ears, wrists, and fingers.
Warm breath and a point of wet tickled lightly at his inner thigh. Steve scooched his hips, squirming down a little lower into the couch and letting his legs fall open wider as Tony's tonguetip traced its way up.
"Sure, you want to pinky swear? Fine with me, but you just said it yourself, I'll only break it as soon as it's convenient."
by my gorgeous and creative lover. Oh, and also, an amazing blowjob.” It really had been. Life was turbulent and the world was filled with wrongs to be righted, but in this, he was a very, very lucky guy. “Uh, thanks, by the way. I'm sorry I didn't--"
Tony opened his mouth, but was beaten to the punch by DUM-E's vehement two-syllable trill that bore an uncanny resemblance to the inflection of the word "
“I suppose we could always use the napkins,” she said, tipping her head toward the dining table, where large cloth squares were folded into tall triangles over the plates. She gave him a wink. “...but let’s not be uncouth.”
He ducked to the left to swipe his forehead against the sleeve on his free arm, then, one-handed, reached behind himself and stripped the perspiration-patched t-shirt over his head. He lifted his hand from Tony's hair for just long enough to free it from the sodden cloth, which he tossed to the carpet.
Steve could tell it was much more an effort for Tony to heft the cumbersome bundle compared to his own relative ease, but it still renewed his recognition of their benefactor's fitness, and despite Tony's enormous wealth, his ever-readiness to wade right in and lend his muscle to manual labor.
Steve choked off a harsh tone that gritted out from chest-deep. Reflexively, his hands curled, around the knob of Tony's wrist, and cupping the oval of his skull, through hair plastered to his scalp, the layers that wrapped this casing of bone that Tony risked cracking open with every headlong flight into combat.
Maybe it was just knowing about that goddamn golf ball in there trying to eat Tony's life away, that made him seem a little more fragile. Or the uncommon sight of Tony's head bowed, the passivity of this whole thing.
Tony eventually pulls away, laughing lightly as he presses his forehead to Steve’s, “remind me to tell you how much better you are than other people more often.”
Tony glances back at the spines lined up on the shelf beside them, “All of them, except for the new one of course. And, despite appearances I don’t make it a habit to wander bookstores and shit on people’s taste in books”
“Oh, Linda!” Tony hurried to set his glass down, his eyes darting around the room quickly in a way that Steve could tell meant he was looking for an escape route. “Where have you been? I was beginning to think you weren’t going to make it!” Steve couldn’t help but let out a small scoffing laugh at that, watching Tony handle people he didn’t want to deal with could be amusing.
“His brother’s death wasn’t on him, it’s on the bad guys. And besides, that’s my point, even through all that grief and loss and fighting against bad people every day, this team is still a shining beacon of hope? They’re still adamant to be good and fight for what’s right when it’s pretty much pointless. What’s the point in fighting if the result is still a broken world?” Tony fires back rapidly.
“So… Not a fan then?” The man raises one perfect eyebrow, and Jesus Christ Tony is even thinking of his eyebrows as perfect.
“That’s because Tony Stark is dancing with Captain America, and doing a fantastic job of it if I might say so.” Tony finally seems to catch Steve’s gaze and see something there. “Hey, you okay there?” Tony peers up at Steve with those warm brown eyes, and something in Steve’s chest seems to loosen.
Tony stares into those blue eyes for a moment, suspended in something he couldn’t quite name, the air between them feeling like electricity. He’s almost afraid to look away, he can feel images trying to make their way to the front of his mind, weapons, death, his name streaked in blood and betrayal that cut deep.
“Oh, you wound me, Pep.” Tony shakes his head at her with a dramatic pained look on his face, but it only earns him an eyeroll. “Okay well, I will go peruse I suppose.”
“I’m glad you could all make it and thank you all for your support and enthusiasm for this little story of mine, it means a lot to me.”
“Alright then, let’s hear your all-knowing-and-enlightening argument for what exactly I missed about these books.” Tony crosses his arms over his chest, attempting a look of seriousness, but he wasn’t entirely sure he managed to hide his amusement.
“No!” The word seems to find it’s way out of Steve’s mouth of its own volition, and Tony turns back towards him with a small look of surprise that’s gone in a flash. “I mean… It’s just been a long time since I’ve danced with anyone is all.”
“Oh, and don’t even get me started on the main romance, no one just falls for someone like that, so fully and all consuming. No one can possibly believe this stuff; it’s basically wish fulfillment porn.” Tony reaches out to put the book back on the shelf, feeling that itch on his chest again and barely resisting the urge to reach out and tap on it. Tony takes a deep breath, ignoring the constant whirring he swears he can hear, when he realizes he just opened his mouth and spat out the rant that has been forming for at least half an hour on some poor stranger.
Tony resists the urge to stick his tongue out at her as she walks past him and sets her book down in front of Steve. “Hello.” Pepper greets him in her best “I’m trying to make up for Tony’s behavior” voice.
Steve watches Tony shake hand after hand and after awhile of not being able to keep up with the conversation, he decides he should step away for a minute. Steve excuses himself, most not even paying attention, but Tony pauses to send him a look. Steve just gives a small shake of his head, trying his best to indicate that he’s fine.
Steve sighed to himself. Who was he kidding? He’s been iced and asleep for seventy years, everything feels so fresh. Seventy years and it still feels like it was yesterday. And he thinks he can just jump right back into it? With a whole new team that he doesn’t know, people he doesn’t trust. Bucky is gone, Peggy is gone. Everything he knew in life.
The shorter man seems to mull this over for a second, “should we stop?” Tony asks lightly, looking back over at the crowd.
Steve feels his pulse pick up, almost sure that Tony can feel the way his heart is ready to beat itself out of his ribcage. But Steve was not a person to back down from a challenge.
The team was walking back towards the City after a late-night mission, Steve and Tony a bit ahead of the others and chatting about their recent victory, when Steve decides to do the thing he’d been mulling over for about a week.
“I am S. G. Rogers; you guys can just call me Rogers though.” Steve seems to incline his head slightly towards Tony before looking back out at the rest of the crowd.
Tony’s thoughts feel scattered and disjointed like one of the machines he takes apart to tinker with.
He lets out a warm laugh and it feels like it went to Tony’s very core. “Well, I am a little surprised you managed to read all of them and miss so much.”
Tony’s brown eyes stare into Steve’s and he thinks he’s drowning in them, when Tony starts smirking at him, “I almost didn’t think you had it in you, Rogers.” Tony turns on his heel abruptly and starts walking down the street, “Come on, I know a great little diner we can go to.”
It was Tony’s turn to stutter out a laugh, it wasn’t often that people challenged him like that, at least not beyond Pepper and Rhodey. “I will have you know I read these at the insistence of a very stubborn friend and she has certainly gone many rounds with me on why I ‘just do not understand these books’” Tony says the last part in quotations, “and she definitely didn’t put a dent in my opinion.”
Steve dragged his gaze away from the outstretched hand up to Tony’s face, he scrutinized it for a moment. He didn’t see any mocking or cruel glints, just Tony. His usual confident and easy charm, nothing lurking in the shadows. He looked back down at the hand.
Steve was surprised to see less looks of disgust or contempt, and more of awe or happiness as the crowd watched them sway over the floor. He also noticed a couple looks of envy, even some from other men.
Instead he pushes himself off the wall and takes a seat, picking up the debriefing and looking through it. He reads about the tesseract, about Loki and his brother Thor. He has to reread some of it, Norse Gods and other realms not quite clicking the first time around.
He tries to ignore it all, especially when the host says the words that start a round of applause all around him, “And now, here is the author himself, S. G. Rogers.”
Can he really do this? He can barley sleep, what happens if he messes up on the field? What if he gets someone hurt?
Pepper eyes him when he finds her in one of the aisles, but he ignores her as they go to leave, and she takes the hint. He only glances back at Steve once and sees him smiling over one of his books at another fan. His own book feels like it’s burning him where it sits in his hands, but Tony refuses to let go.
He turns on some music before setting his phone on the balcony and reaching a hand out to Steve, who takes it with slight surprise.
The conversation with Fury echoed in Steve’s head as he left the gym. Seventy years and it seems like the bad guys never stop. “The world is in danger.” When isn’t it? Was anything Steve did even worth it in the end? Did he just postpone the inevitable?
Tony pulls Steve out on the floor, leading him towards the middle, never once looking out of place or worried. Steve wishes he could pull that off, but he always feels out of place, not even just at these functions, just in this whole new time.
Tony takes that as his cue to go through some of his work emails and pulls his phone out, except instead of reading about how the board meeting for next week is set to go without a hitch, he can’t seem to get the image of blue eyes and soft looking blonde hair out of his head. He can hear the audience around him chatting about the books with each other, the air around them filled with excitement.
When they finally make it next in line, Tony motions for Pepper to go, “Ladies first.” Pepper calls him out for being chickenshit with a look that Tony reads all too well.
They move around the balcony slowly, the rest of the world just fading away until it’s nothing buy Tony and soft music with a vast night sky and small twinkling lights around them.
Tony slows his steps a fraction as Steve tries to remember how to form words, “yeah, no I just um, I’m not used to this.”
“Wow you are an evil, conniving woman. Why does that seem to do it for me?” Tony asked as he followed the strawberry blonde inside.
He’s looking for a way out of this without making it even more awkward probably, Tony thinks to himself and decides to make it easy on the guy.
Pepper sighs but Tony can tell it’s one of her “I don’t know what I’m going to do with you, but also I’d be lost without you” sighs and he grins back at her.
Tony finds himself sitting next to Pepper a few moments later with almost no recollection of how he got there, he barely remembers the busy walk through the store and he’s almost surprised he made it here without getting trampled.
“Hmm. Call it a hunch.” The man says with that same knowing look that makes Tony feel a swoop somewhere around his stomach.
Steve turned in exasperation, finding Tony looking at him with complete seriousness, and Steve knew he meant every word. “We can’t just leave, Tony.”
Steve almost feels like it’s too good to be true, but decides to roll with it anyway, and follows after Tony.
“You know you’re amazing, right Steve? And I don’t mean in a ‘you save the world, so of course you’re worth something’, but I mean in a ‘Steve Rogers is the best person I know’ kind of way. Even in a charity gala when you feel awkward in a tux and surrounded by rich assholes who know all about society plate settings, you are worth more than all of them.”
“Maybe that’s a conversation for another time, baby steps. But what I’m saying is that sort of thing is a thing these days and you’re likely to come across it a few times so.” Tony sort of shrugged as best he could while holding Steve. “There you have it.”
“Don’t mind if I do.” Tony takes up a spot in the café line and feels like he’s practically drooling by the time he makes it to the counter.
“Ah, but you know, to each-” Tony finally really looked at the man beside him, and felt his words catch somewhere in his throat. The first thing he latches onto are the striking blue eyes that remind Tony of one of the many paintings Pepper always fawns over, and he was honestly starting to see the appeal. “Their own…” Tony finishes his sentence like an afterthought, and he knows he should do something to make up for going off the rails there, make an introduction, say something witty and charming, but he can’t help just staring at him. He took in the furrows in his brow and the corner of his mouth twisted up in what seems like dry amusement, and every thought just seemed to disappear from Tony’s mind, which was quite the feat for him.
“Literally always, but I’m pretty sure it was Nat’s turn to pick the after-mission food, so I am absolutely throwing you under the bus for that, she is terrifying and I am not standing in her way.”
“You’ve missed the last four board meetings, and you picked that fight with Hammer at the convention last week. This is a reminder of what happens when you leave me one too many messes to clean up.”
“The signing starts in about an hour so please make sure you show up on time, I’ll save you a seat.”
“She’s gone for now, if she doesn’t see me dancing, she will be swooping in before you know it, come on, help a guy out, Rogers.”
Then he reads about Natasha, Bruce, Clint. He glances through their light files, some basic information Fury probably included so Steve would know the people he’d be working beside. And then his eyes catch on another file, Tony Stark. A picture of him in his iron suit, and another of him in a tux.
The band starts on a slow song and Tony leads Steve through a few steps, his hand just resting on Steve’s waist like it’s nothing.
Steve kept his gaze fixed over Tony’s shoulder, “So, uh, I guess this time period is a bit more accustomed to men… dancing together?” Steve asked hesitantly, hoping desperately that he wasn’t blushing too brightly.
But then, Tony remembers the speech. The words that Steve seemed to pick out and hand deliver straight to him. “Regardless, it’s come to my attention that I may have been a bit harsh on your books.”
“Her insistence?” The man asks with a raised eyebrow, like he knows exactly what Tony wasn’t saying out loud.
Steve felt like he was rooted in place, watching Tony move with confidence, after just committing himself to dancing with Steve like it was nothing. Linda looked over at Steve with her sharp gaze and he started to feel even more on display, and he wanted desperately to be anywhere but here.
It takes about 20 minutes before Tony is bored and irritated with most of the people he’s dealt with, and the ones he’s overheard. “This is so not how I wanted to spend my Saturday.” Tony mutters to himself as he meanders through the aisles, the only saving grace of the whole thing is the fresh coffee in his hands. Though now that he’s at his usual caffeine levels, he’s starting to think it really isn’t cutting it, especially as he sees all the other people gathering around the book displays and freaking out. Tony thinks this might even be worse than a board meeting, even the ones where Campbell doesn’t shut up.
“Yeah, you’re right, maybe I should just make a break for it.” He tries to subtlety glance around, “I’ll just slip out and we’ll forget this ever happened before-”
“Yes, well I am sorry about that,” Tony waves a hand in the air dismissively, “whole thing really, I have been told in no uncertain terms that I generally lack social skills. If you are a fan of the books, you know I didn’t mean-”
“I know you’re from a different time, Cap, but in this day and age, men can dance together. Come on, old timer.” Tony waved at him and his words hit Steve somewhere below the ribs. Without thinking about it anymore, he lifts his hand to rest it in Tony’s.
He takes it gingerly, almost like he’s afraid it’ll all slip away from him. Steve wraps his arm around Tony’s waist and pulls him against his chest. He revels in the feel of the smaller man pressed against him.
Tony feels like his heart is going to climb its way out of his chest and stay here with Steve, but he forces himself to take the book and gives his patented gleaming smile, which he already knows doesn’t reach his eyes. “Nice meeting you… Rogers.” Tony says with a wink before stepping away.
Tony takes a deep breath and runs a hand through his hair absently, looking down at the ground, “There is that…” The words come out small and Tony hates that, the way they feel like they have to claw their way out of his throat. He looks back up and gives the man an assessing gaze “alright, I will concede that you seem to know what you’re talking about, and you’re not… Entirely wrong.”
Steve laughs lightly and looks up at him with what seems like fondness and it makes Tony’s stomach twist into knots. “Well, I should uh, stop holding up the line here.” He gestures to the people still waiting behind him.
Tony listened with half an ear and just as they switched gears and started setting up for signatures and people started lining up, Tony felt his heart drop into his stomach and he turned to Pepper, “I think I can make a clean getaway.”
Tony turns to find the original event host standing beside him and wearing a very bright smile. “Unfortunately.” Tony says with a sigh.
Steve could see the similarities between him and Howard, as well as the differences. It was uncomfortable thinking of Tony being Howard’s son, when it feels like Howard himself should still be here, around Tony’s age. But he wasn’t, he was dead.
Tony thinks he sees a look of surprise flash across Steve’s face, but it’s gone almost as quickly as it had come. “It was nice to meet you Steve, maybe I’ll see you around.”
“Hey, I was wondering where you’d gotten off to.” Tony steps out onto the balcony, his eyes on Steve as he approaches with a glass of champaign in hand.
Steve winces as he looks past Tony, “Right. Well, here you go. Maybe you’ll like this one better.” He hands it off to Tony with a hesitant smile and uncertain blue eyes.
“Because you skipped the last four board meetings and owe me penance.” Pepper responded casually, but Tony was almost sure he heard a note of fondness under her tone.
Steve made his way back to his little studio in Brooklyn, a meager place that he managed to get ahold of through some difficulty. It wasn’t much, but he didn’t need much these days.
You can fight the evil in your world, and you can find and build yourself a family when your own isn’t accepting, you can fall in love with someone amazing and surround yourself with the people that make you happy, even amongst the turmoil and chaos of the world around you. And I wanted people to know that everyone deserves a happy ending. Everyone deserves that chance. If you can believe that; you just might find it.”
Steve starts feeling self-conscious, worry and fears pressing in as he sees Tony just staring at him, his face unreadable and unmoving. Steve almost can’t believe he’d thought this was a good idea, who was he kidding? Tony might be into guys as well, but that doesn’t mean he’s into Steve.
Steve set the punching bag down, the loud thump seeming to bounce off the walls in the empty space. He leaned against the wall, looking around for a moment. Some days it was hard to wrap his mind around it, this new world, the memory of the one he knew at such odds with his new reality.
“Sure, you did.” The man moves forward, reaching an arm out to pick up the book Tony had just put back, his arm barely brushes up against Tony’s shoulder, but it feels like electricity is running through his veins. Tony’s eyes follow that arm of their own volition, the short sleeve shirt seemingly painted on every muscle the guy has.
“Or just unlucky enough to end up in my blast zone when I got tired of monologuing in my head.” Tony quips back.
“Okay I was harsh and I’m sorry about that. But I still stand by the fact that your science definitely needs some refinement, just for the record.”
A deep voice cuts into Tony’s thoughts, and he can’t help the derisive laugh that escapes him. “Hardly. They're honestly mediocre books, at best. The science and tech they reference get it right about half of the time, I mean, did he even do any research? And sure, not everyone is an expert on these things, and it’s fiction so even I can look past that, but the worst part is how optimistic it all is. It’s all about ‘doing the right thing’, and the belief that humanity is good at heart? Bullshit. People suck, grey areas exist and generally the world is awful.
Tony thanks the baristas and makes his way back over to Pepper, with a much better outlook on life now that he has his lifeline in hand. He sidles up to Pepper and she tries to reach for one of the coffees, but he pulls it back, “oh no, these are mine thank you.”
“I talked with someone about my books recently.” Steve’s voice rings out over the crowd and catches Tony’s attention, bringing his gaze back to the front and seeing Steve looking back out at him.
It’s only one night a few days later, after too many drinks and too many thoughts that he picks up the book and reads the signature over a glass of whiskey. “Call me an optimist.” And beneath the signature that reads Steve Rogers is a phone number.
"Ah, I had asked him not to go running off. He's just trying to do what I asked, for once, recently. Why don't you just..."
Tony was. Right there to meet him, Steve's bare toes curling back down into the luxuriant warmth of the thick carpet, and the rest of him curling in and wrapping his arms around the luxuriant warmth of Tony's solid frame, filling a wide open space he'd never known was so empty.
He’d been sleepy-sated smiling, but molasses-silky silence had turned sulky, terse and skittish. Steve could feel it, and he knew Tony had noticed. But no pressure came to bear except the perfectly steamed water; Tony hadn’t pushed at all, had given space. He’d remained the same considerate, generous lover -- or was he just accustomed to these awkward afters?
“Of course you are,” she agreed, with a mouth full of big, round, caramel-sugared vowels and sweet cream.
It didn't help much when Tony started rattling off a string of numbers and fractions that after a few seconds, Steve put together as dimensions for a large rectangular area. At least their host could tell what Tony was talking about.
He stared at her, bent over on the chair frame, just waiting for his cock. His cock that she wanted bare, wanted with nothing between them, wanted to be filled with his come, to walk away from here with it leaking from her fucked-out hole, even more obscene than how she’d walked in leaking lube.
She crowded back into him, dropping her head backward in a dangling trust fall onto his shoulder. Her gel-pieced hair brushed scratchy-soft above his collar, and her long inhale at his pulse point felt like air sucking out of his own lungs. The door clicked open and she left him with a teasing scrape of teeth at the corner of his jaw, pushing off and righting herself in a snapping arc that ground her ass against his groin, steadied on his hands like the dip and raise of an impromptu pas de deux.
He was a pressure chamber, steam mounting fuller and higher, boiling to a head, and… He blew, clamping down around her, crying out and pulsing and spurting, shuddering through the aftershocks till he felt peeled inside-out by the force of his orgasm.
"Thank you for acknowledging that. Fortunately, the Avengers are bigger than this, and Tony and I are adults, and we'll continue to be able to work together in the field."
"So there was never any threat? If we didn't--" The hint of a blush appeared high on Steve's cheeks.
He ventured to experiment, but found he preferred the more plain; not sweet, but astringence or spice, a hint, only. The less he could smell on himself, the less in the way of enjoying every exotic essence embellishing Tony’s.
. That Tony had said it so easily, like he didn't have to give it a thought or question in the world, made Steve feel giddy and special in a way that even the awe of people meeting him as Captain America didn't.
Tony squeezed his eyes closed and took a deep breath before opening them again. "Nothing to fix, Cap. You had a little thing for me. I'm sorry you had to find out it wasn't mutual. And we both did what we thought we had to do. Look at the bright side! At least you got to have me once--"
A savage impulse, towering and avaricious, went marauding through his skull, rushing in his ears and blotting out his brain. He rose to his toes with a snap of his hips, dropped to a slight bend of his knees, slid his shaft up and down between her cheeks and felt her pick up his rhythm.
. (Ok, that, and punching Nazis, and being the best body pillow in the history of the world, but still. Pep talks.)
“It sounds really easy when you say it like that, but basically, yeah…” Bruce looks down at the chart in his hands before turning towards Helen. “I suggest we get him into an MRI. No CT, he doesn’t need much more radiation than he already has.”
He startles a bit when the covers are suddenly pulled up. Then there’s a presence in the bed with him; Steve spooning up behind him, wrapping his arm over Tony’s waist and resting his head above the other man’s shoulder. It warms Tony up from inside, but he’s still not feeling like responding to it.
“I know, but applying that term to me makes it sound like I’ve got a midlife crisis,” Tony mutters, mostly to himself. Of course, Steve would hear it!
"I know, that's why I'm making this." Tony holds up the small device he's putting together. "They'll work as glasses, and it'll photograph exactly what you see, send it out to this little monster and print out the picture. At least with that you'll
Wanda comes back with Barnes. This time, nobody stops talking. Neither do they when Steve returns with his guards. Bruce takes his place behind them. When Dr. Strange walks up to his place, he gives Peter a long stare before looking away. His friend Wong isn’t anywhere near him. Did he stay in New York, then?
“I’m so going to get fired,” Peter mutters, searching for the last-called number and pressing the phone against his ear. Once he gets to his locker, he quickly looks around to see who’s near him. Then he opens up to put his math-stuff back inside and grab the biology-books.
“Eh, most of them are alright. You just need to be lucky,” he shrugs. Just as he finishes his sentence, a taxi comes to a screeching halt in front of them, revealing none other than freaking
“Right,” he tells himself, following after the Cat. There are no flames in this particular room, but when they get to a door, the Cat gives Peter a short look, awaiting his approval. Once Peter nods the two of them kick out their leg towards the door to smash it open. Immediately, hot flames fly into their faces, so the two of them jump back to avoid getting hit.
At one point, the person Peter’s dancing with is Johnny, who seems to have lost his quest for the day and is already pretty far gone. The guy’s blonde hair is slicked back instead of in its messy, long state. His eyes are glassy, red even. Peter’s not even sure if alcohol is the only thing the guy took. It wouldn’t be surprising, given the color of his eyes.
“What were you thinking, Peter? You scared me to death,” Steve whispers against his head, lips pressed into Peter’s hair. The teenager just tightens the hug.
“You do what you want, man, I’m not stopping you,” Peter assures him. Johnny claps his hands together while looking forward pensively. Probably already trying to find a way to woo her. Peter wishes him luck, not really knowing if Felicia’s really
Yeah, no, that’s not going to happen. Two sutures have been enough, thank you very much. Even quicker than the five men can react, Peter shoots out five more webs, one almost immediately after the other. Still, one of the guys is quick enough to respond before the gun is pulled out of his hand, and before Peter knows it there’s a gun headed his way.
After Steve leaves, it takes another twenty minutes for the front door to open again, only now revealing Natasha walking towards them. She smiles at Peter, and then flicks Tony on the head, earning her an annoyed ‘hey’ from the man. She ignores him, instead sitting down on the couch as well and throwing her legs over Tony’s
By the second of July, the Avengers head out again. This time, it’s to Lagos. Once again, Rhodey and Vision stay at home, though this time it’s mostly because Rhodey is joining Tony to the presentation, and Vision stays at the compound to guard the place (and keep an eye on Yaël, since everybody seems to be intent on making sure she doesn’t blow anything up). There’s radio silence from them, though neither Tony nor Peter can really think about it. The seventh is the day of the presentation. With Aunt May, Peter, Tony
“You know, you’re going to regret saying that eventually,” Tony teases him. He puts his hands on Steve’s hips, pulling him closer again, startling Steve in the process. The two chuckle.
There’s also the darker things going on, like Wanda and Vision failing at their first attempt to create a child. It was sad, because Tony actually saw the two boys, the babies. They had looked healthy, ready for life. But bad shit happened, and they’re just… no longer there. It’s safe to say that Wanda didn’t really take it all that well.
“You were still holding back a bit, otherwise I would’ve been unconscious,” Yaël stated, Steve simply nodded. “So, what’s up with you today,” she asked while putting up her thumb in the air to sign to Charles and Scott that she was alright. They went to get Steve’s bag and then they walked towards the exit, where the two mutants were still standing after watching the training like it had been a show.
“Smartass,” Pepper returns. Tony shrugs smugly, leaning forward to kiss her cheeks before walking off.
“Yes, they did marry,” Peter answers. Tony doesn’t know what that weird tugging in his chest is all of the sudden. His friendship with Mary had been something he cherished for long even after she made it clear she wouldn’t see him again. She’s probably one of the first people he genuinely loved, and he had on multiple occasions even almost asked her out, only to whimp out at the last second.
She looked back at the black-haired man and yelled “Hi!” but he didn’t seem to hear her. She yelled again and started knocking on the glass wall in front of her. The man finally looked up and froze as he met her eyes.
“I can understand why they’re here, but I think it would have been better if they hadn’t been made. There’s so much shit going on now, and we can’t even help out…”
“Hey Aunti Peg!” Tony calls out once he walks through the door. He waits for Peter to get inside before closing it again, drops his vest on the coat-hanger, and then walks towards the chair Peggy is sitting in. She’s seated at the window, staring outside with an empty look in her eyes.
“Eh, maybe another time?” he offers. He knows it’s college and that he’s supposed to just go out and have fun, but honestly? Hanging out with MJ tonight sounds ten times better. “You just go to your party. And you know the rule!”
Slightly out of breath, Peter looks around to see that an entire crowd has already surrounded them. People who had been laughing are now looking with wide eyes and open mouths. Some of Flash’s friends are already trying to help him back up.
Remembering that it had been raining when he returned home, Peter grabs his coat from the hanger before putting his backpack on. He quickly looks down to see if his suit isn’t showing under his shirt, and then he takes the papers back, puts them in the bag, and heads out of the door while still throwing it over his shoulder.
“Peter, honey, wake up,” Tony whispers out. He jumps out of his suit, pulling Peter’s off as well. Knowing everything about the iron spider, he removes it completely, taking Peter’s frail form into his arms. Pulling him close to himself, he starts rocking him around. “C’mon baby boy, open those eyes, huh? Give me something.”
Harry, on the other hand, while smart, also is lazy. Even when he was a kid he was always under the impression that he would succeed either way, mostly due to his father’s money. It seems like the habit stuck.
With shaky hands he picks it up without thinking too much about it. He rubs his eyes as he slurs out a greeting.
“Yes,” he says then. People cheer, Steve jumps up from his seat and holds up his hands in a questioning gesture.
“Do you think somebody poisoned him?” she asks with a shaky voice. The way she speaks, Tony can tell she’s trying to hold back her tears. He’s not going to comment on it, because he’s pretty sure he’s in the same state.
“Now, this suit is not yet available for you. I just wanted to give you a sneak peek as to what you can expect when you get to change my mind.”
They walk around the city for about an hour. Peter divides his attention to listening to Harry and looking for Venom at the same time. He can hear the other Avengers in his ear. Tony and Bruce aren’t too successful, though they’re constantly trying to assess where Peter is. Steve, Rhodey and May don’t have much luck, either. Peter figures New York is pretty big, after all.
“Not like we have the money for it, anyway,” Peter mutters, thinking back of how his aunt and he are barely getting through with paying the bills as they are. She’s already doing extra shifts at the hospital behind his back, and he’s been trying different jobs and managed to finally find one that didn’t get him fired after the first week, even though it barely pays.
“Captain Rogers,” a familiar voice suddenly says. Steve tenses up, turning around to find none other than Loki standing there, fully in black-golden-green gowns. He’s wearing an alternate version of the helmet Steve saw when he first met him (or rather fought him). The god of mischief is keeping his hands behind his back, though his face looks serious.
Yaël totally didn’t know how to react to that, but it seemed like they didn’t expect her to as they just kept talking. They clearly didn’t need to hear her condolences for something that happened years ago.
“My name is Isse,” Yaël changed her name into a Norwegian one, since the queen forced everyone in the city to change their names to Norwegian or at least Sil names as soon as her reign had started. Using her own name would’ve been the dumbest move ever, because she must be the only one in the realm with still a name from before the Queen’s Era. “And I found this thief as he was trying to break into the Royal Library!”
Getting upstairs, Peter wonders if it’s even such a good idea to search through the bedrooms. He might just see things he doesn’t want to see at all.
suddenly sounds from next to him, and that manages to distract Peter immediately. Before he knows it, the Goblin’s glider moves forward once more, hurrying towards him and hitting him with such a force that his breath is taken out of his lungs immediately. Before he can really think anything, he drops into the ice-cold water with the Goblin’s full weight upon him.
Once he returns back inside, having dropped the girl with the paramedics, Peter looks around hastily, in search for the Cat somewhere around here. His ears try to catch anything, but the sound of fire snapping into wood is loud enough to full everything around him.
Wait, wasn’t he supposed to stay in the tower? Peter blinks a few times, suddenly confused. Because of that, he misses his next cue and slams against the wall of the next building. Painfully, he lets out a groand.
Peter frowns under his mask, still waiting for Karen to continue her identifying-scan of the Cat’s face. So far she seems to have no luck. He can’t speak, afraid of her hearing it. Instead, he just decides to go along for now.
,” she warns them, and the two men pull apart as quickly as they can. While Steve is rubbing his lips as if to drying them off, Tony is taking out his phone and pretending to look something up. By the time the door opens, the two already have enough space between them so that she wouldn’t notice anything.
“Save me the formality,” he says. Then he grabs Toomes’ hand and twists it painfully, not letting go. Toomes makes a painful sound, but he knows better than to scream. He already has a black eye from his beating earlier. He surely doesn’t want to cause too much of a scene. “We have some things to talk about.”
Peter tried to keep his distance, but it took one month for him to realize he couldn’t. He stayed with Gwen, eventually, and for a long while they were together – not extremely happy, since both of them were still grieving, but happy enough.
Yet, she didn’t think about it for too long as she immediately started dehydrating the first few guards. They started shooting around in panic as they felt something was changing in their bodies, and accidentally killed a few of their colleagues. No problem, less work for Yaël. She quickly ducked away as a few of the laser-shot flew into her direction.
He can’t really say what happened. After his latest argument with his dad, he figures he’s just had about enough of it; the constant accusations, the doubts, the lack of trust. He’s always tried his best to be a good son, but apparently it’s never enough. And he’s tired of it.
Right, Tony said earlier that he would prepare a bedroom for Peter at the tower – not at the compound, since, according to him, it’s not really a safe place to stay at (probably with the fact that they've got Harry locked up there somewhere). To add to that, Tony also seems to have decided to move back, reclaiming his penthouse on the top floor.
He needed the stone, he found out she was carrying it, so he made her believe her gave a crap about her just so she’d follow him. And the reason why he started fighting as they were going to put the switch in her head, was probably because he didn’t want to take the risk that her powers would be weakened by it, or something like that.
“Nope,” he said while mashing the potatoes. “Cap said you’d want us to leave him alone about it, as he is busy with his internship with Stark ‘n stuff. I think something is wrong there, with Stark, but Steve didn’t really talk about it.”
“I trust you know the risks there were when I traveled you to New York last time?” T’Challa explains. “Risks for you, risks for me, and for your teammates, including Mr. Stark
“Talked to MJ at all today?” Johnny continues. Peter looks down at the phone, typing down his PIN and waiting for the messages to come in. And there are a few. At first some casual messages from MJ, where she tells him she’s heading to her grandmother in Oakland. The next one is some random memory she shares of when her grandmother took her to Coney Island and they got stuck on the ferris wheel for almost an entire hour. The third message is one where she adds into detail that she got scared from the height and had started puking in the cabinet they were in. It goes on and on, random messages.
How did he die? Yaël tried to ask, but there was no sound coming from her mouth. All she could do was helplessly stare at her dead friend. Another one that she failed to keep safe. But how did she fail him? How could she? Yaël hadn’t even known he had been in danger! She should’ve been there for him, with him, wherever he had been or still was. Her steps didn’t take her closer to her fallen friend, her brother. Instead, she could only watch and listen how a dad gets torn apart after seeing his son die.
Peter goes up into the elevator, leaning against the side with his forehead against the mirror. Shit, this is not how he intended his day to go.
“The kid doesn’t count,” Steve retorts. “There’s also no choice in the matter. The others have already agreed and are working out a schedule on who will take which shift.”
“Thanks,” Yaël answered with a wide grin “They are so cool! I mean like, who the heck has plates like these?”
“You know what’s funny? When you see me like this, you look at me like I’m the wise old man, the professor, the one you should respect, the one who’s ‘more important’ than you are. Yet, you are older than I am. Even when you saw me back there, with my younger features, you still seemed to forget that we’re at least equals.”
“I’d like to think we are, yes,” Natasha says, smiling at him before pulling away again. “If you’ll have me?”
Everybody stops talking. While the twins are still outside, Vision and Wanda, too, listen in at the door. Tony, who is still holding his glass, loosens his tie a little bit before starting.
“Oh, that’s just convenient, isn’t it?” she mutters. “If you want to follow into your Dad’s footsteps of his early days, you should do whatever you want. I’m not going to be any part of it.”
I still have to fix the mistakes of the previous few chapters. I'm having a nasty cold, and I can't really look at my screen without getting a bad headache, so I'll have to postpone that for later!
But now Peter is free again, and the first thing he does is put back on the suit and swing his way through the streets of New York.
“Jason,” he said with a modest smile. Yaël shook his hand and mumbled her name back. He sat down next to her. The whole room was filled with chairs, but this handsome monster just HAD to sit next to her. “So are you here for an interview too? I’m here for the job as receptionist, they needed another, extra one. It’s a busy company.”
“Here we go,” he mutters to himself, looking up and giving Steve an exaggerated smile. “Hi honey, how are you doing?”
It's a short one. Caspinn and I came up with it a while back when we were discussing baby-names for Yaël's kid.
As for the tower, the penthouse is still there. Nobody lives there, though. It’s more of a… available space in case anything were to happen to Peter’s house, or their house. That, or it’s for when Peter needs to stay at the tower for a longer while and only has a few hours to sleep before he needs to start again.
Has he been gone so long that the Avengers would have moved from the tower to somewhere else? Have they all forgotten him in a spell gone wrong? But then, what’s the deal with Uncle Ben?
“Steve, hi, uh,” Tony starts after his twentieth attempt. “I know, you’re angry. I would be angry, too. I said some bad shit and I insulted you in the process. I’m sorry, I never meant for that. I can’t keep my emotions in check, and I should have talked to you instead of holding it in.”
Steve then asks. Tony stops mid-yawn, realizing his mistake there. Right, they’re no longer together. Tony broke it off a few days ago. Officially, that is.
Peter nods, swallowing a hard lump through his throat and taking a deep breath. He knows he would say yes in a heartbeat if he was normal. But he isn’t. He doesn’t know what effect it could have on Tony if he would give up a part of his liver to save him. The same thing could happen to him like it did with Harry.
“So, uh, is it alright if I come along this weekend?” he dares to ask, casually without building up to it. That way, they can already feel it coming and have a longer time to think of an excuse not to take him along.
Tony smiles at him, crawling forward carefully without messing up his leg. Then he leans over Steve, their eyes never leaving. One practiced hand swiftly moves underneath Steve’s shirt, tracking every inch of skin he can find there. He kisses him after that, their lips meeting with equal enthusiasm. He can feel Steve’s breath against his cheeks, hears Steve’s heart beating now that he’s close enough and wondering if Steve can hear his as well.
“Be as it may, Mr. Stark, it is obvious that your priorities are elsewhere. And that is acceptable, but we still need you to throw us a bone here. At least hire some new engineers, of stimulate the current ones to think out of the box. Or perhaps it’s time to think about letting your son-“
FRIDAY suddenly adds without Peter having to ask for it. The teenager hums while leaning back in his chair.
“I’m annoying him,” he tells the android, who looks up and tilts his head a bit to the side. Peter just rolls his eyes.
It was the same day Miles found out about the pregnancy-scare they had. As it turns out, they weren’t expecting and never mentioned a word about it to the others. Miles never brought it up. MJ could be a bit scary, after all, when she’s angry. Like the Hulk, only less green and less large.
he got knocked on the ground. Peter jumps out of the way, seeing a black-and-blue boot only just missing its target, that one being his face.
“Holy shit, Korg! You can’t just storm into rooms like that! What are you doing?” Yaël grumbled, aiming her hand back to the arena, together with her other hand.
If she remembers the whole ordeal about Tony drunkenly standing in front of her house, requesting to speak to Mary, she doesn’t let it show at all. The moment she arrived at the Compound, after Tony called her, she’s only been nice to him.
Dr. Cho doesn’t say anything else, instead just patting his back a little bit while he tries to control his breath. It takes about a minute before he’s back to normal, but even then he still feels like his head is spinning.
In the end, Tony does take Peter along to grab something to eat. It’s not a chocolate bar, but it’s still a good restaurant. Dressed again as himself with the suit safely tucked in the hotel room, Peter finds himself at the table with Rhodey, Vision and Bruce. They’re all talking to each other about the accords, discussing what they think is good and what they figure isn’t really a good idea. Vision is adding his comments in between eating his portions.
“Detention? But I can’t! I have my internship!” She can’t do this; after his fiasco last Saturday at the tower, he fears he’s already in enough trouble as it is. He can’t risk getting on everybody’s bad side even more! Before long, they’ll see him as a joke!
“He’s- uh…” and Steve stars explaining what Peter all told him. He lets it all out of his chest; the phone calls he’s been making, the urgency in which Tony wanted to hang up with him, the disappointment in Peter’s voice. He lets it all out. And Wanda puts her hand on his shoulder and squeezes it. Sam moves forward and does the same.
“Mr. Stark, are you with us?” another, unfamiliar voice asks. Tony lifts his head up to the source of the sound, but doesn’t speak. He can’t, his voice doesn’t want to help. Instead he nods. Yes, he’s with them. Though he doesn’t know where exactly it is. It couldn’t be this darkness. “You’ve been in surgery, sir. You returned to your room this morning, and you’ve been asleep ever since. Can you open your eyes for us?”
“You know, with good grades, there’s the better chance you’ll be accepted in better universities. I suppose your aunt only wants you to prepare yourself to get ready for college,” Dr. Cho says.
? What is she on about? Steve, too, looks surprised, though clearly not for the same reason Peter is. “Oh yeah, apparently I’m an alien from outer space. Who knew, right?”
Johnny and Peter's mouth fall open, just as their eyes open wide as well. Tony, too, falls a bit silent after that, stopping mid-movement while he was stretching his arm. Then, both Johnny and Peter burst it out in laughter. Steve and Tony startle, turning towards the two teenagers who are getting tears in their eyes and aches in their stomach. After that, Tony stands up, taking his cup of coffee and kissing Steve on the cheek.
“Electrical Engineering?” Peter asks out loud, pointing his hands at the folder on his bed, “or biochemistry?”
“He’s just busy with a presentation today, he doesn’t need to be bothered with stuff like this.” That, and he could rage some more against her. She didn’t want to give him that pleasure, even though she remembered the doubt she had seen on his face after he had walked into her bedroom the day she arrived at the compound. Maybe he wasn’t such a big dick as he let her stay in the compound after all.
“The Avengers are falling apart, Yaël. They’re taking away our freedom, trying to make us a governmental pawn,” even though he always had a calm-looking appearance, Yaël could feel his frustration radiate.
"What's taking you so long, Steve?" Tony suddenly asks. Peter startles, being used to the silence that he hadn't noticed Steve hasn't said anything.
“It’s what you always do, Tony!” Steve calls out a bit louder than intended. He notices a few people looking at him. “Uh, sorry.”
“I’m sorry, Steve!” Peter calls out after him. Steve shakes his head, but he doesn’t respond to it. Instead, he leans to the side, pressing his head against the wall while he tries to get over his hurt pride.
“Peter! I know you’re near!” a voice sings out. It sounds vaguely familiar, but not like from somebody he’s talked to a lot. Carefully, Peter rolls back on his side, forcing himself back on his feet.
Tony lets out a shaky laugh, almost too scared to hope. He balls his hands into fists right before he gets himself airborne again. The school isn’t far, so he’s there quickly. Not bothering to get out of his suit, he storms inside the building all the way to where he knows Charles’ office is.
While some people go ice skating, or get to a fancy dinner or a dancing, MJ and Peter just feed the homeless, with the odd few protesting on the side whenever the occasion arises.
“Yeah, sure! Oh, and your wife’s inside, she’ll want to see you! Looks like that Stark dicked you over again, didn’t he?”
“Great,” one of the guards mumbled. The other one snickered. “Okay, whatever, Audun, you go check on the library guards and place new ones, I’ll bring those two to the king.”
“I know… got thrown into the mud,” he explains. Tony feels the corners of his lips go up, and then he blinks a few more times before turning back to the hallway that leads to his room. He has no doubt that Steve would follow him once he’s washed up.
“Okay you got me extremely interested up until that last part,” he tells him. “Let’s just head back, I’ll work something out with Wade and I’ll meet you up at the cycle, alright?”
“Surprised. A bit shocked. And at the same time also extremely proud in a way?” Steve admits. Peter smiles happily. “I mean, it’s probably for the best that you went last. I don’t think any of us would have dared to go after this…”
“Hi, Dads! Did you guys sleep well? These beds are amazing, don’t you think? I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud, it’s insane!”
“Peter, get inside,” Tony instructs Peter when the kid seems to hesitate a little while longer. Peter nods before hurrying into the car, taking a seat next to Tony. He claps his hands between his knees and waits for Happy to start driving. Tony still keeps his gaze away from the teenager next to him.
Wanda and Vision offer him to try and build something. But while Vision tells him to go for something practical, Wanda says to make something that comes out from her heart. In the end, Peter left the two as they were starting up an argument he didn’t want to be a part of.
“Tony?” Steve asks. Tony blinks up at him, eyes stinging. Steve looks sad, heartbroken upon seeing him like this. It sucks, Tony never meant to make him this worried. Steve’s hands go up to Tony’s cheeks, and he holds his face in a semi-tight grip. “Are you with me?”
Yaël let go of her mother and sprinted towards her father, who caught her in his arms and put her onto his lap. The little Yaël started fiddling with his still blonde beard. He told her in Sil, while he was still carving in the piece of wood, that the neighbours got blessed with a son and they had named him Rozenrød.
“Yeah, yeah, Mr. Philosopher,” Peter mutters out. “Let’s just get the two separated without getting anybody killed.”
“Okay, kid, I can’t stand this sight any longer,” he says, and then he lowers his healthy hand back on the desk. “FRIDAY, can you call up Mrs. Terrence? Tell her to bring some antiseptic and bandages for multiple cut-wounds.”
Steve should be used to it; to having Tony talk about himself in such a low way, like he isn’t important enough. It happens so often, almost three times every week, but yet again it hurts Steve so much in the chest, knowing that somebody he cares about so much thinks so poorly about himself. Steve sighs, walking forward and putting his hands on Tony’s shoulders.
Peter looks down at the suit, thinking back of how he’s been postponing on making a new one. It’s falling apart, being sewn together too often and now ripping almost constantly. Now it looks fine, but he knows he’s got a rip on the back that he hasn’t gotten around to fixing, yet.
Peter pulls his eyebrows together, putting a finger against his chin as he tries to think. Biggest pan in the world? Is there even such a thing? Isn’t it just impractical to have a too big pan in the world?
Tony starts, but Peter doesn’t stick around to listen. He drops himself down in a freefall, breaking his momentum just in time. His landing is right in front of Strange, who has just been thrown across the street, smashing against a car.
They’re having lunch when Peter sees her. He’s at the table with Ned, discussing the new Star Wars movie they did eventually watch a few weeks back when suddenly a third person joins their table. It’s the moment Peter sees the fiery red hair that he groans.
Yaël fell back on her knees and let the unconsciousness finally take her over again. Sometimes she woke up, hearing Nilla curse. Then she saw the moon, but the next time she saw the sun coming up. Sometimes she heard sirens, but there was no hope as this alley she was laying in was so small and unnoticeable. She was sweating, but she was cold on the same time and she had no energy left to get up and go search for help. She tried it sometimes, but it only led her back to complete darkness.
She couldn’t wait to be home again and visit Peter and tell him about space, but she still wasn’t sure he had survived the fight. And Steve, Yaël missed Steve, the humble giant. The superhero that felt like a normal man, taking his jogs in the park whenever he wanted to. But when was she ever going to get home?
If so, he should really start looking up schools, no? Besides, what should he even study? It’s not like photography interests him enough for him to pursuit a career in it. And okay, yes, he’s kind of good in building things, but no way will he ever get close to Stark’s level, right?
“That’s… oh,” Tony then lets out in a gasp for air. Why does his chest feel so tight? Why does it suddenly hurt when he looks this kid in the eyes? Is it because he reminds him of his own status as an orphan? Peter had been that much younger than Tony had been, so this kid actually had to grow up without his parents.
In only a matter of seconds does Peter reply, saying that, yes, he’s got the weekend off for a change. He’s already planned on spending one of those two days with Aunt May at the museum, but other than that he’s got 24 hours more of freedom before school and the internship start again.
Steve sighs, putting down his sketchbook and instead grabbing the remote control to go through the channels for a little bit. Peter observes him for a few seconds, trying to figure out if there’s something actually wrong with him.
Peter takes a deep breath and then sighs out, thinking of how he’s doing at the moment. He’s only sixteen, but he knows what the doctors diagnosed him with; PTSD, recurring flash-backs of what happened back at the tower, with Harry’s. He knows it’s the reason why his school performance has been dropping. Why he hasn’t tried to make contact with other people to make new friends.
Tony smiles a bit, but he doesn’t nod. Instead, he closes his eyes and leans forward, indicating that Steve can do as he pleases. It’s slow, thrilling, almost as if Tony’s about to kiss Steve for the first time again, only the second time. Yet, the moment their lips as much as caress each other, there’s a loud noise coming around them.
Surprise! Two chapters again. I'm in a good mood. Probably because I've just started writing chapter 33 and it's feels again all the way. I shoul start rounding it up.
“Come on,” Yaël said with an unbelieving smile on her face. “Like you are going to leave a room filled with people staring at you to come and check on me. I know you’re not really standing in front of me!” She gave his leg a friendly tap with her elbow, expecting him to disappear, but the man felt solid.
What he doesn’t know, really, is how he got here. He’s sure that his self-destructing tendencies have caused for him to shut everybody out of the penthouse, but somehow somebody managed to get inside and get him out of there, and Tony’s very sure that person is not FRIDAY. She hadn’t even been allowed to call for help.
So Tony goes downstairs, gets to the lab and starts to get to work. JARVIS informs him of a few incoming calls, but Tony dismisses them all. He doesn’t stop until he gets JARVIS completely connected to the nanites, hearing his familiar and comforting voice inside his head.
With that, the conversation is over. They don’t bring it up again after Peter’s bought his new phone. Even after he got the new controller for the Playstation, he feels better about not mentioning Spider-Man or the Black Cat again.
When she gained consciousness, Yaël tried to open her eyes, but she could only keep them open for a few seconds. Everything looked blurry, but she could distinguish the fire somewhere above her, coming from the hole in her wall, leading to the hallway next to her apartment. Something smelled awful, like burned flesh. She knew exactly where she was: the trash-alley. Her head felt too heavy to even think about the fact that she was laying in dirt, stench and months old thrash. The only thing that was filling her mind, was the pain she felt, so it didn’t take her long to go unconscious again.
“Now don’t go running off with it, it’s like my third phone this year,” she mumbles out, a bit in annoyance.
That’s when he finds a part of the strange gun that fell out of the car during the chase. He kneels down to observe it a bit, finding a purple glow coming out of it. That’s probably the power source, Peter’s mind tells him. Before he can pick it up, Ned’s ringtone comes up again. Peter picks up immediately this time.
Tony doesn’t know when he falls asleep. It’s probably a miracle that, during that time, Peter hasn’t moved. Tony’s awakened by somebody shaking his shoulder, causing for him to jump up and almost waking Peter up in the process. Peter, who shifts a bit in his sleep and makes a small complaining sound but doesn’t otherwise move.
He doesn’t even bother to change back into his own clothes. Peter throws himself down on the bed, face down in to the pillow. The coat is actually rather uncomfortable, and it stings in some spots. But Peter doesn’t care.
“You don’t know that, Tony,” Steve assures him. Peter is almost at the door. “Now please, tell me how much you took?”
Oh, the guy would never understand just how much Tony can relate to that. It’s obvious in the man’s expression that he’s suffering from even saying it. It makes Tony feel a little guilty for hating him this much.
To be fair, she’s aware that Tony never really got along with Steve. It’s partly because their personalities just clash, but also because of the way Tony has been raised. Thinking himself undeserving of Steve’s friendship, things have been tense, to say the least.
“Am I wrong or did you also think I had some sort of relationship with Steve the first time you met him, after he had stayed a night in my apartment?”
Tony shrugs. “Something I’m pretty sure the other you is going to have my head for, but what’s done is done, right?”
“You know, when I programmed you I probably added a little bit too much of sarcasm. Maybe I should take some back?” he threatens her.
“Yeah, just sit down for a moment, Petey,” Steve tells him, nodding towards the couch. He notices Steve giving Tony a long look. With a lump stuck in his throat, he sits down on his assigned seat and takes a deep breath.
“I, uh- he got them from me in case of an emergency,” Tony admits. “Clearly, I was wrong to give them to him.”
FRIDAY tells him. Tony groans, dropping his head on the table after he finds that, while his phone is still on with more than half battery, there aren’t any messages at all. Everything just sucks. “
In his annoyance Tony turns to his side, looking at Steve’s peaceful face. Asleep, it’s hard to see how troubled the man must be. And still they haven’t talked this evening. Tony gave him the distraction he needed, but after that he was just too tired to do any form of discussion. So instead Tony called up Peter, forced Steve to speak up a little, too, and after that call Steve went to sleep.
With the sunlight shining right into the workshop, Peter notices immediately that there’s something missing. Or rather, someone…
He debates about taking a cab or using the suit, but feeling the need to just be ‘normal’ for a moment, he decides to go with the first option. In his mind, he makes up a note to get some new pills at his new appointment to Dr. Thatch.
“After I’m out of here, I promise you, Tony, I promise the world can know about us. I’ll announce it on live tv for all that matters. I’m not ashamed, Tony, I never was. I was just… wrong. So wrong.”
“Alright, alright,” he mutters. “I’m sorry, Peter. I just- I wouldn’t know what to do if anything would ever happen to you.”
“Uh, yeah, he kind of saved the man. Peter somehow opened the doors, even though Tony had told FRIDAY not to let anyone in. Why?”
“No, not ever! You see, I’m banished, I don’t even have the right to get married.” By being drunk, she accidentally started mixing her memories of the two worlds she had been living in.
It takes five more minutes of talking about superhero-names before Peter finally takes his leave, and after that he takes the little Vespa to return back to the pizzeria. The place is already closed, but he knows where to park the thing so it’s not that much of an issue. Though, he’s sure Aunt May wouldn’t like the fact that he hadn’t told her where he’d been.
It’s already been a day with way too much happening. Scratch that, not a day. A whole freaking week or so. This shit with Johnny, then MJ, then Uncle Ben’s killer, then finding out he freaking DIED in an alternate reality his dads fixed (That part has not quite yet sunk in, so Peter figures it’s going to take a little bit before he realizes he actually
“Tony, I don’t know what happened to you but I thought I made it obvious that I didn’t want to see you again?”
The roof is small – mostly due to the special design of the tower. If he looks down, he can already see the flying deck from the Avenger’s floor. That floor has by now once again changed into Mr. Stark’s penthouse, of course, since the heroes have relocated to the compound upstate.
They stopped at her door. On the other side of the hallway that was so small only two people could walk side by side, was a window. It was completely useless because it couldn’t open. Yaël tried it many times, because the hallway always smelled like sweat and she wanted to refresh it.
He wonders why exactly he made that appointment; is it because he just wants to talk to Stark? Or has he unconsciously decided that he
People laugh. Instead of saying anything, Tony just stands up. He leaves the microphone on his chair and starts moving forward. Once he nears Peter, he reaches his hands out. Peter recognizes the gesture, running into Tony’s arms and the two holding each other in a strong embrace. The crowd once again makes a cooing sound as they see them, and it becomes even louder and filled with screams when Steve, too, joins the hug. Chrissy, once again, takes out her phone to take a quick picture of it.
FRIDAY doesn’t answer, but Tony knows she’ll listen to him. That’s why she’s such a wonderful AI, after all. Tony quickly looks to the side to check the hour, finding that it’s almost eleven a.m., on a Monday. But that doesn’t mean much for traffic; it’s New York. There’s always traffic.
Her sight on fathers probably was more magical than reality. She once had a father, though. A very sweet, good man. It’s weird how things can change so enormously. It’s weird how she’d be able to imagine Cem walking her to the aisle but knowing that never happened nor ever will happen.
“I don’t know, I haven’t seen the video Michelle sent me. Apparently somebody filmed it, but I haven’t really dared to look at it.”
The rest of the night is filled with watching Netflix and talking about school. Whenever Miles wants to find out more about what his Uncle’s been up to, he only gets vague answers that don’t reveal too much.
Peter closes his eyes. There’s nothing left for him to do; he’s going to drown here, and that’s how it’s going to happen. He’s been a fool, way over his head…
“You know what?! I’m so done with your shit. We’re getting divorced!” Tony snaps, bursting through the door opening and storming into the hallway. He doesn’t even look at Bruce and Peter as he passes them by. Peter blinks a few times, surprised at what just happened.
“Anyway,” Charles says in an attempt to get their attention back. “I know the two of you have been taking some time off from the field. I was hoping that perhaps, Captain Rogers, you would be interested in helping Wade along on a better path?”
Yaël woke up with a shock, gasping for air. But there was some sort of oxygen mask blocking her mouth. When she started grabbing it to get it away, her body hurt like hell by the movement. But yet, she was stubborn and pulled off the mask. She dropped it on the ground, breathing way too fast.
“Okay, I think I found the issues in your memory, but it’s going to be tricky to dig into it without you slipping away again. So, I want you to listen to me very carefully. You do whatever I say, immediately, yes?”
He’s prevented from answering that when he sees somebody slumping up to him, looking miserable in all the possible ways. It’s quite an amusing sight.
“If I’m there I’m not doing all I can to make sure my son stays alive,” Tony returns, going through the diary in a speed tempo but realizing it’s one from when she still worked at Stark Industries. It’s useless, so he throws it on the table and reaches down to get the next one.
This girl can be his friend, just like Wanda – who has proven to be the kindest and most gentle person he knows right now. She does appear a bit sad sometimes. Peter wonders why, but on the other hand he knows it’s not his place to ask. If Wanda wants to tell, she’ll do it when she’s ready.
There’s a hand on his shoulder. When Peter turns around, his eyes meet Yaël’s. It’s weird; where he had known her eyes as almost golden all the time, now they are grey. It’s taken some getting used to in the beginning.
Yaël heard the automatic door behind her open. In a reflex, she stopped aiming one of her two hands from aiming at the scenery in front of her. Instead, she aimed one at whoever was walking in while the other one kept steering fire to the arena. Her heart was beating fast. If someone caught her right now, she’d be in deep trouble. Yet, she wasn’t going to stop with what she was doing; she wasn’t going to leave this hellhole of a planet before she was done.
The hold on Peter’s neck loosens, and suddenly he’s falling – again. But Peter doesn’t scream. All he can do is close his eyes while letting out a long breath.
But it doesn’t, and by the time that he supposes T’Challa is awake, Steve jumps out of bed, gets himself dressed and hurries back into the hallway forgetting all about breakfast. The door that leads to T’Challa’s office is, as usual, guarded. The two women look about ready to kick Steve’s ass if he even tries to do something funny, no matter the serum. He’s come across them a few times, and always decided to just stay clear of them.
Yaël put laundry detergent in the machine and pushed on the start-button. It has been three days since someone knocked on her door and drove her drunk ass to Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters. That someone happened to be Scott, the grandchild the Thompsons had been talking about. And Scott happened to be the one who, together with X, tried to train her, back when she was quite new on earth and still a bit unfamiliar with her powers, so she’d be more able to control them. These three days had been a whole ride through memory lane.
He’s keeping his music up, his head down and his hands busy. There’s no reason for him to stop what he’s doing, not even to listen to his father talking to Steve – the man who may or may not have some sort of
“Well, she surely didn’t have an appointment,” Stark answered dryly. For some reason, the secretary didn’t answer to that anymore.
fault, it’s mine entirely. And I could say yes when you propose in, say, a year? But if we would go for it, I would constantly be waiting for you to decide you have enough of me. And it’s not fair on you.”
The blonde man was a calm reader. His voice sounded soothing… too soothing. Yaël felt herself slip away. Which feels weird in a dream. She fought it, but closed her eyes after a while. Yaël opened her eyes again immediately and stared to a yellowed ceiling with cracks in it. One second later, the alarm of her cellphone went off: time to get up.
of money. The planes at the airport in Leipzig were also horribly expensive. Tony felt that, the bits that he paid for, too. The damage was partly his fault.
“Right…” Fury mumbles. Tony blows out another breath, regretting it immediately when it hits him in the face almost instantly. “I’ll, uh… I’ll just meet the Captain on the deck upstairs, then.”
“That’s great news, Steve!” she cackled into his ear. Without thinking about it, Steve pulled up her legs and held them so his throat got more space to make sure she wasn’t strangling him anymore.
He doesn’t say anything. Instead, he gets back to his seat, shuffles it closer to Tony’s upper body, and then he rests his head on Tony’s shoulder. If there are tears in his eyes, they don’t need to know.
“What are you doing?!” the scientist asks, sounding angry all of the sudden. Peter, who is looking at the cables connected to the device, is too close to the thing for Tony’s taste. He’d rather have him far away from it.
Mr. Stark’s eyes widen in surprise, and then he starts laughing, eyes crinkling at the corners. His hand goes upon the chest of his suit.
The video takes a turn when suddenly somebody in the crowd shouts ‘JUST KISS ALREADY’, and the two suddenly fly towards each other, lips smashing in a strong, demanding kiss. Peter immediately turns off the screen and puts the device aside, trying not to think back too much about what happened there.
“Did I hurt you?” he asks, already pulling away from him. Tony shakes his head and grabs him behind the neck to smash their lips together again. A confused sound escapes Steve’s mouth.
If Tony wants to keep on pushing everybody away, then Peter won’t try to fight it anymore. If the guy’s happier that way, it’s none of Peter’s fucking business.
“In case you’ve forgotten, you’re still under watch. I don’t want to be the first son that has to remind his own father that he’s supposed to be nice to the babysitter.”
“When did you even get the idea to do this?” he asks. The mischievous smirk on Peter’s face is enough to make Tony realize he probably pulled out the big guns.
“It don’t have to look good to taste good,” she says, pointing the fry at him before putting it in her mouth. Then, while she’s still chewing, she turns towards Peter in that usual inspecting glare of hers. “Now you’ve been missing from work lately, which strikes me as strange since you’ve got a lot to catch up on here. What, you’ve given up your year?”
“With you, being my legal dad?” Peter clarifies. Indeed, he’s been over this with Aunt May and Yaël. It was the latter who came up with the initial idea, but Peter wanted to go over this with his Aunt before he would even bring it up to Tony. Knowing that this is a pretty big deal, the conversation had been a long one; but this is something that
He never found him in the end. Peter did have that date at Gwen’s, had an embarrassing discussion with Gwen’s dad, and eventually revealed to her who he really was. That evening, it was safe to say that Gwen was officially his girlfriend. It was November.
Still, with every fiber of his shrapnel-rent heart, he would have rather been happy than right. But that had never been a choice his life had left him. That was fine; he understood it like a mathematical constant. He'd just wanted to make
He rasped out an equally saw-toothed groan, letting his dick bob free between his shirt tails, taking both layers of pants in both hands, and shoving them down his legs, belatedly heeling off his shoes, and kicking everything off in a pile.
Astute enough to know when to defer to the wishes of his customer, the craftsman nodded. "Fortunately, I do have several large, completed pieces unspoken for, from which the two of you can make a selection, should they meet with your approval. Please, follow me."
!" Heat and lightning were crashing through his veins, driving him up toward a towering height. His dick throbbed and his whole body stretched and strained, and he was dangling over an abyss, held back by a thread he was so, so desperate to break.
As Steve ventured inside, the tread of his footsteps breaking into the rhythm of Tony's seemed to register, prompting Tony to look up.
The one thing he missed, among cremes and conditioners, exfoliants, rinses and scrubs, was the simplicity of a bar of soap. Call him old-fashioned (after all, he was), but don't say he hadn't been willing to try. Tony always made him feel adventurous.
"Whatever, Stark, just don't make me deal it out, and you'll never have to know. Now shut up and open wide, commercial's over."
That had been intimidating at first, but Steve had shared enough time and company with him now to catch sight of some of his more intricate inner workings. Beyond his brilliance as an innovator, Tony was a caring soul; he loved to help people, and he had a deep-down eagerness to earn approval.
Bracing her free hand on the edge of her seat, she leaned toward him, bringing their faces very close. He could appreciate the expensive subtleties of her scents -- a floral note, something enticingly tangy, and a touch of mint on her softly fanning breath. Oh, they were co-conspirators, now, sharing secrets.
“Fuck, it’s good, so good,” she rasped. “You close? You gotta be, so huge all the way up in me, feels like you keep getting bigger and harder like one of those pump-up fuck toys.”
“Making up for past mistakes -- I really admire that in a person. You’re doing a good thing, here, Ms. DeWard. Funding the hospital renovations will touch so many people’s lives, all because you care enough to help bring it about.”
Tony drew in a quick breath, and threw up his hands. "Ok, I read you, Cap. Orders received. Mission abort."
The second was a more irregular pattern of bright primary and secondary-colored bars and stripes, overlapping and crossing at many angles on a background of midnight blue. To Steve, even with the abstract composition, it conveyed all the dimensionality of classical chiaroscuro in textile form. Tony said it reminded him of the combined colors of all the Avengers in battle, running, leaping, and soaring, and that settled it.
Her smile turned brittle and her eyes went remote. Looked like the gamble hadn’t paid off. He scrambled for one more last-ditch effort. “...and I know you aren’t proud of who you were in those days, but you followed your dreams, and you’ve grown up to become a strong, compassionate woman, putting your effort and resources into helping others.”
"No, that's right. I aim, every time. One throw to hit one target is way better than ten throws to hit nothing. Make sense?"
Inside the room, it was a much-moderated version of the main level, still glassy and modern, but leaning toward eggshell-whites and warmer lighting. Afternoon sun shone in narrow stripes around the edges of honeycomb-shaded windows that made up most of one wall, and slatted wood substituted for the metal-framed furnishings. To their right, a futon-style couch and several similar chairs, along with a giant, cushioned papasan, were arranged in a grouping with two glass-topped coffee tables. A coordinating dinette, set for two, was tucked into the back corner. To their left along the wall was a small bar that appeared to be stocked only with basic supplies.
This chapter isn't a full stand-alone alternate version of the story, but picks up and diverges at a pretty obvious point. I didn't add an ending, but just assume it's headed in the same general direction as how things go post-dialogue in Chapter 1.
And after he'd said his piece and they'd made theirs, Tony had told him the meaning hidden in "we need to talk," and how he'd crumpled at the "please" no matter what, and how Steve had him for the taking, but he'd thought sure he was leaving, and weren't they a couple of fools, he’d said with a painful laugh, both afraid what the other had wanted was less a commitment, and thank God for one of them having the balls to communicate.
He let her self-indulgent byplay slide right on past, ready to shake her hand, see her on her way, and ideally, have a precious minute or two to regroup before he had to make much more genteel conversation with a respectable lady.
Tony did call him many things, with a sparkle, smirk, wink, or a sigh, but was always willing to indulge, and in so many words to equal the one, it all added up to love.
Steve ran a hand down Tony's back, rubbing idly at his shoulder blade and the dip of his spine, happy to collect a soft, contented hum. He sank into the idle strokes of Tony's fingers. He watched Tony's head rise and fall on his chest.
After a short pause, breathing heavily, his eyes closed and lower lip bitten in his teeth, the man pulled out, shiny with the traces, and took a step back. He dried himself off with a corner of his garment and hitched it back into place around his hips. "Thank you," he told Tony. "Your boy's got a great mouth."
Of course, Tony's speedy sports car had never been intended to accommodate transport of an enormous rolled carpet, so they hightailed it home and met the shop's delivery truck upon its arrival a few minutes later. The driver offered his services along with those of his helper to do the unloading, but Tony waved them off, leaving them with what Steve was sure was an outrageously overblown tip.
Tony probably had a million things to do as it was, and he'd spent the whole afternoon with Steve, and it had been so nice and companionable, and now Steve was ruining it with his unwarranted stroke of melancholy.
He made himself stand and appreciate the view till she was across the big area rug in a spread-legged stance behind the tall papasan chair, wrapping her hands over the arching top of its frame and bending at the waist with her head between her arms, a sinful dip to her back, and her ass cocked to the sky. The drape of her skirt hinted at outlines, long thighs with plenty of space left between, and the ripe curves she’d dressed down, now all played up.
"Not bad, huh, big guy?" Tony asked, the unstated "I told you so" conspiratorial rather than cutting.
As soon as they exited the chamber, the aliens were waiting for them with obsequious bows and caftan-like replacement garments. It seemed the ship had been en route back to earth during the... proceedings, and by twenty minutes later, they were returned to the landing pad atop the Tower and permitted to depart without further ado. Guess they'd had their whatever-they-needed all nice and blessed, and didn't have to spare another thought for the multitudes they'd held hostage to the outcome.
She twisted over her shoulder, her face gleaming in triumph at the discovery of her gambit, the sleek hollows at the sides of her hips flexing as she shook her rampant bare ass in a brassy burlesque.
Looking scandalized, Clint jumped to his feet. "No! Of course not! It's a game -- apparently you wouldn't believe how popular the 'aliens made us do it' scene is, even if we all know it's blatantly speciesist--"
He'd swanned in just as Steve's favorite program was starting, martini in hand, swigged down the last of the drink and set the glass aside. Given a shimmy of his shoulders that swished his lavender silk robe provocatively to the floor, leaving him even more provocatively bare to the waist. Unceremoniously whipped Steve's belt off and his pants down just before Steve had himself planted in his spot on the couch. Then without a word, dropped to his knees, snuffled into Steve's groin, inhaled his dick, and... done absolutely nothing else.
Tony bore down on his cockhead with one more long, relentless suck, and with so many hypersensitized spots taking the hit at once, Steve was gone, riding an electrified rail that blinded him with arcs of obliviating current, ramping up and up into overload. His body seized, and he burst wide open with a howl, shooting off in pulsing streams, his ears crackling with white noise and Tony's labored, wordless exhortations, rocking frantically into Tony's hands and mouth and petting haphazardly at his head and shoulders as his muscles unlocked.
When they broke off, Tony left a soft, scratchy nibble at the corner of Steve’s mouth, smiling all the way to his eyes, and then tucking back under Steve's chin like he was planning to stay a while. Steve considered. Temperature wasn’t too hot or cold, he didn't have to piss, and he could get by for a while before his stomach would be shrieking at him to shovel down some calories. Yeah, he could stay right here. Tony would probably doze. Steve probably wouldn't, but it just meant he wouldn't miss anything.
"No apology needed, Captain Rogers," the AI reassured. "Your attention is appropriately directed elsewhere."
"Turn," Tony commanded, and Steve shuffled around on his knees till he faced outward, rather than inward, between Tony's thighs. "Good. Now, mouth open. Wide." He had no need of seeing Steve's face to be certain he'd complied.
Changing over to a shorter, sharper rhythm, he ran both arms further up her front and took double handfuls of her chest, unconcerned if he mauled the top half of her dress into the same condition as the bottom. He felt the satin snag as he sank his fingertips into the thick flesh surrounding her nipples, squeezing and kneading, and massaged their peaky points in circles and rolling pinches. She pushed into his hands, and he was spurred by the faster kick of her hips.
"Let me?" Steve asked quietly, and Tony deferred. This was Steve's show, after all; no reason to have called him down here if he wasn't going to let him speak his piece.
“Don’t sell yourself short. Do me right, and we could be talking seven, if you’d get out that fat cock and earn that fat check.”
Tony's eyes narrowed, apprising. Good. Steve couldn't stomach that kicked-puppy cower. Even -- especially -- when it was his own steel-toed boot that blundered into Tony's emotional underbelly. Tony was meant to be full of bite and bark and bravado, sly lip curled back to show teeth, and quick with a pointed snarl and snap.
Stepping inside the closer quarters of the hallway was like descending from mountaintop rarefied air to the rowdiness and bustle of the city. All the sensory input was intensified and weighted, the air thick with clatter, heat, smells that clotted into taste, and noisy reverberations vibrating through the walls and floor
Steve's eyes flicked between Tony and the melodrama on the tv screen. He felt a little guilty; Tony had told him to watch his show. But if this was supposed to be for his benefit, for his
Filthy and aching, stilted as ancient, aged men, they lurched into the Olympic-sized shower to wash away what would have been their life together.
Once all the way inside, Tony directed them through the lowering of the massive roll to the floor. His face was flushed a light pink, but even though he shook out his arms and swiped a hand across his forehead, blowing out a sharp "whew,” he didn't seem winded. He produced a small folding knife from his pocket, and neatly sliced through the binding cords, letting the end of the roll unflap, and then leaning down toward one side of the remaining mass. Steve quickly picked up on the cue and took his place again at the other end, and they rolled it all the way out till it lay flat, pulling and dragging a little more to center it across the expanse of the floor, where it covered all but a tidy border of a foot or so on every side.
"Just say the word." Tony's dick was dry now, so he went ahead and tucked himself away, nice and neat, neither stroking himself nor feeling the tempting burn of arousal. The event's industry affiliation was merely a convenient entree. This was Steve's scene. He'd find his own gratification... differently. Later.
Time unknown had elapsed; when they’d let go to breathe, Tony’s eyes had been wide, standing water under smudge-stick charcoal lashes, cheeks rouged with a cadmium shine, and his face luminous, stripped of masks. And the crass, flashy man from the tabloids was nowhere in sight, too busy out dazzling some dewy-eyed starlet or diamond-tipped socialite.
an itch that lasted for seven years. All right, that thought was uncharitable, but she was continuing to rub him the wrong way. “Begging your pardon, ma’am, but my marriage is plenty spicy. I enjoy flavor, not getting burned. As I said. Happily.” He spoke with finality.
He hunched in and rode her hard, breathing heavy over the back of her neck, and driving them higher. The new angle set Starla writhing and jolting like she’d been hit with an electrical shock, groaning loud and deep, and bucking back against him erratically in frantic response.
Thumb like a wiper blade, he brushed back and forth, back and forth, across the beating pulse in Tony's wrist.
Overheated, hyperventilating, Steve realized that the growling he heard in his ears was his own. Tony's breath had turned noisy, too, sounding thick and wet, and he was kneading harder at Steve's calf, squeezing and rubbing the muscle in erratic patterns Steve was primed to have happening between his legs, not down along one of them. The weird offset of sensation added another layer of urgency to the atmosphere, already heavy with charge, awaiting some unknown pressure change to trigger a cloudburst.
, kind of like sticking his hand in a bowl of tepid water -- inoffensive but unremarkable, and not particularly arousing...)
When he pulled out, his hand was soaked, and wet sounds came from both ends of her, like ass and mouth were in agreement toward keeping him in, in.
“Even if I were amenable, I’m here to meet someone on business. They’ll be here any minute, and I can’t be found, ah, flirting.” He struggled to remain tactful while holding a steely edge that should dissuade any further overtures.
FRIDAY answers in that usual dry way of hers. Tony doesn’t need to look at the screen to know the pictures are up. He hears it in the way Steve is reaching forward to scroll through them.
“Sorry! I couldn’t hold it back anymore!” Yaël answered over-dramatic. She forgot Peter for a second, who tried to get her attention, but she didn’t notice. “And the Winchesters are in trouble again…”
Oh, no. It’s just Clint and Sam, both of them looking even ten times more horrible than Steve does. Clint is scratching his hair in confusion while Sam plants his shoulder against the wall and drags it from there.
Steve startles, eyes blinking as he focuses on the figure in front of him. Beautiful as ever, Tony is next to him, brown eyes looking at him in worry. When he sees Steve smile, though, that worry quickly disappears again.
“Th-th- this is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen!” Peter can’t contain his enthusiasm. He’s literally ecstatic all of the sudden, a bit euphoric at the idea that the suit is supposed to be
Peter turns around, noticing Mantis looking at him worriedly. Her big eyes are opened so large they almost appear bigger than her entire face. But she’s looking down, at Peter’s hands, who are apparently about to break the desk underneath his fingers.
After Happy drops him off, the chauffeur opens the door for Peter and starts walking away again without saying anything to him. Peter just shakes his head before grabbing his bag and throwing it over his shoulder. It rained a bit earlier, so the grass is still wet.
He nods towards the crash site, his curiosity getting the better of him. MJ frowns for a moment, but then she nods as well, obviously just as curious.
Peter rolls his eyes again, landing on another roof and reaching out his hand when she’s almost in his grasp. Then she rolls over on the ground, jumping up into the air and using those wires of hers to get to the next building. Peter lets out a huff and starts running again.
we’ve been pranked, right?” Sam asks. Natasha finally bursts out laughing, putting her hand on her stomach while tears form in her eyes. The three men give her a glare, and as if on cue Steve and Tony walk back into the room.
“Yeah, and Pepper’s also pretty upset. She would have been here, but she’s dealing with some reporters outside. A few people saw you when they were transporting you out, I’m afraid.”
“Give it to me,” she said, while signing with her hand after he told her he saved the fragment on his phone, but hadn’t dared to watch it yet. She sat down onto the bed, next to him and held the phone in front of them so Peter could see the screen too. “Then we’ll do it together; I don’t remember much of it, either,”
“Crazy is relative,” she says calmly, kneeling back down until she’s seated almost like a cat keeping watch. When she turns her head to the side, there’s still a grin on her lips. “So, what’s your name?”
“You were completely gone from the world,” Tony tells him without looking up, tapping on his screen in quick movements. Peter takes a quick look around before turning back to Tony.
Steve chuckles nervously. “Yeah, I guess he did,” he mutters out. Tony snickers behind the suit, letting out a little gasp of surprise when Steve yanks at his arm to make him stop.
By the time he gets halfway through the fourth, though, something quite… strange happens. Peter shakes his head for a moment and rereads the page again, but then he finds that he’s read it correctly. His parents are together for about two years now, making it one more year before they get married. That little fact right there, though, is what’s making this next part so difficult to read, though.
“The oxygen helps with the amount of air he takes, but not with the breathing itself,” she explains. “Just sit up for a bit and try to calm down, alright?”
“In the bedroom,” Steve shouts back. Tony stands up from the couch and stretches a bit. Then he walks towards the coffee machine, prepares two cups for the both of them, and then makes his way to the bedroom. There, he can see Steve with damp hair, seated on the side of the bed, dressed in a sleeping-shirt and his boxer shorts. Tony doesn’t say anything. Instead, he hands him his cup, and sits down next to him. Silently, he grabs his hand lifting it up towards his lips to give his fingers a soft kiss.
“You don’t need to justify yourself to me, Loki,” Yaël answered. But he kept staring outside, something was on his mind, but he had never been a big talker.
“Then I need you to realize, Tony, that if he can’t take much more, you shouldn’t put him into that position,” Steve suddenly says sternly. “He held up pretty good, last night, but even I could see that he wasn’t handling it very well internally.”
“Ehm, I can’t drive… But if you give me an address, I’m willing to search for something, somehow. I’ll figure it out.”
“It’s still the cave,” memory-Lopt answered as he walked in, completely soaked, carrying a big pile of branches.
“The kid’s lost so much,” Tony explains. “His parents, his uncle, his first girlfriend even died because of the Goblin – yeah, that’s the casualty we were told about. A freakin’ sixteen-year-old girl.”
Peter blinks, his head aching from all the confusion. “Because I saw him die? He got shot by a thief I didn’t stop out of pettiness. He died because of me…”
There’s no more smoke, just ashes on the ground. Now that the sun is shining, it’s even more clear how the once white walls are now blackened.
Only too bad because the glass is all fogged up and nobody’s able to see what’s going on behind the stall. Natasha remembers, when they’d been filming this, that the two had been wearing their swimming trunks.
Steve nods in agreement. “I think Pepper’s your best shot, indeed. I mean, she knows him through and through, being his assistant for years.” Peter smiles happily, about to say something when the door suddenly opens up again.
“It won’t end there,” Thor answered. “The longer Hela’s on Asgard, the more powerful she grows. She’ll hunt us down. We need to stop her here and now.”
“I did what I had to do,” she says, no regret in her voice. “We went this the wrong way. There are other ways we can fix this. ”
She felt a bit frustrated after that phone call. Somehow, she had hoped X had answers for her, but he had none. Maybe she should call Fury? Last time, he let his assistant pick up in his place. But there was no harm in trying, right?
Tony grins once again, because that meant that it worked. He did it. He heads to the compound first thing, landing at the frond door. Some people walking outside startle at his sudden appearance. Tony ignores him as he removes the suit and starts running inside.
He presses down the button without any further hesitation. And it’s just in a flash that it starts raining. It’s completely dark outside now, drops falling down on him. There are a few cars driving behind him, and a couple of people walking on the sidewalk. When they see him, they don’t spare him a second glance. That’s probably the first time somebody hasn’t recognized him while he’s lacking any disguise.
“You’ve never even seen me,” Peter counters. A bit out of his comfort zone, he gets back onto his feet and wipes off the invisible dust off his suit. Then he clears his throat, looking back down at her. Don’t look at her breasts, don’t look at her breasts.
Steve and Tony jump apart, the latter dropping down on the ground until he’s hidden behind the bed. Steve grabs the sheets, putting it around him in an attempt to hide himself away.
“Tony, are you in there?” she asks. Tony, who realizes he’s standing in the bathroom staring at his own face, shakes himself awake a bit and turns back around.”
“I’m glad the family reunion is so great, but there’s about ten people too many in this room,” the voice of Dr. Strange says. Peter sits up some more, trying to get a look at the former surgeon who walks inside. Peter remembers Strange saying that he would be present during the surgery but wouldn’t be the one performing it due to his lack of control in his fingers. That had been fine by Peter, since he wouldn’t really want somebody with shaky hands inside his brain.
“You can help by getting your ass back home, young man!” Tony shouts at him before realizing it. Peter throws his hands up in the air.
Hope you liked the chapter, let me know what you thought of it and feel free to point out any mistakes ^^
Ned stays quiet for a bit. Peter is just about ready putting some scrapes of the suit into a few test tubes. Then he turns to the mask, turning it inside out and checking for any trace of technology in there. Much like he suspected, there’s nothing inside.
she would answer to him. She would reach out her hand to take his in hers, but as he imagines that, he doesn’t feel the touch on his skin.
It’s not the only occasion this happens. There are moment with Tony where Pepper’s just about ready to smash her face against the wall. When they’re lying in bed, Pepper about ready to have some fun but only to find out Tony needs to finish some more projects for the Avengers, or more specifically; Steve.
Peter runs and runs, forgetting that he can swing. He goes so fast that he doesn’t even have time to avoid Eddie Brock on the path.
He goes to the teacher, offers his apology. She only remarks that he’s still a bit pale, and that he should maybe go and see the nurse. Peter assures her that he’s doing better
“Yup, got it in one,” Tony says laughingly. “I’m thinking about making you one as well, but knowing your luck I’m also afraid you might accidentally shoot yourself with it.”
But he won’t hold it past her if she would figure it out. She’s a super-spy after all. And even as she stands in the doorway, holding a tablet in her hands, already fully dressed in her uniform, she takes a good look at both Steve and Tony with a frown. Then as she tries to speak, Tony interrupts her.
“Mr. Stark, I don’t think you’re seeing the big picture here,” the man with the glasses says. Or, uh, the brown glasses, since a lot of people are wearing glasses here, excluding him and Pepper. They’re both in too good health to be wearing those. “For over the past year, there have only been three new innovative creations brought into the market which are-“
Steve pulls his hand back, eyes sad again, mouth pulled into a thin line. Tony closes his eyes. Another headache comes up. He rubs his forehead, trying to dull the pain a bit.
But Steve just chuckles as he pours the coffee into Tony's mug. "You can't pull what you don't have."
?” Yaël asked in disbelief. Brunhilde nodded to her to confirm the fact that Thor did name their group the Revengers, though looking like she thought the name was pretty clever. Oh, she had no idea…
“Let me guess, it made you horny as fuck?” Yaël blurted out, getting back to the conversation. Of course Prude Parker started blushing again as he threw himself on his back and put his hands in front of his eyes, making the bed shake with his movement. So… Okay, maybe she should clear her emotions out too. “Don’t worry, I don’t have a secret crush on you, Peter. My libido’s just… extremely high, I suppose.” Well, especially when she was intoxicated.
“I’m sorry, I got carried away. You probably don’t want me to go over all of this, do you?” she asks. Peter takes another breath and then shakes his head.
“Oh Bruciebear, how I could have used your wisdom right now,” Tony mutters while leaning forward to have a look at a microscope, but unable to place whatever he’s seeing in front of him. That’s probably too old to look like how it’s supposed to look like.
“Peter,” Tony greets him simply without looking up. It makes the boy frown in confusion. He heads towards the coffee machine to clean up the pads before putting a mug with milk into the microwave.
“H-how can I help you?” he blinked a few times and did his very best not to stare at her cleavage. Yaël felt incredibly guilty and really wanted to pull the thing up again, but she smiled instead.
“Peter. He became seventeen last month,” he says proudly. Then he goes through his pocket and picks up a photograph. Tony knows which one it is; Peter is at the table in front of a large birthday cake. Steve and Tony are on Peter’s right, and May on his left. They’re all laughing, while the other Avengers are celebrating along.
“Okay, so I’m going to lower you down through this window, alright?” Peter asks. The younger kid shakes his head and grabs for his arm, in search of reassurance. The older brother nods.
Bruce asks, a bit shocked. He doesn’t even greet her, which means that he was probably just about to call somebody up himself.
“You can join us, I don’t mind,” Peter says with a shrug, because it’s true. He doesn’t mind at all. “B-but please, don’t try to pretend like there’s nothing going on, because it’s driving me crazy. I’m not going to cry if you two want to smooch it up a little bit.”
And he’d seen the pain in Stark’s eyes, and the way his breath caught when Peter confessed that she’d died years ago. That expression was not one of a stranger learning somebody he once knew passed away. This look was one of complete distress and agony. This was the face of someone learning that somebody he
He tinkers a bit with some devices he brought along to pass his time. He has a phone call with May, tries to contact Peter but fails to catch him. It’s school, he tells himself. Peter won’t pick up. There’s an update from Vision, who says he’s going through all the past sightings of the weapons. It’s a shame they don’t have any facial visuals on the Vulture.
“Good,” Steve says then. He quickly carries the bowls of popcorn back to the kitchen, followed by Tony who takes along the empty glasses.
,” Tony says, finally raising the helmet and revealing an empty Iron Man suit. Peter then rolls his eyes and sighs as he leans back. “
. He tells everything while keeping the Spider-Man stuff out of it, explaining how he got into the Stark Internship, how at first the plan seemed to fail but eventually succeeded when Mr. Stark invited him to work at the Compound instead. And as Ned listen, Peter feels another weight escape his shoulders. Just like when he did his story with his Aunt.
He notices Fury almost immediately. After a while, it’s become some sort of hidden talent of his; to know whenever the guy is suddenly going to appear.
“But fine, I get it. I’ll stay away, since clearly all you want to do is take all of this on yourself. After all, who am I to make decisions about Peter, right?”
“Nice of you to join us, Mr. Stark. We were just about to call for you,” he says, greeting Tony, who gets himself out of his suit again.
Entering the penthouse, it doesn’t feel like almost two weeks have gone by. Steve is lounging on the couch with his sketchbook on his lap. Next to him, there’s Tony who has his face planted behind his tablet. Peter drops his bag and puts his keys in their designated spot.
Peter shrugs at that. "We've never really tested it out, but I think I might be stronger than him. And a lot stronger than Tony, even though he has a bit of serum in him as well.” Peter winks. Tony grunts.
There’s even more silence from him. He doesn’t want to lie to her, but he can’t tell her the truth. Staying quiet is the best option here.
“Uh, I don’t know, I was thinking you two might want to be alone, but there’s still the watch-duty going on,” Steve explains carefully. Peter nods then, crossing his arms while he leans against the wall. The lights are already dimmed a bit. Steve is just busy grabbing his drawing-materials, so it seems.
“SHHH! Don’t make me kick your ass!” the girl warns him, pointing up a finger towards him. Then she lowers herself through the window, using her metal cord to get to the floor without any trouble. Peter jumps through the portal as well, then, landing with a soft thud and immediately looking around to see where the girl went to.
Trying to talk about his problems without telling Aunt May about being Spider-Man is pretty hard. He wishes he could have told her the entire story so that he could get
Shit, this wasn’t a good idea! Yaël needed to get that card as quick as possible and leave this dude alone. Not that Jason was going to manipulate her into taking over the world, but God knows what he had up his sleeve.
"What, no words for the poor, downtrodden masses, my city full of hapless pawns? So selfish. I'm impressed." Tony bared his teeth in a wide, sparkling leer.
He surged up, tugging down her bedraggled skirt and taking her by the waist. “Turn around,” he directed, hardly giving her time to comply before he half-manhandled her into facing him. Her lashes were clumped, her lipstick chewed, and her lips dented with the marks of her bite.
He backed off, dragged in air, nuzzled soft-lipped at the head and tongued at the slit while he was there, opened up and engulfed him deep again. Tony’s thighs were trembling under his grip, and Steve’s head rose and fell to follow the undulations as he writhed.
Hell, he guessed now he knew what had taken her so long in the bathroom, and it wasn’t just “girl things.” He’d been right there in the hallway, while she’d been standing in one of the stalls with slicked up fingers up her hole, working the lube in and probably stretching herself… it was an almost unbearable turn-on. His dick twitched and beaded up another drop of pre-come, drooling just like he was.
Steve had learned many modern idioms in his few years out of the ice. It had evolved into entertainment, in addition to ongoing mental exercise.
Naked, Steve half-raised a hand, then let it drop. Good, Tony thought, he understood. Comfort was beyond their reach.
“Club soda with cranberry,” he answered, half on autopilot with the sudden switch of gears. “But I-- wait--”
The Endo-sym rippled with Tony's shoulders again. "Life presents limitless possibilities. Pays to keep your options open. You're the tactician."
Steve knew Tony's body, of course he did; in detail, with the emphasis on "intimate." But then again, when they were naked together -- maybe it should have been embarrassing, how often their sex was too primal and urgent to bother with undressing fully, but he couldn't bring himself to feel any shame -- but even when every stitch was stripped off, they didn't spend a lot of time stopping to look. Not with their eyes, so much, unless you wanted to count "seeing" with their hands, lips, tongues, learning shapes like blind men. And so, that was his excuse for how easy it could be to forget how fit Tony was, damned disease notwithstanding; how broad, and how tight and trim, in all the rightful places. Lean and efficient, understated and often underestimated, especially outlined against Steve's emphatic bulk.
He was buzzing again, but this time in the best way, a smooth, purring thrum he didn't want to muffle at all, maybe even rev up a little.
Tony frowned, swiveling his chair back and forth a few degrees in each direction while listening to JARVIS report.
Steve retrieved the shield, leaving the bots free to mill around excitedly, and Tony free to cuddle shamelessly against his boyfriend. All had worked out well. Asking for Steve's help had been the best idea. And adding his own contribution to his partner's perspective? That was how you got co-parenting, Tony thought. Did he want co-parenting? If it was him and Steve? Yeah, he thought he just might.
Everything was damp, their hair and clothing hanging heavy and trickling with sweat. The thin white of his shirt had gone onion-skin transparent across parts of his chest and shoulders, her dress darkening in patches where he gripped her flank and splayed a hand over her stomach.
"Yeah, DUM-E, you don't need an extra arm. Extra arms are how we get supervillains." Tony was pretty sure he'd heard that somewhere before, not quite sure where, but it sounded about right.
At breakfast, Steve's teammates had been discussing their assorted plans to get out and enjoy what was shaping up to be a  lovely spring day. With thanks, he'd declined a couple of invitations to join in, having some paperwork he wanted to catch up on. Now, having completed his self-assigned quota, he’d thought to reward himself by picking out a new book to read.
