Natasha had finally gotten her phone up and now she, Thor and Sam was discussing camera angels.
Hey, hey, hey!
teammate yanno. But his hand sort of slipped halfway through lifting Tony and slid up a tiny bit. And boom, an assgrab. And it wasn't like he could let go because then Tony would fall, so he just stood there, awkwardly, while Tony got the glasses.
Fuck. He had to stop thinking about Steve. That was his mind coming up with different scenarios that obviously hadn't happened. This was what Pepper had talked about when she said he needed to go to therapy because his brain would go mental.
As she took her water bottle, sweat towel and yoga mat. She thought of how the team hadn't had a team night in a while. With Thor being away to Asgard to look after his brother, Tony hiding in his workshop with his next (or 50) newest project, and Bruce who had flown to India for a week doing god knows what. They all needed some downtime, and a fun team bonding night would be perfect for that. Seeing as the city were, at the moment, not being attacked by anything. Why not have one tonight?
When they arrived at the exit of the underground bunker, Clint was pretty fucking done, so no one can really blame him for falling asleep, he was going to travel for about an hour in the suits arms, so why not yanno?
"If you wanted to get your hands on my ass all you had to do was ask" Tony play-flirted, making it very obvious that it was a joke, Clint laughed as he let Tony down and let go of his ass.
"Uuurrghh..." Was all that came out of his mouth before he threw up, just managing to not get it on Clint’s shirt.
!WARNING!

"Hey, are you ok, he didn't get to do anything did he?"  He said whilst slowly moving towards Tony, he seemed shy, almost. Which was a whole other level of ironic.
"Sir, if I may interrupt. Yes it's Friday, and you have not slept in 38 hours if you don't count the 2 hour nap you took this afternoon.
“You can go first, ill just sit here and smile. Yeah, you have to look happy aswell. No not like you want to murder me, yes! Exactly like that.” Tony said, and then added after seeing Clint facial expression.
"He won’t wake up! How did you even escape?! What are we going to do?" He asked, panic clear in his voice. He was already lifting Tony bridalstyle into his arms as if he was made of paper. Which judging by Tonys calorie intake the last couple weeks, wasn't as far from the truth as he would like it.
Steve lets Tony prattle. Steve's surprised he's twenty-five -- he looks a lot younger -- but Tony's age doesn't do anything to diminish his need to be touched as he all but melts against Steve. Steve wasn't made for this. He was elevated as a warrior, a blunt tool. It's the angels' job to comfort and guide, not his, but damn has he been missing out and the
"Am not. You're just a lousy marksman," he grins as the cap bounces on the cast on chibi Clint's face. He can't deny he's relieved he still has his aim.
Instead of spying on the date, he now finds himself in some wannabe doctor Evil's hideout, clashing goons' heads together.
From behind the couch Steve shoots Tony the most lovesick look imaginable, and James understands why. Tony elicits in James the same combination of annoyance and awe Steve does, together with something else James has no intention whatsoever to explore.
“Yeah,” Tony breathes out. “I’m going to get on my knees for you, take you in my mouth, and make you see
“Isn’t a hug a customary goodbye gift on your planet, Man of Iron?” Thor asks, sounding genuinely confused, but if the faceplate could narrow its eyes Iron Man would no doubt be squinting right now.
Uh oh.
It takes him a while to reconcile the image of this broken down being on the floor of Tony’s penthouse with the firm jawed sword wielding warrior but there’s something so visceral about his pain that’s hard for Tony to ignore.
“I was working…” he says sheepishly, even indicating the large canvas with one hand.
"-- skin?"
When he can finally open his eyes, he looks around in the low light at the mussed up, torn sheets, the throbbing of his asshole, the sweet ache of a well fucked body…. Did he really – did that really happen? God, if he weren’t feeling it with every movement he made to climb out of bed, Tony would have assumed that he’d gotten shitfaced last night and had the world’s longest, most involved wet dream.
This is the third time in a row someone has tried to crash a Steve/Tony date, and James is not amused.
The scene erupts in chaos and James briefly slumps down in defeat. On the other roof Steve tears off Tony's pants, not in the romantic way James had envisioned after tonight, but to check for burns, and proceeds to throw his soda over the already sodden genius.
Dum-E waves the ball more insistently in James' face, so he turns his attention back to him (it?).
you.”
Tony is light and love and good, and Steve wants to show just how much he loves him. He picks him up with both hands again- gently, carefully, like the precious cargo that he is- and walks out of the elevator without crashing into anything.
“Buck, this is Dummy, Tony’s first born,” Steve beams at Bucky. “Hey buddy.” He pats Dummy gently on his camera. Behind him, Tony looks at Steve like he just declared world peace while shitting sparkly rainbows, and James files this information away for later. Bots might be of use to the mission.
The quiet voice marks a decrease in light intensity, and James feels himself relax a little. Going by the look between Steve and Tony they noticed too.
After Tony pulled off his dick he couldn’t imagine ever enjoying something more than that. But here he is, with Tony panting against him, his gorgeous face flushed with exertion, his gorgeous cock rubbing against Steve’s.
"What the fuck, Cap. You're plastered," Clint calls out, so to retaliate Steve throws the marker cap back.
"Lover will do," Steve smiles, both cheeky and sincere and Tony melts, draping his arms over Steve's broad shoulders.
- any minute now.
He wants to make Steve feel as good as
Steve and Tony share a Look James recognises, and does not care for.
James chants under his breath, almost crawling through the scope to better see.
and he nods in answer.
Likes: Laughing, Steve looking cross eyed when Tony makes a Firefly reference, Firefly, Tony looking cross eyed when Steve pretends he likes captain Archer best, no more pain in left arm and shoulder, watching Tony tinker, watching Steve watching Tony tinker, Steve's new stealth suit, Iron Man, Dum-E, Dum-E pretending he's dumb to make Tony laugh, Tony laughing, Steve laughing, Steven Grant Rogers, Anthony Edward Stark.
Steve whispers and pulls Tony into a kiss. He pours all of his love and devotion into it, but his cock is filling again, and the kiss turns filthier. He can't process the way Tony is moving on top of him, against him. All he knows is that he needs more skin, and he opens the buttons of Tony's shirt with clumsy fingers.

"Never." For good measure he puts on his
Steve's whole everything sings at Tony's words.

four health and safety protocols.” Tony starts backing away with his hands raised but Steve advances with that unholy grin that shouldn’t be as attractive as it is and pulls Tony close enough to lick some more chocolate from his forehead.
It's not a piece of cake.
It's a lovely day; not too warm, but nice enough to go without a jacket. To add to the like list: watching kids playing football, and the new cotton glove for his left hand Tony gifted him yesterday.
“You don’t have to, it’s my thing. I can do it,” Tony offers, faltering slightly when he catches sight of Steve’s face. “Do you… really want to?”
It's the last straw.
With that, Tony gets up off of Steve’s lap and makes his way to the bar in the back.
“Are you part of Hydra?”
Steve bends forward imperceptibly, Tony opens his lips just a fraction, and then the waiter comes up the stairs, trips over the threshold and throws the exquisite tomato lobster bisque into Tony's lap.
Tony always knew he was going to hell even before he knew hell was real but it seems like a very
, “How about we sit down and have a conversation like civilised men over a glass of wine,” he slides out a decent enough bottle of red from the rack and keeps a firm grip on it, “and you can tell me all about who you are, who you work for, and what you want from me.”
With every touch, every passing second, Steve feels the fog of the mead dissipate from his brain. Everything feels more real, more
and how Bucky - the Winter Soldier - is going cause more destruction and the implication hanging heavy between them that it’s Tony’s fault. Again.
The floors are the same dark oak Tony picked for Steve, but the light blue on the walls has been replaced with white and orange. Steve added a lot more bookcases, which are filled with books and knick knacks Tony recognizes from some of their missions. On the floor near the couch is a large red carpet, and there’s a lounge chair near the window Tony doesn’t recognize. The place feels homely, but not as old fashioned as Tony thought it would be. Though if anyone has the power to surprise Tony it’s Steve. He’s both nothing like Howard made him out to be and much more so, a study in contrasts. Tony doesn’t like to think about if Steve hadn’t taken him up on his offer to come live in the tower. It's weird how attached Tony has become, to his whole team actually. Despite his strict ‘don't get close’ rule, they all wormed their way into Tony's heart and so far he hasn't regretted it yet.
“Good. I’ll authorise the new data backup cycle. And once that is done, call the cleaners and the maintenance contractor.”
He startles when someone touches him, but when he realizes who it is he uses Tony's voice and hand to tether himself to the present.
-----
Steve turns around and squelches his way across the expensive lobby floor to the elevator and mentally counts backwards from 300 hoping his teammates will let him leave with the illusion of his dignity still intact. Only 299 seconds until he can shower, 298, 297. He resolutely ignores Bruce’s snickering behind him, but he can’t pretend he doesn’t hear the expensive Italian loafers that run after him.
"Where is the fiend?" he asks, looming over the boy.
“I can… I can do that. I’m good at checkin’. Call me Captain Check… in’? Captain Check. Call me Captain Check,” he grins, which turns into a giggle.
Tony swallows, glaring up at the asshole. “You don’t get to break into my house, hold a fucking sword to my neck and interrogate me. I don’t even know what you’re talking about and if this is some ploy to kidnap me or whatever then bringing a renaissance weapon instead of a gun is kind of dumb, don’t you think?”
“I’m sure it’ll come to you. Just remember that we need something to show to the board at the end of the month. I know you won’t make a liar out of me,” Obie says, squeezing Tony’s shoulder before he leaves.
"Yeah, we're all crestfallen over that. Thor, you're first against Clint." Nat all but orders the men.
He starts to run, covering his ears with both hands.
say any more.
“But who wins?” Steve asks, taking another sip. The mead might be the best thing he ever drank.
He's aware he's bypassing Tony, undoing whatever it was that caused the young man to lean in and trust him, but this is too sudden. Too monumental.
Moaning, Tony breaks their kiss to glance down at where his hand disappeared into Steve’s jeans. “Fuck, baby, you’re huge. Bigger than anyone I’ve ever been with. I can’t wait to feel all of that in me someday.” He punctuates his statement with a squeeze of Steve’s cock.
annoying. So much so, he all but completely ignores Tony, who reacts to this with the saddest pair of brave, puppy eyes James has ever seen.
A pattern that is by now extremely familiar, even to Tony’s frazzled neurons.
James likes to be first. He has staked out the area, satisfied that there are no bad guys planning nefarious deeds, and whispered a suggestion to the baker to make sure there are enough double chocolate banoffi doughnuts (Steve's favourite) and white chocolate eclairs (Tony's favourite) on hand.

They all turn around to watch a second portal open a few hundred yards away.
his forte.
"J, lower the lights with twenty five percent, and order throw blankets in every colour, and eight different textures."
Maybe someday he’ll push further until he can take all of him in, bury his nose in the well trimmed patch of dark blond pubic hair, but not tonight.
what a gift it is that Tony so casually bestows on him and he lifts his hands to cup Tony's face.
, and Steve dreamed about Tony waking up for almost four days straight now.
Steve barely registers all the small bots dropping dead as he closes the final distance to the big bot and looks up to see the armour almost flutter to the ground, J.A.R.V.I.S. obviously working hard to give his master as soft a landing as possible right in Steve’s arms. The front of the armour is a mess, a huge hole reveals the bloody mess that should be Tony’s stomach and Steve is frozen in fear.
“Bedroom,” Tony pants, tilting his head to the side, exposing his neck, his fingers running through Steve’s hair. “Unless you cammm...can’t make that then I’ll just blow you against the wall of your choice.”
"What's this game you speak of, Clinton?" Thor asks, sitting up straighter.
He stands still for a moment to hide his face in Tony’s neck and snicker against Tony’s skin, but having his eyes closed like that makes the world spin even more, and he pulls back to smile at Tony. When their eyes meet, Steve can’t help but burst out in giggles again.
“Iron Man, stand down!” Steve yells, increasing his speed, when the armour wobbles to its feet and engages again, firing at the huge robot in an erratic pattern.
meets his gaze.
he’s fucking with them again when he notices the slight upturn of Thor’s mouth as he draws the silence out.
Tony leans forward on his toes to check his reflection in the mirrored glass of the workshop doors, but catches himself and waves at JARVIS to open the doors instead. He's not twelve and this is not a date. It's a… house call? Yeah, let's go with house call. It's a friendly house call of one teammate to another; one could make a case it's a business meeting even.
Them being the people they are and this

And now that he can
is worth saving, how dare Tony imply otherwise -- when Tony gives him a morsel of information. Wittingly, or not? It feels like Steve has been drawn into a game of chess where the rules are fluid, and he studies Tony's face for any clues.
“Just throw a blanket over him,” Nat says, “and help me with Clint.”
"What? Did he fall asleep? Is he in the…?"
“I’m okay. Don’t need you stupid magic people coming and fucking up my equilibrium with your stupid soulful eyes and stupid names like Polemistés and Bucky.”
Steve lets the implications hang between them, and observes Tony carefully.
"Not at all," Jarvis replies formally, which Steve reads as
“Thanks, Obie. Don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“Please don’t,” Tony groans softly enough for only Steve to hear as he takes a few long pulls of his beer.
. It's all stainless steel and glass surfaces. It screams loneliness, and Steve thinks he understands a little of the dead look in the boy's, in Tony's, eyes.
They center around an appliance Tony can't remember buying, or creating, which somehow manages to look angry without any facial features.
He almost feels sorry for the goons when he eventually finds their so called leader, shitting his pants inside a file cabinet. You must be pretty desperate to pit yourself with a mangy bastard like this.
Not to mention billionaire, philanthropist geniuses who like
Across from him everyone freezes -- the waiter and Steve at dapping ineffectually at Tony, Tony at ineffectually pushing them away -- to stare at him.
A second pair of hands join Steve's in holding James, some silent conversation going above his head. Tony’s hand -- it can’t be anyone else but Tony -- stroking James soothingly along his back.
-----
Doombots. Why is it always aliens or Doombots? It’s like Steve and his team are starring in a poorly written action series. (Steve might’ve developed an addiction to these in the last months, with Batman as his favourite one so far.) They're small ones this time, resembling cockroaches of a foot long that skitter up all available surfaces.
The pieces really are pretty small for Steve's hands as well though. "I would've liked this game back when I was sick a lot," he muses, and sips on his drink as he thinks about those long, boring days where he was stuck in bed.
He looks up to Tony squinting at him, so he smiles back extra friendly, but he can't help turning it into a grin when Tony shakes his head and puts down
Tony wakes up to light filtering in through the blinds and grumbles at JARVIS to shut off the sun. It takes a moment for him to register the lack of a pithy comeback as well as the continued presence of the searing sunlight and he sits up unable to stop his wince when the jarring movement causes him to feel a dull pulsating pain in his ass, and a sharp dizziness in his head.
Steve's never sure if Thor is trying to impress them or not, but this sounds like fun. "We could do that now!" he says brightly, looking at Tony for permission.
Not that he cares, he’s Tony fucking Stark. So what if he has to recalibrate his entire existence and ideology to include
"I'm glad you care about the furniture," Bruce chuckles and gets up to brew himself a fresh tea.
There’s a look on his face that is reminiscent of him holding his sword to Tony’s neck, full of what he’s presuming is heavenly wrath and yada yada yada. It’s something primal, something that causes Tony’s stomach to swoop. The last time a supernatural being looked at him like that, Tony got fucked six ways to sunday. He doesn’t think this one is going to go the same way, though. Could be the holier-than-thou attitude.
James blinks at Tony. Tony looks back at James. Steve coughs.
Up close, watching Steve and Tony make happy moon eyes at each other certainly feels like daggers to his intestines, but it's better than
Tony pulls away with a grimace as the now sticky and itchy splooge all over them makes itself known. “I need to- We need to clean up. I can’t- I have a thing about textures and touch, I can’t relax like this.” He says, apologetically.

It does wonders to clear his head though.

Steve barks a laugh and nods. "Way sooner than that. You're gonna wish I’d wear some regular clothes once in a while. People will confuse me with Wonder Woman,” he grins. Tony’s answering giggle is the best sound Steve has ever heard, and it makes him warm and glowy inside.
He's dropped to the ground and though the smoke that still lingers hurts his chest and eyes, he runs as fast as his short legs can carry him. He weaves his way through the crowd just in time to see Bucky step into a huge black carriage.
Tony slides off the side of the bed, stumbling only slightly, and helps Steve kick off his soiled clothes.

Steve has to mentally count to ten to prevent himself from shaking some sense into the kid, and glares at him instead. He doesn't understand what's so difficult about the concept of endless torture that is so hard to grasp.
He has been trapped and bound for so long -- his mind pillaged and raped until nothing was left but a shadow following orders -- that being untied is daunting. He needs direction, or else he'll be lost and floating.
. What even.
Last chapter update of the year! 🎉
They cross the threshold of the bedroom as Tony pulls Steve into another kiss, addicted to the act. He runs his hand down Steve’s abs fumbling with the button on his jeans to undo it single handedly.
Tony blinks in disbelief at Steve’s words. “That long ago? You wanted me since
“It’s quite rude of you to not even tell me your name before requesting my help. If you wanted a meeting, you should’ve just called my secretary. There was no need for theatrics, handsome.”
No, he shook his head, no. That bastard abused him and it is not ok or alright to do that to somebody. He repeated this silently in his head while still grinding on somebody, at this point he didn't care what their monthly income was, and he certainly didn't care about gender.
So when Tony went up for air after a 32 hour binge in the workshop, Clint jumped him as fast as possible, reminding him of the date and what it meant. Tony had of course no clue what day it was (He thought it was Thursday), but happily obliged once enlightened with the day. It was still only 10 o clock in the morning so Tony had a chance to shower, eat and sleep before the time rolled around. Steve would not let Tony drink any coffee unless he was going to a meeting off somewhere important, or if he had slept at least 6 hours.
"I’m just gonna drag you out into the hallway and the we could try to get you to stand ok?" Clint said, whilst slowly standing up on his feet and bending down to take Tony under his shoulders, slowly dragging him towards the now exploded door.
.” Tony said while watching Natasha take out her brand new Stark-phone (disguised as a blueberry, of course).
"Because I'll make sur.. oh hiii." He cut himself off.
"I’m guessing you either want money, my genius or just to torture us. I would like to also point out that my company have a strict no-ransom policy, so if you're gonna torture one of us, it’s gotta be me." He went on, Clint sitting in corner, his eyes widening when he understood the meaning behind it and wanted to say something, but decided against it.
Tony pulls his butt as far away from Ty's groin, and then smashes it back with as much power as possible, making Ty loose his hold on Tony for a bit and Tony seeing an opening to escape. He yanks his arms free of Ty and then storms towards the exit, the only one he gets to is an emergency exit, but it'll have to do for now, all he want is to get away from Tiberius.
The writer for the newspaper had also heard of the kidnapping.
After their dinner was eaten and nobody had died of chocking, embarrassment or just plain fighting, the team (everybody except Tony, Steve and Bruce) decided that a game of truth or dare would be an great idea. And that found the whole team sitting in the living room of the communal floor, with snacks and drinks to freely take from, about to start acting like a bunch of teenagers. And thinking of the IQ compared to humor level of some of the members, it wasn't that hard to say that the average mental age of the room was about 16.
He finally started to strech out and when his arm hit something warm and fuzzy he may or may not have let out a very manly scream. And if that didn’t wake up whatever it was then the flailing arm that hit it’s head certainly did.
This really wasn't Clint fault, no, really, it wasn't. If it wasn’t for the press conference being so boring then Clint would've had listened and all of this wouldn’t have happened.
Tony made a fast jerk to try and get out, succeeding for a second until Ty's arms once again tightened, and he is now trapped way tighter than before. With Ty being 21, and Tony only being 19. It's pretty easy for him to hold Tony back.
"Oh I am so in on whatever this plan is."
Tony felt as if he ever said chick out loud in her presence she would chop his dick off, and he decided that the risk was too big to test that theory out. Steve and Tony went up the stairs, mostly because there wasn't an elevator there.
"Barton, you fucker, help me get the glasses down or so help me god I will punch you square in the face."
Of course she remembers the joke, but it was just a joke. Well it didn't matter now because the internet obviously hadn't forgotten about it, and  it was blackmail material for both Clint and Tony, and she didn’t back down to that.
A bus full of school kids from the Midtown school of science had almost been melted and completely destroyed after Hulk had thrown one of the snails. The busload of kids had been going to Oscorp for a field trip, and their teacher had missed the restrictions and sadly driven a bit too far into the war zone. They were all fine now, a bit shaken, non the less. But still, fine.
And look who is holding him up, it's that blonde daydream he sort of flirted with from the club, who now looks
It went to shit for the bad side really quick, once Natasha and Thor was by Steve’s side, and now making the guards drop like pins in a matter of minutes. Steve went over to the wall where Tony was slumped, and tried to shake him awake, but to no avail.
"Shut up Legolas, it’s not my fault i wasn't expecting to feel a fucking fuzzy head while being kidnapped." Tony answered, but they both knew he wasnt a bit irritated that Clint was there.
"Wa-wait! The caaaamera?" He said, his voice shaking from pain.
"So I'm sort of controlling the suit if shit hits the fan but JARVIS will be the one to take one of you home, Clint, hop onboard, Thor, take Natasha with you and follow the suit."
"I shall do whatever you deem necessary!" Thor proclaimed, as he had, after the first times, now completely gotten the hang of truth or dare. And after Sam said his dare it was simply a matter of time before the god of thunder prank called the pizzeria down the block to claim that his pizza had come without any sauce or cheese on it. And after that it was just all in since the metaphorical ice that hadn't even been there from the beginning now had completely been crushed.
Kudos and commenting are cherished of course! Take care <3
"Why do i have to do this, why couldn't it be Bruce, he's good with this kind of stuff. Oh goddammit."
The club was in full swing when Tony finally got away from the bouncers. Yeah he was The Tony Stark, but that apparently didn't matter to the grumpy-as-fuck bouncers as he had to stand in line for 30 fucking minutes before he got in. Screw them, he thought as he went directly up to the bar and ordered two shots, and downed them both in two swigs once the were presented in front of him.
(Or the one where Steve doesn't like fried chicken)
The Steve and Tony post got more likes.
At that, Tony, Clint and Sam laughed even harder than before.
Tony opened his eyes, nodded and made grabby hands at Steve, very childishly but he was too tired to notice or care. Steve took off his shoes and then very gingerly started laying down, pausing to ask if it was ok. Tony said yes. Once Steve was completely plastered against Tony's back, Tony took Steve's arm that laid loose and wrapped it around his waist. A silent reminder that it was ok. Steve started to draw small circles into Tony's side.
"Shut up."
Steve leaned closer to Tonys heart and whispered "Do you want to go to sleep?", Tony nodded in answer and Steve sat up and started to get up as if he was leaving. Tony couldn't help the small whine that came out of his throat, nor the embarrassment and realization that of course Steve wouldn't want to
"Hey Clint, wanna have a team night and force Steve to watch very sexual movies?" She proposed once the arrow-shooting had stopped. He paused abruptly from taking another arrow from his case on his back. And started talking a mile a minute.
Clint is tired of seeing Steve and Tony dance around eachother and have decided to do something about it.
Apparently that wasn't enough for the public, because they were now speculating on whether everything really was as safe as they once thought.
"You know, if you want it taken down, I'm sure Fury could fix that." Steve said, at last.
Thank you for reading and hopefully you are excited for the final bit where it is proven that Tony+Clint isn't = love
After he was done making sure he wasn't going to die anytime soon, he slowly opened his eyes and looked around in what looked like a small cell. The walls were concrete, so was the floor and about everything else, there was a small device, what he soon recognised to be a camera. That was monted up on the wall where a concrete door also excisted. He was pretty sure that the door would not be moved and probably had about 60 different locks on it to prevent him and whatever was in this cell from escaping.
"Why c-can’t we - oh my god your expression Steve - both just do it?" Clint forced out meanwhile was dying of laughter as well.
Over the table, Natasha and Clint winked at eachother, part one comeplete.
"is it ok if I take him back to ours buck? I mean I really don't want him to be alone and fuck knows who's gonna be there."
to go get some new pants or else Tony would not be able to be in the same room as them. Ever.
"What the fuck is this? And could you please shut up? Getting hit with a metal pole isn't the easiest to cope with. Jezz"
“Hawkeye and Iron Man, the new power-couple of the year?”
I thought i would apologize right off the bat for not posting chapters. Its been a bit over 2 months since the last one and I'm trying, but school is a pain in my ass and I've just lost all my motivation. But I'm back for now at least so let's make the best of it.
"Come in, unless you're Clint, then please fuck off and go away." A voice answered, that clearly belonged to one redheaded assassin.
She knew that Clint would totally be on board with the whole team dinner thing. And acually be onboard with it, not just saying he was because she could kill him in 0.4 seconds. After she had kicked him in the balls one time when he didnt agree on pizza for dinner, he usually said yes to whatever she proposed.
Had it all been a dream? It must’ve, because Tiberius’ eyes told him nothing that would give him the impression that anything changed. When he looked into Tiberius' eyes all he could see was desire, a deep, mean and cruel desire. The one that would crawl it’s way into your heart in the sweetest and daintiest way possible. Only to have it turn sour and cage your heart in until you couldn't breathe without the cage supporting your burnt out heart.
"Well, you see this thing that you and Clint aparantly have going on, is trending right now. So why not just go all the way and "leak" a picture of one of you kissing the other one on the cheek huh?"
“I need a shower.”
"Tell me it's not what I think it is, J," Tony mutters as he hurries to the kitchen. He is overtaken by another five roombas who are going the same way.
The sound of repulsors overhead accompany the word being cut short, along with the feeling of a cattle prod to his chest.
"You sound like Nat, YES, take

Odinson!"
He needs more Intel.
“That’s low hanging fruit, Birdbrain. Can we deduct points for that?” Tony asks with a smirk, bringing back his drink and plopping himself back down into Steve’s lap.
"That was nothing compared to Budapest," Clint replies smugly as Steve's finishing the art on his cast: all of them as chibis with petticoats, as per request.
They wait.
Tony pushes at Steve, and it makes the idiot giant jump into action and leap over onto James' roof to pull him into a bear hug.
"You've got a little something there," Steve points and carefully scoops a little batter from Tony's cheek to put into his mouth.
Tony will be okay. He must be.
Tony feels stripped raw under the powerful gaze of the intruder, his words hitting him like pieces of glass. It takes him a second to recover from being so blatantly exposed before his high society breeding kicks in and he straightens up, throwing his shoulders back slightly and wearing a grin as armour.
“For once, I agree with Thor. I really wouldn’t recommend that, Tony,” Bruce adds, with a tone that invites no argument.
“You’re a disgrace to the name of science, Brucie,” He says, although his attention is divided and he walks over to where Steve is sitting, still looking at Tony with a happy smile.
"Wanna see you, Tony? Can I?" He looks up at Tony pleadingly. "I promise I won't squash ya," he giggles.
"It's never too late to atone, never. Believe me, I know…"
But then something happens James didn't even dare imagine in the privacy of his own head. Steven Grant Rogers bends forward to gently press his lips to James' cheek, close to the corner of his mouth.
“Ow,” He mutters and that breaks the spell causing the whole room to burst into an uproar.
Tony huffs, rolling his eyes. Looks like the angel stopped playing the game, which is kind of disappointing. Tony had liked their little back and forth, getting the measure of each other. It was almost like flirting.
It gets worse.
"How about Jenga?" Bruce suggests when he sits down again with a steaming mug in his hands. “We’ve played it before so everyone knows the rules and it’s lesser stakes than revealing private information.”
your teammate's glasses, is chea-ting," Clint singsongs the last word.
Which is why he's currently perched on a rooftop across the street, looking through the scope of his recently acquired Steyr, waiting for Steven Grant Rogers' date to arrive.
Tony’s eyes widen, his pupils are blown out with arousal as he looks at Steve. “That… I’m gonna ignore that that was more than two words if you promise to come in my mouth at least one of those two times.”
Tony’s nails dig into the meat of Steve’s bicep as pleasure rushes through him in waves. A wordless cry of pleasure slips through his lips and he feels the hot splash of their come all over his chest and stomach.
Tony looks at Steve in shock not having expected this. The blond’s eyes are clear and his smile is so soft and adoring and it is trained on
"You little whore, you think it's funny to run away from the one who actually gives a fuck about your pathetic life?"
Apparently, the internet hadn’t forgotten thought. Because when Natasha opened the newspaper the next day. The joke was on the front page, along with the very obnoxious title.
So a free day was not going to be wasted just sitting around moping about in the tower. Plus both Bruce and Steve
Well, at least he seemed excited enough, she though as she threw a goodbye and a promise to see him later over her shoulder. He didn't answer, but she guessed he'd already gotten back into his "zone" or whatever it was. Either way she was now going to the common room and threaten the person there until they agreed that a team night was a great idea. And nobody could stop her.
"I understand your frustration, I really do. And that is why me, Sam and Thor already have come up with an idea as to how we are going to get these two idiots together. Because god knows Steve isn't any better." She almost sighted out, like it was physically tiring her to say that sentence, which, fair enough Clint guessed.
"No, yeah it's ok, he didn't do do anything."
Fuck.
I present: A angry-as-fuck Steve, self-sacrificing Tony, and a cute, but still slightly weird picture that led to the internet having a field trip. Enjoy!
He came to when someone showed him a little to hard onto a cold, hard concrete floor. He layed completely still for a while, waiting for someone to either close the door and leave or punch him, thankfully it was the first as he soon heard a clicking noise.
"Very well, then, take him." The small man told the bigger guards, who moved further into the cell to grab Tonys arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It wasn’t a question.”
"Something you got to tells us, Stark, Barton?"
Now, you may think that they could just get another set out, but the night before they had eaten takeout and therefor most of the forks were in the dishwasher. And after a unfortunate accident with the Hulk the comunalfloors kitchen now had half of the cutlery than it had before.
"Yeah, look at that! I'm practically running on a full nights, well, days, sleep!" Tony proclaimed.
It was tense a couple of seconds as they waited for an answer, but when Bruce’s answer came through all of them visbly sacked and let out a big breath. The speaker sparked but Bruce’s relif was clear in his voice aswell.
"WHAT. THE. FUCK?" Clint started, all the while moving swiftly through the corridoors, occasionally stopping to bang his metal pole against someones skull, as one does.
Natasha smiled to herself where she was sat, curled up in a bean bag with Bruce on her right and Sam on her left. Tony was breathing deeply into the mask while trying not to burst out again, and Clint was on the floor rolling in laughter.
"Well, i'm gonna have to lift you. Because you and I can't climb on that counter and we both know it."
“You are most welcome,
And that's when he heard the first cough, then a second, third, fourthfifthsixthseventh all followed in rapid speed after each other. He looked up, and Bruce was, of course chocking on the curry that he had sample-tasted just seconds before Tony's ass-wiggle, thankfully Thor came to the rescue and thumped Bruce on the back a couple of times before Bruce finally got the coughs down.
Natasha gave a quick ok back and after 2 mintues they heard a big thud as the rock was lifted to the side, they heard Bruce’s voice in the speakers of the iron man suit, and as it decended onto the ground from the stairs Bruce started explaining.
"Honestly, you should've told me that earlier, if I knew it was that easy then I wouldn't have had to get all the glasses up to the top shelf." Clint joked back.
But Ty sadly has the upper hand and starts to unbuckle his own belt, once he's done he bends down a bit and starts to unbuckle Tony's too. He's about to drag the belt through the little loops in Tonys jeans when they hear footsteps running towards them at rapid speed, suddenly Ty is being pulled back from Tony and pushed up against the brick wall behind him.
___________________________________________
"What? Hold up, hold up, hold up. Why do i have to fly with the suit? I was in god damn capity?" Clint exclaimed, once again irritated.
Steve did just that with a slight nod to his head, and Bruce went back to quickly cleaning the edges, getting them back to it’s clean, metal state. Once that was over, he took the new reactor, placed it gently into the socket, got it connected to the plate with a slight buzz, and then locked it in place again with the screws.
The day after everyone were gathered in Tony's room in the medic-area in the tower and when the avengers got to see the very untrue and slightly romantic headline:
"Yeah isn't it, also, don't worry about my balls, it's not like it's freezing or anything." Clint complained, while he was tying the suitjacket to Tony's leg.
Well, except for Tony that is. He was forced out of his workshop by Steve. And showed up just as dinner was ready at 7.30. But his hair was still wet from showering (Steve had exclaimed that it smelled like a mix of motor oil and old smoothies, which, let's be real, wasn't that far from the truth than Steve wanted to believe.) and had a fresh pair of clothes on. So they counted the 30 minute delay worth it.
“Almost complete, Sir. The memory banks from before the incident and from JARVIS Beta post incident are being synced. There is still a gap in the surveillance and memory files between the two time points, however, I will be fully functional in the penthouse in thirty minutes.”
“I tire of watching this, wake me when it is my turn to play!” Thor calls, collapsing on his back onto the rug.
Sitting on the armchair right across from him is well, a goddamn specimen of a man, with a goddamn
“You’re… such a - a sap,” Tony mumbles and he buries his nose in Steve’s hair, wrapping his arms around his shoulders. He’s never let anyone get this close before, never let anyone touch it,
Oh god. What is even his luck?
he has to get away.
“NOOOO,” Steve yells, but it’s no use. Almost in slow motion he sees the armour fly into reach of the sword arms just as Thor comes up from behind. Steve sees Thor lift his hammer to smash what could be the power source, but too late. The giant bot flings out one of its arms,
There is one promising moment when -- through some manipulation -- Steve and Tony end up on the roof terrace instead of inside the restaurant (all Stark's billions are worth nothing against a threat from the Winter Soldier). Soon Tony's teeth are chattering and Steve scoots close to offer him his jacket. James holds his breath when they smile so sweetly at each other and Steve holds onto Tony's shoulders longer than necessary.
confession which Tony’s not thinking too much about or he might just shout giddily like a drunk madman- makes him want to have this gorgeous man all to himself.
"You take that back, Captain Giggles." Clint sits forward on his couch to glare at Steve. With his black and blue face it's almost threatening.
“Hoped you’d kiss me this time,” Tony smirks but then he sighs and loses consciousness, leaving Steve to fight his tears alone as S.H.I.E.L.D. medics rush in to take Tony from his arms.
“Your loyal subject? Squire?
think about how Tony's plush lips would look around Steve's dick.
JARVIS goes quiet at that and Tony is left with his own buzzing thoughts. Sighing, he pulls out his new phone and dials, waiting as the call connects, unsure of what he’ll say but knowing that he’ll feel better after talking.
He’s breathtaking. And he’s
The tense silence between them stretches long enough that Tony feels a little fear mixed with his indignation but then the guy nods to himself as if coming to a conclusion and eases back into his normal demeanour, dropping the scary angel schtick.
, but he knows he disappeared for months once, before they came looking. It must've been the way his human gave him back the reins to his mind that set them off this time. The breaking of a spell is as powerful as the binding of one.
There's pink… goop everywhere, including covering one super soldier
he needs to explain they have the wrong boy, but no one ever listens to Sara Rogers' kid with his crooked spine and fanciful ideas. If you can't work the land you're a burden, simple as that.
Steve starts running the moment he sees the bot starts shooting out electricity and all the little ones stutter for a moment. "The large one feeds off the smaller ones! Stop frying them!" he yells frantically in the comms.
of his memories where Steven Grant Rogers features, James is certain he felt some kind of exasperation.
There's no one behind him, which means they're somehow transmitting to him and he doesn't kn--
who's
James knew it wouldn't last, but he hadn't expected them to come this quickly. Cradling his love like he did, he had been foolish enough to hope for a brief respite. A day, maybe two.
Steve isn't surprised to find a gift basket the next morning at his door, containing three different shower gels, five bath bombs, and a heron shaped umbrella.
He leans his forehead against Tony's when the need to pump his hips dies down. "Sorry," he smiles, a little embarrassed. "It's another serum thing…"
, Tony mouths to himself in amusement. A multitude of questions sit on the tip of his tongue about whether he’d even been capable of getting drunk post-serum, what kind of symptoms he’s feeling but all that vanishes when the man all but
"I'm not sure what to say to that," Tony says after studying James. "A point could be made that nothing is real, shadows in a cave and all that, but I got a feeling you don't mean it in the philosophical sense…" Tony huffs a laugh his eyes don't share, and James feels sorry he blurted it out. Tony's eyes should always shine.
"I meant twice for ev'rything," Steve adds, hoping for more of that wide eyed look where it seems Tony wants to devour Steve. Steve is good with being devoured. More than twice.
"You want to play with the ball?"
“Do you think we can take you home, Snowflake?” Tony asks, voice as gentle as his hands when James' breathing has become more regular again.
Thor turns to Steve with a beatific smile on his face which Steve trusts for as far as he can throw the demigod.
“Don’t worry, take your time, cupcake, there’s no rush,” Tony soothes James, but he doesn’t understand.
All he knew was that there was this hulking blond man who resembled the sickly fae from his cryo dreams, and because he desperately needed some kind of mission he had taken it upon himself to shadow the man.
"... stupid names like Polemistés and Bucky.”
Steve understands he didn't have Tony's attention before, not like this. Tony's full focus is on him now, and it takes Steve further off kilter. He's used to being around beings that can literally see into your soul, but this is something else. Part of him -- the trained part -- wants to deflect and lie, but a new part wants to throw caution to the wind and see where it'll take him.
“What the everloving fuck was that?” Iron Man lands next to Steve with one hand on Steve’s shoulder, looking him up and down. “You alright? No after effects? What the hell did it do to you?”
"You would never," Steve says with conviction, and it makes James both feel warm and even more annoyed. He does not deserve the trust. Never has. And as always, Steve deserves something better. Like a billionaire, genius, philanthropist.
Steve reels, physically stumbling backwards as Tony suddenly utters the name he hasn't heard in three centuries.
Tony feels like a chastened child and he hates it, hates how it reminds him of Howard, of the board members who treat him like a child, as if he’s not smarter than
Tony gets into the zone, trading quips back and forth with Nat as he targets all the safest pieces first. Despite already being about three drinks down, his hands are relatively steady.
Maybe Tony had it wrong, maybe it was just the shock that made him act like that, maybe – a voice snakes in through his thoughts that sounds unsurprisingly like Howard telling him he’s
"This is all," the artificial intelligence answers and an image appears. No, a clip. In it, a demon appears from thin air -- seen from the side -- not far from where they're standing now. Steve recognises the outline of its horns and subconsciously tenses for battle. But where the Soldier usually is muzzled and dressed all in black, he's naked now. The demon raises from a crouch and looks disoriented, in pain. It needs a moment to gather itself, it seems.
The second bot waves briefly at James, before grabbing Steve's shirt and pulling him along to where it was working.
Yeah, maybe it’s better that Obie pushed him to get cleaned up and deposited him in his lab because if he’d been left to his own devices, Tony’s sure he’d be deep into a bottle somewhere in the ruined penthouse.
“Bedroom?” He kisses along Tony’s jaw as he asks. A bed would be preferable, but at this point
-----
"These are nice pants," he sighs. "It would be a shame if someone
Steve is always early for appointments. James knows this is because he's used to leaving home early to make up for any number of asthma attacks along the way. James also knows Steve is terrible at waiting, and will change position and fiddle with stuff non stop.
"No, it's murder Santa Claus," James yells and waves up and down his all black tactical gear.
"I know," Tony grins, and it's just like he hasn't spent four days in an artificial coma.
and Tony feels out of his depth in a way he rarely does. Suffice to say he recognises the signs of an anxiety attack immediately, he’s no stranger to them. But he’s rarely in a position to comfort someone else rather than the one who hides when the anxiety hits and tries to grit and bear it.
?!  “Woah! Okay, Huggy bear, we’re doing this then.”
summon a creature from hell, for instance. The thought helps Steve to keep himself from going over and pull Tony in a hug, however much the kid might need the comfort.
"No!" Steve yells, but it's too late. He runs after them but there's no way he can keep up with the carriage once it picks up speed, misshapen and sickly as he is. He falls to his knees on the soot covered road and weeps.
“Hey! You two! Stop being all lovey-dovey and give your vote for Jenga!” Clint calls out from across the room, throwing a marker cap towards Steve and Tony.
"Ready to give up, Steven?" Tony asks with a glint in his eye, and Steve shakes his head.
He's most definitely not here to enjoy himself and quietly wish he could always stay. It doesn't matter what Bucky used to want
Tony freezes slightly when Steve’s hands reach towards his chest but when there are no moves to take his shirt off, he relaxes. Steve might have torn through his pants without any regard to Italian tailoring but the fact that he asks permission to take off his shirt causes Tony to smile dopily at him.
Well.
"What's happening," Tony asks over the comms as the cube, Ayu, starts to wobble and shimmer.
"Yes, Steven?"
He swallows but holds his ground. There’s a feeling of protectiveness that he’s feeling for Bucky, despite the fact that earlier today he was contemplating whether the demon had put him under a spell.
Tony works more and more of Steve’s cock into his mouth, breathing through his nose, as he lets himself accommodate to the sheer size of him. By the time his lips touch the top of his hand where it curls around Steve’s base, he has almost reached his limit.

“Hey, it’s okay. Breathe. You know him, don’t you? You know Bucky... ” Tony trails off, uncertain what to say, if he
dimwittery.
“Raw eggs, you’re licking raw eggs. There’s poop in raw flour.”
With JARVIS’ words, Tony’s reminded of the AI’s namesake and the kindness he exuded. What would Jarvis do? Certainly not gawk at the person losing their shit without helping.
He leans down on an impulse to press a soft kiss onto the centre of it. "Thank you for keeping Tony alive," he whispers softly, closing his eyes as he presses his ear against the casing to soak up the familiar hum of the machine.
Steve clutches his chest in laughter and almost startles when his hand encounters the wet, cold,
“Hey, big guy. You sure the mead isn’t getting to you a bit?” He asks, teasing him slightly but mostly concerned.

"You… and then their face… and… and... all of them!" Tony's laughing so hard Steve can barely make out the words, clinging to the railing to keep himself upright.
“Chocolate looks better on you. The batter looks better,” Steve giggles and it’s such a stupid pun but Tony can’t help but laugh at it.
“Yeah, yeah, you can take it off,” Tony agrees, leaning down to kiss the edge of that boyish smile. “I trust you,” he murmurs against Steve’s skin. He barely stops another word to slip out in its place. No, it’s too early for that, he can’t, not like this.
is in the bottom drawer.” He adds, indicating with his chin to the side table.
, Steve thinks, partly to deny he might like the touch himself. Bizarrely, Tony smells familiar, like home, and Steve unconsciously leans closer.
Tony looks up from where he’s messing with a new type of water filtration system. Messing meaning playing with water and chemicals to see how good it actually is. JARVIS is the best at computing, but nothing beats the hands on approach from time to time.
The elevator doors are open and he steps inside with his precious charge.
"Hmm, yeah, was gonna make a cake this high," Tony answers, motioning at the height of his breast bone. "So you could eat whatever your crazy super stomach can stomach," he shrugs. Never mind he never baked anything more complicated than an omelette in his life. Baking is science, right? Maybe decrease power by 2.4 percent and make the bowls 32 percent bigger. What if he decreased the surface area of the--
“Me neither, buddy. But we gotta make do with what we have.”
There’s a moment of silence as a block tumbles off the table and bounces off Tony’s head.
"Hey," he smiles instead, and scoots a little closer to the bed, where he carefully slides his hand under Tony's again in a move already familiar to him. New is how Tony softly squeezes back, and how his smile turns even brighter despite his obvious fatigue.
“Hey back to you, Captain Handsome.”
Maybe you
Steve studies the boy. He's like an angry little kitten, all hisses and claws, but ultimately harmless. Though it won't do to underestimate him. Steve takes in the bags under his eyes, the bruise on his neck that peeps above his shirt, the weary slant of his shoulders. It all pales at the look in the boy's eyes.
"It's not a guilt trip. It's a stating of facts.
He throws his head back with as much force as he can muster and feels grim satisfaction when it connects with the man's nose with a dull crack.
It wasn’t technically untrue, he’d called a
Steve bends forward. "Thank you," he grins and all but jumps out of the bed. After a soft hint from Jarvis, Steve finds the towels and picks the softest one. He takes it, along with a washcloth and a basin of warm water with the nicest smelling soap he can find.
Tony watches the shock on the guy’s face transform to anger before he tries to hide it - not the best poker face though, cause his anger is obvious in the clench of that jaw (you could cut someone on that jawline,
He does a jaunty little knock on the wood when he stands in front of the door, but his unease grows when nothing happens.
_________________
Steve smiles and sits down between them to take up his vigil again. Bruce hands him a large coffee and Clint the last donut.
Tony hates the height disadvantage he’s at, even standing up there’s no way he’s actually gonna come anywhere above the dude’s chin but now, with him sitting on the couch, it’s extremely pronounced. So, he does the next logical thing and pushes himself up to stand on the couch so he can look the guy in the eye.
Tony winces, his shoulder throbbing where Obie had put pressure on a bite he hadn’t even realised he’d accumulated along with all his other bruises in the shape of fingers on his hips, love bites scattered all over his body, and a few imprints of teeth.
"Agent, any developments?"
. Still, it’s not enough for him to completely trust the angel either. He’s been testing him, Tony’s not gonna lie. There’s way too many variables in this situation and he needs to have more information before he goes and lays his own cards out on the table.
"That's not the only pink I'm wearing," he whispers, before turning around and walking away, laughing out loud when Tony coughs.
Good ol’ JARVIS, he thinks with a sense of fondness. He needs to get to the control panel, it’ll be better if he can get JARVIS his eyes and ears back.
Tony’s ass feels so much better than Steve could’ve imagined it would. It’s perfect. Steve could knead and massage it for the rest of his life and die a happy man.
, James is as weak to that sad face as he ever was.
Still, he takes advantage of when the rest of the team is distracted and runs his nose along Steve’s jaw - the slight stubble tells him he’s not shaved today and Tony for some reason loves that he can let himself go with them like this - and plants a kiss on his jaw. “We can ditch the party any time you like, soldier. Just say the word.”
James is sitting on a bench across the bakery where they'll meet in fifteen minutes. Or more accurately, where Steve will arrive in the next fifteen minutes and Tony anywhere between twenty minutes and two hours from now.
"Didn't need much convincing," Steve groans and flips them over in one swift movement, glad his head is clear enough again it doesn't cause any spinning. "Kinda dreamt of doing this siiiince…" Steve smiles and presses soft kisses all over Tony's face as he thinks back. "I think since the second day after moving into the tower, and you suggested we'd go sparring."
“Don’t think Steve would like that very much,” Nat teases.
Steve grins unabashedly at Tony's gasp as he neatly puts down
Tony pulls Steve's cock into his mouth further and further and Steve stares at him open mouthed.
Round and round his thoughts go. The image of the huge demon overlapping images of Bucky Steve has held onto during his darkest moments, and reverberating through his entire being one word:
“Hello,” James says carefully, and notices the name on the strut.
Perhaps he should stop fighting it?
"I haven't lost at Scrabble for three decades, I'm giving you the opportunity to walk away with your dignity somewhat intact…"
After seven hours and twenty three minutes, the doctor comes out, looking worn but confident. Thor is on his third food run, Clint is off doing magic tricks on the pediatric ward, but Nat, Bruce and Virginia - who joined them two hours ago - all stand up with Steve to hear what she has to say.
Later, after the nurses and doctors have bustled around and done their tests, after Steve talked to Rhodey on the phone to give his team the good news, after Steve has had a shower and a shave, they sit together again. Tony is a little more upright in the bed - the horrid nasal tube gone and a little more colour on his cheeks.
“Should I rename that one to Hell Hath No Fury or… Dancing with the Devil?”
Suddenly there's a commotion in the group of cubes. The screeching pitches even higher until it falls still. The things - aliens?- have no discernable features, but still Steve feels like their attention is focused on him. He turns towards them and waves for lack of an alternative action.
With a little difficulty Steve gets to his feet, and even manages to stay upright, despite the whole world spinning violently for a moment.
when something crashes and the rest of the team yells and applauds.
Tony moans against Steve’s lips sitting up a little and they both take his shirt off together, leaving a dark undershirt which masks the glow of the reactor.
He pulls back to grin at Tony, the recollection of that day clear behind Tony's eyes. It had been a disaster, but a fun disaster, with both of them unrepentantly cheating to win. Steve had fallen head over heels ever since those first moments together.
James looks up to see Clint looking chagrined, with a gloating Nat right behind him.
Clint pokes Steve's shoulder. "Fine."
” Steve asks, watching as Tony licks
for someone they barely know and don’t like? Who has ever planted themselves in front of Tony like that before?
Tony in addition to just seeing him, James is starting to feel for him as well. Tony so obviously, totally, completely throws his whole self for grabs at Steve,
On one hand he’s glad Rhodey freaked out enough to call Obie to check on him - both because he didn’t want his best friend to take an emergency leave and come check on him and because he knew that if nobody pulled him out of his head in those few hours after waking up, he would have spiralled hard.
He cups Steve over his underwear, feeling out the length of him - his mind invariably running calculations about the length and girth- and rubs his fingertips over the cockhead where the fabric was soaked with precum.
Tony’s mouth trails kisses along Steve’s jaw before placing a line of hickies along the side of his neck despite them both knowing that the marks won’t stay long, not with Steve’s healing factor. His nails scratch against Steve’s shoulder as he leans up slightly to bite down on Steve’s earlobe, tugging it lightly, “I want to
in fact a demon and he’s someone you wanted to hunt for causing widespread, how did you put it -
“Can’t wait to have you on top of me like this, pounding into me with that gorgeous cock of yours. Or have you
At the end of the day Steve bids the other workers farewell as they leave, and settles in a big armchair to wait, his sword on his knees.
“We talked about voicing this out loud,” Nat says, running her fingers through Clint’s hair with the arm she has propped on the back of the sectional, one foot propped on the coffee table.
Unfortunately when Steve lowered the flowers it wasn't to the sight of a perfect three tier three types of chocolate heart shaped cake on the pristine table in their pristine kitchen, but to… well. Even Tony with all his eloquence has trouble describing the sheer scale of the mess surrounding them.
Settling the prototype fabric he brought as a conversation starter onto his lap, Tony sits down to wait Steve out, luxuriating in the knowledge they’re going
Fond exasperation. Annoyed exasperation. Exasperated exasperation. A feeling of
"He was my friend…"
He barely has the realisation that Steve chose this moment to bear hug him from the back before he loses his footing and bumps his shoulder against the Jenga tower, causing it to come down in a rain of wooden blocks.
"Fine, then I'll never tell you about that undercover mission in Algiers me and Phil ran," he says nonchalantly, taking a sip of his beer before bending over his work again.
-- flipping through the menu for the seventh time.
Tony can sense the censure in JARVIS' robotic tone and he feels highly judged by his own creation. “I don’t know what I intend, J. I don’t even know how much of that
Speaking of…
Tony swallows at how
“Why not? He and I have been imbibing in the
"You had a bet going on us?" Tony sounds a mixture of incredulous and smug, but instead of pursuing this he shakes his head and looks back at James and Steve. “Never mind, don’t wanna know. I just wanna take these
No. No more. He flings himself away from that line of thought, and focuses on the memory of Tony surrendering to him willingly, opening up so beautifully, as he hauls the body onto his shoulder and throws it into a dumpster at the mouth of the alley.
Clint mimes zipping his lips shut. "What happened there is between Nat, me, and a drag queen called Rhonda."
super soldiers, not their metal limbed, knock off serumed, brainfucked childhood buddies.
in that rare way that means he actually cares, he’s funny, smart, perceptive. He’s also a total slob, and a cheat and a rival to Clint and Tony’s level of sarcasm and teasing. He’s a sore loser and an arguer for the sake of arguing and Tony is madly, utterly gone over him.
The dumb fucks should not be hovering over an unstable assassin like this, and it's his annoyance at this blatant disregard for their own safety that makes him snap out of whatever came over him.
Steve grits his teeth against the noise which sounds like nails over blackboard times twenty, even through the ear plugs their teammates warned them to wear.
James duct tapes the villain's mouth shut, and ties him up with a neat little bow, ready to hand over as soon as the date ends.
“Sir, a situation has arisen in the kitchen I believe needs your attention.”
. Oh my god, I can’t believe I slept with a nonagenarian.”
fellas,” Steve supplies with a wink of his own. Had this not been all James’ fantasy he would’ve been suspicious at the sudden change of heart from both men. As it is he shrugs it off and enjoys it. Who knows when his brain will have recovered and he is thrown back to whatever hellhole his body is currently in.
"What's up, J?"
to say to this man, but he feels his eyes moisten and his lower lip wants to wobble, so he keeps his mouth shut in a painful smile.
Steve and Tony date nights are now Steve and Tony and James date nights. Though James is the only one who calls it that, he has a sneaking suspicion that the Widow and the archer have some kind of betting pool going. Instead of helping his cause, the jerks suggest increasingly romantic spots they should visit as the three of them. If James manages to get away from Steve, it's Tony who comes to collect him before they depart. There's no way to keep himself apart.
He remembers this one. Standing to the side laughing when someone else made James do-
Steve trips and almost lets go of Tony, but fortunately even drunk his reflexes are better than a baseline human’s, and he manages to keep hold of Tony while keeping his footing.
"Hey," Steve smiles, and puts his mug down to wrap both his arms around Tony's waist.
"Captain, it seems one of their scientists inadvertently opened the portal that sucked them in. They are deeply sorry for any inconvenience caused and like to return home as swiftly as possible."
"I'm not here to kidnap you," he continues, folding his arms in front of his chest, "but to request your help."
"You just…" Tony starts when he catches up with Steve and waves in Steve's general direction to convey the rest of the sentence. To be fair Tony seems to make an effort to school his features as far as they're not obscured by his sunglasses, but Steve
He folds in on himself, covering his face with his hands as the full horror of this revelation washes over him.
“You feeling the effects of the mead there, Chuckles?” Tony teases, bumping his shoulder against Steve’s.
“In on what? What’s going on?” Tony looks up to narrow his eyes at his teammates, but Steve barely looks away from James. Because it's not real anyway, James smiles back as wide as he feels like.
"Was Scrabble on your super soldier boot camp itinerary?"
Over Steve’s shoulder Tony catches the rare sight of Dr. Bruce Banner, multiple PhD holder and one of the smartest men on the planet, go red and splutter nonsense words.
He resists the urge to speed up and jog towards the elevator. That would be running away, and Steve Rogers never runs away from anything, ask the Smithsonian.
"The Captain is working."
Over time, he realises that all that wiggling around on Steve’s lap has led to some
A heavy hand falls on Tony’s shoulder and he startles slightly before looking up into the concerned gaze of his godfather.
"Please?"
The longer he stays out of the ice the more he becomes a man again instead of a thing. With a name (James Barnes), dislikes (cold, bananas, people chewing gum, torture, Captain America), and likes (chocolate surprise eggs, the sun on his face when he wakes, the beep the register makes at the supermarket, going to the supermarket, memories of a tiny Steve).
"You should kiss," he states firmly, clinging to his mission like a drowning man to a raft.
believe how long it takes for an internal audit plan to be passed by the board. I thought Tamika was going to skewer Henrickson with her pencil,” he announces, rolling up his cuffs as he walks into the room, smiling at the Avengers lounging in various configurations around the coffee table.
“Sorry, lost in my thoughts. Just get the crew to clean up and give me an estimate on the time needed to repair the broken shit.”
bit closer.
On the other hand, Tony suspects that Steve and Nat have actually turned it into some sort of a game pitting supersoldier observational skills against superspy sneakiness.
Sheesh. He really needs to get his shit together.
"You can call me Polemistés," he answers, and unfolds his wings. For a second the whole apartment is bathed in a golden light, before he pulls them back and takes up the guise of a human again.
Panic makes it impossible to think, impossible to breath, as he sinks to his knees on the pavement to cradle his head to his chest.
“Mister Stark is a
Polemistés = Ancient Greek for Warrior
Tony is seconds away from going for the piece that he knows will guarantee stability despite removal - he has an engineering degree, he doesn’t know what they expected when they challenged him to a game based on physics- when two hundred pounds of weight crashes into him like an eighteen wheeler, draping over his back.
beer.
Even tipsy and horny as they both are, his boyfriend is so damn thoughtful and mindful of boundaries, unlike anyone else he’s ever been with.
enthusiastic.”
Just when he thinks it can't get any worse a large one emerges. And of course Tony goes at it by himself. And of course that's where Doom located all of his fire power.
"I forgot how big I am and how… how tiny you are and I love you so much but now I flattened you." He's vaguely aware that in the background people are having difficulty breathing with laughing so hard, but he feels like his heart is breaking- actually breaking- and he looks sadly at Tony.
And like that James is adopted into Avengers tower.
The cold bites his skin after the warmth of his
Tony’s surprised Steve hasn’t nagged her into taking it off the table, although it’s possible she’s just taking advantage of Steve’s preoccupation with his conversation with Thor.
"And then you just had to…" Tony exclaims, laughing out loud now.
"Your turn," he says sweetly and pulls two letters from the bag.
They operate on Tony for hours. Hours Steve spends on a chair he took from the waiting room and put down outside the operating theatre. An intern tries to dissuade him from waiting here, but he only needs to raise an eyebrow to send the young man on his way. Later a nurse ushers Steve into an empty room after hour three, and orders him to shower and change ‘or else’. He’s not sure if it’s because he’s numb to the point where it feels like the ice, or because she reminds him of his mom, but Steve complies and when he emerges from the scalding hot water he’s not surprised to find his own clean clothes on the empty bed and Nat, Clint, Bruce and Thor waiting on their own borrowed chairs in the hall next to Steve’s.
"No?" He doesn't squeak. Stark men grunt, it was a manly grunt.
but that was besides the point. The transaction was more or less the same. Although what the payment for that might be is something Tony really doesn’t care to think about.
Instead, he hugs Steve around the waist, nuzzling into his shoulder. “Love you too, Steve Rogers,” He whispers into his warm skin, feeling the trickle of a tear run down his nose and fall.
Tony laughs at that, shaking his head, "I think I'm good for now. I prefer to destroy my enemies with facts and logic. And explosions." He adds with a grin as he fetches a beer from the fridge.
Let no one know that the way to Tony’s good graces is through his bots. A curious question pops into his mind about how this warrior would behave when confronted by the overgrown robot child that is DUM-E.
Steve smiles at Tony and puts his arm around Tony's shoulders. Their relationship is still new enough to make him feel all giddy at every touch they share, his stomach doing this odd swooping thing.
"I read about this power smoothie online?"  Steve hedges, and Tony wonders what exactly was in it to make it this… pink and viscous.
Steve weaves his way through the sea of bots, his speed making him hard for them to attach to, but still he isn’t going fast enough. Thor wacks the large bot with his hammer while Iron Man hovers and darts just out of reach of the unibeam the large bot has in a parody of the Iron man armour. The thing transforms as Steve vaults over… he doesn't even register over what when the large bot grabs hold of Iron Man and flings him into a nearby building.
Hooking his fingers into the waistbands of both Steve’s jeans and underwear, he pulls them down as he moves lower still, his eyes greedily taking in every inch of Steve that’s revealed to him.
“Don’t you dare apologise for that, that was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen,” he whispers, and the moment is gone.
shit.
Steve, the idiot, denies the flowers James has sent in his name to Tony during their afternoon walk are his, and pays the delivery guy to
rather than
Steve calling after him.
Something passes over Steve's face at the mention of ‘mission’, and James clearly remembers Steve's battered face under his hands. Just another thing on James' list of things he's sorry for.
But why not send him to hell and be done with it? It doesn't make any sense.
Steve wraps his arms around Tony's shoulders without hesitation, but his grip slightly falters at the confession before holding onto Tony extra tight. He hadn't expected Tony to say it back, not now, not so soon, not after Tony asked Steve to tell him again in the morning. To hear the words...
Steve locates the place where the signal originated easily. It's in one of the tallest buildings of the city, and he rides the elevator to the top floor with a crew of workmen. They believe his white lie that he's part of another crew, and he scouts the penthouse thoroughly. There's no doubt this is the right place, but of the owner or the demon there's no trace. The place is a mess. There's clearly been some kind of struggle, and the whole place reeks of sex. Nothing useful though. No spellbooks, pentagrams, or any other paraphernalia these bastards usually keep lying around. The work crew treats it like they encounter this kind of thing every day, and Steve amuses himself by helping them clear out the ruined carpet and putting in new.
He stops his trek at the lounge chair when his eye falls on the sketch book that lies open on the ground next to it.
for that chase.
Steve relaxes at the kid's explanation, and resheathes his sword with a decisive snick. Steve doesn't know a lot about modern technology. Just enough to get by and not stand out on missions. He hadn't realized humanity has managed to create intelligence yet, but he isn't surprised.
Was Steve elevated as punishment? Steve whimpers when the thought hits him he would've found out
"You came back," Steve sighs, and tightens his hold when James doesn't pull away.
The sudden vision of Steve in the shower helpfully blooms in front of Tony's mind's eye, but he's sure JARVIS would've just told him that, so he shakes his head to clear it.
New screeching sounds and they all look at the portal for a new incomer, but nothing emerges. The cubes start screeching enthusiastically when Thor lands next to them, screeching back.
He takes care to clean Tony gently, methodically. He wipes Tony's sweaty brow first, cleans their joined come off his stomach, places a kiss on top of Tony's soft dick after cleaning it as well. With every touch he shows how much he loves this man, and it makes Steve feel centred and calm, almost like before a battle.
But Bucky had been nothing but kind to Tony and it wasn’t like he promised him anything other than a good fuck, but
When the blond had shoved Tony away to go make demands of his AI, Tony had felt a dawning sense of horror at having let himself be manipulated so easily. Obviously the dude was just showing Tony affection because he was trying to get information out of him. And Tony, like an idiot, had fallen right into his trap. And that too, so soon after Sunset, so soon after Tony had caused major losses to his company because of her corporate espionage.
"Now it's your turn, damnit," Steve giggles when his breath has returned to a normal rhythm. He’s stroking gently through Tony's hair where he's resting his head on Steve's stomach. To say Steve feels amazing is like saying Niagara falls are a nice water feature. He has never felt this good in his entire life, like this with his best fella in his arms, and he wants to return the favour.
Steve chuckles. The common area has been renovated no less than six times. Once after the invasion, once after a particularly vicious prank war they all had part in, and the other four times due to a Hulk out incident. He chuckles again when he remembers the guacamole disaster of 2012, when arguably everyone had been a green monster.
“I - I can live alone, I’m not a child. I’m 25, I own a multibillion dollar company, for God’s sake,” Tony mumbles into the guy’s shoulder. “I’m a grown ass man, you don’t need to - I don’t need pity hugs. Or pity fucks.” His hands belie his words as he grips the angel tighter and lets some of the weight fall from his shoulders.
"your,"
So far seven cubes have fallen through the portal and just when Steve exits the quinjet he sees another one emerge, falling the sixty odd feet with a high pitched screech, and then bouncing back up at impact. Everyone braces themselves when the cube seems to come their way, but somehow the thing manages to control its course and bounces over to where the rest lay screeching amongst themselves.
Tony’s parted lips beg to be kissed again, so Steve does, languidly. To him the urgent press of arousal has diminished, and he wants to take his time to explore his lover, but when Tony moves, his hard cock presses against Steve’s thigh, reminding Steve he is on a mission.
Steve doesn’t give voice to that thought, because he knows the kid won’t answer it. And he’s getting fed up with calling the kid ‘kid’.
Before Tony and Clint can devolve into a bickering match, which has been known to go on for days even, Thor interrupts. “I’m still unclear as to the objective of this game.”
were in on it?” James asks, incredulous.
and could he ever completely disprove that his mind hadn’t been messed with?
, where he knows Tony was planning something else. It doesn't give him that many points, but blocking Tony's master move towards triple word points is worth it.
Steve just shot its way to the top spot of Tony's mental spank bank. He can only hope JARVIS loves him enough to have made a recording. From several angles. Not that Tony would watch those, because that would be creepy, but it would be nice to know it exists.
"Don't know," Steve sighs and finally takes a sip of his drink. He almost answered Tony's questions, but if he goes after Bucky -- to save instead of kill -- he won't have the backup of heaven anymore, and he needs to keep his wits about him. "But I want to save him."
“I like the coffee toffee one best,” he smiles, and he looks so genuinely pleased and angelic that Tony has to reach out to smear a dollop of the indicated flavour onto Steve’s nose.
James' lists of likes and dislikes get longer every day.
Steve sounds bewildered. Bewildered is not how lovers should sound on Valentine's day. Tony might not know much about the holiday, but bewildered isn't on the little flash card he made. Neither was Steve arriving two hours earlier than expected, face hidden behind a bouquet of flowers so obscenely large only a super soldier could carry it.
Clint whispers in Steve’s ear, and Steve guffaws, hiding it by screwing on the lid on his pen.
He sighs, faceplanting into his desk with a muttered, “Ow.”
that being tortured for decades would give you something like calluses on your soul, but
Okay, so maybe he can’t resist shaking up this virtuous being’s world view a little. It’s his lot in life to be the scandal so why not fucking own it?
"There were…"
Steve shoots Tony a Look and Tony holds up his hands before pushing his sunglasses up into his hair. "Yeah, fair enough."
James doesn't understand what is taking them so long to proceed to the next stage of their relationship. It's very clear -- to James -- that Steve is sad about it. There's this slant to his shoulders that screams disappointed resignation, just before Just A Rather Very Intelligent System makes the windows opaque and James loses his view.
would like to offer you a parting gift, for your hospitality."
Sitting up, he gets his knees under him and shifts so that he is straddling Steve and takes stock of the sight below him.
“Okay, JARVIS, I’m almost through the front door and then I can fix the issue with the security cams. Please tell me all the other systems are fine?” Tony asks with an exhausted sigh as he enters the passcode to the penthouse on the elevator.
"I knoooow!" Tony practically wails.
It takes a few weeks -- and several raids of not so former Hydra bases (where he may or may not maim or kill everyone in his way) to obtain the equipment -- but then he has mics installed in all the usual places Steve and Tony visit.
“You didn’t know… you didn’t know he was a - what he became,” he vocalises, coming to the realisations as he speaks, turning them into words of comfort - whatever paltry comfort someone like him can offer.
Once he’s satisfied, he places the bowl on the floor below, throwing the washcloth and soap in it, uncaring how it falls.
Tony pouts, turning to look Bruce in the eyes, “Well, you could’ve just taken a glass for us to experiment on. Don’t
"Your turn, Tony," Nat announces, and Steve blinks stupidly for a second before he gathers this means he needs to let go of his boyfriend (his
"Yeah, not until after several dates and an elaborate kinks negotiation."
, this incomprehensible situation that he knows
Before he gets more emotional and starts crying or something equally embarrassing, Tony pushes Steve back onto the mattress. He starts kissing down his chest slowly, showing without words just how
or whatever
"That was the bee's knees," Steve says with a soft smile, gently running his fingers through Tony's curls.
. Plus, think of all the splinters,” Tony fakes a shudder as he surreptitiously angles an empty glass towards Thor, hoping he’ll fill it automatically.
“Sergeant Barnes, Dum-E asks if sir has created you,” J.A.R.V.I.S. suddenly asks, “because you have a metal arm as well.”
It's easy to acquire suitable clothing without leaving a trace - humans are careless with their possessions - and when he's dressed he lopes off with long strides. Time to lead his captors away and devise a plan.
The fools are easy to track. They think they're crafty, with their secret signs and elitist meetings under Hydra banners, but they're no match for James' skills. Never have been. But now he doesn't have to terminate some rival faction to further one of the power hungry sadists, now he can eliminate whomever he pleases.
"I can't even begin to fathom what you're trying to goad me into, or what your ploy is, other than to distract me. So I'm asking you once: do you know where Bucky is?"
"Please," he croaks, voice breaking as arousal floods him, and makes his dick twitch.
"Using your freaky super vision to look at the reflection of people's cards in the microwave,
Steve’s eyes widen and he wipes at the indicated cheek, only adding to the mess. He seems to realize when he spots the paint on his other hand and he hurriedly holds down both hands, a delightful blush on his cheeks.
“Penthouse, J,” Tony calls as he takes the first opportunity they get for relative privacy to grab Steve by the nape and pull him into a filthy kiss.
of them combined, as if he’s not had to grow up before he even had the chance to be a child.
He nods, not trusting his voice overcome with emotion as he is. Steve moves until he's covering Tony from head to thigh, and kisses every inch he can reach while he pushes his cock against Tony's. The first touch has him moaning against the skin on Tony's shoulder.
The tactical-genius and the genius-genius are two of the dumbest people James knows.
"Need something… used ta use Vaseline," he says, pulling back to see Tony's reaction to his old timey suggestion with a grin.
“We’re keeping him unconscious for the next twenty four hours miminum, but he’s stable, and should make a full recovery.”
Seeing Bucky's face after 288 years pulled open a valve and Steve is losing himself in the maelstrom.
Steve isn’t bothered at all and reaches out with his other hand to wipe batter from Tony’s other cheek. “Mmm, chilli chocolate.”
Steve is shirtless, jeans gaping open, chest rapidly rising and falling, face pinked, blue eyes glowing, and his hair has never been such a mess.
And James Barnes apparently has an unhealthy need to look out for Steven Grant Rogers, no matter his size.
, why should I help you just because he’s your friend? I mean, maybe he hurt me when he was here. How do you know he’s worth saving? What if he burnt the book that called him here? Does that mean he’s out there roaming around without a leash, hurting people?”
In the elevator, James tries to make sense of all the emotions warring within him. He's not here for himself. He's here to finally get Steven Grant Rogers and Anthony Edward Stark to kiss and be happy together forever. When they are, James can leave with a peaceful mind. There are always more Hydra bases to raze, Nazis to punch in the nose with his metal fist, and new flavours of KitKat to sample.
Nothing could've prepared Steve for that first wet touch on his dick, and he quickly squeezes the base of his cock to prevent himself from coming immediately.
"I need to know who summoned the Winter Soldier and why."
"Well away from them if we do it." If just waving causes his eardrums to explode Steve doesn't want to think about what opening another portal will do.
Iron Man and Thor will go ahead to get additional intel and send it back to J.A.R.V.I.S. who will project it on the quinjet so Nat and Steve can plan a course of action. Bruce will start filtering the other data, together with Iron Man and J.A.R.V.I.S. -- Steve keeps being in awe Tony can do all these things simultaneously and better than most people to boot -- and Hawkeye will get them there asap, while keeping in contact with agent Coulson. It's a system which runs better each time they are called upon, and now is no exception.
Steve tries to keep from squashing Tony with his weight when Tony pulls him closer. He balances his upper body on one hand, while stroking them together and rolling his hips in the same rhythm. Everything they do together feels better than what they did before.
say… what he said.
slaying Bucky. The idea of revealing Bucky's lifeless face when pulling off the muzzle to see what hideous creature hid underneath...
“Surprise me.”
Nat is a great opponent, her precision and planning an equal match for Tony’s, and soon they’re both slowing down, taking their time as they dare each other to go for the more precarious pieces. God, he’s missed chilling with her, maybe some one-on-one time is due soon.
A display of power will likely only aggravate the boy, but showing humility might help.
“You’re just sour you lost to Nat, aren’t you?” Clint nags and is rewarded with a middle finger by the now supine Thor, one of Tony’s greatest achievements: having taught Thor the repository of obscene gestures.
"I know."
It’s not even close to full mast for Steve but it’s more than flattering for Tony.
happened in Budapest," Bruce chuckles, waving his Radler bottle at Clint.
"Yes," Steve answers, voice thick with emotion. He can't look at Tony, so he keeps his eyes on his hands on his thighs.
S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are maintaining a perimeter when they arrive, while Thor and Iron Man do their best to lure what appear to be giant cubes of green jell-o away from habitation.
