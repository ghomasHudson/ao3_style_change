And he knew exactly what sorts of ties he could buy Phil and see them on his lover on the SHIELD base weeks later. Sometimes when he felt daring he would wrap his hand in said tie, seeking a quick kiss in a quiet hallway.
The kitten pressed into his hands, mewing again.  Steve smiled, "We've all got room for it, really.  It shouldn't be a problem, should it, Jarvis?"  He glanced at the ceiling.
A short while later, Bruce set a plate with a simple chicken quesadilla down next to Clint, lowering himself down to sit on the floor nearby. His gaze moved to the pile of ties, categorizing the colors absently as he debated whether to say anything or wait for Clint to feel like speaking.
"Huh, interesting,” Bruce kept his tone neutral, but he watched Tony and glanced briefly at the cuddling fondue sets, "Are you going to keep staring at them or are you planning to give them some privacy?"
"What's the less part?" she asked, stepping closer to him to avoid a pile of snow that a plow had kicked onto the sidewalk during the last track down the street.
Steve emerged a few minutes later, his own gift for Clint stashed in the bag from the previous store.  He paused next to the other, "The frame store?"
Her lips quirked upward very slightly before her expression returned to neutral, "I've never been any good at that, no.  Do you want meaningless comfort, though, Clint?"
Rhodey sat down, almost on top of Tony, to open the remote controlled airplane. He gave Tony a distinctly unimpressed look. "You said I owed you a plane, honey bear," Tony said.
“Yeah but I wasn’t naked a few minutes ago,” Tony said, trying to curl his entire body against Steve, tilting his neck back.
"Thank you," he said, ducking his head down and starting to feel some of the panic and rage subside. "That, it means a lot, okay?"
Steve smiled at that, "That's real thoughtful.  And you know we'll help you when you need it, like you said, teammates."
Bruce felt his face heat at that thought as he made his way over to settle in one of the chairs and Natasha's lips curled upward into a smirk. Clint flipped her off as Thor bustled around, happily handing out gifts to where everyone had established themselves, leaving his pile next to Jane.
It only took several more weeks for the floor remodels to finish and for the team to move in, though Thor still hadn't returned from Asgard to claim his own. The only other member still missing was Steve, though he at least had had the decency to call ahead to tell Tony when he was expecting to be back in New York.
For a long moment Tony just stared at him. “Damn,” he said finally. “That—Thank you,” he settled for.
“It’s my standby,” Tony said. “But Steve? I am sorry you lost him, and everyone else. But on this sorta awful day I also want to remind you how happy I am that you’re here.”
The kitten started purring even as it sniffed at the tuna and started eating finally.  Steve breathed a soft sigh of relief at that, "I'll take it to the vet tomorrow, and see about getting supplies for it too."
Steve considered a rack of origami books and picked one up for Bruce before following Clint toward the puzzles, "I can't believe we all forgot about this."
Bruce tensed at that and crossed the room to stand near the stairs, ready to retreat if he felt himself slip any further.
"It's not a plot. It's concern. Your AI is so advanced he feels concern. So we make sure that we both know what there might be to be concerned about so we can head it off," Pepper explained, sounding like she'd done so before.
"There have been forward steps, but there have been retreats as well.  They'll either kill each other or find a mutually beneficial partnership."
"Well, you walked away this time. So did Tony," Bruce shook his head, sensing a rumbling in the back of his mind, "And you're both damn lucky."
Several evenings later, after a super villain had gone through Manhattan in a craze of world domination lust, Clint stared down a bowl of cereal. His shoulders ached and he had a lovely new set of bruises and a sparkling new vendetta against all super villains.
"Then release me," Loki grit out.  "For if you do not, I'll see if I can't make this next wound last longer."
Loki narrowed his eyes at him before he shook his head, laughing. “You cannot change the whole world to suit your moods.”
Turning to look at the boxes again Clint bit back any response he wanted to give. "Sure, if you feel like giving it."
"Alex and I get along fine, thank you much," Charles responded, which was a lie.  "And Emma, can be a charming woman when she wants to be."
That earned a huff of laughter as Bruce set the kettle on to boil, "I think there's a ground rule that Lehnsherr doesn't get to be near most of this city much less your AIs."
"It is not my cat," Tony protested. "But if it's going to be here, it will have the best damn cat bed to exist and shut up. Just be quiet."
"What sort of footage?" Rhodey asked, leaning his elbows on his knees and Tony's posture only got stiffer.
"I think it has more to do with the hang over," Clint replied. "Drink your juice and then go at the coffee, alright?"
Fury gave him a long look before shrugging. "There always is. That's what the paperwork is for you know."
Rhodey gave Tony another fondly exhausted look before leaving the room as well, sitting back down next to Pepper and leveling Steve with a look across the room. Noticing it, Thor almost stepped between them but decided to allow Rhodey whatever he wanted to say. Steve looked up, catching Rhodey's look and pausing, "Yes, sir?"
"You'd have to take out an heir of a realm containing people that were considered gods," Bruce reminded quietly.
"The past makes the present what it is, whether you're looking to the future or not," Steve replied, frowning and coming a bit further into the shop.  "I'm not saying dwell there, but don't dismiss it either."
Natasha nodded very slightly, rising and slipping into the kitchen while Clint got the movie set. Steve glanced around at the team, tilting his head back enough to look at Tony and offering him a crooked grin before turning his attention back to the television.
"Good," Tony said, stepping forward and trying not to consider how domestic this entire thing felt, hanging sparkly snowflakes on a tree covered in garlands because it was so pathetic, and that wasn’t even mentioning the lights.
Bruce drew a deep breath and let it out, "Steve, think, a person doesn't carve a cavity like that in their chest for that sort of reason."
Making a soft sound in the back of his throat, Bruce leaned into the kiss, feeling a stirring in the back of his mind that felt alarmingly protective. Licking his way inside Bruce's mouth, Clint let out a huff of laughter and pulled back. "You still taste like pancakes."
Tony hummed, abruptly turning away, moving further into the floor, opening the door to the studio he’d had designed. “Here you go. Made sure it has the amenities it needed. Howard’s grave is in California anyway, it’s a bit further than Arlington.”
"The thing about the picket fence, Clint?  You get two people fighting for it and who knows, it could happen."
"Well it seems like a really stupid place to be, with an angry as hell god of thunder hanging around while looking for you." Tony paused a beat. "Except your ass has not been dragged back to Asgard."
“That does seem to be what you are insisting,” Loki said, but his voice was a bit smaller than usual.
Loki arched a sharp eyebrow at that, "Which would imply that I've seen anyone from your team except you since the last time we spoke."
Finally shaking his head slightly, Tony turned to the group on the couch. "I'll see you in the morning," he said and took off for his lab.
"And you've been sniping at each other ever since.  You confuse me, Tony, but I don't think it's a bad thing." Steve paused, realizing Tony mentioned he had been drunk then and very carefully decided not to ask about that.
“’m fine,” Clint managed, rubbing a hand over his eyes. “I’ll finish the popcorn even. Go watch Star Wars again.”
Steve stepped off the elevator almost three hours later than he'd said he'd be there. He looked subdued from his trip and apologetic for his tardiness, "Sorry, more traffic now than I was expecting."
"Yeah, yeah," Tony waved a hand. "Anyway, perhaps it's time to settle down with someone good and maybe he doesn't have to be a spit and polished icon either."
“You look like you have something to say,” Bruce said when Clint just continued to sit there. They had, technically, been dating for a while, but just as often as he was around, Clint seemed to vanish. Bruce didn’t push because Clint had only promised to try originally, not that they would actually succeed.
Loki grimaced, seeing stars briefly before lashing out, slamming his fist into Thor's gut as he snarled, "There is no redemption available to me, and I
Clint managed for once not to say what he thought of that originally. "Well, at least she had some experience yeah?"
Clint groaned before draping himself over Steve’s shoulders. “At least you have an excuse,” he said before Tony dragged him off. Straightening, Clint shrugged. “Okay, there’s one more. Come on Steve, I’m educating every sorry sucker in this tower on what they’re missing.”
The corner of Tony’s mouth twitched and he shook his head, glancing down at the fondue sets he held in his hands. “It—it doesn’t mean anything,” he said. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really will just go.”
"Well, the papers will need something short and quick to use if they're talking about the battle," Steve answered, taking another drink of his coffee and Tony's eyes had flickered back to him at some point.
“Are you really going to tell Natasha her significant other isn’t allowed to come?” Steve asked, his other brow going up.
"There's some benefits that come with this body," Steve allowed, stepping out of the bathroom and into Tony's bedroom.
"She was involved on that one?"  Bruce's brown eyes moved to look at Clint again, hesitance in his expression.
She smiled faintly at that, "I don't need that PR nightmare; stay on speaking terms with the head of the secret government organization, Tony." Pepper glanced at the other three men, "Only two of you look hung-over so that's better than it could be."
The blond offered him a bit of a smile, “Well, in that case, I...Thank you, Tony.  This, it means a lot to, well, to have a place to come back to.”
“Clint says there’s more than one type and that I’m uneducated regarding that," Bruce said and shrugged, “Basically he’s trying to figure out what movie he wants to watch to relax after the fight today and has decided it should be a communal event.”
“God-Goddamnit,” Tony said, hands rising to accept Steve back against him, kissing him deeply, filthy. “Please, please don’t be one of those people who wants flowers and candle light before you fuck me.”
"FUBAR?" Rhodey blinked and then grinned. "Right, army in World War Two." He shrugged. "Yeah, well, it's Tony so SNAFU. But yeah, I found him in the desert and Stane was pretty unhappy his whole power taking move didn't work but Tony delivered something new and interesting to him. Meanwhile, Tony worked on a better suit, and while I haven't seen the footage I'm sure exists, I heard some horror stories from Pepper—and I know he crash landed on his piano and one of his cars. So he did that, flew into my active war zone and almost got taken out as an unknown boogey, and then Stane walked into his house and tore the arc reactor out. The guy he trusted since he was a kid pinned him and tore the thing keeping him alive out." Rhodey's eyes were harsh as he watched Steve, making sure he understood that.
"Oh good," Clint said, setting his bow down carefully and coming more fully into the residential area of the tower.
"No," was all Tony said, turning around and heading for the trash can without really thinking about it.
"Good," Tony said, nod firm and hoping that Clint wouldn't emerge from the gym looking to drink again. It had been bad enough watching him the first time.
"I'm very curious, but it's also a high-tension situation."  Bruce shrugged, "I'm not sure there are any questions that would get an explanation, though.  Not through direct means at least."
“After all our centuries together, and you still understand so little,” Thor said. “Why are you jealous?”
"Let's do the movie store first," Steve resolved, side-stepping a particularly harried looking shopper.
"Eh, the longer that gets held off, the better," Tony said, turning the glass in front of him around several tips before knocking the rest of it back. "Because I'd like to enjoy basking in the whole glowy part of the relationship."
does not want to share?” Loki asked, as if he had found the true weakness to Thor’s argument. “You wouldn’t do that to her, would you?”
"That makes you sound sortta like a petulant child, cap," Clint said, finally turning back to hanging lights. About that time they heard a muffled yelp, and something like Tony swearing.
Bruce's lips quirked upward, "So Thor and I will find a Yule log, Natasha volunteered herself and Tony for garlands and decorations and Steve's said he'll find a tree."
For a moment Thor didn't reply, looking around the streets around them. "It is like a legend that would be a dream to you people. We use magic instead of science but it is the same thing. There's more... pomp in the capital, but vast places of ice and darkness too. There is war and there is also hope. I don't know... I wouldn't know where to begin to explain it."
"He killed Phil," Clint said, smaller. "He took my mind away from me and Stark thinks he knows what he's having drinks with."
“Playing on my sentiment?” Thor asked, and he couldn’t quite help the bitterness that inched into his voice. That caused Loki to look at him, something like fear in his eyes for a second before he hid it again. “Is that what you are doing?”
"It is.  Do we have anything I can feed it?"  Steve continued rifling through the cabinets.  "I'll be able to go get actual food for it tomorrow, but it'll need something before then."
Bruce snorted at that, shaking his head. Steve's brows rose slightly at that, but he shrugged, “Well, I guess since we're all staying here, you'll have the chance to run it by us.”
Bruce's grip tightened ever so slightly at that, drawing a deep breath at the near growl from that same corner that rose with a surge of protectiveness at Clint's tone, "He's not going to touch you again. Not if we can help it."
"No worries, why are you even apologizing anyway?" Tony said from behind the couch where he was lying on the floor on his back, working on a tablet. "No one was waiting up, it's cool."
"I need more than one perspective you know," Fury snorted. "Besides, Clint won't be making a report after that. In fact, I assume he's at Stark's right now finding all the alcohol."
"And so long as they remain that way I won't be in a position where I have to make that choice."  She rose gracefully, leaning her hands on his desk, "The fact that I'm here at all, should tell you something.  I'm here, I'm still your agent." There was the hint of a "for now" in her tone, but it was fleeting and uncertain.
"Just telegraph my moves in advance, yeah?" Clint offered, still shifting forward until he hesitantly brought his hands up to Bruce's face, fingertips on his cheekbones.
"Steve said Howard was a nice guy last night," Clint said from where he was making scrambled eggs. Rhodey blinked, anger clearly in his shoulders as Tony looked over at Clint and Bruce.
"I believe there should be something in the left lower cupboard," Jarvis said. "And I am certain you could take some towels to make a bed for tonight."
Clint, rather than actually speak to her just nodded as Tony settled behind Steve, staring a moment at the blond head in front of him and regretting his seat choice.
“Because Natasha asked for him to come and we all agreed,” Clint said, sitting on the bar that ran around the living room.
"Traitor," Tony muttered vaguely to the room before looking at Steve. "What can I help you with? Any disasters we need to suit up for?"
Steve entered as Clint spoke, like he had been summoned on cue. "So we fix that.  The stores still aren't closed.  We might be able to manage a Christmas."
Steve nodded, picking up the star and placing it on the top of the tree, "Been a while since I was able to decorate one of these."
Steve looked briefly stung by that, but quickly set that aside, "Right.  Alright.  I'll let you get back to work."
"Well, I mean, all it takes is watching them.  And I don't mean during battle.  Because with the way the media's taken a love-hate relationship with you all everyone sees them during battle.  It's the small things, like the coffee and hot chocolate this morning, like how Natasha managed to give you all socks, but personalize even what's a really...boring gift, or like how Clint acts to diffuse tension when he can."
"What about it?" Tony asked, flicking a hand and dragging the design from the table up in front of him.
Crossing the roof and pausing a couple of feet back he finally drew himself together enough until he was sitting next to Clint, "Bit cold up here."
Eyes widening, Tony let out a breath of shock and relief and spread his arms out. “Yeah, yeah, I could—we could do that.”
Tony frowned at him. "The last thing I have ever needed was someone's pity and I am not a goddamn puzzle."
"Why are you here with him, sir?" Clint asked, snapping into a formal address he would never use on Tony if he was calmer. "Why haven't you called us, or, you know, shot him in the throat?”
“You did,” Thor said. “And there are things I am not ready to forgive you for yet. But,” and he sighed, rubbing a hand over his forehead. “I will not turn you away in a moment of weakness either.”
Clint paced for a few moments before stilling. "The Hulk may—I don’t know what the fuck the Hulk is thinking but he might be in love with me. Or—or something."
"Doesn't matter," Tony replied. "I'll find a way. I'm good at finding ways and you, my friend, will end up drunk. As a fish. Swimming in a sea of vodka."
"Two delightfully cognizant and entirely useless fondue sets," Charles responded, turning his attention away from the phone again briefly. "Kitty would you please make sure the younger students are out of the kitchen for the next few hours?" He returned to the phone as the girl went to take care of that, "Now, if you wouldn't mind coming and fetching them back, they should behave now."
"Well," he paused, trying to remember what he knew of Steve's childhood. "I guess it will do," he huffed, pulling a box of ornaments closer and considering the selection.
"I'm just trying to align my memories with what that implies," Steve hedged, watching Tony's posture shift.
Clint considered him from across the room before shrugging and taking another drink. "You wouldn't have any reason to think I needed to be told now would you?"
"I highly doubt they would come close to touching Thor's lifespan.  He would have to watch them grow old and die, just as he watched their mother."
Loki's lips drew back in a snarl, "Curse you and may you rot in Hel's house when death comes for you."
"I would guess that means they had the chance to do so before?" Bruce asked, shaking his head very slightly.
Eyes narrowing in consideration, Clint tilted his head to one side but he didn’t say anything about Bruce referencing the Other Guy. "I can get myself in pretty far."
Steve slid his arms under the pillow, crossing them and letting his head rest on the pillow, "You know? I'm okay with that. The surprises."
“Alright,” Clint said, arms still around his knee. “How much do you and the Other Guy ever communicate with each other?”
“Sure, sure,” Tony said, flailing an arm out and eventually getting the strawberries onto one of the nightstands before he settled down in the circle of Steve’s arm. “Was it that?” he asked, voice low again.
Steve paused, finally shifting under Tony to turn over and face him, careful not to knock the other man off and wrapping his hands around his waist. “You say that like it could be a bad thing."
Tony muttered something that sounded dark at the cup as Clint blinked at him and over to Steve. "You missed that didn’t you?" he asked, glancing at Bruce as well.
Her lips quirked upward, "Well, if you want to put in a floor for me. I'll keep the apartment too, though. I need my own space, Tony."
"Which means something that we can all enjoy, or at least partake in," she followed his gaze.  "You could always upgrade it later," Natasha could not believe those words had come out of her mouth and she was certain she was going to regret them later.
"Not that I like.  I haven't worked with paints of that quality ever, and I haven't had the chance to work with paints at all since well, since this," he gestured to himself.  "I have a couple of sketches, but they're just that—sketches."
For a moment, that’s all it was. Their mouths pressed together in the faint light, neither moving more than that. Then Loki caught up with what was happening, wrapping his hands in Thor’s hair and holding on, Thor’s hands carefully holding his waist.
"Just that I can do dishes on my own.  If you want to help finish them up you can, but I'm releasing you of the obligation."
“I haven’t spoken to him since handing in my report on the Chitauri,” she answered, crossing her arms over her chest and focusing her gaze across the kitchen.
“We’re not actually feeding an army, are we? Are there any more surprise guests coming?” Tony asked, looking around the room like maybe half of SHIELD was hiding in Nick’s coat.
"Maybe it's not a bad thing.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe we will keep in touch if we're just friends," Betty offered.
Clint had meant to slink past the living room, except the flash of Natasha's hair stopped him. "You didn't come home last night," he said, forcing his voice to be light. "Make up with Nick?"
Tony watched her go, chin propped in the palm of one hand. "Think we should take food up to the Asgardians?" he asked mildly.
She nibbled at the peanuts, holding the bag between them so he could sample them as well as the mood took him, "I don't know if we've ever really been lovers. I mean, we've tried it. And I think there were times where we could have come close, but I don't think we got there. We're friends. Recently with wonderful benefits, but I don't know if lovers is the right term, you're right."
"I think I might be able to find something for Natasha here.  The other two gifts probably won't be at a bookstore," Bruce answered, considering the store at large.
"You're still here then," Tony said, looking up as Loki slid into the seat across from him. "And I was so sure you were skipping town."
"I'll see what I can find," Steve said, letting his eyes move from storefront to storefront, trying to see if anything jumped out at him for their teammates.
Pepper tilted her head at it, "Soothing colors, or muted enough to qualify, not busy, cool underfoot." She nodded, "I think it could work."
Bruce saw Tony pause and turned his attention to the other, tensing as well when he caught sight of the ornament.  He carefully set the lights down and took a couple of deep breaths.
Natasha made an exasperated sound before getting to her feet and disappearing into the kitchen, scooping up the kitten from where it had appeared at the foot of the stairs as she went. The kitten made a sound of protest at being dragged away from the wrapping paper littering the ground. "Howard Stark was a bastard," Rhodey said and suddenly Tony appeared back in the doorway, as if called by his father's name.
"And so far they keep working out," Steve responded simply.  "I can be a stubborn son of a bitch when there's something I care about or want, and you, Tony Stark, are both.  You're not getting rid of me."
"So what, you're going to just decide things because you're scared?" Clint snapped and drew back, realizing he was projecting his own issues. "I'm sorry. I should... I should not talk anymore."
"What if I don't want to?" she asked, but it sounded more like she was offering it academically than with any force behind it.
"At this point?  Not if you ask the way you seem to ask everything else about him," Bruce answered.  "Both of you need to cool off, and maybe not bring up weapon construction."
"Uh-huh," Tony said, leaning back and folding his hands over his chest as he kicked his legs out under the table. "Or you're still just making weird ass eyes at Thor."
"Or himself," Clint said. He hesitated for a second before looking over at Bruce. “How are you feeling, anyway?”
“You should have told me,” he said, still not looking up from where his arms were braced on the counter, eyes sliding over to the microwave when it let out a particularly loud pop.
Natasha picked up her purchases and some of the decorations, "Good, I'll leave as soon as we get back and go get her."
“Nothing,” Tony repeated. “Besides, I’m sure you don’t care about my dating schedule anyway,” he added, even if he just meant an interview date.
Clint shrugged. "Organizing, I guess. While Tony's working on those floor remodels I just needed space to spread out."
"Tony, you haven't given me a straight answer about anything short of which floor I was going to live on since I got here," Steve was pretty sure that was an exaggeration, but he had been avoiding keeping track of how often Tony dodged a question when it was put to him.
Stashing his bow quickly Clint paused long enough to hit the wall before vaulting down to the next nearest rooftop. He had missed his one good chance.
Clint was so focused on Bruce opening his gift he only made a vague sound of acknowledgement, the glasses she bought perched on his head as Thor made happy sounds about every present. Jane watched the others over the top of the Asgardian study of the stars she was reading, a new gold bracelet gracing her wrist.
Jane laughed, shaking her head, "No, really, they are, I mean Agent Romanov flew all the way out to New Mexico to pick me up last night.  And no matter what the conflict was during decorating, they still all gathered around for this morning. So, yeah, I'd say they're good people."
"So your brutal honesty and delivery makes everyone around you think you hate each other," Steve clarified.
“Odin’s eye, you sound like Fandral.  Of course, you at least have photographic evidence that you’ve performed some of these feats,” Loki set his empty glass aside.
“You know, those chips,” Tony said, fingers digging into his shoulders. “Like, up here you're so broad and down here,” and he ran his hands down to Steve's waist, wrapping his arms around it. “You're shaped like a Dorito.”
"And god knows you're the least open book to walk around," Clint added and ignored the look Tony gave him through the shades. "What? You are. You don't like talking about yourself, I get it, but Fury—for some reason—gave Steve your redacted file. The one without Afghanistan or the arc reactor, er," and he paused for a second at Tony's look. "Poisoning incident."
"Still trying to get used to that," Clint muttered, curling up against Natasha where he could feel her heartbeat.
"I was under the impression you didn't like kittens," Natasha replied, leaning a hip against the table, only sparing Tony a brief glance.
"I just wanted to tell you I wouldn't stand in the way, and it would be good to have the team together, if we're going to be a team. I missed out on all the early team building exercises," he added with a bitter twist of his mouth. "So come if you like," Clint added, finally looking over at her. "But I haven't forgiven you. Drop me off where you like."
“I’m sure Fury is not going to insult our cat,” Steve said and Tony gave him a disbelieving look. “But alright, if he does, you can fight him then.”
Bruce looked up from his book as the elevator doors opened.  He pulled his reading glasses off and rose when he caught sight of both Tony and Clint, "Is everything—"
"Oh for the love of—This isn't either of those things," Steve responded.  "There were things that I was told that I took at face value that I shouldn't have. And I'm sorry for doing that."
"No, no I like it," Bruce answered, shaking his head in bemusement as he opened Clint's gift.  The kid's chemistry set he was suddenly holding startled a laugh out of him.
"Yeah, but seriously, don't go after Logan, he's cut your face into pieces. Actually," he paused. "Damn that would be funny. Please go try and seduce Logan. Take video."
"I am fine," he said with a tired smile. "Come, I should show you the city. Or at least introduce you to Samuel if Clint would let him go."
"For you maybe," Steve answered. "Me? I'm beat. I hear this rumor there's a room for me around here somewhere?"
"They're nice enough to look at, at least," Steve offered, frowning at the three different tree toppers that he'd found.
“Though only the good ones,” Clint said, pointing the DVD case at Steve. “Too many movies rely on the tech now, instead of good storytelling. But I’ll be sure you get a really good taste of what films can do nowadays. But first, the theatrical cut of the Empire Strikes Back.”
"I still can't believe we all managed to forget about it," Bruce murmured, pushing himself to his feet.
Steve followed behind him, "I don't, I don't know.  Everything I think of seems inadequate or entirely meaningless.  I mean what do you get for a genius billionaire?"
Tony tensed, eyes darting around Steve’s face before nodding. Steve glanced at him again, before heading to the kitchen and starting the coffee. Stopping in the doorway, Tony looked over his shoulder before back to Steve. "So how will you react when the tabloids find out?"
There was something Tony felt like he wanted to say, but he forgot with the heat of Steve’s hands so close. "Uh," he managed before giving up. He wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, pulling him down to kiss him. Steve's lips parted and he licked his way into Tony's mouth, yanking the smaller man flush against him.
“Well that’s impressive,” Tony said and he paused a moment, one of Steve’s arms still loose around his waist. “So you know this whole dating for a year thing—”
"You were in an active military zone!" Rhodey said. "Without telling me that oh by the way I created a suit that allows me to fly around the world and I'm gonna take out a terrorist cell in a revenge scheme while you have no go ahead in the area."
"It's what we could find," Steve responded, already unpacking the garlands and laying them out near the tree as he considered how best to fill in the gaps in the branches.
"I think Stark is incapable of building something without AI," Clint muttered, catching Samuel up in his arms.
Steve lowered the towel to dry his torso, seeming focused on that, but watching Tony through the fogged up mirror, swallowing hard. "You've got quite the way with words."
“That may be preemptive anyway,” Clint said, walking past and an armful of presents. “The morning is young yet.”
"New York is nice," Darcy said, craning her neck back to look at the ceiling. "Good to see you still are all muscular like," she added, hitting Thor on the arm and starting to poke around Tony's bar.
Strolling along the streets a few blocks away from Avenger's Tower, an illusion cast around him to make himself shorter, his hair lighter, and his features softer, Loki paused to consider the headline in the paper, regarding an attack by one of the Fantastic Four's foes that had taken out a cafe a mile and a half from where he stood.  He knew he should be actually hiding, rather than out where he required his still depleted magic reserves to conceal himself.  And he certainly should be far away from the locus of his defeat, but he was curious as to how long he would manage to avoid capture.
"We'll make sure to name it something more substantial later," Natasha said, having none of Clint's arguments.
"That was not intended as negativity," Loki said, lips curling upward.  "I will genuinely enjoy seeing what they say and how you two respond."
Steve turned in that direction, but Bruce shook his head at him, "Thor's with him, whatever it is I'm sure they're fine."
"He told a live press conference that his father never told him he loved him," Clint offered. "I suggest you start watching those. He said some crazy shit the pundits pretended wasn't true."
“He wouldn’t be strong enough yet,” he replied. “And I am not ready for the search yet. First thing tomorrow we will set out, or I shall with any who wish to accompany me.”
"Yeah, good night," Clint said, waving him off before looking over at Natasha. He hesitated, unsure if they should talk or continue their truce since Star Wars.
Loki Laufeyson’s lips quirked upward, “Well, I’m still recovering and I wasn’t expecting to see you here.”  He took a sip of his drink, shaking his head, “Though what you’re doing here peaks the smallest bit of my interest.”
"No," Clint said, turning on his heel and stomping down the street. "I think I am and then something like the holidays comes around."
"I'll know it when I see it," Steve said, trying to think what would go with the sketch he had in mind.  "Probably chrome."
"Yeah, but people make all kinds of assumptions off what they see anyway," Tony said, sardonic twist to his mouth.
Steve glanced at Tony from time to time, but kept most of his focus on the tree and trying to sort out his thoughts and guilt for having inflicted damage again without meaning to.
Pepper pointed at a particular oak flooring, "What about this for the central room?  I'd actually carpet the bedroom though I think."
“Okay if it has anything to do with Loki, I don’t want to know,” Clint decided, hopping down from the counter.
Steve looked at Thor and shrugged.  Bruce drew another steadying breath before nodding, "At least break it before throwing it out."
"Is there anything we need to work out yet?" he asked, putting his hands flat on the desk and pushing himself up.
"Which you would never in a thousand years report to me on anymore," Fury said, meticulously pulling the paper apart, mostly watching her. "I thought for sure someone would have snapped and tried to throw someone else off the balcony. It seems like a powder keg, all that ambition and daddy issues and alcohol."
Bruce considered disseminating and pretending that he had no idea what Tony was talking about, but knew that the other would keep asking until he figured it out, "We talked.  I kissed him."
Hands shoved into his pockets, Clint considered the trees. "Nope. Totally, hella depressing. There is no other word for this."
"Is there a reason you blush at the word fondue?" Clint asked as Tony frowned after Thor. "Or is that just a Tony thing?" he added under his breath since Tony was distracted.
Loki laughed derisively at that, the sound still echoing as he vanished. Thor punched the wall where his brother had stood and didn't even register the rain until he heard the mutters about weather reports that had promised only clear skies.
Bruce entered the kitchen, coming to an abrupt halt when he spotted the fondue sets, but recovering quickly and speaking to Tony, "Didn't expect to see you in here."
at Samuel before scratching his chin.  Even Natasha seemed thrown by that for a moment before she came up to twine her arm through Nick’s, glancing between him and Samuel who was thrilled with the attention.
"It must be nice," Clint said after a moment, hand clenching and unclenching. "To know you once smashed him into the ground."
Shaking his head again but laughing, Steve went back into his arms and they stood there, long after they should have broken apart.
"Could see if Miss Potts would answer that question.  She usually can explain quirks if they've got to do with Tony," Bruce said, moving the pancakes onto a plate and offering it to Clint.
Rhodey looked between the three of them and seemed to catch on. "I assume Steve would be out of that group then?" he said and Clint shrugged.
"Well," Thor laughed, tilting his head back to the sky. "Perhaps they will learn to fight together and slowly work backward."
"There isn't really one," she replied, biting her lower lip.  "I think most people who know he's here are more worried about what happens when he's done licking his wounds."
Jane, wrapped up in a bulky sweater and sweat pants, perched on the couch with her mug of hot chocolate, "And a robe fits the holiday traditions."
"Then I hope for all our sakes it's a productive mess," Fury said, still watching her. "But we don't really want to talk about their issues, do we?"
“Tony, it doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen Star Wars, it’s Star Wars and always worth a rewatch,” Clint declared, pushing him from the lab toward the elevator.
The scientist rolled his shoulder slightly, “Well, the evening seems to be improving. It’ll go better once I’ve got some tea I think. Maybe sit down with some treatises.”
“I actually think they made their peace with each other a little while ago,” Steve said and Tony blinked. “No, honestly, I think they did.”
"I have not yet begun to whine about this to you," Charles replied, falling into step with the other man.  "I could if you would like.  I can go on for an hour alone about how my voice doesn't sound right."
Having just picked up the kitten, Clint grinned over at Bruce. "We have a kitten," he said, looking happier than he had since the Tesseract started giving off strange energy surges.
Steve huffed a breath against Tony's skin at that, "Gorgeous," a kiss on his throat, "generous," one on his jaw, "and the most brilliant man I've ever had the pleasure to meet," and a slow drag of their mouths together.
She considered and finally nodded, "I think we can see about it, yes.  We all have our assignments then."
"Look, I only dealt with Tony when it came to his contract with the army, when it came to that side of things," Rhodey said, spreading his hands. "I never figured it all out, like if they were sleeping together or if Stane's eyes were just that creepy, or how they split stuff up but I know Stane was part of the board and they talked a lot and Tony generally didn't move without Stane's permission—except when he did. So, there was Stane, there was Tony, and Stane paid some terrorists to take Tony out, only they cottoned on to who he was and decided to ask him to build weapons for them instead." He paused, breathing. "He was held in a cave out in the desert, made the arc reactor out of scraps and his own weapons that had been illegally sold to them, built the Iron Man suit and exploded the whole base, which is how I finally found the moron when he crash landed."
"Well he didn't stay that way," Rhodey said and shook his head. "At least, not in private. This is where Stane comes in. The man was a creep in ways I could never explain but he was there when Tony was a kid when Howard wasn't—or when Howard was being an ass. When Howard and Maria died, Stane took control of the company until Tony was done with trying to destroy his liver and old enough to take over. Look, I never got their relationship, but they were close as hell in a familial, vaguely wrong way." He cringed, never having liked the way Obadiah Stane had leaned over Tony, or the way Tony would tease him about pajamas or laugh when Stane got too close.
"My reasons seem perfectly valid from last night, when you agreed with them," Tony said. "And they haven't changed much."
"You haven't had any luck trying to find him?" Jane glanced up at him again, before turning her gaze back to watching where her feet were landing.
“I have been standing here a very long time, okay,” Tony started but shut up when Steve leaned down, kissing him thoroughly in the kitchen.
"Well, people say flattery will get you everywhere," Victor said, setting his suitcase on the ground. "Including out of the country."
Loki's lips curled upward and he tried not to think about blond hair and blue eyes, "Well, obviously it has to be someone who could keep up with our stamina."
"You are actually supposed to kiss," Clint added. Tony was obviously glaring at him before he shrugged, turning and leaning up, clearly intending to just brush his mouth against Steve's cheek.
"I mean, if we actually talk are we going to slip out of this truce we've set up?" Natasha asked calmly.  "We need to talk, but should it wait until after Christmas?"
"Yes," Thor grinned. "I believed, rightly it seems, that there would be some point of the year in which gifts were exchanged and I wished to be prepared. You are, after all, my team mates and have helped me with my brother."
"You have, yes. It doesn't change the fact that your idol is living in your home now," Pepper replied. She pointed to a particular pattern of tile, "What about this one?"
“Well, then I suppose you’ll just have to show him what does,” Bruce remarked as they stepped off of the elevator.
Clint managed a faint laugh. "When Tony Stark wants something done it tends to get done. And Pepper organizes him, you know?"
"Clint's mostly avoiding the alcohol, Thor holds his like a god, Bruce doesn't drink, and Cap insists he can't get drunk," she shrugged, perching herself on the chair in front of his desk. "They decided to destroy a couple of Christmas ornaments and put the lid on the daddy issues problem there."
“Nope,” Tony said, shaking his head. “There’s really nothing more I can say to that.” He hesitated, wanting to offer more, understanding that Bruce had willingly agreed to let the Hulk out if he was in danger. “But—It does mean a lot.”
“What I assume is the usual way and buying things,” Tony said. “Except Thor. I don’t know if he actually bought any of the gifts in Asgard, but he came prepared.”
Before Loki could breathe again, Thor slammed him into the wall by his shoulders, the bricks underneath crumbling with the force of impact. "I would rather have my brother back," he said. "I would rather you use your time here for redemption but I know you will not and so we will keep chasing each other but
Steve slid the collar of Tony's shirt aside just enough so he could get access to his collarbone, "True, but not exactly an argument."
"More surveillance than there is here," she replied.  "I've quite a comfortable apartment.  And the team seems to be working together better by the day."
"They'd have cute kids," Tony continued, eyes sharp as he watched Loki. "Her eyes, his physique. How long would they live, do you think?"
"Not quite to the 'put on the suit' level," Bruce answered as he sat down in the chair nearest the couch.
"Or a semblance of them at least," Bruce answered where he was leaning against the wall, his curly hair still obviously tousled from bed.
“Alright, I’ll concede that point,” Tony said, backing out of the kitchen again. “Could someone remind me why Nick Fury is here?”
"Still," Clint said, shifting again and moving around slightly so he could approach Bruce from one side.
Finally managing to catch a breath enough to speak, Charles nodded, still grinning, "Your resentment is noted and ignored."
Bruce settled in one of the chairs slightly to the side of where the TV was, Steve sinking down on the floor in front of one end of the couch.  Natasha hesitated before sitting down on the couch, crossing her legs and watching the others silently for a moment, “Does anyone want me to see about getting popcorn?”
“Not by you,” Jane said. “By everything. I’m working on a paper, and an experiment, and you’re back and that’s—wonderful. It’s just hard. Flying between New Mexico and here.”
Except Tony's swearing got closer followed by a "Goddamnit put me down," right before Thor reappeared, actually carrying Tony back into the room.
“This year I brought enough for everyone,” Rhodey said. “And Tony, the plane better be real this year.”
Steve considered for a long moment, processing everything Fury had said and pausing at the word 'lover' before setting it aside and meeting the director's gaze, "No, sir, I don't. A man has the right to know that the person he thought he was coming home to isn't there anymore. He has a right to know that he's got to figure out something else to live for. He's got a right to know that his world's just been turned on its head. Vengeance or not, it can get the job done. From where I'm standing you just lost yourself a good agent because of that little bit of truth you left out. You've been in this game too long, Director Fury."
“I have to admit I didn’t realize that there was more than one kind,” Bruce said with a hint of a smile.
Thor beamed at her, hoping that exchanging gifts would bring the group closer together. He carefully focused on leaning against Jane's warmth instead of who he missed. As no one else seemed to be moving, Natasha shook her head and pulled Thor's gift closer, carefully opening the elegant box, her eyes lighting up as she withdrew the golden knife set.  She tested one against the pad of her thumb, smiling when she nearly cut herself, "Thor, these are magnificent."
“No one should ever listen to you,” Tony called over his shoulder, teasing again. “You give the worst advice and the worst example to follow.”
Bruce stepped further back from the edge, "Yeah, I just usually try to avoid doing it so spectacularly."
"Because it's a healthy idea to do so," Steve suggested, curling his hands around a mug of hot chocolate.
Bruce followed, “Tony, if I’m getting stuck with this, you can join in. He’s decided that it’s a team thing, so we might as well make the best of it.” He glanced from one teammate to the other, “How many times have each of you seen Star Wars then?”
“I haven’t,” Clint started and stilled. “Look, alright. This would be complicated enough to deal with under the best of circumstances. But sometimes, for all I said earlier, I’m not sure I’m ever going to be ready. To move on. To try something new. I thought—I thought but I don’t know. And then there’s this and the world is ending every other week and it’s just,” he seemed to curl up closer into himself, resting his chin on the top of his knee and meeting Bruce’s eyes. “There’s a lot I guess we should have been talking about a while ago.”
"Yeah, that's how Tony talks," Rhodey said. "You get used to it after a while. And it's not like you could pick an easier topic, like his dad or the time the arc reactor almost killed him."
"The casing will also come off without being broken, which means he can make as many upgrades to it as he likes," Bruce set the clock back down and picked up one of the still boxed ones.  "And that's the last of the gifts I need."  He went to pay, "We'll see about catching a cab to the lumber yard."
“Right,” Tony said, having been thinking of something entirely differently. “There’s a reason the ground rule is Lehnsherr doesn’t get to be near my machines.”
Pepper kissed his cheek lightly, "I am well aware. And you know I expect to vet anyone you actually plan to
Loki's magic made his spine tingle, he had finally put together in the bar when he stood over Loki and Tony, an ache deep in his chest where the scepter had stabbed him in the chest. Tilting his head up, he glanced at the sky and back down to the street, watching children buying ice cream and hot dogs and men in suits walking by with their bluetooth headsets.
Tony took a breath and let it out. "Well, Summers and you have a complicated relationship, as have you and all Summers. Especially with Frost hanging around."
Jane nodded very slightly, shifting the subject away again toward the breakthroughs in a few of the fields she kept up on—including research being done by Betty Ross which was admittedly out of her normal purview.  She kept up a steady stream of conversation as they continued their stroll through Manhattan's streets. Thor tried to focus all his attention on her, truly fascinated by the science and what she offered to explain to him, but he still could not shake the feeling that Loki had been standing there, watching them, even after they returned to Stark Tower.
Steve clearly remembered that fight himself, sinking further down and looking abashed.  Pepper glanced at him and arched an eyebrow, trying to figure out if she was actually going to ask before deciding not to, turning back to Tony.  "And then you flew a nuke into an alternate dimension. Really, Tony, we like you
"Maybe we just see about a regular everyday fondue set," Natasha suggested, leaning against the counter.
Loki's brow arched at that, "Yes, because everyone enjoys being told they made such an attractive mare that a giant's horse couldn't resist."
Tony squirmed underneath, wanting to cover the arc reactor because some days it still felt foreign and others it felt natural. With Steve looking at him it felt foreign. “I thought I said don’t.”
“Charles said someone sent them,” Tony said. “Just putting them back.” He hadn’t looked away or closed the cupboard yet.
"If you cannot see that," Thor said, voice dropping. "There is nothing I could say to you to change your mind because you would rather deny that I wish to love and protect you than accept it."
"No, I have no children. Considering what the tales make of the ones I supposedly have I'm glad of it."
"Delicate experiments and the like," Bruce responded with a shrug.  "Though I'm sure it's possible to find some source of excitement that doesn't involve acid."
“Jane is the only exception you get,” Loki said after he thought about it for a minute. “There will be no more later. And that is only if she agrees. I will not be a side bit to you for the next century.”
"Which is not saying much," Tony replied. "You know, I thought the media and stock holders were bad when it was just me. What part of heroic sacrifice to save Manhattan did they
to go back to bed,” Tony said with a easy grin and Steve found himself laughing and shaking his head before he leaned down, offering Tony a quick kiss.
Moving over to sit down at the table, Steve nodded, "It was honestly more what Clint said than what you just implied."
Grinning, he lifted her off her feet, turning in a circle before setting her down and kissing her gently. "I'm glad you came. I have gifts for Darcy and Selvig as well if they would like them but I am verily glad you came."
That earned him another crooked grin and a slight flush across Steve's cheekbones, "Probably a good idea not to have that happen in the kitchen anyhow."
"So am I.  Stark and Rogers seem to be heading toward their own truce," she paused briefly before actually leaning her hip against his desk.
"Yeah," Clint said and moved to hold his hands behind his back. Hesitating again, Bruce nodded and stepped away, heading down to his floor.
Tony tried to stifle his next laugh and ended up burying his face in the table. "Okay, okay. Well, I'm sure of all the mares you would be the sharpest, most lethally attractive of them all. With an attitude problem that would never get you laid, of course. But seriously, you have no kids?"
"Alright, I've got a couple of experiments I need to check on, anyhow," Bruce murmured, stepping into the stairs down to the main floors.
"I don't need those, but,” and Steve gave Tony a crooked grin, hooking one finger in Tony's shirt, between two of the buttons. “I do need you undressed to manage that.”
"Odin is tired and angry," Thor snapped back. "Do not even think about it, you have stabbed me quite enough for a while."
"Then I suppose we'll fight again," Thor said, sighing heavily and crossing his arms over his chest. "And we'll keep doing so if we must."
"Yeah, but the military icon of a past age sure hasn't," Clint said. "So what do you think? Totally secret gay lovers or is the mistletoe just magic?"
Tony considered before tapping another sample to bring it up, a light brown with a vaguely geometrical design around the edges in a faded purple color. "How about it?"
"The plane flew into you," Rhodey agreed finally. "In my military zone, without you telling me what the hell you were doing, after you took out a terrorist cell that was holding an entire town captive," he continued. "All of which you did without telling me a damn thing."
“My sexual escapades are very exciting, I’ll have you know,” Tony replied with a completely straight face, sipping at the fresh drink that was handed to him.
"I don't know," Thor said. "I'd rather know he wasn't causing more harm is all. Taking him to Asgard," he shrugged again. "It didn't work. I'm not certain we could hold him no matter what we did."
"I've had better days," he allowed. "But it's not so bad I'll go out and get myself killed." His eyes were sharp as he watched Bruce.
Clint took a breath and let it out. “He calls me Cupid. I think it was supposed to be derogatory except it’s not anymore. He even, um, brought me flowers from the botanical garden last week when we, you know, crashed into it. And through it. And out the other side.”
"I know it won't.  I've seen some of your texts, and I can tell you right now, I've never been married, nor do I have children, and I had no hand in Baldr’s death."
Rhodey shook his head. "This is apparently embrass Tony day with his bullshit hero complex which means Christmas really does produce miracles. Because let's not forget he did that fight with an arc reactor built from scraps."
"Have you ever had a latte?" Thor asked, looking over when Darcy flipped Jane off before heading toward the kitchen. "I have only recently tried one and quite found I enjoyed it. We should go and find some of those instead."
Clint groaned. “Oh my god, what is wrong with you? Documentaries are as bad as fucking treatises. Are you temperamentally incapable of relaxing or have you just forgotten how?”
Tony managed not to snap that Steve was really showing that opinion there, before shrugging and hefting up the gifts that he bought, heading right for the door.
“He has not tried to kill me since the arc reactor and suit,” Tony replied. “But, uh, I’m working on contingency plans if he decides to pick up the mantle of rebellion again.”
Fury considered him. "Yeah, you're not really suited spy work anyway. But you know what not to do? You don't send a man to save the world by telling him his lover is dead. Then it becomes a vengeance gig, not a saving the world gig. You don't agree with my methods, and that's fine."
"That you've got a habit of doing dangerous things and wondering if you have a plan halfway through them," Steve answered.
"Changing mine," Steve replied, sighing and shaking his head.  "It's not a quick or easy process.  But I'm trying."
Rhodey had just rolled his eyes. "Yeah, yeah, big man finding a new element and saving our sorry asses that wouldn't have needed saving if you weren't being such an ass." He paused, glancing at Pepper. "Which was that? The being in my military zone or the bit where he went after Stane alone with the old reactor?"
Steve entered from where he'd been out for his morning run and moved over to the coffee pot. He glanced toward Tony and Clint, hiding a bit of a smile, "You're up earlier than I expected."
"I'm not quite sure yet," Bruce replied.  "Perhaps we'll look for the Yule log and see if we come across something."  He turned back toward the front of the store, pausing when he saw a history of weaponry and considered it for a long moment before picking it up.
"I would have more actively avoided security if it was," she answered, the left corner of her lips twitching up.
There was the sound of a sharp throat clearing from the stairs, Steve's gaze sweeping over all three, "What was that?"
"Yeah, the instant you start expecting things from me you might want to stop," Tony said, setting the coffee aside with having barely drunk any of it before surging up to drag Steve closer and kiss him. Steve fumbled to set his own coffee cup down before letting his hands move to rest on Tony's hips as he pulled the other man closer and leaned down into the kiss.
"Ha, yeah, sure," Clint said. "I don't know if you've noticed yet, but I'm actually really good at walking myself into trouble."
"I was dying!" Tony protested from the doorway. "I'm not responsible for my actions when I'm dying!"
"First of all, the other guy comes out because of heart rate, right? You told me that," Clint said, still not looking up. "And secondly, fuck, how could I even try? A little while ago I actually tried to shop for him and realized I can't anymore."
"A couple?" Tony asked, propping himself up on his elbows and cocking his head at Steve. They hadn't talked much at all yet. "Which are...?"
Steve glanced up from where he was watching the kitten, "Because I found it shivering and starving in an alley.  It needed food and to warm up, it's really cold out there right now and going to get colder."
Tony's head snapped up when the elevator opened, certain that everyone was either in the tower or not due to be back anytime in the near future. For a second he thought about the time that Phil had invaded his tower, causing a security breach. He took a step forward before actually taking one back when the door opened to reveal Nick Fury. "You're joking. Breach, Jarvis, security breach and get out, Fury."
Fury's face was impassive as he held a check out. "There wasn't anyone else to really give this to," he said and Clint froze.
"What sorts of things?" Tony asked, turning his attention there as Clint busied himself with coffee.
"I'll do my best to avoid it," Bruce said, finally pushing away from the counter and leaving the room to find Clint.
"Sure," Rhodey shrugged. "Tony has a habit of walking feet first off the high places and only wondering if he has a plan halfway down. There are a thousand little events I could tell you about, dragging him out of clubs black out drunk, or mocking enemies who could smear him on the pavement. But I've told you enough, I think." His eyes were still hard. "And I swear to god, Captain America or no, I'm only telling you these things because you asked, because I saw the way he looked at you, and because he'd never answer himself and I really think you do care. But if you fuck this up? I don't care about your perfect smile or the fact I had a poster of you when I was a kid—I will find a way to break your teeth out of that mouth."
"You can't be—" Steve broke off, considering what he'd seen of Tony's reaction to Howard and he sighed, "Maybe I should."
Tony paused for a moment, glancing at Samuel before giving him another treat. “Alright, not really.”
"Not to mention we could have had the whole issue of 'Loki's on the loose' wrapped up weeks ago if you'd mentioned this."
Paling at that, Steve managed to keep his voice steady when he spoke again, "This has something to do with the mentions of terrorist cells, doesn't it?"
"And that's why I'm sorry," Clint said, folding his hands over his knees. "It's not easy and you shouldn't—" suddenly his head snapped around, like a bee had stung him. "But you're not even
"Oh, fine," Tony smirked. "But it would be so funny. Actually, who knows, little Wagner might teleport you into the tropics for pissing Logan off and that would also be funny as hell."
Clint lifted up the set of Captain America trading cards. "I'd been looking for these everywhere—" he started, flipping them back and forth as if it would change anything. Fury must have stuffed them in the bottom of the box, and suddenly Clint could understand why.
“After everything,” Thor said, still not turning around. “After hating me, and attacking me, and demanding that I despise you for all the ill you have done. Now you wish to play on my affection for you?”
"You did when you bought out the department store," Natasha supplied from where she was seated on the couch.
"You could always watch my back yourself," Fury said, turning the gun over again before setting it down. "Or is that over now too?"
Steve rose from the chair and held out his hand to Rhodey again, "Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes, if I mess this up, I sure as hell hope you'd do that."
"A few times," Loki shrugged dismissively.  "But no, no evidence I can offer to one such as yourself."
Sweeping into the first high class department store he found, Tony waved a hand at the first shopkeeper. "Hello, yes you. We'd like your entire stock of Christmas ornaments, if you would. And garlands, we need garlands."
"Damn it, that wasn't how I meant..."  He shook his head, drawing a breath, "I was wrong.  Top to bottom, start to finish, I've been wrong since I met you. I'm trying to understand, Tony, but I haven't, I haven't been trying enough. I guess I just realized that."
"If you need it, the other guy pretty much never has metal on him," Bruce said, casually, except for how tense he was holding himself.
"He was gone by then," Clint said. "More or less. I may have approached him first. You think I would have learned after the first time."
"Oh I've little doubt of that." She considered her fingernails for a moment, "Forgetting Christmas was an amusing story in and of itself."
“Only some of them,” Tony said, and finally took the doughnuts into the kitchen, where Nick Fury was standing with Natasha, seeming to have a staring contest of some sort. “Am I interrupting anything? Because please let me be, that would be great.”
“Um, none of your business and the whole laying low while recovering thing only works if you’re avoiding the people likely to a, attack you, or b, attempt to drag your sorry ass back to your rather large and well-meaning brother.”
"I don't think he's even given us tours and we live here," Steve said, still considering.  "I think I'm filing this under things I don't understand about Tony."
“Would you like one of those benefits to distract you?” Tony asked, still running his fingers through Steve’s hair.
Steve paused in the hall outside of Tony's workshop, checking the door and unsurprised to find it locked. He knew he had no code for the keypad next to it and glanced at the ceiling. It was a habit he had formed early in his stay in the tower and had yet to break for addressing Jarvis. "Jarvis?  Is there a chance you could let me in to talk to Tony?"
"Undercover, mostly monitoring and getting caught up in the aftermath," Clint shrugged. "I think she almost missed being Tony's PA after that one."
"It ran into me!" Tony protested. "After they stared firing on me, alright, and I admit I was in their military zone but he ran into me. And I saved him when his parachute wouldn't work."
For a while all he could focus on was the feel of Steve’s skin and the way Steve was way too good of a kisser for his image. The feel of Steve against him blew past any left over teenage fantasy he'd ever had, because what was real was always more overpowering.
"On and off," Tony said. "Before Christmas." He did not admit it had started the night Steve had found the kitten.
“That is rather tragic," Thor said, entirely meaning it. He crossed his arms, considering the streets around them, enjoying the sight of the lights around them, though he sighed when he realized he was still looking around every corner as if Loki would be there.
Look we started this story seven freaking years ago. It survived both phase 2 and most of phase 3 while pretending neither existed. I honestly just *punt kicks chapter up and then runs away*
"If you even think about saying thank you, the offer is rescinded," Tony ground out. "Just go take a shower."
"Right," Clint said, pointing the fork vaguely in his direction. "That was a fun debrief to read. I don't think Tasha ever wanted to go under cover again after that one, but Fury talked her around it to eventually."
“Guess we’ll have to see,” Tony said, scrambling out of bed and jumping into his clothes with practiced ease, running his hands through his hair and resting for a moment on his arc reactor before dropping them to his sides.
"It's still not exactly what I intended," Tony said and was trying as hard not to look at Clint and Bruce as he was Steve.
Never had there been so long a stretch of time without him in all of Thor’s thousand and five hundred years.
"Tony and Clint," Bruce answered, following Thor.  "I don't know what I'm getting them, and I'm hoping I will when I see it."
"From my own bomb," Tony said, not saying anything one way or the other about the terrorists. "Look, it's in the past, it doesn't matter."
His legs coming up to wrap around Steve’s waist, Tony cocked his head to one side. “Not comparable,” he decided, one hand skimming down Steve’s chest, just to feel it.
"You are so lucky I don't sleep in the nude," Tony shot back, hands curling around a coffee cup and inhaling the scent before focusing on actually drinking it.
We tend to toss in random Marvel characters instead of sticking only to the Avengers film, so be on the look out for cameos and various references.
Only he got the time wrong and Tony found himself jittery, moving up and down the place, sprawling over the couch before hitting the gym and swimming laps and sprawling over the couch again. He really hated waiting.
"I think the only reason I'm not smacking you upside the head is because despite my friendship with Tony, I do believe in military discipline."
Steve entered the office a few minutes later, thanking the private quietly as the man left and shut the door behind him.  He turned to Rhodey and held out his hand, "Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes."
Clint blinked and then rolled with the subject change. "Oh, we both slept with our superiors and on both counts it was a stupid move," he said, and braced his elbows on his knees. "But—but it was different. Because ... because you're fine with things, aren't you? You and Fury and sometimes you sleep together and you can be angry and do it again but in the end it doesn't matter how fucked up you are."
"I'm not actually sure that Tony has full control of the personality traits his AI's take on," Bruce admitted.  "Not that that's reassuring, but it might at least mean he didn't program it to fight off anyone who comes near it with a fondue fork."
Loki's eyebrow arched at that, "So you and the Captain, then, hm?  Paragon of American virtue with the darling of the American tabloids."
The receptionist frowned, certain that the man in question should be much older than the one standing there. Before he could call up, Tony came breezing in from the outside, stopping when he noticed who was standing there. "Oh, what're you doing here?" he demanded, wrinkling his nose from where he was carrying several packages of supplies he'd handpicked to make the kitten a bed.
Paying the man on the tree lot and letting him know they'd be back for the tree on their way back to the tower, Steve shook his head, "None at all.  You have any ideas?"
"And then he told me to blow the full-sized reactor with him still hanging above it rather than let Stane continue what he was planning," Pepper said, shaking her head.  "The number of times you could have
"You were thinking loudly and I still don't have a full grasp on my ability with the new brain,” Charles dismissed.
That earned a long-suffering sigh, "Well, I suppose if you're holding it over for that I can let it go.  It's a bit early anyway."
"Oh. Well that was smart," Tony said, finally looking back at him. "Did Fred manage to catch that action?"
"So, we'll need to take him to the vet, and get food and like a bed or something," Steve said, already making a battle plan.
Bruce fell still at those words for a moment and then nodded, managing a slightly strangled, "Good." Natasha looked between them before she left the kitchen, leaving them to whatever conversation they might have.
Steve tried not to look too pointedly at the still unwrapped present on Tony's knee, even as he too avoided the one from Tony for last.  Natasha, meanwhile had been making use of one of the knives from Thor to systematically slit the paper from the other gifts, lips curling up at the wood puzzle Clint got her.  She set it down to reach up and pat his knee in silent thanks.
"Does he mythologically have any?" Tony asked. "Say, can you guys have kids with mortals? What would that look like?"
"I'd toss it out the window except that might hit someone on the way down," he said and Thor frowned, looking at Steve in some confusion.
"No, I'm curious where he was going to go, actually," Tony said, setting the offending object on the counter and crossing his arms, shoulders squared back. It could either look like he was daring Steve to continue, or like a defensive gesture.
Because while each tie was dark and could almost pass as black, they were navy or dark green with geometric patterns and occasional flashes of color, expressing in each and every one of them how much Phil was not just your average black suit that took orders blindly.
Thor shook him again. "I would have you home, brother. And it is not only our father who sends you to the wilderlands it is yourself."
There were experiments she was working on late into the night and it did not bother him because when he saw her the next day she would greet him with a grin and babble happily about whatever it was she might discover—or what a glorious disaster it was that taught her something else invaluable.
Steve stared at him for a long moment, "Can you possibly at least not go to drinks with megalomaniacs and those bent on world domination?"
Charles caught a flicker of something else and his eyebrows rose, "Well, that seems to be the order of the day around there."
"Well you wouldn't hex me for sex jokes, I just don't know where the boundaries are," Tony said, totally idle as he finished his drink, setting the glass down.
"Comes from eating the same food," Clint said darting in for another quick kiss before moving back. "It's nice."
Thor stopped to look over his shoulder. "It is customary to give gifts this time of year," he replied. "As I have nothing else to give you," and he spread his hands out, leaving the statement there.
"You have never been an influence in my life," Tony protested. "I just had a lot of extra room. You know, as multi-billionaires do."
“Violently,” Tony said. “I seem to have finally discovered people with as many if not more daddy issues than myself. What a joy to discover.”
He'd already made the clerk pick out the ruby and silver flowered ring he'd spotted, the box sitting at his elbow before Natasha arrived, but he was having trouble figuring out which particular pair of earrings looked the most like Pepper's necklace.
"If it's a fake, I'll kill you," Victor said, plucking it from his hand. "But it's good you have something. After all, you've been fairly useless since returning to our world." He slid the apple up a sleeve, stashing it so quickly it was like he had never held it at all.
The transaction went quickly and Bruce slipped the box holding the spyglass into the bag from the bookstore, "We probably also ought to stop somewhere and get wrapping paper since I'm pretty sure no one else mentioned it."
Paling, Bruce's eyes narrowed and he drew a deep breath to calm himself, "Steve or Tony might have an answer. Thor and I were both....off the carrier by then."
"Except possibly Steve, though he kept blushing which is not something I want to poke with a stick."
Steve tucked the last of the lights in and stepped back, "Yeah, it's all set to hang ornaments on now."
"It's got my vote. It's better than Leland, your last attempt," Natasha said, perching on a chair.  "Clint's right though, what does this set do?"
"I believe Anthony likes new things, but he invents most of them himself," Thor said. "And for Clint, I am less sure. I know he keeps a distance."
“Yeah but he scares the shit out of them,” Tony said, stepping back. “Which okay he does for normal humans too but when you’re made entirely of metal it’s worse.”
He refused to add it took three hours to find. "Well, we need more... more team building activities."
"Just because it doesn't hurt doesn't mean you're forgetting him, or betraying him," Natasha murmured, resting her elbow on the back of the couch and resting her head on her hand.
Tony paused. "So something you wanted to do alone then? Any other graves you need to visit or are you good?” he asked.
Steve lifted his head, meeting Tony’s eyes, "I just want to be there when you step into trouble is all."
"It's not," Thor started and shrugged. "Things are different now, but he is still my brother. I just wish I could find him again."
Clint remained in the kitchen, seeing to the several bowls of popcorn before making deliveries out to the living room quickly, finally settling down himself as well with a particularly large bowl of buttered popcorn. He watched as Luke Skywalker emerged on Tatooine, curling deeper into the chair he’d claimed, glancing over from time to time to see how the others were reacting, noticing that Tony seemed to be paying more attention to Steve’s blond hair then the screen, though the corner of Tony’s mouth would quirk at a particularly good line, even as he looked slightly pained.
Bruce was still considering how to respond to that when the elevator opened again and Steve stepped out. He paused when he saw the small gathering, looking like he hadn't expected it.
"What about mutants?" Tony asked, oddly intrigued. "I mean, like Logan. He's pretty much indestructible and so far immortal." Tony paused a beat to take another drink. "Though, don't actually try to take him as a lover, I think that would go South fast."
"But you're the one who had the chance to tell him," Fury pointed out. "And you chose not to. So you don't have much of a leg to stand on in terms of high ground."
"It did what?  I thought it was supposed to be keeping him alive. He literally just told me that," Steve frowned, sinking into a chair.
"Which is why I will send Clint to take Erik out while he's still surprised," Tony replied and Clint's head snapped up.
Natasha looked up from where she was considering the twelve-sided Rubik's cube from Steve, "No explosions."
Bruce paused for a moment and then turned and headed up the stairs.  He emerged onto the roof a few minutes later, pulling his coat closer and looking around, "Clint?"
"We can achieve such great things with team work, don't you think?" he said. "Thor's upstairs but I'm sure he'll be down in—"
Pepper looked at Natasha, hoping for some sort of explanation, but the other woman shook her head, indicating she had no intention of explaining.  Steve rose after a moment and Pepper reached a hand out to stop him, "Stick around here for a couple more minutes, Captain."
Steve glanced at him, "We just have to be careful not to hang anything too heavy on the garlands or it might pull them out.  We can hang ornaments from them, though, and it will help hide them a bit more."
She rested her hands on his shoulders, still smiling up at him, "They're both going to be disappointed they missed the chance to come out, but Darcy went home for Christmas and Eric had plans already.  I'm so glad to hear from you, and to get to see you."
"Well, like you said," Steve said, leaning over to kiss Tony again, rolling over him and bracing himself on his elbows. “It worked out great.
She ran a gloved hand through her hair, speaking more to herself than to Thor, "Well, there's not much incentive for him to do much else at that point."
"I'm not sure any of us actually get enough sleep to count as healthy, Cap," Bruce said, finally drawing his attention away from Clint and Natasha.
"Good luck with that," Charles replied with a smirk.  "You still haven't answered how you like having your own team.  Are you all playing nice?"
By the time Tony reached Xavier's school, the fondue sets were still on the kitchen counter, cowering slightly. Charles leaned against the wall, a faint smirk on his face as he watched them. "I thought we had an agreement," Tony said, breezing into the mansion and ignoring the students who were staring wide eyed at the sudden appearance of one Tony Stark in their midst. "Erik was never allowed near my AIs."
“None,” Tony insisted. “We went through all of them last year with a fine-tooth comb and since I didn’t have to buy out any stores this year—”
"What of you, Stark?” Loki asked, turning the question back on him. “What have you been doing other than tracking Thor's moods?"
Tony’s fingers twitched but he did not feel secure in touching other people. “Yeah—have a good night. Try not to mail out my fondue sets again.” He paused, amending. “Our, the tower’s fondue sets.”
"Yes," Thor nodded. "I like the lights you string up," he said, tilting his head back. "And snow feels different here."
"And having Captain America living a floor or two away instead of in comic books and newsreels?" she asked, watching him closely.
Shortly after breakfast, Clint found himself standing the park, arms crossed over his chest as Thor dragged Loki forward to return them both, and the damned Tesseract, home.
"Please, I am not that uncivilized," Thor laughed. "A tree would not fit into Anthony's fireplace. We shall buy one."
"He's an idiot," Clint said. "In a really genius level way. Nothing, I suppose. But now I know for certain Loki is in town."
"Lot more complicated than that," Tony replied. "It's sortta a love and hate and generally really fucked up thing. But he's almost definitely here because Thor is."
The blond drew a deep breath, but nodded, "I know. I just don't want to make assumptions about you based on false or lacking knowledge.  And that's all I have currently."
"Yeah, but not for a while yet," Tony shrugged. "Though, I guess he'd need heirs at some point who would outlive him—say, does he have an Asgard sweetheart? Is he totally playing that double field?"
"Yeah, flirting fondue sets," Bruce answered, amused.  "Well, shall we try to have fondue before the old one corrupts the new?"
Pepper nodded, "It will, possibly, calm down at meetings eventually. They're still blustering on about this that and the other thing. Little things. Things that are not now nor never shall be relevant."
Natasha set her things down, eyeing the tree skeptically, but only saying, "Start decorating, I'll go get Jane and we'll be back when we're back."  She disappeared into the staircase to go to the Quinjet.
"Alright it was less of a grey area and more of an ethical violation, but there was no brain function and no family," Charles replied.
“Well, I have no plans to die,” Steve said and leaned down, this time kissing Tony gently, like Tony was the one who was going to break. And Tony let him, holding on to Steve as tightly as he could, with everything he had.
Natasha followed close on Clint's heels, setting a stack of plates down, "Do not jinx yourself, Tony."
"Because as much as I'm sure she would have, she wasn't the one who went against orders to find him in the middle of the desert."
Steve poured himself a drink, raising his glass in response, "Then we're good." He glanced at Tony, "I was coming by for a couple reasons actually..."
"I don't think I want to bring up Fury's manipulations to his victims," Clint muttered, burying his face in his hands, moving his fingers up to rake through his hair.
Stepping into the main room, Steve's eyes widened, "This...Tony, this is...Wow."  His gaze swept around the room, taking in the large windows, the gentle browns with subtle teal and dark red accents, and the opening to a hallway off to the left.  “This is…this is, you’re sure about an entire floor? It's--it's just so much.”
Steve offered him a grateful, crooked smile, "So you'd build something for him them?"  He gently set the kitten down again.
"No," Bruce answered, his tone tense and his breathing forcibly even. "How can you not get him at all? I'm sure there are more than enough newspaper clippings and news videos that you could figure some of it out.  And I strongly suggest you damn well do so."
"It's Christmas Eve!" he said. "Why did no one remember it was Christmas Eve?" Tony looked up in some alarm.
Natasha entered a pace behind her, arching an eyebrow at the room and the tension she could feel before she sidled over to Clint.
Steve laughed, turning them in that direction and laying Tony down on the bed moments later. He traced a hand over the thin strip of skin that showed between Tony's shirt and pants as he leaned in and kissed Tony, long and languid. For a while Tony allowed that, exploring Steve’s mouth like that was the only pressing issue before he brought his legs up again, wrapping around Steve’s waist. “Not to hurry this along but I have the horrible feeling some bastard is going to attack and interrupt and I’d rather that not happen.”
"Because I grow tired of toying with them, but I cannot do anything extensive with my magic in a city where Thor Odinson spends much of his time in this realm."
"I guess it depends on how we think we're supposed to act.We go to parties together, we have sex when were in the same city, we're certainly too touchy for just friends," Pepper mused, sorting the indicators out loud. "To anyone looking at it from the outside it certainly looks like we're dating. As you said, we technically are. Aren't we?"
"Sure," Tony said, bouncing lightly up on his feet and tucking the tablet away. "Come right on up. Though, I'll warn you now, you're moving into a tower of insomniacs. I can promise that Clint and Natasha are probably ignoring each other in the gym right now."
"Well, if I have the time I'll read them and we can compare notes," Tony shrugged, swirling his drink around in the glass, one hand propping his chin up.
"Which is pretty much never," Tony muttered, shaking his head. "Come on then, Charles, let’s go give the grand tour and get it out of the way, or you'll stay here for hours like an overbearing grandmother nitpicking everything."
“Should I not be certain of that?” Loki asked and Thor rose suddenly, striding toward Loki who wavered before he held his ground.
"That one," Clint suggested, pointing out a twelve sided Rubik's cube even as he picked up an intricate wooden puzzle.
"Is she staying?" Clint asked, not looking over. "Are you two going to be a thing again or is she going back? I mean, not that you couldn't leave too."
"When Steve and I first came on board. Natasha mentioned them, told Steve that he'd probably ask if he would sign them," he murmured in response.
"Figured what out? Figured us out?"  Steve went with the pull willingly, "I think they figured it out before we did. Colonel Rhodes gave me a hurt him and I'll kill you speech and everything."
Just then the sky outside darkened, lightning flashing before a shape landed outside the floor to ceiling windows on the pad. Straightening, the form shook its shoulders and strode forward. “My friends!” Thor greeted once Jarvis made sure the doors were opening for him.
"So alright, his chest is one gaping wound he pretends isn't there but you still like him enough to make kissy faces so you should probably go after him," Tony said and wrinkled his nose at the sink. "We have the most high tech washer for dishes in existence. What are you doing?"
"I know he's your brother, but I can't help but be confused by not trying to at least have him finish the terms of his current punishment," Jane murmured and then paused, "What were those terms again?"
Tony pushed inside the kitchen, pausing. "What did I miss?" he asked and frowned at the cluster of them around the table. "Holy fuck is that a kitten?"
Tony hummed, bending over the work table to the side to continue fixing cosmetic damage to his armor. "What's got a bee in your bonnet?" he asked, having barely slept since an army appeared in the sky.
The blond shook his head at that, "If I have to answer that so do you. Do you want to ask that question?"
"He offers a different perspective," Tony said after a moment. "I'm not saying it's a good idea or that he's trustworthy but—the fact remains."
Charles' gaze darted to Clint, the unfamiliar mind in concert with his powers still adjusting to his relatively new brain letting more of the other's emotions seep through than he expected.  He pulled away quickly and went back to rifling through the bar, "I'd be more concerned about the Norse God than anyone else.  I still can't believe you hid the bourbon."
"Yeah, okay," Tony said, rocking back on his heels and then forward into the elevator. When Steve followed him, he hooked a finger in the front of Steve’s shirt, pulling him down for another kiss.
"Calming down.  I find it soothing," Bruce explained, turning to face Tony.  "You really think I should go after him?"
Bruce leaned into the touch, "Something like that, yes."  He paused for a moment, before reaching up to let his fingers ghost along Clint's temple to his hair.
Clint looked both ways and back to Bruce before standing abruptly, almost but not quite tripping over the kitten. "I can't," he said and wasn't sure if looking at Bruce or anywhere else would be the better plan.
Her lips curled upward briefly, "Well that's what you have—” She broke off before she finished the sentence, glancing toward where Coulson would once have stood during the post-op debriefs.
"Yeah," Clint said after a beat. "And hey, if you promise this isn't just to see if you can have sex again, I'll promise it's not just because I need a rebound."
"I still," Thor started and only nodded. He had returned from Asgard the day before, tired and bruised from battle but he nodded. Sometimes it felt more like Midgard was home with Loki gone from Asgard.
For a moment Clint just stared at him in horror. “Okay, you know what, I’m pretty sure even Steve knows there’s more than one kind of spaceship and he was frozen seventy odd years. You might not want to let Stark know, he’ll kick you out of the tower. Alright, come on, I might have to call in backup but you shall be educated in the things that really matter,” he said, with another firm nod before standing, dumping his dishes in the sink. “Come,” he declared forcibly, motioning Bruce to follow him.
Steeling himself, Steve answered, "The Howard Stark I remember was a good man, if driven.  That reaction says he wasn't so much when it came to you."
"I can see that." He poured himself a glass of water and moved over to join them, "Who are we celebrating and mourning?"
Snarling again, Loki lashed out with a spell more designed to startle than to do lasting damage in the hope that it would mean that Thor let him go.  He had known better, he should never have been out.  "You've been distracted.  She's prettier than I expected."
"Ugh," Tony said. "Charles, I've been grown up a long time, you know. Older than that body, now," he added, eying it sideways. "And please just don't tell me you're going to make some nonsense about following your footsteps. I will drop you off the tower."
"You don't need to communicate to sleep together," Thor said and sighed. "Though it is advisable of course."
"But you did give it an AI, didn't you?" Natasha guessed as the new set seemed to perk up at the appearance of its predecessor.
"Not really, no," Bruce answered honestly, "I met him, but I've never been one for doing more than observing initially."
Natasha watched him for a minute, "There was a time I thought you and I had the same ideas, sleeping with our superiors.  We're not as alike as that, though are we?"
Bruce stepped away from the tree and opened a couple of boxes of ornaments while Steve carefully wove the garlands among the branches, giving the illusion that the tree was fuller and bushier than it actually was.
Steve raked a hand through his hair, "For god's sake, Tony, that opinion's been changing and I'm beginning to see exactly how much of a sucker I got played for before we met.  I wasn't working with even a tenth of the information I should have been.  So yeah, I did make up my mind.  But you want to know something I've figured out how to do?  Change it."
Tony leaned forward, almost falling off the counter so he could kiss Steve again, hands braced on his chest. Steve chuckled against the kiss, "Come on, we just decided this couldn't go any farther here."
"Well, who are you currently looking for a gift for?" Natasha pushed off the shelves to follow him.  She thought about calling the others and letting them know that it would be a while yet, but decided to wait a few more minutes.
"Damn, and I thought this was honestly going to be that simple," Tony sighed, shaking his head slightly and meandering further into the store, hands in his pockets. "What are you getting everyone then?"
"I," Tony started. "I'm going to get dressed," he declared finally, moving away and Clint had fallen silent, expression still. Steve disappeared quickly into the kitchen. Natasha paused for a moment before scooping the kitten out of the wrapping again and dropping it in Clint's lap, brushing a hand over his arm quietly. He shook his head slightly but accepted the kitten, pulling it against his face. The kitten mewed, batting at Clint's cheek.
Jarvis made a sound suspiciously like he was clearing his throat. "Hopefully go nowhere near Fury," Clint muttered.
"A dress, and a sapphire necklace last year to go with it," Tony shrugged, casting his eyes around the store as if that would help him.
Tony couldn't help the snicker at that. "Either," he said but before they reached the elevator, he paused a moment. "You're really not worried?" he asked, shifting from foot to foot.
"No, I couldn't imagine one," Clint drawled, looking up and down the streets. The lights were cheery, and some other desperate people were moving around, looking for last minute turkeys and gifts.
Bruce glanced at Clint, his eyes dancing, "Thank you. It's not sulfuric acid, but it should cause pretty explosions."
"His great—" Steve actually propped himself up on his elbows and started to turn over at that, "You were
Natasha glanced at Steve and Tony as she assured Thor that it wasn't any trouble, "So we've got extras if any get broken.  And we have enough that we don't have to worry about it next year.  Call it a win, Cap."
"And if I say all I want is you to be you, you won't believe me, will you?" Steve said, shifting slightly to adjust his position without turning over.
Tony just shook his head. "So what do you even do all day? I've seen you magically change clothes so you must not be shopping much."
“He gave me my first drink when I was seven, more or less,” Tony said, forehead pressed hard to Steve’s skin. “Uh, shoved down throat may be more appropriate. You know, the only compliment he ever gave me was that I was his greatest creation.”
"Which means that you can be prepared when he shows himself again.  It also gives us a better idea of where to search for the bastard."
"He's been in your tower for weeks and he still didn't have a name?" Charles asked, sounding offended on behalf of the kitten.
"Six of them.  One from a stallion, three by a Jotunn, and two by Sigyn.  None of them ended well," he took another drink of his martini, his tone idle.
"Alright," Clint said, and found himself stopping in front of a men's fashion store, looking at the ties in the window. His eyes automatically picked out a dark green one, the pattern embroidered in the same color with small pinpricks of mint green. He'd shopped there before, one Christmas when he'd been out on a mission until late.
"Heard about that, did you?" Rhodey asked, propping his chin in one palm, unsure if it had come up at Christmas or not. Or if Steve had actually started doing some of his own digging.
"Then you probably shouldn't have let mutant children into them," Tony said, almost primly as he smirked.
But it never reached him as Loki waved a hand and abruptly disappeared from the street, Clint swearing as his arrow clattered to the street, the civilians in the area shrieking and scattering. Many of them quickly ran away to hide themselves inside the nearest building. case another attack was coming.
"Why wouldn't we keep it?" Clint asked, looking like he was more than prepared to fight anyone who would want to get rid of the kitten.
"It's good to know we all rate so high," Tony said, looking around and realizing suddenly he had no idea what he was doing. "Damn," he sighed. "I've never been good at gifts."
"I don't know, sometimes a person just wants a hug and to be told things get better," Clint shrugged. "Even if it is meaningless, but no, I don't really want that."
Steve shook his head, "It was a variety of things.  Some before," he glanced at Tony and then away. "Some before Iron Man, Monte Carlo, a senate hearing. Some press conferences."
Loki's lips curled upward ever so slightly, "It's fascinating how often those things go hand in hand."
Steve's eyebrows rose at the stack of ornaments and garlands that were all carefully packaged, "Did you buy out the whole store?"
A fews weeks later found Tony considering the posh and pretentious bar he’d found himself at, supposedly for an interview with an aspiring reporter. The drinks, he gave them, were good, but the atmosphere was doing nothing for him.
misses you," Tony said, though Thor had returned to Asgard the day before, some rebellion flaring up at the edges of the reconstructed bifrost.
“What a stirring endorsement,” Clint said, rising to his feet. “Alright, I’ll see what I can set up.”
She offered him a smile at that, "I'd like to come back out here I think.  And I'm sure Darcy would too."
"You can't fit men into it," Rhodey said and paused. "But honestly how did you find the right model even, Tony? That's not fair."
"I've not seen him since last we spoke, so if it's increased or continued since then, I unfortunately can't take pride for that," Loki said, a shade too snide.
Clint’s eyes searched his face before a smile flickered onto his mouth. “We should try going on more dates.”
“Believe me,” Thor said, something crackling behind his blue eyes like a lightning bolt. “You would know when I was angry. I just want to know how my brother is.”
Clint entered the debrief with an icepack on his shoulder, looking around quickly, a frown appearing on his forehead when he noticed the lack of a certain black suit. "Hey, director," he greeted, flicking the paperwork and then ignoring it. "Saved New York, aliens gone. Anything else?"
"Yeah," Clint said and turned back to Bruce, still holding the plate. "Why are you so scared of a kitten, anyway?"
"Yes, sir?" Jarvis asked and seemed to actually pause. "Sir, Tony does not generally like animals. Is that a kitten?"
Steve frowned at the 'Blondie' comment but simply rose and went over to the refrigerator. Pepper shook her head, "Tony, the goal is not actually to get everyone you meet drunk. You remember that right?"
"Right.  I'm always around," Bruce replied, waiting for a moment and then pushing himself to his feet too. Clint flashed him a smile and fled. Bruce watched him go before retreating quickly down to the labs and closing himself in with data he understood.
Bruce’s eyebrows rose slightly at that, “Neither? I just don’t have much in the way of relaxing material. But, if you want to help, I think you mentioned spaceships?”
“Right,” Steve said, walking closer and leaning down slightly to wrap an arm around Tony’s waist. “Just a nice, calm morning.”
“Does that mean I love you less?” Thor asked. “You think you’d be more concerned by your own actions and their effect on the smallness of my heart.”
“Silence and peace,” Loki said faintly, so Thor walked into the next room, still not bothering to turn a light on.
“Then,” Tony groaned, sound high pitched in his throat. “I hope you know how to carry me to bed because coming in my pants in the bathroom is pretty embarrassing and should not be a thing that happens.”
Tony blinked and realized that yes he did have a fireplace and then shrugged. "Just don't cut down a tree in Central Park."
"Oh hush," Tony said, and Clint looked over at the kitten, trying not to laugh hysterically. "I'm sure his face would work on the majority of the population. Especially when paired with a kitten." He paused a beat. "Actually, that would be the best sales campaign known to mankind."
Clint grinned, Tony giving him another wary look. “Well, we need more communal events,” Clint declared. “The question is only which type of ship to introduce Bruce too—X-Wings and Blockade Runners, or Battlestar Class, or even Constellation Class.”
"Who are you shopping for?" Thor asked, dragging his eyes away from a book on architecture around the world which featured a golden style cover.
"Too bad," he mused, pulling the paper away from the package finally. "It would be an interesting story."
Standard procedure or not he wanted to scream. Instead he reached out and plucked the check out of his hand. "I am not putting a good word in with Nat because of this."
Clint waved from where he was sitting, feet dangling over the rooftop as he watched the traffic far below.
“That good, huh?” Bruce asked, voice a bit creaky and at least they were back at the tower. He hated waking up confused and hurting on the battlefield even more.
Bruce pulled his coat closer again, "Right, of course.  I still should have been more aware of what I was saying."
“Yeah,” Tony said, kicking the toe of his shoe on the ground. “Well enough for getting into fights with Steve Rogers.”
“What?” Tony scowled, shoulders jerking at the reference to mistletoe. “I thought we had that agreement about you not reading my mind?”
Clint gave him an appraising look like he had given the Hulk when he first arrived on the battlefield. "You are welcome," he replied before giving a tiny shrugged.
"They didn't tell me," Clint said, tongue loosening with the drink. "Tasha, Fury, Steve. They didn't think I needed to know." He looked down at Tony. "You didn't tell me either."
Steve's eyebrows rose at that, and he looked caught between confusion and amusement, "Not the reaction I was expecting."
Steve considered what the most pressing questions on his mind were and finally tapped the center of his own chest, "What does it do?  And why do you need it?"
"I hope the others are having equal luck," Brue said, paying for the clock and leaving the store.  He put the box into his bag and stepped to the edge of the curb, flagging down a cab.
“As I said, vapid wastes of paper.”  Loki shook his head, “Your world crumbles and they spend their time on your sexual escapades.”
"Clint, she has a chance at a normal life."  Bruce said, looking over at him, "I won't take that away from her.  I've done that to her once before and I won't do it again."
Clint took a deep breath, slowly letting it out as the rain lashed against the glass. “At this point New York might just have to get used to new weather patterns.”
"Some days I'm really unwilling to let it," he said, tilting his head back against the couch and letting out a long breath. "I want it to still hurt, sometimes. Like not... would be a betrayal."
It was probably beyond time to leave the country, find a way to get out that didn't require too much magic or legal paperwork.  Europe had a nice ring to it.
"It has been too long," he agreed. He'd stopped by briefly when he returned to Earth looking for Loki but they had not had much time. "Come, I would like to show you the tower, if of course, you do not mind Anthony."
"Well, I meant, likely if they're heading there or not," Clint amended. "Which you have voted ‘yea’ on."
It felt like a revelation, Steve around him and inside and by the time Steve was actually moving inside him, Tony couldn't tell which way was up or down anymore, he just clung to Steve's shoulders and kissed him as often as Steve would let him.
Steve fell very still at that, putting all of the pieces together and glancing at Tony, but turned his attention back to the archer, "Clint, go take a breather."
Bruce offered him another smile as he flipped the pancakes, "How long before the tabloids start speculating about them do you think?"
"That would be where I'm not sure where to start," Bruce replied with a smile.  "I don't know any of you very well.  Though I might have some ideas. A bookstore would be my best bet for some things."
"I picked out the tie I thought he'd wear," Clint said, softly. "He's the one who remembered dates and holidays and to get presents and stuff. I just," he waved a hand, more honest than he had been to anyone up to that point. "I miss him. I don't know what I'm supposed to do without him, how I'm supposed to act or... I just
"Go for it," he said, waving a hand and seriously considering retreating once Thor was gone and thus not likely to literally carry him back again.
"You think you can do far more than you can, Thor.  You overestimate your abilities," Loki replied, expression cold.
"Give me your usual," Fury replied, shaking his head slightly, arms crossed loosely over his chest. "If I need more, I'll tell you. Just what happened and what's on the ground."
Nearly banging his head on the cupboard as he pulled back, Steve waved toward the bundled coat, "It needed a home."  He found a small plate and put a little bit of tuna on it.
"But—" It finally registered who was ordering him around and the clerk nodded, "Of course, Mr. Stark.  We'll see what we can find for you."
A hand landed on his arm and instead of brushing past like other passersby were, it latched onto his arm and started dragging him to the side. Loki whirled, trying to yank his arm away, a spell already leaping to his lips and his free hand beginning to glow green, "Get your hands off of—" He broke off as he realized it was Thor and he snarled, twisting harder, "Get off of me!"
She nodded, rising easily to her feet and resting her hand on his shoulder, "Good luck."  She slipped past Bruce and disappeared down the hall.
“Don’t mess with my babies,” Tony said, tone light but his word choice showed the cracks in the joke. He shook his head. “Thank you again, Bruce,” he managed. “Good night.”
“Not sure that’s a box you want to open,” Tony said though he made a sound like he’d been hit when Steve moved toward him.
"They have a difference in genetics that makes you just different enough that mutants might be viable.  Of course they weren't all that common until less than a hundred years ago, which isn't all that long," Loki replied, toying with his empty glass.
"Which means it's a good thing none of us were passionate about fondue?" Clint offered, leaning against the counter across from him.
He stopped for a long moment, considering. "I'll get them," he said, not wanting to add that he really didn't want anyone else touching them at the moment. He got out of the car quickly, not slamming the door but there was anger in the motion. Natasha closed her eyes at that, drawing a deep breath before opening her eyes again and heading back to SHIELD's base.
"I can get it out if you insist," Tony said, shaking his head. "Though I was holding it in reserve for the time I convince Rogers he should try to get drunk."
"It is pretty early to start drinking," Clint agreed, lifting his sandwich in one hand and hefting up the kitten in the other before retreating to the living room.
“Anything, really,” Tony said, paying more attention to where he was almost touching skin before his eyes snapped up and he regretted meeting Steve’s gaze.
"It's procedure," Fury replied, but his voice had gone softer, the line of his shoulders lessening. "You wouldn't return any of my calls or letters. I would have tried a carrier pigeon if it thought it would get through. But you would have never lived there, we both know that."
"I was thinking a belated Christmas gift to our friends and allies," Bruce said, pulling his reading glasses off and setting them to the side.  "Charles Xavier might enjoy them."
Clint stared at her a long moment. "Natasha," he said finally, drawing her full name out slowly like so he rarely did. "When you told me,
Bruce stared at the kitten who was mewing and purring again, Clint's smile throwing him for a loop the way it lit up the other's eyes, "A kitten.  When did we get a kitten?"
Glancing at the other, Bruce nodded, "That's the current trend."  He considered what he was looking for and looked at the signs indicating how the store was arranged, turning toward the sports books.
"And it's given him the wrong idea," Bruce insisted.  "Whatever Fury chose to show him was no true evidence of who you are and Steve hasn't taken the opportunity to find out more."
"In the eyes," Clint said, gesturing up. "When he changes, that's what shifts first. I'm used to seeing it from a distance, not up close like that."
Loki offered him a sweeping, sarcastic bow while never taking his eyes off of Clint, "Always a pleasure to see you, Clint.  Good evening to you both."  He pulled his magic around himself and disappeared.
So while this story was being written your authors were pretty much in grad school (2012-2014) and by the end of grad school VS was getting like four hours of sleep (or less) every night and discovering a fun and new neurological condition (not related to the lack of sleep) while Medda was just basically suffering because grad school is sorta terrible. Which is why this story remained basically untouched for just about three years. But like, people still seem to be reading it and bookmarking it and giving us kudos and there's still something like
Fury huffed out a laugh. "I would never have expected you to. I may be a manipulative bastard but this isn't about that."
"That's true, but that of course then presents the question of the ethics of wandering around in someone else's body, so I try not to think about that much," Charles replied, stepping inside as the elevator arrived.  "So, you're all grown up now.  How is it having a team of your very own?"
"The one to make the suicide play," Steve muttered under his breath, shaking his head very slightly.  "You said the arc reactor nearly killed him."
Steve finally leaned in, just a little and still carefully not touching Tony at all, "Well, I've never been one to put much stock in 'supposed to'."
With Loki vanquished and Thor preparing to return his brother to Asgard to face their justice, there was still much left to be done to aid clean up and rebuilding. Which left Steve wondering why exactly he was in a SHIELD conference room with Black Widow and Director Fury while they waited for Hawkeye. The battle was over, the war won, but the civilians still needed help to clear the rubble from their front steps, and here they were in the midst of what equated out to a debrief.
The soldier shook his head, "Alcohol doesn't affect me, so I'll be fine having some." He paused before joining them, his gaze moving to Clint, "I didn't realize they hadn't told you, I'm sorry you had to find out like that. I genuinely thought one of them would have told you before."
"The public doesn't need to know how I use my mouth," Steve responded.  "And I didn't—I don’t know what I was thinking. Sex starved probably. Definitely distracted. Drinks with
“But, if this hadn’t happened to you,” Tony said, voice going even softer. “I wouldn’t have ever met you. We wouldn’t have this. So I’m sorry that I can’t be sorrier.”
"We were busy?" Clint offered. "Who's that for? I mean, so long as it's not for me then forget I asked."
Tony backtracked from where he was glaring at a toy display. Seeing one of the fountains that lit up he picked it up, turning it over to see the description, which claimed that it was soothing and grinned.
"Uh, maybe," Tony said. "I actually, had a bit of a collection. I should donate it to a museum, anonymously. It could be the Coulson Memorial museum. Some of the art collection could go too."
“Um, the movie store is probably closer," he said, hefting up his own bag and slinging it over his shoulder as they walked. "Unless you're more nervous about finding something for Tony."
"Well, that's not up to me, now is it?" Loki sneered, "Should I prostrate myself and cast myself upon the mercy of Asgard?  Their mercy allows me life, but what a life."
There was a shocked moment of silence. "But, you—" Tony started and clicked his mouth shut. "Okay. And the times I really piss you off?"
Tony squinted at Bruce and Clint but didn't say anything as Natasha fended off the first fondue set so Steve could wash the second one.
"Um, Stark might appreciate something that explodes?" Clint said. "Hey, do you think he and Bruce might appreciate the thought behind like a kids’ chemistry set or something?"
Tony flicked the phone app open as soon as it started ringing, not even paying attention to it until a voice started talking without any pleasantries or greeting. "Tony, as much as I deeply appreciate the thought behind Christmas gifts, please come re-take the ones you sent me,” Charles said.
"It doesn't change the fact that they ran into you hard enough to apparently break the plane," Steve protested. Natasha sighed and started to rise, but paused when Bruce set aside his gifts and went to help Clint in the kitchen before she could.
"Mostly I'm still getting used to the labs here. I haven't been able to work with anything like this before, even in my old labs," Bruce said, watching Clint as he ate. "What about you? I haven't seen you around much."
Betty looked at him for a long moment, “So you’ve got a couple of steps further along in having this under control.”
Dr. Banner looked toward the two blonds, dropping his gaze back to his juice for a moment before turning his attention to Tony, "Company could be nice."
"Apparently you all infected him with the spirit of the season or whatever tripe was spouted over the last month.  It was his holiday gift to me," Loki replied with a smile.  "But I think it's time I was moving on.  New York is growing dull."
He sat for a long moment on the edge of his bed, not moving, not breathing much, with only the streetlights from down below to see by. But he did not need to see when he could hear Loki moving around slowly.
"And after that?" Tony asked. "God, Steve, have you bothered to look at history since then? The world is always at war when you keep handing it weapons."
Tony barely looked over and Jarvis locked the door before his voice came back. "Assuming you shall not sleep tonight, shall I see if anyone will deliver coffee?"
Natasha sighed, not moving, “I should have, yes. I didn’t, but my reasons for that were perhaps flawed.”
"I recall there being a bus mentioned when I calmed down enough to talk to Rhodey later," Pepper supplied. "The risks you take for other people are suicidal, Tony."
Steve followed Clint, paying for the gifts and picking up the bag, "Frame or the movie store first, then?"
"Because I have a stubborn streak and I keep hoping that eventually I'll hit on the one that you'll answer."
"Kitten, for now," Clint said. "But you're right, Tony doesn't get to name it." He'd been quietly trying to convince Natasha that cats were as cute as kittens.
"Absolutely not," Tony replied promptly. "Why else do you think we would be in this business to begin with?"
"I have far too many things I wish to do before then," Loki answered, sweeping out of the bar. Tony finished the drink he had, dropping down more money than was necessary before trailing out, thinking about the way Loki's eyes had tightened.
Charles' eyes narrowed very slightly, "No, you've taken that point to an extreme that I doubt Hank would appreciate."  He glanced toward the kitten, "Though it is rather an adorable creature."
“Well technically I was four or five, but I didn’t hear it until a year ago,” Tony said. "It was on a video he made."
Thor's eyes slide over to her. "Do you honestly think me unaware?" he asked, voice low in his chest.
Steve set the second towel aside, neither advancing nor retreating. "No, I believe you didn't. But it's said now."
"He said I should come see you.  Holidays and all," she answered, gaze flicking to the weapon.  "So, he's always surprised me, but he's still doing so."
For about another thirty seconds that's all it was, a slow glide of their mouths together while Clint realized that Bruce tasted like the pancakes they'd been eating, but then he realized what was happening and jerked back, almost toppling off the bar stool.
Steve blushed at that, muttering something about bread and melted cheese before he nodded, "It's great.  Has enough forks for all six of us too."
Bruce rose and stretched, "I think I'm going to leave the rest of you to wrestle the sets into the cupboards."
“Only if you can,” she said faintly and they stared at each other for a moment, sitting on opposite couches.
Natasha's lips twitched upward ever so slightly, "So that makes gift four then?  You've got the majority of them found then."
"They should actually work as fondue sets now," Charles said, off-handedly. "Kurt says the one is quite a good swords-appliance."
"You mean to tell me he almost changed during this conversation?" Natasha said, finally uncurling, "Barton, what the hell happened?"
"I make plans," he said and paused. "At least I've made them in the past. They never really worked out for me or anyone around me. It's better to just not have them in the picture."
"Should ask someone who actually knows.  But not right now.  Just, don't think that Tony's description of himself is complete either," Bruce muttered, stepping back from the lights and boxing up what was still out.
"Well," Clint paused, seriously thinking about his next words, sprawled out over the couch and looking at the bright decorations and not really seeing them. "It might not be a bad idea. If you wanted to. I actually shopped for Phil today. Mentally. Didn't buy anything. Not that pathetic. Yet."
Steve felt his cheeks color slightly when Tony said that, but nodded, "Guess we'll only know if we actually try."
Pepper rolled her eyes, "I think I'll leave that bit out. But Avengers has a nice ring to it. Have a good day, gentlemen." With that she left, heels clicking on the floor.
“Sure buddy,” Tony said. “Not that I can see this repeating any time in the future or anything, but yeah, you’re welcome.”
"And what else can I call you?" Steve asked, propping himself up a couple of inches so he could actually turn his head a bit further.
Tony double taked and stared up at him. "I got sold out," he managed, not mentioning Obadiah. "I woke up hooked to a car battery and told to make them weapons. Made the suit and broke out instead."
Clint just sighed. "I suppose this means we should wrap our presents, huh? As Thor's the only one to think these things through."
"It," he paused, trying to figure out how to answer that, "better than it could have been, I think?"
"I feel like I would believe all but the last one," Tony said and blinked. "You were supposed to have kids?"
At the mention of Loki’s escape, Bruce had tensed and Natasha’s hand went to where she usually carried a gun when in civilian clothes. Steve glanced around, nodding in agreement with Tony, “Everyone looks like they need a break so we should probably get those relaxing movies rolling."
It took Tony a moment to catch his voice back. “You can carry me,” he said like that was a miracle. “That—I mean, yeah, I should.”
Sighing, Bruce shook his head, "I'm not there when he is.  I don't remember what happens until I see the destruction or the footage."
By the end of the night, they realized the first fondue set had moved beyond flirting into outright protection of its new found love and while they all managed a full, chocolate slathered meal, it was hard won. Samuel had perched himself up high, washing his paws as he watched the fight, and by the end of it even Thor's smile was almost genuine.
"I'm not entirely certain that Fandral has actually managed to sleep with a woman or man in the past few hundred years.  So, no, he has no video evidence either," Loki drawled.
“I thought you were supposed to be an icon,” Tony huffed out a breath, eyes following Steve before he broke, surging forward to slam against him, hands curling around his neck, sliding along the line of his shoulders as he kissed him. Tony had never felt horribly short before, until he had to drag Steve’s head down and curl around his body. Steve leaned down into the kiss, one hand on Tony's hip and the other arm around his waist, pulling him close.
Loki twisted around to look at Clint, "Well, I suppose that answers the question I asked as to how long before you picked up a tail."
“Doom,” Loki said, lifting one shoulder slightly and letting it fall. “As I said. I expected nothing less in the long run.”
“I don’t know,” she said. “I probably just need time. I can’t really ask you to give up any of your duties and it’s not like I’m not busy—”
"Well, that's why I have people who are going to catch me," Clint said, tilting his head slightly. "Like Iron Man."
"I'll take the kitten into my space if I have to," Clint said, picking it up gently as it did not yet seem to be going for the food.
"Only if I get to vet them," Tony huffed. "Your own life has to come with approval from Tony Stark."
Steve's free hand moved to cup Tony's cheek as he leaned down into the kiss.  The arm around the inventor's waist was loose enough that he could pull away, but Steve curled his hand around Tony's side automatically, conveying a desire for the other man to stay. Moments later, Tony jerked away, the rest of the room silent. He forced a laugh and quickly stepped out from under the plant in question. Steve took a step back himself, putting space between them, a blush coloring his cheekbones.  Natasha's eyebrows had risen sharply and Bruce finally cleared his throat, shifting further into his chair.
"If I'm going to start remodeling floors, yes, I believe that would be more than three days," Tony replied, hoarding his coffee.
"Well, no," the poor lad said. "But he is here and he wants to talk to you and he's being... very polite about it."
“Yeah,” she agreed. “We just, it’s still so new and then you had to go back to Asgard and now you’re splitting your time between three places. It makes my head spin a little.”
Clint actually laughed. “What, you don’t want to catch a game and then really greasy pizza while we walk along the harbor?”
“I attempted to create a certain alliance,” Loki said. “It worked for a matter of months but alas, neither of us play well with others.”
"I doubt we're going to find that quality on short notice," he paused for a moment.  "What about you?"
Steve caught Tony up in his arms, lifting him off the counter, arms under Tony's thighs. "You have everything we need in the bedroom, I'd guess?"
"A big one," Thor said and paused. "Perhaps smaller than I would prefer. Anthony's fireplace is not as large as I'd like."
Tony let out a breath. “But I wanted to.” He tried not to feel the usual squirm in his stomach when people were impressed that he was actually being decent. Sometimes it always felt worse when it was Steve thanking him for the barest minimum a lover should be doing.
Pepper reached for the package that was in front of Tony, still wrapped and looked at the tag before setting it on his lap, not letting him ignore it any longer.  Steve opened the last gift he had, the one from Tony and looked at it in moderate confusion.
Pepper appeared in the doorway, carrying food that looked slightly more nutritious than doughnuts, but paused when she saw everyone congregated there, "I heard Rhodey was coming, but what is going on here?"
Tony just huffed again, attention already wondering to the phone and floor plans. "Do you want your own floor then?"
“Spaceships,” Clint said firmly, nodding his head. “This definitely calls for spaceships. The question only remains which kind of spaceships.”
The room fell silent at that question, Natasha suddenly finding the blade of her knife extremely interesting.  Steve's blue eyes flickered to Fury, and then to Clint, waiting to see what the director would say.
“Weren’t you quoting them at me the other day?”  Bruce asked, turning to look at Tony.  “At least I thought that was what you were spouting.”
"So what are you thinking for Tony?" Clint asked, looking around and seeing a toy store, he headed there to look for chemistry kits and wooden puzzles.
Steve was only a few blocks away from the tower when he thought he heard something.  He paused and turned down an alley, following the sound until he found a battered cardboard box with a small, scrawny, tabby kitten left alone. "Hey there little fella."  He kept his tone gentle, holding out a hand and quietly talking to the trembling ball of fur which had puffed up and hissed when it had seen him.  He shrugged out of his coat and finally picked up the kitten, wrapping it up in the fabric, "Shh, let's get you warm and something to eat, what d’ya say to that?  Would you like that?"
"I would hazard a guess that the answer's no," Bruce responded, setting the kettle carefully back on the burner and turning to face Clint.
“This feels like a lot more than I can deal with,” Bruce said, leaning back and rubbing his hand over his forehead again.
For a moment Tony considered the package before finally opening the framed sketch as Clint rose to start breakfast, taking Thor's gift—which as far as he could tell was cheese grater from Asgard—to the kitchen with him.
While the rest of the team was watching the credits appear on screen, dramatic music blaring as the introductory text scrolled by, Clint realized he hadn’t actually watched the movies since Loki had arrived on Earth and Phil had died. While Agent Phil Coulson would pin any agent that spoke about science fiction or other media on the job with a glare, that didn’t stop him from being a childhood science fiction aficionado. He’d shared much of it with Clint, though it took the archer months to pry it out of him.
“Well, yeah, those ones are almost four hours each.” Tony gave Clint an almost horrified look when he pronounced that. “Dude, you’re the one who called me Legolas, yes, you get to watch them. You are sorely under educated when it comes to movies. How many movies have you watched in the past year anyway?”
“Sure,” Clint smirked. “We might as well finish, don’t you think? And no, Tony, you can’t have a tablet or your phone, pay attention to the movies.”
Bruce entered, pausing when he saw the kitten.  Although he never voiced it he still wasn't sure what the thought about the kitten on the counter.  Shaking his head and smiling faintly he moved over toward the fridge, "I see he's eaten.  Have you?"
Steve chuckled, "Bruce might, I never know what Tony's going to find amusing or not.  Any ideas for, say, Natasha?"
"So you're what, just making this decision and breaking up with me over dinner?"  Betty offered sharply.
The corner of the scientist's lips quirked up, "Explosions and New York City and I tend not to get along all together."
Charles looked in his direction and promptly burst out laughing, "You have a cat, Tony you're turning positively domestic."  He glanced toward the work table, "And you're building a cat bed for it too.  Oh I am going to get years of mileage out of this, you know that of course?"
Tony just shook his head, shaking as both his hands slid around to clutch at Steve’s shoulder blades, trying to drag him closer. “It—it’s not the same thing.”
"Can't say I blame him," Steve said, getting to his feet, "I'll write the report, and I’ll show up for that photo op you're working on setting up in central park, but after that I'm severing my connection with this agency. I'll take my belongings, the ones the government doesn't own, and I'll take myself—since unless a hell of a lot has changed slavery should still be illegal—and I'll be on my way straight from the park." Natasha's brows arched sharply at that speech, but she simply slid her knife back into its place.
Bruce offered him a faint smile, tempted to go down and check on Clint but deciding that he needed to give the other time to himself and turned toward the labs instead.
"And in another situation I might have advice to offer," she responded, drawing in a deep breath and briefly missing the clearer air in New Mexico. "Are your, are your teammates always like that?" It was a clumsy topic change, and she knew it.
Looping his arms around Clint, one resting on the other's hair, Bruce nodded, "I know.  I'm going to take great pleasure when he finally is gone for good."  There was a contented rumble in one specific corner his mind that he shied away from at that thought.
Falling still, Bruce hesitated before actually considering that question, "A few times.  I don't, I don't usually remember much, really.  But, sometimes when I come out of it, I'll be told about something he did.  If I care about someone a lot, in some way, he can be protective.  I don't know about gentle though."
"Well, the first was to apologize to Clint, I thought I'd check here first." His gaze moved briefly to the archer and then back to Tony, "The other, well, it would only need to be until that thing Fury's setting up in Central Park, and I hate to ask....I'm kind of without a place to stay for the next couple days."
Steve's face was flushed, but it could easily be attributed to the temperature of the water he'd just been under, "If you'll give me a couple of minutes I'll be out of your way.”
“So that particular battle went pretty poorly,” Tony said, closing the door behind him. “Except in the we won bit. However you pitching off a roof sorta sucked.”
“That we actually remembered Christmas this year or that Nick Fury is here?” Steve asked as the door pushed open again, Rhodey strolling in with a box of doughnuts in one hand.
"And yet you still haven't had Jarvis lock me out," Charles responded, still letting his gaze rove over Steve who shifted back slightly.
Clint paused, about to say there was medication for that but wasn't sure how medication worked with the Hulk. "I'm sure Tony could come up with something," he said, holding the kitten still. "I'm sure you could at least scratch its ears—hey, is it a girl or a guy?"
"Good," Clint snapped. "Just so we're clear, sir." He turned on his heel, almost flying up the stairs toward the roof top of Stark Towers.
Tony ignored the scrawling text near his hand, glad Jarvis was not verbally trying to get his attention in that moment. "Who says there's anything to do? You made up your mind about me before you met me. Though, to be fair, I had a whole lot longer to think about and judge you before meeting."
"Just come sit down, Pepper," Natasha advised, the ruby and silver ring Tony had given her catching the light from her right hand as she watched the other woman approach and sit down next to Tony on the opposite side from Rhodey.
"Modern art," Tony said. "I donated a lot of it when I, uh, was having difficulties but I got quite a few new pieces since then. They sortta just sit in storage."
Letting out a breath between them, Tony drew back and grinned. "Stubbornness is attractive, you know. Determination."
Bruce entered the kitchen about an hour after they had all returned, a new shirt and clean pair of pants on. He barely registered that Clint was there as he moved over to the stove to set the kettle on for tea. Once the water was heating he turned and blinked at the sight of his teammate, “Oh.  Hello, Clint.”
“Who would I even be getting into a fight with?” Tony asked innocently and Steve just stared at him. “Besides the obvious. Which is—”
"Blues for accent at least. Greys for the predominant neutral," she answered, settling in to continue helping him plan the floors, including her own.
Bruce accepted the plate with a murmured, "Well, I'm not," before offering Tony an almost sheepish smile and returning to the central room.
"Yeah, who do you think build most of the stuff in this room?" Tony demanded. "You think some subpar store bought bed or toys is going to be nearly so useful?"
"I came here to rest, why would I be an aggressor in that situation?"  He finally dropped his hand away from Thor's chest, letting it hang by his side.
Bruce shook his head, “It's about popular culture, Just go with it, that’s all we’re doing at this point.”
"It always was, and always will be."  She combed her fingers through his hair, "It could be good for you. To try."
“You trust me that much?” Loki asked after a beat and in the next second Mjölnir was back in Thor’s hand, causing Loki to jump.
"Well, glad we could provide then," Tony said as Clint strung a strand of lights up around the doorway.
Charles smirked, "He polished the chandelier in there too.  I figured I ought to deal with the underage drinking as well as using the best alcohol."
"Victor Von Doom of Latveria, I believe?" Loki asked, looking around the room with a sharp eye, taking in the bland paintings that seemed to grace every hotel room from the cheapest to the most luxurious and the beige walls.
Tony blinked and looked between Clint and Steve. "Huh. Well, I have two couches I suppose. Most of my guest rooms sorta got smashed or rather broken up."
He paused, eyes flickering to one side. "Oh. Yeah, and Stark's been having friendly drinks with Loki. I told you earlier I wanted to find out what he was doing."
Tony set a fondue set on the table. "Please for the love of god tell me you didn't make another one," Clint groaned. "What does that one do? Acrobats before breakfast?"
"I don't know," Clint said. "Probably already are, but if they ever, you know, kiss again like that were people can see? It's going to go down as the decade's love story." He paused another beat. "Might be great for different activists groups if they are though."
Steve was very carefully not looking at Charles, the telepath aware of that fact but ignoring it, "Actually I trained very few of the current ones.  Ororo was one of mine, and so was Scott, but Scott's gone off to the West Coast for some reason or other."
"It was one of our travels to another realm.  Thor was challenged to a feat of strength, which required him to lift a cat.  All he was able to lift was a single paw because the jotunn who offered the challenge had enchanted the Midgard serpent to look like the feline."  Loki's lips curled upward, "I'm certain you have that one in your mythology texts."
When Tony beat a retreat and Steve wandered off, Clint looked over at Natasha. "Okay, I had grief as my excuse, what the hell is theirs?" Thor looked over and then didn't comment.
Looking ready to shoot back some comment, Steve pulled himself up short at a sharp throat clearing from the stairs. Bruce stepped into the room again, having managed to calm down before the Hulk showed up, but didn't say anything and went back to hanging up lights, looking for all the world like he'd just had something caught in his throat rather than intending to cut off Steve's probable response to that.
Running a hand over the back of his neck for a moment, Steve finally nodded, "Well, he's been keeping his head down.  Did you think about the fact that it might have been safer to let one of us know what was going on?"
"Having seen what you've proven capable of in recent months, and having examined past information, I'd say you Midgardians are making rapid advances,” Loki said, inclining his head. “Though there are still limits due to the general state of your realm."
"I, uh, talked to Tony about that," Clint said. "Though I'm glad I never explicitly said 'hey I want something to shoot Loki,' all things considered."
"Pepper has, Rhodes has," Steve countered, leaning down to kiss Tony again, open mouthed and getting more desperate the longer they talked.
“They live here,” Tony cut in. “On their own floors. You have one too, I’ll show you around later. But I think Clint has his little heart set on Star Wars first.”
“And sentimental,” Thor said and Loki shook his head, leaning up to kiss Thor again, soft and quick.
"I hope Darcy and Eric are having a good Christmas," Thor said, smiling as children ran past them, throwing snow balls before they stared wide eyed at the Asgardian, even in Midgardian clothing.
Thor smiled vaguely at him. "Well, I am glad not to have to worry about that." He looked over at a side table nearby with coffee table books and smiled at the images on the covers. "You have such an interesting world."
"I'll be fine,” he said, glancing down at where their hands were still dangerously close. “Just need to take a couple of minutes and calm down a bit. Will you?"
“See, those are well crafted movies,” Clint agreed, before retreating back to his seat as the opening sequence began to roll. “And ones in which I will accept the expanded editions, and gladly.”
Clint shifted and scooted forward to be a shade closer. "Okay. So you've wanted to kiss me for a while and I've been ignoring that because of obvious grief related reasons. I'm telling you now, I can't manage something like a fling and you're not wearing a heart monitor anymore so that's probably good but you just said you prefer to avoid situations where the other guy can show up."
"Trying to avoid the Allfather's attention takes effort,” Loki muttered. “And I would be a fool to attempt anything right under the noses of those who so roundly defeated me last time, wouldn’t you think?” Loki asked, walking around to put the hotel room bed between them.
"My father was a very charming man," Tony said and Clint opened his mouth before clicking it shut. "It doesn't matter, anyway,"
Loki raised his glass at that, "You certainly seem chipper, which I am going to attribute to that shift in your fortunes."
"You're right, I did like him," Steve responded before he thought about it.  "He was willing to take risks to get the job done, and was willing to bend the rules for the right reasons. It was what was needed in that situation and he was a decent friend too."
Clint looked at him for a minute and whirled on one heel, slamming the glass door on his way out and making Tony wince. Bruce glanced between Tony and Steve before following Clint.  Steve drew a deep breath before turning to Tony, "You want to tell me what happened?"
“No,” he shook his head but actually managed to give her a smile. “It’s Star Wars. Painful or not, what’d become of me if I couldn’t enjoy it? Besides, I’m making everyone else watch it, might as well join them.”
"I didn't keep it, Mom did. So...well, I suppose that means that I do have it now doesn't it?" she sighed. "It was adorable, though. I couldn't
Steve just blinked at him.  Pepper shook her head, "And that still doesn't cover what he did after coming home."
"I thought tension would keep them in balance—Rogers from doing anything too crazy and Stark from sliding that far. Apparently it was the wrong tension. Did you ever get a look at the shield Stark was building, a few years ago?"
"On the plus side, it saved my life, the video I mean," Tony said but his eyes were glittering as he wrapped both arms around Steve's chest. "I don't take compliments well. It's always people who want something."
"Oak sounds like a very good idea." She paused, considering the floor plan, "You gave him a small studio?"
Clint had stopped hanging up the lights and now just looked like he was watching a train wreck, Tony's expression down right daring Steve to continue. Steve drew a deep breath and finally looked away, backing down from the fight.
Bruce offered Thor a faint smile and a nod, "It is."  He pushed open the door of a bookstore he thought looked promising, "Let's try here first."
Clint blinked and his cheekbones flushed. "Well, it was pretty strong coffee. But I suppose the real answer is no."
Clint hummed, considering before he reached over, twining his fingers together with Bruce's. Stilling, Bruce waited a second to see if this was going to last. When he did he smiled and squeezed Clint's hand back.
Natasha had rolled smoothly to her feet and had a weapon in hand at the first hint of anyone coming near her floor. She lowered the pistol when she saw Clint, swearing at him in Russian as she holstered it, "Are you trying to get shot?"
“I’m not sure we’re talking about the same sort of love here,” Loki said and Thor ran a hand over his face instead of laughing again.
Steve propped himself up on one elbow, "Tony, if you're going to put yourself in dangerous situations the least you could do is call me and give me the chance to back you up."
Clint frowned at Natasha as she fiddled with a folding knife and then at Fury. "Sir?" he said finally, after using a rubber band and pencil to create a makeshift cross bow. "Where is Agent Coulson?"
"And most nights I might just join 'em," came the response as he followed Tony into the elevator. "Tonight though?" he shook his head, "Tonight I'm taking off."
The other man fell very still at that, blue eyes focusing on Tony, "I'm trying not to read into what you just said. Can you spell it out for me or am I going to have to let that one go?"
"He also mentioned ulcers,” Steve said, nuzzling down into the skin of Tony’s neck, like he couldn’t stand another second without doing it. Tony’s hands flexed before he lifted them, tangling his fingers in Steve’s hair. “Though I think I'm physically incapable of getting those."
“Would it help?” he asked and Steve hesitated before he shook his head. “So no, I don’t dwell on things when I can help it,” Tony said before he leaned up, smearing a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “I’d rather dwell on something else.”
Loki snorted derisively at that before pouring his strength into another shove against Thor's chest, "Wonderful.  Well, why don't you go back to them, them?"
“Like, in terms of movies?” Tony asked, blinking at him before finally deciding he wasn’t getting out of this and pulling his goggles off from where they’d been pushed into his hair and trying to clean up the lab space enough that he would be able to use it again when he came back to the project.
“No,” he insisted. “Except you know. Everyone in this room. I expect something is going to blow up at some point, or I don’t know, a portal could mysteriously appear over our heads at literally any moment—”
Steve and Bruce blinked at that in confusion and Natasha arched an eyebrow. "It's probably not going to be much more than ten pounds.  Mighty warrior might be a steep expectation," Bruce said.
That earned the faintest ghost of a smile, "I'm sorry for your loss. Death is never easy to handle." He paused, "If there's anything you need..."
"The Bifrost and our lifespan have always raised such issues," Thor shrugged. "I think I almost made Fandral faint though, when I started arguing the finer points of philosophy with my brother."
Offering the spymaster another long look, Steve finally turned and exited the conference room, closing the door firmly behind him.
Pausing for another long moment, Steve headed for the door, calling over his shoulder, "Good luck with what you're doing there, Tony."
"Still," Tony said, not quite able to grasp how long Asgardians lived, unsure if he wanted it or hated the idea of
