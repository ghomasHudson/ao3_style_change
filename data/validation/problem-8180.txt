Peter looked after them, scratching his head.
Bruce groaned and draped an arm over his head.
Wade grabbed his hand, following after him. The trail was rocky and wound between different trees on its way down the slope that they were camped out on. As the light from their fire faded around them, Peter began to notice something.
"Banner was working," the Hulk replied in a surprisingly reasonable way. "And patchin' up YOU."
"Hulk whisperer or not, that can't be the real Hawkeye."
He paused to see if they would respond.
"Oh, you need some more?" They heard Bruce ask as the voices in the medical room faded away. Pepper shivered and shook her head.
Shooting Cap and Tony a nervous grin, Peter turned and started after him.
"I smelled waffles and came straight here from my hammock," Peter admitted sheepishly. "Which is yours, right? I really don't mind sleeping on the roof if you want to sleep there tonight, I swear."
He gave Peter a pat on the shoulder and gestured for Bruce to lead the way out onto the beach. What kind of advice would Bruce need from HIM?
Peter stuck himself to a high wall and called down, "Hey, got everything under control down there?"
Since he had been revived, Cap hadn’t given romance much thought. The world was always ending, or there was some giant threat on the horizon—who had time to think about dating?
The couch was built more for looks than for comfort. Sleeping on it reminded Cap of camping in the field. There were lots of lumps and sticks to keep you from sleeping too deeply.
Peter looked intrigued.
"The lovely scent of MJ!" Deadpool said dramatically, still not moving, but fanning his hands from himself to Spidey.
"Stop this—you are doing more harm than good!"
"Hey, are you okay? You're making a face like Old Glory's on our bonfire," he whispered.
"Hey Jarvis, tell Bruce he can work on that cure now," Tony told the computer a little too brightly. He shot Cap a thumbs up.
They disappeared out the door, leaving Bruce with Loki. The Jotun rose from his bed, leaning on it.
There was a kind of hum overhead as the systems lost power...and the lights quickly faded to blackness. Tony's Arc reactor bathed the room in a cold blue glow, and he was slumped against the wall again, very still.
“Bruce is gonna fish, and probably drag Thor into fishing. Think I’d rather catch up on my beauty sleep.”
“Did you say you and Peter got ‘Hulked?’”
The suggestion was met with a storm of grumbling and muttering as Hawkeye spun and stomped to the back of the vehicle to yank open the back hatch.
“Can you at least track the taxi?” Tony sighed, hand still up.
Bruce patted his hand calmly.
"I don't know. It seems like you're thinking a lot. You keep acting like I did something. Did I get donut glaze on your paperwork or something?"
Bruce stepped past him, feeling strangely ashamed of himself. Clearly he'd missed some signal, there. He paused in the middle of crossing through the gate and turned to face Clint, looking at him glumly.
So much for being cozied up and actually getting sleep.
"Oh, good..." Tony turned and slapped a tracking bracelet on Clint's wrist while he was distracted. It was metal, like a shackle cuff, with a big blinking red light on it.
“Wow, your meat’s huge!” Wade commented lewdly, elbowing Cap’s arm. Steve did not look amused.
--and ran right into Bruce, who made a little 'oof' sound and nearly fell over. Unlike his green alter-ego, the guy didn't weigh very much at all.
Digging out a sweatshirt for Tony, Cap dropped it into his fiance’s lap before sitting on his own sleeping bag. Pulling on a sweatshirt of his own, he didn’t bother drying his hair. The water didn’t bother him, anyway.
"When we were swimming," he echoed, mystified. "I think I remember bits of that. Must be where the mermaid thoughts came from." He ran his fingers through his mussed hair, which had taken on a curl from all of the saltwater last night washing off any hair products he'd had in it. "Wait, did we-- Nah, that can't be right..." He sipped his coffee and pondered on this for a minute.
Bruce immediately stepped away as soon as Cap was supported by somebody else.
“Go get the sleeping bags.”
Shaking his head sadly, Hawkeye handed over his card.
Bruce stuck his hands in the pockets of the bright magenta shorts he'd borrowed from Clint since the green ones had mysteriously disappeared overnight. He shrugged his shoulders a little.
"On you, I'd use lasers," Tony retorted.
Bruce trailed after him, hurrying to keep up. The guy didn't even have his shoes anymore, and Clint knew the Hulk was the reason why. Did Bruce really think there was any other explanation, though? What exactly did he think they'd been up to for him to wind up naked with them both cuddled up together in the sand?
He looked at the root beer bottle, but couldn't really make himself swig it. His stomach kind of hurt. As far as he knew, Cap was probably straight as an arrow and old-fashioned about sex and marriage, too. He didn't even know what 'swings both ways' MEANT, for Pete's sake.
"Pass," Peter said flatly. "I've gotta go to school."
"Then order—" Thor stopped, hand held up, and glanced at the Clints. "Chinese?" He asked quietly in an attempt to keep Jarvis from hearing him.
With a nervous smile at Cap and Tony, he told Matt apologetically, “I might have to find you a walking stick ‘til we find it.”
Peter looked at the blond for a moment, then shrugged and easily scooped him up from the couch to carry bridal-style. It was disconcerting, with how tall Wade was and how skinny Peter looked, to remember that the kid was super strong.
“Ah shit,” Clint growled, hurrying after him. So much for their vacation! Spider-Man was going to have a big brawl with this guy and they were going to have to go home early, tackle box or no tackle box.
Steve stared at the blind man, surprised he had been able to hear what they’d been saying from so far away.
“I guess it’s because Peter acts so grown up. He’s more mature than a lot of people I know. Peter’s a good person. One of the best, in my opinion.”
Clint plunked down and held on, grinning at the sloshing waves as they broke over the Hulk’s massive form. The day wasn’t over yet after all. The air was cooling off and Hulk was finally around.
Tony snorted.
Had he walked up the hiking path all by himself? That was two miles! He had to have, though, there was no other way up…
Wade swayed back and forth for a minute, arms loose above his head, a hotdog in each hand.
"Really," the husky man growled suspiciously, leaning forward to look down at Peter's face. "Playin' dead ain't going to save yer skinny ass."
Stuck in the tip of his finger was a fishing hook.
“Tony,” Steve said, gently taking his fiance’s arm. “We have to tell someone or this whole trip is pointless.”
"What? No! I've been fighting my way out of that warehouse!" Clint yelled, pointing off in behind him, probably at wherever he had come from.
It just wasn’t a challenge that way.
"Mr. Parker is not within my range, sir," Jarvis replied solemnly. "I believe he and Mr. Storm left the mansion awhile before the shield was put over it."
“Oh…h-hi there…”
The scientist blinked. Bruce swore he almost saw the archer blush...it was probably just the bad lighting, though.
“I’ll talk to them as soon as I can—Tony,” Cap said, dropping his voice to a whisper and shifting in the sand to face Tony. “If Peter and Wade aren’t actually a couple, I think we need to rethink our strategy.” He gestured subtly out to the two young men. “They seem so happy—we should keep our noses out of it. Honestly, what do WE know about romance?”
"I've been too busy trying to keep them from killing each other," Bruce replied tiredly, finishing with dressing Loki's wound. He patted the blond's hand and stood, turning to get a better look at Steve. "How are you? Have your symptoms gotten any worse?"
"Like...dating advice?" He asked in a stage whisper to Cap. Bruce, who could clearly hear him, sighed heavily and rubbed one of his temples.
“I…guess we’re gonna have to move our camp. Down by the Avengers, probably. This’s a disaster, I’m sorry.” What was Wade even looking for in that tent? Whatever it was, it had to be flattened by now. Peter groaned and put his face in his hand, realizing that that meant his only clothes were in the waterlogged backpack back in the Avengers’ camp. Even his s’mores supplies were now in the mud under that tree. Why him?
Steve stuck a large marshmallow into his hand.
He turned back to Loki and quickly began to bandage him, taping the gauze in place around the edges.
After a few half hearted once-overs of the tabletop without really looking beneath the surface layer of papers, he decided to go back to his project and not worry about it. Worrying was stressful, and he tried to avoid stress. Besides, the thing beeped and lit up, so it wasn't as if he wouldn't hear it if it rang, right?
Bruce stepped inside the room and headed for the countertop across from the door, carrying a briefcase along.
“Well, how many models do YOU know?” Steve joked, heading inside. The living room area of the cabin was empty. Everyone must have finally settled in to do their own thing.
"Um. Thanks," pajama-clad Clint mumbled.
“Does everyone have plans for today?” Steve asked. “It’s going to be a beautiful day, so Tony and I are going to enjoy the lake.”
Why? Why was he stuck on some stupid vacation, babysitting Spidey and his way-too-old-for-him boyfriend? WHY?
Clint just reached up and patted Thor's back. After a good long moment, Thor finally let go of him and sat back on the couch, turning his attention back to the movie.
“I’m surprised you’ll even say ‘us’.” Tony got to his feet, too. Steve could feel the intent gaze fixed on him even when he was looking at the ocean. The wind howled furiously. The fog made the waves look like they went out into eternity. “I have no expectations here. I don’t expect you to say anything, or do anything, and so far I’m dead right,” Tony said bitterly. “But I can’t just pretend this isn’t happening to us—me. To me.”
Bruce sighed and tried propping his head up on one hand. Ouch. Right, he'd forgotten about all of the little scuffs and scratches from the underbrush before.
"I hid it in Spidey's garage." Deadpool jerked a thumb at Peter. "He knew it was there."
“Whoa, whoa. Calm down. We just gotta have Thor adjust the weather! The last thing we wanna do is save them before they talk.”
At the moment, Peter just wanted to get Aunt May home and out of the potential disaster area that any place containing Deadpool and Wolverine often became. The thought of Deadpool following him and his aunt home, though, was horrifying. It wasn’t like he could move to lose the guy after that!
Hawkeye stopped dead, too, looking equally shocked that the arrow had worked.
"The other Hawkeye," Bruce said, turning away abruptly and heading for the counter.
"He is under my care, Stark. Any attempts to harm him shall be met with the wrath of Thor."
Clint quietly ate his ice cream, watching the ocean down the stairs as it swirled. The sky was a very vibrant blue with distant clouds surrounding it like a picture frame.
When Matt turned back around, Peter noted that he wasn’t wearing his glasses yet and looked as tired as Peter felt. His hair was an awful mess, sticking up in clumps. Half feeling and half glancing around, the redhead frowned.
Pulling on his best smexy smile, Clint grinned up at Bruce.
"Wait, we shouldn't split up," Bruce called out after him, his voice fading as Cap hurried back the way he’d come.
"And that he's a carrot top," Tony said with absolute confidence. Peter's unchanged expression confirmed that he was right.
"Spidey!" Deadpool exclaimed from the rooftop, arms wide. "Aw, c'mere and gimme a hug you lovebug you!"
"Where's my bike, bub?"
“Roger…Barton,” Loki lied, losing his steam. It was a game of his to see how poorly he could lie and still slip by the Avengers' notice. It was typically a lot easier when food was involved.
Bruce didn't move from his slumped position at the table, listening to Thor’s cheerful booming voice from nearby.
“After you’re out of the weather.”
What?
He...was he talking about Cap's cooking ability being hot? Peter didn't know how to feel about that one, so he settled for shooting the blond a weird look.
Bruce decided to close his eyes. Somehow, psychologically, this way he was more prepared for it to be black in the hallway. The feel of the floor changing under his feet and Clint's warm hand still steering him by the shoulder were the most noticeable things around.
Deadpool poked his head back in the door.
Feeling almost misty eyed at the swirling thoughts of his would-be son, Cap rose from setting up the tent and circled it to find Tony. His fiance had been unhappy at how small the campsite was, especially since it put their tent only about two meters away from Thor’s.
“Oh thank God,” he said, “It’s a way out of the cave. I’ll check it out, wait here.” Again without waiting for a reply, he set off down the tunnel. Wow, it just got steeper and steeper. Good thing he could stick to walls, or it would basically be a water slide in a few more feet…
“It is not buried THAT deeply if you pay attention,” Thor told them both earnestly. He didn’t sound like he meant it in a snarky way, but Steve could see that contrary glint in Tony’s eye the second he heard it.
Thank you so much for reading our fluffy meddling matchmaking domestic vacation fic! We're brainstorming for another Marvel fic already, so if you enjoyed this one, stay tuned. Comments and kudos make our day! ♥
"Sorry, Cap. I talked him down."
“Now that you mention it, when I’m in my armor and Thor uses his lightning…” There was a ‘scientific curiosity’ kind of glint in his eye that Peter was a little worried about.
“Are you okay? You shouldn’t be swimming around with broken ribs,” Cap said, eying Clint’s side.
"I don't think they're dating," he said frankly. "I don't think they realize the other is also interested, and it bothers them, and it looks like they're not getting along pretty often because of it."
He glanced at the blond sidelong, and Loki noted that his eyes were still soft and brown, not green. And...did he have a sprinkle of little freckles on his face? The Jotun had never actually looked at him this closely before—he was usually the Hulk at that point.
"Right," Peter said, sitting up straighter. He held up his hands as he talked, waving them a bit. "And we could have a route with places to plant the flags and make it zig-zag all over the place so they're out here awhile. Think they'd talk if they were just in a kayak long enough, or do they need to actually be stuck there?"
"Pepper? Help me," Clint said dramatically. "Please. Before he comes back."
"I said I was keeping watch, not running off," the Jotun growled, grabbing one of Bruce's hands. He was sure that using the one on his injured side would hurt like all hell. "I'll be right here. Go help Tony or something."
It was strange that no one had bothered Bruce for hours. Not that he was complaining, but usually after an hour or so, somebody came barging in to make sure he hadn't turned green yet. Come to think of it...where was his Avengers card? The growing piles of papers on his current project had spread from a single stack to cover the desk, floor and even some of the wall. He ran a hand through his hair and sighed. It had to be in there somewhere.
“Wait a sec.” Clint grabbed Bruce and turned him back enough to look him in the eye. “Uh…” He croaked, losing his courage. “I-I should get your nose.”
“Doom wanted Thor TOO?” Tony nearly spat his drink. Luckily, Carol and Bruce interrupted the direction the conversation was going. The door slid open and the cosmic-powered Avengers led Bruce inside.
"I second that," the pajama Clint said, raising a hand in the doorway to the giant Hulk-resistant cell.
He rarely ever got to SEE Bruce either. When he was himself, he was spending his day fishing or pouring through boring technical papers. Clint usually dozed off before they got to talking.
Matt stepped around him, unbothered by the dark, and knelt by the couch, feeling around under it.
“Uh, did you have any luck talking to Cap? You said he didn’t seem like the jealous type.”
The fake ice cream cart was still working to keep a crowd gathered. Even the reporters had given up their hiding spots to come over and get something cold to eat on occasion. While Loki thought he was handsome in his apron, he had better things to do than serve ice cream! Especially after a mortal had had the nerve to tell him that his scoop sizes were too small.
Mixed signals, one hundred percent.
Rather than go sit back down by Clint, Bruce moved over and sat on Cap's other side, though. When Peter gave him a curious look, Bruce sighed and held out a hand to Cap uncertainly.
"Cap seemed worried about Tony when he talked to me on the beach," Bruce said, placing his other hand over Clint's. "I think he's trying to focus on the rest of the team's troubles to avoid thinking about his own. We were meddling before to try and help them, but I think Peter being here gives them something to focus on besides themselves as well." He frowned. "We need to give them some time together alone. Separate the group somehow in a way that leaves the two of them together."
Tony was rolling his eyes as if he wouldn’t be doing practically the same thing in Loki’s place.
"That's great, Doom did it, right?" Tony's face appeared on the card and his voice came from it. He looked a bit tired, Peter thought.
Acting like dating him was some horrible thing to hide from the Avengers probably wasn’t helping with THAT any. Hiding that but not Matt and Peter really wasn’t fair, but that had sort of been an accident, too.
“Peter’s friendly. I’m not sure why he gets so much trouble at school. Jealousy, I suppose.”
Bruce scooted over next to him, trying to talk himself out of nervousness. It was clearly going to rain again, Clint was probably going to put the vest over them like before.
Or Clint’s blood on his fingers.
Bruce brought a hand up to his chin, again mildly surprised he hadn't shaved in so long. It was so easy to lose track of time.
This was Clint’s one shot.
"Woah. Aren't those things infinite batteries?" Clint said, making strange gestures with his hands. Then he peeked over at Cap and Pepper and cleared his throat. "I guess if it gets us out of here..."
“Wow, you came all the way out here to see me? I thought you were tied up with a case!”
Weaving his fingers through Tony’s, he felt more calm already.
There was a little cough from the doorway.
Cap wrapped him in his arms, pulling Tony off of his feet to hold him tight and return his kiss.
"—the bomb, and Captain America ran back inside—"
"Is this about spending all day away from the rest of the group? I thought Tony said this vacation was unstructured."
"Yeah...uh, I know it looks bad, but he's just had a lot of people treat him bad because he's...kind of weird...so he's clingy because I'm nice to him." He sighed. Okay, so Wade was also pretty insecure that Peter was going to go find somebody else he liked to spend time with better and dump the blond like a hot potato, but that right there sounded like an abusive relationship, so he wasn't going to bring it up. It wasn't some creepy possessive thing anyway.
At any rate, he got to Clint before the blonde reached the door, grabbing one of his shoulders. "I think he's the fake."
"Sure," Bruce told Hawkeye vaguely, closing his eyes. He was asleep almost instantly.
"I t-trust you."
“Okay. Okay, say I believe you. How am I NOT going to tell Tony and Cap? Jeez! If I don’t and they find out that I knew about this, they’re gonna kill me when they find out!”
"Y-you wish I was," Tony said, a hand still pressed over the reactor on his chest. He was panting for breath now, though, and looked rather pale. For that matter, the reactor looked rather...dim.  "Heh. H-he's old-fashioned, y'know—thinks marriage is forever and all that."
“The boyfriend,” Cap echoed through his teeth. “There’s no way that man is the same age as Peter. But we need to get to know him before we do anything rash,” the blond added tightly.
"He was already doing that yesterday," Tony said drolly, glancing up at Clint to make sure the face scrape was the only injury they were talking about. He gave Clint a little wave.
“I don’t care if Daredevil hears us,” Steve sighed. “If he wants to stick his nose in our business, I can’t hold that against him. We’re doing the exact same thing.” Lifting the paddle from the water, Steve shifted in his seat to look back at Tony, blue eyes challenging. “If you have something to say, go ahead and say it.”
It was so unexpected that Peter accepted the hand before it really registered that it was even being offered. He could have easily flipped onto the roof, or crawled up, or web-slung up, and he and Wade both knew it. Deadpool was just weird enough to be unpredictable.
"I'm not a robot! This is bullshit!" T-shirt Clint grumbled, yanking his arm out of Tony's grip.
"I shall order the Chinese!" Thor headed over to the phone. "But first, I shall dial the 411 and learn what number to enter..." Before Jarvis could rattle off the number for the Chinese place, he was already dialing and listening to the receiver.
"Your plans for having kids, I think," Pepper replied, glancing back at him. The guy talked a lot, didn't he? She waved for him to follow. "Look, here's the basement stairs. I'm not risking getting stuck in an elevator..." She took a deep breath and pulled the door open.
“Why don’t you lay down for awhile?” Steve said, stepping around Clint to offer him a hand up.
The demigod turned to leave, hesitated and turned back to Peter.
"Soon we will sort this all out," Thor assured them. "Fighting only causes your comrades grief—think of the others and be civil."
“It HAS been a long day. I suppose your surrender can wait until tomorrow.”
Whipping past him around the tree came an arrow—which went straight into Wade’s chest.
“I’m coming over later! I expect s’mores!” Loki called after them.
If it was Loki, though, why was he staying in Clint form, anyway? Was he actually injured?
"I guess I'll have to ask him. It's worth the risk." He looked down at Pepper.  "Thank you, Miss Potts."
T’Challa was a complete mystery to Steve. If the King of Wakanda had feelings for anyone, he hid them very well. Though, he was very playful with Hawkeye. They shared some kind of banter not unlike Hawkeye and Hulk did.
“Cap!” Peter couldn’t hide his relief at seeing Steve. “Um, I’m okay, but Hawkeye’s stitches are bleeding everywhere. Again,” he said worriedly, glancing at Clint. Dropping his voice to a whisper, he added urgently, “And LOKI is on the other side of the lake—heads up!”
"What if he's getting a Hulk blood sample in there or something?" Tony grumbled a little. "...Fine. Jarvis, keep an eye on them and tell me if Hawkeye or the Hulk do ANYTHING suspicious. Especially if it draws blood, okay?"
"We have enough spaghetti to feed an army," Tony added honestly. "We're used to having enough food for the Hulk, so it's probably way too much, honestly."
Fidgeting, Clint wasn’t really sure how he’d label himself. He hadn’t ever needed to. God knows the circus didn’t care, so he hadn’t either. Women were the norm, so that meant he was straight. Right?
“My, my. If it isn’t the talk of the town.” Loki headed their way, shaking water from his hands.
“Do I smell coffee?” Clint called ahead at their campsite. “There better be some left!”
Jeff? Peter stepped up to stop a few paces behind Wade, eying the hot dog vendor. He was glad his mask hid his expression at the moment. This was definitely one of the weirder outings he'd been on recently. Any outing with Deadpool was bound to be weird, though.
“Come on baby, I gotcha!”
Steve glanced out the window and then knocked on the cage. "Excuse me sir, I said Avengers Mansion."
"Kids, do I have to send you to your rooms?" Tony asked the two Hawkeyes, trying not to laugh at Bruce's tone of voice.
“I’d like to think that Peter isn’t that sneaky,” Steve told him over his shoulder, blue eyes only briefly passing in Tony’s direction. “He was definitely eager to spend time with them when they aren’t all fighting crime.”
Why had he said they weren’t together? It sounded like Bruce wasn’t against the idea! Dammit, dammit!
“I could really use some help! I’m a blind dude and I lost something out in the lake, so would you be so kind, oh kind stranger, as to help me find it?”
“Oh, are you alright?” Cap asked, concerned. Was that blood?
Bruce coughed and fidgeted with his wet hair, which was hanging in his eyes. After a moment of this, he gave up, looking at the ground tiredly.
If any of the three had heard him, none of them acknowledged it. All three were mesmerized by a scene of the three babies devouring a policeman on screen when Clint and Bruce left.
"It's just," Steve sighed. "I've never thought about anything besides fighting since I woke up." He shrugged, suddenly nervous. "Alright. I'm not sure how to say this."
“…Now?” Hawkeye asked, a bit angrily. “Is the mansion under attack or something?”
"Better watch out, I'm a pretty mean shot with these things," he said, snagging Wade by the arm and kind of pulling him toward the beach. Oh, boy, Peter must have caught onto how the two of them were acting, or looking, or... There had to be SOME reason he wanted to talk to Cap in private.
“Seriously?”
“Oh right, Thor’s staying in the other cabin.” Unless Wade had already located him…
Gross, Clint thought bitterly, turning to talk to Bruce.
Scooting closer to peek under the edge of the kayak, Steve braced himself. Of course, they had to argue.
“Seriously? You’re gonna go all mopey on me NOW?”
"Do you think Spidey still likes hotdogs? Last time we got them together, he didn't even eat it. He just scraped it off and gnawed on it for bit. Hey...do you think he sometimes eats flies? He leaned in to stare at her with a large white eye on his mask, whispering loudly. "You know, like on instinct."
Thor looked at him in surprise and some kind of touched gratitude. He had just opened his mouth to reply when the door slammed open with a 'THUD' loud enough to make both of them flinch.
"..." Wade looked at him for a long moment, then simply smiled under his mask.
Tony sat up and turned to face the guy, too, frowning.
With a great show of being in AGONY, Loki got back up and came over to him. It was amazing that the arrow had actually gone in at all. It made no sense...unless it was some kind of Asgardian metal. If it was, he would have words with Thor about handing that out to mortals!
“Doom will return them when you bring the reactor,” the masked man said ominously.
"Twins. Neat. He went that way." Deadpool pointed off down the hall toward the living room. "And hot stuff went that way." He pointed back behind him, in the direction of the medical room. "Hey, you guys know where Spidey is?"
Letting go of the hand, he gingerly climbed to his feet. The Hulk looked real. He was very…hulking. Clint frowned and stuck a hand out, smacking it on the Hulk’s stomach. He FELT like Hulk, too.
“It’s not a matter of attitude, Peter,” Steve told him, casually tucking a napkin in the front of the teenager’s collar. “Tony isn’t interested in any one person, certainly not me. I think it’s best for the Avengers if him and I keep our personal lives apart.”
"Cap made waffles for breakfast," he said, of all the things to reply to. Handing the phone to Tony, he gave him and Cap a big nervous smile and added, "I-I need to talk to him for a sec, be right back!"
Bruce laughed faintly.
The big blond man blinked, looking utterly surprised by this bit of information.
“…Boyfriend?” Pondering over the word for a second, Loki sat back and wove his fingers together. “I thought I smelled romance between you two.”
“I dunno, I didn’t look for ‘clothes optional’ signs,” Clint joked, turning to go back to his luggage. Sunscreen. Right.
Clint muttered under his breath, trying to sip his coffee and burning his lips.
"This's nice," he told Tony uneasily, pausing near the door to glance at him. "Maybe I should sleep outside."
"Hang in there Cap," He added quietly, stepping out of the cell to stand next to Tony. He scowled at Doctor Doom. "Keep your hands off him, Underbite."
"Uh huh," Clint said vaguely, staring Bruce in the eye. He seemed distracted, his eyes drifting down to Bruce’s nose.
“I didn’t forget it—I LEFT it behind! We’re here for a WEEK and I’ll bet you that Bruce will spend every damn minute fishing!”
“Cannibal—what?” Peter hopped to his feet, too, looking at the trail that led in a windy path downhill to the lake. There were some pretty huge old trees along the path, and he couldn’t actually see the water from here. Peter frowned and squinted that way. It was getting pretty dim out already. “I don’t think there’s any danger down there, Wade. My Spidey Sense would be giving me something,” he pointed out dubiously. “It’s probably just other campers. You don’t actually have molotovs with you, do you?”
"He can hear a flag flapping way farther out than people could see it," Peter said confidently, grinning. Matt's powers were pretty amazing. Wade's were, too, although they'd managed to carefully avoid mentioning those to the Avengers so far. It was probably for the best.
Bruce blinked a little and glanced off to the side, trying not to look as conflicted as he felt. This was the Clint he thought of, deep down, as the real one. Who knew if that was true, though?
“Oh boy,” Peter muttered. This could not end well.
“Oh, no, uh, Cap’s just a…f-friend,” he said awkwardly. ‘Friend’ wasn’t the right word for ‘like a father to me’, but if Loki thought he was Peter Parker, teen photographer from Queens, he couldn’t admit that Cap and Tony knew him that well.
"I can only think of two people that would want T-Thor and be willing to accept help from Doctor Doom. It h-has to be Loki or Amora the Enchantress." For some reason, he felt that Amora needed her full title, while Loki—who they had dealt with more often—could be on a first name basis. He just wasn't that mysterious anymore, Steve thought curiously.
"Tony?" The redhead hugged herself and shivered, looking around quickly. The Iron Man suit was the most obvious red object that might be rushing around. Maybe it was Thor, though—the demigod wore a red cape.
Loki tried to look offended that Bruce had moved away from him.
Trying to sit up, Wade ended up just tugging on his cheek and speaking with a slur.
"Are we still talking about me?" Peter teased.
"Who are you?" He asked the glowing archer.
He pulled her up easily, swooping her up princess style. He started down the stairs.
Apparently he couldn’t compete with a flirtatious twin trying to steal his would-be lover. Loki chuckled to himself before he realized he was doing it. A floaty feeling was beginning to take hold in his head.
"And if I tell you, you'll l-let us all go?" Cap croaked. It was hard to stay standing. His head was starting to spin from lack of air. Cap carefully took long breaths and shook his head to try and get rid of the feeling. Talking was NOT helping.
"And that's why I don't believe you when you promise things," he quipped, swinging over to stick to the wall and regard the black and red clad merc, who was now hanging upside-down. Comically, he still hadn't let go of the hot dogs.
As soon as Tony followed after him, he spotted Clint on the larger couch. After all his whining in the car about being bored and hating the idea of a vacation—the archer was out cold, bruised arms hugged over his stomach as he was snoring.
"Tony," Cap said quietly, grabbing Iron Man's arm. "Why d-don't you take a look a-at it? I know you t-two can figure it out. I d-don't think...Doom will...help us...now." Wheezing heavily, he took a few deep breaths.
“Yeah, wonders,” he managed, staring at Lola. With Thor standing next to her, their color combo was somehow familiar. Whatever it was, Clint didn’t want to think about it. That seemed suspiciously like non-vacation stuff. “Uh, I think Cap and Tony are playing frisbee. Would you go make sure they play nice or are you, uh, busy?”
“Is the sauce done? The sauce is done!” Wade came barging into the kitchen, pulling plates down from the cabinets so fast that he almost dropped them.
This day was off to a peachy start. What kind of good news could Tony and Cap possibly have? If it wasn’t ‘we’re going home early,’ Clint didn’t want to hear it right now.
Steve almost fell over from the sudden change. His lungs still burned from whatever Doom had bombed him with. It had to be some kind of robotic something that stuck to his lungs—because normal gas didn't usually bother him. Maybe it was more of Tony's 'lost' tech.
Tony arrived at the kitchen door, glancing over at Wade and Peter immediately before turning to Cap. Peter tried to peek at them out of the corner of his eye without being too obvious about it. Tony's hair had gotten really wet, so now it was kind of curly.
"I-I don't think that's a good idea." He wondered if Clint was chilled, and wanted him there for warmth. Great, now he felt bad for assuming otherwise.
"Hey beautiful." Wolverine examined it over, leaning in close to rub his finger over any imperfection in the paint. He turned and glared up at the merc. "I thought you said she had a bad tire, bub."
“A monster?” Cap asked worriedly.
Figuring Tony could handle that for the moment, Steve rolled onto his side and went to sleep. He'd just take a quick nap and then...
"Yes. He rigged a taxi to capture Barton and I. I hope he's alright, wherever he is." Steve gave up on the shackles and scanned the room over again. "Are you hurt?"
"Shoot!" Ms. Marvel flew after them, keeping her distance a bit.
Thor turned and headed into the mansion without a backward glance, leaving Clint to deal with the Hulk all on his own.
"Phew. Okay, that and the drive here had to be the toughest parts. Now it's time to just relax."
Annoyingly enough, Matt smiled at him too. Even with Peter looking so upset.
"You're right. Painkillers sound amazing," he told Bruce quickly, trying NOT to focus on the blinding pain shooting up from his side. Pain was just as awful as he remembered it being.
Again, Hawkeye rolled his eyes.
"Hang in there," Pepper said, leaning against his side with a soft sigh.
“Alright,” Cap said, using his dad-leader-voice. “We’re taking turns on watch.”
Tony paused just over the mansion, watching the shield flare brightly every moment or two. If the cards would work he could figure out what was going on in there.
Amora giggled.
“I’m good!” Wade called back over, lobbing the frisbee at Peter.
"Cool. It survived you Hulking out, so I'll buy you a meatball one." The hand patted his shoulder happily. "Come on, let's get everyone sorted out. I have to meet the new me." Clint started leading Bruce down the hall. "I sort of like the first other me. You said the new one's a jerk?" He sighed. "Why me?"
Unsure what to say, Clint leaned over and grabbed some more pancakes before following Bruce.
Hawkeye snorted, turning away.
"There are a bunch of little sandbars and rocks and stuff that flags can go on," Peter explained, showing Cap and Tony one of the maps. The dark-haired man squinted at the little cartoon tents on the side of it and looked about ready to comment, then thought better of it. Peter handed Steve the map and stepped to the side, waving at the shopping bag of flags he and Hawkeye and Dr. Banner had bought and assembled earlier. With their flower print and crayons for flag posts, they were bright and colorful.
What if this kindly blind man was a super villain in disguise? What an awful trick, pretending to be blind!
Bruce brought a hand up and rubbed the back of his neck, smiling in a careful way.
"Once it's done, I'll take some nice pics of it," Peter offered, brightening at the idea of Tony joining their endeavor. "Sounds like fun!"
Casting a scowl out at the choppy water, Steve hurriedly slid his short sleeved button up off and wadded it into a ball.
More frowning from Cap, but thankfully, he decided to change the subject.
He heard heavy footsteps as Cap followed after him, but the other two stayed behind.
“Thank you,” Peter said, hoping his nervousness could be passed off for ‘flattered and flustered.’ “Listen, sorry about Wade…uh, barging.” He gestured in the general direction of the lake awkwardly. “I hope your book dried out okay.”
"Right," Bruce said wearily. "Well, your tracker's off. He's not here."
"Actually, I-I think we're gonna go get something to drink," Hank called to Wade and Peter apologetically. "Uh, be back later!" They beat a hasty retreat before Peter could throw the frisbee again.
"Cap, I-I want to apologize for before. Walking off like that, it wasn't fair." He hugged his arms around himself, looking down at his toes in the sand. "You already definitely have stuff on your mind, and I just made it worse. I'm really sorry."
Oh. By. Odin's. Bushy. Beard! What did it take to get RID of this man! Loki tried to remain calm.
"Um. Possibly all of those things?" Peter followed him quickly, feeling like he was turning Cap and Tony's vacation into work. "I really should've thought this through better--I'm sorry, now you have to go to all this trouble..."
Leaning closer, Clint felt HIS heart beat a little faster at the scientist’s touch. Feeling exposed, the archer kept his eyes looking anywhere other than at Bruce. That would just be awkward as hell.
He let go of Bruce’s wrist, figuring that it’d be nice not to have a gross bleeding split in the back of his arm.
Perched on top of the SUV was a crouched man, all in red with tiny horns on his temples and a set of white clubs in his hands. Daredevil. How had Steve NOT known who he was?
Loki moved to lean over Tony, frowning.
Shaking his head, Cap took a long drink from his root beer.
"Watch him, Cap—I'll meet Dr. Banner and get the cure down here."
"I've got a bad feeling this has something to do with our imposter Hawkeye," he told Ms. Marvel.
“What the hell, Hulk! You-you-you—” He sputtered, tossing up his arms. “Bruce, you had to know that he put it in the trunk! Dammit! I spent the ENTIRE time we were here looking for that thing! I hid it when we got here and then it went missing and I felt so damn guilty!” Clint grabbed at his hair, puffing out a breath to calm himself down.
"Why are you going to Detroit, anyway?" Peter asked it casually, slinging a web at the building across from them and pulling them over the edge.
"Whoa!" Tony ducked and caught him just before he hit the floor. "Steve?" He turned the blond's face to look at him, and for the moment didn't have any snappy jokes to ad lib. Steve didn't look that ill, but maybe the poison wasn't the problem. He was extra glad he'd rigged the Arc reactor to detonate like a bomb now, even if Doom would probably take it as announcing war on his country or something like that.
Over on the examination table across the room, Bruce had awakened with a start at the sudden screams (especially since they ended as abruptly as they had begun...) He sat up and looked over at the other table, wide-eyed.
"Did the evil clone-maker clone an Avengers card along with me?" Peter replied skeptically. "C'mon, it's us—we were just here last night and Thor let us right in the front door."
"Man, this sucks. We're coming back tomorrow!"
Eating ice cream together had sure felt like a date scenario. Did Bruce think that, though?
"Let us out!" The Hulk added angrily, giving the shield another slug for good measure.
Hulk was his buddy, but he rarely ever got to see Bruce. The man had his nose stuck to his laptop when he wasn’t big and green.
"I'm still me, Tony," Bruce called over tiredly. "These two just can't get along."
"Hm?" Act casual. Act normal. Clint Barton normal, at least.
Glancing after Wade, Peter quickly snapped his attention back to the super villain in front of him. He fidgeted with one of his purple sweatshirt’s sleeves, shrugging.
It made a spot below just large enough for them to huddle together, but Steve resigned himself to laying beside it. The rain didn’t bother him and he was fairly sure he was lightning proof.
Doom silently put a hand against the door latch and sent a shock of green through it, pulling the door open. He gripped one of Clint's arms, hauled him through and sealed the cell shut again before Pepper could do more than sit up.
Sighing, Cap looked at the card in his hand. There had to be a way to track Tony. Jarvis might be able to.
The Clint in the blanket sat down nearest the door where Bruce was seated. He sighed and pulled the blanket around him, looking longingly at Bruce through the glass.
“F-freelancing.”
It was that, or Steve could claim he'd rather sleep on the floor because he didn't WANT to sleep in the bed. Cap blinked up at him, fighting off a smirk.
Speaking of Steve...they were going to be out here long enough to pack a lunch. No Wade to interrupt, no Matt to eavesdrop from a ridiculous distance. This was Tony's best and probably only opportunity to have an actual private conversation with Cap. Turning away from the others sitting with the kayaks on the beach, eating their ice-cream cones, Tony faced forward in the kayak and studied the muscles flexing in the blond man's broad back. He sighed.
“Just the guy we wanted to see,” Tony said flatly. Clint only noticed Steve standing beside him looking grim because the archer was reaching for the nearest mug he saw. The Avengers co-leaders actually BOTH looked serious for once. Oh, great, what was Cap gonna find to lecture Clint about now? Was his arm bleeding AGAIN?
"There you go—now you can run away if you feel that's necessary." He sighed and did his best to comb his hair out of his face, looking around the room. There was a pizza box sitting there on the floor beside them and the bed.
"Gee, which do you think?" Peter tilted his head, looking up at Deadpool. He tended to forget how tall Wade was. The guy bounced around like a jumping bean, and rarely stood still for a comparison.
"Yeah, thank you. I'm trying to stay out of the cabin," he sighed. "Hulk says hi, by the way. If we want to keep a low profile, we're going to have to stay me all week." Clint couldn't tell if he was happy about that or not, but he could bet that the Hulk wasn't.
"Well, I w-wouldn't marry t-them." He kept his face turned straight ahead, careful not to look Tony’s way.
"'Define 'our'," Tony said suspiciously.
Whatever. If Barton wanted to get in trouble, that was his business.
“Tony, if we were together, things would be different,” Cap began, but he shook his head. “Never mind. What did you want to tell me?”
“Besides, the gay part isn’t the part I’m worried about!” Tony held up the newspaper. “Don’t you think Hawkeye’s dancing with death here? The guy’s not even super human. He’s a regular dude!”
The Clint in the pajamas came over to Thor, sitting his blanket down on the couch. "Hey. I'm going to the bathroom. Don't zap me." He patted Thor's arm and headed out of the room, leaving the other “Clint” on the couch.
"You're my t-teammate," Cap said confidently, helping Tony up the steps. “And you're my f-friend."
Leaning against the car, Daredevil shrugged a shoulder.
The redhead sighed and started down the hall, leading Peter and Wade along.
Tony snorted.
“Oh,” Cap said, glancing at the sunscreen. Then he went back to the kitchen, snagging a root beer off of the counter.
Carol smiled and didn't say anything. Tony would be Tony and she didn't want to waste time talking about his giant ego when they could be rescuing their teammates from Doom. Who knew what he was doing to them—that guy was weird.
Swishing the edges of the waves with his toes, Peter shook his head at the mental images this conversation was bringing up.
“Okay!” Wade announced, sniffing dramatically as he started to knead the blob. “Just gotta make some balls.”
“So, he’s your sweetheart? He seems to like you enough to track you and come all the way here from Queens.”
Bruce patted his back.
“Put them all on here,” Cap said in passing, dropping a cookie sheet on the counter in front of Peter. “Tony?
Bruce put an arm around Clint's waist a bit cautiously, turning and leading him slowly back to the examination table.
More trees crackled in the distance. There was a heavy crashing sound. Tony did his best to ignore them.
"You know, I don't like you. Sarcasm is fun—but only when I'M doing it." He poked the shirtless Clint's shoulder.
Considering how acrobatic he was as Spider-Man, Peter was being pretty restrained by just jumping and maybe flipping a bit to catch the frisbee.
“HOW DARE YOU! My Spidey would make an awesome super villain!” Wade gasped, horrified.
"Tell me if Jarvis finds something."
Frowning at him, Clint sighed.
“…Meant that the coupon was expired, so I had to go back inside and talk with the manager because I swear to god, I’m not paying full price for a jumbo salsa jug again…”
Captain America was led out of the cell and down the hallway of gargoyles as he had been before. Rather than take him into the lab again, though, Doom took a different turn.
Freezing in place, Clint held the sunscreen up over his shoulder.
“How you wound up friends with the kid,” Tony prodded, shading his eyes and scanning the sky for any sign of Thor. Steve didn’t see anybody flying around up there. Birds were singing in the forest, though, and it was a beautiful sunny day now.
"Matt's our friend!" Peter called over, jumping up and sending the frisbee flying straight for Steve's chest.
“Tony, maybe we should help him?” He said, already starting after the guy. Well, since he was blind, it must not be because of the wet trunks after all…
"You really need to get more sleep.” Ms. Marvel sighed and hovered in place, holding up something red—an Avengers card. She offered it to him. “Look, I checked in on him myself and this was all I found."
Bruce glanced up at the sky, and then back to Clint. He squeezed the blond's shoulder, too, and then averted his eyes to the sandwich shop. If Clint kissed him, he could blame the sleep deprivation if he happened to kiss back.
Thor hadn’t moved.
"Fine." Steve nodded. "Enjoy your day off."
Thor quickly stepped forward and took hold of Steve's shoulders to steady him.
A familiar flock of giggles sounded behind Peter and he saw a little girl with brown pigtails rushing to join a boy and girl. All were armed with squirt guns.
"Uh?" Steve hummed, focused on breathing. "I'll be alright, Ms...P..." He squeezed his eyes shut as he coughed raggedly. They might not have time for Tony to find them.
Clint mumbled, rubbing his forehead.
“What happened to poor Logan?” She asked, playfully worried.
"T-thank you," Cap called to the open door, looking back at Bruce. "How long until t-this stuff works?" He really didn't want to sound ungrateful, but if Tony was in trouble--he needed it to work now.
The steps ran from the parking lot to the cabins in a ‘y’ shape, and then from the cabins down to the sandy white beach far below, leaving a little diamond shaped garden of succulents.
"The point is, he's not a robot. He bleeds," Bruce said evenly. "He's still bleeding, actually—they won't stop fighting long enough for me to dress the wound."
“This is like a monsoon,” Bruce said loudly from just behind him. In the thunder and driving rain, he still had to practically shout to be heard. “Come on, let’s get inside!” The scientist stepped past Clint and tugged on his hand, heading for the door to their cabin.
"Steve Rogers, there is no reason for you to remain weakened," Doom said, though he didn't seem surprised at the refusal. He held the goblet and swished the contents, looking down into it idly. "I only resorted to such things in the first place to remove you from the city quietly."
"Uhh..." Spider-Man pointed past Ms. Marvel's shoulder at the Hulk's retreating back.
The other Clint placed his hand on Bruce's again and frowned at his double.
“You owe me five bucks, buddy. Told you they were together!”
“I haven’t skipped stones since I was little.”
“That’s not dumb, Peter,” Cap told him, chuckling a bit. He circled to Peter’s side of the castle and patted the teen’s back. “We can definitely take a picture if you like. It’d be nice to have something on the walls that wasn’t from 70 years ago.”
Staring at him over a drink with a tiny umbrella was none other that Loki, God of Mischief.
“Ugh, no thanks. He’s a cocky control freak!” Clint grumbled, looking out at the ocean. “You know, it’s really hot out here. Let’s go swim for a few minutes, then we can look for bonfire spots. ‘Kay?”
“I agree,” Cap told Thor, paddling to face Tony. “We can’t just let him camp here. Who knows what he plans to do!”
If they planned to actually do the race part of this, he might have been a bit more pressured, but the truth was that the whole plan was just to get Steve and Tony out on the water and then keep them there as long as possible. Well, Peter had a side plan to nudge Clint and Dr. Banner into going for a kayak ride together to cheer up the grumpy archer, too, but they didn't know that part yet. Matt and Wade were hanging out here a few more days just for the sake of matchmaking the Avengers' co-leaders, which was pretty awesome of them (even if Matt did seem kind of quiet and grumpy about it this morning.)
"What? Are we a couple?" Thor looked a bit alarmed, and rather apologetic. "When you told me last week that I gave the best hugs of anyone, I had thought you only intended a compliment!"
"I wake up naked in random places every time the other guy goes back to sleep," Bruce pointed out tiredly, resting his forehead against one palm. "You get numb to awkward after awhile. It's fine...sorry I ruined it all, though."
“So,” he mumbled, trying to come up with something to say. Finding that his brain had suddenly gone on vacation itself, he left it at that.
All of a sudden, both of them were on their feet, chest to chest and glaring daggers at each other.
Hawkeye moved in, too. They paused a few feet away from each other, the original now dressed in purple and still shaking slightly from the cold.
“No, I’m fine. I’m just not used to sitting still this long anymore. H-how are you?”
Flipping a patty, Cap cleared his throat.
The arm-grabbing and whispering seemed like something Tony should object to, considering their smudged-beyond-legibility relationship status, but he had to admit he didn't want to object. It was kind of nice that Cap was so casually comfortable around him. When they weren't talking about the two of them, anyway. Sigh.
“Great, we’re taking a vacation on the face of the freaking sun.” He circled the car and yanked open Cap’s door, sticking a hand in his face. “Gimme the keys.”
"Unstrap me. This is boring," Clint stated dully, twisting his wrists in the straps. "It's making me think of Doom."
Lightning flashed through the windows, and a dramatic roll of thunder followed close behind.
"The cell is regretfully not equipped to dispense take-out," Jarvis replied, sounding bored. Could he get bored?
Thor glanced at him, catching Mjolnir without looking at it. He smiled warmly in return.
“Oof! Thanks?” Tony had just been wrapped in a blanket by Thor as well, and the Asgardian was already moving to drape one over Matt’s shoulders, too.
"I actually understood that," the captain wheezed, glancing slowly around the cell.
"Cure," he wheezed, pointing at it.
Loki watched him go, lingering by the gate. The billionaire was home and the only other Avengers in the mansion were Thor and Captain America. If Loki was quick enough, he could have an image of Tony come outside. Stepping up to rest his hands on the gate, Loki whispered the spell to himself.
"Why didn't you w-wear better clothes for this? Y-you're wearing the same thing as last time I saw you..."
"TO HOTDOGS! Sling, my creepy crawly!"
"Come on. Maybe if we search hard enough, we'll dig up a love confession from Cap or Tony."
"Owww...great," she winced, hoisting herself up. If this power outage was his fault somehow, Tony was going to hear about it later.
"So you can off me? Great," the Jotun muttered, willing himself into standing up. As much as he didn’t want to, he slung an arm over Hawkeye's shoulder for support. Maybe he could get rid of his wretched original and finally make something fun happen.
"Enchantress! What foolishness is this?!" The thunder god boomed.
"I'll go check on him," both of the Clints offered, heading for the door. They paused mid-stride as they realized the other was also speaking.
Glancing off at the lake, Loki sighed and propped his chin on his hand, absently tapping his fingers on his chair arm.
Remembering what Matt had just said, he snapped back to the present. Cap and Tony. The plan. Right.
Okay, so he was just dating one guy, not all over the place. When that one guy was a notorious mercenary with a reputation for bloodshed, though, and Peter had only turned eighteen in the past couple of months… Yeah, didn’t look great. They’d only been dating for like a month, but Tony didn’t know that. Peter could just imagine Iron Man and Captain America crashing through a wall and hauling his boyfriend off to super villain maximum security prison. Oof.
Wade flipped through the pages, tearing a few since they were still sopping wet.
It might have been his Spidey senses, but Peter got the idea from that look that MAYBE Cap was remembering their conversation about him having a boyfriend.
"Well, you're not melting. From what I can tell, Doom didn't get RID of your super serum, he just disabled how you metabolize it. You haven't been hungry much lately, have you?"
“You dodged the same question right back. I’m just not sure why you’d care what I’m interested in, especially since Hulk doesn’t necessarily feel the same way about things that I do.”
Unless they made some at home, he almost added, then hurriedly wiped that last thought from his memory as best he could. No. No, no, he was determined to keep telling himself that Clint was just talking about FOOD...
His voice cracked in the middle, and he cleared his throat, shaking his head. No, he couldn’t say it like that. Nothing sounded like the right way, but he had to—Cap didn’t seem willing to talk about this, so he HAD to.
"Miss Potts?" Steve called, the beam of his light finally landing on the redhead woman’s form.
"BY ODIN! Hawkeye has escaped somehow!" Clint was promptly crushed in a big bear hug. All of Thor's hugs were bear hugs.
Peter patted his back.
Tony turned and shoved the needle back into the medical bag.
“Are you okay? I’m surprised you went out camping when you’re still on the mend like this.”
“Okay, we need…” He mumbled under his breath, sitting out tiny jar after tiny jar. “How’s the sauce coming along? Here, add some basil.” He held a spice bottle out to Tony, still distracted by the card.
Except Peter kept his identity secret for this exact reason--so no weirdos knew who he really was. Clearly this guy knew, whoever he was.
“Well, we should probably tell Bruce too,” Steve whispered down to Tony. “That would just leave Clint.”
It was too bad everybody here would recognize Venom if Peter described him.
Glancing back at him, Bruce snapped out of it. He closed his eyes and drew several deep, calming breaths. It was no big deal. It was just Tony. If the Hulk came out again today, he'd probably murder Clint.
"Tony, are you there?" Ms. Marvel's voice came through suddenly in the billionaire's ear as he rocketed through the dim morning light.
If Clint wasn’t used to talking crap to the Hulk, he might have been intimidated by the height difference. Maybe.
"Ciao!" Peter ducked down between the two of them and over to Aunt May, hurrying right past her and snagging her arm as he went. "Aunt May! Wow, you didn't have to come meet me at the station!" It was an "aww, you shouldn't have" kind of tone, but very hasty. He'd so called that she would show up here.
What was it about the mortals and their silly accusations?
"They are not harmed," Doom said glibly, stopping and gesturing inside of a cell.
"If he was truly fond of you, he would not hurt you."
“Hey, is there a Peter staying with you? 18? Really flexible? Super hot?” The man shouted up loudly, waving an arm.
"I yield, I yield!" Thor laughed, dusting more sand out of the scientist's hair. "The battle was well-fought, and victory is yours."
The Hulk snorted, slamming a fist into the floor hard enough to send bits of tile flying into the air.
Apparently, Loki thought pretty highly of Cap. Tony snickered.
Unsurprisingly, both women looked at him in alarm. The taller one pointed down the beach with a hand.
Down the beach, Peter saw T’Challa laying on a big brightly colored beach towel covered in cartoon sea creatures. He looked like he was asleep, a book sitting on his stomach.
Clint tried not to roll his eyes. Cap had been going on and on about bears attacking Bruce since they got there. Now he was gonna to feel justified and make them sleep in the campsite.
“…We don’t?” Steve asked, slowly heading his way. He stopped, though, giving Tony space. “We need to work this out. We can’t keep the team together if we’re fighting all the time. I need us to be on the same page and I feel like I’ve dropped the entire book.”
"You didn't," Peter said uneasily.
"As long as they aren't harmed, I’ll cooperate," he agreed through a cough.
"I don't know Clint, maybe because you were kidnapped in broad daylight yesterday?"
“Um, OW?” Clint growled, spitting to try and get the taste of blood out of his mouth, which didn’t work at all. “So, what’s the verdict?”
“Where did he get the ingredients to make pancakes?”
"Why not smash here?" The Hulk growled, reaching for one of the two mashed up cars again.
"Cap, would you walk with me? I need to talk to you by yourself." He shot Peter an apologetic look. "Sorry, not for long, but please? I-I need some advice."
"...Hey, Jarvis, is Pepper still in her room?" Tony asked, looking up.
“Your eyes are green again.”
"It is true, he left of his own accord several minutes ago," Thor informed them.
“It’s a pleasure,” Steve said, though the expression on his face said otherwise. “Is it safe to assume that you usually work with Peter?”
"...Hahaha..." Doom turned and placed the goblet on the dining table, sounding like he was smirking behind his mask. He crossed his arms and turned back to look Steve over. The shadow from his hood hung over his eyes, and Steve couldn't really see them beyond a bit of a green glimmer.
The blond archer stirred, stretching and curling back up like a cat, before he opened his eyes slowly, looking up at Bruce with hooded blue eyes.
The archer followed willingly, giving Pepper a wink on his way out.
“—Ate the whole thing! No swallowing!” Wade explained in disbelief. “Like, Matt’s mouth is bigger than I thought! I told him that and he punched me. Pft. What’s his problem? I eat hot dogs whole ALL THE TIME. My mouth is like a snake's, dude! I told Matt I could dislocate my jaw and he looked at me like I was a moldy burrito…not that moldy burritos are bad. They’re an acquired taste, like Limburger cheese.”
"Well, looks like it's mano a mano time."
“I could steal a beach towel or something,” he offered, gesturing down the beach. Were they near the cabins?
Peter let out a big breath.
When he was talking to Peter, it hadn’t occurred to him that maybe he was just nervous about his SCHOOL knowing he was dating another man. There was no helping that now, though.
"I don't know, is that something you want people seeing a superhero do? This's New York, somebody's probably filming you and everything."
“Is that so on Midgard?”
"F-found it."
"Don't stab me, I know nothing," he added dully.
Thor appeared in the doorway, Steve cradled in his muscular arms and dramatically wrapped in his cape. They, too, were soaked to the skin, and smelled like rain and thunder.
"Yeah well, you aren't me!" Hawkeye snapped back.
Carol pressed her com badge. "Tony, where are you? The Hulk is moving toward the mansion, but we need to make sure he makes it there!"
Bruce took a slow, deep breath, directing his green eyes to the floor. He felt more sad than angry, though—and tired. Really tired.
"Hey guys, you don't think the Hulk's gonna get loose again today, do ya?" Spider-Man interrupted the two, closing the garage door. He hopped up and perched on the seat of Logan's bike, glancing between the two of them. "Think he's the one who knocked the power out?"
“Well, our camp’s toast, but the sleeping bags should still be okay. Will you guys help me out picking stuff up while I move the tree?” He hadn’t been planning on lifting or moving anything that big while running around out of his Spidey suit, but it was dark right now.
“Peter?” Matt and Wade stopped near the car and the redhead smiled. "We're going to head out.” Despite wearing normal clothes, a button up and jeans, Peter could see the collar of Daredevil's suit peeking out. Deadpool hadn't bothered and was still dressed like he was about to go surfing or something.
Loki smirked, waving one of the other campers over. The woman didn’t say anything, she just smiled and started working the espresso machine.
"CUPID HURT BANNER!" The Hulk was quite abruptly taking up the entire hallway, and entirely too close to Clint for comfort with all of that snarling he was doing. If the furious expression wasn't enough of a clue, the green Avenger also drove a huge fist through the nearest wall for emphasis.
Bruce winced and sat back from Clint enough to hold his hand up for the blonde to see. There was the syringe, the needle cover gone and the metal bent beyond repair. He'd pricked his finger on it.
“Banner, good morning!” Thor said brightly, waving him over. “The others are about to drink their morning coffee, so perhaps you and I can keep each other company since neither of us plan to partake.”
“I think you’re a bit too young to know this, but a couple weeks is too long for a summer fling,” Lola told him, turning and heading back under her umbrella. A hand waved back to him. “It was nice to meet you Peter!”
Tony immediately stepped in front of him, though, and waved a hand at Loki.
"Too good," Loki mumbled, staring up at Thor. The dark sorcerer knew his carefully drawn eye makeup must be a horrible, smeared mess.
“Hey, quiet, I think I hear something!” He waved a hand vaguely over his shoulder, not really paying attention to the others. No, his attention was focused ahead. There was a low ‘shhhh’ sound that hadn’t been there before. “I hear moving water over that way!” He took off in the direction of the water without waiting for Clint and Wade. They’d follow—no amount of bickering had made them lose track of his bright Spidey belt light yet.
“She is whatever she pleases,” Thor said happily, scooping Loki into his arms. “Knock again if you have further need of us!” Without giving them much choice in the matter, he turned and headed off down the hallway toward their room again, Loki’s dark curls trailing over his arm nearly down to the floor.
“Alright, sounds good.” Clint waved to them quickly, getting to his feet. “Get back out to the living room and play it cool. We’ll start the plan after breakfast. I’ll get Thor, you guys lay it on thick how badly you want to kayak, and Peter—use the puppy eyes.”
"Uh..." Hawkeye raised an eyebrow. "We should throw him in a cell."
"I have a better chance at winning him than YOU do, Tony Stark." Loki rolled his eyes at Tony's name. He had to be feeling better. That, or he was a little delirious from blood loss.
“Nothing. Just had trouble sleeping last night.”
"Owwy," Deadpool mumbled, shaking his head. He sat back up. "Look, man. What does Johnny have that I don't?! I can light myself on fire if that's what it takes!" Looking around, he snagged the lighter off of the floor. "See?"
“No, no. The couch is perfect. Honestly, you can have the hammock. You like swings.”
“Kid, your ice-cream’s melting!” Clint grumbled, stepping up next to Peter to shove a big ice-cream cone at him. They had found a stand on their way back across the beach and, even after buying ice-cream sandwiches at the beach mart, Hawkeye had stopped to get the group cones.
Both landed with a gruesome crunch on a newsstand. After a moment, Wolverine crawled out, dragging a limp Wade. He slung him onto the ground in front of him, folding out his claws again.
"Clint, wait..." He wondered why this bothered him so much. Maybe because the other Clint had been the one who kissed him, so...if he was fake, so was anybody caring that much about Bruce. Or something selfish like that.
Turning back to Peter, Steve waved him along.
Hulk… No. That was just odd to think about.
Still, the archer gave him a smile.
"Woah! Hey!" The man stepped forward, tucking away his swords. "Thor! He-ey buddy!" Though they hadn't met before, he obviously knew who the Prince of Thunder was. He looked the blond demigod up and down. "Wow. Looking...awesome." Pausing to stare for a minute, the merc suddenly shook his head and stuck his hands high in the air. "I come in peace!"
"Okay," Pepper said quickly, stepping over to cautiously try touching the bars.
He still hadn’t said a word. Tony placed both hands in his without hesitation, trying not to hope the tears meant what he thought they might. Maybe Steve was mourning their friendship. Maybe he’d screwed it all up. Either way, it hurt to see Steve in tears over him, over his words. He felt a pang in his chest, and remembered a few past conversations from this damned stressful ‘vacation’.
"Please. D-don't," Steve chuckled, leaning on the bed and crawling to his feet. He stood up slowly, half pushing himself to his feet.
"Miss Potts!" He called off into the storm. His only answer was a rumble of thunder from nearby. The wind had grown stronger too, almost knocking him over with every gust.
Weirdly, despite being distracted by the kiss, Tony felt the wind let up, too…
Staring down at him, Wade quirked an eyebrow.
“You’re right,” Tony said, sounding bemused about how things came to this. “The timing’s too close for it to be unrelated, right? And Hulk was still Hulk when he left with Clint.” He glanced at the trail up to the camp again, shaking his head. “Where did they head off to last night? I saw them just go into the trees.”
"We're...up a mountain, aren't we?"
"That sounds like a g-good idea. Are the c-cards working?"
Not yet anyway, Tony thought ominously, smiling at them as they fell into step and started back toward the stairs.
"Let's stop beating around the bush, we already know it's not really him," Tony said dismissively. "The question is who IS he, and how'd he get Bruce that mad?"
“I don’t suppose it was Clint?” Deciding that the waffles were just going to dissolve at that point, Cap picked up the waffle sandwich and took a big bite. It was as good as he had expected. Too bad Peter ran off without breakfast.
"And he went to you to talk about it? Of course he did, it's not like there's somebody with a LIFETIME of experience at all that around here or anything," he grumbled, shoving at Steve's chest to swim down the beach the same way he'd been walking earlier. Of course Peter talked to Cap first--or at all--about this. Tony wasn't exactly what anybody would call reliable. Damn Clint and his damn tequila just made that look even more evident tonight...
The blond turned to rummage in their storage bag, digging out a set of plain metal cups and a container of coffee creamer.
The practically undead man prepared two hotdogs, slapping them onto the stand counter.
Even Bruce wasn’t as big of a worry as Peter, though. What in the world would they do if he didn’t accept their engagement? It would break Steve’s heart, Tony thought, turning to watch the handsome blond gliding through the water nearby. He didn’t want to admit it, but it would break his, too.
The Jotun looked up at him curiously, wondering if Tony ever made him special stretchy clothes.
Pulling his clubs out from under the couch, Matt clicked them back into one long walking stick and stood, flashing a smile at Peter.
"I'm not sure what to do besides try to get them to talk to each other," Peter confessed, glancing over at the redhead. "Matt will hear if Cap's awake, though, so don't worry about that part. What do you guys wanna do, exactly?"
"But you don't think I had anything to do with that...right?" Peter asked with a smile that was a little too wide. So Deadpool had taken Wolverine's motorcycle? Well, Logan's. Peter had never seen him ride it around in his yellow spandex uniform, to be honest.
“I can go to the shop at the edge of the beach and get you a tooth brush and some basics. Is there anything else you need? Sandals? Underwear? A comb?”
"It's a clone or something. I dunno. They think I'm the clone so that's why Thor's been hovering around me all day." Hawkeye sat up, staring at Bruce over the blankets. "…You gonna just sit there?"
“Yeah, with a twenty,” Clint boasted, collecting the cards and shuffling them back into the deck. As fun as it was to play Blackjack with Bruce, he kind of had other things on his mind.
Childish? Yes. Worth saying? Also yes.
“I…wish I hadn’t lost that recipe card,” Steve began, awkwardly wiping at his eyes before taking Tony’s hand again. He kept his eyes low, staring off over Tony’s shoulder. “I had a w-whole speech planned. I never plan speeches, but I didn’t know how to say everything so I thought if I wrote it down, maybe I could just hand it to you and not have to do this. My words are failing me.”
"Bruce, I have a cell phone." The other man said dryly, pulling it from his pocket. He poked at it for a minute and held it to his head. After a really long pause he frowned.
"Refresh my 'memory'," he whispered suspiciously, "why were we talking about Peter's boyfriend last night? Is he a creep or something?"
Clint had figured Cap and Tony out, along with Peter and his crazy boyfriend troubles. But Thor was the most macho man he knew. He liked drinking, brawling and partying. Through all that, Clint was sure that Thor dated some medic lady for awhile, too.
“You know as well as I do that seventeen’s legal in New York,” Tony told Matt, taking a deep breath. “Even eighteen’s still a teenager, though—and a high schooler. And if you know about the whole parental thing, why are you surprised I have a problem with that?” How much had Peter told Matt about them? Wait, did Matt know he was Spider-Man? God, was the Bugle really going around telling the world at large that he and Steve had been together for half a DECADE? Cap hadn’t even been thawed out that long…
"Let's do it...together." Deadpool hauled him along.
“Ooh,” Peter said, and took a seat beside the fire immediately.
"Wait. Not last night, right? Weren't you working on the cure and stuff?" Loki asked as he sat forward on the couch, closing some distance between them. Clearly, the real archer had an effect on the doctor. Consciously or not.
The fact that Tony couldn't tell which it was made the idea of making some painfully honest love confession terrifying, because what if he confessed and he was WRONG? There was no way to take that kind of thing back and leave their friendship intact...
Having eaten his s'more, Peter leaned over and peered at Bruce around Cap, still smiling. He and the scientist didn't exactly cross paths much. Cap wasn't even sure if they'd directly spoken before.
Tilting as he stepped, Wade brushed past Peter and swooped back around the bonfire, stopping by Cap’s side.
“No, no, no. I definitely like you…” The archer trailed off into a mumble, his face pink. Wordlessly, he scooted across the couch cushions and leaned to kiss Bruce’s cheek.
"Does anybody actually like that?" Peter wondered aloud, raising a brow. "Hey, the beach over that way is pretty peaceful. I was just over there sneaking in a phone call." He pointed back the way he had come from. "Quality sand to squish toes in, no frisbee-throwing blond Adonis types, and good cell reception I guess."
"Don't fight..." Bruce was examining the needle he'd been stabbed with unhappily. "Do you know if Tony has any other titanium needles? This one is a biohazard now."
Turning to wrap an arm around him, too, Peter sighed. There was no way he was letting Matt take off in the middle of the night—not only would that seem like prioritizing Wade, but he’d have to tell Cap and Tony SOMETHING about why Matt was gone the next morning.
"I never left, you know." The tired comment managed to make Pepper jump slightly. Glancing quickly, she realized that Dr. Banner was in the far corner of the room, some vials of glowy liquid in his hands and a greenish glint in his eyes.
The blond nodded slowly.
Peter looked at him sidelong and slowly lowered the hotdog away from his mouth rather than taking another bite.
Bruce sighed and patted the injured Loki's forehead.
His fiance didn’t seem chilled, but he was standing around in just his swim trunks. The Arc reactor made the raindrops near it glow blue. Tony turned and leaned into the hug, nodding to Thor.
There were a lot of superheroes in New York that Cap could think of that might be a match for Peter’s wit and good nature.
“There’s a monster in the lake!”
"Ugh, get a room." He headed back over to perch next to Bruce again, sitting his glass of water on the small metal table by the bed.
The blond man stared at her.
"Nothing t-that won't heal with t-time." His wrists were sore from the shackles. Whatever Doctor Doom had made them out of actually had scraped his hands up a bit, but nothing too bad.
He said it dully, without any real conviction behind it.
“Oh, great,” Tony sighed, raking his fingers through his hair. Deep down he’d already known the crashing in the trees last night was Hulk-related, but right on their campsite? Jerk move, Hulk. “We’ll be out in a minute.”
"Neither of you ought to toy with the captain's heart," Thor said, concerned and a bit stern. Tony wondered if he was only bothered now because Loki had shown interest in Cap, too.
“You sure you wanna go inside? The rain’s warm!” Following happily after him, Clint smirked. He tugged on the scientist’s hand and slowed down. “Besides, I’ve got something to say to you.”
The merc was actually quiet...for about ten seconds. He placed a hand on his cheek.
"What...HOW?"
Thor felt too obvious, but it was certainly what the people wanted. Hawkeye was a waste of his time and the Hulk was just unrealistic. There was no way that monster had a mind for romance.
“Nay, the sky unleashed the perfect weather for our plan without any need of my help,” Thor told Peter cheerfully. A huge roll of thunder sounded overhead, shaking the cabin’s walls, and the Asgardian glanced up at the ceiling worriedly. “…Perhaps a bit too much of the perfect weather?”
“What if we can’t get back fast enough and someone dies, Tony?” Cap asked, turning in his seat and frowning at Tony. “There’s a reason we’re stationed in the middle of New York!”
Instead of going to bed, though, Cap ducked back out the door and disappeared out of sight.
"Hawkeye is not recovered, either," he reminded Tony. "Will your antidote cure his ails as well?"
“Nobody got hurt unless you count some trees,” he said flatly. “I’m doing my best not to break the rules, here. Why do you think I’m ‘up to’ something?”
“That does sound like a Loki title,” he admitted.
"I never said he was the real one," the scientist said dully, examining one of the titanium needles from the little case. He sighed. "He's been acting oddly, too."
"...Nothing better happen to him while I'm gone," Tony said finally, a bit irked about the whole thing. For one, the last thing Doom needed was an infinite power source. For two, he couldn't think of any snarky comebacks for the current situation.
"Here goes...what?"
“Tony! We have a medical emergency!” Cap was shouting, waving to who Peter guessed was Tony.
“Enough,” Cap sighed, suddenly aware of how many times villains had probably been trying to flirt with him. Oh boy, there was a thought. He hadn’t been so aware of handsome men making eyes at him before he started falling for Tony.
They scooted shoulder to shoulder, eyes locked on the other like he was going to shank him at any moment. Then the shirtless one looked up at Thor expectantly.
A red masked face popped up into view. For a second, she could have mistaken it for Spider-Man, but this mask was different.
"You were given the word of Doom," the masked man replied, as if that explained everything. He stirred the beaker and held it up to the light of the chandelier to examine it.
"I...do not know anymore," Thor admitted, looking guilty to be saying so. He looked down at the floor. "Jane Foster has not spoken to me in a very long time. While I still hold great regard for her, I cannot truly say that we are lovers—not when we have been apart so long with nothing to prevent either from contacting the other."
"I'll get you some painkillers soon," Bruce assured Loki. He looked like he was spacing out a bit; Hawkeye stabbing the arrow into the table hadn't even phased him.
"...Must keep them from harm," Thor was saying from the card as Hawkeye darted up next to Bruce.
Bruce wandered in through the door, glancing around. With his stubble and messy hair, the very casual hoodie and sneakers he wore with his jeans, and the slouchy elbows-to-your-sides posture, the scientist looked decidedly out of place in the photography-worthy perfection of the cabin.
The merc followed her quickly—mostly because she was the only one moving.
"You're not in any shape to hunt anybody down," Bruce said, looking carefully ahead of them as they started up the next flight of stairs. "And we're working on the rest...checking on Cap's cure, to help Tony. I can do that and still consider your safety."
"Oh man. Then we'll never find him!" The archer groaned.
“He seemed kinda nervous,” Clint observed, raising an eyebrow. Or just really uncomfortable. With as much guff as Clint gave him and Tony, the man was as patient as a saint. Reluctant to let go of the scientist’s hand, Clint lingered for a minute. “I think he and Tony aren’t gonna work it out. Every time I see them, they look either pissed or miserable.”
“You being old doesn’t make me a kid, you know. I’m 18,” he said, crossing his arms. Wade seemed to have completely forgotten the whole ‘pretend we’re just friends when around other people’ plan in the heat of the moment. Great.
“Are you serious? Yes. Wade likes you…really likes you. I’m shocked it took you this long to figure it out. Subtlety isn’t his specialty.”
"Um. No?" Peter smiled sheepishly at him. "You have a whole recipe for these, huh?" He knew meatballs generally had bread crumbs or something in them, but he'd never made them at home. Wow, Cap really could cook if he had the recipe memorized!
As they arrived at the door, Matt slipped his arm out of Peter’s and knocked loudly. It was impossible to hear if there was any movement from inside with all the noise from the storm, but after a moment, the door pulled open to reveal T’challa.
“My new friends?” Loki asked with an air of innocence as he glanced back at the camp full of people. Turning back to his brother, his smiled turned wicked. “Well, you could say they’re companions, witnesses…collateral. Only a fool goes camping alone. Haven’t you heard? There are more than bears in these woods.”
Trudging across the sand, he started up the steps to the cabin.
Clint stared. Never once had he seen the Hulk willingly turn back into Bruce. His mouth hung open as he hurried over. He slid his vest off and offered it to his friend.
"Hm. Not if you are dead." Loki said, eying the arc reactor.
“…Okay, then,” Tony commented after they had disappeared down the trail. He adjusted the coffee pot on the flames a bit, listening to it start to chuff as the water heated enough to begin perking. “Guess that leaves you, Clint. Lake time with the team?”
"Yeah, exactly how old IS he, anyway?" Tony butted in, exchanging a glance with Steve. Oh, no. This was bad. For one thing, Peter didn't actually know Wade's age, and for two, he was pretty sure it would sound way older than he looked, even. He stood there for a long moment, willing his eyes to be as misty as he could make them. Blinking a few times, he focused on the fire and let his shoulders slump defeatedly.
"Nice save!" Tony cheered from the doorway, even clapping his hands a few times. Loki could see his obnoxious smirk from here.
"Forget it."
Spitting out sand, Clint coughed into his arm. He’d awakened with a start—and a POUNDING headache—belly down on the beach. The sun was already up, and he was dismayed to see lots of people walking around. Thankfully, he was laying in a little alcove of sorts. Still spitting out grit, he was considering standing when he noticed there was a body beside him.
Why was taking him to Tony the default action? Most people would have taken him to the medical room.
He hadn’t noticed before, but Tony was over on the beach where Cap was too, perched in a lounge chair with a drink. Hey, maybe they worked out whatever was bothering them the day before.
“Hey, babes, why don’t we go back to the fun tent and go mano a mano, if y’know what I mean!” Wade stood and tossed the book over his shoulder—which hit Clint square in the chest.
"So even you aren't too dumb to understand that much," Doom said drolly, giving him a sort of shove at the table. "Sit."
"Most interesting," Doom said, unfazed by the transformation. He crossed his arms. "I had my suspicions when you did not possess an Avengers card like the Captain. What brings a 'god' like you to Doom?"
Giving them a tight smile, he headed for the door.
Pepper seemed like she was about to say something about it—again—when there was a little crackle of the radio in the Iron Man helmet on the floor.
“So you’re recruiting the team to strand your leaders out at sea? Wow. I hope they don’t think this is mutiny,” Matt told them dubiously.
Doom offered a metal-plated hand to the blond, standing up straight and looking rather imposing in the process. "Come with me."
The super soldier nodded, but didn't reply. What in the world would Doom want with Thor? Of all the villains Captain America knew of, Loki was one of the few that would ever actually WANT Thor's attention.
Bruce seated himself on the edge of the couch beside Loki, taking one of the gauze pads and placing it over the injury before carefully pressing it there with one palm.
He had peeked in on everyone and was worried when he found Clint and Bruce missing—until he remembered all the strange conversations he had had with everyone the day before. Them both being missing was proof enough to Cap that the two might be sweethearts.
The bow was yanked from Loki’s hand while he was distracted by the memories of being struck by lightning. Hawkeye pulled another arrow from his quiver— unceremoniously stabbing Loki in the side with it.
"I..." Cap started, before realizing that was sarcasm. Well, at least Tony was alright then. He turned back and gave Tony a smile. "Don't worry. I learned how to sew on buttons during the war.." Gently patting the black haired man's arm, he pulled Tony's shirt closed. It blocked some of the light, but Tony had been laying on the chilly basement floor for long enough. Holding in any heat was important.
"It's, er, it's after midnight," Bruce informed him awkwardly, pointing at his watch. The one he'd forgotten he was wearing when wondering about the time earlier...apparently he'd used up all of his brain processing power on those papers.
"Okay." Clint groaned, tossing his hands up. "There you go again. What did I do?"
"Have I missed the cursed shark beings that think themselves gods?!" Thor sat down beside Clint and handed him the bowl since he was in the middle of the couch.
“Are we already at the grilling stage? Yikes.”
“Loki!” Thor bobbed in the water beside the camp, looking up at an all-too-familiar slender form in a forest green suit. His long black hair was loose from its usual ponytail, trailing freely down his back, but there was no mistaking Thor’s brother for anybody else.
Nervous all of a sudden, Loki laughed lightly, squeezing Thor’s hands.
Tony snorted in amusement.
Just as Steve was contemplating what in the room was round and usable as a makeshift shield, Doom's metallic footsteps sounded from the hallway. He was returning with a tray full of beakers? Because that didn't look ominous.
"'Too'?" Peter asked, exchanging a glance with Johnny. "I thought Tony got everybody back from Doom last night?"
Clint didn't take it, just looking around the room casually.
"Wait Clint. You c-can't fight right n-now," Cap protested, storming after him.
Bruce froze and stood there stiffly. The needle—the TITANIUM needle—had just stabbed right into the base of his hand below his thumb. Bruce gritted his teeth and stayed remarkably calm about it.
Steve stared at Clint and then up at Thor.
Without waiting for a reply, he rocketed past her toward the mansion. The shield was based on Stark tech, so it would probably hold for a few minutes.
Thor only looked at him oddly before stepping into the main entrance hall of the mansion. The place was gloomy and creepy with the low lighting flickering. The storm was much less severe now that Thor wasn't out there provoking it, though.
Thor placed a hand on Loki's chest, looking at him sadly.
"Uh, no. Just wondering what's taking you guys so long to check out an abandoned tower. What are you looking at over there? Security footage of empty hallways?" The archer sounded irritated and more than a little stressed.
Pressing a hand to Tony’s back, Cap led him up the steps silently. They couldn’t talk there and the cabin was about to have the entire team camped out inside.
Tony mumbled something about muscles and swigged the last of the coffee in his mug.
"Oh please. I know wishful thinking when I hear it." Loki said drolly, glancing at Thor. “But, if you like, I know a bit of magic...” Loki trailed off, giving Tony a wink.
“I doubt that Loki will make any moves tonight,” Thor said, holding up his hand for Mjolnir already, “But I will gladly assist, of course!” The magic hammer came singing through the air to Thor’s palm. Catching it, he whirled it in a circle and took off into the sky, thunder rolling like his own personal special effects at that very moment.
Whatever Doctor Doom had used in the bomb, it probably wasn't meant to be in his lungs this long.
“It kind of sounds like a bad joke,” Bruce replied dryly, crossing his arms. His gaze flicked to Clint, his eyes far greener than his steady tone gave away, and then he focused on Cap and Tony again.
“Pepper called when it was my turn to drive. Um, she said that the beach ISN’T private. The vacation cabin owner just REALLY wanted your business. So, he’s right.” He gestured to Spidey.
"The Four!" Thor's attention was captured. "Storm was here last night with us. Perhaps that is why he was not taken?"
"Banner says you bled too much!" The Hulk's voice was already startling enough without the rise in volume that came with annoyance. "Don't. Sleep."
