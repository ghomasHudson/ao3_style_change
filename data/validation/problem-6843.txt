It was a way down, so there was no way Bruce had been the one to swim out of there. He had to have been in Big Green Machine mode. Unless he’d jumped out before the jet had gone down. He doubted it though. Banner hadn’t been one for heights. That had been Hulk’s thing.
Taking comfort from robot hugs was beyond embarrassing, Tony thought. He didn’t pull away though, dropping his forehead onto the soft cushion he’d put onto DUM-E’s shoulder for precisely this reason.
“Lead on, MacDuff,” Tony said. Jörmungandr gave a him a leery look, but turned, heading back into the tunnel he’d come from.
“You know that denial ain’t no river in Egypt, right?” Rhodey shook his head. “I think you might have become revirginated. I’m worried about you not getting any while you pine away for the boy who ran.”
“I brought you one better,” Natasha said with a wink that made Bruce blush. She reached into her backpack and pulled out a hissing animal that looked like a cross between a cat and a raccoon by the scruff of its neck. “Meet Matilda.”
DUM-E beeped in question, trundling towards him. “No, stay there, bad DUM-E!” But the robot wasn’t to be denied. Its arms reached out to Tony and drew him in.
The door to his suite slid open a minute later, and Steve rushed in, with Bucky at his heels. “Tony!” Steve dropped to his knees beside him. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. said that you were acting weird and that you said I was dead?”
“Uh, okay, that’s good to know.” Bruce’s mild voice had Tony spinning around, a smile already widening his face.
“He did it with anyone who hurt him,” Rhodes corrected. “The fact that you’re here, that he’s talking to you, that he’s willing to work with you again… It’s huge. Tony doesn’t give second chances. Ever. Don’t fuck it up.”
Pepper scanned the notes. “Thor, is there something you haven’t been telling us?” she asked, looking up at him a minute or so later.
Tony collapsed onto the nearest surface as though his strings had been cut. “I think this might be part where we all wake up and find out that this has been a terrible dream.” He looked to where Bucky had vanished. “Shit.”
“Pepper isn’t used to risking her life on a daily basis. I am. Plus, I can watch your back. I did it for years.” He rubbed his thumb carefully across Tony’s cheekbone. “I’d like to be given the chance to do that again.”
“My cloak has a fascination with things it cannot understand,” Strange replied. “Now that we know the Soul Stone lies within the blood of Tony Stark, it makes more sense.”
“Bed time,” Bruce affirmed, pulling her gently to her feet. Steve hid a smile at how easily she seemed to fold into Bruce’s embrace. She wouldn’t appreciate the observation. Any appearance of weakness was usually greeted with scorn.
“I need a vacation,” Steve grumbled. “We’re on our way to you. We’ll pick you up in fifteen minutes.” It was Steve’s turn to cut the call.
“I just wanted to hold you,” Steve said, a gentleness to the next kiss directly on Tony’s mouth. “I know how much pain you’re in.”
“Tony, I was looking for Steve.” Bucky’s voice had them springing apart, hurtling towards opposite ends of the workroom with embarrassing speed.
Matilda jumped off the bed, heading straight for Steve. She twined around his legs with a plaintive mrrraoooww. “I guess it’s the easy way then,” Steve said. He bent down and picked her up, careful of those sharp claws and teeth. She settled into his arms easily, a soft purr the only noise.
“I did,” Natasha said. “He told me that he agreed with Tony, that the world would be safer without the Avengers. That we were, we
the problem, scaring the bejeesus out of Steve. He still had nightmares about a tear in the universe closing, and just before the dark disappeared, a shining red and gold missile dropping to the earth like a stone. Falling, falling, fall...
Tony wanted to smack his forehead. “You two deserve each other,” he muttered. “So, how do I get to the Most Holy?”
“Then you heard my voice and everything else went out the window.” Bucky's dry tone had Steve smothering a smile. “I guess some things haven't changed, Stevie. You're still a one-track mind kinda kid.”
“We should shower together,” Tony said around his toothbrush. “Save water. Protect the environment.” He was distracted by the miles of flesh in front of him. Neither Steve nor Bucky seemed to be particularly worried that they were nude. It had taken years for Tony not to flinch at the sight of the scar in the center of his own chest.
“It is a legitimate complaint,” Tony insisted. “I think Viz gets a little thrill out of making me jump out of my skin.”
“Are innocent,” Tony said as exhaustion finally set in. “He’s the only one in this entire shit-show who actually has nothing to be sorry for.” He waved a hand at Barnes. “I’ve got a car waiting, let’s go.” He met Pepper’s outraged gaze. “I’m semi-okay with this, Pep. Barnes is maybe the best one to actually start with.”
“Viz, I’m tired, I’m pissed off at Tony and these douchebags, just let us in, alright?” Rhodes shouldered past the android, patting him on the back as he went. “Do me a favor and show them where they’re bunking down, please. I need to find out how much longer before Tony gets here.”
Tony ducked as a car crashed into a pole nearby him. Steve muscled him out of the way. “Be careful,” he said. Tony didn’t miss that Sam and the Soldier were flanking Cap.
“Is Atlantis just messing with us?” Clint whispered to Steve. “I mean, Thor's been alone for what, a hundred years, and now suddenly the poisonous not-cat that bit Tony is his long-lost brother?”
“Tony?” Rhodey waved a hand in front of Tony’s face but there was still no response. Clint, Sam and Natasha held on to Loki as Bucky, Steve and Rhodey tried to get something out of Tony.
“I was taught hand to hand combat from the moment I could walk,” Thor said. “My father told me that many would try to kill me as a babe and that I needed to be prepared.”
Steve grabbed his arm on the next pass, swinging him around to face him. “Tony, don’t you get it? It’s not the suit that makes you Iron Man. It’s you that makes the suit. It always has been.
“No, no,” Strange said, holding up a hand, pacing the room. “This makes sense of some of the things I’ve been seeing as I’ve been watching the universal timeline.”
“And the proviso?” Rhodey, ever vigilant to defend Tony’s long-wished-for-absent virtue, stepped up next to Tony. Pepper dug an angry elbow into his ribs and he squawked, stepping back quickly.
“Don’t believe everything you see.” Tony lifted his lip, baring his teeth in irritation. Steve had said that
The shush-shush of the wind that shouldn’t exist was his answer. “Does she know how creepy that is?” Clint edged a little closer to Natasha.
“Because you’d kill Lucifer to gain his powers.” Tony had a lifetime of messed-up family dysfunction behind him.
“There’s nowhere else for us to go.” Something wrenched at Steve’s heart as he said it. “Tony’s offering us refuge.”
“Hi.” Steve knew he looked stupid sitting on the bed smiling like a crazy person at Bucky, but he couldn’t help it.
“Are you sure you want to stay with this particular experiment?” Jarvis asked once Pepper and Rhodey had left. “I mean, nothing about it is stable.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair. “I’ve been a terrible boyfriend.” He frowned. “That sounds so high school.”
“Ah yes,” Tony snorted. “Like the Time Stone that’s in the Eye of Agamotto, and in the hands of an egomaniac.”
Her scowl wasn’t her best. Tony could still see the fear in her eyes and was so mad that he’d put it there. Pepper pushed him out of the hospital room and stopped cold.
Nobody answered. Tony hadn't expected him to. “Fine,” he muttered. “You always have to do things the fucking hard way, Bruce. I'm going to make you pay for this in research for the rest of your life.”
Bucky’s eyes twinkled. “I’ve been reliably informed that the pretty boy I’ve got my eye on is for sale.”
He glided away, cloak waving in a non-existent wind. They silently trooped into their new residence.
Sam’s gaze went to the bed. He walked over and shook the phone out of it. “What’s this?” he asked, holding it up to Steve.
“Aye, he has one.” Thor’s annoyance was audible. “I think perhaps I should handle this business on my own.”
He waved her apology away. “Bygones. Besides, who else would keep DUM-E and U busy if your monsters weren’t around?”
“I get a new arm.” Bucky’s flat statement had Tony staring at him again. “You didn’t ask anything from me. You took me in, took care of me, gave me hope and never asked for a goddam thing.”
,” he mumbled. He tumbled off his chair and crawled under his workbench which, all things considered, was an appropriate response.
“And so you are.” She held out a hand. “You dreamt of a life where you and our captain were in love.”
Steve was tempted to take a photo with his phone but he decided that Natasha would probably exact revenge in an extremely unpleasant way.
“Gotta catch me first!” he yelled from the safety of Pepper’s back. He pressed a kiss to her blushing cheek. “Go get him, tiger.”
Steve realizes Tony was serious. Bucky has a breakthrough. Home sweet home. ScienceBros get to work.
Steve chuckled. “Don’t be long.” He didn’t want Tony to realize just how much he wanted to go with him. He felt an almost pathological need to keep Tony in view right now.
“How about you try it again?” Bucky suggested. There was something in his eyes, something that almost looked like a dare.
“Why don’t you get some sleep, Tony?” Pepper urged. “You’ve been awake for almost two days straight with the revising of the Accords and the signing of the new draft. I’ll make sure they settle in here. You don’t need to deal with them at all.”
Tony listened again to words that nobody else could hear. It made Steve clench his jaw. He wasn't jealous dammit.
Bucky nodded and shrugged. “I’ve spent a lot of time working in surveillance over the past several decades. I’ve learned how to disappear into the shadows.”
“I’m completely insane,” Steve said, rubbing his eyes. His mouth was still a little swollen from their kiss and Tony was easily distracted. “Bucky is bad enough, but adding you to the mix is like mixing fire and gasoline.”
“That’s because I feel like I’m going fucking insane,” Tony told her. “These Winchesters, I need to know more about them. Everything you can find.”
Tony almost fell over. “A compliment?” He held one hand to his chest. “I do declare, suh…” with his best southern belle imitation.
“I can ask Heimdall if we have any space-faring vessels that can be used to travel through multiple universes,” Thor said.
Thor’s eyes flashed dangerously. “And you think I forget this for even one moment?” he demanded. “I am sick to my stomach. My mother is dead, my father is I know not where, my brother is ….” He stopped, chest heaving.
“You’re both idiots.” Natasha looked down at them. “Move over,” she ordered Clint. He obliged, letting her drape her legs over his while Sam picked up the remote and pointed it at the huge television.
He could feel the Power Stone. It seemed almost sentient as it sent tendrils of energy through Tony’s body, finding places where bones had been broken, veins had been sliced open, arteries had been cauterised. He held Tony as he screamed in pain, as his body was forced into an accelerated healing that it wasn’t prepared for.
“How about this?” Tony held up a hand. “We all know that I’m the king of game, so here’s a challenge.” Both Steve and Bucky looked at him. “Hey, doubting Thomases, just hear me out.”
Tony mumbled something in his sleep, moved his head so that his face was pressed into the skin at Bucky’s throat. Steve didn’t even try to hide his smile. “He’s awful cute when he’s sleeping, isn’t he?”
Tony’s face sobered. “I know, Steve. I swear, I won’t do anything to jeopardize you or the team,” Tony promised.
She patted his shoulder. “Not recently, but please, Captain, you know that I am uncomfortable with your Earth forms of affection.”
Thor put a hand on Loki’s shoulder. The flinch was visible. “According to Heimdall, the Collector is in this universe.”
“How about giving me the fucking benefit of the doubt,” Tony snapped back. “If the meeting doesn’t go well, then believe me, I will fill you all in.”
Tony was more than a little in love. Steve Rogers was nothing like the guy his dad had waxed lyrical about. His Aunt Peggy though, she’d been right on the money. Captain America was a bit of a dork, straight as an arrow, and kinda evil. He was perfect.
Tony eyed him. Bruce already looked better, less my-life-is-an-endless-tragedy and more my-awesome-bro-came-to-take-me-home.
“And that’s my cue, lady and gentlemen,” Clint said, standing abruptly. “I have groveling to do and a marriage to save.” He brushed Natasha’s cheek with a gentle hand. “Stark loves you, Tasha. He’s already forgiven you.” Clint was still the only one who called her Tasha. Their history made them family like Tony and Rhodes were family.
Tony turned his gaze back to him. “Take care of Bucky, okay?” He tried to smile but it felt wrong on his face.
Steve burned hot and cold. He bucked up into Tony’s mouth, the wet suction a mind-blowing contrast to the tight grip on his dick.
Tony, being the leery bastard his father had raised, googled them, and was horrified to see them show up on several FBI Most Wanted sites. And then be listed as ‘deceased’.
Both the Winchesters looked supremely uncomfortable. “They’re a bit pissed at me since I killed Death,” Dean admitted.
“Bi, not gay,” Tony corrected. “Like me.” He was not going to think about the absurdity of the two finest minds on earth sitting in a forest debating Captain America's sexual orientation.
“Maybe take a couple of Marines and go back to that planet?” Steve suggested. “There might be a clue as to what Matilda is or something?” He felt completely helpless.
Steve licked his lips. This was something he’d not dreamed of having. Somehow, someway, just that one tiny change, his arrival in Tony’s life before Rhodes found him, had changed everything.
“He's not a monster.” Natasha's voice was like ice. “His name is Bruce Banner, and he's not a monster.” She glared at Wanda.
“Right. Where would a one thousand pound, eight foot tall, green rage monster go for some peace and quiet?” He locked up his room and strolled down the corridor.
Desperate to change the subject, Steve looked at Vision. “After all that, did you actually tell Thor and Loki that dinner was up?” Vision still appeared a little shell-shocked. Tony was never going to let this go.
He ran something that looked like the scanner used at airports to check for metal objects over Bucky’s head. There was no sound. “That’s good,’ he said. “Not picking up any nanite activity. Looks like the gamma-knife worked.”
And then Steve was on his feet, striding towards Tony. “I think it’s better if I sit here,” he said as he sat down in the chair Pepper had just vacated, at Tony’s side. “Seems more appropriate, since you’re the boss now.”
Bruce gave Tony a little shove. Tony fell back onto his bed with a startled squeak. “Oh. Em. Gee.” Bruce rolled his eyes. “You’re so original, Tony.”
Fingers deep within the bowels of a particle accelerator, Tony convinced himself that he was fine like this, that he preferred the house echoing in silence. He’d always been good at putting things away, filing them so that they didn’t bother him.
Tony caught a movement from the corner of his eye. Bucky and Bruce stood watching him. “We have company,” he told Steve.
Tony shook his head slowly. “This really isn’t the time, you were right earlier, but yeah, you, me, Bucky…I want it. I want us” He swallowed hard, eyes very vulnerable.
Tony stared between them. They were grinning at each other like crazy people. Bat-shit crazy people who adored each other more than life. He wanted them to look at him that way. Tony’s heart jumped. Stupid, stupid heart.
“Perhaps you would care to see my quarters in this fine establishment, brother?” Thor looked like a giant puppy hoping for approval, Steve thought.
And just like that, it slipped away, bleeding back into Tony’s body like some terrible metallic slug.
“Hopefully Rhodey keeps them a little in control,” Steve said, yawning behind his hand. “I’m just glad that Tony has been otherwise occupied.”
The cloak slipped away from Tony reluctantly. Steve could swear he heard it make a whimpering sound. It curled around Strange’s shoulders again, hanging limply around him. “I’ll be back when you’ve won.” He moved his hands, opening a door in the air in front of him. He stepped through the hole in space and time and vanished.
Rhodey shifted, holding Tony up. “You made Nat’s day,” he said and Tony could feel the smile against his hair.
“For the safety of the world, yes.” Coulson met her gaze with more calm than Steve would have. An angry Natasha was a terrifying thing. “Did you miss me, Agent Romanoff?”
He didn’t realize that he’d asked the question out loud until Natasha replied, “Tony has a way of getting people to think along his lines. And most of the time they end up thinking that it was all their idea anyway.” Natasha still wouldn’t look at Steve.
Bucky’s smile was small. “I know,” he said. “I’ll kick his ass if he doesn’t.” He squeezed Steve’s hand.
Tony turned his head so that he could kiss Bucky. Steve wondered what he tasted like. He wanted to know. “Just setting some ground-rules,” Tony murmured against Bucky’s lips. “Otherwise this is going to get very messy.”
There was an air of resignation in the jet. Steve couldn’t bring himself to look around at his team.
Tony resisted the appeal of those stupid biceps. “Actually, I have a couple of doctorates, but that’s not the point.” He stared at Steve. “I’m always Tony. Or if you’re pissed off at me, then it’s Stark.” He frowned. “Where did that come from?”
Steve was abruptly furious all over again. “Is that so unbelievable, Buck?” He knew he was closer to the shouting end of the vocal scale, but he was so pissed off. “My best friend, the one I’ve been searching for, decides to shack up with one of my other friends who, I’m reliably told, swings both ways. What the hell am I supposed to think?”
“He is able to see into the near future,” Thor offered. “It might assist our request if we tell him to look at the consequences of not getting the Reality Stone.”
“What did you do to Tony?” Natasha had less hesitation than he did. She’d heard what T’Challa had told Steve and her loyalty had ultimately always been to Tony.
Tony and Bucky decided that the best option, while waiting for Steve to arrive with his hurt face and angry eyes, was to get blindingly drunk.
She smirked. “Good boy.” She tipped her head towards the bathroom and Tony scurried in obediently, clutching his clothes to his chest as though somehow they would protect him from her.
Tony moved away from the safety that Vision had sort of provided and sauntered towards Bruce and Pepper. “I think we’ll call that a tie,” he said with a grin.
Bucky kissed the way Tony kissed, Steve thought, a little dazed by the feelings punching through him. Purpose and determined fire behind every flick of tongue. It was a little like stepping into a wildfire.
“Uh….” Yeah, the mention of Bucky and sparring in one sentence was clearly enough to short-circuit Steve’s brain. It was a little humiliating actually.
Natasha walked over to her, put a hand on Wanda’s where the tendrils of crimson were beginning to seep out. “Not now, Wanda. Not yet.” She waited for Wanda to look at her, for the scarlet to bleed from her eyes.
Steve grinned. “Like this?” A third finger made Tony feel like he was going to split apart. In the best possible way.
“Mr. Stark asked that you come to his laboratory as soon as you can,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. hedged. “He wishes to introduce you to him.”
Steve followed Sam and Dean, holding the creatures at bay while still edging towards the thicket of trees. Bucky whooped like a lunatic beside him, punching and shooting at everything that moved.
This was something he’d thought long and hard about. His chest hurt but it was the right thing to do. “James Buchanan Barnes was,
“You’re back!” Her shoulders dropped with relief. The kids were only too happy to desert their homework and hurl themselves at Tony. Lila and Cooper each grabbed a leg and clung.
“And you came here?” Tony asked. “Talk about frying pan and fire.” He waved at the sofa in the corner. “Sit down over there, and shut up.” Steve was going to be distracting enough, Tony thought. This might not be a good idea.
“Takes one to know one, Iron Baby.” Bucky’s sardonic reply had Tony lifting his head to glare at him.
They kissed slowly, lazily, learning each other’s mouths. Tony hadn’t had much of a chance to kiss Bucky last night. Steve had been too busy with that.
“Hitched a ride, huh?” Tony said, ignoring her, mind working at warp speed. “I’m guessing the prodigal children gave you a lift.” He wasn’t sure how he felt about it, but was pretty glad that he’d ripped off the cardiac sensors.
“I’m not perfect, Colonel,” Steve said with a sigh. “I know I’ve fucked up. And not just with Tony. Clint, Sam, Natasha, Scott, god, even poor, sad, misguided Wanda. I’ve made more mistakes than I know how to count, but I can promise you this one thing. If I betray Tony again, I’ll help you end me.”
Thor nodded. “It has not been an easy time of it in Asgard.” He sighed, sitting down on one of the sofas and completely ignoring the tension that had permeated the room prior to his arrival.
“Thanks for not killing me.” This was said softly, as though Bucky wasn’t sure it was okay to thank him for that.
“Yes,” Bruce nodded. “I’ve been trying to use string theory to figure out a way to keep those six sides from never touching, to put it simply.”
“I was a mess.” Bucky had never been the sort to beat around the bush. “I was remembering things in patches, bits and pieces that wouldn’t fit together.” He took a deep breath. “Tony let me be. He didn’t push.”
“That’s okay.” Bucky waved his words away. “Steve and I are amazing at relationships. We’ll keep you in line.”
So I've been wrestling with this one for about 2 weeks. Most of it was written before Infinity War. I'm still not sure about it. But then this was always how I'd planned for it to go down so here goes.... I'm so very sorry :(
“Have to,” Tony kissed him quickly. “Kinda part of the whole superhero gig.” He moved out of Bucky’s reach, knowing that if he stayed any longer, he’d never leave. “Let’s go, Doc.”
Tony spun on his heel. “I promise I will explain everything.” He grinned at Steve, a wild light in his eyes. “Once I understand it myself.”
“I am pleased that I could be of assistance to you, my friends,” Thor boomed. “I had Heimdall watching your progress quote closely.”
“There are some compromises that Tony Stark made, but I do think that you will be much more prepared to sign the new version of the Sokovia Accords.” T’Challa’s gaze was kind. “You will be able to go home soon, Steve.”
Steve sat up on the chair when Matilda’s weight changed. The man draped over him had long dark hair and a sharp face, almost feline in his prettiness. He was also not wearing anything at all. Steve tried his hardest to ignore that.
Later, back at the new Avengers facility, he and Steve watched Thor leave in that incandescent column of light.
Tony kept his arms around Bucky as Clint landed the jet. One hand was still holding onto Steve. It felt slightly surreal and completely natural.
The President waved Rhodey off. “We’re all fine. He didn’t do anything to us except somehow stop us from talking.”
DUM-E made a sound of fear and Tony reached back to pat him. “We’re okay, buddy. Right, Steve?” He lifted his chin.
“How are you doing?” Steve asked. It felt like they could only talk in whispers. It was a question they all asked each other. Every day.
“God,” Steve groaned, dropping his face into his arms as he rested them on the table. “Even Bucky is better at living in this time than I am and he’s basically been a zombie for seventy plus years!”
He wondered if there was going to be price to pay. There was always a price for happiness. But for this, Steve would pay just about anything.
Tony felt as though the foundations beneath his feet were wobbling dangerously. “You’re gay?” he squeaked.
“What do you want from me?” Tony asked Steve then. He was starting to fidget under that penetrating gaze.
May shrugged. “Eh, I squash ‘em all.” Scott went a little pale. Steve caught the slightest curve of May’s lips as she climbed on board.
“I’m glad that someone has,” Tony muttered. He dug in his pocket for the Reality Stone. “Okay, time to do your thing.”
“This is fascinating,” Strange said, sounding anything but fascinated. “Whoever is coming with us, please step through the portal?”
“We’re the Avengers.” It was as simple as that to Steve. And it was one of the myriad reasons that Tony adored him. “If we don’t do it, then who will?”
“Mr. Stark instructed me to inform you as soon as you woke,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. told him. “He was concerned you would worry.”
the chair used to condition the Winter Soldier from the Ideal Federal Savings Bank where Alexander Pierce had kindly left it.” Tony leveled a glare at the machine. “I decided that it needed to be put to use for something positive instead of the evil that HYDRA had perpetuated.” He refused to think about who could possibly be watching this. The idea that a certain star –spangled man with a plan and his war buddy might see it wasn’t anywhere near a thought.
“Oh my god, what is wrong with you?” Rhodey screwed up his face in disgust. “You are the most warped asshole I’ve ever known!”
“Because, you giant frosty bag of dicks, once the snake has swallowed up Asgard and Earth, then it will want more food. Tell me, where do you suppose it’s going to look next?” He paused, waiting for the asshole to catch up.
“Well, something must have clicked in, because when I got here and you were all 'Grr!Argghh! Hulk! Smash!' it only took a minute or so for Bruce to take over.” Tony waited for that bit of information to sink in. “And I didn't even have to sing!”
Tony held her close. “I love you too, Pep,” he said into her hair. “I’m like a noxious weed. You’re not getting rid of me that easily.”
“I rather think it does.” It was Hogan who said that, the twang and flattened vowels identifying him as Australian. “Why are you wanting the Accords changed?”
Dean and Sam were in the kitchen when they finally came down. Steve had ridiculous beard burn down the side of his neck that Tony was exceptionally proud of.
Rhodey stared at him. “What?” He sounded shocked. Steve was a lot more cynical these days. Nothing much surprised him about this brave new world he’d woken up in.
“You are certifiable,” Bruce mused. “Not one other person on earth would drink whatever the hell that robot has put in that glass.”
“I mean that the changing political landscape shows that it is only reasonable for all ‘super’ heroes to have proper training and oversight,” Ross corrected. “It just makes sense to know who to call, and
There were questions still to be answered. They needed to figure out how to help Thor save Loki. Tony was surely busy planning something to create havoc with them all because heaven forbid he actually stop meddling with powers he can’t understand.
more dramatic,” Natasha said from her seat. “Glass tends to shatter when he gets a little too excited.” Thor grinned at her.
“There’s something different about you.” Bruce peered into his eyes. Bruce had always been perceptive, Tony thought.
He shoved away from the table. Even though he and Pepper had been done for a long time in his memory, it still hurt him to hurt her. At least this time around he’d broken it off before she hated him.
He smiled. “My Jane has agreed to return with me for as long as I am needed. It has made my task less onerous.”
There was an ominous beeping sound from the bed and Bruce scurried over. “Whatever you guys are going to do, do it fast. We have a matter of hours left before his heart is completely destroyed.”
“That's a complete lie, Tony Stark, and you know it!” Pepper's voice behind them had Tony realize that she was actually
“So do I.” The voice from the doorway had them all looking up. War Machine stood with his hands on his hips. “What did y’all do to him?”
Tony glared. “I’ve been working my fingers to the bone trying to save the universe and you want to deny me my Bucky nookie?” He grinned when Steve shoved him off the armrest.
And suddenly Tony couldn’t bear it anymore. “No, you really didn’t need to be. I mean, you’re out there being Captain America, training the troops to save us from our next disaster. Why would you need to be here for me? I’m not even Iron Man anymore. Not like you care.” Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. He needed to learn to shut up and stop while he still had a tiny bit of dignity left.
He waved at Vision to continue. In the image, Bruce twitched in the chair, flinching at something that only he could see.  Tony waited until the clip got to the point where the memory appeared like a mini film within a film in the middle of the lab. “Pause it there please, Viz,” he asked. “So, B.A.R.F. basically relies on an implant installed on a pair of glasses, the pair you see there on Dr. Banner’s face. The implant connects with the user's hippocampus, allowing it to find a certain traumatic memory and alter it before projecting that memory onto an external infrastructure.” He paused. “Through the altered projection, the user is able to successfully re-experience and hopefully work through overcoming traumatic experiences. What you’re about to see is Dr. Banner re-experiencing what he felt was the worst moment of his time as the Hulk.” He nodded to Vision one last time.
“I believe you are correct,” Vision replied. His eyes were fixed on the formulas scrolling across the screens.
“No,” Tony said, kicking at the squat beast that was knocking at his knees with vicious teeth. “You don’t say?”
Bucky chuckled again. “I know you didn’t mean it that way,” he assured him. “Things sure have changed since our time.”
“Tony didn’t appreciate the comparison,” Steve concurred. “Our first meeting was inauspicious to say the least.” His coffee was cold now, its only purpose to keep his hands occupied. “But then, after the battle of New York, he invited us all to stay with him in the Tower.” He met Rhodes’ eyes. “Who does that?”
“Don’t do anything stupid,” Steve warned him. “If Loki seems pissed off or dangerous, get out of there. Get a lay of the land and get out of there.”
T’Challa arrived late the next day. There had been nothing more on the news about what had happened in the closed-door meeting. Clint had tried to pry the information out of Laura who had told him to fuck himself and had refused to answer his calls.
Steve could see the slight flush on Tony’s cheeks though. Plus Tony glanced out at him from the corner of his eyes several times, as though he couldn’t believe Steve
He looked over to where Wanda crouched over Vision, her eyes lifting once more to meet his as she disintegrated.
“Hi.” The squeak and wave didn’t do his street cred any good. But she was honest to god terrifying. He cleared his throat. “I mean, hi.” It only sounded marginally better.
Lee led them to the entrance of the White House. “To be honest, I’m not entirely sure what happened, sir.” He seemed bewildered. “This guy just appeared in the Joint Chiefs meeting and blasted the President’s security detail. The next thing we knew, we were locked out of the Situation Room with the President, the Vice President and several of the Joint Chiefs inside.”
“Yeah, I get that a lot from people lately.” Tony shook his head. “And to think everyone always said that
Loki gave an impatient growl. “My oath to your Tin Man is so that I will not steal the Reality Stone for myself and attempt to fix the things I have already broken.”
Thor and Loki exchanged glances that made Steve feel uneasy. “We could ask Heimdall to locate him for our endeavor,” Thor said.
“Eh,” Clint shrugged, still holding onto Natasha with one arm. “Only so many times you can aim at a cow and it stops being a challenge.”
Tony didn't dare look over at Steve. He was sure Captain Red White and Blue had the same sick expression on his face that Tony had. “You
“Up, up and away!” Tony sang, bulleting up into the sky with cargo that was more precious than anything he’d ever owned.
Tony stepped back. “Bygones,” he said, waving a hand. “Go and play with your new friends, Cap. Maybe I’ll be able to get some work done.” It was a cheap shot that landed hard. Steve looked hurt. Tony kept stepping away. “Have fun,” he warbled and then spun to head back down to the workshop. It wasn’t a retreat dammit.
Steve and Natasha exchanged identical expressions. Tony had learned to fear that particular expression. It usually meant a scolding was to follow. And a scolding from Captain America was a painful experience. A scolding from Black Widow was painful in entirely different ways.
“Thank you, Doctors Barnes and Rogers, I appreciate the concern.” Tony could see the skeptical expression on Bruce’s face and smiled. “It’s completely curable and the two of you have the remedy!”
Crowley rubbed at his eyes. “Well, I would suggest they close their eyes then,” he said. “Perhaps you can take the lead in this one and have them hold on to you?”
Bucky kept looking towards the elevators. Steve knew what he wanted to do. “We need to let them get on with their work,” Steve told him. “No distractions.”
There was a heavy sigh as Rhodes transformed into Loki. “You are no fun anymore, brother.” The words were somehow both bitter and fond.
I'm really sick so there may not be an update for a couple of days. Watching my lungs crawling off the table isn't fun.
I think this is a chapter that had to happen. Right from the beginning this was going to happen. Bear with me.
Loki’s mouth turned surly. “While I really couldn’t be bothered with your world, it would seem that Jörmungandr cannot be defeated by Asgard alone.”
“Ugh.” Pepper shook her head. “There’s obviously a new strain of stupid out there. I thought you were immune, Tasha.”
“Guess who had extremely hot super-soldier sex last night, Barton?” He shoved both his thumbs at his chest. “This guy.”
The rear doors of the chamber opened, several ushers came in carrying folders that they started handing out to the delegates.
It was like something finally broke inside Clint. His eyes went bright and he staggered against Tony. He stumbled with the sudden weight, tumbling back onto the sofa with Clint in his arms.
The doors closed behind them and Bruce just stared. “You are seriously the most ridiculous human being on the planet. You know that right?”
Pepper sputtered a laugh. “You are, as always, a master of observation, Jarvis.” She patted his cheek. “Don’t let him work too late.” Rhodey dropped an arm across her shoulders as they headed out, pressing a kiss to her ear.
Steve moved away as Bruce bustled around the bed, muttering to himself as he poked and prodded at an atypically calm Tony. He leaned against a wall and felt Atlantis hum beneath him.
The growl that emanated from Bucky’s throat made them both jump. “I swear, Tony, if you say one more thing about taking the rap for this shitshow…”
“Okay.” Steve didn’t argue, just reached over to pull at the drawer. Everything went flying. Only super reflexes on Steve’s part had him catching the bottle of lube.
Clint looked almost himself again, still pale, but that ever-present twinkle in his eyes had returned, albeit a little duller than usual. “Hand on my heart,” he promised.
“Ah sweet boy, you have the violent instincts of a butterfly,” Tony said, opening the fridge. “Holy mother of all things holy!”
Tony tried not to roll his eyes. It would completely ruin the moment. “You are a walking antibiotic, and I haven’t been with anyone since…” He looked at Steve. “Since Pepper. And we were together for years.”
Tony danced a little when he saw the completed equation. “I'm a genius and I got it right, didn't I?” he asked Bruce.
“The Time Stone, it is safe?” Thor asked, moving quickly over to Strange. The cloaks had a quick cuddle as they met, Strange’s sentient piece of crazy seeming very interested in Thor’s.
“Sergeant Barnes is in bed, but he too is not asleep.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. paused. “He is however, attempting to
“So you are, Captain, so you are.” Tony waggled his eyebrows at him as he pulled off his shirt. “Come on, Barnes, get with the program.”
Bucky snorted a laugh into his coffee, shoulder to shoulder with Steve. Looking with his newly enlightened eyes at the dynamic between them, Tony could see that Bucky leaned in a little closer than Steve did, looked at Steve a little longer, touched him a little more.
intimidated. Jörmungandr was easily twice as large as Skurge, his skin a pale ice-blue. Tony tried to see Loki in his face, but all he saw was death and violence.
“No,” Sam said. “They have the ability to move between the realms of Heaven, Hell, Purgatory and Earth.”
“You sure about that?” Clint asked. “Because our pretty city seems really sure that the poisonous beastlet that chomped on Tony is someone you know called Loki.”
Tony lowered his gaze when his neck started hurting. “A green light.” He thought he showed admirable self-control in not being sarcastic. Steve would be proud of him.
“Could you just hold still, please?” Bruce moved in front of Bucky, a small penlight in his one hand. The other held a machine that Steve didn’t recognize.
Bruce gave an exasperated sigh. “Then by all means, feel free to leave and I’ll get back to you when I have some answers.”
“He’s always been like that, you know?” Bucky’s voice came from the doorway and Steve’s gaze snapped to him.
Thor frowned. “Loki would not speak of this so easily if he wasn’t sure.” He looked at the doors. “I think perhaps we should do as your king suggests and get in there as quickly as possible.”
“Mr. Stark?” His voice was cracked and rough as though he’d spent years screaming. He quite possibly had, if what Steve had told him was true.
“You were arrested for treason,” Tony bit out, hating the memory. He turned in a slow circle. “This must be a dream. There’s no other explanation.”
Tony woke to the smell of coffee. He realized only once he’d rolled off the bed that someone had moved him while he’d been sleeping.
Steve watched Loki get paler as Wanda closed her eyes. The illusion of his costume slid away to reveal him in a suit with a long green jacket and boots. No headpiece, no weapons, just a shivering man under Wanda’s spell.
Bucky patted his shoulder. “You wanted Stark,” he reminded Steve. “Don’t be surprised that your life is a circus.”
Tony pulled an AC/DC tee over his head, walking over to the bed. He bent down to press a soft kiss to Steve’s mouth. “Thank you,” he whispered.
Still perching on Steve, Tony grabbed the box and flipped it open. Steve couldn’t see what was inside, but Tony’s startled blink had him worried. “Tony?”
Gasping, his forehead resting against the porcelain seat, he wondered when he’d eaten carrots last night.
“Nix!” Tony crossed his fingers. “Hell no. Not me. No sir-ee, Bob!” He paused. “I wonder who Bob is? Was?”
“That is very good news, Colonel,” Sam said, eyes clear for the first time in a long time. “I am real happy to hear that.”
He felt Bucky’s mouth at the base of his spine and realized that he’d moved behind him. Bucky’s hands curved around Tony’s thighs, fingers digging in as he sucked at the soft skin at the top of Steve’s ass.
Tony beamed at him. “We can meet the rest of the team in Washington,” he said. "I can fly us there.”
“I remember that once upon a time, people were made to register themselves, based on race, religion, color and creed.” Xavier’s voice was almost dreamy. “That didn’t work out so well for everyone concerned.”
Bucky broke then, arms coming around Tony in a vice-like grip as he returned the kiss. Tony grew light-headed as the kiss went on and on.
“Next time I have to go to another realm to save the universe with a magic spell that’s actually a mathematics equation, I totally promise to let you come with.” Tony cupped Bucky’s cheek. “Swear to Thor.”
“That anyone but us will have to do,” Tony finished. “We’ve done the avenging bit, the rest of the spies can take care of the whitewash.” He tilted his chin when Steve looked at him. “I also need to let Pepper know that I’m alive, and not a minion of the Devil.”
“Hi-ho Silver, into the woods!” He jumped onto the scooter and made a 'mush' sort of motion. The suit, powered by his incredibly boring new AI, putted down the main street towards the thick tropical forests at the corner of the village.
Tony was about to fill the sudden silence with...something, when Natasha got up from the co-pilot chair and sat down on the other side of Bruce.
“Oh my god.” Tony felt stripped and frozen. He lifted a hand to the scars left behind from the arc reactor. “Oh my god.”
“Tony!” Steve’s shout brought his attention back to the spider-monkey-monster thing that seemed determined to peel him out of the suit.
He pocketed the phone again. “You’re sorted,” he told Scott. “Your free ride will be at Tony’s place by the time we get there.”
“I think you’re right,” Bruce said, taking his glasses off. He looked over to Wanda and Natasha. “We can’t do anything more anyway, until we’ve got an idea of where the Collector is.”
“What can we do to help?” Tony wasn't the sort of guy to sit back and wait for things to happen. He tended to make things happen. Bruce in the tower was a perfect example.
“That people have been looking for me.” Barnes nodded his thanks when Tony passed him the glass. “Steve just won’t let it go.”
“She did nothing.” Vision was the one who replied to Natasha’s angry questions. “She merely showed him the future, as I asked her.”
Bucky nodded towards the team both inside and outside the jet. “Managing people, commanding the troops. This lot, though. They don't listen to you much, do they?”
“Well shit, it seems like HYDRA must have picked up your buddy when he fell off the train, Steve.  Must’ve brainwashed him or something.” Tony patted Steve’s arm absently. “Don’t worry about it. If he’s anything like you, we’ll fix him up when we get him back.”
“Right after I’m done with it,” Barnes replied. “When I said talk to each other, I didn’t meant sucking each other’s faces off!”
Fury indicated that they sit. Tony sat at Steve’s right, Bucky at his left. Interestingly, Dean pulled up a chair next to Tony, Sam beside him. The rest of the team took various places.
“We’ve got you, Tony.” Steve’s voice was practically a whisper as he stroked his hand from the top of Tony’s spine to the spot where Bucky had pressed his mouth.
Steve looked troubled. “We can’t just be expected to rely on you two to fix this.” He lifted his eyes to look around the car. “It’s our job to protect humanity.”
Natasha and Bruce were huddled together by the piano, Bruce playing some melancholy thing that seemed to weep through the air.
Tony had a vague memory of Charles Xavier talking about this dude. “What are you doing in my house?” Tony demanded.
Tony and Bucky have a long-overdue conversation. Tony makes his appointment, along with a couple of friends
Rhodey shook his head. “We really need to set some boundaries when it comes to you three and over-sharing.”
He lurched across to the shower, reaching up to turn it on and lay there shivering as the water rained down on him, creeping way too slowly from Ice Age frost to the fires of Mount Doom.
“As if I could.” Steve sighed. “You do this quickly, okay?” He tapped Tony’s cheek. “And wear the faceplace.”
Tony and Bruce watched as WSC Secretary Alexander Pierce asked WSC Councilman Singh, “Let me ask you a question. What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow, and you knew that they were gonna drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution? And you could just stop it with a flick of the switch. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you all?”
Steve felt his own heart stutter in fear. He dragged his gaze away from Tony. “Thor, do you think that Loki’s staff might still be on your old world?” He kept from using either its name or the numbers that they had given it.
“I’m good!” he called back, adjusting the repulsors and sending his unwanted buddy a few steps back. “I don’t think they want us here.”
“You’ve obviously thought this through.” Tony could suddenly speak again. “Because I’m sure the big-ass hungry snake is going to stop eating once it’s finished with Earth.”
Steve leaned back on the sofa, legs spread, and looking as though there wasn’t a care in his perfect little world. “Make me.” It was a dare.
Bruce looked doubtful. “That’s sort of deceitful though, isn’t it?” He leaned forward. “Steve knows you, Tony. He likes you as you are. You don’t need to be someone different.”
Thor shouted through the earpiece, making Tony wince. “We're out of time. They're coming for the core.”
Thor sat next to Tony, keeping a beady eye on Loki who got to his feet with a groan. “While I wasn’t expecting a red carpet, I was hoping for a rather happier greeting, brother.” Loki wiped his mouth where a trickle of blood had appeared.
“The world hasn’t ended yet,” Bucky pointed out, his hair soft against Steve’s cheek. “So far, so good.”
Loki considered it for a moment. “Very well, I suppose it will be amusing to see whether your rooms here are as extravagantly opulent as those back home in Asgard.” He motioned Thor to lead the way.
“I get that,” Bucky said. “When I realized how I felt about Steve I think I went on a bender for a week.”
“That looks like it’s been some places,” Clint noted. Tony spotted the barely perceptible flinch Dean gave, and the small nudge that Sam made against his thigh.
Loki’s smile was tight. “No, but thank you, Captain.” He turned to Thor. “You must not keep trying to find ways to stop this. I know you.”
He shook his head. “Your mouth on my cock will do very nicely thank you, Sergeant Barnes.” Tony paused. “We are
“Oh, Happy?” Tony waved at hand. “He’s been promoted to guarding Pepper’s body.” He grinned. “He’s much happier with that assignment.” He nudged at Steve’s back. “Get it? Happy-er?”
Natasha punched him in the kidneys. Hard. He doubled over, gasping. Everyone else gasped too. And took several steps back.
Tony went over to the tiny window looking out onto the street. “I know you're out there, Banner. Why don't you make it easy on everyone and just come home?”
“I told Jörmungandr that you’d come by and make peace with him.” Tony felt a petty sense of pleasure when Loki flinched. “Oh, and I think this has to go back to the Collector.” He passed the Infinity Stone to Thor. He didn’t miss the longing glance Loki gave it.
Steve pulled back, squaring his shoulders. “I suppose you could call that an apology kiss?” he suggested.
“It cannot be destroyed,” Thor declared. “However, my father has offered to store it in the vaults of Asgard, along with the other dangerous objects we have removed from the Seven Realms.”
“Maybe.” Tony folded his arms across his chest. Dignity while hunched under a workbench was hard to achieve.
“About whether our alien friends from Asgard, are capable of shaking the inhuman calm of our synthesized friend.” Tony raised an eyebrow.
“That is perhaps the most true thing you have ever said, Captain.” Wanda looked at Natasha. “Come, sit with me, дорогая, let me ease your pain.”
Tony glared at him. “Not cool, Banner. Not cool at all.” He hadn’t even noticed his slip of the tongue. J.A.R.V.I.S.
Forever turned out to be about two hours when Coulson eventually came back into the house, Clint nowhere to be seen. He passed a set of keys to Dean. “She’s a beauty,” he said.
Steve nipped at Tony’s shoulder. “You’re awfully mouthy for a guy who’s at the mercy of two legendary superheroes.”
Steve's heart sank. He sucked in a slow breath. “I'm sure he's fine, Buck. Tony has a habit of landing in the shit and coming out smelling like roses.” God, had he always been so bitter?
best friend slash boyfriend, who’s god knows where, doing god knows what.” He put a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “It’s perfectly understandable that you’re running on fumes and adrenalin right now.”
He swallowed the bile that threatened to flood his mouth. “Don’t look.” The words were gritted out between his teeth as he fought to take another step.
Tony sipped slowly on the single shot of whiskey that Steve had allowed him. He wasn’t sulking. He listened to the conversations washing over him; mind on the equations on his screen several floors below.
So, until the Steve/Bucky situation arrived, he was going to make like Scarlet O'Hara and think about it tomorrow.
“What is on your mind, my metal friend?” Thor swept into the kitchen as only Thor could do. Even without his cloak and armor, the Crown Prince of Asgard had a way of commanding a room as very few others did.
Bruce frowned. “It’s not like he’s another person,” he began. “It’s like having a twin, a larger, angrier twin, but instead of standing next to me, he’s inside me.” He looked frustrated. “I’m not explaining this properly.”
Tony stuck out his tongue. “You know how I like my flash, Pepper-pot,” he said, holding the tee up. “This isn’t exactly screaming that I’m dateable.”
Tony shrugged, slumping a little more against Rhodey. “Wasn’t sure it would happen,” he confessed. “Our giant avocado tends to avoid people when there’s no need for avenging.”
Tony started laughing as she then scrubbed at her face and Natasha drawled, “I'm sorry. Did I step on your moment?” Pierce went white with rage.
“Capsicle, if I’m going to have your dick my mouth or in my ass, I reckon a shared toothbrush isn’t a problem.” Tony’s grin was all teeth as Steve flushed.
“And we’re just going to believe everything that lunatic says?” Tony remembered all too well a dark sky scattered with stars and rings of fire flying towards him as he fell through a hole in the world. He tried not to shudder.
And then the gates of heaven opened and God’s voice, who sounded an awful lot like Nick Fury, said, “Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better.” There was a pause and Tony heard the beautiful sound of a Helicarrier. He would have to buy something pretty for Fury. Maybe a to-scale size model of himself. “Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.”
“Well, nobody ever accused me of being reasonable before,” Tony said. “If you say it’s okay, Clint can come here, be with you. I can’t promise that I’m going to be mature about it, because, well, it’s me. But the kids miss him,
“No,” Clint replied. “Usually it’s much, much worse.” He sounded almost cheerful. Tony wanted to kiss these brothers who had put that sound in his voice again.
“Hold on a minute.” Steve leaned forward. “You’re saying that Hell is for humans, and Purgatory is for monsters?”
Tony loved New York. She was loud and a little dirty, brash and a complete bitch, but she was the city of his dreams.
Bucky sat down next to him, snorting with laughter. There were actual tears in his eyes. It was pretty much the best thing Steve had ever seen. “You people are all fucking nuts,” he declared.
Steve shook his head. If he talked he’d either sob like a girl or get so mad he’d make the Hulk afraid.
“I’m starting a swear jar for you, Cap. I think I may get rich.” Tony saw Bucky’s shoulders shaking and he grinned. “So, I wonder what the punishment is for the person who defiled a national treasure,” he mused.
Bruce came out of the forest at least with his junk covered. “I'm really not keen flying all the way back to Malibu as your piggy-back ride.”
“Vision!” Steve was stunned. “You have no idea what this guy has….” He trailed off when Vision held up a hand. It was amazing how quickly they quieted down.
“They’re over there,” Bruce waved towards the back of the lab. “Tony has a new friend.” He looked amused, not worried, so the tension that had taken root in Steve’s shoulders eased off.
“Oh my god! You were fifteen when you had your first kiss?” Tony was beyond thrilled to hear this. “You were a total cradle snatcher, you dog!”
Bucky met his gaze squarely. “You know how he feels about you, Tony. You going it alone was a slap in the face.”
“If I start sounding like a crazy Iron Hitler, I need you to remind me that I came back to change it.” Tony knew that he was soon going to forget the reasons for going through this again. He was already seeing this timeline blurring into the one he’d lived already.
Thor settled back with a smile. “You are most wise, Captain. Lady Wanda will easily be able to detect if my brother means mischief or not.”
The door was shoved open a moment later and a gorgeous red-head walked in. “You ready, babe?” She smiled at Bruce.
Bucky pushed away from the door abruptly, walking over to Tony. “You need to take a breath, babe.” He put his hands on Tony's shoulders. “You're so wired you're about to jump out of your skin.”
Trailed by two brawny guys in suits and dark glasses, he led them to a small lounge area and indicated that they sit. “Can I get you something to drink? I have an excellent Bruichladdich that has been waiting for the right occasion.” Tony could tell that he was offering out of politeness, not any desire to make them feel comfortable.
did.” Bruce waited for Tony to look at him. “I was just as desperate as you were to not be needed anymore.
“The results of your tests haven’t come out yet,” the nurse said, unmoved by his obvious charms. Tony was going to call her NurseZilla. “It would be inadvisable for you to leave until the doctor releases you.”
“I’m assuming that means you’re fine?” One perfect eyebrow lifted. Tony wondered if eyebrows could be used to kill. If they could, then Natasha’s totally would.
“An Infinity Gem is needed to power the equation that Tony Stark and the monster’s human form have designed.” Wanda’s even tone had Steve staring at her. “The Space Stone is on Asgard, and the Mind Stone gives Vision life. Therefore, we need another.”
“Tony, breathe, god, please breathe.” Steve’s voice broke through the terror that was shaking Tony apart. He realized that he’d slid to the floor and had curled up into a ball, trying to hide from the fear blanketing him like an impenetrable fog.
Steve didn’t move. “When this is over. When we’ve handled Thanos once and for all, we’re going to talk.”
Clint snorted. “Good thing you have those techno gadgets of yours ‘cause you are directionally challenged, my friend.”
Loki shook his head. “Nobody leaves the collection without Taneleer Tivan allowing it.” He looked over at Tony. “Thank you for what you did.” It sounded as though he was speaking through gritted teeth.
Tony sputtered a surprised laugh. “He wasn’t all that bad.” He dug his hands deeper under his arms. “So what does this mean then? For the team?”
It was cold in the room. His feet ached with the chill. He rubbed at his chest, the phantom hum of the arc reactor a comforting constant.
“It is better this way,” Strange told them. “I am aware that the last time Tony Stark went into space it was a traumatic experience for him.”
“You shouldn’t be too hard on Tony.” Bucky’s first words since they stepped outside took Steve by surprise.
“No, babe,” Clint’s voice was very gentle. “Not yet.” He cautiously took the phone from her grasp. “I need to talk to Laura. Find out how the kids are.”
Suddenly a pair of long legs was in front of the bench and Steve’s pretty blue eyes were peering into his. “I didn’t hear from Tasha so I thought I’d better come see for myself.” He smiled. “You planning on staying there?”
Thor’s frown deepened. “It makes no sense,” he insisted. “The man would then be named Clever Dick.” He shook his head. “How can the male appendage have a brain?”
Sam blinked. “He’s a rich man who has had everything handed to him on a silver platter all his life.”
The complete lack of noise, as though they were in a vacuum, was seriously eerie. Sam seemed to know where he was going though, heading resolutely further into the trees. They all followed in silence.
Coulson's arrival triggers things. Including Tony throwing a hissy fit. Coulson is the BEST therapist. Tony totally loves him. Like, platonically. Cos he's awesome
“As do I,” Thor declared, striding into the living room. He had a plate full of sandwiches and a jug of liquid. Loki trailed after him, clearly wanting to be anywhere but here.
Tony snickered a little. “Asserting your heteronormative masculinity?” He deliberately stood on Rhodey’s foot.
Steve shook his head. “No, I mean I’m not going anywhere, Tony.” He wrapped his arms around Tony, making sure that they were looking at each other. “I’m not leaving
Clint was lying with his head in Natasha’s lap, her fingers in his hair as she sang something softly in Russian to Bruce. Sam was spread out on a sofa, snoring while a feather that Clint, most probably, had stuck to his nose blew in the air. Rhodey lay on the bar counter-top, hands folded over his chest, body clearly ready for immediate action if needed. Even Loki was there, isolated and curled in on himself on one of the huge bean bags that Tony had strewn across the living room.
Pepper just looked at him, one perfect eyebrow arched. Natasha tended to do that with him a lot too. “Captain.” That one word held a weight of remonstration. “He misses you too, you know.” She moved her hand from his shoulder to tuck into his elbow.
Her question was a spark of confused light. “Tony, my friend, something happened to him and I want to get him back.” He paused, cleared his throat. “I don’t think we can keep saving you without his help.”
Tony noticed what appeared to be a light at the end of the tunnel. He ordered his brain not to make asinine comments about walking into the light. He was totally growing as a person.
Bucky tugged the glasses off. “You need to get past this, Steve.” His eyes were hard. “I am who I am, who I was. That’s not going away.”
“Not Sam and Natasha,” Tony said. “You think I didn’t monitor what was going on in the Tower? The huddles, the whispers, the searches. I knew you were looking for someone. But you never came to me. Never asked me for help.” He dropped his chin. “It proved that the family I thought I’d built was a lie.”
“His best friend was dead in my arms and his blood was on my hands,” Tony said. “I think he gets a pass.”
“Buttercup, you know your alcohol tolerance is about as good as that of an amoeba’s,” Tony chided as he slid into his R8. “Not clever.”
“Steel kills,” Natasha said, crouching to feel for a pulse. “She’s dead.” She looked up at Bucky. “Where did you get the knife?”
Clint and Natasha appeared torn. They were pissed off at Steve but the concern for his well-bearing was still there.
Natasha's expression was almost scornful. It made something inside Steve want to roll over and supplicate. “And we believe
Tony glared at him. “Really? We’ve literally talked ourselves stupid the past few days. What more do we need to clear up?”
“Not so,” Thor refuted. “Perhaps Matilda had no choice. Perhaps she chose to hide because she was afraid. That is not cowardice. That is self-preservation.”
Steve straightened, his eyes narrowing. “Being with Tony doesn’t change who I am,” he growled, his arm hauling Tony closer so that he was tucked into those rather ridiculous abs like glue. “I believe the modern phrase is bisexual and Tony is deserving of everything good in this world.”
“I know,” he said. “But I allowed something to happen in the past that had terrible consequences for the future. Apparently Uatu says that I’m important and that I
There was a soft cry from the window and a large bird flew in. Steve ducked instinctively, but it settled on the back of Bucky’s seat.
Steve watched Bucky step away from him and edge a little closer to Tony. He wondered how much of it was desire and how much was knowing that Tony was on the knife-edge precipice of imminent death.
Bucky was the first to move. His courage sometimes took Tony’s breath away. He took one step onto the bridge, and then another, and froze. “I don’t think I can do this,” he whispered.
deserves rape or the theft of a child.” Steve sounded hard. “If you want to make up for your mistakes, then help us. If it is your child at the heart of this thing, then help us to stop whatever he or she is planning.”
“Hm.” Tony waved at the nurses and doctors at his door. “Thanks all, I’ve got this covered.” Vision closed the door in their faces. That’s why Viz was his favorite.
“I feel like crap and I’m fuck out of ideas.” The honesty this time surprised them both. Tony closed his eyes. “This is possibly the absolute worst timing for this conversation, but it needs to be said. I’m sorry.”
Bruce nodded. “By my calculations, Asgard is most likely gone by now.” He grimaced. “It’s the first time in a long time that I hope to be wrong.”
“Okay.” Dean cleared his throat. “Just so we’re clear?” In the manner of dangerous men, they nodded at each other. Tony wanted to ask if they would like to check their dick size.
Tony sagged in Steve’s arms, not even trying to pretend that he wasn’t losing his shit. “Steve.” The word was a plea, a sob, a scream.
‘We can house them in the East Wing,” Vision suggested. “None of us have taken up residence there yet.”
Natasha shrugged. “I may be on diet, but it doesn’t mean I can’t look at the menu.” She looked Tony up and down. “You’ll do.” She stepped forward and ran her fingers through his hair, messing it up.
“Yeah, yeah, we know, Prince Charming.” Tony held up a hand. “We really don’t need any more information.”
Tony wanted to kick him. A warning look from Steve had him subsiding. “Director, what do you know…?”
“No-one is trying to take your blood, you dick.” Clint glared at him. “God, you’re so fucking touchy.”
“You can’t make promises like that, Buck,” Steve said. “It’s only been a few days with that program that Tony sent you. It’s seventy plus years you need to get out of your head.”
Steve snorted. As he was kissing Tony, it was a surprisingly gross experience. Tony shoved at his shoulder. “At the risk of sounding like a six year-old, ew.”
Steve moved only when Thor said, “It is done.” His words were muffled, Tony’s ears still ringing. He didn’t move. He rested his head on Vision’s chest, choking back tears.
“Seriously. Fuck off, Tones. It’s bad enough without you here.” Tony’s flinch didn’t go unnoticed. “We are
Natasha gave them a significant look. Tony interpreted it as, ‘shut the fuck up or I will end you in many painful ways’.
“You can lean any fucking time you want, you giant baby,” Rhodey told him. “It’s just, like, when you were with Pepper, you were better, calmer, happier. That’s what I want for you
“I thought you’d died,” Steve said with a tiny smirk. “So, I was trying mouth to mouth resuscitation.”
Falling back to walk with Sam and Dean, he set his mouth in a thin line. “You having a tiff with loverboy?” Dean asked, seemingly okay with the situation after his little explosion. Tony wondered just how messed-up Dean’s life had been that being beamed by a god out of Hell was just another day in the office.
Bucky’s smile lit up his face. “Nat wanted to know if you had made nice with the big guy.” He lifted a hand and ran it over Tony’s back. It was all still so new that Tony got a thrill from simply being able to touch.
“I’m sure you’ve heard by now of Mr. Stark’s latest breakthrough in assisting victims of post-traumatic stress disorder.” Vision seemed to be calculating every one of their micro-expressions
Vision was a beast in the air, but needed work on hand to hand combat. He seemed to be good at keeping Wanda from flying apart too. Sometimes Steve thought love shone out of those artificial eyes.
Tony was okay with it being Barton. He plastered a grin on his face. “Well, if it isn’t Legolas,” he drawled.
“But they do,” Bruce said. “And I blame myself. Feel guilty for things the Hulk does while he’s wearing my skin.”
“It’s exactly like rape,” Crowley corrected. “Interesting that this is the route you chose, James.” He lifted an eyebrow at Bucky who was looking around in disgust. “Was it very difficult hiding the fact that you were homosexual from your friends?”
Tony’s jaw dropped. “I’m not your co-captain!” He pushed away from the tree, starting to pace again. “I’m out of the field, remember. Iron Man is retired.”
Clint threw his legs over the sofa, dropping down beside her. “You’re a girl,” he scoffed. “You have those things called emoti…aaaahhhh!” His scream was accompanied by a rapid jump away from Natasha. “You’re the actual devil,” he complained, rubbing at a spot below his ribs.
“Not going to happen. I won’t leave.” Bucky leaned forward too, his forehead against Tony's. “I don’t ever want to leave.”
Tony took off the goggles. “Really, stubborn? You? Never.” He put every little bit of mean spite he could summon into his voice. There wasn’t much mean, or spite left. Not anymore.
Steve reached out, ran a hand over Bucky’s hair. “This guy here has seen the foulest pieces of humanity and he still finds it in him to trust.” He smiled at Bucky. “You amaze me, Buck.”
“It’s a highly experimental device that officially doesn’t exist,” Bruce told them. “Hold this please.” He gave the machine to Bucky.
“As I have not read our fair city’s words to you, I am at a loss to explain,” Thor said. Steve could spot a dodge a thousand miles away.
“It was always all about the money, Charlie boy.” Tony rubbed his thumb and forefinger together. “Mine, specifically.”
“Sir.” She walked past Clint and Tony, bumping them slightly so that they fell over, still cackling. “Children.”
“We were afraid.” Wanda’s soft voice whispered across Steve’s collarbone. “I think I’ve spent most of my life being afraid.”
“The Collector will not relinquish his treasures without a fight.” Loki was the one who spoke bluntly, taking Steve by surprise. He was used to Loki being a little more subtle, a lot more dishonest.
Tony dreamed of oceans and agony. Of monsters sucking his life from his body and Steve throwing himself on him, letting the monsters drain him dry instead. Of holes in space and sentient cities.
Steve sighed, getting off the bed on the other side and going to where Bucky was lying. “I’m embarrassed for you, Buck. Letting a civilian get the jump on you like that.” He hauled Bucky to his feet. “As your commanding officer….” Bucky shut him up with his mouth.
“Okay,” Tony said, “Maybe we can work this out together. And then run it past them. They know more about the Infinity Gems than anyone else.”
“Can you come to the chair control room?” Steve asked. “I think Peggy is trying to tell us something and my Morse code is a little rusty.”
Tony felt his gaze slide over to where Jörmungandr sat. “He didn’t understand the consequences,” he explained. “He thought that by destroying Asgard he would be rid of his father.” Jörmungandr’s head came up and he fixed his eyes on Tony.
They all turned to look at Bruce who dropped his goggles on his workbench. “For you, always.” His smile was almost shy. Hers wasn’t.
“No, it was all on me,” Steve said, taking a large sip. It burned going down, fire that swept the fear away. “If I’d just stopped and thought about it, I would have known that Tony wasn’t the sort of guy to sign on for rules and regulations.”
Bucky, Natasha and Clint formed a line behind Steve. They were silent but clear. The Avengers were a team.
“Colonel Rhodes, it is wonderful to see that you are walking without your exoskeleton once more.” J.A.R.V.I.S. said. “Vision was most concerned that he wasn’t able to do more to assist your healing process.”
Pepper didn’t look impressed. “The fact that you actually call yourself the Flirt Meister hurts me to my bones, Tony. My
Tony gave a short nod. “I assume, like Dante’s Inferno, it’s levels of evil being punished?” he asked.
He turned his head from the sight of a dark-haired woman wrapping the head of a man in plastic, holding him until his chest bellowed with the desperation to breathe.
The triumphant expression on Rhodey’s face had Tony laughing. “Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time –“
Fury put his head in his hand. “I give up.” He waved the other hand. “Get the hell out of here. Do whatever you want.”
“Oh fuck you!” Tony said, finally laughing. “You are such an asshole, Barnes.” He held out a hand. “Feel like helping me out with our precious princess here?”
“Somehow, god knows how, you broke free from decades of mental conditioning and not only came out the other side, but you still have the capacity to love. That’s beyond remarkable.” Tony frowned at him. “How can I get you to believe that?”
Tony tried to tune them out. This was their time. He’d taken up enough of Bucky’s time. He stared at Rhodey instead.
Thor nodded. “I thank you, Steve. But it means that I am, for now, banished from Asgard while Loki pretends to be king.” His mouth twisted. “It concerns me much that the rest of my brethren have not uncovered his mischief as yet.”
“But you’ll always come back.” Lila threw her arms around his neck. “And Iron Man always keeps his promises!”
“Doctor Strange has been given the responsibility of protecting the earth in every universe.” Vision said. His face, as always, revealed nothing. “The Time Stone cannot be destroyed. It is too important. The Mind Stone, however, is not.”
“That sounds about right,” Steve nodded, bringing Tony back to the present. Apart from the two research nerds, everyone else was lying around in various stages of food coma. Tony couldn’t believe that Dean was
“That’s about right for me too,” Sam added. “Steve’s my friend. I made the choice to support him rather than the Accords. He’d never let me down before. Plus, that shit that went down with Hydra made me lose trust in almost every government institution in the world.” He nodded at Steve. “Where he goes, I go.”
pushed into him. It was hot and hard and never-ending. Tony lifted his legs, wrapping them once more around Steve’s hips to get him closer, further in.
Tony sat opposite her and held out his hands. She put hers in them. “You know that I love you, don't you?” He was so fucking bad at this.
“Yes!” Tony shouted. “I said yes!” He tugged the t-shirt over his head and yanked the bathroom door open. “I only asked because you are the wisest of the wise, Pepperoni.” He attempted a smile.
Rhodey slumped down onto one of the chairs around the kitchen unit. “I didn’t plan anything, brother,” he whined, thumping his head against the table. “She’s just so amazing and competent and I mean, have you
“He has the codes to the nuclear weapons stored around the country,” Steve countered. “Are you prepared to take the risk, because I sure as shit am not.”
It was one long shriek of pain as she sliced through thought, ripping him apart. He was vaguely aware of the others reacting in the same way. Ropes of red entwined them all, slashing them into atoms of agony.
“How much trouble are we talking?” Clint asked as they drew closer to Malibu. They hadn’t talked much on the way.
“I am here to open a portal to the place where Jörmungandr is hiding,” Strange said. The amulet pulsed with a peculiar light.
“Unique?” Steve asked from him slouch. Tony didn’t dare look over. He wanted to crawl between Steve’s knees, pull his pants down and worship his beautiful cock. His brain went a little hazy.
“Assemble!” Tony called, making jazz hands. Natasha’s gaze could have skewered him on the spot. He took a step towards Steve. “Don’t let her torture me before she kills me,” he begged.
“Seriously, Cap. I’m good. No trauma, just relaxing in my workshop, tinkering on things.” Tony wanted to get off the phone and find a corner to rock and cry in. He hadn’t realized just how
Sam shook his head. “Because they were stuck in Purgatory while Death was dead and a lot of those monsters had been reaped by them.”
Steve’s eyes went icy. “I don’t make promises I can’t keep,” he said, those ridiculous shoulders squaring up once more. “You know me better than that, Tony.”
And finally, there it was, that beautiful, glorious, over the top flash of red and gold in the sky, and suddenly Steve could breathe again. “It’s Tony, he’s okay.” One of the helicopters took a direct hit from Iron Man and Steve wanted to cheer. Tony managed to take out a second helicopter but then the entire house fell off the cliff, taking Tony with it and plunging into the sea.
“I’m scarred for life,” Rhodey told Steve, expression very grave. “There are things you just shouldn’t know about your team leader.”
He licked his lips. “When Secretary Ross came to me with his proposal, I was bleeding inside. I knew I was at fault for the devastation of Sokovia. I had no excuse but my own arrogance. I could see that people were starting to fear us instead of trusting us to save them.” Rhodey’s hand was a solid warmth on his shoulder and Tony took courage. “I knew that the Accords were going to happen, no matter if I signed or not. But in signing, I hoped that I would be able to have a little control on just
“Then somehow, we have to do as Tony says and ensure that the SRA never sees the light of day.”  Xavier stated it plainly enough that there would be no argument.
“F.R.I.D.A.Y. mentioned that your heart rate was elevated and that Ms. Potts was crying,” Steve said.
Tony rubbed at his eyes. “To be perfectly honest, I’m remembering less and less which isn’t a bad thing. Uatu told me it would happen as I changed the future that I already lived. However, certain milestones are still pretty clear in my head.”
Tony grinned. “That’s what they call us on the fan sites.” He dropped a hand over Bruce’s shoulder as he started guiding him out of the forest. “And that’s our ship name in the fan fiction.”
Sam and Clint started shoving Thor away from their food. “You wouldn’t share yours, you dick,” Clint protested. “Why the hell would we give you some of ours?”
The only thing that kept him from flying apart was the steady warmth of Steve’s arm around his shoulders as he wept for the terrible death of his second child and the unexpected, joyful resurrection of his first.
“I think we broke him.” Tony’s voice brought Steve back to himself. He opened his eyes to meet Tony’s amused gaze. “Hi.”
“Awesome.” Tony was sort of pissed that he’d missed it. That reminded him. “I left a bag full of stuff on the platform.” He shampooed his hair, massaging his scalp. “Make sure that all gets down to my lab, okay?” He hadn’t left Jotunheim
“I believe that Captain Rogers is correct, sir.” Coulson’s voice broke into the charged quiet. Everyone took a collective sigh of relief. With Coulson on their side, Fury was sure to follow.
Bruce sighed. “But we’re talking about the Devil.” He took off his glasses and scrubbed at his face. “A religious construct used to terrify people in the Middle Ages.”
Tony tried to get Bucky to move. “Come on, Bucky, you need to talk to us. I won’t call you that if you don’t like it.”
?” Only bats could hear the screech in Tony’s voice. Bruce and Bucky both winced. “You don’t negotiate with that dickhead! You lock him up and throw away the key!” Tony stopped, thinking furiously. “Why is he here? I thought he was busy playing Odin in Asgard?”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y. please make a note to remind me to remember to call Vision.” The earpiece still kept him in close contact with his AI and his suit.
Natasha and Clint would disappear for days at a time, and Steve would never know if they were on assignment, or on the farm until they came back. Their eyes would tell him where they’d been, what they’d done. If they’d killed, if they’d lived.
“Perhaps not advisable, sir, but with the Captain’s advanced healing time, it would be better to move him quickly to a medical facility.” JARVIS commanded two of the bots to form a stretched with their arms. “Where should I take him?”
“Steve.” He sat up abruptly. “Where’s Steve?” He had a feeling he knew but the sick churning in his stomach couldn’t be true.
Steve propped his fists on his hips. “Are you aware that you’ve been down here for over eight hours straight?” Tony had flashbacks to before, when Steve had bitched at him for working too long. It made something warm and fuzzy ooze up in his chest.
So this is short & sweet because let's be real, the boys are going to be dysfunctional forever. I have some ideas of a Loki rescue but that will have to come after I cure my brain of my Civil War feelings.
, James Buchanan Barnes. Not the Winter Soldier. Not the boy who loved Steve Rogers way back when. I love the man you’ve become despite everything.” Tony shook his head as he kept his eyes on Bucky. “I want to write a tribute to your courage. You’ve been destroyed in the most basic way and yet you’re here, with me, putting yourself on the line.” He kissed Bucky again, this time with a little more intent. “How could I
“There's nothing like that about you,” Bucky told him. “You're privileged, sure, but not spoiled.” He stared at Tony. “Your old man was a lot like you on the surface,” he said. “But you're cut from a different cloth underneath.”
Steve nodded. Thor and Loki had left with a promise to return as quickly as possible. “Okay, let’s shut everything down and get some rest.” He walked over to Vision. “That means you as well.”
Skurge and Strange followed Jörmungandr without another word. Entirely too trusting, Tony thought. His mind flashed on those who were waiting back home. Steve and Bucky were probably going a little stir-crazy. He hoped he got the chance to see them again.
“You do that!” Tony called after him as he jogged into the trees. “I'll just be waiting here, hopefully not being killed by a jaguar or a bear or something.” He sat down on a large rock, eyeing the forest floor. “I bet there are fire ants,” he muttered. “Those tricky little bastards are everywhere.”
Steve shook his head. “How’d I get so lucky and end up with two assholes as best friends?” he asked the universe.
Strange frowned. “You will deploy the spell and the Aether will magnify it and force Jörmungandr to retreat.” He sounded a little impatient.
Tony didn’t let that bother him. “Good day, honorable ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for agreeing to this special sitting of the General Assembly.” He looked over at King T’Challa. “My name, in case any of you were unaware, is Tony Stark and I am here to request that you agree to discuss the ratification of the Sokovia Accords with immediate effect.”
“Lord,” Pepper sighed, rubbing at her eyes. “Please just sign these papers and I will leave you two to your utterly embarrassing attempts at flirting.”
Steve pulled her into his arms, ignoring the stiffening of her body. He was slowly getting her used to being hugged. “And I’m thankful for you every day.”
Steve wanted to shake him. “You shut your stupid mouth, James Buchanan Barnes,” he ordered. “Nobody deserves it more than you.
“Tony is the proverbial cockroach,” Rhodey told Steve, mouth thin and irritated. “He’d survive a nuclear explosion.”
Steve’s mouth dropped open in shock. “No!” he exclaimed. “Tony, you could have killed us both in Siberia. You pulled your punches, let us beat you. I know that. Of course I trust you!”
Thor shook his head. “Jane cannot stay away indefinitely. We will return before you have even missed us.” He paused. “That, however, is unlikely.”
Thor propped his hands on his hips. “I am well able to take care of myself,” he said, frowning at Tony.
Pages flipped, voices murmured and Tony waited. It was a very difficult thing. Patience really wasn’t one of his many,
Natasha’s gaze was cool, cutting. “You had chosen your side.” She nodded towards Steve. “You all had. Tony gave me that Intel on condition of anonymity.”
His feet were on something, he noted. He couldn’t see what it was, but he felt like he was standing on a floor, slightly spongy, but dense. He turned in a slow circle. “This is amazing,” he breathed as glittering lights moved closer to him. It seemed as though he was about to be surrounded by a million fireflies.
“Tony.” That one use of his name had Tony stop moving. “I need you to be safe. You and Bucky. I can’t worry about you two while I’m dealing with this.”
Her laugh was watery, her smile the barest curve. “I don’t want to betray you, Tony. You’ve done so much for us, given so much to us. I don’t want you to think…”
“I think I might actually be suffering from ATTS,” Tony admitted with a frown. “It may be terminal.”
Sam looked at Clint. “Heaven is real,” he told him. “It’s a little different to Hell though. Human souls that are bound together share a heaven.”
Rhodey went to the door and opened it. “Agent Romanoff, please can you come in?” There was a hum of sound. “No. Only her.” His voice was icy enough to give Tony shivers.
“Matilda hasn't always been a not-cat,” Clint said, finally passing Steve's notebook back to him. “She used to be an Asgardian, one of Thor's people, and when the Wraith came, she hid away.”
He gritted his teeth and went into the small office at the back of the lab. The sofa was long enough for him to lie there in comfort, and the messy blanket was evidence of a night’s sleep on it. He lay down, throwing an arm over his eyes. “Everything has changed,” he murmured to himself. “New people added to the mix, Coulson back before the last time, Ross apparently capable of reason….” He sighed. “So when is the shit going to hit the fan? And how much of it is going to be my fault?”
Tony lowered his head, barely hiding his smirk. Clearly time spent with Tony hadn’t helped Bucky’s attitude.
“It's a little bit the same,” Tony insisted. “We've both got regrets. But living while looking back is only going to trip you up.”
Tony’s head snapped back as though she’d slapped him. “What part of “I killed him” are you not getting, Pep?” He pointed to his nose, still swollen bent a little to the side thanks to Bucky’s effective right hook. “I deserved this, and more.” He felt his chest closing up as he tried to breathe.
Steve had literally no words. He stared at Tony for about a minute before looking at Bucky. “What the hell?”
Thor started pacing, fingers tapping a staccato beat on the chest-plate of his body-shield. “It's not
Zemo started a typical villain shtick, telling them all about why he had brought them here and drooled a little over Steve’s eyes. And then he said, “An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead… forever.”
He’d forgotten about Bucky. HYDRA was still a live, insidious beast, eating at SHIELD from the inside out when the Winter Soldier came. Steve dragged Tony with him to the bunker almost immediately, explaining about HYDRA, and Alexander Pierce being HYDRA, and the plan to destroy most of humanity using Tony’s technology with Project Insight.
“I don’t need a fucking babysitter just because I broke up with my fucking girlfriend!” Tony’s venom was surprising, unwarranted and it hurt like hell.
“You are such a soft touch, you loser.” Bruce bumped his shoulder. “I bet you told him he could buy her back when he got the cash.”
“I don’t know if your armor will be able to make it all the way into Hell,” Sam interjected with an apologetic shrug.
“You are an embarrassment, Stark. I swear to god, I’m done with you.” Rhodey beamed at him. “Fucker.”
“Hello to you too, Nicholas,” Tony said, pressing the button that would seal his part of the car off. He didn’t want anyone listening in on this conversation.
“I don’t think I’ve been okay for a while, Sam.” And perhaps that was the most honest he’d been with himself in years.
“To be perfectly honest, I’m a little stir-crazy,” Steve admitted. “With nothing to do, no-one to save, and no plan to set things right, I just want to get out of here for a bit.”
Vision was waiting for them on the landing pad of Stark Tower. Tony refused to call it Avengers Tower. It had been, then it wasn’t. That part of his life was done.
This is so much fluff. Oh lord, the fluffiest of fluffy things. I cannot be sorry because I really love Tony okay?
Tony loved drugs. They made the pain go away. He waved a hand in front of his face. “Oooh, rainbows,” he crooned.
Tony let his eyes go wide. “Do you think that means that Stargate is real?” He loved winding up the ‘serious’ scientist.
Tony shoved at Bucky’s shoulder. “No rest for the wicked, Buckeroo,” he said, laughing when Bucky rolled off the bed.
“This is no time for your tricks, Loki.” Thor folded his arms across his chest. “Show yourself or be branded a coward!”
She let him go and Tony tucked his abused finger under his armpit, glaring uselessly at her for a moment. He thought about defending his actions, but decided that cowardice was the better part of survival. “You plan on staying?” he asked instead.
With an almost giddy sense of relief Tony said, “You too, Cap.” He looked back up to Barnes again. “Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop…” He saw Steve sign to Barnes without a word and he lowered his gun. Tony ignored the slightly sick panic roiling in his belly.
Strange glared at him. “Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.”
“No.” Tony stood firm. “He is not my … paramour.” He wrinkled his nose. “I thought we were doing a better job of educating you in twenty-first century wording, man?”
The glass slid away, Atlantis, as always, eager to please Steve. Thor hurried to place Tony carefully against the cushioned wall of the pod. He stepped back and the pod closed, flooding with some sort of gas that quickly liquefied around Tony’s body, turning solid a few moments later.
Rhodey gave her a glare. “Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?" Totally crushing on her, Tony cackled internally.
to Growley!” Crowley announced as they caught up to him. “I thought that the Winchesters were the most aggravating humans I’d ever met.”
Xavier looked pained. “I have no idea why Nick Fury ever thought you were mature enough to be an Avenger.”
He stepped back, surveying his work. “Goddamit I’m good.” He beamed at Jim. “Make a fist.” he ordered.
Rhodes snorted this time. “Yeah, not the right word, Tones. Try another.” He softened his words with a smile. Steve wondered how he could have given this up, walked away without a thought.
Thor’s face darkened and the threat of thunder rolled across the skies. “You would chastise us in this?” he asked, voice as low as Steve had ever heard it.
Carol left to go and try to save the remaining part of the universe, taking Nebula with her. She had seemed reluctant to leave, but Tony had encouraged her to go and learn more about superheroing from an actual superhero.
Bruce was an oasis of calm. The Hulk seldom made an appearance unless Tony had been particularly provoking, and even then, it was usually to chuck a terrified Tony under the chin with one huge green finger. Steve enjoyed Bruce’s company. The quiet, sure way he had of speaking, of thinking, challenged Steve’s view of the world, of monsters. That he was smart, wasn’t a question. That he was almost always utterly despondent, was a frustration for Steve that he couldn’t let go. And somehow, despite that alternate world, Natasha wasn’t the solution to Bruce’s happiness either.
Eventually the tears stopped. Bucky sighed, rolling his face onto Tony’s shoulder. He looked ashen and exhausted. “When last did you sleep?” Tony asked.
Why would he have missed out on this? He….there was something there, tickling the back of his mind. Something about Steve. Something important.
The silence was unnerving. Steve held his breath waiting for Tony’s answer. The sounds in the garden stilled too as though the world was taking a breath.
“The moment we met, we fought.” Steve dropped him down onto the mattress. Tony bounced a little. It was a long way to fall.
James ‘Bucky’ Barnes wasn’t the easiest person to share space with, Tony had quickly realized. He understood that Barnes was suffering from severe PTSD. But two weeks had passed and Tony was no nearer getting to know the real man behind the haunted eyes.
“I told you that I was fine,” Tony said, eventually tired and irritated with the constant clucking around him.
“Oh, fuck that shit!” Tony yelled. “You’re not a thing. You have thoughts, feelings, emotions. You’re more human than many actual flesh and blood people I know!”
“Okay.” Tony sucked in a huge breath. “That would be a great start.” He sat down again, taking his own copy from Vision. “If you could turn to page eleven, article three, clause seven. It’s where the pink sticky thing is…”
“He’s a great guy,” Tony agreed. “Once you get past the crazy.” He kept his tone joking though so that Steve would know he didn’t mean it.
Dean followed them back inside. Bruce and Sam were hunched over Sam’s laptop, muttering occasionally to each other. Clint was drinking a cup of coffee, talking to Natasha.
They followed Coulson down a long corridor, grey and glass. Tony’s architects had built something functional and beautiful and somehow S.H.I.E.L.D. had managed to make it spectacularly boring. “Why?” Tony asked. “It’s not like it’s not true.”
Steve nodded, his mouth barely quirking which told Tony that he was being a sarcastic asshole. “Yes, Tony, I Google too.”
Tony started pacing. “The world had seen what happened in New York. Not our fault, but we were a big part of the mess that was left to clean up. Then Sokovia. God, I blame myself for Sokovia. Ultron was my fault. Me and my fears for what could be expected of us in the future. And Johannesburg. That was the final nail in our coffin. It was why Ross could get the Accords ratified so quickly.
Rhodey deliberately looked between the three of them. “Hey, it’s your life, crazy person. I’m just going to sit back and watch the show.”
Tony opened his mouth to say SHIELD, but then remembered that SHIELD no longer existed. “Bring him here,” he said, his voice a little hoarse. “Quickly.”
“Ass front and center, Cap,” Tony ordered. “Not fair that he’s kissed you and I haven’t.” He didn’t like the awkward expression on Steve’s face. That should never be an expression on Steve's face.
“Tony Stark has never tapped out on anything in his entire life.” Rhodey’s direct words hit Steve like a gut-punch.
The room was silent as they all watched the scene unfold. Steve stole several glances at Natasha as she watched the man she...felt something for, turn into a green monster and pick up a beautiful brunette woman in his arms as though she was a fragile flower.
“It’s a guaran-damn-tee.” Steve wasn’t one to make an entrance, but when he did, it was a doozy. Tony wanted to jump up and down, pointing and squealing like a teenaged girl. “We come as a set.”
“If you get alien tech it means that we’re being attacked,” Rhodey pointed out. “Not always a great by-product.”
Speaking of cocky assholes - Tony shuffled closer to him on the sofa. “Ah, Cap, Capibear, Capybara, Capsicle, don’t be like that,” he crooned. “You will totally enjoy paying up.”
“Damn,” Tony said with a cheerful grin. “I was hoping for something a little more than almost.” He smacked Bruce on the ass as he went past.
Steve frowned. “Then surely he’d be willing to help us? He’s going to suffer too.” It made sense if the Collector was going to be affected as well.
“What?” Tony panicked. “I was just messing around. There’s no possible way I could actually be from the future.” He really needed to stop fucking up.
“Mr. Barton, this is the Vision.” The android’s voice was smooth and cool. “I have been instructed to request that you and your friends please land at the co-ordinates that I have uploaded into the Quinjet’s guidance.”
They trooped into the elevator, giving the controls to F.R.I.D.A.Y. They filed out at each floor, Clint, then Coulson and the Winchesters, Bruce and Natasha, and then finally Tony, Steve and Bucky were alone.
Natasha shook her head. “Too small.” She kept her gaze on the images. “There.” Her finger tapped a spot. “War Machine.”
So, apologies for the wait. There are some talky bits here & coming in the next chapter. Even with the end of the universe hanging over them, these folks have to work their shit out.
Scott grinned. “Come on, dude. When has that ever worked with me?” He made his rounds with the team, shaking hands and hugging. When he reached Natasha he gave her an awkward shoulder pat that had Steve smiling.
Bruce stared at him and whatever he saw in Steve's eyes made something inside him just relax. All of the tension slid out of his body like a slow-punctured balloon. And finally, Bruce looked at Natasha, met her gaze full-on, and smiled.
Steve shook his head. “They will have to figure out their own path. One thing I’ve come to realize is that we are all responsible for our actions and choices. I won’t try to take on their burdens too. It might break me.” He tried to smile. “Clint, Sam, Natasha, they’re going to have to work it out with you and the rest of the team. I just need you.”
“By the way, a couple of guys dropped by while you were gone,” Bruce said, patting DUM-E on the head when he passed him a screwdriver. “Said you were holding a car for them?”
Her smile was wistful. “No, Tony. It’s always been yours. I guess that should have been a warning sign right there.” She walked out of the kitchen, stilettos clicking against the tiles.
“The Accords,” Tony said. “I pushed too hard, too fast, didn’t look at the fine print. Didn’t give you all a chance to have your say before I went ahead with signing. I was stupid. Stubborn. Arrogant. I wanted to save everyone. I didn’t want anybody else to die because I hadn’t done my job.”
“When he’s ready, he’ll let us find him.” Steve hoped. Prayed. He missed Bucky like a limb. Now that he knew his best friend was out there somewhere, it ached.
“I need new friends,” Tony finally gave in, tapped the remote for the lab door and lifted his head to see Rhodey and Pepper tumble in. “Here to laugh at me too, Brutus?” He raised an eyebrow at Pepper.
“He loved you too,” Tony choked out. “God, Buck, if you could hear how he sounded every time he talked about you.” It had made Tony sick with jealousy. Petty, green-eyed envy monster.
Fuck. He was going to have to tell them all about the SRA. He took a deep breath. “The crazy ex-general who is currently our Secretary of State has started to gain support for something he calls the Superhuman Registration Act.”
I hope this chapter is something that you've all been waiting for. I know that I've been waiting to write it. It's a little longer than normal but it didn't feel right to cut it.
Bruce lifted his gaze to Steve. “The coffee pot is over there and mugs are in the cupboard above it,” he said. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. mentioned that you were on your way.”
Several things happened all at once. Tony and Rhodes thumped down in their armor, repulsors and weapons at the ready, Vision and Wanda hovering above them, clearly prepared for whatever was happening. Bucky and Natasha sprinted out of the compound after them.
“A suit of armor around the world,” Steve murmured. “Would that really have made a difference after all?” His face was kind. It was a good face, Tony thought. A friend’s face.
Steve’s throat closed. He should have known better. Tony would always see the best in people, even if he couldn’t see past his own flaws. “He had you to help him.” He pitched his voice so that Bucky would hear him. “He wasn’t alone.”
“None of you are quite how I imagined you,” Dean said, leaning against the balcony wall and looking out over New York.
Steve kissed him hard then, lifted him so that his feet dangled a little off the floor. He pressed Tony against the reinforced glass, moving one hand down to Tony’s ass. He urged Tony to put his legs around his waist, moved in closer so that his cock was pressed hard against Tony’s ass. “God, you make me crazy.”
Tony sidled over to Steve, and pressed a kiss on the spot. “My mom always kissed my boo-boos to make them feel better,” he said.
“I take it back,” Tony snarled. “Leave my sanctuary and don’t return until you’ve adjusted that attitude, mister.”
He lay sprawled there, watching Bucky watching him. Bucky stripped his boxers off and then tugged Steve’s down. “God, the things I want to do to you,” he breathed, crawling up and over Steve.
“You’re absolutely correct,” Barnes told him, his blue eyes twinkling. “Anyway, Steve, that’s Captain America’s name in case you didn’t know, said I needed a cool nickname.”
Tony had a vision of a leather collar and a quirt. It made him whine. “I’ve changed my mind,” he told them breathlessly. “I don’t want this anymore.”
Extremis? A thought for another day. It looked as though nothing had ever shredded his chest and heart into paper, the skin as smooth as it had been before his world had changed forever.
Bucky grabbed Tony’s finger. “Do that again and I’ll make you sorry,” he warned, his eyes bright with laughter. It made Steve unreasonably happy to see that smile. Bucky would never be the kid he’d grown up with, but here, in this time, he had found a home with a egotistic billionaire and his orphaned superheroes.
Pepper stared at them all. “So, which of you geniuses has a way of restoring an Asgardian trapped in not-cat form to Asgardian form?” She looked around. “Anyone?”
sorry. I got retrenched. Then COVID hit and here in South Africa we were in a hard lockdown so I couldn't look for a job.
“Eh,” Tony acknowledged the insult. “That's entirely possible.” He sucked in a breath. “Not that I'm not thrilled to see you, big guy, but I'm kinda running out of oxygen here.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. had been squawking with consistent diagnostics for the past few minutes.
“Think of what I've done,” Bucky said. “Who I've been.” He laughed and it sounded like glass scraping in his throat. “I’m not even sure how long I've been awake. I can’t remember all of the awful things I’ve done. The internet isn’t a happy place for me.” He walked to the edge of the wall, looking down. “I'm terrified that those memories are also in here, waiting to leap out at me.” He tapped his head.
“We’re totally doing this thing,” Tony assured her, following Sam towards the fissure in the rock that billowed sulphurous smoke.
Thor smiled. “My brother has a very sweet tooth, Captain. It will be a good indicator as to if the person within is indeed Loki.”
Whelp! Not quite the 'meeting' I was expecting but it feels surprisingly right. Next chapter will be interesting to write for sure.
“I think that’s a very good idea,” Rhodey said, startling Steve. He’d been so focused on what was happening in front of him that he’d forgotten that the entire team was in the room. “I’m sure the President would be only too happy to get us out of his house.”
Sam slanted a glance over to Dean and for a moment it felt as though Tony was intruding on something. “I mostly only use it for good,” Sam assured him.
“Pfft.” Natasha’s eyebrow rose. “Getting your boyfriend to fight your battles for you these days, Stark?”
Tony sighed, rubbing at his eyes. “Of course I had doubts.” He looked up, meeting Hawley’s eyes directly. “Ross hates superhumans. Actual legitimate hate. He’s a racist in every sense of the word. So anything starting with him was going to raise every red flag in the book.”
“Don’t care,” Rhodey said. “When Captain America and the Winter Soldier are on the field we never lose. They’re practically superhuman.”
Steve was kissing him like he meant it. A proper, swoony, romancing-the-fuck-out-of-you, kiss that made his knees weak and his heart stutter.
He checked the large wall clock opposite him. Two hours. It was more sleep than he’d had in a while.
“Kinky fuck,” Bucky told him as his smiling lips enveloped Tony’s dick. Tony arched into Bucky’s mouth. He’d forgotten how amazing really good head felt. Bucky slithered up his body, kissing Tony all the way and then letting him taste himself on his tongue.
“The forties were a direct sort of time,” Bucky added. “If you wanted to get a dame, you asked her for a soda. If you wanted to get a guy, you asked him for a blowjob.”
“You certainly have every reason in the world to have trust issues, Barnes,” Tony agreed. “But right now, it’s us or the US government, and I’m pretty sure they’re not going to ask as nicely.”
“Still wanted to suck your dick, man.” Sam laughed hard when Steve choked on the swallow of coffee he’d just taken.
Wanda lifted a hand suddenly, and tendrils of crimson smoke seeped onto the floor of the jet. “Your vision,” she said, looking at Tony. “Your friends died.”
“Agent Coulson is bringing a few people over that he thinks would work well with me.” Steve was almost bouncing in anticipation. “He calls it the Avenger Initiative.”
Thor nodded. “The Collector told Heimdall that if we could save Midgard, then the foul magic would be turned against its maker.”
“Like I said, too early.” Pepper handed Tony a pen. “Sign so that I can escape this disturbing new form of hell.”
“Don’ wanna be shober,” Tony insisted, trying to flop back down again. He didn’t want to see Steve. He didn’t want to talk to Steve. Steve with his perfect hair and blue eyes and ridiculous body. Tony hated Steve.
Tony started laughing. This was the absolute juiciest cherry on the top of an exceptionally fucked-up day. The idea that Captain Perfection would even
He walked into his workshop and stopped in his tracks. “Am I being ambushed?” he asked with an attempt at a smile.
“Fine, somebody’s unwanted Spring Equinox gift?” Tony grinned when Bruce groaned, dropping his forehead onto the table. “Seriously, though, any ideas?”
“I know that, Buck.” Steve sighed. “I’d like to know that nothing I say to you in the future is going to trigger an attack like the one I saw days ago.” He was playing a little dirty, but Bucky was too important.
He left Steve and Barnes there in Siberia. Barnes would call. Tony would help him. Steve was dead to him in every way.
Steve cradled the coffee mug between his hands. “I was afraid too,” he admitted. “For Bucky, for Wanda, for me.” He met Bruce’s gaze. “For all of us.” He took a sip. “Why didn’t you tell Natasha what you were going to do?”
When they’d all eaten and satisfied their various levels of coffee addiction, they made their way to the living area where a couple of battered duffels had been tossed onto a sofa.
“He’s harmless,” Crowley assured them with another little pat. “He only bites if you try to hurt me.” The low growl that echoed through the passage gave Tony the heebie-jeebies.
Bruce ushered the other two out of the lab, calling over his shoulder, “Let me know when you’re done.”
It was all Steve could do to stagger to his feet and race to where he’d last seen Tony and Strange. He fell at Tony’s side, pushing his hand against where the suit gaped open and raw. “Tony?”
I wasn't planning on writing an epic. This was supposed to be fun. Apparently my Marvel love runs deeper than I thought. A merry tale of a threesome has become something more.
Tony laughed then, a genuine belly-laugh that shocked the entire Assembly into silence. “Damn, I’ve missed you, Doc.”
“Don’t be an idiot,” Tony snapped. “Don’t you think I’d have come up with something else if I really hated all of you?”
“Brother.” Thor pulled Loki close. “You did not know that this would be the consequence of your charade.”
“We’re probably going to be on the evening news,” Rhodey said, indicating the tourists taking pictures at the White House fence. “Again.”
Rhodey flipped him off and dropped into one of the loungers with a groan. “Can’t we kill Thor?” he begged, covering his eyes with his arm.
Tony scowled at him. “Excuse you! My heart was broken when she dumped me.” It was. It had been. Tony had always been able to recover quickly from heartbreak, however.
Tony snapped his jaw shut, suddenly furious. “You know, I’m pretty fucking tired of being the team punching bag,” he said, pushing himself to his feet. “You’re living in my home, eating my food, using my water and power. How about a little respect?”
Tony shook his head. “I’ll do it later. Right now, we celebrate our friend’s return. J, McDonalds and margaritas for everybody!”
“God, you’re pretty,” he blurted. Two pairs of blue eyes turned to him. It was just this side of too much being the focus of their attention. Tony felt stripped naked in more ways than one.
“It wasn’t a request,” Crowley said. “Sam Winchester turned down his destiny. He was supposed to be the Chosen One, Hell’s Prince.” Crowley’s face twisted. “He chose his brother, mortality, Heaven,” he spat. “Stupid boy.”
“That sounds remarkably familiar,” Tony said. He’d had to learn the hard way too. He rubbed his chest, touched the scars left behind from the arc reactor.
“Because, no matter how much you try to pretend, you live a very boring life.” Pepper was a cruel, cruel woman. She was just lucky that he liked her enough to let her live in his amazing house.
Steve didn’t let up on the pressure. “You can just tell us if you’re not comfortable with something,” he told Tony in what was supposed to be a reassuring croon. “We’ll stop whenever you want.”
Tony waved a hand at the monitors. “It looks like our friends in Washington decided to decrypt every file SHIELD ever had, and then toss it out for the world to see.”
The silence from the other end told Tony that Steve hadn’t missed that. “Yeah, well…” Steve took a breath. “I wanted to find out how you’re doing?”
Pepper gave them a wave as she left, the workshop doors slipping closed behind her. They both watched her going up the stairs.
“I sincerely doubt that,” Coulson murmured. “If I know Dr. Banner then he’s been trying to figure out how you did it.”
Natasha made a scoffing noise. “Realistic? Says the man who willingly submitted to a science experiment that had little to no chance of success?”
Tony felt a hot pride swell through him and suddenly this cesspool of viciousness and sadness felt like a memory even as he strode past brutal sex and cruelty, Steve’s fingers warm against the small of his back. He forced his eyes straight ahead, even as he heard screams of desperation.
Tony swallowed hard. It wasn’t in his nature to talk about emotions. But this was Rhodey. Rhodey who knew him better than anyone, except perhaps for Pepper.
“I know.” Tony stuck his hands in his pockets. “I’m just not up to dealing with Captain Perfect’s Disappointed Face right now.” He kept his gaze away from Steve's face. Steve's face had a terrible habit of making him do incredibly stupid things.
Steve leaned over and kissed him with the filthiest morning breath in the history of the world. Tony didn’t give a single shit. “I’m going to take a shower in my room,” Steve said, rolling off the bed, tugging his pants on.
Tony decided that kissing Steve while Bucky nibbled at his neck was going into his top ten list of things to do. Forever.
Steve met Bucky’s eyes. “I’m not letting you out of my life again, Buck. No matter what else happens, I’m with you….”
“Something about nanites and Bucky’s head.” Bruce looked at Bucky. “Are you going to be okay with me looking at you, by the way?”
pester him,” Tony insisted, trying to drag Rhodey across the dance floor towards the happy couple. Well, Bruce was smiling at least. With Natasha, it was a crapshoot.
“Thanks, Vision.” Natasha closed her phone. “Tony's fine. He called Vision, and asked him to pass the message along.”
“Aw, don’t be like that, Tony.” Natasha chucked him under his chin. Steve was impressed that Tony didn’t appear more terrified. “You know you love us.”
“We should follow them.” Tony wasn’t comfortable with his friend leaving with an obviously terrifying woman. “He might need us.”
“Nope. Non. Nada. Nyet. You get your ass back on that plane and keep your buddy company.” Tony’s gaze flicked over to where Steve was standing. “I’ve done what I can for you.”
And he stepped into the room with the bugfuck crazy god who he'd last seen trying to take over his world.
“How about, fuck no?” Tony asked. “As if I’m letting you crazy kids out of my sight. Who knows what shenanigans you’ll get up to without me to keep an eye on you?”
Steve dropped his head onto Tony's shoulder, breathing deeply against his skin. “You sure you're not with her anymore?” he asked, voice raspy. Tony wanted to fuck him into the ground.
Tony barked a laugh. “You’re hilarious,” he said. “Why didn’t I remember that you’re hilarious?” He didn’t mean to sound accusing.
Steve lay back on his bed, arm over his eyes. He kept seeing Tony’s face. The moment that his friend had realized that Steve had betrayed him in the worst possible way.
“I made it.” Tony covered Bucky’s hand and squeezed. “Unconscious and dropping like a falling star.” Bucky’s hand twitched beneath Tony’s.
“I wept when she showed me the death of our people,” Thor confessed to him, lifting a hand to brush against Loki’s hair.
“I saw you all dead.” Tony kept his face impassive. “Every one of you was dead. Except for him. He was dying.” He pointed at Steve. “He told me that I should have done more.”
love with me?” Tony remembered this time. They’d started living past each other by now. It had merely been a matter of time. They’d fought it, but they were already over.
“I’m guessing F.R.I.D.A.Y. told you about the chat Bucky and I had,” Tony murmured when Steve reached him. He didn’t turn around. Steve chanced a quick look at the bed. Bucky’s eyes were open, and the moonlight caught the glassiness of tears.
Tony stared at him. “I know how Bruce and Viz got here, but you and Pep made good time. What supersonic jet did you appropriate?”
‘I said no disturbances.” The cold was spreading, encasing his calves, twisting around his muscles in a blanket of ice.
Tony wanted to weep and hold on to Bucky, promise him that he’d never feel like that again. But he didn’t. He knew what nightmares were. Each of them had to deal with their own.
Pepper sighed. “Why do I stay around you? I’m in constant terror of whatever you’re going to destroy next. I’d like it not be your heart. Again.”
“In our day, boys liking boys meant jail time,” Bucky explained. “It meant Auschwitz if you lived in Germany.”
Steve's dazed expression was priceless. He cleared his throat. “Um.” The sound of laughter was an echo in his head. “I guess I'd better listen to the lady then.”
Steve’s idealism was a wonderful thing, but sometimes he was just a plain stubborn son of a bitch who didn’t see the big picture. “Impact radius is getting bigger every second.” He clenched his jaw. “We're going to have to make a choice.”
what you got out of it?” He wasn’t going to admit that he had several names for his dick, including Mjolnir. Certain things weren’t meant to be shared.
“And I will go too.” Vision’s calm tone overrode Steve’s concern. “It will be a show of force to the Collector.”
Steve nodded. “I thought he’d choose to fly himself rather than in the jet.” He stared at Bucky. “Are you planning on fighting with us?”
“Exactly,” Tony said. “Which is why I wanted to head it off before it grew legs.” He was tired and frustrated. It seemed as though the only sure thing about the future was that the SRA would exist. No matter how he tried to change it.
“Working on that, by the way,” Tony told him. “Pretty soon I will have invented alcohol that is strong enough to get Captain America drunk.” He was pretty proud of himself.
Happy had become a lot more paranoid since the Extremis situation. “Sure,” Tony said, pushing the door open.  He’d forgotten that there had been others in this original meeting with Ross. “Richards.” He didn’t offer his hand.
“No.” Tony shook his head. “That was the right thing to do. You were never meant to live this life.”
“But we’d have faced that all together,” Steve said. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I betrayed your trust in the worst possible way and tried to justify it to myself by saying I was protecting my friend. I should have been protecting
Steve felt his mouth curve. It felt so good to have Bucky with him again. Every minute it felt more like
I cannot math. Or science. There will be nothing real math-y or science-y in anything that comes after.
“Don’t be a chicken-shit, Stark.” Bucky’s teeth gleamed white in the fading light. “Put on your big-girl pants.”
The laughter was even nastier than the smile. “You just keep telling yourself that, Tony. I have the photos to prove otherwise.” Bruce tapped his forehead. “Now, sleep.”
Steve sighed. “Agent Coulson.” He shook Coulson’s hand. “I’m not going to ask, just damn glad to see you.”
Tony nodded. “When I left the Avengers, it felt like they'd moved on. No-one called. Nobody visited. Then Bucky came and he gave me something I'd lost.”
Rhodey came next. He landed outside on the Iron Man platform and shouted, “Tony Fucking Stark! Get your ass out here!”
“Then you need to examine your own motives for not trusting him.” The words were kind, but cut into Steve like a thousand knives. “But, enough of this introspection. I must go.” T’Challa put a big hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Your friends followed you because they trust you, Captain. Do not betray that trust further.”
When it looked like he was going to start talking again, Pepper turned away. “Mr. Stark is waiting for you, follow me.”
“Could be.” Dean handed him a card with a number. “My mobile number’s on the back,” he said. “And if you can get me anything you can about Lady Antonia Bevell and the London chapter of the Men of Letters, we’d be much obliged.”
“A friend,” T’Challa replied. “My friend says that you should shortly receive a package that will assist in melting your ice-block.”
“You’ve just got a handy vampire lying around?” Bucky asked, dropping back down onto the sofa, this time at Tony’s side. “Since when is S.H.I.E.L.D. involved with the supernatural? I thought that the mumbo-jumbo crap was all Hydra’s thing?” The anger in Bucky’s voice created a bitter taste in Tony’s mouth.
“Tony mentioned that he’d been blasting you with radiation and most of the nanites had disintegrated,” Bruce noted.
Laura moved away, went to where Clint was still crouched on the floor, surrounded by his children. “We should probably talk,” Laura said.
“How do we get him out?” Steve asked. “I mean, if we’re taking on the Devil, we might as well make it a rescue mission too.” He met Sam’s shocked gaze. “Let’s not bring him here. Let’s take the fight to him.”
Wanda shook her head. “While the crown has power, Set has too many followers now.” She frowned. “I feel it calling to me.”
He’d ignored his phone, his comm-link and all forms of social media. He just didn’t want to deal with people right now. He tinkered in the workshop on the lower floor of the tower, marveling at how much had changed in just two short years.
He nodded at the others. “We should let them get on with it,” he said. “Maybe a workout? Seems like there might be a mission in our future.”
“I met the oldest being in the universe,” he announced. “This is huge shit.” He flapped a hand. “I saved the world.”
“Bucky and I are going to talk to him,” Tony confessed. “We decided not to do anything about us until we cleared things up with Steve.”
Loki's eyes rolled so hard they practically did a three-sixty. “Not you specifically, you narcissist.” Tony wanted to call him on that because hello, pot meet kettle.
“Here.” Steve passed his football jacket to Tony, with a grin. “This will keep you warm.” Bucky’s snarl just made Steve grin harder. “Snooze, you lose, Buck.”
“I am aware that we are waiting for the Aether.” Strange sat down in one of the vacated chairs. “When Thor and his companions arrive, we shall begin.”
“So why were you recording this chat?” Steve asked. He’d become used to talking to the disembodied voice of the AI.
“It appears that I am restored.” His voice was hoarse as he rolled off Steve, unconcerned with his nakedness. “I owe you a debt of gratitude, sir.”
“I can ask your invisible robot butler to play back the recording I asked her to make,” Steve said. His eyes were gleaming.
Tony grinned back, running a hand down Bucky’s chest to the front of his pants. “You know, I think you could be right, Cap.”
“I have perhaps the beginning of the possibility of a prospect of a potential plan,” Tony said, still trying to burn Steve with his brain.
Steve came back inside. “The others are on their way back to the tower,” he said. “Falcon says that it all went well.” He looked between them. “What’s going on?”
“So, in case you don’t know, we have a guest in the tower,” Steve said, looking around the room. The team waited for him to continue. “Apparently Tony came back with a bird he met while he was busy saving the universe.”
“I am,” Tony assured him. “We can talk more about the how and the why later. Right now I want to kiss you both until my lips are numb and my tongue is swollen.” That sounded like a genius plan.
“That I’m immortal?” Tony practically bounced on the spot. “Pretty much, yup.” He beamed at them. “Yggdrasil said that I wouldn’t live forever, but I would live much longer than any other humans.” He slanted a gaze at Steve. “So the people who love me won’t have to watch me get old and die.”
“Oh.” Tony blinked. “The Brucester and I were just doing our genius thing, you know, when all of a sardine a ping went off on the gamma signature trace we’ve had in place since Loki and his goons tried to take over the world.”
Singh replied, “Not if it was your switch.” They both flinched as one of the SHIELD agents handed Pierce a gun. Pierce pointed it at Singh and Tony sucked in a breath. Suddenly Councilwoman Hawley kicked Singh out of the way, taking down the other SHIELD agents in the room before disarming and pointing the gun at Pierce
The sense of desperate relief and gratitude that washed through him almost knocked him over. “I gave my word,” Tony said. Of course, he didn’t say to whom he’d given it.
Bruce’s eyeroll was only mostly sarcastic. There was a little bit of fondness thrown in there too, Tony noted. He peered down at the schematics. “You’ve given an overhaul to the operating system,” he said.
Tony leaned his elbows on the table. “I guess I could go first,” he said. “I mean, the Accords were my fault, right?”
Tony got the impression that Yggdrasil was laughing her ass off at him. He decided to take her at her word and clambered out of the bucket-basket thing.
Tony lifted his hand and put his palm between Steve’s shoulder-blades. He forgot that Steve hadn’t seen the worst that the world had to offer. He was, after all, an anachronism, a man out of time. “Sorry, babe,” he said. “Just trying to lift the mood.”
“Please what?” Tony wasn’t being coy. He wanted Steve to use his words. To tell them what he wanted.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “What about the cosmological constant problem?” He pointed at one section of the model. “It doesn’t look right there.”
“It is just past eight am, sir.” The cool reassurance of F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s voice made him flop back onto the mattress.
Thanks for sticking with me through this. I've been so grateful to you all for the comments & kudos. It makes the writing even more fun,
“What else was I supposed to do when I heard that your home was compromised?” Tony asked. “Actual no-brainer.”
“Don’t test me, bird-boy,” she told him. Her hand came up to Steve’s head again, fingers kneading at his scalp. “I’m sorry for shouting at you earlier,” she said. “I was taking my anger out on the wrong person.” Her mouth twisted. “Perhaps I haven’t quite come to terms with Bruce leaving.”
“What he always does.” Natasha’s tone was almost neutral but Steve heard the pride there. “Surviving.”
Tony smacked at Pepper’s hand as he got out of the car. “I can walk, Pep! It was my heart, not my legs.”
“Stop trying to sound more important than you are,” Tony snapped. “Just think of me as your resident psychic. I know every move you’re going to make before you make it. So, make things easier on everyone and especially on yourself, just do as I ask and everything will be fine.” Suddenly Tony was exhausted.
Tony wished for about the millionth time that he possessed a fraction of Thor’s ability to express his emotions. He’d be so much healthier if he could. “I’m sure he’d have liked that.”
“How shall I survive?” Strange held out a hand as a roar pulsed out of the abyss. “Well met, Skurge the Executioner.”
“What have I ever done to cause you to doubt me so, Dr. Banner?” He made an effort to sound genuinely hurt.
Tony didn’t even want to know. The room they walked into was as large as the last one, but in this one, women and men were fucking on every surface. He couldn’t look away.
“Mr. Stark, my sensors are picking up an unusually fast heartbeat. Are you alright? Should I call Ms. Potts? Captain Rogers?” F.R.I.D.A.Y. asked.
“Which means that they’re not needed here right now, plus they’re bored stupid, and the President needs them.” Steve was using his ‘let’s reason with i.e. placate Tony’ voice. It never failed to piss him off.
“Get it all,” Tony ordered, swinging away from the TV and rolling his chair to his console. “Find it, get it, and destroy any trace of it.”
“Well, Nat obviously does,” Bruce said, sitting on the roller chair and pushing himself across the room with a lazy foot.
“My brother is dead!” Thor roared. The floor shook beneath them and the remaining windows rattled. Lighting lit up the shores of the distant islands. They’d never quite figured out just what power Thor carried.
“Huh.” Bruce leaned forward with his elbows on his knees. “Wanda Maximoff magic or Stephen Strange magic?” he asked.
“The feeling is entirely mutual, Capsicle,” Tony told him, leaning back so that his dick pushed against Steve’s abdomen.
“As always, it’s lovely to see you, Stark.” Strange walked in behind Coulson, his stupid cape billowing about him even more than Thor’s. Tony could foresee a cape-flowing competition in his future.
He sighed in resignation. DUM-E, watching Pepper and Tony together, had come to the conclusion that hugs were the best way to make Tony happy.
Ross sat down, back straight. “There has been some concern,” he began. “The past few years have seen a significant amount of damage and death as a direct result of the so-called superhumans operating within various teams on earth.” He spoke stiffly. He sounded rehearsed. “There has been public pressure for accountability following those events.”
Steve jerked his head towards Wanda. “She won’t sleep properly unless you do.” Ever since she’d downed them all with her magic, Wanda had watched them all warily, alert for any possible threat to Vision.
“The lessons we have learned from our adversity are what give us the strength to fight.” Wanda sighed. “But you fight yourself, Tony.” Her eyes were dark and a little sad. “
Tony turned over onto his side, grabbing at Bucky’s arm and tucking him in behind him. “Not sleepy,” he muttered.
Tony pointed at the door. “Leave me to my genius.” He grinned at Bruce. “You know what I need, baby.”
“Thank you, light of my life.” Tony kissed her cheek, the faint ache in his heart like a bruise that wouldn’t heal.
“This.” Tony lifted his eyes and stared into those endless blue mirrors into Steve’s soul. “Us. Being like this.”
Steve nodded. “We need to stop doing that. I guess the first thing we need to do is trust that Tony has always had our backs.” He remembered the icy tone that Vision had used on him. “It’s time to take some responsibility for our actions.”
“What shit are you trying to pull, Rogers?” Bucky was a hammer, blunt and brutal. “You’re upsetting Tony and pissing Bruce off.” He looked apologetically at a serenely calm Bruce who shrugged.
He looked around at them, his friends, his family, those who were utterly loyal and those who had betrayed him in one way or another. “I would suggest that you all do the same. I don’t think we’re going to have too much time to sleep in the near future.”
Steve dropped his head into his hands. “There is nothing that I can find. The only thing I haven’t tried is asking Atlantis for help.”
“Stealth walk?” Bruce came into the study and flopped onto the sofa beside Tony. “Who are you complaining about now?”
Thor folded his arms across his chest, visibly defensive. “It doesn’t have anything to do with Loki,” he averred. “I merely used it as a comparison for my brother’s insatiable thirst for power.”
Put that way, Steve was suddenly not comforted. “Tell me what happened with the Collector,” he asked.
“You lookin’ for that precious princess of yours?” Barnes’ mouth quirked in a cross between a smirk and a sneer. Tony found it inappropriately hot.
“All of this is happening because of my error.” Loki’s mouth was tight. “I felt that we needed someone of human origin who could wield magic.”
Tony tossed the whiskey back with a moan of happiness. “I’m so glad I made you the boss of me,” he told her. He gave the glass back to her.
“I need to go.” Stephen Strange looked at Tony with something like pity in his eyes. “I need to get somewhere that Thanos can’t find me, or else this will all have been in vain.”
Tony straddled Bucky’s lap. “I can think of a few million things,” he replied, draping his arms over Bucky’s shoulders. He watched Bucky’s eyes go dark. “How about you tell me what
“You’re a dick,” Bucky pointed out as he led Steve from the lab. “I think we’re going to hold out on you for a while.”
“Stop making up stupid names for everyone and focus, Tony.” Steve was apparently in full-on Captain Hardass mode. “I just think that you lack a certain….” He paused.
Tony stuck his foot out and cackled when Steve tripped over it, almost face-planting down the steps. He and Bucky high-fived each other when Steve cursed long and creatively.
“Again with the not telling.” Tony never wanted to see Strange again. Cryptic and sarcastic were never a good combination.
Now Tony looked pissed-off. “This is my fucking tower,” he said. “Who said you could just invite anybody around?” Suggest he couldn’t have something, and Tony immediately wanted it. Say he couldn’t do something, and Tony would break himself in half to prove that he could.
He wondered if Tony had some advice for him. He tamped down the knee-jerk urge to pull out his phone.
“Um, not that I’m the sort to point out the obvious…” He ignored Strange’s snort. “But it looks like we’re getting somewhere.”
Tony was suddenly starving. “That’s because it is,” he declared. He stood. “I’m going to check on our progress and give Bruce the new parameters.”
funny, Barton.” Pepper’s stare was almost as terrifying as Natasha’s. Steve had learned that when it came to the women in his life, he seldom argued. Clint tried to turn invisible.
“Definitely sad.” Bucky nursed his own coffee, holding it with his new hand, still clearly enamored with it. “Steve being sad is the worst.”
Tony tugged Bucky with him, reaching out for Steve. “Facing the Cyclops is always challenging,” he quipped, feeling something settle inside when Steve took his hand without hesitation.
“Oh, you have no idea what sort of punishment Legolas is facing, Steve.” Tony’s mouth curled a little. “That is going to be fun to watch.”
The prick of a needle had him going limp. “What are you going to do to me?” he asked, staring up at not-Steve’s face in fear.
“What you are doing, the magic you have set loose, it is eating Asgard, and will shortly begin devouring Midgard.” Strange clasped his hands in front of him. “We cannot let that stand.”
“Consort,” Pepper mused from the safety of her corner. “I like that.” Rhodey turned to glare at her. She shrugged. “I’m just saying.”
Tony wedged in-between them with a hip bump, nudging Bruce nearer to Natasha and making a space for himself at the bar. Bucky and Steve joined them a moment later, finding their own spots around the elegant counter.
An arrow thunked into a tree barely millimeters from Tony's head. Clint's gaze was steely. “Get your ass on the plane and nobody gets hurt.”
“Well, she’d first have to get past JARVIS,” Tony amended, whimpering when she stepped on his foot with a stiletto-sharp heel.
She flicked his ear. “Don’t do that.” Her tone was fond. “You’re exactly what he needed. The rest of us have been hovering.”
Steve laughed. “I doubt that will save any time. Or water.” He bent down to kiss Tony again. “A quick reminder. I am in love with you. I want to be with you forever. Let’s get on with living.”
Clint raised a hand. “I can go.” He shrugged. “Not as if anything is happening here right now, and you can always call us back when you need us.”
Steve ignored Tony’s grumble. “We need to get in and out as fast as we can,” he said, pulling the piece of paper that Sam Winchester had given him out of his pocket. “Tony, you’re up.”
“Burgers and fries with beer, now that’s real food,” Dean said. He and Bucky were clearly soul-mates, Tony thought.
“You need help, you call us.’ Tony gave Sam a card. “That number will give you direct access to F.R.I.D.A.Y.  I’ll get the call at once.”
Tony was just as evidently not about to let that happen. “Hey, hey.” He forced Bucky to look at him. “Are you fucking kidding me right now?”
“Of course I did, boss.” She sounded almost offended. “You know that I intend on keeping my eyes on that crew.”
There was a brief silence. “Perhaps that is why the serpent crown was created?” Vision’s calm tone broke it.
“You already have two of those,” Natasha pointed out. Her mouth was curved in a grin. Happy looked good on her, Tony thought.
“Come along, Bug Man, it’s time to leave.” Melinda May hugged Rhodes again before heading to the jet.
He stood there, watching as the Winter Soldier murdered his parents and then shot out the surveillance camera with no expression on his face.
Tony chuckled. It was filthy. “Oh, Barnes, you are totally showing right now.” He wriggled a little, smile getting wider as Bucky swore.
“The Darkness is contained for now.” Sam’s reply took Tony by surprise. “We wouldn’t have come if we weren’t sure it wouldn’t jeopardize our situation.”
Steve scrubbed at his eyes. “I just wanted to say hi to my friend,” he murmured, almost to himself. One phone call and everything had changed forever.
Strange folded his hands, clearly trying to pretend to be Confucius or something. “And you’d best get on with that,” he urged.
“Oh, Tony.” Pepper moved to the bed and pulled him into her arms. He buried his face in her neck, focusing on the soft scent of Shalimar as his breath hitched. “Nobody blames you for Steve’s death, Tony. Nobody but you.”
“I’m leaving before this gets awkward,” Bruce said, standing and skirting around them. He stopped at the doorway, looking back at them. “More awkward,” he amended with a little smirk.
“He is trustworthy,” Wanda agreed. “He will do whatever he can to stop the threat and to return Tony Stark to us.”
“Brother, your constant need to destroy everything around you with that infernal waepon is surely an indication of deep-seated rage.” Loki’s voice greeted them as they rushed in.
“Thanks, man.” Steve put the coffee down and tucked into the soup. “This is great,” he said while chewing on thick chunks of tender chicken. “Who made it?”
Tony rubbed at his eyes. “Disaster doesn’t cover it, Bruce. It’s catastrophic for the intelligence community.” He stopped. “Barton.”
Tony glared at Rhodey. “Look what you’ve done!” He threw a hand out. “I’m going to be sexiled forever!”
His landlady pinned him with a beady eye. “You stay 'nother night?” she asked. “You pay.” Her hand came out.
He watched Bucky surge into Tony, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him back up so that he was splayed across Bucky’s thighs like a sacrifice.
“Now we let the boys and girls argue in there for a while until they say yea or nay.” He reached out to Bruce. “You were incredible, Jolly Green.”
Steve was terrified. Tony was unresponsive to both his and Bucky’s voices. He sat staring at Strange with a blank expression on his face. The lack of animation there prompted bone-deep fear in Steve.
Bucky snorted a laugh and kissed him properly, lips and tongue and teeth in one sweeping motion that made Tony feel  giddy.
Steve couldn’t stop the snorted laugh. Tony looked over at him. “You think this is funny? This fucking demented piece of cloth won’t leave me alone!” He pulled out a lighter, flicking it on in warning. “I’m warning you, I will not hesitate to use this!”
“This is very not good,” Pepper said as she paced her office. Steve stood at parade rest while Natasha, Clint and Thor slouched in various chairs. They'd been here for over an hour with not a plan between them.
“Yesterday, before he left, T’Challa asked me something that made me think.” Steve leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “Do you trust Tony?”
Tony gaped. True, Rhodey couldn’t see it, but he gaped nevertheless. “How the fuck did you…?” he breathed.
They all jumped to their feet, Steve subtly shielding Tony with his body. “Who the hell are you?” Tony asked.
“And you should be grateful for that,” Bruce said, adjusting something on the gadget in his other hand.
Tony pointed a finger at him. “Aha! You’re totally making like Tarzan!” He narrowed his eyes. “Where’s your pet elephant?”
Steve didn’t know what to say anymore. He asked the only thing that was important. “You sure you remember me now?”
The metal gloves unwrapped from Tony’s arm when he reached out to touch Bruce’s shoulder. “I think that the two finest minds on earth can figure out a way to control the Other Guy.”
Steve hid a laugh behind his hand at Tony’s antics. He’d long come to realize that the snark and quips were all part of the Iron Man armor. In reality, Tony was a very fragile thing. Steve wanted to cherish him forever.
“Tony?” Steve’s concerned voice made Tony look into his eyes. “Are you okay?” He smiled ruefully. “Sorry, we didn’t mean to exclude you. I guess we’re going to have to figure out how things will work.”
“Yeah.” Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “I’m really going to have to think of another acronym.” He grinned at Bruce. “We need to get on that.”
A shrill whistle had them all startling. “Oops,” Tony said, but he didn’t pretend to be sorry. “I’d better be careful what I say from now on.”
Peggy was silent now, but Steve could feel her awareness around him, her essence in every molecule of the walls and floors. “Peg. Are you telling me that Matilda isn’t what she seems?”
“What are we looking for, sir?” At least with the constant voice in his ear, Tony didn’t feel quite so alone.
“Me, maybe.” Bucky didn’t sound too worried. “Tony, definitely.” Tony could practically hear the smile in his voice.
“I have no idea, Captain and while I’d like to point out that I haven’t had any time to actually examine Dr. Stark, I’m not going to be that petty.”
“That’s what I thought,” Tony murmured, looking down at the robotic arm in his hand. God, he knew he was going to fuck this up. Steve would know what to say, how to handle Barnes. Tony was a mess himself, how on earth was he going to be able to help him?
One of the remote soldiers bent over Steve’s body. “It appears as though several bones are broken and his vital organs have sustained severe damage.”
He wasn’t lying. The truth was he’d only found out about the SRA long after it had gone through the first rounds of Congress approval. And by then it had been too late.
Steve grinned down at him, eyes bright and happy. “You haven’t stopped though,” he pointed out, looking down to where Tony’s hand was wrapped around his dick.
“That is very difficult to answer,” Steve admitted. “The team isn’t mine anymore. It hasn’t been mine since I refused to sign the Accords.”
“Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth,” Tony snarled. He reined his rage in. “But I don't want to see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center… instead of a Wakandan prison.” He hated that he sounded like he was begging.
Tony heaved an exaggerated sigh of relief. “Good. You had me worried there. Because that'd be horse-shit. That's not how quantum physics works.” Steve watched as Scott started babbling, and Bruce took quick notes.
Bruce looked at him. “Are you going to tell me what's really going on?” Of all the Avengers, Bruce was the one who just
“I can’t believe that it worked and that you’re here, back home, with us.” Steve’s arms were tight around Tony.
“Not that I know of,” Bruce said. “Although I’d really like to travel back to a couple of minutes ago before this entire conversation started.”
“Hmm,” Bucky crooned as he reached Steve. “You happy to see me, babe?” A firm hand in the middle of his chest sent Steve tumbling back onto the bed.
“And he’s the guy you got the original summoning spell for?” Tony asked. The Winchesters nodded. “So, on a scale of one to eternal torment, how pissed off is he going to be when you two turn up?”
Natasha threw small knife at him. It slammed into the headrest of the pilot's chair, perilously close to Clint's ear. Clint yelped. “We are all on comms, you idiots. Stop bellowing.”
“Everything is so confusing,” Wanda said, her fingers fluttering against his like broken birds. “Pietro would have known what to do.”
“You and Barton would get along like a fucking house on fire.” Tony pulled away from Strange, and peered over the edge. “You sure we need to go down there?” He felt that he was entirely justified in the heebie-jeebies currently running through him.
“We all made mistakes in this debacle, Captain.” T’Challa handed him a glass filled with something that looked like liquid gold. “You and Tony Stark most of all.”
“My eyes are offended,” Tony said, looking at the Winchesters. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. please make a note to get them new luggage.”
“Tony.” Rhodey just said his name and it conveyed every emotion. It sucked. Maybe they taught that shit in the army.
The machines monitoring Tony suddenly went haywire and everyone rushed towards the bed. Tony’s eyes were rolling back in his head and he was shaking as though he was having a fit.
“You say nothing.” Tony pointed a finger at Loki. “We will solve this when we solve this, or you can just get your ass back to Asgard and deal with your shit on your own.”
“You are really slow today,” Bucky noted, trailing his fingers down Steve’s back. “And spectacularly unobservant.”
Big arms pulled him close, one hand grabbing Tony’s and placing it against a broad chest. “Breathe Tony. Breathe with me.”
“You’re also loyal and brave and generous,” Bucky continued right over Tony’s complaint. “I haven’t felt safe in seventy years.
“Right.” Fury waited for it to sink in. “And while I have certain reservations, I don’t want your friend to be more abused by shadowy agencies than he has already been.”
“You’re going to be walking like a rodeo cowboy tomorrow,” Pepper said with a nasty smile. “I don’t do ass rubs.”
Natasha stood in front of Bucky with her hand behind her back. Their eyes locked. “One, two, three.” She held out her hand, two fingers extended. Bucky held out a fist.
“Shit!” Tony felt like crap as Bucky practically collapsed in his arms. He had no idea why Bucky had reacted like this but he was sure it had something to do with what those fuckers at Hydra had done to him. Something he’d said had triggered this reaction and he didn’t know how to fix it.
Next chapter will be a big time jump - be warned. I hope you're enjoying my alternate take because really boys, the team should always be together.
“And that would be a bad thing?” Chayka asked in a softly accented voice. “Look at what happened when you were governed by nothing more than your own sense of morality.”
“Either get back into bed, or get the fuck out of here.” Bucky’s sleepy grumble was almost enough to tempt Tony.
Tony had to order his dick to behave, because Steve angry was pretty goddamn sexy. “It wasn’t my decision,” Tony replied. “Ross called the meeting. And I wasn’t alone. Charles Xavier and Reed Richards were in the same meeting.”
“Mergh,” Tony agreed. He stared at Steve. His brain was still giving him the silent treatment it seemed.
Tony beamed as his teammates all concertinaed at the entrance to the Situation Room. “Pull up a pew,” he invited. “The horny, I mean, horned one has something to tell us.”
“I thought that machine suppressed memories?” King T’Challa was the only one in the gallery who had any idea of what had been done to James Barnes.
Tony was dying to know the story behind that exchange. Sam’s shoulders hunched up around his ears. “You need to stop being so over-protective,” he muttered.
“Tony!” Steve’s voice was filled with panic and he held on to Tony’s shoulders, holding him down while Bruce raced to get something to help. “What’s going on?” he yelled at Bruce.
Rhodey’s eyes practically rolled out of his head. “Please, he takes every opportunity to remind us.”
“Oh, that’s where you’re wrong.” She squeezed his fingers. “You are cut from the same stubborn, I-am-always-right cloth. You just show it in different ways.”
The breath whooshed out of Tony in one startled exhale and …. “Unnngggg.” Feeling the entire length of one super soldier along his front was apparently all it took to reduce Tony to stupid.
“Did I say that out loud?” Tony wondered. “And, hey! I’ve not ever had a sex life to discuss, sugar lips! That’s not fair!”
“I’m swapping all of you for a new team,” Tony grumbled, but the pleased flush on his cheeks belied his words.
Bruce lifted his head. “There is something alive in the fridge.” He had his goggles on so his eyes looked like a bug’s. “It almost ate me.”
“They were killed in a car accident.” Tony tugged at Bucky’s hair, forcing him to look at him. “Where is this going?”
was that I died,” Steve suggested with a placating smile. “Maybe this is the reality and you just had a bad nightmare.”
Steve listened to them speak, trying to control the shaking in his hands. Tony was giving them sanctuary in much the same way T’Challa had done almost a year ago. He just needed to figure out why.
Steve glanced at him, but he was staring out at the garden too. ‘It wasn’t just the two of us,” he said.
Thor gave Rhodes a semi-friendly shove that almost toppled him over. “I have lost everything,” he began.
Bruce stood, put a hand on his shoulder and said, “Have fun, be safe, don't use the sofa.” And the asshole left.
T’Challa sighed. “It is beyond much of our expertise,” he admitted. “It would help if we could access the files that Zemo and Zola kept on him.”
“Start fixing the fucking disaster my actions created,” Tony snapped. He saw Bruce go a little pale. “Sorry.” He put a hand on Bruce’s arm, held him in place. “I’m freaking out because I don’t know how to make things better.”
“The three of you?” Tony wasn’t happy. “Is this an exclusive club, or can anyone join?” He knew he was being manipulated but it was a Pavlovian response to be contrary.
“That’s because you’re important to him,” Rhodey said, putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “He doesn’t expect
“And if he says no?” Bruce asked. “Which I’m betting about a thousand percent is going to happen.” Tony narrowed his gaze at him, and Bruce held up his hands. “Hey, just playing devil’s advocate here.”
Tony thought about that for a second. “You’re probably right,” he admitted. “I’d settle for the father of the bride.” He beamed at Steve.
Tony slept for a day. He knew that because the moment his eyes opened he heard J.A.R.V.I.S. say, “Good day sir. It is Friday the 27th of November and the time is two thirty in the afternoon.”
The bathroom door cracked open. “You need me to come in?” Rhodey sounded like he was hoping for a negative reply.
Clint crouched down, careful as a wrangler with a twitchy colt. “I’m sorry I left without saying good bye, Coop. I made your mom a promise a very long time ago that we’d never go to bed angry with each other. I let her down, I let you and Lila and Nate down. I just hope that you can trust me again someday.”
“It is if you’re a gay man or a transgender person who isn’t interested in women,” Crowley said with a nasty little smile.
Not meeting Tony’s gaze, Steve nodded, obediently heading for another elevator. Tony sighed, stalking to the back of the lift. Bucky stood beside him as the others filed in. “He’ll get over it,” Bucky said, keeping his voice low.
Bucky’s mouth was a grim line. “Nobody gets to call fucking dibs on who misses Steve more,” he growled. “Grow the fuck up, all of you.” He stalked away, shoulders tight and head down.
“About the circumstances of my escape?” Tony asked, grinning when Coulson looked like he’d swallowed a frog.
“I sent Vision to call them,” Clint said, putting a huge bowl of salad on the coffee table in front of them.
He stopped, stared at Steve bemused. “You kiss your mama with that mouth, Rogers?” He grinned, remembering that insane day months ago.
hated him. “I don’t want to be surrounded by reasonable people,” he declared. “My genius needs wings, not lead balloons.”
Crowley’s grin was positively diabolical. “I’m slipping,” he said. “I’ll have to think up some new ones for you two.” He turned to walk towards the fissure in the stone. “Follow me, gentlemen.”
“So, if I say I’m keeping you both?” Tony tipped his head to one side, his question curious and giving nothing away.
“I’ll be Operations,” Tony said. “Keep my eyes on the world. Plus I reckon the politics will keep me pretty busy too.”
“He’s fine,” Bruce assured him. “You should take him up to his room and let him sleep,” he ordered. “Call me as soon as he wakes up.”
“Not to fucking murder you!” Tony shouted. He felt Steve’ big hand drop on his shoulder. “No!” He shook it off. “I refuse to accept that this is the only way!” He felt wild. “I’ll make that snooty witchdoctor give me his precious stone!”
“Of course he does,” Tony said, flapping a hand at Strange’s cape. “God, what is it about animals, babies and capes that makes me irresistible?”
“Told you we wouldn’t let you go.” Bucky’s voice, right by his ear, made Tony jump with a manly yelp.
“Show some respect, dipshit.” Rhodey’s voice was anything but amused. “That’s an Avenger you’re talking about.”
Bucky cupped Tony’s face in his hands. “You need to feel more,” he said, pressing his lips to Tony’s. His mouth tasted of toothpaste and something else, something sweet that Tony wanted to bottle and keep forever.
She pressed her lips together. “We fucked up. But so did he.” She watched as Bruce started taking the United Nations General Assembly through the absolute horror that had been his life since he’d injected himself with his own version of the super serum. “Tony was too quick to accept Ross at face value. He thought he could argue for change from a position of power. What he forgot was that Ross thinks the only good superhuman is a dead one.”
“I don’t think we should do this.” Tony’s cock actually whimpered at his own words. But Tony was trying to be a better person here, to take his time and not jump into things. Not that he had impulse control issues or anything.
Bruce stepped forward. “Is there any particular reason you don’t want us there?” He paused. “Apart from the obvious?”
Tony shook his head. “It’s not fair, it’s not right. They love each other.” He knew that as surely as he knew his own name.
“Be at ease, brother mine,” Loki said with a gentle hand on Thor’s shoulder. “Methinks there is more to this than meets the eye.” He tipped his head to the side, staring at Bruce. “You have held this secret for a very long time, green man.”
Thor's face cleared. “Ah! You have found yourself a paramour, like I did with my Jane!” he declared.
“I’ve acquired several new skills,” Coulson said with a tiny smirk. ‘You’d best be careful, Hawkeye.”
Bucky pointed to Sam who had shoved his wing-pack under his head and dropped off to sleep a heartbeat after they'd taken off. Sam was still asleep despite the earlier antics. Steve envied him right now. “
“I have been asked to relay a message to you,” T’Challa said, an undertone of amusement in his voice.
Bruce dragged at Tony’s arm. “We have to go. This is serious shit.” He looked at the rest of them. “It’s literally the end of everything we know.”
“You were about to walk into a wall,” Steve told him, taking his shoulders and guiding him into the kitchen. “Good morning, Tony.”
