"God Tyler, I need these." We start play fighting as the mechanical doors ding open, revealing a very tired and relived redhead. Her green eyes land on us and her arms stretch out. I waste no time jumping off Pete and running into her awaiting arms. She looked like she needed a hug okay?
"Your name is Peter and you're a boy." It was like his mantra for when his dysphoria got too much to bare. I crouch down next to him, running my hand through his hair.
I'm outside. Black Audi. :)- Lilly-Anne. I sigh and look at my friends.
"Well, I copied the best."
"Of course Miss." I stand in front of the mirror. Why now? This is great. Just great. I hear a knock on the door.
"Don't call me shadow doofus." She says seriously, letting him know she wasn't playing around anymore.
"It's open." My voice rough and hoarse having not being used in a while. I don't turn to face the door, knowing it's probably Loki, he's the only one that comes in now days anyway.                 "Hey Little bird." I spin around in shock, my hands going to my mouth as I all but fall out of my chair, racing towards the man I've not seen in 2 weeks. I wrap my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist as he straightens up. Him and Nat had been on a mission that had allowed no contact as to not give their location away. His arms wrap around my back and he holds
"No it's nothing like that. I'm just full." I say. Dad raises his eyebrow.
"Nat." I say as she picks up the brush. She looks at me through the mirror.
We finish up and everyone is staring at us, mouth agape. I mean it's not every day you hear the 'Emo kids' sing but still. It's a music class, what do they expect?
"Sorry Momma." Dad says, kissing her cheek. "Underoo's. let's move out."
"Nope!" is my answer but I'm unbuckling my seat belt anyway. I get out of the car a lot slower than I got in. Lily-Anne comes around to my ide and puts a comforting hand on my shoulder as she leads me towards the door. She raises her knuckles and raps them against the wood twice. 'Here goes nothing.'
"Michelle Jones?" MJ growls slightly next to me.
"Try it on. Tony will come over and tell you what it does in a moment." I grin and pick up the fake person with ease, almost running into the changing rooms. I pull off my barely acceptable outfit and put on the suit. I look at myself in the mirror. 'not too bad.' I think turning around. The bottom half was pretty standard. Plain, breathable black leggings and black boots with a pocket down the inside so I could store knives without cutting my feet. The black tank top stayed the same only this time was fitted with bulletproof under armour that was undetachable and a logo which I'm guessing is mine? The leather jacket hugged my curves perfectly, hiding my holster which had space for around 3 guns, 4 bullet refills and either a grenade or a knife. The necklace was the best part. It was in the shape of a heart with a single black stone in the middle, opening up to display Jarvis for me, creating an eye and ear piece so I can keep in touch with others. I take one last look at my appearance and pull back the curtain, stepping out into the light. Both of my father's gasp when they see me. I look at their expressions. Steve is stood with his mouth open, looking absolutely shocked and Tony, well, he's being Tony. A cocky son of a gun. I break the silence.
"We can go somewhere else if you want."
1.   No invading each other's privacy.
"If you don't mind me asking, what's your dead name?" Natasha asks, completely not phased that Tyler isn't my birth name.
"Yeah Honey, we want to adopt you guys, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?" A little smile creeps its way onto Blake's face.
"Oh she can? That's great. Yeah she'll be there on time. I'll make sure of it. Tell them I said thank you. Bye." She ends the call and turns back to us.
"The session is now in order." The judge slams his hammer down in the wooden desk top and I wince at the loud noise. Papa's hand instantly goes to my back, rubbing it soothingly.
One year later: Wedding Day.
"I'll come and see you later. Stay strong, прекрасный." She whispers the words in my ear and I hug her tightly, only letting go when my Pap- Steve, when Steve clears his throat.
"Thanks Jarv." The rest of the meal is spent in silence. I sit patiently as I wait for everyone else to finish. Pepper looks at my plate then to me.
She rings my bell
"Get dressed swine. We need to leave soon." I do as I'm told and walk into my room, closing the door behind me. I pull my suit out of it's bag. I refused to wear a dress so I got a suit like all the boys even though mom insisted I got ready with her. I pull on the crisp white shirt and the slate grey trousers, toying with the tie around my neck.
"You want to adopt Lexington?" Conrad asks in disbelief. I nod, eyebrow raised.
"Antony Edward Stark, do you take Pepper Potts to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, to protect and love through sickness and in health till death do you part?"
"I love you mom." Her hold on me tightens slightly
"Oh God." I murmur to my wife who just laughs sweetly.
"Sorry. Carry on I'll just." I slowly retreat to my room. "Goodnight." I yell out as I slam my door, jumping into my bed, burying myself under the covers and closing my eyes. This is my life now.
She's walkin' over to me this must be fake
"No idea, I've never been to a mall before." Nat looks at me, pity and sadness in her eyes.
"You do one of yours whilst I think." I nod and think. The first song Ben ever taught me.
"Hey guys, I was wondering what you were- Fucking Hell Tyler. It's a tip in here!" I didn't even look up.
Wade joins in with the chorus, our voices harmonizing perfectly.
"Damn girl." The assassin replies with a chuckle.
"Awesome." I smile at him once more before running off towards the bathroom. My stomach has been killing me today. Please don't tell me it's what I think it is. Of course it fucking is. The universe hates me.
'Cause I'm dying inside
"I'm aware that the couple have written their own vows so please, whenever you are ready. Tony." Peter reaches over and hands Dad a piece of paper which I'm assuming have his vows on. I pass mom hers and we both take our seats once more. Dad clears his throat before talking.
"Hello Tyler." Her voice was light. Almost as if she was scared that if she spoke any louder, she'd break me. I stare at her for a few moments, trying to work out if she is being sincere or is just messing with me. I decide it's the first one as I give her a little wave.
"Don't sweat it Pete. Come on. It's late. We better get back before Conrad realises we're missing." Just as she's about to jump off the edge of the roof, Peter grabs her hand, pulling her back to him.
"I dreamt that Hydra made me into winter and made me hurt you. You were bleeding Tyler. I killed your family in front of you because Hydra wanted you back." I stood up abruptly. All the pieces were falling together; the metal arm, the cold eyes, the heartlessness.
Your one desire
"You have a lovely voice." He says, sincerity lacing his voice. I scoff.
Within the next hour, the four of us were sat in the back of a black limo as Happy drove us to this fancy Italian restraint. And it really was fancy. The chandeliers were made of glass, chairs covered in a velvety red fabric and a blood red carpet the whole way through. The waiter lead us to a table in a closed off area at the back. They must come here often as the server referred to it as the Stark table. But seriously, this place was making me feel under dressed and under privileged.
"I still don't understand why this is necessary." I say as we drive to the clinic.
[NAT] Urf is into mime
"Fine but you're driving." I shoot back, handing my older brother the keys to the Ford. We make our way out of the lab, making sure it's locked behind us and head towards the lobby. MJ is already there and waiting by the time the elevator doors open, not paying attention to her surroundings, eyes focused solely on her phone. We walk over to her and before I can get a word in, Peter is snatching her phone putting it in his back pocket.
"Okay. Okay. My turn now." The over excited brunette hands me a large box. I open it to find a canvas painting of the picture of Me, Pete, May and Ben. The one inside of my locker. My hand shoots up to my mouth and my arms wrap around my brother.
"Tyler!" My mom shouts but it's too late. I'm back in that apartment, dust clouding my vision. There's a distant sound of keys jingling in the lock so I take cover behind a desk, trying to make my breathing as slow and quiet as possible. The door bursts open and two pairs of footsteps fill my ears, both coming in my direction. They stop. I hold my breath, thinking the worst. Shuffling. Metal on metal. I grab the knife from out of my shoe and clutch it close to my chest. An arm grabs me from behind. I twist out of it's grasp and kick the legs from under them. They lie on the floor, face down. I jump on them so I'm straddling their back, my arms wrapped around them in a tight head lock. I quickly pick up the second pair of footsteps storming towards me. A punch lands on the back of my head sending me flying forwards. I kick up off the ground and get in a fighting stance, weighing out my options of defeating both of the unknown figures. My hair covers my face so I can't see clearly. The taller one runs at me. I slide between his legs only to be grabbed by his partner. The brunette one stands in front of me, glaring down.
"Cap."
"No need. We want these two. Quickly please. We have places to be." He takes his sunglasses out of the pocket of his suit and puts them on. Without another word, she shuffles into her office and produces two stacks of paperwork. Tony and Steve flick through it. It involves a copy of our files. 'Shit.' I think to myself. 'They're going to know all about my depression and. Oh god.' My head is going a mile a minute, not giving me a break.
"What do you do for fun? Other than drawing I mean." I think for a moment before answering.
"Not so fast kiddo. Butt on sofa. Go." I grumble but follow my father's order, knowing that the talk is inevitable.
"That's a yes then."
"You bet your ass." Clint adds. I point.
"What about you Tyler?" He asks once Peter's done, glancing at me in the rear view mirror. I shrug.
"Jarvis did you get that?"
"Hey прекрасный." She smiles so I smile back. I walk through the door with Peter making a beeline for the table where the other three are sat.
"Yes please." I roll my eyes but hand my mother the phone no less, shaking my head when she starts asking frantic questions. A knock on the door distracts me from the bride.
"It's okay прекрасный. Nothing bad is going to happen. I promise." Her words ease my nerves slightly but not nearly enough as we approach the court house. We clamber out of the vehicle in a not so orderly fashion. Once stood outside, I cling onto my brothers arm.
"It pains me that you think that Little Bird. Pizza or Chinese for dinner?"
"I'm so sorry Tyler. How can we make it up to you?" I hug him back tightly.
"Mr Stark and Master Parker are in the kitchen and are asking you to join them for breakfast." I contemplate their offer.
It's only when I'm lonely
"That's my girlfriend everyone!!"
"Baby? Wake up." MJ's breath tickles the side of my neck. I open my eyes slowly, turning my head to face my girlfriend.
"Can you tell me anymore?"
"I'm okay. I'm so sorry about last night Tyler. I didn't mean to. I would never."
"Nothing. Nothing Tyler, we just haven't heard you laugh before and it's beautiful." I hide my face behind my hair as Steve clears his throat.
JARVIS gave some indignant reply, but it sounded distant and garbled to Tony. The colored read-outs of data hovering in front of his face were blending together into a soupy mess of light that hurt his eyes.
When he awoke, it was dark outside the windows, and everyone had gone. Steve gazed blearily around the room, at the empty benches, empty beds, empty chairs. He sighed and sat up, too restless and hungry to lay down any longer. Unfortunately, the folding table that had held his smoothie earlier had been taken away, but in its place, his shield was propped up against the bedside table, moonlight glinting off its polished surface like a twinkling smile. Some agent must’ve come across it while clearing Hydra out of those caves. Beaming, Steve leapt out of bed and knelt in front of it.
“Yes.” Steve recalled the pale figures floating in glass jars, their true nature shrouded by the viscous liquid they soaked in.
Scowling, Tony pushed the box away. “No thanks.”
“I don’t understand. Why- ” Tony started before yelping, “Shit! You’re hurt bad!”
“Yeah, sorry. I think I must’ve eaten too much,” Steve lied, gesturing at the empty platters.
At last, Tony rounded a bend and spotted a figure lying in the tunnel ahead.
Without any of his conscious command, Tony stood and was walking towards the fireplace, where the man stood waiting, firelight and glee flashing in his eyes. Whatever was forcing him to move against his will was doing it by pulling on his body and strained his sore muscles horribly. It was all he could do to not wince at every step as the movement made him acutely aware of every last aching bruise on his body. Clenching his teeth against the pitiful whine that was threatening to escape, Tony came to a stop at the hearth and scowled at the man across from him whose face was practically glowing with satisfaction.
“Thank you. I’m glad to see your arm’s better, Miss- uh.”
He was dejectedly counting the speckles on the ceiling tile above his head when he was startled by the sound of something small and plastic landing in the trash can beside his bed. He looked down to see scarlet hair lady, finished with her yogurt and reclining on the bed next to his.
about to become Cap’s murderer. If it even is him, that is. Well, I guess we’re en route to find out.”
More than anything, it was that flicker of hurt across Stark’s face that gutted Steve. The way Stark’s eyes had widened, momentarily stunned, and his lips had pursed gave Steve the inexorable sense that his cutting words had been taken as something nearing betrayal. Worse than that, it only took a second for acceptance to settle over Stark, as if it was commonplace for people to turn on him.
I don’t think I- I can breathe.”
“Also, Ironman,” Steve said.
“He landed with his ass in the air, and the look on his face was just priceless,” the man cackled.
Biting back a groan, Steve sat himself up and frowned at the nearest camera, five feet above him.
Soon enough, Steve was racing out of the room and through the halls at full tilt, occasionally launching his shield ahead of him to clear his path of guards. He only slowed when he came upon the door that would take him from the bland hallways of the newly erected facility and into the rusting tunnels of the hydra vessel. Frustrated by his moment’s hesitation and spurred on by the echoing shouts of guards behind him, Steve heaved the hatch open and slipped inside.
Swallowing back the visceral reaction he had to that cheeky nickname, Steve sprinted back into the courtyard before their time was up. There, Stark was messily carving out the door with a laser. The second he finished, Steve kicked the door in and rushed inside, pulling Stark in by the arm for good measure. Their five minutes were up, and there were a hell of a lot more rebooting cameras in the courtyard than there would be in this cramped entryway, meaning it would be considerably less coverage of them to grab security’s attention. But coverage nonetheless. Now that their presence was known, they had to move fast, so Steve began marching forward with Stark in tow.
He didn’t have that anymore. And, what was weighing him down now was something more than fatigue. Something much heavier. Something Steve didn’t like to dwell on.
He still reeked of the cologne Pepper had drenched him in earlier that same night after dragging him out of his workshop, forcing him into a suit, and pulling him into a limousine bound for the high class hotel where the gala she claimed he’d agreed to was being held. The smell really wasn’t helping his headache. Neither had the gala.
“Please. Help,” he gasped, desperation thick in his voice. “Can’t you- ”
This particular box of chicken noodle soup was decorated with stars and stripes, and the pasta was shaped like shields and helmets with big A’s. Rhodey had bought it as a gag gift for Tony’s birthday.
The woman’s voice cut off as the sounds of a playful tussle began. The sound of sneakers squeaking on the tiled floor was much too close for Steve’s comfort. He was just starting to back away when the door flew open and the two tumbled in. Scarlet hair lady and a man with unkempt blonde hair and baggy clothes blinked back at him, the goofy smiles sliding off their faces. Scarlet hair lady was the quickest to recover.
“Oh no, no,” Brandt laughed a static-ridden laugh. “Captain, I am both incredibly like my father and not like him at all.”
Thoroughly entertained, Clint passed Steve a napkin to wipe up the water he’d sprayed his half of the table with. A slight smirk curved Romanoff’s lips, but her eyes narrowed minutely as she considered Steve, who was still upsettingly flushed in the face.
“Ah,” Rogers said, void of concern as he glanced down at the gash in his side. “Yeah, I guess the adrenaline helped take my mind off of that one.”
Up until a minute ago, Stark had been rambling on and on in his ear about how pretty Greenland was actually and hey that was a rabbit over there and he should totally pet it. Yeah, Stark was definitely still tipsy. Steve hadn’t been able to tell the guy to can it because (after so many missions spent either in silence or with only the stiff affirmations of operatives, the freely flowing commentary was welcomed. Also, it was cute.) he’d been fully occupied with avoiding fists and bullets. Now, the man was silent. Had something happened to him?
“Fury himself has asked for you. You are to be taken to SHIELD headquarters for a briefing immediately,” the SHIELD agent, a stocky brunette, informed him.
“World needs Ironman,” Stark grunted, gesturing to the dripping ironman suit landing beside him. “I gotta go. ‘Sides, they don’t need me blasting much this mission. That’s your job, big guy. All I gotta do is locate the base’s core and shut down the systems. I can do that kind of shit in my sleep, Cap.”
“Your
And, Pepper still knew when something was eating at Tony. She walked over and leaned against the fridge Tony was glaring at.
Tony had a killer headache. So, you really couldn’t blame him for swearing so viciously when out of nowhere the car swerved violently, and Tony’s forehead slammed into the window.
Heart rate spiking, Steve stumbled back from the gaping hole in the side of the jet. Below him, he watched as the rapidly shrinking form of the nazi he’d been trying to apprehend plummeted back to Earth. There was no sign of a parachute on him. Steve had been sent to bring the man in for interrogation, not to kill him. He had failed.
“If I'm bad luck, you’re a curse, Rogers,” Tony shot back.
Who was he kidding? This was for the best. No more Tony Stark meant less disaster for the world to deal with. It meant no more headaches for Pepper and no more burden on Rhodey. He just wished he could’ve built more. He should’ve done more. Tony glared hard into the dark, excusing the hot tears in his eyes as nothing but the effects of the torrent of air rushing into his face. Dammit, he hadn’t done all he could.
“Okay,” Steve managed to say before ducking into the elevator that had just arrived.
“H- hey,” Barton squeaked again, now sweating profusely.
“JARVIS, open- open the suit,” Tony stammered.
“That’s fair.” Rogers nodded, flicking open one of the miniature compartments attached to his belt and unraveling a roll of thick gauze inside. Huh, those things did serve a purpose then. Tony had always wondered.
What it came down to was that the world was watching Stark and had their expectations for him, and Steve was familiar with that same pressure. Just as Steve was distressed by finding his old things in museum display cases and the Captain America emblem plastered on everything from mugs to billboards for the new historical drama, Stark must similarly know no peace from the cameras and eyes turned towards New York’s prized millionaire.
Then, the sun was flashing in his eyes. No, the sun flashing off of something. The ship lurched upwards. It rose minutely for a few seconds before it tilted on its side, throwing Steve backward. His heart jumped into his throat, and he just barely managed to grab hold of a handle sticking off the wall. The ship was jostled again and then came to a stop.
Luckily, what had been a maze to Stark was practically instinct to Steve. So, it wasn’t long until Steve was standing on the same overlook Stark had mentioned. He peered down into the command room, trying to think past how Red Skull himself must’ve prowled these floors. Spotting the middle doorway across the room, Steve leapt down the steps four at a time only to trip over his feet and crash into a table when something ghostly white caught his eye.
The man laughed even harder until the woman shushed him.
“-absolutely sure you left it here?” the voice of a woman asked.
“Kinda random, I know,” Clint laughed, swirling a straw around in his fourth glass of Orange Fanta. “I blame it on the pound of sugar spiking my bloodstream. And also because I read it off that magazine.”
“Alright, I understand. If it’s me the world needs, it’s me they’ll get. A slightly drunk me, but me nonetheless. Take me away, ma’am,” Tony sighed.
Then, Fury was rounding the corner, and a very disgruntled Tony Stark trailed after.
Choking on his water, Steve coughed, banged a fist against his chest a few times, and finally spluttered, “Sorry,
As they stood beside the small jet, watching the ironman suit approach through the downpour outside the hanger, Steve made up his mind and turned to face Stark.
“Rise and shine, Captain,” a staticky voice echoed around him.
Suddenly aware he was practically dragging Stark along and surprised by the hitch in Stark’s voice, Steve released him immediately.
“Payback is payback, Tony,” Pepper sang. “It’s not for a few weeks, anyway.”
memory lane) were balanced on his bedside table, and Steve might’ve occupied himself with them if he had functioning fingers. As it was, his only accessible entertainment was the hum of conversation in the room, but after an agent hissed to his friend who was complaining loudly about her girlfriend, “Lower your voice, Captain America’s
Tony had no idea how long ago it had been that there’d been enough of a lull in the fight for him to reach for the band on his wrist and call the ironman suit. Hopefully long enough ago to give the suit time to reach him before he shattered his bones on a stalagmite.
“Right, because reprogramming my laptop to do nothing but play the Strawberry Shortcake movie on a loop at full volume was worth your time.”
“Right, right, you haven’t been here very long, right.” Barton gave an apologetic smile that proceeded to grow into a borderline wicked grin. “That just means I get to introduce you to the culinary wonders of today! Starting with the cream of the crop, the pizza. If it’s a yes to an evening of flavor discovery, that is.”
The man just shook his head, chuckling. “You don’t have a choice, Stark.”
“Uh huh,” Stark mumbled back. “Coming up on the belly of the beast, now.”
“Hey, save the murder eyes for the shitheads inside,” Stark just giggled before shooting off for the door and hollering into the comm, “Full speed ahead, Spangles!”
“Hey, I only meddle where it’s worth my time,” Tony said, a hand over his chest in mock offense.
More useless ramblings. This conversation wasn’t going anywhere. Tony would have to be more direct about what he wanted to know. Before he could decide on how best to phrase “you better wisen up and tell me what you’ve done with Captain America in the next three seconds or I’ll fucking eviscerate you,” the man spoke up again, a curious expression on his face.
Standing, Steve poked at his ribs and flexed his hands. Everything seemed to have healed nicely enough, so he picked up his shield and started for the door, thinking of the vending machine on level two. He’d have to make a stop at his locker first to pick up some change, and maybe he’d have to use some of it to buy the silence of any janitors he crossed since the nurses didn’t want him on his feet until-
He glanced at Pepper, and she gave him a fond smile. “No, it never does.”
Somehow, Steve had ended up squeezed into a booth with two people, who had been strangers up until little more than an hour ago, together chowing down on two large pizzas laden in discounted (thankyou, coupons) toppings. He supposed their shared work experience at SHIELD did a lot to feed conversation. Regardless of the reason for them not growing bored with him yet, Steve was thoroughly enjoying himself. It had been a lifetime since he’d felt as relaxed as this. Plus, apparently pizza was fucking heavenly. He could now understand that all the clamor over it was well-earned.
Rogers’s eyebrows shot up.
Halfway through the flight into the midwestern US, JARVIS had made the suggestion of testing the long distance targeting system he’d developed last weekend. It was a bit overkill to knock the plane out of the sky and send the guy to a fiery death, so Tony had hesitated. But then the contorted faces of the organization’s victims had flashed before his eyes, and he’d agreed.
“Their surveillance is dead, and the nearest guards are stationed far enough off that they won’t hear a thing,” Stark countered, and his next careless blast would’ve landed square on Steve’s face if he hadn’t twisted the guard he was wrestling with in the snow over him in time.
"Children, this is Mrs and Mrs Stark-Jones, they're looking to adopt, you all know the drill, downstairs only."
"Morning ребенок паук. One or two pancakes guys?"
He turns around to see me and Nat staring at him with amused expressions. He freezes before turning around and continuing as if we weren't there. I shake my head at the man child as I pull out a chair at the table, Nat soon joining me.
Plus something here that oozes
She starts jumping about like he does in the movie then when it comes to Rapunzel's part, Clint lifts me onto the sofa next to Nat. I begin singing and acting just like they did.
Bruce had been completely quiet before, reading his book on the chair.  But apparently, everyone was a fan of this show.  Bruce had put his book down next to him, his eyes now fixated on the television.  Steve moved to the edge of the couch to join Tony.
“Yes, well. I’m glad that you’re glad,” Steve motioned at one of the armchairs. “Please sit down, sir.”
Tony smiled, innocently. “I’m just pointing out that wrinkles also result from bad, annoying moments of my life.” Steve was exasperated, yet still smiling, which he thought might become a regular thing in this relationship of theirs. “Steeeve, tell me my frown lines are handsome, too,” Tony whined, jokingly.
Steve dragged his eyes away from where his hand had been mapping out the ridges of Tony’s abdomen. “Hmm?”
“So, I was thinking,” Steve continued, “maybe later, we could have dinner or something.”
“It is, though,” Steve insisted. “I’m just worried about you.”
Before he could even react, he felt a sharp pain in his neck, followed quickly by darkness flooding his vision. As he felt his body start to fall forward, he used his last bit of strength to aim for the ground next to Tony. Steve felt unconsciousness gripping him, but he tried to fight it to hear something from these captors that could help them.
Natasha had gone off to calm the Hulk, who had caused most of the destruction and Clint and Tony were already bickering like schoolboys, so Steve was coordinating with law enforcement when Thor strode up to him and pulled him into a surprise hug.
-------------------------------------------
“Dinner,” Tony repeated. Steve gave a small laugh.
“No, we haven’t,” Clint responded. “JARVIS?”
He couldn’t believe how much Steve affected him. And how much he seemed to affect Steve. It was a mystery how they’d ever thought they couldn’t get along. But then again, it also made perfect sense. Love was awful close to hate.
Steve shrugged and filled it in, smiling at the sight of Tony mouthing along to the lyrics as the music filtered throughout the workshop.
“Well, so have I,” Steve said. “Tell him to meet me in my apartment.” Hill raised an eyebrow, but gave Steve a single nod.
Tony looked at him, this man who had been through so much. Who was born in 1918, yet was somehow here with him as a twenty-eight year old. A man he might never have met if the universe or whatever hadn’t decided to bring them together. A man who he was pretty sure he was in love with, if not intensely infatuated with.
When he came to again, the ground and the air felt cold and damp. He opened his eyes and saw nothing but dark, wet stone. He lifted himself into a seated position, noticing his bound hands, and looked around at the cell they’d thrown him in.
Steve took the crossword with him, along with a mug of coffee, and made his way down to Tony’s lab. Before he’d even opened the door, he could hear Tony’s music as well as JARVIS and Tony’s voices floating above the noise. Steve entered his access code and pulled open the door, the music lowering upon his entrance.
Tony shrugged. “Takes a lot more than a bomb to keep me out of there.”
“I gotta say, that was a first for me,” Tony spoke into the comfortable quiet they’d been laying in. He was stretched out on his back, the sweat drying on his skin and causing goosebumps.
“I like you too, Steve,” Tony whispered, so Steve opened his eyes to look into Tony’s. He had a serious expression, the likes of which Steve hadn’t seen that often. He couldn’t prevent the way his hand gripped Tony tighter.
Tony’s voice gave out, and he stared down at his hands on the workbench, trying to collect his thoughts. He didn’t think he could look at Steve and see pity in his eyes. But Steve always surprised him.
He supposed their only hope was for their team to find them before Tony finished building the sonic taser. And before they could do too much damage to Steve.
“Well, thank God for the serum,” Tony said, his voice still shaky despite the teasing tone.
“It’s just recently that I found a few of his things in some of the storage lockers he had records of.  There wasn’t anything of real significance, not anymore anyway.  But I don’t know.  It was strange, having him in my thoughts again.  Honestly, I haven’t thought about him much since the whole Vanko thing years ago,” Tony shrugged.  “It was weird not telling you about it.”
“As you wish, Captain.”
“I can honestly say that I’ve never been carried into the bedroom,” Tony smirked, winking at Steve. He blushed and bit his bottom lip, loving the way he could see Tony’s eyes follow the movement and darken with desire. Steve released his lip and shuddered as Tony traced his thumb lightly over it, before pulling Steve into a deep kiss.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” he asked.
Steve raised his eyebrows and shook his head. Was that a real youtube channel? Steve sometimes couldn’t tell if Tony was just messing with him.
Tony nodded with a small smile. “I’m attracted to men and women, yes,” Tony bit his lower lip. “I guess I'm just surprised with how sure you are about me- about what you feel for me.” Tony was looking anxious, like he was testing his luck by bringing up any doubts about them.
He rejoined his team, where a shirt and shoes were shoved into his hands (finally). He pulled on the shirt, and hoped that Fury would listen to him at least this once.
“Already?” Tony asked, surprised. The smile that followed the question assured Steve that Tony wasn’t about to complain. “Alright, give me a few minutes and I’ll be right with you,” Tony said, pulling Steve impossibly closer and losing himself in Steve’s lips.
“...About you,” Steve said, his voice a rough murmur, and his hand finished its path from Tony’s shoulder to behind his neck, his thumb feeling the soft texture of Tony’s hair.
Or they were willing to be killed or arrested for their cause. That level of devotion would be dangerous for him and Tony because it meant these men had nothing to lose.
“Tell me,” Steve requested.
When Steve got back to the upstairs kitchen, Natasha and Clint were still there with their breakfast. Steve figured he probably looked like he was in a daze, which was why Natasha gave him an even more suspicious look than usual.
---------------------------------------------
Tony looked sick, but he took a breath to steel himself. “Who are you?” Tony asked.
“You’ve got the dish towel slung over the shoulder and everything,” Tony said teasingly, patting Steve’s shoulder briefly. “Are you a secret chef?”
“I think that’s a good idea,” Steve smirked and Tony just huffed.  “I’ll just hang around, then.”
When there was a big enough gap, he braced his back against one side and used his legs to push the gap apart wider for him to fit through. Tony watched as he did the same thing for his cell.
“Sir has slept approximately five hours in the last three days, Captain, and sixteen hours in the last two weeks.”
“Had enough yet?” Kray asked. His cocky gaze on Tony prompted Steve to get his first look at him in hours. Tony was breathing heavily too, his shoulders rising and falling rapidly as he tried to hold onto his control. “No?” Kray asked.
Steve smiled in spite of himself. “That’s- thank you, sir.”
“What do you want me to say, Cap?”
“No,” Tony said, causing Steve to meet his eyes again. “Come back.” He wrapped a hand around Steve’s wrist, tugging him to come closer, but Steve was immovable.
“So, what is it you’ve been working on all night?” Steve tried to be subtle about it.
“I, uh, I don’t know.  I was feeling nostalgic, or some shit, and I guess my sleep-deprived mind thought it was a good idea to take it out for a joyride,” Tony swallowed thickly.  “Ironic, isn’t it, that I managed to wreck it almost as good as he did.”
One of the men behind him tore off Steve’s shirt, causing Steve to sigh. Now he definitely wouldn’t be giving it to Tony.
-------------------------------------------
Tony nodded and set aside his mug of coffee, standing to join Steve at the railing. He leaned his shoulder against Steve’s, who then looked at him with a small, pleased smile.
The lab, then, Steve thought. He wasn’t surprised. That was usually where Tony was when no one had seen him. He glanced down at the crossword in his hands and smiled at the memory of asking for Tony’s help only last week. It felt like a lifetime ago.
Steve smiled and pulled a stool over to Tony’s workstation. If he ignored the gaping hole in the ceiling, he could almost pretend that the last week had never happened. He watched Tony for a moment as he sipped his coffee and messed around with his holograms in ways Steve might never fully comprehend. He was wearing a soft-looking black t-shirt with a logo on the front that was probably some band Steve had never heard of.
Tony still looked like he was about to argue, but Steve wasn’t finished.
“Yeah, and I’m sure it won’t be our last.” But Steve only sounded matter-of-fact, maybe even fond. “Wasn’t much of a fight, though. There wasn’t even yelling.”
“When do you go back?” Tony finally brought himself to ask. He’d waited until they’d finished showering and collapsed into bed, sated for the moment but knowing Steve, ready for round two in short order.
Steve’s eyes returned to his face, as his fingers settled into the dip of his spine. “Yeah?” His hushed tone matched Tony’s, although there was no reason they should be quiet, except that it made them seem more alone somehow- more intimately isolated.
Tony didn’t let him attempt to finish the question. “Yeah, some. I haven’t been down here long. Probably rolled out of bed a little before you.” Tony gave Steve a small smile, but he faltered when he caught the annoyed look on Steve’s face. So he hadn’t fooled him, then.
He didn’t know it could be like this. God, how could he not have known?
“Just tell me this,” Fury continued. “Is there anything I should know right now? Anything that could be a threat to national security?”
The next morning, Tony told Kray that he would cooperate, which meant that Tony was taken away to wherever they were having him build the sonic taser. Steve was left alone in his cell with nothing to do or think about, except whether they were treating Tony alright or giving him food or water.
Steve looked behind him at Tony, who grinned in response. That had to be the last surprise up his sleeve.
Steve gave a small laugh and rubbed his hand against Tony’s smooth back. “Sorry, I was just enjoying the view. I like this one, too,” Steve let his eyes wander lower, before returning to Tony’s face. Tony was grinning and shaking his head at Steve.
“I won’t say that it’s always been easy, Tony,” Steve started. He’d never actually spoken about this out loud with anyone. “I definitely was confused for a long time, thinking there was something wrong with me or that there was no one feeling the way I felt- like I didn’t belong. I thought I was in love with Peggy, I really did. But I think I was just so grateful to have a woman interested in me for once. And she was so beautiful and confident and sure of herself.” All of Tony’s attention was on Steve, with focused intensity.
Steve shrugged and dragged his hand over the back of his neck. “Not really. I mean, I can basically cook steak and scrambled eggs, and that’s it.” Tony smirked and Steve could feel a familiar blush spreading over his neck. “I got some help from the internet for the potatoes,” he admitted.
“I love him, Nat,” Steve said quietly. “I really do.”
Kray motioned to the man, directing his next words to Tony. “I don’t like to get my hands dirty, myself,” Kray said, smiling. “But Blade, here-- well, you can probably guess that he likes his knives.”
Tony turned around, catching Steve’s dark gaze and the way he was biting his bottom lip. Tony raised an eyebrow and winked at Steve. “Are you coming, or not?” he asked, as he sidled into the bathroom. The sound of the shower turning on prompted Steve to clamber out of the bed after him.
Tony began to stir, so Steve ended his examination of his scars, letting his hand rest again on Tony’s stomach. Tony shifted his own hand on top of Steve’s, lightly tracing the tendons with his fingertips.
“Steve,” Tony murmured, his voice hoarse somehow.
And this was all only after a few hours of being with the man. He hadn’t even really talked to Tony, like he’d planned, about where this was going. All he knew was that Tony was willing to take a chance with Steve, and Steve loved him for that display of trust.
“Maybe not,” Tony relents, but he isn’t done. “I just-- in that cave, I realized I had nothing and no one, at least where it counted. Ten years later and nothing has changed.”
Kray himself was missing, but Steve couldn’t imagine it would be for too long, with the combined minds of SHIELD and Tony Stark looking for him.
Tony blinked up at him in thought, but eventually shook his head. “Can we talk in the morning? I just don’t want to think about it right now.” Steve nodded in understanding and gave Tony a soft kiss, before laying his head down and pulling Tony against him.
“It was my dad’s car,” Tony said quietly.
They were both breathing heavily, Tony’s hand hot on Steve’s lower back. “If you try to tell me you’re not interested now,” Steve said, his voice gravelly. “I don’t think I’d believe you.” Tony laughed and clutched Steve harder.
“Later?” Tony seemed distracted by Steve’s lips, until he registered what he’d said and looked up sharply. “Wait, later? Why ‘later’? What’s ‘later’?”
He stood up and looked down the hallway for Tony, but no one was coming yet. He wasn’t sure if he was supposed to stay there and wait, or break out of his cell right then. He didn’t have to wonder long before he could hear the sounds of shouting, fast-approaching. Guards holding Tony rounded the corner and quickly shoved him into his cell.
“Iron Man’s not a weapon, Tony. You’ve said so yourself.”
Fury’s intense tone washed over them, causing their smiles to fade fast.
“Those women were really talented.  I mean, I can’t do any of that stuff,” Steve shook his head in amazement.  “I think Ginger should win.  She has the most touching backstory, what with her relationship with her father and everything.  And you can tell she really wants it.”
When Steve woke up a few hours later, he was a little sticky and a lot warm, but nothing outside of an Avengers call to assemble was gonna make him move from this bed. Steve was curled around Tony’s back, his arm slung over his waist. He could feel Tony’s heart beating steadily through his back, and it made a deep ache of longing flood through Steve’s body. No one else had made him feel like this, and he couldn’t understand how he’d ever thought he was in love before now.
Everyone was kind of quiet for a second, before Tony spoke.
He’d have thought that the little time they spent not working (in other words, battling super villains) would’ve interfered with television knowledge.  But there was still a lot that Steve didn’t understand about this century.
The man in question approached Tony from across the sand, a smile on his face and a flush covering his skin from the cold water and exertion. The wet swim trunks were in fact clinging to him so as to leave little to the imagination. Tony felt a little like his arc reactor was failing, as his heart beat erratically in his chest.
“‘The 15th most common street name in the U.S., as of 1993’,” Steve recited, glancing around the workshop before spotting a chair and dragging it over.
Clint laughed and clapped him on the back. “No one could blame you there. Tony’s had a whole pizza by now. And he doesn’t even have a super metabolism.”
-----------------------------------------
The beach itself was Tony’s private beach, and there wasn’t anyone around, since it was December and too chilly for most California residents to bother with their own beaches. But it still made Tony wish they were alone in the privacy of his bedroom, or maybe the shower. They had had one shower together, the morning after they'd first slept together, and Tony was eager to revisit the concept.
So, they must have cameras set up in here to monitor us, Steve thought.
“Don’t worry, Steve.  It’s just a couple scrapes.”
Tony glanced over his shoulder briefly before returning his attention to Steve.
“It’s almost all healed now,” Steve said, referring to the burn. Steve’s eyes flitted up to see Tony nod slowly.
“I just worry about if something happens one day that you fundamentally can’t agree on- the kind of effect that would have on the Avengers would be...” Nat trailed off, looking sad, but convinced of her opinion. Steve thought about what she was saying, and he couldn’t imagine what kind of situation would warrant Nat’s worry, but he thought he had a pretty good argument.
Steve could survive without food or water for longer than the average human, but Tony would only last three or four days without water. He hoped to God it wouldn’t come to that. They needed Tony alive, so they’d have to give him water eventually.
“What does anyone want from Tony Stark?” he said, not waiting for Steve to answer. “A weapon.”
“Oh,” Tony looked down at his hand. “Just from a soldering iron, I think. ‘Same old, same old.’” Steve shrugged. Another saying he hadn’t heard of that he could add to the list. “If it were you, it would’ve been long gone by now,” Tony said.
“Thanks,” Steve waved the pen gently, before dropping his hand. He was starting to feel like an idiot the longer this went on with Tony giving him that look, so he cleared his throat and changed the subject. “What are you working on?”
Nat considered his words for a while, long enough that Steve had to add one last thing.
“Is that what you’ve been working on?” Steve asked him. Tony grinned and nodded, motioning for Steve to follow him.
Never say never, he thought.
“Alright, then,” Steve said, grabbing onto the bars of his cell and pulling with all of his strength.
------------------------------------------------
“I’m stubborn. I’m bitchy. I don’t sleep enough. I drink too much, although I’m working on that,” Tony met Steve’s eyes across the table. “And I’m not gonna be able to keep up with you for long, Steve. One thing’s for sure, dating you is definitely going to give me a complex about my age.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “You were asleep for sixty-six of those years, Steve. I don’t think it counts.”
Steve sighed. “Tony, the fact that you can’t watch your teammate in pain doesn’t make you weak. I know for a fact that if you were alone here being...tortured,” Steve struggled to think about it, “you’d never give in to their demands. You’d die before you’d help them harm innocent lives.” Tony didn’t respond, so Steve knew he was right.
“What do you want with him?” Steve asked. The man smirked again. Steve was already beginning to hate that smirk.
Tony shook his head and got back to work. He just needed to finish tweaking some things with Mark 42 before he could be done for the night.
Steve had no idea what the full scale of the damage had been, but he couldn’t imagine that it had been easy for Pepper to see. That was probably the other reason why she’d wanted it fixed as soon as possible.
“Now don’t get sassy with me, or I might not do it again. Shut everything down for me, honey.”
Tony pretended like the music and his work were distracting enough that he didn’t hear Steve, even though he longed to simply turn around and kiss the crap out of the man. Steve seemed to go along with it though, because he didn’t say anything, simply walking quietly up behind Tony and wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist.
It was small, but big enough that he could probably walk four paces from wall to wall. He glanced to his side and felt a breath release he didn’t know he was holding. Tony lay in a cell next to him, separated from him by metal bars. His cell was a little bigger than Steve’s but not much. Tony was still unconscious, causing worry to shoot through Steve’s chest. If he was still unconscious from the explosion, there was something wrong.
Steve watched his fingers trace Tony’s shoulder, letting his hand wander further down Tony’s back and following the path with his eyes. Tony studied Steve’s face while he was distracted. There was a pounding in Tony’s chest, a lump in his throat, a burning in his eyes and in his gut that was starting to overwhelm him. He felt so much for this man laying next to him that he thought he might burst with it. He simultaneously longed to shout it out and keep it buried. He didn’t think either would make the feeling go away.
“I don’t know about that, but I won’t starve any time soon, at least,” Steve said. “How’s Pepper?” Tony smiled and looked down at his plate.
“And you definitely wouldn’t be here if I would just give up this stupid dream that I could make up for my past mistakes,” Tony shook his head to himself. “First, I drag Pepper into my messes. Now, you. And I can’t keep doing this. It’s never gonna stop, and there will always be someone else who wants...the suit, the technology, the weapons-- I thought I’d escaped this part of me, Steve. But I never will. Weapons are all people wants from me. I haven’t changed my legacy in anyone’s eyes.”
“Come on, hit me,” Tony mumbled around the rim of the mug.
Gone.
By the time Steve dragged his feet over the threshold of his apartment, he decided he couldn’t spend the whole night festering in self-loathing if he hoped to get up for work tomorrow. Because that’s what he was here for: to work. Kicking off his shoes, he hobbled into the living room and collapsed face-first onto the couch. Hoping to buoy his thoughts out of self-pity, he gingerly picked up the remote control from the coffee table where it was gathering dust. Hadn’t Clint mentioned something about a good comedy playing on a channel called “abc”?
“Alright, I’m backing up. You need some space? That’s fine. But, we have to get you someplace- ”
A feeling he couldn’t name shot through Steve, and he suddenly felt a lot more alert. Stark blinked back at him, just as surprised. The man’s suit was rumpled, and his damp hair was in disarray, like he’d been rubbing his hands over his head repeatedly. And yet, he was somehow even more beautiful than the first time Steve had seen him, especially since he’d gotten past the likeness to Howard. Absence makes the heart grow fonder or some shit like that. But what did he have to be fond of? He’d known the guy for maybe five minutes. He was just charmed by the guy’s pretty face, that was all. Steve had an artistic eye, so appreciating good facial features came naturally. It had nothing to do with how Steve couldn’t forget that lively twinkle in his eye and light laugh when he’d taken off his helmet. And, it definitely wasn’t because the feeling of those firm arms holding him close and Stark’s soothing voice murmuring “I’ve got you” had been dancing through his dreams in the weeks since. That would just be flat out embarrassing. Any feelings he had were just because Stark had been the first person to offer him genuine comfort in this new age. Stark had spoken to him as a fellow human, not as an operative under his command or as a director, and Steve had gotten attached. Stupid. That was stupid.
The suit touched down on the cave floor. Tony paced around for a bit, with a repulsor raised to cast light on his surroundings, revealing nothing but rocks. There was something on the fringes of his mind calling out to him. Something to do with radiation and rusting railings and snow in someone’s blonde hair. Tony’s frown deepened. What the hell was he doing down here again? He opened his mouth to ask JARVIS when the throbbing in his head suddenly shot up in intensity. His head was splitting now, and it felt like someone was carving out his insides.
“Uh huh, just like you would love a long dinner conversation with Justin Hammer.” She crossed her arms with a smug smile.
“Why? Are there overnight-ers in Medical?”
“Come here, Stark.”
“Thought I’d lost you, buddy,” he whispered before grimacing. He was talking to a metal disk. He seriously needed actual friends.
“Not that this hasn’t all been riveting beyond belief, but my ride’s here,” Tony grinned as the suit wrapped around him.
Pushing aside the way his heart crumpled at how distress cracked the captain’s voice, Tony hastily slowed them down and then began a gradual descent.
“Uh, see- see you around,” Tony said, squirming under Rogers’s wide-eyed stare.
Steve stared as the robot rose through the hole into the ship until its face was across from his and he could see his own stiff expression reflected off the shiny helmet.
Tony strolled into the kitchen and dropped heavily onto a stool at the kitchen island.
Balling his fists, Tony swung his legs off the couch and was about to lunge for the man when he found he couldn’t lift either of his legs. Yeah, they were banged up, but surely he could still walk, right? He’d just moved them a second ago, so it’s not like he was paralyzed. Tony shoved his hands against the couch, trying to lift himself that way. Again, he didn’t budge.
“No, no, it’s fine. You’re good!” Barton laughed. “No need to apologize for being hungry, especially not to me.”
“Oh good,” Stark huffed. “This place gives me the creeps. It’s all old and empty. You’d think they’d have more guards walking around their precious Hydra vessel. But maybe that’s just it: they think it’s sacred ground or something. What I’d really like to know is what they lined the containment of this core with to block all of my sensors from picking up on the radiation. Really pisses me off, but I’m also intrigued.”
“Yes, that is what I’m saying.”
At that moment, the patrol stormed into the room. Steve crouched beneath the table, waiting for one of them to wander close enough and steadying his breathing (Damn, was he seriously that worked up over Stark to merit borderline hyperventilation?). He watched impatiently, noting their positions, as they dispersed throughout the lab, waving the feeble beams of their flashlights around, until some idiot decided it would be a real bright idea to flick on the light switch and make their hunt easier.
“Listen, Rogers, you have to at least let me know if you suffered any injuries,” Tony said, turning his attention to the slashes on Rogers’s legs and- “Holy shit, Cap, your hands, they’re- What
As the jet descended into the snow-covered tundra, Steve fought back the urge to groan at the sight of all that glaring white ice and the memory that came with it. They touched down some distance from the enemy base (thanks to cloaking technology, they didn’t need to land too far off) and stepped out into the biting cold. Thankfully, Steve’s body ran hot enough that he didn’t need to layer on coats that would interfere with his mobility, but he could still feel the chilly air prickling at his face. Maybe he really should’ve brought that scarf Stark had tossed at him back in SHIELD’s assorted equipment room where he’d acquired his thicker suit and snow boots.
Bruised as he was, Stark was still alive. Whoever these fuckers were, their intent must be only to rough up and apprehend Stark, not kill him. If Stark gave in, the guards would let him away from the cliff, and Steve could get over there and free him anyway.
“Steve Rogers. And, um, you guys aren’t in trouble,” Steve said, worriedly eying the dampening armpits of Agent Barton’s t-shirt. “At least, not with me.”
“Dunno. Wait, do you think he’s been avoiding me? Should I bake an apology apple pie?”
Aaah shit. That really didn’t help things.
“Oh yeah. Stark’s big news in this town,” Clint nodded.
Pepper’s lips dipped into a disapproving frown for a second, but it didn’t last. She hopped onto the stool opposite him. “Okay, but only because you look like you need it, and you’ve been unsettlingly well-behaved lately.”
Steve thought of his plans to gnaw away at a granola bar dispensed by SHIELD’s rattly vending machine before returning to haunt the aisles of shelved case files in the sub-levels of the compound. Then he considered the dishevelled man before him whose eyes were alight with excitement and promised him food and company.
And that was all Tony was going to get because now there were bullets pinging off the back of his armor. It didn’t take very long for Tony to down the horde of guards once he noticed whatever force had been controlling him earlier was gone and he’d regained autonomy. But in all the smoke of the fight, the man who had been terrorizing Tony only a minute ago had taken off. Cursing, Tony rose the suit into the air and rocketed out of the room and down the hall.
“I’m so sorry, Mr. Stark! I didn’t see the car coming, and I had to turn! They just pulled up right in front of me! Are you alright? I am
a boat load of shiny tech, though. I’m gonna play with it.”
The air whistling over his skin and the way his guts were plunging pulled the memory of his last day in 1945 over him in a rush until Steve was completely convinced that the sprawling countryside he saw beneath him was really the endless tundra and he’d soon be met by the crushing cold and drowned in that same inky blackness.
Disregarding the pain shooting up his limbs upon impact, Steve struggled up onto his hands and knees. Icy water lapped at his fingertips, and the slap of water against glass sounded from ahead of him. Steve stilled. The water was entering through the hole in the cage’s ceiling and weighing them down. They were sinking.
“Right, right,” Tony yawned. “Well, tell Fury I don’t work for him. Especially not at two in the morning.”
“I’m not joking, sir. Unless the suit’s scanning mechanisms are damaged, Steven Grant Rogers is standing in the vessel’s cargo hold.”
“Eh, I’ve woken up to worse,” Tony replied, doing his best to disguise his mounting panic and confusion in nonchalance.
“Yeah, I’ll get home just fine. But, hang on. I’ve been rude,” Tony responded before removing his helmet and shaking out his hair that had been stuck to his forehead by sweat. “I’ve got a face and all that, in case you were confused.” He laughed a little.
“Tony? You okay?” Pepper asked, reentering the kitchen. “You look… distraught.”
“I- I haven’t a clue, I sw- swear,” the man whimpered. Blood was sliding down the bridge of his nose, a line of bright crimson on his sickly yellow face. “I’m the head of the s- science division. The most I did with the Captain was assist in orchestrating his capture. I don’t know anything about the boss’s plans with him. N- nothing at all!”
“Been a while, huh,” Tony said, forcing a laugh and wiggling his fingers between Pepper’s.
The SHIELD agents hadn’t managed to penetrate deep enough into the base to gain access to and learn the layout of the Hydra vessel where the weapon was held. It couldn’t be learned through hacking either because its systems were too old for that. Steve, being well-versed in Hydra’s layouts thanks to over exposure and his eidetic memory, was to serve as Stark’s guide once he entered that part of the base.
Steve’s stomach rumbled, and he scowled at his temporarily useless hands bound in gauze. Because of them, he couldn’t entertain himself either. A pad of paper, a pen, and some books (all of which were texts on World War II, as if Steve would have a swell time strolling down
In the room with him, a handful of other agents were receiving their own bandages and painkillers. Most of them Steve recognized from storming the Hydra base in Greenland earlier that day. The exception was a woman with shoulder-length scarlet hair sitting cross-legged in a chair by the window. He’d seen her around the SHIELD compound a lot. Her expression was perpetually closed off, solemn even. Whenever passing her in the halls, Steve always felt transparent to her sharp green eyes. Currently, her arm was in a brace, and she was eating a cup of what was probably peach yogurt by the smell of it.
Clint had just rounded out his vehement defense of a snack-food called “Pringles,” and for a few seconds they chewed their slices of oozing cheesy goodness in silence.
Once they’d arrived at the greasy pizzeria, the convivial owner had clapped a hand on their backs and guided them to their booth. Romanoff, who he’d previously thought of as removed and calculating, proved to be pleasantly talkative and mind-blowingly talented at impressions. Though, she did still keep a cautionary distance between herself and Steve. Unlike his friend, Clint was an individual of few inhibitions, which was something Steve appreciated after so much time spent with people tip-toeing around him, even if it meant Clint hollered song lyrics into the sleeping city streets and consumed an obscene amount of fizzy beverages. His boisterous attitude was infectious, and Steve found himself sharing with them his own dry humor, hesitant and stumbling at first before picking up steam.
One pictured a robed Tony Stark lounging on a sofa with a box of chocolates and a lazy grin. The next pictured a smartly dressed Tony Stark leaning back against a sports car and peering down his nose at the viewer, and another pictured Tony Stark with an arm wrapped around the waist of a smoky-eyed woman. Steve wrinkled his nose and hurried past. None of those posters at all represented the Tony Stark he’d met, but then again, it wasn’t like they’d gotten to know each other that well. For all he knew, Tony Stark might be an idle, condescending womanizer most of the time.
“JARVIS? What is it?”
“We have no idea, Stark! Don’t get on until- ”
The guards stumbled and cried out as the room went from near pitch-black to stark white in an instant, and Steve, his eyes adjusting much more quickly, seized the opportunity to sweep out the legs from underneath the nearest three and spring into action against the rest.
----------------------------------------
“Hey, how are you liking the Golden State?” Tony asked. Steve was currently leaning his elbows on the stone railing, bent over and watching the waves crash against the rocks as he ate an apple. From where Tony was laying in the lounge chair behind Steve, he was enjoying an entirely different view that was no less pleasing.
“You won’t get away with this, Kray,” Steve said. His words barely had an effect.
“Will I see you later?” Steve asked in a low voice.
“Tony,” he started quietly.
--------------------------------------------
“Tony.  Thank God you’re alright,” Steve said.  “You should really stop texting, or whatever you’re doing.  I’m sure that’s not good for your wrist.”
Steve didn’t even say a word to anyone in his beeline for one of the boxes. Only after he’d devoured three slices did he acknowledge the people around him.
Steve was about to speak, but Tony wasn’t quite finished.
“Rogers, we need you back in DC. A...situation has developed. I debated whether to tell you over the phone, but it might be the only way to get your ass into high-gear,” Fury paused, and neither Steve or Tony breathed in the short silence. “We’ve found Barnes. Or rather, he’s found us. And yes, I mean your buddy from the forties. He’s here, he’s alive, and he’s very unhappy to see us.”
“He told me not to waste my life,” Tony said. “Those were his last words.”
“A bonus gift for the boss. He’ll be pleased,” said one voice, low and rough.
The boss smiled. “We won’t be so foolish as to leave you with your own devices, Stark. My men will be with you as you work, and if we suspect anything-- well, let’s just say that the good Captain might have accelerated healing, but it won’t be able to keep up with us...”
‘15th most common street name in the U.S., as of 1993’
“Maybe I’ve been practicing. God knows, you’d be eating pizza every night if someone didn’t cook for you.” Tony laughed and took a seat at the island as Steve slid his plate over to him.
Steve kissed Tony quickly, but thoroughly. “We both do,” he insisted. Tony smiled and nodded, his forehead nudging Steve’s. “Oh, yeah,” Tony said smirking.
Two days later, they’d been awoken much the same as their first day, with Steve getting darted and men rushing in to restrain them both. With the sedative, Steve had only gotten every other word of the interaction, but a gun had been forced under his chin as Kray demanded to know where the missing supplies were.
--------------------------------------------
Fury considered him for a moment in silence. “And why, Captain, should I do that?”
"So save us and yourself from the agony of it all.  And just. Keep. Fighting," Steve finished. He was breathing harder than he’d realized after the whole speech. Tony had an unreadable expression on his face, but a hint of amusement slipped out.
Tony sent Steve a fond look and tugged the hand he was holding to his lips, pressing a firm kiss to the skin there, squeezing his eyes shut as he did so.  Steve smiled and wrapped his other hand around Tony’s after he’d placed them back on the bed.
Steve rubbed his hands over his knees. “Well, just like you say, sir. I’m a soldier,” Steve started. “And I have a certain ability to...compartmentalize these things, I guess. Tony...well, I just don’t think it would be good for him- for his health- to dwell on what happened. Not before he’s ready.”
Steve hated it, but he didn’t know what had brought it on. “Tony, you’re not seriously suggesting this is your fault,” Steve said.
“Yes, it was quite impressive, actually,” Thor said from his seat at the counter. “I’ve never seen a meal disappear so quickly, on Earth or Asgard!”
Steve didn’t understand what the big deal was.  But if Tony thought he was a delight, then he didn’t really care.
“I’m just a little confused, Tony.  How did this happen?”
------------------------------------------------
The light finally turned green and Steve sped toward the hospital.  The amount of time it had taken Steve to drive there had given him time to think, and he’d realized that the whole thing didn’t make sense.  He knew for a fact that all of Tony’s cars had Jarvis installed in them to take over the wheel in case of emergency or potential accident, just as Jarvis had taken over the Iron Man suit many times in combat when Tony was incapacitated or injured too severely.  Not only that, but Tony had also built safety codes into all his cars that would pull them over if Tony became compromised in any way.
Steve smiled and moved his hand to trace Tony’s cheekbone. “No, Tony, I won’t.” The look in Steve’s eyes was so honest that Tony had to shut his own momentarily.
What Steve didn’t understand was how someone could’ve planted a bomb inside the Tower without any detection, whatsoever. Although, Steve did vaguely recall Tony telling him that JARVIS had discovered some sort of disruption.
When Natasha showed up a little while later, Steve didn’t say anything to her besides the usual morning greetings. He wasn’t sure how to bring the subject up when Tony wasn’t present to make their relationship a natural topic. Bruce gave Steve a look, but didn’t mention anything himself, returning to the newspaper and occasionally helping Steve with crossword clues.
And that was what it was like in those weeks. Working until he couldn’t any longer- until he had to sleep, or else collapse. Waking after some hours from dreams that left him gasping from the anxiety. Avoiding Pepper and Rhodey’s more and more frequent looks of increasing concern. Trying not to break down in public.
Steve smirked and looked down sheepishly. “Well, you have work to do,” Steve said. “And I have work to do.”
Blade didn’t hesitate to plunge the knife into Steve’s stomach. The impact made him gasp, but even as the blade was pulled out, the bleeding was slowing down. Within a few hours, it would be completely healed. Steve felt sweat begin to prickle at his hairline.
And Tony was a huge part of all of it. He honestly didn’t know what he would do if he lost him. So he wouldn’t let that happen.
Tony raised his eyebrows. “For my migraine or for my new accomodations,” Tony said. “Gotta say, not very accomodating.” The boss laughed, but in his eyes was not amusement.
He used the hours alone to examine his and Tony’s cells. He thought he’d figured out where the cameras were, almost entirely camouflaged within the wall yet still detectable to his eyes, but he had no idea whether they were recording sound or not. They would just need to assume that they were, and not talk about anything Tony was likely planning. Steve knew that there was no way Tony was building that sonic taser. He didn’t know how, but Tony always found a way to use technology to his advantage.
Tony nodded and winked at Steve. His expression wasn’t anything like it had been yesterday. He looked like the Tony that Steve had grown to know- charming and confident and whip-smart.
The next time his eyes cracked open, there was sunlight streaming into the room and Steve’s head was resting against Tony’s shoulder, his hand laying on his chest. The arc reactor hummed, warm against his palm. Steve doubted the normal human ear could hear the low buzz.
And the way he said it made Steve’s heart drop and his chest ache. He was suddenly having a hard time breathing.
Nat eventually smiled, and Steve knew he’d won her over, though it hadn’t been his intention. “Of course you do,” Nat said, shaking her head.
Steve didn’t bother with responding. He doubted he would ever beg this man for anything, but he supposed he didn’t fully know what he was capable of.
Aliens pouring through a wormhole in the sky. The endless expanse of space stretching out for infinity. His chest constricting as oxygen is depleted. He can’t breathe. He can’t- breathe. He can’t-
Steve tested the strength of the cell’s metal bars with his back to the camera, hoping it would just look like he was looking down the hall where Tony had disappeared along with Kray’s men. The bars were sturdy, but they started to give slightly with about half of Steve’s strength. He stopped before he could make any noticeable gap, but when the time came, he would have something to contribute to their escape.
When Kray did appear, they were jolted awake as men rushed into both of their cells, pulling them into standing positions. Steve immediately fought back, knocking down both guards, even with his hands bound. Guards outside the cell shot him with another of the darts they’d used to kidnap them, but a lower dosage, making Steve weak and dizzy but not knocking him unconscious.
------------------------------------------------
“Well, just so you know, the feeling’s mutual,” Tony assured him. “And anyway, Natasha would probably figure it out immediately or else what kind of a spy is she?”
With one last glance at Tony’s lips, Steve reluctantly stood up from the stool and walked toward the lab door. He could feel Tony’s gaze on him as he left, making him smile to himself.
Tony immediately missed his weight, but Steve was hauling him up and they were hurrying back to the house like they were on a mission, which they basically were. A mission in the bedroom.
Tony furrowed his brows, but didn’t feel sorry for himself for too long. There were more pressing matters in the world that needed to be dealt with-- matters that didn’t care if Tony didn’t get to wrap his arms around Steve every day, even if it severely bummed him out.
Thor pulled away from the hug and looked around them. “Ah, Tony! His intelligence never fails to surprise me,” Thor said. “Without him we could not have found you.”
“Who’s RuPaul?” Steve asked.
“Steve?” Tony’s voice was soft and unsure. Steve didn’t know if he’d ever heard him sound quite like it. He wanted to hear more sounds he’d never heard, if Tony would let him.
Tony cleared his throat. “Anyway, how did you fill the long- no doubt, extremely boring- hours of my absence?” Tony asked.
“I don’t get it. Why won’t you just be honest with me?” Steve asked. He didn’t sound angry, just confused. “What is it you think will happen?”
Steve made sure to keep his face open and neutral. He didn’t want to scare Tony away from this topic if this was the first time he’d ever talked about it.
Tony’s expression turned sheepish all the sudden, his eyes shying away from Steve’s, and Steve immediately got suspicious.
---------------------------------------------
“Those are weapons, Tony. But the suit itself...ammo is not what makes Iron Man. You are Iron Man. Without you, the suit’s just...a suit,” Steve said.
Tony smiled at him. “Well, I am a genius,” he said teasingly, winking at Steve.
“That’s a very complicated question, soldier,” Fury responded. “With a very complicated answer.” Steve frowned down at his hands, before looking back at Fury.
“I think I need a reminder, big guy,” Tony said, his voice suggestive. Steve smiled, but didn’t hesitate, leaning in and kissing Tony as dirty as he knew how. He put his free hand against Tony’s jaw to subtly guide him where he wanted. When he pulled away, Tony looked convinced. “Alright, bed it is.”
Steve turned an unbelieving gaze to Tony. “Sixteen hours?” Tony released his hold on Steve’s hips and tried to turn away, but Steve held onto his waist stubbornly. “Tony this is...I hadn’t realized it had gotten this bad. How are you standing? Let alone working?”
Tony stepped through the gap and winked at Steve. “Thank you, Captain,” he said, patting Steve’s chest before taking off down the hallway.
And it was in the middle of another all-work-no-sleep bender that Steve dropped in unexpectedly. Tony was still sporting a split lip from the test run a few days ago, in addition to probably large circles under his eyes from exhaustion, and therefore panicked when JARVIS announced that ‘Captain Rogers has just entered the premises and is on his way to the lab, Sir.’
“To think I caused you any pain, even incidentally. And to imagine if our situations had been reversed...I’m not okay,” Steve said. “But we will help each other.” Tony nodded and leaned in to kiss Steve softly.
Tony was testing the micro-repeater transmissions to the suit again, trying to fine-tune the response time when the music lowered and he glanced up to see Steve in the doorway. He was still shirtless and blinking slowly, his hair sticking up on one side, like he’d rolled out of bed when he’d realized Tony was gone.
“Thought you only knew how to make steak and eggs,” Tony teased. Steve looked up at the sound of his voice, and smiled.
“Let’s get started right away, shall we?” Kray said.
Steve cautiously pulled himself closer to Tony. He leaned against the bars so that he was facing him. If he focused, he could feel the bone in his shin shifting slowly back into place, and he shut his eyes with a groan. When he opened them, Tony was looking at him with worry.
When Tony was returned hours later, his hands were cuffed and each arm was held by a guard. They deposited him back in his cell, at which point they removed the cuffs. Tony waited until the guards were out of sight and hearing distance, before coming over to the bars between their cells. Steve closed the distance between them so they could talk quietly.
And they would find Kray together too, and settle this whole terrible business. They would move on and meet new villains and experience new injuries. The team would break more things that Tony had to fix. Steve would finally draw Tony like he’d craved, many times in fact. And even if SHIELD was compromised and forced to shut down, the Avengers would carry on somehow. Because that was what they did- what they’d always do.
Steve was relishing in bringing Tony right to the edge before backing off. And Tony would complain if he had any words besides Steve’s name, over and over again. He was clinging to Steve wherever he could reach in the moment, but nothing was enough. He didn’t know if he’d ever feel like anything was enough. Or if he’d always yearn for more.
Steve knew Tony wouldn’t build it, but he also didn’t know how he was going to get out of it. They would be watching him the whole time he had access to the materials, and if he didn’t do what they asked, they’d torture Steve. Not that Steve wanted Tony to build dangerous weapons because of him, and he knew that if the situation were reversed, Tony wouldn’t want him to do it either.
“I apologize, Captain, but Dr. Banner has not emerged from his quarters. Sir, however, is currently in the workshop, if you request his assistance.”
“What would I want from Tony Stark?” the boss asked, mockingly. “Why, a weapon of course.” Steve could see the way Tony’s jaw and fists clenched. “The last time you were held captive, Stark, you created your greatest weapon yet,” the boss continued. “So, it stands to reason that repeating the circumstances would garner similar results.”
"Right now, you're thinkin' that after all a' this, you'll quit the team and quit Iron Man, and leave it all behind you. And you think that you'll be doing us and the world a favor in doing so. But you're forgetting something very important about yourself." The look Tony gave Steve told him that Tony knew where he was going with this.
Steve looked over at Tony, who nodded in confirmation.
Natasha caught his gaze from where she sat in the armchair next to Tony. Her brows were furrowed at Steve in thought, like she was trying to puzzle something out. Steve looked back at his pizza before she could scrutinize him further.
Steve grinned, feeling more like himself than he’d felt since the day of that explosion in Tony’s lab. Tony saw his expression and laughed slightly. “Yeah, yeah, Cap. We’ll get you to that shield.” Tony looked down at Steve’s bare feet and grimaced. “You might want to be careful where you step, though.”
Steve chanced a visit down to Tony’s lab and surveyed the damage. It wasn’t as bad as Steve thought, although it was clear that the major debris had been carted away. When he asked Natasha about it, she told him that Pepper had hired a team right away to begin rebuilding. ‘It was about the only thing she could do to distract herself,’ Natasha had said.
“Captain, Director Fury has left you an urgent message. I believe you’ll want to hear it.”
“How did that happen?”
Tony rolled his eyes, but swept his arm out for Steve to lead the way. Steve smiled at the small victory and started the climb up. As they got closer to the surface, Steve felt like the surroundings were looking more and more familiar, until they burst outside into a gunfight and Steve realized why.
When they parted, Tony laid his head on Steve’s pillow and stroked his hand across Steve’s jaw. Steve had to close his eyes at how calming it felt.
---------------------------------------------
“Tony, wha-”
Steve smiled and shook his head.  Tony had always insisted on being the last one to say ‘I love you’ ever since they’d started saying it.  No matter how many times they battled it out, Steve always let him win.  For some reason, it was something Tony needed.  He let his gaze linger on Tony’s peaceful expression one more time, before relaxing into his chair and getting some shut-eye of his own.
“Actually, Steve and I had sex last night,” Tony said suddenly. “A few times, in fact. And once this morning.” Bruce stared in confusion for a second, before registering the words and choking on his coffee. Tony patted his back, helpfully. “Don’t look so surprised, Brucie. You’re gonna hurt my feelings.”
“I’m no good for you, Steve,” Tony said, his voice small. “I’m no good for anyone.”
Steve had set two places at the dining table, but when they sat down to eat, it felt a little awkward being so formal with Tony. He also felt strangely far away from him, with it only being the two of them across from one another.
And he was- in love, that is. There was no way the intensity to which he cared for and craved Tony could be anything else. It also made him wonder how it had taken him so long to realize. If he really thought back, Steve could trace almost the exact evolution of his feelings for Tony.
There was silence as Steve looked into Tony’s cell, where Tony was on his knees looking in Steve’s direction but not seeming to really see him. His eyes were glazed and he looked so tired. Steve ached in his chest, and it wasn’t because of the knife wounds.
“Steve Rogers, you are a delight.”
“I- I don’t know, Steve. I’m just trying to figure shit out,” Tony said. “I don’t understand how any of this happened. How did they plant that bomb in my lab? How did they get in the tower? How did they even know I’d be in there at six in the morning?”
“What you’re doing is killing something before you even know how it would turn out,” Steve said. “Something that could be great if you’d let it.” Steve felt his anger melting away, being replaced by disappointment and a deep sadness that sank into his bones. “You’re cutting yourself off from happiness because you’re afraid it might go wrong.”
The bars screeched as they took new shape, and Steve grunted with the effort. He was superhuman, but he wasn’t Iron Man. The thought made him smile to himself, despite the circumstances.
“I’ve been thinking recently...” Steve said, and as he spoke, he dragged his hand up across Tony’s wrist, his forearm, feeling Tony’s arm hair against his palm. Steve looked up at Tony’s eyes, which were kind of hazy at the moment. His lips had fallen open slightly too, which Steve took as permission to continue.
“Sir, what’s happening at SHIELD?” Steve asked. Fury sighed, one of the first times Steve had seen an honest emotional reaction out of him, if that’s what it could be called.
“I’m assuming there’s a reason I’m in your private apartment, soldier,” Fury said. “And I’m also assuming there’s a reason your recent cellmate is absent.”
Tony gave a thumbs up to DUM-E, which was holding a camera pointed at him. He glanced around at the row of suits surrounding the perimeter of his workshop. This new suit would be Mark 42. There weren’t actually forty-two operating suits, but it had taken him many tries to get the new autonomous prehensile propulsion right. And he hoped he had- gotten it right, that is.
But they were also grown men, and they had jobs to do. Even if there was no love really for SHIELD, Tony was pretty sure Steve’s willingness to help had something to do with his lingering devotion to Peggy Carter, who’d helped form SHIELD in the beginning. Anyway, Natasha had gone with him, Barton had disappeared god knows where, Thor had returned to Asgard, and all of a sudden it was only Tony and Bruce in the Tower.
Tony huffed. “I just- got an idea and couldn’t shake it. Needed to come down here and work it out.”
“The workshop?” Steve frowned. “Tell him I’m coming down.”
When they made it back, Tony’s daydream of a shower together came true when they both agreed they were too sandy to continue where they’d been headed on the beach. Tony had never had so much fun getting clean before.
“Fine, then you get to haul his ass back to base.”
“Yinsen,” Tony said, with difficulty. “His name was Yinsen.”
“It’s RuPaul’s Drag Race.  All these drag queens compete to be America’s next drag superstar,” Bruce explained.
“Well, I was messing with the wiring up there for a minute,” Tony said, “but what I really came down here to do was first of all, figure out what the hell happened to my safety measures, both physical and technological. Second of all, figure out how to track that bastard Kray before he can get too far. Third of all, build a miniaturized tracker/emergency signal for all of the Avengers to carry at all times. And fourth, I’m messing around with a new suit idea.” When Steve raised an eyebrow, Tony elaborated. “The suit would assemble around me in separate segments when I call for it, fast enough to protect me from, say, an explosion. And eventually, could be called across long distances for when I don’t have the suit with me.”
Honestly, Steve hadn’t thought Natasha had been paying attention to the television at all, but she often feigned disinterest while being completely aware of her surroundings...and apparently whatever this show was.
It was by no means fully repaired, but Steve could see that they’d fixed the outer wall where an enormous hole had been. That must’ve been how they’d gotten Steve and Tony out of the building. The ceiling where the bomb had been placed wasn’t fully repaired yet, with wires hanging down and air ducts exposed.
“Was that our first fight?” Tony mumbled into Steve’s chest, a teasing note in his voice. “As a couple, I mean.” Tony could feel Steve’s huff of laughter like a breeze against his neck.
But Tony just grinned at him, and rested his hands on Steve’s hips, his thumbs tracing the waistline of the swim trunks. “Are you kidding?” Steve laughed and shook his wet hair in Tony’s face, causing him to sputter.
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve said, but his voice was distressed. “Don’t apologize. Just-- just breathe. I’ve got you.” Tony nodded, the rise and fall of his chest slowing as his heartbeat calmed. Steve didn’t need to ask Tony if this was the reason he wasn’t sleeping. It was pretty obvious at this point. “I’m sorry I couldn’t keep them away.”
Steve echoed Tony’s eye roll from earlier. “It’s not that, Tony. I just-” Steve sighed. “I guess it reminds me that you’ve lived all these years before I even met you. And that would make me sad, except that I look at them and see all the times something or someone made you smile, or laugh.”
“I see you’re going to be stubborn about this,” Kray said, sighing. “Blade.”
“Or frown,” Tony added. “Or squint, like from the sun, for example.”
The test would’ve gone great- should’ve. But after receiving a headache and a split lip for his efforts, JARVIS was probably onto something with the whole ‘seventy-two hours without sleep’ thing. Or he could start looking into Mark 43...
“Any further refusal to cooperate will only result in the Captain’s eventual death,” Kray continued. “And no matter how long you think you’ll last, Stark, you won’t let yourself be responsible for Captain America’s death.”
“Huh-uh, come back,” Tony said, using his other hand to grab Steve by the front of his shirt and pull him into a searing kiss.
“Three letters, across...” Steve muttered to himself.
“Look, you’re already annoyed with me. I’m a neurotic workaholic who doesn’t know when to stop,” Tony said. “And I almost certainly have untreated PTSD that Pepper, for one, never knew how to deal with, let alone myself.”
“Um,” Steve cleared his throat when his voice came out gravelly. “Maybe we should move back inside.” Tony nodded, not trusting himself to speak. Steve waited another moment, his breath calming slightly, before pushing himself up and off of Tony.
“That was before we really knew each other, Nat,” Steve pointed out. But she just shook her head.
It wasn’t night yet, but Steve knew what Tony meant. “Night, Tony.”
“I’m so sorry, Steve.”
They then chained his arms above his head and his ankles to the ground, even shedding him of his shoes before the sedative could wear off. Steve knew he’d given away an advantage by fighting, but he’d had to at least try. They wouldn’t make the same mistake again. He just hoped they wouldn’t leave him chained up after they were done with him today.
“Okay,” Steve said. “See you then.”
Fury nodded and stood up, causing Steve to follow him. “I’ll expect that full report on my desk by Monday,” Fury said. Steve had thought as much.
“Sir is in his lab,” JARVIS responded.
“Tony,” Steve spoke from across the room, his hands now down at his sides. “I must be the one person that understands what you’re talking about better than anyone.” Tony looked up at him uncertainly. “I come from a time when half of the inventions and technologies of today were unimaginable, and pretty much considered impossible. Yet I wake up and I’m surrounded by the impossible. Every day, I’m learning something I didn’t know before and it’s...exhausting. And on top of that, there’s almost nowhere that feels familiar anymore-  not like when I was a kid.”
Kray made his swift exit again as Blade turned back toward Steve. He pulled out the remaining knives still protruding from Steve, but made sure to twist them a little just before. Steve grunted as the knives were pulled out, shutting his eyes with the effort not to make more sound. He felt the prick of a needle in his neck, presumably from the man still stationed behind him, and the sedative worked quickly.
“That doesn’t surprise me,” Bruce admitted, shaking his head at Tony. “How are you doing, Steve?” Steve looked up from the crossword at the sound of his name.
And it was like those words set Tony free. He closed his eyes and breathed out shakily, moving closer to Steve and leaning against the bars that separated them. “H-how are you? What can I do?” Tony asked.
He suddenly realized that it was hard to sit alone with his thoughts in this new century. He never used to struggle with alone time, but recently, he’d gotten used to technology always being on in some form or the voices of the other Avengers filtering through the Tower. He’d gotten used to how loud life could be with his team, and the quiet was unsettling now.
------------------------------------------
He looked over at Tony in the other cell. He sat leaning against the wall, the back of his head tilted up toward the ceiling, looking for something-- probably cameras or microphones. Steve moved closer to the bars.
“Steve? What-” Steve shushed him. He held up a finger at Tony’s curious expression. The beeping was getting quicker and Steve had a terrible feeling in his stomach.
“Music off, please, JARVIS,” Steve said. Tony dragged his hands down his face and looked up at Steve, smiling wearily. Steve leaned his hip against the desk next to Tony’s stool and looked down at him. “What’s goin’ on?”
“Uhhh...” Bruce mustered, after a few moments. “I mean, are you- you’re serious?” He looked at Steve, as though expecting him to be the voice of reason. “You two?” Steve looked at Tony again, who was doing that thing where he tried not to smile at Steve, but failed spectacularly. When Steve couldn’t stop the blush from warming his neck and cheeks, Bruce’s eyes widened.
Steve sighed again, this time annoyed. “You know, I’m trying to be really sappy and say something sweet to you, but you’re ruining the moment.”
“Date?” Natasha finished, one brow raised. Steve thought that was a funny choice of words since they’d only really had one date (last night) which had gone okay, then pretty badly, and then amazingly at the end part. But Steve nodded, a feeling of unease falling over him at Nat’s subtle frown.
“I won’t,” Tony’s voice was rough like Steve’s. “I’m done arguing. You win.”
“I know you don’t want to see me in pain,” Steve continued. “But I don’t want to be responsible for innocent people getting hurt or killed either. If you think you’re about to break, just remember that giving in will hurt me more than any form of torture would.”
Any protest Tony might’ve had was hopefully killed by that last statement. A sort of fog had fallen over Tony’s eyes, one that Steve was getting to know better each day.
Rogers shook his head, amused, and Tony’s heart flipped at the sight.
Unsettled by the stranger’s gaze, Tony glanced around the room--somehow, he was now in a prestigious-looking office complete with enormous desk, various other ornate pieces of furniture, and roaring fire--before turning towards the syringe stuck in his arm.
“Alright, alright! All I know is the boss has got this grudge with the Captain. It’s something personal. He’s probably taken him to the lower levels. That’s all I can tell you, really, that’s all they let me know!”
Steve was washing back his last bite with a long sip of water when Clint declared through a mouthful of pizza crust, “Find out all about the real scandal behind the uncovering of Tony Stark’s sensuous swimsuit modeling photos.”
Sticking out of the sea of black uniforms, there was a pale face atop broad, navy blue shoulders. Tony knew that face. Huh. It was Captain America, come to rescue him. How nice. He looked nice. There was snow in his hair, and his cheeks were tinged pink from the cold. Cute. And his eyes were fixed on Tony’s with burning intensity. Tony couldn’t help the stupid smile that spread on his face.
“I doubt there’s a flaw in my database or coding, but I can hardly think of any other way to explain it... This mystery individual’s genetic make-up matches with that of Captain Steve Rogers.”
“Stark?” Steve hissed down the now useless line, scrambling under a table as the stomping grew closer. That little shit was going to get them both killed. His opinion of Tony Stark sure was falling fast. But, Stark had saved his life. Steve owed him. And, dismissiveness and arrogance were hardly reasons to condemn the guy to whatever horrible fate awaited him down there or had perhaps already claimed him. Fuck, Steve had to get over there.
As I was writing, I was all worried that chapter 4 might end up being twice the average length of the chapters so far. It was something like only a few days ago that the vestiges of my basic math skills decided they'd make a comeback, and it occurred to me that I could totally just split the damn thing in two. Out of curiosity, I looked back through the editing history of the document, and well, would you look at that, I could've had this thing posted ages ago.
Someone’s…
Clint shuddered, and Romanoff nodded.
The room he’d directed Stark to was indeed coated in ice. Every surface was frozen over except a panel in the back, where the entrance was still open.
.” Pepper interrupted, lowering herself next to him on the kitchen floor and taking Tony’s hand.
, Rogers. You can’t- ”
Also, he probably owed the guy an apology for coming on so strong, good god.
“The very same.”
“What is this?” Tony grit out, unable to smack away those hands like he was burning to. “Possession? Sorcery? Neural implants?”
“When we make it out of this,” Rogers began, leaning against the wall and shutting his eyes, “let’s agree to never partner again. Christ, I didn’t want to think it when we first met, but you’re just like your father. God, I- I didn’t think you would be, and I hoped that maybe you- I hoped- ” Rogers broke off, and he opened his eyes again. His face twisted in a humorless smile, “But you’re nothing but a duplicate of that cocksure asshole.”
“Certainly, sir.”
Steve moved on to hunt through the next laboratory, listening with bated breath for word from Stark. He was halfway through the contents of a filing cabinet when Stark finally spoke up again.
With no reason to stay, Steve left the room and was waiting for the elevator when he noticed he’d forgotten his shield. Though, just as he was turning around to head back, Barton came jogging down the hall with the shield held gingerly in his hands.
“I must say I’m shocked to find you alive, sir,” JARVIS commented dryly in his ear. It was the AI’s subdued way of scolding Tony for running off.
Distracted, Steve took a foot to the face and a brutal knee to his ribs. Blood spouted from his nose, and pain flared in his chest. But none of that mattered because Stark was now locked in combat an inch from the edge. And the edge wasn’t just icy, as Steve had thought, but entirely made of ice. Very breakable ice. Ice that was already fracturing.
“Stark, do not- !”
Who the fuck was Jarvis? Before he had the chance to ask, Steve heard something hiss open over the line.
Steve scanned the ship’s hold for the parachutes. Spotting them on the far wall to his right and dangerously close to being ripped off by the wind, he set to work furiously planning out the best course over to them. It only took a second, and he was already moving steadily in their direction, edging closer along the hole and doing his damnedest to ignore the air and nausea surging over him.
When he had finished with them and gotten back to forcing his way through the sea of guards, Steve caught sight of Stark again. The man was now fending for himself at the very end of the room, where there was another lift to descend into the blackness the cavern floor dropped off into. The ground at the cliff’s edge was icy from what Steve had glimpsed, and Stark was getting precariously close, just another few steps and Stark might slip off.
Bruised and bloodstained, a man was indeed inside. He was dangling over the hole on a metal handle, adorned in a battered navy blue uniform, and staring down at Tony with azure blue eyes and a shock of blonde hair that had been blown in all directions.
Wait. That could work. Well, it would have to.
Before he knew what he was doing, Steve was down the stairs in three bounds and slamming his way through to Stark. He didn’t get very far before he was greeted by a spray of bullets, which he lifted his shield to deflect but ultimately slowed him down anyway as a few stray shells grazed his legs. He hadn’t thought they’d use their guns when the space was so crowded that they ended up hitting their own.
Steve hung his head. “And now his son’s finally got me. Trapped in an oversized jar and ripe to be drained of my super-serum blood.”
“Fuck, J!” Tony shouted and amped up the thrust of his boots’ jets. “I am
Cheeks tinged pink… and blue eyes locked on his.
“Right. You’re right.” Alexei relaxed back into his seat, and Tony fell back against his own, closing his eyes against the throbbing in his head.
“You’ve never had pizza?!” Barton shrieked, scandalized.
“Mr. Stark, this is SHIELD. Please exit the vehicle,” came a muffled voice.
Trying to shift his thoughts onto anything else, Steve stepped off the subway and into the station. He was promptly greeted with a line of enormous advertisements all featuring Tony Stark. Just his luck.
Immediately, miniature rockets released from the ironman armor and fastened themselves to the ship’s exterior, and its descent slowed to a stop.
“I’m alright. It’s fine, Alexei. I needed the wakeup call anyway,” Tony told him, suppressing a groan. “New York’s brimming with crazy drivers. It’s a miracle you get me around without a car crash every week. We didn’t hit their car, did we?”
He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t breathe, and he wasn’t even drowning yet.
Steve swallowed. Had Stark been- ? Was he- ?
“No, I know,” Tony responded, easing their hands apart. The truth was Pepper steered him around at galas by linking arms or (if it was urgent) tugging at his elbow. Holding hands in such a public setting would mean a field day for gossip magazines. Really, Pepper only took Tony’s hand when he had one of these outbursts. It was a good thing, then, that it had been a while.
“Sir, this is a time sensitive mission that
“No,” Alexei replied, turning back around in his seat to squint through the drizzle. All the droplets were lit up yellow by the stream of light from a street lamp, so it was hard to make out anything in the murky night beyond. “But, it… it looks like someone’s getting out of the car. They’re- they’re coming over here, Mr. Stark. Oh god, oh god. I could’ve sworn I didn’t hit them!”
Alright, so it needed work then.
“Very good,” Brandt replied. “Then you should know all about grandfather’s devotion to the advancement of man, his experimentation.”
“Barton, it’s a hell yes,” Steve replied and was gloriously rewarded with a burst of surprised laughter from the other man and an arm thrown around his shoulder. Steve stomped down on the urge to lean into the contact. Anyone touching him (that is, excluding all physical engagements with the enemy, aka his unhealthy daily dose of punches and kicks) was few and far between for Steve, and he always had to hastily smother the surge of warmth it lit in his chest before he did something mortifyingly stupid like yank them into an embrace. It had been especially difficult when it was-
Still overwhelmed by his latest scrape with death, Tony could only hoarsely laugh and weakly reply through chattering teeth, “Lovely to hear from you, too, J.”
“Normally, it wouldn’t be any of my business to call attention to, but given the fact that we’ll soon be engaging as a team, I think it’s only right to voice my concern,” Steve declared.
“Alright. Any idea why our intel was off?”
“Tony,” Pepper sighed. “I just bitched to you about Justin Hammer for over an hour. Let me return the favor.”
“I woke up in a glass cage, Stark. And then the floor opened up and dropped me into some underground river where I nearly drowned.”
Snow in someone’s…
“No, sir.”
“All I’m saying is, they’re capable of fooling you,” Tony returned. “If you choose not to come to terms with the fact that your serum-pumped brain can be tricked, that’s on you.”
“You said five minutes! My five minutes aren’t up!” Steve growled back, knocking back the guards converging on him. Stark was going back on their plan because he’d gotten
Like the sketchbook the commandos had surprised him with for his birthday that was littered with sketches and notes, a lot of them intimate, from his time on the front. And it had been those same crinkled pages that had been scanned and then projected on an interactive screen at the Smithsonian for anybody to flip through. Or the charcoals Peggy had lent him and that he’d agonized over forgetting to return sooner only for her to bust into giggles when he apologized because apparently they were a gift, you idiot, I can hardly draw a stick figure myself, oh Rogers, what am I going to do with you?. Those were lined up on a sheet of velvet in Baltimore.
Huh. That was definitely weird. Maybe they wanted their employees away from the radiation? Maybe the core was dangerous?
“Rogers,” Tony said, frowning. “I’m going to pick you up now, okay? We’re going to- ”
“Mm-hm." A pause. "Captain America, actually.”
“You’re riding the lift?!” Steve practically shrieked. If Stark didn’t get himself killed down there, Steve might just do it himself. “We don’t know what’s down there!”
They even had his stuff from his old apartment (Steve really did wonder how they’d gotten these things. Had his neighbors raided his rooms and sold them off?). Like the chipped baby blue mug that had always been the one his ma would fill with steaming herbal tea that she’d demand Steve drink no matter how much he whined about the bitter taste. Or his ma’s favorite pale green vase they only ever used once a year to hold a single Easter lily when they could afford it. Or the worn canvas bag that would bounce against Steve’s side as he skipped to the library with Bucky, his friend babbling on about the science fiction novel he hoped they had on the shelves because dear god, Stevie, you don’t understand, the last one left off with the ship crashing so we don’t know if the captain’s alive or what planet he’s on or if they’re friendly there and do you think we should have brought more than one bag ‘cause I’m thinking of checking out a few of Christie’s, too. Jesus, they even had his tattered childhood bedspread, the one flecked with little clovers and purple blossoms.
“Thanks, Pep,” Tony said, smiling ruefully. “But, it’s something I’ve been… trying not to think about?” With all his duties to SI occupying his time recently, he’d made sure he didn’t have the time to dwell on the incident. He was half surprised (mostly angry) that he hadn’t gotten over it by now and was apparently just as upset as he had been on that long flight back to the States. “Regardless, I don’t think I’m even legally allowed to talk about this… individual.”
FUCK.
When they got to the door, Steve held it open for Stark and was rewarded with a soft smile. Shoving down the swell of emotions that little gesture of gentleness caused, Steve sat himself opposite of Stark at the long conference table and turned his attention to the dark-skinned man waiting in the room, Agent Samson.
Rogers’s eyes flashed with something dark, and Tony almost flinched away. “Are you fucking calling me crazy?”
He switched on the television, and instantly Tony Stark waltzed onto the screen, grinning back at him in front of a backdrop of some sparkling skyscraper and insisting that no other company had a handle on the future like Stark Industries did.
But hey, he still had his shield, and for that he was eternally grateful. Through every gunfight and storming of a Hydra stronghold, it had protected him. It had been with him when he’d nosedived into the arctic, and so it had come with him into this new century. It was a familiar weight in his hands in an unfamiliar world. So yeah, Steve had reason to treasure the thing.
Caught off guard by the peculiarity of seeing terror in the human embodiment of courage, Tony was frozen in place.
Rolling over, he buried his face into the cushions of the couch. Stupid Tony Stark and all his goddamn advertisements and wealth. Stupid Tony Stark who called Steve “sweetheart” and then turned around and called him “a curse”. His stomach knotted.
As they stared each other down in the pale light his repulsors cast, their breath thinly steaming in the air between them, Tony knew neither of them had energy left to continue the fight. And besides, there wouldn’t be any point in doing so. They had both already concluded the other was the foulest person alive and best avoided.
“You could conquer anything, and now I’ve conquered you,” he breathed, stroking his hands over Tony’s shoulders as if he were some sparkling prize.
The panic swelled in Tony, but he shoved it down and forced his mind onto processing what he knew of his situation. Come on, genius brain, do the thinking. He needed to get himself out of here and find Rogers, but to do that he needed to get past the six feet of over-invested fanboy wrapped in his father’s suit. Also, he apparently couldn’t make any aggressive move towards the guy.
“Get a move on, yeah yeah,” Stark finished, his confident air back like it’d never left as he kept pace with Steve’s aggressive-speedwalk-quickly-turning-jog. The clanging of the armor’s boots against the floor was making Steve wince. “Right, you go do your scouting. I’ll let you know when I need your sage guidance, oh all-knowing one.”
“And he’s on that ship.”
An indecipherable emotion clouded Rogers’s face, and he gave no answer.
Tony rolled his eyes. “I don’t see how you expect me to get over there when you’ve invalidated me with whatever psychic hold you’ve- ”
“Very unlike you.” Pepper smirked.
A familiar whooshing behind him pulled him out of his brooding, and Tony heaved a sigh of relief as the ironman suit snugly encased him and dramatically slowed his descent.
With some difficulty, Steve stood, unnerved by Brandt’s unstable tone.
Anyway, I've finally updated this fic, and I'm maybe sixty-five-ish percent done with chap 5, hurrah :)
“No, NO!” the man shrieked, scrabbling to his feet. There was a fresh cut across his forehead from being knocked into a bookshelf by the shockwaves of the suit’s entrance. Except, the bookshelf wasn’t entirely… a bookshelf anymore. In fact, everything in the room was flickering in and out of existence until the projection failed completely, and all that was left were a white tiled floor and walls, a matted rug, the couch, a folding table in place of the desk, and some metal shelving units.
Stark.
Tony stiffened, taking in the feeling of plush cushions underneath him and the firm pillow his head was resting against. He was laid out on a couch. Soft, orange light pressed against his eyelids, and the air smelled smoky.
For a while Rogers just sat in the grass, evidently thoroughly shaken. Tony had just come back to his senses enough to think to offer some kind of comfort when the other man abruptly slumped forward with a long sigh, relief apparently washing over him.
been dead. It made sense they’d collect his things and put them in exhibitions. Exhibitions that preached what a legend Captain America had been and cranked the demand for him to plaster on that all-smiles persona up to a hundred. Yeah, that part made mingling with people nowadays… difficult. More than that, though, the childish part of Steve (which, some would argue, was a dominant part) just wanted his stuff back. Not even just to have (though the comfort of his old coats and pencils would be appreciated), just to get it off display. God, it really did make his skin crawl. This Captain America gig just kept finding new ways to freak him out.
“I mean I’m standing in what’s essentially an overgrown freezer for World War II artifacts, not the heart of a nuclear reactor. No shit my sensors didn’t pick up on any radiation. There fucking isn’t any. SHIELD called this one wrong, those paranoid idiots. My head is fucking pounding, and I need an aspirin. Can we go home now?”
“We did call. But your phone must be turned off, Mr. Stark.”
Somewhere above him, a speaker crackled to life. After a few seconds of static, music tinkled through: the Irish melody his mother used to hum. His body instinctually relaxed.
“Uh, room 400’s this way,” Steve told him, starting down the hall at a brisk pace.
. All of SHIELD would be raging for his head on a stake if he lost their main man. Fury himself would probably burst a vein in debrief. There were other reasons, too, but they were less straightforward and more… stupid.
The wind and dark engulfed him, and he immediately regretted his split second decision.
Steve really needed someone to punch him in the face. Every time he came across a patrol, he was sorely tempted to let them land a hit. The adrenaline from the tussle outside had worn off, so he desperately needed a burst of pain to get it flowing again as he inched closer and closer to dropping to the ground and snoozing through the rest of the mission.
“What?” Steve blinked back at him.
going to think about him.
“Holy fuck, J! You weren’t kidding!” he blurted as he dazedly flew in closer.
“How? He’s hardly ever not around.”
Tony was about to tell the man to shove it and demand some answers when the fireplace’s mantel caught his eye. It was wooden, stained a dark brown, and elaborately carved to resemble twisting vines. Completely ignoring the man urging him to lay back, Tony sat up even straighter as his eyes roved over the rest of the room, more slowly this time. There was a stone figurine of a rearing horse on the desk, and the complete set of
Steve noticed Barton’s eyes on his shield and realized holding a weapon known for being the scourge of countless Nazi batallions wasn’t the friendliest of gestures. He set the shield on the ground and assured them, “Don’t worry, I have no intention of interfering in your business, whatever it may be.”
“You wouldn’t listen. We were supposed to work as a team. Teammates are supposed to be able to rely on each other,” Rogers told him, strangely emotional. “But you kept charging ahead. Thought you were smart, but you’re just reckless and bullheaded.”
Tony was already high strung as it was. What with being beaten to a pulp earlier, not to mention waking up in the very room that plagued his sleepless nights. And sure, Rogers may be right about Tony leading a miserable existence. But, Tony couldn’t help the way his hackles raised at Rogers implying he knew what was best for Tony, that Tony shouldn’t have been given a choice, that Rogers regretted letting Tony come along. Tony had nearly taken a liking to Rogers, but clearly Rogers far less than reciprocated. How had Tony been stupid enough to expect any different? No one ever could tolerate Tony Stark for very long. And so, he snarled back, “I thought I let you know, Rogers: You do
“Thanks, buddy.”
“Cap, SHIELD’s got plenty of technicians,” Tony scoffed. “Won’t be all that missed.”
“Okay, okay, that’s enough. In and out, Clint. We mustn’t dawdle.”
“What the hell is this?” Tony rasped, turning on the man.
Bones. What was once someone’s hand peeked out from behind a desk. No doubt if Steve went back there, he’d find the rest of the skeleton of some Hydra soldier who had been on board when this thing had crashed. Steve might just be sitting in a whole room full of the remnants of people who had met the same end as him but weren’t so fortunate to have been preserved in ice.
“Dinner with hammer is dinner with Hammer, no matter how far off it is,” Tony wailed.
“My suit caught me,” Tony shrugged. “I landed safely and then… and then I had a talk with some mad scientist or something, real freaky guy. What happened to
“Steve Rogers,” he told him with a hesitant smile. “Sorry about the blood and thanks for saving my ass. I seriously owe you one, …?”
Rogers’s eyes fluttered open. When he caught sight of Tony, he jerked away in terror.
An earsplitting bang resounded through the ship, and a searing gash bloomed on Steve’s side.
He felt the bones in his hands shatter, but he kept pounding the glass. It would break, it had to. He wouldn’t drown again, he couldn’t. The water closed around his neck, and Steve kept punching. His muscles were starting to seize, he was freezing. He thought of his shield, which would have no trouble breaking him out.
“Hey there,” Stark replied with an easy grin.
There was no response but the whirring of machines.
As pretty as the hallucination of his hero was, Tony knew he had to get himself out of this mess alone. But, he had nothing but his tiring arms, a tiny flame running on fumes, and a cliff.
Oh. Oh no. If the way his heart melted from nothing but a smile was any indication, he was fucked. Get a grip, Rogers, you’ve got a mission to get to.
“I knew he was famous for that ironman suit, but I had no idea he got this much publicity,” Steve said, frowning at the rude snapshots.
“This mission’s been a nightmare,” Rogers muttered, getting to his feet only for his knees to buckle. On instinct, Tony caught him by his arm, but Rogers shoved him off.
There was static for a bit before Brandt responded somewhat irritably, “Franz Brandt, grandson of Hubert Brandt, who you killed in the war.”
“Yeah? What’d I do this time?” he asked, bemused.
What the hell was happening to him? Where the hell was he? Why the hell was he here?
Someone was yelling. They sounded… scared. Maybe it was Tony yelling. He sure was fucking scared. It was volley after volley of punches to block, and Tony’s reflexes were slowing. His only upperhand was the gadget he was clutching, which spewed a small but menacing white flame that made the guards keep some distance. But it wasn’t enough, they’d pushed him to the edge of a very steep, very long drop. Tony had kicked a loose rock into it earlier, and it had been a long while until he heard the sound of it landing echo back up.
Steve pitied the guy. Now that he was no longer dying of hypothermia and properly fed, Steve could see the cruelness in his words to Stark in Greenland. Before the mission had taken a turn, Stark had smiled so easily and laughed so brightly, and every second of it had nearly floored Steve. But then Brandt had gotten him and, true to his word, knew precisely which sore spot would shut Steve down. After the cold had swallowed him whole, lying in that tunnel, Steve couldn’t remember what warmth had ever been. Then he’d started up a shouting match with Stark. He’d watched as hurt had flickered across Stark’s face before hardening into a scowl of the utmost detestation. Steve’s words had done that.
“Oh yeah, you told me about that. Dixon, right? He was trying to show off on a motorcycle to Cho?”
“Uhh, I’m pretty sure it was one by the windows. ‘Cause I remember watching some guy eat the pavement.”
“Rogers, this is Tony Stark. You’ve been alive in this century long enough to have heard about Iron Man. Stark, this is Steve Rogers. Yes, Captain America lives. Broke him out of the ice three months ago, and that’s all you need to know,” Fury rattled off. “You two will be partnering this mission, and I expect your best effort to work as a cohesive unit. Learn each other’s strengths and needs in the field. In briefing room 400, Agent Samson will fill you in on what shit you’ll be taking on today. The world council is convening in ten minutes, and I need to get my ass down there to take their call. So, I do not have the time for any grievances against this pairing or the hour of day I have called you in. You will work together, and you will work together well. Is that understood?”
On the subway ride over, Clint and Romanoff had tag teamed explaining to Steve the mission behind the harddrive they’d retrieved. Steve had originally planned on playing it safe and behaving with the utmost politeness and respectability. But too soon he’d been swept up in the frenzy of their story-telling and bent over with laughter as they reenacted their climactic altercation with a cloaked villain at some warehouse in Florida.
There was a harsh snap as the handle he’d been clinging onto broke off the wall. And then there was air whipping all around him as he entered back into the sickeningly familiar feeling of freefall.
She regarded him coolly for a second before pulling out a cellphone from the pocket of her leather jacket. Even though her eyes were fixed on the messages flicking across the screen in her hand, Steve couldn’t shake the feeling that she was watching him. That was probably his ego messing with him, though, so Steve pushed it out of his mind and tried to settle back into sleep.
“Nah, not one,” Stark told him in a bored voice. “Why?”
Pepper arched an eyebrow. “Is this person an escapee or something?”
“Tell me where Captain America is,” Tony demanded.
Tony didn’t really feel like fighting anymore, not when Rogers faced him down with such earnesty. He slumped forward in defeat because
After slapping a generous tip on the tabletop, Clint led them out of the stuffy heat of the restaurant. They meandered down a few streets until coming to a stop at the crumbling steps of an apartment building. Clint offered Steve his couch for the night, and maybe ten minutes ago Steve would have accepted. But guilt was churning in his head now, and Steve already knew he wouldn’t be getting any sleep. So, he thanked Clint and Romanoff for the fun and set off to board the subway.
Tony wasn’t a complete idiot, at least not at the present moment. If his celebrity status had given him anything, it was practice with seeing through the fronts people put on. So, in the back of his mind, he knew Rogers’s cutting responses were merely the outcome of a volatile mixture of frustration with their failed mission, distortion of his perception by the hypothermia, and defensiveness stemming from his exposed and wounded state. But, the moment Rogers made the comparison to Howard, all rhyme or reason vacated Tony’s head, and a blinding fury took its place. Rogers needed to shut the fuck up, and Tony needed to make that happen as soon as possible.
Luckily, interspersed along the walls, there were enough holds for equipment that Steve could clutch onto, but his hands were slippery with blood from the wound in his side. Also, whatever had blasted the hole in the ship had taken off two of the turbines, too. So, now the whole thing was going down fast.
, Stark,” Rogers snapped, his voice dangerously sharp.
Then he was falling.
“We’re just here to retrieve a harddrive this blockhead- ” Agent Romanoff elbowed Barton again. “ -left in here. It’s got sensitive information stored on it, so it couldn’t wait til morning.”
Pepper leaned against the counter and stated simply, “Meeting with Justin Hammer.”
There was a snap, and then the captain was gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ever since he started spending more time in New York, Stark’s become an object of fascination for the press around here,” Romanoff said, wiggling another slice of pizza loose. “With his past as a crass playboy, they’ve got plenty of ammunition. And, ever since ironman, he’s become more of an enigma. People adore the speculation that brings. They’re all curious about why he isn’t making as many public appearances.”
“Uh hey,” Steve said, turning toward Stark. Way to go, Rogers. Real smooth. Wait no. That was a perfectly acceptable greeting. He wasn’t trying to flirt with the guy. He needed to calm down.
The moment they touched down, Rogers let go, swayed backwards, and fell hard on his ass in the prairie grass. His hair was sticking up in all directions, there was a wild look in his eyes, and his whole body was still so rigid. Tony might have laughed if he wasn’t so dumbfounded at everything that had just gone down in the span of less than ten minutes.
Half submerged in northern Greenland’s tundra, a downed Hydra vessel of enormous size had been uncovered. Apparently its design had been faulty, so it hadn’t made it to its intended destination, America, with its deadly payload. Hydra had sent a unit up there to salvage things, and overtime, a scientific base had been established there, far from the interference of oh, you know, nuisances like Captain America. As the war turned, though, the place was left abandoned. That is, until a new group of unknown allegiance adopted it as some sort of research center. SHIELD had picked up on activity in the area and sent in agents to investigate. They reported back and spoke of shipments of machinery being taken in as well as all signs pointing to intentions to revive whatever weapon Hydra had made considerable effort to transport to the States. After tapping the base’s communication lines, it was revealed that the coveted weapon was radioactive in nature, with the purpose of releasing a massive cloud of radiation that the winds would carry into cities. And, this new group seemed to be making alarmingly fast progress towards bringing about just that for whatever nefarious plans they had. Right now, the why didn’t matter so much as the high number of lives in the balance. Steve and Stark were to get themselves into the crash site and take the place down.
Shaking his head, Steve followed after Ironman and boarded the jet. Maybe Stark was right. It wasn’t really his place to decide. All Steve could do was hope Stark would shake it off by the time they landed.
much blood.”
Earlier that morning, after JARVIS had informed him that the AI had made a breakthrough in their investigations into an underground nazi organization with an obsession with killing innocents in the most gruesome, downright blood-curdling ways, Tony had leapt into his Ironman armor and blasted off to down the creepy fuckers. Normally, Tony wouldn’t ever consider leaving his bed before noon after a long night in the workshop. He also normally wouldn’t really jump to offing people. But, god, would he make an exception for these bastards. The footage he’d uncovered of some of their intimidation tactics of state officials had been plaguing his nightmares for the past month. Plus, it was without a doubt one of the heads of this nazi group that would be on board this ship and no one else, meaning there weren’t going to be any lackeys of debatable devotion caught in the crossfire.
"Yes. Yes a thousand times yes." There's a lot of hugging that follows that.
"Why are you here?" The assassin looks startled at my question.
The adults start doing some sort of comedy duo that I could've sworn they'd done before, taking one line and then another. I have to say, it was quite entertaining to watch.
"I've been trying to work that out for hours. How?" I shrug.
"Thanks Dad."
"Certainly." He replies. "Up the stairs, take a left. Your initials should be painted on the doors."
"Like hell you are." A new voice joins in. Dad. I place my hands on my cheeks and gasp.
"My two handsome boys."
"Am I okay? Shouldn't it be me asking you that? Last night was pretty scary."
"So what do you guys want?" Steve asks looking up from his menu. Me and Pete share a glance of 'wtf' before turning to look at our Papa.
We make our way downstairs and are slightly amused at the scene in front of us; the youngest children sat down at the table, breakfast all over their faces. Other children running around like headless chickens, tidying up and putting up banners and balloons for any potential parents to see. We, the two and only teens in this place, jump down the rest of the stairs and grab a slice of toast each. Conrad comes over to us, rolling her eyes.
"How about we watch a movie?" Nat asks to take my attention away from my absent father. I nod and Clint carries me to the bed, setting me down and climbing in next to me, pulling me into his side. I cuddle up next to him as Nat puts Pitch Perfect into my tv before jumping in next to me. We sit and watch the movie in silence. enjoying each-others company.
My lip starts to shake
"Hey Tiger."
"Ready to go kiddos?" Tony asks. We both grin and nod our heads frantically, grabbing as many boxes as we can, setting off down the stairs. We managed to get it all in the, car? Limousine? What do you even call that?, in two trips so that was fun. Tony complaining the whole way about cardio making me bite back a laugh. We all hop into the, vehicle and Tony starts talking to JARVIS? And this weird voice replies and I'm just like 'Whoa, it's a fucking talking car.' But it was just Tony's AI like Steve later explained to us. Well, I felt stupid.
"I'm sure he'd be proud of who you've become. He'd be proud of both of you." I nod, my head dropping. I might as well play now I've got her out. After managing to balance her on my lap, I reach up to my ear and pull out my ear ring. It was a piece of sharp wire wrapped around a small hole in a plectrum and bent to fit as an ear ring.
"Hey Mogi bear. Where did you get this from?" I ask, holding up the Iron man helmet.
"I'll see you soon, прекрасный." I hug her back and she walks out of the door, closing it behind her. I turn away from it to see Steve standing behind me, his arms crossed against his chest, a small smirk on his face.
"Tyler Quinzel?" I stand up as the receptionist says my name. she smiles as I get closer.
"I like that deal." I say quietly.
I wake disorientated a few hours later. 'Well, this isn't my room.' It's only then the heavy thing laying across me is brought to my attention. 'What the fuck? Okay this is how I'm going to die.' I just about manage to lift my upper body into a slight sitting position to find that it's an arm that is draped across me. Bucky's arm to be exact. Memories from the previous night come rushing back. It was him. He did this. But at the same time, it wasn't him, he had no idea. God I don't know what to make of this. I skilfully slide out of the bed without waking the ex-assassin, going to my own room to take a shower and hopefully forget the events of last night.
I found the car pretty easily, considering she's not changed it since she became my social worker 10 years ago. I don't bother looking both ways as I run across the road, slinging the passenger side door open and sliding in. The brunette rolls her eyes at me.
"Umm. Code Satan's waterfall. Umm, I don't have anything." She puts a finger to my lips.
"I can see that. Hand me the scissors." I so as he says, slightly scared of what he's going to do with them. He says nothing more as he drags me through to his and Papa's room, sitting me down at the humorously large dressing table. He brushes his fingers through my hair again, mumbling incoherent words under his breath.
"Good and I hate to say it but the social have got in touch. You've got to go round to your mom's after school." I groan falling back onto the bed.
“Oh yeah?”
Tony paused, thinking that over, then laughed. “You mean you didn’t figure it out? It was nothing but an illusion, Rogers. They’ve got some projection technology or some shit. None of it was real.”
Whichever SHIELD agent had dropped the drink off while he was sleeping had kindly taken into consideration that Steve might prefer liquid foods until his jaw recovered, but they’d missed the fact that, for the time being, Steve couldn’t use his hands to pick the damn thing up. With a huff, he fell back into the pillows of his hospital bed. The only reason he hadn’t resisted being hustled into Medical was because he couldn’t exactly patch himself up with broken hands. And also because Steve knew he didn’t have anything edible in his apartment, and SHIELD would give him food. So much for that part of the deal, though.
“No, no, no. Cap, come on, stay with me,” Tony said, grabbing the other man’s shoulders and holding him upright. Rogers hissed at the contact, cringing away in pain. “Shit, sorry! I didn’t realize you were hurt there, I promise. But, you gotta try and stay awake, alright?”
