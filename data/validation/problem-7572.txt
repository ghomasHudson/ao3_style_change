Steve eyes rested on his arc reactor again, the constant light was blinding but still beautiful. He rubbed his chin doubting he’d ever fully understand the importance of that piece of tech. Still it fascinated him; the fact that he built it with scrapes in a cave was impressive.
"Alright Mr. Sour Puss you can be like that if you want, it doesn't hurt me one bit." He said with a snob taking another huge gulp as he walked out from behind the counter and plopped himself on the couch. Natasha swirled her martini and sighed, sharing occasional glances with Bruce from where he sat across from her on the other couch the other blushing before looking away in embarrassment. It was quite an entertaining sight since Thor enjoined the squabbles of normal people. He chuckled and took another swig of the fine aged Asgardian whiskey from a jeweled silver flask.
The doctor redirected his gaze back towards the slightly shifted and stained bandages that wrapped the man. He looked almost like a mummy at the waist. He pulled out a small pair of surgical scissors and began cutting the cloth away. "My name is Hector sir."
"I'm going to count to three ok?" Steve informed the other so he could brace himself. Tony clenched his eyes shut and involuntary reached for Bruce's pant leg, grabbing it tightly. The pain was already unbearable. He could barely stand getting his suit cut open with this thing sticking out of him. It's like now that there wasn't any resistance, he was steadily getting worst.
"I figured that much already. He's one of our best lines of defense. Somebody would love to remove the thorn in their side if they were to ever advance with whatever dastardly deed they have in store. So the big question right now is who wants to lower our defenses and weaken us? What is their plan?" Natasha said running her fingers threw her red hair. "Why can't people just give us a brake sometimes? Is saving the planet not enough for these people?" She was beyond frustrated by this point.
He said honestly as he looked the tired man in the eyes. Steve and Bruce only exchanged worried glances as the doctor pulled a couple of sterilized bandages and gaze from the little supply dresser to the side which didn't seem to belong in the nicely furbished room. He wiped away the already drying blood from around the stitches. Steve offered to assist him while he patched his friend up. He was finally able to get a good view of the wound without blood soaked clothing in the way and a rush of adrenaline keeping his mind on the task that was originally at hand.
He could only imagine what that man is going through. To be given his own personal slice of hell. He felt his mind going to a dark place it was time he pulled himself out of it. He set everything back where it belonged, sealing the drawer tight. He slipped out of Tony’s room making his way down the hall towards the stairs. He had to pass by a little common area to get to the stairs and as he passed by there was someone sitting alone.
The thing fascinated Steve although he absolutely had no idea what it was for. It sure was pretty like some kind of special nightlight. He held it up closer spotting the ‘Proof Tony Stark has a Heart’ band loosely attached to the top. Now that he thought about it the thing powering Tony’s suit looked something like this.
They all held a matter of respect for Tony. He was truly a hero and an amazing man who didn't deserve to be put in this situation. Who knows how many times he'd avoided death already. He was going to make it through this.
Naturally she'd been trained to work around the loved ones and she really didn't mind. She didn't want someone to get up when she was the one bothering them. It was a habit after all. She apologized but Steve just smile and thanked her for tending to his friend. She blushed realizing who it was that sat beside Tony Stark. Even so she's had plenty of practice keeping her cool in certain situations like this.
Mere minutes after Steve made it to his room. His hand hesitated on handle as he gathered himself. With a hard exhale he stepped in only to be greeted with the light beeping of machines. The room was dark now the only light being from the moon or the blue of his arc reactor. He remembered what he’d read about it. He was curious to see how he manages with that bulky thing imbedded in his chest.
Our last means of hope were sent from the government which originally was meant to obliterate us all and our home. With quick thinking I threw it right where it needed to be. Up at the mother ship and hoped for the best.
He likes to believe he's making a difference in the world, when in fact he completely ignore the fact that he was the one that helped make it that way in the first place. I suppose that's why he contributes to self poisoning with every dose of alcohol. It helps dull the guilt that lingers within him.
Bruce followed behind them and pressed the bottom that would take them to the lobby floor, the doors automatically closing after them. He stayed by their side and tended to the one in the other's arms. Steve leaned up against the metallic wall of the elevator and patently waited as the floor passed slowly. Tony was slowly fading and he could tell he was starting to fight just to stay conscious. Fresh blood continued to flow from the wound and leaving a trail wherever it fell. Even though he bound him to the best of his abilities before they left, it continued to seep through. Bruce held his hand down on the makeshift bandages to cover it. Both their hands as well as their clothes were stained red. It looked like they just murdered somebody, but there was the regret and sadness on their faces to show otherwise.
So in the end he avoided every question that bombarded him about what happened then as well as the anything more indebted about his condition other than the fact the arc reactor was keeping shrapnel from ripping his heart into shreds. He told the press all he wanted them to know when he got back and then sealed himself away letting that be the end of it. He never seemed to be the selfless type but since a few days ago when and alien armada came through the sky above the tower he did what nobody else expected. He took it upon himself to be the one to take a horrible situation and turn it in their favor.
I was never cut out to be the hero. Someone who spends the majority of his life manufacturing articles of war doesn't deserve to be speculated. Subconsciously creating the tools for the other guys to attack us with, killing innocence. I will never stand for that kind of disbelief ever again. So long as my body draws breathe it will never happen again.
He vaguely remembered it after a moment he produced another bottle. Tony visibly perked up. “How many” Steve asked casually. “Just one” it would be just enough to take the edge off, clear his mind. Maybe he could get some rest before Pepper came in a few hours.
The commotion woke Bruce up whom in turned nearly flipped out of his chair. He scrambled to collect himself before he realized what was going on. He rushed over to where he saw Steve leaning over the bed and witnessed Tony struggling in agonizing. His hand gripped the bed in attempts at drawing the feeling away but to no prevail. "I don't know what all is going on but I'm going to call for doctor so he can give you something to knock out the pain." Bruce quickly mentioned already halfway out the door.
His eye lids weighed heavily along with dark circles but he refused to let them fall, however exhausted he may be. He was not looking forward to hellish slumber. "Umm uh Tony? Are you feeling alright? I mean other than you know hole in your side. You know despite my age I tend to pick up things rather quickly. So why is it you don't want to go back to sleep?"
After working with someone for so long you begin to learn more about them than they probably know about themselves. You start to pick up their habits; way of doing things, the way they talk or act how they are under pressure or in a different environment, even the way they smell is imprinted in your own mind. They were best friends; they looked out for each other no matter what happened. It'd be pretty sad if they didn't fully know each other after years of working together. Especially given their skill set.
Complying with his orders one of the nurses held Tony's arm down across his body rolling him onto his right side. He seethed although there was nothing he could do to stop it.
He lifted his head as the sound of a door shutting. Ultimately realizing that Bruce was already headed up the stairs and he was left alone. It was quiet and dark the last thing he wanted was to be left alone with his thoughts. He grabbed the handle and pulled the door that led to the stairs open. He paused for a moment and glanced back before walked in. A streetlight that stood out in front of the building cast a dull yellow light through the numerous windows. It reflected off of the dark liquid sprawled out on the floor. Somehow it made the dark gloomy room looked almost beautiful in a way. Kind of like a painting that had no title.
His answer relieved more than just Steve, the driver seemed to be holding his breath ever since laying eyes on the Hulk and seemed to gasp for more as he turned the corner. Banner's words seemed to reassure both of them for the time being, his duller eyes being the proof of that. It wouldn't take much longer before they got back.
"What's the deal with him" she said, allowing herself to let out a small chuckle. "He tired because he ran up a few flights of stairs. It's ok though he was falling asleep in the waiting room anyway. It's probably a good idea we follow his and Clint's example and hit the hay." Steve stood up, stretching out his muscles in his arms before maneuvering around the coffee table. He was about to walk past Natasha but she held out her arm and caught him before he could get past her. He stopped and looked down at her with a puzzled look.
"Thank God, I'll have to admit you had me going there. That look you had on your face was kind of like if you saw a ghost or something, had me a little worried." Natasha admitted as she linked her hands behind her head. You could see the reassurance wash over her face when Steve finished talking. Who knew they'd all care for Tony as much as they did, of all people it was the greedy Iron man they were worried about. I guess when you've spent as much time around him as they did you kind of get the feeling something's missing without him around. The atmosphere around them felt off.
"Let's take the stairs Steve," Bruce said already walking in that direction. Steve finally let his hand drop back down to his side and followed the other without uttering a word. Everything happened so fast it was like none of it was actually real. That there wasn't blood spread out in every direction behind them. That one of their friends was fighting for his life even when he gave them the impression that he was perfectly fine.
What came out was an even more distorted version of the once known man of iron, now riddled with a PTSD that no one on the Earth could even begin to fathom. The curse of a never ending nightmare that is constantly haunting his sleeping form and slowly working to destroy his waking one with anything he can, alcohol being his main poison. Tony's face slowly became stern and troubled at the thought of it all. It was too much even for someone as ingenious as him to handle.
Even if that's so, I can't stand to see Pepper cry. She's always been there for me. I can't just up and leave her alone. It would be selfish of me. Then again, I was well known for being a self centered egotistic jerk. So maybe it wouldn't be so bad, if I died?
Steve traced the blood back to its source, the elevator. It was smeared up against the metal door and coated the floor in front of it. He looked down at his hand once he noticed the bloody print that suck out from between the seam. It was his. At the time he'd been in such a hurry that being neat wasn't much of a priority at the time. He followed the trail, which seem to make time rewind. He could paint a mental picture in his head like he was watching himself disparately rush out the small space.
He made a promise to himself and Yinsen that that would never happen ever again. So long as there was breathe in his body not another weapon manufactured under his name will be used in the name of false justice. He was better than that after all, he was better than his father who built an inexhaustible addition to modern war from the ground up. He could use his mind for the greater good, something over violence. The Iron man was an exception, just a tool to help clean up the mess he made.
Only surprising the others to see nothing but a flurry of red liquid expel from his mouth. Tony followed with a sinking feeling to mend with the floor. He slowly lifted his head up paled and beaded in sweat. He drifted back but was caught by Bruce and Steve before he could hit the hard surface. They laid him down on the floor.
"No offense Thor but your kid brothers got a few kogs missing from his machinery up stairs and the only go I believe in wouldn't be a battle crazed race of barbarians, again no offense Thor." Steve quickly retaliated, not meaning to insult the man but rather to speak him mind. Which he'd always did.
"I believe I can answer that. But isn't it pretty obvious Nat? I mean look." Clint pointed at the scraps of Tony's suit which remained dismantled and scattered into pieces on the floor, drenched in blood. He walked over and picked up half of the split apart breast plate. The sharp of Vibranium left a huge gaping hole through the middle of it. If the suit had been just a little thinner the spike could have easily tunneled straight threw to the other side.
Steve looked at the scientist confusion plaguing his facial features. "Bruce.. There's no sensing in beating yourself up over this, none of this is your fault or anybody else's for that matter. Only that bastard who sent the missile is to blame. I feel like shit too but the bright side is that even if Tony got hit and is lying in a hospital bed as bad as he looks right now we can say he's alive and still willing to fight. So I say why shouldn't we? He stopped that missile and maybe it was intended for him but regardless he stopped it before it hit us. It sucks I know but there's not much we can do at the moment but pray."
"It's not always about being right. Besides no one could of guessed that something like this would be inside that thing. I watched you the whole time and you did everything right. We just should have taken the situation a lot more seriously even if we knew how to handle it. But you're not the one to blame." In a way he knew something like this would happened but he could have never of expected this.
"What's her problem?" Tony said a little too loudly. He was always a loud drunk, subconsciously wanting to be the life of the party. In some cases he was but with this lot it seems like no one really wanted to celebrate at the moment. It was a bummer but I guess for some reason there were always things that need to be done, unfinished business as you will. Post battle contemplation just a bunch of stuff. As well as things he just couldn't understand.
"Where..?" His voice was harsh and scratchy and he tried to contain the cough lurking within his throat. But to no prevail, he hacked what seemed like his other good lung in a fit. His entire body pulsed in agony. The flexing core as he coughed only made it feel like he getting stabbed a thousand times over. He managed to cover his face with his palm before he unable to so. He felt something wet seep into his skin.
In an instant it exploded into a stunning display of smoke and fiery red inferno that seemed to burn as hot as the pits of Hell itself. He liked to wait until the very last second for dramatic effect, that and the explosion would be spectacular. It indeed was but the light it brought with it momentarily blinded him and as a reaction he squeezed his eyelids shut and instinctively threw his arm up to shield his eyes. Light sensitivity was a natural symptom of being for lack of a better word shit faced.
"Oh I got an idea. How about you and your fancy arrows fly right up there and detonate the missile yourself without blowing your body apart. Or I have an even better idea I could throw you over there and you can magically ride it into oblivion utterly saving us all." Tony said not even giving the man the satisfaction of looking into his eyes as he retorted. He just continued to suit up. After all he was the best drunk and better with sarcasm.
When he returned, it was originally to retrieve his mettlesome brother and nothing else, but his mission took an unexpected turn. Loki managed things that even he didn't think possible or quite understand. None the less he had his eyes set on Earth for some reason. He wished he knew what was going on with him during the time of his absence. That would be one of his questions he'd ask him in his cell once all this business is cleared up. If anything good happened out of that mess, it'd be the fact that he'd actually managed to make quite a few friends.
It wasn't like he could push him away, not like he wanted to in the first place, but he was in no shape to be in this position. He felt the only thing he could really do in this situation was wrap his arms back around him and support him the best he could. He felt so fragile underneath his strong arms. Almost like if he squeezed be little too hard he'd shatter underneath him. There was no way of knowing what was going on in that eccentric mind of his, why he would push himself this far when he couldn't even sit up a moment ago. Tony was a mystery to him why he does the things he does didn't add up but it seemed to work for him in a way. But this was out of character, well as far as he could see. From the tabloids and the file he read up on the younger Stark he wasn't much of the gushy type.
"At the hospital, though you probably don't remember much. I mean you were pretty messed up when everything went down." Steve replied answering his clearly oblivious question. Tony's mind was groggy and his head was throbbing but he wasn't totally clueless, he remembered mostly everything. Well until he passed out that was when everything faded to black. He rolled his head and looked over to the blond to his side.
He moaned the image of the car battery wired through a hole in his chest weighing heavily on his subconscious. Absent mindedly he clenched his stitches making the feeling more intense without realizing it. Steve quickly noticed this and how tense Tony became. The heart monitor sped up as did his breathing. He scooped up his hand using his other to pry Tony's arm from his wound. Pained tears escaped their lidded barrier running down Tony’s pale cheek soaking into his shirt collar.
It wasn’t that long ago. Other clippings were attached it, Obadiah Stain former Stark industries representative conspiring and selling weapons to the same terrorist group. His attempted murder of Mr. Stark in order to seize assets still Iron man managed to put a stop to it. All of this was compiled neatly in his bedside table. It was a never ending nightmare wrapped up in a bundle.
"Monitor his systems and keep a close eye on him. Make sure his temperature doesn't spike." The doctor said as he exchanged the near empty blood bag and saline solution with a fresh ones. Most of the people crowding the room dissipated as the situation deescalated. With his patient in stable condition he brought over some water in a cup with a straw, given the look of Tony's chapped lips he could tell the poor man was parched. It was greatly appreciated as he nearly emptied the cup, the doctor leaving him with a fresh one before stepping out himself.
They cut away the temporary bandage that had been completely soaked threw by now. Once it was removed little streams worked their way down his side, meeting the surface of the operating table. One of the nurses wipe the area around with a cloth dampened with disinfectant. The main surgeon came over to assess the damage so far, his other colleagues swarming around behind him placing all sorts of instruments around his station. He picked out a blunt hook and stuck it in the gash to get a better look inside; he tenderly pulled some of the torn flesh to the side and used a little flash light to get a better idea of the condition of his internal organs that were exposed.
The duo arrived at the tower around 1:40 in the morning. It seemed like since they'd been gone it had been abandoned altogether. The only thing that still showed signs of life was the bright light coming from the top floor window. They knew the others were still waiting for them probably expecting the worse since they have yet to get a call or a word for that matter about anything. It left them to once their wits and imagination; some would over power the other one.
Bruce chuckled somehow feeling a little better than he did. Probably because he had hardy known any of these people for more than a week and they were comfortable around him. He never thought that there would be anybody who would accept him, being a freak and all. He liked the feeling of acceptance. It had been so long since he felt like he actually had a purpose. Or even at home, like he had friends that were more like a family to him. That cared. "Thanks guys. I needed that."
"What's with the formality? No one else's here but us, so just call me Tony. After all we're just two people living and breathing side by side on this planet of ours." He said barley threw his teeth as he looked up at the nearly blacked out ceiling. Only a single part of it was lit thanks to the small lap to his side.
He'd become accustom to the worst case scenario after enduring it for so very long. He'd lost so much in the 70 years he was frozen. He couldn't save his friend just like he couldn't save every individual during the war. Still he was praised and admired as a hero. He didn't feel any different and nowhere near the sort. In the end everything a cared about disappeared in what seemed like an instant.
Steve narrowed an eyebrow and shot a confused glance at his companion. "What are you talking about?" He said as he shoved his hands in his pockets and continued to walk, urging the other man to explain himself. "I'm talking about what Tony said before passing back out. He said I can't. Like what is that supposed to mean?"
He ignored the sting of his side as they cleaned the incision, he was afraid what it looked like and he didn't even want to know. By the feel of it he knew it wasn't pretty. It would make for a long recovery. The man examining him noticed the binding was pulled from his earlier ordeal and needed to be fixed. Tony wasn't happy about that; luckily he had enough painkillers in his system to ignore the threading of the needle to his bruised flesh.
"Tony, none of its real it’s OK. But your stress level is rising too high, you’ve gotta calm down.." Steve stood fast shoving his seat back as he stepped up close to Tony. Keeping a firm grip on his wrist he squeezed his shoulder, shaking him lightly. He was too afraid of hurting him anymore.
But she was actually happy here. That mission to collect the big guy and rally up a team of misfits was the best thing she could of done. Spending most her time as a solo miracle informant was what she thought was her expertise. Who knew she'd work so well with a team of untrained, unqualified, undignified bunch of outsider. But in introspect she has glad things turned out the way they did.
Tony had access to the best doctors in Manhattan. Some of which were the most qualified in the US. Ever since his incident in Afghanistan he didn't like to take any chances, even if he hated going to the doctor it was just one of those things. He couldn't just ignore the shrapnel in his chest forever, one day maybe soon he'd have to get it removed, as much as he didn't want to. The arc reactor after all was just a temporary solution and he knew one time or another something would have to be done about it.
It didn't take long before the cab driver realized just exactly who the other was in the car with him. It was that once gigantic green rage monster of a man sitting in the back of his cab. In a way he was even more honored but more so terrified than anything else. He put his car in gear and they went on their way near pushing the speed limit.
"But Mr. Stark, This will make the pain easier. You need to rest. I promise you'll feel like a million bucks when you wake up." He insisted but not moving from his spot; waiting for a signal of some kind to reassure him he understood.
"Where do I begin, we rushed to the hospital and he went into surgery I couldn't really tell you what happened in the ER but when the doctor came out he said it was close but he was going to make it. After a while they let us go in and see him, he was a little pale but for the most part he was still fighting." Steve withheld telling them about the fact that he forced himself right after being stitched back together or the fact that side looked worse than bruised fruit. The important thing they needed to know was that he was alive.
Tony was in and out of surgery quite fast even though it was a 5 and a half hour operation. For the people working on him it seemed as those they didn't have enough time. But for the two waiting outside as well as the one waiting at the tower, time moved even slower than it should have. They were just glad that they'd gotten him help in time. He could have bled out all over his comrades and the floor of his facility or drowned in a lung full of blood in the arms of his friend while the others watched. Nothing they could possibly do about it. It'd be best to forget all of that happening and look toward the future.
"Tony's suit is made of the strongest combination of metallic substances on Earth other than Vibranium. And that one shard cut threw like it was nothing but a piece of card stock. They knew that he would be the one to take care of the missile; he's done so many countless other times. They even calculated the force needed to drive a stake threw him. He was a threat and it would be in their best intentions to get rid of him." Clint said as he crossed his arms together and plopped on the couch. It pained him to admit it but they were in trouble without Tony, after all without him there would have been no way they would have lasted as long as they did against those aliens. At that moment Thor walked in threw the outer doors, drawing no attention to him from the others who were obliviously troubled.
He wasn't so used to being accepted the way he was here or having people who actually understand where he was coming from. Everyone was here for a reason; they all had their own experiences that set them apart. So it was nice to have a place where he could actually fit in. Now that his consciousness was somewhat clearer than it had been he was able to feel that he actual held a place in this world.
"Bruce.. If you keep calm.. I'll let you.. Tinker with some of my... New toys in the lab.." Tony said panting through gritting teeth. With every word a small amount of blood would bypass the enamel barricade and trickle down in the crease of his parted lips as he managed a weak smile.
"Well aren't you going to ask for my name?" He suddenly said breaking the silence. The other look slightly confused, like it was a question that really didn't need to be asked. Everyone knew who Tony Stark was. It would have been asinine if he hadn't.
In the end you live your life only the memories remained of your past, which is getting harder to hold onto and even harder to let go. He didn't want Tony to end up as another blood stain on his memory.
Although every now and again I'll reach a resolve and make it back to the Earth. No recollection, seeming as though it were merely a skip in time. Just with a bang and I'm faced down in the ruble, such a pitiful state for the so called genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. All titles to mask the broken man who carries them. In reality I'm the most fragile one that hides beneath a layer of overconfidence, locked away inside of a shell of metal. Weak.
Blood falling in large quantities by then, the prints made by feet scuffing around him. Trailing the red in all directions, if he didn't know any better he would have thought he was staring back at a crime scene. Like some sick bastard gutted his victim and attempted to paint a picture with the precious copper liquid that sustained life.
"Hey lighten up a bit Bruce I'm messing with you. Is it so wrong to live a little? After all the crazy things that went on yesterday it's nice just to have a little time to relax you know? And I promise you I won't drink myself to a new liver. That is if it makes you feel any better." He finished his sentence by placing a fresh paper umbrella in a new colorful drink.
Clint placed a heavy hand on her shoulder but her gaze never faltered; not until he flipped on the lights making the inside instantly brighter. The sudden change stung their eyes slightly but Natasha didn't mind it, she just continued to lather her palms and wrists with soap. Once all the color had seemed to run down the drain she dried them with a clean white dish towel. She looked up at Clint and flashed a smile before setting the towel down and letting out a breath she seemed to of held the entire time.
The wound pulsed along to his heart beat. He flexed against it as the feeling shot across his abdomen like wild fire, too intense for him to bear. He bit his tongue stifling his cries. His mind was clouded and he could feel himself on the verge of passing out again. Then suddenly he was swarmed by numerous doctors who only upset his confusion.
It was eerily silent which in itself made it uncomfortable to enter. It felt like there was a weight that hung in the air above them, something near ghostly that held their soul in its grasp. They shifted the uneasiness along with the open doors. The team was the only ones occupying the tower today. Tony being a generous boss gave his staff a celebratory day off, which in turn became more of a week but it didn't really matter. The tower was pretty much under reconstruction as well as repurposing.
"What's your name?" He let out slowly as he was being examined yet again. This man looked up in surprise at the sudden interest in him of all things. Doctors in some instances were meant to be seen and not heard. That is unless when delivering bad news to patents or loved ones. Considering Tony had never liked going from his early checkups he really hated to be in this position. Mostly the bed ridden thing, but he could tell there was an awkward conversation just waiting to be stirred up.
Several coffee rings stained the nightstand. There was a small unlabeled bottle of copper liquid beside the bed. Steve picked it up uncapping it and instantly he could smell the pungent aroma of top shelf whiskey. Hell of a way to wake up or go to sleep. Then he noticed the various orange bottles tucked around the lamp. Curiosity is quick to take control as he reaches for them. He recognizes some as Valium, Prozac, Celexa and others he wasn’t sure about, he tossed them in the bag maybe he’d need him.
He acknowledged his request and set the needle down on the side table, trying to comfort the other best he knew how. He took his shoulder and he could tell he was shaking. Whatever he was dreaming about surely disturbed him. There's no telling what goes on in the genius head of his.
He even had a partial kitchen in there, the man could spend days locked away in here if he wanted to. Steve shrugged as he found Tony’s dresser, quickly snagging a few concert tees a pair of sweat pants, some socks, and shorts unsure what he would want to wear even if he could change. He thought of anything else he could bring for him when he noticed his bed towards the back. Perhaps there was something over there that he could bring him to better his stay.
He only looked back and decided to let it slide replacing his remark with a sly smile. Bruce watched the two and sighed out of relief. He was glad all was well, after all that heated conflict. But for some reason he still couldn't shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen.
Bruce kept applying steady pressure to the wound the entire ride down. Tony looking worse and worse every second, ghostly and hardly able to hold his eyes open. After several minutes they finally reached the base floor. They were met with the paramedics who seemed to be scrambling to the elevator door with the stretcher in hand. They were shocked to be met with a bloody Captain America and an even bloodier Tony Stark. They had known them as their saviors, but now one of them was in need of saving. They loaded up in the ambulance fast as humanly possible.
The thought of his friends came flooding into his half asleep mind. 'I wonder if they'll show up in the morning. Hell they're probably glad to get me out of their hair for the night, if not longer.' He couldn't help but be pessimistic, it was in his nature. "I guess I'll just have to wait and see what tomorrow will bring. Well technically speaking today but whatever."
Bruce didn't say a single word the entire car ride. The driver even more quiet, which he didn't think was possible. The man must have been in his mid-forty's. He had a thick mustache and glasses as well as the stern expression he held. It there was a text book definition for led foot then this would have been the perfect example. This man wasted no time getting where he needed to be, that was good. Bruce watched the road mostly, having occasional spasms as if to be hitting the imaginary brake on the passenger's side. Especially when it came time to run the red lights, that was the scariest part mainly because the traffic in New York was already terrible.
Steve nodded surprised she hasn’t reported the situation yet, although he wouldn’t be surprised if he already knew. Fury was able to dig up anything; his eyes were everywhere even if he only had one. He didn’t know how he felt about that organization, he didn’t trust it. He wished he didn’t have to be involved with them but it couldn’t be helped. Either way he didn’t want to deal with it anymore especially when he had somewhere to be. He waved goodbye to the spy and disappeared down the stairs.
The two exited the hospital looking as though they'd witnessed an execution and resurrection all in the same day. There was a mix of emotion, ranging from anger and relief to a grim sense. Steve seemed to have a permanent scowl fixated on his face ever since they'd left Tony in his room. It was unlike his usual physique, he had always kept up the sense of professionalism and above all leadership. Someone has crossed a line that should never to be trampled and there was a storm coming.
It'd been a long stressing day for all of them, which was ironic since today was initially meant to be a day of relaxation, giving them a chance to unwind a little. Everything was normal without any worries, everyone was just starting to get to know one another and yet someone had to go and crash the party.
"We'll be there in less than two minutes. The best doctors in the nation practice there. He's in good hands." He wished he good say something definite but he didn't even know what Tony Starks condition was. The world would be a grim place without him that was for certain. Not just because he was a celebrity or one of the biggest philanthropist, but because he was a hero. Although no one could ever see that an egotistic billionaire could be that kind of person, he was one in a million. A big self conceded but a treasure in the twisted world.
No answer. I'm not surprised. I'm in trouble aren't I? Nothing other than utter silence rings in my ear other than the sound of my shallow yet steadily growing breaths.
"What was that thing?" Steve knew what he was implying. There weren't many things Tony's suits were vulnerable to. Things like this didn’t happen by coincidence. He knew well enough someone had planted it.
The sirens went off along with flashing lights as they sped off. Tony's body had calmed so much after receiving the initial shot. One of the paramedics held the mask on his face while the unraveled the makeshift bandage and cut off one of Tony's favorite but now ruined shirts. Steve watched them work for a second then looked back over to Tony. It wasn't a surprise to see the other staring back at him. Hopefully his nerves had calmed quite a deal since being skewered. He managed a weak smile as his chestnut eyes looked back into Steve's bright blue ones. He smiled back even bigger than he anticipated, not regretting a single uplifted facial muscle.
Thor waited on the roof of the tower just in case there were anymore threats, that he would be ready. He figured it'd be their best chance in case there was another attack. It wasn't like he didn't trust Jarvis or the any of the other modernized technology, it's just he trusted his eyes and ears over machines. Nothing can beat his battle instincts nor his hammer and lighting. He could out due any sort of bomb or missile any mortal would dare throw at him. An Asgardians senses were far more advanced than that of Earthlings.
He’d seen the horrors of war, whole limbs blown off among the absolute worse of human cruelty. He would find it hard to get that sickening image out of his head. He could only imagine how he felt. The only thing he could do was keep him from bleeding out and to a doctor. Tony seemed so weak and fragile when they left him. Howard would be sad to see his only son in such condition; to be in excruciating pain fighting for his life. He'd probably scolded me for letting this happen. Hell he felt he needed to kick his own ass.
Steve was quiet. He remembered the meds he’d brought also. “Would any of these help?” He said before holding up one of the small orange bottles.
He wasn't all that bad, he's really has improved since he went off the grid not that long ago, him being the only one who truly knew what happened while in Afghanistan. There's no telling what kind of horrors he endured out there. That thing in his chest was a mystery in itself. He never really liked to talk about that either, anytime he was asked about it he would trail off into some kind of overly complicated technical lingo that even Natasha couldn't keep from boring her.
The look on his face was soft and sincere, his eyes however displayed worry. As well as the light bags that developed underneath them. He had never seen him like this. In a way he looked as bad as he did. The way you carry yourself can tell a lot about your experience. He looked worn, so sincere and worried. Other people would take that as a weakness, showing emotion was always considered being soft. At least that's the way his father always looked at it. He would have been disappointed in the super soldier.
That was the cherry on the top of his snooping and he knew it was time to wrap it up. He careful placed everything back in its place keeping an eye out for anything else he could grab. He noticed a picture of Pepper sitting on his nightstand, ‘Happy birthday boss.’ He picked it up; Tony probably needed to see her smiling face.
The only thing he could distinguish throughout the ordeal was those blue marble like eyes staring him down every step of the way daring him to fall asleep. He refused which in turn astonished the super soldier. After all he'd known people whom been hardened by war unable to do what he did, so calm. He'd seen countless others fall the same way Tony almost did.
His head spun and the world around him slowed. His pupils dilated as his pulse calmed, lulled by the chemicals coursing through his veins. He was facing the window and he could make out a familiar tuff of blond behind the men in scrubs. He blinked slowly seeing the worry in the other's eyes before he shifted his sight to a blank space. He concentrated only on breathing.
He clenched his fist out of anger and twirled his prized Mjolnir taking off into the air and landing on the graveled roof. He walked over and leaded up against one of the large triangle shaped antennas considering that was the only other thing up there and watched the sky. The sunset from Earth sure was beautiful he thought, setting with hammer down next to him and bring with knees up to his chest. He was born and raised on what was considered one of the most beautiful places in the universe but there was something about the simplicity of Earth that lulled him.
"I’ve been in this situation before. I can handle this myself." If glances could materialize daggers Tony’s would be slicing towards Steve. They were red and swollen from the strain. He didn’t want to come across angry but he couldn’t help it. The growing fatigue and fever made him easily aggravated and Steve just so happened to be the subject to receive this treatment. He didn’t seem to mind.
Something bright caught his eye it peaked his interest. He carefully shifted around some other photos noticing it lit up the back of the drawer whatever it was. He carefully reached inside and pulled out Tony’s first chest arc reactor. After the Obadiah incident he kept it close, after all damn thing save his life twice.
He used to think of it as a barren place with little means and inhabited with weaklings. But ever since his first visit in which he originally protested to, he has grown to love it. He has also grown to love another as well as the thought of peace over the violence he'd always thought necessary to achieve his goals. Although from what Loki has shown him in the past few days it can't always be that simple.
"Everything went alright, we were able to patch him up and keep his vitals stable. Right now some of my colleagues are running a few tests but I assure you he's in good hands. You should be able to see him shortly but it will only be for a few moments. He desperately needs rest and he probably won't be awake by then." A huge weight was lifted from their shoulders. Steve could felt he could finally relax; his knees hit the ground after being on his feet for hours. It wasn't like he was tired or anything like that, it's just he want to let relief fully wash over him. "Thank you." He said finally as he looked the man in the eye and smiled.
Steve looked near shattered they'd waited so long that they didn't what had happened. He let out a timid "yes" and moved to the side allowing the man to walk in. He was nervous and in between whether or not he wanted to know what happened or not, but he had to know the suspense was killing him. "What's the news doctor?" Bruce said from behind Steve, the time was beginning to take a toll on him but he was very much aware. Especially since Steve had paced back and forth for a whole 5 hours.
"Hey!"
"If that makes you feel better, I thought you could use some company." Steve said as he pulled up his chair close to Tony and sat down interlocking his fingers.
Hector collected the used cloth and set everything back in pristine condition for when he left. "So when I looked you over it seems like you popped a few of your stitches. For now I put a bridging tape on that area to keep it held together. If you can promise me that you'll stay in that bed from now on I won't call the staple guy in here until the morning. Save you a little extra discomfort.
They loaded up the stretcher in the back of the ambulance. Steve along with the other two paramedics climbed in and closed the doors. With a total of 3 people in the back of the small vehicle there was no room for Bruce. One of the paramedics suggesting it would have been okay if he wanted to ride up front with the driver. With no other choice other than huffing it behind them, he figured it wouldn't have been much of a big deal. He just didn't care for interaction with other people. He didn't have anything against them he's just never been much a fan of interacting with strangers in small places that's all. He took a deep shallow and opened the door, hopped into the passenger's seat. The driver had no idea just exacted who was sitting to his right. He paid little to no attention to him which relived Bruce.
He thumbed his shield before pushing the image to the back of his head. He turned on his heel and headed for the hallway, dimming the lights on his way out. The tower has never been this silent, whether it was Thor carrying on with some story from another world or Jarvis giving constant updates on a certain project. Even when Bruce and Tony go into a heated argument over some kind of scientific mumbo jumbo he did quite understand. Any sort of noise felt more comforting than bitter silence.
Even though he would never admit it, the jealous prince taught him something very valuable about himself. That selfishness can be the cause for such a disaster. Although Tony was notorious for being a self centered rich boy he had managed to disband most of his foolhardy habits through team work.
“I’ll speak with shield in the morning to see what we could do about the attacker; trace the location where the missile came from.”
"Yea I'm ok now. It's just now and then I get so overwhelmed with what I am and this is a totally different environment. It's just so weird that you guys don't resent me for what I can become. Over the years it's caused me nothing but pain and suffering to me and others. I hated myself for a long time now. I've found myself with nothing to look forward too, nothing to live for. I've gone on like that for such a long time so I started helping people those that didn't have the means to help themselves. I'm just not used to all this you know? Everything happened so fast."
I can feel a sharp pain. It's overwhelming I can't stand it, and in my subconscious no less. Something is very wrong and I don't know why. I can feel myself wriggling with discomfort. It's so bad it forces me to wake up and deal with the issue firsthand.
In hindsight he probably should have been the one to deal with the threat the first time rather than Stark. But it couldn't be helped; he figured since he was able to deal with one of greater magnitude only a few days earlier, that the next one would barley be of concern. It was a bold and stupid move he thought; after all he could tell the iron man was not in his right mind. Mortals didn't have as much tolerance in comparison to Asgardians.
The events that led to the attack on the city of Manhattan left major parts of New York in ruins. A hole had opened up in the sky and let loose an armada of aliens. Led by none other than the envious, power hungry demigod with a personality complex to boot; Loki. After stealing the tesseract from Shield's base of operations he hijacked some of the best minds their headquarters had to offer. Then he set his plan into action, with the use of Professor Erik and his knowledge of dimensional plains he was able to construct a portal in which then later was able to release the creatures later known as the Chitauri.
Steve smiled when he finished speaking. His words truly came from the bottom of his heart and even though the people he once knew were either dead or senile he felt as though he had a purpose. As well as people who cared about him. Bruce looked sincerely towards the other who was almost moved to tears. Whether it was because of being where he was now in time or rather the people he'd never be able to see again.
The surgery would be time consuming to say the least. Since the shard hit him with such force, making it able to pierce his armor as well as bend it inward. It tore right threw his left side; it missed his stomach and angled its way up into his chest cavity. The area around the wound was slowly bruising and turning into a dark sickly purple. Sadly the aid of his arc reactor in his chest the magnetism assisted in drawing the metal fragment further and further into his lung and closer to his heart at the same time.
"What's wrong Bruce?" Steve asked. "You look a little out of it."
The slow ride down the numerous amounts of floors felt like it was killing them more than the one in critical condition. He watched his chest slowly rise and fall to pass the time and ease the tension in his body. The anxious feeling he had was torturous, he could stand it. There was a hard lump in him throat he wasn't able to swallow. The choking feeling of not knowing what might happen. Not knowing how this would play out. He could only reassure himself that the other was still holding on. He was still breathing. The light in his chest showed that, no matter how much cloth covered it, the light continued to shine. He always meant to ask him what it was for or where it came from but he had a funny feeling it would be total awkward, so he avoided bringing it up.
The three started walking towards the opened glass panels. They prepped themselves for the rest their celebration especially now that the minor disruption had been dealt with. Tony already making darting glances towards the bar, some could say those were signs of an alcoholic, although Tony liked to think of it as more of a prideful luxury. He'd always been accustomed to drinking but when you're one of the riches people in the world. With an inexhaustible amount of money you tend to pick up habits. He felt different though, a sick feeling down in the pit of his stomach.
"Thank you Steve.." The blond blushed slightly under the others arms not expecting those words to ever leave Tony's lips. He smiled under his warmth although he was pretty sure it was a growing fever. He ran a steady hand down his side, feeling the roughness of the bandages under his fingertips. He frowned at the thickness of the cloth, motioning over the wound light caressing it and felt something wet. 'I hope his wounds didn't reopen because of his stubbornness.' He thought to himself. "How are you feeling Tony?" The other asked quietly knowing he had his full weight on him by this point.
Steve slid the oversized cutters underneath the thick metal and started to cut with unhindered concentration, it being as gentle as if he'd done this sort of thing on a regular basis. He knew just one quick move would be hell on Tony. It was funny to think after all his years he'd never had to cut a man of a body suit, especially one made of God knows what. But with his strength he drove it where it needed to be. After a few good presses from his overly sized arms it finally split at the object. He and Thor, who had been waiting patiently, worked to pry the shell open just enough to get Tony out.
Red trickled down his chin profusely all over the bed spread and white tile in front of him. He hacked slightly from the pressure that set on this good side. The doctor rushed over and carefully pulled him back in his bed. Tony winced and panted best he could manage, blood thinly trickling down with chin. His eyes were unfocused and darting around the room.
The room was once again encompassed in silence. Tony felt like he was floating, they'd doped him up best they could before clearing out of here. At the moment he was mildly content just dealing with the dull lingering pain, still it was manageable. They’d taken the liberty of upping the dosage of pain killers along with a time release button to supply them when he needed it. What was shocking was Tony was never a substance person. He never cared for them, didn't really need them until after Afghanistan.
She smiled shyly; in the end the only thing they could do at this point was remain optimistic. Worrying is like praying for something you don't want to happen. It was getting dark outside and they have yet to hear any word from the others. Thor remained on the roof as a look out and all was quiet, considering how late it's gotten already it doesn't seem like there would be any more surprises tonight. He'd probably be coming inside in a little bit pretty soon. After a little bit the computer maybe a loud electronic buzz to notify that the analysis was complete.
"We're going to need a bag of A positive to replace what he has lost. Come on people hustle don't forget why we're all here, we have to work our best to save this man. It's the least we can do after what he did for all of us." Some of the staff hung their heads a little lower, unsure whether or not they could save him or not, but being reminded of their duty they somehow found a burst of inspiration and purpose. Each of them carried out their tasked to the fullest of their capabilities.
I thought this was over with, all this hero stuff back and forth saving and risking lives, a onetime contract. It's exhausting. I'm tired. Why can't I just drift off back into sweet oblivion. Quiet no worry, a peaceful serenity. Oh I know. There are still things to be done. Old ghosts I have yet to deal with, things to build and lives to improve, people to look after. I can't die, at least not yet.
"Fine then good job paper weight." He shot back at the man, who was obviously not expecting a retort. He was always led to believe that the Captain wasn't capable of joking around and having a good time. He had to be serious being the leader and a hard ass all the time. But he had to give the man some props, that was a good comeback.
Tony cocked a brow. He figured it was worth a shot.
A near death experience can really open someone's eyes to a bunch of different things. One which may be the cruel truth is that humans are weak creatures. They can't stand up to something like what happened the other day. It was a god send that opened their eyes and will forever change their view on how they see the world. They needed to be protected and for some reason he felt there was still more trouble to come. Countless enemies would appear and try to disband their heroic attempts in keeping the peace. But they had to try.
Tony hovered directly in front of the incoming projectile; a thick dark gray trail of toxic concentrated smoke leading behind it. The missile itself however wasn't anything out of ordinarily just a typical run of the mill version of the cheapest thing Tony himself could manufacture back in high school. Nothing to get overly carried away with, especially not something he would unleash his entire arsenal out on. I mean sure even if it was as small and pathetic as it may be, it could definitely cause some tedious damage to his beautiful tower.
They were furious over what happened but who wouldn't be? Their friend was in critical condition and they had no idea what was going to happen next to make it worse they still hadn't found the culprit. Whatever was to happen from here on out would be imprinted on their memories for a long time. Whether it be a huge relief or an even big tragedy, they could only pray and wait. But hopefully the one lying in the hospital bed wouldn't remember much of the incident. That would be considered one of the uplifting aspects about being intoxicated at the time.
He pushed open the door to the room Tony had been gracious enough to let him use. He flicked on the light and leaned his shield up against the side of his nightstand. There were all sorts of things covering his bed; magazines, books, a laptop that Tony gave him to research on. Just anything he could use to learn about what he'd missed. He shoved everything to the side and threw the covers over to the side. He pulled his tank top off and tossed it in the corner of the room before flipping the switch to pitch black.
“I can’t, I have a hard time.”
“Sleep, she’ll be here soon.”
"There's no infection, its common to run a fever after serious trauma to the body, especially after a blood transfusion. Your bodies very weak, but the wound is clean and bound tight so long as you don't move around too much." He talked to Tony in a quite knowledgeable voice, explaining his condition on layman's terms meaning not to worry. He'd had enough to worry about what's one more on the pile. Tony starred at the doctor hearing every word but to his drug induced state it came delayed. He nodded slightly showing he understood.
Steve was left alone with two snoring team mates and the sudden feeling of restlessness. He glanced around the room before feeling the need to head to his room. He walked around the couch passed a sleeping Banner and noticed the tint of red on the tile. He stepped around it and grabbed his shield that was on the other side. "Steve.. I'm scared.." Those words rung in his ear, he could almost picture himself cradling the blood drenched Tony.
It’s been on silent, ah 7 missed calls from Pepper among several blocked which he could only assume was Fury. He wondered if he should call her back. Steve noticed he hesitated over the call back and spoke up. “Natasha did fill Pepper in briefly several hours ago, her flight lands at 8am.”
I do something I have yet to think of, for the sheer thought of it chilled my still form. I finally open my eyes. I was right. There was a sight far worse than that of pitch black. It was in open space littered with stars and debris floating over head. In some instances it might have been more comforting than absolute nothingness. But that wasn't the most disturbing aspect. There it was, the Chitauri.
"How long have you been here?" Tony spoke up. He didn't even look over, he knew who was there. His voice was low and rasped from overuse; still it didn't strain him to speak. He'd almost forgotten how it felt. Steve hesitated, pulling up a chair.
"Oh sorry, don't get mad or anything I'm not trying to be mean by ignoring you. I just need to concentrate so I make sure I don't miss a turn or hit some idiot who's not paying attention. When you're speeding through traffic you got to have good judgment." The driver said with a slight smile as he turned the corner, his eyes never leaving the road. His voice was deeper than expected, he was pretty skinny and his voice didn't really match his physic. At least he gave Bruce the courtesy of being polite and actually answering him.
"Lye still or else you'll opened up the rest if your wound." He said as he walked to the cabinets, pulling out another small bottle and syringe. "Don't worry. I'm not going to put you to sleep or anything this is just going to ease the pain. Is that ok Mr. Stark?"
He shouldn't be worried. With the advances of this generation, medical care should be one less thing he had to worry about. But he felt guilty for not being there. He should be along by his side just in case. Steve furrowed his brows in deep thought it seemed pointless passing wasted hours his eyes darting around the room.
A blinding light distorts my vision as a drift back, the shock of the explosion expelling me. I'm out of it. Everything fades back to black. I don't know where I am anymore. I'm lost yet again. I think. Am I dead? Is this hell, just one constant reoccurring sadistic void of darkness? Emptiness.
"It's fine Tony I just need a moment." Natasha she said from around the corner. She had the acute hearing of an owl which was a must when she needed to hear an interrogation taking place in room all the way on the other end of the hall. Tony on the other hand shrunk a little not expecting the Black Widow to hear him from where he was. She always made him nervous, ever since first meeting her.
Dr. Helshier thought it best for Tony's guests to leave and get some rest themselves. After all they have been here for a painstaking amount of time and what their friend really needed right now was a good amount of stress-free rest. They decided it was best to take his advice there wasn't much they could do at this point other than wait plus they did need to let the others know the good news.
Steve managed a smile even though his eyes haven't changed since leaving the hospital. His usually bright blue eyes remained dark and void of life even when he spoke of retaining hope. It's just at the moment nobody knew what their next move was, except maybe the mystery man who sent the present to their home in the first place.
At least they didn't have to spend much time calming the man bleeding out on the tile. Being as drunk as he was somehow kept him in high enough spirits to realize the extent of what happened. Not to mention the amount of adrenaline that was pumping threw him to keep him from noticing how bad he'd been injured. One moment he rocketed up in the sky. The next blowing up a simple missile he spent most of his life manufacturing. Safely landing in hopes of chatting and carrying on with his friends and then to just end up laying belly up with a thick shard of metal sticking out of him.
"My forensics shows me that it made of a material called Vibranium. I assume you've deducted this conclusion even before I have Ms. Romanoff." Jarvis informed the woman patiently waiting for forensics. He also pulled up on the big screen the detailed information about the mass and composition of the item. Even leaving some specs on Tony's blood type which coated it. Natasha sat down at the counter with Clint to her side as they both of them looked up at the giant monitor.
Tony smiled. He didn’t intend to but these things had a way of following him.
Steve was glad and felt like he could relax a little knowing now that Tony was in good hands. His expression calmed and he exhaled a breath that he seemed to be holding all the way on top floor. Along with the morphine the paramedics also injected him with something that would slow the bleeding just enough to effectively wrap his wound. The two trained medics worked to disinfect the area around the gash; Steve didn't realize just how gruesome it looked until he got a good look at it. He could almost hurl at the sight of it which he couldn't understand. He watched people die in front of him, seen others have a limb blown off, but he couldn't watch as modern medicine worked its miracles. Steve couldn't help his face from scrunching at the thought of his comrades from way back when.
His chest would never be right, on a daily it would ache and if he breathes just a bit too deeply the metal rubs just enough against his rib cage that it sends jolts through his body. He’d built up quite the tolerance for pain. Only taking pills when it became too much to ignore. He didn't want to develop a dependency for them, although given the situation he's currently in he could only pray it would take the pain away. He hit the button when it lit up and within minutes he could actually say for the first time since his ordeal he felt pretty decent.
"Hey... If it means anything.. I guess you were right.. My motor skills that is.. They were delayed." Tony redirected his eyes towards Bruce.
He sighed as the other was coming up the stairs completely out of wind. "You good?" he asked not helping the smile growing on his face as he watched Bruce hunching over to catch his breath. His curly hair a mess and stuck to the sweat on his face. "Yea yea I'm fine, just not used to climbing a thousand stairs like a super soldier."
Steve absorbed ever word he spoke as though it were scripture. The tone he used was intense and near shattering. He had been threw a lot, way more than Steve could ever imagine. In truth he hadn't been around for the time of the Hulk to know the harm he's caused. But he had an act of reading people and to him it was the man who was worth knowing. Not the history or rumors, most of what he has heard was all one sided and destructive. But with one simple chat with the person who carried the monster within him he could tell there was a deep sorrow that he also carried with him.
"I went from constant depression and attempted suicide to helping to heal the sick. It was a simple pleasure but it kept me from hating myself more than I already did. Then all of a sudden Natasha was sent to find me of all people to recruit into the Avengers. But not for the muscle but for the brain, for the person I was and not the thing I became, she wanted the scientist but not the monster. I'd have to admit however the other guy really came in handy toward the end."
Even so Thor still held some manner of respect for the man in armor, he thoroughly impressed the god. Not through his level of alcohol consumption but out get the idea. To impress Thor the god of thunder was not an easy feat, needless to say it wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. With Tony's quick thinking he even managed to take out the Chitauri mother ship. This incident however was deliberate attack, specifically to take out one of the Avengers. Tony being their prime target and them not thinking anything hazardous they took the bait.
He sat on the opposite side careful not to wake him; the others followed and sat opposite of Steve. Bruce rested his head against the cushions, happy to be back at home. Clint and Natasha sat next to him on the other side of the couch quietly before they felt the need to break the silence. "What happened, Steve?" Natasha said timidly not entirely sure if she wanted the answer. Despite the way he and Bruce spoke outside the door, his face still showed melancholy. Steve let out another held sigh before answering, not really wanting to think about it let alone retell the whole story.
"Whoa Tony don't try to move. You need to rest." Steve quickly sprung to his feet and continued to project that deep seeded worry in his tone and actions. He gently placed his hands on the other's shoulders to ease him and keep him from wriggling. As well as keep him calm and collected. The last thing he wanted was for him to be spazzing out after he made it through the trauma he has. After a few moments his breathing calmed and slowed becoming more regulated.
Still there's no excuse for leaving him all alone after going through so much, it didn't seem right. Steve sat up quick his mind made up. That's it. He'd had enough waiting as he sprang up quick to his feet. He's headed back to the hospital to wait at his friend's side.
“Yeah” It was a tiny utterance still Steve caught it.
He set a steady hand over the top of his wound, feeling the heavy bandaging. He seethed against the slightest touch as it throbbed vigorous. It was strange to experience the feeling of dying. To feel yourself slipping away without the slightest idea what was happening to you. It's terrifying.
They found two seats in the room and pulled them up next to the bed and watched him slowly breathe in and out with the oxygen mask on his face. Steve reached over and felt his forehead and frowned once he noticed how cold it still was. As far as they knew he was holding on. He had endured everything all the way up to the end of his procedure. One thing was true in the long run; he hadn't given up and was determined to continue the fight. Even if it wasn't a physical battle, his body might prove to be his strongest feat yet. The only thing they could do now was be patient and let him get some rest.
Steve couldn't help but pace back and forth in the lobby. His mind was going a mile a minute with no hope of slowing until he knew the situation. He'd never been much of a patent man, even bake in the old days before he joined the army or became a super solder he had always been antsy. Everyone thought he had ADD, even his mother before she passed away. She'd never been able to keep a leash on him. Not like it was a bad thing, Steve had always been a good boy. He would help out and clean; make dinner if his mother had been working all day and was tired. He was a kind boy but he hardly got tired and when he did he still kept on going.
It was strange seeing him as the son of one of his good friends. Hell he was still having trouble seeing the future as the present. He’s the spitting image; Tony likes to think they’re nothing alike. They do have their own differences and there's no way he could know what he was like in the time he was asleep. There was no way he could’ve known Howard would be consumed by his obsession with finding him.
The blond nodded. “Don’t go making it a habit.”
Natasha knelt down behind him, taking his head it into her arms and gently stroking his hair rhythmically in order to calm his nerves. She always been gentle even though she'd come across tougher than nails and then some. The same woman who wouldn't hesitate to snap an arm in order to get what she wanted. Not many people had seen the caring side of her. Especially not Tony unfortunately he wasn't over thinking that little detail much at the moment.
After some time a doctor entered the room. The heart monitor sent an alert to his station that his patient was in distress, which he clearly was. Tony was hunched over the side of the bed bordering about passing out or puke. His oxygen mask was removed and dangling down at his side. The only thing still filling his lungs was the thin tubing fixed in his nose.
"Umm it's an honor to have a hero of the city take a ride in my cab." The man could barely contain himself, usually when Steve was recognized he would have been a bit coyer. Most of the time he'd blush but something told him this wasn't the right time to be flabbergasted so he nodded in acknowledgment.
She looked at herself in the mirror and smirked at the thought of working with this group even longer than she had anticipated. Now that Tony decided to generously donate the tower to the cause; the Avengers initiative. She was going to see a lot more of them in the near future. She was ok with this. She just kind of had the feeling she didn't really belong. After all her and Clint were on a completely different level compared to the rest. But they needed the knowhow as well as the authority. They were after all the most qualified to handle things in hazardous situations.
All that was left now was for Tony to destroy the missile then they could go back to truly enjoying each other's company this time. Now that the elephant was out of the room the two of them felt as though they could actually relax this time. Even if that meant dealing with the ultimate joker drunk, sir Iron Man himself. He chuckled at his untold remark then redirecting his sights up in the sky to watch his friend.
He clenched his already tense fist full of sheets. I'd be nothing for the ones who put him there to slip in and finish him off. It might be nothing, but he couldn't help but think that way. Someone needed to stay at his side. If he didn't have a nearly comatose Banner at his side at the time he would have stayed. The others also needed a brush of hope to ease their tensions.
Just when she stops worrying she gets news from home that he’s in the hospital. She told Natasha that she would be back in New York early in the morning that she would ride over soon as she lands.
At 3 am a nurse comes in to check Tony's vitals. She was a young blonde with hair pulled back in a messy bun from the circles under her eyes it was obvious she. She seemed surprised to see Steve sitting there in the dark since he had been there during her last check and he didn't make a sound when she entered. Only when she stepped up close did he make himself known, nodding as he slid back and out of her way.
Tony flew as fast as his arc reactor could power. Knowing full well it wouldn't take much long before the missile would reach its destination. He had at least a couple minutes left to destroy it. He had much practice in blowing these sort of things up. Since he'd pretty much showed up on the front doorstep of multiple terrorist organizations and ruin their day. He hated the use of bombs on the public. Given he used to manufacture and sell them to who ever had the means to buy them. That's how he made his fortune, with blood money.
It wouldn't take him no more than 2 minutes reached his destination but for some reason it seems farther than it was. I guess you could say was more impatient than he had realized. Being as anxious as he was he'd at least figured it wouldn't of been a complete waste of his time. It should have been more of a threat than it was. Oh well beggars can't be choosers.
He shuffled back over to his bed, careful not to bump into anything. He stuck a hand out to feel the soft silk sheets and allowed himself to embrace them face first. He buried his face in his pillow feeling the cold cloth from not being unused all day. It relaxed his tensed body. He could feel his body urging him to sleep, yet his mind continued to run a mile a minute. Constantly thinking about his friend, whether he was alright or not, if he was still breathing or if the worst had already happened and he wasn't there. Honestly he could understand how the others were able to fall asleep like they did. He cracked his eyelids open to look that the clock, it read 3:28 am, which meant he only had to lie there for 4 more hours and 32 minutes until he could see his friend again. Hopeful he would be in better shape than when he left him.
It happens all over again like a reoccurring dream. Each time I get closer and closer to the dangers. I can almost feel the heat and then nothing. Quiet. This will happen a few times over before I begin to wriggle and sweat. Even after each time I see it I can never get used to it. The only difference is I know when it's coming. I'll never get used to feeling of falling, completely out of control. The nightmares never seem to cease.
Tony woke up gasping for air. Every inhale burned like an inferno. He was in such unimaginable amount of pain he could hardly think. Gripping the sheets with whatever strength he had left, unable to keep the cries from remaining contain. That didn't prevent him from trying; he bit his lip and muffled them best he could. He hated pity and he wasn't about to submit to this feeling how unbearable it may be.
Steve began to count down from one than on two he pulled as gently and quickly as possible at the angle it was set. Figuring it was better than the suspense of waiting till the count of three. The less expectant the quicker it would go and it would hurt less than when tensing in preparation. It was a trick he learned during the war. There were a lot of casualties that had to be dealt with as quickly and cautiously as possible.
"It's not your fault." Tony said. Steve shifted his eyes to the floor idly tracking the tiles. He knew there wasn’t anything more he could do but still it felt wrong sitting here. “I just…” Tony cut off whatever accuses Steve had in the chamber.
"Tony please stay with me," His voice came out as near pleading not usual for the man who simulated the embodiment of strength and power. It didn't look right to see Steve begging.
"I know it's odd but I kind of have the feeling of being an outcast most of the time. I really don't belong in this day and age, like I'm just some old timer from the past that has no idea what's going on. Everything here is so confusing and I'm friends with someone how confuses me on a daily basis just by trying to explain something to me. What's even crazier is he's the son of my friend back in the day and we look the same age. But the point is even if I feel like I don't belong, there always seems to be people who need me, need someone to depend on."
'I wonder what Steve has to say to me, he looked kind of out of it when I last saw him. There's no telling what's going on with that guy. I don't even wanna know what Banners thinking in that hyperactive mind of his. Hell I'm not even entirely sure what happen. All I know was there was blood, muffled what seemed lots of screaming and the urge to nod off when I was too afraid to. Glad that's over with; maybe they can enlighten me when they come. If they come."
Blood drenched the already torn apart Def Leopard shirt Tony had been wearing underneath his suit even more. The huge gaping hole in the man looked like nothing more than a tunnel of shredded flesh. It looked sickening but the others had so many past experiences with gruesome injures in the field that it was tolerable. Well at least for the ones looking at it. Not for the one enduring it.
He blinked once again to see if the time would change any quicker but it didn't. At this point he had two choices. One he could go back to sleep and let the sun or staff wake him up, even worse his subconscious. Or lie awake and wait till morning. Right option two it is. He let his head weight back into the pillow and stared up at the ceiling. The reactor in his chest a constant night light, yet it did no justice in scaring away the monsters. He sighed figuring it would be better to get his mind off the subject and distract himself.
"See no big deal." Tony said switching off his boosters, making a loud thud as the full weight of his suit hit the stone patio. Steve and Bruce had watched the whole ordeal from the roof top and weren't surprised that he was well able to handle the small projectile. He's had more than enough experience with handling these kinds of things, even if he'd had more than a little much to drink. Considering he probably took joy rides out in the night sky drunk as hell whenever he felt bored or in need of a thrill after he'd been working for a long time.
Tony blinked lazily rolling his head to the side meeting Steve in the eyes. He concentrated on breathing, his lungs only working at a third of their compactly.
Steve and Bruce each took one of his arms and wrapped it around their shoulder, gently hoisting Tony to his feet. The duo walked the man all the way inside and set him down carefully on the tile, leaning him up against the wall until they could figure out what was the cause of his discomfort. "What is wrong with the man of Iron?! Did he not destroy the explosive heading this way!?" Thor burst into the quarrel utterly concerned and confused, looking at the countries captain and the not so green man for answers.
It was near impossible to fall asleep not knowing what might happen. Steve wasn't much of a patient man when it came to another well being, he always wanted to be there just in case. He'd always been that way, the kind of overseer of his peers. He starred at the shadowed ceiling, his mind racing with what if's. He hated to be pessimistic but sometimes he just couldn't help it. In a way being overly optimistic isn't realistic; after all you always have to be prepared for the worst even if you remain hopeful.
"He's awake.." Steve gasped as he rushed to the man's side. Barely able to contain his concern, he had waited hours for any change on his condition but not expecting much, especially not for him to be awake already. Hell he was just glad that he didn't slip into a coma or something. So that was another relief. He pulled his chair closer to Tony's bed and sat down and took his hand. He grunted once more unintentionally scrunched his eyelids in blatant discomfort before he lightly fluttered them open. He looked so weak as if one touch from Steve would make him cave in.
"It's a strong possibility. But how and why?" She said to herself as she bent down to pick up the shard. It was still dripping heavily with blood as she held it in her hands, some running off onto her boots. She ignored the mess and trudged over to one of the many lab observation tables Tony had set up in the back of the room. They were everywhere; he was just that excessive kind of guy. Whenever a creative thought popped into his head he'd rush to the nearest station and do whatever he knows best. Anything he could do to impress Bruce Banner, make him jealous more like.
"Does this make you my body guard?"
The hysterical gamma scientist took deep breaths to calm himself out of having a complete meltdown which in any case would be the most unhelpful thing he could do at the moment. A nine foot tall green monster with a temper problem was not needed for this mission. Time is what they needed and they were quickly running out of it.
"Someone has to stay and guard the tower, if there is someone who sent the original missile then what to say they won't send a second one, we can't take any more chances. Thor you got the thunder power in case we someone to detonate another one from a distance."
Bruce liked the idea of working with others that put their faith in him. Who trusted him even though they hardly knew him; they knew more about what he'd done rather then what he was capable of. But since they've seen him that way and actually take control they could care less about what he's done in the past and more of what he was capable of doing in the future. For the first time in a long time he had hope.
He ran a hand down his tightly bandaged side. Even with all the drugs running though him he could still feel the dulling sensation as his finger tips caressed the cloth covering. He didn't even want to know what it looked like, might even throw him back into a state of unwelcomed panic. No thank you.
In the drawer there were a couple family pictures, not many however. There was a couple with family, his parents’ together young, a half dozen of him as a child and his mother, Jarvis whom the Al is based. Several news clippings of personal and technical achievements, business, some of flattering pictures of Pepper he wish he hadn’t come across. He quickly shifted them away out of respect for the both of them. He already felt guilt for snooping that was until he stumbled across some really dark blurry picture of what looked like a hostage. Strange it seemed to go with an assortment of files.
“This shit happens when you declare yourself a target to the entire world.” He remembered doing that shortly after defeating Obadiah. It hasn’t done him any favors. Now this, it’s a harsh reminder of those out there only for themselves. He didn’t regret a thing after all these things remind him of what’s important, the reason why he wears the suit.
"I'll make sure to start a training regiment with you as soon as we finish up here," Steve said as he helped the man steady himself to his feet. "You know that's very generous of you but I'm more of the brain and the backup muscle in desperate situations. I don't think it'll wise to over work me. You know I don't have the temperament. "He let out with staggered breathing as he rubbed the back of his neck.
The doctor injected the now clearer liquid into the split in the IV. Small swirls sprawled out every which way. It looked almost surreal as it began to flow in one single direction, eventually leading into his veins and blood stream. He then took a cloth with antiseptic and wiped the red away from his still clenched jaw.
"Vibrainium and imbedded within it a homing device. Nat disabled it but it seems you were their target, Tony." He was currently staring up at the ceiling. He suspected as much. It wasn't a surprise, this was normal for him right? Target for missiles were the norm. He’d aggravated numerous crime syndicates before, survived 2 months in the desert. Yeah he'd be fine.
"Yes I noticed that," he trailed off slightly hoping she would get to the point she was trying to make. He was really tired. It was hard enough to keep his eyes open let alone focus on Natasha. "What I wanted to tell you was the thing that pierced his armor was Vibranium. The same stuff your shield is made out of." Whatever was lulling Steve asleep dissipated and was replaced with something else. Why would something as like that be hidden in a missile? He narrowed his eyebrows at the red head in front of him who was waiting for a response. Although that was probably the reaction she was looking for. "Why?"
"Well in any case are you ok now Brucey? I mean you have us now don't you?" Tony smiled his rosy red cheeks reflecting his level of maturity but he was being as sincere as he could. This meant something. That they all cared for him even though they didn't know him all that well or of what he'd done in the past. Maybe they did and didn't even care. But one thing was true. That even though you can have a checkered past that you are in control of your future and what you make of it. Love the sinner not the sin or even the monster.
Steve watched as he cut the cloth away from the man's body. Blood oozed from between the bindings but overall the stitches remained intact which was good news for them. He grabbed a couple gaze pads and cleaned him up and with Steve's help redressed his wound. "He has a really serious injury and with a cracked spine as well as ribs we can't be too careful."
"You good," he said before placing a hand on his shoulder. The other shifted slightly but nodded, taking in a deep breath before leaning his head back against the head rest. His eyelids were closed tightly until a moment passed and he opened them back again. The bright green tinge slowly melted into his usual soft brown eyes. "Just stressed out but I can handle it, I promise."
I am back in space. Home was in the opposite direction and I was facing an armada in which I have no means of defending myself. The suit is no longer responding, blatantly unable to correspond once on another plan. Jarvis stopped talking to me and I am left with only my thoughts. Although pessimistic they were there, speaking to me. They're coming at me, their target: the small hole I assume was still behind me and well beyond my reach.
Tony not used to such a pain let out a bloodcurdling scream. One that made all the all the other Avengers cringe. Natasha tried her best to keep the other still bit even the sound of him in pain was even unbearable for even the master assassin who tortured people for a living. Thor held his wriggling body still throughout the calamity to prevent further affliction.
"He being a rich boy and all he'd be able afford another liver if he needed to. It's no big deal." Clint scoffed from his seat on the far side of Natasha. Bruce just rolled his eyes at his snide remarks. He figured he was too good to be playing along in this childish game. "Well no one said anyone in particular had to be the funny one." Hawkeye was the one to give him props for a least trying. Thor only joined in once he saw the awkward look on his face when he was denied laughter.
He took in a shaky breathe before deciding to give an answer. "Just a bunch of stuff I wish I could forget. Old ghosts I guess." It was becoming a far too familiar feeling lately. At first it was simply the time he spent in Afghanistan, being torture and made a slave to build weapons; nothing but a useful commodity who was only good for crafting articles of war. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree in that department.
"Absolutely Ms. Romanoff, the specimen should take about 10 minutes to fully examine." She nodded stepping away from the table as the machine was making little beeping noises and going back and forth with the little blue grid. She stared down at her hands and clenched them tight and releasing her grip to get a good feel for the substance covering her usually supple hands. They were wet and sticky being coated in thick, slowly clotting blood. She walked over to the sink and held her hand up in the light; it shined in the light and felt like it was an ironic kind of sick joke. The substance that retained life could look so beautiful under the right conditions.
He found another blueprint tucked away for the same gadget and it purpose. It’s written on dirty recycled paper with two different kinds of handwriting. One he could easily recognize as Tony’s the other he couldn’t pinpoint. It reads the device’s purpose to keep the shrapnel from reaching his heart and that it was imbedded in his chest. He always thought that thing was just part of his suit, something he wore not a piece of tech keeping him alive. It must be pretty nerve wracking to carry that burden.
Steve lightly tapped the rail of the bed to the beat of the heart monitor. It was steady and rhythmic the way it should be; words could not describe the relief modern day machines brought him. They kept his friend breathing and gave him more blood to replace what he'd lost. Things have advanced so much since his time. He smiled as he listened to Tony's light breathing the sound from oxygen tank drowning out his wheezing. Steve could still hear it however, thanks to his heightened senses.
He turned his head back around to the column off stairs and let the door close behind him. He could hear Bruce's footsteps above his as he continued to climb the seemingly endless stairwell. Steve hustled up the flits as if it were cake, eventually passing Bruce even if he had a couple minutes head start. He was just too fit to keep up with so he continued at his regular pace; it wasn't like it was a race or anything.
Jarvis had taken the liberty of unhinging most of the Iron Man armor once he'd found the breach. However the abdomen was the one exception, which needed to be removed manually. Steve and Natasha at the moment were rummaging through Tony's tools looking for his special metal cutters, Bruce remained by his side.
Steve remembered everything, the heartache and loss the after effect of it all. Can you imagine surviving it all and then some? It's like living two different lifetimes, opposite in every aspect. It works on you, constantly grinding down from within your core. That weight you constantly have to carry on your shoulders. It changes a person.
I'm surrounded by total darkness I can feel it I don't even need to see it, nothing but the cold, quiet void of empty space. My hands begin to shake. I've never been this far from my comfort zone I don't know what to do. I have a pretty good idea what's around me. I chose to be oblivious rather than its counter; after all it's a better state than panic. I feel nothing just weightlessness and the absence of oxygen in my lungs as I continue to drift.
They moved Tony to a private room after they ran whatever tests they wanted. They deducted that in addition to the lung he had 3 broken ribs, another 4 cracked on both sides and a few cracked vertebra. It was like he got punched by the Hulk himself and hit the wall behind him. He laid in what seemed to be a very comfortable bed with the covers pulled up to his chest his arms on the outside of it. The room was fairly decent sized and recently refurbished, the décor was nice and he had a window. By this time the sun had completely gone down and the moon was at its highest.
"So have you had this job for a long time?" Bruce said timidly wonder whether or not small talk would make him feel better or not. It was bad enough to be worrying over something you didn't have much control over, but worse to be stuck with just your thoughts about it. It was starting to drive him crazier than he already was. At first the driver didn't even acknowledge his question, being preoccupied
"Huh.. Where.. am I?" Tony slowly came back to consciousness; his voice raspy and muffled underneath the oxygen mask strapped to his face, a slight wheeze with each inhale he took. Curtsy of his broken ribs, it was a miracle that he managed to fly all the way back to the tower before realizing what happened. His chest was wrapped tightly with tinged white bandages which made it nearly impossible for him to move. That was the desired effect, Stark being as hardheaded as they come. Although they could bet he'd be out for a pretty long while.
"Thank you Hector, sorry to be such a pain in the ass this late." He heard the man scoff at his remark, obviously unprepared for it. The fact of the matter was he didn't want to move even if he could, the medication made him almost mend into the covers. Hector nodded his head and exited the room leaving Tony in silence yet again. He rolled his eyes back over to the digital clock, 5:16 am.
He picked up one of the scalpels from the metal plate to his side and cut the gash wider and set retractors in place to hold the wound open. His assistant held a little siphoning tube and used it to suck up the blood that was still gushing from his lung. All of a sudden the heart rate monitor began to wail with erratic beeps. This alerted the lot to no prevail. The more experienced ones sprung into action and quickly thought of the best course of action. "He's going into cardiac arrest!" Tony's labored breath became more and more sporadic, though he was still unconscious he was mildly tossing under the stress. Two of the nurses held him down at the shoulders to prevent him from hurting himself anymore.
Thor walked through the glass panels out onto the concrete patio. Tony as well as his two accompanists left a couple minutes ago, the rest of the group watching as the beaten man was carried into the elevator. When the cold steel doors shut they were sure they would be seeing the brunette again. All they could do now was to wait and keep an eye out. Thor only knew these people for a couple days but they were beginning to grow on him. It was nice to have a change of pace every now and again.
Steve continued before feeling the need to look away from the injured man and stare at the floor, noticing the all too familiar white tile. He set his elbows on his knees and buried his face in his palms. At a loss until a few more timid words escaped his lips whether or not they would fall on deaf ears. "I've lost a lot of friends Tony.. I don't what to lose you too.."
“We’ll find who did this.” Steve was serious, but oddly Tony seemed to accept his fate. He assumed it was the drugs. He didn’t care if they caught the culprit, there will always be someone else to take their place.
"You ok?" Rhetorical question of course, "Yea, I'll live." His eyes were dark and full of dread. The sting in his side was getting harder to ignore. "Worst part is I lost my buzz."
After a few minutes it had taken its full effect. Tony's eyes became less strained, his muscles relaxed and the stern look his face had held slacked into a softened, peaceful one. His breathing became more steadied and controlled. Having once been hunched over the side of the bed in complete agony, now allowed himself to be settle back under the covers by a man he didn't know.
"I.. don't want to.. go back to sleep.." The doctor looked into his patient's eyes and saw something that should never be there, pure terror. Tony Stark wasn't afraid of anything. He took on an alien armada just a few days ago. He thought to himself. The countless terrorist he'd single handily taken out, and yet he was afraid of going to sleep? It was odd but he wasn't one to judge a man who helped save the planet.
"Good job solider." Steve said smiling.
Tony's past childhood were always sour when regarding his father because in his mind he was always known as second. He seemed cold because of his work he was never around. Steve could’ve never known that the Jarvis for whom the AI is named for was once that person who practically raised Tony.
The doctor seemed to dance around that portion of his prognosis. Or perhaps it was just his overactive imagination. More often than not he was his own worst enemy. He hadn’t brought it up but this was the longest he’d remind coherent enough to hold a conversation.
He eyed the screen; even on the lowest setting the brightness stung his eyes. He shut it off setting it down at his side. “A few more hours won’t hurt her.”
The vehicle was backed up to the door making it easily accessible. The two paramedics slide out the padded stretcher and Steve carefully laid Tony on his back while Bruce elevated the head side. One of the paramedics gathered an oxygen tank and mask, placing it over his face. Tony had been gasping for air ever since Steve pulled the shard from his body. He was in need of precious oxygen, with only one of his lungs working to full capacity and the other with a gaping hole.
Bruce's voice intensified which startled Steve. A hint of green surfaced in some spots. But he was able to suppress his urges. He'd come too far to just up and lose it in some hospital parking lot.
Tony broke eye contact with the blond and slowly drifted off, sinking back into the pillow, unable to keep his eyelids open any longer let alone maintain consciousness. They gently closed shut as every muscle relaxed and his body went limp. Steve's eyes widened to a panic, immediately looking over to one of the paramedics for any sort of reassurance. To his surprise there was no reaction, just one of them analyzing his wounds and the other gingerly pumping oxygen.
Blood still ran from his chin while he silently painted. He continued to shudder underneath the blankets. The doctor held up a hand and felt Tony's forehead. He could tell a growing fever from the radiating heat from his temple. As for the blood well that wasn't a surprise. His lung has yet to fully heal. Bleeding was bound to happen time to time.
It's funny in a way; even after all of this he never would have imagined himself working well with others. That is unless of course he was the leader of the so called team then maybe. But he didn't care about that, if anything he's just happy to be the benefactor of the group. He was just happy to be a part of the team even though in the beginning it seemed more like a chore than a duty. If it meant anything they really did come through in a time of need and it felt great having a common goal for the greater good. And even though they didn't know each other they managed to pull it off and saved lives. If that doesn't call for a drink than I don't know what does.
He tried so many times to impress his father but it didn't make much of a difference. He could have created the cure for cancer, but unless it had a way of finding his Capitan America hidden in ice it was not interesting. He gave up after awhile and learned it was better just to do things for yourself rather than someone who didn't appreciate you. All he gained from his father was the company and his inherited genus. Unfortunately some of his old habits as well, that's what put him in this situation, his uncontrollable ego and need to drown his troubles in alcohol. The thought of all that was starting to make him depressed. He figured it was about time to answer the man hovering over him.
