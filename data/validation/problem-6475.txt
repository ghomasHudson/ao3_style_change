“Stark? Can I talk to you for a moment please?” Steve asked him in the captain’s voice and Tony nodded to him .
“You told him about what happened between the three of us?” Steve finally spoke and it was like he got betrayed.
“Woah easy tiger I know I’m sexy but now I like to take it easy on the bed and not roughly.” Tony wiggled his eyebrows and Bruce smiled to him and shake his head.
and Tony entered his lab his legs couldn’t hold him anymore and he fall on his knees and he broke down crying.
“You’re. I don’t love him and I know he doesn’t love me, but he let’s me in. You’re here because of them. I’m going to have a power and thanks to him and this stupid agent Natasha,” He closed his eyes and took a breath.
“Your Virgin ass in the mood for what captain?” Tony asked him and his virgin ass wasn’t in the mood for Tony’s bullshit. Steve ignored him again and walked past Tony so he could go to the kitchen, but Tony grabbed his wrist and stopped him.
How Tony supposed to live after what he saw? Loki wishes the time will get back so he won’t make the same mistake and let Tony see what happened.
He opened the door and there was no sound at all, he sighed and moved in then he froze when the lights turned on.
Peter was losing his power once he saw the cold eyes starting to look at him like he was a stranger.
Clint and Natasha breached the room and Bruce following after them, telling them about Tony's health and they can't tell him.
“Tony? Can you hear me? Please say yes, please?” Steve tried again but there’s no response at all. Steve sighed and closed his eyes he was trying to gather himself.
“What happened?!” Steve’s voice was loud that Tony’s face pinched in pain.  Steve crouched near Clint and start touching Tony’s face.
“We’re not together now.” Tony answered like it was a normal thing but inside he couldn’t believe it.
“Peter we’re just trying to help you baby. I assume you that no one will take off your suit again or do something bad to you.” Steve said and Peter can see it was true but he didn’t care right now, let them take his suit or grounded him forever.
“You’re not monster. Y– ah– You’re the best! You’re the most kind person I’ve ever- ngh– met!” He was trying to make him feel better about himself and he was trying to make Bruce feel safe about himself.
But when an orange circle opened to show Stephan who was covered in blood and he was breathing heavily. Tony run to him .
His thoughts were lost when they landed. He had no idea where they were, but it’s  looked like the desert of Afghanistan, like the place where he was tortured.
“Why you did this to him even if it was a mission!” Bucky snapped at them suddenly and Tony jolted and put his hand on his heart .
"There's a lot of places, Captain. We're going to find out once we breach the other bases." Natasha replied and he nods.
“Babe go back to your bed you’re still tired you scared me “ Steve kissed Tony’s hand and Tony smiled to him again.
“You’re going to solve your problems now!” Steve snapped at them, Tony sighed and Peter  pulled himself from Tony.
He asked as Thor was on top of him. His voice was shaking and as another storm hit the place, his grip tightened on Thor’s shoulders.
But for Sharon she hates it she always tells him that he looks like a homeless man and Steve hates her for hating the things Tony in love with .
“Screw you and screw everything about you ! I won’t let you kill him !” Bucky stood and walked to the door
“Thanks Tony, you’re the best.” He gave him one last kiss and then he stood and started wearing his clothes.
And once he finished and go to sit with the others he wasn’t looking or talking to Natasha and she was looking at him .
He’s going to give on Tony . He was never enough for Tones . He loves him but Tony deserves one more beautiful and stronger and even someone richer tham Steve .
Peter was looking up at her theough his eye lashes and knowing very well that if no one killed her, then he's the one who'll.
“You could never be like Howard. Howard was better than you and he’ll be forever better than you.” Tony swears that he can hear his father’s laughing in the background.
"Are you alright ?" The voice of Nebula brought him out of his thoughts, and he smiled to her . What happens to him ? Why he’s so kind and good with her ?
Tony was looking at the video that were playing he saw Bucky killing them he feels the anger in him he wanted to maybe just beat him nothing more but as he moved to him Steve hold him from behind
“I - I can’t believe them ?! My friend please don’t cry ! I ? I’ll kill them all if you want please stop crying my friend!” Thor made Tony smile for real .
“But I don’t understand that what I’m ? Am I angel ? Demon? And why the angels want to kill me ?” Tony asked
Then Thor ripped Peter’s shirt and took off his harness, for Peter he knows this is his end. He just looked around at them and seeing them all except Tony.
“I want to.” Tony whispered to him and Bruce eyes widened. The hand that was rubbing his arm was under his shirt touching his bare skin and the one was on his lips moved to his hair.
It’s clicked in their heads when they saw the knives. This is Loki, but why he was in this body? Oh...
He wish he never was one of the avengers. He wish he had a normal life, But he wish he could be forever with Steve.
when he was sitting on his chair reading a book and all he think about was Tony . And he was surprised that Tony come to him and he couldn’t help but smile . Nat you’re so wrong Tony won’t give up on me .
Tony’s smile dropped and he found the floor is interesting so he kept looking at it and Bruce gave him the time but he was pissed off and Tony wasn’t talking so Bruce sighed and Tony looked up at him.
Peter couldn’t hear what they’re saying anymore, they were yelling at eachother. The only one who was silent was him. Everyone in the room was yelling and there’s sounds of punch and he curled on himself. He just wanted everyone to just shut up and let it go.
Tony wakes up and groans in pain then he looks around to see Steve sleeping on the chair beside him. It was midnight, he kept looking at Steve then he smiled and drifted off again.
“Peter what’s wrong? Are you hurt? What’s hurting you baby?” and once again Steve was imin his personal space.
“Bruce ? Can you see if there’s a wound or anything else here ?” Tony asked Bruce who just nodded and When Tony took of his T-shirt Bruce was speachless .
“What’s wrong captain? And it’s like you care about me?” Tony asked leaning back to the chair he was sitting on.
In the next morning he was hoping it was only just a dream but the pain in his body nah it's already another thing.
He sitted Peter on the couch beside Bruce and decided to face the one who destroyed his beautiful life .
“Oh Shit! I’m so sorry uncle Bruce! I-it’s my fault and I’m really sorry!” He start wiping the tea from Bruce’s chest, the last thing he wanted is to piss this guy off. Shit there was a strong hand holding his wrist, he froze and looked up at Thor. There’s something wrong in Thor’s eyes they seems so distracted, he still can see the love behind this lock but he doesn’t know what happened.
“Tony it’s not a problem . Believe me it’s a beautiful thing to be angel or a demon “ Thor said hugging Tony
He kept locking himself until the night come he was worried if he’ll go to his room he’ll find Steve with sharon he sighed and asked FRIDAY
"Yeah.. Nick was pain in the ass." Tony hummus and he reads about it. It was in the same circus Clint’s rised in. It’s seems that it’s affected Clint and Tony wants to be there for him. It’s the main reason that he’s here in the kitchen in the middle of the night.
“Tony you should rest seriously babe we can’t resk your health like that “ Steve tried again putting his hand on Tony’s cheek but , Tony just hold Steve’s hand and kissed it and Steve started hating when Tony is kissing his hand . That’s mean he’s trusting him and he loves him . But Steve knew that he doesn’t deserve it .
"Yeah, whatever. I'm going to kill you and send your body to them." She sing song it and befor he can open his mouth to piss her off more, she lifted him with her power and hits him to the wall.
“Yes, you are and it’s hurt so bad Clint. If I disappoint y’all then I’m sorry... I’m so sorry Clint, but don’t give me your back! Damn it Clint I...” he stood and kneels in front of Clint who was shocked. “I don’t want the cold treatment from you... Please Clint?” Tony can feel his eyes burning with tears, but if Clint pushed him away now then he’ll leave and accept Clint’s decisions. But of course Clint won’t push him away, Clint’s hand was touching Tony’s cheek and Tony closed his eyes.
For now there’s no breakfast and the last time he didn’t make breakfast he was burned in his hand and of course cause Clint was in bad mood so he just slammed Peter’s head into the table, and then he was making breakfast for them while he’s bleeding.
Peter is more important than anyone in this room . Tony can’t take it anymore Sharon didn’t get enough in hurting him she decided to hurt the people he loved.
Steve never hold his hand like that when they’re eating. Why Steve doing this to him ? why everyone doing this to him ? Of course he did something wrong so they’re acting like that . He should ask FRIDAY about it . He looked at them to see Sharon whispering in Steve’s ear and She was half hugging Steve’s arm and Steve was laughing. He can let him laugh he can love him more . Why can’t he see that ? Why Steve is so blind to not see Tony’s love for him ? Why everyone chose Sharon on him ?
But he never touched it cause he can feel that Tony doesn’t like anyone touching it . And then Steve never felt like he deserves Tony’s love . When they had sex for the first time Steve saw the love in Tony’s eyes and it’s hurting him so much that he doesn’t deserve it . He doesn’t deserve Tony . After that he start letting Tony facing the pillow and not facing him . And Tony wasn’t complaining about it .
“You can do what ever you want to do without asking me Clint.” Tony says after they finish kissing eachother and then Clint was resting his head on Tony’s shoulder and Tony dropped the blanket over them.
"Where's my kid?" He asks feeling his throat burning, and again Steve the savior gave him glass of water.
“Woah! Petey, take it easy. What happened? I can see it in your eyes that you were crying- No! Don’t lie to me about this Stark son.” Thor warns him and Peter looked at the ground.
“Sir he’s in your bedroom and he’s reading a book “ Friday replied to him and he smiled. He still can win this fight . he took a shower thanks to god there’s bathroom in the lab . He went up and open the door Steve saw him and smiled,Tony’s heart warmed and he go to sit in Steve’s lap
“Well if I was a demon that means I’m going to hurt the people I love ?” Tony asked his eyes glowing with tears .
“yeah Thank you so much because of you now I’m having Tony Stark only for me “ Steve said and look into Tony’y eyes and kissed him they deapened the kiss
They were never proud of him, Howard was a monster. His mother was a monster too, but sometimes she was soft with him.
“Baby that’s me. I’m Thor your uncle, I’m not going to hurt you. That’s it. You’re doing great baby.” Thor tried again and this time he leaned into the touch and that’s was a sign to Thor who wrapped his arms around Pete protectively and he throw glances towards Steve, Tony, Stephan and Pepper.
“Hmmm My demon is thirsty for the blood?” Bucky asked and start walking to Tony who hide his face in his hands .
“I’m good actually perfect. And I just wanna talk to Steve but when I saw you guys I decided to stay and have a nice morning with you “ She said looking into Steve’s eyes then looking at Tony .
They don't know why Hulk was scared and he turned to Bruce in the middle of the fight and Bruce didn't leave them fight alone, he stayed with them. Clint came to protect Bruce, but in the end they ended saving Tony and got serious injuries because of him.
Peter run to his room and locked it behind him, he threw him self at his bed and buried his face into his pillow. He kept crying and fearing that they'll give up on him or they'll go back to their old habits and hurt him again, or worse what if they felt guilty for what they did and they'll never be the same again.
He can see Tony’s hands and legs at shaking but he felt guilty about what he did. Tony doesn’t deserve to be treated like that. He was nice with them.
Of course Natasha was more important than him, after all he was the last favorited one so this is what he should do and he did.
“If something happened to him I swear by my life that I’ll make sure to drink all your blood “ Tony warned and she cried
"There! There! In this file." Steve entered the place and found The guy's head on the table while Natasha holding the gun to his head and Clint just watching.
Even when there was events Tony was making out with different girls infront of him and then in the next morning he’ll say that he’s sorry and thats he was drunk.
he moved back and hold Steve’s hand with his both hand he kissed it and Steve was only looking at him doing nothing more
"Hey uncle Bruce. Ah guys? Can we leave this place?" He asked and the tiredness of the past week finally showing on him.
It was true that he felt jealous of Buckey and he was thinking Steve was in love with Buckey but what happened in Siberia assured him that. Steve had already loved Bucky .
He closed his eyes to gather himself. He wanted to shout at her and tell her that he tried to kill him self, but nothing happened.
He hates it when all the attention is being on him. He hates it when someone wants to say that Tony is a weak person.
"Aunt Pepper! Please, I can't take it! They're all looking like someone kicked their puppies! Change the house for us!" He was begging her to change their house. Especially after seeing Tony looking at someplace where he hurt Peter and the tears just fall before he gathered himself and left to his workshop.
In our room ? On our bed ? The way you’re facing her when you’re having sex ? you never faced me when we have sex ! And even when I ride you ! You always hate to face me ! shit the way your hand is on her chest exactly where her heart is ! You never liked my heart! I can see the disgust in your eyes when you see it ! When we have sex I always keep wearing something I never was shirtless when we were having sex ! When the first time we have sex it was because of me for sure I’m the one who pleaded you to have sex with me .
“I wanna see how you look like . Come on “ He was talking to his wings and he smiled to himself he realized that he loved them before he know how they’re looking.
“Fuck off Quill we don’t want any troubles!” Clint snapped at him wich lead to the one who called Quill pushing him to the floor.
“I’m sorry Steve I’m really Tired I don’t know what I’m doing I ? I guess I need Time to rest “ Tony said his face is hot and red
“Bruce? Really help me to stood first.”He tried to drop it starting by helping him to stood And they did.He leaned on Thor and they walked to the midic wing.
Until Natasha broke the TV. “He told you to turn it off!” She kneeled in front of him and he was pleading them to stop even though everything just stopped rightnow. It’s hard how he fall apart in front of them all.
“Wow... My son’s hiding things from me and he’s telling them to you. What a shame Peter.” He looked at Peter and Peter’s eyes burn with tears.
“Guys what the fuck ?! Why this seems so real ?! Why I feel like this is happening and I’m a soul so you can’t see me or hear me !” Tony said sitting beside Loki .
after hours Bruce dragged him out of the lab cause Bruce was hungry and Tony told him to go but Bruce insisted that Tony will come with him .
He missed Steve . His smile, His early morning routine, even when he fights with Tony and tells him he is not strong and he is not a hero.
And when he fucked him Tony was pleading that Steve will turn him to face him and Tell Tony how much he loves him but Steve just Kept fucking him hard and not caring if he’s hurting Tony
Guys I wanna say that I’m only 15 years old . The English is not my main language. In our country we don’t read the english as an important lesson. So I’m still reading and learning it by myself. I don’t use a translator as I said I’m writing it by myself. I’m really sorry about that guys don’t hate me .
Wanda screamed at what she saw. And everyone was shocked. Natasha’s tears were falling. Bruce, Thor and Loki had seen this before but not that much of blood.
It was 4am and he wanted to eat something so he decided to go out and eat. He closed the lab behind him and when he entered the kitchen, he opened the fridge door and kept searching for his favorites. Thanks to god Steve made Tony's favorite food and kept it for him 'Like he knows that Tony will come and eat something.' Tony smiled and pulled the food out and put it in the microwave.
“We don’t care about you and about the love of your life like we can’t lose all people because of you ! Steve there’s more than one bomb and only you can stop everything!” Natasha snapped at him and he sighed
“Hey Tony. what’s with your chest, Frankenstein?” Tony chocked and then chuckled. He wasn’t expecting that.
Peter kept crying between Thor’s arms until he passed out. Thor picked him up and walked towards the elevator, he puts the kid in his bed and kissed him on his forhead. The kid was breathing heavily and his expressions was pained, What happened to him? If he saw the one who damaged his kid then He’ll make sure to kill him and let him suffer. He kissed Peter’s forhead again and whispered “Peter you’re not alone, I’m not going to let you through this alone.” And like that he went out and closed the door behind him.
Howard was telling him to do things and if Tony failed with doing one thing then that’s mean he’ll sleep out in the coldness, bleeding and hungry.
slap after slap after kick in his stomach after back hand slap after punch after kick again and what's leads to many kicks. After that he was being hit by harness.
His eyes start to blur and the last thing he saw was Sharon crouching beside him. She was smirking and the other Hydra soldiers were taking their positions.
“I’m staying here . And if I hear anyone saying something bad to Tony I’ll make sure to kill him . understood?” Bucky asked and they nodded he smiled and left them .
He wish the time gets back just to kiss that beautiful neck . Just to mark Tony and tell everyone that he’s already taken.
Tony under him shaking and Steve wasn’t shaking instead he felt so warm that he just wanted to kiss Tony over and over again, but Tony gets away from him and start wearing his clothes he smiled to Steve and Steve was looking at him.
He found Thor , Bruce and Loki sitting together and it’s look like they’re arguing with Natasha and Clint.
“What if something happened to him ?!” Steve asked again and Bucky tried to speak but Steve shut him up.
“I’m a monster now because of you. If only you treated me right I’d never be like that and here. Mom you know what Natasha said to me? She said that she doesn’t care about me and I thought that she’s the only one who cares about me.” He chuckled and his chuckle pained his own heart. He sighed and throw the bottle on the picture.
“You’re a Doctor, you’ve had saved a lot of people without expecting any money from anyone. Hulk is good, he is a hero just like you. He saved a lot of innocent souls and he did the same thing you did, he wasn’t expecting anything for return. You’re not a monster Bruce. Hulk is not a monster. You’re an angel from the sky. It’s ok if you don’t believe m–” Bruce cuts him with a kiss, he was so grateful to hear something like that.
He go down to the bar and he looked at all the whiskey bottles and he felt like he really needed to get himself a drink.
He couldn't forget the way Tony looked at him, he was so hurt just as same the way after Ultron. He should probably fix this shit.  After all it was Loki's fault! He stayed in his bed for hours until he wakes up feeling something is so horrible about to happen. He couldn't call for anyone cause all he can see is a red glowing lights filling the room.
“I’m sorry guys. I’m really sorry about what happened back there. I overreacted and I regret it. So maybe you can forgive me so we can live just like we were before?” He asked and regret it when Wanda snapped at him.
Just when he was about to enter the room Tony was getting out . They kept looking at eachother . Steve can see how Tony’s face was pale and so tired.
“Enough, I'm fine . It’s okay." Despite Tony 's smile they know he' s not okay and that’s just his fake smile.
“Tony if you’re strong then I’ll tell you that I’m not strong. I need to revenge, please?!” Steve pulled Tony’s elbow softly so now they were facing each other. Tony knows that they will do anything to make him feel safe again, but he’s better than this. He’s stronger than this.
“S-Steve ? What are you doing?!” Tony was shaking but Steve will make it clear to Tony that Tony is one of his properties.
Are they going to break up ?  The story of their love was just a lie ? Steve is going to give up on him ? No , this can’t be real . The last time someone give up on him when he go to Afghanestan and it end up to him being near to death . His worst nightmare is there . And Titan of course. The first and last time Steve give up on him was in Seberia but now for Sharon ? Seriously?
"You think that's it's all about you right? But no believe me we don't care about you and we told you to take Bruce and leave not because you're injured... No it's because you'll slow us down and that's the last thing we wanted." Tony's head turned to look at Natasha while she spoke and he doesn't want to believe that's coming out of her.
“I tried to do everything to make you proud of me, but.... But you were never proud of me. You know what? They hurt me when they talk about you in a bad way, I can’t control myself because I know it’s truth that you are not the best mom or the best person. In the end I feel jealous of them when they talk about their parents.” He took another bottle and sit on the floor in front of the picture.
He knows that Steve will ignore him or maybe even kill him to stop the war that Tony knows will happen soon .
“Mr Stark, please talk to me! Don’t leave me behind you! Please!” The kid kept sobbing and Pepper starts crying too. Rhodey left the place and punched the wall once he was out of the room.
He rememberes telling them that it’s ok it was just a scratch, but the truth is it was a deep cuts on his wrists. Then after that he told them to leave him alone cause he needed some time alone and they did.
They get in the room no one saying anything, but Natasha is throwing glances to him every now and then.
“Ouch ! But I wanna see what’s under this towel!” Loki said and giggled once he saw All of Tony is red .
Tony stood and slapped him, Peter immediately fall to the floor. He looked at Tony and he doesn't want to believe what's going on with them.
He felt a hand pressing on his forehead, he flinched at first, but when he noticed it was metal. He opened his eyes, cause of course he's safe! Bucky is here to save the day.
"Now I'm going back to work. If you need me just call me and I'll be here." Peter nodded again and kissed Stephan's palm.
“Tony what’s wrong in what you were dreaming?” Steve asked but Tony shaked his head and kissed Steve’s hand again
They kept kissing each other and they both were hard but Tony was the first one to be hard of course.
“Sir I’m afraid that we can’t answer you. Peter told us to delete what happened in the past month.” With what Jarvis said everyone was shocked.
He looked at the blades that he was making for the Black widow and use it to cut his wrists. He cuts it again and then again and then again.
Clint saying mean words to him, that’s wasn’t new at all. And the man who called himself Antman was  horrible, he told them to never trust Stark men.
If Tony’s dead then he’ll kill him self. He can’t imagine doing that to Tony, the nicest person he ever seen. He gave them a home, he fed them, he gave them the warmth they’ve been missing and yet what did they give him in return? Nothing.
He fall to his knees and covered his ears with his hands. “STOP IT PLEASE! TURN IT OFF PLEASE!” He kept pleading them and they were only looking at him with disgust.
“Pete? What happened? Did someone hurts ya when you were patrolling?” Bucky asked him and start moving towards him.
“Woah ! Tony you’re so lucky !” Sam said grinning and Tony look at Steve who was holding Sharon and smiling to her .
“You’re going to push Stark away from you cause we all know that he doesn’t like to share you even when it’s a mission!” Nick said and Steve can feel his heart is aching but he nodded again .
“No, d-don’t. Leave him.” They all can see how weak he’s now, and then Tony came and he was so angry they all can notice that.
suddenly feeling like he wants to say the words Steve told him to Sharon cause he knows that he doesn’t deserve someone treating him like Steve was.
God, help him. There's no way his parents are going to find him. Especially when his dad's in the hospital. Is he ok?
Steve took a step forward to them and he felt his heart is broken. Maybe Tony wants to stay with Thor ? But , yet he can’t lose Tony .
Peter was still a sleep wich is weird, and the winter soldier is calm. Maybe he's under control again. Peter was tide to the chair and looking very peaceful.
“Look I will talk with the rest of the avengers and we will make sure to keep him away from you and we will keep him distracted “ Natasha said and Steve sighed im relief .
He entered the car and it was hurting him seeing his father controlling him and he was just like a doll in his parents’s hands .
Tony pressed their lips together again, trying to distract him, shifting his hips to bring them together. He felt a tell-tale weight against his thigh and moved his leg teasingly to rub against it.
“This is the problem with having such a big brain like you do: too much room for brooding instead of talking to me.”
He wished again that Steve was there - for all he didn't blame him that sometimes he had to go away for work. But why did he have to go away now?
“Welcome to Chez Rogers,” Steve announced, and then cringed. “Sorry that was cringe. Um, let me go get a blanket, we can eat out here.”
had delivered them the news earlier in the week, to give them a reason to train harder. He also had a suspicion that there was the hope of offspring that could be trained for the
“I grow tired of waiting, Tony,” Pierce drawled, and Tony felt the henchman’s gun thud into his kidney, forcing him to his knees. Ow.
He kissed her forehead before pulling away. “You need anything, you know your Pops and me will be on a plane in an instant.”
, Steve. I couldn’t keep doing it after that.” He tugged at his sleeve. “And I found out he planned to have me killed. The man was more of a father to me than Howard, and he-- Well, he’s in prison now. Nothing more to be done.”
“It was so kind of the deputy to assist you in such an intimate moment,” Mr Murphy commented, casually brushing non-existent dust from his sleeve. The man wasn’t even trying to be subtle, the damn snake.
He grunted as he hit a sudden uneven patch of ground and his ankle gave way, sending him sprawling into the wet undergrowth. It felt like his whole ankle was on fire and he was afraid to touch it, wary of the pain. He tried to push himself back up but it was no use, the injury meant his right foot couldn’t hold his weight.
“Excuse me a moment, Deputy, I need to identify the weak spots.” Tony tried to lean underneath but grunted as the corset dug in and kept him upright. “This awful thing!” He looked over to Deputy Barnes. He tugged his shirt free of his trousers. “Deputy, you got a knife?”
“The mattress is fine,” Maria said, dropping onto it. “Look nice and comfy and no bedbugs in sight.”
“Vision’s trapped, Deputy,” the alpha said, sounding more and more upset. “He’s trapped, I can’t get him out.” There was a lilt to her accent Tony wasn’t familiar with, and it thickened the more desperate she got.
Steve had sent him ahead to bed while he checked the horse, and he readied himself as he had yesterday, prepared for another try.
“No he didn’t, because he’s too nice and instead gave me some berries he’d picked which was actually worse! He said he was worried I wasn’t getting enough to eat. He’s being very generous letting me work there, and then my two terrors come leaping around his smithy, bouncing off the walls and climbing everything.”
farm. Our uncle is a scientist. He uses the space for his experiments and study, and Jane and I help him out.”
As the seasons changed, training got harder. They needed to be ready to put on a good show and Fury was putting them through their paces. Stíofán wandered back after a long day of training to the kitchens for dinner but frowned when he didn’t find Tony there. He ate his portion quickly, before heading to their room. He opened the door to find Tony curled up on their pallet, looking pale.
“You want to test that?” Tony asked, crawling up Stíofán’s chest to stare down at him, still the most beautiful thing Stíofán has ever seen. “You, trying to swallow lumpy cold mush while the twins and I shovel down lovely hot food, all silky smooth, chasing away the winter chill. Maybe we’ll have a little honey in ours but you, sir, will miss out.”
He saw Clint wince, and he had a feeling there was probably more truth to that than he wanted to admit.
One day he’d return home, leaving the heaving, stinking, filthy city of Rome behind, and return to the rolling hills of his home, Hibernia to the Romans,
Suddenly, strong hands caught his arm, another coming around to wrap tight around his waist, and for a moment he thought it must be Steve, and the relief sparked through him. He turned to greet his husband, but the words caught in his throat as he was swamped in disappointment.
Tony felt his face flame even as a laugh burst out of his chest. “Sheriff, you are the most ridiculous alpha I have ever met. Stop messing around and get back to business.”
He grunted as his stomach hit the saddle, and he felt Hodge's hand on his back to steady him. Then he felt the hand drift south, cupping his behind ,and Tony squawked in anger, kicking his leg to try to dislodge the touch.
But it had still taken more than a year and a half and five heats for Peter to come, and Tony wasn't too proud to say that he'd been getting worried.
Steve relaxed beneath his hands and nodded, his features hard to see in the dark. “Ok, yeah. You got it. Fun.”
Fury hummed. “Well, you’re certainly welcome to do so. I’d appreciate it since no one else has and I don’t wish to be the only
“We’re free,” Stíofán said, and it felt so strange to say it out loud. “Tony, we did it. We’re free.”
The rest of the meeting went well, Steve stealing glances at him the whole time as they discussed the project. By the end, it was clear Pepper was sure he was right for the role, and she offered it to him after Tony gave her their subtle signal for agreement.
Tony fell back into his seat, glancing around nervously. The people who had clearly been side-eying the outburst looked away and Tony groaned.
He wasn’t sure why he was thinking about it. It was a simple misunderstanding, no further action needed to be taken.
Pierce grabbed Tony’s tie in his hand, dragging him to his feet. Tony really wished he wasn’t wearing the one Steve had given him: Pierce was getting it all wrinkled.
“Oh, I’ll miss you too.” She gave him another tight squeeze before she pulled away, dabbing her eyes with her handkerchief. “But come, I’ve taken up too much of your time, and you need to pack. Jarvis is taking you in the morning?”
He suspected any day now, Mr Rogers would come to his study, not to take tea with him as he looked forward to everyday, but tell him he had accepted a proposal and would be taking his leave.
“What in god’s name is going on back here?” Steve thundered as he followed the sound of gunshots around the back of the office. “I thought I said-”
He ordered another two drinks and turned, stopping short when he realised he recognised the man next to him. “Mr B— Bucky, nice to see you.”
What should he say? Was it better to lie, lest they think him undefended, or would the truth make them leave?
“I’m Steve,” Steve said, a wide grin taking over his face. He looked over at the counter where a woman with red hair was watching them with wide eyes. She caught Steve’s eyes and grinned, tipping her head towards the door.
And then he’d been...well, forward was an understatement. But it had felt right in the moment, and when he’d shown Ana she’d given him a smile and said she thought it was perfect.
He wondered what Pepper would make of his life here if she could see it for herself. He was sure Ana would love it, and no doubt she would be smug as anything that she had been right about him coming here. Jarvis would be horrified at the lack of propriety, while being secretly proud.
There was something of an afternoon rush, and at one point Steve thought he should go. He didn’t work here and he was just in the way. And really, getting a room sooner rather than later would be sensible.
“Sounds good to me. Hell, you beat me to the punch, I had a whole plan where I was going to show you the sketches I’d done of you at the fair.”
Steve looked over both shoulders to check no one was watching, then, forgoing the jack, lifted the car with one hand so he could use the other to undo the bolts, remove the punctured tyre and put on the new one. His super-hearing caught the sound of footsteps from inside the house and he quickly lowered the car down, grabbing the jack like he had just finished with it.
“That’s very kind,” Rogers said to her, cheeks tinged pink. “I’m proud of my art, hopefully I’ll have a show of my own someday.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Alright that’s it, out. We’re busy trying to spread the joy of reading. Move your ass out of here.” He shooed her, Darcy laughing when she dodged his playful swatting. It was clear they cared about each other, just having fun at work like it was any other day.
“No thank you. I’m waiting for my fiancé.” It felt odd to say the words out loud, but that’s what Mr Rogers was.
Tony blinked and then laughed, the sound building deep in his chest and forcing its way out in this wave of relief and surprise. There were tears in his eyes as he laughed, and Steve’s face blurred, even as his horror turned into a scowl.
He dragged Tony to the furthest point of the room, and Tony caught Pepper’s worried gaze before they stepped behind a low divider wall and the rest of his employees were out of view. The room was quiet as they waited, and then there was a thud against the outer door. A few people screamed, the guard barking at them to stay quiet. Pierce held his breath to see if the door would withstand the assault. The door shuddered as something knocked against it a few times, but the heavy furniture in front of it kept it on its hinges.
He looked up at the Sheriff, who was frozen in the doorway. Tony was pretty sure he was going to cry.
The alpha swung again, the noise echoing in the room. Loud enough to be heard outside, Tony realised.
He walked around the homestead, opening the windows and letting the fresh air in. Ventilation accomplished. That wasn’t so hard.
Tony studied his manual vigorously and managed to write up a schedule to stay on top of it that he hung on the wall of the kitchen. It cut down on the work he had to do since he could just look at his chores each morning and get started. The wife of the General Store owner was also very kind, and when he and Steve had gone to shop, she’d told him she knew what it was like as a newlywed and written out a few of her easiest recipes for him to try. They made a world of difference: clear instructions, and she’d made sure he had the ingredients too when Steve had asked for their order.
“Well no matter. I think I can assist nonetheless.” And that was all the warning Steve got before he was scooped up like a babe, his head coming to rest against the warmth of Mr Stark’s shoulder, securely held in his arms.
Tony’s face scrunched in disgust. “Hodge? What in god’s name does he have to do with it? I want my husband to make love to me. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.”
“I know.” He pulled her into an embrace, trying to hold off the tears that desperately wanted to escape. He’d made this decision. It was the right decision, he was sure of it, but it didn’t make it any easier. “I’ll miss you.”
“Oh, Mr Rogers,” a familiar voice behind them said, and Tony just about groaned. “I think you dropped something.”
Mr Stark had asked him to a dance, not one but two, ahead of all the other options. When they touched, he’d felt the soft calluses he knew were from repairing equipment for the tenants, a reminder of the man’s kind heart, and the heat from his hand had been like a brand against Steve’s own. They danced in the line, coming together and separating, but intertwined as if drawn together again every time.
Both men smiled. Rhodey clapped him on the shoulder. “Perfect. Tell you what, Sam can watch the counter for a bit while you and I go look over your room, and then you can give me a hand with the evening rush till dinner.”
An explosion rocked the building, and there were shouts and screams from the guests. Pierce’s head whipped around, his grin manic.
Stíofán’s eyebrows rose to his hairline. “Tony, you can’t just take up metalwork with no training, that’s insane.”
There was a pause, and then when Rhodey spoke again, he was all business. “Ok, don’t panic, here’s what you’re going to do. Go back in there, grab the worst stuff. Don’t worry about the comic books, but try and hide anything where he looks like he’s only wearing lycra.”
“We would, of course, ask you Commander Stark,” the Chancellor said, looking apologetic. “But we wouldn’t want to disrespect Commander S’Teve.”
“You’ve been here three minutes and you’re already giving my child weapons.,” a loud familiar voice said coming up behind her. “Why do I invite you people again?”
They wandered the streets looking for a cafe or a supermarket. As they turned a corner, they passed an alley that Tony would’ve walked past without notice, if it weren’t for the thud and sound of metal hitting pavement.
“What is up with you?!” Tony snapped, throwing his hands in the air. “You’re unfocused, you didn’t care about the warp drive -- you love hearing about how I increase efficiency! -- and you’re all twitchy. Well no, not twitchy, more like the opposite; you’re so still it’s like you’re a piece of furniture.”
Tony rubbed a hand over his beard. “Not in a long time, no. I was somewhat of a rake in my youth, though that all stopped once I met my dearly departed wife.”
Maybe-George huffed, tossing a few bills on the table. “Should’ve known. Everyone always says they don’t give a fuck but they always do. You can pretend all you like, but deep down you’re waiting aren’t you? Waiting to hear those magic words? It’s pathetic.”
Steve looked up at him. “You saved me.” His voice sounded surprised, almost wondrous and Tony scowled.
By the time it was getting late, Tony had several book recommendations and an invitation to see Miss Foster's telescope as soon as Steve could take him out to visit. He went to find the Sheriff with a bounce in his step.
“Are you like some rich dick who thinks you’re better than everyone? Is that it? Like a little lord or something?”
“He’d love to!” Sam’s voice behind him said, a hand clapping down on his shoulder. Tony looked at him, betrayed, even as Steve grinned wide.
Stíofán nodded with a smile which Tony returned. They sat staring for a moment before Tony shivered, and Stíofán realised he was probably not as warm as he’d been. He grabbed the blanket from his pallet and wrapped it around the faun, pleased when it got him a grateful smile.
Tony cast one last longing look at his charge before he took off, watching as JARVIS activated his targeted missiles on the HUD. “You better protect him with your life!”
That earned him a happy kiss, and Tony smiled into it, peppering his alpha’s jaw and neck with them. Eventually, though, he wanted more, and he lifted his hips to slide against Steve’s making them both shudder.
“Come on man, it’s Christmas Eve. We can’t even get water? Where’s your Christmas spirit? Your heart shrink three sizes or what?”
A few weeks later he took Steve on a surprise trip to his house in Hawaii, kissing him beneath the palms, as the soft sound of the waves crashed on the shore like a lullaby.
Stíofán felt as though his heart might explode and he clutched Tony to him, pressing kisses along his hair and pointed ears.
It was a large canvas, a portrait of a woman, a nurse. She looked tired, but strong, beautiful even as she treated a patient whose face was hidden from sight. Tony didn’t usually think much of art other than ‘that’s cool’ or ‘Just no’, but this was...arresting. Tony stood in front of it, captivated.
Stíofán was confused by the sudden change in topic, but Tony sitting snuggly against him was doing wonders. He slipped his hands under Tony’s thighs and lifted him up, pulling him tight against him as he stood.
He wanted his soulmate. No matter how much he denied it, thought he could settle, he wanted that. He wanted to have someone look at him and know, no matter what, that they were his.
He’d dutifully cleaned up and thought about going out to face everyone, but at the last minute decided he couldn’t handle it.
He managed to hide his disappointment when all he got was an affectionate brush of lips across his knuckles.
The superhero had popped back up a few months back, joining the Avengers team in a very publicised move. The details were a little hazy, but apparently he was the real McCoy, flash frozen in the 40s and thawed to fight crime. He was a natural leader, spoke out on social justice, and could pack a punch. Tony had to admit, he watched the fight longer than he meant to, fascinated by the way the Captain moved, his tall, strong form still somehow so graceful.
Tony walked down the street, trying to ignore the curious eyes following him. He was carrying the basket with Steve’s dinner in it, hurrying along to keep the bread warm.
Stíofán upped the speed of his hand, burying his face between the furred cheeks and trying his utmost to drive the doe wild.
“It’s a long journey to California.” Pepper grabbed a pair of his finest boots and added them to the pile. “Are you sure you’ll be alright, travelling alone?”
The first fifty miles speeding down the highway may not have fixed everything, but it was still the best he’d felt since he’d woken up.
Stíofán gave his hips a buck, making Tony drop his hands to Stíofán’s chest to keep his balance. “Can you?”
“You come first,” Steve told him. “You and Peter. I may have to be the peacekeeper but that doesn’t mean I won’t do anything to keep you two safe.”
Steve wasn’t quite sure what that meant, but he could sort of guess from context. “I didn’t used to look like this. I was pretty small and they never really paid much attention to me. Then I was overseas so didn’t really get the chance.” That was probably too much information. He reluctantly cleared his throat. “I guess I should really head over to the motel; It’s getting late.”
Steve was confused, but then realised what Rhodey thought was happening. “No, I know.” And he almost wished he was having a flashback, because that sound, that sound was worse. That sound meant he--
“I didn’t hate that you were in the army,” Tony denied. “I hated that you wanted to sign up for another tour when Bucky had already lost his arm and you’d only just recovered from the explosion. I hated worrying about you.”
“Mr Rogers, please. I am all for propriety, but I think we may suspend it so that I might save you from perishing in this awful weather, don’t you?”
“Ow,” Jarvis meeped from somewhere around his chest, though Tony knew he’d been protected from the fall. “That could’ve gone better.”
“I would. Unless you do your duty.” He thrust his hips against Stíofán’s belly. “Come on, my big, strong buck.”
If he were not a Vulcan, what he did might be described as running away. However, since he was, it would better be described as a retreat.
“Not before the kid gets here. And once they’re here, they’ll be trapped just like us. Kids born to slaves become slaves. Our only chance is to get out before anyone notices you’re carrying.” He gestured around the room. “I don’t want this for them.”
Steve’s eyes flitted down to watch it, a slight pink tinge to his cheeks. Tony opened his mouth to say something, anything--
And that wasn’t fair Tony thought. Because that made him think things. He searched for something to say, but Steve jumped in.
Tony pulled on the worn linen, grabbing one of the ties from his silks to cinch the waist. It was a little short, but not immodest.
Tony stretched, feeling the satisfying pull of slightly sore muscles. The room was filled with the soft light peeking through the blinds and he turned his head watching Steve fondly. He had long, long lashes and his hair, golden in the early light, flopped over his face. For a soldier, he sure slept deeply, Rhodey still woke on a dime, and he’d left the Air Force a year ago.  Maybe, Steve would like to hang around. Tony knew a place that made the best pancakes, and he was pretty sure Steve was a diner kind of guy. He leaned back, settling against the pillows. Yeah, when Steve woke up he’d--
He realised Tony had finished speaking and was looking at him expectantly. “That’s great. That you get to do what makes you happy.”
Steve shook his head. “No, it’s fine. And he sent me the address of a motel in town so I can get a room.”
The old Bucky would’ve died laughing, bent over unable to breathe. But this Bucky, still coming to terms with his time as the Winter Soldier, merely twitched the corner of his mouth. “That’s what I thought you said.”
More than two months late, Tony fretted as he walked towards the doctor’s office. He’d been fairly regular since he and Steve had bonded. He was pretty sure their last heat hadn’t been successful. It was almost four months ago, and he’d have noticed a change by now.
Stíofán burst out laughing, Tony doing the same. He wrapped his arms around Tony holding him close and kissing him deeply. If this was to be his last night, then he shouldn’t spend it wallowing.
Steve’s heart had been fluttering the whole time, taking in the grace and strength of Mr Stark’s body when he moved, the sparkle in his fine brown eyes and the pleasure he seemed to take in their dance.
The man in blue pulled out a communicator from his belt. “Building’s clear. Rescue team can enter. Turn the power back on.”
“Tony,” Stíofán said, lowering them down to their mat and pulling up the blanket. “Don’t get into trouble, it’s not just you anymore.” He let his hand rest on Tony’s belly. “I don’t know what would happen if you got on someone’s bad side.”
“I’m sure Somhairle will be as smitten with Bucky as he was at the festival, house or no house,” Tony said, squeezing him a little tighter. “But your doe will be in a huff, and really, what is your priority?”
“I think it might just be,” Tony said, still sounding awed. “Oh gods, if it’s still here then I have to meet your clan.”
He cursed not being taught anything about practical housekeeping (his upbringing geared towards the different skills needed to be a society spouse with servants), but he’d be damned if he couldn’t work it out. He had the book Ana had given him tucked away in his bag, that she’d said would help him learn the ropes. He’d show the alpha that it wasn’t a mistake bringing him here, or he would die trying.
The sucking resumed, a clever tongue running up and down the sensitive skin, and Tony moaned, letting the sound break free without any shame. If his alpha wanted it, then by God he could have it.
“Well, maybe if you looked like this handsome hunk here, I’d be more inclined,” Darcy told him, poking her tongue out at him. Steve felt the heat rush to his face.
Tony wanted to reply but the signal turned green and he and Steve crossed different ways until they were opposite again.
At the round of ‘No’s’ she nodded. “Alright, stop hitting each other and go back to your tables or I will throw you all out on your asses. Everyone here needs to buy another drink to make up for the emotional distress I’ve been put through.”
There was a flash of Tony, curled up on his couch back at the apartment gesturing at the TV as he got more and more worked up, and Steve felt the curve of a smile before he pushed it back down. Focus. He needed to focus.
in his voice and Stíofán nudged him. “None of that. I don’t know what happens if you do that when you’re this size, let alone if you do it off a donkey.”
It was the first dinner they had together, but as things turned out, it wouldn’t be the last. Steve had naturally loved the wagu - before having a mild heart attack when he’d googled it and seen the price -  but Tony had realised pretty fast Steve was more of a beer-and-burgers guy, and thankfully that suited Tony to a tee. They still tried new things, of course - Steve had a surprising lack of experience with different cuisines - but Tony’s favourite times were the relaxed and casual atmosphere of a diner as Steve wolfed back more fries than seemed possible for someone his size.
Tony had watched him as he’d tidied up. His tall, well-built alpha with those strong shoulders and muscled arms, ready and able to tear Hodge apart for so much as looking at Tony wrong. There was a heat in his belly: it felt almost primal. He was in love with Steve, with his good humour, his kindness, and his sweetness. That wasn’t in question. But now he needed more.
“No,” Steve breathed, and it was so clearly a lie that Tony had to test it. He let his fingers dance lightly over Steve’s ribs, satisfied when he yelped.
He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and passed a hand over the other side of the bed, finding it cold.
He held Peter close through the shivers, the pup waking up once or twice as they waited for morning.
“You do not,” Rhodey said, coming from out back. “But maybe this time you were right. You got a bit of colour back in your cheeks, Tones. I assume it went well?”
Maria nodded. She knew the story. She knew that getting pregnant, with twins no less, had been hard on Dad at first. And half the town had told her how he and Pops had danced around each other for the better part of a year before they got together.
Steve finished tying the hands of the man on the ground, deftly securing the knot. He was bursting with energy now, the adrenaline of the fight racing through his body, and the knowledge that now they could be on their way home.
His omega instincts were overwhelmed at the sight of Tony, an attractive, compatible alpha, coming to his aid and protecting him from harm. He didn’t know why it was different here, he and Tony fought alongside each other all the time and it hardly garnered this kind of response, but something about the lack of the fight, a normal situation where Tony had done it simply because he wanted to rescue Steve, made it undeniably sexy.
“I know, I just need a shower – five minutes.” He didn’t look like he usually did post-run. Hardly sweaty at all. But whatever, she just needed him to get ready.
Mr Barton, “call me Clint,” let him ride up top when they tested it, and ended up taking him on a tour around the farm. He wasn’t much older than Tony, and it turned out they had a very similar sense of humour.
He was still staring at them when Steve returned, the smile on his thin face dropping as he went pale at the sight of the papers in Tony’s hand. “I can explain!”
“Course,” the Sheriff followed him out, telling the deputies he’d return shortly, and they stepped onto the porch of the saloon, Tony placing the lamp on the railing with a thud.
Steve shook his head. “Nah, it’s ok. Looks worse than it feels. Let’s not miss our date - if you don’t mind getting lunch with a guy who looks like he just had his clock cleaned.”
To say that Tony had a relaxing night sleep lying up against the hot, smooth muscles brushing against his back would be a lie, but to say he spent the night warm and aptly covered by both quilt and alpha would do just fine.
At one point, however, Tony realised that the pup’s skin seemed to be getting darker. He frowned, pulling back the collar of his nightgown to reveal...a rash.
“How lovely,” Tony said, sort of meaning it. It had to be tough carrying a pup out here, and it was sweet that the other omegas could help out and ease the burden a little. “Well, please, if there’s anything she needs, let me know. I’d be happy to contribute.”
The door slammed open as the two deputies tumbled in laughing at some joke. Then both immediately froze.
“Yes of course. It’s not official yet, i didn’t mean to assume. Anyway I shall send someone to the village for him. Let me--”
He pulled Tony into the curve of his body, wrapping his arms around him tight. “You did so good. I’m so proud of you.”
“Clothes, check, toolbox, check, money…I think that’s it.” He looked around the room. “Jarvis, anything else?”
“You could have a real future in motivational speaking, you know that?” Steve grumbled but took a deep breath. “Maybe I should try the French maid outfit? It’s one of Tony’s ‘growing-up-rich’ teen fantasies.”
Jarvis placed a paw on his wrist. “It’s ok. We can get a new one. What’s important is it’s the broom not your leg.”
He slipped under the quilt, and Tony could feel the heat coming off him almost at once. They sat in silence for a moment, and Tony tried not to stare at the smooth chest beside him.
“So,” Tony said, still clinging to him, the joy he was feeling almost addictive. “I assume I should refrain from matchmaking ceremonies on missions from now on?”
There was a hot angry fire in his chest, and Steve could barely speak. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
“I don’t think that will be a problem for us, but thank you for your concern. Anyway, I must go. I’d hate for his meal to go cold while I’ve been standing around gabbing. You Om’s have a nice day.”
Stíofán breathed deep as they came over the rise of the hill, the village down below. It looked just as he’d remembered it, just as lively and welcoming as when he’d waved goodbye that final time.
He was cute, Tony thought, really cute. Pretty blue eyes, soft blond hair and his smile. His smile made him light up, and Tony had the thought that he liked being the cause of it.
That sanctimonious prick. After all the shit he gave Tony about keeping even a sliver of hope of finding his soulmate and there he was strolling around still wearing the faintest post-meet glow.
Steve grit his teeth as he slowly made his way back. The rain had started to fall now, heavy and cold, and he felt the shivers wrack his body. He hated it, the feeling like that of when he was a child, ill with fever and shakes, his mother unsure if he’d live to see the dawn. He didn’t get so sick as often now, though when he did he was usually down for a few days. He cursed as he thought of how to explain to Mr Stark that he’d gotten ill from his own foolishness and Peter’s lessons would no doubt have to be delayed.
“Why? You’re ill. You’ve been ill for two weeks.” Already his cheeks were getting more prominent, the weight he’d been putting on starting to slip away.
Well, if the man wasn’t a homicidal maniac, Tony supposed that might be a compliment. But there was no way he was doing that.
“No, it’s not your fault. I gave you every reason to doubt. But when I heard you were in trouble, I couldn’t stay away.” Steve looked at him, eyes serious. “Fury didn’t even try. He knew I’d come anyway.”
Pierce was fighting hard, sweat already forming on his skin. He tried to land blows against the other man, but each was blocked. Now that Tony could see a little better, he could see the white of a tank top, dark with dried blood, and thick blue pants and combat boots. The man’s face was hidden by a cowl, eyes shielded in the shadows caused by the moonlight streaming in.
His Ma huffed. “You're as bad as your father was when he was a kid. He always used to run away when it was time for his bath.”
“Nice to meet you.” Steve looked over to where Dodger had opted to hold onto the ball, a squeaking noise emitting from it every few seconds as Peter chased after him, giggles filling the air. “So I can’t help but notice you guys haven’t brought a dog to the dog park. You know that’s a kid, not a puppy right?”
And there, gathering berries with a group of satyrs, was a faun with Stíofán’s colouring. She looked up and their eyes met across the field. Stíofán raised his hand in greeting and her hands came up to cover her mouth. He could see the faintest shine of tears, but even before he’d finished realising that fact, she was rushing through the long grass towards him.
“Where are we going to get a cat with forty five minutes notice?” Tony rubbed a hand down his face in frustration, trying not to lose it.  “You know what? We’ll just go ahead. Cat or no cat.”
“Ugh,” Clint said, and Steve jumped slightly, having completely forgotten he was there. “You two are gross.”
Steve didn’t say anything more, just pushed back inside, and Tony sighed at the change in angle. The room filled with moans as Steve picked up the pace, balancing one hand on the headboard, the other on Tony’s waist to hold him in place.
The man huffed amused. “She has no concept of boundaries. What are you doing, cat? Getting your paws on him before we even know his name.”
the food as quickly as possible. You’ve seen me at my worst a hundred times over, a bit of skin ain’t going to drive you away.”
Tiberius jumped to his hooves, fuming, and stormed off clutching his bowl to his chest, while the other guys laughed at his retreating back.
Dad looked back at the letter and then back at her. “I mean sure, I mean you could’ve picked a nice Ivy league close to home, but yeah, on the other side of the country, hours away from your loving friends and family, that’s nice too.” He sounded out of breath and she was starting to worry he wasn’t getting enough air.
Antonius stared at him for a moment and then burst out laughing. “I’m glad you care so much about my charming personality.”
“Exactly,” Rhodey agreed, refusing to rise to the bait. “And if I knew I had to wait another ten, twenty, thirty years for Pepper and the girls, I’d wait happily.”
“Wow,” Tony managed as he stared out over it. This was what had excited him when he’d arrived, the sparkling blue and the crisp breezes. He let his eyes fall closed and baked in it, for just a moment.
“Goodnight my treasures.” Stíofán leaned down, kissing each horn and nose before tucking the furs beneath their chins as their eyes fluttered closed.
Fury pushed open the door to the cafe, his one eye scanning the room. “Nice place you found to hole up in Captain Rogers.”
“He’s been waiting to have a chance at me,” the grocer complained. “He never has a civil word for me whenever he comes in here. Ask anyone.”
They talked for a bit longer, Steve giving him recommendations of local shelters that Tony could take Peter to and the best ways to choose the right dog for them both.
Tony groaned because he understood that, loved that feeling of being Steve’s. And he knew how much he wanted that recognition in return.
They gathered the gear together and Steve managed to find a reason to send them both inside, feeling a little guilty for lying, before he checked for observers. He moved to the leaning side, and digging his feet in gave it a heavy shove with his shoulder. The sign post groaned as it straightened, the sign standing proudly again and Steve felt a small thrill at doing something useful. He quickly tied a rope between his bike and the post, revved his engine for effect, and when the two men came out, held out his arms in a ‘voila’ motion.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he breathed. His other hand flailed until he could grasp one of Antonius’ horns, pulling until the doe’s head was back, making his body tense and giving Stíofán more leverage. He released the tail so he could grab the other horn, and he put his back into it. He was slamming into the faun, Antonius making loud ‘ungh’ sounds with each push in, and Stíofán could feel himself getting closer and closer.
Tony managed a smile, still feeling a little raw. He was glad the oil lamps were low so his puffy face was less obvious. He took the bread Steve offered, layering it generously with the jam. He nibbled at it delicately, enjoying the sweet, sharp taste of the preserves.
“You’d already sacrificed enough! You had done your job, and you were still going to leave again. Where I would have to wait, praying I didn’t get that phone call, or end up standing next to your mom when she got handed a folded flag. She didn’t want you to go back either, but you were being so stubborn you wouldn’t listen to us.”
Something crashed into Tony’s side. “You saved him,” Wanda wrapped her arms around him tightly. “Thank you!”  She looked up at Steve and then back at Tony and flushed. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to get handsy.”
“I can take this home and meet you,” Steve offered, looking a little overwhelmed. “You don’t have to—“
Unable to turn down a request from him, Stíofán drove back in, harder and faster. The sounds of his hips slapping against Tony’s had to be audible to them by now, but they rounded the corner anyway, both surprised by what they saw. Stíofán reached around to wrap his hand around Tony’s cock even as he kept eye contact with the two bucks.
Steve shook his head. “She’s a nurse for an older gentleman up North. He’s only got a few years left, so when she’s no longer needed, she’ll retire and move here. But for now, we write often.”
The cheering was beginning to outweigh the angry shouts and Stíofán felt a boost of confidence. The two fighters circled him, and Stíofán parried one’s sword strikes, while he fended off the other with the shield. The other satyr caught him off guard with a wild jab, and for a moment Stíofán thought he might strike a lucky blow. But it glanced off his armour, slipping free. In the moment before the other gladiator could lift his again, Stíofán used the handle of his sword against his head, knocking him out deftly.
Steve slid off the couch and walked over to him, taking his hand. “Tony, I promise, it’s just work.”
The sheriff was very attractive. Tony had assumed as much with his clothes on, but now, seeing him bare, he was gorgeous. He had some scars, no doubt from fighting bandits and arresting criminals, but he had a strong muscled back and broad shoulders that curved down into a narrow waist. He looked powerful.
Stíofán felt like he was being very slow, though it was hard to think with the panic still subsiding. “I don’t--”
“I know, baby. You’re sick, but don’t you worry. When the sun comes up, Papa will be here, and he can go for the doctor to make you all better.”
Tony nodded, taking a shaky breath as he pushed to his feet and wiped tiny bits of plaster off his armor. “Right. Lead the way.”
“I see you’ve met,” Pepper said, the tone of her voice suggesting there’d be questions later. “In which case, we can get down to business.”
He pulled Tony tight against his chest, letting himself breathe in the scent of his hair and take in the feeling of having him safe and warm in his arms for a moment, and then he clicked his tongue, urging Nomad on towards home.
The storage attic was pretty basic. There was an old double bed with an elaborate metal frame, a small table and two chairs, a stool he could use as a bedside table, a little inner stairwell down to an outdoor sink and toilet, and a large old tub that Tony could fill and heat with magic for washing.
Bucky nodded. “Yeah the vet said she’d adapt, but you know,” he tapped his own prosthetic. “Mine’s pretty useful. I reckon she should get one too. We’ll be matching”
“No, I need-- Steve? Please? I can’t, my head’s so loud, and I need to stop thinking, just for a minute.” Tony kissed him again, and Steve let him, thumbs rubbing circles around his hipbones.
“How am I supposed to do my job now,” Steve panted, hips moving constantly, the slap of skin loud in the room. “Knowing I got this at home, huh? That I can come back and have you whenever I want.” He groaned. “Or wherever. God, number of times I had to excuse myself because I saw you bent over the stove, that pert behind on display, or those gorgeous lips wrapped around something.” He put both hands on Tony’s hips now, thrusting harder. “Number of times, I just wanted to bend you over the kitchen table, take you till you were near delirious with how good it felt. Or in the stable, you sitting atop me trying to keep your seat like I taught you.”
“So, you know what I do,” Steve offered, swiping the last of his bread through the gravy at the bottom of his bowl. “What things do you like? I know in your letters you said you liked sewing and baking. What sort of things do you like to make?”
Tony listened to the now familiar sounds of his alpha moving about the house - locking up, settling Oscar in his basket, and making sure the stove was secure.
Tony beamed, and Mr Murphy spluttered. “I get more and more eager to meet my dame-in-law every day.”
Then he had the torturous experience of watching a huge, handsome buff man read to his kid and wow, Tony thought he was too old for the butterflies-in-his-stomach kind of crush, but apparently not.
Eventually the supervillain was defeated, Cap leaping onto the hoverboard and crashing it into the roof of Oscorp Tower, with Spiderman webbing the green villain and lowering him to ground level to be taken in by the police.
Tony was. Ravenous in fact. He hadn’t eaten since the train, and though he’d been too nervous to notice up till now, the smell of the rich gravy and cooking meat made his hunger roar to life. He was dying to just shovel it back, but he could hear his mother’s stern voice in his ear telling him to make sure he was always omega-like when he sat or when he ate, and so he took small bites, trying not to seem too greedy.
“And I will be the size of fattened pig and you’ll have me at your mercy, is that it?” Tony purred. “Unable to do anything but lie here and wait for you to come home. Is that what you secretly wish?”
Steve felt the blood drain from his face. He released him, ignoring the yelp as the bandit hit the ground.
“Bruce says your heat was probably close and the stress of dealing with that asshat Bradbury triggered it. It wasn’t your fault.”
The alpha was panting heavily, the thrusts picking up speed but getting more uneven. There was a grunt, and the strongest thrust of all, and the sheriff relaxed atop him, his arm holding his weight so as not to crush him.
Tony looked around. “I need a few things. We’re going to need a strong horse and some ropes, a sheet pan, and someone needs to go to the apothecary and get me some? oleic acid, some water, and an empty jar.” He looked around at the crowd. “Hurry!”
Tony walked over to the desk he gestured to, taking a seat and placing the basket carefully on the top.
“My thanks,” Vision offered breathlessly, an English accent detectable even in the weakness of his voice. “Terrible way to go otherwise.”
“Everyone take cover!” He shouted into the comms as he lined up the shot. “Cap, you good? Is Planty -”
Tony felt his heart pick up speed when a smile slowly spread across Steve’s face. “Yeah, I guess so.”
Tony shook his head. “Not specifically. But how it all fits together, those connections? My magic makes me understand it. I can…
Tony supposed in hindsight that he’d gotten used to Steve being fine. He’d gone on one or two more raids since their argument over the first one, and each time Steve came home without anything more than a few bruises or sore muscles from the long ride.
He was wet through, and tired from trying to walk back, his ankle starting to swell. There was nothing he could do but stay there, hoping the bone-tired feeling might pass and he could try again.
Speaking of, he felt the brush of a hand at his knee, and his gown was rucked up, exposing him, and he felt the flush spread from his face to his chest. “Oh!”
He’d changed trains at Sacramento, taking the smaller line to Brooklyn Junction, where he hoped there’d be someone waiting to pick him up. God, please let someone be there to pick him up.
But he couldn’t. All he could remember was the humiliation of past betrayals and the urge to protect himself overtook him. He fled for the workshop, staying there for several hours until JARVIS gave him the all-clear.
Steve stood up, scooping Tony into his arms in one smooth move. He grabbed a sheet of paper and scribbled something on it. “Sam’ll be here in ten. I think I can slip out without causing too much fuss.”
He brought back the little ball of brown and white fur and presented him to Tony with an air of long-suffering. “I got you a wedding gift.”
“Don’t make a peep now,” Steve said. There was a swish, and Tony tensed. But when the loud crack sounded, he felt no pain. His eyes shot open, and he looked down to see the leather had slapped not his skin, but the pale line of Steve’s forearm.
Jarvis jumped off the bed and trotted over to a small pile of items. “My collar for identification, my blanket for sleeping and of course, my squeaky mouse. All accounted for.”
Tony looked angry now. “My love life is no one else’s business, but I assure you if it became a problem, I would report it to the Captain, as is required.”
He grabbed for Tony, clearly forgetting for a moment where they were and leaned too far, making Tony jump forward to grab him, his hands twisted in Steve’s leather jacket. “Be careful!”
He let the tears fall in the privacy of the room, using a damp rag to clean himself as best he could. He tore off his soiled clothes and pulled on his nightgown. He buried himself under the covers and cried till his head hurt and he was all out of tears. He was messing everything up already. He missed Jarvis. And Ana and Pepper. Even his mother. What had he been thinking coming out here?
“Sounds lovely.” He tried to think of what else to talk about. “So, what is it going to be like living here? What’s your day like?”
He petted Tony’s horns as they settled in, the crackle of the fire and the backdrop of the winds making him feel safe and warm.
Stíofán nodded. “I know.” He covered Tony’s hand with his own. “Promise me you’ll go. There’s a handful of coins to get you started, and the rest of the money is sewn into my old tunic for safekeeping. Wear that tomorrow, so you’re ready.”
“No,” Steve’s voice was soft, and there was a tinge of hope in it now. “No, I didn't ask because I had this wonderful, beautiful omega who let me feel the most pleasure I’d ever felt, only for me to realise I had made him cry. And I wasn’t going to do that again. I was a lucky enough fellah that he’d married me. Better to have you to love and care for than not at all.”
“It’s not,” Steve shook his head, hissing as he lay the cool cloth on his arm. “But I will make it so.”
“We better take you to a doctor to be sure. And I had better call pest control. Those guys aren’t often in city parks and he should really be asleep with this temperature. Poor guy’s probably a little overwhelmed.”
It wasn’t until they reached the very end of the gallery, where the newer artists submitted pieces that Tony found something that really caught his attention.
“Okay,” Tony said, bending down to let Steve pull him into a soft kiss, their lips just barely touching. It was absolutely perfect.
With each jerk, Tiny tightened around him, winding him higher and higher until he shoved in deep spending himself inside. He shuddered through it. “I love you,” he said, unable to help it, and Tony stiffened.
“Don’t you think you’re getting ahead of yourself?” Stíofán asked, pushing his sweaty hair behind his horns. “What if he gets here and realises what a slob you are? What doe wants to raise kids amongst your hoof trimmings?”
His finger pushed down on the shutter button but as it did, there was a loud creaking groan and before he could blink, the legs of the couch gave way and the base hit the floor, tipping forward on its edge and throwing Steve facedown on the ground.
He was. Usually. This entire incident had revealed that he was losing the tight grip he held on his emotions. He needed to meditate more.
They stayed there, watching until the helicopter was just a speck on the horizon, before Rhodey led him back inside.
“Come on, up you get.” Tony was pulled to his feet and guided to the couch. Sam brought him some water, and he sipped it slowly, trying to piece together what happened.
He dismounted, setting down the stand and grabbing his kit off the back. He tried the usual fixes, adjusted a few things, but each time he tried the starter, the engine failed to catch.
The guy had looked surprised when he’d seen who was scowling at him. “Fuck you. Why are you getting in my face about it?”
Steve snorted. “I’m sure everyone feels that way. There’s a lot to do and a lot to learn. You can’t be expected to know it all at once.” He patted Tony’s knee over the duvet. “You should’ve seen what it was like before. I can make my own meal easy enough, but you think I know the first thing about washing bedsheets? I had to have one of the omegas from town who charges for cleaning come out from time to time so I wasn’t eaten to death by fleas.”
Bucky was the first to react. “Good lord!” Then he burst into laughter, even as Steve tugged Tony to his feet and scowled. “Jesus, Stevie. Save it for home will ya’?”
“Stanford.” Her dad had unfolded the letter and was looking at it intently. “You applied for Stanford?”
He wanted to make more of it - this man had kidnapped his husband, dragged him out into the middle of nowhere, and would’ve assaulted him had Tony not been able to prevent it.
“Everyone’s got to start somewhere.” There was a gentle rattle and Tony curiously pulled back the blankets a little to see.
Steve flushed. “Sometimes. Other times, he has to lie to his boyfriend because his job is a matter of national security, and he’s not allowed to say anything no matter how many times he argues with his boss.”
It was hard to keep his face blank, but he managed - years of society training hadn’t been for nothing. “I don’t know what you mean. The sheriff and I are very happy.”
He felt his eyes prickle again, remembering the fear he’d felt outside the doctor’s office, and to his horror, he sniffled. He was meant to be tough, the Sheriff’s omega, but as he looked at the evidence of how close he had come to losing Steve, all the emotion of the last day or so bubbled over, and he let out a sob.
“That wasn’t the best impression,” the doe said, readjusting the silk so it lay better. “I am Antonius.”
“Ok, ok. No food.” Stíofán felt at a loss for what to do, but the doe’s shiver made the decision for him. He lay down behind him, pulling him close and wrapping an arm around his middle.
He shook his head, and she pulled him up. “Come on, let’s head back to mine, and I’ll help you make a few to take home. You can call me Natasha by the way.”
“Oh,” Tony said, feeling a little giddy. “Well, maybe we can do that too after my leg gets checked.”
“I came to invite you to a party,” Steve said, peeking up at him over the rims of his glasses. “My friend Bucky is having a get together and I thought you might like to come.”
The alpha nodded. “Good, that’s settled. Now it’s getting late. We should look to turn in for the night.”
They both turned to see Bruce and Natasha in the doorway, the latter raising an eyebrow at the potted plant at Steve’s bedside. Tony jumped to his feet and pointed at her, rage boiling up in him hot and sharp.
“Luis!” A voice called from the door. Both Steve and Luis turned to look to see a guy in the doorway. “I asked around town, no one will help us without asking for a pretty hefty pay-- Oh hi!”
Clearly sensing an audience, the alpha gave him a look that sent a sickly feeling down Tony’s spine before he got up to return to his seat.
“No you can’t. I don’t perform tricks for commoners who can’t even be polite to people who stop them from getting their head bashed in. I’m going to help Sam.”
He looked up to see a very pale-looking Sheriff who did not look nearly as impressed as he should have, given that Tony had just saved a guy’s life. “Hi,” Tony offered, suddenly aware he must look a mess.
He took a moment to breathe before he rallied. Steve hadn’t said anything about sending him home so, as Jarvis would say, don’t borrow trouble.
Tony insisted on changing if they were to go out, despite the Sheriff’s protestations that he looked fine the way he was.
“Not as great as her rider, but not bad,” Tony shot back, only making Steve smile wider. He stepped forward, running his hand down the jacket. “I like this, where have you been hiding it?”
Dad was clearly puttering around trying to extend the time, and she didn’t really mind, but eventually, he ran out of things to mess with and admitted they should leave her to settle in.
Tony felt a huge wave of emotion and had to stop the tears from coming. He wasn’t going to have a repeat of last time on his hands! “I love you too, Steve.”
“No,” he breathed, looking at the giant gash on Steve’s back that was steadily oozing blood onto the concrete underneath. “No no no, Cap - stay with me, okay, we’ll get you -”
“You’ve been out of the ice for less than a year. It felt too soon.” Tony rubbed at his jaw, fingers brushing distractingly over his goatee. “Well, Rhodey said it was probably too soon, and I should give you time. I was waiting to see how you felt about the whole thing, figured you’d let us all know when you were up for dating again.”
Tony was just glad they hadn’t decided to stick wholly to tradition. Back when his mother has done hers, it was done when a witch turned thirteen. But well, people had more concerns about child safety now than they had in the eighties, so it had become the norm to leave at the first full moon after your eighteenth birthday. To say Tony was ready to leave the nest was an understatement.
As he searched, he let his mind wander. He thought back to the ball seven days ago, at Rhodes’ estate. He’d invited Mr Rogers under the guise of watching Peter, but really he’d just wanted to see him enjoy himself, let Tony imagine what Mr Rogers would look like in Tony’s life as more than just a tutor. He had been charming, naturally, winning over all the gentlemen and ladies in attendance.
“Move it or lose it, Rogers,” Tony called over his shoulder, already heading out the door. Steve followed after him dutifully.
Their wedding was not exactly what Tony had dreamed of when he had been a young omega, still being fed the lie that he’d marry an alpha of his choosing.
“It’s way better for you guys now,” Dad said, opening up a bag and pulling out bedding. “When I went to MIT, the few omegas there were just got assigned to a house. Definite nunnery vibes. It was all 9pm curfew and no alphas allowed above the ground floor. Little did they know, we made our own fun.” He snorted. “We made some of the alpha frats look tame.”
“I don’t get it, did I offend you? I wasn’t trying to, I just figured you wouldn’t want to take part.”
fine!” Tony shrieked, flailing a hand at Steve’s prone form in the hospital bed. “Steve got maimed for your fucking basil!”
“Shut up,” Steve told him, scowling. He grabbed his sketchbook and headed to his room, knowing he was going to inevitably add to his collection of Tony sketches.
“Woah, ok, sounds like a lot,” Rhodey said, expression soft with sympathy. “And a lot for an eighteen-year-old on his own for the first time.”
Sam’s face went soft, clearly remembering the moment. “It wasn’t anything too fancy. I was working at the Paws ‘R’ Us, and some grumpy guy walks in and points at the first cat he sees and says ‘I want that one, it’s fluffy as fuck.’”
Steve watched as the guy checked over the bike thoroughly for a good ten minutes before humming thoughtfully. “Well, nothing obvious. I’ll have to go over her with a fine-toothed comb.” He straightened up. “Why don’t you head on into town, grab a coffee or something, I’ll take your number and give you a text when I’m done.”
They ended up sitting close together at the workbench, Steve holding the broomstick steady as Tony made his adjustments. He could feel the warmth along his side and couldn’t help but lean into it.
Steve barked a laugh and kissed him again. He could feel the heat from Steve seeping through their clothes and a sense of warmth and safety settled over him. He let a hand wander down to slip beneath Steve’s shirt, sliding over him back, but paused when Steve flinched ever so slightly. “You ok?”
Tony smiled as the door closed behind the man, giving him a friendly wave. “Hi there. You after something or just here to browse?”
“Good morning beloved,” Tony managed, because if Steve was there, he was safe, to hell with the ugly curtains.
So now he waited. Waited to be told Mr Rogers was to be married and would be leaving he and Peter alone in his big empty house, with no one to keep him company or keep his son smiling so often.
Bucky handed Hugh to Tony. “I think we’re done for the day. Take your brood home before the small ones give me a damn heart attack.” He wandered off towards his parents’ house with a wave.
“I do,” Tony answered, finally spooning up the last of his meal and swallowing it down. Now he could be honest, he was sure. “I like novels, though I’m also partial to the sciences and mathematics. I like to learn.”
“We’re a tech startup. MedTech. We just got our first major contract. We’re actually going to make money for once.”
“I know,” his voice went soft, and she felt her irritation seep away. “Things are easier for now, but we’ve been lucky here in Shield. I just worry about what it’s going to be like when you leave here and go out in the world and you haven’t got your Pops and I, or even your brother, to look out for you.”
Tony nodded. “Rhodey and Sam have been great, letting me stay. Otherwise Jarvis and I would be living a box somewhere, offering spells for bread or something.”
This was what he needed. This was where he needed to be. He just needed to put the plan into action.
He started pushing the bike down the highway, feeling the heat on his shoulders and the sweat forming on the back of his neck. Thank god he was so close to his destination.
The reporter continued their commentary, but all Tony could focus on was the huge group of people trying to hold the last rope. The ship was hit by another gust, and it was clearly too much, the ship pulling free, and the rope slipping the grip of all the ground crew.
Steve brushed Bucky off, coming over as if to join them, and Tony felt a tiny tendril of anticipation. But as the man stepped forward, his boot came down on top of a stray ice cube, and he skated forward in a sharp lunge, hitting the ground hard and falling sideways with a yelp.
Maria swallowed, a lump settling in her throat. She hadn’t really thought all about this part; the excitement of a new place, new people, and the lure of finally being an adult and standing on her own two feet had been all she’d thought of for months.
He liked it too that Stíofán was uncovered, but Antonius was still wearing the shift, as if still pure even as Stíofán took that innocence from him. “I bet you imagined yourself some senator’s bride, hmmm? Laying on a couch, partying every evening, your every whim catered to. Instead, I’ll be between you legs, taking my pleasure, morning and night. My live-in whore.”
“He’s said all sorts about my figure, and how you must struggle to handle me, and perhaps I need someone with a firmer hand. And more than once he’s offered to let me ‘help him in the back room’ with a suggestion that if I did, he could cut the price on our grocery order. Revolting man.”
Stíofán rolled them, resting easily between Tony’s thighs. “-mounted my beautiful doe? Perhaps you are right; I would lament missing a chance to get inside you, to feel you come apart around me.”
Steve moved until they were kissing proper, but this one was sweeter rather than full of heat. “Be careful. Carol gets damn competitive.”
“Won’t you?” Stíofán finally asked. “When you have to watch your kid eventually forced to fight or be sold off? What then?”
Maria nodded. “Well, I guess now that I know I can get pizza and a human sacrifice, I can go become a hermit now. Sorry Caltech, the trees are calling me.”
“Takes longer when you’re little, you aren’t used to it.” Tony reached out and gave Peadar’s hair a ruffle. “You gave your Da a scare hmm?”
Credit where credit was due, Bucky didn’t hesitate further, though he looked side to side as if daring anyone to say anything. He leaned down, slicing through them, and Tony felt the material give way with a sigh of relief. He reached beneath his shirt and pulled it off, tossing it over his shoulder.
The Sheriff sat down opposite with his own bowl, already dressed, his shirt sleeves rolled up. He cut a pretty picture, and Tony again counted himself lucky for marrying such an attractive alpha, for all last night had been an unmitigated disaster.
“What the fuck?” Tony yelped, grabbing the Mach Two from where it leaned against the wall, Jarvis leaping into his robes and clinging on as they shot after Steve, catching him before he reached the clouds. “Hit the brakes Steve!”
As he stepped outside into the bright sun he heard someone say, “A delightful orange gourd for the lady?” at nearly the same time as “No thanks, I don’t like pumpkin,” and then twin gasps and a loud
But eventually their paths did cross: in the lobby of the tower, as Tony was heading out to grab donuts from his favourite place.
“The very same. And you must be the new Mr Rogers. Sam wrote and told me Steve’s catalogue omega had come. I’m glad to find it turns out you’re respectable. It’s just like that alpha to wait till I was out of town to do something so foolhardy.” She smiled. “I only got back this morning, but I was planning to call on you tomorrow to introduce myself. Guess it’s just happening a little sooner.”
Even now, when they were just a few hours away from ousting the gang, when he could be home by day’s end, he kept replaying it in his head.
As he got closer, he caught the back of an oddly familiar blond head. He stiffened. He had no interest in having it out with Rogers, though he should’ve known he’d be here given what Rhodey and Sam said. He turned, trying to slip away quietly, but Rogers must’ve caught sight of him out the corner of his eye because he turned, leaping up.
Tony hesitated. It would be easy to say yes and let him go, but he wasn’t ready to part ways yet. Instead, he found himself saying, “Want to come in for dinner?”
Antonius nodded, not even pausing in his rhythm as he undid the clasp, removing the covering and baring warm, soft skin to Stíofán hands. “Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.”
When it got late, Tony set him up on the couch, promising him a comfy night sleep. After getting through his nightly bathroom routine, he settled in tucked under the thick blanket. His mind was calm and clear of the thoughts that usually plagued him before bed, probably for the first time in months. He was just so exhausted.
Steve kissed back, enthusiasm near palpable, and Tony lost himself in it, winding his arms around Steve’s neck to keep himself in place. Big hands roamed his body, holding him tight and touching everywhere. He soaked up the feeling like a lizard in the sun, the hot slide of skin like a balm to his battered heart that had taken so much strain these last few months. He was getting wet already, his body yearning for more.
“No, this is…” Tony opened it again, staring at the picture of Steve lying half-naked among the bits of broken couch, propped up like Cleopatra with his leg straight up in the air and a ridiculous duck face underneath the cheap Egyptian headdress. The caption said
Tony spluttered. “Excuse me, young man! I think you know better than to speak about your teacher like that.”
“It’s nothing,” Steve said, fingers circling Tony’s wrist and holding on. “Just got caught in the rush. Some guy caught me with his elbow, and I took a tumble.”
“I’m just saying, don’t be surprised if on your first visit back you find they’ve picked up some weird hobbies.” He grinned. “Tony will have built some robot babies to take your place and Steve’ll be heavily into restoring antiques or something.”
“Just passing through,” Steve tells him, non-committedly. He picked up a snowglobe and gave it a little shake, the flakes circling the dome and landing on a tiny city with a large ant in the middle. “Ahhh, what exactly is this place?”
“I must’ve dropped it when we were running. We’ve got nothing. What are we going to do? That was our emergency hotel money too. Where are we going to sleep?” He could feel his chest starting to tighten with panic.
“Gentlemen, there’s an omega present,” Steve cut in. That made the mud-covered man look over in interest.
It had travelled a distance now, moving higher and higher as it passed over the city. He moved in closer, and to his relief could still see Steve gripping the end tightly. He flew forward making a beeline for it.
“It’s nothing fancy,” the Sheriff said, sounding a little bashful. “Haven’t really needed much for just me, but it’ll keep us warm and dry, which is what matters most.”
Tony pretty much forgot the incident after that, except to tell Pepper about the fight. He’d been too caught up in the sound of Steve’s laugh, the flush of his cheeks when Tony complimented him, the heady scent of his skin when he let Tony lean against him in the car back to the tower.
It was not common for omegas to be allowed in saloons unless they were part of the entertainment, but the owner, an alpha named Ms Danvers, apparently disagreed. She hadn’t even blinked an eye when they’d walked in, instead gesturing them over to a small table in the corner away from those gambling or drinking.
Steve growled, and Bucky tried to rein it in, he really did, but one look at Steve’s bedraggled face and champagne-tarred and feathered chest and he was off again, holding his aching stomach.
“I’m glad I could be useful.” He reached out and gave Tony’s hand a squeeze. Tony tried to keep the heat from his cheeks. “You’re trying and that’s what matters, don’t be too hard on yourself.”
Stíofán bit his lip, trying not to laugh. “That’s because he thinks your fainting is because you don’t eat enough. He asked me about it.”
As they walked, Tony fretted over what to say. He needed to ensure the Sheriff understood his expectations. He had travelled here and would now live with this man. They needed to be married today, lest anyone make any accusations of impropriety. He cleared his throat, still trying to find the words to voice his worry when the Sheriff spoke.
Neither he nor Barnes was as good as Steve at hiding their reactions, but politeness was clearly ingrained, as both their faces smoothed out quickly.
“Oh, he tried,” Tony said venomously, glaring at the man behind him. Hodge glared but then flinched as Tony spun a pistol Steve definitely hadn’t gotten him on his finger. “But he underestimated me, much to his detriment.”
“Sorry!” The alpha blurted, sounding flustered. “I was running late, and I completely lost my wits. I was so focused on getting to you, I just did my job without it even occurring to me that you might be the omega I was looking for.” He chuckled, his face flushing red and holding out his hand. “It’s nice to meet you.”
They cheered, wiggling over to sit at his feet. “But you have to eat up. It'll be time for sleep soon.”
When the other items arrived, Tony took them with thanks. He was well aware of the dozens of pairs of eyes on his back as he poured the acid and water into the jar. It puffed puff with white smoke, making the crowd gasp and step back. Then he took the enamel tray and shimmied under the cart. It was creaking dangerously, and Tony knew he had to be quick if he didn’t want the whole thing to collapse on them both.
The last was directed at the alpha who entered, somehow covered head to toe in mud. Tony stared in surprise, but both the deputy and Steve broke out into laughter.
Tony woke to a loud banging, his heart in his throat as Steve leapt out of bed, grabbing his gun from the dresser.
Tony watched in horror as the dish slipped from his hands and smashed on the floor in an explosion of china, soup and vegetables all across his nicely swept floor.
“It isn’t. Honestly, I’m such a klutz.” A hand brushed over his jacket, removing some stray pastry crumbs that dusted it. Tony blinked and finally got a good look at the man in front of him.
Antonius wiggled in his lap, rising and dropping down so that Stíofán slid deep inside. Stíofán’s eyes nearly crossed, the tight grip clamping down when he was so close to the mark.
“Morning,” Steve said, tipping his hat. He walked along the station platform, trying not to look too antsy.
“--and her you see? There! She slips the ivory chess piece into her pocket. Can’t help herself, does it at every party.”
“And what about me?” Tony’s voice came from the doorway, sounding almost angry. “Do I get a thank you for putting you up or are you just going to disappear into that helicopter and I’ll never hear from you again?”
Steve laid out a colourful blanket, and unpacked the picnic basket while Tony stared out at the sea. Sam had clearly gone all out, and they had no trouble getting through it. For such a small guy, Steve could sure eat a lot.
“Possibly. It does do harm, but it takes time. My suggestion is don’t get swallowed up by it, but short bursts of contact should be ok. We really just need you to hold it in place while our research guys work out how to beat it. If we let it run rampant, the civilian casualties will start mounting fast.”
His heart leapt up in his throat as he dropped the pole and rushed to meet him. Was his whole family
It was like he was walking on air all morning and nothing could dampen his mood. Not even when Steve had cycled past, giving him a wave and Tony had dropped the loaf he’d been handing to a customer, his face flushing red.
“Sure dad,” Tony agreed, trying not to roll his eyes. His father wasn’t a witch, didn’t come from a witch family, but he always seemed to think he knew best. It came from his success, in fairness to him, of starting a witchcraft business that was well known in the community. It had been his parents’ pride and joy before he’d come along, his mother providing the know-how and skill, his father the business acumen. But running a magic shop didn’t make one a witch, and his dad always seemed to forget that.
Maybe what he needed was to get out. Just out. Anywhere but here. As he walked home from the gym the idea started to take root. He could. He could leave, just start driving and not stop. The freedom of it sung in his chest and by the time he opened the door to his apartment, his mind was made up.
He got closer to the thing, it’s strange yellowy skin looking like jelly. Hell, he called it skin but he didn't know if it had independent thought or if it was just a mass controlled by something else. Not that it mattered. He didn’t need to know that right now. He just needed to keep it in place.
“Yeah, just need help with these three. They need escorting to the courthouse, and I want Judge Fury over here to deal with them straight away.” Steve looked around at the crowd watching the spectacle. “I’m sure I’ll have no shortage of witnesses.”
“Your omega is trying to stop you from embarrassing yourself,” he told the alpha warningly. “I suggest you follow her advice.”
“Haha,” Steve said, rolling his eyes. He looked down at the cover trying not to wince. In some ways, it was kind of flattering, but at the same time the small voice in his head calling him a fraud just got louder.
Steve felt like the world was turning upside down and inside out. Everything he’d assumed was slipping away, leaving Tony looking at him earnestly, and to be honest, a little heated.
That had Stíofán frowning. “Are you suggesting I didn’t take kids into consideration when I built this house for you. The second biggest in the village? We could have a dozen and there’d be space and love for all of them.”
He let her go after a moment. “We’d better let you settle in. I’ll get your dad out of here before he starts crying everywhere.”
As he got close, he could feel his muscles tensing. That beautiful creature would be in his room, waiting for him. It was almost too good to be true.
He’d agreed, reluctantly handing Peter off - with a nuzzle and an “I love you” - to Bucky, who promised to take him home, and resigning himself to the fact that his apology would have to wait.
Rogers’ eye was starting to swell, clearly they’d gotten in one good shot before Tony intervened. He looked surprised to see Tony there. “Um hi?”
“Absolutely,” Tony said, feeling pleased. “Always happy to help and the press definitely won’t hurt.” He took out a card from his wallet. “Get them to call my Business Manager. She’ll set up a meeting.”
Steve crossed his arms in front of his chest. “Let Pepper organise your life instead of taking care of yourself, as usual?”
One of his old colleagues had found their match. And gross, there was a whole cutesy story about how they’d been in the same building for months but like magic, the printer had jammed on a major project and they’d had to work late, and met their soulmate who was on the cleaning crew. It was all so
“Rhodey,” Tony whined, and a little of the genuine distress slipped into his voice. “I really like him.”
“We’ll do whatever we want, because we can, and you can’t do anything about it,” the second one said and leaned down to grab the bike. As he did, Rogers snapped, his fist striking out to hit the man and sending him stumbling backwards. “You little—“
Tony actually loved the traditional violet witch robes, but if his father thought he was wearing it while trying to fly a broom he was nuts. He had enough to focus on without freezing his ass off. Instead, he’d opted to modify it, wearing dark jeans and a jumper of nearly the same shade beneath the robes, which he wore open. With the hood back, it looked a lot like one of the hoodies he knew commoners his age wore, but much longer, coming down to his knees.
Also I have plans for a little bonus chapter - a small bleat-quel if you will - so make sure you’re subscribed so you don’t miss it! ♥️♥️
Tony smiled. “The Doctor knows best. I assure you Jarvis will make sure you follow his orders to the letter.”
When he stood up, Tony was staring at him wide-eyed. “Nice aim there. Jesus.” Tony walked over to the guy gingerly and grabbed the kitten, tucking it into his arms and moving back behind the counter. “I should call the police.” Tony was starting to tremble, and Steve realised that for all he’d seemed calm and confident, he wasn’t unaffected. He stepped forward, wrapping his hand around Tony’s elbow.
Maybe he ought to give some thought to hiring another deputy, at least one who could be called upon for hunting criminals away from town. He enjoyed the work, but it would let him be at home more and away less - Sam too, if he and Nat were going to have a couple of pups underfoot. Bucky certainly wouldn’t mind more time chasing bounties.
Tony rolled his eyes and made sure to smack Rhodey lightly on the back of the head as he passed by, unable to help letting out a laugh as he dodged a retaliation on the way to the bar.
As Tony talked to the woman about the book she wanted to buy for her daughter, Steve watched with a sense of envy. Tony lit up when he talked about books, knew exactly which one she wanted and located it in a second.
They come across a farm accident. One of the tenant, Mr Hogan Steve knew now, had become trapped beneath a loaded carriage. Steve had watched as Mr Stark had appeared, fetched by one of Hogan’s sons, and had lain in mud to take apart the cart with careful precision as the other farmhands had removed the cart's burden. He removed the piece keeping the man trapped and had dragged him out himself, the both of them covered in dirt and Stark had given Hogan his own clean cloak from the back of his horse when the man began to shiver. Everyone had cheered to know the man was safe, including Peter, and Mr Stark had turned at the sound, giving them a cheerful wave when he spotted them on the rise. Steve’s heart had near stopped beating from the beauty of it. This highborn man, fine clothes covered in mud, eyes brightened by the exertion of rescuing someone who others of his status might have left to his fate. From that day, he had only fallen harder with every passing minute.
Tony let a smile uncurl on his face. It felt rather apt, after so much time of he and Steve missing each other like ships in the night for them to finally meet now.
“I think you’re being more than vigilant,” Steve grouched, giving the codliver oil on the bedside table a glare. “Why do I have to take that?”
Steve must’ve spotted him as well because he lifted a hand up in greeting and Tony gave him a smile.
“If you’ve got time to speculate, Deputy Wilson, then I’d best assign you some more work,” the Sheriff said, his tone friendly but firm and the Deputy seemed to catch the note with a wave of his hand.
“If you don’t, you’re going to be hit by a car or something because you’re too tired to look both ways. You need a break.”
Antonius huffed. “An Aquileian Fainting Satyr. It’s a common condition amongst the tribes of Aquileia. Well, actually that’s how it’s described, but we don’t really faint, just kind of go stiff and flop over for a moment and then we’re fine.” He shrugged. “It skipped a generation in my family, so when they realised I had it, they figured I’d have a better chance at the Stables. When the Stables realised, they figured I’d make them more money as a prize for a gladiator or a whore. No senator or general wants a bride who topples over at the drop of a hat.”
To say the blood rushed to the alpha’s face was an understatement, and it would’ve been comical if the man hadn’t been frantically shaking his head. “No Tony, we don’t - is this because of Hodge? You don’t need to prove anything to me.”
Stíofán tossed another log on the fire, checking for stray coals around the edges before heading over to the fabric sheet that hid their bed. The partition was an unusual addition since the houses were usually all one room, but Tony had grown used to his privacy after the Stables and hadn’t been ready to give it up, which Stíofán understood. He heard the swish of the fur at the entrance as Tony returned with the bowls, tying the fabric behind him to block out the chill. Stíofán stripped off his shirt and the thick trousers he wore, shivering as the cool air crept over his skin.
Tony hummed. “Sure. It always is. I grew up thinking I’d take over the company, I’d always liked engineering and I’m damn good at it. But then I realised, that just wasn’t what I
Then Steve turned around, and the tears in his eyes were undercut immediately by the wide blinding smile that was spreading over his face. “It was Carol. Doc came by and let her know that the fever broke overnight. He’s going to be fine.”
“J.J’s over there Azari,” she said, pointing to her brother, nearly shouting to be heard over the greetings.
Steve looked at the painting then back and shook his head. He smiled, turning it so Tony could see through the clear plastic.
The pup was curled on his side, sweating and hot to the touch. Tony rocked him gently to wake him. “Peter?”
“I understand,” Steve said, and he could feel it, like a switch in his mind, Cap taking over and his focus on the mission, even as the thought of Tony and the rest of Cedar Grove tried to tighten their hold. Everything else slipped away until all that was left was the job, though the last flicker of Tony looking up at the helicopter made his chest ache.
He panted, the cool air on his body making his fleece ruffle. He rolled to the side, on his back, the doe now lying flat, as his arms gave way, and tried to regain his breath.
The deputy’s eyes lit up. “Thank you, Mr Rogers. Really. Omegas are always bringing stuff for Steve because he’s the Sheriff. Hell, before you and he were married, Sharon Carter used to come-a-calling with all sorts of eats, but do you think anyone appreciates his hard-working deputies? No sir.”
“I love you,” the doe said again and Stíofán knew he would never tire of it. “But if you do not finish what you started, you’ll sleep alone on the hard floor tonight!”
“Alright, alright,” Steve said, trying to soothe him. The day had clearly been long if his omega was so distressed, so far from his usual quick wit and fire. It was as if there were ants in his drawers the way he was twitching, and if making love to him was what he needed to relax, well.
He made it around halfway when he heard the clip-clop of hooves behind him. He felt a small spike of fear, but then a familiar horse pulled up in front of him and a familiar alpha slid from the saddle to stand beside him.
“I don’t want to hear it,” Tony growled. “You are my only link here, and yet you act like you don’t owe me anything. I deserve to know if my husband is dead or alive, and yet you didn't care one whit how I was feeling.”
“It’s personal enough that you felt you needed to hide from me,” Tony said. “And I can tell it’s about me. Those pointed ears of yours give you away every time. They go bright green like old earth traffic lights.”
Tony laughed. “You know, weirdly I feel better? It’s like having my anxiety confirmed and facing it made me feel like maybe I could deal with other things too. And seeing Peter, so ready to charge in, that kid can take down anything. I’m sure it’s the adrenalin hangover talking, but I feel kind of relaxed.”
“Can do.” Tony took the bread out to the front of the shop, slotting it into the baskets, the heavenly smell filling the air anew.
He would’ve been able to counter it without a thought on any other day, but it was like his brain was falling into a fog. He was hot, and a little dizzy, and all he could smell was Tony.
"Dad," Peter says, hoarse, his throat constricting from the tears he won't allow to spill. "Come here."

“Tommy.” Deep breath; now or never. Tony tugs at the end of his scarf. “It’s not any of them,” he starts, “but...I
The boys had preferred the open space. There had been something about just letting the light shine through the common areas that had helped elevate their then state of being. Not to mention, it had been easier on Tony being a newly single parent; one look over the kitchen counters and he had been able to spot them doing homework or playing video games.
Steve grabs the gifts Bucky and Sam got him from the bedroom—a small but sleek black leather-bound sketchbook from Bucky and a new set of charcoal pencils from Sam—and shows it off to Tony. They’re still seated on the dining table, Steve still on his first mug of coffee, while Tony is on his second.
“But I… I think that’s what they wanted. They didn’t want me to stay under the way I had in the real ice. They wanted me to remember. You. They wanted me to remember you and Peter.” Steve sniffles. Tears stream down his face, and when he blinks, more of them fall. “They want me to know that I’m being taken away again.”
Steve give his back to Tony and this is the first time he did something like that after having sex ! Tony’s heart stopped beating for moments then he sighed and hugged Steve even when Steve is giving his back to him .
“W-what about the nice things you were saying to me dad? what about me being your lovely son pops? Uncle Thor, you never let me fall, you were always with me making sure that I never fall. Just p-please tell me what happened?” He was happy with himself that he’s not crying anymore and he’s just calm.
"Yeah, I've got bad memories with thunders." Thor sits so now they were eyes to eyes. Tony never so Thor like that. Of course Thor is gorgeous, but damn he had to do all of his strength to not look at the shirtless man in front of him.
“You’re such a pathetic creature!” Thor pulled his hair and slammed his head to the wall and Peter was sure there’s blood from his head on the wall.
"You know he loves you, right?" He asked Peter who nods softly and Steve smiled then he leaned down and kissed Peter's forehead. Pepper pulled away and wipes her tears then she smiled to Steve and left them alone.
He opened his eyes slowly to find Tony resting his head on Steve's chest while Clint and Natasha standing at the window. Thor and Bruce were talking quietly. Loki and Bucky in no place to be seen.
“Alright you can go now . Natasha I need to talk to you “ Nick said and Steve left the place to just breath cause he can’t breath there’s no air in his lungs.
And now Sharon ! He doesn’t like her for sure!But the rest of the avengers are loving her so much . Even when he was telling jokes that for sure Steve , Clint and Thor will laugh on it  she decided to go on other way and made the joke as if he was mocking from them cause they’re poor and it ended up with Tony fighting Clint
“I’m the god of thunder. I’m the king of Asgard . I’m the strongest avenger . Do you know me now ?” Thor asked pulling Tony to stood behind him and what he did surprised everyone except Loki who was so calm like always.
“What do you want ?” He asked dryly he wasn’t ready for  her complaining him for leaving Sharon alone .
“PETER GOD DAMN ANSWER ME!” Tony started yelling at him but Peter was afraid that he’ll slap him or let Steve do his things with him instead.
He went to the kitchen on shaking barefoot, he looked up at everyone nope they don’t seem normal at all!
He felt Tony’s tongue inside his mouth and he just couldn’t react he was just putting his hand on Tony’s shoulder and the other was dropped he wasn’t pulling him closer or pushing him away
They started fighting Bruce and Sharon were trying to stop the fight while the others were just looking .
He regrets agreeing to go with Clint and Natasha in this undercover mission. He never went to mission like this so here they’re tied to chairs and being beaten up from Hydra’s agents.
"I.. I still care about you all and– and because I care about you, I'll leave the compound to you. You don't have to leave."  He looked up at Thor who was still pinning him, but there's something in Thor's eyes and it's the same for Loki and Steve.
They had seen how he refused to tell anything about them and never give up even when he was raped over again and again and again.
“I’ll tell you . B-but promise me you won’t go and fight with her or with Steve or with anyone else?” Tony said looking at Bucky face and Bucky nodded .
Peter saw him and Tony’s heart melted for Peter’s puppy eyes and the tears were rolling down his cheeks.
“I’m sorry Tony that I wasn’t here for you” Bucky said and Tony didn’t replied to him and Bucky knows that Tony is crying in silence .
He start making bacon and pancakes for them and then he burned himself, he groaned and his tears start falling.
Seeing Thor kissing Tony’s neck from behind while Tony is making food just like the way he used to do to him .
"Th-thor.. I swear to you it was the lack of sleep and food that's caused the tear to fall.. I-.. I'm ok I swear to yo-" Thor shushed him and Tony closed his eyes.
Thor kept slamming Peter’s head against the wall until Peter was breathing hardly and he passed out and Thor slammed him for the last time then left him.
Steve turned to Tony surprised, he opened his mouth to reply but he closed it and Tony can see the hurt in Steve’s eyes. In these moments Tony will be apologizing to Steve and kissing him and maybe begging him to forgive him but right now he felt so numb, He can’t look at Steve in the same way he was looking at him before...
‘So that you don’t have to keep me distracted’ but he choose to walk down to his lab and Bruce followed him .
“We won’t.. He’ll kill him self and you’ll see that “ Natasha said and Bucky lifts the middle finger for her .
"We won't care about you cause right now you showed us how useless you're. I'll request rooms for us so we can live far from you so that you can't hurt us anymore."
Tony hugged Steve and hide his face in Steve’s chest . Steve hugged him back and Tony was greatful for that .
Bruce was rubbing his eyes and Steve was looking at Peter and smiling-oh he was looking at him with that warm look again.
“But once we stood to leave Fury asked me to stay and then he told me a different thing.” Her voice start getting lower and he looked at Steve who was now grabbing the table behind him so tight, His knuckles were wight and he was looking at the floor. He was angry and Tony can see that.
“Thor, I trust you to keep him safe this week. I’ll come back with them and I’ll make sure no one says bad word to him.”  Rhodey said and Thor’s head turns to look at his brother who was playing with his knife now.
“Are you happy now ?! Thor the god of thunder, The king of Asgard and the strongest avenger congrats for you! you wanna take him huh ?”Steve was shocked that’s he can’t be Calm anymore.
Of course he broke down and tell the others to leave him alone but they didn’t. Instead they stayed with him and he slept with his head resting on Steve’s chest while the others slept beside them on the bed. It was Tony’s bed after all and it was large enough for the sixth of them.
“Sir someone hacked the system and turned me off I’m sorry that I don’t know who did this “ FRIDAY replied to him and he hide his face in his hands .
his father was never proud of him and now he wants Tony to join the military. He could hear his parents arguing in the other room. His mother wanted him to be a doctor while his father wanted him to be with like his friend(A Captain).
And then there’s Wanda,There’s something weird by the glares that she was giving it to him, but he ignored her and closed his eyes.
He saw them all shocked from his chest, so of course they’ll feel disgusted by him again.  He felt uncomfortable under their gaze and then Wanda came.
Thor, thanks for his presence, hugged Steve and kept promising him about finding Peter and how everything is going to be ok.
He pushed Thor lightly so Thor could leave him and he did, but once his legs were on the floor, he was about to fall. Thanks god Thor picked him up again.
“Enough! Enough! I can’t.” Loki stood and start pacing around. Thor looks back at the screen that playing Steve when he was hitting Tony with his shield.
When they all turned around they didn’t find Steve with them . Looking down at the ground to find him unconscious.
((‘It had become a habit to sleep in the garage, to be beating up from your own family, to make food and maybe one of your family will burn you if he was in bad mood, or maybe Uncle Thor will be angry and he’ll come to but the fire in his body in me.
They started walking again and Tony thinks that Steve is the one who ordered them to be nice with Tony, cause after what happened with Steve that night he wakes up to find himself in the bed and Steve sitting on a chair near him. So Steve started coming down to Tony’s lab with food or to just sketch there and Tony found it comforting in some how. Sometimes Steve will give Tony kisses on the forhead, cheeks and near to his lips, but not on the lips. maybe it was Steve’s way to apologize about something he did right.
“What do you want Tony?” Bruce doesn’t want to be rude with Tony, but sometimes Tony gets so annoying and no one can take what he says. specially his sex jokes.
He can't blame her. She's saying he's the one who killed her parents and then she says he's the reason of Ultron. Although Steve, Clint, Natasha and Bruce disagreed with her and told her that she's the reason of Ultron and her brother's death was Ultron's fault and not anyone else.
“No, I’m better than this. Just leave him, I don’t give a fuck.” Tony smiled to Ross who was scared.
“You know what I’m talking. You won’t get anything by giving the hottest news to Hydra cause you know that I’ll always stand in your face, “ He took a step forward to her and he can’t control himself anymore. He wants to kill her but he can’t.
Tony entered the lab smiling but he was pale and the bags under his eyes making him looks like panda. Tony sniffed and leaned on the table beside him.
Tony wake up his whole body hurting him . He looked around to see himself in his bed and Bruce is sitting beside him on the chair. Bruce smiled to him and he smiled back .
"N-no, Steve..." he coughs and Steve starts rubbing his back, "I want t-to rest pl-please?" It was Steve's turn to shake his head, "Steve li-listen to me! I-it's over, let g-go... It's ok." Pepper wanted to pull Steve off, but he shrugged her hands off and glared at her. She really didn't deserve someone to treat her like that, but he can't. He just wants Tony to be alive.
"Peter, I promised your father to keep you safe." Peter snorts. He can't let Bucky gets hurt. Hell, what he'll tell Loki? Oh, he stayed with me and the witch get mad and killed him? No way!
"D-dad??" And there's no response from anyone. He stood and walked to the door put it was slammed open before he can reach it.
"Loki, maybe something bad happened in Asgard and your father wants you back? Your brother is right Loki you should try to calm your self down cause you'll only hurt yourself when you're angry an-" He couldn't finish what he's saying cause Loki came and everything was on the table in front of Tony was broken on the ground now. Tony was shocked and scared that Loki will try to kill him again.
Tony wants to cry, Rhodey is the only one who’ll never change and give the cold shoulder to him. Rhodey was everything for Tony. He’ll kill him self if something happened to this man.
“No! Please don’t hurt me!” He doesn’t know who’s here in this room anymore. All he thinks about is they’ll hurt him now. “Please, I don’t know anything! I don’t know where are they!” He pushed who ever was holding him and run away to his safe place ‘his lab’
“I’ll go talk to him.” Natasha says and Peter wiped his tears away. He shakes his head, he wanted to tell them that Tony’s right and he can do what ever he wants to Peter, but the words dies in his mouth.
First Pepper and then he promised himself that he won’t love anyone. But when he saw Steve he forgot everything. Suddenly Steve was the most one hurting him.
“Are you happy now ?! Thor The god of thunder , The king of Asgard and The strongest avenger congrats for you ! You wanna take him huh ? “ Steve was about to have a fight with Thor and that’s surprised Tony .
Peter was lying between his dad and pops, they were out in the middle of the night watching the beautiful stars together.
“What’s going on?” They heard Tony’s voice and all of them turned to see him standing at the door. He was so pale how he’s still alive?
Tony doesn’t know why he had this feeling of just going and crying between Bucky’s arms but he did .
"The only way to keep me safe is by staying away from me." God, this was the first time Peter saw emotions show on the Winter Soldier's face. The hurt show clear in his face.
Where’s Rhodey? He needs him alot . But Rhodey had married and they hadn’t seen him again. He missed him so much .
So as I said I wanted to ass something weird to the story! Something Supernatural! Support me with your kudos and comments! Love you all !
“If anything happened to him I’ll make sure you and Nick will pay for it “ He stood and left Natasha behind him shocked .
“Tony what’s wrong in what you were dreaming?” Steve asked him again cause he wanted to know Tony on his real one not the fake one ! Tony is trying to show them he’s strong but he was so weak from the inside and Steve knows about it .
"Can you tell us what's wrong guys? I want to go to my bed and sleep" Clint rolled his eyes and yawned. Seriously how are these morons are sitting with him? Natasha smacked Clint's head and He nodded a thank you to her she just smirked.
“Shut up Buck ! Any way Tony I’m here to tell you that I know why it showed right now . You know what I mean “ Loki said and took a deep breath
