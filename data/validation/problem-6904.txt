“Steve, stop!” Tony shouted, trying to latch himself onto Steve’s armour. He didn’t know why the man was intent on hurting the others but he needed to save his friends, while he still had them. The state of Carol was already critical from mere observation, the last thing he needed was for Peter to get hurt. Although he now knew where the hospital was the supplies in there were scarce and already probably used up.
“No… Steve! Snap out of it!” Tony panicked, kicking his legs out a little at the man who straddled himself on top of him, scratching and trying break the armour, clearly trying to bend the pieces that were neatly folded over his skin.
Another repulsors headed his way and skimmed his shoulder. The burning singe made Tony make a small yelp of pain but gave him the drive to run forward and grapple onto Steve, shaking his shoulders. “You need to snap out of this!”
T’Challa and Hank were working while Reed was taking a little time away from the labs (as per an agreement with Sue). They both were talking amongst themselves. It had been a long time coming; a conclusion to this all.
Naturally, the tower was only built after the entire city was cleaned up and restored, and one of the first pieces of mail that Tony had gotten when the tower was finally built was the IOU that he had left the store keeper for those clothes. Needless to say, the store owner got more than they bargained for when a cheque for $1,000 was sent in return.
There was loud creaking when he stepped foot in the metal cave, darting toward the communication beacon that was smack bam in the middle of the room, typing a few details into it quickly and dialling for the Avengers.
Steve’s body twitched and he pushed himself into the kiss. Tony made a small murmur beneath it with surprise, and then he felt a sharp pain along his lip. Flinching a little he tried to pull back, but Steve grabbed the back of his head and kept him in place. Tony made another sound of discomfort.
“With improvements, of course. You can thank me later,” Tony beamed before delivering the knockout punch, sending the frail, evil genius to the ground. “The great thing about these is that my hand doesn’t hurt at all after that. I would’a thought hitting something as bony would’ve, but no. Great, right?”
“Make me. Actually no, I quite like it in here; it brings back memories of all sorts.” Tony bantered, the other suit didn’t seem happy and that became particularly noticeable when its shoulders rose, having taken human mannerisms into account. Heavy stomps echoing on the floor, rumbling the ground, but Tony stood his position, absorbing as much energy as he could into his chest as the centre brightened.
A manacle, dark cackle echoed in the large room, it came from all over. Steve and Tony looked up and down, around where they stood.  Steve stepped forward a fraction and then quickly a large orange smoke bomb was sent their way. A puff of smoke wafted up Steve’s lungs, making him cough and hack as he quickly covered his mouth with a gauntlet, but strangely enough, his eyes could see right through the blast, seeing a flying machine zoom past.
“He is mine.” It repeated like a broken record. “We will be one, and you, Steven Grant Rogers, will be destroyed. You do not belong here.”
“Well, for some reason, it wouldn’t work on Steve. It appears to work fine on others though; Luke tested it out for me when he’d popped over.”
Whenever people had said Tony was a bad person Steve would always seek to prove them wrong after spending time with them, Tony was nothing but a ray of sunshine in the darkness and mundane atmosphere that the job was surrounded with, Tony brought him sheer joy since day one.
The door was left open earlier by Johnny when he had left. Steve had only noticed when he tilted his head up to bask in the glory of the sun and noticed the trail of fire, although to him by this point he didn’t know what that was. His memories were little more blurry hazes at best. He had a selective thought process, as did Tony; he only wanted to eat at the moment. The sun that he had once craved was already drying his skin, the searing rays and the sparse water remaining in Steve’s system meant that the sun was
“Steve..?” Tony repeated again, this time with a little more added conviction. Steve lifted his head, his eyes returning to normal. His pupils constricted, but as they began to adjust to the light, they dilated again. Tony’s mouth hung open and he let out a shaky gasp, reaching out for him as though he were trying to make sure that this wasn’t just a nightmare.
“Keyword being could have. You’re lucky I’m a genius,” he calmly dusted off his hands and smirked. “And careful, you’ll tear your ‘stitches’” He added with a smug chuckle.
He could feel his lips part as the gentle graze of his touch moved, and willingly his body moved forward, slipping his leg between Steve’s with their powerful locked stares not broken once.
She sipped her coffee, leaving a bright red lipstick mark on the porcelain white mug and smiled reassuringly at him. “You don’t have to be so tense, you know.”
“So much for a peaceful rest. Yo, room service, anyone ever told you if there’s a sock on the door...” He was cut off when he caught sight of the woman before him. Her long blonde hair swirled behind her as she hovered elegantly in front of the open door, her hands glowing with energy although the once metal patch on her face had extended – rather than just her eye being covered by the plate, she now had a fully metal mask.
It was like carrying a fallen angel to a sanctuary, at least that’s where Tony’s imagination had taken him.
He was suddenly struck by an electrical pulse that was emitted from the device and went flying back, yet again. Tony flying into the distance seemed to be a common developing trend, apparently.
Tony looked at Steve pleadingly, but as he was raised closer to his father that Steve spotted Tony’s small little wings. They were grey in colour which was highly unusual for a young angel, and they flapped violently as Howard spat nothing but verbal abuse at him, dropping him back to the floor after a torrent of insults. Steve stared helplessly, “Stop, stop it damn it!!” He yelled, the lights flickering as he yelled louder. He couldn’t bear to see Tony being abused like this, he hated bullies, he hated them with every bone in his body.
“And T’challa. They’re very procedural, you have to respect that, as tedious as it is. Come on buddy, I promise I’ll buy you doughnuts afterwards, deal?”
“As long as we assemble and work together, we’ll take any threat down. Remember, Barton!” Carol encouraged them in a loud commanding tone that was strong enough to light the flames of urgency in the rest of the team, that and trust as well as the courage that they needed at that moment in time.
Partially the vague memories did haunt him but now it was all becoming distorted; all he wanted to do was survive and keep up his strength and most of all stay by Steve’s side.  Perhaps him being turned was a blessing, means of staying by the side of the man he loved for much longer.
Tony could feel something entering his system, he could feel his blood becoming thicker as he coughed and spluttered out drops of black ooze.
The other man hovered in the air opposite him, staring with eyes that could burn deep into his soul.
“Just for some coffee.” Steve replies calmly, taking off his own jacket to slide around Tony’s shoulders. Steve was sensitive, yes, but somewhat numbed to arctic winds, besides; it was only a place around the corner. It wasn’t as though he was going to go for a hike in the snowy mountains.
Steve leaned over to Tony, waving a hand in front of his dazed face and snapping his fingers to shake him out of his memories, Tony jumped and resumed listening to Doom. “Carry on…”
Steve’s eyes remained focused, his wings set back as he tried to concentrate. His hand hovered carefully over the wound whilst Tony stared, mesmerised.
As expected Doom’s attention was caught by the flailing cop, waving his arms about before running back to one of the statues and tugging one of its arms lose (a surprisingly easy task for someone with his strength) and threw it at the villain.
Steve dashed to protect Tony as quickly as he could, always staying a couple of steps ahead of him with his shield facing the beams. Each blast was taking its toll, the shields power fading with each passing moment.
He moved from keyboard to keyboard, performing access overrides as though he were playing a simple video game. His tasks were made quicker thanks to extremis flowing through his veins, allowing him to communicate with technology as though he were telling a butler what to do. Tony’s blue irises lightened to a cyan and a faint lit ring appeared as he accessed the systems quickly. It was as though he was rooting through mounds of paperwork, slinging it in multiple directions, trying to dig through the encryptions and security codes. The work was tedious to say the least, and it was heavily locked and covered. If Nick Fury knew how to do one thing well, it was how to cover his tracks. Traversing the vast magnitude of data and files that were hidden, he managed to dig out secret after secret. HYDRA’s work with SHIELD was one of the deepest secrets that they were, and that was exposed and ridden of by the heroes that Fury had hired. So that wasn’t the deepest of secrets, but he’d managed to find more – plans for weaponry using his own tech, plans for suits, teams and more.  After compiling the mass of secrets in his new and improved database he sat down at the desk, resting back in the huge leather chair, fingers tapping on the dark mahogany desk as he stared at the monitor. Admittedly he did have that extreme sense of fulfilment overcoming him, particularly because he’d managed to pull a Sherlock Holmes on all of these files.
these days, and it was further tainted by the rotten stench of internal politics within the Illuminati. Still, if there was one thing Tony could see himself reliant upon, it was that Reed Richards would have something to help him out.
His footsteps became more careful, the shift of water beneath his feet making it significantly more difficult to be quiet as he stepped further and further into the factory. The large doors seemed to be the only way in, asides from a few broken windows that were far too small for his large, muscular frame. The main doors it was.
“You know where we’re going, chums? We’re going to get as far away from here as we can. I’m glad Tony will keep you busy; I think it’ll be a bitter sweet death actually, for the both of you. While you’re here I’ve had bombs planted all over the city, including right there.” His arm swung out and gestured toward the factory. “Distractions are easy, huh. We managed to use all these guys, all these villains as our pawns to separate you all, and now you’re all going to fall one by one. Enjoy, it’s been a…
“Like I said, this place became more of a memorial ground. This part of the city was hit the worst by the explosions and well… Became a graveyard.”
“Steve? You can, you can hear me?” That was the first time he had heard the soldiers voice speaking normal words in days. “Steve?”
Tony turned his eyes up, lifting up a plate on his arm to reveal an infrared scanner, trying to use that to find them as he pointed his palm to the surface in an attempt to find them, but there were no traces matching their heat signal. “They’re gone, Peter. They might’ve escaped… Just wait it out here, will you? They asked you to wait and they know what they’re doing.”
They exited as quickly as they could. Now that they were out in the open, Steve placed Hank down on the ground and began examining him, Tony did the same when Janet was sat down on the sidewalk. “We’ll get you fixed up. Hold on.” Tony dashed away from them for a moment to run into a nearby grocery store, grabbing a few bottles of water, bandages and granola bars and then writing a huge “I.O.U – Tony Stark.” On a lotto ticket that was resting on the counter before running back out and joining the others, handing Janet a bottle with one of the bars while tearing open the wrapper with his teeth and taking a huge chomp of the bar he was holding. Janet stared with worry and concern over Hank as Steve caught the bandages that Tony tossed to him, wrapping Hank’s multiple wounds up. The shrapnel from the bomb had done quite a lot of damage, but it wasn’t life threatening now that it was all wrapped up.
They were all in Tony’s upper lab. The billionaire was so work-orientated that he had two labs; the lower lab where his suits were laid to rest, and the upper lab where he would work in eyesight of the other Avengers and their living space, a less technical area, a leisure lab one could say, where he quite welcomed the social antics of his team, whilsthis own lower lab was his sanctuary where he would rather not be disturbed. Few had access to the lower lab, given how protective he was over his suits and other top secret projects, and yet the exception to that security check was Captain America – who had a full access pass everywhere throughout the mansion. Who was Tony to deny their leader the VIP treatment? Though most would pin it on Tony Stark’s undeniable soft spot for Captain America, rather than methodical circumstance granting him access.
Toward they went, passing through the crowds, slipping through easily as no one seemed to bat an eyelash at them. But he had his shield with him, his rock, and he knew that they could withstand anything together. The original Iron Man with Iron Patriot walking side by side, even though Steve lacked a helmet.
Tony reached up, his hand still mildly trembling from the shock as he moved the skeleton, carrying it as bones fell, some shattering to the touch being so brittle after years of deterioration and some just falling. He gathered them all up in the bundle of clothes that they were still in and placed them under the bed, “Sorry pal…” He said as he cringed, dusting the sheet off to get rid of the bone fragments.
“You’re telling me.” Peter hopped over some broken glass whilst Tony just tread over it, hearing it crunch under his feet.
Tony’s breath hitched, he winced, and then whined, his body tensing despite the command as he felt the cold kiss of metal slowly ease its way into his body. It was just one finger, one deep, long finger. Tony’s mouth opened and he sat up properly, arching his back ever so slightly.
His hips swayed unconditionally to Steve’s pumps, wanting more, craving more. His eyes opened and he tilted his head forward to admire how the Captain’s muscles moved, seeing the clockwork move with his hand motions too, it was truly beautiful, regardless.
Immediately he focused on the dark blue eyes that stared at him, the man that stood at the edge of the bed in a strange black uniform with white straps. The blur cleared into a distinct image after time. “Where am I?! Who are you?”
There were two guards by the main door, two large henchmen that were quite clichéd in terms of appearance; bald, burly and wearing white suits. If he didn’t know better they looked as though they were based off the King Pin, especially with the large canes that they both held.
Each movement was harder than the next. His head was still pounding from earlier, but his mind was in complete disarray. Eventually, he managed to sit up completely, but not without ripples of pain spreading throughout his entire body.
Tony’s expression softened and his heart lifted, pushing himself up to his feet and offering his hand to Steve. “Come on Winghead, we’ve got a job to do.”
run off the moment that she thought symbiote-infused armour was a bad idea. It had crossed his mind to show her the wonders of Extremis first-hand, but he couldn’t justify coercing her in such a fashion. He still had that much dignity…
Meanwhile, he curled up by Steve’s side, trying to recuperate from the overexertion. He lifted Steve’s hand delicately and tucked himself under it, seeking his warmth given he was only in a work vest. His hands went for a nearby puddle, using the rainwater to clean the blood off his hands. He would never get that blood off, not in his head – he kept seeing it, he could feel the warm splatter over his fingertips while he was wiring Steve’s severed nerve endings to the wires of the augmentations.
Fury drew himself closer to the screen, watching the solider look like a deer caught in the headlights.
“Steve..?” He called out, scanning the room while he could and finally spotting it. Left hand wall, centre computer, which was definitely the control panel that the two had been searching for. It had dozens of pinpoints on the screen, and cameras switching from person to person with vitals on screen.  The distraction was temporary, but Steve needed his attention first. He staggered over as quickly as he could to the other armoured man’s side.
“Steve… Steve…” His name rolled off his tongue, his childhood hero doing this to him was beyond anything he could have ever dreamed of.
Jessica, a black haired policewoman with her hair tied up in a ponytail, peeked through the door. “This guy?” She looked Steve up and down and pursed her lips together. “You’ll be out in a week.”
“Stark Industries was once a weapons manufacturer, pioneering in weaponry used during the war. Howard Stark, father of Tony Stark, founded the company. Since then Stark has been a merchant of death. After a tragic incident in which Stark had lifesaving surgery and was fused with his technology he has since managed to worm his way into the NYPD and stopping his weapons manufacturing – it appears that this detective cover was nothing but a façade and is a robot that has clearly fried it’s circuits! Stark has now gone out of control and has built this bot alongside the ruler of Latveria.
“Tony. Tony it is. Goodnight, Tony.” Steve smiled as he spoke, waving to him and walking off to his own room.
No, the thought of Captain America being part of a machine broke his heart. His hero couldn’t be. It wasn’t what he stood for.
“No… Couldn’t sleep either.” Steve said, his eyes drifting from Tony’s pained expression to his wings again. “So… You uh… You’re one of us?”
Steve’s blush remained, even as he used his hand to hide half of his face subtly. Carol gestured the others to disperse and leave them alone, giving them both a wink before heading off with the others.
Steve tilted his head slightly, “They are wings Tony… You know, all this time, I’d forgotten, I’d thought I was having a dream but… I really am an angel.” He said. There was an inflection of disbelief in his voice, as though he couldn’t fully comprehend the fact that he was a soldier of God. But it explained a lot; like those flashes where he would have wings and the flashbacks where he would envision himself in the clouds. It seemed somewhat surreal to actually say that he was an angel, but now that he knew Tony was one too he could openly confess such things, that aside, he would have probably told Tony anyway. They had a special relationship, one where they could tell each other anything in the world.
Sometimes at night, even when Tony would retire to his own quarters, he could hear the haunting screams from the facility. It was highly secured, reinforced by steel; it was impossible for any sound to escape… Yet the raspy shrill shrieks would wake Tony up time and again. He could feel the pain that Steve was going through.
As much as he didn’t want to follow any of Tony’s instructions, part of him knew that Tony wanted the best for his team mates, after all that low inflection in his voice was a tell in its own. He walked in front of Tony, not saying anything but just leading him. He knew better than to just walk out in the open like that, they had to stay close to the walls, staying in the shadows and ducking whenever searchlights came their way.
Steve eased his length into Tony, the head making the man beneath him gasp, then the further length making him cry out in a way Steve had never heard him do before. Tony threw his head back, inhaling as though he were suffocating. Steve’s eyes were focused on his every movement, making sure it wasn’t too much.
The Captain dug his own heels in, barging the armour back. “How did it survive that hit through the chest earlier!?” Steve asked, noting down the huge hole in the armour that was healing itself with wires that weaved in the inner workings of it. It was no longer a suit; it was attempting to build a body, to become real, just as Tony had seen before.
Tony’s eyes darted over to Steve who began to stir and walked over to him, lifting him into his arms again and hugging him close, mainly for his own comfort. It was disturbing to think that this was all some ones lab.
been infatuation. It started with awe, hero worship and the more time they spent together, the more he realised what it truly was. But did he once tell Steve? Yes, in a joking manner. He said he loved him, but unbeknownst to the man, he meant it with all of his heart.
“Nightmares again?” Steve asked as he approached with concern, he hated to see Tony so exhausted, but still, he was in shock, seeing the wings trail behind Tony like that.
“Good as new!” Tony tilted his hat, just so that the little fringe he had could poke out from underneath. “Sometimes you just need a little elbow grease huh?”
The ex-billionaire couldn’t just sit there and watch him suffer, so he rushed forward and placed his hands on Steve’s shoulders, kneeling in front of him. “Come back to me, Steve, please.” There was not a single hesitation in his movement.
He had expected masses of guards to be waiting for them, but instead all he saw were a couple of lab assistants on the computer that turned to face them by swivelling on their chair. Tony bore some sort of insult that they didn’t get to their feet right away.
“No need to say it, Tony,” she growled back, flipping back her long black hair and standing in another stance as she quickly switched targets, alternating once Carol had gotten to her feet too. By this point blood streamed down both of their faces, their uniforms torn and tattered, but Tony had the utmost confidence in their ability even though he knew that they were weakened in their current state; having taken a torrent of abuse from those things and both having had an amateur surgery performed on them. But Tony was glad they were holding strong.
Tony was kissing him so hard and so passionately that he didn’t notice when little projections of beating love-hearts appeared above his head, floating around in a circle, and the second that Steve looped his arms around him and tugged Tony down to deepen the kiss the top of his fedora seemed to open and a huge loud party horn popped out, making a loud noise whilst confetti spewed from it. The corners of Steve’s lips tugged upward into a smile, breaking the kiss with the smallest of chuckles and covering his mouth with a bashful glance at the tin man. His cheeks were tainted with an adorable red blush; the same that matched Tony’s and they exchanged a stare of pure affection and adoration between them. There were no words to explain the relief that that coursed through Tony’s veins.
“YARH!” MODOK yelled in protest, kicking and flailing before his blaster powered up and pummelled Steve back. Tony gasped loudly and used his boots, flying quickly to catch Steve in his arms, keeping him on his feet just barely.
They’d parked outside and used the car’s invisibility function, which was rather handy whilst they left it parked close by, with Steve and Tony standing next to the wall, peering around the corner now and then to make sure that the many security cameras couldn’t catch a glimpse of them.
He stood to his feet with much agony, his damaged stub of a leg making him stumble. Even Norman looked shocked as the armoured hero managed to actually stand.
Steve admired someone that spoke with that much confidence, noticing that proud smirk plastered over Tony’s face.
All angels start somewhere. They stand at the golden gates of heaven, waiting assignment – those are the souls that had passed. However, there are new born angels; ones that need to grow their wings as they start from an infant’s age are cast down into the earth to protect. Many young angels are unaware of being angels, in fact, they believe they are regular human beings until they are summoned back into the heavens to join and take their rightful place in the heavenly host of angels.
Steve stared into the dark sapphire eyes of Tony Stark, trying to convince him that he was an angel, which they both were. Tony’s wings raised a little as he stared back at Steve,
“T’challa, perfect timing.” Tony exclaimed. “Can you step inside the scanner for me? Its acting up lately, and I want to see whether or not it can scan your vitals.”
Tony had luckily found a couple of spare wires in the department store, clearly meant for lighting but they had already been pulled out and exposed from a slab of drywall, so it wasn’t really any harm for Tony to tug these wires out with an appropriate amount of force and use them to help re-wire his reactor to his bionic arm; the wires trailing over his chest and leading directly into his arm, so he had a makeshift repulsor if he needed it, powered by his chest. It didn’t take two seconds to wire, but it meant that as they were walking he was still fiddling with the pieces in his palm, trying to make a direct output to match that of his own armour.
Steve nodded, hand resting over Tony’s shoulder too, walking alongside him and listening to him talk about progress and technology, and how his company was the pioneer for the future, including its progress into prosthetics and augmentations to help those in the medical industry. Though it was all extremely difficult to swallow Steve felt enlightened by the prospects that were introduced to him, and couldn’t wait to learn more – he felt like a sponge willing to soak up everything that was placed in front of him.
“What? That’s impossible.” Tony’s mind was frantic, looking at the mess around him. He didn’t know where to start, and now Reed was missing too. “He can’t be alive.”
Steve moved to block Tony from walking further, standing in front of him and pulling him into a deep, tender kiss with his hand placed just under his sharp goatee, raising it to allow his lips to press against Tony’s. After that brief moment, he returned to Tony’s side and continued to guide him onward. “You’ll have to start your collection all over again.”
But that could all be done as soon as they returned to the confines of the hospital; at least then he could do what he wanted with surgical equipment that was lying around rather than a shard of sharp acrylic. He wanted to do everything he could to prevent causing Steve more pain.
Tony sneered with distain but all Doom did was soak in the reaction with such glory, laughing much louder than before. Tony just couldn’t take it, he couldn’t just stand back and watch Reed being tortured and to see his creations being turned into something darker, something more malicious than he had in mind. He couldn’t bare it any longer and prepared his hand for a blast.
The glowing green eyes of the robot scoured the city, lasers shooting out of it, its huge silver head roaming back and forth as it repeated the same phrase over and over like a broken record. Its vision focused downward at Luke and Danny who were by its feet already, having sprinted their way ahead. Luke cracked his knuckles, laughing already.
The armour stepped closer to Tony, backing him in a corner, but Tony wasn’t just a man in armour – he was more than that. He tried to kick it away, tried to knock it back as it loomed closer and closer, but as he found out first hand; punching a 10,000 tonne robot was probably not the wisest of ideas, especially with his already damaged arm.
“Quiet.” Steve said. Tony nodded, knowing that was their signal for things to be stealthy. If they made a move out of place he knew that either more security would be alerted or the civilians would notice, and that was something they couldn’t afford. Reaching for a bottle that Tony had picked up on their way, he threw it to the other side, hearing it shatter.
A miniscule gasp escaped Steve’s heart shaped lips, the graze along his inner thigh making his hair stand on edge. He was reminded them of their after-mission sessions, locked in the confines of the nearest artillery cupboard in SHIELD HQ, bodies hot, pressed up against one another, passionately kissing one another with intense desperation and relief. It was love if he had ever felt it; nothing else could emulate that warmth in his chest and those butterflies in his stomach whenever he would think about it.
“Yea yea, like the rest of us don’t work.” He replied, shaking his head and inspecting the tree. Luke knew it would look better near the fireplace, but even he feared the wrath of She-Hulk.
Tony laughed, either Steve had a great poker face or he was delusional too, probably from the lack of sleep. “You need some sleep pal.”
He had remembered a small exhort from Reeds research, a possible theory; super soldier serum could have been the catalyst, and Tony remembered that Extremis’ basis was… The super soldier serum.
“Sorry Cap, had to catch some rays.” Tony replies. By this point, Tony is already starting to fire his smart mini-missiles that jut out from a register just over his shoulder, unfolding neatly from their compact hideout after his systems have already locked onto Zola, though fighting the ‘man’ isn’t that easy with the hoard of monstrosities that surge toward Tony out of the tubes that once contained them. Dark demonic creatures that haven’t even got properly formed limbs throw themselves at Tony, trying to take him down while Zola rushes over to the computers.
Tony wanted to touch everything, he needed to touch everything. He couldn’t help but swallow down a huge gulp of pure anticipation, pushing up his chest to show his eagerness, his leg resuming a steady rub up the inseam of Steve’s black trousers. Another shudder is felt from the Captain before his large hands run their way along Tony’s sides, and Tony relaxes in their beautifully secure grip.
That permission couldn’t have come sooner, pushing him right to the edge, and with one final roll of his hips he climaxed with a long drawn moan, completely breathless and exhausted. Steve took that as his cue and once he felt his own tip go as far as it could, as deeply inside Tony as possible, he released. Tony’s body jolted forward quickly to the filling sensation and he moaned from the back of his throat, keeping his lips occupied by placing a series of butterfly kisses along Steve’s strong, square jaw. He appreciated every inch he could; caressing his skin and feeling Steve do the same to him.
“I’m sorry… I’m sorry…” He repeated as he tried to calm his shaking hands, but the thought of having to cut Steve’s legs to replace them was destroying him. That and battling with the fact that Steve was in this entire predicament because of him made things even worse.
Batroc pat his chest and grinned, twirling the tips of his moustache once more. “My reputation will continue to expand as I take this to my employer!” He held up a huge emerald that he’d stolen from the bank vault.
Jessica stared at him, deadpan.  “Looks like you’re prepping for a date. Hurry up, will ya? The longer he’s kept waiting the more he rages, and trust me, no one wants to deal with Chief yelling at us all day… Gives me a headache.”
“All this time Tony, all this time… All you’ve ever done is try and rub your work in my face, well, look who’s laughing now huh?” Hammer laughed from above, craning over Tony’s body and tapping his armour. “Those buzz saws are great aren’t they? Well, I built them with my own two hands, that’s why!”
Love, passion, desperation all melded into that one moment as he poured everything he could into that lock of lips.
“I won’t slack, just give me a cup of coffee in the morning and I’ll be completely fine.” Tony gestured casually, giving Steve’s chest a little tap. “You take care, Cap. Don’t get kidnaped while I’m asleep.”
“Bingo! Seems this racer isn’t going to make it to poll position.” Tony quipped, opening the door of their moving car.
“Stop, Steve, wait!” Tony quickly grabbed Steve’s wrist and stood in front of him protectively, narrowing his own eyes as he watched the figure slowly reveal itself as the smoke subsided. The Green Goblin was taking slow steps out, laughing darkly. The tone he used to laugh made the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck stand up, backing closer to Steve for security. The armoured Captain instinctively huddled closer to Tony, placing an arm on Tony’s.
He pulled back and instantly brushed his face with his metallic palm, trying to hide his face from Steve. “You were trying to kill me earlier, you know.”
Tony squirmed as he was carried off the floor, clutching Steve’s wrist. “Steve! No, Steve!! I love you, please! Remember who you are!” His feet kicked, trying to find a way to push the enhanced Super Soldier away. “Steve, I love you!”
Tony’s dark blue sapphire orbs fixated on the temperature gauge rapidly soaring higher and higher until they reached 50 degrees Celsius. Even with his cooling systems in tact as well as the velocity he was flying at he could still feel minor wisps of heat breach the occasional spot of reveal. This wasn’t his space suit, it wasn’t built for temperatures beyond that of the normal Earth atmosphere, but luckily the wind that was created whilst flying helped cool down the metal; praise physics.
With his eyes fixed on the road, foot pushing on the gas pedal a couple of times to rev up the old engine that seemed to more apt to spit back at him rather than revving (it was an old car, so it took a few tries to get it to purr) before he floored it as hard as he could. The car zipped down the road with Tony sticking his hand out of the window to make a blue alternating light with the one that was in the palm of his glove, sirens blaring as they practically flew down the road.
They scuttled back a little nervously in tandem.  “You don’t have jurisdiction here, Director Stark.” One meek voice of the two spoke.
When the doors closed Tony had run quickly to the observation room and began staring through the glass at the man dressed in red white and blue, be it his casual clothes, still retained his colour scheme with his blue shirt, red and white plaid over-shirt and dark jeans. Steve always had a way of maintaining his patriotism without being too blasé about it. Steve already looked lost; surrounded by that huge room, one lonely man walking that huge space by himself.
Jessica followed holding her hand close to her chest, and Carol limped as she leaned on the other woman for support. There was a momentary exchange between them, a glance of relief and thankfulness glimmering. Carol leaned a little closer, and as Jessica turned her head she felt the light skim of the other woman lips against her cheek, causing her to smile the faintest of smiles.
They had both earned a day off; Tony’s first course of action that day was to take Steve to the finest gallery in the city. Steve couldn’t believe when he saw these masterpieces up close, he was in utter awe of how beautiful everything was up close. Seeing these pieces in person had always been a dream of his, and there Tony was making his dreams come true. Tony was dressed in a rather smart looking suit, of course with his trench coat, but without his signature hat for once. Steve knew that it was probably in the trunk of the car, or hidden somewhere.
“Tony?” Steve sat up, the blood rushing to his head – Tony who was leaning on him rocked a bit, swivelling around on his backside to regain his balance while he was still seated.
“I’m not in the mood today, Steve… It’s been a long and horrible day; I’ve had enough antagonising for a month, and from my best friend. I don’t need it from my… Captain.” He carped.
Steve stood, taking his place by Tony’s side. “You heard him team, we’ll take them down one by one. If you see someone is done, you move on to help your nearest partner. Try and call help too, I’m sure we could get a whole force going if need be, but I don’t want to unnecessarily call for help. Keep in communication, use the radio as much as you can.”
The blond had his eyes settled down on the ground imploringly as though it would give him answers, and Tony noticed the slump in his posture, the line of lips. If anything at that moment locked in this labyrinth of science, Steve Rogers was lost. Although he was a futurist, he was by no means heartless, a little detached but never robotic – he had made a huge effort ever since he had gone through the Extremis process to detach himself from machines in terms of his personality. He had been told by ex-lovers and friends that he was becoming more machine than man, which is why he made a much more conscious effort when the lab assistants returned with what was left of Steve’s possessions, to comfort him.
“I was in the process of trying to find your body, it had taken years, but I was still in search of it. If you weren’t alive well… Then that’ll just mean all your superheroes would be rejected tests. Not to worry though, I would still be in charge, with my chips in place. I would’ve just preferred to have an army, but no worries if I didn’t – I can handle this all by myself.”
Before Tony could reach behind him to say something, the heavy doors slammed shut, the wind pushed Tony’s jacket forward and he was forced to place a hand on his head to help hold his hat down. The sudden gust only made Steve grab onto Tony’s arm protectively, it’s not like a gust of wind could have done much but still, from the second he’d entered this place all he’d wanted to do was look after Tony.
Tony sucked in his cheeks, his calmed content expression fading once the Captain pulled back from the hug. “Hammer, he’d cut off my arm.” He cringed at the memory that was still fresh in his mind, his good hand instinctively reaching for the shoulder of his mechanical arm. “I had to use his drone, made a makeshift augmentation. All that work in prosthetics I was telling you about, you remember that, right?”
Steve was satisfied when he met the dark blue “That’s it.” It was more encouraging; he bit his lower lip and continued to pound into the man, wanting to pleasure him as much as he could. “Come for me.” He whispered.
things happen to his friends in the past. Steve’s limbs were flailing, moving as though they had no bone in them; the muscles were loose and lax. His body quite obviously was swept up by a huge spasm which Tony had never seen post-death.
The sharp tip of the syringe needle caught the light and just as Steve heard a small buzzing sound and turned around, the needle was planted through the tattered fabric of his blue shirt, into his skin at the base of his spine.  Steve let out a shriek like no other, a high pitched yell fused with a scream as the syringe pushed more liquid into his system. Quickly with cat-like reflexes he spun around on his ball of his heel, swinging his foot around and kicking the bot into the wall until it smashed. But he didn’t leave it there, he walked over to it and kicked it again and again with fury, yelling incoherently at the bot; there were no words, just grunts and growls. Tony while stood on the other side of the glass uncontrollably flinched just by reflex each time his bots were thrown and beaten like that.
“Help me put these under the tree.” Steve says firmly, leading the way toward the giant tree and places the bags just carefully over the cracks that were made when She-Hulk threw the three down. He scratches the back of his head and stares at the cracks, then turns to Tony and shrugs, exchanging this ‘you can fix it’ look between him.
Tony’s eyes shut tightly and he began to grind his back teeth together in frustration. The touch to his shoulder wasn’t helping, not really, but there was a part that appreciated the small display of empathy that Reed was showing…especially considering how rare it was for him to show such affection.
Steve was in shock. Of course he was in shock, Tony was kissing him. But it only made his heart race as he moved forward; locking his lips with Tony the instant that he pulled away. The short gap of time made him realise how cold his lips were without that warm touch against them.
“Did you hit your head too hard there, Tony? You’re starting to sound like those sappy soap operas that you enjoy watching.”
“What do you mean malfunctions? Tony, what’s going on? So this is after the bruises are relatively healed?”
The man in the armour tried to make his way to his feet which at this point seemed much easier said than done. He groaned in agony, using the palm of his hand to get to his knees first and trying to ease himself up from there, which certainly wasn’t easy with the clunky armour he was in. One of the downsides about his previous work was that it wasn’t exactly compact and easy to move around in, with much less joints and more thick parts. Easier to repair? Yes. Great mobility? No. Once he was up on his knees things were easier, trying to use some of the rubble from the crater that they’d created to get a little leverage, tugging on a concrete slab that was jutting out of the ground.
“Spider sense. Carol, look ou-!” By the time he spat out his last word, reaching up his hand, the webbing ripped open completely. An army of these entranced people, foaming at the mouth, reached toward Carol and Jessica, mobbing them.
He fell back to his position back on his knees, far too weak to stand. When the dust subsided, he leaned closer to see Steve’s legs. The sight made him queasy; bone jutting out of the knee and the other had been broken beforehand. As he stared at it the flashback of him cracking Steve’s knee flashed before his eyes. The tremble in his body increased tenfold, he held both of his hands up but his focus honed in on the one responsible, the one attached to him from the start; his flesh hand.
Steve didn’t know how to feel at that point, he thought Bucky was dead; in fact he was sure of it. He’d been living this last month trying to grieve over him, and now he was there, right in the flesh. He could feel that light grip, that faint whiff of bubble-gum, the brown haired boy looked like he’d never been to war – the beloved mascot, looking so pristine and well. That was all Steve wanted.
He turned to look over at Steve sleeping, eyes tracing over that delicate silhouette, along the sharp features of his face and admiring how the light from the outside window perfectly hit his jaw to highlight how wonderfully chiselled it really was.  The rattle of the blinds against the window made him jump a little, but he resumed his awestruck vision until he reached Steve’s chest.
Tony could feel his heart drumming again with anxiety when he stepped closer, glancing at Steve who was lying on his mattress clutching his stomach, groaning loudly, writhing with pain. His skin had paled completely and now looked as white a snow, matching his paler eyes which he could only describe as a haunting icy blue.
Steve found himself in a dark room, a small child sat in front of him playing with a couple of toys, mainly sets of little cars, he had about three of them. The curtains were closed but it was as bright as day outside and there was shouting outside too, but that came from the hallway. The boy continued to play quietly,
He cringed as he managed to lift the faceplate from her skin, trails of blood and the same brown fluid he had vomited earlier pulling from the screws he had managed to lodge loose trickled down her beautifully pale skin, rolling down her cheek. He pulled it away with a quivering grip and saw the wire he needed to re-wire, the once billionaire decided to keep his focus on that – at least that would help distract him from the innards of the skull that he’d revealed.
The silence was what scared Tony the most, and his own posture began to stiffen, watching as Steve’s long fingers reached out, touching the metal outline and withdrawing as though he had just touched fire. They reached out again, gently touching the surface, following the shape down to his calf. His expression the entire time remained unchanged, but Tony could see the subtle quivers in his jaw, the slight part in his lips, the distinct furrow of his powerfully shaped eyebrows that twitched with confusion and a clear amount of fear.
“What?” Steve and Tony both asked in sync as they stared up at Janet, with Steve getting Hank into his arms again, ensuring he was cradled comfortably.
Hammer was vindicated, standing above Tony as they unstrapped him, gleaming with pride whilst he took in the sight of the blood still trickling from the wound.
“I don’t have time, I need food I…” He grabbed what he could and cradled it in his arms in a hectic rush, running out of the door. His vision became even more blurred, his breath became fast and then…
Steve cut the signal as he heaved his weight up along the edge of the rooftop to scout the area. There was nothing out of the ordinary that he could spot from that vantage point asides from the factory not too far away that had smoke piping out of its chimneys. Steve knew that factory – he had seen it numerous times in the past, but it had never been lit. It had always been vacant.  An abandoned place for the kids to run to and play in. Truth be told, Steve had never been inside himself, but he had passed by frequently.
He ran toward a car after he made sure the dark haired man was resting against a wall and ripped open the bonnet, staring at all of the wires that had now become unfamiliar.
Tony rubbed his head, feeling the metal finger casings skim through his hair, but that was nothing out of the ordinary. Although he winced the moment his finger ran across the back of his head, instantly withdrawing his hand to stare at his metal fingers.
He could feel the cold metal which made a shiver jolt down his spine, but he eased into it, being nothing like he had ever felt before.  Tony bit his lower lip, “More.” He whispered.
Tony’s eyes widened sharply and he placed both hands on Steve’s chest, trying to push himself away as he felt teeth sinking into his lips, tugging at the flesh before one final bite and—
“Right, power.” The boy glanced from side to side, grabbing Tony’s shoulder and tugging him toward a half collapsed building, obviously one of the worse hit by the explosion. It was completely dark, so once again they were reliant upon the light from Tony’s chest. They both had to walk carefully, sliding through gaps that were blocked off when they finally managed to find their way inside. There were fallen support beams, broken bar lights, shattered windows and collapsed furnishings. Squeezing through the gaps in the hallway was easy for Peter, but much harder for the man who wasn’t wearing streamlined armour, and armour that was much more flexible. He had to force himself through and almost stumbled when he managed to finally push the beams back.
Peter opened his eyes as soon as his spider sense sent a blur of colours through his vision, slipping his mask on and crouching on the bed.
Just as the sensation of freedom was something he was becoming accustomed to he found himself falling, falling further and further and then heard a crash. He groaned, eyes stiffly opening to a blurry haze. He could’ve sworn he saw red white and blue dart across the room and tackle a black silhouette to the ground.
He shook his head. It couldn’t be. Tony had a range of headquarters located everywhere; California, Jersey, even Coney Island.
“Test subjects; you’re a scientist ain’t ya?” Masters moved to do the same sort of surgery on Crossbones, having learned Tony’s technique perfectly merely by observing.
“Stop!” Tony could barely speak whilst Steve used his other hand to tear off the faceplate and threw it to the ground with a fierce intensity. “P-please..!”
“A simulator, Sir. Stark Technology, actually. It’ll allow you to simulate his world in his brain, allow him to live things as they should be if he were back in his time… Tony Stark was the first to invent this tech for training purposes but we’ve since been attempting to develop it, much further than for those purposes alone.”
Bucky stared at the panel that he was trying to distance himself from, watching it start to flare with smoke as Steve slid off the plane, expecting Bucky to do the same. “You’re right Cap! I see the fuse! It’s gonna blow!”
“No!” Tony exclaimed before forcing himself to quieten his voice. “I mean…” Ehem. “No. The pigment of his skin is continuing to change and become paler than before… I assume that’s the lack of blood, right?“
The three of them stood at the open door, waiting for the signal to move. Gusts of wind pushed back Janet initially, but she sped up the pace of her wings to resist.
The truth was the last thing he could remember was thinking about being trapped. How much he hated being trapped and confined, how much he craved the scent of fresh air and freedom that he stood for. He felt a stir of emotions before it all became blurred into one; being attacked by Zola, being constantly tormented but just wanting to help people and knowing that he was useless when he was trapped, wanting Tony to free him, pleading with Tony, screaming for him to let him go and then a harsh pain surged through his stomach and the next thing he knew he was punching the wall.
“Shut up for a second, Tony.” She whispered but still with that hard tone in her voice but the last word was filled with bitterness for a reason unbeknown to the man she was talking to.
Tony tried to catch Peter up a bit and walk side by side rather than behind him, but whenever he did the boy would pick up his pace and ensure that he was ahead.
Tony ducks his head, Steve’s comment warming something in his chest. “Thanks,” he says quietly. “I tried to go back to the tower, but—”
An easy smile crosses Steve’s face, like it used to on the days Tony was with him and sober, the days when Tony thought he could stay clean if he had Steve. That was always doomed to fail, Tony knows that now. He had to get clean for him, not for someone else, even if that someone else had been the love of his life.
,” Steve chokes out as Tony takes more of Steve’s cock in his mouth. “So good, Tony. So good for me.”
“Soon,” Steve says as he pulls out almost entirely before slamming back into him. “I just—you look so gorgeous like this, sweetheart. All of this for me, and I—” Steve’s losing track of his thoughts as he fucks Tony, part of him wanting to drag this out for as long as possible, but the rest of him needing to come. He wants to spend time taking Tony apart, but there’s a familiar feeling low in his groin that’s engulfing him. “Tomorrow,” he says, his voice rough. “I’m gonna spend the whole day in bed with you, but I—”
Tony’s there when Steve finally gets back to the tower, sitting on the couch with a tablet in his hand and Steve lets himself be grateful for the fact he has someone to come home to, even if it’s—. Well. Complicated. He walks over and sits on the couch, slumping back against the cushions. Fiddling with the watch he takes it off and drops it in Tony’s lap. “Thanks,” he says.
“No,” Steve says honestly. “But it has to be done.” He looks around the table, meeting everyone’s eyes as he does. “Look, I wasn’t prepared for this at all. If you’re feeling betrayed, I get it, and I’m sorry I kept it from you all, but I needed to know as many details as I could find before I brought it to you.”
“Me too,” Steve says, watching Tony carefully as they both fall quiet. He can feel his skin heating up as he waits, knowing Tony won’t ignore the implications of what he’s said.
“No,” Steve says, pressing a finger against Tony’s mouth softly before taking it away once Tony quiets. Inching closer on the bed, Steve leans in, resting a hand on Tony’s leg. “I don’t want to forget any of what you said.”
“I want you to,” Steve says, finally meeting Tony’s eyes. “But I—I haven’t shared a bed with anyone in a long time, and I still get nightmares sometimes. Seems unfair to subject you to that just because—”
“And the rest of it?” Steve asks, glancing at Tony. “Hydra? SHIELD? It’s not like the war, this feels more—”
“Would you come with me?” Steve asks, looking down at the table instead of at Tony because he’s afraid of what he might see on Tony’s face. Judgement, maybe, or pity. Neither of which he’s comfortable being on the receiving end of. “To see her, I mean.”
It calms down, mostly, once people realise it’s not an attack, and the crowd starts to thin out, putting their phones away and leaving. Steve takes a breath and looks around at the small crowd that remains, the injured being treated, trying to tamp down on the adrenaline still running through his body in anticipation of a fight that never really came.
Plus, Steve gets to see Tony kneeling on the floor with the kids building something out of the blocks they have, he gets to see Tony with a toddler on his hip because the kid had reached his arms up and said “up?” in a soft voice. It leaves him with a tight feeling in his chest that he’s too scared to identify.
,” he cries out, the paddle coming down on his ass harder than before, and it’s all Tony can do to stay on his feet.
Steve’s so overwhelmed by the offer he doesn’t know what to say, and the only thing he can think to do is lean in and cut off Tony’s apologetic rambles with a kiss. Their
Taking a deep breath, Steve pushes open the door Tony had closed behind him, and then he sees her, Peggy. Sitting up in bed in a blue nightgown, her grey hair styled perfectly, a little bit of lipstick that he’s sure Tony must’ve helped her put on. She still looks beautiful to his eyes.
“You’re getting off on this,” Tony says, his hands resting on the waistband of his sweatpants as he stands in front of Steve.
“Don’t,” Steve says. “God, Tony, you don’t have to apologise, when I realised you were gone I didn’t—” he breaks off and shakes his head. “I had no idea what to do.”
Steve sucks gently at Tony’s bottom lip, feeling himself start to recover, and he reaches down between them, wrapping a hand around Tony’s still hard cock. “And what about this?”
“Don’t you dare,” Steve says. He’s right in front of Tony now, so close that Tony could count every freckle on his face. “Tony, I—” Steve sighs, his hand coming up to cup Tony’s cheek. “Stop me if you—”
Steve finds Tony in the kitchen, bags of something that smells good scattered on the breakfast bar, along with groceries that Tony appears to be putting away. “Please tell me you slept,” Steve says, wincing when Tony bangs his head against the fridge door.
“I don’t know,” Steve says with a heavy sigh. “She says she’ll learn to be comfortable, but that’s—she shouldn’t have to do that.”
Tony frowns before it dawns on him what Steve’s saying. “Are you telling me you were running shirtless to get my attention?” Tony asks, feeling Steve freeze. “Steve?”
They take their mugs into the living room of the compound, along with a plate of cookies, and settle down on the couch, FRIDAY switching the christmas tree lights on. There’s a small stack of gifts under the tree that have appeared over the last few days, including some sent from Natasha that look like they’ve passed through several different countries.
Tony looks at him, his eyes glinting in the glow from the string lights on all the stalls. “You were doing it in the name of something.”
Leaning in, Steve catches Tony’s mouth in a kiss. It’s not like the market, this time Tony’s ready for it, and Steve doesn’t hold back, putting everything he feels into it. Tony’s hands are clutching desperately at Steve’s shirt, his fingers pressing against the muscles of Steve’s back, and Steve wants more, wants to feel Tony’s talented hands all over him. It’s intoxicating, being able to have Tony like this, really have him, to hear his little gasps as they kiss, to nip at his bottom lip and feel a shiver run down his body.
“Yeah,” Steve says, feeling comforted by the length of Tony’s body next to him after his long day. “This is good.”
Tony’s squirming on the bed, and Steve can only take watching him like this for so long. Removing his fingers, Steve slicks his cock up and hooks Tony’s legs around his body before he leans over him, catching his mouth in a kiss. “And only you get me like this.”
“You can’t just—” Tony cuts himself off and kisses Steve firmly before pulling back and meeting Steve’s eyes. “That’s cheating.”
“You know how,” Steve says, smoothing a finger along Tony’s cheek, rubbing the last of it in. “But I—” Steve drops his gaze and shakes his head. “I shouldn’t.”
Steve slips a bookmark between the pages and puts the book down, shifting his legs out of the way as Tony sits on the couch. “Sam’s gone home for Christmas, Natasha left this morning to go... somewhere, I didn’t ask and she didn’t tell me.”
,” Tony groans, his body squirming on the sheets as Steve keeps fucking him with his fingers. “Steve, I—it’s always been you,” he says with a low laugh. “Who do you think made me realise I liked men? That when I wanted to get fucked it was always by someone blonde and buff? I didn’t even know you were alive, but—it’s you, Steve. It’s always been you.”
Steve laughs before he rolls them over. Looking down at Tony, he lowers his head and kisses him. “Hey,” he says, pulling back a little. “Happy Halloween.”
Steve walks into the tower, sweat dripping down the back of his neck from his run, and he makes his way to the kitchen on the communal floor. The sun’s barely up so he doesn’t expect to see anyone in there, but instead everyone’s in there, and it’s only the fact that Tony’s there, half asleep and slumped on the table that stops him from turning on his heel and heading to his own floor.
“No,” Steve says, relaxing a little. “It’s not that, I—I’m committed. To you, I mean. I love you, you know that.”
“The Winter Soldier,” she says, unconsciously curling into herself a little. “Most people in my line of work don’t believe he exists, but he does. I’ve met him more than once, he’s very real. The last time I saw him, he shot through me to get to his target. If there’s anyone that could be what you’re looking for, then it’s him.”
Steve rolls his eyes and throws a balled up napkin at her. “How about we leave my personal life out of this?”
“Shit,” Tony says, his grip on the flowers tightening. “She died? I didn’t—fuck. Steve, I’m sorry. I should’ve been there.”
“You know I do,” Tony says, trying to rock his hips, wanting the friction against his cock, wanting his ass spanked raw, wanting everything Steve is willing to give him. “Steve,” he gasps, pushing back against Steve’s hand that’s keeping him in place. “
Going down in the ice wasn’t easy, but when he made that choice, he didn’t have to see the fallout for the people around him. The ones he spent every day with in the war, the people he loved and cared for. He didn’t have to live with the knowledge of causing that pain.
“How many lives have you saved by now?” Steve asks, grabbing Tony by the sleeve and tugging him over to a quiet spot by the stall selling garlands. “Tony, there’s no cosmic balance sheet. We make choices and live with the consequences, and we try to make the best decisions we can with the information we have. That’s all we can do.”
“Spurious allegations,” Tony says as he hands Adam back to her. “Disgraceful behaviour from one of my most treasured engineers.”
Steve’s mind is still stuck on the perfect match comment when Tony hands him the hot chocolate piled high with mini marshmallows and he almost stumbles over his own feet as they walk away. The market is fairly busy, but they go unnoticed, browsing the stalls as they make their way through the crowds.
“I do,” Steve says, before he finishes his drink and puts his mug down on the counter. “Come on, let's get you cleaned up and in bed. We could both do with some sleep.”
“You know I’m with you,” Tony says, kissing Steve’s cheek before rubbing away the cream cheese with a sheepish smile.
“Not like I haven’t done it before,” Steve says with a small shrug. “Really, it’s okay. There’s food in the fridge, the decorations are up, and I’ve got more than enough things to keep me occupied.”
Steve looks around, taking in the people from town walking around, laughing and enjoying time with their friends, the kids on the mini ice skating rink holding onto penguins to stay steady, and the teenagers drinking hot chocolate and sharing fresh donuts. “No,” he says hoarsely as he turns back to Tony. “It’s a lot, Tony.”
“I know,” Tony blurts out. “I know,” he repeats, quietly. Taking a breath he looks at Steve standing there, waiting for an answer and the realisation hits him like a lightning bolt. “I do,” he says. “I trust you.”
“Hey,” Tony says, nudging Steve with his elbow. “I know this was your idea, but if you don’t want to be here—”
“Luca, you’re embarrassing me,” Tony says eventually, fiddling with the silverware. “How about you bring us whatever’s good tonight and go harass some other customers.”
“That I don’t want to push you,” Steve says, so quietly that Tony can barely hear the words over the waves in the background. “That I don’t want to rush this and have us regret moving too fast. That when I finally get you in a bed I want to take my time.”
“Where did you end up for rehab?” Steve asks as he washes the dishes, having insisted on doing so since Tony cooked. “If you want to tell me.”
“SHIELD kept this one pretty under wraps,” Clint says. “Unless there’s a leak, not sure how it happened.”
Steve would swear there’s an audible click at the end of that, even though he knows phones don’t do that anymore, and he looks at Tony. “Guess that conversation with Nat is going to have to wait. Along with breakfast.”
Steve raises an eyebrow before he shifts on the bed, lowering his head and taking Tony’s cock into his mouth. There’s not much of a difference in this that Steve can tell, and he sticks to what he knows Tony likes, slowly teasing the head with his tongue, until Tony’s hand is pulling at his hair.
“Inventions wait for no vacation,” Tony says, putting his tablet down on the small rickety table by his side. “What’s with the blanket?”
“Pierce showed him to me, the day before he attacked us,” Steve says. “I don’t know if that means Pierce no longer believes I’m part of them, or if it was a test to see—”
“Well, they don’t need to know that you don’t know,” Tony says. “And like I said, you won’t be alone. Just, and I realise the irony of me saying this, but be careful.”
“Thank you,” Steve says. “You know, I’m not sure you’ll want to hear it, considering everything, but without your weapons I would’ve ended up a lot worse. My men were able to cover me and drag me to safety because of your work.”
“I can, if that would make you more comfortable,” Steve says as he puts the paper down after drawing an arrow at the top of the sheet. “I’ve done it before for high profile clients. How soon do you want to get started?”
“I want to tell them,” Steve says, running a hand over his hair. “I do, but it feels too early, I need more information, a plan, something more than what I have.”
“No, it’s—I’ve been thinking about it since I woke up,” he says. “I loved Peggy, but I don’t know if we would’ve had a life together if I hadn’t gone in the water. I don’t know how we would’ve worked. I wanted it to, I really did, but back then I was a symbol, and—” Steve breaks off, his eyes starting to sting. “I don’t mean to put this on you,” he says. “I haven’t talked to anyone about this, I don’t even know how to put it into words.”
“Right,” Steve mumbles, ducking his head and carrying on working on Tony, his hands a little firmer against Tony’s body. “Okay.”
“You’re coming like this,” Steve says, and Tony can hear the slight strain in his voice that says he’s close to coming as well. “No touching, just my cock in your ass.”
.” Steve’s thumb swipes over the head of Tony’s cock, and Tony’s so far gone that that’s all it takes to wrench his orgasm from him and he comes hard, his mouth open against Steve’s neck, breathing heavily.
“Hey, I’m the last one to judge,” Tony says. “If all you want is to get it out, I’ll sit here and work and ignore everything you say.”
There’s all kinds of ways Steve could respond to that, but all he does is offer Tony a sweet smile and pull him in close, and Tony goes with it, letting Steve manhandle him until they’re curled up together on the bed. Steve’s hand is still tangled with his, and Tony shifts until he can press a kiss against the underside of Steve’s jaw before settling back down and resting his head against Steve’s chest.
“Yeah, right, okay.” Tony pauses for a second before he strips his shirt off and stands there trying to quell his anxiety at the thought of someone seeing the mess of scars around the arc reactor. The arc reactor, he—well, it is what it is, and the only reason he tends to hide it is because he knows there’s too many people who would want to take it. But the scars are different. No one’s seen them, except Obie, and the less Tony thinks about that, the better. Tony knows they’re ugly, there’s no getting away from the gnarled marks curling out from the arc reactor across his chest, and he hates how vulnerable they make him feel.
Steve ushers him out of the bathroom and nods towards the bed. Tony doesn’t immediately obey, though, instead stopping and dropping the towel on the floor before tugging a pair of cosy sweatpants on. When he turns around, Steve’s neck is flushed red, and Tony feels a weird flutter in his chest as he looks at him.
Steve picks up the mug of coffee on the side and takes a sip. “Guess we’re both as pathetic as each other,” he says, smiling at Tony over the rim of his mug.
“Oh look at you two under the mistletoe,” comes a voice from behind them, and they turn around to see the trader smiling at them. “Go on, have a kiss.”
“Well he’s sure as hell trying to kill you!” Tony yells as he fires repulsors at Bucky, swearing when Bucky dodges more of them than he takes.
Once the tattoo has been wrapped up and Steve’s reminded Tony of the aftercare instructions, Tony carefully slides his t-shirt back over his head and picks up his jacket, shifting from foot to foot as he watches Steve start to clean up. “Do you want me to pay and go?” Tony asks, eventually.
“Hey,” says the man behind the counter, pulling Tony’s attention from the art on the walls. “How can we help?”
When Steve wakes up the next morning to pale light coming through his windows, he squints at the dusting of snow outside, and for a moment his half awake brain wonders if this is Tony’s doing before he realises how cold it is. “FRIDAY, can you turn the heating up?” Steve asks as he walks into his bathroom, his bare feet on tile only amping up his coldness despite the heated floors Tony installed throughout the compound. After brushing his teeth, he strips his clothes off and gets into the shower, the hot water spraying down on him going some way to warming him up.
“Ugly Christmas sweaters, check,” Tony says, turning to put the eggs away. “I went into town,” he continues. “Did we know a bakery had opened up?”
“They’re not going to take it well,” Steve says, looking over at Tony sitting cross legged on the bed. “That we didn’t tell them, I mean.”
“Steve—” Tony instinctively pushes back against Steve’s finger, despite how sensitive and fucked out he is, and he groans when Steve removes it.
“You’re getting out of bed—wait, what?” Steve looks over at Tony who is very studiously avoiding his eyes. “You bought me clothes?”
“It’s okay that I did this, right?” Tony asks suddenly, sitting up and dislodging Steve’s arm. “Organised it without telling you? You’d tell me if it wasn’t?”
He still tries, though, and a few weeks after moving in, Steve comes back to the tower from being harassed by the press yet again and he heads down to Tony’s workshop. When he gets there, he kicks his shoes off and practically throws himself on the couch, groaning loudly in frustration.
“I do,” Steve says, his eyes prickling with unshed tears. “I really do. Shit, Tony, I—” Steve breaks off and laughs wetly. “Sorry, I don’t—”
“This helps,” Steve says as he holds their hands up for a moment before bringing them back down. “You—knowing that you’re here with me, it helps. And I’m trying.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, leaning back a little to meet Steve’s eyes. “Sounds good.” Moving to put his coffee mug down, Tony takes the bowl from Steve’s hand and slips back into his arms. “But maybe not right now,” Tony says, smiling up at him.
The appointment with Steve creeps up on Tony quicker than he anticipated, and it feels like all too soon that Tony’s standing across the street from the tattoo parlour again. Steve’s already waiting, and Tony hurries over.
Steve rolls his eyes as he walks over to the bed and quickly cleans them both up, hushing Tony’s protests with soft kisses. Dropping the washcloth on the floor, he pulls Tony into his arms and kisses the side of his head. “Thank you,” he says.
“Yes, I make all my making out decisions based on Clint,” Steve says, smiling when Tony laughs. “No, I—I’d just like to spend some time with you before I have to deal with Pierce.”
“As long as you know I’m not taking any responsibility for this,” Steve says, finishing his coffee. “At all.”
“I didn’t know you before the war,” Tony says carefully. “I like the person I’ve got to know these past few weeks. But I know what it’s like to not be the same person you were. What happened in Afghanistan changed me and, honestly you wouldn’t have liked the person I was before that.” He pauses, looking at Steve’s reflection in the mirror. “I didn’t like the person I was before that,” he adds in a quieter tone.
Tony offers him a tight smile. “No, it’s not that,” he says. “Contrary to popular belief I don’t need people fawning over me, but I, uh. I have this thing in my chest, and anyone tattooing me would need to know.”
Tony pauses, the spaghetti spilling into the water with a loud rush of noise. Putting the box back on the counter, he turns to see Steve looking at him through his lashes. “It’s not a—”
“And I’m glad you think so,” Tony says, tilting his head and looking up at Steve. “But me today and me back then are very different kinds of hot. You’ve seen the photos of me at clubs back then.”
“Haven’t thought about it,” Tony says. “I’ll have work for SI, and Morgan will need me, but other than that? I have no clue.”
Tony’s body is already vibrating from need when the first hit from Steve comes, and he whines, wriggling under Steve’s hand in an attempt to push his ass back, wanting more. “Steve, I—”
“I hated myself back then,” Tony says simply. “And being back in that body, thinking about what I was like, it’s—”
Letting out a low rumble of a laugh, Steve rids himself of the rest of his clothes, tucking his shoes neatly underneath the couch, and he stands there fully nude as Tony looks him over. “Now you,” Steve says, closing the gap between them and sliding his hands underneath Tony’s hoodie, only finding bare skin. “Can’t shower in all this.”
Tony pauses for a moment before he joins Steve on the bed, tentatively resting a hand on his back. “Did I say something wrong?”
“You look—” Steve breaks off as his fingers sneak underneath Tony’s sweater, seeking out his warm skin. “Really good.”
But now—Tony can’t even believe Steve’s still here. Then again, maybe Steve just wanted to make sure Tony didn’t die in his sleep after last night, and is here to tell Tony he’s leaving.
Steve suppresses a sigh as they pull into the garage, Tony switching the engine off. The silence is overpowering and he watches Tony’s hands tighten on the steering wheel before letting go.
“Not too fond of it myself,” Tony says quietly, enjoying the feel of Steve’s touch on his skin. “There’s a bottle in the top left hand drawer, it’s the only one with my real name on it.”
“Because,” Tony interrupts in a rush before Steve can finish. “I’d want more from you. I’d want you. All of you. And I know you’re not interested, I get that, but—”
“Dirty old man,” Tony says as he pushes down his sweatpants, kicking them off to the side before he climbs on Steve’s lap. “What do you want, huh? Want to hold me down on the bed? Get off on how much smaller I am now? Want me to ride you? Hold my hips tight as you fuck me?”
“You know,” Tony says, as he follows Steve into the apartment, pulling the door closed behind him. “When you said your place wasn’t far from the shop, I didn’t think you meant upstairs.”
“Your biology is missing a few vital components here, but sure, we can practice,” he says before catching Tony’s mouth in a deep kiss, one hand coming up to cup the back of Tony’s head. Steve’s never going to get tired of the taste of Tony, the soft play of their mouths against each other, the way that Tony always sinks into the kiss like it’s everything he’s ever needed.
“That’s fair,” Tony says, his hands holding onto the back of a chair. He can’t say that wouldn’t have been the outcome. If Steve had called at the wrong time, when Tony was blitzed out of his mind, then it’s entirely possible Tony would’ve laughed at him. Would’ve been crueler than Steve ever would’ve deserved. “I’m sorry for that as well.”
Tamping down on the emotions flowing through his mind, Steve gets out when the elevator reaches the parking garage and, as much as he wants to call Tony, instead he switches his phone off and gets into the car.
Steve runs his hands down Tony’s body and pulls him close, enjoying the rush of having all of Tony’s naked skin against him for the first time. Part of him thinks this should be awkward, that maybe there should be some hesitancy, but all Steve can think is that this is right, that being here with Tony like this is exactly where he’s meant to be.
“I have to,” Tony says. “After—when I found out what the company had been doing behind my back, I rooted out everyone who had a hand in it, but I’m still not sure I got them all. We have bases across the world and I personally oversaw getting everyone who was connected to Obie out of my company any way that I could. Created a lot of enemies doing it, but I knew what I had to do. I knew what was right. Just like I know what we have to do with SHIELD. We take down Pierce, and we don’t stop until we’ve got rid of everything to do with Hydra, even if that means burning SHIELD to the ground.”
“Pierce wants to see you,” Rumlow says quietly, but with all the confidence that Steve will be able to hear him. “Tonight. You’ll get a text with the information.”
Tony’s done this with a lot of people, he’s not ashamed of that, but it’s never felt so all enveloping the way it’s feeling with Steve, and part of him is a little terrified at that. The rest of him wants to sink to his knees and feel Steve’s hand on the back of his neck. Breaking away, Tony brushes his lips over Steve’s mouth, smiling when Steve whines a little. “Can I—” Tony pauses. “I want to blow you.”
,” Tony grunts as the blankets twisted around his ribcage tug too tightly against his bruised skin. “Shit,” he says, taking in a sharp breath as he detangles himself from the blankets, forgetting that he’s naked underneath them. When he looks up, Steve’s very carefully not looking down, a light flush across his face, and that reaction almost makes Tony’s headache vanish.
“I don’t want you to end up hurting yourself because you’re too tired to function,” Steve says. “I want you to be safe.” Steve’s not sure how to take being compared to Pepper. He doesn’t exactly mind, given that she’s an exceptionally capable woman, but there’s an underlying meaning to it he can’t quite parse. His thoughts are cut off by the elevator opening, and he gestures at Tony to go ahead.
“Tonight,” Steve says, catching Tony’s hand where his fingers have been unconsciously running up and down Steve’s thigh. “Short notice again.”
“Greedy,” Steve says, his fingers grazing over Tony’s ass, pressing against the already reddening skin. “Do you think you deserve it?”
Steve nods. “You’re right,” he says, watching as Tony gets up and walks over, sinking down into the couch with him. “What do you think I should do?”
“Oh, I’m terrified,” Tony says. “But we could figure it out together, if you want. Sounds like we’re both as pathetic as each other right now, so—”
“Oh,” Steve says, this broken sound that Tony doesn’t think he’s ever heard come out of Steve’s mouth before. “I can—I’ll—”
Swallowing, Steve flicks through the other photos, his eyes catching on one of Tony on a bed, sheets rumpled underneath him, his hair messy and the look on his face familiar to Steve because he’s seen it more times than he can count in their bed. Tony’s own hand is on his crotch, stroking himself through the black lace, and Steve wonders how it felt, if Tony got off on that alone, if he soaked the lace through with his come.
“I’m different,” Tony says. “Better, I think. Trying to be, anyway. My life isn’t the same. I don’t go to parties, events. There’s no big business meetings. Occasionally I have to attend a product launch, but this, here, is about as exciting as my life gets now.”
“No,” Steve interrupts, knowing exactly what Tony is about to ask. “I don’t wish you were like this all the time.”
“I don’t know what that reason could be,” Steve says, his mind turning over the information that they do have. “I—we made deals, didn’t we? America, I mean, after the war?”
And with that, it’s like Tony’s world is completely narrowed to only Steve. He feels like a damn teenager again, or what he assumes most teenagers feel like, his teenage years were spent in a fucked up haze he’d rather not remember but this—. It’s the hottest thing Tony’s experienced in a long goddamn time, even with the morning’s earlier activities fresh in his mind.
“You bring it out in me,” Steve says, resting back on his heels, a soft smile crossing his face. “I know we’ve only just started this, and I know that you—”
“And it looks like you’re already in the festive mood,” Tony says, looking Steve up and down. “You look cosy. Like something out of a Hallmark movie.”
Steve furrows his brow. “I could do that,” he says slowly. “I’d need help from people with more experience than me, but I’d like to do that.”
That evening they settle in at Tony’s house, Steve only going back to his to grab some food and clothes. It’s turning into a cool night as the sun goes down, and Steve’s poking at some fish on the grill while Tony sits back on an Adirondack chair, his feet resting in the sand as he drinks a margarita.
Breaking the kiss, Steve reaches for the lube and slides down between Tony’s legs. Tony’s cock is already starting to fill again, and Steve presses a sloppy kiss against the base before he shifts, kneeling with Tony’s legs either side of him. Slicking up his fingers, Steve presses one against Tony’s hole and slowly pushes it in, watching the reaction on Tony’s face.
“We don’t have to go far out, and if you want to come back to shore, we’ll come back,” Steve says, dropping his hand and walking out of the water to Tony. “Hey?”
“Well, Adam likes you,” Tony says, looking back down at the baby, leaning against Steve’s side. “Don’t you, kiddo? Christ, how do they make them this small? Look at his nose, it’s obnoxiously cute. Cynthia you’re going to have to keep this kid out of the office, I’ll end up giving him anything he wants.”
“Not—christ, do you get a lot of people coming in here showing you their dicks?” Tony asks before holding a hand up and shaking his head. “Wait, don’t answer that. Sam said there was a private room? Could we talk there?”
There’s a look on Tony’s face that passes before Steve can interpret it, and he ducks his head. “So,” Tony says, tapping his fingers against the table. “Since I’ve done all the hard work this morning while you slept in—”
Of all the people Tony thinks might turn up at his door, his ex is not one of them. “Steve? What are you—” Tony pauses, taking in the sight of Steve standing at his door, noticing the uniform, and he shakes his head in understanding. “The calendar,” he says. “Mrs Davies said that—hi.”
Tony feels his cheeks flushing as he tries to avoid asking for what he wants, and he ducks his head, tucking his face against Steve’s neck.
“That’s because you’re always losing them,” Steve says. “I hope I got Dum-E and U right, I tried to sketch them when I was down there, but I couldn’t bring the canvas down there without ruining the surprise, so—”
Steve laughs and picks up the stencil, holding it out to Tony. “The numbers are in the petals, but they won’t get lost when I add colour, I promise. If you’d prefer them on a banner, I could—”
Steve doesn’t move a muscle until the elevator reaches its destination, and when the doors open, Pierce is there to meet him. Stepping out of the elevator, Steve shakes Pierce’s hand when it’s offered but otherwise doesn’t say a word, quietly following Pierce as he leads him towards a desk. Pierce takes the seat behind it and gestures to the other one, but Steve ignores it. Instead he checks his watch like Tony told him, and puts pressure on the sides to activate it before he finally meets Pierce’s steady gaze.
Huffing out a laugh, Tony opens his eyes to see Steve smiling at him like they’ve never been apart. Tapping his fingers against the curve of Steve’s hip, Tony sighs. “So,” he says. “Where do we go from here?”
Tony groans as Steve idly works his finger in and out of him. He’s not going to get hard again so soon, but it’s making a low level of pleasure spark through his body, just enough to make him feel all kinds of warm.
It’s not a rough day, not any more than usual, but Tony—his head won’t stop spinning, it won’t shut up, and usually, okay, he can deal with it. He can. But he knows he needs something extra today, something that’ll make his brain quiet down. It’s been buzzing all the way through the meeting, Steve talking about training drills and about upgrades to the flyers programming that Tony had implemented. Tony tries to contribute to the discussion, he does, it’s just that his goddamn brain won’t shut up.
“For doing this with me,” Steve says quietly. “Taking on Hydra. Trusting me. Everything that you’ve been doing.”
It should be embarrassing, Tony thinks, the way his stomach feels like the cliche of butterflies when Steve turns up at his door after his run, but when Steve takes his hand as they walk down to the beach, Tony can’t bring himself to care. He thinks maybe he’s earnt a little goofiness.
Steve snorts, his hand lightly trailing down Tony’s spine. “Stress,” he says. “When you get rid of the stress you can sleep. I’m hungry, though.”
“It was,” Tony says, looking up from the machine. “Some people think there’s a big come to Jesus moment after hitting rock bottom, but that’s bullshit. At least, it was bullshit for me,” he says, grabbing some mugs and pouring the coffee in. “I hit rock bottom so many times I could’ve racked up frequent flyer miles. I—I had to make the choice for myself. Which I did, eventually.”
“Thank you,” Steve says, leaning back in his chair, keeping his gaze on Tony. “What do you think I should do about SHIELD?”
There’s part of him that’s terrified to see her. A part of him that worries that maybe seeing him will cause her a kind of pain that Steve’s not ready to be responsible for.
“So Fury probably isn’t involved,” Tony says. “I guess that’s something. But, still, if Pierce is involved this goes all the way to the top. Shit. You know, sometimes I wish I were wrong.”
Loud gunfire from the tv makes Tony press his face against Steve’s chest like he’s trying to ignore it, but Steve can hear the tick of Tony’s heartbeat picking up as he slowly awakens. Steve tries to hold still, his eyes fixed on watching John and Holly reuniting as Tony smushes his face against Steve’s pec.
