Tony shook his head, “Your home, Steve.”
Sam sighed, “Whatever you need, Doc.”
Steve was about to argue that he was the one to give the orders but Bucky interrupted them, eyes back on the warehouse.
“You could come like this, couldn’t you?” Steve bit out, pressing firmly back into Tony to hear that little whimper that escaped his throat. “That’s how much you want me.”
Steve started unwrapping his other hand just for something to do, “Yeah, he knew. Told me not to worry about it. The Captain was the only thing that mattered. He taught me a lot, and we were making a difference to our own streets. There is something seductive about that, seeing the change right in front of you effecting people you know. Phillips got too bold and too cocky. I watched him make mistake after mistake that he was blind to because he thought the power would protect him.”
“I believe he cares for you deeply,” Thor leaned forward, elbows on the table, “And I know he cares for all of us. I’ve never known him to think of himself over any of us.”
“You’re trying to tell me my cops had gunpowder under their nails?” Fury asked, “How does that explain Hydra’s behind it?”
“Look, Steve made his feelings perfectly clear, okay? You don’t need to a babysit me. I’m not going to sell him out because he hurt my feelings.” Tony told her, if he had wanted that then he would have told Rhodey everything but even now, even when he was hurting, he was still protecting Steve.
When Steve met Fury, it was after lunchtime and Fury had ushered him around the back of the stationhouse and in through a side door. He was all business in his black suit, badge hanging around his neck as he scanned his ID card for access and led Steve into the lower levels of the police station.
Steve cocked an eyebrow as a car crawled into the open clearing, pencilled in by large shipping crates on all sides. A maze of privacy and steel that would allow them to discuss business without being found. He crossed his arms over his chest, leaning back against his motorbike with a look of boredom etched into his features as the car in front of him stopped and the back door opened.
There was a steady ooze of liquid from his temple that he already knew was blood. He’d been hit by Howard enough to know the sensation well. His back was killing him, but his attacker was already getting to his feet as well, one hand clutching his side.
Rumlow looked up at Steve’s arrival, face relaxed behind the scar running down the length of it. He gave Steve a challenging smile, one the spoke of confidence and arrogance. The same smile Rumlow had worn in the army.
“I know.” Tony replied, fingers carding through the strands of hair curling on Steve’s neck.
The paperwork did look iron-clad, from what Steve could see it was a legally drawn up agreement between the ‘named individual’ and the NYPD office, under the authority of one Detective Inspector Nicholas J. Fury. All that was missing were the names of the second party and a signature at the bottom. Fury had clearly come through for him after all, in his hands were a get out of a jail free card. A way for the team to walk away from this mess with Hydra without facing jail time.
Bucky did as instructed, pushing Sitwell’s face against the headlight with his palm on his head as Steve made his way over, “Hope he didn’t give you any trouble?” He asked Natasha, never taking his eyes off the coward in Bucky’s grip.
Steve softened slightly, Bucky’s anger giving way to pain, “We’ll deal with Hydra. We’ll handle the cops. That’s my focus. I promise you. But this thing with Tony, it isn’t up for negotiation. I don’t need your approval, but I would like your support.”
Now, with all those eyes on him as he trailed a path from one end of the living room to the other Steve found himself feeling more like a caged animal backed into a corner.
“This is how
“It’s not okay, Tony.” Steve insisted.
Pierce gurled, trying to say something but he didn’t manage to form the words. Steve nodded, tucking the knife back in place and grabbing the phone Pierce had dropped earlier. He tucked it into his pocket to look at later. Then he stood up, smoothing out his jacket and running a hand through his hair as he looked down at Pierce, still groaning on the floor. A thick plume of red against the stark white snow.
Steve shook his head, what had Ross done? Had he hurt Tony? Threatened him?
Fury sighed, “Just give me some time, okay. Let me find a way to spin this. Don’t act, don’t go after Hydra. If there is another way out, I’ll find it, but I need you to lay low. You and your team need to be squeaky clean for this to work.”
Rumlow. He’s voice was gruffer, angrier than Steve could remember but it was him. The same husk to his speech unmistakable even over the phone.
“I have Thor at the docks right now, I’ll see what he finds and go from there. I think it’s Hydra though. It has to be.”
He expected something more than this. Blood, violence. He expected a gunshot wound or an explosion. That’s how it was supposed to happen. Gunfire and glory, that’s what they thought in the army anyway.
Sitwell seemed to glance her up and down for a moment, and Steve wondered if he was checking for a weapon before he spoke, “Let’s consider it a lesson learned. In return, Hydra wants a redrawing of the territories. We wanted everything from 79
“Tony…” Steve’s voice was curious when he felt Tony tie the knot around his wrist, realising what Tony had in mind.
Howard was working with Hydra. That was why he had come to Tony’s place out of the blue. The contract he was talking about that brought in big money. He wanted Tony to fix the Jericho designs to sell it to Rumlow and Hydra. Howard was prepared to be an active part in the destruction of god knows how many lives for a paycheck and a bit of security.
“We need to break him out of jail.” Tony said aloud, not really registering then he’d even voiced the words until all eyes were on him. He knew he couldn’t take it back now, but he had thought about this. It had been the only thing he had managed to think about today. There was only a small window for them to get to Steve and it had to be whilst he was still in the city. When Ross charged him and moved him for a trial there would be no hope of getting to him, Ross would make sure of that.
It takes Tony every minute of constant working to pull it off, he hasn't slept and no one has brought him food. He isn't even sure how long he's been in this room, a day at least, maybe more. There are no windows and nothing to mark the passage of time so he doesn't focus on it. Instead, he works. Constantly. Obsessively.
“You come back here and scrub this room clean. Bleach the floor, get rid of the weapon. Take it with you, throw it into the sea. We’ll need to burn Tony’s clothes as well.” Steve ordered, “No trail, no way to tie this back to any of us.”
“He broke up with me, Nat. It’s done. He made that clear.”
“I’m not going to kill him, Buck.”
Steve nipped at his nipple lightly before pulling back, hands working on the ties of Tony’s joggers – which were miles too big and definitely belonged to Steve – tugging them down his legs along with his boxers until he was free of them and sprawled out naked on the table like a three course meal.
Well, Steve Rogers had once been a boy scout so he was nothing if not prepared.
Steve took his own sip, the liquid burning his throat on the way down, “We need to point the police back at Hydra. Get them to start sniffing around that gang instead. They won’t be able to make a move under scrutiny like that without risking arrest and we’d be free to launch our own defence if they tried anything.”
Tony thrust his hips up, “I want you inside of me.” He was so confident and breathless and Steve was amazed he didn’t come in his damn pants then and here.
Natasha squared her shoulders, “Not anymore. This life, it isn’t always easy. The stakes, the tension, the choices we have to make to protect ourselves. You’ll figure it out one day.”
Rumlow could wait. The world could wait. The Captain could wait. Tony couldn’t. This couldn’t.
Steve nodded, “So, this is about Nat then.”
Steve took a moment to drink him in, admiring the tan skin and the length of his cock, proud against his stomach and already leaking. The head was shiny with precome and Steve wanted nothing more than to devour him.
Tony was sweaty and smiling at him and Steve couldn’t resist leaning over to give him another kiss. Tony swallowed it happily.
“I can take a hit.” Tony grumbled, “And I don’t know what you want with me but trust me, you have the wrong guy.”
Tony spasmed underneath him, mumbling something unintelligible as he came into Steve’s mouth. Warm and salty cum hit the back of his throat as Steve swallowed some of it down. He pulled back when he couldn’t anymore, letting the rest of Tony’s cum dribble out into the space between them and slide down his cock.
He wanted to know; this was the side of Steve he wanted to explore. This man who had started out as a kid with dreams and ideals and thoughts on how his life might go. He wanted to know how a kid who dreamed of being a getaway driver turned into The Captain.
He was wrapping his arms around Bucky in a second, his hold firm despite Bucky’s protests to shrug him off. Steve held him tighter, waiting until Bucky admitted defeat and deflated against him. His arms came up to grip at the back of Steve’s shirt and Steve almost thought he felt him shudder against his frame with the effort of keeping himself together.
She shook her head, patting the space beside her for him to join her, “We’ve dealt with Hydra before, we’ll do it again.”
“I like having you like this.” Tony replied, hands reaching out for Steve’s own, pinning his arms on either side of him above his head, “Not many people get to see you like this.”
That’s what comes from growing up on the poor streets, a sense of looking out for the little guy that you just can’t lose. T’Challa had once stolen money from his father to give to Steve so he could take his mom to hospital. She had still died but he had never forgotten the lengths T’Challa had gone to, then just a boy of sixteen, to make sure Steve’s mom had the best chance of survival.
“We can’t have that.” Steve agreed in what sounded like a purr.
He started walking again, his legs moving just for something to do, “Where are you going?”
“Now? What the fuck is wrong with you?”
Steve nodded, he did know.
“I agree with Bruce it is too early to assume anything at this point, but I imagine that is not all there is to tell is there Mr. Stark?”  Fury acknowledged.
“Because, really, I don’t have a clue.” He began again.
"What?" He replied icily.
“You needn’t worry Director. I handle wayward and unique individuals for a living.” Xavier smiled kindly at the director.
A nurse stepped up to him, "Are you all right, Mr. Rogers?" She asked gently, lightly touching his shoulder. "You look a tad pale." She said.
For the next two hours Johnny, Steve, the kids, and their parents spent some quality time together.  Steve dug out some blank canvases and let the children have at it.  It was fun and messy.
He’s running the idea over in his mind. At least mutants and aliens are tangible things with faces that he can shove his fist into, unlike a super pathogen or some sort of machinery that he knew absolutely nothing about.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Kevin, come here please.”
“Yes, because that is what Jarvis told you.”  Smirking at the genius knowing he was right.
Find out this and more in the chapters to come.
“Aaahhgh!  Someone HELP!!”
"I am aware, truly." She responded with ire.
They didn’t get much further than that in their conversation about arm designs, however, due to the fact that Tony mentioned, quite impishly, how he could also create an arm with a sex toy attachment. That of course led to Barnes clapping back by mentioning Tony’s giant Patriotic dildo. Thus, their conversation descended into a raunchy banter. No more work on the arm designs had been done that day. So now, Tony was only working with Barnes’s key points that they managed to come up with before losing focus.
“I agree, it’ll be fun.” Natasha declared using her dangerous dark voice and expressions.
"Some of it. I had an idea after our first two encounters but wasn't sure." He answered.
“Of those three, there was one that I desperately hoped would not be the foe you seek.” He shuffled though the paged till he stopped at one.
The genius grabbed it eagerly and inspected it. It looked like it was some kid's gaming computer, perfect.
“Or better yet, we should just leave him on the floor.” Tony piped up.
"Yes, I'm fine, really I am. Don't worry, I'll be back when I'm ready to start those projects." He assured not to convincingly.
Tony grumbled in response while wiggling in his chair.
A/N: And so we are finally here! Definitely took me a while. And I do apologize for some of the unfortunate events that transpired last chapter but it was necessary. And I know some of you would have liked this chapter sooner but work and everything else just loves getting into the way. And for the fact that October 30 is my birthday and as a birthday present to myself I went to Wizard World Convention in Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 23.
Married to Peggy with a little golden haired little princess… Oh, yes there’s the sour taste in the back of his throat.
All the sudden Tony was staring at Steve intently with a bemused look on a face.
He turned back to Xavier and nodded.
~End Flashback~
Somehow, he had to find a way to beat her.
The bus ride into town was uneventful and Ellie mostly had eyes for her new doll. Steve may had been a tad jealous. They had grabbed a quick ice cream cone this time because Steve wanted to finish all their errands before it got dark. Ellie didn't mind at all.
“No, it won’t be that way.”
“You’re here!  You’re still here!”  Was her broken mantra.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
“I see that.” Bucky remarked.
Steve paused on the first step, “What mechanic?”
“Can we do this later?” Bucky replied, “If Rumlow comes back and we’re standing around I don’t fancy our chances.”
He took a large step towards Tony, closing the distance until Tony could feel his heat despite the cold of the night.
Steve knew Bucky was right. Tony didn’t belong in his world of blood and death and chaos. He had his own world, one that had no business mixing with Steve’s, “I know, Buck.”
Tony nodded, shutting the door behind him, “Right, I heard about that. It’s sort of why I’m here.”
Bucky was still watching him and suddenly their argument felt so small and stupid when faced with the bigger threat to their family. In his mind, Steve had the start of a plan. A way for The Captain and his team to disappear, create a false identity of who The Captain really was. He could even have T’Challa confirm it as a member of congress, a legitimate figure of truth and authority. Ross would have to believe it. But first, he had to deal with Rumlow because Ross’ manhunt wouldn’t matter either way if Rumlow killed him first.
“That you kill people?” Tony replied, “Shouldn’t it?”
There was a pause at the other end of the line, “I’m listening…”
Steve’s mind was reeling, running through as many ways this could play out as possible. This was bad. This was bigger than him and Rumlow. This was the start of a whole new Brooklyn.
Steve took that as his chance to back away, he shouldn’t have heard any of that and as much as he wanted to tell Natasha she was wrong, they could have a happy ending, that he’d make sure of it, he knew he couldn’t. It wasn’t his place, it was Bucky’s. They’d come back together on their own, they were complex and intertwined together in a way Steve could only dream of having. To have someone who loved you so unconditionally, so messily and purely and deeply. Wasn’t that what he wanted? Wasn’t that why he encouraged their relationship in the first place? Because if they found hope then maybe he could as well.
“I don’t normally bring my work home with me,” Steve said, “Forgive the gym shorts, I decided I should give you my full attention first.”
Bucky was clearly getting angry, his tone more clipped than before, “We might have had the chance to be happy, Nat, but you decided differently.”
“I’ll wait outside, I won’t go in.” He replied, “I just need to know you’re okay and safely out of there.”
Fury narrowed his eye, “That’s your best friend and he killed a corrupt cop who was really a Hydra member. Probably saved all our asses. You really want to go down that road?”
“What’s the plan now, Cap?” Sam asked from behind him.
Natasha and Bucky had gone after Sitwell, who at Steve’s instruction had managed to find his feet and start running. It was a fear response that drove him on foot through the dark maze of steel craters when his car was right in front of him. Even if he managed to get in it though he’d never had been able to leave in it, not whilst Steve had a gun in his hand and a bullet in the barrel.
Steve bit back a moan, hips rolling into Tony’s hand wantonly. His lips found Tony’s with a fierceness that had Tony gasping softly and Steve biting at his lip for the noise.
Rhodey looked up from his paperwork at Tony’s arrival, “Hey Tones, you can’t be here. It’s all systems go right now with the turf war.”
Tony tore his mouth away from Steve’s when breathing became a requirement and Steve moved down to pay attention to Tony’s neck. He preened at the feel of Steve sucking his pulse point, head moving back to rest against the door and allowing Steve more access. It turned out Tony was very sensitive around that area and Steve couldn’t help the smile on his face when he kissed at the spot where Tony’s neck met his shoulder and was rewarding with a rough thrust of Tony’s hips against him.
“This one is all tissue, try not to scream.” He advised and then the shot echoed out through the room. The guy let out a grunt and something that might have been a shout in pain if he wasn’t biting his own tongue to try and not let Steve see his agony. It was a brave choice, Steve admired that.
Steve’s eyes soften, “You can try whatever you want, Tony. I trust you.”
“I did at first. I didn’t want to start messing with gang stuff. I was working most days at the hospital and volunteering at a clinic downtown most nights. It’s how I met Cap actually, he used to come into the clinic as a kid when he needed treatment. Not many people can afford healthcare these days, I volunteer there to do what I can to help them.”
“I don’t know. I don’t know where he is. Sometimes he’s at the base, sometimes he’s not. He’s all over, rallying support and putting plans into place.” The guy told him; eyes glued to the blood pooling from his leg.
Tony nodded eagerly, “Yes.”
Tony was frozen, he couldn’t speak or move. His hand was red and slick and shaking. Natasha had told him to find a soft spot and push and he had. God, what had he done? He stared at the letter opener in his hand again before dropping it to the floor in disgust. Oh god…
“Are you breaking up with me?”
“You’re wrong you know. Steve Rogers did die that day. I’m that dark thing inside him that refused to die in the desert, and I’m the only thing left.” Steve replied.
That didn’t mean he was going to make it easy for them.
Steve struggled against the cops holding him, fighting his way over to Tony. He managed to wrestle free long enough to close the gap between them, fusing his lips with Tony’s in a tight kiss. When he pulled away Tony had a smear of blood on his cheek that had transferred from Steve’s own skin, “Don’t say anything. We have a lawyer; you’re going to be fine. I promise.”
Were they trying to use Tony to lure Steve in? If so, that was the dumbest thing Tony had ever heard. Steve might have fucked him a few times but that didn’t mean he was about to risk his safety and the safety of his team to come after him.
Steve brushed a hand over the hair on his jaw, “I like cars. When I was a kid I wanted to be a getaway driver.”
Steve knelt on the bed, feeling it move under his weight as he crawled over Tony’s sleeping form. The mechanic slept on, so used to Steve’s presence that it barely startled him anymore. Steve moved until he was straddling him, powerful thighs bracketing Tony’s hips as he leaned down. His mouth closed over Tony’s neck, that beautiful slope of his skin that Steve loved so much. He placed open mouthed kisses to the warmth, feeling Tony hum happily in his sleep.
“We’re not doing this.” Rhodes replied, “We aren’t talking about Tony right now. Get on your knees, I’m taking you back to your cell.”
Worried eyes of confusion tracked his movements as Steve paced in front of them. They were all crowded into the small space, taking up the couch and the armrests like a united front. In any other situation Steve could believe they had all gathered for a movie night or a night to simply enjoy each other’s company.
Thor sighed, “The police have locked down the area, the coroner hadn’t arrived when I left but it is as we feared. Someone is killing policemen and making it look like us. Our symbol was carved into the man’s chest with a knife judging from what I could see of the pattern. The amount of police there spoke volumes, Captain, they are using everything they have with this one.”
“I’ll deal with him.” Steve replied, eyes narrowing, “What I don’t want to deal with is the two of you. If you can’t work together anymore you need to tell me now because I won’t put this family at risk for whatever is happening between you two.”
Steve wrenched the door open, aiming his gun. His body was coiled like a spring ready for a fight.
Tony’s hands slipped to his shoulders, “If this is about the blood on your sleeve.”
A move he hadn’t been expecting.
Steve is all muscle, thick cords of thigh and lines of abs and Tony makes a point of feeling it all before reaching for Steve’s cock, stroking him in one long move from base to tip. Tony swipes a thumb over the head, coating it in precome but moving up to suck the digit into his mouth.
Tony was curled up into a ball in the furthest corner from the door, his eyes wide and unfocused. He was staring at Ross, not moving or blinking aside from the small shakes that wracked his body. Steve’s heart broke, Tony looked so lost and scared and young. Steve wanted to hold him.
Ross watched him with curious eyes, “I’m sorry about your father. Rumlow was always a hothead.”
Natasha nodded, “Thanks.”
Rumlow sighed, kicking Howard so he rolled over onto his back in the dirt. One of his eyes was swollen shut and Steve wasn’t sure he could even form a sentence, “You want to know your problem, Captain? I knew what it was the moment we met in Afghanistan.” Rumlow told him, rising to his feet, “You care. And because of that you put your faith in people. Other people were always going to be the reason for your downfall. Starting with him.”
Steve took a deep breath and then he started filling Fury in on everything he was planning. The only other person in the world who knew Steve’s plan and might be able to help him with it.
“Pierce, report.” The gruff voice at the end of the line greeted.
Images of the desert flooded his mind. The hot sun burning his skin off in chunks. The desperation for food, for water. The blood and sand coating his face, his hands. He shook his head to rid himself of the images.
Clint was off like a shot. Bruce was focused on Bucky again, “Listen to me, Bucky. The only way you’re going to survive this is if I seal up the wound to stop the bleeding. It will scar and hurt like hell but with antibiotics you should be free from infection.”
Steve hung up the phone and let it drop between his fingers.
“What do you want to know?” Steve sighed, the thought of seeing Tony again, even if it was to be the last time, was a thought he was clinging too like a dying man.
“Sounds like I missed a hell of a meeting,” Clint said gently, he turned then to look at Steve, “So Hydra’s coming for us now?”
“Tony, fuck.” Steve breathed out, “I need to be inside you.”
Steve understood that, he uncrossed his arms as his eyes moved from Tony to his newly fixed bike, “You did a good job on this.”
“God no.” Tony smiled, “Equals. Remember?”
Steve sighed, “You’re damn right we do. I tell you to show up, you show up.”
He stood there proudly, cock flush against his stomach and a wide grin on his face, “Are you going to fuck me here?”
Isn’t that what he had done? When life with Howard started killing him slowly, degrading him and wearing him down. He had changed, he had evolved. He had survived because Tony understood if he didn’t than he wasn’t going to last the year. It would be the drink or maybe he would have started adding drugs to his mix. He might have partied too hard and foolishly and died before Howard could get just a little too angry to do the job himself.
Tony had his palm raised, “You heard The Captain.” He added, flexing his fingers over the device of the glove.
Tony shrugged, “Better than being forced to build weapons.”
Tony whimpered and added another finger, fucking himself open wider as his hips stuttered against Steve’s skin. Steve was rock hard now, he needed Tony to cum, he needed to be inside him.
Fury hummed, “I can knock out the cameras and we can take it through the service exit. Why are we moving him though?”
“There’s lube and condoms in my toolbox.” Tony told him, hands pulling out of his jeans to start working open the buttons on Steve’s shirt.
Steve chuckled, “I meant it too, about wanting this. I don’t know how to do that though, to want something for myself.”
Steve frowned at it, crudely done with a knife by someone who didn’t know how to use one. He could see the tears in the skin where the knife at gotten stuck whilst carving.
The water started to steam up as it reached temperature and Steve slowly made his way back over to Tony.
“Are you asking for my permission?”
“I wouldn’t,” Tony sighed, “I know who he is, okay? I knew going into this thing how dangerous Steve is and the rumours about what he’s done. I’m still here.”
No one stopped him.
What was he thinking of again?
“Why 0.5%?” Barnes asked.
Calamity regarded him as he continued.
It was scary.
“All right Maria.” Peggy smiled warmly. “Come on everybody, let’s have lunch now shall we? I am rather peckish.”
He nodded. She helped him remove all the layers to fully assess the damage. Once she got a clear view she gasped. Gnarly was an understatement. There were three major roads of stitches on his stomach that branched out like a crude peace sign. There was also a long jagged one on his right arm. Nearly all of them on his arm were torn or clearly on the verge of tearing.
From what Peggy told him, his bouts of amnesia where common occurrences and if he and this man really knew each other, then the man would know about it, right?
Now I hope that you all enjoy this chapter. It is prison break time! Please don’t forget to leave a review at the end of the chapter after you read. I’d really like to know what you all think.
“And if they don’t already know, make sure your people know what has happened here today.”
"Do you think me evil Steven?"
The Avengers won.
“Really, twenty? I thought it would be more than that, at least fifty. But still, twenty channels all about me. People are just so fascinated with me.” Tony smirked. “And besides, I know the Lego story.”
“Hey, are you okay?” Steve’s beautiful face flooded his vision.
Tony took a few minutes to center himself. He ran a hand through his hair in a futile attempt to tame it. He took a deep breath before leaving his quarters to go to Steve’s medical room. He had no idea how he was going to go about showing Steve what he meant to Tony. He would just have to figure it out along the way.
I apologize for any and all errors and without any further ado, on with the show!
They looked at the bruising around the Captain’s wrist where Calamity had first grabbed him.
“I hope not but we have to be ready for anything okay?”
He held his arms out to her and she dove into them immediately.
Hearing her mention Stark made his heart skip a beat but he could not figure out why. He didn't get a chance to think on it as the nurse began to lead him into Peggy's room.
He didn’t have time to properly suit up so he grabbed his shield and made his way to the nearest exit only to find he was barricaded in by Jarvis.
Tony was gobsmacked. He absolutely did not know how to proceed. Watching this deadly assassin, Hydra’s dog, their slave, cry so. It tore at him. I mean, sure, he knew that Barnes’s reaction was a feasible possibility but Tony was not expecting his own cascade of odd emotions upon witnessing it. He really felt sorry for the guy.
Steve hoped he was okay.
“After what happened your friends decided unanimously that it was in your best interest to keep it from you because if you knew you could die.”
Damn.
“What!? Why?” Steve exclaimed still reeling that he has yet to meet condemnation.
“No, it’s fine. It’s been a long crazy day.” He said softly.
Steve nodded understanding the Professor completely.
Ten more minutes passed in relative silence. Tony was making a few more adjustments to his calibration when he felt a shift in the Soldiers demeanor. His shoulders slumped and he seemed to sink in on himself just a little. He looked over to Wanda to see if there was any cause for concern, but he only saw that she seemed to be somewhat downtrodden. He looked over the dark-haired man’s shoulder to see what he had stumbled upon this time. When Tony saw what the soldier was looking at he, all at once, realized the cause of this somber mood change. Barnes was looking at some pretty expensive, high-quality art supplies.
"Bastard." Tony muttered in derision.
Steve repositioned him in their little area in an attempt to ensure he was comfortable. The twins moved to get comfortable also.
Tony shook his head in denial. Clint continued.
“It needs to be redone, but I do not know how.” She whispered regretfully.
He gave the second largest to Kevin.
"Pretty words."
The Soldier’s initial reaction was shock then it quickly turned to excitement and amazement. To experience the professors special power first hand was exhilarating. Steve began to smile.
“The prisoner still needs a psychological evaluation.” Added official number two. “And Everett Ross still hasn’t had his interrogation, yet. If we let you in, there would be hell to pay.”
"Please!" He pleaded desperately, one last time. "I'll give you anything, I'll do anything if you just return him."
“Yes Boss!”
“It’s all right, Sweetie.” He chuckled. “How did Rocky turn out?” He looked over at her work.
"Indeed." The crystal figure answered as she absorbed the light into her tiny body.
“Cerebro focuses and enhances my natural abilities. With it I could potentially find anyone in the world, see him, hear him,
Steve nodded and smiled. He had already recognized the similarities. The fact that Howard Stark is the only person in the world that could have the capacity to create such advanced technology did not escape him either. But somehow, he knew without a shadow of a doubt that this man was not Howard.
After a wonderfully fun adventure of figuring out how to get a traumatized, one armed, bleeding Winter Soldier into a maybe too small diving suit they were in the pressure chamber ready to bail.
But no, Fury and Pepper won’t let him considering all the trouble they had gone through to keep him. Coincidentally, Fury said something about how it was incredibly fishy concerning the soldier’s existence. Considering all his recent targets, there may be a possibility that the infamous Harker may have been a puppet all along. And if so, they had to consider the possibility that SHIELD was compromised.
This was so stupid! Everything was just so messed up! Why did it have to be this way? Why couldn’t Steve trust him? Why couldn’t he choose Tony for once? No, he chose the abomination, Hydra’s lapdog, and it stung.
After realizing that his face had not yet met the dirt, he looked up to find himself safe in Steve's arms. He looked up into the warm gray eyes of his Captain. Hope threatened to ignite in his heart.
Tony rose an eyebrow, "Sort of, I guess you can say that." He replied offhandedly.
He could barely hear Clint shout for him. The archer must have realized by now the situation.
“Buck, I’ll be fine.” Steve tried weekly.
Everyone?
Okay, so that was a minor (major) miscalculation on his part. Tony assumed that they had stitched or stapled or at least bandaged Bucky’s wound, but no. They didn’t do a damn thing! This guy has been walking around and fighting with a fucking hole in his chest. What the fucking fuck!?
It’s too late now. Even if he alerted them now they would never get to the Raft in time. He was on his own. Tony was pulled from his thoughts at the sound of a sharp intake of air as Bucky hit the floor. The genius turned around quickly to find the soldier slumped against the wall.
Tony sighed internally.
“Okay, let’s go.”
A small child manifested into view and hobbled onto the piano bench next to the woman. Steve realized with a start that the small child was Tony.
“No! Go to hell!” Was Bucky’s instant response.
“They’re fine. If Steve thought they were fine, then they’re good.” Tony managed to groan out before the world began to spin and he promptly passed out.
She perked up at that.
Steve smiled. "Yeah, don't you worry. I can handle it. Plus, it's Friday, the best day of the week."
The hardware store was his first stop. He was happy to note that the bus stop was nearly just in front of the store. He made a note of it for tomorrow.
The Professor sighed softly, “The best and most useful thing you could do right now, Captain, is to stay out of it.  Trust your team, your loved ones to handle it.”
He looked around and noticed that there were a few nurses heading his way, all looking equally concerned.
"It's all right, Peg. I'm here now." He said as he gently tapped his forehead to hers.
“Do not worry, my love, you will be free of your burdens soon enough.”
“Well, I think we should destroy it.” Clint suggested quickly. “It might be a virus!”
No matter how much effort or risk he had taken to keep Steve and Barnes alive when the strike unit closed in on them, it didn’t matter in the end when he couldn’t put his heart on the line for the Captain. In the end after everything it was Tony unwilling to trust Steve. How could he expect the Captain to trust him when really he was the one who couldn’t trust Steve? This whole mess was Tony’s fault, plain and simple.
"You are incorrigible." She sighed before giving him one last kiss. She stepped back and grabbed her purse. "I'll be back later tonight." She said walking to the door. "You will have to cook dinner for you and Ellie tonight and –"
Flesh was easy enough to open back up, the bone, however, would be some nasty business. At least this way, they would be able to work the bone to the perfect shape of the newly modified bone anchor mechanisms and cybernetics.
“I’ll have you know grown men do not have temper tantrums.” Tony stated matter of factly.
The ugly fat man began to laugh and sneer from behind the newcomer who was sporting hot pink aviators and pink bunny ears.
His entire being was screaming at him that he knew the answer, that he knew the answer weeks ago. But he refused to listen to himself, desperately trying to remain in blissful ignorance. Because, if it was true… No it can’t be!
Steve shook his head.
Tony watched on in horror as his body was forcefully moved into position to target the projection pods, his mind was screaming. He rapidly muttered override code after override code. By the time the last projection pod was destroyed he was screaming the codes. Alas none worked.
“There.” He said in mild relief.
He set the video right at the point Jimmy looked at something (someone). He then pointed to a spot on the screen. Everybody gasped.
After that Tony decided that it was time for a well-deserved break. He said that it was still a major drawback because of the electromagnetic headache the device caused. He was definitely going to look into that a bit more later.
He had to destroy the core.  Unfortunately the only dumb ass move he could think of was to try to destroy it head on.  Or at the very least try to.
Tony was so absorbed in shock and horror that he didn’t notice the flash, thus he couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment Captain America’s shield whipped past him and pierced the mother’s forehead. The screams of agony from that foul creature were deafening. Tony whipped around at the source of the throw only to see Steve whirl around and hurl a dead doom bot straight at the mother. The robot hit her square in the middle of the forehead forcing the shield in further and thoroughly embedding it deep within her skull.
“Listen,” he swallowed thickly trying to rein in his emotions. “I know about the chief code.”
A/N: I'm back! Sorry this is gonna be a short one but a good place to end it. Two more chapters to go I hope you all are ready.
Steve turned his head slowly to face Tony. He winced minutely at the effort. From what he was able to see from his painful position, Tony was furious. His brow was pinched in anger and his mouth was caught somewhere between a sneer and a grimace.
“Carful Captain, he can read your mind just as easy as it is for us to breath. Now that I think of it he might already know about that
It was definitely yet another blow to his already thoroughly bruised ego. Clint squinted at him in disbelief.
'But where?'
She looked at him strangely for a moment.
They stared at each other. How many times have they been in this position before? Bucky looming over him putting pressure on the wound while giving him that reprimanding look that always screamed, “Dumbass! Why do you gotta be so damn reckless?!”
“Oh, I’m so sorry Steve, I think I’m going to lie down for a little.”
"Excuse me, I don't think I heard you right. You said machines as in plural, multiple?"
“No fun.” He sighed. “Okay, so step two is supposed to be the super painful latching part?”
It was eons ago, impossible to determine any measure of time for this was well before any thought to measure time. I can recall it clearly, there was a moment when I did not exist. Then I did.
Just as Steve was about to relax and accept the explanation Clint and Tony offered, there was a bone chilling scream.
"I'm sorry-" Steve began again.
Wanda must have felt it too when she stopped short in the middle of the road and began to look around cautiously. Steve tried to take deep breaths to calm his turbulent nerves. The others took battle ready positions. Their Captain’s anxious countenance did not go unnoticed.
“I try.”
“Go on.” He smirked. Oh, he was going to enjoy this.
"Because it's not real." He replied finally.
“It was both doctors, just so you know.” Barton piped up. “They both were regaling the tale of the immature children they had to babysit for six hours.” Clint smirked.
He grabbed his spoon and dug in as well. As soon as the cold and creamy flavors exploded in his mouth he immediately fully understood Ellie’s euphoria.
“He made his choice, Tony. Now it’s up to you to figure out how to stop her.” Clint tried to reason with him.
The genius’s outburst had shocked everyone so much they all were about to have their own meltdowns.
“Yes, let me show you.”
Tony seriously has had it up to here with this guy.
“I also contacted headquarters.”  He said. “They’ve sent a third team, but they’re still an hour away.  We’re on our own till then.”
He shook his head.
“I hear you, man. But really, Steve, are you okay?”
~-0-~
The next day and a half passed in a flash. Tony made sure to have all preparations completed by noon. Barnes was scheduled to have the first skeletal prototype mounted at 2 o’clock. The genius wanted to give him ample time to heal. The soldier’s healing rate had nearly tripled from what it was when Tony rescued him from the Raft. Constant good nutrition and exercise did wonders for him. After he made that first breakthrough and decided for himself to help, he had begun eating more and even took up exercising in the gym and sparring with whoever was brave enough to take him. Tony would never get tired of watching Natasha fold Barnes into one of those unique pretzels Tony himself has had the pleasure of experiencing. Our genius absolutely delighted in it.
“Look!” She exclaimed as they arrived. “Isn’t she gorgeous?” Ellie spoke in reverent awe.
Steve felt bile rise to his throat. They were going to keep him confined like an animal. In a tower! He absently thought if a prince would come rescue him. Only, the “prince” he was thinking of, no doubt, was the one that locked him in here in the first place.
Sweat now mixed with the blood trickling down his face. It dripped unceremoniously onto his already marred hands.
“Unfortunately, I have so many agendas happening all at once, none could ever hope to understand my motives.” She stated as she began to run her hands up and down the Captain’s arms.
He tucked Ellie against him as he bit his lip. He tried to concentrate.
At the time I thought that if I had kids I could possibly do something like that for them, you know make them happy…  I dunno I might be drunk.”  He laughed as he finished his story scratching the back of his head.
Steve nodded in understanding.
"God dammit! Rogers! Look at me!"
“Oh look, here’s your father now.” Peggy looked up at him. “Tell Eleanor she needs to go take a nap.”
“Or something.” Barnes commented wryly as Tony rubbed his face.
A silvery flash appeared and struck down the last goon like nothing. It just past the Rhododendron disappearing the infernal radar gun from his hands all before you can blink.
“What are you doing here?” ‘Yes!’ He thought as he managed to ask clearly without muttering or stuttering.
“I’m keeping this.” She stated with no room for argument.
Next, she changed into a creature that seemed like it could be the spirit of fire itself. She reminded him of Johnny greatly then.
"I don't really know, Babydoll. Your mother ordered it." He answered. "It looks like Francesca's is on the second floor." He said absently, scanning the directory.
Steve sighed, well that is the only question that really matters, isn’t it?
"Indeterminable."
Angie winked then turned and strode off. Steve was immensely thankful for her support. When Angie was out of view Ellie fell silent and her face grew somber.
The giant zapper was designed to go off like a nuke.  The crazy dude they identified as Kumin Tankar had intended to set it off like a suicide bomb the moment the army infiltrated.  Tankar also had it set up to where if anybody had tried to disable it, like knocking him out the way Steve did, it would have automatically went off.
“Okay.” The soldier responded. Natasha stood idly by, nothing betraying her thoughts or emotions as she watched on.
“Alright you heard the man, suit up and get to the Quin Jet ASAP.”  Steve commanded taking over.
“I…  Never mind! It’s stupid…”  He said agitated.
“However, Sir, At this point in time I am sure Director Fury would readily disagree with you.” Jarvis stated flatly, Confirming Thor’s question.
Tony please, no matter what happens please don’t stop looking for the way to stop Calamity. I am 100% confident you can stop her as long as you keep trying. I know it seems hopeless. I know a 0.5% is a tiny window but if I am capable of surprising her then you, the most hardheaded and unpredictable person I know, definitely can too. You will beat her, Tony, I know it! Please don’t give up.
Tony nodded almost encouragingly. In all honesty, he felt the same way. There were many, many things that he too must atone for.
“Well I won’t be able to actually change the memories themselves but with this,” he gestured to his makeshift stage with the holographic devices. “I’ll be able to tweak the memories and have them play out differently for therapeutic purposes.”
He switched the video footage to Jimmy and pushed play. It depicted Jimmy talking to a group of agents. He was cracking jokes and the others laughed. Then something caught his attention for a moment.
Thank god! They needed this.
“Oh yeah I have, and if you don’t mind Eric and Darcy are in sick bay with the X-Men.”
“Aww, that’s such a shame.” The visitor muttered in grief at the spilt coffee.
Tony looked at him sadly.
The Captain nodded idly, he was at a complete loss for words. A father is supposed to protect his children! But to do such heinous things… despicable!
Thor sat petrified. He stared upon the screen with an obscene amount of terror on his stricken face. His eyes open wide as they bore into the screen. Tony turned off the monitor eager to take the image from Thor’s sight.
“If we get separated this emits a sound wave for three minutes. It will destroy all of the zappers in your path. It works up to nearly three hundred feet if you aim good.” Steve showed him.
She giggled as he took her hand, ever the gentleman, and led her into the parlor. The vendor greeted them merrily, and with familiarity, indicating that Steve and Ellie were likely regulars. Steve couldn’t wait till he could remember the townspeople again. Some people came up to him and greeted him so warmly and by name he felt ridiculously guilty at not knowing there’s in return. Ellie helped a lot, however.
"I know you can hear me!" He roared again. "Come face me!"
“True.” Barnes agreed. The soldier methodically rubbed each temple again before running his hand through his hair. He let out a shuddering breath before continuing. “Did you try the hexilien format algorithm?” He inquired, gesturing to the code.
"Relay a message for me, tell him to focus on taking the helicarrier down. When it's out of the way take out as many doom bots as possible and if he happens to see a little pink bunny hopping about to kill it with extreme prejudice." Captain America commanded.
"You still had to get passed Tony." He said in realization. "But why? Why didn't you claim everyone the moment I said yes."
“Are we going to get ice cream?” She asked looking up at Steve pleadingly.
“Thanks Tony, that means a lot.” He smiled back genuinely at Tony.
Really.
“I’m sorry Daddy, but your eyes are all better now right? You can see all the colors!” She smiled.
“Sir?”
“Oh, don’t be so sour about it. Not my fault you can’t appreciate good music.” Barnes drawled.
“So! Are you going to let me attach this to the back of your neck and calibrate it?”
“You are crazy! This information could destroy you. What if I learn all your dirty secrets then suddenly I’m captured by Hydra again? You’re dead.”
“What???” He looked up at Peggy who was still smiling widely.
He needed to get to Steve. He needed to get to Steve.
Steve tightened his hold on him then moaned deeply when Tony swiped his tongue along the Captain's bottom lip, encouraging him to deepen their kiss. Steve couldn't get enough of Tony's unique taste and the feel of his velvety tongue against his own.
End chapter Thirty-Three.
Tony only nodded as he used the computer to hook into the robot corpse to analyze its OS.
Steve shook his head, “If I have realized sooner-“
“I had the Death Star edition. Never finished it, though.” Barton mentioned.
“Although, that one X-Men friend of yours made one hell of a go at it.”  She remarked as she lifted her shirt to show her abdomen.  There were three dark red marks were Logan’s claws penetrated her flesh.
Barnes looked down at the shattered remains of his arm in unconcealed disgust. Tony watched him idly.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
A few hours ago Tony thought his life could not get any worse. The universe once again failed to disappoint and could not help but prove him wrong. The Winter Soldier, Barnes, Steve’s best friend, killed his parents.
Even now a big part of him wanted to despite what happened.
After what felt like hours, though was probably only mere minutes, Barnes finished the last sequence of the algorithm. He sighed heavily and looked up at Tony. Tony, however, was studying the algorithm with frightening intensity.
Over and over, they danced on.
This creature, person, would eventually become my very first friend. When I learned it's spoken language and learned how to communicate with her, I spent hours, days, years speaking to this creature. We exchanged ideas, and told each other stories. It was cathartic, to create these ideas out of seemingly nothing. I never had been so stimulated. I would have been perfectly happy and content to stay that way for all eternity.
Regardless, he knew he would have to apologize to Tony. Hopefully he would get a chance to explain that it wasn’t that he didn’t want to spend the last of his life with him, because that’s all he wants, but he couldn’t live with the guilt of it all.
The Professor watched him intently.
Ouch.
“Steven.”  The Professor greeted with a smile.
“Ok, Here.” Just as the agents had said their farewells, Gloria was about to walk away however she stopped and simply fell over, completely unconscious.
“Unfortunately, I must also apologize for the second reason I am here today.”  She conveyed at last, backing away solemnly.  “I’m afraid I have been distracting you.  It was an impressive and valiant idea to bring in your Allies and rally against me.  It was certainly the best course of action to take, considering.”
The moment he saw her he was instantly by her side much to the chagrin of the doctor. He was immensely relieved to note that though she looked utterly exhausted she still had an air of determination.
'Gee, thanks, Peg.' He sighed, thinking of the best way to carry them.
The Captain looked away with profound guilt.
“No!” His mind screamed. “Please! No!”
Steve pulled Tony's warm body to his own, one arm looping perfectly behind the small Tony's back and the other hand grazing his beard before burying itself into his dark locks, clutching the back of his head. Steve gently tugged Tony's head back, giving him the perfect angle to claim the genius's lips. Oh, and claim them he did.
He looked up at her suddenly.
Barnes continued, "When I left, it was my understanding that you were going to talk to him again. I get back and it looks like you've got a good thousand of these done, so what happened?"
Something’s not right. The footages from the newscast were hardly discernible. What if Bucky was being framed to pull him out of hiding? The assassination of the vice president and his entire family would definitely turn a lot of powerful heads. Now here’s the question, who wants him found? And why?
When Tony looked up again, Bucky was openly glaring at him.
"Steve darling! Thank heavens they finally let you come." She cried miserably latching on to him.
"But… He's alive." Tony murmured.
“Those are way too big for me!” Maggie protested.
Agent Hill and Coulson cocked their guns. An agent flew into the room out of breath with a pained expression. Fury looked at the agent exasperated already knowing what had happen. So he started to fill in the rest of the class.
“No!  Please don’t!”  Steve begged reaching for her.  Just as he finally reached her his hands caught air and she was gone.
Thor looked visibly shocked at her mentioning Trëyía.
“Sometimes it was the only option.” Steve defended firmly.
Yes creature.
“I still should have went back and searched for your body, tried harder to bring you home.” He whispered.
He stopped abruptly and stared up at her in shock.
"Guys? Nat's down, she's not moving!" Rhodey alerted an alarm.
“Fuck Off!” Bucky responded.
Evisceration???
They position themselves by the elevator in hopes of taking the occupants by surprise. Tony watched dismally as a deep crimson stain began to spread over the soldiers thin clothing. He was starting to bleed more.
acquaintance with the pavement the Captain lost his helmet. He picked himself up shakingly. He saw stars after that hit. Blood was now pouring down his face in delicate red ribbons. The soldier stopped and regarded him.
The second more slender silhouette handed over a worn leather bound book.  The first man snatched it away greedily.  He began to eagerly thumb through the book.  His expression morphed from giddy excitement to sour crossness.
Was Steve not the one that came to the conclusion not days ago that nothing could, should happen between them?
There's something very important about the heartbeat and the glow of the moon. He kept running it over. It wasn't the moon per se, but what the moon looks like. A perfect glowing orb of light, and it's important.
That jolted Steve right through the core.
“But seriously Cap, will you be OK?” He asked with true concern and his eyes.
Steve nodded in agreement. Just as he set the last dish down there was a knock at the door.
A/N: I’m here! Welcome back everyone! I’ve got a new chapter for you all. Please don’t forget to leave me a review at the end and tell me how you liked it, I’d love to hear from you all.
Unfortunately, fate had other plans for Steven Grant Rogers.
In the meantime, Clint and Natasha were waiting for Steve to emerge. They were starting to get worried. They had heard a lot of commotion going on in the facility and were hoping that the Captain had things under control.
Tony,
“Wonderful idea Peg!” Howard hollered joyously as he made his way to the kitchen.
Steve shuttered in anticipation. Tony licked the shell of his ear and gave his lobe a little nip, making the Captain flinch in thrill, before pulling away and getting off of Steve completely.
“Rumlow.” Tony breathed out and Rumlow’s smirk widened to a feral grin as he pointed a gun at them. Both raised their arms slowly.
Steve was beside himself with shock, shame and a growing wave of self-loathing. He shrank in on himself as the full weight of what he had bartered away fully registered in his mind.
“I couldn’t have done it without you.” Tony admitted.
"It kind of does, doesn't it?" Steve replied.
“Sir, miss Romanov has issued in SOS. You are needed at once.”
“Oh I’ve got to hear this. Why are they after you?”
This whole thing was really starting to take its toll on Tony.
‘Maybe, just maybe.’
Oh God! That really really did not look good.
He coughed hoarsely as blood poured out of his nose and mouth. He spat the blood out viciously as if by doing so he could banish them all to a hell dimension.
In order to close the hole, he would ideally need to go back to the tower and create five new spatial disorders. No, not disorders, resonators. With the sole purpose of closing the hole and stabilizing everything back to relative spatial wavelengths.
After his awful encounter with Calamity, Natasha was the first person he come across upon his return to the tower. He briefly explained his meeting with Calamity and broke the news that Steve had been taken. After setting up a few protocols and a grueling trip to the infirmary, Tony had sulked a way to his lab leaving Natasha to inform the others. He knew it was a dick move but he just couldn’t face them.
“Times up…”
“Who shit in your coffee?” Barnes spoke up gesturing to Tony’s apparent scowl.
"How's it going, Dumbass?" He asked as he took cover behind the shield and shot down six birds and a knockoff doom bot.
When he stepped out into the bright sunlight he took a deep breath to gather his bearings. He stared up at the blue sky wishing he remembered the people of this town, especially when they clearly knew him.
“I cannot say.  Please understand, the less you know the better.  Trust me.”
Steve not one to give up so readily took it for what it was, a terrible situation. A situation that, dire as it is, has the capacity for solution. Not a solution that is all sunshine and rainbows with a hero riding off into the sunset with an all’s well that ends well sentiment. A solution that is simply more less better than essentially giving up.
There was no telling how truly formidable Harker was. If he had managed to hack and infiltrate Hydra, Von Doom, Stark Industries and likely Shields servers, then he could potentially have access to any number of classified dangerous data all over the world. Not just any dangerous classified data, but devastating weapons data.
Tony looked away ashamed of himself. Steve was one of his most important friends and it took until now to truly understand this very important part of Steve, the pain he must be facing daily.
The moment he was properly covered Tony blinked back to life and took a shuddering breath.
“That’s because you are Tony, I just happened to be there.” Steve retorted giving him a sly grin.
“It will also show me how much range and mobility it has attached to your body. This way, we can plan around it to design the perfect outer armor for your desired use.”
It was all he could do now… just float along and mourn his foul existence.
Meanwhile…
Tony began tuning them out in favor of hunkering down to further focus on disassembling the stolen doom code.
“You sigh like the world’s ending.” Ellie voiced.
After that admission Thor went back into deep thinking.
Will Tony figure out the significance of the code?
“Say Cap, how bout instead of fifty dollars, you give me a kiss?” Suggested Tony, waggling his eyebrows.
“Lead the way.”
“Look at what the cat drug in.” He drawled as he aimed his arrow at the final remaining birdie bot, his eyes never left Tony’s visage. “What do you want?” He demanded as he released the arrow hitting the birdie bot dead on, eyes still focused on Tony. Absolutely remarkable.
Tony knocked on the door to alert anybody on the other side that he wanted out.
Steve really should have known then…
If Clint had any ordinary arrows he had probably use them by now. All he could do was use the high-tech ones he had left. That machine they had, however, seem to jam and scramble anything technical they had.
“Stupid you say? You should hear about the one I came up with almost a week ago, it would make my current one sound utterly brilliant.” Tony stated with a cringe.
"Who are you?" He demanded.
Tony gawked at him and sputtered. Honestly, he had nearly given up on Barnes altogether. Yet here he stood before him with that insufferable look on his cocky face.
"Daddy? Why are you scowling?" Ellie spoke up suddenly, completely shattering Steve's train of thought.
“The children explained to us what happened.”  Becka’s mother explained.
“Was up Cap?” Tony said as he was assessing the disaster of his work station.
“It’s beautiful.” Wanda whispered.
“That’s the thing though, I wish he was the one pulling the trigger on me. I’m the one that deserves to die.” Tony cried out in desolation. “I’m the one that deserves this punishment. Not Steve.”
“This is Becka.” Tommy said quietly.
"Tony really did it." Steve whispered in bewildered relief.
“Something stupid!”  Steve replied followed by a nervous laugh.
“What is it?” Steve asked softer, looking Tony in the eye.
It sounded a lot like Yggdrasil was every major religious deity on earth.
“No if we trapped it here there would be no telling how it would end up attacking people. Like what Professor Xavier said before, this thing would create havoc among the crew making them easy prey.” He paused for a moment Fury was about to interject but Steve continued.
“You…  Went through so much to protect them.” Kevin’s mother said between sobs.
I do apologize for any and all errors.
He started to lead Tony to his room. Steve practically tossed Tony onto his bed before moving about to make sure the genius has water and aspirin for the morning. Tony was having fits of giggles on the bed, Steve could hear Tony say something about liking it rough. The poor Captain surely does not want to get into what all that means.
“Did you enjoy your tragedy?” Tony asked as a young Rose walked up the staircase toward the clock where Jack waited for her. “Was it what you expected?”
-- go have a look at their ridiculous swimsuits!
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Tony said, snapping Steve’s attention back up to his face. “If I invite you to my place, are you going to disappear again?”
“I’d like that,” he said, voice soft. “I’m only here during certain times, but it’s usually the same time every week...”
Tony’s fingers grabbed at Steve’s shirt, pulling it up until Steve was forced to stop sucking marks into Tony’s chest so it could be pulled over his head. As soon as Tony tossed it to the side, Steve surged up to kiss him again, hips rocking together.
so much, but he doubted he could hold both of them up for long. Tightening his hold on Tony’s ass, he pulled away from the wall and made his way down to the only other door there, thankful that it was the bedroom. Figuring he could focus on what it looked like later, he quickly went to the bed and eased them onto it.
(Should I put these at the top?)
Steve couldn’t look away from Tony as he eased himself down. His cock disappeared into the smaller man’s body, the tightness alone making Steve unable to hold back his groan. Both of Tony’s hands rested on his chest now as he slowly pressed down until Steve was fully inside of him. They stayed there, silent except for the heavy sound of their breathing; Tony’s body shook gently under Steve’s hands.
“Go on a date.” Steve reached up, cupping Tony’s cheek. “Let me plan our next date?”
After a moment, Tony rolled to his side and focused his smile on Steve. He reached up and gently ran a hand through Steve’s hair. “Well, damn...”
“Many had already passed by the time this came out, but the family members thought it was done well.” Tony adjusted his position so he could straddle Steve’s lap. “Why?”
Steve felt a blush steal across his cheeks, but he didn’t stop Tony’s movements. He stepped back enough to finish pushing his jeans to the floor, toeing off his shoes before awkwardly stepping out of the rough fabric. When he straightened again, Tony gripped onto his sweater to pull Steve back into another kiss.
“I don’t think I’ll ever understand fashion,” Steve said finally, tugging at the hanging strap on Tony’s overalls. “Why?”
And while I watched the movie while writing most of this chapter, I still have a
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cameron loves the story and it’s been said that, for the time, it was probably the most historically accurate timeline of events. Minus the Rose and Jack stuff.” Tony traces his fingers across Steve’s thigh. “Apparently the ship actually broke into three pieces, but that wasn’t found out until
“I wouldn’t say no.”
“You know,” Tony said as the camera panned across a piano, “a lot of this is actual footage the director took when he was doing his own dives.”
This is my favorite stupid chapter because I'm a big fan of James Cameron and
do this. A place where nobody knew who he was and they wanted him for him (and his body), and not the titles he held.
Tony sealed the promise with a kiss and Steve felt himself get excited, almost unable to want to wait the whole week. He had a date.
Tony waved Steve’s apology away. “Nope, you just owe me one.”
Steve had grown up on stories of the Titanic. Born just six years after its sinking, the incident was still fresh on people’s minds and teachers loved to use it as a lesson of some kind or another. Seeing it as a Romeo and Juliet-type love story was a bit strange, but he soon lost himself in the story. Even Tony’s continuing facts didn’t deter his attention -- it only added to the experience.
Tony laughed, tugging Steve toward the door. “I knew there was a reason I liked you. Is dinner my choice? Are you allergic to anything?”
It wasn’t until Rose jumped out of her lifeboat that Steve said anything else. He let out a groan, swearing to himself as she ran through the crowds and back toward Jack. He wasn’t sure if he were angrier at Rose for being stupid, or himself for actually tearing up at the action. As it was, from then on, Steve could only stare at the finality of the tragedy played out on screen.
“Watch a tragedy?”
and will be further explained in the next chapter.
Did you spot Kelly and Yorkie? I couldn't leave them out! No 80's playlist for this chapter since I wrote it while re-watching the episode basically.
“If you hated me that much, you wouldn’t still be sitting here.”
Part of Steve wanted to push since he was supposed to be learning about the decade, but the happiness on Tony’s face made him ignore the urge to do so. Instead, he leaned in to give Tony another kiss, heart fluttering as the smaller man pressed against him.
Tony chuckled before tilting Steve’s chin up for a kiss. “Hell yes. And if this is you unsure, I can’t
Tony smirked. “Oh yeah, I saw a tear roll down your cheek. You sure you’re up for it?”
Steve laughed a little, turning to give him a soft smile. “Are you going to tell me everything you know?”
“Knew you missed me,” Tony said once the kiss broke. “And damn, you look good.”
Tony was quiet a moment before letting out a breath. “I could take you one day. If you’re up for it, I mean.”
Tony moved so he was half over Steve, fingers running through the spunk that was drying on his stomach. “What was it called... Swing dancing?”
“Is it?”
Before he could give in to temptation, an arm slipped around his waist and Tony leaned up to press a scratchy kiss to his cheek. Steve couldn’t help but grin, glad that no matter the decade, Tony refused to change his facial hair; Steve liked the look on him. He turned to give Tony a proper kiss, hand gently cradling Tony’s face.
” Steve tightened his hold and aimed for the same spot. Tony continued all but screaming out his approval as one hand reached back to grip onto the headboard as Steve moved faster.
. Four... four should be good. Maybe... Fuck I want you inside me
“Not fancy,” he said, not quite sure what ‘fun’ meant. “Surprise me, though.”
Chapter Twenty: This Brutal Love
"It's impossible for Howard to have kids, he is sterile from an experiment that… didn't go…well..." Steve trailed off.
“Come on. Quit dicking around and help me, this is serious.”
“Oh? This is a game? Good because I usually win at games.” He smirked.
"You found her!" Ellie squealed in delight and hopped from his lap then face planted into Angie's stomach.
“Uhh, good sort of? You?”
Then, as if drawn by the alluring siren call of hell itself, he slowly looked down upon Steve's broken comatose body lying deathly still upon the hospital bed in the infirmary of the tower. Like delicate crystal, the last of the recognizable fragments of Tony's broken heart shattered.
Tony woke up well into the next evening after becoming thoroughly acquainted with an expensive bottle of scotch.
“No, I was worried about you. I thought for sure you were going to get mauled by Lloyd’s dog after you beat the crap out of him.”
The man continued, "What year is it, anyway? No one operates that ancient contraption for fun." He said pointing to the mower.
She sighed. "I know you do. I just can't help but to fathom all the trouble my two darling flitter mice could get into while I'm gone." She pouted.
“You know, there was a time Steve could only dream of working with tools like this. Now, they are so accessible it’s kind of ridiculous.” The soldier mused lowly, his voice gravelly. “There was a time I believed that I would outlive Steve, with all his illnesses it was a given. But then the little shit had to go and get all enhanced and then I was absolutely sure that Steve was going to outlive all of us out of sheer stubbornness alone.” He uttered a bitter humorless laugh. “And yet…” He trailed off with a hitch in his throat.
“And your arm just looks so damn beautiful, purple and red really suit you.” Barnes added.
“Ooh yes! Excellent idea Cap!” Tony continued to laugh.
Natasha, having figured out what Steve and Tony were up to, told them all they needed to do was ask Jarvis.
Johnny nodded with fire in his eyes.
“Hello Doctor.” Steve responded.
He sighed miserably.
And so Steve fell into a restless sleep thinking about all of the ‘if onlys’ and ‘what ifs.’ If only he were faster. If only he had been stronger. What if he had realized sooner the danger had not passed? What if he was the man Bucky needed him to be? What if Bucky had lived?
And because of that Steve ended up broken, believing he existed in a world where Tony didn’t want him, in a world where the Captain could have very well believed Tony even hated him. There were so many things he could have done differently.
“Babydoll, inside voice.” He admonished.
“I owe Barton a thousand dollars.”
The elevator slowed to a stop and with a ding the doors opened.
It looked like a half plucked, horribly emaciated black bird with horns that looked like twisted worms wrapping around it scaly head. Black teeth lined its gnarled mahogany beak and haggard wings sprouted from its back just above a long sinewy serpentine like tail that lashed about irritatedly.
Beep. Beep.
“Hey Nat!” Steve said as he rushed out the door nearly running into her.
Peggy was not amused.
He also showed her all of the wonderful things too. He showed her life with his new family, the Avengers. He showed her all of his teams oddities and eccentricities and he also showed her Tony, the real Tony. He showed the beautiful man he found beneath the money, fame and bad attitude. He showed her the man he fell in love with, the profound and compassionate and generous person hid away from everyone.
He looked into her eyes, Peggy's eyes.
“Oooh so strong!” The drunk genius’s shouted as he started running his hands over the Captains strong biceps.
"That's a promise I'll have you keep, Rogers!" She smirked.
Maggie was rocking Eli whose wails had died down after the mood shifted back to a positive note. He was still a little fussy but was now falling asleep. The poor baby must be hungry by now. They all probably were.
Though he meant 'us' as in all of humanity, the whispered emphasis he put into that single word spoke volumes more of what he really felt deep in his heart.
Steve thought he could kiss Tony forever.  Somehow this was the most at peace his heart has felt in well…  Nearly a century.
“I’ll make it quick then.” He said as he took a pile of clean clothes into the bathroom with him.
“That doesn’t explain why you broke him out of prison.” Clint retorted.
“Listen, has Steve ever been wrong in his judgment of character?”
Tony sighed watching himself. That day was a real turning point for him. Steve had no idea that it was in those next moments Tony had decided to take the plunge and go down with the ship that was there on touching go relationship.
“Fuck You! Everything I said is true! Steve is everything to me. If I could take his place I would. I begged on my hands and knees for that crazy bitch to take me instead.” He really did.
Steve stopped mid bite on his fourth sandwich.
“Dumbass, are you always this jumpy? You did say the offer was still open, didn’t you?” Barnes smirked at Tony.
Steve thought back to an unfortunate or at least unfortunate day for Tony as the genius couldn’t help but challenge the Captain to a drinkathon.  Needless to say it did not end up well for Tony.
A/N: And another one bites the dust. Now I seriously cried writing this one. It was definitely a hard one to get through. I hope you all enjoyed it even through all the potential sniffles. It’s going to get worse before it gets better. We still have to find Bucky and deal with the fallout that comes with that and watch Steve get thrown back in time at the end of chapter 25. Please stayed tuned for the next leg of the adventure!
Steve steadfast ignored him.
He was after all the one who noticed the woman’s face in the reflection. This is a huge breakthrough.
Steve noticed that his restraints were being removed by her invisible hands. She swiftly unshackled, unchained, and unbound his various restraints. She lifted him easily in her arms, as if he were a small child. Steve could hear his blood to drip onto the steel floor.
"Where are we?" He murmured in awe.
After a fairly epic and daring rescue that involved a god, a man with breath taking anger management issues, and a couple of master assassins, Captain America and Iron Man got out of the tunnel relatively in one piece which eventually led to a magnificent phase of stunning, wholesome team bonding. Most important though was Steve and Tony’s relationship.
First he had to figure out how to disarm him. If he could strike with his shield against his hand at the right moment... That plan went out the window, however, when the soldier in turn disarmed our Captain.
Before he even took one step in the direction back to the others a strange sensation overtook him.  His back went ramrod straight and the hair on his body stood on end.  Something in the air shifted and Steve knew even before it happened there was a bad vibe in the air.
End Chapter Eighteen
“Daddy!” Ellie shouted, poking him painfully in the ribs. “You missed the turn.”
He tried to laugh it off, "I'm sorry, Babydoll, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm just very worried about your mom and the baby." He tried to be reassuring.
“This whole thing seems very familiar to me.  Like an old legend my father told me so very long ago.  Give me time to dig into the archives I’m certain I will find something useful.  But let me leave you with this warning if this is in fact related to the legends of old that I am referring then there is likely no cure for the fallen.”
Eventually, my wish was granted.
"You know, Cap, just lying there while we do all the fighting isn't fair one bit." Iron Man said standing over Captain America who had just taken a beating and an even worse landing.
Peggy turned to Steve and frowned slightly.
“Tony, what did you do?” Steve chuckled.
Steve found out real fast that it was a futile to argue with them.  They absolutely refused to see his side of it, not to mention that it was a thousand times more infuriating because they were all still hiding something and it definitely had to do with why they kept insisting on putting him on house arrest “for his own good.”
She nuzzled his neck pleasantly and began to hum a lullaby. Steve chuckled at her. He ran his hand through her hair and gently massaged her scalp. Steve's smile widened when she went totally limp against him.
The moment Calamity’s lips came in contact with his own the entire world shifted. He felt Iron Man’s cold armor wrap around him before an impression similar to traveling through the Bifrost overcame him. This time, however, it was not painless. He could vaguely hear Tony’s voice. Steve could not understand what was said, he only recognized the sound.
From the promise of obscene murder in the Soldiers eyes, Tony was sure that Steve’s words were true. He glanced down at the letter in his hands. Now all he needed to know was how much Barnes knew about what happened to Steve. Judging from his thunderous, murderous expression he knew exactly what Tony came here for.
“Cap, are you okay!?” Tony’s voice rang out.
As I’ve mentioned before Steve goes back in time chapter 25 so you all definitely have that to look forward to next chapter. We’re about to reach the approximate half way point of the story I hope you all have enjoyed the ride so far.
The Captain chuckled as he stooped to pick her up. He tossed her in the air and caught her easily as she laughed excitedly.
It was so odd how the first details to fade were the most important ones, like the man's eyes, nose and mouth. Even odder still was how thoroughly and completely his dream erased from his mind so quickly. The only thing he knew for sure by breakfast time was that a man operated the futuristic armor. That's it. He could not ascertain age, race, or any other physical attributes except that he was definitely male. Yet, Steve knew with absolute certitude that he could see the man clearly in his mind the moment he woke up. Thus, his rush to the sketchbook in the early hours of the morning.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re unbelievable.” Tony huffed.
“Hells Yeah, who the hell do you think you are talking to. Hopefully Thor will be able to dig up more information.”  Tony stated with his own patented brand of snark.
Steve opened his eyes and blinked slowly up at Iron Man. "Just shut up and help me up." Captain America said holding his hand up for Iron Man to take.
He screamed in agony and fell to his knees. Just a few hundred more feet to go.
“Come on, come on!” He urged in a whisper, watching as the progress bar loaded at an agonizing pace.
You were right before when you said it wouldn't be possible without encroaching on free will. This is the only way I've found that will make peace possible. With this, people will choose to be peaceful on their own and not because someone bribing them or is standing behind them with a club."
Calamity’s face lit up joyfully in exhilaration and appeared almost relieved.
“I also elaborated on a few things.”  Johnny added.
Six long hours later the score ended with Tony 26 to Barnes 22. Oh, and the operation went smoothly, well mostly smoothly. All of the bone anchors, hardware and cybernetics had been implanted perfectly. Tony was immensely pleased with the outcome. Barnes was now with Nat and Barton in recovery. He said that he could profoundly feel the difference.
“Ehem, yeah, and we just played some of the old fashioned outdoor games.  Tag was the most popular, and hiding’n go seek tag was a nice twists I introduced to them.  Then the dad came home from work via carpool.  I expected them to get quiet, to become well behaved and respectful.  But when they realized his arrival they screamed so jovially and excitedly I thought there was a fire or something.
“Thank you Buck, we should be heading out anyway we gotta stay on the move.”
Bucky smiled that cocky smile once more before silently mouthing “’Till the end...”
“What are you doing just standing there, dumbass?” Barnes landed unsteadily beside him. He was babying his right side and was breathing heavily.
Bucky’s eyes widened marginally. He knew exactly the kind of power Tony held over him.
That light feeling faded however after snuggling into his bed to sleep. After showing Peter his painting in talking to Tony it’s like the floodgates opened, like picking a scab off a healing wound.
This was how the Rhododendron was able to accomplish all these fantastical, horrible and seemingly impossible things. She was helping him…
Xavier is constantly reading everyone’s minds. He knows that Tony's lashing out was not caused by the professors information but by Fury reprimanding Steve for asking fair questions. It was his right to ask them.
He backed away slowly. He worked his way back to his medical room. No, not his. Nothing here was really “his.” This was a prison.
Steve obeyed dutifully, opening his legs wide, watching the genius intently. Tony knelt down between his legs and began to run his hands up Steve's thighs, over his firm abdomen and strong pectoral muscles. Then back down over his biceps.
End Chapter Fifteen
Whatever perverse game Tony was playing was just about to backfire. Steve kissed him back fervently hoping to convince everyone of his supposedly complacency once more.
“Will you tell me where?” Steve asked quickly.
Time passes and slow progress is made. Darkness lurks just on the horizon, Tony is trying his best to keep his head above the water. He helps in Barnes's recovery any way he can.
“No.  Goodnight Tony, stay out of trouble.”  Steve said as he smiled wickedly and Tony.
“Right, yeah!” He croaked out as he bolted out of the room.
Suddenly he could no longer feel or hear anything like he was floating in a dark and eternal void. The last thing he could feel before he completely fell into the welcoming piece of unconsciousness was the all-too-familiar sensation of ice then he was gone.
“Finally! Oh my dearest love, I wish you all the luck in the world!” She said before grabbing Steve’s face and pressed a kiss to his lips.
They were huddled together tightly, completely surrounded. He barreled through the swarm and roared,
Steve took in the subtle curve of the man's sculpted button nose, the way his lips frowned in concentration and the angle of his stylized beard. Though the man wore sunglasses that were oddly shaded blue, Steve knew with absolute certainty that he had wide brown eyes, knew with utter assurety that this was the mysterious man that had plagued his dreams for days.
"I happened." She answered as the scene shifted back to the lively colorful one again.
Steve and Johnny, however, still could not stand each other. Upon their first meeting their similarities in appearance did not go unnoticed, by anyone. After a few ridiculously inappropriate jokes made by Clint and Tony, Johnny responded with attitude and wit that could rival them both. Throwing Steve in the middle of it had been a terrible mistake. It somehow ended up in a battle of doppelgangers. Though Johnny had proven to be fantastically fast and hot against Captain America’s cool composure, a well planted patriotic fist in his face put him in his place. Their relationship had been touch and go ever since. Sue adores Steve, however, go figure.
Tony walked in with that superior cocky air about him that usually pisses people off immediately.  However, Steve knows he does that to stay confident and in control when he’s unsure of himself or nervous.  He finds it ironic that Tony’s approach, meant to put people off, only served to make Steve more relieved.  He’s glad to know Tony was just as uncomfortable as he was.
“It doesn’t have to be this way.” She said evenly.
Did she know Tony was two timing him? She mustn’t have. She knew how he felt about Tony. She wouldn’t have let it get that far if she knew about Pepper.
Tears slid down the Soldiers cheeks and Tony knew in that moment that it wasn’t his sacrifice alone to bear. Everyone who knew Steve would also be making this sacrifice and forced to live with the outcome.
Tony rolled his neck and shrugged his shoulders before recounting exactly what had transpired the last week or so since the events of San Jose in a spectacular display of word vomit. By the end of it he was sure his team probably only got about half of that.
“Just because I’m working-”
“Darling, if you go take your nap now like a good little girl, when you wake up perhaps Daddy will take you out to get ice cream.”
“Do not worry Captain, he sleeps.”
He displayed the contents of his phone onto the large monitor of the room. It flashed on and showed the image of the woman in the vicinity of six of the eight victims. Obviously Tony’s filter doing its job.
Steve just nodded along knowing if Tony was serious enough there would be no way he could say no.  Somehow though he didn’t mind.
The translator began to tremble almost violently but nodded weakly in submission.
“Go on.” He smirked.
Bucky pulled away slowly, his earlier cocky countenance gone.
Barnes nodded in awe.
The Captain took a few steps back to give Iron Man room enough to land. Tony touched down soon enough and piece by piece the armor that had enveloped his body lifted away, revealing the handsome man beneath. Steve licked his lips at the sight.
Steve looked away red in the face.  Oh boy does he hate when Tony does that.  “It has been one heck of a day Cap; I think it is high time to turn in.  There’s not much we can do at this point aside from getting in the way.”  Tony gestured to the door.
“Stop it!” Barnes wailed in an angry laugh.
“Well what about Thor?” Kevin asked as he helped Tommy into the jacket Captain America handed them.
“Okay, Tony cracks the code under the right conditions and she keeps the Keystone and that’s it, the world saved?”
And there they were, thousands of little fluff balls of death floating around the city. Everyone stared at the screen slack jawed for a moment. Honestly after everything you would think that things would stop surprising them. Obviously not.
"Sounds fun."
“Guys, that’s like a major felony.” Scott added.
According to one of the latest spreads, people are calling for Captain America to make a comment on the rise in villainous activity and the strange coma cases. And now most recently his absence has not gone unnoticed regarding the Baltimore massacre. The people are demanding why Captain America has abandoned them. Pepper could not sidestep their questions for long. No one could know the truth, however, at least not yet. If the world found out that Captain America had fallen… It would cause pandemonium.
The Captain sighed deeply in defeat.
“As good as it’s going to get for now.” He replied sharply.
“I love you too Ellie, so so much.” He said back as he buried his right hand into her beautiful golden curls.
Steve smirked deviously, leaned in and gave Tony a lingering tender kiss before releasing him.
“I know.”
They both knew the risk, however.
“Yeah, I know.” He sighed. “I thought I’d try anyway.”
He launched it. It went right through her and was merely sucked into the void.
“I promise. I swear I will!”
Soon there would be no more of this. In a matter of days there was a good chance he was going to cease to exist. A few hours ago that thought scared the living shit out of him. However, since then he’s come to find a modicum of peace with. He was sure Tony was going to figure out how to use the code. He was happy that the others could be saved, even if he could not. He found peace and that knowledge.
Well there goes his ribs again. They began to cough up blood and started to wheeze. That punch took out a lung as well. The soldier hesitated. Before our Captain could properly recover however, the dark assailant produced yet another knife.
Steve's heart twisted in misery, he couldn't bear it.
Everyone else was slightly confused about the revelation.  They know what it means but not so much what it really has to do with the situation.
Johnny approached them, “She was here?!  What did she say?”
“The way you captured Coney Island also, there aren’t words.” Steve said distantly.
“Hey Cap, you just going to stand there all day?”
“Is it because of what happened?  Whatever it is that I am not meant to know about?”  Steve asked tiredly not expecting a straight answer and was entirely shocked when he received one.
“Mission success.” He responded with a cocky smirk. “I don’t think I was spotted considering I made it back here in one piece.”
“Thank you, Father.” Thor replied with a scowl. He somehow managed to make it look respectful, considering.
“Oh, I am so glad you’re okay.”  She said as her expression became a bit wet.
The Professor, Fury, and Pepper were invaluable when it came to keeping things together, but they each had their own missions to perform. Fury, still director of SHIELD, had agents to oversee and had to figure out how SHIELD had become compromised and how to possibly stop it. Xavier, still willing to help, also had what was left of the school and the X-Men to take care of and their own missions to pursue. Pepper, the Angel (seriously), continued to manage his company and served as a buffer for the journalist and media.
How on earth had he not seen it before? He was a goner even then. When had his sketches transitioned from Peggy and other elements from the 40s to his new team and Tony? He flipped through more pages to see his teammates faces pop up again. He noted Tony showing up with increased frequency until that’s all there was. The last one before his sketch from earlier was a very provocative scene where pieces of his Ironman armor were coming off to show his unclothed skin underneath. His body was posed in a tantalizingly erotic manner.
“It tingles weird.” Barnes whined in a growl.
Maybe deep down he really does…
“What the fucking hell was that!? You were going to leave me behind, you stupid prick!” He shouted as he grabbed Tony by the neck pinning him to the wall.
"Where's the fun in that?" Tony remarked matching Steve smirk with one of his own. Steve watched him expectantly. "Okay fine! Steve, my beautiful Captain America–"
Then the tears fell.
Steve groaned. He did not want to talk about what happened with Tony. At all. Bucky already had a negative perception of the genius and he really did not feel like getting into it in front of the twins.
“Ugh, I’ll have to go soon, the vultures are flying.” She shook her head.
He said to just hold on. He could do that, couldn’t he? Even if his vision was going black around the edges…
Immediately Steve felt blood rush to his face. He knew how terrible of an idea that was.
"You answering yes to me wasn't part of your test. Like I said it was always meant to happen, one way or another."
Here he was pestering this guy and Barnes was laying there strapped to copious amounts of medical equipment with an impressive bullet hole in his chest. Even more vexing, Tony thought, is when in the hell did he begin to care.
The Avengers are officially on the case. A lot of trying to figure stuff out with out killing each other.
“Thank you, Jarvis.”
Those were merely simulations however, now they are on an actual mission. Let’s keep our fingers crossed.
The human figure moved and handed the bright orb of light to the tiny crystal.
Steve regarded him before he exited the room.
Back on the otherside…
It really hurt the Captain to see this man in this state. Steve reached out and grasped the man on the shoulder. The man flinched and backed away.
On the other side.
Two minutes.
“Mr. Barnes is awake, Sir.” Jarvis replied.
Steve smiled broadly, his heart melting into a warm fluffy pile of goo.
Tony snapped, “Stop FUCKING with me Barnes and answer my question! What is this!?” He demanded with a bellow, his entire heart was on the line.
Wonderful!
“Okay.” Tony let out something of a sigh of relief. He could almost make out signs of his own relief mirrored on the Maximoff girl’s face. ‘Well that’s a good sign.’ He thought, but they were far from done, unfortunately.
She began pulling out more blank pages and the rest of her colors. She handed him the paper with a grin.
“Yes very.”  Steve replied sarcastically.  “You should really know better than to cross her.”
“I have…” His response was laced with cold venom. “I can’t trust any of you!” He roared.
‘Well,’ Tony thought with a sigh of relief, ‘We just might get through this after all.’
“You should let me.”
And so he fell asleep taking comfort in the fact that he got to spend his last night on earth with his brother safe in his arms, one last time.
“How can I shut up and answer you?”
Lastly, the third reason was born out of obligation and lack for a better word, irony. As it would happen, Barnes refused to go along with the procedure if Tony was not present. Through their banter of constant, unyielding bickering and throwing around salty barbed insults like rotten eggs, they had somehow created something of a dysfunctional camaraderie that no one but Wanda and the Professor seem to understand. It was utterly unnerving to most members of the team yet they had all somehow accepted it with a sigh and shake of the head.
“As ready as I’ll ever be I suppose.”  The Captain stated staring out at the darkness beyond the bay doors.
"Uh… The horrible super adaptable ones…"
"What isn't."
Tony stared at him blinkingly.
Steve was not gonna lie.  It hurt, it hurt like hell.  And that’s saying a lot considering everything he’s been through the last couple weeks.  As the others conversed amiably together, Steve silently and stealthily left to go back to his studio.
Steve resisted the urge to roll his eyes. He had to play nice. He had to make sure none of them caught onto his plans.
“I know.” He admitted, looking Steve in the eye conveying without saying word that he knew what was coming, he felt it too. “But it matters to me.” He stated finally, giving Steve no room to argue.
Fury wanted so deeply to tell Xavier to ‘Fuck Off’ instead he regained his composer and remembered his position. The Director nodded reluctantly and shouted out the last of his orders to the flustered and frantic agents. They scurried away to carry out their commands. The Director sighed and found that he had the overwhelming urge to shoot something.
“How do you choose? What made you deem earth worthy enough of the cut?” Tony spat out, his displeasure at the situation holy on concealed.
abandoned crutch lying on his bed.
“Oh no, oh God, you have that look about you. Like the one Steve got when he came up with a really stupid and suicidal plan.” Bucky commented almost exasperated.
“Wow, that thing is actually in you.” He whispered roughly in awe as he gently pulled away.
“Yes we do! Your soldiers blood is on these, we cannot leave a trace of it for the enemy to find.” He replied sharply.
He lifted Steve’s gown to half look over the injury and make sure he didn’t strain his stitches and half to find pod evidence.
"Indeed. And that's far from the end of it. Even then you still wholly resisted my pull. Your mind and resolved were as strong and indestructible as your vibranium shield. Your body, so enhanced, kept your mind stable. So, when the opportunity arose, I took away your ability to heal. I then put a wall in your mind so no other could interfere."
"I am not. It is as it should be." She smiled.
By the time Steve had finished the dishes and had successfully gotten Ellie on the school bus, he had completely forgotten about the odd dreams with the mysterious man in the flying suit of armor. He made his way around the property, taking note of the things that he would need to get to eventually, like mowing the lawn, trimming the hedges, and cleaning up other yard debris fallen from the trees.
Sorry for any and all mistakes.
Hook, line and sinker.
“Come on, let’s get ready. They could show up anytime.”
The monitor kept beeping.
A soft blue light…
‘Well if Harker is down there, then where…?’
Tony nodded, oh how he knew how truly elusive sleep could be.
Steve took in his surroundings once more then looked down at his burning wrist.
Tony took a sharp breath and Steve began to use his thumb to caress soothing circles over the genius’s tight grip.  Before the Captain could ask his next question Tony beat him to it.
He groaned pathetically into his hands once more. Why is this so fucked up!?
Who the Fuck knows.
Tony took out his phone and looked at it, then groaned as if his very life force was draining away. Everyone still coherent stared at Tony expectantly.
“How did he? How did the boy who dreamed about becoming a getaway driver end up as Brooklyn’s most wanted mob boss?” Tony asked, the question out before he could stop it.
“Easy, I’m trying to help you.”
Rumlow laughed, “What about them? Your family?”
Steve studied Fury in that moment, he’d always respected how smart the man was, and now it seemed even then he’d underestimated Fury. He had clearly been working this case on his own, unable to let it lie. Perhaps he was more like Steve than he realised.
“He threatened us. I had to. He wasn’t going to stop, Steve. He would have…”
“I don’t know!” Sitwell cried out, “I know he’s ex-army. I know he has plans. He wants your patch, Captain. He wants you gone and he’ll stop at nothing to get it.”
Steve was the one who pulled back first, hand moving to the dried blood on Tony's temple with a scowl, "They'll die for this. I promise. I'm sorry they took you, I didn't think..."
Steve sighed, “I know.”
“Why?”
Tony.
Tony’s hands reached inside Steve’s jacket, pushing the formal wear from his shoulders so it could slide down his arms and hit the floor at his feet. Next, his fingers moved up to the bowtie Steve had handsomely been sporting all night, deftly working on unknotting it, knuckles brushing against Steve’s throat every so often.
“They aren’t signed.” Natasha told him, nodding towards the papers.
“Nat, you and Tony take the back. Find the bombs Rumlow has been making and disable them. Destroy them. Whatever puts them out of commission.” Steve ordered as Natasha stepped closer to Tony.
“I went to my father and made a deal for you. I helped break you out of jail. Because I love you, Steve. Whether it’s the smart decision or not is irrelevant now. I’m too far into this with you.” Tony replied, closing the gap between them until his hands were stroking down Steve’s shoulders and Tony was standing between his legs.
Tony scoffed, “No one knows your name, just your titles. Your reputation.”
“I said Ross is in town.” Fury repeated, “He arrived this morning and started shaking up the whole station. Replacing people he thought might be on your payroll or Hydra’s. He assembled his own team for this within an hour. This is the last call you’re going to get from me. You’re on your own now.”
“He was Hydra. He was a bad person. He was Hydra.” Tony told him, the sobs dying out, but he was still shaking.
“How long?” Steve demanded.
“And watch them get themselves killed.” Steve finished, “This guy is ex-army. He’s smart and he clearly has no issues with killing cops. We need to know who he is before we go after him. We need to know who we’re up against.”
Steve couldn’t rest. His mind was a beehive ready to explode. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from Tony afraid he might disappear should Steve so much as shift in their nest of blankets. Tony didn’t seem to mind, mirroring Steve as they both laid on their sides. They were fully dressed under the covers despite Natasha’s order, ready for anything at a moment’s notice.
He pulled back when he felt Tony’s teeth scrape his lip, “I need to know what it will take for you to leave. To decide my lifestyle, me, is too much. I need to know where you draw the line, Tony.” Steve pleaded, “Whether it’s kidnapping you to get to me or me missing a date because I have to kill someone. I need to know what it will take for this to end.”
“I fear our Captain is about to be making a bigger one.” Thor sighed.
“I know what you are.” Steve told him, “Rumlow told me everything.”
“I do love you.”
“I hate to say this because it makes me sound like you and you know I hate that.” Tony sighed, “But some of us have work to do. You’re welcome to hang out here with me and the Kid though. We can do lunch after I finish the work on this jeep.”
Tony laughed, “This whole man of mystery thing is going to get old fast.”
“Well, you hoped wrong.” Tony told him.
“He went to the docks, down to Rumlow’s base at the shipment yard. He said you’d need details of the operation before you guys made a move.” Tony explained.
He sighed, “I’m sorry that happened to you, Tony.”
“I probably won’t even see him again.” Steve replied with a bite to his voice.
His phone buzzed in his pocket and Tony pulled it out to see Steve’s name on the screen. It hit the message to open it up.
“That won’t kill you, but it is going to hurt like a bitch.” Steve told him, “Let’s try an easier question. What’s the plan? Kill a few cops, get my team to take the fall?”
Tony shook his head, “Not anymore. I’ve been disowned so people would be stupid to try it now. I’m pretty sure Howard would rather just let me get tortured until they get bored. It happened a few times when I was sixteen, seventeen. I was being fitted as the Stark Industries heir back then so I got a lot of unwanted attention.”
Steve just had to wait and play the game, and thanks to Ross he was getting good at waiting.
Steve pushed that out of his mind as he entered the garage, gun in hand. He headed down the steps steadily, heavy feet announcing his entrance.
Peter nodded, “Then why…”
The sound of a phone ringing startled him, and Steve clenched his hands into fists to stop them from shaking. It wasn’t his phone. He reached on the floor for the suit jacket at the end of the bed, fishing out Pierce’s phone from the pocket. He knew who was calling, who else would it be?
Sitwell spat, “I don’t know anything.”
Steve brought him up and back down again, Rumlow gripping onto his wrists to get him to stop, “There was a bomb.” Steve replied, trying to shake the images from his mind.
“No. He isn’t.”
Steve revelled in moments like this. They were so few and far between that he always tried to take a moment to allow himself to enjoy the time with his family. They were all tightly packed into the living room of their house, the room warm and cosy thanks to the number of bodies in it. Movie nights were something of a tradition for The Avengers, or they used to be, Steve couldn’t actually remember the last time they had found the time to have one.
"Good, so let's rip them up." Clint cut in, snatching the papers from Bruce's grip.
Bucky shuffled in his seat, clearly awkward, “You needed back up.”
“You want to do this now?” Steve demanded, “Really?”
Steve snorted, “Charming.”
“What about yours?” Natasha countered, “Fight. For me?”
Tony had left home at the age of 18, heading straight to MIT and blocking all of Howard’s calls. He was a free man and he definitely wasn’t going back home. Those days were over. He told Howard as much when he called Rhodey for a lift to MIT and vowed he wanted nothing to do with a drunk asshole of a father or his business in building weapons that killed people.
That led to them showering together and having sex again in the shower before Steve knew he needed to get back to reality because the others would be home soon, and he definitely knew having Tony there wouldn’t go down well. He walked Tony out and to his car like a proper gentleman and gave him one last heart stopping kiss before letting him go.
“It’s your show, remember?” Steve smiled at him.
“This is my place of work, alright. I can’t just be walking the halls with a mob boss like we’re best friends.” Fury replied with a scowl.
“Yes.” Natasha replied curtly, legs moving down another corridor as Tony jogged to keep up.
He was already striding down the corridor when Fury caught up with him, “Hey! You want to tell me what that was about back there?”
“Because I believe you. I believe you want to help your city and I’m offering you that chance. You’re not a monster, Steve, no matter what you think of yourself. You’re a war veteran who saw some messed up shit fighting another man’s war and who couldn’t shake it. I’ve seen killers up close and you’re not like them.” Fury replied softly.
“Cap! Thor’s back!” It was Sam’s voice that shouted down to the garage and caused Steve to remember himself and pull back.
Tony seemed to stiffen at the thought, eyes finding Steve’s again, “How do you do it?”
Thor came bursting through the door of the shipment yard, a bloody picture of joy with his hammer, “No Hydra members left alive, Captain.”
“I’m not doing this. I have your name; I have your blood but that’s it. We’re not family and I don’t owe you a damn thing.” Tony replied, “Not anymore. I’m not going to help you create a weapon that could be used to kill innocent people, but I hope it will get you to stop resenting me. I’m not seventeen anymore. I don’t need your affection that badly.”
Tony looked almost sheepish, “I’m not sure about this.”
Steve didn’t think Tony needed a verbal answer to that question because the rock-hard cock in his jeans and his blown pupils were probably answer enough, “Take your pants off.” Steve asked him, already heading over to Tony’s toolbox to grab their supplies. He threw them into the driver’s seat of the car Tony had been working on as Tony rid himself of his pants, shoes and socks.
Steve hated the idea of that, of wanting Tony beyond reason or sense yet whenever he tried to talk some sense into himself, he’d remember the way Tony said his name or his laugh or the sound he made when he came and suddenly Steve didn’t seem to care much for sense anymore.
“What do you want?” Steve replied.
He had his earphones in, so he hadn’t heard Steve’s arrival, humming to himself as he smoothed a rag over the newly fixed metal of Steve’s car. Steve could see it gleaming from where he stood, Tony had done a good job.
He snapped out of his pacing, the echo of his last name pulling him back into the room like he was a young trainee in the army again. He couldn’t help how his body instantly stilled, standing up a little straighter. He fought the urge to salute.
He stripped off his own clothes as quickly as possible until he was just as naked as Tony before leading him into the shower. Tony went numbly, and Steve followed him into the steam and the spray of the water, shutting the frosted door behind them.
“What if I slip Steve a way out? I’ll make something he can use to open the cell door. The schematics will show what kind of locking system there is, and I can use that to create a small device to that frequency to open the lock. I leave the station, Steve goes back to his cell, he gets himself out. We’re waiting, ready for the extraction.” Tony finished, amazed at his own self-confidence to build such a device that would secure Steve’s freedom.
Tony shuffled then, moving in Steve’s lap so his legs could stretch out into the driver’s seat and he was pressed against Steve’s side with an arm around his shoulders. Steve placed a sweaty kiss to Tony’s shoulder in response.
Tony sighed, “Whoever you are, you better show yourself now!” He shouted, feeling like an idiot for even doing it, “I’m serious. I’m armed and I’m pissed off.”
"You can't be serious." Clint replied.
“Which is?”
“This is about survival. You make me weak and it’s going to get me killed. It’s going to get them killed, Bucky was right. I’ve killed people for a lot less than that, Tony.” Steve told him, trying not to let his own tears fall.
Steve had been placed under house arrest, along with the rest of the Avengers as a precaution to his deal with Fury whilst he worked to set up the new unit and convince his superiors that he could control the once Captain and that this path was the best one to achieving their shared aim. That meant he was useless for the first time in years and Steve found himself slowly going crazy. He had his family and Tony around him and that was the important thing, but he hated the constant waiting.
Tony eyed the dull grey walls again, “You ever heard of a can of paint?”
“You kill me and Tony will never forgive you.” Rhodes hissed out.
Tony was still in bed when Steve came back from his run the following morning, sprawled out amongst the covers with a boyish sort of peace on his face. Steve was sweaty from his run, having pushed himself harder than normal. He needed to. He needed everything in his head to calm down for a moment, he needed to just not think about the mess they were in and the things he might have to do to fix it.
“You can and you will.” Natasha told him firmly, “Hydra isn’t attacking right now so you can take an evening. Head to Sam’s, get a drink, lose some tension on those shoulders.”
It seemed everyone in his life was checking out.
He had experience with this. Back in the army, all those missions on foreign soil where they had to work quickly, he developed a skill for seeing things other people couldn’t. A shift in the soil that looked recent could suggest a hole was dug up in the ground for an IUD. A downwards pull of a coat that looked like it was weighed down by heavy pockets could mask a bomb underneath. It was all in the little details, the small things that didn’t add up. Anyone could see the evidence staring right at them but it took a trained eye to spot the small things that didn’t fit with the scene.
Tony was escorted into a small room at the end of a corridor, not a cell or an interview room like he had first thought. Instead he was pressed into a box room with a small slit window. The room was once a storage cupboard of some kind and now seemed to act as an office.
Steve knew he was close; he was tense and moving constantly. It wasn’t about anything more than his release and there was nothing more beautiful than Tony Stark chasing his own passion. He wasn’t even making coherent sounds anymore, just gasps and pants of pleasure as Steve worked that second orgasm from his body.
Steve bit his lip as he waited for a reply, watching the three little dots appear on the message.
Tony was panting and sweating, and Steve knew he was close, his fingers were stretching him open and his cock was leaving a wetness against his thigh. His whole body was shaking as he watched Tony lose himself to his pleasure.
Steve sighed, “I need you to say it, Tony. I need to hear it.”
Chapter contains smut and gore!
Ross wasn’t moving, his eyes were frozen in panic. Tony had killed him. He’d killed him. He had to. He wasn’t going to stop, he was going to come for Steve, for Natasha and Thor and Sam and Bruce. For Tony. They wouldn’t have been safe. He was Hydra, he was a bad person.
“He’s been through a hell of a shock to his system and he’s still fighting. If we can replace the blood he lost and keep on top of any infection he’ll be okay. Mentally though, that’s going to take a toll.” Bruce sighed, “It’s going to be a long-haul process.”
Tony knew they were done talking about it and didn’t press the issue. He grabbed a couple mugs in his hands whilst Natasha skilfully grabbed the rest and followed her out into the living room to distribute the coffee to the rest of the rag-tag family Tony had all but stumbled into.
Steve looked down at it. There was blood staining his cuff, “There was a situation. I took care of it.”
Tony stirred in the sheets, but he didn’t wake. God, Steve would never tire of having him here. In his life, his home, his bed. How had Steve earned this right? This privilege? Tony was a masterpiece in skin, all tanned and warm and plaint and Steve knew every inch now. He’d mapped it with his hands and his mouth so many times and still he wanted another.
The sight that greeted him in the garage wasn’t what Steve was expecting. He nodded to Sam on the stairs, effectively relieving him from his duty and letting him go upstairs for some food. Steve continued down the steps where the sound of rock music was playing, softly enough to not be heard outside this room but loud enough to seem out of place with the rest of the house. Steve spotted the Mechanic instantly, a flash of dark hair bend over his motorbike as he hummed to himself and twisted a spanner around one of the bolts.
“What do we do now?” Tony asked, “Natasha and Thor? Are they still here?”
“You should have told me.” Tony replied, bringing a hand up to rub his forehead, “We could have come up with something else. Or I could have played along.”
“Do I look like the kind of guy that needs back-up?”
He took the knife from Tony’s fingers, slipping it back into his boot before standing straight again. They had gone closer. Close enough that Steve could see the gold flecked in Tony’s eyes and the smear of oil on his cheek. He could see where the hair fell over his forehead and the glisten of sweat on his tanned skin. Steve swallowed thickly.
The little gasps Tony gave grew in volume, at first hushed whispers between them turning to louder moans when he started rutting against Steve faster.
“I’m going to give you so much more than that.” Steve replied, “I’ll give you Hydra’s leader. His name, his background, his plan. I’ll give you his contacts in the government and your own police force and I’ll even go so far as to give you all the evidence you need to put him away.”
Tony was left with a bruising cheek and a sense of dread in the pit of his stomach. He only had one thought, not about the Jericho or even about Steve.
“Yeah, right.” Rhodey sneered.
Steve frowned, following her gaze over to the dent in his vintage car with a genuine smile on his face. If only Natasha knew the half of it. She might be right though; he would need to get that dent out of the side of the car door and Tony was a good mechanic. It would be rude not to ask him to take a look, right?
Rumlow kicked Howard again, a groan escaping the man’s lips. Steve frowned, “I’ve never met Howard Stark before.”
Tony moaned in response, the dull ache of his shoulder sending shivers down his spine. Steve wasn’t done yet, moving his hand from Tony’s hip to wrap around his cock.
Tony nodded, “Yeah, piece of cake.” He looked at Steve then, “Does this mean I’m not staying in the car?”
He forced himself not to look over his shoulder, he couldn’t look jumpy. He had to be in control of this situation. He was The Captain, even with a broken heart and no way out, his audience would expect that of him.
He needed to figure out who was in charge of Hydra now, it was going to be the only way to find out how big of a threat this new leader was posing to his family and how immediately Steve needed to act. Thanks to Sitwell he already had a lead on the guy being army but that didn’t make him feel better, army men could be ruthless and were always highly intelligent. Especially the ones who went into organised crime.
He made his way up the stairs quickly, spotting a sign towards the locker room. He ducked in that door, peering around the corner to make sure it was empty. It was, much to Steve’s relief, and he slipped inside allowing himself a moment to breathe.
Fury scowled at him but Adam didn’t seem to be suspicious. He dropped his file on the desk and unzipped the body bag, pulling it out the way to reveal the body of Phil Coulson. He had a kind face, light brown hair that was thinning out due to age and stress and almost looked peaceful if it wasn’t for the angry red ‘A’ in the centre of his chest.
“Get to the docks. Report back when you have something for me.” Steve’s change of subject spoke volumes, “Get everyone else back to the house. I’m heading home now.”
“Well, as you can see, he didn’t slit my throat in my sleep, so I think we’re good.” Steve bit back, “It was just one night. It’s done. Let’s get back to work.”
“Brock Rumlow? Is that who you work for?” Steve tested, “You aren’t telling me a name if I guess it, right?”
“He loves you too, you know?” Bucky said softly, eyes drifting to the window again, “I don’t know if he realises it yet, but he does. I can tell.”
When his eyes did focus up on the dab grey walls of his cell, he realised he wasn’t alone. Sitting in the corner by the heavy-duty metal steel door was a man in a chair of his own. He wasn’t tied down like Tony was, merely content to read his paper and steal glances at Tony after every paragraph or so.
"Steve, don't be stupid. We don't know numbers or weapons or if he's even in there." Nat pointed out, her tone firm.
This was something else.
“Are you offering?” Steve said, the smile was there. Coy, alluring and almost dangerous.
“The mechanic?” Bruce asked cautiously.
He slid them back out again, pushing a third finger in along with the others this time, stretching Tony open even further. He curled all three fingers inside of him, getting a proper feel of his prostate that had Tony shaking above him and digging his nails into Steve’s shoulder blades.
Tony nodded, “So you killed him because you thought you could do a better job.”
“You better have more to this conversation then that one sentence.”
“They can and they have. Three killings make it a serial killer, Cap. Which makes it above my paygrade.” Fury sighed, “I’ll still be on the investigation, but I won’t be running it anymore. This will be the last time we meet.”
Nothing would have prepared Steve for the feeling of Tony Stark’s hands on his skin, rough fingertips moving over the muscles of his back in exploration as Tony brought his head up to find Steve’s mouth again. This kiss was urgent and hard, a firm press of lips as Tony’s sneaky hands moved to Steve’s chest, working over his abs at a teasing pace before dragging them up over his pecs. As soon as those rough fingers traced over his nipples Steve knew it was too late to talk himself out of this.
“You know when Steve found me, I was staring down four cops with guns. I was covered in blood, lost in rage and grief and willing to be shot down in the street to make them stop.” Thor replied, “Those were dark days. I didn’t know why Steve helped me; it was only later after he recruited me that I learnt he’d been following my movements for a while. He needed more muscle for his team, and I was ruthless. When I was about to give it all up, he came speeding into the street like a race car driver. Told me to get in if I wanted to live.”
“What’s happening?” Steve asked, feeling the metal give way, “I thought you were bringing Tony to me?”
Steve nodded, “Okay. That’s okay. Can you just trust me on this? I wouldn’t bring him back here if I wasn’t sure.”
It had to be.
Tony wiggled his ass against him again, “Fuck.”
Tony hummed, “I love you too.”
Bruce had his fingers to Bucky’s wrist, checking his pulse, “Okay, we’ll call you with updates. Just be careful. Rumlow is clearly a madman.”
“Thanks,” Steve replied, eyes moving away from his sketch to land on Bucky. He looked at tired as Steve did, “Late night?”
“I’m not right for you, Tony.”
“But you wanted Rumlow to kill him.” Tony guessed, “You don’t care about the bombs or Rumlow’s plans to rule Brooklyn. You want to clean the streets of gangs. As long as Steve Rogers is still alive, as long as there are Avengers walking those streets then you lose. And you hate it.”
The kiss was nothing short of dirty, sucking on Tony’s tongue as he bit at Steve’s lower lip. It was a battle for dominance, a spark that had turned into a wildfire. Steve pulled him closer, stealing the oxygen from Tony’s lungs and humming when he felt Tony’s hands on the back of his neck, fingers scratching at the ends of his hair.
Steve dug his phone out of his pocket and sent off a text to his old friend.
“I vote yes.” Sam called out with a shrug, “If we’re doing the vote now. Mine’s a yes. If the guy can make you smile, then that’s all the work he needs to do.”
Eventually, Tony touched his fingers to Steve’s, slowly moving them down towards his palm until his cold fingers were curling around Steve’s wrist and Steve was able to latch his own fingers around Tony’s.
Was this Hydra? Now he wasn’t under Steve’s protection were they trying to kidnap him for their side again? Or perhaps it was Steve? Come to finish the job and finally kill Tony to get him out the way?
“You lost tonight, and you know it.” Tony told him, voice low and firm, “You lost your leader. You lost your pay packet. You lost your victory.”
Tony smiled and waited for the voices to die down before pressing forward, “You give me five years and I’ll give you a fully self-sustaining Brooklyn. A city where children don’t have to know what it’s like when their parents can’t afford to pay the electricity bill. A city where children aren’t getting sick and weak from something as basic as no heating. We need to change the future. No, we can change the future and it starts right here in Brooklyn.” Tony finished, eyes staring straight into the camera and locking with Steve like he was talking directly to him. Steve felt his heart give a weird flip-flop in his chest, remembering a time not so long ago when he had told Tony his own story about growing up sick and poor in this very city.
Tony’s honey brown eyes held his firmly, a soft smile curving his mouth and a steel resilience in the way he held himself that told Steve all he needed to know.
The sparse rooms and cold concrete reminded Steve too much of the buildings they used to clear in Afghanistan. Bricks and mortar, nothing to suggest it had once been a home except an abandoned stuffed toy or a missing child’s shoe. Steve felt the same shivers creep up the back of his neck as he did in the army.
Bucky gave him a fake salute as he started the engine, “Just talk to him. Listen. Then make your decision, whatever that is.”
As soon as Bucky edged forward, Steve had an arm out to his right to hold him back. He could feel Bucky’s angry ebbing out from him like a furnace. Buck always did have a short fuse. If it wasn’t for his lack of patience Steve could have sworn he’d make a better mob boss than he did.
“Howard.” Tony greeted, ignoring the bile in his throat and adding venom to his voice. He couldn’t deal with this today.
But Steve needed to see Tony come first, he needed to know what Tony Stark looked like when he came undone. He shifted his weight to one hand, still bracing Tony’s leg as his other reached down between them for his cock.
“Because he managed to get a plan in place to ambush my team in the space of a month. He’s skilled and apparently impatient if these deaths are to do with Hydra. Trust me on this, I know army guys. They don’t like to wait around. I was working for Phillips again only a month after I got back from Afghanistan.” Steve replied, “And you’re holding the returning soldiers benefit for this year to make your campaign look good so I know you have the list.”
“It’s worse than we thought, Nat. Hydra is playing a bigger game here, the killings are the tip of the iceberg. We might not be walking away from this one.”
Fury huffed, “We can’t give you a deal like the others. You’re big league. Ross will rip up the paperwork and play the innocent but if we created a false trail that suggests you’ve been an informant of mine for a long time. Years. Then Ross wouldn’t be able to make that disappear. I’ll go on record and say it’s true and in return you give me everything you have on Hydra so we can bring them down the right way.”
Steve shrugged, “Just let me do this one thing. This last good thing for my family, for this city. Let me put an end to Hydra and then Ross can do what he wants with me. He can put me on a pyre in the middle of Brooklyn and read out my sins for the nation. I don’t care. I just care that they are safe.”
“I need to see him.”
Tony was already moving into him, nuzzling his face against Steve’s chest as Steve wrapped an arm around him, “I’ll stay.” He replied, unsure of what came over him because he definitely didn’t stay. At all. It was a rule. Fuck and leave. But Tony was curling into his chest and had come with his name on his lips. Steve’s actual name not just The Captain and Steve wanted to stay. For a bit. He felt Tony’s leg hitch up over his hips as he flung an arm over Steve’s chest and Steve knew he wanted to stay forever. To just live in this moment where he wasn’t a mobster and this wasn’t a one-night stand.
He found his boxers in their mess of clothes and stole the plain white t-shirt Steve had discarded on the chair by the window at some point to slip over his head. The idea of putting his dress shirt back on seemed silly for a trip to the bathroom and Tony was sure Steve wouldn’t mind.
“And I thought the army was bad.” Steve laughed, “I’ll never complain about having to drag a rifle through mud and wire again.”
Tony pushed back against him, the tip slipping inside his tight heat with ease. Steve wrapped one hand on Tony’s hip, burying himself inside Tony inch by inch until he was fully inside him. Tony panted as he rose off the desk a little, hands supporting himself as Steve leaned down to place kisses against his skin.
Natasha smirked, “It’s Steve’s. Sam brought it as a Christmas present last year as a joke. He uses it every day.”
He moved out from behind the wall, noting the bodies that once stood in their way as a piled heap on the floor. Steve frowned, glancing back at Tony again, “Let’s go.”
The skies above them were grey and looming, rain would probably hit before the night was out but what Steve wouldn’t give to stand here with Tony for another day, another month, another year. Just to be able to stay with him.
Then his father sighed, relaxing back into his chair, “Fine. You win, I’ll come forward as a witness but you need to back me up and tell them I knew nothing about what Rumlow was planning to do with the weapons and as soon as I found out I did the right thing by coming forward.”
Tony didn’t even blink, “SI?”
He’d call T’Challa after his shower and push him on getting the list of names over to him as soon as possible. There were a lot of unknowns right now and Steve hated not knowing. He couldn’t plan for something he didn’t know about.
Fury nodded, “Hydra would have won.”
Sam was the one to reply, “It’s what you do to protect family, right? If anyone understands that then it’s us.”
Steve was on the left-hand side of the couch, nearest to the door with Thor sitting next to him with a mountain of popcorn in his hand. Sam was on the floor, popcorn bowl on his lap and a pillow behind his back as he watched the movie. Bruce was dozing off on the other side of the couch, head on his hand, glasses askew on the bridge of his nose. Steve found himself smiling softly at the fact Clint had turned down the movie a fraction so the loud explosions on screen didn’t wake him. Clint was in the armchair next to the couch, an old ratty leather thing that managed to support both him and Natasha who was leaning against the arm with a blanket draped over her lap. Steve didn’t understand how she could be comfortable like that, legs curled under her like a gymnast, but he hadn’t seen her move once since they put the film on. Bucky was next to Sam on the floor, trying to be as far away from Nat as possible without making in obvious. Sometimes, Steve really wanted to shake some sense into his friend because surely whatever happened didn’t warrant this. He knew he was pushing it when he had asked them to work together to trail Hydra members, but he had hoped that if they were forced to spend time together it might prompt then to talk to each other about whatever was happening between them.
Steve eyes widen, “How did you manage to build that?”
“Start talking!” Bucky growled out, “Unless you want Thor to give you a little makeover?”
Clint shook his head with a smile, “And then we cut his shirt open and carved our tag into his skin? That’s a dumb move for someone trying to cover up a murder.”
Warning: First part of this chapter contains smut!
“Fury.” He called out, coming to stand next to the man and take up his own stance, eyes fixed on the waves rolling in with the night.
A shot rang out. Not from Steve and he felt the bullet slice through the meat of his side. It was a graze, the bullet nicked him and sailed past to lodge into the wall behind him.
Tony was whimpering, his cock leaking precome between them as Steve thrust in and out of him with pants and moans of his own. He could see Tony’s skin slick with sweat and feel it on his own back as Tony moved a hand to his shoulder and dug his nails into Steve’s skin.
“Reluctant? Couldn’t you say no?”
Tony swallowed, heart pounding in his ears. Was Steve flirting with him? Was he reading the right body language rolling off the mob boss in waves? He took a step forward, closing the gap between them, “In this dream scenario? Maybe I am.”
“Touch yourself for me.” Steve ordered.
Steve squeezed Bucky’s wrist, “Do it. We’ll fix it, Buck. Prosthetics have come a long way.”
“Sitwell.” Steve greeted, pushing off from his bike to stand tall. He’d ridden across town for the meeting alone, despite Natasha’s advice against it, and despite the chill stinging his cheeks it had given him a chance to really appreciate his city. That was something Steve rarely got to do these days; he was too busy protecting it from people like Sitwell.
“Tony.” Steve groaned into his ear, picking up his pace as he slammed his hips forward again. Tony whined in response, curling his hand tighter around Steve’s as Steve repeated the motion.
Tony was running again, his chest heaving and his palm uncomfortably warm as he rounded another corner. He heard heavy footsteps and his hand was up instantly.
Tony nodded, that was good.
Steve sighed, “T’Challa. I asked him for a list of returning vets, see if any of them could be Hydra material.”
Steve shook his head, “No, he wouldn’t. He’s not…”
Even trust Tony when he said the palladium was a stabiliser. It wasn’t, it was a highly corrosive element that Howard added into all the missiles of the Freedom Line. It was a chemical stimulant and produced enough energy within the missile to allow it to cause real damage.
Sitwell visibility swallowed, his own guys flanking him with two men on either side. “We’re here to discuss business, aren’t we?”
As soon as the assistant was reaching for the phone Tony breezed past her, heading straight into Howard’s office without knocking, Bucky close on his heels.
Fury leaned closer, “I think it does. I think it should. Am I right?”
“Tony, we can’t. I can’t.”
He was already walking away before Steve could answer and he was thankful. Steve felt his knees give way and had to grab the railing behind him for support as he felt a tear roll down his cheek.
“We don’t need to.” Tony told him, “We just need to be smart. You guys have cops in the station that work for you right? T’Challa has pull in Congress and you know he’ll help. We have the resources; we just need to think outside the box.”
“It seems like you’re always thanking me for something.”
He winked at Tony playfully before taking a few steps backwards, “I’ll have Natasha show you out. It was nice to meet you, Tony.”
“Steve.” Tony whimpered softly, eyes sliding shut as the back of his head hit Steve’s collarbone.
Rhodey smiled at him then, one that made his eyes lighter and his frame more relaxed, “I’m proud of you, you know. You got away from Howard, you built all this, and you’re making smart decisions.”
He’d help, he owed Steve. T’Challa was an ambitious politician, he had a good education and better ideas but no one would vote for an underdog from the back alleys of Brooklyn. Steve had been fairly new to leading The Avengers back then and he personally endorsed T’challa, openly talking about his merit in bars and in front of his people. They had grown up together, these streets were their playground. These alleys were their arenas. Steve and Bucky went off to fight in Afghanistan and T’challa had gone away for school but somehow, they had all managed to make it back to the streets they once called home.
Steve closed his eyes and allowed himself to drift off with the feeling of Tony curled against him, spent from their orgasms and the thought that called Tony ‘sweetheart’ had sent a thrill through him in an uncomfortably happy way. He had just enough energy to pull the sheet around them both so Tony wouldn’t get cold before he passed out from exhaustion.
“What the fuck is happening?” Steve insisted with wide eyes, attracting the attention of a few nearby uniformed officers.
Tony surged forward, stepping between Steve’s legs as he wrapped his arms around his shoulders. Steve pushed his forehead into Tony’s stomach, the sweat on his brow sticking to Tony’s t-shirt.
“Very perceptive.” Steve meant it as a compliment because it was clear Fury wasn’t the average small-town cop. He was good.
“What is it with you and hating on my music?” Tony quipped as he pulled the other earphone out and tucked them into the pocket of his jeans. He straightened up to his full height, wiping his hands on the rag.
“Thank you all for coming out today,” Tony greeted when the noise around him died down. The camera zoomed in on a close up of his face as he addressed the press and the world, “A lot of you have been wondering about the direction of this company and the next steps we plan to take after my father’s passing.” He had an even voice, respectful and dutiful and rehearsed. Steve found himself curling his fists into the sides of his thighs as he listened.
Tony nodded, sliding the glove off his hand with a grimace, Steve could see the raw pink skin of his palm. That must hurt. They picked a path over the bodies in the doorway and made it out into the cold Brooklyn night air.
Steve struggled to form a sentence as he looked at the face of his best friend.
“Don’t believe everything you hear.” Steve responded, turning to lean his back against the railing and study Fury instead, “What can I do for the police department today?”
The front door opened and slammed shut with enough force to shake the windows in the living room and in seconds Sam and Clint were in the doorway. Sam had Clint’s arm slung around his shoulders, half dragging him through the doorway as his fingers squeezed at Clint’s side. Clint was sweaty and his eyes were unfocused as Sam heaved him over to the couch. Thor immediately got out the way as Bruce hoovered over the head of the arm, assessing the damage with his eyes. Sam’s face with dotted with blood splatter and Clint let out a groan.
“You…” Steve trailed off.
Tony’s hands were moving then, clearly wanting to give as good as he got, and Steve had to admit he was thankful for the car behind him when he felt Tony’s palm press over his crotch. Steve rocked up into his hand shamelessly, partly to show Tony just how much he wanted him and partly because with every second his cock was getting harder and the friction of Tony’s hand was deliciously teasingly as he rubbed over Steve’s own jeans.
Tony really hated being kidnapped.
Tony’s fingers went to Steve’s thighs on either side of his body, letting himself slip down further to get comfortable, “Well, a job I thought would be done in an hour might actually take me two days and we closed early today so I could drive Peter and Ned to the vet. Apparently, Ned is actually a girl and she is expecting kittens.”
Tony chuckled, “Does that line normally work?”
Natasha shrugged into him, "You need it. Hug me back, Rogers."
When they eventually made it back to Steve’s, hours later than he had originally planned, the mob boss couldn’t help but feel nervous. Tony was right by his side as they walked up the front steps of the house together, everyone else already inside and waiting for them.
“If we’re going to lose then at least we’ll do it together.”
“We drove you out to the desert.” Rumlow whispered, “Threw you from the moving Jeep in the middle of nowhere. I knew by the time you came around the tracks would have disappeared in the shifting sand. I wanted you to die out there. That was me, Steve, I’ve already killed you once.”
“T’Challa’s family had money, he stole some so I could take her to a doctor, but it was too late. She was too sick.” Steve took a moment to collect himself before continuing, “I just remember thinking how unfair it was, for her to suffer because we were poor. It didn’t make us any less because we couldn’t afford medical bills or heating. It shouldn’t have cost her life. So I had one thought, make the world better. For her. So, I joined the army. Thought being a soldier would make her proud, it would allow me to help people.”
He caught her in his arms and nuzzled her Golden curls. Angie looked at him questioningly.
Steve eyed him exasperatedly; it’s time to get back down to business.
He saw that he was starting to create a scene, nurses were coming to see what the commotion was, but he didn't care. Something unnatural was happening and he needed to figure it out.
"That is indeed correct. I have been with you this entire time. I must admit I have taken great joy in learning your mind and reading your thoughts. I enjoy your mind more than I care to admit, however."
“I threw up everywhere and was sick for days after that.” He laughed and Tony smiled.
He knew the science behind nutrition, knew his brain would perform at more optimal levels if he only would eat more. He knew this, truly. However, he had extreme difficulty keeping anything down. His stress and anxiety absolutely would not let him consume the nutrition he needs in order to, ironically, alleviate the stress and anxiety. Even if his mind and heart were finnaly in the right place his body refused to catch up to him.
So this chapter was the tail end of twelve. But I cut it off to make twelve shorter. It stands alone nicely be itself though. Without any further ado, here’s thirteen.
“Come on, Jar. ETA on system reentry?” Tony demanded as he began pushing buttons on the panel again.
Steve pulled his phone out of the jacket pocket currently around Tony and offered it to him, “You can’t tell them about me or Hydra.”
Bucky was still processing, “You told me it was a one-time thing.”
Tony went willingly, pressing his palms against the wood of Steve’s desk until his stomach was pressing against the edge and he was wiggling his ass impatiently. Steve smiled at the sight, running his fingers down from the top of Tony’s spine all the way to the curve of his ass. Tony twitched in eagerness as Steve slipped a finger between Tony’s ass cheeks before pulling away.
“It’s going to be okay, Buck.” Steve told him; an echo of the reassurance Steve used to give him whilst they were deployed. Bucky didn’t respond but didn’t pull away either and Steve wondered whether he was talking about Tony, Natasha or the mess with Hydra.
“Mine.” Steve’s eyes flashed to Bucky.
Everyone was waiting in the living room, anxious faces all staring at Steve patiently. Tony felt almost shy standing there in Steve’s t-shirt and his boxers, despite the fact everyone else was still in their pyjamas and Steve himself was without a shirt in his haste to find out what was going on. He tugged at the hem of Steve’s shirt, hoping to pull it further down his legs before he stopped himself. It wasn’t like they didn’t know they were together. Everyone knew what they were doing in Steve’s room last night.
“Fuck off.” Bucky narrowed his eyes, “He’s my responsibility, okay? Ever since we were kids and his mom died it’s been my job to look out for him. I was the only one who could. The streets, the army, the gang. Anything that’s a risk to him is a problem for me.”
“Okay, I just need the element of surprise. If I can get the jump on him then knock him out, we can deliver him to Fury and with Howard’s testimony the law can do its thing.” Steve explained.
His whole body clenched around Steve’s hand, shaking with the effort of his orgasm raging through him. Steve kept his eyes on Tony’s, feeling the cum hit his own stomach from Tony’s cock as he came.
Steve frowned, “What?”
Steve wanted to punch him, “It’s just a name, Rumlow. It doesn’t mean anything.”
Steve nodded. “Ross’ body being discovered with something related to Hydra will prove he was working with them. We just need to shape our own narrative. You get your new unit; we get our freedom. We make sure nothing like this ever happens again. You said so yourself Fury, with Ross being Hydra the case isn’t credible anymore. This is the only way we all walk away from this now. Together. If anyone finds the body, you’ll both be charged along with us. We’re stuck together whether you two like it or not. Your survival and ours depends on us pulling this off.”
“He was a bad guy, Tony. He was Hydra.” Steve sighed, “You did what you had to do to survive.” And it was the truth. Ross wasn’t going to stop and Tony’s instincts were right to stop him but Steve never wanted it to be him that had to make that sacrifice to protect them. It wasn’t meant to be a burden on Tony’s shoulders.
“Okay but take this.” Natasha replied, drawing a knife out of her pocket and shoving it into Tony’s direction.
It was a bold move to carve their tag into his chest. It was both disturbing and cruel and it would be just the thing to rally the cops together to launch a manhunt. So far, the police mostly left the gang stuff alone. They all knew there was no hope for a conviction and no one wanted to be on a gang hit list but if someone was killing their own officers then that unspoken rule was null and void. They’d chuck everything they had at Steve and his family if they thought they had enough evidence.
“Seems to me like people are already talking, sweetheart.” Steve replied, “Might as well give them something to talk about. Besides, I’m not a mob boss anymore.”
Nat feigned ignorance, "I have no idea. Talk a walk, clear your head? I'm sure you'll think of something."
“That’s his story to tell.” Bruce replied, “All I know, if it wasn’t for Cap’s monthly donations to the clinic it would have been shut down by now. Money for lights, heating, the space, the medical supplies. It’s not cheap. Most of the workers are volunteers but the equipment costs money. He saved that place and for that I’ll always be grateful”
sell him out. I’m loyal to Steve Rogers. I’m loyal to The Avengers. You want to arrest me; you go right ahead. You won’t get anything out of me that you can use against him, I promise you that.”
Howard’s office was on the top floor, the arrogance of a man thinking he was top of the world. Tony made his way up there, Bucky trailing behind. He’d gone silent again, hands in his pockets and while he wasn’t as big as Steve, he did cut an impressively imposing figure against all the suited Stark Industries workers as they passed. There were whispers as Tony led the way, many people couldn’t believe the son of Howard Stark was back. He looked taller and older and nothing like Howard in his ratty jeans and jacket. Tony was sure he even heard a camera go off as they headed up to Howard’s office, but he held his head high and his back ram-rod straight. Just like being seventeen again and being attacked by vultures.
Steve wasn’t finished, “You doubt that? You really don’t see yourself the way I do.”
The smile from the other end was practically screaming at him, “Captain, I told you I’d tear down your empire, didn’t I? I hope you don’t mind it being brick by brick.”
Steve rubbed his wrists gently, “What about Ross?”
“I let them believe it, I let them spread those rumours as much as they liked because it helped them to fear me. Phillips always used to say fear is how you gain power, but it doesn’t keep you there. That’s when I knew if I wanted to stay on top I had to rebuild The Avengers into something that was completely my own. A system I created that wasn’t based on fear but on loyalty. That was something Phillips never understood.” Steve replied, freeing his hand from the other wrap and dropping the fabric into his lap.
“I think so.” Steve sighed, “There could be a gang war on the streets of Brooklyn before Christmas.”
“Oh Punk.” He replied, “You know why it’s a bad idea. You’re a mob boss. You’re the King of Brooklyn. Everyone in town knows your name and half of them want to see you dead in a ditch and take your throne for themselves. We have Hydra coming at us, the cops coming at us. We need you focused, not distracted by a mechanic who doesn’t belong in our world.”
“I’m all in.” Tony replied in the space between them, “I want all of you, Steve. Not just the nice bits. I want the messy ones as well. It’s all mine, okay? That’s what I choose. You want me to say it? Fine, I want all of it. I want to know everything, the good, the bad, the bloody. I want to be the one you come to when you’re stuck in your own head. I want to be the one you lean on for support instead of carrying it all on your shoulders. I want you.”
Steve couldn’t help but grin at the look of fear in Sitwell’s face at the dried blood stuck to the rusted surface of the weapon. Thor was very good at what he did, it was one of the reasons Steve recruited him. The presence of the weapon itself invoked fear. Everyone had heard the stories of The God of Thunder and no one wanted to find out if they were true.
That was why Rumlow’s tactics wouldn’t work on him.
“It’s what friends do, right?” Steve replied, “I’ll get you the votes.”
“Of course not. Sam’s babysitting.” Natasha replied with a smile, “I can kick him out and tell him to come back tomorrow?”
“I need a few more things.”
“Well, you practically gave me the tour once.” Steve replied.
“You killed our fucking baby, Nat.” The words were out of Bucky’s mouth before Steve could move. His heart was hammering in his chest.
“You want to play it that way? Fine, hand yourself over to me or the next name I release will be Natasha’s or Sam’s or Clint’s. The cops might not be able to get you, but they can arrest everyone else. Clint’s got a reputation for police custody, hasn’t he? Natasha has an impressive rap sheet too.” Rumlow replied.
“Just go in, okay? Sitting out here worrying about it isn’t going to make it any easier.”
“It makes sense. Both bodies were moved after death. They both had scrap marks on their backs like they were dragged. Probably to stage a crime scene.” Adam continued.
Steve was fully hard now, pressing against Tony insistently. Tony ground down against him, Steve’s body jerked to attention. He moved a hand up to Tony’s head, bringing his lips down for a deep kiss.
Fury nodded, rubbing his chin, “But what if you weren’t?”
“This isn’t an interview, it’s a conversation, Mr Stark.” Ross replied, hands gripping the desk, “And I’m just trying to figure it out.”
“He sold you and Bucky out to Rumlow for the money.” Steve told him, “I couldn’t stop him in time.”
Luckily, Tony had grown up in these situations and was a dab hand at getting kidnapped. He could do this without Steve needing to get involved. Stark men were made of iron and Tony had always been a survivor. This prick didn’t frighten him in the slightest.
Tony sighed, “Tell me why you’re here.”
He finished kicking off his jeans and boxers with a smile, “I like it. It makes you look younger.”
What the hell had happened here?
He was seething, and Bucky’s own rage curled about his shoulders almost making him double in size. He was pacing madly, dodging the abandoned dirty clothes on the floor and the empty glasses that hadn’t found their way to the kitchen yet. Steve took a moment to take in the state of the room. Bucky was never the cleanest person, even in the army his bunk looked like a storm had hit it, but this was something else. The unmade bed where the pillows had been thrown to the floor, the dirty glasses and mugs on every surface. How was Bucky not drowning in this stuff? Steve stepped further into the room, closing the door behind him. He felt a rumple of paper under his boot and looked down to see an old photograph of Bucky and Natasha, taken at Falcon’s on New Year’s Eve last year. Once it was stuck up next to the desk Bucky kept in the corner of the room, now it lay abandoned in the chaos of his room like it was simply another thing he was choosing to ignore.
“Captain.” Sitwell greeted, buttoning up his coat. Steve could see his eyes slip over to the hammer in Thor’s hand.
Steve’s mind was reeling, “With this job, we’d all stay here in Brooklyn?”
The morgue was on the lowest level and that’s where they were headed so Steve was more than a little confused when Fury stopped him with a hand and pulled a cap and sunglasses out of his coat to pass them to Steve.
“You punched my best friend?”
Tony wanted to run to him, but Natasha held him back. They walked together, making their footsteps slower and louder so Steve didn’t spook at their arrival. They had managed to disable the bombs easily. Natasha shot three Hydra members that came their way as Tony worked, cutting the various wires with a clinical detachment.
He was probably crazy.
Tony wiggled, “Fuck, Steve, yes.”
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling him all the way in until their foreheads were pressed together, “Consider it done. I love you. I do. But is this really want you want? This life?”
Steve shrugged, draining his glass, “Isn’t that what people do? Talk about their days?”
Tony kept his mouth shut because of course it wasn’t okay. Tony knew it wasn’t okay, he had spent so many nights drinking to stop his back from stinging as it scabbed over. He had spent weeks going to Rhodey’s place to get him to clean them so they wouldn’t get infected. None of that was okay.
“Thank you for doing this.” T’Challa told him, “It means a lot.”
“Bucky is watching his back?” Steve repeated, not quite believing the words. How long had he been in that cell for?
Tony shook his head, “He didn’t. I might need you to do some scary boyfriend visits to get me out of a few forced dinners though.”
Steve frowned, “What does that have to do with me?”
There was something about the way the sunrise hit Steve’s room, the soft glow from the windows that turned everything a magical shade of orange and seemed to make the room warmer despite the winter weather outside. Tony took a moment, eyes gazing out the window. In his head he wondered whether it was the mob boss in Steve or the artist in him that had chosen this room. The view was beautiful, the skyline of Brooklyn in full view and Tony could almost imagine him sketching it in the early hours of the morning when he couldn’t sleep and needed to keep his hands busy.
“I’m counting on it.” Steve replied, pulling his gun out from the waistband of his jeans and clicking the safety off.
Steve was trying not to show how shocked he was as the Mechanic continued his work on the bike, “It doesn’t bother you that you’re working for me?”
Fury had a tight grip on his arm, roughly tugging him to show his victory to his team, “I hope you know what you’re doing.” He said lowly for only Steve to hear and then the moment was over, Steve was passed into another pair of hands and all but shoved into the back of a police van with several officers piling in after him.
Steve did as Fury suggested, keeping to the side streets and alleyways, looping back around the building to find Natasha’s getaway car waiting for him. Steve could see her smiling at him in the rear-view mirror, wide and joyful at seeing him. He couldn’t help but return it as he slipped into the passenger seat of the beat-up Volvo she’d chosen to use as their vehicle. Sam and Thor were in the back seat with equal grins.
That thought scared him more than he felt comfortable with.
A happy kid.
Tony watched Ross carefully, noticing every little detail. The beads of sweat that collected on his temple, making it shiny in the dim light. The way his skin pulled too taunt over his knuckles, making them white and strained. Ross was holding back a whole flood of emotions and Tony knew he was in the firing line.
Tony knew that was a lie. Once Rumlow had seen what he could do, he’d want to keep him around. Tony was a valuable asset, Rumlow wouldn’t be able to give that up.
He was a quiet man but sharp as a tac with a wit to match. Clint would never stop marvelling at how serious and grave their Captain could be one minute and how witty he could be the next. He always felt a pang of sadness at the thought that no one outside their little group would ever see that side of Steve. The side that wasn’t all hard lines and deadly edges but the side that loved them all with a fierceness Clint could barely fathom. The press and the cops always painted Steve out to be dangerous and they weren’t wrong but that wasn’t the whole picture either.
“Tony!” He called out into the dark of the apartment, hitting the light switch as he went.
Tony wouldn’t be building him a missile though. Tony would be building his means of freedom. The arc reactor technology, something Howard had dismissed as being a waste of time was a problem that Tony had solved one night with a piece of chalk and a pavement outside MIT with Rhodey after they had come back from a party drunk. Rhodey was rambling about applying for the police force and Tony had managed to come up with a way to direct the raw energy created through the palladium into a sort of funnel that allowed him to power the arc reactor technology and focus it down on a smaller scale.
“That wasn’t a request.” Fury called out to him, “You’re done, Rogers.” He was enjoying this.
The door opened and he couldn’t help but feel disappointed when the man staring back at him wasn’t Steve. Instead he was older, a salt and pepper quality to his hair and glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. This is what gang members looked like now? Tony was thinking of the stereotypical dark colouring and guns. A tattoo maybe? A gang sign? Something?
“Same as before. Wound was inflicted before death, he struggled for sure. The cause was the bullet to the head, expertly done. You still thinking gang crime for this one?” Adam asked.
Steve knew he was right, but it still didn’t sit well with him. Once Tony was completely naked, he moved over to Steve, hands on his belt.
“You’re, God Tony, you’re everything.” Steve smiled, feeling a tear in the corner of his eye, “You’re the smartest man in the room always, you’re funny and kind and caring. You’re the only person who could match me on my best day. You’re the person I want to wake up to every morning and go to bed with every night. You’re the man I want to be better for. The man I want to cherish and protect and be claimed by.”
“No, wait. I need to go to work.” Tony sighed, “I’ve left Peter there for two days now. I need to show my face. I’ll meet you after my shift, okay? Start planning without me and I’ll catch up when I get there.”
The first word out of the guy’s mouth wasn’t an exclamation of pain though, it was grovelling, and Steve hated grovelling, “Please, I don’t know anything alright? Your guys jumped me, but I don’t know anything I swear. Jesus, I swear on my life.”
Thor swung his hammer joyfully, “It is true. Nothing like the splatter of blood and the saltiness of sea air.”
The Hydra goon made another mistake as he pulled the trigger, he squeezed his eyes shut as he braced for the recoil. Steve watched him close his eyes a fraction of a second before he squeezed the trigger and that was all it took. The bullet tore from the gun and Steve was already on the move. The bullet sailed past his shoulder and hit his bike again, Steve could hear metal strike metal in a distant ping behind him as he charged at his opponent. He ducked under the kid’s arm, coming up behind him as he opened his eyes to see the damage he had caused.
Steve didn't know where to start, words swirling in his mind like water going down the drain. He was tense, shoulders ramrod straight and hair in disarray from the walk back to the house, and everyone else in the room could feel it.
Bucky sighed, turning in his seat a little more so his knees were angled towards Tony, “I don’t. I just… I wasn’t sure you were right for Steve. I thought you were messing with his head; we didn’t know anything about you and suddenly Steve is seeing you regularly and staying over. He never does that you know; he doesn’t stay the night. Never goes to the same person twice. It’s too risky for him in this line of work.”
“You too.” Steve replied before hanging up.
Bucky nodded, “You too.”
Tony looked like he was wrestling with something, his eyes flicking to Steve’s face and back down again every few moments. Steve said nothing, waiting for Tony to be ready.
Bucky and Nat had been a thing once, in the early days when Steve’s empire had been no more than a few blocks of territory in Brooklyn and he had a handful of people on his payroll. Now, his reach extended throughout most of the city. His city. The police mockingly called him ‘The King of Brooklyn’. Everyone else just called him ‘The Captain’. Nat and Bucky had split up over something, Steve never asked what because he knew it was none of his business but he knew Natasha was hurt and Bucky was angry and now they seemed to be actively avoiding each other despite living in the same house.
“He really doesn’t.”
Street, we’ll pay you of course.”
Steve ignored both of them, crossing his arms over his chest to change his stance. Gone was Steve Rogers. The Captain had business, “Was anyone hurt?”
“I don’t need to be saved.” Tony whispered between them.
“He needs you.” It was still weird to hear omissions like that from Bucky’s mouth after all this time.
“Autopsy shows the mark was carved into him whilst he was still alive.” Fury bit out and Clint could see the glint in his eye. Cops protect their own. Just like Steve did.
“Of course. High levels of potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur. Nothing out of the ordinary. They store charcoal at the docks anyway and the others are found in composted soil to help plant vegetation.” Adam replied, eyes on Coulson’s body.
“Such a waste.” Rumlow commented, “But me and you, we’re men of our words. That’s how we conduct business, right Captain?”
Steve shrugged, “I’m not just thanking you for this.”
“This is Rumlow.” Steve told them, “Pierce was at the party last night. I dealt with him, took his phone and when he got a call it was Rumlow on the other end.”
Steve doesn’t even look at her while he scrubs, “You’ve had a tough day.”
The cars, two of them which seemed a bit full on to Steve but apparently the police were making a statement of their own, pulled up in front of him in a screeching holt. They blocked off Steve’s path, Steve stalled on the street and watched as cops piled out of the vehicles, guns drawn and raised at him as they formed some sort of line. Had they rehearsed this?
He leaned down, lips on Tony’s shoulder blade has he licked over the scars from Howard’s treatment and moved up towards his neck. Steve pulled Tony backwards, pressing their bodies flushed together so Tony could throw is head back against Steve’s shoulder and Steve had a clear path to Tony’s neck. He sucked at the salty skin there, teeth grazing as he felt Tony shudder against him.
Later.
By the time Steve made it back home his anger had been festering like a furnace, he could feel it in his bones. They took Tony. Hydra dared to use him as a chess piece in this game of war between them. Steve felt like his veins were burning, clenching and unclenching his jaw every time he thought about Tony in pain, being hurt, because of him.
“Okay Tones. He’s in there. Hands are cuffed so he won’t try anything,” Rhodey told him as they came to a stop outside the door, “Two minutes. You say what you need to say, and you get out. I’ll come get you if you don’t.” It was almost amusing that Rhodey thought Steve might try and hurt Tony, when in reality Tony knew he’d be completely safe. Steve wouldn’t ever attack him, it was a fact, just like he knew Steve drew when he couldn’t sleep, and he always dropped a kiss onto Tony’s skin somewhere after he came. Tony knew in his bones he’d be safe.
“Fuck.” Steve cursed as Tony moved his hips against him in reckless abandonment and Steve tried to keep up with him.
Steve waited for the working shift to end before he put Tony’s plan into action. There would be less cops around after six, working a skeleton shift never afforded as many people and he would be Steve’s best chance at getting out without anyone seeing him. He couldn’t risk it; he couldn’t start killing cops for his own freedom. It wasn’t what he did, that was Rumlow’s style.
Tony’s eyes were dark with arousal and Steve managed to smirk at him with his mouth full of his cock, slowly drawing back up to flick the top with his tongue again. Tony’s head rolled back against the pillows with a flop, and Steve knew he’d closed his eyes. His hips stuttered against him, so Steve moved his hands to hold down Tony’s hips. He wasn’t done teasing him yet.
Steve sighed, leaning forward so his elbows were on the table, “Do you have a family? People you care about? People you want to protect?” Ross’ silence was deafening and gave Steve all the answer he needed, “Then I don’t expect you to understand why I’m doing any of this.”
“Really?”
If he was doing this, Steve knew he had to be all in. Making his decision, he quickly stopped walking and tugged Tony against him. He couldn’t help but smile at the shocked expression the man had.
Even though he knew it was coming, Steve let out a gasp as the iceberg came on screen, muttering ‘turn’ to himself. He gripped tighter to Tony’s hand, quiet as the passengers -- especially the third-class ones -- noticed the danger.
Steve shivered, mind bringing back the sharp cold of the Atlantic he had felt himself. While he didn’t necessarily have to be in it as long as Rose and Jack did -- the shock of hitting the ocean knocked him unconscious so he didn’t feel much of anything that he could remember. But his body couldn’t stand cold showers anymore, nor did he appreciate it when someone managed to spill their ice water on him.
“Like a date.”
really was served at the last meal on the Titanic.
for you.
“Right... No, you’re right, it does.” Tony tilted his head. “Fancy or fun?”
And so the film went on, peppered with tidbits of information with each new scene. Facts about the actors or meanings behind certain shots. That the length of the scenes in the past equaled the same amount of time it took for the ship to sink. It was the director who did the naked picture. The pomeranian represented the three surviving dogs... It warmed Steve to know just how much information Tony had to share.
you to fuck me,” Tony said after breaking their kiss again. “Please, Steve...
Thank you again to my awesome beta! Art will be coming soon as well. :)
“I’ll make a note to visit sometime.”
From the Captain’s somber departure to die in solitude with his ship to Rose and Jack flailing in the cold ocean, Steve’s heart ached. Tragedy was never fair, and especially so for the people aboard the doomed ship. He wished he had been able to help them, though he knew it would have been impossible. His saving-people complex, as Iron Man called it.
“I want to.” Steve tugged on Tony’s loose strap. “Now shut up and make me feel better.”
Steve looked down at his odd mix of clothes. Dark cargo pants (why were there
Sex and nothing more. Steve had convinced himself to do this once without something more, but he wasn’t sure if he could do it again. He bit his lip, looking around the room while he gathered his thoughts. If he continued to see Tony, he was sure his feelings would get in the way of anything casual that they could have. No, he was definitely not a casual type of person.
Tony grinned again and walked backwards down the hall, never letting go of Steve’s hand. “Wait until we get to the bedroom.”
“My pleasure,” Tony said with a laugh before kissing him.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand and refused to answer. They settled into silence as the passengers gathered, lifejackets looking ridiculous under their first-class clothes. Steve bit his lip, feeling almost anxious at the number of people he knew he would watch perish. Somehow, the story of Titanic was worse when told as such -- all he wanted was for Jack and Rose to survive despite how much he knew Jack wouldn’t make it.
“San Junipero always provides,” he murmured as he leaned back, tube of lubricant in his hand. “Any point you want to take over, just say so.”
“I can see that. What’s the other movie?”
“Let’s do both,” he finally decided, raising Tony’s hand so he could kiss his knuckles. “I guess that’s something to do at your place?”
whoops.
“I’m going to go to the highest building in New York and scream that,” Tony had said earlier as Jack stood at the rails of the ship, shouting about being king of the world. Steve laughed, picturing him doing so easily.
“Shh.” He motioned with his free hand at the screen. “I’m watching the perilous journey our heroes are taking.”
“We could do it at my place,” Tony agreed with a grin. “But no sex until after.”
Tony broke the kiss to tilt his head back, gasping as their cocks pressed against another. “Steve... God,
The man in question stared at Steve for a moment before grinning. “Well if it isn’t the dashing dick...”
Steve tightened his hand on Tony’s. “You have a place here? I thought you were a tourist.”
His cock, still trapped by his plain underwear, was hard as it pressed against Tony’s own underwear-clad erection. He heard himself moan as Tony’s hips shifted, almost rutting against him. Steve slid his hand down Tony’s side to his thigh, pulling at it so Tony’s leg lifted and Steve could thrust against him. Though he hadn’t had much practice, Steve felt as if he knew exactly what to do to please Tony. He moved his other hand to Tony’s other legs and, without much communication on what he wanted, Tony broke the kiss so he could help lift himself up and wrap both legs around Steve’s waist. Steve pressed Tony further against the wall, using it to help (though he really didn’t need it).
(See the end of the chapter for
It was easy to see how much love went into the film, too.
So for now, he let Tony lead him to a nondescript building. He followed him into an elevator that moved without pressing a button. And when the doors opened to a hallway with a single door, Steve didn’t hesitate to let Tony bring him inside the apartment.
“Most assuredly this is not the work of a mutant.” He stopped yet again to ensure that his words sunk in completely.
Steve eyed him skeptically. "You made reservations already, didn't you?" He said matter-of-factly.
Really, Johnny was one of the last people he thought would come in here to seek him out like this.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why don’t you enlighten us been.” Fury ordered.
“If you’re going, I’m going.” Said Natasha.
“What did Clint say?”
“And what!?” Bucky demanded apprehensively.
Then the answer came to him.
Steve did not know why but the thought of it made him incredibly distressed. That sinking, awful, helpless feeling he had all those days ago threatened to rise to the surface. He forcefully pushed them down. Howard can never know about this.
“Really!? Can I see?” Peter replied excitedly.
I would never again see her smile or hear her laughter when the rain came.
Bruce was shaking violently while Natasha tearfully was trying to keep Bruce calm. Xavier and Thor were both stone silent and Fury promptly fainted.
“I knew without a shadow of a doubt that if you knew you’d come for me and not let a damn thing stop you. I don’t blame you at all, Steve. When I knew nothing else, I knew that.”
Images of a vast cityscape with an ethereal glow from a sunset swam across his vision. A man very similar in his own appearance uttered those very words. They echoed around his brain unrelentingly.
“I’m not going to lie, it’s hard every day. I think of all of them. Before I knew it I lost all of them at once.” Steve whispered miserably.
Really?!
“I’m afraid not, love.” She answered unaware of Steve’s inner turmoil.
"Not entirely. The truth is I did not yet know which of you would be the one who would give me a yes. The more I observed you two, however, the more I came to realize that though both of you would be excruciatingly difficult, the most difficult of all my keystones in the past combined, might I add, you, Steven, by far, would have been the easiest.
“Nat show them.”  The Director said.
