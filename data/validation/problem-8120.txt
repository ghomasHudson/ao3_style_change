Like every other gala Steven went to, this gala was filled with ass-kissers, people who wished to make investments with you, people who were trying to get you on their side, people who were power-hunger hoping to climb the steps to fame, and other people who liked to fling their wealth. The thing that they all had in common, was, wanting to meet the new Captain America who came from another universe. Something that made Steven roll his eyes, especially when people went on and on about how it was so strange that he didn't have a dynamic to ground him and how freeing it must be!
When the coffee machine ding signaling to the blond that it did its job, the Omega carefully took the mug from the machine, putting it on a tray with the compresses, walking quietly to the living room, not wanting to make too much sound and disturbing whatever rest James was able to get after what took a place not half an hour ago.
Tony heard the front door open and close, followed by a sigh and a grumble about idiot Alphas. Tony's lips twitch up at that and he stood up and stretches his body wincing at the cracks he heard from his back, yeah… that was a bad idea. Anyway, time to say 'Hi' to the hopefully Godmother of the baby. "Pep!" Tony called out making the apartment get quiet and footsteps were heard rushing toward the living room.
By the time they reached the tower, both Steve and Peter were dozing off; the exhaustion was clear on both of their faces. "Steve…" Tony's voice cracked as he tried to wake the star, wondering if he should call Thor and Bucky to carry Steve to one of the rooms in the tower; Steve was probably back to sleep and won’t wake up until the sunset, which they have seven hours before it does.
"Well, first of all, congratulations are in order." The doctor said with a soft smile on her face, as she looked through the chart in her hand; her words causing both Steve and Tony to look at each other before turning their attention back to the doctor. "You are pregnant Mr. Rogers." The doctor said causing Tony to let out a
The sound of the door slamming shut made Tony give a wet gasp in relief, moving shakily and opened his good eye, looking around the place like a wild animal as he tried to calm himself down while curling on himself protecting his tummy, waiting…
“Thank you! I own you one, you don’t know how much it meant to me, God, and it has been years since last time I saw them.” Tony said only to start sniffling, struggling to stop from crying, which caused him to groan. “Dammit, hormones!” Tony whimpered as he let go, struggling to wipe the tears that attempt to fall, Natasha offering him a sympathetic smile…
"What a joyful sight… hopefully it will still be after Tyber and his sister arrive. Petrus is usually quiet when the two of them show up." Magna said, her smile wide as her gaze followed Petrus and his friends (And that's what the queen's babe was, the friend that Petrus never had) only for her smile to deem a little at the mention of Tyber. Gods above, what would Anton do to get rid of this dilemma he was forced into for years now? Ever since that day Tyber lied about stealing the information Anton's people needed from the Hydra king, the villagers tried to match Anton with him or with his sister, hoping that the Stone clan fortune will rub onto them… if only those foolish people knew the heartbreaking truth.
The A.I.'s words snapped Tony out of his line of thoughts, only to turn his blood into ice in his veins as he made sense of what his A.I. told him. Tony stood as fast as he can ignoring the chair that went crashing to the floor as he raced to the stairs, running as fast as he can to reach his baby's room, his heart in his throat as he slammed the door to Morgan's room open causing it to slam into the wall. The noise was so loud that it woke his daughter who started crying like a siren, shrieking and crying louder and louder the longer Tony ignored her.
The Thing: Norse society was governed by quite strict laws which were discussed and decided upon at a meeting called a Thing. Usually held at a specially chosen field or open space, the community would assemble at the Thing to settle disputes and disagreements and enforce these laws that had been handed down from generation to generation. The trials of people who were thought to have broken the law were also held at the Thing. If a person was found guilty the relevant punishment would be handed out by the law-speaker.
Tony swallowed as his eyes darted around the place, taking in the upturned living room; furniture were thrown around the place, sofas and chairs thrown upside down as if a fight had taken place in the room. But what caused Tony to freeze in his place was the red that was sprayed everywhere, the red that was dripping from the walls and painting the floor red… this was… this was where Steve was beaten up. "Oh… God…" Tony's voice cracked as he started shaking, wondering if what he saw was an insane trick from his imagination, but the blood that was everywhere informed Tony that what happened was true.
"Peter Rogers, it's nice to meet you, sir." The boy said not realizing the storm he created in Tony's mind, the Alpha looked at the boy shakily when he said that name trying to smile and failing, it wasn't like the kid had said something wrong, it's just that, him and Steve had chosen that name a long time ago when they were deciding on their future children's names, and hearing that name being uttered followed by the name Rogers was just too much.
It was the first time that someone asked him that question, about what he thinks of Steve… well, sure the Alpha was friendly, and Tony will even go to a length and say that the two of them were friends, he never thought of Steve like how he thinks of his parents and Aunt Peggy. As for the mates' thing, he can say that Steve was an attractive man, after all, it was true the man was like an Adonis with his looks, and Tony wouldn't lie and say he didn't feel attracted and had a crush on the man, but does he really want to have a relationship with the man? "I… I don't really know… I mean he is attractive and all that, I… I just never thought of him like that before. He is a good father to Peter, never complains, and loves my son like it was his… it's just confusion, what if one day he will turn out to be like Obadiah? He is an Alpha; Alphas always thought that Omegas are beneath them… and I… I…" Tony couldn't finish his words, looking at his hands with a flush face, eyes becoming glassy and he hated himself that he nearly start crying just by the thought that Steve could be like Stane.
"She was… she was my mate… Peggy Carter…" Tony returned his gaze to the picture taking in the woman's features, how she was looking so bored as if she had many different things she should do instead of staying here in this place, something that made Tony frown but he swallowed and asked the next question that burned through him ever since he knew Steve was married.
The next day you will find Tony looked at himself in the mirror for the sixth time; he didn't want to admit it, but Tony was so nervous about finally meeting Harley for the first time. Steve and Peter on the other hand were supportive of him and tried to cheer him up (Well, Steve did), telling him what Harley likes and what he doesn't, and that he likes science and robots, and how Harley is easy to scare, and how he has asthma that acted up every time he was startled (The last two things didn't really help him at all gathering enough courage to meet the little boy; Steve ended up pulling Peter's ear when the boy went to tell Tony about how easily startled Harley is when an Omega makes fast moves).
"You are not the first king I plot his death!" Snarled the Omega as he hissed at the man, causing him to pause and look at the growling Omega, who looked like a chained beast waiting for someone to slip before taking the chance and slaughter them all. "If you have not come four days ago it would have been me who killed the Hydra king, so do not take pleasure in a stolen victory, I thought you were better than that." The Omega mocked which made the Alpha growl and stalk toward the Omega, getting enraged when the Omega neither backed away nor flinched when he approached.
Tony hummed as he walked toward the front door, already making a sarcastic remark if it was really Rhodey on the other side; opening the door, the breath rushed out of Tony when his eyes stilled on the person on the other side, his eyes widening, it has been nearly three years since the last time he saw his father, three years without making any contact with the man until now, and seeing the man, after all, that time made Tony's emotions fly all around the place.
Whatever Tony wanted to say next he was stopped by the sound of music starting, informing the party goers of another dance about to start. Turning around, Tony spotted a woman standing on the stage singing as her male companion played the piano; the woman's voice was raspy and low, crooning about love… Tony was one hundred percent sure that Pepper and Peggy had a hand in this.
"But… but you said it yourself. Tha… the purple grape villain will stop at nothing to have Mr. Steve as his bride!" Peter huffed at those words, and Tony, Tony had to stop himself from laughing until his sides hurt; 'The Purple Grape Villain'? The Avengers will have the delight of their lives when they are going to hear that name.
Anton can see how unbalanced Tyber and his sister were by his answer, and a dark part of him enjoyed their pain; good, they should know they are not welcomed here, something that Anton had tried to make known for years. "My king, we brought some gifts from the south that we hope will catch your fancy." Sunset (Gods above who name their child Sunset? It was a nightmare hearing that name) said in what she probably hoped was a demure smile, which made her look like someone who was planning to stab you in the back instead.
Lastly but not least Tony… Tony and Steve's relationship did get better in the end, after so many heartaches and pain. After the final battle, when Captain Marvel decided to sacrifice herself instead of Tony and snap the Gauntlet, it seems that Tony and Pepper's relationship was once again strained, Tony tried to make it work, if not for him than for his daughter Morgan, but everything fell like sandcastle when Morgan came home one day talking about one of her classes that day, talking about genetics and DNA, and how she wanted to do the DNA tests her teacher talked about. Tony laugh it off at that time and decided to indulge his daughter, only to discover the harsh truth later, when the results came, and the person standing in front of him was not related to him at all, that lead to a shouting match between Tony and Pepper, it ends with them splitting up. That day, Steve found a wet and shivering Tony on his doorsteps. That was the point their relationship turned one-eighty. Despite himself, Tony tried to be part of Morgan's life, he loved the little girl too much to cut her off of his life for the mistakes of her mother, unfortunately, Morgan did not feel the same, she blamed her father for leaving her and her mother, which put the two of them in a strained relationship.
"What did you see that you needed to make him go through that torture? Why can't you just let Steven and him be?" Loki asked with wonder which made the woman hum a little before giving a sad smile toward her son, which told the prince that it was only bad things.
"Now, Pep, don't be cruel, I'm sure that Rhodey's software still hasn't been downloaded yet." Tony grinned, enjoying how grumpy Rhodey became; it ended with Tony letting out a war cry when Rhodey stole a pancake from his plate, this was not acceptable at all! Thankfully it was Pepper to the rescue as she stole Rhodey's coffee and kicked his shin, which made Tony coo and calls her his hero.
Nebula's mission this time was easy, it was far easier than she had thought; find the witch who cast an ancient spell on the Space stone the day of the invasion. A mission that was far easier than Nebula thought her father capable of, especially when he was still bent on punishing her for failing to invade earth that faithful day.
"Yeah… his bride. Thanos called Steve the 'Golden Bride' and when Steve refused him… Thanos… he ate Steve's heart…" Tony murmured, his legs losing the strength they had in them. Suddenly Tony saw himself sliding down the floor, tears he desperately tried to hold in since he saw Steve die start sliding down his face, not caring that he was showing his family how weak and vulnerable he was after that crushing vision. "I couldn’t save him… we… I just stood there as Thanos killed everyone… I just stood there as he ate Steve's heart…" Sobs wrecked Tony's body, the horror that he witness was too much for his mind to handle; it was too much.
? It seemed that our next target has arrived!" Steve cheered pointing at the alien that looked like a purple grape descending from one of the ships and claiming to be Thanos the Mad Titan and Ruler of The Universe… or something of that sort.
The sound of a childish giggle made Bruce tense, a shiver ran down his body as he turns around to see Steve standing behind him with a knife, a bloody grin taking over the Addams' face as he took in Bruce like he was planning to kill him here and now. Oh God, he was going to die! "I wanna make a deal with you!" Bruce squeak, nearly having a heart attack when Steve took a step toward him.
So here Tony was, checking himself out with a satisfied grin that kept on stretching on his face, giving him a creepy look if Tony was honest. "Well, if that isn't a scary sight I don't know what is… you are going to fit in the Addams family quite well." Rhodey shivered as he entered the room, letting out a snort when Tony's grin widened even more as he tilted his head.
"Nothing bad will happen, I promise." Tony assured, taking Morgan from Pepper when the baby starts getting fussy; Tony tried desperately to ignore the skeptic look Rhodey sent his way, tried to ignore how his heart starts pounding in his chest when he noticed from the corner of his eyes that someone was watching from outside the window, he tried to ignore the thought of whoever outside was a ghost because Jarvis didn't inform anyone that there was someone pepping at them from the outside…
Today was one of the good days it seems, Harley didn't have any anxiety or aggravate his asthma from how wound up he became, plus Howard was coming to babysit the kids because according to him, he missed the two street urchins (He mainly say that, because the Harley and Peter always win his money in card games). Taking it as their chance, Steve and Tony went to the doctor's appointment, both of them were excited and a little bit overwhelmed about the news they would no doubt receive.
"Drink, Tony." The Omega's voice made Tony look up from the cup, to look at the Omega, that sat across of him with a cup of his own, looking at the cup in deep thoughts, that made the Alpha take a shaky breath before he raised his cup blowing the tea taking a sip, gazing at the Omega every time he thought that Steve was not looking at him. "Tony… I can't do this all over again…" Steve sighed as he put his cup down looking at the Alpha with tired eyes, and that made Tony squeeze the cup tightly in his hands. "I have a child to think about, do you understand? A child who thinks that his father is someone else, a child who thinks that his father is away working in some mythical country, do you understand the place I am in now? Two to three years from now, when Peter asked me why his father didn't show up, what am I going to say to him, other than his father dying, or maybe you want me to tell him the truth, that way, he will hate you, tell me, Tony, what do you want me to do?" Steve asked which made Tony swallow and look at the Omega with glassy eyes full of tears, and Steve had to look away because he knows that he can't handle looking at Tony's face right now or his resolves will break.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, angst, sadness, violence, panic attacks, mention of infant's death, and poor Stevie! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"How about the two of us go and see a movie? Or maybe we can go to any nearby cemetery and go wake up the dead, oh! Maybe we can even go dancing! What do you think, Stevie? Just you and me, like old times." Bucky asked with a hopeful look in his eyes, and Steve pressed his lips tightly, yes, his mother was right in one thing, it would have been easier for him if he fell in love with Bucky because then it meant that he doesn't have to change who he was, but the thing is, Steve never went at anything the easy way.
"Well, you really…?" Steve asked, his voice too stunned to be more than a whisper, and when Tony nodded his head, Tony had to stop himself from letting out a pleasant purr when Steve grins like a lunatic. "Oh God, thank you!" Steve grinned as he pulled Tony tightly in his embrace, and start kissing his ticklish neck which made Tony squeak and start wiggling out, trying to get out of Steve's strong grip.
"No, there is no such a thing as an antidote to the poison that Hydra creates, and even if there is, it will take at least a year to be able to crack the genetic code of the poison and make the antidote." Howard's words gained a snarl from Bucky and the rest of the Alphas in the room.
Tony let out his breath as he heard that beautiful voice after all these years, Tony could hear the news in the background, but he didn't care, he only cared about that beautiful voice who was talking on the phone, Tony cross the portal and he heard the gasp from the line.
“Steve, there you are!” Bucky called out happily, only to take a step back when Steve whirled on him, planning to kill every person standing in his way, and probably kill Tony too, for being so occupied with the less important thing than their son, who was in his room sniffing miserably. “Did something…?” Bucky couldn’t even finish, for he was feeling his instincts to fight of flight pick up, mostly flight, which made Bucky wonder to himself, how an Omega who was one-hundred pound soaked wet, have the ability to scare the living daylight out of anyone if he put his mind into it.
Dr. Cho smiled at that happily, leading Tony to the machine that was in the corner, Tony sat on the chair and raised his shirt making the woman hum. "Now, this is going to feel cold." She said making Tony jump a little as he felt something sticky and cold on his tummy, he glared at the doctor who chuckled softly; Tony looked away, hoping that the woman will be done soon so he could leave.
And what is Peggy up to?
The next time Tony woke up, he groaned at how his head felt fuzzy and how his mouth felt like he stuffed cotton inside, when Tony opened his eyes, his heart gave a painful pang when he saw Peter snuggling into him while trying to stay quiet lest he woke up the Omega, which made Tony close his eyes tightly and pull Peter in his embrace making the small boy let out a squeak whilst he snuggled into the younger man's chest, taking comfort from Tony.
"But dad, I studied yours and Dr. Erskine notes." Well, he may have taken a look at his father's journal; it was his father's fault for leaving it unattained. "If I remember correctly the serum turns Steve Rogers into the perfect spaceman." This is true, let's not lie about that. "So, basically beside the serum giving Captain America superhuman strength, speed, and agility, the Super Soldier Serum may theoretically of course unless you have a better explanation?" Tony asked and when he saw his father narrow his eyes he continued. "It can also give the Captain strange survival capabilities… maybe like surviving extreme low temperatures by preventing freezing of the blood through glycogenolysis…" Tony muttered but shrugged, he was an engineer he works with machines, and he didn't understand biology that much to spectate what will happen to a super-soldier.
Steve gaze around the room his eyes fell on the balcony that was facing the door, the closet to the right that was hidden by a huge claw-like machine, taking in the double bed with the blue sheets in the  right corner that was made; the couch beside the door, the wooden floor, the posters on the walls, and his original shield from his time as a USO dancer hanging above the bed, the small nicknacks that were every way he looked, the left the wall was covered with shelves that were covered with books and prizes and pictures it made Steve walked toward them to take a good look. A computer on the desk under the small library lights up making Steve blink in confusion and look down toward the computer only to see a text on the screen.
"Five hundred years ago, he warned us about Thanos… but there was a lot of bitter blood, so everyone ignored his warnings, and not a year later Thanos went against the nine realms." Thor tried to explain as best as he can. "But what really changed everything, was two years ago, when I was banished to Midgard… after that, everyone realized that his actions were for a reason and that he can see what is to happen in the far away future, stars respect him for that, and wished to follow him… I tried to change after what happened in Midgard, hoping that he will see me as worthy when he sees that I have changed…" Thor looked down at his feet, feeling ashamed as he told his friends how they treated one of the people in their realms.
"You are doing what you think needs to be done, it's not the same, Tony," Steve stated, his words causing Tony to fall silent, good, Steve doesn't need for their conversation to turn into a fight, not when Steve needed to gather himself first before starting his conversation again.
"As much as I am amused by seeing you got sassed by Maria's voice, even more, we need to go to Shield, for statements." Peggy said an amused smile taking over her red lips, smiling when her words made Tony's face get redder than he already was, she was really glad for the AI refusing Tony's request, knowing the Omega, he would have disassembled the AI with no way to put it back together.
Tony swallowed and looked at the building that was going to change his fate any minute now, after taking a big breath Tony marched toward the building with a gift bag in his hand. When he reached Sam Wilson's office, the smile fell off his face as he saw the Beta with his head in his hands looking at the file on his desk with a tired look on his face.
"Oh? I thought you knew,
"Bring them in… please." Tony said with a shaky voice that made Steve pause and look at the pup that was too busy playing with the Shield and the plush to pay attention. "Give him to me, I will try and calm him down." Tony said as he extends his hands to take the pup, which made Steve stand from his chair holding the pup, which made the small boy squeal happily as he was put in his mother's lap. "Hey love, had a lot of fun over there didn't you?" The Omega hummed as the pup giggled and nod his head snuggling into Tony's chest. "Baby…" Tony's trembling voice made the pup look up at his mother who was giving a trembling smile. "Mama is about to meet his family, remembering grandpa and grandma? They are here with aunt Peggy, Angie, Jarvis, and some of Mama's old friends… they are good people love, so you don't have to be afraid…" Tony said which made the pup look at the door then at his mother, worry and fear to shine in his eyes.
Captain America's fucking mate, did you get that or should I repeat it a second time?" Tony mocked the man; his sharp smile was more of baring his teeth then it was a smile, and he took a dark pleasure in how Stane was unbalanced by his answer, his face turning red from anger after opening and closing his mouth and no words left the man.
Going back to his normal life after the events with Stane was harder than Tony ever imagined; not only because he has his baby girl in his arms now, but because Tony knows the truth of what happened. For a long time, Tony thought about packing everything and leaving, just like the Rogers family who ran away in the middle of the night. But every time he looked at his daughter, he just couldn't do it, not to her; not when Howard was still out there waiting for them, not when the two of them had finally found a safe place, even if it was temporary.
The choked gasp coming from the son of Odin made everyone turn to the man who looked as pale as a sheet, as he took in the sight of the man before him, the cuffs, the ripped clothes in some parts, the bruising that started to show. "Odin's beard! What have you done Brother Stark?" Thor called out as he rushed toward the blond man who was sitting on the ground, which made the man tense when Thor all but throw himself at his feet as he bowed so low before Steven that his forehead touched the ground. "Please forgive the foolish mortal, O Ancient One, he did not know of your greatness!" Thor cried out which made Steven nearly grimace at his thunderous voice, but gathered himself.
"Why don't you look at that?" Tony coos which only made Peter puff his small chest in pride as he inspects his work, the two of them spent the day in the lab after Tony made a big breakfast for Peter and himself, if the Omega was true to himself, he will say that he enjoyed his day with the small pup, the two of them had decided to build an engine for one of Tony's old car, trying to improve it, the time was spent with Tony teaching the pup the do and don't, smiling in pride when the pup focused at every word Tony said, trying to write the notes Tony gave in a small sketchbook that the pup brought with him.
Pepper was with him when it happened, the two of them were cooking breakfast, while Megan was playing in the living room, when his phone start ringing, at first Tony, was confused about who would call him on his day off, he ends up sighing as he went to his phone thinking that it was his father that was calling, but when Tony picked up his phone, his breath left him as he read Sam Wilson's name on the caller ID.
"Is that everyone or is there someone else?" Serpentine asked after she listened to the doll and the spider squeaked and hissed at each other, both of them complaining about Tony being able to disappear without them even being able to kill him. The sentiment was cute as hell, Tony most be popular and well-loved if all of his friends wanted to kill him and get rid of him, no wonder why Steve fell for him; unfortunately, Serpentine didn't have enough time to stand still as this reunion continued, she wants to return Bucky to his former glory so that she can plan her next world's crises. I mean Steve wasn't called the best strategic mind in the twenty century out of thin air, was he?
So what do you think?
"You say dangerous, but I have the feeling that you meant stupid." Steven said as he tried to think about the first part of her speech, what does she mean by destroying the flow of time? The woman smiled at that instead of only her lips twitching a look of amusement took over her face.
"I am sure Tony." Steve stated, feeling so uncomfortable standing naked in front of his husband; Steve shifted in his place before going to pick up his clothes from the ground, redressing himself, trying to ignore how sticky and sweaty he was, he will shower later. Tony catching on to Steve's discomfort so he went to redress himself, sending Steve worried looks now and then.
"Brat!" The Alpha growled as he stood up, trying to intimidate James, only for the boy to squeak and hiss at the man, calling him a
Once Peggy and Tony stood near them, Steven could feel the tension from the two of them, it made him concern especially when Bruce and Clint (Who told them that the two of them were Omegas) start fidgeting a little, even Natasha who was an Alpha didn't look Peggy in the eyes. "Well, Anthony, don't you have something to share with Steven?" Peggy hissed which made Tony flinch and bite his bottom lip.
"What are you doing? Kill it!" Tyber shouted, his voice turning the bear's head to the loud noises, a few seconds later the bear charged, causing Tyber to scream as he ran behind Anton, causing the Alpha to snarl at the undignified act. The bear roared, charging at Anton then, causing the Alpha to jump to the side, his sword slashing the bear's side, which gained him a dark growl from the bear that stood on its hind limb and swing one of its massive arms before letting out a roar.
"Yeah, thankfully, everything sits, and Peter is finally cleaning his room so this is a plus. Oh! I already asked Bucky to buy some blueberry muffins in case the cakes Sarah brought aren't enough and-" Tony didn't manage to finish his nervous rambling, for Steve stood behind him and pulled him into his chest, holding him tightly.
"Oh, thank God, I don't think I can handle looking at any more invitations without crying!" Tony gave a relieved sigh, turning in Steve's lap and giving him a grateful kiss before snuggling into his embrace. "Now that we are finished with all this jazz tell me about that Harley kid that you and Peter seem to adore." Tony smiled as he gazed up at Steve, causing the Alpha's lips to twitch in amusement.
"Let go of me!" Tony shrieked as he pulled out of the man's embrace after kicking his shin (Being short taught Tony a lot about kicking shins, though he was not going to admit that even with the threat of death!), Rogers after letting go of him, looked at him with so much pride and love that it made Tony's skin crawl. "Pepper, do your thing!" Tony whined as he hides behind the woman, and that made Rogers look at her and tilt his head in confusion.
"So where are we going?" Steve asked as he buckled his belt, and Tony took it upon himself to give the Alpha the directions he needed. After half an hour the three of them reached the clinic, Peter was more awake and was chatting Tony's ears off about some school projects and asked for a few pointers on how to complete it, which Tony was too happy to share with the pup, the Alpha was humming now and then showing them that he was listening to the two of them, but mainly he was focusing on the news he was hearing from the radio.
"Tony!" Bucky and Peggy's calls of his name caused Tony to blink his eyes, his lips trembling as he turned around to take in the uncomfortable look that painted the faces of the two people that Tony considered as his family. "I… we can explain Tony…" Bucky whispered, the plea in his voice didn't go unnoticed, and Tony hated this, he hated this, especially hating how the two people who Tony love and considered as his parents betrayed his trust, and why was Tony even surprised? This always happened, every time Tony thought he found people he could trust and love, they always stab him in the back.
"What the fuck is going on here?" Peggy snarled and Steven winces at her loud voice, entering the room hoping that the wolves didn't attack her before Steven save her… reaching Peggy, Steven's eyes widen when he heard the loud sound of bones breaking, and then suddenly the two wolves that were there turned into humans… Steve and Tony to be exact, while Tony was glowing red with embarrassment, Steve was crossing his arms around his chest but he was not looking at Peggy's eyes, what made Steven's eyes widen though, was that both men were naked as the day they were born, which made Steven turn his gaze away from the two, face turning red with embarrassment as the realization of what took a place not a few seconds ago hit him with a new light… "You what?" Peggy's screams made Steven blink his eyes returning to the conversation once again.
Tony swore, and he would swear for the end of his days that he only closed his eyes for a Nano-second, a Nano-second! Somehow in this Nano-second, Steve Grant Rogers was able to use his creepy power of time and space and appear in front of Tony who doing the wheel pose; Steve was sitting on the ground Indian style purring as his eyes took Tony over, not leaving an inch unexplored, and Tony never felt naked in his life even when he was naked. "You are so flexible,
Two years since Tony start seeing a therapist; his mental state not being that great after having to deal with the strange town and their strange monster, and the people who came after him planning on killing him, starting from Ty and ending with Howard… half a year since Tony finally managed to get over the strangeness and madness he was forced to live through; finally deciding to open a new page and living his life like he always wanted to. A few months since Tony finally managed to categorize his feelings for the strange creature living in the lake, whom he hated but still grateful for his protection.
"Thanks for the vote of confidence." Tony grumbled, but he understands what they are saying, a few months back before knowing that he was expecting, you will find him binging in his labs twelve hours straight without any break or someone to talk to, now, Tony nearly have everyone in the town looking after him, everyone treating him like their young family member. They fell silent, watching the rain fall outside and soak into the street, taking bits of their food now and then, sending each other gentle and happy looks, taking in the comfort of talking to each other comfortably after years.
The Yoga scene's kiss was inspired by art that my friend showed to me; many thanks and kisses to the artist who draw that picture and the person who commissioned it, you are amazing!!!
"I ask a few questions and you answer them, easy is it not?" The king asked with a smirk, which made the Omega blink at that a little not expecting the man to ask that of him considering that he was his '
Steve and Peter went to the front porch, Steve taking a seat on the stairs with Peter in his lap, which made the small boy look at him with confusion. "Peter, tell me honestly, do you like Tony?" Steve asked in a soft voice, knowing that his actions and words were probably confusing his boy, but he was hoping that Peter will understand.
And my, my, it seems that Tony starts warming up to Steve!
"How did you… what change your mind?" Tony end up asking looking at the Alpha that smiled at him and then pointed at the room that had children running and laughing inside of, Tony turned his attention inside and he smiled as he saw his baby, sitting on one of the round table chairs and was drawing something, his little tongue sticking out as he was trying to focus.
Finally, we reach the Endgame!
"Who was your husband, Steven?" Peggy asked as he looked at Asgard keeping an eye on Steven who gives a small smile as he turns his face to Peggy raising his eyebrow like he already knows that she knows that answer which made the woman's lips twitch up in a smile. "He was Tony isn't he?" She asked which made Steven hum and give a sad smile at that, eyes returning to his ring. "You know, you can start a new life here, getting to know everyone, getting to know Tony, asking him out on a date." Said Peggy as she leans her elbows on the balcony rails made of concrete.
"Hey…" Tony finally gathered himself enough to say this one word, sounding like an idiot when he said it, but he didn't care, especially when Steve gave him a bashful smile. "You look beautiful!" Tony said suddenly, his eyes widen when he realized what he said to Steve, God he was such an idiot! Beautiful? Men aren't beautiful, they are handsome! Steve was so going to leave him after this!
Tony doesn't know what to do, to be fair, he doesn't even know how to deal with a heat, the only time he had an ordinary heat was when he presented, the second he had Peter, so to be told that he was going into heat was a little jarring if he was fair with himself. If Tony wants to be honest to himself, he will admit that it was scary, that if it was up to Tony, he wishes to never have any heat again. But that was scientifically impossible unless he was barren, and having Peter defiantly told him that he was fertile, even if he had a strange way of dealing with heats by having them years and years apart and not every six months like healthy normal Omega.
Steven and the Avengers finally returning from their hunt, thankfully they were able to defeat Hydra, this time with no causalities, and they were able to destroy Project Inside before it was even launched. Not finding Tony anywhere, Steven went to search for him, that's when he found him in his workshop crying; Steven not being able to handle seeing Tony in tears went and sat with him waiting for Tony to tell him what's wrong.
"It's January 25th, 2012, why?" The other Steve said, hearing that made the air rush out of Steve's lungs, he felt like the earth had opened and swallowed him whole, he felt like he was falling, and falling, and falling and there was no way to catch him, how is this even possible? He died! He knew he did, then how was he here? With a young Peggy! The Peggy he met in 2012 was an old woman in her nineties, not this young woman in her prime, and to top it all the Avengers are here too! That doesn't make any sense; it doesn't make any sense, none, nothing was making a sense! Fear, despair, and pain took hold of Steve's heart, making him chock and held into his sobs, as he felt sweat sliding down his back.
His second appointment with Dr. Cho, it actually was good. Tony hummed happily to himself, thinking about what took place in the past month. After he told Pepper, who told Happy, who told Rhodey that he was pregnant, everything actually turns out to be good! Tony took a vacation from SI, and considering that he never took one since he starts working there and usually took suppressants and scent neutralizers, he never worried about heat, or his scent affecting anyone, so he had a lot of time for his use. Also, his belly got big, which made him drop the sweatpants and sweaters and wore the Maternity clothing that Pepper bought for him, his only problem that his bladder was the size of a peanut and him having to go every five minutes to the bathroom… it was worth it in the end when he felt the baby fluttering inside of him.
"Would that be so bad if I did?" Steve asked, and Tony can see the sincerity in his eyes, and nope, just nope, he did not just ask Tony that question; will it be bad? For Tony, no, it won't, because he will get to live with someone normal and maybe he will eventually like, but for Steve? The man will be miserable! He practically lives for summoning demons and voodoo dolls and being creepy all night long. This will kill him! And no! Hell no! Tony was not going to be that bitch who order people to change who they were just to fit to be with them, how dare Rogers pull a Tony on him? That was Tony's shit, not the crazy Addams!
"Hello, who is this?" Steve answered the phone when it rang, wondering who was calling in the middle of the night; today was an eventful day, a day was full of hard work and moving (Tony and Bucky) and preparing the baby's room (Also Tony and Bucky because they refuse for Steve to raise a finger) a day that Steve and Tony finally agreed on their baby's name (Mainly Steve, who told Tony that he love the name Morgan and want their daughter to have that name) so yes, today was an eventful day and Steve just wanted to go back to sleep.
Well, it was the start of something alright, it wasn't a friendship per se, but it was better than the two of them being enemies who wanted to bash each other's heads; they are heading there, the friendship road Tony meant. Steven no longer growl and glare at him every time he walked inside a room, he never tried to start any fights like he used to, though he still throws his deadly pillows if Tony said something insulting, which is way better than the barbs they used to throw at each other, though, Tony still wonder from where Steven got his pillow sniper skills, even Bucky commented on how excellent they were, and that if Steven wanted he could teach him how to handle a gun… it took Steven five seconds before agreeing with a terrifying grin that made everyone but Bucky and Peggy shiver in fear and terror, needless to say, Steven and Bucky hit it off, and now you can say they are as thick as thieves, not that Tony is jealous or anything.
"Don't look at me like that Barnes! It was your boy who asked me out!" Tony's words made the room around him become so quiet, like every sound was sucked out of this universe, and it made the hair on Tony's body stand on end, especially when his teammates looked at him like they were getting ready to kill him and rip his body to pieces, later feeding it to the dogs… a look like that seeing it on Barnes and Natasha, even Clint's face was normal… but for Bruce and Thor to actually look at him like that? OK… Tony needed Jarvis to fire his suit; he was going to Malibu and fuck Fury and his 'The team needed to stay together' shit!
Natasha on the other hand had her hands on her hips, no doubt she was ready to give him an earful, but her hands drop down when Clint sends her a knowing look, which made her sigh and grumbles. “Oh God, Tones, look at you!” Rhodey’s eyes widen as he let go, gazing at Tony’s pregnant belly with wide eyes, Pepper not that far behind, though her eyes were sparkling with joy at how happy and glowing Tony was.
"Rogers!" Tony snarled when he saw the man crossing his arms over his chest, Tony's scream made everyone, even the whimpering Natasha turn to the angry man who was snarling and looking at Rogers like he would rip him open a new one, which did nothing but make Rogers sigh happily, like being subjected to Tony's rage was the only thing he ever wanted… Tony really needed to find a therapist for the man (that would handle all of the Addams' craziness) and he won't give a fuck about what Barnes says! "What the fuck did you do?" Tony hissed as he took a kitchen knife and held it to Rogers' throat, which only caused the man to look at him like the sun was shining from his ass, which was uncomfortable on so many different levels.
Tony raises his arm excitedly and waved down the black BMW as it gets closer, and it flashes its headlights in response, making Tony bite his lips to stop his squeal in happiness. He starts walking toward the parking lot, seeing the car turns smoothly, the wheels crunching on the loose gravel. The door opens and Tony rushed in the last few steps as he saw Pepper climbs out, with Rhodey not that far behind. “Pep! Rhodey!” Tony called out, which made the two rushes toward him and pull him in a tight hug when they reached him, causing Tony to let out a happy laugh.
It didn't take a long time before the Avengers (With Steve and Peter) flow back to the tower, leaving the burned mansion behind with the helplessness of knowing that there was nothing to save, not when the fires eat everything in the mansion. From the rooms to the basement, to their belongings, even some parts of the garden, nothing survived; everything was turned into ashes and coal. Seeing his home burn, hurt Tony deeply, especially when the mansion that burned was the one Tony was raised in since he was nothing but a young child. In the end, Tony swallowed the pain of seeing his childhood burn, being happy and thankful that his son was unharmed; Tony will let the mansion burn again and again if it meant his baby will be safe.
"Yes, he woke up after Peter and I arrived, I managed to distract him and Peter with blueberry cupcakes and muffins." Steve's lips twitched up, remembering how Harley's eyes widen when they took in the fluffy and sugary treat… it would be a nightmare today, the Alpha wonder if he would manage to shepherded the kids to sleep when they are going to be on sugar high most of the day.
"Why?" Tony choked out after he managed to dislodge the piece of bread that made it its mission to choose the wrong pipe and kill him; other than his shocked and annoyed reaction and Steve's happy cheers, all of the Avengers had a horror look on their faces as they tried to protest one way or another to change Serpentine's mind, as for Bucky, the man looked ready to commit genocide, and no doubt the first target on his list was Tony.
"You knew from the start?" Tony sniffed when Steve nodded his head. "Why didn't you tell me?" Tony breathed out, watching as Steve turned to his bag and get out a small card, making the Omega 'oh' at that and take the card, already knowing what was inside, and he shouldn't really be surprised, after all, Bucky did tell him that they have a friend named Sam in social services who went to DC last year, he should have put two and two together.
Tony… Tony, really wanted Steve to ask him out, he really wanted to go with the Alpha on a date, he knows that the Alpha is different from any other Alphas out there; he knows that the Alpha won't stab him in the back. But the Omega know for sure that the Alpha won't ask him out, that he was waiting for Tony to ask him, which made Tony more flushed then he can handle, how in the name of God was he going to ask Steve on a date? The Omega had never been asked, and it made Tony bite his lip with a flushed face, a smile taking over his face at the thought of Steve saying 'Yes' to him, and it made Tony's heart flutter at that, at Steve being his Alpha, and maybe, in the end, being his mate.
"Oh, my God, what the hell happened? One second you were opening the closet and the next you tripped and the door was slammed shut!" Rhodey was breathing hard as he looked around him in fear, his eyes were wild as he looked around the place like something was going to come out and attack them any minute now.
"You don't need to love someone to fuck them, Mr. Rogers." Mr. Stark replied which made the Omega bit his cheek to stop him from screaming at the man. "Well, that was Anthony's case, it was funny how you really believed that he could ever love you… a child. You have three days to leave before you will be evacuated by force or worse." The Alpha said as he turned around to leave but he paused a little and turned toward Steve who was shaking so badly he thought he was going to fall. "A word of advice Mr. Rogers, A child can't know what love is." That was Mr. Start's last words before leaving Steve in the living room.
Tony waved his hand jokingly as he said that cursed name, he tried to pretend that he wasn't breaking on the inside that his heart wasn't bleeding, that he could make do with it if Steve came back, he will be whatever Steve wanted him to be…
"What about the king?" Nattalegg asked which made the Omega sighed at that and pointed to the ship's wheel, the woman turned her head to see the king behind the wheel, sitting the course for them to return home, glaring at everyone who dared to gaze his way, scaring everyone within ten feet of him, and that was fate if Nattalegg saw any, it made her really wonder…
"His heart will break either way, at least like this, we will find Bucky fast, and he will have a lot of time to recover." Steven said which made Peggy not her head at that and let out a sigh.
Steven can feel everyone pausing at the king's words, from the people who came to greet their family members, to those who were moving the riches and gold, all of them were gazing at the king like he has told them that he was the heir to Asgard, though the Alpha with the red hair and blue eyes shook her shock first and turned around, snapping orders which made everyone move hastily last they were punished. "Why the change of heart, my friend?" Jamti whispered in the king's ear making the Alpha purse his lips and turn his eyes toward him ignoring the Omega who was still glaring at the king.
"Did the king force you?" suddenly Margaret pulled away, heat and rage burning in her eyes as she gazed at Steven. "It was that barbaric king, he forced himself on you did he not? He got you… he… and then… I will kill him!" Margaret hissed darkly, looking a minute away from going through what she stated; only getting a sigh from Steven who gazed away.
!' Tony praised, he could only moan and whimper as his husband thrust inside of him, only to stop and start toying with him again; it seemed like Tony had managed to marry the world's most stubborn menace, and Tony wondered if he will get it into Steve's brain that he's not fucking Tony well enough, maybe then Steve will take mercy on him and give him what he wants. With a frustrated noise, Tony planted his other foot into the bed and rolls his hips up, gasping when it drove Steve deeper inside him but not deep enough. "Steve!" Tony ended up resorting to whining, something he wasn't proud of doing but will do again if it meant that Steve will touch him like he wants.

But everything starts changing two weeks later when he started feeling sick every morning, the first time it happened, he thought he caught a stomach bug, that it will go when time pass but after a month and a half? He knew something was wrong… in the end, he went and bought as many tests as he could, hoping against hope that he was wrong…
Before Tony opened the red door in front of him, the door was thrust opened showing Tony his workshop, which made realization paint Tony's face and a terrified peep get out of him. All of this time and that crazy Addams could have waltzed inside his workshop like he owned the place! Tony turned to Steve gazing at him with wide eyes, only to see the happy and pleasant look on the older man's face.
"Coming through, a handsome fella with a lot of popcorns and chips is coming through!" Tony called out loudly as he carried huge bowls of popcorn and chips, walking to the table the rest of the Avengers prepared, filled with many drinks, sweets, chips, and popcorn, in every kind and flavor imaginable. Peter was trailing behind him, carrying a bowl of dip with him, his tongue sticking out as he tried to concentrate on not dropping it or stumble around.
that letch on him? Tony made his mind, as soon as the obstetrician tells him that he was pregnant, Tony was going straight away to abort it.
"Pepper, you must come and see this, bring Morgan with you." Rhodey said in what looked like a dreamy voice, and it took a minute for Tony to realize that his best friend was talking through the walkie-talkie too enchanted by this small room to pay attention. "Did you know about this place?" Rhodey asked as he walked through the room, picking up toys and books to inspect them, only to put them back to their place.
It made them concern, how the boy was so sure the two of them was going to get rid of him just because they were having another baby; they even talked with Betty about this behavior, and no matter what new approach the woman tried to use with Harley, it was of no use, the boy kept sticking to Steve or Tony's side, following them everywhere they went… Tony was so going to destroy that family when he was going to find them.
"I know, sweetheart, and it's OK… it is OK, I won't do anything to hurt
(See the end of the chapter for
"I didn't want to date someone fake… I am already surrounded by fake people all my life; I don't need someone to fake themselves just to be with me." Tony mumbled, returning back to his ice cream and ignoring the 'Aweee!' he heard above him, too busy stuffing his face and stumping on the porcelain doll that targeted his legs with its small knife. God, Tony really needed to make Steve stop bringing these demon-possessed dolls to the mansion, they reproduce like rats, every time Tony thought he finished them, double the number will come back the next day. "Is this your version of the shovel talk?" Tony asked, gazing at the ghost who was taking him in with amusement, her bloody lips stretch wide in a smile.
"Well, yes, of course, his name is J you know like 'Men in Black'? Wait do you even understand that reference because if you don't we can totally watch the movies-" Tony was cut from his rambling by the look Steven was throwing him. 'I know you are talking shit and you thought I didn't hear It.' which actually made Tony gulp as a shiver run down his spine.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Poor baby! Didn't Stevie tell you what it meant to date an Addams?" Serpentine cooed in a motherly voice, the glee in her eyes though, informed Tony that 'Stevie' didn't tell him what it meant on purpose. "Well, he was brainwashed for seventy years, of course, he will forget!" Serpentine tried to justify, but she couldn't play Tony, not when Tony was a businessman with many doctorates and a higher IQ than most living beings on this plant (If you didn't count his stupid trusting personality) "Well, dating is a serious for the Addams family, so serious that we only ask someone on a date once sometimes twice in a lifetime, excluding people asking us; we consider the first date as the courting phase, and if the person we asked out agree to the second date -which you did- it means the agree to our propose of marriage!" Serpentine sighed happily floating from side to side as she giggled, ignoring how the blood left all of Tony's face leaving him as pale as a sheet.
"Peter, God, I am so sorry little bambino, I didn't know, so sorry." Tony choked as he was finally able to detect Steve's scent on the small pup, hiding behind the scent of sickness and medicine, God, how was he so blind that he didn't notice his bambino the first time he met him? Tony could only take the pup's scent and let out a calm rumble which made his baby purr happily.
“They couldn’t come, Steve is taking Peter to see his friend Sam in Chicago, so they are staying there for a few days, they asked me to come with them, but unfortunately I had honey bear’s birthday to attend.” Tony said in mock disappointment, putting his hand on his chest, letting out an annoyed sigh which caused everyone to chuckle.
In the end, Tony could only hide in his lab under his workbenches, trying to run away from the crazy Addams and their quest of finding the one who decided to raise his hand and force Tony to live in an abusive relationship… if only they knew that half of his relationships were like that. Needless to say, Tony's stress levels were through the roof with how Serpentine and Steve (Especially Steve) kept nagging him about the person who dared to touch Tony when his touch wasn't wanted nor welcome.
As much as Tony pouted a storm today and tried to convince his friends to stay with him for the unforeseeable future, the two of them needed to go back to New York, not only to keep an eye on Howard and Obadiah, but they also have their jobs to return too, Tony was so thankful that the two of them came to see him as soon as they can even when Howard was watching them trying to find where they hide Tony, not knowing that Tony was able to run away thanks to his mother, who according to his friends, was seeing a therapist, trying to get better, which made Tony sigh in relieve at the thought of his mother finally defeating her depression, maybe one day, Tony will take his daughter so she will meet her grandmamma.
They spent a few minutes in each other's embrace, holding each other and refusing to let go, taking comfort and reassurance from each other. "Peter is getting better." Tony murmured, nuzzling Steve's throat, letting out a happy hum when his mate relaxed, like a weight has been remove from his shoulders.
"Who was he?" A dark growly voice questioned behind Tony, making the genius's eyes widen in shock when he noticed that the wall he was leaning on was not a wall, but was… looking behind his back slowly, Tony gulp when he noticed that it was the person he didn't want to see right now… Steve Grant Rogers in his full Winter Soldier gear. Now Tony doesn't know what he is to do when the blazing blue eyes kept gazing at him as if expecting him to utter the name in his mind so that Steve will handle the rest… and oh, does Steve know how to handle it? Death and pain, that's how!
"Boss, we found him… the number belongs to Obadiah Stane." Said Coulson looking at Peggy while fidgeting… hearing that name made Howard go into a raging fit, he screamed, threats, and pleas and begged Peggy to go with the Strike team that will go, Peggy didn't want Howard to go, because if she knew her friend well, she knows that he would shoot Stane before they even find Tony.
." Steve stated, turning Tony to face him even when the genius wanted to look away, but at least it was the first time that Steve apologizes to him… sincerely. "I just thought that you will be more acceptant, Bucky was." Steve tried to explain, getting an eye roll from Tony who let out a groan at the admission; of course, Bucky was!
"No, he came home, six p.m., you made us a fancy dinner, and then you told Tony you are pregnant. You fainted after Tony starts talking about buying drinks or something…" Bucky said slowly, standing up and going to the sink to give his coffee cup a quick rinse. "Maybe you should take him to the doctor, Tony." Bucky said uncomfortably, before rushing out of the kitchen, but not before giving Steve a look like he was insane.
So now, until the Bifrost is repaired, Steven was held on Midgard; defenseless, without his magic to protect him and not even knowing how to handle the stone that was attached to him, depending on the son of Odin and his merry crew of 'Superheroes' to keep him safe… how ironic.
If you are wondering what Steven looks like, then he looked like how he was in Endgame with the slightly long hair. As for Steve he looked just like in The First Avenger, I think there is a lot of difference in their looks from the first movie to the last, maybe I will make Steven grow his beard once more? Who knows, though you can vote on that!
Steve rolled his eyes at Peggy not noticing her eyes narrowing at his actions. "Come on, Peg, I am sure that my face isn't that forgettable is it." Steve smiled a little as Peggy's opened her mouth in shock; no one had called her by that name since…
"Do you know why you are here?" Starkad asked calmly, shifting in his throne, Jamti, and Magna who were standing on each of his sides send him a look; probably the two of them were shocked about the calm tone he spoke in, in contrast to his angry and raging scent that was suffocating the hill they were hosting the 'Thing' on. Hamar on the other hand was flinching and whimpering every time he moved, probably still in pain after getting his face rearranged. "Do you?" That question was asked in a shout, making everyone flinch, even Magna and Jamti, who knew that no harm will touch him and that only those who were kneeling at Starkad's feet will be met with a dark fate tonight.
Maybe this was Tony's way of apologizing? Granted Steve would have said yes as soon as Tony said sorry, it was still sweet of Tony to send him this note. Maybe it was Steve's fault as it was Tony's; admittedly, ever since the pregnancy was confirmed, Steve and Tony spent their time pushing each other away than spending their precious time together as they should.
Thank you all for liking the story and reading it! Never get this much Kudos in the first chapter!
The Omega acted like he was still unconscious as he cut in the robs bending his hands, his heart hurting painfully as his son's whines of fear and pain, the Omega bite his bottom lips in deep thoughts wondering if he should attack the man now, but his boy's whimpers made him tense and let out a sigh, deciding to act alone in hope of knowing what the man wanted. "Shush, baby, everything is going to be alright… Mommy is going to get you out of here just calm down baby…" Steve whispered to his pup as he sat, with his hands behind him, leaning a little on the small boy who let out a sob and hid in Steve's arms.
If you didn't read my new story 'The Iron King', then what are you waiting for?
OK, so it wasn't Tony's fault, to begin with, it was Howard? Right? After all who in their right mind would let their twenty years old kid live on while believing that his parents are dead? It is too cruel! It was true that Tony was not all that warm and chummy with his parents, but he loved them, he always seeks their approval one way or another; Tony even when he was angry with his parents for abandoning him most of his childhood and teenage years, he was proud to be their son. So for his parents to give him away like a used doll and abandoning Tony without even a word of goodbye is unforgivable! No matter what anyone was going to say, this was something that Tony couldn't (Wouldn't) forgive.
The sound of the AI made everyone jump and look at the ceiling. "You do?" Bucky asked with hitched breath not believing his ears, does JARVIS really knows where Steve was, his heart was pounding in his chest at the thought.
Bucky on the other hand was glaring hard at Tony, trying to make him burst in flames with the power of his glare alone; God, what Tony wouldn't give for that to happen at this moment, especially when Pepper seemed to be putting two and two together. "Tony…" Pepper stated in a low tone making Tony swallow and tried to back away before Pepper decided to skin him and using him to make a new shoes.
It's the year 2050 a lot of things changed, and a lot of things continued to change, after all, time changes everything…
Anthony never knew what heartbreak was, that was until he returned a month later and found the apartment empty. After a month had passed, Anthony returned to the apartment with a smile on his face, already imagining Steve waiting for him there with that gentle smile of his that made Anthony's heart dance in joy, so when he reached his apartment he was confused as why Steve hadn't come to greet him when he called out for him, Anthony had bit his lip feeling that something was wrong, walking inside of the house he saw something lying on the coffee table, he went to it and his heart stopped in his chest, this was his ID, the thing that he hated the most, with his full name, the name that confirms that he was a Stark.
"What happened?" Thor asked in such a young voice it made Steven press his lips hard, for even if the Asgardian before him was deemed a man to the ancient being in other realms, he was still in fact just a youngling in Steven's world, a youngling just like his brother need guiding.
Steve was still looking at the sky when that metal thing came into his view, making Steven frown harshly and give it a nasty look, already feeling his right leg throbbing. "So… are you done?" The metal thing asked which made Steven purse his lips but sighed and nodded his head, he was already too tired to care about what will happen to him, after all, he was interrupted from his four years journey toward his original body and fell here… into a wasteland that was inhabitant by metal creatures… a land that not even in all of Steven's long existent did he saw or gaze at that place. "Hey, I hate to ask and snap you out of your brooding hour, but do you know where that star that crashed here disappeared to?" The metal thing asked which made Steven scowl and send him a hateful glare, which made that thing raise both of its hands as if trying to calm him down.
"Now you listen here, you crazy…" Whatever word Steven was planning on spewing next got stuck in his throat as his face paled when his eyes fell on the person who spoke to him… his eyes immediately took in the dark brown eyes, the dark brown hair, and the tan skin, taking in the difference and the similarity he used to do when he sees Anton after he was reborn again denial, and pain taking over him as his breath hitched at the sight in front of him, at the sight of… "Anton…" Steven's voice cracked as he said that cursed name, taking a step back, wanting to be away from this nightmare, away from him… "No, no, no, no…" Steven's repeated under his breath, shaking as the shock thrummed in his system, it was only a few seconds after that the world tilted and everything turned dark…
Reaching the ground floor, Steve wheeled himself outside, heading to the garden that was open to all patients and their families; Steve didn't hear Peggy's footsteps behind, which caused him to relax a little at the thought of managing to have a few precious seconds to himself before being forced to fight with Bucky and Peggy once more.
"Do you know what happened?" Tony asked, stalking to Steve and pulling him away from Bucky, causing Steve to shift uncomfortably when he became the center of attention of the two Alphas. God, could the two of them act like civil people for an hour? Someone just trespass on the property and broke the office window!
The Alpha tilted his head to look at the Omega, a frown taking over his face and deepened when the Omega gazed at his eyes with a fire burning deep into his blue eyes, making the Alpha lean back and let out a harsh sigh through his nose. "Thank the Gods I am in a good mood today, princess." The king snapped, causing the Omega to huff at him, but he still didn't take his eyes away from the Alpha. "Because I am feeling generous today, I will allow you to go see your friends tomorrow, I will even lessen from your burden of work, by not cleaning the stables anymore, what do you think?" The king said, already feeling a headache coming, though, he wouldn't tell the Omega he was going to lessen his workload because he found some of his workers slacking off and giving their workload to the Omega, making the man work three times the amount that the king wanted him to work… even if the Alpha wanted to break him, he didn't want to do it this way, it was making the Omega more stubborn then softening him.
It was an hour later that the pup finally woke up, Tony's face becoming worried as the pup hugged his toy tightly, watching the TV silently without a word, only nodding his head or humming if he wanted something which was concerning as he tried to cheer the pup but getting no reaction.
Tony gave a small laugh at that and bite his lower lip to stop the smile from widening any farther than it already was, he then stood up to plug his phone in the charger, yawning as he gets ready to bed. Tony sighed happily as he laid gently on the bed, pulling the blanket over him and snuggling into his pillow, smiling all the way as sleep start taking over him… tomorrow was going to be a good day, he can feel it.
Steve looked at Tony as he heard the Omega's pained voice and he had to swallow at that. "He didn't, I handled it. Every reporter knows not to enter the clinic or take photos inside of it or there will be legal issues, that man tested our patience, too many times." Steve said which made the Omega let out a shaky sigh of relief as he leans on the wall behind him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You are awake…" Peggy said, and Steve mind was still too groggy to notice the coldness in Peggy's voice, the older man just hummed and tried to lift his arm only to stop by his hand being shackled to the bed.
"What did you do? After their death…" The star said, really wanting to know what Sara did to make the pain go away, to force herself of not thinking about the mortal every second of every time, the star really wanted to know, how she managed to shine so brightly when the only time he could shine was when he was able to see his mortal's face.
"I searched for you, when I was back I searched for you, I never found you, until you send me a letter two month later telling me how poor excuse of an Alpha I was, and that you become tired of me so you are going with Bucky because the Alpha came back to you, you told me you will be back if I became a real Alpha, and I did, I tried, I tried but you never come back…" Tony said wiping his tears before they fell, which caused Steve to sniff and look at his side refusing to see Tony.
"What do you mean baby?" Tony asked frantically touching his son's burning forehead. "You can't leave Mama… Mama Needs you right now… baby?" Tony shook his son a little, his son just let out a hitched breath but didn't wake… oh, God, no, no, no, no! Please don't take his baby away, please God, please!
"I'm sorry…" Tony smiled gently as he looked at the small boy who was scuffing his feet on the ground; Harley looked up when he heard Tony's words, giving a shrug and looking down once more. "This probably sucks; you probably wanted to enjoy your day with Steve and Peter, I'm sorry for spoiling your day." Tony leaned on the tree behind him, his eyes not leaving the thin boy who was now playing with the hem of his sleeve nervously.
"Who art thou?" That was Thor who asked; his tone was full of scared and bewildered emotions but he took step after step until he was facing Steven, grimacing at the sneer he gets from the blond man, who leaned on the wall behind him, his torso and arms painted in dry blood that was flaking.
"This was the first time I held him." Steve explained which caused Tony to nod his head and sniff, wiping his tears as he gazed at the picture, taking in the difference, how Steve didn't have any beard at that time, how handsome and young he looked when he shaved, so different then he looks right now, but to be honest Tony preferred his newer version over the picture he saw. "I was scared that day when May put the baby in my arms, thought I was going to drop him, was shaking all the while, but the baby didn't wake up even with all my stuttering." Tony chuckled wetly at that as he flipped to another page, and another… and another… smiling happily when he saw his pup, being grateful that he has so many pictures for him now, and not only the nine ones he spent two years gazing at them with pain.
." The woman hummed, her voice getting farther and farther away, but Peter's shaky voice and his cries get louder and louder, making Steve scream inside his mind.
Steve returned to the gardens indulging in his need for a sip of water before returning to finish his chores, sighing in relief when the king flat out told him to not even think about cooking tonight, which gave Steven the time to rest and catch his breath, making sure to cook something simple for him and his babe who was trying hard not to fall asleep, too tired from trying to help Steven in the gardens.
Anthony wished for these happy times to never disappear from him, he knew he was crazy, after all, who will buy a wedding band for someone that they were dating for only nine months? But every time he looked at the ring, he knew what he was feeling was true, he was madly in love with Steve Rogers and wanted to marry the Omega, so in the end, he proposed, and to his joy the Omega said 'Yes' Anthony would have cried in joy if the Omega didn't pull him in a kiss, telling him that he loved him.
… Tony's mind screamed and shouted, making Tony choke at the horror of his mistake… if only Rogers was here. "Then why now? Why did you let me live here for two years without showing up?" Tony asked, trying to distract Howard as he backed away, thinking of many different plans to protect his baby's from Howard's slimy hands.
' over and over again, mixed with '
9-Hættu! -Cease!
"Wanna go home…" Peter said as he saw his mother help him with his socks and shoes, the pup then gets off of the medical table after Steve helped him down, trying not to wince as he walked, knowing that his mother can't carry him anymore now he was ten, and he didn't want his mother to tire himself and have an asthma attack if he carried Peter's weight. "I wanna Oreo ice-cream." Peter said which made Steve nod his head and smile at the pup, kissing his forehead before getting out of the examination room.
"You know, darling, you would make an amazing Addams one day!" Steve stated happily, ignoring the yowl of the cat that Steve stole from Maria; Steve was sure Maria's precious 'Lily' will make a great addition to his cemetery, and this time Steve was sure Tony would like the honor of being the one to bury that pest alive… or they could keep it as a pet after it raised from the grave? It all depends really.
Steve raised his head to look at Bruce with a tired, so tired eyes and he sighed, and before Steve knew it he start telling Bruce everything, about what he felt when he saved Tony, about his son, about what Maria told him about what Tony did, and that even then he didn't know what to do, about Tony's nightmares and what happened next, and about what the doctors did when they entered the room, and how wrong it was seeing them pull the mother away from the pup, all of that and Bruce was listening with rapid attention, in their three hours long talk, Bruce had brought him tea from time to time, trying to comfort Steve who was going to start crying or screaming any minute now.
"You know, I have a friend in the military, I can force him to do a little tinkering about your precious Sargent, after all, only the best for my BFF." Natasha gave a predatory grin, causing Steve to snort and put a spoonful of ice cream in his mouth before he starts laughing at the expression on her face.
"I am thankful that you though fast, and went to Dr. Banner, the man is a good doctor, the only one Master Anthony felt comfortable being around." Jarvis said which made the Alpha smile a little at that.
"I'm so sorry, it's my fault; it's all my fault that you and Peter are here, I'm so sorry." Tony's voice cracked as he whispered these words, sobs were trapped in his throat choking him, refusing to leave his mouth. Tears were sliding down Tony's face, leaving a harsh trial of wetness that burned Tony's soul. "I'm so sorry…" Tony let out a shuddered breath, letting out an exhale that ended up with a sob.
"It was found in the treasure room, hidden in a secret room." Steven's breath hitched at that, years of trying to search for his Shield and his weapon was under his nose all along, how humiliating… though, Steven couldn't help but swallow, wondering in the back of his mind about the price the Alpha in front of him wanted for the Shield. "I want nothing in exchange for this gift, only the hope of starting once again." The Alpha said, causing Steven to press his lips tightly as he swallowed, his eyes misting as he continued to gaze at the Shield.
To make the matters worse, there was still the enormous problem in the shape of Anton
"What's your name?" Rogers asked when his eyes fell on the inventor taking a step after step towards Tony, and the brunette wondered why he didn't already back away like his life depended on it, but as always Tony was stubborn as hell, so he stood his ground and glared into Rogers' eyes, which apparently was a mistake, because the man's eyes shined at that, and unfortunately Tony couldn't see the rest of his face curtesy of the Winter Soldier mask that hide the rest of the blond's face that the man didn't seem to want to take off.
"Tony listens to me, your pup is fine, he is sleeping in the other room, your baby is fine." Steve crooned making Tony look at Steve with disbelieve.
"Edith, please call me by my name," Steve said which made everyone turn toward eyeing the man in confusion but Steve didn't answer their silent question he was just looking tiredly at his hands, ignoring Peggy's concern and knowing look, she always seemed to catch on everything faster than a human being.
"Tony…" Howard gave a small smile holding a present box in his hands, the older Alpha looked tired, so tired, like he aged a hundred years old since the last time tony saw him, he doesn't look like the sixty years old man that he was, Tony can see his older man shift uncomfortably, probably didn't know how to act around him, he can also see the self-conscious smile, and the tiredness in his eyes made Tony's heart give a painful pang. "My flight was delayed, sorry for coming late." Howard offered as an olive branch, his smile slipping when he noticed Tony's shocked face, and he probably took it for something else if the distressed look in his eyes was anything to go by. "I was late, wasn't I?" Howard asked in a small voice, which snapped Tony out of his shock.
Anton let out a tired sigh, gazing at the sky counting how much time he had before he forces himself back into civilization and back into being a king once more; seeing that he had a few more hours before the sun left the sky. Anton decided to go deep into the woods near the mountainside. Unknowing to many who won't usually brave the forest as much as Anton; there was a lake not an hour from his home. It was a beautiful place to be in, a relaxing one when Anton want it to be; if he went now, he was sure that he can take a dip in the lake and enjoy himself, maybe the cold water would wake him up from this nightmare. Wistful thinking on Anton's part, he knew. (1)
"Does the cell have torture instruments? Spiders? Dried blood? Human organs?" Barnes asked desperately as he looked at the commander with wide pleading eyes, and Tony just opened his mouth and closed it while blinking his eyes, wondering if he went into a parallel universe and now he was in the Twilight Zone.
"Then I suggest that you get your shit together, I tried to explain to Steve what happened but that punk refuses to hear the whole story, though I did tell him enough that he will be intrigued and let you explain." Bucky said as he put his phone in his pocket, which made Tony swallow as hope to start blooming in his chest.
In the end, Tony just gave Howard a soft smile and opened the door for him. "No, you came just in time, please come inside, I want you to meet Steve." Tony said, happiness bubbling inside of him and he has to try hard to stop himself from crying, Tony took his Dad's hand in his and gave it a little squeeze, reassuring him that everything was alright…
"Do not think highly of yourself, foolish king." The Omega hissed which made the Alpha scowl at that and take a threatening step forward which did nothing but make the Omega glare harder at them. "Me for their freedom, all of them, old, young, and babes." Steven said which made the Alpha pause and raise his brow at that looking at the Omega like he was looking at a strange being, not from their world.
Steve smiled at the Omega, lowering himself to whisper the name in Tony's ear, which caused the Omega's eyes to widen and for him to let out a happy sob, throwing himself in Steve's arms as he shook, his tears that he desperately held into start sliding down his face, but he took comfort in the way his Alpha held him in his arms and start rocking him gently. "You are an amazing Mom, Tony, never think otherwise." Steve whispered in the Omega's ears getting a choked sob from the said Omega as he nodded his head, it was a few minutes later that Tony returned to the album, drying his tears as he starts going through the pictures.
"My, my, where were you hiding?" Steve asked after the barber was done with Bucky, his words caused the Alpha to flush in embarrassment, now without the beard and long hair, Steve was finally able to see Bucky's face, and he had to say, the Alpha was handsome; the kind of handsome Steve would have tapped if he wasn't already married and pregnant, though he was 100% sure was going to keep that thought to himself, he doesn't need a jealous mate to start a fight with his poor antisocial brother.
Once there Steve rushed to make coffee, knowing that caffeine helps, and hoping that it will help the brunt after he woke up from his light doze. The Omega paused a little wondering if he should make a cold or hot compress, then, in the end, he stilled on making both, hot compress, to relax the man's muscles, while the cold one to dull the pain, already knowing that the man was hurting more than Steve can imagine, considering that the Omega found him writhing on the floor.
Rogers did nothing but stayed quiet, seemingly to get closer and closer until he was in front of Tony, his cold freezing hands, holding Tony's face in them. "
Tony would have continued to believe in that, he would have forced himself to believe in it too if it wasn't for the next two… surprises he received. The kind of surprises that made Tony presses his lips tightly together, either to surpass his horror or laugh like a manic at the sight of. Needless to say, that week, Tony didn't feel bored at all.
in the air.
baby, so it's alright." Bucky cooed, one of his hands fell on Steve's belly causing the Omega's heart to nearly stop at that. "It's alright, once we go home everything will be alright… you don't have to fear anything anymore." Steve's breath hitched as he finally lost it and let out a sob, shaking all the while until Bucky turned him around to face him. "Shhh, don't cry sweetheart, everything is going to be fine." Bucky hummed, wiping Steve's tears away, causing Steve to sniffle before biting his lower lips hard.
"I am sorry, my name is Steven Rogers, I don't know how I can say that without laughing, but I am from the future, well, a different future." Steven said with a serious face which caused Jarvis to blink and put the grocery on one of the kitchen counters before returning his face to Steven, and the blond could see how hard the brunet was trying to hold his laughter.
By the time everyone sits a foot inside of the Stark's mansion half an hour had passed, entering the house, Tony let out a small sigh followed by a small gasp as he put his pup down and start looking around his house, swallowing as the nostalgia become too much… his home had change… the furniture changed… everything changed… it made Tony stunned as he looked around the place wondering if his room was still the same or it too has changed.
"I don't know, I don't care, but don't try to turn into my enemy." Steven hissed, his grin widening when Thor took a step backward, his eyes calculating Steven, shifting uncomfortably by the sinister stare. "You can say; I'm the darkness that lurks within…" Steven left it at that and rolled his eyes when the rest of the Avengers shifted in their places. "Don't bother; your Steven will be back shortly. This time I was generous to return this body to him; next time, don't expect such generosity." With a scoff, Steven closes his eyes and collapsed on the wall behind him, when five minutes passed and Steven didn't wake up everyone surged toward him, though Rogers only goal was moving toward Bucky, drawing him into his chest, gripping him securely, avoiding everyone as they crowded Steven trying to wake him up…
"Yes… Mama told… me…" Peter said slowly as he hugged the man who was shaking, he sniffed him a little and purred when he also smelled like his Mama, it made the man start crying like the woman did and hug him tightly. Peter turned to his Mama who was hugging a strange man and both of them were crying, it made Peter look around to see his Papa, but he didn't see him anywhere, there were so many people! He never saw this many people in the white room he was always in, he just saw the bad man who always comes to hurt his Mama and sometimes him if he tried to pull him away from his Mama.
Tony was so, so afraid; he was scared to death of losing the love of his life, the only person who made him feel like he was worth something, made him feel like he was good. Tony was afraid of losing his son, the boy with too much life burning in his eyes and soul, but with a weak body that tried to kill him every chance it has. Tony was afraid of being left alone, of being left alive while both his love and child are dying in front of his eyes without him being able to do anything.
" He took a step toward the Omega and his pup which made Steven hiss at the man to back away, only making the Alpha scowl.
So imagine his astonishment when he showed up in the living room only to be greeted by the sight of Tony trying to comfort the child, and failing at it badly, an unpleasant surprise indeed, both of the father and the son look close to breaking down, Tony from frustration and Peter from whatever clouding his mind. "Please! I beg of you, tell me what's wrong!" Tony grumbled, which made Steven's eyebrow twitch, resolving to take petty on the unreasonable man. Maybe he could get something out of it.
"We don't think that you are lying, Tony." It was after Peggy answered him, that Tony knew he spoke all of his thought out loud; his teary eyes turn to Peggy who gave him a motherly smile, taking a tissue from the box near her, wiping the tears from Tony's face. "We know you are not lying, I don't know what kind of nightmare that got you so shaking, Tony, but you don't have to worry, me and Bucky will make everything right once more, we promise." Peggy smiled, her soft words causing Tony to let out a sob and hide his face in Peggy's embrace, being grateful that the older woman didn't point out how her blouse was getting damp with his tears.
Steve woke up with a gasp; he sits fast and nearly fell over from nausea, but he swallowed and gaze around the place. He was in Tony's room, sleeping on the floor like he always does when he stays in Tony's room, he never slept on the bed, it was not his place… Steve sighs in relief, a peeping sound made him look up to see Dum-E peeping from above him in worry, it made Steve smile tiredly at that. "It's ok, big guy." Steve said petting Dum-E which made the robot peep once more and wheel himself toward Jarvis…
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, a little bit of sadness, fluff, and cuteness, time-skips, family bonding together, a little bit of violence, unexpected events, and short smut at the beginning! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
Steve also met a cute cat named Goose, who is revealed to be an alien Flerken… from that day on Steve gaze at every cat, he saw with suspicion… Goose, as it seems, took a huge liking to Steve, following him everywhere and rubbing herself on the older man, Dr. Lawson told him that the cat liked him and this was the first time she saw Goose acting like this toward anyone even Carol, the only person after Dr. Lawson Goose tolerate. Fury still has a sour relationship with the cat, and Steve can sympathize after all the cat ripped his left eye. Talos flinch every time the cat comes near him and when Steve picked the cat up and start scratching under her chin, every alien was stunned how the cat starts purring and nuzzling Steve… the Soldier didn't expect the cat to regurgitates the Tesseract in his hand (In such a disgusting way) it made Steve pause for a long time, and look at Howard and Peggy with a blank and dark look, making the two Alphas shift uncomfortably, in the end, it was agreed that the Tesseract will stay with Steve, guarded Goose as no one wants to go near that demon cat other than Carol and Dr. Lawson.
"I wish I can say the same..." Anton huffed, biting the inside of his cheek when Magna turned to him with wide eyes and hissed at him softly. What? It wasn't like his people weren't thinking of him as crazy, why restrain himself when he can say what he wants? He has the choice, in the end, to marry someone desirable after Tyber and his clan are to leave so why hold himself back?
Looking around him, Steve let out a sigh when he saw Bucky standing in the corner away from the cops who made it their mission to search everything top to bottom which was so unlike what Steve expected; maybe it was because his husband was a Stark? After all, Steve knew that the Stark family has many connections all around the place and won't hesitate to use them.
Tomorrow his baby will probably break his fever, and he will cry himself sick when he noticed that he got sick on Christmas day. Tomorrow if the fever didn't break it meant that Steve has to wait a few more days, weeks, for his baby to get better; it will only lead to more heartbreak when his babe noticed how long he was sick, and not even Steve will be able to calm him down.
His Omega, for the first time in Steven's life, his inner Omega was silent, it was as if it disappeared as if it was never there in the first place, and as much as it broke Steven's heart, his heart wasn't as hurt and bleeding as it was at the thought of the pup that he no longer felt inside, it made Steven open his eyes and stare at the ceiling tiredly, wondering if it was worth it, crying over a dead pup that he didn't even hold in his arms; Steven needed to put all of this unneeded emotions away, so far away until he has the time to reflect on them, until he wasn't feeling like he would scream and cry and curse the Gods because of them.
"What did you just say?" Tony hissed, leaving his cup on the counter and came to face Rogers who was looking at him with boredom in his eyes, something that scared Tony as much as it made him angry. "Am I done? Are you even listening to yourself? What's wrong with you? You are my boyfriend, it's within my right to ask about your wellbeing and question why you have been holing yourself into your room with a fucking Omega who by the way isn't me!" Tony wasn't shouting, but he might as well have been with how loud his voice was.
The rest of the day was spent with Steve in Tony's arms, his Alpha repeating that he was sorry over and over agai
"Y-you are Tony Stark…" The pup whispered as he looked at Tony hiding behind his father's legs from the embarrassment, which caused Tony to giggle at that and look at the father who had an amused look on his face.
Anton could hear Jamti's alarming cry, when the bear stood atop Anton, causing the Alpha to snarl tried to avoid the bear's teeth and claws as one of his hands went to the knife strapped to his thigh. With a practiced move, Anton managed to push the bear's head while plunging the knife in its neck, causing the bear to roar in pain, and tried to back away swiping blinding and catching Anton's tunic in his claws, ripping the front half of it, which met by another thrust of the knife. Desperate, the bear let out a whine before as it tried to back away, which did nothing but give Anton the time needed to grape his sword and thrust it in the bear's head, rending the beast dead.
"A face-changing mask! What is it made of? An advance AI? Nanotech? What material is this?" Tony's questions were answered with a chuckle which made him flush at that and looks at the mask in his hands with wonder. "I'm going to change, take the mask off, please. Wait until Peter is ready to go out to show him that trick." Tony said before giving his mask to Steve and rushed to get Peter so the two of them can change their clothes.
When he was back home; Tony shook away all the thoughts about his lucky star, deciding to call it a coincidence or hell a glitch. Then he starts making the armor, he wanted to right the wrongs he did, to sit everything right like how he promised Yinsen, but what he really wanted was something as a reminder of the warmth he felt in that desert, and he thought that the armor was it.
"Yeah, it's good to see you too, doc, and please call me Tony." Said Tony as he put the magazine down, the appointment started with Dr. Cho taking his height, weight, and checking over the tests that Tony has done period, and writing more tests for him to do, she also informed him about how she want to carry amniocentesis and that Tony should come into the clinic next week, she gave him the 'do's and 'don't's, telling him all he needed to know about his baby (Not that he needed her to tell him, after all, he spent the past month reading all the parental books his hands fell on) ending their check-up with her taking another ultrasound of the baby. Tony's heart flutters happily when he saw the baby on the screen; he told the doctor he needed six copies of the picture, after all, his friends threaten him if he didn't bring them pictures of the baby.
The king asked with amusement, a smirk taking over his face when the Omega hissed and hide the pup behind him.
Reaching his boy, Tony sat on the floor beside him before pulling Peter in his lap and holding him tightly. Tony then kissed the back of his baby's head and shushing his son when Peter starts sniffling. "Are you going to tell me what's wrong, now?" Tony asked a few minutes later, kissing Peter's head once more, ignoring how his boy wiped his nose using Tony's shirt.
"Don't make me laugh, Stane, what's there to replace if there was nothing from the start?" Tony snorted, leaning on Steve's chest with a sharp smile, taking the strength from the Alpha behind him as he grew grounded by his scent and touch. The Omega was grateful for Steve, so grateful that the Alpha didn't hesitate to give him the comfort he wanted, even after falling out not a month ago.
"Thank you…" The woman said as she took the teacup from the Omega, keeping a subtle eye on him, not believing her eyes when she saw him here when she was expecting to meet a mid-forty, someone who was going to be her lead on Dr. Erskine after all this time, she never would have thought that Steve was actually the man's grandson, but looking at the man now, at the way he acted, she can say that he was the fiery type that Erskine was and always respect when he sees it. "So Steve…" The woman could see the younger man's blue eyes rising toward her, taking her in, and deep down she wondered how she was going to break the subject. "You might not have known this, but I was actually your grandfather's friend, Dr. Erskine, he was my mentor, and I was actually hoping that you know where he is, or if that he left me any message, I know we haven't met for years, but I really wish to find him." Peggy said gentle, hoping that the young man will know where the doctor was if he was alive… and if not, she hoped that Steve will at least give her something that will help her.
No, no, this wasn't what happened last night! Steve wanted to scream at Tony, he didn't pass out just because his husband mentions alcohol, that didn't happen. His husband returned home drunk, he was drunk and he made a pass at him and Bucky tried to stop him and the two of them fought. Yes, that was it. None of what Tony said was true, even if it somehow explained how Tony didn't sport the broken nose and black eye that Bucky gave him. Steve suddenly stood up, causing Tony to give a distress noise and stand after him, but Steve ignored him even when he felt faint all of sudden, he had to go and find Bucky, the other Alpha was with him last night, he will confirm what happened last night, he will tell him if Tony was lying to him, and Steve swears if Tony was lying, Steve was going to divorce him on the spot. "Bucky!" Steve called out happily when he saw the man in the kitchen sitting on the breakfast island, staring at the cup of coffee in his hands.
"Good, it's a dull party, but all good!" Tony grinned as he raised his champagne flute, causing Steven to frown as he took the drink from the younger man. He gave a narrow look that shut Tony up when he was about to protest, which made Tony pout like five year old.
"You are leaving?" Hearing Steve's voice, made the Avengers flinch and turn their gaze to Steve; the star was shuffling sleepily to the Avengers. It was strange, seeing Steve awake before sunset, especially when there are still three hours until the moon and stars grace them with their presence. Everyone shuffled gazing at one another before turning their gaze to Steve who let out a tired yawn and looks at the sky with an amusing look.
." Tony explained, throwing Steve's words back at him, he actually prefers the first version Steve told him, it wasn't only original, but it was said with real feelings, instead of these instructions that Rogers seemed to follow just to gain his favor, Tony can see how Rogers' eyes sparkled, he was probably happy that Tony remembered his confession. "Look Rogers, this is sad, even for you this is so sad, how can you even accept changing who you truly are for a stranger?" Tony asked, wondering that the man will say next.
So here Tony was fighting Loki, unfortunately, he wasn't able to corner Loki alone and ask of him to break Rogers' spell, considering that the man wanted to do nothing but to kill Tony as he seemed to target the brunette even after Tony screamed at the crazy man to stop, but as always no one listens to him. Rogers though seemed to be enraged, especially when Tony didn't pay the man any attention, but spent all of his time trying to dodge Loki's attacks that wanted to cut him in half, and Rogers' face became dark as time pass and Tony didn't care to even give him an annoyed glance.
"I came to apologize for what I did… and for what Bucky said; he can be a little… overprotective." Rogers said which made Tony blink and raise his eyebrow at the man, not believing that the man would say something like that. Was Rogers blind to how Bucky was practically salivating every time he came down for breakfast?
The sight before Anton made the Alpha freeze in his place with his hands on his pants; mortification took over him when he saw the person who was taking a dip in the water. The pale scared back was facing him, causing Anton to blink in curiosity at the scars that came in many different size and shapes, some of them Anton knew was caused by intense torture, while others left Anton confused about what kind of tool would cause it; long blond hair was gathered in the Omega's hands as the Omega ran his hand through it. Part of Anton was wondering if he could make a fast retreat without the person in the water seeing him, hoping to save his face and not be label as the unsavory predator the person swimming in the lake always labeled him as. "…You finally got out of the tree line…" The bored voice snapped him from his freezing state, causing his eyes to rise from the scarred chest, only to be caught by dark blue eyes that froze him like a predator cornering its prey; it was then that Anton realized he was the prey in this situation. "You know… I thought you were nothing but a peeping boy who entered his Alpha-hood… who knew the person who was peeping on me was the king himself." The mocking smile Anton was met with made him flush, in anger or embarrassment, Anton doesn't even know anymore.
"So you finally showed your face…" Steve hissed like an angry dragon making Tony wince and back away a little and no one would blame him really, after all, Steve was scary as fuck when the Omega wanted to be. "What are you doing here Stark?" Steve snarled which made the Alpha tense and open his mouth to explain but to his horror, words refused to leave his mouth and that by itself caused Tony to choke and nearly start crying right here and there.
Walking down Steven tense when his eyes fell on the king who was sitting near the fire pit, gazing at the fire with a thoughtful look on his face, and Steven wondered what he is to do, should he go back to his room, or should he walk in like nothing has changed when in fact everything has changed in the span of a few minutes.
"Steven… she is not the same person from your universe…" Peggy said in a quiet voice that was only meant for Steven's ears, and the blond man blinked then hummed at that, still not taking his eyes off of the woman, taking her in with narrow eyes, raising his eyebrow when he saw a wedding ring on her finger.
"Yeah…" Tony breathed. It's not fair that Steve can still string together complete sentences while Tony was turned into a bubbly mess, but at least his Alpha was finally getting it. "Yeah, need you to knot me, Alpha, need it in me, come
Steve looked at the sobbing Omega with a lost expression, he doesn't know what to do when he came from the pup's room only to see the Omega start thrashing and crying out, and when the Omega starts screaming which attract the attention of everyone that was sleeping. Steve tried to calm the Omega gently, only for the Omega to start crying and begging to see his pup. Steve swallow at that and gaze at Howard who was looking as lost as Steve felt, but one look at Jarvis who stopped the doctors that rushed, made Steve nod in determination. "Shh, it's OK, Tony we are going to go and see the pup, just calm down." Steve crooned; making the Omega let a sob at that.
Today was a really good day; Steve woke up with Tony remembering him (it still befalls him how they were in 2050 and still, there was no curse for Alzheimer) remembering their marriage and was thinking that they were on their honeymoon, it made Steve happy. They ate their breakfast, all the while they were laughing and sharing old stories, taking a walk in the gardens after, Tony told him that he was going to work in the labs until Steve is back from Shield, Steve made sure to order Friday to keep an eye on him and close all the labs, as Peter was out of the town with his wife MJ and their kids May and Benjamin, so he couldn't ask the young man to stay with Tony as he usually does.
"Why thank you for having so little faith in me, Tony." Steve answered in a sarcastic tone, giving Tony a mocking glare, causing the man to laugh nervously. "You know, I have been alive for nearly three thousand years, I saw things that your stomachs can't handle, even being the heroes that you are, and you think that a horror movie will put me off?" All of the Avengers' eyes were wide as they gazed at Steve who was pouting, looking toward Thor, the quilty look on his face informed everyone that Thor informed Steve of the first time he watched a movie.
Waking up the next day, Tony sighed happily as he snuggled with his baby, which made the pup give a broken purr and a sleepy yawn which made a sleepy smile take over Tony's face. God, how Tony didn't want to get up today, he just want to stay in bed and snuggle with his baby all day long, he felt a purring come from behind him, which made Tony blink at that and turn behind him to see the small Flerken looking at Tony with her tail swishing back and forth, making Tony blink at that.
Tony bite his lower lip to stop his smile from getting wider it was like a dream come true, an amazing dream at that; slowly not wanting to be left out, Tony's hand trail on Steve's waist, his hand trailing toward his mark there, already planning how he will make Steve scream and moan in pleasure. Just when Tony thought that everything was going as planned and that he and Steve will enjoy a pleasurable morning, the door to his bedroom slammed opened followed by Peter's cheerful voice which made the two adults freeze; horror coloring both Steve and Tony's features as they realized that Peter came earlier than they have thought, both of them had thought he will stay with Bruce until noon when Tony was going to collect him.
"Crap you are going to make me cry." Steve said as he let out a laugh after he let go of May, which got him a happy grin from the woman as she winked at him, which made him chuckle a little at that and shake his head a smile taking over his face as he hugged Peter when the pup latched into his legs smiling happily.
Tony thought to himself. "But I already have an Alpha." He said offhandedly making the dining hall became silent.
Tony flushed at Steven's words, he was feeling annoyed and embarrassed by them, but at the same time he was grateful for the man, because of him, his mind was taken off Rogers who he hoped will rot in hell. "How dare you? I have a very normal height, you are the ones who are giants and abnormal!" Tony growled in mock anger as he crossed his arms trying to ignore the laugh that wanted to make itself known.
And yup, Steve is the boss! Even Tony admits that in the Avengers ;p
He said coldly at them, and they stared in disbelief at him for a second, but the redhead soon was snapping at them to do whatever they had been told to do. Steven watched wordlessly as they marched towards the castle servants and ushered them out of the throne room. They whimpered and hugged each other, some feebly resisted, but they all were crying out for Steven and Margaret even begged them to grant the queen mercy for he didn't do anything, that made the king raise his eyebrow and look at the queen with a raised brow.
Longing took hold of Steve's heart and squeezed tightly, and his throat closed as he took in the kids as they laughed, cried, and screamed. Just a month… just a month and Steve was going to be a parent of a beautiful girl, a month before he can hold his baby in his arms, kissing her forehead and telling her that he loves her daily as he held her close to his chest… just one more month… Steve lost his chance though; he lost his chance, lost his home, and definitely lost his sanity. It was so not fair… so not fair that Steve had to be the one who lost his baby and suffered for it while Bucky got to walk free without punishment and without someone believing in Steve's words no matter how much he sower Bucky was the reason he was here.
When one of his hands finally moved, Steve nearly shouted in victory, after a long time and finally, his hand was moving! Too slow to his liking, Steve managed to move his hand to his stomach, panting as he did that. The sensation that greeted Steve made him pause; trying to make sense of it before he lost his mind, because surely, what he was feeling was not right at all, right?
Don't get Anton wrong, he was happy that his son was finally making friends and enjoying his boyhood, in a village that wasn't very acceptant of him; it's just, Anton wanted his son to at least spend some time with him to talk about the exciting adventures his boy went through in his exploring. It wasn't that Petrus didn't show in the workshop every Fredag so the two of them could talk about their week, it was just his son was too distracted to even focus on him. (2)
When Tony finally reached the villa that his supposed parents lived in, Tony only paused for a second when he saw Steve sitting on the hood of a blue Alpine A110 playing with a black cat; part of Tony was wondering how Steve managed to reach this place in two hours, when a normal flight is 11 hours, not to forget an extra two hours in the airport, another part of Tony only let out a tired sigh and ignored Steve who was waving at Tony happily like the crazy person he was.
"Tony's new doctor…" Steve said with a smile, taking a dark pleasure in the way that some of those awful doctors got what they deserved.
It will get much, much worse…
If Steven thought the others had a presence, then he knew absolutely nothing. This man's presence was so overpowering he silenced the entire room in a way that if a needle fell, Steven would be able to hear it hitting the ground. His expression was solemn, unconcerned, and his dark brown eyes scanned the occupants in the room in such a thorough way that Steven felt himself shiver in fear. His hair was dark that was painted red, from blood maybe; his hair was shorter than the red hair but longer than the blond, and with fewer braids, which allowed it to fall freely against his red and golden armored shoulders with a grace nobody would expect from a Viking. He had a full beard, differently from his other male companions whose beards were thinner. There was a strange symbol in the middle of his chest armor, which was clearly the work of a highly-skilled smith if the intricate details in the metal were any indication. It looked sturdy, almost… impenetrable, and Steven couldn't help but to be impressed because it reminds him of his home and a vow that was long forgotten.
"You can't be too sure Winnie; I thought you will stop your stupid matchmaking after graduating college." Sarah said which got a snort from her friend, and a soft glare from the other Alpha, but Sarah didn't notice that as she watched in shock as Peter called out to Tony to save him from his father's tickling assault, it was strange how the pup attached himself to a stranger he didn't know about, and an Omega stranger at that.
When Tony reached the gym he blinked his eyes when he saw Thor sitting in the corner while hugging his knees, rocking himself back and forth while sucking his thumb as he sniffled, letting out whimpers now and then as he shook in his place… how the mighty have fallen… the rest of his teammates were surrounding Thor, trying to snap the whimpering man out of it, but the thing is, when Bruce pulled the man's thumb away, he was greeted by an ear-piercing scream, that caused Bruce to jump back and for Clint to return Thor's thumb in his mouth, which seemed to shut the man up.
"Vacation? Your note didn't mention a vacation, Tony." Steve stated in confusion, causing Tony to blink his eyes and look at Steve like he was crazy, something that made Steve shift uncomfortably on top of Tony. "Tony, the note you left for me in the car didn't say anything about a vacation." Steve said as he sat up, the drowsiness leaving him causing him to become wide awake.
Steve was really excited about the idea of going with Tony and Peter to the park, he really wanted to go with the two of them and enjoy his time with them, he really wanted that; playing with Peter and Tony in the park, seeing their world when the sun paints it with its light, enjoy the morning breeze and the flowers and the laugh and happiness that will follow.
"Tony Stark, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist," Tony said while he tried to smile his egoistic and fearless smile but he was sure that whatever confident smile he tried to paste on his face was nothing but a grimace as he took in Rogers, who hummed.
"And what do you know about torture!" Barnes snapped as he sniffled and wiped his tears away trying to be as manly as he could while letting out pitiful whimpers when another video of Rogers being sprinkled with Holy Water appeared. "Look at what those monsters did! They gave him a Malibu Barbie!" A fresh wave of tears started leaving Barnes as he sobbed and repeated the word 'monsters' over and over again. Honestly, Tony didn't even know if there were hidden cameras somewhere and he was the victim of it… God, he should have never left his bed this morning…
Steve – Stefán Róaldr:
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, angst, sadness, violence, panic attacks, mention of cheating, character's death, and poor Stevie! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
It was then that he saw it, his lucky star, the star he fell in love with when he caught its first shine; he gazed up and saw the faint shining that reminded him of the Reactor that was in his chest, he gazed at the star and his breath hitched and he felt warmth surrounding him, banishing the freezing coldness he felt not a few seconds ago, he remembered whispering these words, a foreign words he never before used to describe anyone or anything before, 'My Lucky Star' he remembered that he breathed those words as he raised his hands in the foolish hope of reaching the skis and touching the star.
The next two hours passed quickly, they were the fastest but at the same time, they were the slowest two hours of Tony's life. Sarah and Howard arrived at their home, Howard an hour before Sarah; both of them were excited and nervous at the same time. At first, when Tony told his father about the adoption, his father had looked confused, he looked like he wanted to open his mouth and argue with Tony about it being too much, about Tony already having a step-son so there is no need for another; Tony saw many emotions in his father eyes, emotions that made Tony fidget in his place and wait for his father to start speaking. In the end, Howard ended up sighing and looking at Tony, only asking him one question,
Steve gasp as he finally reached the hospital, getting out of the car while Bucky was still parking, ignoring the Alpha's shouts for him to look out as an ambulance rushed in front of Steve making him freeze until the car passed him before he continued his run, ignoring how his friend was ordering him to calm down and stop before a car hit him this time. And how can Steve calm down when his husband was in the hospital?
"I thought I made it clear that you are not welcomed into my property," Tony stated, holding into his daughter tightly, his action making his daughter become as quiet as a mouse as she took in the strange man and woman in front of her. Part of Tony was still displeased that Peggy and Bucky showed themselves after all these months, wondering what they wanted now of all times, another part of Tony, the part he buried deep, gave a sad pang as his eyes fell on the two people he considered a family.
"What a pitiful sight..." Someone hummed behind Tony, causing him to tense at the unfamiliar voice, Tony's eyes widen, even more, followed by the Avengers who jumped from their chairs, their eyes widen in confusion and fear, not knowing how this strange man managed to get inside and how Jarvis didn't blare the security alarms.
"C-can we go… I mean, if you don't mind, can we repeat this day again… soon?" Bucky asked shyly, and a smile couldn't help but make itself known on Steve's face, the Alpha was so cute! He was so shy, he probably still feel out of place, the poor man, spent all of his life in the military and the only friends he has are still overseas serving, Steve was probably his only friend if you didn't count his family; Steve can somehow understand why Bucky was so shy.
This was insane, this was crazy… Tony chanted as he held Morgan tightly in his arms shivering as he shushed his baby, trying to calm her down; trying to calm her cries down. This was crazy, no, it was unbelievable, Tony didn't see a ghost, he didn't see a ghost of someone who died thirty years ago; it can't be! Tony choked on his sob, wiping his tears away before dragging the blanket he always kept in the boat and covering Morgan with it, shushing her down until her cries ceased…
son ended up paying, not to forget that you are rarely home to take care of your pup, I think that we both know that by the end of the year the Child Services would have ended up knocking on your door and taking the pup away, I'm doing you a favor and taking the custody of the child from your hands because apparently my foolish son became attached to your pup, don't worry I will pay you for your time." Howard's words made the room became dead silent as everyone was looking at the Alpha with a shocked look.
Nicolaus paused at the question, causing Steven to clench his fists tightly as he looked at the tree…
It ends with the Omega and pup falling asleep on Steve. The Alpha looked up at the ceiling humming to himself, the pup was snuggling to his chest, while the Omega was hiding his face in Steve's neck, soft puffs of air was tickling Steve making the Alpha stop himself from squirming last he woke the two up, even though his legs had fallen asleep because of the companied weight of the Omega and his child, he didn't dare to move, he just looked up when the door was opened nodding his head when he saw Jarvis entering the room.
"If what said is true, then you should have known a very important thing when you came here." Tony stopped in his place, his teary gaze sit at the lake as he plea over and over that it will save him, that whatever is in there will take pity on him and save his baby. "You should have known that new people aren't welcome here, especially in this lake." Tony shakes when he felt the gun at the back of his neck, but he didn't move even with the threatening step Stane took toward him.
"I decided to become normal." The smile on Steve's face became bigger, but the discomfort hidden so deep in his eyes increased, and Tony had to give it to Steve, the man was a great actor, Tony was sure he would have fooled anyone if he pulled this one on them, but unfortunately for Rogers (Steve, he deserved to be called Steve after what Tony did last night) Tony was an actor too, and he can detect the signs of pain hiding behind careless smiles and gestures, he practically invented that technic!
! I brought you dinner from your favorite place!" Steve's cheerful voice made Tony squeak and dove under the table once more, trying to hide from Rogers who seemed to waltz inside the workshop without needing permission from Tony. "Oh, who are you?" Rogers asked when his eyes fell on Rhodey, Tony's eyes widen when he saw Rhodey tilt his head when his eyes fell on Rogers, and dread filled him when Rhodey stood up to give his hand to Rogers in a handshake.
"Is she?" Tony asked, tightening his hold on Morgan even if he said these words; Tony promised, he promised that even if the truth was going to come out, this baby was always going to be his Morgan no matter who were her real parents. "Her eyes… they are blue… no one in my family or her rapist of a father has blue eyes," Tony said through gritted teeth, his hands shaking as he saw the wide eyes that gazed at him with shock, even confusion was there in the mix.
"He was… he was Tony's fiancé…" Rhodey said after a while trying to get his thought back together, his mind going into overdrive trying to remember everything Tony told him about the small Omega, the declaration seemed to stun Maria as she had to take a seat or she will fall. "He met him in 1998… Tony was so in love with him… used to talk my ear off about him…" Rhodey said clearing his throat as he felt a lump preventing him from talking.
"Idiot…" Steve murmured, trying not to wince by his scratchy voice, he just tried to clear his throat as best as he can and swallow some saliva, trying to moisture his throat. A smile twitched over Steve's lips when he saw Tony nuzzle his head in Steve's hand; a groan of annoyance left Tony as he let out a yawn. Tony's grumbling informed Steve that he was going to wake up any minute now, causing Steve to feel his heart speeding up at the possibility of seeing his Alpha after what seemed like a long time…
" He growled glaring darkly at Steven. "
Steve didn't know how long he stood in the living room, but in the end, his legs gave up and he fell on his knees, Steve wonder's in the back of his mind if he was having an asthma attack when his vision became blurry, but the wet feeling on his cheeks told him that he was crying, he raised his head to look at the ID card that was lying a few feet away from Steve, and the Omega had to bite his lips to stop them for letting the sobs out…
Steve carefully pulled out and Tony collapsed on his chest, panting heavily like he ran a marathon, a purr leaving his chest before raising his eyes to gaze at Steve's, possessiveness and lust shining in them; Tony dragged a possessive hand over Steve's chest. "Mine, my Alpha," Tony growled and Steve couldn't help but agree.
"So you are the Scarlet Witch?" Nebula stated more than asked, distaste coloring both her voice and features, sidestepping the table that was thrown at her by the enrage witch that was glaring and growling like a while beast; truly a pitiful sight, Nebula wondered what Thanos saw in this weak female that he demanded Nebula to recruit her, it was probably because she performed a forbidden spell thought to be forgotten to turn the Golden Bride into a human, even if temporarily.
"Are you here to eat at one of Brooklyn's best sweets too?" Tony asked, changing the subject as to not clue Harley on what he had discovered; Harley looked confused for a second before nodding his head fast, probably thinking that he took the easy way out and that he was going to run away that he has finally satisfied Tony's curiosity. "Great! Me too! What do you think about us doing that together? I still have to bring a few cheesecakes and ice-cream sandwiches home or Peter will throw a fit." Tony started talking a mile a minute to distract Harley.
Luck seemed to be on his side when he saw the man once more, he was older than the last time he saw him, instead of being a young man in his prime, he was clearly old, old enough to have children and for them to be out of his house, that was the first time the star was shocked because it was then that he realized how fleeting Midgardian's lives were.
"Very well…" Steven said as he stood up, planning on leaving, not wanting to see Pepper's face, hating to see the woman that destroyed his husband's life more than Steven imagine she would.
It took a long time in Steve’s opinion, a long time until he was able to convince the police to let his baby go and rest from the shock, promising that he will answer all of their questions; May, God bless her, took Peter inside her house, letting the small boy sleep in her bed, the poor boy had passed out after he cried himself in May and Steve’s arms. Even with all the chaos and the being stuck in an ambulance car until his wounds were treated, or when the police start asking him about how he knew Brock Rumlow, who turned out to be an FBI agent, or when the news stations and reporters arrived to question Howard Stark on why he was here, even when he wanted to punch a few reporters for even daring to accuse and question him about being Howard’s mistress; Steve didn’t take his eyes away from Howard, he was already shaky, tired, and on his last nerve, he didn’t take his eyes off his lover’s father, he still remembers how the two of them parted a month or so ago, with him breaking the man’s nose.
Three days, that was how long Tony had locked himself in his labs without allowing anyone to come inside, blasting AC/DC music as loud as he could so that no one could come near the labs without getting a headache. Three days with Steve trying to take care of Peter, telling him that
"Aw, don't be like that, love!" Steve cooed, causing Tony to growl and turn to the man, planning on giving Steve a few hits on the head, maybe that will give Steve his mind back; Tony wondered how Rogers survived the forties with that kind of attitude, didn't they use to burn witches alive in those times?
