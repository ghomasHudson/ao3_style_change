“Probably more often than it should be,” Steve admits.
James looks like he’s about to respond, then tilts his head slightly to the right.  Listening.
(I keep waiting for my poetry to get better and it just doesn't.  I hope you liked this chapter, though!  It's such a big turning point and for me, that's exciting!)
“Here, I’ll tear it in half and we’ll split it,” Bruce says.
“We can talk as much as you want,” Steve assures him. “I mean, I’m sure it’d be good for me, too. It’s not something that comes naturally. So where do you want to start?”
“Another dead end?” Steve asks.
Steve pulls his shirt off, too, and groans with the effort of moving his arms.  He has never been so sore without a building collapsing on him first.
“No. No, I’m fine,” Tony says.  “I’m not that into sweets.”
Bruce notes the signs of alarm James is giving off. His eyes are slightly wide and his muscles are tense. Either because Bruce has seen this a few times now, or because James seems a little less murderous, the Other Guy doesn’t stir.
“Any time,” she says.
“So this sucks,” Tony announces.  “In case anyone was curious.”
“I have found somewhere that meets your requirements.  I’m sending you the information now,” Jarvis says.
Tony stares at the paper and then back up at Steve. “Dum-E did this?”
Tony knows by Bruce’s daydreamy stare that his brain is already off and running in science-land.  If it weren’t for the very real consequences of failure, this would be the most destructive fun either of them have had in a long time.
“Absolutely not,” Bucky says.  “We didn’t invite you out for your money, Stark.”
James is dying and there’s nothing Bruce can do about it.
makes me happy, my fam!
“You didn’t have to step in,” Steve says, assuming Clint did so because he was worried Steve was going to throw Rumlow through the nearest brick wall.  “I’ve already figured out I can’t punch every asshole who’s got something bad to say about my boyfriend.  That would involve a bus tour across America and I don’t have the time.
“Damn it!” Clint shouts.
“Tony?” Steve asks.
Tony braces himself for awkwardness, but now that they’re all in one spot facing each other, conversation comes easy.
Any reply Tony has is interrupted by a flurry of loud barks from Clint’s phone alerting him texts have come in.  Clint’s face lights up.
“Yeah, of course,” Steve says. “Always.”
“It’s like I bought you at Wal-Mart,” Tony accuses. “Think if I box you up they’ll give me my money back?”
“That’s putting it mildly,” Tony says.  “But if Barton could do it for her--”
For a few seconds Steve thinks she’s serious.  And then she smirks.  Clint actually looks a little disappointed when he realizes she’s teasing.
It doesn’t really matter-- it will take too long. James will die before Bruce gets him to an operating table, and honestly he has no clue where he’d even start. Bruce is watching blood ebb and flow and leak in the hologram. It pools around a twisted, jumble of metal and wires and tech. What isn’t obviously man-made is being compromised by a healing ability that’s repairing what it can in all the wrong ways.
“Stark has plenty of valid reasons not to trust me,” Natasha says.  “But he ought to be nicer to you,” she directs to Steve.  “You,” she adds, nodding toward Clint with a bright smile, “are your own bag of dicks.  No one needs to be nice to you.”
It takes Steve a few seconds to turn feelings into vocabulary, and then to get his mouth around the words. “I want us to be honest with each other. I... um... I want to treat you the way I’ve always wanted to see you treated. I want to support you. I want to take you to bed and show you how beautiful I think every inch of you is. I want to spend whole days in your workshop, listening to you explain whatever it is you’re doing in there. I want to find a breakfast restaurant that we both like, and I want to never try another Egg McMuffin again. I’m sorry, those things are like rubber vomit, seriously. That was off track, I know. This is just... hard.”
“That’s my girl!” Rhodey calls from off the ice.
“He was charming,” he begins hesitantly.  “Lively.  A chatterbox is what my ma used to call him.  And he was good.  Just a good person.  He had this way of looking at the world-- like he didn’t see it for what it was, but like he could see it for what it was going to be.  Like he could see
“Sirs,” JARVIS interrupts, within a few seconds of when the scan ends. “I have information on James’s brain scan I believe you will want to see immediately. I can forward it to the screens here, but the most accurate representation would be in 3D. If you are willing to step outside, the Quinjet’s holo-field would prove most informative.”
“Is this even considered the boondocks, or was that like twenty miles back the other direction?” Clint asks.
Clint nods. “Then I’m gonna shut my eyes for a few. Wake me up if you need me.”
Tony flips his phone toward them.  It begins to show a live video feed of Justin Hammer, starting  a speech at the HammerTech headquarters, and he’s speaking to a huge group of assembled investors and press. As fortune would have it, it’s a building less than five miles away from the server farm they just raided and it can’t be all that far from where Nat has them now.
“I could have killed you,” James says, but he doesn’t sound miserable about it this time. Mostly just surprised.
“You think I climbed into the sandbox to sabotage your efforts?” Tony asks.
“Better the basket than a bullet through someone’s torso, dear,” Nanna quips.
Steve shakes his head.  Tony’s being weird.  Or, well-- not weird.  Tony’s being oddly chatty, and he’d been oddly quiet earlier, and Steve’s not stupid.  Something is up.  They’re having their anniversary dinner at the scene of their first date.  Mae won’t stop glancing in their direction.  Tony’s fidgety.
Rhodey smiles and claps Steve hard on the back.
Always.  What’s up, buttercup?
“Will you stay here tonight?” Tony asks.  It’s strange to hear Tony so plaintive.  “I don’t... I know i told you to leave but I’m not sure I’ll go if I don’t have someone...”
his great-grandfather. And I will never ever cheat on you. You know that.”
“I don’t know what sort of person I am,” James says. “Can’t stop thinking I’m a weapon. Can’t stop counting doors and windows and thinking what I could use in here to cut your throat. It’s all jumbled in my head. Louder now, maybe, since the static is gone.”
“Geez, Clint.  Give them a minute to pull up their pants,” Bucky says, pushing past his boyfriend to step out onto the patio.  “Thought we’d check on you two.  Everything good out here?”
“Ugh, nooooooo,” Tony groans.  “Whatever I said that made that face happen, I take it back.  I surrender.  I will buy you a pony.  Just stop looking so woebegone.  I’m begging you.”
“Me, too,” Bruce agrees. “James, I hope you’ll choose to stay, but if you need to go, we won’t stop you and we won’t track you.”
“It’s Saturday.  Shouldn’t you have the day off anyway?” Sam asks.
“I want Tony to come back to our place,” Steve says, in a drunk sort of pout.
“Am I going to regret this?” Tony asks.
Steve nods.  His expression is full of mischief.  “You know I’m a sure thing, right?”
“Did you learn anything interesting?” Bruce asks.
“Loves me,” Bruce interrupts. He runs his thumb over the envelope absently. “You don’t have to say it for him because he says it in here. That he loves me, and he’s sorry and that I deserved better from him.”
Clint smacks Tony’s ass insistently and this time it’s Steve who gives Clint a friendly but deliberate shove.  And just like that, the last of the worries from the trunk fall away.  These are not murderers or kidnappers or criminal masterminds.  They are Tony’s ridiculous, impossible, friends.
“I will,” Bruce says. “We all plan to keep each other alive, for as long as we’re traveling together. Try not to worry.”
“I don’t want to put him in the position of keeping a secret from Steve, so no, I don’t plan to tell him either.  At least not until you’re comfortable with Steve knowing where you are.  I can handle disappointing Captain America.”
“How is he?” Steve asks. There’s fear-- thick fear-- in his voice.
Slightly more hopeful beeps this time.  Bruce reaches out a hand to pet Dum-E’s long, metal arm, and Dum-E beeps again, cheerfully.
“Tony’ssextape,” Steve says, mumbling it out all in one word.
“Sure,” Steve agrees.  He lets Tony get secure in the car before he joins him.
Bruce is struck by the depth of James’s frustration. Either James was put on ice and left to heal when he couldn’t remember what healing felt like, or he’d been forced to endure missions while in pain. Either way, it’s yet another example of the shitty treatment he's endured for most of his life and it's left him with no understanding of physical recovery and what it entails.
“Seriously?” Clint asks.
“I’ve got your number. Are you into me?” Steve asks.
It takes Steve a second to piece together what Tony’s getting at. Living together. As a couple.
,” Tony snaps, taking several steps away from him, further into the bathroom.
The soldier’s eyes flick up. “The ones I could find.”
“JARVIS, I think that’s enough for tonight,” Steve whispers.
“You okay, doc?” Clint asks. He’s looking at Bruce like he’s checking for shades of green.
Bruce smiles at the image of Clint trying to sneak in and out of the bathtub to show up the famous Winter Soldier. It's also nice that the game is engaging James, and that seems promising.
“Stooooop,” Tony groans, biting back a smile of his own. “You’re delusional. I created a new element, you know that right? I was in like every science journal ever. Twice. If you want to be proud of something be proud of that. All I’m doing now is not drinking. Any person with an ounce of self-control can do the same. It’s not impressive.”
“Yeah. I was,” Tony agrees.
“Tony. I appreciate the gesture, but that could have disrupted SHIELD missions,” Steve says gently. “Put people at risk.”
“But I’m great in bed,” Steve says.  “You win some, you lose some.”
“You can pick it up,” Tony says. “I was pretty rough on some of this stuff when I was a kid. It was only when I got a little older that I understood how much it was worth.”
“Feels kind of like living on a roller coaster,” Tony says.
She leans in and kisses Steve on the cheek. “Ditto.”
“Oh…” Steve pauses. “Really?”
Fanart by Superfizz
They turn off down a side road and Clint gives a quiet, pained cheer.
Steve still takes on missions for SHIELD but he’s choosy now. He only leaves the country when absolutely necessary and when he’s overseas, he works fast. When he’s home, he and Tony date. They watch movies, they make pasta, they laugh. Steve accepts a $200,000 Maserati for his birthday with very little fuss. (Once Steve lays eyes on the shiny, blue sports car he’s in love.) (They’ll have to pry the keys out of his cold, dead hands.) (He’s dating a billionaire. Still not used to that.)
“Pretty sure the whole criminal underworld watching Iron Man beg to be let go while he takes it from behind would have been a threat to our credibility, if nothing else.”
me, I won’t do it again.  I didn’t realize staples counted as company property, and we waited until everyone was gone before I made projectiles out of them.  Bucky helped me clean them all up and no
He walks away from Clint’s desk to join Bruce.  Tony’s smile lasts the morning.
“Right,” Steve says.  “Of course.  Ummm... I was at a retirement party for General Carston, and there was a man that kept trying to talk to me.  His name was Justin Hammer.  I blew him off, but then one of Tony’s exes was there, too, and I could hear him talking to Hammer at the next table over.  He’s going to sell him a video.  The guy said it’s... graphic.  That Tony spends a lot of it begging to be let free...”
Tony had looked ready to get defensive.  At Steve’s words his posture relaxes slightly though the smile he gives Steve is entirely false.  Tony grabs for a bottle of the nearest alcohol and pours a shot into his smoothie.
Bruce is momentarily stunned. It’s not that he hadn’t known on some level that James trusts him, but it’s huge that James is using those words all on his own. Bruce’s insides get tight. There’s no way he’s worthy of something so hard-earned as James’s faith.
Hurtful but fair.  I bet her hair smells like gold.
“So how’d you end up in the Security Admin Department?” Tony asks.
“That would be a kilometer, dear,” Natasha says as she turns toward the men. “And I didn’t have as much to drink as the rest of you.”
“Playboy,” Tony supplies.
“Is that why you were going to let me kill you?” James asks, sounding so exasperated it’s a near wonder he’s not strangling Steve.
“Natasha, please tell me I’m not gonna have to drive a tractor to a Wal-Mart to get what we need?” Tony pleads, as their friend walks into the room.
Steve sputters a laugh as Tony derails his spiraling depression with his ridiculous sense of humor. Tony may never realize how much of a comfort he is to Steve, but this is why Steve sees them as equals. This is why Steve needs him so badly.
“That’s some real science right there,” Clint agrees. “I am always up for a game of “What Shit Can We Scan?”
“You know, when I’m the voice of reason in the whole ‘take care of yourself’ argument, you have hit some bad kind of rock bottom. Just eat the damn BannerBar. I promised your partners in crime I’d keep you fed and watered till they’re back in the states.”
“I figured, what with the free fries and the reserved table.  How’d that happen?”
“What?” Steve asks, turning around.
He doesn’t have long to look.  They’ve got a shit ton of setting up to do and they are on the clock.  The plan is to set off the explosive ten minutes after radio silence.  That gives Nanna and Kate ten minutes to get in and get into place before the guards all (hopefully) get pulled.
Tony rolls to a stop.  They’ve reached within a block of their destination and he can’t stay in the car a second longer.  He’s not entirely sure he’s in a legal parking zone.  Doesn’t matter.  JARVIS’ll take care of it.
Steve’s fantasies change.  No ropes.  No bondage.
“Then what?” Steve asks, nervously shifting the bag he’s holding from one shoulder to the other. If anyone can see through him-- if anyone can see all the fear and insecurity Steve’s feeling-- it’s Tony.
“Feel any better?” Tony asks.  He is extremely proud that his voice doesn’t crack even a little.
Tony’s got about the best forearms Steve’s ever seen.  They are attached to great looking arms in general.  Steve doesn’t have a lot of words for the way watching Tony beat at metal with a hammer warms up his insides, but he does have the memories of the few times before the ice when he had gone to his knees for men who made him feel a whole lot less. Their memories are nothing compared to this.
Bruce gets an immediate visual of Tony’s dramatic retelling of how the Winter Soldier ripped a steering wheel right out of a moving vehicle and decides to pass.
“Because I’m so cheery and untouched?” Tony asks doubtfully.
Steve gets one look at Tony’s serious expression and laughs.  “Wow.  Didn’t realize you had a high school kink.  Are you the teacher here?  Or the smart kid and I’m the football star?”
“If it will make you feel better,” Steve agrees.  “Jarvis, put them up?”
Natasha nods seriously.  “There’s a trapeze in every house he owns.”
“Kind of hard to miss,” Steve says with a grin. A dangerous grin, Tony thinks. A grin Tony wouldn’t mind waking up to. “Here, these are for you.”
Nanna laughs at their antics.  The electrical outlet gives another angry buzz.
“He’s hard-wired for stupid, you mean?”
“Are you going to talk about us or just about you?” Tony asks.
“Take a picture and you can show him tomorrow.”
Steve considers it.  “Race you to 100?”
“I’m sorry this got weird,” Steve says, as he picks up something clean from the pile and pulls it on.  “And that people are trying to kill you.”
Fucking StarkTech. Next time he’s buying a HammerPhone for the satisfying crunch it’ll make when it hits a goddamn wall.
“I’ve got a lot of people who owe me favors,” Tony says.  “Not all of them are at the bottom of the Potomac.  And no one needs to know he’s here until we’ve got some kind of deal in place.”
The continual upgrade of the medical equipment in the Quinjet is a direct reflection of just how much the thought of losing a teammate terrifies Tony.
“I’d date him,” Steve says, without being asked.
Pepper and Rhodey both seem to think this is a grand idea.
“No, but it should be.  I’m very wise.”
“That doesn’t sound fair to you,” Steve says.
Tony laughs.  “Yeah... if we’re doing the confession thing, then so do I.  Give myself points I mean.”
At least James is out of the woods.
“Come with,” Tony says.  “Show me all these tricks you allegedly taught Dum-E.”
Since Steve doesn’t say anything immediately, Tony adds, “And it really was the first painting on the list.  As soon as I saw it, I knew I could write about it.  I thought it’d be one thing about art I could get right.”
He doesn’t need to worry. Jenny’s talking on her phone now, in progressively higher pitches.
He can do this.
“As soon as any of these assholes go looking for you they’re gonna figure out you aren’t home,” Clint continues. “They’ll hack security cameras and the traffic light feeds. They’ll talk to the taxi drivers. They’re gonna know you’re at Steve’s before long.”
“Do you think she’ll like me?” Tony asks.
Steve checks to make sure Tony is out of the tower before he heads over after Bruce has left for the night.  He’s not really sure where the best interface for Jarvis is, so he ends up sitting in the Avengers conference room on the 18th floor, well after midnight, feeling a bit like a child in the principal’s office.
“See you in a bit,” Bruce says, his expression softening when he makes eye contact with Steve. Then the screen goes black.
because one, that’s not true, and two because it’s maybe a little true.  Sam’s only been around for seven weeks and Steve’s nearly gotten him killed a dozen times so he wouldn’t blame Sam if he walked. Nat can be hard to read.  The Strike team was
Tony catches Steve eyeing it enviously.
Steve looks surprised at the question.  “We’re friends.”
Tony’s fingers tremble slightly. “He did good.”
. “You’ve been tugging on it for the last ten minutes and I’m sure we could get you something that fits better if there’s a problem.  You don’t have to suffer in silence.”
I'm so sorry about the cliff hanger, but there is no where else I could possibly break up these two chapters!  The good news is, the next one is entirely written and only needs edited, so should be up next week instead of 6 months from now!  The extra good news, I don't write character death so Bucky is going to be fine.  I promise.  Only happy endings here, once they get past all this hard stuff!
That’s what Shayla had said.
The images come faster.  Rhodey gone and whatever is left in his place, blank and impassive.  Rhodey stripped of all humanity.  Rhodey with his hand around Maria’s neck.
He sighs and sits down on the couch and waits. For what, he doesn’t know. An asteroid maybe. Something quick and painless.
long since he’s had fun.
James is sitting up when Bruce enters. Clint is next to him on the bed, sleeping peacefully under the blanket.
“That’s the jist of it, yeah. That’s exactly what I’m trying to say. Poorly.  Because you
Steve feels a pang in his chest.  His own mother was a saint.  They hadn’t had much but he’d never doubted once that he was loved, safe and wanted.
“Everyone have their ear plugs?”
“For what it’s worth, I’m sorry Jonathan’s a jackass,” Steve says as he reaches for the door.
No.  All anyone in the media (or at SHIELD for that matter) seems to care about is what happens in Tony’s bed, or anywhere bed-adjacent.
So it’s unexpected and kind of awful when Tony’s sitting in his workshop, and Steve walks in uninvited and thrusts some printed papers under his face.
“Deal.”
Steve flips over his pencil to erase ‘no injuries’ from his notes.
“But it’s gonna be okay,” Clint says. “We’ve got your back.”
“You thought he’d say all that, but you still opened the letter,” Steve says gently.
“Sap.”
Tony stares at the counter in dismay.  He’s emptied nearly every cabinet in the kitchen looking for caffeine, booze, or anything similar and he’s come up dry. Barton has stocked this place with canned peas and boxed mashed potatoes and absolutely zero essentials and that is nearly criminal.
“What did he offer?” Steve asks.
Clint looks torn and then sighs. “Fine. You’re coming out on YouTube. Do you need help setting up a channel? My friend Kate’s good at that kind of thing.”
,” Tony corrects.
“As ready as I’m going to be.”
so I can pick your brain.  I could use the help for future reference.
Steve’s at the tower because he’d broken the strap on his shield during the last mission and Tony had offered to fix it.  After Rhodey’s story, Steve had figured out a new way to try and get himself back in Tony’s good graces: appeal to his stomach.
Steve gives Tony a grateful smile, and sits down on the carpet with his back against the wall.  Tony sits down next to him, their shoulders resting together.
He knows he ought to be as pissed at Tony as everyone else is.  Steve certainly hadn’t come out smelling of roses in Tony’s interviews.  They’d been scathing.  At times downright vicious.  Tony had laid bare almost as many of Steve’s secrets as he’d known.  He’d mocked Steve’s insecurities and inadequacies, his home-sickness for the past, his occasional difficulties with tech.  He’d given out Steve’s personal cell phone number on national television.  The one thing Tony hadn’t done was out him; he’d kept Steve’s sexuality to himself.  It made no sense.
“Bruce needs my help scanning James,” Tony says simply, pocketing his phone.  “He thinks there might be an engineering problem with the arm.”
Tony doesn’t respond but he does give a slightly hysterical laugh.  And then a sort of coughed sob.
“Get offffff,” Tony complains.
Steve doesn’t believe either of them are serious about dating Tony, which is why he can laugh.  Bawdy talk was a big part of life during the war.  It feels familiar.  Comforting.  Fun.  It has been
“I didn’t say that,” Tony says.
“My grandchildren are all big hockey fans. I don’t know that you two are the best role models, but they’d still want to see this.”
“I’d save him,” Tony says, not doubting himself for a minute. He looks back at Steve and the sun spots fade from his vision.  “Whatever it took.”
Steve’s looking over Tony’s shoulder and he points to some data in a box off to the side.
“Embarrassing,” Steven fills in, with a wince. “I can’t believe I just told you that.”
“I want you to feel secure,” Steve says.  “Secure that what I want from you isn’t your money.”
“But I need something from you,” Steve continues, looking toward Bucky. “A signed puck for his goddaughter. I guess she’s your biggest fan.”
Tony looks up from his food. “I texted him. I explained it wasn’t going to work out.”
Pepper, Rhodey and Steve stare at Tony who appears entirely unfazed by the news. He’s eating his breakfast and they’re all still staring so Tony lifts his hands in a sort of ‘what were you expecting’ gesture. He still has a piece of waffle speared to his fork.
“Turn on damn IceTalk,” Bucky says, making a slapping motion toward Steve to spur him into action. “They’re playing the same thing over and over.”
His words die off, and Bruce can see that James doesn’t have the vocabulary for whatever it is he wants to express next. James looks at him expectantly, as if Bruce can read minds, and Bruce chews on his bottom lip in thought. He doesn’t want to feed James emotions. If he gets them wrong, James could misidentify them for who knows how long, and Bruce really does not want to be responsible for fucking James up any worse than he is. So instead of giving any definites, he ventures a quiet guess.
Steve knows how much Bruce feels for Clint.  It’s different seeing Bruce’s emotions laid so bare.
Steve won’t talk to SHIELD without talking to Clint and Natasha first.  They meet for milkshakes on a Wednesday afternoon while Tony’s in a board meeting.  It’s no surprise when Bruce joins them as well.  He and Clint share a side and Natasha slides in next to Steve.
“Not entirely,” Tony says.  “There’s a restaurant a couple miles from here.  They’ve got the best cheeseburgers in New York.  Eat one, and the miles will have been worth it.”
Steve feels like he can breathe for the first time in days.  “Thank you, Jarvis.  I really appreciate your help.”
“I’m not here to fire you,” Tony says, shaking his head.  “I was wondering if you know where Bruce is?”
Clint invites Steve out for burgers and milkshakes the next day.  Natasha joins them, which is a nice surprise.  It had been hard to get a read on her when they’d first met, but lately she’s been welcome company.
Steve bites at the bottom of his lip and looks up at Tony with as much affection and lust as he can manage.  His hand goes to Tony’s pajama bottoms and he ghosts his fingers around where the waistband meets his skin and then he gives them a rough tug.
“He...” James starts. “The way he looked at me... I am not that person. I’m not who he thinks I am. I’m an asset. A weapon. Not Bucky Barnes.”
Tony nods.  “There’s nobody I’d trust more than Banner.  And Clint’s not half the mess he wants us to believe.”
“That would be enough to override my other protocols,” Jarvis said. “Yes.”
There’s no reply, only the sound of the shower running.
“Not entirely,” Tony says.  “Thought I’d come up here and see why this gear clamp keeps sending out error messages.  Look--”
“You’re free to leave,” Steve says with a shrug.  “What I don’t get is how you--genius, billionaire, philanthropist...”
“Now can we eat the damn egg?” Bucky demands.
New as it is, he absolutely means it.
“If it makes you feel better, my crush on you was the reason I got added to the stupid points list in the first place.  The guys kept trying to set me up on dates and I kept... pining.”
,” Tony says in horror, like a hundred horrible images flashed through his head all at once.  “Tell me you and Howard never--”
“You don’t have to send anything.  I’m sure Clint could
“I do as well,” Jarvis agrees.  “What I do know of them gives me reason to believe we had similar objectives in the prioritization of your safety and wellbeing.  I do believe I would have liked them very much.”
“Barton-- I could use some help thinning the crowd over here if you’ve got a minute,” he says into his comm.
“Fine,” Tony says. “I’m moving. Look.”
Thankfully, when Tony does reply, it’s matter of fact.  Bruce’s catastrophizing missed the mark by a mile.
“How portable is it?”
Apparently the only thing that can make Free Fry Friday more awesome than it already is, is the prospect of 12.5 shots per person from the top shelf of the bar. Tony can’t stop laughing as he watches Clint and Kate bounce up and down like excited rabbits for the whole six blocks to Lido’s.
There are times when Tony talks to Bruce in the field where every other word flies right over Steve’s head.  But when Tony’s actually taking his time and explaining something meant only for Steve, it’s crystal clear.  Tony’s a natural teacher.  And maybe more surprising, a born encourager.  He validates Steve’s questions with nods and verbal affirmations and launches into new answers, tying in everything from military history to Greek mythology to the moon landing.
Steve shakes his head. “Don’t say that. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.”
Steve stands up and walks over to the desk where Tony had pointed and grabs the form and an ink pen.  He returns and sits back down on the floor next to Tony and holds up the form so they can both look over it together.
That day when it’s time for Steve to leave, Tony takes longer to let go of their hug.
“No,” Bruce says.  “But Steve’s one of a handful.  And Tony.”
He wants to sound stern but Steve can’t keep the smile off his face. He crosses his arms in an attempt to look more offput, but he can’t even manage that much. He’s too amused.
“Well, we are,” Bucky says.  “And since you’re still alive, I’m going to say we’re pretty damn good at it.”
“You-- you know you don’t have to do this, right?” Tony asks.  “Not for the raise or for your job or for any of it?”
Steve looks at Tony, completely dumbfounded. “That’s what you thought I meant?”
“Nothing to see here, folks,” Tony says in a voice that carries across the room.  The look he’s giving Steve is murderous.  “We’ve all had too much to drink.  Time to go home.”
“So what’d you think?” Tony asks when it’s over.
When the SAD department personnel all get raises, it doesn’t feel like some sort of creepy pay-off for getting Steve in bed.
“Of my smiling face,” Clint amends.  “Definitely not my dick.”
“100 points for not shooting me,” Steve agrees, with a small smile.  “I...”
It’s organized chaos as smaller plates are passed around and cold, foaming glasses of beer, are shoved in front of each person at the table.  Conversations break out in twos or threes, and it leaves Tony and Steve to get to know each other.
Tony flies his Iron Man suit to Malibu the next day.  He doesn’t own a house there anymore so he rents a big, fancy one right on the beach.  Steve learns this from a SHIELD report.  A week later Tony throws a wild enough party to get kicked out of that house and he rents another one, this time up on the same hill where he’d once lived.  Steve learns this from Pepper.  A few days later there’s a house fire during yet another party so Tony buys himself a new place outright.  Like he plans to stay in California permanently.  Steve learns this because it is plastered across the front of The Daily Bugle.
It’s a real shame Tony won’t let Howard get within a city block of her.
“Yeahhhhhh,” Natasha says. “I’m gonna say it’s probably a good idea for us to keep an eye on you two, anyway. Bucky, you good?”
Bucky is waiting for them in a dark, beat up Impala, parked carefully out of the line of sight of any cameras. The smell of tacos hits Tony as soon as he reaches for the rear passenger door.
For more than a minute the soldier says nothing. Bruce takes that time to catalogue the soldier’s injuries. When the man lets another minute pass without an answer Bruce speaks again.
The soldier stares at the bottle of water with the same intensity he’d stared at Bruce. Bruce gets the feeling it isn’t anything personal.
“More security means people get hurt,” Tony says, cutting Steve off.  “It’s unintentional, but it happens.”
JARVIS is literally a life saver. Bruce has done some surgery in his day, but he’s never come close to what they’ve done with James. He’s not sure anyone has, except maybe the HYDRA scientists who’d butchered him in the first place. But JARVIS had calmly walked them through every step, every scan, every death-defying cut and James is still breathing on the table.
Why had he agreed to stay behind?  He could have gone.  It was his jet, his money funding all these adventures, Iron Man would be the best suited to take down Barnes if something was really wrong.  Natasha had come to him first, before she'd gone to Steve.  Tony could have at least offered to go with her.  He hadn't.
Steve makes a growly sort of huff under his breath and Tony can see that his knuckles are white where he’s gripping the paper.  Tony digs his toes into the floor and then wheels himself away from Steve a few feet.  He’s not afraid Steve will hurt him.  Steve
“Thanks?” Steve asks.
“Maybe you should get some sleep,” Bruce consoles.
“What if somethin’ else goes wrong?” James demands again.
“Stick around if you want,” Steve says.  “We’ve only been going quiet when you walk in the room because a search and rescue for the guy who killed your parents doesn’t sound like something that ought to be forced in your lap.”
“Clean breaks make for the best recoveries,” Bruce consoles instead. “There’s nothing Tony and I won’t do to make sure it heals correctly. At worst, you may need some sort of metal reinforcement on the bone, but on the bright side, you’ll probably be able to launch rockets out of your fingers when Tony’s done with you.”
Steve stays where he is, just outside the elevator and Tony gestures pointedly to his sofa.  Natasha gives Steve a nudge on the back to get him moving forward and they both sit down on the couch.
They leave the conversation there.  Clint because he ventures back into one of the bedrooms to put on some actual clothes, and Bruce because he’s worried any more talk could be construed as an outright push and that’s cruel to do to James.  He focuses on finishing his cooking, then plating up food for him and Clint.  He grabs two more beers from the fridge as Clint returns to join them.  They eat in silence.  Bruce is almost to his last bite when James speaks up.
Eventually Tony falls asleep and it’s nearly 9 when he wakes. He fully expects Steve to be gone, but he’s not. Tony smells bacon and coffee and hears voices. Two voices.
Steve does.
“I guess I should be getting used to feeling useless by now.”
Steve looks so miserable Tony only needs to consider it for a second.
“You need to get out of your own head,” Clint says. “If you don’t want to do that with smutty smut we can go to the paintball range instead.”
Tony crumples up the slip of homework paper and tosses it into the trash can by the door.  He makes the shot perfectly.  Steve smiles.
“Pretty sure he could buy the Knicks,” Steve says.  “Hire himself.  I’m telling you.  He’s really impressive.”
“Sounds good,” Bruce agrees.
“I wasn’t worried about our reputations,” Steve says quietly. “God, Tony, I was worried about you. About that tape getting out and you having to relive someone hurting you.”
And that’s all.  He doesn’t try and make Steve feel better or convince him that he was a kid and he had good intentions and it wasn’t a big deal.  He just squeezes Steve knee and then speaks.
“Clint Barton, right?” Tony asks as he steps up behind him.
“You lost a lot of blood,” Bruce says as reassuringly as he can. “It may take a little time for you to be up and moving.”
“I already broke plates,” Steve says quietly.  He doesn't trust himself to say more.
Steve thinks it over.  Thinks about the lonely nights he’d spent in that flat in DC.  Remembers the night he found Fury in the dark.  Ears everywhere.  The gun shot.  The chase.  The Winter Soldier.
“I better get back in there before Banner goes all Oppenheimer on us.”
Bruce runs his shower warm, and then stands with his face turned up to the stream and stays there until he has to shift away to catch his breath, and then he grabs the soap. It’s the first proper shower he’s had in a month and a half. He’s so filthy that the swirls of dirt that wash down the drain leaves trails that look like modern art.  Bruce can make out a storm cloud.  An ugly monkey.  A wheat field in Kansas.
It was no surprise that Clint would be with Bucky. They were thick as thieves these days and Barton spent the night as often as he didn’t. The guest room was pretty much his at this point.
“With a knife in it,” Clint suggests excitedly.
“Fine.  We can be friends, I guess.  But just for the record,” James says, turning to look at Clint with a mischievous gleam in his eyes.  “You ever fuck me over, I’m gonna shoot you in the face, friend or not.  And unlike your other pals, I don’t miss.”
He moves up again, letting his forehead drag up Tony’s sternum and over the arc reactor.  Tony’s making all kinds of whimpers and gasps and soft moans.  He can’t lay still. It’s driving Steve crazy in the best possible way.
Tony stops short and turns to look Steve in the eyes.  “James Buchanan Barnes did not live 70 extra years of hell on this planet to die in the back of one of my quinjets, or in whatever circus tent of a backyard Barton’s got hidden up in the middle of Nowheresville, New York.  It’s not going down like that. It’s just not. I won’t let it, and neither will you. So we’ve got this.  Right?”
“Yeah, you’d think,” Tony agrees.
The words are so full of suspicion and poorly hidden animosity, Steve considers bailing.  Clearly a win and some shawarma hadn’t smoothed over all their differences.  But Steve’s faced worse than a cranky Stark and he’d rehearsed his words all the way from DC to New York so he knows exactly what he wants to say.
“You’re willing to risk your life on that?”
“It was... something,” Steve sighs. “But can we not? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get my hopes up.”
(Official point system. No bitching. ~SR)
It’s Sunday. Rhodey has just left, and they’re alone in Tony’s room eating gummy bears. A bit belatedly, Steve wishes they weren’t having this talk while sitting on Tony’s bed.
“Maybe,” Natasha hedges.  “Sam does it better. You should ask to see it when he gets back from DC.”
“Have a good night, Captain America.”  Tony says it in a voice that would be a lot more fitting for saying something like ‘drop dead, asshole.’
it was Bucky.  Nobody but him could ever make callin’ me ‘Captain America’ sound so much like an insult.  'Least till I met you.”
“Go ahead,” Steve says, gesturing.  “Merry Christmas.”  It’s late July, but he knows they’re going to appreciate what’s inside just the same.
“It’s like Steve said,” James says.  “Exactly like that.”
“We aren’t going to be upset with you if you’re talking to him,” Clint insists.
“You might be surprised,” Bruce says. “Now, try to lay as still as you can. It’ll be painful if you fling yourself off.”
“But they can’t this time, I don’t think?  I mean, that’s what the guy promised Hammer.  Something about Tony consenting on video?”
If Bruce had written down a thousand guesses as to how James was going to answer his question, that wouldn’t have been on there. He’s not entirely sure what to do with it.
“The last time Sir displayed similar behaviors, his expected death was imminent.  Is he dying again?”
“Do I?” Tony asks. He gives up on ripping out the wires and just starts beating the thing on the table as hard as he can in frustration. Shards of plastic and wire and metal fling off in a spray around him. “Or does it even matter? I’d let you, you know that right? Fuck whoever you want. I would let you do anything if it meant keeping you. I’m fun like that.”
It’s a good sign James is owning some of this. Bruce nods and wipes his hand on his pajama pants before he reaches for the baton. He knows that scrubbing up before touching the equipment is better lab etiquette but it will only make the scanner seem that much more official.  Better to act like it’s not a big deal.
“I promised my therapist we’d talk about... sex,” Steve says.
“So what-- we wait for him to walk himself into the tower?” Tony asks.
It’s hard at first.  Rhodey’s the most decent person Tony knows; that’s why he loves him.  The thought of his very best friend becoming a soulless killer is almost impossible to imagine.
!  I always follow back and tend to post a lot of Tony, Steve, Sam and Bucky love in all sorts of random combinations.  OH!  And Clint.  So much Clint. <3
“For me it’s always the memories,” Clint confides.  “What if Jarvis puts something on the screen and Bruce props you up a little? I like cartoons,” Clint suggests.
“Burgers and fries,” Steve repeats, then nods.
Steve leads Tony straight to the armored car, and the rest of their friends (now including Rhodey) are an impenetrable wall around them.  Steve makes sure Tony climbs in first, but then there’s a pause and friendly chatter outside the car.  After that, Steve’s the only person who joins him.
“Or a cane,” Natasha says.
Those were Steve’s personal favorites, too.  They cover you in pink glitter glue and smell like sewer.  He was definitely saving his for Clint.  As was Tony, apparently, because by the time they all came back together once the game was over, Clint was pink and stinky from head to toe.
Tony walks away, and when the door swishes closed behind him, all the lights go out.
“Okay
“Okay, the hotel might have taken me by surprise.  But I know that face you’re making,” Steve says, nodding toward the first.  “That’s you’re protective face.  Whatever was going on here, you weren’t trying to hide some kid you’d taken to bed.”
“Need a lift?” Natasha asks.
“You got a name I can give?”
“It’s the best salad in the city,” Tony protests, as they walk down the street together, almost close enough to touch.  “And I’m over in this part of town next to never.  Just try the salad, Steve.  If it doesn’t knock your panties off, we can grab a second lunch.  You eat like a hobbit anyway.”
“It’s my treat tonight, boys,” she says. “ You’ll have to wait until next week to have your pissing contest over who pays.”
“I think so, yeah, definitely,” Tony’s ex-girlfriend giggles.  She’s smiling like a sycophant.  Steve has no charitable thoughts for this woman.  “It was really disappointing actually, after everything I’d heard.  But I guess you’d need to get one of his old girlfriends in here if you want to have a before and after look at his performance.  We can compare notes.  It could be like a slumber party!”
After their bird rescue mission, Steve had decided to burn off some energy with a run around Manhattan and Tony had tried for a little bit of work-week normalcy. He's not making much progress, since he's pretty sure his eyes have been staring at the same page of the last Stark Industries Board Report for the better part of a half an hour.  Not that he's great at this boring, bullshit paperwork even at the best of times, but he is floundering to find a reason to care now, when so many more important things are happening off in Europe without him.
“I’ve heard of it, but no-- I haven’t watched it.  That’s the one without the lightsabers, right?”
“These will do,” she says.  “And I know the four of you will take care of the distraction.  It feels good to be back in the thick of things.  I never thought I’d have another chance.”
He can’t stomach the thought of Tony objectified like that, no matter how much he’d like to see him without his clothes.  Especially if he was still practically a kid.  Steve knows if there are pictures of Tony tied up on the internet (and seriously
“Sam’s gun is more of an appetizer,” Natasha replies, with a slight smirk. “Move back a little. I’ll show you dessert.”
were incredible.”
“Whatever he wants is good with me,” Steve says.
“This is the best day of my life,” Clint says.
“I’m proud of you, Tony,” Steve says.  “You’re breathing.  I know it’s hard but you’re breathing.  And I am so proud of you for that.  Can you breathe with me?”
Bucky tilts his head down slightly, making his blue eyes grow wide and he leans more weight on one leg, and sticks a hand in his pocket which is just doing things for his physique that seem entirely unfair. Barnes is a menace.
Clint nods. “Aye, aye, Captain.”
“Shut the door behind you,” James says abruptly.
“What’s the other suggestion?” Clint asks, once James has settled into position. “Cause I gotta tell you, I’m really hoping it’s batshit crazy and ends with James wearing yoga pants and balancing on his head.”
Bruce starts to open his mouth but James interrupts him by declaring “You’re back in the bath, Barton!”
“Sexy any way you turn,” Bucky says, turning in his seat to wipe a smudge of dirt off Clint’s cheek.  There’s ten times as much dirt and debris in his hair, but that’s no doubt a lost cause.
“Not anymore,” Jarvis says.
There’s silence at the table.  A genius, a super soldier, the queen of spies, and Colonel Sanders... all stumped.
As the night wears on the old folks show their exhaustion early. It’s barely nine when Steve walks the last of the guys from his table to the door. He’s on his way to find Tony when a young man stops him.
“How do you know?” Tony asks.  “That I like him.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, as he turns to face Steve. “I was an ass. Such a giant ass, and I don’t deserve your forgiveness for that but if you’d consider it-- I’d like to make it up to you. Fix things. Or at least end things in a way that isn’t incredibly shitty and terrible. I mean you’re here. That’s-- that’s something, right?”
“Less security means
There’s a few second delay and then Jarvis speaks again.
Gun basket.  Of course.
“We’ve made good time,” Clint says. “We’re probably 30 minutes out.”
“You look like a unicorn took a shit on you,” Clint says, with a grin.
Steve expects her to continue, but again she doesn’t, and she looks incredibly smug about leaving it there.
Steve looks hopeful.  And maybe a little lustful.  Oh gods, that is a good look on him.
Tony knows it’s meant for him and he gives the slightest dip of his chin.  Yeah, he’s okay.   A minute ago, not so much.  A minute ago he’d been desperately fighting off the first twinges of a panic attack.  The Senate mandated inquisition had turned into a Let’s Blame Stark party, and Tony was
Steve does, though the noise from the street is loud and distracting, and people are edging closer because apparently Avengers get no privacy at all.  If this is bad news he can’t do this here.  He just can’t.
Steve looks down at his hands.  He can hear that fight replaying in his head like it’s on the radio.  He’s memorized every word.
“No, he didn’t,” Steve says emphatically.  “He never said that was his egg.  We assumed.  I'm calling it for my boyfriend.”
“I’m calling because I’m hoping you can shed a little light on what it’s like for you to heal after a significant injury,” Bruce says. “Is that something you’re comfortable discussing?”
“Fine.  You know what?  I’m gonna leave your asses wondering.  It’s going to keep you up at night.  What would Clint have named his sex tape?  You’ll be tossing and turning and wishing you knew!”
Tony nods.  “Wish I’d noticed sooner.  I was in my own bad place.”
“Bruce didn’t say,” Steve says.  “Just asked me about what it feels like to be hurt.”
“You’ll come get me if he’s up for talking?” Steve asks.
“I’m sure she did,” Bruce confirms. “And as soon as the swelling is down we’ll get you fixed up-- we’re going to have your wrist back to new. We can do that.”
“To me, too,” Bruce says.  “And you’re smart not to trust words alone.  I think actions make for much better data.  And right now Steve’s actions indicate he’s not going to give up looking for you any time soon.  Why do you think that is?”
Tony considers it.  “He wasn’t like that after you were gone.  He was cold.  Calculating.  Were you two together?”
“That’d be amazing,” Steve says. “My dad-- he passed when I was a kid. My coaches were everything to me when I was in junior high. And you’d be so good at it.”
“Yeah?  And what’s that?” Steve prods innocently.
“Which I considered. I even gave Fury a head’s up and I had Jarvis acting as tech support for the whole operation all day. Didn’t I, J?”
“They’re dead,” Tony says. “Old news.”
, you know? I wasn’t making assassination plans if you weren’t behaving yourself, I swear. You could have fucked up whole villages. It wasn’t my business.”
Bucky knows Steve will never tell.
“He’s not giving anyone a billion dollars,” Natasha says.
“Not even Pepper,” Natasha says.  “And I know she loves him.  If she couldn’t do it, no one can.”
“Hope you weren’t looking forward to anything fancy,” Tony says.  “We needed comfort food, and they make hamburgers here with the fries under the bun and eggs on top.  It doesn’t get more comforting than that.”
Bruce lifts his head to object on James’s behalf then realizes he doesn’t have a better suggestion. Where else are they going to go?
zombies were harmed in the making of that Vine.  Plus, Steve made disappointed eyes at me and I offered to reimburse the company but it was like 53 cents worth of staples and I need to wait until I get my check--”
“Captain Rogers, I
It’s homesickness.  Nostalgia.  And it sucks.
anything.”
Half the bar turns to look at them, and Clint flings himself over the table, leaving Bucky struggling to hold on to Clint’s leg to keep him from crashing face first into the ground.  Tony laughs so hard his side aches, and then as soon as he catches his breath, Kate does a dramatic re-enactment of Clint’s antics and they’re all laughing again.
He expects Tony to move briskly toward the waiting car outside, but about halfway through the mass of pushing bodies he stops.  It takes Steve a minute to work out what’s going on, but when Tony reverses and uses his body to make way for a few young, nervous-looking Stark Industries employees, Steve gets it.  They’d gotten caught in the crowd and Tony’s taking the time to walk them to the elevator safely.
The questions continue as Tony gets back to work.  Steve only worries for a minute that the distraction will derail Sam’s wings before it’s obvious Tony’s second wind has reinvigorated the process.
They scan ants, and beer bottles, and a spider web. James finds an old watering can with a family of mice living in it around the back side of the chalet and when several mice end up running up the spout and making a jump for safety, Bruce shrieks loud enough to inspire a few rounds of impressions from Clint.
empty, but it’s empty right now.  And all the things Tony’s wanted to do in that house-- in that room-  in that ridiculously squeaky twin bed-- are all there for the taking.
“Good morning, handsome,” he says quietly, before kissing Tony again, this time on the neck.
“There’s still a malfunction at the knee... it’s not right...” James trails off and lets out an exasperated huff of air that Bruce has grown to realize is his ‘I’m having trouble making words work for me’ signal.
Bruce sits on the grass a few feet away and waits. Clint takes a seat on a battered, old porch swing and watches Natasha and Sam unload the jet’s entire medical bay into the house. Clearly this is a place Nat has been before, because every time she passes Clint they share a few quiet sentences about what room is best to set up as a medical clinic and where they think everyone else should sleep.
Steve raises an eyebrow.  “Is this a show about cops who
There’s total silence.  The room stays dark.
“There’s something else,” Tony says. “Something I wanted you to be the first to know.”
“Just goes to show you, HYDRA’s a bunch of ignorant assholes,” Clint says helpfully.  “Best marksman in the world, except for maybe me, and then they put you at a disadvantage.  It’s one thing being evil, but do they have to be evil and stupid?”
“Words are not my friends,” Bruce says.  “For the record, this is why I avoid press conferences.”
Despite the warm water, Bruce’s muscles are still tense. He’s not going to relax until he knows everyone’s okay.
Steve lets out a deep breath. “Okay then. Let’s go.”
“That was perfect,” Steve tells Tony, when they’re in the elevator.  “I-- I don’t know how I could be happier.”
“Sounds like a smart guy.”
Roses are Red,
“I will do my best, sir.”
“Why?” James asks in a tone of thick disapproval.  With only one word he manages to effortlessly convey that his opinion has never meant anything to anyone before, so it’s stupid that Bruce suddenly wants to take it into consideration now.
“Seriously, you thought you needed to soften us up with milkshakes for this, Rogers?” Natasha teases gently.  “I’m happy for you.  This is good news.  Stop looking like you think you’re letting us down.”
Steve shakes his head and gives Tony a sad smile.  “No one.  I just-- toughed it alone, I guess.  After that I read up on what I could find.  What helps some people.  What might help me.  A lot of what I read was more for friends or family members.  Thought it might come in handy someday.”
Chapter warnings for lots of blood and for a mention of possibly suicidal thoughts.  The person in question was not suicidal, but another character phrases it in a way that could be upsetting if suicide mentions bother you.
“Ever since Bucky accidentally shot through the kitchen wall, Nanna’s had the gun basket,” Steve explains.  He’s smirking, obviously delighted by the story.
James nods and stands to walk over and grab it.  He also seems to use it as an excuse to come eye their new gifts more closely.
The bedroom door opens before Bruce can reply and James steps out in pajama bottoms. He's frowning and he's got a serious case of bedhead. It makes him look a lot less intimidating.
“Is that some kind of ancient Russian proverb?” Steve asks.
, so silence is definitely for the best.
Tony sighs, acting put upon, but he looks incredibly happy.
Tony doesn’t know how much he needed some quiet time until it’s only him and Steve in the car.  He’s done with words, and all he can do is nod.
Tony doesn’t text like this unless he’s pissed. Steve’s not sure what’s wrong but before he jumps to conclusions he types
“There’s a piece of paper,” Tony interrupts.  “Over there.  It ummm... just... this conversation might be easier...”
“They’ve got a ton of security here for just a server farm,” Steve points out.  “More than you’d expect.”
“I don’t know how any of you kept yourselves alive long enough to do any good,” James complains. “I broke Clint-- then the first thing you do is hand me a knife. What if somethin’ else goes wrong?”
He rides the elevator down to the lobby alone, and loiters awkwardly off to the side, next to a pair of cacti.  Very, very smooth.  He's not hiding.  Nope.  He's owning the atrium.  Because he owns the damn atrium. It's a very good pep talk.
“I don’t know,” Tony says.
Steve is 100% respectful of Tony’s initial refusal.  A week passes and they text constantly, and they spend time together as friends and Steve even helps Tony steal Clint’s stapler so Tony can seal it in some industrial grade jello before putting it back. (+10 points).
“She mentioned the arc reactor,” Pepper says, leaning up on her toes so Steve will hear her over the noise.  “This is the first time I’ve seen him out of his garage since that morning.”
“Tell me anything you want,” Steve affirms.
“That sounds functional to me,” Bruce says.
Why can’t he ever have nice things?
He gives James time to consider his words as he walks out to the porch. The three boxes the drone left behind aren’t too big but it’s more than Bruce was expecting.  He picks them up one at a time and carries them inside, to deposit them on the table.
“I can’t say for sure,” Bruce admits. “But it’s a good sign that you aren’t feeling it now. I wouldn’t be surprised if you were getting neural feedback from the way they’d attached the leads for your arm into your nervous system. And now that the attachments are disconnected, the feedback is  gone.”
James’s eyes dart between the two men and he takes a step back to lean against one of the porch supports. Now that the initial panic is gone Bruce empathizes with James’s struggle to regain control.
“Employees come out here on breaks,” Steve explains.  “They let us use it though.  We’re everybody's favorites.”
“Google me,” Tony quips.  “Try an image search, safesearch off.  I’m young, but legal, in the pictures.  You can see for yourself how much I enjoy it.”
“I don’t think Tony’s going to want to help me with this,” Steve hedges.
“Later,” Steve says. He’s frowning as he types on his laptop. Steve is always frowning these days.
“I only wanted to protect you,” Steve says.  “To be someone in your life who you know really does think you’re enough.  Just you.  Not your money.  Not your name.”
“You’re on,” Steve says.
Bruce finally gets a better look at Clint as he’s laying the holo-baton on the ground next to James. He sees a dark bruise and a bone out of place nudged up just under skin above Clint’s wrist. Bruce has to focus on James for now despite how much he’d like to help his teammate. At least until he has some idea of what’s gone wrong.
“It’s come up once or twice.”
“Can I go check on him?”
Steve makes a face.  “Not-- not
return if he asked. Seems pointless to test it out when right now Bruce’s text company is the only thing keeping Tony afloat and it’s a hell of a lot better than nothing.
“Tony Stark is not on trial here,” Steve says.  “We agreed to answer your questions about recent events as a courtesy.  If we’d known the only reason you asked us here was to rake our teammate over the coals, we’d have told you where you could shove your invitation.”
Clint shows up two minutes later. “Bucky borrowed a car,” he greets them.
“I went to see an art history professor today,” Steve begins.  “About a charity thing. We got to talking about the Avengers and he mentioned you were a student of his once. Said you’d written one of the best papers he’d ever read.  It was so good, the guy had kept it all these years.  Is any of this ringing a bell?”
Bruce turns off the stove and carries the plate of pancakes over to the table. Clint’s method of breakfast eating seems kind of genius, so he picks one up and rolls it like a rug. Eating the pancake by hand makes it easier to inspect the new technology.
Steve takes a moment to think about.  “No.”
“Can an egg be worthy?” Tony asks, offhandedly.  Or it would be off-handed if he didn’t have a gleam in his eye that makes Steve smirk.
“Sir, I agree with Captain Roger’s recommendation that you abandon the van,” JARVIS says, the volume on the phone doubled, as if JARVIS thinks that’s what it’s going to take to get his point across.  “That is a Kamov Ka-52, Sir. Based on your designs. They will be in missile range in less than two minutes.”
“People make mistakes.  In your case, you’ve made some big ones.  It doesn’t mean it always has to be that way.”
It had only been a sort of offhanded thought on Steve’s part, when he’d chosen it.  Give Bruce something that isn’t green.  Seemed simple enough.  But to Bruce it clearly meant a whole lot more.
“If something else is wrong, we’ll fix it,” Bruce assures him. “Until then, I’ve got a weapon for you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It changes nothing, but at the same time it changes everything.
“That was all on me,” Tony says.  “I take some getting used to.  My point is, first impressions-- or second impressions-- aren’t the most reliable way to gauge how something’s going to go.  Give him another chance.  And another.  And maybe like a dozen more, and whether he’s the old Barnes or not-- you might like the guy.  Bruce doesn’t have a lot of friends, you know that right?  But he likes James.  That says something.”
“Bruce Wayne’s due for a meltdown any day now,” Tony agrees.
Natasha’s got an arm around Clint's waist and she leads the way up the ramp.
They head toward the exit and spill out onto the street.  There’s anonymity in numbers and blue jeans and Tony doesn’t catch any strangers taking notice of him.  That’s a nice change.
“No,” Steve says honestly, as he swirls a knife around in the peanut butter.  “Yes?  I don’t know.”
He usually enjoys their banter but today his heart’s not in it.  Pepper sits on the edge of his desk and smooths some hair out of his eyes.
“Why is that?” Steve asks, figuring if anyone will know the answer it will be Rhodey and Pepper.
“I’m not talking to him,” Steve says. That much he can say with certainty. “He’s not supposed to use the phone.”
“Tony will figure something out,” Bruce agrees.
“Take as long as you need,” Bruce says. “You’re safe, I swear you’re safe. No one’s going to hurt you, or wipe your memories, or strap you to a chair. HYDRA-- they aren’t here. And if they show up, Clint, Sam and Natasha are here to protect you. Plus there’s me and the Other Guy. The Hulk.”
Bruce is just happy to have any kind of friendship at all.
“Which one? What happened?”
“Just be yourself,” Steve says, putting a hand to the small of Tony’s back.  “She’s going to think you’re great.”
Now that James is passed out it’s clear Clint’s not going to shut his own eyes unless
You awake?
Steve’s biggest challenge during these weeks is mostly the exhaustion that comes from working a full time job with SHIELD, Avenging when necessary, and spending his weekends outside of the city. He drives upstate on Saturday mornings, they have couples therapy until lunch, and then Steve naps in Tony’s room while Tony does the rest of his rehab therapy on his own.  They eat dinner together, and then Steve leaves to go to the nearest hotel.  He returns Sunday for their usual visit, and that’s when they do their couples therapy homework from the day before.
“No,” Steve says emphatically. “It guts me to put it like that. But what else can I say? You don’t want to hear that I love you and that this isn’t your fault. Or that Clint and Natasha love you and that when the shit hit the fan, Natasha didn’t have to think twice about calling for you. She knew you’d come. She trusted you. That’s team. That’s family.”
He loses track of time, and he only comes back to reality when a foot gently nudges his.  It causes Tony to startle, bang his head on the metal above him, and then flop back to the ground with a groan.
Steve takes a few steps toward the door then pulls out his phone, so he’ll look like he’s texting.  That’s the great thing about phones.  No more hiding behind bushes when you want to look inconspicuous.
“Like I’m going to tell you no in those jeans,” Mae laughs.
“Something along the lines of a badly broken bone,” Bruce says.  “Can you tell me what that might feel like for you?”
“I will,” Jenny says. “Now can we skate or are you waiting for me to get old?”
*crack*
“Someone could have used that,” Steve objects half-heartedly.
Tony waves him off, then closes his bedroom door behind himself so Rhodey will just leave already.
I can scan him again but the wires are all fixed in place.  I’m pretty sure what you’re looking at is an exact match for the first scans I took in Switzerland.
“JARVIS, take it away,” Tony says.
“Barring anything unforeseen, he’ll be up in the next few hours,” Bruce agrees. “Which is why we’re calling. We need to find a place where he can wake up and even if he feels alarmed, not hurt himself or anyone else. We’ve already ruled out the tower. The only place he couldn’t escape there is the Hulk-Proof room and I’m not doing that to him. I’m not going to allow him to wake up restrained either. When he comes to, I want him to be able to move and to feel like he can protect himself.”
Now it’s Tony’s turn to make a face, though this time he simply looks exasperated.  “Fine.  I’m here for our second official first date.  Get in the damn quinjet.”
It really doesn’t.  Tony knows this, having come here for food after such grand events as:
“Everyone into the woods,” Steve says.  “We’ll figure out a path as we go.”
The look of gratitude Steve shoots him is worth the sacrifice.
“Don’t kink shame me, Captain Prude.  Let me enjoy this daydream.  You as the starving artist, me as the benevolent patron.”
Art by
There are legos and a Black Eyed Peas poster and there’s a letterman jacket for jazz band and tennis slung over a chair.  There’s a diorama of dinosaurs and a volcano adorned with a first place ribbon.  There is also a cubby full of art supplies beneath multiple tacked up pencil drawings of Justin Timberlake.  There’s a graduation cap and some Star Trek memorabilia.  And unsurprisingly, there’s a Good Sportsmanship Award, hung up proudly over an ancient computer desk complete with ancient computer.
“Hey!” Tony objects. He grabs for the pieces of his phone and Steve puts his hand on Tony’s arm.
“I need a favor,” Steve says.  “And I don’t think you’re going to like it.”
Of course no one listens, and they all come running.  An egg is half dripping from the ceiling and half hovering a few inches above the floor in a small nest made of what looks like spare Iron Man parts.  It’s held in the air by a repulsor that’s firing from underneath.
Natasha’s cut off by a soft cellphone ring, coming from one of the kitchen cabinets.
“Let’s do it,” Tony says.  “It’ll be nice to collaborate on something that’s not for the team for once.”
“We do accept booze,” Clint adds from the bed. “As restitution. If you’re ever in the mood to make amends.”
Steve scoots his chair back from the table and reaches over to put a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“Are Steve and Stark going to meet us there?” Sam asks.
Jenny looks at them both like they’ve lost their minds. “Mom’s right. You two deserve each other.”
“I trust him, Sam,” Steve says.
Because Tony can picture it if he really tries.
“So much worse,” Tony groans.  “But c’mon.  It’ll be an experience.”
“Gave myself a ringtone, too,” Tony says with a smirk. “That way you won’t have to wonder if it’s me.”
“Which is why Obadiah kept trying to fire you,” Tony says, filling in the blanks there.
trying to prove himself to these people.  Just not as done as Steve apparently.
“Yeah but you also trust the guy who filled you up with bullets, so I’m hoping you can see where I’m coming from.”  Sam looks at Tony.  “I’m not trying to be a dick.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And you are an absolute delight after two AM,” Tony agrees.
He hates that this is his life now. Can’t even crash at a friend’s house for fear of damaging their reputation.
There was always a chance they’d report me and Barney and we’d get separated. Never trusted SHIELD Medical because I guess I always figured their responsibility was to SHIELD not to me. But I trust Bruce.  He’s never given me a reason to not.”
?” Clint asks.
“Probably the best way, yeah,” Bucky confirms. “Keep him safe.”
“You ready to light it up?” Bucky asks Tony as they all hurry back toward the protection of the trees.
“He’s on my list,” James says, glancing back toward the mountain where Clint had been watching. “I'd have found him eventually. All your other friends, too.”
“Put the box down,” Tony says.
“One day, and you’re gonna figure out how they worked, get all the materials you need, and super-glue them all back together?” Sam asks skeptically.
“You aren’t perfect,” Tony points out.  “If you were, you’d be a lot less interesting.  But come on-- now I want to hear your USO hand job stories that had nothing to do with the chorus girls.  Who was it?  The guy who played Hitler?  Some townie from Podunk, PA? You’ve got to spill or I’m gonna fill in all my own blanks.”
“I don’t know if I’d call him a disaster.”
A kudos from you,
“I’ve heard that before,” Tony says. He sounds plaintive. Small.
"It was one time!" Bucky complains.
“I call first pick!” Clint calls.
Steve smiles, then it fades to something more pensive. "Can I ask you something? If it's not private or -- I'll understand if you can't say." Steve pushes his hand over his hair, mussing it up. "It's just that he seems so much like Bucky. Like the Bucky I knew. I can’t tell you how many times my ma described him that way-- full of personality."
“No, thank you.”
“You should probably update this for accuracy. There’s no such thing as Iron Man anymore.”
There’s another explosion off in the distance.  Who even knows what that one might be?
Steve had gripped the table so hard he’d broken the wood under his fingers; it was the only way he was going to keep from snapping Hammer’s neck.  He wouldn’t have given the man selling the video even that small courtesy.  He’d have broken all his fingers one by one then given him to Natasha.
Bruce nods his agreement. James huffs then sits down hard on the couch.
Steve nods.  “Thank you,” he says sincerely as the officer opens the door.
It’s late.  Tony hadn’t come to bed so Steve goes looking at him.  He’s in his workshop, still fiddling with the Iron-Nest.  Iron-Eggsy is off to the side, still in one piece.
“If we survive,” Bruce reminds him.
“It’s your funeral,” Rumlow shrugs.
but I won't quit writing,
Unhurriedly, Clint reaches out the glass to James.  James takes it and drinks a few sips.  Clint crouches down, so that even though James is looking toward the floor, he can see him in his view.
“Where did you even buy rainbow glitter paintballs?” Steve asks.
Tony laughs.  “I don’t think that’s a big relationship selling point.”
Steve doesn’t miss how Clint kicks up his foot onto the booth across from them, so it rests against Bruce’s thigh. Huh.
Rhodey looks confused and then grudgingly pleased. “Does this friend have something to do with that text from Bucky Barnes?”
he didn’t cover himself with this quilt.
“Well, I don’t,” Fury barks over comms.  “Get your schmoopy asses off my Triskelion.  And Stark?”
He pulls off his t-shirt and uses it to wipe off his forehead.
“For emergencies,” Sam says.
have been overstating my skill-set.”
“I’m sorry,” Bruce whispers, wrinkling his forehead in troubled concentration as he takes a deep breath to steady his hand then drives the knife into James’s side, removing it just as quickly as he shoved it in.
“Wouldn’t call an uncomfortable shirt any kind of suffering,” James quips.  “The shirts Hydra dressed me in were different.  They...” James trails off and looks up at the ceiling.
before turning back to his work.
“I already have everything that makes me happy right here.  Anything else is just the icing on the cake.”
“You’re barely 90,” Tony says.  “You’ve got your whole life ahead of you.”
Steve lets the words hang in the air like he needs to slot them into place before he can respond.
“I love him,” Steve says again, because he really has no better explanation.
He wasn’t angry at Steve’s initial intrusion but now he kind of is.  Leave it to Steve to get a rise out of him over practically nothing.
Bruce follows after him and cooks lunch for himself and Clint.  They eat while James munches on some StarkBars, and then Bruce takes a nap that lasts most of the afternoon.  He wakes up to the sounds of James and Clint debating the merits of different types of weapons. Loudly. From what Bruce can make out, James is about as impressed by a bow and arrow as he'd be by a toy nerf gun.  Clint agrees.
“I am not.”
“You’re hoping it’s safe,” Bruce points out.  “We don’t know.”
“A minute out,” Sam responds. He’s a flurry of steady, practiced motion as he drops to his knees next to James. He empties out his pouch onto the ground and he grabs the rubbing alcohol and some dark gauze. “Doctor Banner, can you give me an assist here? I need an extra hand.”
“If I say yes, does that mean you’ll erase it?”
Leave a kudos or comment,
‘A few weeks left in rehab', turns out to mean five.  No one wants to rush Tony home, especially not Steve.
Clint rides shotgun (both because he calls it on the way to the van and also because he is quite literally holding a sawed-off shotgun in his lap) and Steve, Bruce and Tony are on the floor in the back.  This may be the most dangerous part of the plan, since transporting volatile chemicals in milk jugs and old whipped cream tubs breaks about a thousand transit safety rules.
It turns out, Thor’s resolve lasts another hour before he and Clint and Bucky have rigged the egg with some bow string and weights to Mjolnir’s handle to test Yolki’s worthiness.  For about half a second it looks like the hammer will wobble then--
“We’re on a date.  You didn’t sign up for a lecture on astrophysics.”
Which is a problem for future!them, because Bruce is all out of brain space to wonder what that’s all about.
“Because I want to talk and I sure as shit don’t want what I have to say to end up on the internet.  And even if this thing has a camera...”  Tony reaches under the steering wheel, pulls out a set of wires and then yanks.  “It won’t be listening.”
“I killed Stark’s parents,” James reminds them, as if there is any chance they’d forget.
“I’ve spent a lot of time in bars,” Tony says.  “I picked up a thing or two.”
“No. Not really,” Bruce says. “I don’t know what I’m doing," he adds, since he feels like Clint needs to understand that. "A real therapist would have seen the size of the trigger coming toward James, and stepped in. Redirected. Something.”
“Yes.”
“What else would that mean?” Tony asks.
Rhodey begging for help that’s never gonna come.  Tony had Yinsen.  Tony didn’t face his fate alone.
He’s black and blue in places that haven’t been black and blue since he was in Junior Hockey. He’s been playing like he’s got nothing to lose, and the scores and his injuries seem to speak for themselves.
The large flat screen built into the wall flicks on and Natasha’s portrait shows up first.  On Tony’s high definition tv it looks even better than Steve remembers.  BLACK WIDOW is emblazoned across the bottom in a fancy script and above her code name, their fellow Avenger is drawn over a background of intricate snowy curves and flowing lines.  Russia in the winter, Steve thinks.
James takes a step back, still wary.  He sways a little on his feet, like balance is a problem.
“Point taken, though I always heard it as sleeping dogs,” Bruce says. “I guess bears makes more sense, now that I think about it. Either way, you’re right.”
“That smells good,” Clint says, nodding toward the pain.  “What’d I miss?”
“I appreciate it,” Bruce consoles.
“Did SHIELD finally have enough?” Tony asks, once they’ve been driving for a few minutes.  His head is resting against the window and his eyes are still shut tight.  His words are slurred and sluggish.  “You taking me to Fury’s top secret hidey hole so you can lock me up like the dark family secret?”
“But thermodynamics you can learn in a night,” Steve says.  It isn’t a question.
James nods.
Then promptly rolls over the egg, splattering what’s left of it and tracking it across the floor of the lab in a gruesome blur of yolk and white.
“Is there something you’d like to share with the class?” Tony asks.
“Tony Staaaaaaaark,” Clint says, with a grin. “Hot damn.”
“So am I and you just called me a shit,” Steve points out.
“There were a lot of kidnapping concerns, too,” Pepper adds.  “Until Tony left for college they kept him isolated.  It wasn’t an ideal situation.”
+20 to Tony.  I said shit.
“Howard wasn’t a drunk when I knew him,” Steve says, wanting to explain.  “We were in the war and for a long time he was like... like a breath of fresh air.  Like someone so smart and so special, the war couldn’t touch him.  When I see similarities between the two of you, that’s what I see,” Steve says.
is keeping watch.
Steve climbs out of the car first, so he’s the one who gets the first set of gasps.  Flashbulbs go off by the dozens.  Justin, who is still up at the microphone pauses, then tilts his head in frustration as Tony emerges behind Steve.  For a man who can smarmily smile through just about anything, that’s practically a scream.
“I’m sorry your father wasn’t good to you,” Steve says.  “And I’d say I wish I’d been around to knock some sense into him, but if Peggy couldn’t do it, I don’t think I’d have stood a chance.”
“Ignore that!” Tony shouts.
“Don’t thank me,” Tony says. His voice is steel through the speaker.
“No,” Tony insists.  “Can we just talk first.  Please?”
“Tony, please. I’m begging you. Don’t run away. Come with me to check on Clint and Natasha. Please don’t leave me to deal with this on my own.”
Steve gestures toward the night in some kind of non-verbal explanation of his actions.
They all have more in common with Elsa than they do with Maria Von Trapp anyway.
Steve’s SHIELD mandated therapist assures him he’ll feel better eventually.  That he’ll ‘move on, in time’.  Steve kind of wants to be a smart ass and remind the guy he’s pretty sure ‘moving through time’ is the crux of his problem but he keeps his mouth shut.  Both to the shrink and to Stark.
Steve grabs Tony’s hand and threads their fingers together to pull him toward the stairs before Nanna can say any more.  Which is kind of a shame.  Tony can't say he'd ever get tired of watching Bucky get outplayed by his grandma.
“Yes,” Tony says immediately.  “Am I right?  Howard?”
“Do you feel this?” Bruce asks.
“It’s not a choice I’d have ever made,” James says.
“The distraction will be the easy part,” Bucky says as he looks around the table.  “None of the us are getting into that server farm undetected.  We all look like some version of trouble.”
“Oh god, please let me live," Clint fake pleads.  "Nat will sit by my grave and never let me hear the end of it if you don't.”
“I don’t want you to think I don’t care that he hurt you,” Steve says. It’s important to him that they believe that. “I do. I care. He was wrong.”
"JARVIS, is Tony awake?" Steve asks.
love if it isn’t an overriding (sometimes idiotic) concern for the wellbeing of someone other than yourself?
“We’re going to need milk jugs,” Tony says.  “Or tupperware.  And wires.”
The information Kate and Nanna retrieved, contained more than a hit on Tony and some stolen Stark Industries secrets; Stane and Hammer had been idiot enough to store government secrets on the servers as well.  Secrets gleaned from the sorts of sources that get you locked up in a cell at the bottom of the ocean.  Tony isn’t going to need to worry about the two of them for a long, long time.
Finally he recognizes someone Tony thinks he can trust-- a guy that Obie had tried to fire for playing paintball in the parking lot with some friends after hours.  The man is sitting at his desk, nursing a Stark Industries mug of coffee with his eyes closed.
Has to win this for Bucky.
James is not conscious, but Bruce wouldn’t necessarily say he’s unconscious either. His eyes are open. A stab wound is going to hurt like hell, super soldier or not. Bruce rolls James a little further to the side for access, pushes the hoodie out of the way and lines up the knife.
Steve smiles at that.  It’s not convenient to be treated like a regular Joe, but it
“Seriously? You were going to egg his car?” Tony asks.
“Ohhhh.  Bigfoot.  Yeah, look,” Clint says, picking his phone up off his desk and taps it a few times to pull up a picture of the back of Bruce walking into his office.
Their last couples therapy session before Tony’s set to leave rehab is a tense one.
“I know,” Tony interrupts.  He can’t keep the hurt out of his voice even after years of practice.  “I was a huge disappointment.”
Tony stops what he’s doing and glares at Steve.
“I haven’t apologized.”
James takes in a slow breath. Despite the monitors telling Bruce everything is fine, it’s still a little more shallow than he would like.
“Look-- I can explain--”
Scan him again.
Tony’s in jail.  I can’t
“Can we just fucking drop this?” Tony demands.  “I’m never going to feel like things are equal with Steve so if that’s the end all be all of a healthy relationship we are fucked.”
Tony’s curled up on the floor in a corner, a mess of vomit on the tile next to him.  He’s sweaty, and grimy and he’s lost weight since Steve last saw him.  There’s more than one fading bruise on his jaw and he has dark circles under his eyes, either more bruises or just the effect of drinking like a fish for six weeks straight.  Despite the heat in sunny California, Tony’s wearing a long sleeved shirt.  Steve’s mind helpfully fills in exactly what that means.
Steve moves closer and slides his ankle over Tony’s calves. Steve looks like he’s going to say more but the car rolls to a stop and he goes quiet.
“What’s unknown awesome?” Tony asks.
Steve keeps it up until Tony’s breath evens out ever so slightly.
It’s an effort to get James on the stretcher, but once he’s on, it isn’t difficult to lift. Tony’d built some sort of thrusters under it, because of course he did. The stretcher’s also got heart monitors and a pulse oximeter and Bruce keeps one hand on the gauze while he begins to attach what he can with the other. Sam works on securing James, so he won’t roll off, as they quickly guide the floating stretcher to the Quinjet.
“Next time I’ll stay longer,” Rhodey promises, as Steve walks him to the elevator. “There’s just a lot of fires to put out right now, you know?”
“Yeah,” Tony agrees.  “So is everyone else we know.”
I’ll let him know when he wakes up.
The other guy stirs.
Steve doesn’t leave until Sunday evening. It makes for two of the best days of Tony’s adult life. Steve’s not just some guy Tony’s got in his bed, he means something. They’re friends. Yes, the sex is top notch but it’s so much more and Tony really doesn’t know what to do with that.
“Tell me how you really feel!” Rhodey calls up.
Steve thinks back to Rhodey’s story about Tony’s college years. How Rhodey was the first person to ever offer to buy Tony’s meal. It’s nice to be able to provide, even something as unpretentious as diner lunch.
“You aren’t upset?” Pepper asks. “We didn’t want to tell you while you were still in rehab because that was supposed to be about you. Your recovery. Your healing.”
“That’s where I’m going to stop you,” Tony says.  “Me and Rhodey have something we call the No Judgement Zone and it’s just what it says on the box.  This whole conversation is judgement free.  So you want to tell me how much this sucks?  Because you can.  Even though we both know Barnes wasn’t acting of his own volition and it isn’t nice to hold that against him, for as long as it takes us to get where we’re going, have at him.  No one’s ever going to know but me.”
“Hey,” Steve says carefully. “I looked up and you were gone.”
Tony lifts his phone, smiles for the camera and gives a thumbs up to text over to Bruce, along with an address.  It’s not a real smile, but Tony’s so good at faking happy mischief Bruce will never know.
“You know me,” Tony says.  “Just want to get this right, and then I can sleep.”
“Fine,” Tony agrees. “But since you took care of coffee I’m paying for all our drinks tonight. No arguments.”
“I’m not going to ditch you,” Bruce says. “Your slow is probably my fast, anyway.”
Steve chuckles though there’s an unmistakeable touch of sadness in it.  “I guess that’s a silver lining, yeah.”
“Look at you, embracing your doctor status finally,” Clint teases, scooching in comfortably against the pillows. “Better be careful or Tony’ll sign you up for med school.”
Clint is still sleeping when Bruce and Steve walk in together. James is holding a knife in his good hand. No surprise there.
“I missed you, too.”
“Last week you called me the devil.”
God, Tony loves this kid.
Steve sounds haunted. From the look on his face, it’s by the Bucky-shaped non-ghost glaring daggers at him from the bed.
“You ready for this?” Tony asks.
“There’s no... pain,” James says. There’s tension in his voice as he works out words for what he means. “Usually when I wake up it’s all wrong. There’s... static, maybe. Like steel wool brushing over raw stuff. It’s how I knew where I started and ended. But it’s all gone.” James’s flexes his fingers. “Will I stay like this? Without the static?”
“I’m not going anywhere,” Tony says. “Not without you.”
Bruce is cut off by one of the alarms monitoring James’s vital signs.
“You’re trying to control me and I don’t have time for yet another pointless conversation with an overdramatic asshole,” Jonathan says.  “I’m sick of you turning every date into an argument.  Give me the keys.”
“Has he been drinking?” Steve asks.  The thought of that happening because Steve left Tony behind in the states makes Steve’s chest clinch tight.
“If you process what’s happening as a malfunction, that’s totally valid,” Bruce says. “You would know better than I would what your malfunctions feel like. But do you think I could offer an alternate explanation for you to consider?”
Tony stands abruptly and shoves his phone in his back pocket.
“Should I forward it to Captain Rogers, also?” Jarvis asks.
“You haven’t even seen the rest,” Steve says.
“It’s not unreasonable,” Steve says.  “And since you deserve all the honesty I’ve got to give-- I’m not really sure I want to work for SHIELD anymore anyway.  I want to be an Avenger.  The SHIELD missions... I could take them or leave them.  Most of the time I’d like to leave them.  And I’ve felt like that for a while now.”
“Is Barnes hurt?” Tony asks.
“Circle of Secrets?”
“Is this about Howard?” Tony asks, half an hour later.  “You think you owe him?  Want to fix his mistakes?”
Tony steps closer.  The gun is behind glass.
“Bench me,” Tony says, dropping his spoon. “I’m finished.”
“You fellas need a ride?” Natasha asks as she walks down the ramp and then stops next to them so she can lay the stretcher down next to James.
“Everyone on the line, Jarvis?” Bruce asks.
“We could always use more,” Clint says.  “When are we having breakfast?”
No reply. Tony just starts banging the metal thingy again even harder. Hard enough that it starts to twist in his hand.
“We can take our time,” Steve says. “Find the things we like and get extremely good at them. I am all for practicing over and over and over again, until I get it right.“
“You’re both saps,” Tony pouts, finally struggling a bit in Steve’s hold.  He sounds more himself.  Reassured.
“I’m not breaking your dishes.”
“I asked you a question,” Howard says.
“You’re right. Not my best plan. What about we fire up a laser when you get back and burn it onto the moon instead?”
“Natasha Romanoff? Codename Black Widow,” James says, then pauses, as if trying to place a memory. “I shot her.”
He expects Tony to be a late riser and isn’t exactly sure how he’s going to get home, but Tony is awake and he’s making coffee and toast when Steve walks into the kitchen.
It actually takes Bruce a moment to remember what they’d been talking about before the spy games interrupted.  He starts cutting up some chicken and adding it into the stir fry as he talks.
“It doesn’t belong to Stark Industries,” Clint adds quickly, mumbling through a mouth full of fig-flavored cookie.
“Only if you’re lucky,” Clint tells her.
“Lies!” Clint declares.
She emphasizes the words ‘nothing personal’ in a way that makes them seem incredibly significant and very, very personal.  Rhodey stares down at his drink.
Or Tony’s ability to process words mid panic attack. Everything hurts. Everything’s bad. Air is hard to find.
Steve goes for a run when he gets home, to clear his head, and to silently chant “Bi does not mean interested,” as his feet fall left, right, left, right, left.
“Bruce needed a hand with something,” Tony says.
Tony wants to ask about the word
“Let me see your phone,” Tony agrees. “You can text me when you know you’ve got a free coupla hours. As long as you’re sure it’s not an imposition.”
Tony’s relationship with the pretty physics professor ends two days later.   The bruises fade and they don’t come back.
Clint sounds as hurt and angry as Bruce has ever heard him. Honestly, he’s not sure he’s ever heard Clint sound this vulnerable now that he thinks about it. Either the subject is that raw, or Clint is letting his guard down a little.
Steve could carry him easily, but he’s never been in Tony’s room and it’s probably rude to scoop someone up in your arms and put them to bed after they’re past the age of ten.  At least without some kind of prior consent.
They really are in the boondocks.  Possibly twenty miles past them.  Tony owns some property out here and it seemed like a good idea to take this project out of the city to upstate New York.
James is quiet until Tony walks in the room.
“You think I should tell her,” Tony says.  It’s not a question.
“Bruce, need anything else from out here?” Nat asks.
“Wow,” Rhodey says. “Good for you. He seems like a good guy in all his interviews.”
“That is very reassuring,” Jarvis says.  “Thank you.”
“You didn’t want to give him another chance?” Steve asks.  He’s surprised considering how much she obviously cares.
“It didn’t happen before rehab,” Rhodey objects.
The television turns on and Tony watches as Steve dims the lights then watches Tony sleep.  It’s probably overly intrusive to view the feed, but... well, he’s not known for his restraint in these things and there’s only JARVIS here to judge him.  And let’s be real: this is waaaay low on the list of weird things JARVIS has seen.
It doesn’t take long to unload their makeshift bombs, and then while Tony, Bruce and Steve get the explosives set up, Bucky moves the van back to a safe distance near the tree-line.  They manage all their work within the ten minute window of time they have allotted for the distraction that will allow Kate and Nanna to get out of the server farm safely, and for now, things are on track.
“No one’s touching my hair,” Bruce chimes in.  “Or my porn for that matter. I like my porn on paper and my hair on my head, thanks. James, the same can go for you.  Feel free to tell Clint to fuck off if you’d rather cut your hair yourself. Even if he’s already got the scissors in his hand. You aren’t obligated to let him do anything you don’t want, even if you've already given him permission.”
“So... all that made sense to you?” Steve asks.
She waits for Tony to scoot away from the table then reaches under the edge and gives something beneath it a hard twist. She slides out a drawer.
for what I was going to be.”
Now they’ve got new problems. They’d had to cut and snip and rearrange enough wires that James’s metal arm will be useless to him. JARVIS had brought Tony in for a consult at one point, and once the correct wires were cut, he hopped off comms to go get started on a fix. Whether that fix would be to mend what was already attached to James or to create something new had yet to be seen. Hopefully it will be James’s decision eventually, and Bruce prays the man will forgive him for disabling him in order to save his life.
There’s more silence.  Some shuffling on the other end.  The sound of a door closing shut.
“Yes.” The soldier’s tone leaves no room for follow up questions.
“I don’t know who you’re talking about,” Tony lies badly.  “You’ll have to be more specific.  I like a lot of people.”
Steve hops up to get out of the way as Bruce crosses the room.  A glance at the screens tells Bruce that nothing big has gone wrong.
“I would ruin you,” Tony says.  He sounds terribly sad and entirely sure.  “I take good people, and I break them, remember?”
“There really is,” Bruce agrees. “So what should I call you? Because I’m not going to refer to you as The Corpse of Bucky Barnes. I’m just not.”
“So you’ll have me?” Tony asks.
Tony has made a huge mistake. His phone is still in pieces back on the table in Steve’s apartment. No one knows where he is except the people in this car. A car that smells like tacos and dirt. Tacos and wet grave dirt, more precisely, and that is exactly how Tony will describe it when he is (inevitably, miserably) rehashing this ordeal with the NYPD.
Tony breathes a sigh of relief.  When he stopped designing weapons he
“I can’t ask you to give up your work for me,” Tony says.
“He was
Steve knows that’s not how Tony sees Bruce.
“Then don’t be one,” Tony snaps.
“Or at least here’s hoping,” Clint laughs, raising his bottle in a toast.
“We aren’t mad at you,” Clint says, with more warmth in his voice than fear. “You have to keep yourself safe, right?  So hold on to those scissors for me. You can keep them.”
Tony looks at Steve.
Bruce isn’t sure if James is having a flashback or searching for the right words, but he’s gotten to know James well enough by now that he recognizes it as one or the other.
“You aren’t Bucky, so what’s it matter?” Steve asks.
“I hurt Pep,” Tony says.  “Let her believe all this time...”
The author is not a liar and the cliff-hanger is resolved!
Steve doesn’t speak. Not because he doesn’t remember Mercy Rhodes but because he remembers an awful lot about Mercy all at once. Not all of it rated G. The boy (he’s probably twenty, but God, twenty looks young these days) takes Steve’s silence as a no.
“USO Tour. Some of those girls would offer just about anything for a couple of minutes of my time. Back in the day, we called what I just gave you a ‘hand job’,” Steve says with a straight face.
It’s obvious these aren’t common words or concepts for him. Bruce thinks it’s a good sign he can express this shit at all.
It doesn’t take them long to unpack Tony’s things.
“Geez, you don’t pull your punches, do you?” Tony asks.
“I’m not saying it’s great,” Tony adds.
“You’re a terrible liar,” Tony insists.
At Steve’s non-answer Tony pokes him in the side.
“You said as much in the conference room,” Steve says. “When you were dating what’s-her-name. The professor. We were talking about bondage. You said you knew I’d be boring in bed.”
“You can believe me or not,” Steve says, putting up his hands in surrender.  “All I’m saying is that it gets hot in the summer and we weren’t hauling our swim trunks across the eastern front.”
Plus a whole bunch of times since.
“Bucky didn’t like my suggestion of erasing all of them and subbing in a pic of my--”
“Don’t care about fun,” Steve says, because he’s pretty sure if it was the worst thing in the world it was still going to be fun. “I’m a lot more worried about wrecking it.”
Which takes him back to Steve’s Bucky memories only seeming two years removed.  Why hadn’t that occurred to Tony before?  This has to be a
“Honestly?” the woman asks.  “He’s boring and he’s
He wanders around for a bit, not knowing what to do with himself, and eventually finds himself back at his usual diner.  Steve treats himself to another burger and milkshake and in the process manages to sweet talk the lady behind the counter into adding the whole team to the menu.  Scribbling out recipe combinations on the back of a place mat is an excellent distraction.
“This isn’t because of the loss,” Tony begins. “Both teams played hard and I’m proud of our effort. I’m proud of my own effort. This isn’t about that. I just think it’s time. Time to learn to live a life outside of hockey. Time to coach my niece through her junior hockey years and to spend time with the people who mean the most to me. Time to get my priorities in order.”
“And boy mags,” Clint says cheerfully. “If you’d looked past the first one you’d see I am all about equal-opportunity porn.”
“I’m glad your back,” Steve tells her.
“The little one’s the scanner and the long thing is gonna put up a hologram,” James explains, looking up from the paper.  “The one in the middle is a transmitter.”
Now it’s the young man’s turn to smile. “She never forgot about you. She taught me and my brother all your lines from the stage show and we’d put on little plays with her in the backyard. We’d fight over who got to be you and who got to be Hitler but I always won, on account of my name.”
He steps away so he won’t be in the frame. He watches as Steve smiles like a little kid, and moves on to holding up other sticks and pucks and Tony can’t help but smile. He’s smiled more in the last 48 hours than he’d smiled in the two months previous. Steve poses with another piece of memorabilia and then puts it back in its place carefully.
Both men look at Tony expectantly and Tony rolls his eyes in mock exasperation.
“You can do this,” Steve says.  “And I’m going to be with you every step of the way.  Rhodey’s gonna fly in tomorrow.  Pepper wants to bring us breakfast.  Bruce may already be upstairs in a lab right now.  You don’t have to handle any of this alone.”
“I think they’re getting plenty of
“It was in that info Nat dumped.  JARVIS put it together about 5 weeks ago.  James killed Howard and Maria and made it look like a car accident.”
Tony’s eyes are glued to his phone screen as JARVIS feeds him the data.  It’s all there.  Everything they need to implicate Hammer and Stane in a web of wrongdoing. It’s as damning an info dump as he’s ever seen, and he has seen some bad shit in his day.
“If you’ve got time before your flight,” Steve says in a firm voice.  “My stuff can wait.”
“Re-routing the elevator now,” Tony says.
“He’s bad news, Bruce. I know what went down with him and Steve, and if there’s ever been anyone who appreciates seconds chances it’s me. But just-- don’t get your hopes up that he’s not gonna try and murder us both in our sleep. That’s gonna take time. Scruples don’t happen overnight.”
The visit last another half hour beyond that. When the receptionist walks over to the window to signal that their time is up, Steve squeezes Tony’s knee before they stand. This time the hug is automatic. Steve’s not even sure which one of them initiated it.
“That’s why you and Rogers are friends,” James grumps.  “You’re both idiots.”
Sometimes Tony gets a bit of cold comfort in knowing that the man who’d killed his parents had paid a price for it.  Paid a price 100 times over and would probably continue paying that price for the rest of his life.
Sam makes a gagging sound, right as Natasha places a steaming bowl of soup down in front of Tony.
“I’ll go check with Steve about the computer,” Clint offers.
“You’ll love it,” Clint promises Tony, breaking free of Bucky so he can linger for a moment to fall in step with Tony.  “It’s kind of a dive, but they keep a table for us on Friday nights and fries are on the house.”
“Don’t forget your plates,” Nanna reminds them.
“Sounds reasonable.  And he’s not alone,” Tony reminds him.  “Bruce is there, so the HYDRA concern goes down a couple hundred notches.  No one’s getting past the Hulk.”
“Is that what this is all about?” Tony asks.
“Disappointing,” Tony says.  “Follow up question. JARVIS can you be sure to save the audio of this and make Steve saying ‘handjob’ over and over his ringtone please?”
His teammates pile on top of him, into a writhing mass of gloves and skates and asses. There’s laughter and cheers and everything’s a blur all the way up through 2 in the morning. He reeks of champagne and every piece of him is sticky and gross and when he collapses into the chair next to Bucky’s hospital bed, he’s exhausted and just wants to sleep.
Tony doesn’t look up when the door slides open.  All his focus is on his phone, and whatever is displayed there, that’s making him frown. There’s a piece of metal netting at his feet, bent into an odd shape that Steve can’t identify.
“I just told him the truth,” Tony says. “I wasn’t sure it would be enough.”
“You love it,” Steve says, bumping Tony playfully.
“Then use those big brown eyes of yours,” Tony suggests.  “Bat your eyelashes.  Give him puppy dog looks.  I’m serious about kill switches.  We’ve got some medical history on him now and there’s nothing I’d put past those assholes.”
Since I know I might get comments about it, Steve's struggle with Bucky/James's name is written intentionally.  He's definitely trying, but it's not easy for him, and I figured it would be helpful to point this out upfront rather than you wonder if Steve is really having a hard time getting it right or if it's just me having constant brain flails.
“I’m always good,” Tony says.
Steve doesn’t hear from Tony again until almost midnight.
“I want...” James says, then trails off. Indecision flickers across his face. Whatever he wants, it’s a difficult ask. “Is Steve out there?”
“Promise,” Tony agrees.
Tony considers it. “No...”
Steve kicks off his shoes and then follows Tony into the kitchen. Tony pulls down two mugs and starts up the fancy little machine.
Team NYC bonds over food, and Team Disaster Waiting to Happen has a late night talk about first impressions.
“Bucky and Clint and Nat-- they were all dismissed from their posts, but they got to come home right away.  Honorable discharge, or as close to it as a top secret organization can give.  But someone had to take the fall, and I was in charge.  It had to be me.”
!  I always follow back and I post lots of drabbles there that don't always make it to Ao3! <3
hurt you.”
Bruce rummages in his bag, then tosses one of the bars to James.  They are down to less than a dozen so the food issues can’t wait forever, but they can definitely wait until tomorrow.  For now, Bruce moves on to pulling vegetables out of the fridge to make the stir-fry for himself and Clint.
“Not Tony Stark,” James says, finally turning his face to look at Bruce before pointing halfway up a separate mountain, a mile or so away. “Him.”
“J-E-N-N-Y,” Tony agrees.
“If anyone would call me on my shit, it was Bucky,” Steve agrees.  These memories are a new kind of ache.  Like scrubbing bleach into a wound.  A lot more painful than any broken bone. “So fine, you want to know about my healing abilities I’ll tell you anything you want to know.  Is the injury something specific?”
“I’ll be here.”
“Disappointed your boyfriend’s a dork?” Steve asks, sounding adorably insecure.
Tony squeezes Steve’s knee.  “You made the right call.”
“No.  Not at all,” Steve says plainly.  “It never once felt like home.”
Bruce can see the tension in James’s muscles as he eyes the needle in Bruce’s hand.
“Fine. You can be proud of me. Just stop making that stupid face.”
“Is this it?  The last big secret you think is too terrible to share with me?”
“Classified,” Steve cuts him off. “Seriously. I’ll tell him later, but not here.”
“It wouldn’t have to be an island,” Tony says.  “I want to buy you reasonable things.  Gas.  Hotel rooms.  Breakfast.  I want to take care of you.  That’s what I want.”
Tony’s free.
Steve reaches for the paper and Tony puts his hand on top of it, pinning it to the table.  “Leave it,” Tony says.  “I’ll get it back to Professor Armand.”
“I’m glad you think this is funny,” Bruce says, shaky with exasperation and the last tinges of fear. “You could have been killed.”
The soldier shakes his head. “That’s stupid, too. There’s a lot of stuff seems stupid now.”
"Yeah, believe it or not, I put that together," Steve says.
I mean if you’re bringing the puck by anyway, seems like we might as well.
“And that,” Tony agrees.  “I-- I have never been so sure I wanted to make something work.”
Steve gives a sad chuckle. “He may have been onto something there.”
“I more meant rolling the material up over the injury,” Bruce says. “I mean if you’re more comfortable with having them off, that’s fine. Whatever you want. The hay might be itchy is all.”
Well, that explains some things.  The anger and hostility are aimed at Howard and Steve’s a living, breathing reminder of the man.  They’ve never really talked about Howard.  Steve knows he’s pressing his luck with even a simple question, but he doesn’t have it in him to back away from the subject.  If Tony’s going to hate Steve, Steve wants it to be for a better reason than a grudge against his father.
“Warm, but probably not hot, if you can tolerate that?” Bruce suggests.  “And if you would like any of those clean clothes to change into after, grab whatever looks good to you. There’s plenty for us both.”
Tony doesn’t realize he’s on the floor until JARVIS speaks. He’s also not sure how much time has passed. Tony’s got his back to the wall and his head resting against his knees. “Sir, Captain Rogers is calling. He’s insisting I put him through.”
Jarvis is silent.  Steve hopes it’s not permanent.  That whatever Tony did that made Jarvis leave can be undone and Javis can come back and breathe life into the tower again.  Steve misses his steadying presence.
“But not for the money,” Steve adds.  “I wouldn’t accept any gifts.”
Pepper nodded.  “Me too.”
Steve’s grinning at him, and Tony takes a deep breath, and despite all the signals that Steve’s interested, he prepares himself for possible rejection.
There’s not much he wouldn’t be willing to try for Tony, if Tony would just fucking speak to him.
“Seriously?” Steve asks. He knows his face is probably lit up like Christmas morning.
Tony’s chest tightens.
So he finds the bedroom where Sam has deposited his stuff, scarfs down a Starkbar, grabs a quick shower then flops face first into bed.
“Or two-- you and I get Barton’s permission to dismantle this thing, we grab some tools from the Quinjet, and then we Frankenstein ourselves a new frame.  Or I could make separate beds. Obviously. Two beds, separated I mean. I wasn’t trying to assume.  And anything I do will be better than these bunks...”
“Maybe at first,” Bruce says. “But we wouldn’t leave you in pain. We won’t stop tweaking things until you’re entirely comfortable.”
“You’re my first,” Steve concedes.  There’s so much innuendo floating around at this point, Steve isn’t even sure which conversation they’re having.
“That’s a good sign. It probably means your healing factor is kicking in. Do you think if you closed your eyes you could get some rest?”
Three periods.
“So this is what we’re doing then,” Bruce says.  “If that all sounds okay-- Steve?  You’ve known him the longest. I don’t mean to dismiss that.”
“I never knock good intentions,” Clint says. “They’re rarer than you think.  You didn’t really get to know Phil, but sometimes you remind me of him. He was always good at this stuff. He put up with me, when I don’t think anyone in their right mind would’ve. I was a mess back then-- well, more of a mess. Phil just had this way about him that made me trust things could be okay.”
He looks at the screen and there’s a texted picture from Bruce, of Clint on the porch of the Swiss Chalet, kneeling next to a bucket of what looks like cow shit, laughing hysterically.  At the edge of the frame Tony sees the legs of who must be Bucky Barnes, standing and watching..
<3 Arrow
shoot me.  And he didn’t leave me in a holding cell to rot.  He’s a good man.  I wouldn’t tell you he was if he wasn’t.”
Bruce hears commotion in the background on Tony’s end.
If James isn’t going to ask him about the call with Tony, Bruce isn’t going to force the information on him.  Not with all the layers of guilt that lay in between.
“It could be,” Tony says.  “I guess you’ll have to join me to see.”
“You could say that,” Tony agrees.  “I wish you remembered them.  I wish I wasn’t the only one.”
The congratulations continue when they get to work. Tony walks Steve to his desk, and Bucky has coffee waiting for them. Starbucks coffee.
Steve nods, heads out to climb on his bike and replays the whole evening in his head on his ride back to DC.  He’s got clarity now, and as nice as it will be to have access to his stuff, he realizes that wasn’t even close to what he was missing in the first place.  He’s just not sure friendship is going to be as easy to attain as a warehouse full of memories.
“Fortune favors the brave,” Bruce comments quietly.
“You name drop him constantly,” Pepper laughs.  “It’s been Steve this and Steve that all week.  You didn’t think I’d notice?”
“Then he deserves better than you,” Howard says. “Because whether it’s me blackballing him with the owners, or it’s you, and your reputation, dragging him through the press, the end result is the same: You keep this up and his career is over.”
The rest of the evening passes peacefully enough. None of them are great at resting but after weeks of being away from comfort, Bruce is content to wedge himself into a corner of the sofa and catch up on world news.  Clint’s after dinner run produced a hoodie pocket full of finds-- a couple knives, a compass, a burner phone, a dozen packs of gum.  He and James sit at the table and clean the knives and dissect the burner phone for some purpose Bruce can’t quite suss out.
“Doesn’t leave the tower.  Pale as the day he was born.  Is that why you’re here?  To check in on him for SHIELD?” Tony asks, sounding displeased as he hands Steve a really horrendously green smoothie.
It’s too much. And part of him doesn’t want Steve within a hundred miles of the tower and the other part wants him there right now. Rationality is a blur because Tony just found out who murdered his parents so everyone’s gonna need to give him a little bit of grace on this one. Especially Steve. Steve who launches himself out of the elevator before the doors finish opening and skids to a stop in front of Tony on the slippery floor.
Tony listens to the brief directions and commits them to memory as he takes the elevator down half a dozen floors.
“So anyway I’m beat up and exhausted,” Clint continues, leaning against one of the bar-stools without actually sitting on it. “I’m strapped to a chair.  Cap walks in and tells Tasha they need a pilot.  I say I can fly. I was all ready to make some kind of elaborate case for myself, because let’s get real-- this is Captain America and I’m circus trash.  So I’m stuck there, trying to remember the Pledge of Allegiance and wondering where I can get a bald eagle to swear it on.  At that point I just wanted to help.  However they’d let me. Whatever it took.  But all I do is I make my offer, and Steve looks at Tasha and she gives him a little nod, and that’s it. That’s all he needed. One nod and I was on the team.”
“This is a shitty situation, and I think maybe you need to hear someone say it out loud.  It’s shitty.  It’s unfair.  And even though Barnes is doing what he’s got to do to get by, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t suck for you.  You don’t have to be infinitely patient.  Maybe yes with him, but not in front of me.”
“I’m gonna need to find out more about SHIELD when this is all over,” Tony says, eyeing the firepower they have at their disposal and then making a decisive choice.
Sir appears sober. Ms. Potts and Colonel Rhodes accompanied him home and left shortly after, at Sir’s request.
Steve hands her his StarkPad and she reads over his notes.  “You know... no matter how we play this, to Barnes it’s going to be a trap.  I still think it’s the way we proceed.  We just need to prepare for some resistance.”
Steve’s not sure what to say.  “I didn’t... I mean, it’s not like the words gold digger occurred to me exactly... What are you even going to buy me?  An island?  I don’t want an island.  I want you.  You’re enough.”
Clint’s egg is too close to the edge of the table when he reaches for the purple feathers.
“Out With A Bang!  Name of our sex tape is Out With a Bang!”
For one whole week.
“I trust them,” Steve agrees.  “I’m just hoping Bucky can, too.”
His eyes close as he brings his coffee up to his lips, and then the sigh Clint lets out after he swallows is pure filth.
“This wasn’t your fault,” Steve says, instinctively knowing that’s where Tony is going with this. “You aren’t on the team right now.”
The Hammer security team rushes toward them and Bucky, Clint, Nat and Sam for a semi-circle that only an idiot would attempt to cross.  The guards draw their guns, surrounding them.
Pick-up games. Tony’s never played in one. Even in college. Outside of scheduled hockey time, Tony was studying. It was only after college that he got a social life, and for Howard-shaped reasons, he kept it as far from his hockey career as possible.
“Oh yes, I did,” Kate says.
“Jarvis, do you count as an automated HR AI or is that something different?” Steve asks.
“I don’t need your pity,” Tony objects.
“Is that supposed to be an impression of me?” Steve asks.  It’s
They finally land and Happy’s there to meet him.  He’s clearly not happy to see his boss, but he’s willing to help Steve get Tony in a town car and then to drive them to the tower loading dock so no one will realize Tony’s back in town just yet.  Then it’s up to Steve to carry Tony into a service elevator and get him up to the penthouse.
“Fine. But don’t say I didn’t warn you. I just got off the phone with Sam Wilson. They’ve got a goalie out for the rest of the season.”
Bruce is old enough to be her father.  He might be older than her father.  But he doesn’t look at her like she’s an idiot for suggesting she can do this.  Instead he nods, like her words makes perfect sense.  Like he trusts that Kate can do exactly as she says.
“That sounds lonely,” Bruce says.
“Gee.  Constant gratitude from Captain America.  So irritating,” Tony deadpans.  “I don’t know how I'll stand it.”
“Tony?” Steve asks again.  This time more quietly.
Tony opens his mouth as if to launch into another explanation then seems to realize what Steve’s said.
“I’m not ready to go back,” Bruce says, telling the soldier something he hasn’t been able to articulate to Tony yet. “But if no one is coming, I don’t need to be in a barn. We could go somewhere else. Find something remote, with heat and a kitchen. My friend Tony is good at setting up that kind of thing.”
“The door is closed for a reas--” Jonathan starts then stops abruptly.
Tony chokes on a laugh.  “The one with Big Bird and Elmo?”
“No.  You can’t.  Stay away from me.  Stay out of this.  Stay the fuck out of my life!”
Steve’s not expecting to see anyone he recognizes. Especially not any fellow hockey players. Considering it’s Tony Stark, the presence of another pro doesn’t really bring Steve any comfort.
Still, Tony is a professional and he plasters on a smile like he owns the place (because hey, he does, yay!) and follows the directions Jarvis gave him.  Two rights, a left, and then Bruce.
Clint takes a second before he answers. “I trust that Tony will do what he says. If he tells Bruce it’s just between them and you, that’s how it will be. I guess I just wouldn’t be as sure he won’t see you as more a science experiment. Sorry, Bruce.”
“James, what is it about that shirt that’s making you twitchy?” Clint asks. “That’s not criticism or anything,” he adds quickly, putting up both his hands in the universal sign for
blow it.
“It wasn’t like that,” Steve says. “He’s not...”
“Jarvis? Can you pull up a picture of Mercy Rhodes from back when we were on the USO tour together, please?” Steve asks.
“You’re burning through the IV nutrition faster than before,” Bruce says. “When it’s all used up it puts stress on your system because your body is willing to cannibalize itself to heal you. Steve, I think we’re going to need to finish your visit later. James needs an IV and more rest.”
James doesn’t respond, just stares at Bruce like he’s sprouted a second head.
“If that’s Clint’s best, I don’t think I want to hear the worst,” Tony laughs.
You’re killing me here, Banner.  They’re not even remotely the same.
“I assume you know how to use one of these?” Natasha asks.
“Before we start, I want you to know, I’m not here to take sides. I’m not here to pull punches, either.  I’m blunt.  Pussyfooting around your issues is going to get you exactly nowhere.  Think you can handle that?”
“I think they’re cute,” Natasha declares. “No giving them a hard time.”
“Hey Jarvis?”
Steve lowers his hand. Then lifts it. Then lowers it.
Good for you. Want to get lunch some day this week?
James gives Bruce a look like he’s doing him a favor by humoring the hand on the knee plan.  Bruce doesn’t mind since he considers the side-eye from James a kind of progress. If James is engaging at all, Bruce is going to take it as a good sign.
Bruce puts his hands over the cloth Sam has applied to the stab wound and puts some weight against it as Sam maneuvers James onto his back.
Tony only sees Steve’s commentary when he glances at his own phone, and then he laughs and rolls on top of Steve to wrestle his phone away from him so he can kiss him before the group reactions start coming in. And boy do they come in.
“Wooooooooah baby,” Mae greets when she sees him.  She stops wiping down the counter to admire Steve. “You going on a hot date or something?”
Being this close to Tony’s body is making him incoherent.  Steve is feverish with need.  He moves to straddle Tony’s thighs, so he has a better angle to give him his attention.
Steve’s tone is light.  Tony’s expression is not.
“This is why Pepper and Rhodey are here?” Steve asks.
Getting James out of the Quinjet without needing to wait for him to wake is less complicated than Bruce fears. Just like Clint had suggested, they land on a remote plot of land with nothing but an old farmhouse surrounded by miles upon miles of corn.
“Done and done,” Tony says, appearing on the view screen nearest them, though he’s not looking in their direction. He’s staring intently at a holographic model of James’s arm.
Edited to add art 6/23/16
“The States it is,” Natasha responds.
“I like what you’ve done with the place,” Steve says.  It’s a little modern for his tastes but it suits Tony.
“No.  Sanitation is a lost cause,” Bruce says. “We’ve been doing our best, but it’d be a joke to worry about a sterile environment now. Do you have somewhere in mind?”
Steve doesn’t need to think to respond.  He turns to Tony.  “People have been using you for your money your entire life.  I’m not going to be one of those people.”
“The next batch should be done in a few minutes,” Tony says. “Come down to the lab. You can try one there.”
Steve’s hand hovers over a stick signed by Nick “Furious” Fury.
Steve actively tries not to use his superior hearing to gain personal information on his team when they don’t know he might be listening.  It’s pure coincidence that he's headed for the bathroom when he picks up Tony’s voice coming from a side office.  Tony sounds stressed.
“Yeah, well, I’m not great on edge either.  And stabbed or smashed-- both bad -- let’s avoid -- you dead.”
“Such a waste,” Howard says as he stands.
“No. It won’t hurt,” Tony says, with a gentleness usually directed at Dum-E when Tony doesn’t think anyone else will hear. “Hold still and this will only take a minute.”
Natasha stands up from the couch and leans down to place a kiss on the top of Steve’s head.
“You mentioned Steve,” Bruce says, bringing up the topic that had started this whole bizarre encounter. “Is there something about him you wanted to know?”
“Tony can you hack their HR system?  See what a security badge for a cleaning lady should look like?” Clint asks.
“What’s Legolas doing there anyway?” Tony asks.
Tony doesn’t reply.  He’s already lost in his thoughts again.  Less time passes this time before he makes his next guess about Steve’s intentions.
“I wouldn’t have deserved it,” Steve says.
“It’d probably do worse things to your reputation than to mine,” Tony says.
Steve’s expression softens a little.  “I think I should probably take a look at the paper before we continue this conversation or all your self-discipline is going to be for naught.”
“Like Captain America?” the security guard asks.
“Yes,” Tony says, putting down the gauntlet he’s fiddling with, so he can reach over for Steve. “That’s me. Master pet thief. What’s Captain America going to do about it?”
He sounds so apologetic that Tony feels weirdly bad for him. Especially because Tony’d gotten the joke right away. He hadn’t taken it wrong. There’s no reason for Steve to feel like he’s made things awkward.
“Every word,” Steve agrees.
Okay. So maybe Steve does have more left than what happens on the ice.
“Drink this and then maybe you can undress yourself.  Take a bath?” Steve suggests.
“I’m glad you offered him the more comfortable option,” Bruce says. “That was really kind of you.  You’re doing and saying some things that I think are really promising in terms of making a life for yourself. I don’t know if that’s an end goal of yours, but if it is-- I see a lot of hope there.”
“I love him,” Steve says quietly. “We’re together now.”
"Weren't at the top of your
“I don't know what to do with him,” Pepper sighs.  “I love him.  I spend a lot of time wanting to smack him upside the head but I love him.”
Steve takes off running toward Natasha’s last known position and God help any AIM minion who gets in his way. He gives the shield a heavy swing. He has no time for their shit.
Once he gets his way, Bucky turns off his flirty charm as quickly as he turned it on. The smile that's left behind on Bucky's face is entirely sincere.
Nevermind that the von Trapps didn’t climb any mountains en masse, as far as Bruce knows, and they most definitely took a train to Italy when they left Austria. His escape isn’t defined by its historical accuracy.
Tony’s eyes are guarded. He’s looking at the wrench in Steve’s hands and not at Steve.
Steve winks and Tony sticks out his tongue.  He takes a few steps backward so he can peel off what he’s wearing and replace it with the world’s best t-shirt and some battered sweatpants.  Steve finishes changing, too.  Tony doesn’t even try to hide exactly what seeing Steve undressed does for him.
Darcy’s been begging to meet Bruce for weeks, but Kate hasn’t been ready for that yet.  Bruce is special to her in a way that’s hard to explain and Darcy is her girlfriend so that’s special too, and it’s a lot to worry about-- that they won’t like each other.  That they won’t jive.  That Darcy won’t get what Kate sees in a platonic friendship with a man twice her age.
Bruce makes a face, he can’t help. Neither him nor the big guy like to think too much about someone hurting Clint and there’s unpleasant implications in what Clint’s saying.
Clint does look impressed. Bruce actually smiles into his beer at the visible awe on his face. There really aren’t many people who can surprise the Amazing Hawkeye.
“Oh,” Steve says.  “I didn’t realize... good for you.”
“I liked you better when you didn’t understand pop culture references,” Tony quips.
“That’s not going to fix anything,” Steve sighs.
Tony thinks about Steve’s bedroom, and the perfect model Starship Enterprise, and about this man who is not only his boyfriend but one of the best friends he’s ever had.  When he smiles at Steve it’s bright like Christmas morning.
“You can stay if you want,” Bruce offers. “I have more food. And a blanket. If Hydra comes looking for you, they’ll have to get through me first.”
So he settles for carefully lifting Tony up to reposition him to lay flat on the couch, and then wedges a throw pillow under his head.
“Not that it really has much affect on me at all, but I’m glad for you,” Bruce says.  “And technically you’re well past retirement age.”
Clint’s eyes flicker up to Bruce’s face in surprise. “Oh... thanks... that’s some faith that’s probably not deserved. But appreciated, man.”
Steve smiles at a memory.  The time Bucky’d torn out an article about Captain America from a newspaper and then read it out loud to the whole pub later that night, with a ton of colorful commentary inserted in between the facts.  Just rant after rant about Steve throwin’ himself on grenades and jumping without parachutes and generally being a dopey, shit-for-brains menace.  When Bucky’d really got going, the Howling Commandos had never laughed so hard.  Morita had fallen out of his chair.  Dum Dum had nearly pissed his pants.
Tony looks out at the ice. “Seriously?”
Not that he hasn’t spent long, long nights in ice rinks before, but he’s lost his privileges to his home ice for now and nothing else is going to be open.
On the rare occasion Steve sees Tony out of his Iron Man gear, he’s wearing long sleeves, even at the height of summer.  Any time Tony’s sleeves shift, Steve gets a peek at the bruised skin beneath.  Sometimes freshly dark and sometimes pale green and faded, but always there.
(See the end of the chapter for
“This isn’t from the battle.  It was purely recreational,” Tony continues.
The lights dim.  Hammer’s PowerPoint presentation flickers for a moment and a new set of information appears on the large screen behind the podium. There’s the sound of mass vibration and multiple dings as the same information pings to the cellphones of the assembled crowd, most of whom are either military or reporters.  Rhodey grins at Tony from the front row.
“The shirt is alllllll yours,” Steve says.  “Not kinky at all.”
“I bought her things,” Tony says.  “It didn’t work for her and it definitely isn’t going to work for Steve. He won’t even let me pay for his gas to drive up here or split the cost of his hotel room.”
2) The One Time Howard Really Hauled Off and Punched Him in the fall of 1990.
“That’s Katie-Kate.  She and Nanna are uploading Hammer’s data now.”
“Bruce is on hold,” Tony says, from where he’s standing by the window.  “He just told me--”
“We won’t leave you until you ask us to get lost,” Bruce confirms.
it's just what I do.
If he’s done his job right, Tony already knows.
“I have done so already.  I believe he is most impatient to speak with you.  He is requesting that you make no stops along the way and also that you don’t listen to the radio until he can explain.”
Bruce has an office somewhere in the building.  Tony has never seen Bruce's office, because 99% of the time, Bruce is in Tony's lab, and the lab is comfortable and there's a smoothie machine, and when Tony leaves the safety of the lab something always goes wrong.
Steve nods. “I should get going anyway. I left some dishes in the sink and if Bucky gets back before I stick them in the washer I’ll never hear the end of it.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, as Steve looks up at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Rest,” Bruce instructs.  “I’m not going anywhere.”
“You could try asking Jarvis for help,” Bruce suggests.  “That’s what I do when Tony’s busy.”
The following Saturday, Dr Gerber seems proud of them.  Nothing gets resolved, but the equality question is now an “Area of Awareness” and that’s supposedly a big step forward.
They take Tony’s crazy expensive car to his crazy expensive house that has a state of the art ice rink and even a zamboni. A
“I really hate those assholes,” Bucky complains. “They have plenty to say about Stark’s drinking, too, like it’s any of their business. You gonna see him again?”
“I know you don’t like being handed things,” Steve counters.  “Which is why I’m not handing you this.  I’m holding it out for you, so you can see and then explain.”
“No,” Tony insists.  “I’ve never cheated.  That’s what I’m trying to say.”
“Nothing to worry about,” Bruce says, since James’s forehead is wrinkled with the effort of staying calm. “This is just like out on the porch in Switzerland.”
“Bucky was such a shit,” Steve says.  “And just the best-- the best friend I could have ever asked for.  And on the phone just now, that wasn’t some guy named James talking, it was Bucky. I
When the doorbell rings, Tony has to force himself not to jog for it. He walks, like someone who hasn’t been picturing this moment for the last 24 hours, and opens it casually.
“Can’t get me on the road fast enough?” Steve asks.
“We’ll do that,” Clint says.
“I’m sure he’s fine. What’s that quote about letting sleeping bears lie?” Clint asks.
“Okay, so I don’t miss the yelling,” Steve agrees. “But the other parts. Seeing you around. Bringing you breakfast. Knowing you’ve got my six out in the field. I miss all of that.”
Bruce leans back on his elbows and watches the sun filter through the leaves. For the first time in a long time he thinks about Betty. He remembers picnics under maple trees, and giggled promises, and warm summer wind. The romantic feelings are gone now, but the memories left behind are good. Thinking about her doesn’t sting like it used to. Bruce doesn’t recall when that changed.
“And somewhere that isn’t going to trigger him,” Clint adds. “He doesn’t like chairs, that’s for sure.”
Steve takes a seat at the table at the third computer.  “I think it was something like ‘Clint’s a delicate snowflake and we should all be extra careful we don’t ruin him’?”
“I leaked the security footage of her singing Oops, I Did it Again at the office Christmas party,” Tony says.  “To Entertainment Tonight.”
Tony’s expression grows skeptical.
Tony finds the stairs to the basement in the kitchen, and then follows them down to look for the fire extinguisher.  The basement is unfinished, with a concrete floor and cinderblock walls.  There’s a washer and a drier that have seen better days, and there’s a garden hose rolled neatly off to the side.  But what gets Tony’s attention is a huge, old-fashioned safe, sitting locked in the corner.
<3 - Arrow
It takes them an hour to get locked and loaded and another hour to drive to the set-up point.  Nanna and Kate have taken Kate’s purple Volkswagen and the rest of them have piled into a van that Bucky explains he keeps stored in a garage nearby.
“Almost four.”
Clint lets out a slow breath and picks up his fork. “You and me both.”
“Sounds good,” Bruce confirms. “Otherwise, how’s your pain level?”
Tony doesn’t look back as they return to the stairs, and this time they walk all the way up to the roof.  Tony’s a little winded when they get to the top but Steve’s fine.  Steve’s always fine everyone knows that. (It’s his thing.)
“Would you at least be willing to talk about how you’ve tried to achieve relationship equality in the past?” Dr. Gerber asks, powering through.
“You can get through this,” Steve says.  “I know you can.  We’re going to try and breathe together, okay?  In-two-three-four, out-two-three-four.  In-two-three-four, out-two-three-four.”
“Yup,” Tony replies.
There's a pause and a deep intake of breath. Tony can picture Steve in crystal clarity, setting his jaw stubbornly as he plows through the painful words ahead. "But then-- I mean, you know now obviously-- he’s alive. He’s some assassin fairy tale called the Winter Soldier. And then before I knew he was alive, I saw some information on a screen that might connect him with your parents. But Nat and I were at an old Army base and about three seconds later Hydra was blowing us up. I haven’t had the chance to sort it out yet-- I’ve been in the hospital-- and all Nat could find me was one old file-- It’s mostly in Russian--”
Jonathan doesn’t need to be told twice.  He drops the keys and dodges around Steve, running from the room like Steve might change his mind.
“Agent Romanoff was more than happy to give you permission to dismantle the bunk bed.  In her words, ‘Knock yourselves out and try not to catch the house on fire”.
Once they’re all (probably) safely out of harm’s way, Steve takes charge.
Bucky gets a scan of his knee and Tony introduces Steve to the No Judgement Zone.
One week. Tony waits one week to hear from SHIELD after the triskelion falls. When he does, it’s nothing official (because there’s nothing official left) (SHIELD is ash and rubble) (SHIELD is Hydra) it’s Maria Hill showing up at Stark Industries looking for a job. They hire her, of course, because Pepper’s not stupid and also because Hill is good people and Stark Industries can desperately use good people right now.
“Thanks?” Steve asks. “I think.”
“You mean a real therapist would have told James to stay away from scissors and left him with about as much dignity as a kindergartner who can’t wipe their own ass. That’s not going to fix him.”
“Tony sent this a couple of weeks back,” Bruce says. “Did you know?”
"Probably better than being stuck with me," Steve says, "But here I am, if you ever want to get to know me."
James nods, and Clint shifts up to sit closer to him.
“Obie hired you?” Tony asked.  He hates how his voice pitches slightly on the man's name.
GOOD.
“Jarvis is working on it,” Steve says. “I just didn’t want it to catch the two of you off guard.”
Steve scoops up Natasha in his arms and prays he’s not making her injuries worse. He runs the six blocks to the nearest hospital at a sprint. Jarvis must have sent word ahead because there are already nurses and doctors waiting for Natasha’s arrival with a guerney. The nearest doctor explains that Clint’s there already and being prepped for surgery. Still alive. Expected to live.
.   I will totally follow you back and then point shiny things toward you and yell LOOK AT THIS SHINY THING.  LOOK AT HOW SHINY AND PRECIOUS IT IS.
Tony shakes his head.  “Doesn’t feel like I did much really.  For the most part I was just along for the ride.”
,” Tony says, drawing out the word in a way that makes it sound pleasantly filthy.  “Tell me the truth.  Have you or have you not watched my sex tapes?
“Why?” Steve asks.  “You got something in mind.”
Sam’s voice is an ocean of calm. It helps.
Back at the barn, Bruce had shown the texted address to James and figured they’d use a map to find their way, which would have at least given Bruce somewhere else to focus.  They don’t need a map, though. James may be hobbled but he’s walking with purpose. He absolutely knows the way.
who is amazing and who is often available for commissions.  I highly suggest checking them out!!!
“Did you miss that on purpose?” Howard hisses. “Or did I just raise a loser?”
“So there are hopes?” Bucky asks.
“You don’t want my thoughts on this, Cap.”
“Sounds fun,” Steve says.  “How’s Dr. Banner doing?”
He’s so emphatic about it, it’s practically an accusation.
He tries to say it offhandedly. Tries not to let it slip how much this idea appeals to him. Steve’s the only person he’s told this. And as soon as the words are out of his mouth, Tony flinches because he’s waiting for the disbelief. Waiting for Steve to explain why this is a shit idea. Except Steve’s face only brightens.
Everything goes smoothly right up until the moment Clint snips the scissors shut against the first lock of hair. James is on his feet in an instant. The bench slams backwards into the wall with enough force to split the wood and splinter in a dozen directions. James doesn’t take off running. Instead he stops at the edge of the porch, and Bruce realizes somehow James now has the scissors in his hand and he’s holding them like a deadly weapon.
“Let me buy you a milkshake,” Clint says, reaching down to pull at Steve’s arm in an effort to get him off the ground.  “There’s a place down the street that named one after you.  They put a whole piece of apple pie down in the blender with the ice cream.  It’s awesome”
“Then why did you come to California?” Tony asks.
“It wasn’t a short joke,” Steve defends. “I’m enjoying myself. This deranged racoon thing you’ve got going on, Where you’re digging through the pantry and hissing under your breath every few seconds, is the best thing to happen to me in weeks.”
He shakes his head.  Rhodey obviously doesn’t understand it any better than Steve does.
“Sam and I will handle it,” Natasha says.
soldier, sounding like a kid. James doesn’t want pain. He’s afraid of pain and it’s thick in his voice and written all over his face. Bruce can tell from the change in Tony’s expression that he sees the fear there, too.
“It’s meant to be easy to digest,” Bruce says conversationally, as if this isn’t one giant mind fuck unravelling around him. “Should taste like lemon. High calorie. And it has enough fat that it will kind of... slide down. Ummmm... won’t induce thirst, and shouldn’t upset your stomach. Maybe. I haven’t let myself get thirsty enough for it to matter. But here--” Bruce reaches back into his bag for one of the two bottles of water he keeps refilling from a nearby stream. He rolls it to the soldier. “Just in case.”
“Okay,” Steve says. “Yes. As long as it doesn’t involve watching my team play hockey without me, I’m in.”
Clint brings up Tony right away.
Tony strongly considers quitting his job, right there on the spot.  He can retire, make Pepper the CEO, no longer be Steve’s boss, and then all the HR objections in the world won’t stop him from dating this man.  That feeling only increases as Steve takes out his phone and takes a damn selfie with Tony’s bots.
“I thought you must have gotten bored,” Tony says, looking up at Steve’s return.
As Bruce hears the water begin to run he’s distracted by a knock at the door.
Steve received on the helicarrier.  But Tony knows he might as well be punching the wind.  Steve’s got that backed-into-a-corner look in his eye and nothing good will come from a confrontation. Not when he’s like this.
Bucky’s recovery takes half the summer. He’s met Tony a dozen times, but always because Tony’s come to his and Steve’s place. Usually with food (which makes Tony a decent catch in Bucky’s opinion). Today, the whole crew is going to Tony’s rink to play hockey. It’ll be Bucky’s first time back on the ice.
“He’s not that bad,” Steve objects.
She opens the folder in her hands, takes out a single sheet of paper and slides it toward him.
“Twenty points if you punch Hammer in the face,” Bucky adds.
“Text from Clint.  I’m headed to Switzerland.”
Steve moves back to Dum-E for take three and hands the robot the phone. “I think we’ve got this.”
Clint takes the post-it and raises it, waiting for Tony to give him a slight nod before pressing it to Tony’s chest.
Tony takes a step toward his bathroom.
dogs?”
“You want me to talk to Stark?” Clint asks, taking a seat beside him.
Clint gives a slight nod.  “I’d consider it a personal favor.”
Tony runs his fingers over the soft, worn fabric and feels a tightness in his chest.
James collapses in a bloody heap.
100 - Get Steve Laid (No prostitutes.  No sex tapes.) (This is disgusting.   Worth ZERO points.)
“You don’t even go here!” Tony retorts.
Scale of 1 to Hulk?
“It’s great,” Bruce says. This awkwardness is the part where he fails at friendship. “Exactly what I needed.”
SNIFF HER.  I MUST KNOW.
“Shut up,” Steve objects with a smile, then hip-checks Tony lightly just to be a brat.
Steve got to the closet, and with no prompting whatsoever from JARVIS, smoothed his hands over the blankets and chose Ana’s quilt.
He watches as Sam and Nat file inside and Clint wobbles to his feet to wait for Bruce and James as Bruce guides them toward the porch.
“Absolutely.”
“Make an incision between the 8th and 9th rib on his left side,” JARVIS replies, with the blessed brusqueness of an artificial intelligence unmoved by the tragedy of it all. “Three inches wide, two inches deep.”
Who isn’t in his office.
For now, it’s the best he has to offer.
Tony lets Steve get all the way to the door, before he speaks.
Steve can see immediately why the press would run wild with the photos.  In the first, Tony’s got his arm around an attractive man in his mid-twenties and they’re rushing out of a ritzy hotel Steve doesn’t recognize.  In the second,  Tony’s ushering the same man into a car, protecting him from the photographers by allowing him to use his suit jacket for cover.  The third is a blurry shot of them inside the limo as the door is closing.  It looks a lot like they’re in an embrace of some sort, but Steve has zero doubts about Tony’s fidelity in any of these pictures.
HAPPY NEW YEAR, to you!
“I will never tell him you said that.”
“I think she’d be impressed if I could tell a Monet from a jar of mayo,” Tony admits.  “Why do you care?”
“If I had a kid do you think I’d fuck it up royally?”
“Me,” Bucky interrupts.  “And no one’s gonna believe you if you say any different.”
“That’s a good idea,” Bruce agrees. “Then both my patients can be in the same room.”
“Just a friend,” Steve says.
Steve can’t stop himself from smiling. Sure, Bucky would defend him to the death but this is the first time an almost stranger has stood up for him.
“Don’t,” Tony warns.
For a few seconds he forgets Tony is even in the room until Tony reaches over and puts a hand on Steve’s knee.
“Take the long way to the tower,” she says, giving him a reassuring smile.
“Doesn’t ring any bells. You worked for them?”
“No,” Steve says.  It would be a whole lot easier if he’d brought his shield because then he could use it to pry open the elevator and crawl up.  That would be preferable to this conversation.  But Steve’s come all this way, and he’s not a pushover even if this wasn’t the best thought-out plan.  “There’s a chance he might see me anyway.  Would you mind asking him?”
Steve watches as Tony begins to speak, though the scrolling text at the bottom of the screen explains everything Steve needs to know.
“I feel bad for him,” Steve says. “He’s a lot different off the ice. Or-- well, we were on ice, but outside a game.”
“I went to California and brought you back,” Steve says.
“Sleeping, I hope. Still in his room,” Bruce says. “Unless he left.”
“M’not,” Steve mumbles.
Hockey is supposed to be fun. Outside of Tony’s private rink it hasn’t felt fun in a long time.
There’s a minute long pause before Bruce gets his next reply.  A full minute of Bruce picturing Tony
“No. Please,” Tony says, in a sort of urgent rush. Like he’s afraid Steve’s going to bolt. “Please come in. I need to apologize. Profusely. For being a giant dick. It won’t take long.”
It’s different-- good different-- to watch Tony work with his hands.  Most of the time when Steve’s watching Tony do his thing it’s the type of science-fiction-whiteboard stuff Steve has no hope of understanding. Fixing Sam’s wings is physical, mechanic-type labor and Steve could watch Tony do it all night.
“If that’s what it takes,” Bucky says. “What do you say, Tony?”
“Great,” Tony complains. “Now on top of everything I’m gonna have the SpongeBob song stuck in my head all damn day.”
Who even knows at this point if Bucky and James are the same person? Bruce can’t say with any certainty.
“Sure,” Bruce says. “It was fascinating. Dr. Wilkes is a good ten years ahead of his time. Tony’s probably down there trying to recruit him for R and D as we speak.”
For half a minute James stares at his hands, moving his fingers one by one.
“Sex?” Clint guesses.  “Lots of sex?  Wild, acrobatic monkey sex?”
“Thank you,” Bruce says, and sounds relieved. “I know he’s going to ask-- are you interested in meeting him at some point?”
Bruce gets that.  He’s still not enamored with the method. “Before his next ‘dose’ let me take a look at the bullets. I’ll figure it out.”
Nanna walks in on the tail end of Clint’s suggestion and he freezes, like a kid with his hand in the cookie jar.
Tony's not going to have this conversation while Steve is literally on his knees and Tony’s standing over him.  So he sits.
“This is going to be an awful ride back to the city unless you brought some portable showers,” Natasha says.
“Not yet, no,” Steve says.
Tony and Steve bond over the future while Bruce, Clint and James try really hard not to set anyone off.  Which for Clint involves running around in a towel for ~reasons~.
“How come I never get a knife when you’re doctoring me?” Tony asks.
That brings a smile to Steve’s face.
“I swear I didn’t,” Bruce says. “I’m not surprised; I just didn’t expect it. I wasn’t trying to trap you or withhold information. I wouldn’t do that.”
“I still want to be an Avenger,” Steve starts.
He said he’s going to wreck your career if I don’t end this. And bench me for the season.
“Trust me,” Steve says, holding out his hand to Tony.
“And we’re wondering if a suspension might be more appropriate than dismissing Tony from the team all together,” Pepper says.  “Being an Avenger means so much to him.  More than you could ever know.”
