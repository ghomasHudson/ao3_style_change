“Can ya at least tell us what he looks like?” And with that Steve’s shoulders perked up, and he lifted his blue gaze to Natasha’s.
“See, Miss Grant I have this Victrola in the corner here.” Werner led Toni over to the corner of the room and she smiled as she took in the beauty that was a 1932 Victor Victrola Record player.
me - ” Toni smiled, watching his eyes grow in satisfaction as he heard the words leave her lips. “- Way before I went back to the '30s. You got me, Steve. I’m
“I’ll still kill them.” He told her, making his way to their bedroom. Steve flopped Toni down on the bed, laughter leaving her lips and she smiled at her crazy possessive soldier.
“You’re the one engaged to her, you big blond doofus.” Bucky chuckled, downing what was left of his beer. Toni would guess it had some mead in it, with the way the metal-armed man was swaying on his feet.
“Barnes struck gold with ya, didn’t he? Well, he’s one lucky fella. Hey, I don’t suppose you could do a neighbor a favor and come take a look at ours, could ya? Elisa is so cold-natured, and with the Winter season upon us... I just want my doll to be comfortable..” The older man rubbed the back of his neck and said: “I ain’t got much in the fund's department, but maybe Elisa could whip the three of ya up some supper, as payment?” Toni smiled at the older man and nodded towards the door.
“What is it?” Toni asked, curiosity getting the best of her as she sat up off the black leather sofa. Interested in what made the archer’s face run a ghostly shade of white.
All Steve heard was the beautiful laugh of his best friend as he drained out the sounds of Clint’s screams and Bucky’s thundering footsteps as the blond threw his last paper airplane and Bucky took off after him.
Before she could even react, the super soldier's arms wrapped around her waist, pulling her down onto his chest.
Steve got ready to break the two apart when he saw Bucky’s hand reach up to rest on Toni’s cheek. He froze in confusion as Bucky’s free hand moved to the brunette’s waist and pulled the shorter woman in for a heated kiss.
“Plus, we get to answer some fan questions,” Toni informed them. “It’ll be fun, they’ll be mindless questions - like who eats the most? Who sleeps the longest? Stuff like that, nothing like the questions we answer from the stupid media and reporters.”
“We already did that,” the short blond shrugged his shoulders, stealing a small piece of chicken off Toni’s plate before bolting out of the break room.
Toni watched as Joseph turned his head in confusion, and how Sarah ran right over to Clint, embracing the blond in another of her hugs. Welcoming him to the family.
Steve was deadly quiet, the only emotion he expressed was the coldness in his eyes. He was falling into his Captain America/battle mode, preparing to push his emotions down and out of his system.
Bucky jerked back, shocked by his own actions. His blue eyes were wide in shock as he took in Toni’s flushed appearance.
Toni heard Bucky’s chuckle and lifted her head from Steve’s neck to smile at the bigger brunet “Well, there's my sweet dish.” A groan fell from Steve’s lips as a bellyaching laugh fell from Buckys.
“Who?” Sam asked, turning to any of his fellow heroes for a clue of what the gods were talking about.
“Blond hair, blue eyes. He’s 6’4, and 240 pounds.” And with that Natasha noticed the little blond’s shoulders sag back down in disappointment, she also noticed he lost all interest in finishing his fourth slice of pizza.
“You’ll like this one. I promise.” He pulled the small bouquet out from behind his back, watching the shock grow on Toni’s face as she took in the flowers in his hands.
“I could say the same for you, grandpa.” Johnny smirked and handed him the Stark Pad. “I don’t like you. But I figured this could be your wedding gift, watch your fiancée meet your parents.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Toni said, engaging the thrusters of her suit to fly ahead of the quinjet.
“Well, that kept him alive. He was... Well, I guess suspended in the ice until we had the technology to find the ship. Steve is healthy, and happy... I think.” Toni nodded her head softly, her fingers softly resting over the engagement ring on her finger.
“Tell me about it?” Steve asked, wrapping his arms around her waist, resting his chin on her shoulder.
Toni couldn’t help but pinch herself as she stared at her reflection in the mirror. The beautiful white gown that covered her body. Designed in a white floral lace, and a sweetheart neckline giving her the perfect amount of cleavage showing - hoping she would catch her fiancé's eyes drifting down to her cleavage and arc reactor. The dress was a simple, light, ballerina style. Semi-sheer, as the back was low cut and tattooed up her bare skin with the white floral lace.
“Sometimes,” She told him, watching as the smaller man's hand settled gently over the arc reactor. “But I’m used to it.”
He turned to Maria, hoping Toni’s mother would jump to her daughter's defense. But Steve just watched as she turned her attention to the shield issued table that rested in front of her.
“Everyone grab a test tube and go lay down on the couches, it won't take too long, and you’ll be back to your normal adult self,” Bruce informed them, laying the glass tubes of pink liquid down on the table.
it, he never understood why that phrase meant so much to his Pa, it wasn’t even that good a phrase. Apparently, Steve’s pa learned it from his grandpa. So, it was a family tradition it seemed.
“Nope, I’d know those blue eyes anywhere. You, Steve Rogers, are an amazing leader,” Toni said and gave his knee a quick pat before standing to her feet. Steve turned to Bucky, his face in disbelief.
“Breath, Stevie,” Toni said softly, laying her hand down on the smaller man's. He nodded his head, bringing his left hand to his chest. “What can I do?” She asked softly, watching as he tried to regain his breath.
“Yes,” Sarah nodded her head, a small smile on her lips. “He gained well over a hundred pounds an grew a whole foot. He was as healthy as a horse.”
“He’s the only reason I question my sexuality. It’s like he’s been sculpted by God. Pepper and I have had many talks about you and your handsome fiancé.”
Steve’s gaze was set on Toni’s lips as he watched her slowly bite her bottom lip, he didn’t even hear Bucky asking him.
“Yep.” Steve popped his lips and fiddled with the graphite pencil in his hands, still looking down at the wooden table beneath his arms.
“That I am, Howard.” Steve took a seat across from Maria Stark and began tapping his fingernails on the tabletop.
“Come on, doll.” Steve reached his arm out, as a sad smile grew on his lips. “Let’s go see your parents.”
“You don’t have to tell me twice, doll.” Steve gently pulled himself off of Toni and threw her over his shoulder.
“Remember, four hours and we get married.” Toni whispered, placing a kiss to the taller man's lips. “Don’t get thrown in jail for murder please.”
“Well, anyways.” Loki turned his attention to Toni and Steve. “I wish you two the best. You have been blessed by many deities, but I would like to bestow my own on you two. If you allow that?” Steve and Toni turned to Thor, seeing the look of surprise on his face.
The only thought running through her mind was gripping that tie in between her fingers and pulling him down into a searing kiss as her other hand worked the button off his pants.
God, he missed her and in moments like this, it was even worse. Moments where he wished he was still that ninety-pound boy in his old ratty apartment in Brooklyn, cuddled up beside his girl.
Today had been one of those days where even though it had just started - you already wanted it to be over.
Toni just smiled at Steve as he strode across the dance floor and as she opened her painted red lips to speak, he sealed them with his own. Running his hands delicately down the lace that was painting her body, firming holding in his arms what was
“Sam and Clint!” Steve told her proudly, taking another sip from his water bottle. “But I would like to go see that new Robert Downey Jr movie:
I'm so, so excited to share this chapter!! It is very special to me and very soft! I hope you enjoy!
“It didn’t surprise Ana or myself knowing the genius you were, so we kept them safe. Also, an old wooden trunk that Howard was very specific about, he said the Captain had told him to keep that safe. So, Ana and I did. They’re all downstairs on my floor waiting for you and your Captain. I was also very surprised to have that new set of memories in my head as I awoke this morning.”
“I wouldn’t if I were you.” Natasha grabbed the younger boy by the back of his shirt. “Steve has a possessive streak over a mile wide.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile at two of his best friends. A small tinge of jealousy ran through his veins at their interaction. But Steve knew he was Toni’s favorite, she had told him that one night in the lab many, many months ago.
“You’re crazy! You’re insane, Toni. My work can’t compare to Van Gogh, let alone any of these Impressionists.”
Toni looked down, noticing she was still in the same clothes she got on the train with, and glancing around the bedroom she saw her two brown bags against the wall. Toni smiled, deeming those her best travel bags yet.
Bucky muttered into his hand, watching Toni grieve like he and Steve hoped no one else would have to.
“God, you’re... You’re so beautiful..” Toni smiled and turned a full circle in her dress, showing Steve her greatest assets.
“I talk about my feelings,” he grunted, irritation growing on his facial features as his eyebrows furrowed and lips fell in a straight line.
He sat Toni down to her feet, and she watched as he barreled across the room, wrapping his arms around his parents. Toni smiled as she listened to the whispers of ‘I love you’ from all three of their lips.
Chapter note: There are some threats of non-con in this chapter. If that triggers you in anyway please skip this!
“Are you guys six?” Natasha asked, picking up an orange nerf bullet off the floor, trying to hide the smile on her lips.
Steve did his best to ignore the colors of the couches and how they matched his and Toni’s superhero uniforms. Every time he saw the colors of red and blue together, he was immediately reminded of his and Toni’s relationship.
“Toni?” He asked softly, his blue eyes tearing up as he stared at her with the saddest look of disbelief Toni had ever seen.
“I’m serious,” he laughed, a carefree, weightless grin on his lips. “I would love to show you my paintings.”
Steve stayed quiet watching the smiling hot dog salesman, handing Toni a large coke, three hot dogs and a few napkins.
“Charities? Why?” Howard rolled his eyes for a second time. “Wasting my money, like she always did on those useless inventions.”
. I wanna know what makes you jealous, I wanna know what makes your heart do cartwheels in your chest. I wanna know what tv shows make you laugh, Steve... You don’t talk about yourself.. I just wanna know you better.” Toni wiped the tears from her cheeks and whispered.
“Toni, I’d have taken you to every dance we had in Brooklyn. We’da won every competition they had. With your legs and my good looks, first place easily.”
Neither he nor Toni had brought up the moment Coulson interrupted, or the whole him licking her finger as she fed him Starbursts. Steve sure as hell hadn’t mentioned that, but that didn’t mean others in the office didn’t. It seemed whenever Toni wasn’t in earshot someone was making a comment about Steve finally confessing his feelings for the receptionist. Coulson was rooting for Steve, saying something about how he already made them tee shirts that said. “I’m in love with a receptionist” and “I’m in love with a salesman.”
The feeling of his warm palm on her lower back, holding her tight to his chest as she felt his thumb rubbing small circles on her skin - snapped her out of her shock.
Just as they parted ways, Bucky caught the sight of a short-haired female, laying passed out against the brick wall of the movie theater.
Toni watched as Joseph held his wife’s waist tight to his. The way he was whispering reassurances in her ear, told Toni maybe Steve was more like his dad than she thought. Joseph's actions towards Sarah mimicked the way Steve had just comforted Toni not thirty minutes ago.
“T-thank you. Thank you both, so much.” Steve gripped the dollar bill in his hand and asked: “Are you sure?”
“No, no.” Toni tugged her arm from Pepper’s grip as the redhead pulled her away. “No, let him go all caveman, feral on Toni. Toni wants that!”
Steve and Bucky both threw concerned looks in her direction and she gave them a soft reassuring smile as she followed Daniel out the door.
Pepper and Sarah had just finished buttoning Toni into her white gown, smiles covering everyone's faces as it was t-minus five minutes till the wedding.
“Touchy, touchy. I didn’t realize Midgardians were so into monogamy. I apologize.” Loki said and began swirling a ball of green smoke between his fingers. “But if you’re ever interested. I’m always available.”
“Alright, buddy, talk to me. What’s got you in a tizzy that you stopped putting out heat in the middle of Winter?” Toni cracked open the toolbox, removing all the tools she deemed useful for the job.
“They’re very close as adults,” Natasha whispered to Bucky and then turned to the other two boys, who sat in their chairs in shock.
“Well deserved, you work way too much,” Steve commented, as his hands ran up and down Toni’s lower back.
Steve let his fist fly, hitting the older man across the cheek. Smiling at the pride building in his chest as he watched the blood and broken tooth leave Howard’s mouth.
“Midgard doesn’t celebrate treasured beauty like that?” Thor asked, looking at the confused reactions of his fellow teammates.
. Do I seem uncomfortable to ya?” He asked and softly reassured her as slowly thrusted his hips against the genius'.
“Mr. Von Doom. She’s as good as new, your crank was stuck and the arm that held the needle needed a bit of a tune-up. But, she should be back to brand new.”
After they finished their dinner, Steve threw their trash away, holding onto the large soda for their trip home. They walked hand and hand down the street, moving closer together as the cool night breeze rushed upon them.
“Does he?” Joseph asked, ignoring his wife’s protests. Toni knew the look on Joseph’s face, as she saw it on Steve’s from time to time, he just wanted the truth. Toni couldn’t believe how much Steve acted like his father when it came to family - it wasn’t at all what she had been expecting.
“Yes.” The older man choked. Tears streamed down his face as Steve continued choking him to the brink of asphyxiation. He dropped the older man to the floor, wiping his hands off on his uniform pants in disgust.
Toni whispered; confusion evident on her face as she looked toward Steve. She shook it off and turned her attention back to the god saying: “Thank you, Thor. I think?”
“You look unbelievably beautiful, doll.” Steve whispered, his blue eyes darkening as he took in the sight of his future wife in a short, navy-blue silk robe. “I can’t believe you wanna marry me...”
“Well,” Steve drew a deep breath, drying his sweaty hands off on the material of his pants. Situating his large body in the tiny chair as he did his best to get the words out of his mouth.
“What is it?” Toni asked, more interested in what he was about to say, than what the man's lips were doing.
“Good for nothing daughter, turns my own friends against me. Giving all my hard-earned money away, what the fuck else has she done? Handed CEO over to someone else?”
“Toni! Thank God, maybe you can talk some sense into this idiot!” Sue laughed, making her way across the lab to hug the shorter brunette.
“He’s a great man, Steve...” The blond pushed his face tighter against the genius’s hand and closed his eyes again.
Steve forgot his surroundings as he smiled back into those beautiful brown eyes he loved so much. Having Toni’s face so close to his, her nose a couple of inches from his own. So, close he could see the small freckles that danced across her nose, even under the makeup.
“I love you too, son.” Joseph patted Steve on the back as the two parted and smiled, pointing toward the dance floor. “Now come on, time to dance with your wife and your ma.”
“Same procedure,” Fury muttered. “Someone goes in and gets the date, then we get to fucking wedding.”
“Toni..” James’ hand cupped the side of her face and before she could even blink. His lips were on hers.
Toni chuckled as the older man spoke. She loved working with Daniel when he wasn’t on a shift at the hospital. For most of the time they spent together he was on call. While Elisa was at work, she was a nurse in the ER, Daniel told her. Toni wasn’t sure what Daniel specialized in, but Elisa had said he was the best in the country.
His Pa had called him three times stressing over his Ma’s birthday that was this weekend. Three days away, and everything was planned and perfect, but Joseph Rogers was a worrywart.
The pair was always together. When Toni was working in her lab, Steve was on his couch - sketching. When they were at SHIELD, well they both taught their classes separately, but after that Steve always met Toni right outside her classroom, and from there they went back to the tower together. And on their off days, they were always lounging around the living room, snuggled up together watching a movie, or FRIENDS.
“Glad she could do something...” Howard muttered as his gaze danced around the room. Steve took a sharp breath and clenched his fists under the table.
“Milo, nice to see you again,” Daniel said, with a genuine smile on his lips. He took his thick white-rimmed glasses in his hand, cleaning the lenses off on his shirt.
“Can we not say that word, it’s so harsh,” Steve asked, his hand running up and down the dark fabric of his jeans as he tried to clear his mind of any images of anyone sleeping with Toni. The jealousy that was stirring in his gut by just the thought of it was overwhelming.
“No, nerd fights can go on for days.” The announcer muttered as security guys followed the team closely.
“What Elisa said, adrenaline.” He whispered. “We were both coming down from it, from the high of the fight and I acted on it the wrong way. Toni... I’m so sorry.”
The Avengers jumped to their feet, turning their attention to the intruder who just appeared in their kitchen. Bucky had a blacked-out knife in one hand, his trusty Stark Industries hand-gun in the other, and Clint guarded behind his body. Sam jumped to his feet on the counter with the knife block, tucked in his left arm - ready to start throwing steak knives at their intruder. Steve had Toni guarded behind his back, hands up, ready to throw down with their mystery guest.
Steve was fighting every urge in his body to reach across this table and knock Howard Stark out. Seeing how meek and submissive he had made his wife from years and years of abuse. The way her eyes never made contact with Steve’s as she spoke, her hands staying love in her lap, her shoulders dropped, and head hung. Steve’s mind was imagining that this was exactly how Toni acted around the older man and that made Steve wanna rip the bastard's head from his shoulders.
“Who said we’re walking?” Toni asked with a smile, ignoring the confused glare from Steve Rogers, she hailed a cab.
“Save that for the honeymoon, we don’t need to see that!” Bucky shouted. Joseph smiled at the three of his children and made his way over to his second son, pulling the younger man in for a hug.
Steve flipped the locks up and opened the chest, the smell of their old apartment wafting under his nose. He turned to Toni and Bucky and waved them over. His two best friends made their way over and kneeled down beside the chest, smiling as the smell of their shared home flooded their senses.
So, that was when Bucky got the idea of dancing. He loved dancing as did Toni, it was perfect. A couple of times a week they would meet in the gym, talk, and dance their problems away. Now, it was rare for Toni to have a ‘sore day.’
“Good boy,” Joseph whispered. He looked Toni up and down and raised an eyebrow. “He take good care of you?”
“What made you decide on the red lipstick over the blue?” Natasha asked, propping her feet up on the coffee table, knocking Clint’s down in the process.
“You do know this place falls apart without you, every third Wednesday of the month when you have off. I just wanna know why you like to torture me?”
Once the wedding festivities calmed down, the newly married couple escaped the crowd and made their way to the penthouse floor - exhaustion had hit them like a truck as soon as they hit the elevator.
Toni took a deep breath, relaxing into Steve’s embrace for one more minute before she pulled away - letting her business facade rush across her features.
“So, you already have a significant other?” The host asked. The crowd went deadly silent as they eagerly waited for the captain’s answer.
Bucky threw a confused glance at Clint as made his way over to the sketchbook. Scream when his gaze landed on the page, throwing his metal hand over his eyes.
!” They heard from the front door. Steve immediately covered Toni’s bare chest with his own and pulled her face into his neck.
“Do you have to say it like that, Clint?” Steve asked, scrunching his nose up at the man's choice of words.
“Come on, Stevie, ya remember what your pa said. You gotta treat a lady with respect. Look at her when she speaks, open her door, stand up when she leaves the table. Ya gotta give her your attention,” Bucky whispered to his small best friend, Toni only catching that because of her serum-enhanced hearing. Steve turned his attention to Bucky and whispered back:
I lost Bucky. I lost my parents. I wasn’t even alive when they died, I was frozen in ice…” A broken laugh left his lips. “I’ve lost everything I’ve ever loved and if I open up again... If I..” He took deep, watery breaths, gripping her tighter to his body.
“How was work?” Toni asked Bucky, making her way to sit down on the couch as Bucky took a seat in his classic, brown leather chair.
He stood to his feet with a sigh leaving his lips. “Stevie will be home around one. I asked him to come home early today.”
“Yay.” Toni whispered, looping her hands around Steve’s bicep. “I need to get dressed first.” Steve nodded his head and began leading her silently down the hall to their bedroom.
“I’m very glad to know you love my penis, because he loves you very much.” Toni stole a kiss-off his lips.
“Alright... That’ll be a buck. If you can afford it, that is, little fella.” Toni took a deep breath, biting her tongue, trying to not cuss this man out in front of God and everyone in this lobby.
The group made their way down the hallway to Reed’s lab, and just as they got to the doors, they saw Sue and Johnny standing there with a Stark pad in their hands.
“Stoni? I can’t tell if someone just liked my name more than Steve’s or if that was honestly their only option.”
“That’s a beautiful dame if I’ve ever seen one,” Joseph said, smiling at Toni. She watched Sarah roll her eyes at her husband and flash Toni a smile.
Reality sank in, as Toni was stuck in what she assumed was the late 1930’s without any kind of identification or money. She had absolutely nothing to her name, except the clothes on her back and the shoes on her feet.
Steve jerked around, eyes raging in anger. “You didn’t cause anything you’ve been through.” The soldier fumed.
“Toni! You’re practically naked!” Bucky shouted, covering his eyes. Steve immediately held his shield in front of his exposed fiancée.
Bucky pulled the sheet off, his eyes growing wide as his mouth dropped, taking in the sight of the brown leather, pleated chair they had in their Brooklyn apartment in the late ’30s.
His Pa had told him he was crazy to have not made a move. He told him people as special as her only come around once in a lifetime, and there was no point in waiting. Especially when she was everything and more than Steve had ever dreamed of in a woman.
“Oooh, “Clint whispered as he turned his attention to Bucky. “ASL for me, Russian and Spanish for Nat. That’s three.”
“No, I live in a tower with children,” Steve said, with a smile as he looked around the room at some of the people that had become his found family.
Steve wanted to answer that question so bad, he wanted to say ‘yes, of course. I’d date her, I’d marry her. I’d do anything in the world to keep her happy.’
Getting no help from Mrs. Stark turned his attention back to Howard. He began taking long, slow strides till he was chest to chest with the smaller man.
Steve made his way across the street, flowers behind his back, smiling as Toni looked at him with curiosity shining in her beautiful brown eyes.
The team of superheroes watched as their peaceful, fun interview fell apart from one second of hesitation from Steve.
“Me? Stubborn?! Look in a fucking mirror, Barnes!” Toni yelled back, watching Bucky’s blue eyes grow darker as his lip snarled up.
“Well, you’re stayin’ here forever then, doll. Brooklyn, is your new home now - California who?” Steve watched as a blush rose to the genius’s cheeks.
Fifteen dollars in 1938 was about two-hundred and sixty-one dollars back in the future. If Toni's math was right, and it always was.
“They did,” Toni whispered and looked toward the camera in the far corner. “JARVIS lock the doors, override code Alpha-Omega-Stoni 3490.”
Another fifteen minutes passed with banter back and forth from Toni and Reed, but not in anger. No, the two were civil for the first time in their relationship and figured out when they weren’t at each other's throats they were actually wonderful friends and even better partners.
“Good, she deserves that.” And with that, Steve continued to stare at his half-eaten pizza slice on his plate.
Within ten minutes, the radiator was back on and began to heat the icy apartment. The brunette smiled down at the white radiator and gave it a pat.
“Toni... I wanna do that with you for the rest of my life.” He smiled at the beautiful woman that laid beneath him. “You’re breathtakingly perfect.”
“My son?” Sarah whispered, her bottom lip quivering as she knew this was her one chance for answers on her son's death.
“Precisely. I couldn’t channel either of the unconscious soldiers back in the tower as their minds were otherwise occupied with you.” The bearded man said as if this happened on the regular. “So, I just channeled yours and here I am. You know, Stark you should really come down to the Sanctum, we could use a mind like yours. That is if your suffocating super-soldier of a fiancé would allow it.”
“Toni, doll? What happened?” Bucky asked as Toni finished off Steve’s beer and then reached for Bucky’s.
Steve Rogers had been working for Fury Incorporated for almost six years now, and did he love it? Well… yeah, yeah, he really did.
She took in the sight of the rickety apartment with sparse, well-used furniture, and minimal decorations on the walls. Glancing down at her outfit Toni noticed she was no longer dressed in her black leggings and one of Steve’s blue, button-up shirts. But, she was dressed in a pair of high-waisted corduroy brown slacks and a long-sleeved, olive-green button-up blouse, tucked into the pants. She glanced around the room one more time and her gaze froze. Her brown eyes took in the appearance of her much,
Toni couldn’t help the shock that settled on her face. She had heard Daniel defend her skills to other people before, as they did small jobs here and there. But, he had never gotten this angry. He reminded her so much of Jarvis. Someone who believed in her from the moment they met.
“Yeah, I love them so much.” Toni placed a kiss onto his cheek, feeling the blush rush to where her lips had just touched. “Thank you, Steven.”
“The letters. Yes, Antonia, I do.” He smiled, fondly at the genius of his daughter. “At first I thought it was insane, and when I opened the first one and read the small note inside. Reading how it told me to save them because one day they would mean a lot to someone very important to me. So, I did. Also because this Captain Rogers was so madly in love with this girl named Toni, I just had to. Ana adored them as well,” Edwin winked at Toni and continued his story. “But then... Then this little girl was born, her name also Toni. A genius in every way, and as she grew up it dawned on me. The Captain - who wrote all those letters - was talking about you. You had somehow time-traveled back to him, I just knew it.” His hand closed around Toni’s with a reassuring squeeze.
“We speak all of them, every single one,” Sam informed the room, a smile wide on his lips. “So, try us, bad guys. We got it
“Interesting…” Natasha muttered. “What do you say about me and you, sparring in the gym and getting a good workout in? After that, we get massages and facials. Then wine and a movie snuggled up in your bed?” Nat suggested with a smile.
“St-Steve Rogers ma’am," he said with a blush rushing to his cheeks as he continued to look at the floor. Bucky elbowed his best friend with a laugh.
without me and you’re gonna remember that for the rest of your life. I made you, Stark. Don’t you ever forget it.” Howard’s hand rose, moving to smack Toni across the face like he did most everyday of her life.
” He growled. “You’re being fucking ridiculous.” He fumed, turning his back to her. Shoulders square and taut as he looked out over the skyline of the city.
“If he’s your son, Daniel. There’s no doubt.” The skinny man turned his attention back to Toni and raised his thick, black eyebrow. “Then who is she?”
A rush of relief ran across Steve’s face as Toni pretended she didn’t hear what had just left Bucky’s lips. Or the way Steve shifted the crotch of his pants as he waddled over to the table.
“She deserved it, everything she got she deserved it!” Steve’s hand wrapped around the older man’s neck, shoving him against the wall.
The brunet lowered the newspaper and turned up to face Toni. “How do we wanna tell him?” He asked with a sigh and began folding the paper up to set it down on their wooden coffee table.
Steve turned to see Bucky shaking his head in disgust. “Cover your eyes,” the blond told him, with a laugh forming on his lips as he felt Toni’s body shaking with laughter against his. “And watch your language.”
“Calm down, man!” She heard Clint yell, but she didn’t care about the door. All she cared about were those beautiful blue eyes that were smiling at her like he hadn’t seen her in over seventy years.
Their temp Peter Parker always took Toni’s off days and normally did an okay job. Toni had taken the younger boy under her wing, training him upright.
“It's not a bad thing, Toni. Joseph and I are the same way.” Sarah told her, a soft smile on her lips. “You two just love each other, and I’m glad. That’s all I ever wanted for my boy.”
“I don’t... I don’t know... I just, I looked at you..” His tongue swept across his bottom lip. “An' your brown eyes just..” and before Toni even realized it, his lips were on hers again. Bucky’s strong arms enclosed around her waist, backing her into the bedroom door.
“Buck! Why didn’t ya tell me she was ‘ngaged!” Steve turned back to Toni; heartbreak was written all over the older man's face. “I wanted to marry ya, Toni, I ‘eally, ‘eally did.” Steve sighed, closing his eyes in defeat.
But, that didn’t stop the feeling of regret in her gut, knowing that Bucky had kissed her and here she was not five minutes later sitting on the same bed with both of the men. God, she needed Stephen Strange to hurry up and get her the fuck home,
“Steve,” Toni whispered as the bigger man paused halfway across the room, taking in Toni’s appearance as if he was trying to figure out if she was real or not.
“Thank you, both of you,” Toni whispered, crossing her arms over her chest as she felt the chill of the living room run down her spine.
Steve growled as he remembered the way Toni’s hips danced in sweet, fluid, rocking movements back and forth on top of his groin. Remembering the way they were skin on skin, glistening softly with sweat, staring right into the others eyes as they made love.
“Fine, don’t cry. You’re not going anywhere, babe,” Toni said, opening her arms to her sensitive robot to roll into a hug.
“I’m so tired of all these damn couples!” Sam hollered, making Toni burst with laughter in the middle of kissing Steve.
“No sex, just. Just let me..” His eyes conflicted with an emotion Toni had never seen in the crystal blue before. She just nodded, letting him pull her shirt over her head, only to be replaced with his own.
Bucky yelled as he sat back down on the couch. “That’s another image I’ll never get out of my head.”
“No, but I will be.” The feeling of the smaller man's grip tighten around her waist was all she needed at that moment. Toni watched as the sky’s color slowly changed from the dusky blue to a muted orange and enjoyed every second of her smaller fiancé’s embrace. “Watch the sunset, babe. It’s beautiful.”
The couple sat in silence for a bit, just listening to the other slightly watery breath as the afternoon sun shone through the windows.
once more and grinned as he dropped his lips to her ear, breathing heavily against her earlobe as he whispered.
“It’s been a long day,” Steve muttered, raking his fingers through his messy blond locks. “Can we just go to bed and try this tomorrow.”
When Toni made it back to the table Steve and Bucky quickly stood to their feet. Seeing the obvious mood change in their genius.
“Pay the man, sweetheart," Toni told him with a soft smile. Steve reached his free hand into his pocket, feeling Toni’s cash. He brought the wad of cash out of his pocket, taking great pleasure in the admission’s man's shock.
“Come on, asshole!” Bucky yelled, grabbing his attention for Steve to then jump on the bigger man's back. Steve closed his hands around the man's eyes, applying pressure with his thumbs until he began screaming for him to stop.
“Yeah, like a list of celebrities you can sleep with. Or if you were to ever meet a doppelganger of yourself -- could the other sleep with them? Things like that.”
He picked the genius up by her waist, sealing his lips over hers. Toni wrapped her arms around the bigger man's neck and kissed her fiancé.
Steve met Erskine and went off the Bootcamp. He met Peggy and noticed how much she reminded him of Toni. She was smart and confident, just like Steve’s girl was and he thought maybe they could have had something. But, he knew he couldn’t, she wasn’t Toni. Peggy was so formal and put together and she didn’t have that quick wit, that sass that was just so.. Toni.
“Return him to me in one piece,” Toni commanded Sam and Bucky and placed a kiss on Steve's cheek. “Have fun with your friend's babe, I’ll see you in a couple of hours.”
The love in this woman's embrace was something she never quite experienced before. This Toni knew, this was what a hug from your mom felt like.
She welcomed Steve into the room, forgetting she was over seventy years into the past and that her shirt was still a bit unbuttoned.
“That’s lovely, that’s everything he ever dreamed of.” Sarah whispered, as Joseph pulled her into his embrace. “Well, that and a lot of kids.”
Toni and post-serum Steve had talked about kids before, both expressing their desire to have a little mixture of them running around in this world. But, she had no clue Steve had desired such a big family, and honestly... It warmed her heart. Both of them having been an only child, it started to make a lot more sense that they both craved that bigger family.
“Yeah, I would take the opportunity I think. It would be a really cool experience -- ya know, for science.”
“That’s because I’m marrying a man with fantastic taste,” Toni told him as he carried her back to their bedroom.
“Woah,” Bucky said. “Like fix the radio genius smart?” Toni chuckled and turned to her fellow brunette.
“Steve, there's nothing I can tell ya that I ain’t already said." Bucky threw his hands in the air, as he sat down in his leather chair. "I’m awful, I know.”
“Some stupid sorcerer, they’ve got her at SHIELD. Bruce is working on the reversal potion now. Should only be a couple more hours.” Toni sighed and ran her hand through her short, brown hair.
Steve just ran his fingers through his hair, adjusted his glasses, jumped up from his chair, and made his way over to Toni’s desk. The bigger man sat down in her black, leather chair and answered her phone.
“Those boys got so lucky,” he said, a smile on his lips. “Where on earth did they find a dame like you?”
“He’s being an ass, Stevie, just ignore him.” Natasha rushed over to Bucky’s side, trying to help him hold the bony teenage boy back from beating the pulp out of Clint.
“I.. I’ll have to go back to California eventually, Steve..” Steve rolled off of Toni's body, shaking his head in disbelief.
In reality, finally facing him; it wasn’t. She’d learned from Nicky, Edwin, and Steve that she was worth more. That she was a strong, fierce woman and that Howard Stark couldn’t hurt her ever again because Toni wasn’t ever giving him that power.
Steve Rogers had been working for Fury Incorporated for about five years. Steve liked his job; did he love it? Well... does anyone? It had its up and downs.
“So, you like it?” Steve asked, uncertainty in his eyes as his hands did a nervous dance where they joined in front of his waist.
Bucky took a seat on the end of the bed, sadness prevalent in his tone and expression. Toni looked down at the teacup in his hand and smiled at the sweet heart that her man had. He was always kind, always thinking of Toni's needs before she did, and going out his way with the tiniest sweetest gestures. He was a man that you read about in romance novels, and honest to God it was hard to believe he was real. But, he was and he was all Toni’s.
Toni held a large plate of scrambled eggs, making her way over to the table, her mind replaying the past two months in her head when it hit her. The large plate of scrambled eggs dropped from her hands and shattered to the floor. Yellow blobs of eggs and ceramic pieces scattered across the room. The steady stream of conversation grew quiet and everyone's eyes were now focused on Toni as she stood there, frozen.
“You want to talk about not remembering something! All Toni and I did was a kiss, you fuckin’ mauled her right in the living room!” Bucky announced to the room, earning a chuckle from Natasha and a gasp from Jarvis’s lips.
“Toni, I’ve watched you start a fire with just two batteries in your hands. This... This is nothing.”
Toni knew he was talented, she’d seen the beginning of his paintings of her. But, never saw a finished piece. Steve was very private with his work and Toni understood, it was one of the things he had left of himself before the serum. So, for Steve to trust Toni with this, well it just meant the world to her.
“Look! I found this genius roaming the halls! Natasha, we must do something about that, we could not have anyone else stealing her from under our noses!” Thor’s booming voice filled the room, as he walked in holding their resident genius bridal style. Steve took in the appearance of Thor and stood up from his seat.
An announcer called The Avengers out one by one, the room erupted in screams of praise as each team member took their seat on the couches.
Daniel opened the large white door, revealing the darkest office Toni had ever seen. The contrast of the brightest white house Toni had even been in. Only to enter this room to see the walls painted black, along with an ebony black hardwood floor. The furniture was all a dark green, with some silver accents throughout. Toni wasn’t sure who designed the room, but they were awful at their job.
Toni sighed, sitting down on the edge of their bed as Steve pulled off his own pants, and began to take off her sweatpants.
“Stevie, I’m serious. You know those nothing guys you see walkin’ down the street, with beautiful dames hangin’ off their arm?”
“Nope. Toni, he’s always with you.” Clint interjected. “Hard to catch a moment when he’s not with his future bride.”
“They sure have,” Toni smiled as she popped a piece in her mouth, dropping the wrapper in Steve’s trash can. The little brunette unwrapped another one, discarding the trash, and made her way back over to Steve. “I’ve told you for years, they weren’t in
He ignored her question, getting her black sweatpants from around her ankles, throwing them in the pile on the floor with the others. “I’m cold, Steve,” she told him, watching as his large hand ran down her right thigh, to the compartment that connected her prosthetic to her flesh thigh. His blue eyes looked into her own with a question. “What?” Toni asked softly.
“Ohh,” Happy muttered, as he shot Steve a knowing glare through the rearview mirror. Steve just turned his gaze to Toni, ignoring the older man's look.
“I’m ready,” he told her, standing to his feet, reaching his arm out for Toni to grab. His eyes danced up and down her form once more and as his voice dropped an octave, he whispered: “Forget lingerie, you’re wearing that tonight, and nothing else.”
“He did, as a matter of fact,” Toni told Bucky, as she snipped the ends of the stems at a slight angle, and began filling the vase half full of warm water.
“Bucky!” Steve shouted, his grip tightening on Toni’s backside as he mentioned their missing limbs so casually.
Instead of feeling scared and uncertain that Daniel somehow knew, she felt safe and comfortable. She trusted Daniel, and that was something she didn’t do very often. Toni wasn’t even quite sure how it happened, she just knew he was one of the good ones.
“Anytime, James.” And with that Toni knelt down beside her super soldier and placed a kiss on his cheek.
“Okay look, I fixed the heater and took a shower. But, then there was a knock on the door and he said he was your neighbor. So, I opened the door and he assumed I was James’ girlfriend because his nosey wife saw you carrying me here last night!” The words poured from the woman's mouth, like water out of a fountain. Steve couldn't help it as he and Bucky both grinned as she explained the events of her day. “He then asked about the heater and how you got it fixed! And I told him I did it, and then he asked me if I would look at theirs, and his wife would make us dinner. James, Steve I’m
“I thought you had the night shift?” Steve hollered after the taller man, skipping a couple of steps to catch up to his best friend.
She sat there watching as Bucky got the upper hand and knocked the asshole’s buddy to the ground. Shaking his wrist as the guy hit the pavement. He then turned to Steve as the bigger blond man went to town throwing punches to the smaller man's ribs.
“It was great, we went into Manhattan. Danny introduced me to some of his friends after we did a couple of jobs around the city.” Toni sat her messenger bag and the containers with their supper down on the flimsy kitchen table, making a note to fix that over the weekend.  “I’m exhausted.”
and with that the icy water succumbed his body, taking him from this world, and from Toni.. or so he thought.
As the man led her out on the floor he was very gentleman-like. He led her in the dance, following her steps as he should. Just as Toni thought this would be an okay dance, the guy began lowering his hands down her back.
“I ain’t known her for long, but... She’s special and pure...there’s this connection there and I really feel like we..” Feeling dumb with the words that just left his mouth, Steve kicked the pavement beneath his feet. “We’re meant to be.”
“Know what?” Toni muttered, taking a sip from their drink. Steve had to force his eyes away from watching the way her lips closed around the straw.
“So, what is it ol’ Stevie here does for the team?” Bucky asked, throwing his arm over the smaller man's shoulders.
“What?” She asked, leaving the shocked Clint’s embrace. Walking over to Steve’s desk, pulling his bottom drawer open, and grabbing four pink Starbursts from the bag.
With that Daniel led them out of the house, like he was just itching to get away from Von Doom even more than Toni was.
There wasn’t a dry eye between the three of them as they arrived at the platform, setting her bags down, chatting mindlessly avoiding the obvious. Toni smiled regrettably at the train and turned to face Steve and Bucky.
“Reed Richards, that prick who owns the top floors of the Baxter Building,” Toni asked the AI. “Thinks he owns time and space himself?”
Toni breathed as Steve dropped his assault to her neck, his right hand running down her hip, hitching her thigh up and around his waist. Quickly moving even tighter to the brunette's body.
“Together, doll. Together.” Steve repeated back, watching Toni pick up her bags as the tears continued to spill down her cheeks.
Steve laid back against his blue pillow panting, as he failed at trying to calm his heartbeat down from the events that had just taken place. Toni’s head laid against his sweaty chest as a soft giggle escaped her lips.
“Oh, I will, don’t you worry. Anyways, enjoy your time left with the Brooklyn boys. I’ll see you in two days.” With a could sparkly hand movements, Strange sent a wink her way and disappeared.
No, she grabbed his hand right before it made contact with her cheek. His eyes staring wide in shock at the events that were about to unfold and the strength his daughter had over him.
She softly turned to face her smaller fiancé, seeing the same beautiful blue eyes that reminded her that she was always safe when he was around. And seeing Steve with a bloody lip and the light purple of what would become a black eye reminded her just how true that feeling was.
“A hero,” Toni whispered, a weak smile on her lips as she watched Joseph Rogers' eyes begin to water as he held his crying wife.
You guys should have said something. I’d love to have a guy’s night!” Toni chuckled and felt Steve place a quick kiss on her cheek. “Thanks, doll...” He turned his attention to the guys and said: “So, what’s the plan fellas?”
“Toni? Babe, are you done --” His words dropped off mid-sentence as his eyes raked down her body in a-line dress and apron. “Oh
“You don’t know the half of it.” He drew a deep breath and danced his eyes around Toni’s personal calendar on her desk. Seeing Fury’s meetings, his and hers scheduled lunches, and the third Wednesday of the month just had a little apron drawn in the square. Steve never knew what that meant, and never wanted to ask as Toni wasn’t big on talking about personal things. But she had her moments.
“Steve,” She chuckled, running her fingers through his blond hair, her nails slightly scratching his scalp.
Toni brought her hands to her face, covering the smile that had grown on her lips as she watched Steve slur his words. She actually felt sad for the bigger man, as she saw the look of heartbreak in his glassy eyes.
“Clothes? What clothes?” Steve grunted as he stood to his feet. He shucked his shirt, pants, and boxers off his body - letting them fall, forgotten to the floor.
“I can, I just got paid. Let’s go. You’ve never seen a Van Gogh or a Monet in the flesh and that’s gonna change today,” Toni handed Steve one of his black jackets as she pulled on his brown leather one for herself. Smiling confidently as she knocked him speechless, his blue eyes raking over her body. Taking in the sight of Toni in his favorite jacket.
Just as Toni was about to step out of the room, to give the family some privacy she heard Joseph speak: “And where do you think you’re going little lady?”
“Bucky, stop it. It’s not all your fault.” Toni began climbing out of the sheets to move closer to the bigger man.
They stood in front of the Monet for another hour, just embracing each other. Taking in the beauty that was Toni’s favorite painting.
“Umm...” Steve brought his hand up and scratched the back of his neck as he looked around at his teammates. “I don’t really have one?”
“No, you idiot.” Toni pointed to the sheet. “Take the sheet off!” The brunette made her way back over to Steve. Wrapping the bigger man's arms around her waist, as she laid her back against his chest.
“Get the information and get out. Howard is gonna go back to the past where he belongs, never to bother anyone ever again.” His brother told him, placing his metal and flesh hand on Steve’s shoulders. Doing his best to center Steve away from his anger and panic. “I know you wanna kill him, we all would give anything for a shot at Howard. But we can’t, you’re getting married.”
“We are going to get suited up, meet you at the coordinates.” Clint said, placing a kiss to her cheek.
Toni. Don’t listen to him," Natasha told them, patting the taller man on his back, running her eyes over the drawing one more time. Her green gaze lingering on the thick muscle definition of Toni’s thighs. Steve smiled as he watched the red-heads pupils slightly dilated at the image in front of her. “Steve, good catch.”
As their walk came to an end, the couple made their way up the apartment steps. Arriving at the door, they heard Bucky rattling around in the kitchen.
“Calm down, punk.” The brunet drew a deep breath, having the smaller blond mimic him so Steve didn’t have an asthma attack right in a back alley in the middle of winter. “We’ll bring her back to the apartment.” Bucky picked up the smaller brunette into his arms, holding her close to his chest to try and bring up her chilled body temperature. Bucky watched as Steve took off his own brown leather jacket and laid it over the chest of the passed-out dame. “Put that back on. I can’t have ya gettin’ sick again.”
“Wait, the boy who’s about fifteen years older than you. Who you always beat in competitions and he was nothing but nasty toward you?” Edwin asked Toni.
“Well, Mr. Rogers. You are the Captain of the Avengers. You lead us, and I’m your right-hand man.”  And with that Steve’s jaw dropped, and everyone in the room fell silent.
“There’s tha pretty lady.” The man hollered, his harrowing voice-only making Toni lean closer into Steve’s protective embrace.
“Trust me,” Steve made his way across the street, being careful of the few cars that passed. As he approached the flower stand, he saw the lady smile and the older man raise his eyebrows.
“Down Pa, he’s just a punk sometimes.” Bucky muttered, smiling at the Rogers family. Sarah and Joseph turned to face Bucky in shock.
Steve locked his jaw, throwing Toni a fierce glare that meant, ‘leave it alone.’ Toni stood to her feet, placing her hands on her hips as she made her way over to Steve. He never gave up on her, and Toni wasn’t giving up on him.
“What Stevie said,” Bucky cut in, pulling her from her thoughts. “In good conscience, I can’t let a beautiful dame like yourself back out there with nowhere to go and no money on ya,” Bucky took a seat in the beat-up, brown leather chair that sat five feet away from where Toni was standing beside their sofa.
His blue eyes begged her to jump in and save the day. But apparently, it was too late for that, because one side of the room had stood their feet, screaming Stoni. While the other side of the room shouted WinterIron and Stucky.
Entering the cold, gray interrogation room he saw Howard pacing in front of a steel table. Gray littered throughout his hair, and more wrinkles on his face then Steve ever remembered. The older man looked at him with shock written all over his expression. His pacing came to a quick halt as he turned his full attention to The Captain. Steve flashed Maria a smile and crossed his arms over his chest.
Steve did indeed start to drool when Toni made her way back up to the rooftop, dressed in her wedding gown.
“Yes, that is true. Thor likes to steal them the most, but he’s not very stealthy so it’s easy to catch him.”
“Bullshit, Rogers.” She glanced down at the next page of his sketchbook, smiling at the drawing of her and Bucky sitting at the table playing cards. “I mean..” Toni nudged his shoulder with her hand and said: “You’re no Monet... But, you’re amazing.”
“I’ll be alright for now, as long as I stop walking in on these love fests…” Sam took a long sip of his soda and turned to Steve in curiosity. “But anyway, what’s happening here? Besides Steve and Toni being disgustingly in love?”
Toni couldn’t even begin to put into words what this painting meant to her. The fact that it was some of her most treasured things all in one: Steve, their flower, him holding her, her red lips, the memory of them in the MoMA and so much more. Steve had given her the most perfect gift.
They made their way back into the living room and saw Pepper and Natasha on their phones. telling whoever was on the other end of each of their phone calls that things were changing, and they were gonna make it work. Toni feared for the businesses who dared to cross Natasha Romanov and Pepper Potts.
“Hi, are you here to tell us where we are?” Sarah asked softly. Toni watched the gentle mannerisms of Steve’s mom, as her blue eyes were filled with worry.
The bridge rested across a small river, with white roses growing wildly around them - framing the two as if they were the center of the universe and not just this painting.
“Together,” Steve promised with a soft smile on his face at the idea of being with Toni, starting a family with Toni, and just being happy - together.
I loved posting this story and all y'all's comments made it worth writing!! Thank you for loving this story and Steve and Toni!! I can't wait to share more of their adventures together!!! Now as a married couple!
“Go to work, Buck.” Steve pushed the bigger man out the door, closing it behind them taking the two men out of sight.
, are you gonna undress at all during this?” Steve smiled against her neck as he successfully got her pants undone with minimal struggle.
Steve took a deep breath as he opened his bedroom door, revealing Toni sitting on the bed, folding her clean clothes that sat in a messy pile on the foot of the bed.
“No, no it’s perfect up here,” Bucky whispered, running his flesh hand over the scratches that littered the arms of the chair. “Thank you, Toni.”
Steve nodded his head softly, and kissed her lips, mumbling: “I like that idea..” Steve led the genius to their room as Toni smiled sadly at her good friend.
Once the masseuse exited the room, the two heroes got undressed, and climbed into their beds, enjoying the feeling of the heated sheets on their bare skin.
“You’re very special to me, Steven.”  Steve smiled and opened the door, greeted by the warmth and smell of their home.
“Steve?” Toni asked softly, her small hands resting gently on his chest. The younger man turned his attention to the short-haired brunette and smiled.
,” Bucky threw a weak smile at the shorter woman. “Yep, I sure got lucky with this one right here.” Bucky crossed the distance between him and Toni, placing a lingering kiss on Toni's lips.
As the song came to an end Steve could hear the pants, from both Bucky and Toni’s lips. Toni sauntered her way over to Steve, her red and blue prosthetic - barefoot leading her steps.
In four hours, Steve and Toni would by law, belong to the other. In front of God and everyone they loved.
The smaller man's body stopped pulling to get away from Bucky and Natasha's grip and fell into Toni’s embrace.
He stared for a second or two more. Then it was as if he snapped out of a trance. Steve brought his left hand up to cover his eyes as he kicked the door closed behind him.
And she absolutely loved this dress. Edwin, Fury, Natasha, Pepper and Clint had all gone with her to pick it out and she knew when she walked out of the dressing room to a teary-eyed Nick Fury and Edwin Jarvis that this was the one.
“You’re a sweet-looking dish.” She hollered across the station, smiling as the man rolled his eyes when Toni recalled his compliment from one of their many evenings spent together.
The brunette jumped to her feet, slamming the chest closed in shock. Brushing the imaginary dust off of Steve’s borrowed pants, and quietly made her way to the front door.
“Enjoy the rest of your miserable life, Howard.” Toni told him, a confident smile on her face as a blue cloud appeared over them and they both disappeared from the room.
“Remember," He muttered, looking back at his drawing that rested delicately in Toni’s hands. "I went with you the other day, as you were fixing the lamp for the Russmans down the hall.”
She made her way into the apartment seeing Steve, sitting at the wobbly, wooden table sketching in one of his notebooks.
“White is...special,” Toni told Bucky as she sat the roses in the center of the table. Steve smiled at Toni and nodded.
“Yes, he plans on being a Trauma surgeon. He’ll be a damn good one at that.” Toni smiled at Daniel as she listened to him talking about his son, and how he supported his dreams. She only knew what that was like because of Jarvis. Toni could never imagine Howard saying anything of the sort. But, Toni was glad Nathaniel had such a great father in Daniel.
Toni grabbed the bigger man by the back of his shirt as he took off after two of his best friends. She pulled him back, spinning him around, and laying her head on the center of his chest.
Four hours till she walked down the aisle - Toni, Clint, Pepper and Natasha were all curled up on the sofas in the living room, hair and makeup done. Their last step was pulling their dresses (suit for Clint) on, hopping in the elevator, and making their way up to the roof of Stark Tower.
Toni shrugged her shoulders, and said: “I dunno, I just guessed.” She went right back to eating her own hotdog. Steve smiled at the brunette, thinking of how kind she had been this whole evening. Not even to just Steve. But the cab driver, the hotdog man, all of it. She was one of the kindest, most beautiful souls he’d ever met.
“Because we are real-life superheroes!” Bucky told him, smiling down at the small poster that sat in his hands of a comic-style drawing of the team.
“For one, it’s the third Wednesday of the month. The day the life of the office leaves me, and of course, everything decides to break. The coffee machine blew up as soon as Clint plugged it in. No one knows how to fix the copier or even knows what’s wrong with it and Clint’s even more annoying than normal not having you here to throw paper airplanes at.”
“Why doesn’t he just fuck you instead.” Toni shrugged her shoulders. “Save me and everyone else in this office from the disgusting sexual tension between you too.”
“Okay!" The announcer shouted, snapping Toni and Steve out of their stares. "Captain America, who’s your celebrity crush?”
Toni flipped through the pages, seeing sketches of Bucky in his favorite leather chair. Some drawings of the streets they lived on, some beautiful sketches of the sunset from their balcony, and some of the movie theater that was right down the street.
The serum-enhanced couple spent the next couple of days wrapped in the other. Steve slowly began to open up to Toni, starting to share the small things about himself, and Toni loved every second of it. The two were connecting on a level neither even knew existed. It confirmed everything Toni thought that evening on the balcony of Steve and Bucky’s old apartment. They were made for each other in this time period. They were made to help stitch back the other’s broken pieces and fill the ones that were shattered. They were made for each other.
“Yes- Yes ma’am, he did - " Steve muttered. Clint rolled his eyes, sitting up further in his seat, cutting the shorter blond off mid-explanation.
The bedroom door creaked open, pulling both heroes' attention over to the door to see half the face of a blond super-soldier, peeking in the bedroom.
“Okay, fellas, dinner is served.” Toni had laid the containers on the table for tonight's dinner and placed the other three in the fridge for meals over the weekend. “Umm, eat,  boys,” Toni said, holding a dishtowel in her hands. She took in the dark glaze of Steve’s blue eyes and shook her head, making her way over to the table to take her seat. Toni was going to eat, they didn’t have to, but she was hungry.
Steve’s gaze fell to the genius that was seated to his left; he watched as her brown eyes grew in wonder at the words the god had just spoken.
Her mind ran through the events she’d lived through the past two months. This taste of domestic life here with Steve was something she’d never experienced before. No one knew who she was, no one faking a love or like for Toni just for her family name or trying to get something from her. No one trying to kill her for her father's legacy. No villains with stupid agendas. This right here, this was what it felt like to have a normal life. But, as much as Toni loved it, as much as she loved the simplicity of her life with Steve. She knew it was coming to an end. That this life here in 1930 something, wasn’t forever.
“Enter!” They heard a booming voice. Toni took a deep breath and tried to prepare herself for who was on the other side of that door.
It was a silent walk to the interrogation room. None of the men wanted to speak because well - no one wanted to be here right now. They wanted to be in Toni’s tower, getting ready for the wedding.
“I’m... I mean I’m probably a behind-the-scenes kind of fella.” With that, he joined his shaking hands into his lap and turned his attention back to the floor.
As the black town car came to a stop, on Fifth Avenue and fifty-seventh street, Toni grabbed fifty cents out of her pocket and handed it to the driver. His eyes grew wide as Toni handed him money. As if he was expecting it to be coming from Steve.
. Loki literally threw her back seventy years. She won’t be interacting with an alternate you. She’ll be interacting with
“It’s not disgusting, Clint,” Natasha said with a smirk as she placed a kiss onto her girlfriend's lips. “It’s hot.”
I can't wait to share the rest with y'all!! A lot on the horizon for Steve and Toni when they get back home.
“No, don't you dare!” The smaller blond sighed, crossing his arms over his chest. “I’ll get over it. I’m the maid of honor, fuck them.”
“If I open up.. If I share myself with someone else.. I’m so scared they’ll be ripped right from my grasp. I’m so afraid to be alone again. I hate it,
“We found you passed out in the alley beside the theater... We brought ya back here, to keep ya from freezin’ to death... My name’s Steven Rogers. We don’t mean ya any harm, miss.” The short blond said, an uneasy smile resting on his lips.
Steve pulled away from the genius, the palm of his hand wiping across his forehead as if he was wiping imaginary sweat off his forehead. “Whew! Tha’s good news!”
The days after Toni left dragged by. Bucky and Steve both noticed the emptiness in the apartment without their lively genius bumbling around.
“Steve?” Toni’s voice broke as tears stung her eyes. Worry for her fiancé overriding her every emotion.
“Or when you’re dancing, God, doll when you dance..” Steve brought his hand up and cupped it alongside Toni’s jaw. “Especially with me, when you dance with me. Even though you’re ten thousand times better than I’ll ever be. The way you trust me to guide your steps. The way you trust me, Toni.” He shook his head fondly. “The way you trust me with your life, with your future, with your body - that makes my heart do cartwheels.” Toni sealed her partner's lips into a kiss, before laying her head back down on his chest. Her heart was full of joy as Steve had just begun opening his heart to her. The two laid wrapped in the other's embrace for a while longer before Steve spoke again.
“Oh, right… Miss Toni, do ya need any help?” Bucky asked instead, placing his hands in his jean pockets.
“Steve Rogers, if you don’t bring that massive dick of yours over here right now... I’m gonna scream.” Steve couldn’t help the blush that rushed his cheeks and he looked down at his large, throbbing member.
Steve’s legs crossed one over the other in the shape of a pretzel as Toni sat atop his lap. Her thick muscular thighs, wrapped around his waist like his back was a tree trunk as her arms wrapped loosely around his neck. She had told him it was called the ‘Lotus’ and it had become one of his favorite sexual memories from the ’30s.
“I don’t think your possessive man ever left. From what I remember Steve almost killed Clint in the kitchen,” Sam informed them, through crunches of cereal.
Toni had a couple herself back home in the tower, having grown up with Maria Stark and Edwin, music was very big in her house when Howard wasn’t around. Maria would play Toni a Beethoven record and then begin to teach her how to play it on the piano. Where Edwin stuck to Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin. Who Toni grew to love immensely and learned to play it for Jarvis on the piano as well. Now, Ana’s taste surprised Toni most of all, she was a very classy woman, always dressed to the nines, never a hair out of place.
Toni’s desk was about eight feet away from his, and he could sit at his computer, dance his eyes slightly over the top of the screen and watch her answer phone calls as she bit held the eraser of a pencil between her lips, accepted packages, and helped out her fellow employees.
Toni heard a few beeps of disappointment and then the crashing sound of Dum-E dropping the fire extinguisher on his collection of things in his cubby. His cubby was in the corner of the lab. That was where he charged and stored his favorite things. It was like his bedroom if robots had their own bedroom. The corner room, Dum-E’s room, was full of things like fire extinguishers, tennis balls, and the artwork Steve drew for him.
“Come on, dollbaby,” Steve whispered. “Let’s go home.” He wrapped his arm around her waist as Bucky led them out of the bar. No one speaking as they had never dealt with Toni like this before. She was always bright, confident, and full of energy. Never this meek and closed in on herself.
Toni turned her attention to her super-soldier, her eyebrows raised in shock as she listened to the words that left her fiancé’s lips.
When Toni answered the call from Fury, she should have known something wasn’t right. She should have been out on that mission with the team, she knew that. Stupid, Stark Industries board meetings. Those old bats don’t need her in every meeting anyway, Pepper is the CEO, not her.
Toni walked out from behind her super-soldier, looking the dark-haired god up and down. “What can we do for you Loki?” She asked, crossing her arms in front of her chest.
“Get out!” Sam yelled, throwing a handful of popcorn on the pair of superheroes on the sofa. “Get out! I’m trying to watch Danny Tanner drop Michelle off at preschool, and I wanna cry with the man in peace!”
Toni sucked her teeth and gave her blond a soft reassuring smile before whispering their promise one more time.
“You’re not awful, Buck..” He said with a shake of his head. “You were jealous of me, you were jealous of me. That’s something new for both of us.”
“Come on, let’s go see what she did.” Steve told him, shrugging his shoulders when Clint mouthed ‘What is it?’
Toni froze as she took in the bright white of her spare room.
