"Because that was our deal, remember?" Tony glanced at him over the envelope as he ripped the top, picking up a folded sheet from inside. "And if you haven’t gone through with praise in your finals, no fighting crime with the Avengers for you."
"Say whatever you want, to whoever you want, Robin Hood," Tony leaned back on the couch behind him and stretched his legs under the table reaching Steve, who was sitting on the other side. An almost imperceptible smile appeared in the corner of the soldier's mouth as he placed his hand on Tony's foot and began to stroke it, climbing up Tony's pants as far as the hand was able to reach and returning and doing again, without the others noticing. Tony's whole body shivered deliciously. "But all my wishes
“Come on, Tony, let me help you,” Steve’s voice was impossibly kind when he pulled away, but continued to hold Tony by the arms.
“Nah-ah!” Tony said loudly, before Happy could answer. “I know what you're trying to do here, but I won’t let you take advantage of Happy's weaknesses.”
Tony’s dick was tantalizingly close to Steve’s face, and he wanted to suck it, but it was out of reach — at least for his mouth. So Steve did the next-best thing he could and ran his hands across Tony’s cock, until he had a good grip around it. It took his hands a second to match up with Tony’s rhythm, but once they did, Tony screamed like he hadn't until that moment.
Tony heard fingers typing furiously on a keyboard on the other end of the line. "I'm already working on it. Stay on the line."
Tony's heart jumped and went back to place, but in the wrong way. No. Scratch that. The right way, but beating differently. Steve was still staring at him, smiling in that funny way. Tony wanted to reach out and touch him, come closer and say that he cared too, that he loved the fact that Steve was his certainty, that he loved the fact that Steve cared. That
Fury raised an eyebrow and Tony just shrugged. It was easier to pass the responsibility for the party to someone else than to be thankful for great food and incredible music.
Tony facepalmed himself. Steve sucked at the art of acting. Maybe Tony should’ve asked Natasha for coming, after all. She did know how to pretend like no one else. And no one was able to deceive her. She always knew everything, like when Steve and Tony brought the whole team together the day after Strange's visit and after their first night of wild sex post sex-pollen (but that detail they omitted, of course. Soundproof rooms are made exactly to keep that kind of information secret), and Natasha simply said “it was about time.” Enerving, for sure.
didn’t know that.” Steve looked Tony in the eye and raised an eyebrow. You didn’t have to be an out-of-memory billionaire genius to understand what that meant. Tony’s heart raced.
“Tony, look at me.” Tony took a deep breath and did what Steve asked, meeting eyes so full of love that he thought he could drown. “Now, pay close attention to what I’m going to say to you, and please don’t be mad at me later, okay?”
“You say you’re not worthy, that you don’t deserve it. You stay there, focusing on your flaws, but you want to know something?” Steve asked. Tony nodded in agreement. “To me, you are perfect.”
in this world. Only then will the pollen leave my body and allow me to be me again.” Tony carefully put the flower back in the box and closed the latch. He tried to get up and take the box back to the safe, but his legs failed, and Tony fell. “Soon enough, I’ll no longer look like myself. In a little while I’ll look like a wild animal in heat, but I won’t be able to do anything because it will hurt too much while I try to find a cure by myself.”
Tony bent down and kissed Steve long and deeply, trying to say how happy, satisfied and complete he was at that moment. How he wanted time to stop to hold that moment forever, their sweaty bodies glued together; their foreheads leaning against each other, with the two trying to catch their breath lost in the best possible way; Steve's gasp as Tony slid out of him; his slow and sex-loving kiss and love. How he wanted to save Steve for himself and never again have to share him with anyone.
The typing stopped and Tony cringed, waiting for the blow. Instead, he heard a resigned sigh. "Not everything."
thought nothing was romantic there. Everything was going very well, until another friend of Sam, sergeant like us at the time, not as close as our little trio, and my boyfriend at the time, was transferred to another base, on the other side of the country. And he put an end with our relationship before he went away. And I was devastated, because I thought he was the love of my life," Steve laughed and shook his head, as if he didn't believe in the idiocy of young Steve. "Well, you can judge me, I was young and I thought I had found my true love," he shrugged. "Anyway, this guy left and I was heartbroken. And then, on a beautiful day, Sam, Peggy and I had gone out to go to our favorite bar, because I wanted to drown my sorrows. At some point, it was just me and Peggy talking and I asked her why everything went wrong. And she told me that I still hadn't found the right person. I replied that I thought yes, for sure, that's why my heart hurt so much. And then she just turned and said
“What happens now? What happens when we decide to leave here and face the world outside?” Tony turned his face away and listened to Steve’s heartbeat, amazed at the perfection with which he fit every curve of Steve’s body, ecstatic that they were halves of each other.
"And after making the surprise, where are you going?" Rhodes asked when they were both outside the cafe. "What hotel are you staying at?"
Then Steve smiled. He managed to open the warmest smile, the one full of love and affection, the one that only Peter could take from him, and strode to his son, with open arms, so that Peter could see what Steve was actually doing there.
“Yeah, this time,” Stark confirmed, pulling his helmet back to make his head free. “Let's hope Von Doom does not try again anytime soon until we find out more about what he plans.”
Tony smiled sheepishly. “See? But I still have all those flaws, I still don’t have my memories. I don’t remember when we last talked before, well, the day before yesterday. I can’t remember what I felt when I last saw you. And to think I let you ...” Tony swallowed. “And to think that I let you die thinking that I hated you, that all that mattered was winning that damn war, it eats at me every single day since I woke up.”
"Believe it or not, I didn't have access to any personal information about any of the family members yet. Chief Ross gave me just the basics about Peter's arrest."
"But their house was left open so that the crime scene could be investigated, because that's where they found the body."
She just laughed and asked why I couldn't give her a chance. If I didn't really like it, fine. No hard feelings," Steve shrugged and drank more wine.
Steve was still trying to contain the tears that were streaming down Tony’s face, a dam that had burst and was showing no signs of stopping. “Tony, let me help you,” he said quietly, so quietly that Tony was afraid he hadn’t heard.
We became real friends. The best. We were the best leaders our team has ever seen. You trusted me. And I wish you could hear my heartbeat every time you got close to talk about that day's fight, about a new project that you were very excited about, or just to do nothing. You always chose to do nothing with me. And that was much more than I could have
you. There is no person I trust in this world more than you. There’s no one else in this world that I’d follow with my eyes closed, no one I would give everything for, no one else I’d lose everything for, no one I’d give the key to bring me back from the dead other than you.” Tony came over and kissed him long and deeply, sealing each of his words. Each of them purer and truer than the other. When they came apart, Steve smiled and his eyes sparkled. “I love you,” Tony repeated. “I gave my heart to you tonight. It is yours for you to make with it what you want. And with me.” Tony stroked Steve’s face and ended up holding him by the chin, making him look deep into Tony’s eyes. “Oh, darling, with me do whatever you want,
"Cut it out, Rhodey. It's just the two of us here, and if I remember correctly, when you're at this cafe, you're not Detective Rhodes, but the Rhodey-bear that we all love to love. So go on. Spill it out."
“Yes.” Strange was about to punch Tony and Tony knew it. And he was enjoying taking the Sorcerer Supreme to the limit of his infinite patience.
This caused another wave of laughter at the table and an extremely irritated Nick Fury. Tony met Steve's gaze and wasn’t surprised to see the soldier watching him. Steve took the tablet and started typing.
With a groan of frustration, Tony slid his head to Steve's shoulder and his hands went to the soldier’s back, who hugged him back.
Tony couldn’t move. The shadows of that chimney were now his fortress and he wasn’t ready to go out and face the dragon, even if the dragon was the one that Tony had wanted to see the most in recent months.
Without questioning, Steve slowly licked from the base to the last finger willingly, all the while looking at Tony and not forgetting his own task with the undersuit. While Steve focused on getting Tony out of the tightest undersuit of all time, Tony slowly stroked Steve's cock, up and down, up and down, stopping a little to pay attention to the head, going down to the balls, and coming back, lazily, all the while leaving a trail of hickeys on Steve’s neck and shoulders.
“Shut up.” Tony couldn’t believe it. Who the hell Steve thought he was to make jokes? “You've already made it very clear how you feel about it and that you can’t stand the idea of touching me. What could you possibly want here?”
Steve smiled. “First, let’s not go back to Rogers. Sounds like you’re mad at me.” Tony laughed. “And second, because I knew you'd be right here to save me.”
to be you.” They both got close, sticking their bodies together, both erections touching for the first time, eliciting moans from them. Steve held Tony with one arm, keeping him close and, with his free hand, taking advantage of that both cocks were licking precome, Steve held them and stroked them together, making Tony scream and mark Steve’s back with his nails.
"The results of my finals are out, and Mr. Stark asked them to be delivered to him here at the Tower, instead of delivering to me," Peter explained. "If I got well, I'm still on the team. If I failed, goodbye Avengers.”
“You’re not coming?” He asked looking at Steve, who got up immediately and followed him down the stairs to the kitchen where Tony discarded the cold food in the trash and set the plate and cutlery in the sink.
Dad? They said it's impossible, that I can't get out of this," Peter hid his face again on Steve's shoulder. He was devastated and Steve wished he could switch places with him.
"Rhodey, don't pretend to be the idiot you're not. It's not a role you know how to play," Tony patted Rhodes sympathetically on the arm. "We need to talk out of here."
Steve rolled his eyes and shook his head, but Tony could see the corners of the soldier's mouth creeping into a smile. He liked to make Steve laugh, especially if it was with bad jokes. Tony grabbed Steve under his arms and they both came down without saying anything through the long elevator shaft.
Tony adjusted the GPS on his cell phone to take him to the judge's office that Pepper had managed to sign for Peter's release, and after getting the long-awaited paper, he headed for the police station, not far from there. As soon as Tony entered the police station, Tony ran into James Rhodes, the detective responsible for Peter's case.
convening a press conference to announce to the whole world that I have the most incredible boyfriend anyone could have," Tony smiled absent-minded.
"If you were supposed to know, Merida, we wouldn’t have whispered, would we?” Tony said, finishing the slice of pizza in his hand.
Tony looked back at Strange. “I’ll let you know when it’s time to return the favor.” And because Tony was Tony, he winked at the Sorcerer Supreme.
“Stop.” Strange raised a hand. Tony shut his mouth and waited. He also knew to recognize when he’d lost a battle. “Your attempt to distract me is pitiful. Please.
Tony turned his whole body in the direction of the odor and realized that he was sitting, leaning on something hot, soft and solid at the same time, and enveloping him.
He managed to smile and drank the rest of the whiskey he still had in his glass, trying to swallow the lump as well.
“Well, according to Urich, he didn’t need to publish that information to ruin me because I would ruin myself, after all, apparently, this was what happened to people like me,” Tony said, remembering the conversation he watched between him and Ben Urich, recorded by his office security system. Tony laughed through his nose, but the sound was like a sad moan. “Thinking about it now, I wonder if that wasn’t a dark prophecy.”
Tony swallowed and took a sip of coffee. Maybe it was the caffeine finally working, but he could not say exactly what was going on there.
Tony took a sip of coffee and continued looking outside without really seeing. He found himself thinking about what Steve had said about that being a new start for both of them. What were the chances, after all, of both of them having gone through near-death experiences and returning to live, with all the reasons why such experiences were linked to them having almost succeeded in killing each other because they were too stupid to admit that they never hated each other, but actually that they have always loved each other? Tony laughed through his nose and took another sip of his coffee.
Tony thought, going to sit at the table to eat. It was an extremely pleasant start to the evening, with Clint and Thor alternating karaoke shifts while the others ate.
"First of all, we need to get there safely." She allowed herself to look at girl at the back of Quinjet.
Tony looked back at Steve, his eyes full of pain and hope for what would never happen. “You were perfect, Steve. And I let myself believe, I let myself love you for those moments, even though it was all a lie. All of that,” he pointed to the laboratory floor where they had just had sex. “It was the flower’s effect. Well, at least for you. I let myself live the lie, even though I knew it wasn't gonna last.”
He turned, and in an action that would make him think hard for the next few hours, Tony came down from the counter, crossed the short distance between them and, standing on his tiptoes, hugged the soldier by the neck. It took a fraction of a second for Tony to hear the water bottle fall on the floor and he felt Steve's hands around him, large and warm, pulling him close.
Steve nodded, proving that Tony’s luck never lasted long. “It was the first thing they gave me to watch when I asked about you when I got back. Natasha told me that I should see it before I tried to talk to you in person. And you know you don’t deny a request from the Black Widow.” Steve smiled conspiratorially. “It was one of the reasons why I dropped everything and went to help you when I knew you needed me. If everything you said was true, if it wasn’t worth it, then we could fix everything, right?”
Tony undid Steve's helmet, pulled it off, and ran his fingers through the soldier's hair. Steve closed his eyes, enjoying the sensation.
“Ok, Mr. Funny,” Steve said, out of breath. “Your turn.” He opened the buttons on Tony’s shirt, one by one, showing admirable self-control, Tony needed to admit, but letting all of Tony’s control fall to the floor along with his shirt as soon as Steve’s lips reached the curve of Tony’s neck and they followed from there with a trail of wet kisses towards the front of Tony’s body, with no intention of stopping anywhere near.
The drive back home from the police station was tense and silent, and Tony didn’t try to cheer the mood up. He knew that a lawyer goes through tests. A good lawyer goes through some of them virtually unscathed. A great lawyer doesn't even feel like he's undergoing tests. But one thing all lawyers knew: you don't fail the first test, whatever it is. The circumstances of each process determine what your first task, your first battle, will be. If you win, you show everyone your shiny and competent armor. If you fail, your armor shows its breaches and failures. And Tony had failed his first test. He had failed Peter and Steve.
Tony swore to himself that he would leave Steve alone, that he would wait until he tried to get in touch. Tony told himself, returning from Steve’s apartment the night before weeping, like a helpless child, that he wouldn’t do anything like that again.
He knew he was making a mistake by thinking that just showing up would solve everything. That a simple smile of relief and gratitude and…
"The guest list," she said, and then a sequence of names appeared in the corner of the screen. Authorities, some friends, scientists, Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Phil Coulson with the new tactical team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and all the Avengers scattered around the world totaling two hundred people.
Tony let go of Steve and crawled up to reach for the bedside table. He opened the single drawer, took the lube that was inside and returned to the middle of Steve's legs. While he thrusted Steve’s cock with one hand, he has greased his fingers, and with the first, he gently touched Steve's rim.
"Let’s go, son. We'll take you inside," Steve said, guiding Peter through the entrance to the house. "You're going to take a shower, eat something and rest in your bed," Steve smiled and Tony wanted to give him the Best Effort Award for that attempt.
Tony leaned his head back, resting on Steve’s shoulder. “Okay,” he sighed heavily, making a little drama. “I can live with that.”
"Tony had already adopted this boy a long time ago. It was only a matter of time before we got to that point.”
But Tony could only look at Steve's smile and wish he knew how to make that smile stay there. At that time, the solution was to say 'yes'.
“Do not let them come closer!” A muffled, accented voice shrieked behind the lighted structure, and all the yellow agents responded to it advancing against the Avengers.
" Tony spoke softly and in a low tone, punctuating his sentences slowly, declaring them emotionless and practically, being, Steve realized, surprisingly for the first time since he had seen Tony for the first time, a real lawyer. "I know that he is your son and we know that he is innocent, and we will get him out of this situation. But know that in situations like this, even if we manage to get him out of here today or tomorrow, his case doesn't end so easily. Your son will only be acquitted if another piece of evidence comes up showing that he has nothing to do with the murder or if the real killer shows up and confesses," Tony released Steve and looked away. Steve was shaking. "You need to remember what it was like five years ago," Tony said suddenly.
” Tony gave a sad little smile. “In the middle of it all, we had your funeral and discovered a large-scale Skrull infiltration into Earth, being led by Spider-Woman who, we ended up discovering to be the Skrull Queen infiltrated long ago among us.”
"That they found Peter's DNA at the crime scene, yeah, I'm aware of that. But still, we go over there to talk to your son and the chief. In the meantime, I'm going to get Peter a habeas corpus. You know what that means, right?" Tony looked at him with doubt, as if suddenly Steve was a five-year-old kid.
“And why didn’t that make the front page of newspapers?” Steve asked and Tony cringed when he heard the acidity in his voice. Steve was disappointed. No. Disappointed was an understatement. Steve was hurt, and Tony agreed with him, but he just couldn’t feel the remorse he should have. The memories that were supposed to make that happen weren’t there.
Arching his body, Tony came in Steve's mouth with a cry. Taking everything that Tony gave to him, without dropping a single drop, Steve released Tony's cock and admired Tony's figure, lying on the counter, wide-eyed, panting, his hair a total mess, his face glistening with sweat, and an expression of pure pleasure in his eyes and face.
“Well, Liz,” Natasha said, and the two walked away to pay attention. “You met some of the members when we met you at Lincoln Center...”
Tony was taken by surprise. He was so distracted by Steve’s eyes that he let his guard down and stopped paying attention to what he was saying. It wasn’t possible for Steve to know that Tony was there. The armor made him invisible, even more hidden in the shadows as he was. Steve was bluffing. He couldn’t, he
That was a pretty name, Tony thought, it suited her. He remembered the fleur-de-lis and all the meanings attributed to that name and sent his regards to his other dimension's self for choosing such an appropriate name.
"Ah, yes," Ross said. "Gentlemen, this is Detective James Rhodes. He is responsible for investigating the murder for which your son is being accused, Captain," Steve could hear the pride in the Chief's voice introducing his detective. It was disconcerting. "Detective, these are Captain Steve Rogers, Mr. Peter's father, and their lawyer, Mr. Tony Stark," Steve and Tony greeted the detective without speaking, just emotionless handshakes. "Detective Rhodes here is going to take you to Peter," Ross said. "See you later."
“I had just come back from the dead.” Steve frowned. “And one day I got a call from Bucky, telling me that I had to go find Pepper, that it was urgent and that it had to do with bringing you back from the dead. That you needed me. Thor went there too.”
“Tony? I’m going to sit down now and bring you with me, okay?” Tony nodded slightly. Steve smiled. Nodding. Good sign. “Great. Come on.” Steve let his cock leave Tony, making both sigh, and put his arms under Tony’s to support him, helping him to sit on Steve's lap and laid Tony on his shoulder.
Tony thought. "And then, as soon as it's done, if I remember right, my birthday present comes to fruition and our weekend begins.”
Tony didn’t understand. Then he dropped his hands to his sides and faced Steve. Looking at him was like being punched in the stomach and wanting to repeat the experience. It was beautiful and suffocating. Perfect enough to hurt.
“I love you, Shellhead.” Steve used his free hand to hold Tony's neck and lean in to kiss him deeply and slowly, until they were both breathless.
Steve changed on the spot. A smile broke across his face, his expression softened and he raised an eyebrow. “
"Dramatic, I?" Tony pretended to be offended, but he was amused by the nickname. "I'm just pointing out the facts.” He, Steve, and Natasha entered the quinjet, and Sam and Clint piloted the ship back to the Tower not far from there.
"How about steak with potatoes?" He suggested, his mouth filling with water imagining the taste of the dish.
Tony's thoughts had never been so incoherent as at that moment and he had never felt so numb and at the same time so extraordinarily alert and aware of every bit of his body being touched by Steve, how their tongues danced around each other, sipping each other's taste, how warm and soft Steve's skin was under his fingers, and how he'd never been so horny in his life.
When the phone rang that afternoon, it could be just another phone call by mistake, someone else trying to sell something he didn't need, or just Natasha or Sam calling to say hi. But what Steve never imagined is that that call would forever change his life and his family's. Not that there was much family left to change. It was just him and Peter after Peggy, his wife, died five years before of fatal brain cancer. Cancer that followed Peggy for much of her life and, due to invasive treatments and extremely strong drugs, she couldn't have children, despite being her biggest dream. So they decided to adopt.
Fascinated by the lightness with which Vision headed toward the center of the Josie Robertson Plaza, something caught Natasha's attention in her peripheral vision. Narrowing her eyes, she could see there was something beyond the water in the fountain. Not something.
Strange sighed heavily and rolled his eyes, but said nothing. That was Tony Stark after all. He shrugged and turned to open one of his light portals. That was when he stopped. And that’s when Steve knew that everything had blown up.
Tony cleared his throat, his mind in a rush to come up with the best excuse. “You were gone a long time, Dr. Magic. Don't you think you’re actually overthinking it a little too much?” Tony tried to smile, but even he realized that was one of his lamest excuses ever. A shame. Stephen Strange wasn’t the Sorcerer Supreme for nothing.
Surrendering to curiosity, he opened his eyes and looked around. He was still in the Tower, but the light that woke him was not from inside the penthouse, but it was the sunlight. It was day already in New York, and sunlight streamed into the room, outlining the mess: scattered cups, napkins thrown over the floor, trays of food scattered about the coffee table, and several Avengers sleeping around the penthouse, lying on the couches, or leaning against them. Tony blinked a few times to get used to the sudden glare and looked where he was and smiled.
When he finally turned around, Tony pulled the air so hard into his lungs that his chest hurt. It was the most beautiful sight Tony had ever seen ... in his life. Perhaps it overcame the day when the Avengers found Steve frozen in the Arctic. They weren’t friends that day, they didn’t know each other as they did now. This was different. Looking at Steve was like looking at the sun after hours in the dark. It hurt and it was glorious. It made Tony’s eyes sting, but he couldn’t look away even if someone forced him.
Tony swallowed. There it was. So that’s where the hoax ended, isn’t it? Because up to that point they were simply pretending that everything was fine, that they were still friends, that nothing had changed. But everything was different. Everything had been turned upside down. Nothing was as it was before and Steve remembered.
would’ve done in his place. It doesn’t look like much me to make all the sacrifice of modifying a ship, to put my only and beloved daughter inside, in order to, in the end, simply throw her in the multiverse, praying for the best. I’d do the complete job.”
“Take your time,” Steve said from the roof. “I’m going to go in and have something hot. When you decide, the door will be open and there will be a cup waiting for you inside,” he turned and went back into the apartment, but Tony’s sensors indicated that the door really was unlocked.
“No, let me finish.” Tony put a finger to Steve’s mouth gently, silencing him. Steve nodded slightly and Tony smiled without showing his teeth. This was important to him. He wasn’t sure how to get there, but he knew where he wanted to end now that he started. “I always accepted that this would be my path, my lifestyle so to speak. But it wasn’t too bad, after all, I had friends, I had casual dates here and there, defeated villains every other day, and I always had you by my side, even when I never imagined I could have my feelings matched by yours. Life was relatively easy,” Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, who closed his eyes, enjoying the sensation.
The moment of dread was gone as quickly as it had surged when Tony looked up from his legs to scan the rest of the body to which those other strong, shapely legs belonged; the athletic torso, with perfectly shaped muscles, a map that Tony had begun to unravel; flawless chest, with nipples that Tony knew to be sensitive and that, if stimulated in the right way, could elicit groans and delicious sighs to hear; powerful arms that wrapped and protected Tony, holding him around the waist; and the most beautiful, adorable face, and that was synonymous with love for Tony.
Tony felt Steve's hand slide more easily with the precome that started leaking from him and that only made him get harder.
"Where did you learn to cook like that?" He stared at Steve, who was halfway to putting a piece of steak in his mouth. He lowered his fork and thought for a moment.
With great willpower, Steve placed Tony on the floor beside him, sat on his heels, and ran his hands through his hair. “Tony, this is craziness. How can you think that I'm the solution to… well, to
And you can't show anything but strength when you get to that police station. They'll want to eat you alive and you can't let them know how scared you are. They feel the smell of blood. They're like hungry sharks. You have to be worse than them, understood?" Steve agreed. "Very well. How are we going to get there?"
"How many more clues do I need to give?" And in a daring move he bit Tony's earlobe, who moaned softly.
Steve looked at Tony again and his look was pained. “Thor had to run to resolve matters for Asgard, that was going through its own problems. When I saw that you weren’t waking up, I went to Strange to ask for help. I stayed long enough to help him prepare the ritual that would bring you back.”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Tony looked at him, giving Steve a quick peek over his naked body, and he looked hurt.
And, if you don't mind, I believe it would be better to discuss this in person, here at the precinct," the Chief paused. "Maybe you would want to bring a lawyer when you come," and without saying anything else, he hung up. Like that. Cold-blooded.
It was nice, comfortable, domestic, and it warmed Tony up in much more efficient ways than anything he had ever experienced. He couldn’t help thinking that he wanted to keep having it, having Steve waking up next to him, waking up next to Steve, every day. Tony just knew he needed it, needed to know that Steve would come home with him, that they’d both tell about their stressful days, that they’d help each other, that they’d ask for food, that they’d watch stupid comedies together, that they’d try to have sex on the couch , but they’d end up sleeping because the life of world’s saviors was not a wonder, but, when sex happened, wow, it’d be the best of all. Tony wanted that. Needed.
Tony kept thrusting, until Steve cried loud when Tony found his prostate and stayed there for a while, teasing.
And it destroyed everything I thought I had built with you since that first meeting. You hated me, but the betrayal I saw in your eyes tore my heart in half. I’d
"Not more than four." Tony shrugged trying to sound unconcerned, but desperately wanting the man in front of him. How could Steve be so cute and sexy at the same time? "Pepper needs me to sign a major deal."
“Oh, darling. Liking is an understatement that doesn’t even come close to how it felt,” Tony said, turning to admire the view from the window again. Steve laughed and it was wonderful. They were them again.
“Nah-ah!” Tony lowered Clint's finger with one hand. “You can only bet if you’re still in the game. And, look, you're not.”
Tony smiled at her, a smile full of his deepest love, despite all the pain of that situation and gave her one more hug. He felt another pair of arms, larger and stronger, around them, and saw Steve covering them, before hearing the fatal words from him.
Tony set his water bottle aside, stretched out his legs and hugged Steve with them. The soldier's eyes darkened.
"What do you want from me, Tony?" Rhodes crossed his fingers on the table and stared at Tony. He was very different from when them studied together at the Law School at Harvard. They continued to defend people when they finished college, but Tony became a lawyer and Rhodes a detective. Who would say that'd be the turning of events.
Steve nodded, proving that Tony’s luck never lasted long. “It was the first thing they gave me to watch when I asked about you when I got back. Natasha told me that I should see it before I tried to talk to you in person. And you know you don’t deny a request from the Black Widow.” Steve smiled conspiratorially. “It was one of the reasons why I dropped everything and went to help you when I knew you needed me. If everything you said was true, if it wasn’t worth it, then we could fix everything, right?”
Tony pulled away enough to look at him. Steve was frowning, thinking. Tony laughed. “Why, Steve Rogers afraid to face the world outside?” Steve pouted. Tony laughed out loud and poked Steve in the chest. “Who are you and what have you done with my Steve?”
Natasha was taken from her reverie by a cry of pain coming from the opposite edge of the fountain. Thor had managed to hit the girl with one of his lightening, but it was not the shock that made her scream, but the impact against the stone. Natasha saw the girl's left ear dyeing with the blood dripping from a not-so-beautiful wound that had opened on her forehead. Momentarily disoriented, the girl was finally vulnerable and at a disadvantage, letting the path clear to Vision to increase his density, grab her by the neck and raise her to a few inches of the ground. The girl coughed and tried to break free, but Natasha knew it was a futile effort. Once Vision increased his density, only Wanda could face him. And counting on the help of the Scarlet Witch was not an option at the time.
Not bothering to reply the obvious, Tony kept working on the final additions of the ship. That was the only salvation of that incursion that already consumed half of the planet. No second could be lost with meaningless conversations. A few minutes later, Tony stepped out from under the ship, wiping his hands on his jeans. He stared at the man in front of him. Even after all those years Tony's heart still lost a beat whenever his eyes met his husband's: two blue oceans, which the engineer knew very well how to sail.
Steve smiled the brightest of smiles and kissed Tony with all his passion and with all the happiness that those words had multiplied within him. Tony was the love of his life, his reason, his root in this crazy world since Steve had left that block of ice. Apparently confusing love with hate was quite easy when nobody says anything, when neither side takes the initiative to take the first step. It took the two of them to get lost in order to finally have the courage to seek and find each other.
Tony looked at him through his long lashes and snorted in exasperation. “You can’t expect me to stand looking at you all dressed up after you tell me all these things.”
was one of the first things you heard about when you came back from the dead, then you must imagine what public opinion must have said about what the Director of the largest spy agency in the world should know about it.” Tony frowned. “Everyone blamed me for not knowing that the Skrulls were among us and for letting things escalate to the point where they arrived. Besides, those damn green aliens with the weird chin infected my technology, rendered the Extremis useless, making me practically dead weight during the battle against them. Everyone thought I was helping the enemy when, in fact, I was being sabotaged. Add to that the fact that rumors that I had benefited from the Civil War to get rich spread, and that’s it. You have a witch hunt targeting me.”
“Let me finish.” Steve smiled. “I see someone so generous that he chose to give up everything, including his own memory, to save those who have turned their backs on him.”
“Oh, my gosh, Tony, how can you joke right now?” Steve groaned and managed to let out a strangled laugh.
, when we trust each other. See what happened when we hid things from each other,” Steve waved his hand between them and raised an eyebrow.
Steve!” Tony let his head fall on Steve's shoulder when the soldier stroked the head of his cock, completely covered with his precome. “I-I won’t be able to hold it back much longer.”
"It was better," Steve said without even thinking. Tony shifted and faced him. "In my dream it wasn’t real, as much as I wanted it to be. Now I can touch you for real,” Steve stroked Tony's face. “I can really kiss you,” he came over and gave Tony a quick kiss. “I can stay with you for real,” Steve smiled and Tony smiled back. “So everything I'm living right now is way better than any dream I might have had.”
"The borers never realize they're boring, Robin Hood," Tony teased, already completely covered in armor.
Tony looked deep into Steve’s eyes and he felt his eyes wide with panic. “You’re right. My goodness, you’re right. I’m the man stuck in the past. I ...” Steve raised his eyebrows and waited. “I became you,” Tony said in a choked whisper.
“I still don’t know how that’s possible,” Tony’s voice came muffled from where he was with his face hidden in Steve’s neck.
Steve and Tony exchanged a brief glance and went to meet her. Tony retracted the armor, going back to his jeans and his T-shirt, and finally getting Liz in his arms. He stroked her hair and Steve saw him smile. She trembled in his embrace.
“The box,” Tony said hoarsely, sliding his hands down Steve's arms and around his neck, then down to his strong chest and back. Tony’s mouth watered with desire.
His smile widened as he remembered that the last image of his dream was Steve smiling at him in the elevator... yesterday?
“I left when I saw my parents hugged in the middle of the burning lab,” she said in a voice filled with tears. “The last memory I have of them is to see them exchanging one last kiss before everything was being consumed by the fire and I being sucked to the multiverse.”
Steve blew out a breath, defeated. “I wanted to make sure that when you woke up, I wouldn’t lose you again.”
“Shhh, it’s not your fault, Steve,” Tony smiled. “I needed to understand my grief. That was my mechanism. I stopped as soon as your imaginary voice told me it was disappointed,” Tony shook his head and laughed, remembering the moment. He looked back at Steve when he recovered. “But seriously, all those moments, all those nights, and then all those days, drinking to try to reach you, even if in an imaginary way, all that time going in the direction of my worst version, I should’ve realized right away that everything I was doing was simply because I needed you. But I was too numb to understand my own emotions.”
“Hi, Tony.” Steve smiled without showing his teeth and Tony thought he could melt in a puddle right there.
Tony laughed mentally. He had millions of things he wanted to shout for the world to hear, but he just couldn’t find the right words. He wanted to be able to rip his heart out of his chest and show it to Steve. It would be more effective, mistake and misinterpretation proof, of lack of words good enough.
“It is. It's what we are, yes," he gripped Tony's face with his free hand and stroked it with his thumb. "Is it still my birthday and I don’t know?”
“Any problem, Hocus Pocus?” Tony tried to divert the Sorcerer’s attention. “Oh, I’m sorry. My bad. Jarvis can show you the magician's restroom, if you prefer not to use the mere mortals’ one, don’t worry.”
Tony froze in place. Panicking, he looked at his hands and then checked the status of the armor on the display. Everything was in order; he was practically invisible. Still, very slowly, he turned back toward Steve’s building and there he was, looking in the direction Tony was in, missing by a few inches. Tony turned up the volume of the external sounds to accurately capture everything Steve said, but left his own speaker on mute. He still wasn’t sure what was going on there.
“Why d’ya make an undersuit so tight and difficult to take off?” Steve asked when he finally managed to slide the undersuit over Tony's tanned shoulders and bent down to leave a trail of wet kisses on every exposed piece of skin he discovered. Tony's laugh was muffled from inside Steve's neck. “I had to find a way to make you see my best ...
Tony ignored the confusion and headed straight for his huge, potent coffee machine to pour himself a generous mug of hot coffee. That was all he needed to recover his energies and clear his ideas. Tony Stark's fuel was good old caffeine. He had finished his first mug without even realizing that he had taken it all in one breath.
"Thanks," Steve said, embarrassed. "Make yourself at home. We don't have fixed hours, so make yourself at home to make your own, walk around the house, whatever you want. There's food in the fridge, the stove and the microwave are yours for whatever you want. In the living room, TV control is also free, as long as you arrive first," Steve smiled. "If you need me, I usually read and draw upstairs, in my room, or in the garden, outside. You can find me in my studio, which is up there, too. Just call me."
“You don’t want to see this." Tony laughed and finished his ... well, who was counting the sake glasses, right?
“Iron Man, Widow, Hawkeye, take care of the weapon and the Scientist Supreme,” Steve commanded. “Thor, Hulk, Sam, give cover. Go!”
Getting to the eye of the hurricane was an almost impossible task, it hurt, it made chills just to think, but the reward was worth it, wasn't it? Getting to Steve was more or less like reaching the eye of the hurricane. It was very worthwhile to spend all the time in the world in his company, making him laugh was the biggest reward, but it was also wonderful to see some more intimate things, things you had to be persistent to get, like how his eyes sparkled when he discovered something new, to follow the excitement he tried to contain when he came to show one of his new drawings, watching him fall asleep on movie nights, enjoying the view that was Steve training at the gym, or just enjoying his company, silent and comforting.
Tony was breathing fast, his heart was pounding in his ears, and he felt dizzy. Steve said he wanted to see Tony. That was good, right? But he hadn’t left Tony much of a choice.
"They think that we work for the government, in an intelligence office, so we can’t share information and that’s why we travel a lot."
“Oh.” Tony found himself thinking that Steve looked adorable with that surprised expression on his face, especially when he tried to disguise it.
Tony was taken by surprise. He was so distracted by Steve’s eyes that he let his guard down and stopped paying attention to what he was saying. It wasn’t possible for Steve to know that Tony was there. The armor made him invisible, even more hidden in the shadows as he was. Steve was bluffing. He couldn’t, he
And when Steve finally wrapped Peter in his arms, when the boy allowed himself to collapse in his father's embrace and put out all the fear, shaking, sobbing and trying to shrink and hide in the curve of Steve's neck, everything seemed to fit together, going to the right places. Steve squeezed his son in his arms, as if to make sure he was real, stroked his son's back, his hair, and wrapped him up again, protecting him, even for a few moments, from everything that could harm his son. His boy.
"Thinking about it now, it's not a bad idea," Tony finished his coffee. "We can take part in the holiday celebrations
Steve shook his head. “No. I couldn’t change the past. I tried, but I couldn’t.” Steve looked away. “I could only go through all those events again and again and again, endlessly.”
"Falcon, Spider-Man, get civilians out of the way," Steve commanded. "Hawkeye, Widow, attack the body and legs of the hydra. Thor, Hulk and Iron Man, attack the top of the monster and send it back through the portal as quickly as possible.”
"Steve, for God's sake, you can't be serious." Steve heard Tony sigh, exasperated. "I don't judge you for your panic attack because I myself have had the same problem for years." Steve suddenly raised his head and looked at Tony, but said nothing. He couldn't. "It's true," Tony said. "You can call Pepper and confirm, if you like," Tony shrugged.
“I know. And knowing how much you know me takes my breath away, because nobody else knows me like you. Maybe not even myself.” Tony looked at New York framed by the huge window, the sun was almost overhead, and sighed. “You know, looking outside, waking up here with you this morning, it made me realize with more force than ever that, as much as I want to, there is no escape from the horrible things I did, the lies I told, the people I manipulated. And I can’t even recover everything I lost,” Tony sighed heavily, but kept looking at the light outside, letting it come in, illuminating every corner that was still in darkness. “But I also realized how right what we did here is. And that I’m having a chance to recover something that I missed. Only one, but the most important,” Tony looked back into Steve’s eyes, shining, focused on Tony, looking forward to what would come next. Tony held Steve’s face in his hands. “You, Steve. Because I finally realized that, all this time, I just needed you.”
“Tony, what’re you doing?” Steve asked, as he tried to untangle Tony's arms from his neck, to no avail. Steve then tried to push Tony away by holding him firmly around the waist and that's when Tony groaned. But not in pain.
This one came out much stronger and more convinced. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck and clung there, as if his life depended on it. Tony depended on Steve, on how strong and soft he was at the same time, how he smelled like ...
“No use imagining anything now. I doubt any hypothesis will remotely come close. It could be that she's talking about the coffee maker that broke again or that they've caught the Silver Surfer drunk above the space speed limit.”
Tony bit Steve's shoulder and groaned loudly, as he tightened his arms around him even more. Steve took that as a yes.
"Last week they found a new clue, a very promising one," Natasha lowered her voice. "A DNA sample in good condition in the garage of the old family house. It was there that the boy's body was found. The police have been keeping it isolated since then."
“I wish I could,” Tony said, his fingers running over the keyboard and his frantic eyes reading the codes on the screen in front of him. “It seems that the Scientist Supreme here was well guarded this time,” A counter appeared on the bomb's monitor and a one-minute countdown began. “He added a detonator to the programming code if the weapon was deactivated externally.”
Suddenly Tony's tablet vibrated in his hands and he looked down. The screen was flashing a request for an encrypted communication channel, outside the S.H.I.E.L.D. radars.
"To this," Tony waved his hand between them. "Me, you, breakfast in bed, change the day into the night because losing ourselves into one another is a far more interesting alternative than controlling the clock..."
“Right now?” Steve looked at Tony and the engineer was surprised by the intensity of the blue. "Nothing special.”
The worst that could happen was Tony leaving that night with one less friend. For the third time. It would be a record.
Something clicked inside Steve's brain and his eyes lit up. “That's why it was coffee, oil and…” Steve crawled to Tony, cupped his face and tilted it to the side, exposing the neck. Steve nuzzled Tony's neck, making the skin tingle, from the base to Tony's jaw. There, Steve stopped. “...and you.”
The worst that could happen was Tony leaving that night with one less friend. For the third time. It would be a record.
"Fair enough," Steve approached, picked up the bottle of water that Tony held out to him and took a good sip that left his lips wet and extremely inviting. "So you're going to finish the story about why no one else knows about this place?"
Tony looked again at Steve across the street, on the roof. He was now leaning on the rail, on his forearms, looking straight ahead without really seeing. Tony wanted so badly to reach him, to get close to his friend, to say that, even if he didn’t remember, he was sorry. That he wanted Steve in his life. He
" Steve pulled away enough to hold Peter's face and looked his son in the eye. So much sadness in a face so beautiful, so smart and where there should only be happiness. "I came to help you," Steve wiped away a few tears, just to see his work ruined by the other tears that came soon after.
Steve narrowed his eyes, but said nothing. This was a battle won for Tony and Tony knew the soldier knew.
“I was in an induced coma for a while. And Pepper helped me to come back by following the instructions I had left in case all this happened. Apparently, it worked. When I came back, I had zero sense of everything that was going on, nor why I wasn’t at my house, or why I didn’t have my friends calling or being there with me. When I mentioned calling you and Pepper stopped me, I knew there was something very wrong. I remembered talking to you,
Tony thought, his whole body responding to the kiss. His hands flew over to Steve's hair, his fingers wrapping around the soft locks, and pulled the soldier closer, holding him just as Tony was being hold.
“Pickles? What pickles?” Clint started to walk away, heading toward the quinjet. “You know what he's talking about, Thor?”
"But tell Natasha I'm home. Only her." He said already inside the Avengers' exclusive elevator. "Tell her I'm exhausted and I’m going to sleep to be presentable for the party.”
“Thank you. I’m happy to be back,” Steve ate a cookie and was thoughtful as he chewed. “Do you know what I noticed while I was wandering?” Tony shook his head and waited.
"Yeah, I know." Tony took another sip of coffee and poured himself another mug. "But this time it was a matter of being fair to the boy. He lost the finals because he was helping us. I just helped him back," he stared at Steve. "I learned that from you.”
He turned, went to the refrigerator, and held himself back so as not to enter the inviting cold that came from inside. He took two bottles of water, sat down on the huge counter that separated the kitchen from the living room and took off his coat.
If they had started under the blessings of the moon, waking up bathed in the warmth of the morning sun was like receiving the seal that made it all real.
He knew he was making a mistake by thinking that just showing up would solve everything. That a simple smile of relief and gratitude and…
Steve smiled the brightest of smiles and kissed Tony with all his passion and with all the happiness that those words had multiplied within him. Tony was the love of his life, his reason, his root in this crazy world since Steve had left that block of ice. Apparently confusing love with hate was quite easy when nobody says anything, when neither side takes the initiative to take the first step. It took the two of them to get lost in order to finally have the courage to seek and find each other.
The girl denied it with her head, her mouth opening and closing, unable to formulate a coherent phrase and her eyes... oh, her eyes... though completely taken by the shock and the tears that flowed uninterruptedly, Steve saw brightness on them. A hopeful, unbelieving glow, but clinging to every possibility.
Instead of start saying whatever she found, Natasha went silent for some moments. Tony’s leg was shaking. "Nat, are y-"
Natasha looked Tony up and down and smiled. "Finally." She handed Tony the microphone and pulled Bruce back to the table.
Tony started to pull away, but Steve caught hold of the hand they held, holding him close. In a movement too fast for someone who was waking up, Steve pulled Tony back onto the bed and rolled to the side at the same time, facing Tony.
Still, Tony didn’t know all those details because he watched the news broadcasting everything live, including his former friend being shot. No. He knows all the details because he watched the recordings of that day, from all the cameras available to him, from all angles, for several hours and days, exhaustively. Tony knew how to recite by heart the seconds in which each action had taken place. From everything he lost when his memory was erased, to prevent Norman Osborn from putting his disgusting hands on the records of the infamous Registration Act, which were, ironically, all in Tony’s brain, from every detail, of all the details, this piece, Steve's death because of that stupid fight, was what he made a point of re-recording.
He forced himself to walk over to Tony and swallowed when the lawyer's image came into focus. Tony was leaning on the table, chatting casually with the woman sitting behind it, and Steve could see every outline of his back, and he couldn't help looking down a little more and noticing how the suit Tony was wearing clung not subtly at all to his curves in the position he was in, accentuating everything ... and it was a beautiful set being accentuated. Tony could be a lawyer, but that didn't mean that what the suit was hiding was something to be thrown away. Nothing was left to the imagination, quite the contrary. In fact, a part of Steve was actually imagining. But he didn't even know what. He couldn't name what he felt, because, at that moment, he was feeling so many things that that feeling was one more in a whirlwind. Luckily for him, Tony straightened up and turned, coming towards him.
The four of them disappeared into the elevator, and silence reigned in the kitchen. Tony looked at Steve.
And Steve gave it to him. Holding Tony tightly around the waist, Steve opened his mouth to receive Tony with all his impatience and desire.
“No, I don’t know. But you didn’t know it either, Tony. The next time you arrive at such a crossroads, trust me. We work better
"This card is a weekend-ticket," Steve began. "You are invited to spend a whole weekend, completely incommunicable, with me. Will you?"
Tony looked deep into Steve’s eyes and he felt his eyes wide with panic. “You’re right. My goodness, you’re right. I’m the man stuck in the past. I ...” Steve raised his eyebrows and waited. “I became you,” Tony said in a choked whisper.
"I asked Friday if you had plans for after poker,” Steve's neck turned red and Tony couldn’t help but smile. “And she told me about the trip. How many days?”
Tony smiled sheepishly. “See? But I still have all those flaws, I still don’t have my memories. I don’t remember when we last talked before, well, the day before yesterday. I can’t remember what I felt when I last saw you. And to think I let you ...” Tony swallowed. “And to think that I let you die thinking that I hated you, that all that mattered was winning that damn war, it eats at me every single day since I woke up.”
They both laughed and it was good. The sound of the two laughs mixed and Tony was transported to lighter and happier times, when the Avengers shared the Mansion that Tony had donated to the team to serve as their HQ. Those were times that seemed so far away now. So unattainable. So unreal. Tony was afraid that sometimes he was just imagining all those memories, that he had much more than just a part of his memory erased. What if he was imagining those happy times? No. He could never just imagine the laughter and game nights at the Mansion with Steve and the others. That was too precious.
Tony laughed hysterically. “Your name sounds so beautiful when I say it. Steve.” He looked drunk, and the only thing that could cure Tony was Steve.
Tony gasped and it took him a few seconds to get back to normal. That story had taken a completely unexpected turn. Pepper had been his and Steve's surrogate belly on the other Earth! How to react to that?
the most. And only the aim of your desires can help you take the pollen out.” Tony slid his hands up to Steve's neck and left them there, his fingers caressing Steve's scalp.
Little did Steve know that his advice wasn’t only for a confused teenage Avenger, but also for a founding member of the Avengers who, by a happy chance, overheard all the conversation sitting in his lab, and now he had, not only the answers he needed, but also many other questions.
With Pepper, it was like that, years of coexistence until he had the courage to admit that there was a feeling. It is a pity that the feeling itself was of pure brotherly love than romantic love. It’d never have worked out anyway. Thankfully, they both realized that in time to keep the friendship alive and strong enough for Pepper to continue in Tony's life and in the leadership of Stark Industries. The two worked much better that way.
The Sorcerer Supreme tilted his head and observed Tony and Steve’s hands together again. He raised an eyebrow, now looking slightly interested. “Let me guess: he was your antidote.”
“How about that?” Steve released Tony’s back and, while one of his hands jerked off their cocks, with the other he massaged Tony's balls, down to the perineum and back.
He wanted to be the one that Steve would return to, the one that Steve would spend the day thinking about returning to, because Tony would be the one who’d make all the weight go off his back and make him smile when he arrived. Tony wanted to be everything Steve needed and he wanted to be the one Steve could always count on, to be the safe haven Steve had always been for him. Tony could be all that, right? Even without memory, even if he was full of flaws, even though he knew he’d never reach Steve’s perfection, he could still be there for Steve, right?
Tony felt something inside him squirm uncomfortably. Steve had tried to change his past. Had he tried not to be frozen? Had he tried not to be an Avenger? Had he tried to never meet Tony?
Tony was so frustrated. He wanted to go back in time and still have his memories. He wanted to go back and find a way to fight to keep them, to remember everything, to
Tony tried. Tony tried hard, in all the ways that he knew made him come. None of them worked. He tried to thrust his hand up and down his length. Nothing. He tried to circle his thumb around his cock’s head as he wrapped and stroked the balls. Nothing, either. He tried to stroke his cock with one hand while shoving his fingers in his ass. One, two, three. Nothing.
Tony sat on the high bench that Steve indicated was his place and Steve sat across from him on the other side of the island after placing some cookies between the cups. They were both silent for what seemed like eternity, and all Tony could do was face Steve openly, without any shame.
"What do you think, Steve?" Nat asked, unaffected, making Tony choke and cough a few times. Steve tried to reach him, but Tony pushed him away. He didn't need Steve that close at the moment.
The moment of dread was gone as quickly as it had surged when Tony looked up from his legs to scan the rest of the body to which those other strong, shapely legs belonged; the athletic torso, with perfectly shaped muscles, a map that Tony had begun to unravel; flawless chest, with nipples that Tony knew to be sensitive and that, if stimulated in the right way, could elicit groans and delicious sighs to hear; powerful arms that wrapped and protected Tony, holding him around the waist; and the most beautiful, adorable face, and that was synonymous with love for Tony.
Steve kept his head on the sofa looking at Tony, but he reached out to hold Tony's free hand while Tony stroked his hair.
Instead of talking, Steve slipped his hands under Tony and lifted him from the counter, holding him to his body. Tony tightened his legs around his waist. Without stopping kissing, sucking and exploring Tony's mouth and neck, Steve turned and walked up the stairs, toward the far door in the hallway. Inside the room, Steve put Tony on his feet gently and pulled away enough to run his fingers through Tony's messy hair, which shivered with the soft touch.
Tony woke up the next day not with the sound of the cell phone alarm ringing, but with a call. He fumbled around on the nightstand until he found his cell phone and saw that it was Pepper calling at seven thirty in the morning. Unusually early by his standards. Tony considered not answering, but the consequences would be too catastrophic. Pepper was an angel, but she should never be irritated. He cleared his throat and answered the call.
“My analysis has not yet identified an agent, sir. But, if I may, your symptoms arose after you placed Dr. Strange’s box in the vault.”
Steve shrugged. “You’re the one to blame here, babe. It was you who brought me back to the bed and held me here.”
Tony’s brain was no longer functioning. He hadn’t heard anything. It was probably another one of those beautiful and inspiring speeches that only Steve knew how to give, because Tony only managed to pay attention to one part and no other.
Tony then stopped very seriously and looked at Steve. “So, are we just going to leave the Civil War behind?”
“I’m going to show you,” Steve stroked Tony’s hair. “Every day, until the end, I will prove to you how much I love you and how much you deserve all the happiness.”
The plane's door closed and Tony went to sit in front of Steve. The two watched from the windows on the plane taxiing down the runway and said nothing until the aircraft was in the air.
Tony chose a sushi and put it in his mouth. He groaned softly. It was delicious. "We should do this more often, don't you think?" He looked around the table and his gaze stopped at Steve, who was watching him with a funny expression, his mouth open, his eyes fixed on Tony ... no. Not Tony, specifically. On Tony's mouth.
"Well, thank you super-soldier serum," Tony took off his fingers, greased his own cock with lube and positioned himself in Steve's entrance.
erase my memory in one last attempt to ... I don’t know.” Tony struggled to find the right word, but nothing in the right sense occurred to him.
“Oh, darling. Liking is an understatement that doesn’t even come close to how it felt,” Tony said, turning to admire the view from the window again. Steve laughed and it was wonderful. They were them again.
“I think that’s why Peter began calling us the Avengers’ Mom and Dad,” Tony said, taking a sip of coffee.
Tony felt his chest ache when he saw the shield against the door, strategically positioned. The last time he had seen that shiny disk had been a lifetime ago, a life that no longer belonged to him, when he visited Steve’s dead body.
We first met in circumstances that weren't exactly friendly, we didn't like each other at all in the beginning. At least, that's what all of our mutual friends say.
"I think so, too," Steve agreed, more to keep her talking than anything else. He had a feeling he wasn't going to like what he was going to hear.
“Yeah, something has changed, yes,” Tony said, his voice distracted, as he watched his fingers fade and appear through the golden strands of Steve’s hair.
“So, everything you said today …” Tony looked into Steve's eyes and there it was, the curious and lively glow that only Tony's gaze had.
"I don't know how much he knows. He was in the Army, but that doesn't mean he knows all the secrets. And if he doesn't, I'm not going to tell him."
“Damn diplomatic immunity,” Stark cursed. “I’d give anything to invade Latveria's systems and discover that lunatic's new plan.”
Tony's body agreed. He had neglected many hours of sleep in the last few days, for various reasons, doing overtime in the lab, developing new projects, or thinking about Steve. Sleep had come in good time.
Tony froze in place. Panicking, he looked at his hands and then checked the status of the armor on the display. Everything was in order; he was practically invisible. Still, very slowly, he turned back toward Steve’s building and there he was, looking in the direction Tony was in, missing by a few inches. Tony turned up the volume of the external sounds to accurately capture everything Steve said, but left his own speaker on mute. He still wasn’t sure what was going on there.
well," Tony could almost hear her eyes rolling over the other side of the phone. "No. This isn’t why I called."
Steve laughed through his nose. “Because we are both too stubborn to give up an argument. And then we fought,” Steve sighed. “We started with a truce, we dropped our weapons, you even came out of the armor. We even managed to laugh a little, but ended up punching ourselves because, apparently, that was all we knew how to do because we were too blind trying to prove which side was right.”
“Thank you. I’m happy to be back,” Steve ate a cookie and was thoughtful as he chewed. “Do you know what I noticed while I was wandering?” Tony shook his head and waited.
Tony felt sweat running down his back. “Hmmm, hypothetically, if the effects on just one person had lasted just one day, a few hours, what would that mean?”
“Nothing else happened, okay?” Steve took another long sip of his water with his eyes closed, clearly trying to calm down.
” Tony was afraid his words wouldn’t come out loud enough, but he knew Steve would listen to them. Blessed be the improved hearing. “I’m sorry.” Tony turned and found himself at the entrance to the room he had entered in ... a lifetime ago. He slowed down enough to take a last look around, the room all framed by the intense moonlight that came in through the huge window just in front of him, he saw the door leading to the roof, where the armor was waiting, and the practical part of his brain put the puzzle together.
“But, as you may have noticed, funerals don’t keep me on the other side for long,” Steve said, taking a sip of coffee. “After all, I wasn’t, in fact, dead.”
Steve was the certainty that Tony had, no matter what happened, no matter what the dilemma, whatever the villain of the week, no matter what the crisis was, Steve was there, the silence in the middle of the confusion. The calm in the eye of the hurricane. Tony laughed to himself in the middle of a sip of his sake, thinking how appropriate that image was.
show up when you want to. You don’t have to wait for me to call or, I don’t know, be scared or anything.” Tony zoomed in on Steve’s face and, wow, Tony was surprised by the expectation there. Steve really expected Tony to reveal himself. Steve knew that Tony was scared. Damn, he knew Tony too well. Did he know about Tony’s memory loss? But Tony just couldn’t move to get even an inch closer to Steve. He wanted, his heart wanted, but his brain kept reminiscing about their recent history and Tony just stood there, unable to say anything, to do anything but cry, frustrated, because life was unfair. Steve wanted Tony to go there. It was that simple.
"I-I don't know what to say," Steve was gaping. That had been the first time, since he decided to retire, that anyone had had the courage to tell him that he needed to resurrect the Captain who still lived inside him. He never imagined that one day he would need to return to the life he had left to care for Peter to, well, save Peter. But if that was the price, then he was willing to pay it. It didn't matter for how long it would be needed. He would be again, even if it was only for himself and for the sake of his son, Captain Steve Rogers, someone capable of intimidating generals.
“Tony,” Steve called. Tony focused on him. “You were the first to speak to me and introduce me to the world. You gave me a home when I woke up in this century. You were my safe haven. Let me do the same for you. Let me show you how I see you, let me be your safe haven.” Steve held his hand out to Tony, his eyes shining with hope and feeling.
Tony was startled. He took too long; he was too slow and now Steve was there. He didn’t turn around, but he was alert, paying attention to the sounds Steve was making, deliberately loud, so Tony would know where he was, what he was doing, where he was going. They both knew that if Steve wanted to, he could be quieter than a shadow.
“Thor, Hulk, take this structure off the ground,” the two Avengers obeyed and, each one going to one side of the weapon, began to pound the ground. “Tony, how much does this thing weigh?”
“I love you, Steve Rogers,” Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair again. “It’ll be wonderful to share my path from here to infinity with you.”
“I know, my love. And I love you, too. More than I can tell.” Steve hugged him tightly and buried his face into the curve of Tony's neck, breathing in slowly and deeply.
are my home, my safe haven. My best friend. You are the love of my life, Tony Stark. It’s with you that I want a new beginning that will last forever.”
"Not a bad idea, you know.” He turned in a closed curve and they entered the grounds of a house made of wood, not too large by Tony standards, with two stories and huge windows covered with white curtains. A little farther on, in the sand, two sun loungers next to a huge beach umbrella and the sea framing everything with its gradient shades of blue and green.
“Really? I'm here trying to talk about Hydra's plans for building their new headquarters and that's what you have to add?”
"But no access to the internet," Tony smiled crookedly. "And I blocked all the signals. The cameras weren’t working.”
"You're still too dressed, Stark," Steve said softly, his voice more husky than Tony had ever heard. His mouth watered.
"So are we, too." Clint's voice also came up, loud and clear, just before Natasha could find the place he was hiding, a little further away from Thor.
"I'm ready," the android's mechanical voice sounded in the comms as he floated beside Natasha, heading toward the fountain. He would use his powers of intangibility to take care of any eventuality and provide cover for the others to approach.
“So what?” Tony was nervous about what was about to come, but the curiosity to know what Steve had thought of the sincerest monologue Tony had ever done, dedicated to his best friend’s lifeless body, was much greater.
Steve laughed, but soon later they were silent again. They stayed there like that for a while, just enjoying the coffee, the view and the proximity of each other. For Steve, happiness would have that image as a definition when he looked in the dictionary, with Tony still sleepy, but with his fast and acid humor as always, flirty like never before, because now Steve knew it was all true, with no layers, no doubts, with his soft and warm body glued to Steve’s, allowing Steve to love him and show him how Tony was essential.
but he needed a better position to enjoy it. That rush of desire helped clean his mind enough so Tony could at least know where he was. With a cleaner mind Tony made Steve sit on the floor and climbed on his lap, straddling him.
But I would accept everything, as long as you were there. I had left our disagreements behind, regretting every rude and mean word had I said to you. I just couldn't ask for forgiveness from the only person who mattered:
"The house is quite big. It won't be a hassle. Don't worry. In fact, it'll be nice to have company. We've been Peter and me for a long time. Another person will be nice."
Tony was going crazy, breathing erratically, needing Steve's body stuck to his, but he didn’t dare to move.
Steve looked up and Tony lost his breath by how intense those blue eyes were. “I have. Many, many times.”
Even in his condition, Tony felt a twinge in his heart. And it hurt. A dark light in the fog that overcame Tony. "Of course,
Steve frowned at the sudden change of subject, but nodded. “Yes. I don’t know how many times, but I know there were many. Enough to analyze it from the most different angles. Why?”
“And the universe knows how happy and relieved I am to be here witnessing this,” Tony said. “But before, I could only think that you were gone forever and that all I wanted to do was hug you. All I wanted to do was do what I never had the courage to do before. Ironic, isn’t it?” Tony gave a sad smile. “I went back to drinking. Less than before, not to the point of getting drunk, but enough to be able to imagine your voice scolding me. Everything to get you back, even for a few seconds.”
"As much as I want to stay here and finish you off with more matches, I have a trip booked and Happy is here to take me to the jet. But can we finish this one here?”
"Shut up, Legolas," Tony said, landing Steve and analyzing the situation. "Yeah, we're really having quite a spanking.”
Tony coughed a few more times to save time. He wasn’t expecting to see Steve today, at least not at this time, with his beautifully messy hair, wearing a Stark Industries T-shirt at least a smaller number than ideal, bare feet and sweatpants, revealing his v-line. Tony swallowed hard and forced himself to look into Steve's eyes.
“Yeah, I could notice that too. My blood, Jarvis. There has to be something, anything, that explains all of this coming up so suddenly.” Tony turned on the floor, let his arms fall limp, and stared at the ceiling, breathing hard and sweating cold.
and nobody else’s.” And to prove his point, Tony slid his hand down Steve’s back and squeezed one of his cheeks.
They looked at each other for a long moment. When it was clear that Steve wasn’t joking, Tony shrugged. “
Steve lost the strength of his legs and fell to the floor, but he felt no pain. Only nausea and emptiness. No, no,
"No problem, Captain. All messages will be delivered and the Tower will be kept in full operation in your absence.”
Tony held up the hand that didn’t hold the coffee mug. “Let me finish.” Steve closed his mouth and waited. “But I also really thought about what you said to me yesterday. About everything you said to me yesterday. And I can’t even think that you were lying. You don’t lie, Steve,” Tony struggled with the words. Those had to be the right words, because that was the most important moment. More important than the conversation the night before, than the moans of pleasure, more important than everything, because from then on, everything would change, for better or for worse. “You
Nick Fury was always punctual when it came to starting their meetings and that day wasn't different.
Faster than anyone could expect - but who could have predicted something like that would happen? - The girl lifted her right hand and a powerful beam of light struck Clint on the shoulder, causing him to spin in the air and fall a few feet away. Immediately, Vision and Thor lunged at her, while Sam flew to check if Clint was all right. And Natasha... for some reason, Natasha pulled away enough to watch, but not to get involved. Something prevented her and she did not know what it was. What she really knew was that the girl was fighting very well. She could not be more than eighteen years old, but she certainly was not younger than Peter. Still, her dodging movements were fluid and light, but her attacks were precise and with brute force, not to mention the powerful beams of light coming straight from the palm of her hands. She was a formidable opponent. Two of the most powerful Avengers were engaged in the fight against her, and yet the girl was still standing, with no more than a few scratches.
Steve held up his hand and stopped an insolent tear from running down Tony’s face. With the same hand, he grabbed Tony’s chin and lifted it gently, as if Tony were something precious that could break at the slightest touch. Steve took the coffee mug from Tony’s hand, bent down, and placed it on the floor, along with his own. When he got back to Tony’s height, Steve took his hands and smiled without showing his teeth.
“Don’t be so hard on her. She was scared and scared for you. She just wanted to protect you from more pain.”
"I think he's had his freeze time for about three lives, Tony." She held up her hands, defending herself when Tony wanted to interrupt her. "But I understand you, okay? Just get ready for the party and make him happy.”
Tony approached the table and sat in one of the available chairs. Steve pulled the other one closer to where Peter was forced to stay because of the handcuffs and continued to hug his son. He would enjoy being around Peter for as long as he could. And Peter didn't seem to mind, because he was accommodating to the curve of Steve's embrace, taking over the space that had always been his.
“I thought time could make you see what I saw,” Steve said, standing up, almost in slow motion. He straightened up and stopped, giving Tony a chance to leave if he wanted to. Tony didn’t move. He couldn’t do it; his legs were glued to the floor and his ears needed to continue listening to what Steve had to say. Seeing that Tony wouldn’t leave, Steve took a step forward, slowly, without taking his eyes off Tony even for an instant. Tony was the cornered, dangerous and withdrawn animal, ready to escape at any moment and Steve was using all his persuasion to make him listen, to make him stay and
Steve lost his breath again with the sweetness in Tony's expression and words. Did he remember what it was like to be taken care of? Could he let it? Tony grinned, looking at the door handle, encouraging. And Steve knew that yes, he would be able to let Tony take care of his family. And with that huge revelation, Steve turned the handle, opened the door and his heart broke into a thousand pieces.
At that moment, the car stopped and they pulled away. They were outside a large shed with huge gates open, and inside, a small white and red jet was already with the turbines on and the ladder lowered.
Steve considered the question and said nothing for a while. Finally, he let out a resigned sigh. “I don’t know.” He stopped for a moment. “Do we really need to leave?”
That was the last straw and Tony decided he’d already endured beyond what was humanly possible. Steve exposed himself to the sex-pollen because he wanted Tony as much as Tony wanted him.
"Friend Banner still having trouble controlling the Hulk?" Thor asked. It was still disturbing to look at Thor in civilian clothes, Tony thought, walking a few steps behind the God of Thunder. It was like watching a bizarre dream come to life.
“What's it?” Tony had lost all good humor. “Haven't you ever seen a couple in love before? This here” he pointed to himself in Steve's lap “shocks you? If the answer is yes, you don’t even have to waste your time hanging around.”
How Tony could not have Steve's warm body glued to his, to have his soft mouth in his, to feel the eagerness of his tongue exploring and longing for Tony like he'd never before thought he could be wanted? How could he live without that with Steve so close?
"Yeah, you get the perfect height up there." He moved enough to stand between Tony's legs, which wasted no time and stuck Steve between them.
Tony let out a nervous laugh, that sounded fake even to him. “Why do you think I still have something to tell? I already said everything.”
As if walking away from Steve’s body and supporting himself by his own forces was a torment, Tony walked away and looked at Steve, without much will.
Tony shrugged, as if it was nothing, but inside, his heart was racing and everything else had turned to jelly. “I can be very persuasive.”
Steve frowned at the sudden change of subject, but nodded. “Yes. I don’t know how many times, but I know there were many. Enough to analyze it from the most different angles. Why?”
“You're very naïve if you think you're going to be able to stop me,” the A.I.M. leader said. “Nothing can stop my greatest creation and destroy the Avengers will be perfect to show the world what we are capable of.”
With a sigh of pleasure Tony glanced at the living room in front of him, with the huge TV, the plushy rug and soft sofas, and he resisted the temptation of throwing himself into one of them to turn around and head towards the kitchen, where the others were, each on a sit around the huge marble counter.
Everyone expected it to happen, but not so fast. The incursion had arrived much sooner than it was anticipated and that was a surprise indeed, after all, Tony Stark never missed his calculations. But now there was no time to think about what could have gone wrong, what comma had been put in the wrong place, or which decimal place had been skipped. Now, the most important thing was to finish the only way to get someone alive out of that incursion.
"Let's clean you up," Tony smiled as he wiped the towel over Steve's body, wiping away all cum and sweat.
that this is really happening,” she sighed heavily. “I'm sorry it doesn’t make it any other way, because I'm sure you're amazing people. I don’t think it's possible that any version of my parents could be less than that.”
“We don’t have any more time,” he said, pulling away and looking at Steve. And Tony was sure that the expression of pain on the other's face was a mirror of his own.
Tony laughed, drank some of his coffee, and looked at Steve through the reflection in the window. “I need a shower.” He tilted his neck back to try to see Steve's face, who was looking down at him with a sly smile. “Actually, we need a shower. You promised me one when we woke up. Well, we’re awake.”
innocent, because if Natasha puts her hand on the fire for someone, I do too. Second: if she used the favor, she had with me to ask me to come here to defend the boy, the case was
As soon as Tony got out of the elevator, the smell of pizza took over all his senses and his stomach growled.
“Okay. Easier, huh?” Tony repeated and took a deep breath. “Well, I still think I don’t deserve you,” Tony looked quickly at Steve, but looked away. He wouldn’t be able to finish if he kept getting lost in those blue eyes. “I still think you can find something better and that you’ll regret having me around more than necessary.”
"She said no. That they were going to go through a lot already, and that they didn't need to know that Aunt Nat and Uncle Barnes were spies for an agency that, officially, doesn't exist."
"No, of course not," Tony finally replied. And then it was his turn to narrow his eyes. "Do you have a problem with that, Fury?"
Completely naked, with his cock throbbing, red, hard, leaking and desperately in need, Tony hugged Steve with his legs.
At that moment the door to the meeting room opened and Tony came in smiling, wearing a kneaded black T-shirt, black sweatpants and bare feet, and with his hands raised, apologizing.
“Boyfriend?” He tasted the word. It tasted new, unlike anything else, and just like Steve's kiss, it was good. More than good, delicious, and fit perfectly. “Boyfriend.”
Tony sighed. He never realized that he really had a masochistic side, but apparently Steve had the power to awaken all of the dark and unexplored sides that Tony had. For the good and for the bad.
"As for you seeing your son, Captain," Ross turned to Steve. "I'm going to ask one of my men to take the boy to one of the visiting rooms. It won't take long," the Chief walked around the table and headed for the door. "I'll be right back," and so Steve and Tony were alone inside Chief Ross's office. Before the two could exchange a word, Ross returned and stood at the doorframe, holding the door open. "You two can come."
"Three portals, Captain," AI's voice answered immediately. "One to the north, one to the east and one to the west of the Tower.
"Minus one, Steve. Minus one," Tony winked at him and turned, heading for a table, where a middle-aged woman was sitting at. Steve stood there, watching Tony walk away, while reliving the wink in his looping mind. His stomach followed the loopings and that was a welcome distraction after the press attack.
. But I had made up my mind that I’d do everything possible to make up for that horrible first impression you have had of me. I wanted to be close to you, to love you, even if, for that, I had to pretend that I felt nothing but friendship. If that was the price to pay to have you around, I would pay.
By the reflection of the window glass, he saw Steve smiling, holding the coffee mug Tony had brought for him. “I’m sorry.”
And, much to Tony's surprise, Steve Rogers, the bastard, smiled. "I'm not uncomfortable, Tony. It just caught me off guard," he started to arrange the vegetables in the pan - eggplant, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes. "I just didn't remember what it felt like anymore."
Tony had never told anyone that, but since he and Steve were there, since they were planning to start over, nothing could be fairer than having no secrets between them. Not even one that big.
It hadn't occurred to Steve that Tony would need a place to stay and that this place would probably be a hotel. "Where will you stay?" Steve asked.
Tony finished cleaning Steve and himself, set the towel on the floor beside the bed, and crawled into the embrace Steve had opened for him. Steve turned around so they were facing each other, hugged him with his free arm, and Tony snuggled into the crook of his arm.
“But, as you may have noticed, funerals don’t keep me on the other side for long,” Steve said, taking a sip of coffee. “After all, I wasn’t, in fact, dead.”
"This is so unfair," Peter said. "I've almost killed myself studying. I was stuck inside this Tower for days!”
He slid his mouth from Steve's to catch his breath and came down the soldier's neck, kissing and getting drunk with the wonderful scent that only Steve had. When Tony was doing the reverse, returning to his mouth, he smiled and bit Steve's earlobe, making the soldier groan loudly and squeeze Tony's ass.
"Us too, Hercules," Steve smiled without showing his teeth. His energies were already at the end and he hadn’t much left to even try to be diplomatic.
Maybe he could have stopped the shots. Maybe he could have seen where the sniper was positioned. Perhaps he could have been able to predict that something like that would happen. Perhaps he could have thought about improving security. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps. Maybe he shouldn’t have supported the Law. Maybe he could have asked Steve to talk before everything was blown apart. Maybe they could have reached an agreement. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.
"Get ready for the landing," Pierre said over the loudspeakers. Soon after, the whole plane shook with the impact of the wheels touching the ground. A short time later, the aircraft was finally stopped and the door opened, releasing the ladder. Pierre put his head back out of the cabin. "Have a good time. Your car is waiting for you out there, Mr. Stark.”
, that I couldn’t do it.” Steve put his hand behind his head and scratched the back of it, as if he were suddenly uncomfortable. He sighed, looked up, and looked again a few inches to the left of where Tony really was. “We need to talk.”
“We need you to investigate Doom and see if you can figure out if he's planning something,” Steve said.
With his hands still wrapped around Steve's neck, Tony brought him close and kissed him, feeling the softness of Steve's lips that he had always dreamed of, his short breath, and the delicious sigh he released when Tony outlined Steve's lips with his tongue, demanding passage beyond the softness. Tony wanted
“Are you serious?” Tony was shocked. That conversation was taking unexpected turns. They were just supposed to take off their clothes and have sex like animals, until that damn pollen was completely out of Tony's system. This shouldn't become a confession.
Tony ran for the ship and opened the transparent cover to press a few buttons on the panel and set it all before takeoff.
“Yes, you can,” Steve came over and kissed him, because he simply could. Tony responded with enthusiasm, squeezing Steve’s cheeks and enjoying the moans that made his whole body vibrate. Steve pulled away to take a breath and ran the side of Tony’s neck slowly with wet kisses, ending with a hickey where the neck and collarbone met. Tony sighed loudly and tightened his arms around Steve, running his fingers down his back, pressing his body against Steve’s, trying to reach any piece of skin he could get with his mouth, because he needed to taste Steve.
He looked back at Steve who was staring at him intensely behind his long eyelashes. Tony's body shuddered.
And. I. Don’t. Remember.” Tony covered his face with his hands and tried to take a deep breath, but the air just didn’t find the right way for his lungs. He felt his hands heat up and get wet.
“Tony, look at me.” Tony took a deep breath and did what Steve asked, meeting eyes so full of love that he thought he could drown. “Now, pay close attention to what I’m going to say to you, and please don’t be mad at me later, okay?”
Tony gave a sad smile. “People don’t call me a genius for nothing, you know? My brain is like a supercomputer. And, after I merged with Extremis, it was as if I upgraded it and had almost infinite information processing and storage capacity. I know that. Norman eventually realized that, too. Then he came after me and I fled the world, with the help of the few allies and friends that I had left after the fiasco that was the end of the Civil War and the invasion of the Skrulls.”
He took a handbag, folded the clothes, took the shoes Friday had chosen, put it all in, and froze at the closet door.
Wanda threw a bolt of energy into Cerberus's exposed right flank, which snarled and turned to face the source of the attack. Without giving the monster a chance to get close to Wanda, Steve threw his shield into one of the animal's front legs, which roared with three heads.
"I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe it," Tony said calmly. "But the police don't believe you and your DNA there complicates things a lot. But it doesn't make them impossible to be resolved. You just said you didn't know the boy. That's important. I'll start setting up your defense from there," Tony took out the notepad in the briefcase and started writing on it.
Steve finally understood everything and he wasn’t sure if he felt himself relieved or worried that Tony could be such a genius but also so stupid some times. “Tony, do you really think everything I said to you was a flower that made me say?”
"Happy," Wanda answered without hesitation. "With the fullest and most peaceful countenance I’ve ever seen in you. I mean, ever since we met, I've never seen you smile so much. Even when you think there's no one watching you, you're smiling.”
It was everything he wanted the most. Steve invited him, without anger, without harsh words, just an invitation. And Tony couldn’t do it. He stared at where Steve had been, the marks of his arms where he leaned against the rail, still visible in the snow.
was the name of that look. Tony slowly licked his lips and Steve's reaction was instantaneous: his pupils dilated and his eyes followed, avidly, the movement of his tongue, as a hunter follows the prey's movements.
“Really. Start doing this while I'm going to get the ingredients for the sauce.” Steve went to the pantry, got the nutmeg, the onion, the milk, and went back to the kitchen to get the butter and broccoli in the refrigerator. He put everything on the counter next to Peter. “How's it going?”
” Tony surrendered. He knew that tone of voice. It was rare, therefore, very precious. That was the tone of voice Steve used when he was vulnerable and exposed.
“You’re thinking too loud, Tony.” Steve smiled warmly and ran his finger between Tony’s eyes, undoing a frown of concern that Tony hadn’t even realized had formed. “You’re worrying about things that don’t need a formula or preparation in advance. You don’t have to be the futurist now. Let things happen, Shellhead.” Steve grinned. “Remember what I told you yesterday?”
We'll know how Tony and Rhodes know each other, how Tony and Natasha are related, and we'll also have Tony and Peter talking alone for the first time.
"Welcome to Dubai, Mr. Stark,” a man in a very well-tailored suit received him at the hotel door and showed him the way to the reception. "Have you had a good trip?"
"Come on, Rhodes, tell me, what am I not seeing here? Which piece is still missing from my puzzle?" Tony felt his entire body vibrate. He couldn’t conceive the idea that his friend, best friend, perhaps, could be a corrupt policeman, forging evidence, or, at best, covering up someone else. It wasn’t a scenario that made sense.
busy, but not with what Steve or anyone else up there could think of. Tony's mind was filled with the conversation he had heard.
"Well, that's great," Natasha tried to sound more excited than worried. "So you know what we're doing and we just want to help you. Come with us. Or do you have somewhere else to go?”
Now that the team had more members, they had agreed on a time off schedule. So, when one part of the team was out, the other would be on duty, monitoring everything, in case the Avengers were needed.
, darling, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the moment with the one I desire the most in the world, does it?” Tony tightened his grip enough to make Steve scream a delightfully
I know that what we lived is much more complex than what I made it seem, but today isn’t the right time. Today, it is time to say that you are a mirror of my dreams, someone so special that transforms my days in a hundred different ways in just twenty-four hours. You take me from the chaos to paradise in just an instant, with just one look. You are that delicious sensation that the autumn chill brings, that shiver that something is about to happen. Living with you is always being in an eternal expectation, knowing that something incredible can happen at any time.
Even with the low lighting, Tony could see Steve turning red and it lighted up a warning light on his head.
The tears that had stopped were harder in Liz's eyes. She covered her mouth with one hand, sharply shocked, and staggered back.
“Since I first saw you, I knew I would never forget you. I knew I would never forget your face again.
“Tony, I-I don’t know what to say,” Steve sobbed. His expression was transfigured in pain and guilt. “I should’ve managed to let you know that I was okay.”
“Tomorrow,” Steve replied in a voice that was far, almost asleep and content. “We can shower together.”
Together, as it should have always been, we saved the entire universe. We found and held those stones together, shared the power, hurt each other, but we did what was necessary to save each other. We managed to undo mistakes that should never have been made, such as never having the courage to admit what we really felt for each other, since that very first meeting.
Steve’s hands came to life and hugged Tony around the waist, but soon they went through everything they managed to reach, until he reached the hem of his own shirt that Tony was wearing and pulled it up, leaving Tony gloriously naked, but now under a completely new and hypnotic light. Steve slowed his own movements and Tony imitated him, until they were with their heads resting on each other, breathing hard, unable to look away from each other.
The door opened with a hiss and Tony entered the vault, holding the box under his arm. There were no shelves or any surface on which he could place the box, so it would have to be on the floor anyway. Tony walked to the middle of the vault, crouched down, placed the box on the floor more carefully than he intended and stood up.
“I just wanted to let you know that I was going to reach you,” Steve continued, speaking into the night. If someone passed by there, they could find two things from that scene: Steve was crazy or he was Romeo swearing to Juliet by the moon. Tony tried to laugh at his own ridiculous joke, but only managed to sob. Steve was going to try to talk to him. He was. Tony tried to blink to get the tears out of his eyes. He wanted to see Steve, in addition to just hearing him. “But, you know, Tony, everything has been so crazy since I … well, since I
him, even if at a distance and that that person happened to be someone who had gone to war with you, told you several lies, manipulated you, tried to kill you and, in the end, lost all memory about it trying to save what’s left of the friendship between you. An unsolicited and not well-liked guardian angel.
Tony punched the marble from the kitchen island and stood up, rubbing his face, frustrated, irritated, hurt by the injustice that was all that. He walked in circles and ended up facing Steve again, with open arms, gesticulating like a crazy man. “All I have are second-hand memories and second-hand feelings from the most important moment in our lives to date. It doesn’t seem fair that I have a hole where painful memories should be,” Tony found himself shouting, but he didn’t care. He had been holding on since he got in that apartment. “I should learn lessons from these memories, it was all a mistake,
"He's the Greek god of War, and that dog in his company is Cerberus," Thor frowned. "He should be guarding the gates of the Underworld.”
Unfortunately, a short time later, I discovered such a big secret, a secret that wasn't mine to tell, that, for the first time in a long time, I didn't know what to do. I didn't have an answer for what to do with that information, that was so serious, and had the power to transform our lives forever. I thought of you before anything. I thought about how you would feel, how it would affect your life, how you would react. Then I wondered if it would bring us together or tear us apart.
Steve finished slicing the zucchini and started slicing peppers. Tony was amazed by the scene in front of him. It had absolutely nothing special, but he just couldn't take his eyes off Steve holding the knife and his hand going up and down, up and down as the blade sliced through the vegetables.
Tony didn’t know if Steve was simply referring to his wardrobe. It seemed to be much more than just “you can borrow my clothes whenever you want”. It seemed deeper and more meaningful.
Peter looked directly at Tony, who was still driving, following the GPS instructions. But Tony did his best to return Peter's gaze. "I understand you, Peter. And I believe you. It all makes a lot of sense. I see no reason why you killed this boy. But the police think that there’s not only a reason, but they’re sure it was you."
"Good." Steve played with the label on the bottle, still looking at Tony, saying nothing for a while. It wasn’t an uncomfortable silence, but it wasn’t pleasant either. Tony wanted something to happen, for him to say something, to
“Why didn't you ask Reed?” Natasha asked. “He has a lot more equipment that could protect your box and he handles these weird things a lot more than we do.”
"Hmmm, you taste great, baby," Tony said in a husky, hushed voice, "but we'll see the rest, will we?"
Tony was impressed by the boy's quick thinking. "Yes, that’s an inconvenience. But we have to have several lines of thought if want to find the one that’ll be the most solid and the most efficient to prove your innocence."
Holding Tony as the most precious thing in the world, Steve laid him on the lab's floor and followed with his hands the contours of his slim and strong body, that the undersuit outlined so well, and which supported the armor that transformed Tony into the shiny armor knight that Steve adored, while leaving kisses on his pecs, his nipples - one at a time, worshiping them, learning which movements Tony liked best, which ones made him sigh the loudest.
“Immediately.” Five seconds later, the best and most terrifying news. “Captain Rogers is on his way to the lab.”
“This flower has enough spores to contaminate entire groups for a few hours and individuals can spend up to four days under the effect of pollen, if they are not treated.” Strange shrugged.
“Okay, Friday, what do we got?” Tony asked A.I. as soon as he landed with Steve in the middle of the others.
Steve stopped before picking up one of the glasses and stared at Tony, who smiled behind the coffee mug. This was an inside joke of their own. The whole country knew that the Fourth of July, the national date, was Captain America's birthday, and that coincidence every year generated a commotion. What no one seemed to remember was that the Fourth of July was also Steve Rogers' birthday, the man under the mask. And Tony made a point of teasing Steve every year, until the other started not to care anymore, but to have fun with the teasing.
Without waiting for another invitation, Steve took off Tony's shirt, threw it away, and leaned over to traverse Tony's chest with kisses, past his collarbone, through his abdomen and back to kiss the scars of the arc reactor. Tony swallowed. With all that excitement, he had forgotten this small but important detail. He had always been confident about his own body, but no one had ever done anything like that. Steve kissed the scars almost with devotion, with a delicacy that left Tony out of breath - and this had nothing to do with the heat of the moment. Tony had never felt so naked and so safe in his life. Steve would never hurt him. There was only love.
Taking advantage of the fact that he was clinging to Steve's shoulders, Tony turned him, guided him to the huge bed behind them, and, still smiling, shoved Steve toward the soft mattress. The soldier laughed and Tony found himself thinking he could hear Steve laughing forever. It was a wonderful sound and Tony barely heard it while they were living their life as Earth protectors.
“To lose you again,” Tony found himself speaking quietly. “But this time I will remember everything.” He looked at Steve, took a deep breath and continued. It was now or never. “I’m afraid to accept that it’s no longer possible to separate our lives, because every time I try to move away, chaos sets in and I realize that I can’t imagine my life without you. I’m afraid to open my heart, as I’m doing now, and to give you my heart in the end, and confess that I’m in your hands. I tried to stay away, to forget, but the truth? Do you want the truth?” Steve nodded and Tony resigned himself. It was about time to stop the lies, to deny the evidence. Tony squeezed Steve’s hands. “The truth is, I am and I have always been crazy about you, Steve.” Tony realized that since he had arrived at the apartment, that was the first time he had said Steve’s name out loud. It tasted good, sweet and comfortable in Tony’s tongue, as if it were meant to be spoken by Tony all the time.
"I can't catch anything," Steve managed to smile between his hard breathes. "Super-soldier serum bonus. Besides, I trust you."
"I think the food can wait a little." Steve leaned closer and kissed Tony, who sighed. He squeezed his fingers in Steve's hand he was holding, while his other hand slid through Steve's messy hair, his back, until he reached his butt, completely naked, exposed and waiting for Tony, who squeezed it willingly, Steve's groan reverberating throughout Tony's mouth.
Encouraged by the sounds of Steve, Tony finally hold the soldier's cock and, without waiting for a confirmation, he licked all that length.
Especially now that the most surreal and incredible news, and an answer to Tony’s most secret prayers, had reached him. Steve Rogers was alive. He was back, walking between us. And Tony needed to see it for himself.
“This is crazy, Tony!” Steve laughed, still unable to believe. "Why didn’t you ever say anything before?"
Steve said nothing. He wasn’t even looking at Tony. He faced his own hands, crossed over the island. Tony just waited, because now he had all the time in the world. He felt light, as if the weight of the world had been lifted off his back. He had no idea what time of night it was, but he didn’t care. Now Steve knew and it was up to him to decide what to do with all that information. It was no longer Tony’s task.
“Well, what changed was that you and I had a fight, I forgot everything, I almost died, and then I found out that you had died,” Tony said without stopping stroking Steve’s hair, but Steve opened his eyes, focusing on Tony’s. “At that moment, when I heard the news, I lost all hope, Steve. Outside I was impassive, telling everyone that I didn’t regret anything, that I would do it all over again if needed, but as soon as I came home at the end of the day, I would curl up in bed and cry myself to sleep, thinking that I would never see you again.”
"Love you too," Steve hung up the phone and went to answer the door. He didn't know what he was expecting, but, well, it definitely wasn't that. "Hello?" Steve greeted, and frowned when the intonation was a question.
Tony knocked on the door three times and waited. "Come in," asked a voice from the other side of the door. Tony opened the door, and he and Steve entered a simple room, surrounded by cabinets and windows covered by horizontal blinds and, right in the middle of the room, a large table, covered with files, a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse and, behind all this, a man in his sixties, with a mustache and white hair, dark, serious eyes, framed by closed eyebrows, as if in constant concern, pursed lips, wearing a white shirt with the Boston and Massachusetts police insignia, a navy blue tie, and arms crossed in front of his chest.
“I just didn't want it to be a blind obligation, Tony.” Steve said quietly. “I take consent seriously, you know?”
He focused his gaze across the room, at Steve, who was looking back at him. "Steve, darling, I dedicate this one to you." Tony pointed at him. "Do what you want with this information."
Tony shook his head and tried to clear his throat, trying to get a sound out of him. "Be my guest. Ha-ha,” he tried to make a joke. What a terrible one. “I'm going to my room to take a shower, too. See you in a little while," and fearing to say anything else that could blow his brain, Tony went to his room. Without trying to think too hard about the fact that Steve hadn’t only been offended by what he had said, but had liked it, Tony took his shower - freezing - as fast as he could, after all, even though a part of him was loving it, this almost romantic comedy film plot that, apparently, was unfolding in parallel in his life at that time, he had far more important things to solve. He got out of the shower and went back to the room with just a towel wrapped around his waist, and then took out his cell phone to dial the second number on the direct dial. Two rings later, she answered.
Tony switched on the stove, picked up the frying pan in the cupboard, and left it warm as he turned on the coffee machine and watched the grains being milled at once. The smell of coffee filled the air and Tony returned to the eggs, which were quickly ready, along with the bacon.
“How long until it's ready?” A worried and urgent voice coming from the door shouted louder than the alarm.
Tony came over and held out his hand. "Chief Ross, nice to meet you, I'm Tony Stark," the two greeted each other. "And this is my client, Captain Steve Rogers," Tony pointed to Steve, who was taken aback by the title. He hadn't heard it in a long time. He knew what Tony was doing, trying to intimidate the Chief. It was classic. Did he still remember how to play that game? Steve approached the Chief's table and held out his hand, which Chief Ross accepted. The Chief's handshake was a little more forceful than necessary, but Steve was stronger than average. Nothing he couldn't take. He smiled without showing his teeth. "Nice to meet you, Chief. Thanks for having us."
“I'm not feeling very well, Steve.” Tony tried to smile, but what came out was a frown. Was he really saying words? What was that… talking! Yes, he was talking to Steve.
