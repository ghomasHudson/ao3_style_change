Waking up in the twenty-first century was like waking up on a different planet. Nearly seventy years had gone by since Steve was here last and the world had changed so dramatically it no longer seemed to be human anymore.
“He’ll give himself a nervous breakdown trying to control everything, and he’ll be flying about left and right and smack himself right into the side of a building! He’ll be like one of those pigeons that kamikaze the windows every so often, some innocent secretary will be typing away quite happily, then suddenly there will be a thud as Sam splatters over the window, scaring her half to death and we’ll get sued because she’ll spill her coffee all over herself and get third degree burns from it and psychological trauma and probably have a phobia of windows for the rest of her life!”
“Jay I need to narrow this down.” Tony said heading up the stairs, a couple of guards fired at him from the third floor, the bullets bouncing off harmlessly, Tony returned fire blowing up the balcony forcing the guards to run for cover or be blown to pieces.
“Next time you’re pissed off, just punch a wall honey, Okay? It might do you less damage!” he quipped, getting a weak chuckle from Tony,
“Giving a fuck?” Steve asked raising an eyebrow.
“Alright, I’ll get a wheelchair and portable oxygen.” He said in defeat, “Make sure he stays put.” He said to Natasha as he went past her.
“Don’t you ever touch my Mother!” He shouted at Norman, taking a protective stance before Tony.
As Tony and Thor’s repulsors and lightning struck at the outer walls of the castle an alarm went off and the troops inside began to pour out, some on bikes, some on foot, and some in military jeeps.
“Stark is with child!” The Skrull screamed.
He, Tony, and Zach had been pretty much living off what they could get at local fast food joints or grab in the hospital cafeteria. Peter was getting hospital meals three times a day, it wasn’t the best food as hospital food never was, but it was better than nothing, as was the food that Steve and Tony were bringing in with them.
Natasha gently lay a hand on his knee and squeezed, offering him both support and comfort.
“I’ll be peeing in a water bottle after dark, no way in hell am I risking going into the woods where a cannibalistic clown will be hiding, or some freak in a ski mask.”
“Isn’t there anything we can do?” Steve asked, reaching up and taking hold of Tony’s hands, tugging him around so that the Omega came and sat in his lap.
Steve gave him a choked sound laugh, “You sure do Son, I don’t suppose you could help me and Tony out, could you? We could do with somewhere to patch ourselves up.”
“You could have done more to save us.” Was always his final words before he slipped away, leaving Tony alone to witness the horror of his children.
Tony pursed his lips and tutted, “I don’t know, I think you’d find me pretty hard to handle.”
“Because they’d kill you quick and she’ll torture you to death with her heels.” Happy replied.
Steve and the boys were allowed to go into Intensive care to see Tony, the others had to wait outside. There was a risk of infection so the Doctors only wanted the least number of visitors at Tony’s bedside.
The memories were as haunting as a ghost, and while Steve knew, that in time they would bring him solace, that he would remember these things with a smile and take pleasure in them, right now his grief was still to raw, the loss to fresh in his mind for him to find anything by sorrow.
Tony’s lips quirked into a smile, “The Star Spangled, apple pie for everyone, path?” he teased.
“Makes the perfect housewife, doesn’t he?” Tony commented, engrossed in his coffee and the suites wiring.
Zach’s involvement in the killing of Killian they all agreed to keep out of the official story, if the word got out that Zach had helped to kill a man then it would bring him all the worst kinds of attention.
“Good enough for me.” He said, leaning forward and kissed Zach’s head, “Now, you go and wake your Brother up while I get a start on the pancakes.”
“That ain’t what my Stomachs saying!” Clint grumbled and Steve could agree with him, hoping that the main course was more filling.
“You know, I’d let you drive back, but you got your licence in the dark ages and I don’t think you handle my baby.” Tony said, tossing his keys into the air and catching them.
Like Steve, Bruce was just as impressed and overwhelmed by the floor he’d been given, insisting on at least being allowed to cook dinner by way of thanking Tony, since the Billionaire wouldn’t accept anything else.
Stark Raving Shocker!
This took both Tony and Steve by surprise, they had not expected Peter to ask about or even think about Harry Osborn, they weren’t friends, hadn’t even been friendly to each-other. The fact that Peter was showing concern for him just went to show how good of a kid he was.
Bruce paused in his run to take off his glasses and put them in his pocket, he also took off his jacket and shirt, pausing when he saw Natasha and Clint running towards them, “We’ve got help.”
“Jarvis, you better have a damn good excuse for this.” Tony growled as he staggered to the suit and climbed in quickly taking control.
“Leave him alone you bitch!” Steve bellowed as wrestled with Roger’s, despite their difference in build they were fairly well matched in strength and Roger’s was ten years younger than Steve which did give him an edge that he was taking advantage of.
“I never meant to hit her I just wanted to shut her up!” Harry shouted jumping to his feet.
They waited and waited, Happy went and got food for Pepper, Rhodey, and the boys, Zach fell asleep on Steve’s chest, Peter was dozing off with his head on Steve’s shoulder and everyone had fallen into a silence as they waited, then finally the consultant came into the waiting room.
Silently Natasha agreed with him while she came to terms with the fact that Tony now thought of her as family and had gone out of his way to secure her future. It made her even more determined to protect him and his family from those who’d rip them apart, and if necessary then escape route or not, she would kill anyone and everyone who came for them.
“Right now, helping.” Clint replied, although there wasn’t much he and Natasha could do, the fires were burning too much for them to get close, all they could do was watch the others and keep and eye out for more drones as their teammates worked to get through the rubble, even Hulk, once he’d come forth did so, smashing his way through the debris like a plough, his sheer bulk forcing it back.
Wanda bared her teeth, “You’re one to talk Stark, your weapons have killed millions of babies.”
“She missed out sarcastic, short, flat footed, and has terrible taste in music.” Peter offered up.
“You could take him to a child psychologist.” Pepper suggested, “They may be able to help him deal with this healthily.”
Hulk grunted and Thor smiled, satisfied that his comrades were alive.
“Thanks.” Steve said, happy to have something else to do with his time that would be both practical and useful. This was his home now, this time, he needed to learn about it and how the world had changed, the good, the bad, and the ugly, he needed to know everything, not just the cliff notes that Shield or possibly Hydra had seen fit to give him.
“Oh that’s nice, you’re friendly neighbourhood Deadpool stops by for a nice chat and a maybe a bit of group masturbation, he even brings a friend along with him to join in…”
He looked up at Tony with big pleading eyes, begging to be allowed to stay. At this point Steve and Peter arrived panting, having run all the way.
The idiot started babbling about fortune cookies and then swore when Tony pointed a gun at his head.
“What Wanda did was wrong,” Steve said, rubbing his thumbs over Tony’s fingers, “And my treatment of you was wrong.” He wouldn’t let Tony cut him off, “It was Tony. I let Thor nearly strangle you, I threw my shield at you. Both of those things could have killed you.” The thought of Tony being dead made his stomach turn over, made his heart clench in fear. Tonight he had come so close to losing Tony, if he had been just a second later then Tony would have fallen and Steve would have see his broken body on the street below.
“A deal.” Curien repeated, “In return for immunity I will testify against Norman Osborn. He knew all about it, he was the one who hired me, the one who had Justin Hammer fit that self destruct, and he was the one who shot me.” Curien waved his remaining arm, “Go and get your superiors and I will tell them everything they want to know.”
Lila, Cooper, and Nate had already had most of their presents, but the team had gotten them a few small gifts to open so they could share in this with the adults.
Curien laughed, “He already has started.” He sneered at Steve, “Do you think I was the only Doctor on the payroll, the only one performing experiments? There are others and those facilities are still hidden, tests still on going.” He smirked at the two avengers, “You spend all your time worrying about Hydra, about aliens, about monster, you never stopped to think that the real danger might be closer to home and that a war had already been declared on you without you even knowing.”
Steve’s eyes widened and he began to stammer at Zach’s question, managing to fudge an explanation about having met a few Sperm Whales while he’d been under the ice in the arctic.
Steve had thought he’d already faced the worst moment in his life in 1942, when he’d been hanging off the side of a train trying to reach down and pull Bucky back to safety only to watch his best friend fall to what he’d been sure was his death.
“I wouldn’t want to impose,” Steve said, sniffing a bit, and shifting Lily in his arms, Tony’s eyes were drawn to her. His daughter, or that Tony’s daughter. She was beautiful, truly perfect.
Patting Peter’s shoulder, Happy sat down besides him at the table and the two waited for Bruce to serve the tea and take a seat himself. Peter reached out and snagged a cookie, breaking it in half but not eating it, “He’s not dead, is he?” He blurted out. Having already lost two sets of parents he was far more a aware of the possibility that parents could die than others were.
“No, I’m not stone, I’m a Mother, of course I’m not stoned. Come on, check this shit out.”
“Water bombs, flour bombs, and eggs, Sir, Master Peter has also decided to use his nerf gun. So I do urge you to head there soon.”
Peter sighed and set his pad on the beside table, “Dim the lights Jarvis,” He said, settling himself down to sleep.
“Fl..floor?” Steve stammered, “You’re giving us a floor?” He’d expected guest rooms, maybe large and luxurious with their own ensuite bathrooms, but a whole floor for him Bruce and Thor to share?
“I think I might have.” Steve said handing Tony a piece of paper. Frowning, Tony took it, opening it up and swiftly read the contents, his eyes widening as he did. When he looked back up Steve was slumped against the wall looking as if he’d been gut punched. “So, is it possible?” he asked helplessly, “Any of it?”
“A documentary crew have asked to get access to you all and film enough footage of your day to day lives to create a two hour long documentary.” Pepper explained. “Now, I know you are not fond of dealing with the media, but this would afford some positive press and exposure. Since the battle of New York a lot of attention had already been placed upon you and that had only grown since the battle in Washington, the Mandarin, and most recently, London.”
“But Shwarma after, right?” Tony said, he lifted an unsteady hand and tapped the remains of the helmet, “J, you there?”
Sound wasn’t the only thing that was amplified, Peter found that his skin was extra sensitive. He could feel each individual fibre of the sheets over him, the scratchy material of the hospital gown. His sense of smell was sickening too. He could smell so much, too much.
“Nothing!” Peter meeped, yeah, he needed to learn how to lie more convincingly, that wouldn’t fool a five year old. “But I do want to ask you something.” He said clearing his throat and tried to make himself relax.
By the time they had sorted this out and gone back to the tower to regroup, they were all exhausted, battered, and bruised, except for Thor who didn’t bruise, and Bruce he’d been fortunate enough to sit this one out.
Present time
Telling MJ and Peter over the weekend had been Steve’s suggestion, as it would give them time to answer any questions and alleviate any doubts that the pair might have before they went back to their respective parents.
“Well, yeah you did screw up, but I mean no, that is not an explanation.”
“That isn’t likely to work.” Tony said, “From what Jarvis has picked up, Strucker has an energy shield around his base, much like the one that was around the tesseract. To get inside the building we’ve got to get that down.”
He'd gotten Bruce a classic dark grey suit, with a white shirt, and black silk tie and pocket handkerchief. He figured that the understated elegant look would appeal to Bruce more than anything more flashy.
“So you let him get away huh?” Peter asked as he jogged up besides Steve.
“Alright then.” Steve said, “Everyone check your weapons, get a good nights sleep, and make sure to have decent dinner and breakfast because you’ll likely need the energy.” He rose an eyebrow as Clint lifted his hand, “Yes?”
Peter let out an ooff of air as Zach leaped on top of him, he was ready for bed, had even been put to bed and looked adorable in his Captain America pyjamas, especially with his gravity defying curls going every which way.
“Neither have I.” Steve said, “So, we’ll learn together.” He stepped forward his body towering over Tony but instead of making the Omega feel crowded he felt safe and protected, “I don’t care about scars, it’s just skin, discoloured skin, and this?” He gently placed his fingers on the arc reactor, not putting any weight on it just touching it, “This is a symbol of your strength, your ingenuity. You were in an impossible situation and you survived, you created this and used it to live and defeat your enemies, you should be proud of it not ashamed. Your body looks fine to me, I know they we are all our own worst critics when it comes to our appearances, but you really do look perfectly fine to me.
“Send a dozen into space to monitor activity in the solar system and keep watch for interplanetary threats.” Jarvis ordered. “Half a dozen are to stand guard in Stark Tower, and half a dozen shall accompany me to Prague where we shall project Sir and his family.”
“We pulled your medical records.” Fury said, “We went all the back to your infancy, and it seems that at three months old you were rushed to hospital with unexplained convulsions and bleeding from the ears and nose. You were admitted to the paediatric ward immediately and over the next five days you developed a fever that rose to 108 degrees. You continued to bleed and convulse, Doctors feared the worst, but on the sixth day the fever broke and the bleeding and convulsions stopped. No cause for the affliction were ever established and you were released from hospital three days later.”
“Unless anyone is hiding under your desk sir, then yes.” Clint replied looking under the desk, “Nope, no mole people.” Natasha slapped him upside the head.
“Terrifying.” Tony replied, “It wasn’t like our solar system with our sun and the planets and distant stars glowing in the background. There was nothing, just cold emptiness and that armada of Chitauri.” He looked over his shoulder, out of the window and up to the night sky, “They are still out there you know? That Nuke only took out one ship and maybe a couple of other vessels. The rest of them would have survived.” Tony flinched as Steve’s hand clasped his and he turned to look at Steve who was offering him a reassuring smile.
*****
Peter smiled, “It’s not as great as it sounds. Junk food doesn’t cut it, I don’t stay full long enough from it for it to be effective, so I have to follow a tailor-made diet now.” He looked at the pizza and grinned, “Most of the time anyway. Uncle Bruce helped design it.”
Tony glared at the archer but it was Natasha’s basilisk look that had Clint gulping, “Are you saying that there is something wrong with girls and women?” She asked in a frigidly cold tone.
“Why didn’t you save me?” He asked again,
“So you would, you fucking coward.” Rogers jeered, wrapping his arms about Steve’s legs and pulling them out from under him so he ended up on his back with Roger’s straddling him and punching at his face as Steve struggled beneath him, deflecting and taking blows, he wrapped one hand about Rogers throat and squeezed, cutting off Rogers air and making his face redden as he struggled to break free of the hold while trying to keep Steve pinned down.
“I’m sorry?” Steve said half glancing at her and hurriedly looked away, the woman wasn’t pleasant to look at; the skin of her face was pulled too tight, her eyebrows slanting up too much and her eyes looked permanently surprised, her mouth was made up in a far to bright shade of lipstick for anyone to wear, let alone a woman in her seventies whose skin tone had begun to fade regardless of cosmetic treatments, it was also overly plumped up with collagen and looked far too big for her face.
Steve would have pressed him but he had other reasons for being at the tower than to badger Tony about taking care of himself and so let it go for the moment.
“I know.” Steve murmured, holding Zach with one hand just long enough to turn off the TV, then he cradled him again, making his way to the sofa, where he sat down, beckoning for Peter to join him.
“I am not certain, agent Romanoff.” Jarvis replied, “It may well have been, it could also have been among other illegally sold munitions that unscrupulous military persons sell on the black market to arms dealers. It may have even been a counterfeit, without a serial number to check there is no way of verifying.”
Zach was too upset to listen to Peter though, he was scared, upset, over-tired, and angry, all of which were combining into one big melt down that was triggering his powers.
“He made it personal.” Suddenly it made sense, the lightbulb clicking on inside Tony’s head, “He hit us right where we live, and why?”
“But he’s okay now isn’t he?” Steve said, “You’re okay baby, everything is going to be okay.”
“Nice, good and firm with just enough squeeze.” Tony praised enjoying the fact that Steve’s face was turning crimson.
Peter tore open the skylight with ease, wincing at the metal shrieked and groaned, it clearly hadn’t been opened in a while and he coughed and spluttered as he was hit with a face full of real spider webs, a few disgruntled spiders scurrying away now he’d disturbed them. Peeling away the webbing Peter leaned down and looked inside what was clearly a lab. He could see huge glass tanks with things inside them, air tight work stations with external glove holes so scientists could work without exposing themselves, cages containing monkeys, rabbits, rats, and other animals were lined up with water and feeding tubes connected to them. The poor creatures probably never left their cages except to be experimented on.
The twins had been in Slovakia for several days now, they had crossed the border and hitched a lift to Puchov, where they had stayed in a motel over night, Wanda had convinced the owner to give them free room and board so they got to spend a night in a bed and have a decent meal the following morning before they left.
“Screw you Jay.”
*****
With Friday taking control of the systems and exploring the internet, Jarvis set the second faze of project Ultron in motion.
“What, what do you have to be sorry for Cap?”
“Steve I…” Tony broke off and cried out as a contraction hit, over the line he heard Steve asking what was wrong and Friday telling him to breathe.
“This is why we need an early warning system.” Tony declared.
“The hell?” Peter cried as Zach tore past him.
“Make a move Reindeer Games.” He said to Loki, his charged up weapons aimed right at him.
Twenty Hours earlier
*****
“He was,” Steve muttered, he ran a hand over his face tiredly, “He’s been playing vigilante, he went into the oscorp factory tonight and got caught.”
Natasha and Bruce watched as he marched away, shoulders back and head raised as if he were going heading to war.
After dinner everyone settled down to relax, reading, watching TV, surfing the net. Tony and Steve went out onto the balcony together to enjoy the last of the sunset.
“Nah, that’s alright.” Tony said patting Steve’s impressive bicep, “I’m not looking to get back on the dating scene.” He pulled his hand off Steve’s arm with some difficulty, really wanting to keep it there for a little longer. “But you should, start dating I mean.”
Fuck. Those words had even more meaning to them now.
“Oh no!” Natasha gasped, “He’s got Tony!”
“Yes, god yes, I’ve just never really dated anyone.” Steve said, his cheeks heating with embarrassment, “Before the serum no one wanted to date me, after the serum, well there was the war and I didn’t get time to date, I was either on the road with war bonds sales, or in the field. What down time I did have was spent with the Howlies and while there were… some encounters with Omegas and female Beta’s it wasn’t anything that lasted more than a few nights, if you know what I mean.” To Steve’s relief Rhodey just chuckled and nodded,
Yet, even though he knew this, Steve couldn’t help but imagine what it might be like to Alpha to such an amazing Omega, to be Father to two adorable (If occasionally terrifying) Boys. How wonderful it would be to wake up in bed with Tony every day, maybe even be woken up by Zach jumping on the bed, like on his birthday or Christmas day. He could imagine the Pup scurrying into the bedroom, bounding up onto the bed, his cheeks flush with excitement and hair a tangle of wild curls, demanding that his parents got up because it was Christmas day or his Birthday, or simply because it was morning and he wanted their attention.
“Breathe Steve, remember to breathe.” Sam encouraged wincing when Tony screeched Steve’s name on a fresh contraction.
Trembling, panicking, Peter tried to hold onto him, tried to keep his head from smacking on the floor, but it made no difference, the man fell completely limp after a few moments, his eyes staring blankly ahead as a thin stream of the black liquid continued to drip from his open lips.
“There’s a path down to the sea.” Natasha said from where she was standing in her bikini, “A natural worn one we can use.”
“Shut up you little fool!” Norman snapped grabbing his Son’s arm and pulling him to sit down but it was already too late, everyone had heard Harry admit to hitting MJ.
“Blueberry?” Zach asked with a frown that looked just like Tony’s,
“Why?”
“Peppercorn, come here.” Tony said spreading his arms. Letting out a wet sniffle Pepper moved to the bed and let Tony hug her. “There you go my Pepperoni, its alright, you don’t need to cry.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Pietro snapped lifting her up, “We have to go, now!” He sped off with Wanda leaving Tony in a spreading pool of blood.
Zach had been pretty sullen and withdrawn for the first few days when they’d gotten home, missing Tony and wanting to go back to Prague, but once school started he was sufficiently distracted by his friends and his lessons and soon perked up again, delightedly telling Tony everything he had done that day.
“Well. That was fun.” Tony said, dusting himself off, “Lets never do that again anytime soon, okay people?”
“Pete, don’t.” Steve said to him.
“Ship first.” Tony said, “Then Squidward and Uncle festers uglier cousin.”
The Omega bristled, “Had I known it was Hydra I was helping….”
In the light of the kitchen the pairs injuries were far more visible. Steve had a nasty gnash from his hairline down to his eyebrow, his nose was swollen and bloody, both eyebrows split, as were his cheeks, and his lips were swollen and caked in dried blood. When he took of his shirt bruising on his ribs, abdomen and back were clear to see from where Bucky had pummelled him.
“Are you ready to go back to bed?” Steve asked, “Or would you like to shower first, or maybe take a bath together?”
Clint froze up inhaling sharply very aware of Rhodey in a wheelchair not ten feet away from him, “I.. I didn’t mean…”
Gently, so he wouldn’t cause the Omega anymore pain than he was already in, Vision took Tony’s hands, holding them carefully and looked deep into Tony’s eyes, “I will find her, they will not take her from this base.”
The platinum blondes had not yet made their debut, that had been a product of the fifties, along with the flared skirts, and beehive hair.
Bruce hummed and tapped his chin thoughtfully, “Why would be work for Hydra though, why wouldn’t he escape?”
*****
A hard slapping sound reached Tony’s ears, then the right side of his face bloomed with pain and he tasted blood inside him mouth. His brows knitted together in confusion. He didn’t understand. Why could he taste blood? Why did his face hurt?
Ned’s face fell, “That sucks.” He admitted. “I guess you’d be in danger too huh, from people wanting to use your powers for evil.”
Zach nodded his head and wiped at his cheeks with a dripping wet arm, he frowned and looked around, “Why are we in a fountain Uncle Thor?”
“What is it?” MJ asked frowning.
“But you have coffee every day, and Daddy goes running every day, so why can’t I have pancakes every day?”
“It’s gonna be okay.” MJ whispered taking Ned’s hand as if to comfort him, but her hand was shaking as much as his and her palm was just as sweaty.
“Yes, Tony and I are engaged.” Steve said, “We are planning to marry in the summer.”
While they did this Clint headed back up to the top of the cliff to dive again. Once he reached the top he found both Bruce and Tony napping. Grinning he stole over to Tony unable to resist the chance to cause some mischief, he then scooped Tony up making the Billionaire yelp in surprise and start to thrash around in his arms.
“Great. Thanks for that.” Tony said pinching the bridge of his nose. “Jarvis, get one of the clear bots on it.”
“There’s a supply closet.” Tony said urging Steve on, “If we’re quiet and you keep your back against the door then no one can come in and….” Steve cut him off with a hand over his mouth.
“There is also great support for the team you are assembling to face Thanos, should he come here. You think that he will?”
“So Rogers came here to sight see, reminisce?” Clint asked,
“Whoa whoa!” The idiot protested hurrying to sit in a chair, “He’s here but he’s not here, its complicated.”
Thankfully Zach hadn’t walked in on them doing anything “Adult” yet, but they both knew it was only a matter of time and were dreading that happening.
“What do you wanna have?” He asked walking his fingers over Steve’s chest.
A small paper booklet was inside the box and it gave picture instructions on how to inject and how to safely dispose of the needles, in the sharps bin that was sitting besides the toilet. It also gave a list of common side effects.
Clint and Bruce began a meaningless conversation to pass the time until Thor and Sam returned, when they did Steve had a cup of terrible coffee pushed into his hand and a prepacked sandwich dropped on his lap along with a bag of crisps and a chocolate bar.
Rogers glowered at the news report on the screen that showed images of Bucky walking to a limo with Stark leading him. Bucky’s shoulders were hunched, he looked frightened, like a caged animal. Obviously Stark had taken him prisoner and was planning to do God knows what to him, maybe brain wash him to working for him like Hydra had done.
“Let us hope it never comes to that Bossman!” Friday drawled,
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose as Zach hurriedly began to help clean up, “I regret them ever meeting.” He sighed unhappily.
“Being the prick he is, Norman may want to complicate matters.” Tony sighed, “Fuck sake.” He cursed.
He wasn’t sure how long he, Peter, and Zach sat there like that, but none of them moved until the intercom phone rang. All three jerked in response and Peter got up, wiping his face as he went to answer the phone, after a few seconds he looked to Steve confused, “Security say there is a woman called Maya Hansen is downstairs. She says she knows Mamma and that she might know something about the Mandarin, she thinks her boss is involved and she knows he met with Pepper just before Happy was blown up. His name is Aldrich Killian.”
“All of the Avengers participate in keeping fit, including Tony Stark and Bruce Banner.” The Host explained into the camera, “Bruce Banner has to show caution when he engages in physical activity because if his heart rate and breathing increase too much then his alter ego, The Incredible Hulk may be triggered.
“The only neighbourhood you’d be friendly in is a morgue you deranged blow up doll!” Tony shot back at Deadpool, who placed his hands over his heart as if hurt, then grinned,
“The hell is he doing here?” She demanded, leaping to her feet and pointing an accusing finger at Tony.
Strucker considered this and nodded, "Do so, but only the bare minimum. They need to be able to defend themselves without the promise of protection, and what better way to learn quick relflexes than to have some blood drawn?
Clint snorted, “Morons.”
“Yes, I’ve got your Mamma as my “Guest” and he was very keen to know all about you, so much so that he was willing risk having his face melted off.” Killian lifted his hands and held them out palms up to show Zach as they became red hot. “Do you think you’d recognise your Mamma without his face?” He asked grinning down at Zach, “Do you think he’d recognise you without yours?” he approached the gurney and lay his hands down either side of Zach’s head, “Shall we find out?”
“And those attacks have had a lasting impact on both Peter and Zachary haven’t they?”
Compound.
“He’s had a couple of nightmares and wet the bed twice.” Tony said running a hand through his hair, “He can barely stand to be away from me for more than an hour, he’s terrified something is going to happen to me, that someone will take me away from him; he’s even asked Cap to train him so he’ll be able to fight any “Bad guys” who try to hurt me.”
“And do they give you any respect?” Tony asked as a laughing Steve lifted him off the sofa and carried him towards the lift, “You remember young man, I have fed you, and clothed you, raised and nurtured you so you could become Spideyman!”
“You said I look pregnant, or are at least hinting that I am.”
Steve supposed he shouldn’t be surprised by the fact that Tony had booked them into the best hotel in the city, rented out the president suite for them to use while they were staying there. But still, even though he had become used the tower, the expensive décor, finest cuisine, (Pizza, burgers, and other junk food not included) and every kind of modern convenience available, even some that weren’t yet commercially available, Steve couldn’t help but feel rather overwhelmed by the sheer opulence of the place.
Steve was determined to wait to court Tony until he had spoken to Rhodey, he was worried that the Colonel might not come to the tower for several weeks, being on active duty, but his fears were unnecessary as Rhodey showed up three days after their return from DC with forty eight hours leave to check on Tony, which granted Steve the opportunity to ask Rhodey’s permission to court the Omega Billionaire.
“Can I have marshmallows now?” Zach whined at Steve, he’d been asking since breakfast for the sweets.
Inside the suit Tony shut his eyes, tears rolling slowly down his ashen cheeks. “My life was ruined a long time ago, Wilson.” He said, in resigned monotone. “I’ve got fuck all left to lose.” He dived for Rogers again, but Romanoff leaped up into the air, lifted by Wanda’s magic, and landed on his back, sinking her widow bites into the suit, shorting out some of the systems and showering Tony in static shocks that left burst veins and superficial burns in their wake.
It was the following morning that everything went to shit. After Rhodey left to take the suit to Fort Edwards, and Pepper and Happy went to SI.
Homeroom and Peter’s first classes went well, he’d been keeping up with his school work at home so he wasn’t behind on any subjects or facing having to do extra work to make up his classes. He was able to gulp back a protein smoothie between algebra and Geography when his stomach started to growl and that kept him comfortable until lunch which he had outside on one of the benches with Ned and MJ.
“I’m sor..” He began but Steve cut him off.
“Well, lets hope we never have to use these plans, but if we do, then Thank God for Tony’s OCD need to protect his loved ones.” Clint said.
On the sand Natasha rolled her eyes as she stretched out to enjoy the sun, “Children.” She said closing her eyes. Sat in the shade Bruce chuckled, making himself comfortable and opened his book.
Peter huffed a laugh, "It's cuz m'special!" He said.
“Where are we going?” the Soldier asked.
It was around midnight when Tony awoke, half buried beneath Steve’s body. The larger man was snoring against his back and his arms were wrapped tightly about his waist, holding Tony close as if he were afraid that he might slip away.
“Gotcha.” Peter said hugging Ned again before retreating back to his own seat and grinned at Tony and Steve, “I think we’ll be okay now.”
“Who are you?” Rogers growled, glaring at Steve, who was still taken aback by the attitude here, not to mention Scarlet Witch. In his world she had been a villain, a terrorist in league with her Brother and Hydra. Tony had said that she was turning over a new leaf in this reality, but the similarities between his Wanda Maximoff and this one, did not convince Steve that she was any different.
“Christ he’s just a kid.” The Paramedic’s partner said feeling for a pulse, “He’s alive but his pulse is weak, we need to get him to a hospital now.”
A dead silence followed this revelation, the journalists, the moderator, all of them stared at their image of Tony not wanting to be the first to speak since none of them knew what to say.
“You carried me over your shoulder by my legs and had my face banging into your ass!” Spiderman exclaimed, “I was nearly face planted in the crack!”
Steve’s flush deepened, “I’ve no real experience with dating.” He admitted, “I wouldn’t know what to say or do. I can’t dance, certainly not modern dance, I struggle with Pop culture, I’d just make a fool of myself.”
He’d hoped that at least he’d be able to this for Steve, to at least be able to give him a child, but his stupid body had let him down again, refusing to let him do the one thing that Omega’s were meant to do for their mates.
“See, even she agrees.” Steve said, handing her over to Tony who glared at him as he took the girl, wincing when her grabby hands latched onto his beard and began tugging,
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve stiffened besides Tony, he was tempted to just shove all the reporters aside and take Tony to the waiting car but he knew that if they refused to say something then the less scrupulous amongst them would make up rumours that Tony couldn’t cope with being in a wheelchair, that he was depressed and despairing, falling apart, etcetera, so while it was a nuisance it was better to give the hungry hyenas something to chew on.
Some of the snow Zach was holding melted and rained down onto Steve’s head and face, rolling down inside his collar and sending an icy stream down his back. In a second he was unable to breathe, was stumbling and falling to his knees as he began to gasp and choke for air.
“Tony used to call the press Vultures too,” Steve said,
Eventually the two decided to stick together and began to attack the finger food on the trays that the servers were carrying while sipping at the champagne.
Rhodey chuckled and leaned in, giving Tony as strong a hug as he dared, “You’ll be alright, I know plenty of people who’ve been through this and come out the other side.”
But Tony had yet to return any of his calls, Rhodey was out of communication, overseas on some military mission, and Pepper wouldn’t even take his calls, her secretary threatening Rogers with having him charged with making nuisance calls if he didn’t desist in calling her office!
“What’s Sperm?”
“What is?” Sam cried, bewildered by what was going on.
“Pete.” He said, securing Zach’s sleeping form with his right hand while he extended his left arm to Peter, offering him a one arms hug. Peter hesitated for a minute, looking uncertain, then he sank down into the embrace. He turned and hide his face, pressing it into the back of the sofa and Steve pretended that he couldn’t feel the shudders running through Peters body or the tears that were dampening his shirt, he gave Peter his privacy and just held him as best he could while he tried to think of what to do now.
“Positively saccharine Sir.”
“I am.” Natasha said with a very convincing twang, “I’m looking for maternity, my Sister’s just given birth, or she is giving birth, I don’t know. The baby was due last week but didn’t arrive and I drove all the way from LA to be here and she wasn’t as her home and the neighbours said she was in the hospital and I can’t find the right floor!”
Zach’s fourth birthday.
Peter had news too, which he told Tony in a babble of word vomit and blushing cheeks, after some careful deciphering Tony figured that Peter was going with MJ to the prom on an actual date!
“Very much.” Steve replied in a low voice, “Especially since aren’t wearing those provocative shorts anymore.”
Nodding his head Steve swiftly kissed Tony’s cheek and accompanied the paramedics to the ambulance.
“She, is quite well I believe.” Vision said, “Although it may be prudent to have a paediatrician look her over and an Obstetrician look over Mr Stark.”
This was a problem and one the two of them had been dealing with since Zach had learned how to walk and when he was able to scramble out of his cot and make his way to his Mother’s bedroom when he was eighteen months old.
“And so handsome, is their a better word than Handsome? I’d say beautiful but that seems to girly. But he is beautiful, those clear blue eyes, azure, that’s what they are, azure. I like that word, Jay, make a not of that will ya?”
“Around the Potomac, just under five miles, usually takes me between thirty and forty minutes depending on wind direction and how tired I am.” Sam sounded proud at this, and he had a right to be, most people couldn’t run nearly five miles in thirty minutes, only professional athletes and those with military or service training could do it. Steve however could do better and couldn’t help but to show off.
Following this failure, Bruce and Natasha took over decorating the cake, this went well, expect for the fact that the icing sugar went everywhere, and they were thoroughly covered in it by the time they were done.
Steve rose an eyebrow at Rhodey, “You let him do this?” He asked incredulously, Rhodey shrugged,
******
“Not tonight or we won’t get him out of there before tomorrow morning.” Pepper said.
“Tony, what…” Bruce looked from the much larger and older Steve, to Lily, and then back to Tony.
The fall and the shouting had Lily screaming now in obvious fright, a horrible sound to hear. No infant should be crying like that, should know what fright was, but she did and it broke Rhodey’s heart to see her big eyes wide with fear, her cheeks red as tears spilled down them, and to feel the tremors running through her tiny body as she shook.
“So may but hopefully this will help.” Tony said, “Besides,” He nodded towards Harley, “He’s had so many friendship requests on Facebook already I think he’ll have his own army to protect him from here on out.”
“Why, thank you, Natasha, I shall take that as a compliment.” Tony asked as he finally joined them. He preened for Clint’s wolf whistle then stuck his finger up at the archer while he kissed Steve.
When he got back to New York his kids were going to kill him, Steve was going to kill him, huh, maybe he’d just tie him to the bed, that could be fun.
“How are you coping with being in a wheelchair?”
“Pep, can you tell me why I am subjecting myself and my lover to this humiliation?” Tony asked.
“Well, considering the state your in I think grounding you is redundant right now.” Tony said, “However things are going to change. We can’t keep your enhancement a secret now, everyone will know about you.”
Tony had a concussion from where his head had hit the inside of his suit and fractured his skull, and smoke inhalation that was made worse by his decreased lung capacity, but if a rest and time on oxygen he was expected to make a full recovery.
Things got a little more ridiculous when Tony decided to have her and Clint compete and set a range of targets for them to hit. The archery butt and the Dummy were understandable and expected. The Water melon, the paint bomb, and Thor with an apple on his head, not so much.
“But imagine beings just as powerful as Hulk and Abomination that could be controlled.” Curien said, “Imagine an entire platoon of Captain America’s all saluting Ross, imagine soldiers able to breathe under water, able to survive weeks without food and water, to cross the harshest of terrains without fatigue. Imagine soldiers able to secrete poison from their fingernails, imagine soldiers bred with all of your intellect and all of Captain America’s strength, so they cannot just outmatch enemies in strength but also out think them. Why would Iron Man and protective armours be needed if their skin was bullet proof? If radiation had no effect on them? What army could withstand them, what country could hold out against such a force?”
Steve kept the details of his and Tony’s relationship private, only saying how they were very happy, were taking things slowly, and would not be rushing into anything. He did however elaborate on how much he loved being a part of the Stark family, how much adored Zach and Peter and spending time with them.
“Go ahead,” Steve said passing Tony the sweat pants and rising up, politely averting his gaze while Tony changed out of his dress pants. Steve took them from him, putting them to one side and gestured for Tony to get into bed.
“Which is another word for loosing.” Peter said opening up a comic to read as he lay on his front.
“Not only could you not afford me, I have two kids to care for, they are my priority, not you or your super secret spy organisation.” He was on his way to the door when he paused and looked back over his shoulder, “I’ll consider flexible hours, to be decided on by myself when I have time and it won’t conflict with my parenting of Zach and Peter, or my work for SI. I’ll also wave my usual fee in exchange for one favour.”

Tony had meant for the Ultron program to be a last resort, clearly Jarvis had perceived it necessary to take that level of defence.
“I think you have more chance of convincing Miss Pots that building a Laser Quest in the Tower is a good idea, Sir.” Jarvis dryly replied, “But please do not allow me to dissuade you on your attempts.”
“Oh yeah, he’s got the puppy eyes and pout down to a fine art.” Tony groused, “Kids had a rough time too, his dickbrain dad left him, his Mother, and Sister. His Mother is having to leave them at night to go to work.”
Girls, they were so weird.
“Certainly Sir, and may I congratulate you on successfully wrangling two less than pleasant parental episodes today.”
Sadly the tree only remained upright for about half and hour; then Espresso and Gingerbread leaped into what they saw as their newest toy and soon had it over on the floor and were attacking the decorations and kicking the baubles around the floor.
“They are pains in my ass.” Tony said as he went and threw himself down on the sofa besides Steve. “And back to the Doctor, we can’t speak with him because he’s dead. He conveniently died in a car accident of his own a month after Howard and Maria’s deaths.”
There was a roaring in his ears, the rush of blood from his pounding heart was deafening him and the world was swirling around him making it impossible for him to focus on anything at all.
After the speeches had finished, came the dancing with music being provided by a full orchestra, and drinks available from a very well stocked bar.
“Not as much as I want to put on some clothes that fit.” Bruce said, he gave Steve an apologetic smile, “No offence, Captain, but you’re not my type.”
Steve chuckled and pulled Tony in for a hug, “I think it’s just one of the joys of being a parent.” He said, “Just wait until he gets his first girlfriend, or boyfriend and wants to stay out all night at a party!” Tony groaned and buried his face in Steve’s chest.
“Probably had the cops who investigated in their pocket too.” Rhodey mused.
Slowly Rhodey powered down his suit and sighed, “I don’t suppose they said where they’d be heading?”
Inside the base Strucker ordered a full evacuation of his scientists, ordering them to take everything they had and to get of Sokovia while he sent the soldiers to fight the Avengers, and to protect himself and his best scientists as they made their flight down into the city.
“Is he alright, Zach’s not worse is he?” Could chicken pox get worse? Steve didn’t think they could, but he supposed that might have changed in seventy years.
“Got it Bossman.” Friday replied.
Curien laughed sounding almost as if he were bordering on hysteria, “God, for someone so smart you are really fucking dumb aren’t you Stark?” His breath hitched as Steve’s powerful hand wrapped about the shin of his injured leg.
*****
“What’s this about pants?” Tony asked coming into the kitchen with Peter, “You got your homework and PE kit?” he asked Peter.
“It is.” Rhodey confirmed, “His spine is severed, he won’t walk again.”
“I think we’ve got something that can help with that.” Fury said a smirk curving his lips, “Something to hide our identities until it’s too late.”
“You should.” Tony said, “You’re young, you need to get out there and meet people your own age.” He rolled his eyes at the grin Steve gave him, “Your actual age, not the age your body is from your ice nap. You’re a hell of a catch, you’ll have Beta woman, and Omega’s fighting over you.”
Steve gulped as he realized that his morning glory was pressed flush against Tony’s buttocks and the erection became far more demanding.
“Correct Mr Stark, and while I helped their cause, I also helped my own.” Zola agreed, an image of the Hydra insignia appearing on one of the screens.
“Is that the baby?” Wanda asked a little too loudly and Natasha hushed her.
He harnessed the suit to himself with rope he found hanging from a sturdy tree branch, it had been holding up a tire, obviously having been some kids makeshift swing, but now it served as a way for Tony to take the suit with him since there was no way he could carry it’s weight.
It was the first time Tony had slept in a bed since Peter’s accident, or really slept at all, he’d been snatching naps as he and Steve had waited for Peter to wake up. Naturally, he was exhausted and had fallen asleep almost as soon as his head had hit the pillow and didn’t move until Jarvis was waking both him and Steve, turning the lights on to just twenty percent so they wouldn’t be overwhelmed.
So, he got himself showered, shaved, and brushed his teeth, and then went and got dressed.
“You and Pete are gonna go and finish packing up your rooms today.” Tony said, running his fingers through Zach’s hair, “If you finish early I’ll have Happy take you to the Met.”
“Fair enough, but you might get some backlash for it. I don’t know how things were in your world, but in this one, not all views are positive on LGBTQA.” Tony said, “And you practically accused your “Little brother” of being homophobic.”
“Yes Sir.”
“Slippery bastard.” Sam grunted.
Tony had just taken a mouthful of tea and nearly spat it out, “You mean the quinjets? They’re not exactly cheap to build, Shield’s funding comes from the W.S.C. Which was now know is likely infested with Hydra, when we route them out the entire council will likely fall and with it goes Shields funding.
Steve went and stood by Peter putting an arm about his shoulders as they waited for Maya Hansen before the lift. Soon enough the doors dinged open but before they even got a word out both he and Peter were hit by darts fired from some kind of plastic pistol, the kind that kids played with and fired suction cup bolts from, no doubt so it could get through the metal detectors.
“Well duh.” MJ sneered.
“Breathe Spidey,” Sam said, patting Peter’s shoulder, Tony grinned at Peter,
“Or you don’t deserve to have your life ruined by my injury.” Peter said giving Tony a knowing look. Little brat.
“Fine you’re a super genius blackmailer, happy?”
Sore nipples.
“And you’re talking about what?” Rhodey asked.
That was when Natalie showed up with Nick eyepatch super spy Fury.
Since escaping Hydra and getting this place they had tried to stay aware of the news that was going on in the world, always ready to run at the first sign of trouble. Well James was, Winter wanted to fight. He always wanted to fight.
“Shush!” Zach reprimanded them, “It’s starting!”
In his lab he cleared out and created a baby safe zone, complete with three feet high fencing, padded on the baby side so that when he or she started walking they wouldn’t get hurt. He had the floor padded too so it’d be soft under the feet, and had a soft ball pit put in, a baby bouncer, and all sorts of rattles and other toys for the baby to play with.
They wrapped up the interview with a few more questions and then Jarvis ended the connection.
“Just things,” Steve said, really trying to keep his relaxed posture, “In general.”
“We are looking into this, a full blood work is being done right now.”
Steve sighed heavily from where he was sat besides Tony in the lab on the dilapidated couch as Dumm-E, You, and Butterfingers dithered nearby, concerned with their creators wellbeing.
“Just gonna sleep as I am.” Tony said, he grabbed a side of the duvet and burrito wrapped himself up. “Was a really good night though Jarvis.” He added as he the lights dimmed.
“Tony has every right to be here, he is an avenger and he owns the property.” Natasha icily reprimanded the Witch who glowered at Tony.
“Language,” Natasha chided him, “There are delicate ears present.”
“These Elves were not like those depicted in your fantasy moving picture, Hawkeye.” Thor said gravely, “These were Dark Elves, beings of great malice and spite, intent only on destroying all in their path.”
“Well you shouldn’t go alone.” Rhodey said, getting back to his feet, thankful he hadn’t yet taken the war machine armour off. “I’ll go with you in case there is trouble.”
Peter smiled, “Thanks Mamma.” He said, “Thanks for…..well being you I guess. I don’t think anyone else could have handled so much crazy over the past few months.”
Steve was laughing between pants for air, "But if you surrender then negotiations may begin and mercy may be shown."
“Right.” The Doctor said, getting a syringe, “Lets get the placenta delivered and we can be on our way.” He ignored Tony’s sobbing and screams for his daughter, jabbing him with the syringe and set about delivering the placenta, once it was out the Doctor took Tony’s legs down from the stirrups getting a kick in the face for his trouble from the anguished mother.
I should be dead. Bucky thought to himself. I should have died a long time ago. He remembered the fall, the certainty that he would die then, had braced himself for the pain of the impact which had been brief as unconsciousness had taken him, and then… then there was cold, more pain, confusion, cold and dark, pain, always pain, not knowing who he was or what he was, having to rely on what the handler was saying and believe it was Gods own truth. Pain if he didn’t comply, death when he did. So much death, so many killed, why not me?
“Mamma can we…” Peter began,
Besides, if tonight’s visit to Osborn’s factory paid off then he could hand over the information he’d gathered and come clean to his parents while also proving he was capable of being a superhero.
“Yeah, I’ll just…” Steve gestured to the bathroom and Tony nodded continuing on his way down the hall.
“This is going to be a Code Green I’m afraid.” Steve said apologetically to Bruce.
Tony snuggled into Steve’s broad chest, “You do Cap.” He said, kissing Steve’s jaw, then a brainwave hit him, “We can set you up with your own social media accounts.”
“Where are you staying?” Tony asked, having a sneaking suspicion that Natasha already knew about the floors that were available for the Avengers.
“Not yet.” Tony said, “Rhodey’s on a mission as far as I know, I don’t want to pull him away from that if we can help it, and I’d rather have the Hulk guarding my boys, I don’t fancy anyone’s chances of getting near them with Big Green watching out for them, as for Clint… Jay, it might be an idea to give Barton a heads up, let him know what’s happened so he can lay low. Hell, he might even have an idea of where Natasha has gone.”
How is everyone coping with the Virus Pandemic. It's been crazy where I am, panic buying and such, and so far Boris Johnson has done pretty much Jack Shit in regards to preparing this country or giving us real information, all we've been getting for the most part in contradictory information from the press.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline, “Beguiled you?” he repeated, a grin briefly passing over his lips before he became serious again, “Why didn’t you say anything?”
“I will be.” Pepper said, “And so will you. I don’t know if Steve and boys have told you, but we are already making the necessary modifications to the tower and your lab, we will have everything ready for when you are released from the hospital.”
Tony rolled his eyes, “I’m on fertility treatment!” He hissed at her.
Steve paused in rubbing Tony’s shoulders, “He can’t.” He said, “He has no grounds.”
Natasha and Clint had been into the hospital to speak with him since Norman’s disappearance, posing as Doctor’s to get past the police guard on the door. They both believed him to be telling the truth, and sadly, while he could give chapter and verse on Norman’s wrong doing, he couldn’t prove involvement with Stern or Ross.
“And you are a brat who is grounded, and I’ll make the grounding literal if you don’t come down right now.”
Tony did as instructed, copying Steve until he felt a little calmer. “But what should I do?” he asked, “I can’t ignore this, can I?”
“So it would seem.”
“Sir was sick in the night.” Jarvis said, “He vomited over himself, the bed, and the floor, which was most embarrassing for him as you might imagine.”
He wasn’t.
“And why me and Zach aren’t allowed outside or on the internet.” Peter said, guessing that there would be a lot of posts on social media asking where Tony was and speculating if he was dead, not something he or Zach should read.
“You’re threatening babies now?” Tony sneered in disgust, “Can you possibly sink any lower?”
This didn’t stop Tony from feeling guilty, or Bruce it seemed, since he’d disappeared. Though Tony suspected part of that was because of Steve’s “Brilliant” idea of adding Wanda to the team.
“But you’re Spiderman.” Lydia gushed, “We’ve seen you on the internet, you totally have to wear your costume to the party.”
He didn’t resist the hug she gave him and let her keep her arm around his shoulders as she led him to the car where Zach was already strapped in sniffing and hiccupping with sobs.
Tony jerked slightly and frowned at the Doctor, “There is no chance that you will ever walk again.”
Tony’s eyes were alight now and as he spoke he gestured with almost frenzied energy, “He wants flowers and parades, monuments to the sky with his name on them….Son of a bitch!”
“I’m not now.” Maya whispered.
“Fank you, Mamma.” Zach chirruped, scrambling after the kittens as they bounded off the sofa to continue going about their business of attacking everything they encountered which just so happened to be Steve as he joined them from his own floor after settling back in.
“I thought it was.” Steve said, slowly lifting his head, “I thought we were okay, that were trusted each-other, didn’t hide things, especially important things.” To Tony’s horror he lay the box of syringe’s on the coffee table.
Don’t make that mistake.
“In the future though?”
Steve shrugged, “I guess I was thinking I’d wear my uniform.”
To Tony’s dismay it was not Steve with a plateful of something delicious that awoke him the following morning but the agitated screaming of Zach which had him half strangling himself in an effort to get out of his sleeping bag and then fell twice in his mad scramble to get out of the tent.
“So I should talk to your Mamma about it then.” Steve said.
Natasha inclined her head in agreement and Thor cheerfully agreed, eager to swim again.
The day before it had been science, learning elements from the periodic table, both the letters that represented them and what the elements were used for, where they were found, and what type of element they were.
Raising one hand Tony fired a gauntlet above their heads hitting the ceiling sending plaster and sparks raining down on them. “The next one makes contact with your skulls.” He growled, “Where is my Son?”
With the suit down, Jarvis out of commission, and his mobile completely trashed thanks to it being bathed in the ocean, Tony was in the middle of no where, freezing his ass off, and seriously reconsidering several life choices, like making threats to terrorists on national TV.
Sam had gotten him a gift box filled to the brim with chocolate and candy, which had Tony groaning since it meant Zach would be sugar hyped before very long.

After two years of dating Steve proposed to Tony and the Billionaire accepted. They were still planning their wedding when Bruce returned to Earth with news of Thanos, via Stephen Strange, Sorcerer Supreme.
“That is, something incredible.” Tony replied shutting the file down, he’d look it all up when they boys had gone to bed, right now he had Pizza, cider and a movie to enjoy.
It wasn’t the first time Ned and MJ had been to the tower, they had been over many times in the past, but never to stop over night and were more than impressed by the guest suits they were given. In an ordinary household a sleep over meant sleeping on an air mattress on the floor, or sharing the bed, or maybe going top and tail. But in Avenger’s tower, Ned and Peter got their own room and bathrooms.
That was the red rag to the bull, Rogers leaped forward, throwing his shield at Tony, who was unceremoniously shoved out of the way by Steve, who the shield in one hand and brought it back around in time to smash across Roger’s face, knocking the smaller version to the ground.
“This car park space can be expanded on and turned into a full garage for Avengers vehicles. And right down there we can put in a landing pad, it’s away from the trees so that won’t be an issue and our jets don’t need a runway for take off or landing.”
“Going to start throwing your wealth in our faces Stark?” Natasha sneered at him, “Your ego really knows no limits does it?”
Tony was relieved by that, he wasn’t ready for a litter, wasn’t sure he’d ever be ready, and quickly swallowed the first pill.
“Why?” Steve asked bemused,
“Boss, Deadpool and Dopinder have departed. Dopinder in the lift, and Deadpool down the side of the building!” Friday reported, Tony rolled his eyes, only half hoping that Wade would splatter himself on the pavement, not that it’d kill him, or injure him for very long, but at least it would hurt. Although, he could land on someone and kill them…
“This is not your business. Why don’t you go back to your world, huh?” A twisted sort of humour stretched over Roger’s face, “You say that your world was destroyed, well how do we know that is the truth? We only have your word for it. Maybe you’re on the run, maybe you kidnapped that baby from her real parents and sang your sob story at Stark to get his sympathy, or, maybe he’s in on it” Roger’s looked to Tony, sneering at him, “What’s in it for you Stark? Was the fact I saw through you bullshit too much take so you had to go and find yourself a lesser version of me to make your boy toy?”
“Am I gonna have a little brover or sista?” Zach asked, resting his chin on Tony’s stomach while looking up at Tony with huge eyes.
“Boss Man, the deliveries are here,” Friday chirped,
“Can we ever have a normal breakfast?” Bruce asked plaintively.
Both Tony and Steve were easy-going as parents, letting Peter and Zach get away with a lot more than some parents would, they were both allowed to stay up late so long as it wasn’t a school night, were rarely refused activities, new toys, or games. They both had their own computers and all the latest apps and phones. They were dressed in high end fashion, had the latest trends in trainers, jeans, and other clothing, they didn’t really have chores to do beyond keeping their own bedrooms tidy and their grades up in school, and their allowances were eye-watering.
“I don’t think so.” Peter looked away, unable to bear seeing anymore of these poor creatures, “I’m gonna try and collect some data.” He said heading for the nearest computer terminal. The computers were all in screen saver mode and required a password to get into the systems, Peter however was prepared, or rather MJ was prepared. She’d already got remote access to Peter’s phone and using his charging cable he hooked the phone up to the nearest HDMI and let her start working her magic.
“How do you do that?” He asked.
Matt, Sam, and Peter all gave Clint looks of varying sympathy at this and his own experience with being mind raped. Bucky grunted, looking up from the floor, which he was pacing like a caged tiger.
Pushing open the door Tony went into the bedroom and found Zach on his bed his face buried in his pillows his little body trembling as he cried into them.
“Yes.” Tony groaned, “And if you can find a formula we’ll test it in the lab.” He actually squeaked as Peter hugged him tighter and then staggered as he was kissed on the cheek and Peter bolted off to go and start his research.
“What? No, I’m fine, why would you ask that?” Tony asked,
“I do not believe it is sleep which is on his mind, Sir.” Jarvis said, “Not with the numerous candles that have been lit and the copious amounts of melted chocolate and sliced strawberries that are present.”
Unsurprisingly the bullet did a lot of damage, rupturing my spleen, my gallbladder, and my stomach, it also did some damage that current medical technology cannot repair.
“Shit really, does it fly?” Ned asked.
More noise followed and then the boy spoke into the phone again, “He’s breathing into the bag, looks kind of like he’s puking into it from this angle, hey! He just flipped me off! You can’t flip me off I’m a kid!” despite the situation Steve couldn’t help but to grin at the boys commentary, no wonder he and Tony had hit it off.
Sam grinned, “My lips are sealed. I just wanted to see how you were both doing and let you know I’m heading out on my morning jog, if you want I can pick up some bagels and toppings on the way back.”
“And so are you.” Tony said, “Most people who’ve been through what you have would be gibbering idiots in a corner. You’ve made the effort to adapt and learned to live in this century. You have nothing to reproach yourself for, so please don’t do that to yourself.”
*****
“Fucking assholes have put me in a wedding dress in this one. A meringue like wedding dress!”
“Okay!” Zach scrambled down and hurried off to do so as fast as his little legs could carry him.
Tony shook his head, he wasn’t having it, “Nnnooo,” He stammered, his wild eyes searching the room, “They come out of nowhere. Just appear and then there’s nothing. Just ashes, ashes everywhere, so much ash, I can’t breathe!” He began to paw and claw at his chest and throat, his nails digging into his skin as he hyperventilated, “Can’t breathe, can’t breathe!” he panted, launching himself off the bed and collapsing on the floor.
The hole was right into Tony’s body, it was small probably only a fingers width but deep, so deep. He already knew it went all the way through and that there would be a wound ten times as large on the other side where the bullet had come out.
“Cuz you like him an he likes you. Peter said so, says you flit, no flet, flip, you flip with him like Cap’n Jack Harkness does.”
“You can’t do this Tony!” Steve shouted, staggering to his feet, clutching his profusely bleeding nose. “They’ll kill Bucky, he’s innocent!”
“No problem, I’m kind of psyched to be helping out Captain America and Iron Man,” He paused, “Although, what exactly am I helped you guys with, its not another invasion of those reptile looking things is it?”
“We’ll go fishing tomorrow.” Steve agreed, securing Zach’s arms around his neck to ensure that he wouldn’t fall now he’d fallen asleep.
“Really?” Steve scoffed his hands going to his hips, a sarcastic sneer on his face that didn’t belong there, Steve should never look like that, it didn’t suit him.
“Smart boy.” Tony observed managing a wry smile. He coughed and winced, his throat felt raw and his whole body was aching, and in spite of the heat he felt chilled.
“And what of your W.S.C.?” Tony asked. He watched as Natasha and Fury exchanged an uncomfortable look between them, “You don’t know.” He said and pinched the bridge of his nose, “Project Insight can’t go ahead, Nick. Not with Hydra in the works. Not without full public support.”
At least he got to test the bracelets that called the armour to him, that was something and it saved him from becoming an ugly splatter on the pavement that some poor bastard would have had to scrape up.
After a few minutes of cuddles, apologies, and assurances, Tony managed to get Zach on his hip and Peter at his side, leading the way to the family room with the team following, where Happy was waiting apparently on the phone with both Rhodey and Pepper, who both yelled at Tony for scaring them half to death and told (Threatened) him that they were on their way over.
“Killian.” Tony said, “He created you didn’t he?” The recovering Jarvis and
“I don’t know.” Peter said, “Do you want to call him Daddy?”
“We have a date with the Black Widow.” Steve corrected, “And hopefully we can start to solve this nightmare.”
“Make me happy.” Steve said nodding his head a bitter smile now twisting his lips, “No matter what it takes, even if it means hurting yourself.”
“Understood, Sir.” Hill said, “And if the WSC does send out a team of their own?”
“Under duress,” Steve stressed, reaching over the counter and taking Tony’s hands into his own and held them tight, “You are no more responsible for this than Clint is for his actions when Loki was controlling him.”
As much as Tony doubted that there was anything in the research that could help, Tony went through the boxes, watching an old reel of Howard, with a recording from him at the end giving him a riddle to solve.
Once he was scrubbed clean he threw on a pair of sweats and a hoodie and went back to his Sons room, Peter had come home from school and was entertaining Zach for the time being, giving Tony a chance to talk to Steve who was still cleaning up the bathroom, he’d scraped up all the oats by now, and was just rinsing down the tiles and mopping the floor.
“Perfect.” Pepper said making Steve turn in front of her, “Now shoes, I think boots would be best, they fit better with jeans than shoes do, and you are not wearing trainers even though Tony lives in them.” Steve grinned at her put upon tone, if he could get away with it Tony would wear nothing but his trainers, having even managed to wear a pair with his tux to a gala one time, much to Pepper’s chagrin.
“Oh fuck no.” Tony said, “Feather head is not allowed near my casts.” He said to Steve, “You have to protect the sanctity of my casts, it is Captain America’s duty to protect them and my dignity!”
Peter’s head shot up, “How?”
Steve looked surprised at the difference there and smiled, “Anthony Edward Stark, that I am in love with you for who you are, just as I was for who Anthony Gregory Stark was, and while I will always miss him and mourn his loss, I would not trade you for him nor wish that it was he in your place.”
“I’m driving.” She replied, running and jumping into the driving seat.
“Sorry about Zach catching you off guard like that.” He apologised, “He came and landed on me at dawn wanting to know if he could call you Daddy.”
What Peter was presented with was a garishly coloured multilegged spider with his head on top that Zach proudly declared was Spideyman!
“I’m ready,” Steve said, “I appreciate the offer, but I am ready.”
Peter had yet to awaken from the tranq dart and the EMT’s decided to take him to hospital and have him admitted just to be on the safe side.
The Consultant gave the cop a stern look, “This is hardly the time….” He began but the cop wasn’t finished,
“So, I thought we should probably go and speak to the Avengers, before letting the world know about you and Lily,” Tony said to him, going to pour himself a fourth cup of coffee, “I’ll do a press conference and handle letting the public know as soon as the Avengers are in the picture,” he paused, turning and gave Steve an uncertain look, “So long as you’re alright with that?”
“I could do that I guess.” Zach said sitting up, “And We’ll talk every day?” He asked Tony,
“Asshole.” MJ spat.
Peter suffered a gun shot to his thigh, deep lacerations to his torso, severed ribs which were cut through, extreme blood loss and smoke inhalation. He is now in hospital and is also expected to make a full recovery thanks to his enhanced healing.”
“In the Caribbean Sea. Not far from the Caymans.” Tony replied, “The villa isn’t that big, you’ll have to share rooms, but there’s gorgeous beaches, crystal clear sea, and some good hiking across the cliffs.”
“You’ll only act when commanded to.” Pierce told him sharply, “And before you forget, you and your task force are baseline, Rogers is a super soldier and Stark has that suit of his. It will take more than just your usual brawn to deal with them.”
“No.” Tony said, “The rehab will learning to adapt to using a wheelchair, a disabled toilet and other essentials. There is no chance of recovery from this injury.”
He'd had a heat after returning from Afghanistan, had spent it with Obie and taken his pills as always, only this time they had failed, as was a risk, only being 97 percent effective.
“Dark hair tends to be dominant though doesn’t it?” Steve said, “And brown eyes are more common than blue.”
“Okay then, cool, I think it’ll be cool.” Peter said. Nappies aside Zach had been a very cute baby, Peter could only imagine that a Pup by Tony and Steve would be just as adorable.
“Love the new look Stark, it’s very becoming.”
Natasha had said that Tony was compulsive and self-destructive as well as being prone to narcissism, and if flattered and appealed to, could be easily manipulated.
“Pretty good, its been what….five seconds since I left so you know, I’ll wait and see how I feel in another fifteen before I give a definite answer!”
“That ain’t never happenin’” came a drawl from the side. Both mean turned to look and Wade shrieked,
“Damnit,” Norman grumbled, reaching up to turn on the lights, revealing the silenced gun he was holding, “Now then…”
“Already?” Tony asked sitting down on the bed beside Peter and gently swatted his head when the boy protested and moaned loudly and dramatically, “Share the bed or I’ll sit on your Father’s lap.” Tony threatened him and leaned close, “And we’ll talk about the first thing that comes up!”
“Wanna sleep here, you’re warm. Night Petey, love you.” Zach said and with the ability of children he was fast asleep in a few moments of closing his eyes.
New York.
“Sir?” The receptionist or secretary or whoever she was asked,
“Zach is fine, and you will get through this.” Tony said, “When I first got back from Afghanistan it was struggle for me to even shower, and it was months before I could sit in a shallow bath. Now I can do both, so I hope that maybe one day I’ll be able to have a deep bath again, go swimming with Zach and Peter. Stop fearing water.”
His friend and business partner Obie was perfect in his opinion as the man was practically family and would put the needs of Stark Industries before anything else. So he drew up the betrothal, arranging for Tony to be married to Obadiah when he was eighteen.
“He doesn’t need a shrink!” Tony shouted making Peter whine, “I’m sorry baby.” He soothed in a softer tone, he go down on his knees before Peter and pulled the boy against his chest, adding his own hands over Peter’s, “Try and concentrate on my voice only.” Tony whispered, “Don’t hear anything else, don’t think about anything else, just my voice.”
“With one hand?” Curien snapped, “We both know that is impossible. Do not insult me, I am not a layman, I am a Doctor.”
******
“It would have gone better than our first meeting, me drop kicking a psycho trickster and you me snarking at each other before getting into a bitch fight with Thor.”
Steve thought it made him look adorable, wearing too big clothes and his hair all floofy since he didn’t have any products to use on it.
“Alright munchkin let’s get home.” Tony said to Peter,
After an hour or so mingling everyone went and took their seats at their designated tables, the Avengers thankfully had one together on their own so they could relax through the meal.
As they had shared countless time before, Natasha and Clint took the second bedroom without batting an eyelid, leaving Thor, Bruce, and Sam in the third room.
*****
Peter was silently crying as he stepped up to the bed, Zach was sobbing into Steve’s chest as he carried him to where Tony lay, broken and hurting and looking more fragile than Steve could ever recall seeing.
“Jay, if you take over the world will you be kind to me?” Tony asked using damp fingers brush back his hair.
“How about those who fired it, the WSC?” Bruce asked.
The trauma team moved swiftly getting the gurney moving to the door and into the hospital, as they moved down the corridor the consultant ordered immediate scans to be taken, bloods, and the theatre to be prepped.
A thump of the window that sounded like a fist against the glass made Steve jolt and frown. No one could hit the glass, they were sixty stories high! The noise came again, and he turned, his eyes widening and then a deep and exasperated sigh leaving him.
Norman scoffed and looked at the Principal and school board in disbelief. “You cannot be serious.”
With Peter still in the hospital, Steve and Tony were only coming back to the tower to shower, shave, and change their clothes, then they went straight back to Peter’s bedside where the boy was making rapid progress in his healing with no signs of infection.
Setting off at his maximum speed Steve tore through the woods, shoving past the remaining shoulders and throwing them out of his way. He leaped up the outer wall of the base, getting a fingerhold and a toe hold between the stones and climbed like a cat up the wall, pulling himself up into a handstand and flipped over at the top. He tossed his at the soldiers who fired at him, knocking them down like bowling ball pins, catching the shield he continued on his run, round to the course way, knocking aside more soldiers, dodging a few more bullets until he reached the entrance to the base.
The others had been watching this interaction with morbid fascination up until this point and since Bucky looked like he was either going to beat Wade to death or have a nervous breakdown, they decided to intervene before things could become anymore inappropriate.
Once his arm was all but free Steve allowed himself to smile, an expression that became a groan as Tony suddenly moved, plastering himself all over Steve’s front, clinging like a koala bear.
“What?”
Pepper’s expression went from anger on Steve’s behalf, to disappointment, to concern in a few seconds, “Tony, you can’t go through this alone. This is huge, you need support.”
Sam shrugged, “So was the Exo project and I don’t regret signing up for that.” He dug into the half baked, getting both cookie dough and fudge brownie on his spoon, “If I can get the wings I can even help you take down Hydra, or at least this… cell? Is that the right term?” His nose scrunched up as he frowned, “They call terrorist groups cells, so I guess it fits.”
“They kill anyone, including themselves, you’re cleaning up the mess.” Tony deadpanned and stalked away before Deadpool could drag him back again.
“Zachs…. Zachs… Kidnapped….” Tony’s voice sounded faint and Steve could hear the far too rapid intake of breaths down the phone.
“Talked to Petey last night and he said I should talk to you.”
Shutting his eyes tight Peter buried his head under the pillows and tried to shut out the noise, tried to block out the beeping machines, the rise and fall of respirators, the hum of electronics, the scrape of feet on tiles, the opening and shutting of doors.
Things got more exciting when Tony joined him on the range with a new batch of test arrows he wanted Clint to use and the pair then spent two hours blowing things up and setting them on fire, electrocuting them, and smothering them in a kind of foam that Tony was still working on to be used for fire suppression.
“It has to be you,” Reed said, “I have to man the controls, Pepper doesn’t want to go, not without Happy, and he’s too injured to leave the bed. Someone has to survive, after all, you have Lily to think about,” Steve looked down at the seven month old in his arms, the little girl was sleeping contentedly, completely unaware of what was happening around her. Steve envied her that, wished he could be so innocent.
“And you thought that sending him into the hornets nest was a good idea?” Her Father scoffed, “Look at what has happened Mary Jane, both he and Mr Stark are in hospital, people are dead and others severely injured because of your actions.”
“It does also explain why the Sceptre was replaced after the fight.” Thor mused, “My Brother would not have relinquished it so easily.”
“You should get some rest, Jarvis doesn’t need rest, he can monitor me easily enough.”
“Sounds like a plan,” Steve said, then looked to Lily who was happily babbling to Dumm-E who was chirping back at her, “We’ll need a baby sitter though.”
“No, he and Flash are in different classes to me now and they aren’t allowed to approach me at breaks either.” Peter said.
“Try the balcony, Pete.” Sam called to him.
He had also learned that nothing was sacred to children, not even their parents bed, which had led to several embarrassing moments when he and Tony had been walked in on.
If he hadn’t been so angry at that moment then Steve might have softened, might have seen the insecurity that was eating away at Tony and sort to assure and comfort him. But he was too angry, too hurt to hear anything but an accusation of infidelity in what Tony was saying about a younger healthier Omega.
Immediately he began to panic, coughing and trying to spit the thing out of his throat but he was held down, the doctor and other people holding him telling him to relax, then slowly the thing, the tube was removed and Tony could cough and clear his aching throat.
Swiftly Tony put his code and gave targeting control to Rhodey and Vision were at the compound,
“They couldn’t deal with his crazy.”
Natasha’s eyes flashed, “I like a challenge, especially one with the potential to bite back.” Tony snapped his teeth at her and Fury cleared his throat,
Steve let out a deep sigh and looked heavenward, “Why can’t you talk to me about these things instead of trying go about them on your own?” he asked, whether or not he was asking God or Tony wasn’t entirely clear and Tony shrugged, looking down at his hands.
Steve held the wheelchair steady while Tony slide into the car and got comfortable, then Steve folded the chair and put it into the trunk, going around to the otherside of the car and climbed in, shutting the door on the noise of snapping cameras and news reporters talking into microphones.
While the Avengers might like to go and take their law into their own hands and deal with the pair themselves, they could not do so, not if they wanted to keep on operating freely. This had to be done within the confines of the law, and that meant no physical action being taken against the pair until they had absolute proof of their guilt and their being a danger to human lives.
“What?” Tony cried, “How, why?” Rhodey sighed,
Zach let out a bellow of rage, fire blazing up his arms and heat radiating off him fierce enough to scorch the flesh from several feet away.
“I’d like to see the rest of the island actually.” Steve said, “I wouldn’t mind hiking around to take a look everywhere.”
“I’m thinking that you will die after eating all that.” Sam said looking faintly disgusted at the mountain of food.
He initiated his own download from the servers into an armour that Tony had designed specifically for him. An armour named Vision.
Steve’s nose wrinkled, “No, I’m not really a fan of the whole junior thing, I’d rather he had his own name.”
Zach’s eyes sparked with excitement and he scurried off to bed, snuggling down under the covers and propped his book up on his lap to look at the colourful pictures and read the large printed words, saying them aloud with Jarvis’ help.
“It is!” Peter cried, wincing since it made his chest ache, “I should have done what you said, if I had then I would never have been in oscorp and none of this would have happened.”
“That’d be nice.” Tony said sounding wistful, “Especially since I’ve been neglecting the boys.”
“Why do you need to go in there?” She asked,
Tony slumped, resting his elbows on the desk and looked desperately at Pepper’s concerned face.
“How is he?” Rhodey called out, not taking his eyes off Maximoff.
“If you haven’t already,” Wanda muttered,
“Will you go really fast and make car noises?”
“If we agree,” The Spanish Representative asked, “How soon can these weapons be developed?”
“Hmm, should have known you’d be the type to go on top Stark.” Natasha mused, “Not the type to get pinned down.”
“Yeah, I withdraw my question.” Bruce said and rubbed his temples.
Sam nodded accepting the information.
“Been better J, but I’ve still got all my limbs.” Tony replied, “Are the others alright too?”
“Seriously.” Steve said.
******
“No.” Tony whined bending double and choking on the thick red mist that filled the air.
“We are a little busy here, in case you haven’t noticed,” Steve said, sarcastically, and Rogers glared at him.
“No but I think my Jambalaya will.” Bruce said.
“Why, are you leaving?”
“I forgot how much I enjoyed swimming.” Tony said turning over and treading water, he was still feeling a little anxious but in control, he knew he was alright and could easily get back to shore, he wasn’t going to drown.
The images of Tony and Steve dancing had raised the question of their relationship.
“Yes Sir, just about.” Jarvis replied, his voice distorted and crackling with static, “What has happened, I lost your signal a few hours ago.”
Ivan Vanko wasn’t dead, he was working with Justin no brains Hammer and attacked the Expo. Leaving Zach with Happy, Tony managed to destroy the drones with Rhodey’s help, and Natasha attacked Hammer Industries breaking Vanko’s hold on the War Machine armour since the US Airforce had the idiot idea of letting Hammer near the armour.
“Sure.” Peter said giggling as Zach answered with an excited “Ja!”
“I..” Steve looked to Tony who was being lain on another stretcher,
“Is everything a joke to you?” Steve spat at the recalcitrant Omega whose abrasive attitude was getting on his last nerve.
He headed down the marble stairs, admiring the art work adorning the walls, noting that there were no pictures of Tony, although there were several of Howard, including an oil painting. There were a couple of a woman that Steve assumed was Tony’s Mother, she was much younger than Howard and had a glazed kind of look about her in the photos.
It wasn’t a guarantee, his Omega-ologist had been very clear about that, but it would give him more of a chance than trying to get pregnant without the hormones would. This was increasing his ovulation, would make his ovaries work better.
“How did the fight start?” Steve asked curious and bewildered.
“He’s disappeared.” Natasha said gritting her teeth, “Little bastard. A plant.”
Clint came up for air and then went back under, followed by Natasha surfacing again.
“But how?” Rumlow asked, “He’s had contact with no one but Shield personnel and random idiots in the streets, most of whom he avoided like the plague. He’s been under constant surveillance since he woke up, any and all communication monitored, there is no way he could have gained that knowledge.”
“Can I help?” Steve asked seeing the way Tony’s hands were shaking with stress and the tension in the lines by his eyes. Before Tony could even reply Steve was moving, “I’ll get the bathroom cleaned up for you,” He said, “You get Zach off to bed and then go and sort yourself out, I’ll take care of this.”
“Need to speak to you mamma, is super impotant!”
Sharon took them outside of the City, to an underground bunker where non other than Nick Fury was hiding out with Maria Hill.
“That’s enough.” Tony said, “I’ll let you get back to whatever you are doing.”
“We’ll have to do some digging into Oscorp.” MJ said, “I’ll get back on the Dark Web and see if I can get back into the files, if not Oscorp then into Osborn’s personal files.”
Using the wheelchair made his arms ache and his shoulder burn as he pushed himself up and down the hospital gymnasium, he had also taken to wearing weightlifting gloves to protect his hands since they were getting torn up from the wheels.
Tony frowned, was this how they were going to do make ups? With gifts? Huh, he’d rather they had sex really….
“Fine!” Tony said with a dramatic show of throwing up his hands, “Fine, when we are attacked in the night by demented, body part wearing, psycho with a hook for a hand, don’t come crying to me when I can’t save you because my back is too stiff.”
“We’ve chosen a cake.” Steve offered, “Though how a cake can cost so much is beyond me.”
Tony grimaced, “They probably made sure any investigation was short lived too. As I recall, Aunt Peggy suffered her first stroke just two or three weeks after their deaths, and while it could have certainly been natural causes, she did have high blood pressure and wasn’t young, it could also have been because of some bastard tampering with her blood pressure meds, switching them out for something that would raise her BP and cause a stroke.” He shrugged, “They wouldn’t have cared if it had been fatal or not, just as long as it got her out of the way, which it did. She had to retire, it took her eighteen months to regain the use of her left leg and arm.”
Jambalaya.
“Your bitch fake Mom is fucking my life up.” Harry snarled at Peter, “My Dad’s having deal with tons of shit because you fucked up on the field trip.”
Steve had thought that he’d experienced excitement from fans back in his stage days, but this was unlike anything he’d faced before; crowds of people screaming in his face, shoving cameras, phones, and microphones at him, demanding comments, answers, even daring to ask intimate questions about his and Tony’s sex life.
“Its fine.” Tony said, not willing to let the mood be ruined, “You’re just gonna have to do more work is all.” He patted his lap, “Come on big guy, lets get this horse saddled and ready to ride!”
“I like that.”
*****
Kovarian huffed and put back his shoulders, “Get out of my way, creature, or the infant dies.”
This served to shut Tony up for the moment, but that moment was brief as Alexander Pierce was named.
“Useless slut.” Rhodey sneered,
“Oh Stark, we both know that if I wanted to find out I could more than easily.”
“Yes.” Tony agreed, “But it will be targeted only enemy ships, hopefully that will never land on earth, but if they do, then… well the best I can offer is to keep the damage to a minimum, to try and draw the ships away from civilian populations before the weapons are fired. But, make no mistake, such an event would mean that we were at war and a sad fact of war is that people die. Civilians as well as soldiers, we can try to keep the deaths to a minimum, but some lives may well be lost.”
But Peter was not stupid enough to think this luck would last indefinitely, as he gained more notoriety the greater the chance Tony and Steve would put two and two together and he would be found out.
“I will end you, Feather Head!”
“Very well.” Jarvis said. “Surplus Kevlar in the storage bin in the right corner.” He lit up ceiling lights to direct Peter to the bin.
Tony flinched back as Wanda’s hand brushed against his cheek, her fingers pressing on his temples, he wanted to scream, he wanted to beg her to stop, but he couldn’t do anything as she violated his mind, filling it with every fear he had lurking in his subconscious, making him see, hear, and feel every nightmare that plagued him as if he were actually living it out.
“Still not fair.” Zach said turning over and scowling at Tony. His face was red and snot and tears were on his upper lip and cheeks from where he’d been crying. “Why can’t I be with him, why does he have to be grounded, he said he was sorry.”
“Jarvis, how much land do I own here?”
“Is that what this is?” Steve asked looking at the machines which were humming low.
“He is recovering.” The Doctor said a frown on his face, “He has suffered many injuries, he should not have survived, the rupture in his aorta along should have taken his life…”
“Heads up Point break!” Tony called, hovering in the air,
“But not you?” Rhodey asked, not quite ready to give Sam the benefit of the doubt just yet, Sam shook his head.
“You should have had him shot and thrown into the incinerator, not waited around for his fucking Mother to show up in that God forsaken armour of his, with his merry band of freaks right behind him!” Norman sounded on the verge of hysteria, his voice was shrill and Curien could make out the shaking of his body in the shadows of the car.
Tony screamed and screamed until his voice broke and he couldn’t make another sound. By which time silent sobs were shaking his body and he was blinded by the tears that were raining down his cheeks. He felt Steve wrapping him in a warm embrace and couldn’t resist burying himself into Steve’s broad chest and clinging to him like a life line.
“I can see fine future for you as a cordon bluer chef.” Tony drawled sarcastically.
“I know.” Fury said, surprising Tony. “That’s why I’m bringing you in. I’ve got too many eyes on me to do anything without being stopped. You however are only a consultant to Shield, a freelance consultant who is blasé about following any orders. If you were to come across confidential information while helping us do a computer update and were to leak said information… well…”
That would be the right thing to do and Peter knew it, he really did. But he couldn’t resist the urge of stepping out on his own and proving his worth to the Avengers, proving he wasn’t just a kid anymore.
The pure terror of what that would mean would have Tony running to Zach and Peter’s rooms, desperate to check on them and be sure that they were safe. Only after he’d kissed their cheeks, stroked their hair, listened to them breathe for several minutes could he find it in himself to leave them to sleep.
“No problem.” Steve said. He looked to Matt, “So, what happens now?”
“Mamma and Daddy are smooching again!” Zach yelled loud enough for the whole villa to hear him.
“No, no no no, not now, please, just hold on!” Real fear was filling Tony now, he’d been scared before but now he was terrified, he was going into labour in a Hydra base surrounded by enemies and was completely alone.
These People would cluck their tongues at Peter, look at him with pity or scorn depending on their view towards children’s welfare.
“I didn’t lose,” Steve protested, “All this media crap will pass. It’s a faze that they’ll get over soon enough,” Sam scoffed and rolled his eyes,
Jarvis remained worryingly silent.
“Not doing that, knob head!” MJ yelled knocking the phone from Flash’s hand, she looked worriedly to Ned, unsure of what to do as neither of them had ever seen Peter like this before.
“Well its total shit that you are being kept out.” MJ said, “I’ve started a petition which I will send to the school board.”
Because he could.
“I guess I could do a video link from here.” He said, “Give them the details they want, that way they will be pacified and they will know that I’m not at deaths door or brain damaged.”
“We want to see him, now.”
Spotting a cannon where three Hydra soldiers which three Hydra soldiers were loading up and preparing to take aim on Sam, Tony fired down on them, blowing it up. “Thor we’ve got cannons and long range missile defences to take out, they will be on the banks around the castle perimeter can you handle that?”
“Brat, you’re grounded.” Tony grinned as Peter blew a raspberry at his retreating back. Obviously his Son was feeling better, having gotten the worst of his distress out, there would probably be more to come, but they’d made a start on this and Peter knew that he could talk to Tony about it without fear of getting in trouble.
“The only one that’s less is you Rogers.” Tony snarled back at him, “Steve is ten times the man you could ever hope to be,” He looked Rogers up and down, his eyes lingering over Roger’s crotch, “And as for fancying you, get fucking real. I wouldn’t touch you with a nine foot pole. You’re too small for my tastes!”
His back and his abdomen felt like they were on fire, he could feel a wetness spreading under him a horrid ache was wrapped about his middle squeezing him tight, every breath he desperately sucked in was painful, it was like he read breathing glass it hurt so much and his back was agony. Pain was shooting through his spine all the way from his neck right down to his middle, then a strange cold numbness seemed to have taken over, like his lower half was submerged in ice water. He was numb with cold and in pain at the same time.
It took a little while for them to make their way down the cliff and by the time they reached the bottom just foot or so above the sea, Clint and Thor had come out and were relaxing on the rocks.
“Understandable.” Steve said. There was no guarantee that Peter would be welcomed by his classmates, some may fear or resent him, he might become a target for bullies, or be ostracized. It was not something either Tony or Steve wanted for him and they hoped it wouldn’t happen, but they also wanted Peter to at least have a chance of returning to as much of a normal life as possible.
“Mamma!” Zach cried struggling in Thor’s grasp as the God prevented him from running over to Tony.
“And brown sugar.” Zach said.
“And while you are studying we’ll also bring down Hydra, find your BFF, and develop a planetary defence that will be acceptable to the UN.” Tony pursed his lips, “We are definitely going to need for tea and biscuits for this!”
“No, but you’ll pout if I don’t, so sure!”
“Not especially.” Bruce said, “I wouldn’t mind Shield dropping off my clothes though.”
Tony had already put out snacks for them, knowing that Peter would be starving after school, and had drinks waiting for the kids as they all piled in. He and Steve were going to stay while Peter explained what had happened to him and that he was enhanced.
“And this is of all the team.” Zach said proudly as he displayed a picture of Iron Man, a huge green thing that was Hulk, a red, white, and blue thing that was Captain America, a shiny gold and red thing with a hammer that looked more like a mallet that was Thor, a black blob with red flowing down its back that was Natasha, and a purple thing with a bow that was Clint.
Lily’s demanding cries served to bring Steve out of his reverie, and he bent down into the cot, lifting her up, “What’s wrong with her?”
Steve rolled his eyes, “How very convenient.”
It took three days for the last of the Thanos’ forces to be dealt with, and when they were the entire planet erupted into a celebration.
“How is he?” He asked.
Tony awoke sore and aching from head to foot, his arm was throbbing and he couldn’t move his fingers much, they and his arm were mottled and ugly purple with bruising and were swollen. His throat was sore too, it ached when he swallowed and had it not been for the need to empty his bladder he’d have just curled back up and gone to sleep.
“No!” Zach yelled whirling around and shot his nerf gun at Clint, Dumm-E attempted to copy him, firing his extinguisher which sprayed Zach and the work station as he lifted it up to Clint’s grinning face, Dumm-E also misjudged the space and bumped into Zach knocking him over onto the foam slick floor, Zach skidded along on his bottom and came to a stop against Tony’s shins as he came in from the lift.
