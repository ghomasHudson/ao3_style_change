“Just need the copy room keys that I asked for while you were flirting with the new gym teacher,” Peter replied, now looking unbelievably smug.
“Of course I’m sure it’s mine,” Tony answered slightly angered at the silent accusation that Steve was lying.
“Does that mean you’re gonna keep it?” Tony asked, hopeful. Steve smiled, more genuine before answering.
“Tony,” Steve started, concern evident in his voice. It took him a moment to regain his composure and fall right back into the role of a waiter. “Sorry, um I didn’t catch your drink order the first time, could you repeat it?”
"And this was after he called in some mysterious favor to reserve the aquarium for just the two of you?" All Steve could do was nod at the question. Natasha just looked at him, astonished.
Tony tossed the idea around in his head. He knew that Steve would also be chaperoning the dance, and figured that this would be a last ditch effort. If this didn’t work, he’d leave Steve alone, for good.
“Tony...are you serious?” Carol asked, wearily, “You have three full size bottles of Grey Goose per guest, not to mention you practically bought out all of New York’s alcohol supply.”
Steve put the phone down and closed his eyes for a moment just to think. Bucky might have been a jerk earlier, but he was right about one thing. A year ago, the omega would have laughed, hard, if anyone had tried to tell him that this is where he would be now. He hadn’t really spent much time thinking about who he’d have children with one day, but he couldn’t help but think that he would have liked to know the person a little bit better. Steve had to consciously stop himself from continuing on with those types of thoughts. Though the omega couldn’t honestly say he was happy with the predicament he was in, this baby already meant so much to him.
Outside of his group of friends, anyone that he told seemed to be dumbstruck by the news that the two people who a year ago could barely communicate without yelling at each other were going to have a baby. There was some part of Steve that thought he should feel embarrassed or ashamed that he accidentally got knocked up by a guy he previously couldn’t stand. But he knew that this baby deserved not to be hidden or made to feel like a mistake, even if it was unplanned. So, he would walk into any conversation with his head held high, and proudly tell those around him that yes, he was having a baby and yes, Tony Stark was the father. More often than not he was met with a ‘congratulations’ that sounded more like a question than a statement but he always accepted it all the same.
The brunet awoke to realize he had been humping the bed and whispering Steve’s name while he had been dreaming. He felt a cool pool of cum inside his boxers, once he brought his hips to a stop. Tony cursed himself, embarrassed that he’d had a wet dream like he was a god damned fourteen year old. He couldn’t even look himself in the bathroom mirror as he wet a towel to clean himself off.
He asked, finally turning to look at her. She looked on the verge of tears as she bit her lip, not meeting his eyes. She took in a long breath before turning to Steve.
“Steve, you literally just told me about how some geese tried to chase you down while you were feeding them when you were four. That’s hardly a near death experience.”
At this point, Tony felt like he was going to burn a hole in the spot on the table he had taken to staring at. There was no way he could continue his story and look his friends in the eye.
Steve re-read his words and found that he genuinely meant it. He never intended for things to get as out of hand as they had earlier in the day. He knew his friends weren’t going to be thrilled about his situation, but he knew they would ultimately have his back. It felt good to know that even after the way things had gone, he still had his best friend’s support.
“You wanna know more about me? Fine. Ask me anything you want to know,” Tony spoke, nothing but confidence and bravado in his voice.
“Look, Coulson promoted me too. I’ll be managing the web dev team, so I mean...we’ll still be working together but not like before. So, with that in mind, maybe you can come back to work?”
“Well… it’s a big place and I wanna make sure we get to see it all,” Tony offered, not wanting to hint at the fact that they had to hurry for one of his surprises.
"Regardless, I don't want to go to some party at Stark's, and have him get all drunk so he can be an even bigger asshole."
“Well, I might just start bringing you along with me to more events if you’re this good at repelling annoying conversations,” Tony said, noting the sudden shine in Steve’s eyes at the proposition.
Steve gave a sad smile in response before sighing. “I just...I feel like I’m breaking my back just to barely scrape by. I know I could be doing something I actually enjoy that pays enough for me to be able to make ends meet and have a little extra left over.”
“Well he’s not here anymore, okay? I’m all you’ve got now, so stop acting like a little brat and just do what I tell you to do!” The words and that voice sounded so foreign to Steve that it took a moment to realize that that was
It took a few minutes, and more strength than he knew he even possessed, but Steve was finally able to open his eyes. The room took some time to come into focus but once it did, all Steve saw was the look of amazement and happiness on Tony’s face, as the man cried in earnest.
"Hey," he said, giving a sheepish wave. Years of being best friends with Peggy told him that the look on her face meant she was not happy with him.  "Is something wrong?" He asked, knowing full well the answer would be yes.
“That perfect little asshole from my philosophy class keeps resisting my advances. I mean, he’d have to be absolutely blind to not see that I’ve got a thing for him!”
“Oh, so I get to stay over tonight, huh?” Tony asked in the sassiest voice he could muster. Steve just shrugged, and smiled suggestively
“You think you can hide the fact that you got someone pregnant from me? That I wouldn’t find out what my own son, the heir of the company I built with my own to hands, is up to?”
“I’m pretty sure that letting all of you live in my house is all the bonding I’m ever going to need.”
“Hey, I just wanted to say thanks again for bringing all of your friends by. I’m glad I finally got to meet them,” Tony spoke, keeping his hand on the blond’s arm.
Steve groaned, remembering all of the beer, shots, and makeshift cocktails from the night before. “Ugh, just
Tony thought. He closed his eyes and took a deep, steadying breath before walking into the classroom.
“Ah, I made one of my favorites. I figured comfort food is never a bad way to go so I made a maple bourbon pot roast.”
Sam stepped forward, hands up innocuously. “Hey, look, we didn’t mean to get on your bad side, man, just having a little fun.”
Steve knew bits and pieces of news stories about the death of the Starks, but from what he remembered, it seemed absolutely awful. The last thing he wanted was to sour their afternoon by talking about such sad things.
“YES! What does that mean?! Why did I invited him?!” Tony asked, frantically, hoping his friend had a legitimate answer for him.
“I'm fine guys,” Steve spoke, trying to sound a lot less deveststed than he felt. “Some shit went down last night with Tony, but I'm fine and he’s fine, at least he was when I left the school. Everything is okay, I'm sorry I worried you.”
“Shitty, how about you?” Tony answered, making it clear that he wasn’t going to put any effort into faking happiness.
out of this is a child. This may not have been planned, but this baby is just as important to me as it is to Steve. There’s no gimmick or plot here and whether you like it or not, Steve and I have one common goal now, and that’s to keep this baby safe. But I can promise you I will protect what is mine at any cost, don’t ever question that.”
“Steve?” His heart practically stopped once he heard his name. He looked to confirm what he already knew. Tony was sitting at the table in front of him, quite honestly, looking like hell. He seemed thinner, had circles around his eyes, and just looked absolutely miserable.
“After Nana died, what little she left Sharon and I either went into her funeral costs, or covering any debts she had. Sharon and I had nothing, we quite literally had no other options but to move back home,” Peggy offered around a sniffle, abandoning all hopes of hiding the fact that she was crying. “It was a hard decision, but I couldn’t take Cora away from you and Tony. It wouldn’t have been fair to you or her.”
They were so close, Steve could feel Tony’s breath on his face. He searched Tony’s eyes for any uncertainties, but when he realized there was nothing but sincerity behind Tony’s words, he captured the brunet’s face in his hands.
“Honey, I could honestly care less about who you date, as long as they have a good heart. I can tell just by the stories you’ve told me of your time with him that Tony has a wonderful heart. At this point, I’d be mad if you
"So...I may have made a mistake," Steve answered, bringing the alpha into his kitchen. His eyes widened upon seeing all the fruit and fruit flavored items.
“Listen, everyone, I just wanted to say I’m sorry I’ve been a blubbering mess, but it really does mean a lot to know that each and every one of you cared enough about us to come out and celebrate today,” Steve spoke, unconsciously placing his hand on his belly to emphasize who he meant by
“I hear you’re misbehaving for your daddy,” Tony started once they got comfortable. Coraline crossed her legs and twisted her hands together, bowing her head down. “Is that true?”
Howard sighed, pulling out his checkbook, scribbling something quickly, and handing a piece of paper to Tony once he’d ripped it out.
The knife Steve had been using to spread mayonnaise on the sandwiches clattered to the counter. “Fucking hell, I really want to kiss you right now.”
The alpha had kept it a secret from everyone that he and Bruce had began seeing each other for a short time while they were in college. Being that Bruce was the first guy he’d ever dated, as well as the first beta he’d ever dated, Tony wanted to keep their relationship to himself for a time. Eventually, he ended things after Howard had threatened to take everything his son had and make his life a living hell. Bruce understood the circumstances, and the two went on as just friends from that point on.
“Hon, I’ve got this. Cora and I are the best of friends at this point, and we’ll be just fine. Now get to work before you’re late.”
Tony responded with a smile of his own at Steve's words and the blond couldn't help the butterflies he felt in that moment.
Tony liked to pretend that he was a lone-alpha, and that he was fine without anyone. But he sometimes wondered what it would be like to love someone so fully that he could feel it in his bones. Almost as soon as that thought would pop into Tony's head, he'd immediately shake it off. He knew that there were some people in life who weren't meant to find their bond mate and he was almost certain he was one of them.
“Welcome to the first Robotics Team meeting of the 2018-2019 school year,” Tony began. “Now, I know that you all have been waiting all summer to get back to school specifically for this team, but I’ve got a new member to announce before we can get started.” Tony gestured towards Steve, and every single pair of eyes in the room turned. “This is our new assistant coach who also happens to be the new P.E teaching assistant, Mr. Rogers. He’ll be here to help with anything that you guys may need while working today.”
As he rounded the corner, Steve could have jumped for joy at the sight of Pepper sitting next to Tony.
“Good to see you, Barnes. Hope the arm’s still treating you well?” Tony asked with a hint of concern.
“Uh…yeah, that night. Well Tony had gotten to drinking while we were talking. One thing led to another and he… Uh, he kissed me.”
When Steve had initially suggested spending time at the Brooklyn Bridge Park, Tony didn’t know what to expect. He sure as shit didn’t expect his sobriety to become a topic of conversation, at least not so soon, but he appreciated that Steve took it so well. Learning the blond’s backstory was heart wrenching to say the least, and yet there was some comfort in knowing that he had someone who understood what it was like to lose a parent. Tony was happy with how the day had been going, and then the carousel happened.
“You’re going to Bucky and Nat’s party?” Steve asked, hopeful that this wasn’t some kind of coincidence.
“Where’s the event that I should enact this grand gesture?” Tony asked, annoyed with himself for even entertaining this.
“That can’t be right, I booked the rooms two weeks ago, I spoke with Brooke, the hotel manager, she assured me that everything would be taken care of,” Tony said, more confused than annoyed.
“I get that,” Pepper began, looking down as she smoothed out the skirt of her dress, “but I have heard that before from people who ended up doing just that. So you’ll have to forgive me for being a little weary.”
Tony tried his hardest to move like Natasha (she was far stealthier than any ninja could ever hope to be). He was able to make his way to the kitchen without being spotted. He gave a sigh of relief right as he reached the coffee machine, and he became totally oblivious to the world while he smelled the intoxicating aroma of the ground coffee. As if on cue, the second he turned around, Steve came sauntering in. They both stood shocked, like a pair of deer in headlights.
It was startling for Steve to realize that he had completely missed something so clearly out of place. The more he thought about it, though, the more he realized that aside from wanting to know if Tony was okay health wise, Steve didn't actually
“I don’t want anything to do with this after today,” Steve said, not quite able to meet Nat’s eyes. “Just...whatever your friends come up with, give it all to Tony and keep me out of it from here on out.”
The rest of the week had gone by fairly uneventfully. Steve ran into Tony a couple of times in the teacher’s lounge and they exchanged pleasantries, but nothing more than that. It was painful seeing the light leave Tony’s eyes almost immediately upon seeing Steve, but he knew this was best for the both of them. Maybe one day they might be able to get back to some semblance of a friendship, but at the moment, this was all Steve could handle.
“Oh I’ll be around here as well. I’ve kind of got the same deal as you with my family not really being close by.”
The remainder of his transaction with Tony went smoothly. Once they’d gotten past the initial awkwardness, they were able to conduct themselves like adults.
“Yeah, your game plans weren’t nearly as efficient as they could have been. In at least three of the five competitions you were in, the team missed several chances to score game ending goals.”
“Thanks, and I hope your, uh, Nana gets better soon,” Tony spoke, still trying to make sense of this.
The blond quickly locked the screen and pulled the phone into his chest. “Nothing. Quit being such a nosy Nancy,” Steve joked, moving to pick up an axe to take his turn.
“Oh no you don’t,” Tony cut in, “the two of you are not going to make me take a back seat to all your military talk. You have five minutes to get all of that out of your system while I round up the team. If I hear any military jargon when I get back, I swear to God I will only speak to you two in Python for the rest of the month.”
“Sorry, I’m just trying to understand how this made sense to you, but me thinking you quit because I asked you on a date didn’t.”
The pair of them moved around the ice, slowly at first so Tony could get his bearings, but once he got the hang of it, they were able to pick up the pace. Two hours and only three falls later, they found themselves walking, hand in hand, with two steaming cups of hot chocolate.
Steve narrowed his eyes at his friend as she stood in front of him, still holding that same nervous smile. After a moment, the blond finally gave up.
Steve groaned, his free hand rushing to unzip his own coat. After their coats were shed, Steve’s hands rushed to the hem of Tony’s sweater. In his haste to remove the clothing it ended up getting stuck on Tony’s head.
Tony had forgotten himself for a moment, in all honesty. He saw the ride and it reminded him of the times that Jarvis would let him ride the carousel whenever they found themselves in Central Park. Tony wanted to relive those moments so desperately, and to his surprise, Steve obliged. Tony found himself letting his guard down in a way he hadn’t intended, and yet, he didn’t feel embarrassed or self conscious about it, either. He just felt...comfortable and somewhat safe around Steve, at least enough to let him see a side of himself that Tony hid from everyone other than Rhodey and Pepper. Being able to open up around Steve felt good, and he didn’t know how but Tony wanted to experience that feeling again.
Not long after that, Steve and Tony got ready for the day and signed in for the meet up. There was a lot of back and forth beforehand on Tony’s part, assuring the organizers that he wasn't attending for any SI business, he was just there as a physics teacher who coached the robotics team. Still, he knew there would be people who wanted to pitch ideas to him or talk business. Any other time, he'd charm his way out of such interactions, but as soon as the first potential sales pitch walked up, Steve intercepted.
A flush crept up on Steve’s face and Tony cursed him. A grown man had no right looking that cute while blushing.
They sat in silence for a moment, before Steve gingerly lifted Tony’s chin to look at him. Steve searched his eyes for what felt like ages, before leaning in to press his lips to the brunet’s. Once he pulled away, Steve let out a small laugh.
It didn’t take much for Steve to agree to come back, once he saw the hopeful look on Tony’s face. But he knew that before he came back to work, he’d have to tell his friends what was happening. It was this, the realization that he would have to face his friends, that kept Steve from getting any real restful sleep that night.
, Tony found himself able to focus on something other than how much he was hurting. It felt like he was finally able to breath, and Tony didn't care what it took, he was determined to hold on to that feeling for as long as humanly possible.
Steve considered Tony’s words, really letting it all sink in. “So what you’re telling me is if I start wearing more of your oversized sweaters, we’ll have more nights like this one?”
Steve turned towards Tony with a sweet yet nervous smile. “I know you've not always had good memories of Christmas with your family,” Steve began, rubbing a thumb over Tony’s cheek, “so I wanted to start anew, to hopefully turn Christmas into a day that you look forward to.”
Clint opened two of the gym doors, leading the way, but smiling over his shoulder. “Oh boy, you are going to have a
“Look I...have some things I need to explain to you all. I just need you to let me get through what I need to say before anyone else says anything, alright?”
“So…” Bucky began, “Nat’s been telling me about your new friend, Stark. She’s got nothing but great things to say about the guy, mainly because since he’s been photographed at the bar, it’s brought in tons of business. But Clint and Sam tell me he only ever comes in to talk to you. He’ll buy a drink or two but he’s really just there for you.”
Steve just gave a soft smile. “Sweetheart, I'm sure. I’ve had a lot of time to think since I got to the cabin and I'm ready, Tony. I want to know how good it feels to have you inside me.”
Steve watched, with a sad smile, as his mom brought out her wheelchair. He tried not to dwell on the fact that there was a time when she was healthy and could walk for miles on end, and focused on the fact that he was just lucky to have her around at all. She didn’t let her condition get the better of her, so he refused to let himself be consumed by pity for her.
“Well, since you were busy and you weren’t feeling well, I decided to bring you back some soup. And before you ask, it’s not chicken noodle, it’s Italian wedding soup.”
“To me, Tony Stark: rich, famous tech genius and Tony Stark: charming, sweet, brilliant physics teacher and robotics team coach are two completely different people. Despite all the designer clothes and the nice sports cars, I regularly forget that he’s
“Oh, well I was thinking maybe you’d like to accompany me and the rest of the team on a bonding exercise.”
“Sorry I...sorry,” Steve stammared, “I just wanted to make sure I got here before you left so I could apologize for missing lunch today.”
“Aye aye, Captain,” Tony said, giving a small salute before heading up the stairs to the master bedroom. Once he got to their room, he took stock of the setup that Steve had. A small glass for water throughout the night and a copy of the latest book he was reading sat atop the left bedside table. Tony found the simplicity of Steve's nighttime habits to be unbelievably endearing. Especially when he himself pulled out his Stark Pad to keep bedside, in the event he wanted to continue working on anything from the comfort of his bed.
The sweetness of Steve’s words sent a warm feeling straight to Tony’s core. “Give me one second,” Tony said as he stood up, looking around the room for things to gather. He laid out a blanket on the floor closer to the fire place, then brought a few pillows over. He looked around for one last item, eyes landing on Steve as he cleared his throat and held up a small bottle of lube.
“Well...yeah. You’re in another world when you’re working on the things that mean the most to you, and I thought it’d be nice to be able to show that to you.”
Steve held his breath while he waited for a response, realizing after a moment just how silly he was being.
“You promised you wouldn’t try to figure out where we were and you didn’t keep your promise. So… snowbank for you!” Tony said, crossing his arms in a huff. Before he knew it, his legs were being knocked out from under him and he felt the wet cold of the snow.
“Wait, what gave you the impression that I didn’t want whatever it is you were thinking you wanted?” Tony asked.
“Do you like it?” Tony asked, now sounding unsure of himself. Steve just pulled him in for a gentle kiss before answering; “I absolutely love it.”
Steve hadn’t put much thought into how his first interaction with Tony post-break up would go, but Steve was pleasantly surprised with how well it had gone. It gave him hope that maybe the two of them could at least maintain a friendship of some sort one day. His mind was racing with thoughts of his impending friendship with Tony, as he looked over the tip that was left for him.
Steve sheepishly smiled back at the redhead before giving a quick nod to remind himself that he was going to be fine.
“He wasn’t actually dead, relax,” Tony huffed, “he was just sitting there with his eyes closed and not moving. So I knocked on the window to ask if he was okay and he said he was just collecting himself before getting the day started. Do you know what that means?!”
“That bad, huh?” Tony asked, glossing over the fact that he was impressed but also sad that he missed a side of Steve that, quite frankly, sounded hot as hell.
As Steve continued to eat his lunch, he thought over the events of his day, and realized that the alpha was right. Something truly was not right with him and as badly as he wanted to pretend that he was okay, everyone could clearly see that he wasn’t. Steve knew that nothing was going to get better until he saw someone, he was just terrified of finding out what it was that was wrong.
As they passed building after building, Tony tried to think of what he wanted to say, but no matter what, everything he came up with gave away much more about his feelings than he wanted them to. Finally he just settled on the whole
In the chaos of everything, the pair had managed to neglect to decorate a nursery for Mason, but their friends just assured them that everything would be taken care of. All they had to do was make sure Mason got better and came home.
to ourselves.” Steve grinned. “I have another present for us.” Steve produced a wrapped bottle from behind his back. “Merry Christmas.”
“He got through the surgery alright, but he’s been unconscious since he arrived. They say his vitals are promising, so there’s nothing to worry about, I just...wish I could tell him that I’m here and that everything is going to be alright.”
Tony stopped, dead in his tracks, pulling Steve to a stop with him. He turned to face the brunet but before he could get a word out, Tony pulled him in for a deep kiss. They stood there like that for a long moment, before pulling away.
Tony groaned and got to the couch, dropping down next to Steve. “You have to promise not to punch me in the face.”
“Yes, you! We’ve been working in the same office for three years, and somehow it took a blizzard and a completely empty office for me to finally get your attention.”
They sat in silence again for a moment. He knew Carol wasn’t going to say anything until he answered her question.
Steve couldn’t take his eyes off of the bot in his hands. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to bear seeing the look on the brunet’s face. “I appreciate you coming by and saying that, Tony. Your words mean a lot to me, truly.” Steve began, sadness seeping into his voice. “I accept your apology, but the things you said really hurt me. I think we can be friendly in the teacher’s lounge or at school events, but right now I just...I can’t deal with anything more than that with you.”
It wasn’t until Bucky reached out to put a hand on Steve’s shoulder that he realized he’d been crying. He laughed around a small sob, before wiping at his eyes and nose.
In that moment, all he wanted was to call Steve, to tell him how horrible his father had been. He pulled his phone out and let his finger hover over the ‘call’ button before he remembered the hole he’d dug himself into. Tony was so tired; tired of the lying and pretending. He wanted to let Steve in, and to trust him with all of his secrets, but he couldn’t if he didn’t open up first.
On his walk to his new job, he internally ran through all the things he’d learned while training for his bartending certification. All the drinks he could remember with their exact recipes popped up in his mind, one by one. Before he knew it, he was standing in front of the bar. He took a deep breath as he looked up to see the
“Working on a different team means no more working with Steve...at least not directly anyway. I mean sure, I’ll have to meet with the graphic design team to talk over designs for web content and all that but it won’t really be the same. I’ve grown to really like working with him…”
“So you’re trying to tell me that you were too busy to make time for this, is that it?” Steve interrupted.
“Okay, well I lost my dad when I was fairly young, but my grandpa, my ma’s father, was always around to help look after us. He passed away when I was 12, and even though I’ve missed him every day since, I know  he’s always with me. His name was Mason, so I was thinking maybe that could be a contender,” Steve finished, feeling a little nervous about what Tony would think.
“What are these?” Tony asked, pulling the omega’s left arm towards him to get a closer look at what seemed to be bite marks.
“I’m sowy for not eatin’ da peas. An’ I’m sowy for bein’ mean ta yew,” She said in a small voice, before tightly wrapping her arms around his neck. “I love yew, daddy.”
“Natasha, I know what you’re going to say--” Steve began, but stopped once he realized who was standing in front of him.
“Just so you know, I’m never trusting you with anything ever again,” he said, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose.
Today was the day. The Halloween party had finally arrived, and Tony was running around his house frantically trying to make sure everything was in order.
and this short blond guy just came over and started talking to me. He made a wicked Moscow Mule and I just ended up staying there the rest of the night talking to him. I think I maybe only had two drinks, total. But it was just nice getting to sit there and not have to be anything for anyone else. I’ve been going back ever since, and oddly enough I just came from hanging out with him. I ran into him at the museum and we just decided to make a day of it.”
“Well...I heard you quit and Natasha said it was my fault and I wanted to apologize for asking you on a date for dinner.”
“Love you, too.” When their breaths evened out, Steve turned Tony’s face to look at him. “We’re doing that again, right?”
“Okay so…” Natasha started, looking at Tony expectantly. When it became clear Tony had no clue what she wanted from him, she sighed. “Go after him!”
“Well, hey there little Masie, you gave me quite a scare, showing up a little early, but I should have known that any child of Tony Stark’s would be intent on coming into this world with a big entrance,” Steve laughed, through tears.
Tony looked puzzled for a moment before realization hit. “Oh yeah, lunch! I got tied up with some stuff and didn’t get a chance to make it out of my classroom. So if you missed lunch too then no harm no foul.”
Steve rolled down his window and cleared his throat in an effort to calm himself down before he spoke. “I’m good...just...trying to collect myself before starting the day.”
“We had fun. Cora has something she wants to tell you,” Natasha said, as she pushed the toddler in Steve’s direction. Once she finally reached him, Cora began to tug on Steve’s pant leg.
It was no surprise, then, that when Steve finally did fall asleep, the only dream he had was of Tony. This dream, though, was something Steve had never expected. It involved the two of them, completely naked, bodies entwined. Tony making promises to take care of Steve, caressing his body, and making him feel things he’d never felt before. Tony worked slowly, to bring Steve to his release, and once he was almost there, the blond woke up to the not so wonderful sight of a raging hard on. He groaned, embarrassed and slightly ashamed, as he shoved his hand down the front of his boxers to finish what his dreams had started. If he came to thoughts of Tony finishing him off, he wasn’t going to admit it.
It only took a matter of seconds for Tony to throw Steve face down on his bed, and to get undressed. He looked down at what lay in front of him and silently cursed at the sight of Steve working himself open.
“You’re gonna get to be big and strong like your daddy, aren’t you?” She nodded again, giggling. “C’mon. Show me a muscle. Let me see your muscles. Woah! Look at those things!” he squeezed the top of her flexed arm. “You’re
“Mr. Stark, will you take a team picture with us?” Peter asked, pulling Tony along without giving him a chance to actually answer.
Carol threw her hands up in defeat, as she walked out of the kitchen. Tony had been an absolute wreck in the few weeks leading up to his Halloween party. He spent every free moment he had trying to make sure that there wasn’t a single forgotten detail, and when asked about his behavior, Tony would always laugh it off.
Tony sat on the loveseat in his living room, sorrowfully looking down at the wrapped gift he held in his hand. He had texted Steve early that morning to let him know that everyone would be heading over to his place around 7 pm that night, but he was more than welcome to come earlier if he wanted. Tony didn’t get a response, which he found unusual, but he didn’t dwell on it too much. Until 6:45 pm rolled around, and everyone was there but the one person he’d been most excited to see. Those first fifteen minutes that Tony waited, eyes glued to the clock, were excruciating.
“It’s a great movie! Plus, I figure we’ve both probably seen it enough times that neither of us would mind if we missed anything,” Steve said, hoping that he wasn’t being too forward. It’d been a long time since he had dated anyone, let alone had the opportunity for anything physical. That wasn’t all Tony was to Steve but he’d be lying if he said that wasn’t something he wanted.
Pepper led the way as they walked through the house to find Tony and Rhodey. Once they were all together, Steve immediately went for the brunet.
The pace Tony set wasn’t slow, but there was no sense of frenzy or a need to hurriedly chase their release. It was just the two of them, taking their time. Steve felt Tony lean down, pressing his chest to Steve’s back. “You feel absolutely incredible around me, willing to take anything I give you,” Tony whispered, running a hand through Steve’s hair. “Wonder if I could make you come just like this; on nothing but my cock. Think you can?”
Ben looked between Steve and Tony, confused. Steve just smiled warmly with an expectant look. Ben quickly realized defeat as he turned to continue the conversation with Steve. As the morning went on, any time someone approached Tony in the same manner, Steve would step forward to steer the conversation towards the robotics team. It only took an hour for the other meetup attendees to catch on, only approaching Tony if they were legitimately interested in discussing robotics. No shop talk, no pitches,
“Hi,” he said, breathlessly. Tony just smiled at him, brushing a hand over Steve’s arm as he walked into the apartment.
“Oh, this place is called Elephant Jumps. I saw something about it on the Cooking Channel and everything sounded great so I figured you’d like to try it too.”
Tony Stark. Half the time it just feels like they’re two separate people with the same name. So no, I'm not chasing after any of that stuff, I'm honestly just interested in Tony.”
Tony plopped down at his desk, beginning to working as hard as he could to keep his mind off of things. He didn’t come up for air for several hours, but when he did, he made note that it was almost time for Steve to stop by to ask about lunch. Tony heard the telltale footsteps making their way towards his desk and he shut his eyes as he held his breath. The footsteps stopped right at his desk, and he opened his eyes to see a very irate looking Natasha staring down at him.
“I assumed just as much, but you really shouldn’t waste your breath. There’s nothing you could say that hasn’t already been said on the matter,” Tony replied, looking through the menu on the table.
“I’d planned to be captain again my senior year, but my mom got sick, so I ended up quitting the team in order to find a part time job at a local bookstore to help with stuff around the house.” Steve found himself fighting to keep his composure. It’d been a while since he’d shared this part of his life with anyone. “So, uh, towards the end of senior year, my mom passed away. I didn’t really know what to do after high school, with no means of paying for college, so I just went into the Army and Bucky followed me in a year later after he graduated as well. I spent four years trying to work up to becoming a strategist, but ended up being discharged after breaking my femur in a longboarding accident, of all things,” Steve said, giving a humorless laugh. “After being discharged, I went to college, worked at a gym, then found this TA job through Nat and here we are.”
Steve said his goodbyes before heading towards Tony’s classroom clutching his notebook and the rest of his food. As exhausting as it could be dealing with his friends, Steve found himself feeling like a huge weight had just been lifted off his shoulders. He’d been considering asking Tony out on a date but wanted a sign from anyone that it wasn't a horrible mistake. If three of his closest friends thought it was a good idea then that had to count for something.
They fell into a comfortable silence after that. Steve found himself admiring the scenery while Tony fiddled with the radio until he found a rock station that seemed suitable enough. From then on, they’d both occasionally hum along to the tunes playing, just enjoying each other's company. Before they knew it, they’d made it to their hotel. Tony had promised he’d take care of booking their accommodations, and though Steve was hesitant initially, worried about what lavish rooms Tony would book, he was pleasantly surprised by how subdued their hotel turned out to be.
Steve stood there, hands balled into fists at his side as he took in Natasha’s words. He wanted to storm out of the store, drive home and leave his friend there to think about what she’d done, but as much as he hated to admit it, she did have a point.
Peter looked at Tony suspiciously, narrowing his eyes. He then turned to make sure no one was at the door before speaking again. “Mr. Stark, with all due respect, I’ve seen you try to charm Aunt May —”
“Yeah, that’d be nice, but first...I have something to show you.,” the blond answered, standing to pull out his wallet.
Tony was a natural around Cora. Of course he was always nervous that he’d fuck everything up somehow, but really all he had to do was the complete opposite of everything his father did and he’d be fine.
“Well, tell me a little bit more about your feelings for Steve. I need to fully understand the situation we’re dealing with here.”
“Where is he getting this money?” Natasha asked, from her position on the floor in front of the bed.
He couldn’t believe that after all of his hard work, Vision had decided that he was worthy of a promotion. And while he was endlessly grateful for this opportunity, he couldn’t help feeling bad about what this meant for Tony. Realizing that it would be best not to ask, Steve stood, thanked Coulson once more, and left. Seconds after getting to his desk, Tony peaked his head around the walls of Steve’s cube.
“We’ve been trying to take care of Cora as best we can for people in our situation,” Steve explained. Coraline was on the floor in front of them, playing with blocks. “Peggy lives at home with her sister, Sharon, and Grandma, so they’re able to help look after Cora while she takes night classes for nursing school. Then she comes to visit me every other weekend. That’s why the school allowed to let me live off campus as a freshman. You know, so I could take care of my daughter. I don’t get to see her as much as I’d like to, but I always have to remind myself that I’m doing this for her,” Steve said. He got down on the floor with her and took her in his arms. She giggled wildly and pretended to fight her way out of Steve’s grip.
The alpha quickly made his way to the door and took a deep breath, steadying himself before opening it to reveal Steve, wearing a dark blue pullover that seemingly hugged every curve of his body and grey khakis that did the same. He let out a breath, feeling like the wind had just been knocked out of him. Steve gave him a small smirk at that.
“I would love to share more of my favorite foods with you,” Tony finally replied, earning a bashful smile from the man sitting across for him.
That was all it took for the alpha to act. He took Steve’s arm and dragged him down the back hallway.
It didn’t take long after his friends left for Tony to start hitting the booze. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t end up having a good time with everyone, but it was in spite of himself. He was bitter, he was angry, but mostly he was hurt that Steve didn’t show up, didn’t even send so much as a ‘fuck off’ text. Every so often he’d wonder if the omega had planned to do this, as a form of payback for the past few years. Almost as soon as he’d think it, though, he’d remind himself that no matter what, Steve wasn’t that kind of guy.
Something about the atmosphere in the car changed over the last few minutes. Tony didn’t know what it was, but he’d be lying if he said it didn’t make him feel electrified with excitement and some kind of tension. Good tension, but tension nonetheless. “Well, there’s being fashionably late and then there’s just being an asshole, so we should probably head up to the party to avoid being the latter,” Tony said, as they parked. He reached behind the passenger seat to grab the gift bag before getting out to follow Steve.
Natasha considered this for a moment. “You’ve never seen him before?” she asked, narrowing her eyes. Tony shook his head in response.
Tony awoke, slowly, coming to for the first time in a long time without the aid of his alarm. He reached out to look at his phone to check the time before deciding that he might as well wake up now. Tony went through the motions of getting ready, showering, brushing his teeth, shaving and fixing his hair. Once he was done getting ready, the brunet looked at himself in the mirror, noticing that he looked as lifeless as he felt.
Steve really considered Pepper’s words, thinking back on Tony’s actions prior to their breakup. He’d only ever seen all the extravagant gifts as Tony trying to buy his love. It had never occurred to him that that was Tony’s way of trying to
“I just can't believe how well you and Steve got along, I mean I can since I'm a man of discerning taste and I wouldn't befriend or try to date just anyone. But also did you see how much of a smoke show that man is?! He almost exclusively wears shirts that aren't even sort of in the realm of an acceptable size. But how does one even attempt to produce a garment capable of containing those muscles? And you saw how wonderfully he did as the assistant coach; helping the kids sort out the best course of action during each round. He’s great with the team and Peter thinks the world of him and I’m just happy that my favorite people all get along,” Tony blurted out in one breath.
“Alright, yeah, I should probably be heading out anyways. I’ve got a bit of work to do in the workshop tonight.”
“I randomly found the receipt from the bed and breakfast that we stayed at for New Years Eve, too,” Steve spoke, readjusting himself to lay on his stomach on Natasha’s bed. “I was doing laundry and I found it in his pants. Nat… he spent three hundred dollars on that room.”
“Can we go now? We should go now!” Tony said, practically bursting with excitement, legs still wrapped around Steve. As they made their way out to play indoor mini golf, Rhodey leaned in to Pepper.
kids...that was something special. He tried as best he could to file away the image of this first meeting before it all came to an end, but once it did, Tony found himself in the room again with just Steve and Peter.
“Because you and Tony were supposed to give her the family you and I never could,” Peggy yelled. Steve sat, stunned for a moment.
“Is dat Ony?!?” Cora yelled from somewhere off screen. In a matter of seconds, Steve’s face was replaced with a very excited Coraline in her
“Hey, so what is it exactly that you have to say about what’s going on that I might not like?” Steve asked, slowing his pace to allow more time to talk. Bucky looked at him, warily, trying to decide how to word his response.
“Ready for a snack, nugget?” Tony asked, working to prepare a small bowl of Cheerios and banana slices. He took Cora’s high pitched squeal as a yes.
Steve just shook his head and rolled his eyes, taking a seat at the desk closest to Clint’s. As he started looking through the stack of paperwork in front of him, Steve knew, now more than ever, that he was going to like it at Midtown High just fine.
Over time, things got better and better between Tony and Steve. Apologies were exchanged (Steve apologized, Tony shrugged and told him he wasn’t as terrible as he could have been), and somehow a friendship formed. At first it made no sense why the pair spent so much time together. Tony was a man of the future while Steve was literally a man of the past. As annoying as it was that he always shad to repeat himself at least four times when explaining things, Tony loved seeing Steve’s face light up at every new piece of technology that he came across. Obviously, Tony would poke fun at Steve every chance he got, but Steve came to appreciate the teasing. He couldn’t give as good as he got, but Steve was learning how sarcasm worked in the 21st century.
“I um… wasn’t sure when would be the best time to give this to you, but Cora insisted that I give it to you so you have it for your trip.” Steve fished a small box from his jacket pocket and handed it to Tony. He watched carefully as the brunet opened his gift and smiled once Tony barked out a laugh at what he saw. It was a misshapen mound of hardened clay attached to a thin ribbon.
“I can make us some lunch, if you’d like,” Steve offered. Tony nodded, not saying a word. He took his jacket off and hung it on the hook by the door.
“PRESENTS!” Cora screamed, taking a running leap onto Tony’s lap. “I’m gonna help you open them, mista. You gotta do it careful so dat ya don’t hurt da presents, kay?”
Tony rushed forward and grabbed Steve’s face in his hands, thumbs wiping away his tears. “Shh, baby, no. I understand. You don’t have to trust me right now. I fucked up and I was wrong, but please… please don’t let me go. I love you so fucking much. Please don’t… please don’t break up with me. I don’t think I could… I don’t think I’d survive that.”
He truly had missed spending time like this with his friends, he hoped that as his pregnancy went on he’d be able to find a way to balance his life with his friends and he new life with Tony and their baby. That thought made Steve’s heart skip a beat, not without Natasha noticing.
Tony wracked his brain to think of who he could call to see if Steve had come into work without letting on about missing the appointment. He quickly dialed Carol’s number and waited for her to pick up.
Tony took a sip, tasting the soda water with a hint of lime. He felt his cheeks warm as he gave a small smile and nodded. Steve responded with a single nod before turning back to the group. “So, what were you guys talking about while I was away?” he asked, taking a sip of whatever brown liquid he had in his glass.
“I’ve been your best friend for twelve years, Steve. At this point it’s not that hard for me to decipher what you’re saying when you mumble into a pillow.”
He stayed silent the entire ride back to the school, easily able to mask his silence as disappointment in the outcome of the match. Once off the bus, Tony had hoped for a chance to slip away, to get Peter home then go back to his workshop without any trouble, but he had no such luck. Steve caught him by the wrist and pulled him away from where the students were waiting for their parents.
“Honestly, I don’t know. When I last saw him, he asked me to look into this—” Natasha said, pulling out a manila envelope with a small scrap of paper taped to the front, and handing it to Tony. “After the robotics meet, he’d talked to the DeWitt coach and poked around for as much information as he could. He gave me what he had, and I passed it on to some of my friends to do some digging. Even after you broke his heart, he still wanted to help you get to the bottom of this.”
be having this talk while you try not to die,” Sam muttered, miraculously pulling out another plate of food and Gatorade for the brunet. “Anyway, we wanted to talk to you, Steve—”
“Natasha….Natasha, Natasha, Natasha!” Tony yelled, practically running down the hallway looking for the foreign language classrooms. Once he finally found the room he was looking for, he burst through the door. “NATASHA!” Tony yelled, clearly scaring the red head as she sat at her desk.
Of course, as a teacher, he had to find a way to avoid being accused of favoritism. So he took Peter under his wing, mostly within the robotics team; and if he managed to find a way to help Aunt May make the bills every month, while putting aside a scholarship for Peter’s college, well...that was his little secret.
It all started with that argument on the helicarrier: Cap throwing his hateful words at Tony and Tony spitting his words out with the same amount of venom. Tony didn’t know it at the time; he couldn’t see it. But that first encounter he had with his childhood hero, where the Captain didn’t quite live up to the legend, was the beginning of something amazing.
“I’m working at Nat’s bar after work at the magazine during the week. It’s something totally different than I’m used to but it’s so much fun! I’ve gotten to meet some really great people.”
“No, we’re definitely talking about you, and how you’re an absolute idiot who’s made a colossal mistake.”
that we have enough drinks for everyone?” Tony asked his friends, nervously. They all looked back at him in slight confusion.
When Tony woke up that day, he had some sort of feeling that the day wasn’t going to go all that well. Having Bucky here was enough to confirm that that feeling was correct.
“Yeah, of course. Are you with Tony? I’m expecting him soon, but he didn’t say anything about bringing you.”
“Are you kidding me right now?” Bruce asked, barely above a whisper. “All he did was make a joke, and you nearly just lost it on the spot.”
“Ok, well you clearly have something you wanted to talk about so why don’t we do that then eat?” Bucky offered.
date. That means I can’t actually tell you anything until we get there,” Tony answered, taking his eyes off the road for a moment to look at his boyfriend in the passenger seat. Steve had managed to nod off in the seconds it took for Tony to respond. He just smiled to himself, brushing a piece of hair off of Steve’s forehead before returning his attention back on the road.
“Oh man, guys, thanks so much for coming over to help. Wait, hold on, why are either of you here?” Tony asked, finally realizing how odd it was that Steve’s friends had shown up in his time of need.
“The whole idea of tonight was to get you out of the house. You know, get you back into the real world. Not for you to sit here and drink all by yourself.”
“I would have ruined your life if we’d stayed together, and I would have ruined his. As much as I hate Howard for being such an asshole, he was right when he said I’d do nothing but hurt and disappoint Steve and our daughter. Everybody’s hurting, but they’re better off this way.”
“I’m so glad the story of my near death experience brought you so much joy,” Steve offered with a smile.
Steve led the way through the very small garden, as they walked in a companionable silence, and once they came across a semi secluded area, they took a seat.
He hated that he wasn’t being completely honest with Steve, more than anything. All Tony wanted was to come clean about his identity, and move past it, but a small part of him kept insisting the worst. No matter how ridiculous his thoughts were, Tony truly feared that Steve would leave him once he knew the truth.
Tony exclaimed. It only took a fraction of a second for him to realize that that probably wasn’t the best choice of words. He immediately stood up, becoming aware of just how hard his dick was.
to get inside to find the source of that heavenly smell. Tony suddenly found himself wanting to do nothing but devour whatever was producing that scent, and with that thought he delivered a knock that dented the metal door. With that, he heard some movement within the apartment and suddenly the door opened.
“So seriously, Tony, when are we going to meet Steve?” Pepper asked, unfolding her napkin to place in her lap.
School started again in a few days and Pepper decided that Tony needed to get out of his room, get some fresh air, and become human again before that happened. So here they were, at the Olive Garden where Pepper insisted they go. Tony hated the Olive Garden.
Steve’s eyes went wide as he realized Rumlow’s feet weren’t on the ground. As Tony continued to lift him, gripping his throat tighter and tighter, Steve reached for his arm. “Babe…”
“Listen, during the week, it’s literally just me, Sam and Clint working. I could really use someone else on bar. You wouldn’t be making as much in tips as the weekend crew, but once you work your way up to it I can move you around to see what the best fit is for you.”
Natasha quickly pulled the blond behind her through the store, warding off any employees who asked if they needed any help as they made their way to the items that they apparently came to look at.
“It’s all I’ve listened to since--” his voice broke and he buried his face into his pillow. After a few moments, he surfaced. “Howard was right.”
She looked up at Tony as if she’d been betrayed. “Daddy told ya dat?” she asked, bottom lip quivering.
“Listen, Fury wouldn’t be too happy about us switching sections, so you’re just going to have to get through this, okay? Just try your best to treat him like any other customer. If there’s any funny business, or if you legitimately feel uncomfortable, come find me and I’ll take over. Got it?”
The pair of them walked in silence to the coffee shop around the corner. Once they had ordered and found a seat, Steve ran a hand through his hair and sighed.
Steve thought over the question. He couldn’t deny the fact that Tony’s seemingly sudden change of character was a little odd, but then he thought about how nice the past few weeks had been with the two of them actually getting along, and wanted that to continue.
“Let me help you,” Steve said, getting on the floor across from Tony. “I’m gonna put my foot in your lap and you’re gonna pull from the bottom, alright?” Steve instructed, situating himself.
Tony let Carol’s words sink for a moment. He’d been so busy trying to run from the mistakes that his parents made, he hadn’t had time to realize that he didn’t have to run at all.
There was a laundry list of things that Tony had planned to say in this moment; so many unsaid ‘I love you’s that needed to be shared. But for now, Tony figured that letting Steve kiss him breathless would do just fine.
All at once, the pants gave, and Tony flew backwards, hitting himself in the face with his own fist.
With that, Tony was launched into another fit of laughter. It had been six hours since he’d first run into the shorter man at the museum. In that time, they walked around the city to find lunch, ate food, then continued to walk around the city, eventually ending up at Steve’s apartment. There, they had a few beers and learned a little more about one another. As they sat there laughing uncontrollably, Tony thought that asking Steve to hang out outside of the bar was a genius idea, though he’d never actually say as much to Rhodey.
“So uh… I actually brought you here because I wanted to talk about some things,” Steve started, not quite able to look Tony in the eye. “I wanted to apologize for everything I’ve put you through.”
“I probably wouldn’t, on the sole count that you just said ‘wicked awesome’, but we’ll see,” Steve answered with a shrug.
“Happy birthday,” Steve whispered, wrapping an arm around the brunet’s waist. Cora tugged on Tony’s pant leg, gesturing that she wanted to be picked up. Once he obliged, she gave him a kiss on the cheek and smiled.
“Alright, good. As long as we’re on the same page about that then I’ll give you a chance to make up for this.”
The two of them finally made their way out to get breakfast. Though Steve felt as though he’d gotten a huge weight off his chest, there was still one more person he needed to tell before he felt that he could truly come to terms with his new found feelings.
“It’s never too early for you, hold on,” Steve moved quickly, and after a few minutes he returned with a slightly groggy Cora.
Steve graciously took the clothes, and changed quickly in the bathroom. When he left the guest room, he found Tony sitting on the living room floor, coffee in hand as he looked out the window.
Tony wasn't sure how, but he knew that no matter what, he’d have Tiberius dealt with by the end of the week. For now, though, he needed to put all of his brain power into figuring out how to get Steve back.
Tony shot up immediately, groaning once he noticed the erection he was sporting. It had been weeks since he’d seen Steve through his heat, and though he’d promised that things would go back to normal, they had been anything but. The pair still tried to make their regular lunch dates, but with their growing workload, it had gotten harder and harder to actually make time for one another.
Steve sat there, feeling his face grow warmer at Peter’s words. “Peter I…” he stammered trying to think of what to say.
As the video began to play, Steve worked himself open with his fingers. He spent a good deal of time just trying to get past the feeling of an intrusion, and after some time, managed to find the pleasure in it. When he thought he was ready, he began to inch the vibrator inside, making sure to take time to adjust to the size. Once the toy was fully seated, he switched it on the lightest setting, Steve took a deep breath, ready to see if he was really enjoy this. He turned his attention back to the porno that he had playing, as he began to work the vibrator in and out. Though he was enjoying the sensations, the video wasn’t motivating him the way he had hoped. He turned the it off and looked up at the ceiling, deciding maybe he’d be better off using his imagination. He flipped the vibrator onto the lowest setting and fully seated it inside himself, as he took hold of his cock and closed his eyes.
“It’s Steve,” Bruce spoke, “he was in a car accident and he’s been rushed to the ER. We’re going to have to deliver your daughter, today.”
“Oh my god, these costumes are perfect,” Bucky spoke, trying to catch his breath. He fished around in his pocket to find his phone to take a picture.
Thanks sooooooo much to everybody for all of your kind words and kudos!!!! I'm super excited to finally be posting the first chapter so I hope you guys enjoy this labor of love and awesomeness!!!
realizes how easily he let you in,” Pepper said with a sad smile. “I think in the end, it was easier for Tony to believe that you were so perfect because you were playing a part, rather than believing that you are who you say you are and for some reason you chose him.”
“Fair point…” Tony offered, not wanting to fully admit that his friends were right, “How about this, next weekend I’ll set something up, ok? Is that enough to get you guys off my back?”
What made this worse, though, was that at least Steve understood why he had been discharged; but for the life of him, he couldn’t understand this. It hurt, realizing that he trusted Tony so completely, but those feelings clearly weren’t reciprocated. Steve supposed he really only had himself to blame here though. Most people didn’t fall in love as fast as Steve did, and as history showed, they certainly didn’t fall that fast for
Cora nodded, sniffling. “Okay.” They walked hand in hand until they reached the front of the restaurant. “Ony, I haf’ta go potty.”
Finally, before anything could ruin his chances again, Tony jumped up the second the professor said they were excused and bolted over to Steve’s desk.
Bucky looked at the blond for a moment, slightly confused before fully realizing what Steve was trying to say.
Steve woke up to the now wonderfully familiar feeling of being instantly nauseous. He threw back the covers and ran to the bathroom, barely making it before the contents of his stomach made their way up. Once he felt he was finally finished, he slid over closer to the tub to rest his head on the side. As he sat there, Steve thought back to the day before.
Tony ran through what the woman had said, as she gingerly handed the sleeping girl off to Steve. The child, more of a baby really, had the same dark brown curls as her mother.
"So, if you're done looking at us all sentimental like, we'd really like to see how adorable Bug is outside of Steve's Buddha belly," Clint spoke up from the back of the group.
“I will be at your place by 8. I expect steak and potatoes with a full bodied red wine,” was all Carol said before hanging up.
“Well, I’ve literally only left twice to get groceries since I’ve last seen you. We had a movie night, I met with my women’s group for bible study, and I’ve started making fruit smoothies every morning. Now that you’ve been caught up on my boring life, you can tell me about you!”
Steve did one last cursory look before taking out his phone to check the time: 1:05. He was to meet Tony at the Brooklyn Bridge Park in 25 minutes, so he needed to get going if he wanted to make it there a little early. As he walked, Steve tried to calm his nerves by reminding himself that he was just going to spend the afternoon with his friend, same as he would with any other friend.
. Steve continued to stroke himself, but his movements had become more erratic; more needy. Tony regained some motor function and swatted Steve’s hand away, grabbing at his dick. It wasn’t long before Steve was coming in thin strips on Tony’s chest.
“I’ll say! MJ and I have a pretty solid idea for the bot we’d like to build. I can’t wait to get started!” Peter said, excitedly.
He didn’t need to look down at his phone when it vibrated to let him know that it was Tony asking to be buzzed in. He hit the button and unlocked the door, positioning himself on the couch in a faux casual manner. God, he probably looked as fake as he felt.
Steve sighed, rubbing his hand at the back of his neck. “I was planning on asking him on a date after our final meet.”
“Honey, I’m home,” Tony sang, making his way through the living room. Steve poked his head out of the kitchen and gave a huge smile. “Hi sweetheart, go put your bags down and come join me for dinner in 10.”
Tony sat up, fighting tears as he grabbed at his clothes. He didn’t bother putting them on, just held them over his junk as he ran out the door. Once he slammed it behind him he realized that he’d left the key inside. He fell to the floor and cried until he couldn’t anymore.
“Surprise! Happy birthday!!!” Steve and Cora yelled in unison as they stood in a fully decorated living room. There were streamers, balloons, and even a ‘Happy Birthday Tony’ sign hung. As he walked through the room, taking in all the decorations, Steve gently put Cora down, moving to give him a kiss on the temple.
“I can definitely keep what I’ve found under wraps but you can’t really just uninstall JARVIS. We have no real reason to go through any of Viastone’s servers from here on out but just remember that all the company’s sensitive information lives in my AI’s brain now so...that’d be another great reason not to piss me off, lest I tell your board about that huge fuck up on your part, as well.”
As Tony continued poking around with some of the circuit boards connected to his little bot, he heard a knock on the door. “Come in,” he said without looking up. After a moment of silence, he looked up to see Steve standing there, looking at him with a small smile on his face. “Uh...hi,” Tony spoke, feeling his cheeks heat a bit under the blond’s gaze.
Steve wanted to hide the moment he saw the look on Bucky’s face. He desperately wanted to remove himself from the conversation, and just run, but he knew that he owed it to his baby to stay strong. The omega squared his shoulders and lifted his chin in an attempt to show that he wasn’t going to back down. His actions didn’t go unnoticed.
“Totally fine,” Tony began, “I have a lot of work I need to get done before the work week starts so I’ll just...see myself out.”
“Tony, I know it’s been a while, but I’m pretty sure we talked about this. If you’ve got a problem, you need to clearly state what it is. I’m not a mind reader, I don’t know what you’re thinking.”
“Didn’t take you long to get rid of every trace of mom, huh?” Tony asked, looking at the walls that used to house paintings that meant the world to his mother.
Ty looked at Tony, a bit confused. “I think you misunderstood our last interaction. I’m not looking to partner or compromise here. I literally just wanted to steal your code and fuck with you as I did it. You’ve served your purpose here, I don’t need or want anything else from you at this point.”
Tony barked out a laugh that genuinely startled Steve as they walked through the front door. “Alright, well the guest room is the third door on the right. I’ll just be in the kitchen getting our coffee together when you’re ready.”
"Well, thank you for that. I'm probably still gunna keep talking to Bug while you're asleep though, since we’ve already got such a good thing going,” Tony offered, giving an apologetic shrug.
Once he was finally alone, outside waiting for his taxi, Steve opened the folder to look at the sonogram, but this time he laid a hand on his belly, feeling both happiness mixed with sadness. He wanted to share this with Tony, but it seemed that the alpha wanted no part in this. That was ok, Steve resolved. Looking down at the sonogram as he stroked his belly, Steve promised his baby that even on his own he would be more than enough.
Tony’s eyes narrowed and he bit the inside of his lip, considering what had just been said. After a moment, though, he gave a curt nod. “Alright.”
“I just don’t understand, who’s Tiberius and why does Tony think he’s paying you?” Bucky asked, confused.
“Oh uh…” the omega stumbled, realizing he hadn’t actually figured out what he wanted, “I’ll have the Tom Ka Gai soup and a side of Thai spring rolls please.”
“Look, I’m glad that the two of you are back together, but there are some things I need you to know this time around.”
Steve just gave a bashful smile, turning away to hide the obvious tint in his fair skin. “Thanks Peter, I’m glad to be here. And I, uh, I think Tony and I will make a great match too.”
“You know, Carol, I genuinely wish sometimes you would just tell me what I want to hear as opposed to what you’re actually thinking,” Tony said, with a defeated look.
“I’ve had a name floating around my head for a while, but I didn’t really know what you’d think of it,” Steve answered.
“Hey, Tony, I’ve brough –” Pepper stopped, seeing the mug in Tony’s hand. “Coffee...I brought you coffee,” she finished, flatly.
“I know that’s what you’ve told him, but whether or not you’ll actually follow through with that is still up in the air.”
“Of course you were the football captain,” Tony muttered seemingly louder than he’d intended. Steve gave him a puzzled look, to which Tony responded to with an apologetic smile. “Sorry, continue.”
Steve returned the smile before turning to lead the way towards Empire Fulton Ferry. The walk was short, yet they seemed to fall into a fairly deep conversation already.
Since finding out he was pregnant, the omega felt like he was in some sort of a daze. Natasha helped him out to her car, and just held him as he cried for what felt like hours. After that, he asked her to take him home, and attempted to refuse her offer to stay with him a for as long as he needed.
Steve didn't know whether to feel embarrassed or amazed. He wanted Tony, there was no doubt about that, but if he’d learned anything in his nineteen years of living, it was that people who truly cherished the physical aspects of their relationship were few and far between.
Steve constantly spent time wondering what it meant every time Tony would pull him into a kiss, or lace their fingers together while they were alone. He wanted to believe that the alpha was falling for him just as hard as he had, but he knew better than to entertain that thought for too long. He didn’t know what this was between the two of them, but he did know that right now, it was enough.
As Tony sat at his desk for the next hour or so, waiting for lunch to roll around, he kept asking himself whether or not Pepper really did have anything to be worried about.
“Yeah, I...have too much snow out,” Steve internally cringed at how idiotic his response was. The confused smile on Tony's face didn't help any, either. Steve shook his head and tried again. “It seems like everything’s shut down, but I could have sworn the snow wasn't this bad an hour ago.”
“What the fuck did you just say?” Tony asked, narrowing his eyes. Before Steve had a chance to react, Tony grabbed him by the arms and shoved him against the wall. “What the
“I came as soon as I could, I need to apologize and explain myself,” Tony offered, sparing no time to take a breath until he got his message across.
This will be the last chapter for a few weeks. Read the end of the chapter notes for more information
“How may I help you?” The woman asked without looking up from what she was working on. Steve took a second to observe her desk and noticed a name plate:
He said before bolting out of the living room. As drunk as he was, Tony knew that not even the coldest shower would help fix this. Not only had he made out with Steve (which, oddly enough had been on his bucket list since he knew what kissing was), but Steve had kissed him back. There was no going back after this and Tony had no idea how to deal with that.
“I keep trying to tell you that you can’t just fall in love with some mut off the street and expect for them to treat you as anything more than a cash cow. We are Stark men, and we do not end up with just anyone. Your mother came from a prestigious family, and your future wife will too. So I don’t want to hear any more about you dating men, especially this Steve character. When you come home this summer, we’ll introduce you to some nice girls that are of our caliber.”
“Would you keep it down?!” Tony asked, jumping up to put a hand over Pepper’s mouth as he pulled her into his work space. He could tell by the look in her eyes that he would need to remove his hand very quickly if he wanted to actually keep it.
Tony leaned down, hovering over Steve’s chest, to whisper in his ear. “I wish you could see how fucking gorgeous you look on my dick. Your ass feels
“Yeah yeah, Mr. Muscles, great to see you too,” Tony croaked out, trying not to be crushed to death in his friend’s arms. “Enough with the pleasantries. Nat, how do I know you invited the right guy to this happy hour?”
“Look,” the brunet began, now somewhat past the point of annoyed, “Steve doesn’t know about my family or my money. I didn’t call you guys over here to question Steve’s motives, I called you over here to help me through the fact that I’m going to be a father soon.”
Tony wasn’t sure when it happened, but the next thing he remembered was Steve being upright. It was quite a sight, Steve bouncing on his dick, his (beyond perfect) cock bobbing along on Tony’s stomach as he slowly stroked himself, sweat drenched hair flopping in his face, eyes closed and mouth slightly open.
Tony used a ruler to carefully make a chart, filling in the days of the week while Cora colored next to him. When he was done making the boxes, he handed it to Coraline.
“Don’t worry, you’re not in trouble,” Coulson offered, seemingly reading Tony’s mind, “but I’ve seen the work you’ve done and spoken with some of your clients. Your turnaround time is extremely impressive, especially for a one man team who has a full time job. I really think you’d be able to change the game for our web team, and help this company offer something extraordinary to our clients.”
“Tony this is...this is absolutely amazing,” the omega praised, going in for a larger bite this time.
“Sprocket it is,” Tony said, smiling softly. As he turned to begin playing with the bot, Steve couldn’t shake the feeling he had in his chest. He knew in that very moment that he was falling for Tony. Steve knew he was doing the exact thing his friends warned him against, and even though he knew he was likely careening towards trouble, he simply just couldn’t find it in himself to care.
Steve didn’t let Tony finish the sentence, instead cutting him off by crashing their lips together. He loved Tony and he probably had since the moment he watched Tony hold his daughter for the first time. Now there was no Coraline. There was no teen dad and no group project and no ‘I need to pick up an extra shift, sorry for canceling date night again’. There was just Tony.
Rhodey seemed caught off guard by that, but smiled wide all the same. The rest of his friends moved through their introductions, and once everyone had met, Tony ushered them to the dining room. In front of them was an amazing spread of dinner.
The blond took in the faces of all of his friends, wondering what he’d be able to say to explain this to them.
He sat there in slight silence for a few minutes, initially worried, until he heard the mixing of a drink. At the sound of a glass being placed on the counter in front of him, Tony lifted his head, only enough to spot his drink and pull it towards him. He was almost positive he looked absolutely pitiful in this state but he couldn’t care less. He opened his mouth slightly to take in the straw sticking out of his glass. Tony took a sip of the drink, and upon the liquid hitting his tongue, his eyes went wide with delight.
“This is really good,” Tony spoke, mouth slightly full of fruits, only to look up and notice Steve’s sad look.
He didn't stick around long enough to see the wary look on Peter's face. As Tony walked back into the school, he held his head high, waiting for the moment his classroom door closed behind him. It was then that he let out a pained sob.
Sharing clothes with people he cared about wasn't out of the ordinary for Tony. Every so often, he’d find himself borrowing something or other from someone on the team. What
“Your feet would literally hang off the end unless you curled up in the world’s tightest fetal position” Tony observed.
The possible answers may have scared the shit out of Tony, but he'd be damned if he wasn't going to dig them up anyway.
protective of you. Plus, I probably would have done the same thing if some guy I didn’t know started dating my best friend.”
“Why are you doing this? I just want to drown my sorrows in some really awesome alcohol…preferably alone.”
“Yeah I...I dunno, I guess I’m just feeling a little nervous,” Steve spoke, getting back to the work at hand.
“I still can’t believe it. We get to be parents to the most amazing little girl this world has to offer. How did we get so lucky?” Steve asked, as Tony tucked him back into his hospital bed.
“She’s my favorite too, sweetie,” Tony laughed. “Now come with me and your dad, we’re gonna try on our Halloween costumes for everyone!”
“We’ll figure this out, ok? We can take things slow and just figure it all out as we go,” Tony offered, rubbing the shorter man’s cheek with his thumb.
“Why? I mean, Nat told me you scored the highest out of anyone else in your certification course. You seem to know your shit inside and out, so really, you’ll be fine.”
The anticipation of the look on Tony’s face when he saw him in that shirt was enough to have Steve buzzing on his way to the party. What he hadn’t expected, though, was what he saw the moment he walked into the club. His friends stood huddled together at their table, and as if they were in a scene from a movie, everyone slowly parted ways to show Jan standing next to Tony. Jan looked radiant, as always, but Tony stood wearing a tightly fit, sheer, pink lace button down with slim fit dark blue slacks. Even in the dimly lit club, Steve could see every single detail of Tony’s torso through the fabric of his top and to say he looked stunning would have been an understatement. He looked downright
“We’re here to see you off, or to help you pack or something, I don’t know,” Bucky said, opening up a bag of chips that definitely didn’t belong to him. “Either way, we’re here and we’re reminding you to take some rubbers.”
“Yeah. But… Steve was sure that we were destined to break up so he just decided to end it now. Is there something inherently wrong about me that makes me unlovable?”
Steve woke up the next day feeling conflicted. He was all too pleased that his friends liked Tony, but something had been nagging at him. When he’d first told Natasha about his feelings for Tony, she’d told him to talk to Bucky about this. For the life of him, Steve couldn't figure out why she had told him to do so, but he figured now might be a good time to figure it out.
we’re talking about. You can keep buying all the gifts you want but none of that will mean anything, especially not to Cora, once you’re gone.”
Once on the ice, Tony let out a small squawk as his foot slipped. Steve caught him immediately and smiled “Oh this is gonna be too much fun.”
He seemed genuinely excited once he realized that they would be watching The Nightmare Before Christmas, but twenty minutes into the movie, Steve was knocked out and laying with his head resting in the brunet’s lap. Tony had long since stopped paying attention to the movie, in favor of continuing to look at the sonogram. The more he looked at it, the more surreal it all seemed. Looking down at the image in his hand, he slowly began to focus on Steve. He stroked his hand through the blond head of hair, eventually moving to stroke the man’s arm, and finally resting his hand on the omega’s belly.
Peter stood towards the back of the classroom, quietly organizing worksheets for tomorrow’s classes, when there was a knock on the door.
The two sat down on the patio steps, relishing in the crisp fall air, before Tony let out a deep breath.
Steve just smiled and rolled his eyes. He couldn’t help but feel thankful that he had such amazing people in his life that wanted him to be happy. He was nervous for his friends to meet Tony, but he had no doubt that it wouldn’t take long for him to win them over.
“You’ve known the whole time, and that didn’t impact the way you treated me or what you thought of me?”
“I get it. Thanks for your concern. But…” Tony sighed. He was really about to do this. “But I want to be a part of your life and your life comes with Cora.”
Natasha looked at Tony, clearly trying to size him up and see if he was being truthful. He assumed she found his answer to be sufficient enough, because she finally gave him a sincere smile.
Great. Now he was stuck, all alone, with his boyfriend’s daughter and her poop-filled diaper with no clue how to change it. He could do this. He just kept telling himself that over and over as he slowly approached Cora. After gagging three times before he was even within two feet of the baby, Tony realized quickly that he could not, in fact, do this at all.
Steve moved with lightning speed, feeling his face warm as he folded his arms on the counter and rested his head atop of them. Rimming was a relatively new addition to their sex life. Steve had made mention of the fact that it had always intrigued him, but he never felt comfortable broaching the topic with partners before or during the war. Tony had been so kind and caring the first time they tried it and Steve had such a wonderful time. Now, Tony would offer to eat Steve out any time he wanted to really show his appreciation for his boyfriend.
“No, I’m fine...really. Thanks, though. How bout we go inside?” Steve asked, stepping out of the car.
“To the hospital? Why? Bruce...Bruce! Will you tell me what’s going on?” Tony asked, grabbing the beta’s arm to stop him.
This was a feeling that Tony wasn’t used to, but after a beat he realized just what it was. It had been a long time since he’d been nervous meeting people, and felt anxious for people to like him, specifically because the opinion of those people meant something to one person in particular. He’d wanted Steve’s friends to like him...because he wanted
“Was there anything in particular you wanted to talk about?” Tony asked, turning to face Pepper, with a glass in hand.
The two of them made their way to Steve’s car in his apartment garage. Natasha requested the keys, as she was the only one who knew where they were going, and Steve obliged. They drove in silence for a good twenty minutes before Natasha parked in a public lot, surrounded by various shops.
Tony was way past drunk, which meant he couldn’t care less that his Captain America fanboy was showing.
Steve deflated. “I don’t want to,” he admitted. “It’s just that… I trusted you. I bared my soul, so to speak. We were… I told you everything and now I don’t know how much of what you’ve told me is a lie and--”
In all of Tony’s years on this earth, he’d never experienced this before. He had never had someone in his life, who was even remotely interested in him romantically, who wasn’t also very interested in his name and his money. He had gotten so used to the idea that he wouldn’t ever find someone that didn’t see him as a bank account, that now it seemed almost impossible. But as unbelievable as it seemed, here was Steve, perfect as always, letting Tony know that he could care less who his father was or how many buildings his name was on. All that matter to him was the alpha himself, and what do you know? Wasn’t that just the most heartwarming realization.
“So...I was thinking maybe we could watch a movie,” Tony spoke, not entirely sure if Steve would even be interested in staying later.
“Coraline, sweetheart, they just aren’t the kind of shoes that you need. You need sneakers you can run around in and play with all the other kids at daycare.”
Steve was still trying to express his wants and needs, when it came to sex, with confidence. Before going into the ice, Steve didn’t have much opportunity to ask for anything too specific. Any sexual encounters, especially with men, were quick and discreet. Steve had had just enough time to determine what he liked but not enough time to feel comfortable voicing his desires. At least, not until he met Tony. Speaking up in bed was still hard, but so worth it when Steve knew the man he loved would stop at nothing to give him what he needed.
Despite the day ending on a positive note, Steve had a sour feeling in his stomach about it all. He wanted so badly to forget about what his friends had said, but their words kept floating through his head. He was falling too fast, for someone he wasn’t even sure was into him in the first place. As he walked to the subway, Steve felt his phone vibrate. His stomach twisted in knots once he saw it was a text from Tony.
“That home, the one with my parents? Nowhere I want to be. My real home is here, with you and Cora and my friends. I don’t want to leave any of you, but my dad’s an insistent asshole who always seems to get his way no matter what.”
He gave a small laugh at that, genuinely appreciating how ridiculous Carol was on a daily basis. Steve looked out the window, admiring the buildings and the people, a view that seemingly never got old. As the cab came to a stop at a red light, Steve decided to browse the web on his phone to look for some nursery ideas before brunch. Once the cab began to move again, Steve looked up just in time to see the car before it slammed into them.
As Tony began talking about the ridiculous interaction he’d had at the coffee shop on his way into work, Steve couldn’t help but think just how crazy the last week of his life had been. Being thrust into a new career was one thing, becoming part of a new friend group was another. But getting to know
“Well why don’t we work on getting it so you’re ready for big girl undies again?” The two year old grinned. “I left some craft supplies out in the hall. How about I go get them and we can make a potty chart together, okay?”
Tony’s heart was pounding and his blood was boiling and every breath was shallow. All he wanted was to kiss Steve like he used to kiss Steve, but instead he was met with a kiss that was rough, a blur of teeth and tongues, sloppy and uncoordinated. It was nice, but it wasn’t a Steve kiss.
Tony tried to sit there as silently as possible while the families answered obscure questions, but it was only a matter of minutes before he was yelling at the TV.
“Peter and I usually get burgers after Robotics team then I give him a ride home. You’re welcome to come along with us, if you’re free.”
Tony let those words sink in for a moment. He had been trying for what felt like so long to pretend to be strong, but as if a switch had been flipped, he crumbled, and fell into Pepper’s arms.
After that first happy hour with their friends, Steve practically ran home, itching to draw his new colleague. He drew solely based on memory alone, now knowing that any images he’d seen before weren’t to be trusted as reference. How could they be? Now that he knew what it was like to witness such an untamable beauty in person, he knew there was no way anything could ever capture anything less than a dull imitation of the real thing. Even so, he tried his best, spending hours trying to get his drawing just right. In the end he settled for his imperfect rendition, but promised himself he’d work to one day at least come close to capturing the magnificence of Tony Stark on paper.
It only took a few minutes on that road for Tony to realize he'd started holding his breath at some point. He took the opportunity to exhale slowly in an attempt to calm his nerves. It had been a long time since anyone had made Tony feel this way, all butterflies and nerves and giddiness, but he'd be lying if he said he didn't love it. Everything in life as both Iron Man and the owner of Stark Industries was always so serious (though lord knows Tony tried to make both less so). There was rarely anything in Tony’s day to day life that gave him the chance to truly experience something so exciting, terrifying, boundless and new...until Steve. Tony had no clue how long any of this would last, but he wanted to hold onto this feeling for as long as the world would let him.
With that, Tony slowly slid the waistband of Steve’s boxer-briefs down until his cock was uncovered, pressed against his belly, flushed red.
“Love you too, Tony,” Steve offered, giving the brunet a kiss on the forehead. “Now, I don’t know about you, but I’m beat. Ready for bed?” Steve asked.
He wanted to protest but his own mouth began moving faster than his brain could keep up with. “I just don’t know that the devilishly handsome man who whisked me away for the weekend won’t try to take advantage of this situation.”
“Just because I left doesn’t mean I don’t still talk to my friends over there. Word got back to me pretty quickly, actually, but I was waiting for you to fix it up yourself. But now that we’ve gotten all of that out of the way, can I say hi to Cora, or is it too early?” Peggy asked, clearly excited for the chance to see her daughter.
Once he put Cora to sleep, Steve planned to just lay on the couch and watch some of his favorite shows. Halfway into an episode of
“Look, you know by now that Tony's told us about the baby. Now that everyone else knows, I figured it'd be a good time to talk to you about everything."
“You get this look on your face every time you talk about him. Your eyes light up and your smile softens and your whole being just seems brighter. Even when you’re worried, talking about something that’s hard for you, it’s still obvious to see that you’re talking about him.”
“Well, we were already in the neighborhood, but once we got a text from Pepper about how real the struggle was for you here, we decided to stop by to give you a hand,” Natasha offered.
“So what, are we just supposed to meet tomorrow to put everything together?” Tony frantically searched his backpack for his philosophy notebook while trying to start up his laptop.
“Coraline, shh,” Steve tried, getting on the floor with his daughter. She just pushed at him and continued screaming. “Honey, you have to calm down.”
It took him about a week and a half to actually tell Steve that he’d have to cancel on all of the plans they had made, thanks to his family. Steve tried to be understanding, but Tony could tell that this was wearing him thin.
“Stevie? That's fine don't even worry about it. I think you’re totally cute so it’s fine,” Tony replied, pulling Steve closer to him to snuggle into before letting sleep take him fully.
“Yeah, I could tell,” Steve said, looking down at Tony with concern. “Look Tony, I want us to be able to move past all of this. We’ve got a very serious conversation that we need to have some time in the very near future, but for tonight, I just want us to get back to how things were. Can we do that?”
“What can I start you guys off with today?” Steve asked, seemingly tired, but still as friendly as ever.
“Truthfully, Tony, I just wanted the code to work off of so Viastone could sell AI as a service to the military. But I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to fuck with you a little, so here we are!”
Tony repositioned himself slightly and with every thrust he hit Steve’s prostate, dead on. The omega knew he wouldn’t be able to last much longer, but he refused to come without Tony’s knot buried inside of him. Steve knew just what to do to make that happen.
Steve silently cursed the fact that Natasha knew everything about him and his life, thanks to her relationship with Bucky. He had no real excuse to get himself out of this and she knew that. He wanted to protest, when a thought hit him. “Did you say
“Well,” Bucky began, looking directly at his best friend, “I think we’ve got the perfect person in mind.”
“Well, I only found out today that I needed another teacher to help out if we plan to do any of the out of town tournaments.” Tony replied, praying that the conversation would just end there.
“Hello, Mr. Rogers,” Steve heard a voice coming from seemingly nowhere. He looked around, startled, and heard a laugh come from Hogan as the elevator doors closed. “Sir has asked me to bring you down to the workshop,” the voice continued.
. He came back from being held captive in Afghanistan, surviving being put through a makeshift heart surgery and upon returning, his biggest concern was transitioning into a company that helped people instead of hurting them. Once he’d done that, he just randomly decided to help mold the young minds of tomorrow. It was clear that Tony made light of it all, because he didn’t want to focus on how truly amazing it was of him to make these sacrifices to help improve the lives of others. Steve couldn’t let such a wonderful act go without praise.
Steve saw himself to the guest room, trying not to be too obvious as he took everything in. The apartment was
“I was really just going to go home to hang out with my dog more than anybody else in my family, so I could stay...but I really love my dog so…” Clint explained, slowly realizing that he had possibly made a mistake in saying anything at all.
Steve’s brain was short circuiting; he didn’t know what to say or do now. He’d had no clue that the team had picked up on whatever was going on between him and Tony. It pained Steve to think that their kids had been rooting for them all along, only for things to go by the wayside.
“Are you just gunna stand there lookin’ pretty or are you gunna come on in?” Natasha asked, now standing at the front door.
Steve considered the question for a moment. He slowly placed a hand on his belly, a gesture he had started doing when nervous or unsure.
“Bold of you to assume I wouldn’t find a way to become superintendent of this entire district just to have the ability to dock your pay,” Tony said, taking a seat on the arm of Steve’s chair.
“Is everything alright?” Tony asked, seemingly waking up instantly. It was 7 AM, back on the East Coast, and though Steve had no idea Tony was in California, he knows Steve wouldn’t call so early if it weren’t important.
“Well, I’m glad you put us all out of our misery before I could offer to buy the hotel just to fix the booking issue,” Tony replied, softly.
Before they could plan anything, though, Steve needed to figure out why he’d been so sick lately. As promised, when he got home the day before, he’d called his doctor, and thankfully he was able to get an appointment for the following day. Once he’d told Natasha about the appointment, she refused to let him go alone, which Steve found odd yet not out of character for the red head.
Tony cleared his throat before pointing to the building they were approaching. “Looks like we’re here,” he said, stating the obvious.
“You’re sure he’s okay with it?” Sam asked, looking around the table and sharing a concerned look with the rest of the group.
that Steve had become enamored with. The pair stood silently enjoying the beautiful song. Tony felt his heart pounding a mile a minute, distantly wondering if this much stress was bad for the arc reactor, as he waited for the biggest surprise of all.
Steve tried to remind himself to breathe. Between the sight in front of him and the song playing overhead, he thought he might actually faint. Almost as if on cue, Tony looked up and gave a smile that nearly turned Steve’s legs to jello.
“Tony...you haven't left the penthouse in three weeks. There are people out there who think you’re dead and SI just hasn't managed to figure out how to break the news to the outlets.”
Steve drew in a ragged breath. Tony had never man-handled him like this before, and though he wished he didn’t, Steve liked it.
“Well, now that you’re here, I wanted to ask if you had a chance to look over any of the stuff I sent you?” Tony asked.
“It’s been so hard to just go on like everything’s alright, and I just...really miss having you around to make everything less terrible.”
They each set off their poppers, Steve and Tony had an honorary New Years kiss (it was only nine o’clock; there would probably be a
“Well, Tiberius, you see, this was what I called you here to talk about. The AI code that you had my employee steal for you, just so happened to have a failsafe built into it. Basically anything that runs this code automatically has JARVIS on it. Once he’s got enough time to connect to those systems, JARVIS is able to run everything that implements that code...meaning
“You’re the CEO of Stark Industries; you’re Tony’s friend,” Steve said, knowing full well that didn’t come close to describing who Pepper was to Tony. She was his right hand, his soulmate, she was everything to him. That she was meeting him for the first time in his home, after everything that’s happened, scared the shit out of Steve.
“I thought you might appreciate hearing your favorite version of this song, so I figured why not invite the artist to sing it live,” Tony answered, hoping that his voice didn’t sound as nervous as he felt.
“Ahh, dear sweet Happy, that, my friend is where you’re wrong,” Tony spoke, sitting up against the headboard, “I don't
concerned with how he looked, but it was important that he managed to look as close to perfect without looking like he tried too hard. He was on his way to Nat and Bucky’s for a little engagement celebration on the rooftop terrace at their apartment. Any other time, this would barely be cause for concern, but tonight Tony would be there and they’d agreed to go
Pepper took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever horrors lay behind the door. If everything Rhodey was saying was true, she was about to walk in and see a human disaster.
“No!” Tony gasped, then continued to squirm when Steve started tickling him again. “I-it’s not funny!”
“Steve, look, I don’t care. I don’t mean about the situation as a whole, I mean about you liking a man. It’s less of a deal than you think it is, honestly. I happen to think every guy we hang out with is attractive. As a matter of fact there was a point in time when I even had feelings for you.”
“So, let me get this straight, you’ve done nothing but bicker with this guy for three solid years, and now you’ve invited him to your Halloween party? Why?” Rhodey asked, not bothering to look away from his work.
She stretched, giving a small yawn, and reached out to wrap her tiny fingers around Steve’s pinky. The omega turned to look at Tony, with a look of nothing but love and awe behind his teary blue eyes.
“You weren’t answering any of Nat’s calls or texts. We weren’t sure if you were okay,” Bucky said, using his flesh and blood hand to scratch above the elbow of his metal arm.
“How do you think I survived being allergic to practically everything but air? I’m more stubborn than a tree stump so you better get ready. Cause I’m not giving up on this.”
Clint and Natasha shared a look between them before turning to avoid Steve’s eyes. It hadn’t occurred to him that things between their friends would end up being
,” Tony said, moving away to sit on the couch. Steve just smiled, shaking his head and went back to the kitchen table to finish his work.
“Because sex is not love. There is a distinctive difference between love and lust and Steve is more than just some guy I want to fuck. He is important to me.”
Tony sat there with him, until his breathing became slower and more even. He pulled out his phone to check on the messages he had been ignoring throughout the day. Most all of them were just from their group of friends wishing both Steve and Mason a speedy recovery. But there was a lengthy text from Natasha, telling Tony that she and Bucky were on their way to relieve him of his duties.
Tony took a deep breath once he finished his story. Pepper seemed to consider his words carefully before diving in.
The two looked at each other for a moment, before breaking off into laughter. Steve took the time to look at the man beside him, and felt a strange surge of affection when he noticed the way Tony’s nose crinkled when he laughed. Steve looked away almost immediately for fear of being caught staring.
With all that said, most alphas and omegas could coexist peacefully, with the exception of Tony and Steve. More often than not, people just assumed that Tony was adamant on asserting his dominance, while Steve was adamant on asserting his position as an equal. Neither ever wanted to budge on their ideas, and it always came down to their team pleading with them to agree to compromise. It was a tough way to work, but together, Steve and Tony created some of the most amazing graphic design concepts their clients had ever seen.
“Lemon water and a coke.” He refused to look at the waiter whose voice sounded painfully like Steve’s. Wonderful, he’d progressed to full on hallucinations.
Steve gave a look as if to say he was sorry to hear about these circumstances, but Tony waved him off.
As he looked up from his phone, Tony saw Steve slowly walking over. The feeling that he felt was much like what he’d experienced the first time he’d seen the blond in class the year before. He felt the need to sit up taller, puff out his chest, and plaster on the cockiest grin he could to hide the fact that he’d never been so unsure of himself in his entire life.
Steve reached out his hand to shake, never once letting his smile falter, even though he knew she was sizing him up.
Truth be told, for all the confidence and bravado Steve had over the weekend, it was really settling on him that he’d no longer have Tony in his life, and it hurt. But as badly as it hurt, Steve would be okay; he kept telling himself as much, anyway. Maybe, just maybe, if he said it enough then he’d be able to believe it.
The whole thing seemed so far fetched at the time. Steve sent over his resume, fully expecting for this to be a fruitless effort. To his surprise, though, he’d received a call for an interview not even a full two weeks later. Though he didn’t have much experience, they were able to offer him a teaching assistant position that would eventually lead to a teaching position. The hiring process had been such a whirlwind, he never really had the time to stop and think about how nervous he truly was to be
“Well when you put it like that, I suppose the answer would be never,” Tony answered in a small voice. Deep down, he knew that he deserved everything he was getting from Pepper. “And I don’t sound like that. Never have I ever said ‘hurr hurr hurr’.”
Pepper was straddling Tony as he sat in his chair. She had come down to the lab in an attempt to take Tony’s mind off of everything with Loki and rebuilding
The reality of the situation began to weigh on Tony as he clutched the arc reactor a little tighter.
“Oh god, Tony. Did you buy us a penthouse apartment that looks over the city or something?” Steve joked. Tony bowed his head. “Holy fuck, Tony. You bought us a penthouse apartment that looks over the city.”
This was a scene right out of Tony’s worst nightmare. Howard stood right in front of him as he held the apartment door open.
“Couldn’t help but notice I’m not the only one who came up for air only to notice a blizzard’s moved in out there.”
Steve knew that with any other alpha, those words would have been met with anger, but Tony wasn't like any other alpha. On the surface, he looked to be a small alpha with a smooth face and thin frame, but underneath it all was an abundance of wiry muscle capable of lifting and building some of the most intricate machines known to man. Tony didn't fit the conventional idea of what an alpha looked like, but that's part of what drew Steve to him. He was unapologetically confident in his appearance, which was sexy as hell. That kind of confidence was a quality Steve wished he had for himself. Despite always being told that he had the ideal physique for an omega, he always felt self conscious about his petite frame. To look at them, he and Tony made quite an interesting couple, but Steve wouldn’t change a thing about them for anything.
“So you’re coming up on four months now, and I read that that’s around the time that you can find out what Bug will be. Would you maybe be interested in doing that?”
“We just want to make sure that you’re not moving too fast...again,” Sam began, treading lightly. “You know, like with Sharon…”
Peter nodded, considering Steve’s words but ultimately gave a small smile. “Okay, good. You and Mr. Stark are everyone’s favorite couple so the rest of the team will be glad to hear this. Plus, we’re all excited to have you back as our assistant coach next season!”
He tried his best to adhere to her advice, but Tony just couldn’t find a way to slow his breathing. Rhodey came back with the water, and after putting the glass on the table, he began to rub his hand up and down the alpha’s back. He closed his eyes then, and focused solely on getting his breathing under control. After a few minutes Tony was able to get a handle on things and his panic attack subsided. He reached a shaky hand out to grab the glass of water and took a huge gulp of it, as his friends looked on.
As he rode up the elevator to Steve’s floor, the nerves finally hit. Tony had been operating off of alcohol induced courage for some part of the night, but the more he sobered up the more he questioned his actions. The second the elevator doors opened, a scent wafted towards Tony immediately grabbing all of his attention. The scent was heavy, yet somehow sweet. The alpha had no clue what he was smelling, but he knew he needed to get to whatever it was, fast.
“Oh, I just...you guys seem like a lot of fun. I’m excited to get to know the other teachers here,” Steve answered, honestly.
“You never needed permission to do whatever you wanted before, I figured today would be no different. But if you need the invitation, then come on in,” Tony said, gesturing towards the armchairs in the far left corner of his office.
Pepper looked at him in utter disbelief. When she realized he wasn’t joking, she threw her arms up in the air in defeat.
“Then why didn’t you just take me out to dinner for Valentine’s day? Why did you rent out a fucking aquarium to have penguins tell me they love me and fuck against a fish tank? Why did you get me a paint set that is worth more than I make in two weeks? Why do you do these grand things, Anthony Edward Stark? Isn’t loving someone enough?”
“Oh haha Tony, you don’t have much room to judge. Your ‘music’ sounds like a cat being mauled by a lawn mower.”
“So here we have an IPod. It holds all your music so you can take it everywhere you go. Though I doubt you really need to take ‘Brother Can You Spare a Dime’ with you outside of this house.”
“Yeah. I mean I want to hear about all your friends, but this one is new, so I’ve got a lot to learn about him.”
“There are a lot of guys here, you’re going to need to be a tad bit more specific,” Clint said around a laugh.
“Well hello to you too, Rhodey,” Tony responded, spinning around to watch his friend walk into the workshop.
“Both, I think. She never acted like this before, so I’ve either got to believe it has to do with all of these life changes or that the terrible twos are a real thing and they’re hitting her, hard. But I just…” Steve trailed off, thinking back on his exchange with Cora earlier, feeling tears well up in his eyes.
Steve suddenly grew impossibly more frantic at that last statement. They were talking about taking his baby, they were talking about taking Mason. Steve was six and a half months pregnant, barely just 27 weeks along. He wasn’t ready...she wasn’t ready. He began to wonder if something had happened to Mason during the accident. He wanted to move, to place his hand over his belly in an attempt to make sure she was ok, quickly being reminded that he didn’t actually have any control over his body at the moment. Steve felt his heart begin to break, then. All that mattered to him in the world was his daughter, and the thought that he hadn’t been able to keep her safe, the one thing he had been tasked with doing, was too much.
“I swear to god, if it weren’t for the fact that this food is life changingly delicious, I wouldn’t be sitting here listening to this crap.”
Once he’d gotten himself together, Steve went out to see what section he’d been assigned for the day. He walked out to his first table and immediately noticed the patron hiding behind a menu. Steve had seen some strange things since he’d started working there, but this was a new one. He just put on his best smile, and made his way over.
“She’s absolutely amazing,” Steve spoke through tears, gloved hand outstretched to touch any part of Mason in her incubator that he could access.
“Okay,” Tony said, rolling on a condom and slicking his cock, he lined himself up against Steve. Steve reached forward, linking his fingers with Tony.
“Rhodey told me that you still have yet to tell Steve about your family,” Tony groaned instantly. He told Rhodey, in confidence, about the little spat that he and Steve had over his Valentine’s day gift. He should have known better that somehow it’d get back to Pepper that he wasn’t being one hundred percent truthful with his boyfriend.
Tony stood there, soaking wet, breathing heavily. He looked up at the blond, with determination in his eye.
Tony had been planning for this day for weeks now. He had thought out each and every single moment of the day, in hopes that he could make this all perfect for Steve.
“No, it’s fine, really,” Tony declined. “Enough about me and my weekend. How’ve your trips been? Anything happening with the company that I should be aware of?”
“I always love throwing these types of parties, mainly because it’s so nice having the house full of people, but it’s a lot to deal with.”
“All better,” Tony grinned. “Now c’mon. I ended up in the snowbank, too. It’s gonna be just as much fun to get my pants off.” Steve didn’t hurt himself in the process, which he counted as a win, but he didn’t get a chance to appreciate his victory, as Tony was suddenly on top of him, kissing him, hands everywhere.
Steve wasn’t sure how to respond, but he felt the overwhelming urge to defend himself. “Well, though I don’t have experience working as a teacher, I truly believe that my time in the Army as well as my degree in Physical Education —”
“Tony… you don’t just ‘pull some strings’ to have someone reserve the whole aquarium for you. How did you get them to let us do this?” Steve asked, warily following Tony inside. The brunet just stopped in his tracks, turned and placed both hands on Steve’s shoulders. “Babe, I need you to trust me, but I also need you to not worry. This is my surprise to you for today so just relax and enjoy it, okay?”
“In AA they say that the first drink gets you drunk. Once I start I don’t know if I’ll be able to stop.  I… want to. Fuck, I want to so badly. I don’t want to be a buzzkill but—”
“Fuck off, Tony. You want to stand there and pretend that you’re doing this as some kind of self-sacrificing act. As if you’re doing me a favor by letting go of whatever...this was, when in reality, you’re just a coward.”
They made their way through several exhibits, stopping to see the sharks and pet the stingrays as they swam by, watching the seals play, and seeing all the exotic Amazon rainforest animals. Once they made it to the penguin habitat, Tony stopped.
Tony let out a huge breath once he was alone. He was blessedly, finally rid of Tiberius Stone, and though it felt good knowing he was free of that asshole, that realization only brought on a heavier one with it. Now that he’d fixed the AI issue, he had to work on sorting things out with Steve. Tony silently wished he had a failsafe for this monumental fuck up, as he settled into his desk chair, gearing up for a long night of figuring out how to fix the mess he had caused.
With that, Steve began telling his mother all about Tony. He talked about the rest of his friends as much as he could, but Sarah seemed to be the most interested in Tony, which Steve really didn’t mind. When their time came to an end, they walked back to Sarah’s building, a comfortable silence filling the air. Once at her apartment, Steve helped his mom out of her chair. They made quick work of their goodbyes, as Sarah had become extremely tired, and Steve wanted to get started on the drive home at a good time. He promised to be back as soon as he could, while hugging Sarah goodbye, to which she replied to tell all of his friends, especially Tony, that she said hello.
Steve recognized the voice as Tony’s but still jumped upon hearing it. “Oh...uh, I…” Steve stammered, feeling his cheeks burning.
“Yeah, actually. I mean, obviously most kids our age wouldn’t think twice about running from a situation like this, but I’m a Stark, and I don’t run from anything, so, you know, this kind of thing is right up my alley.”
Tony paused, thinking back on that night, now realizing how ridiculous his plan had been. He sighed as he ran a hand over his face and through his hair before continuing.
As the videos came up, Steve began explaining in great detail where the team’s performance was lacking and how they could have improved. With every new observation and critique, Tony’s mind got farther and farther away from thoughts of the robotics team. As he watched Steve’s whole being light up with excitement at analyzing the teams approach to each match, he realized that he was falling for the TA and only one thought came to mind.
“Steve, are you sure? We don't have to right now if you aren't ready,” Tony offered, trying not to sound condescending.
“You’re delusional if you think this is nothing like what happened back then,” Bruce responded. “we were never meant to be, that’s why it was so easy for us to let things die down, you know that as well as I do. But this...Tony, Steve was worth fighting for. He still is worth fighting for.”
“I just feel like you want me to put the effort into boozing you up so I can find out all your deep dark secrets. Is that what this is?! Are we trading booze for secrets, because I am all about that!” Steve joked.
“You come here and immediately start attacking me, making all of your accusations,” Howard began, “but what I want to know, what I want to ask is why you didn’t think it important enough to tell me that I’m going to be a grandfather.”
Before he made it to the entrance of the apartment building, he called Happy for a ride. When his driver showed up, he quickly stepped into the back of the car.
