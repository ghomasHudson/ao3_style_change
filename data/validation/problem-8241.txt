“I told you to go,” Steve tells her.
“I love you, too.”
When Tony doesn’t get an immediate response he snaps his head up and glances at his son. He doesn’t miss the hurt expression on his son’s face and the tears that have gathered in his eyes.
Tony carefully lowers himself down beside Steve, reaching out to take his bloodied hand to inspect the damage. The cut isn’t very deep and there was no doubt that the serum would come through and heal it, but it’s still difficult to see Steve hurt. Both physically and emotionally.
“Do you think she remembers?” Steve asks.
He’s finally granted a break and he drops his head down, heavy pants leaving his lips as he tries to regain his breathing. The nurse is the one encouraging him now, no doubt providing a distraction from the doctor between his legs. Her gloved fingers are exploring his sensitive entrance, forcing a whine to escape him.
Rhodey speaks like its pure fact. Uncontestable and known by the entire universe. He’s completely unphased by Tony’s story. Though Tony’s not sure whether he should be warmed by the fact that Rhodey knows him so well he’s not shocked anymore. Or pathetic
if you wanna keep in contact follow me on twitter @jupiterkissed ^_^ !
It’s pure perfection. It’s romanticism in color. It’s…frankly it’s a really beautiful set up and Tony’s fully convinced he must be a romantic at heart deep down under all his trauma and commitment issues because the set up looks like everything came straight from a Disney movie.
He smiles instead. Because he’s so good at crafting masks to hide the hurt. And pats Steve on the shoulder. “You’re a hell of a catch man. And so is Sharon. She’s going to love it. Which by the way, where is she?”
call me.”
At least with Rhodey, he gave it to him straight but without all the lingering. And all Tony was looking for was someone to reaffirm that he was being stupid and then call it a day. Which Rhodey did, multiple times during their Mortal Kombat Tournament that Tony was horribly losing.
Tony scowls, the kick making his leg burn but nothing more. “I preferred Mr. Genius Mechanic Inventor,” Tony sniffs.
“Wow, you clean up well. New suit?” Tony says once he can get his mouth working again.
“Your hands are so soft, man. What sort of lotion do you use…?”
“Are you talking to yourself?”
“Holy fuck you are nervous. Making global warming jokes before your big night?” Tony laughs and debates, for a split second. Before moving. He steps into Steve’s space. He’s holding flowers-a big old bouquet of
It’s on the tip of his tongue to be snarky. Last time they met Tony, in a small act of rebellion, wore tight leather pants and a tank top featuring a random rock band on the front. Completely clashing with Howard’s three piece business suit. The internet had a field day about it. Someone captured the moment and plastered it all over Twitter.
can fix it.”
Rhodey raises an eyebrow, “Bath and Body works, yo. Shea butter all the way.”
Tony takes his time to
Tony can’t breathe. But he forces himself to. Fixes his face and forces out a laugh. “Fuck, Steve. You’re so old fashioned sometimes I forget you’re only a few months younger than me. I… a ring.
“I’ve been thinking about it for months now. And tonight seems like the best night to do it. We’ll be graduating in the next two years and I know I can’t predict the future and that we’re young but when I’m with Sharon it’s… Tony. I can’t even describe it but it feels right. Good. I want to keep that, keep going for that, for however long I can.” Steve faces sets in a way that piledrives the ache forming in Tony’s chest a little deeper.
Five days after.
(See the end of the chapter for
disappoint me, Anthony.”
She spots them over by the table. Her eyes wide and taking everything in as she walks over towards them. She stands, with one hand on her hip and flashes the boys a knowing smirk. “Tony, long time no see. Are you joining us for our date?”
“No,” Tony smiles tightly. “Steve won’t let me. Says it’s a special night for two.” he leans forward and presses a kiss to her cheek. “You look amazing by the way. A real dime piece! Do they say dime piece anymore. I heard it in a song once and thought it was making a comeback.”
funny to me?” Rhodey jokes.
Tony’s going to hurl. He feels bile rising up in his throat as he keeps checking his phone. It’s almost 8 pm and Steve isn’t here yet. Nor is Sharon. Everything is set up perfectly. The garden looks immaculate. All the servers and their host for the evening are dressed to the nine. The live band is playing a jazzy rendition of
“Feels like it. With increasing temperatures across the globe and the polar ice caps melting.”
“Mr. Genius Mechanic Inventor can’t work his way around a joystick? Why is that
But it was worth it .
He had to stop a few times in his planning to take a shot of scotch. So he had something to burn off the rising edging of patheticness that kept crawling up the back of his neck. Now, buzzed to kingdom come and playing Uno with his latest creation-a robot with one functioning arm, he wondered, not for the first time why he was
He cuts the call on that note. Leaving Tony feeling scraped out. “
His voice feels raw. And suddenly his eyes burn. He feels Rhodey’s eyes on him and it makes everything a little more worse-a little more raw. So he focuses his gaze somewhere else until he feels Rhodey’s hand on his. He glances down, where their fingers connect. Rhodey’s not saying anything but the gentle squeeze he gives Tony speaks volumes. Tony nods his head slowly, top lip caught between his teeth. They sit like that for a while before Tony breaks the silence.
Steve raises an eyebrow but doesn’t comment when Tony takes the petal from his blazer.
“Fuck... I gotta invest.”
He’d give himself a pat on the back if the situation wasn’t so laughable.
“Sitting around doing nothing? Unbelievable…” Howard, even on the LED screen, manages to showcase his overwhelming disappointment in Tony loud and clear. “I’ll keep this call brief. Wednesday we’re meeting for Lunch at the usual spot. Don’t be late. And dress appropriately this time.”
Three weeks.

Instead, he nods. “Yeah, okay. Sounds good, Dad.”
like Tony Stark-better. Which, now that Tony thinks about it, is probably...very unhealthy.
“I hate the controls for this game!” Tony complains. “When I drop my video game the first thing to go is this stupid joystick.”
“Really? Wow… Tony, thank you. You didn’t have to do all this.” Sharon says.
this definitely ended up a little differently than anticipated , but i like how it ended. next chapter? will be a little messy and most likely a bit longer so stay tuned !
“-No thanks.” Rhodey cuts Tony right off. “Seriously, you’ve already thought about this anniversary. You’ve already made the plans and probably all the calls before you got here. You don’t want to be stopped. You want to keep hitting at a cement wall hoping it’ll break but all you’re doing is banging up your fists and feigning shock when you see cuts and bruises on them. That’s not my problem. It’s

at the same time. He could never find warmth in his father’s eyes-no matter how deep or long he looked for them.
No he really didn’t have. And he really needs to dip. “What are best friends for? Exploiting the bank account of their rich best friend, that’s the answer. No worries, it was a pleasure. Now… I leave you too. Goodnight and
“What took you so long to answer?”
Steve blushes. “Yeah. Bucky helped me pick it out. Said I couldn’t do Sharon a disservice by wearing the same old monkey suit I’ve had for years. Thank you.”
It’s so
Steve made long nights suffering over work, easier. Steve made moments where Tony doubted himself and his worth, manageable. Steve made
for romance these days. According to Pinterest at least. The night would be perfect. Everything and anything they could want to make the night special would be there. All orchestrated by Tony’s greasy hands.
He could have anyone he wanted, irony aside. But something about Steve kept pulling him back. Maybe it was the fact that he
so unobtainable. A prize Tony could never get no matter how many tricks out of his sleeve he pulled. It was aggravating as it was exhilarating. He really did feel incredible whenever he was around Steve. No one could get Tony mad in five seconds flat like Steve could. And then immediately have him busting a gut the way Steve could.
while he still has his sanity. “Alright. My job here is done. You crazy kids enjoy the night. Sharon make sure Steve’s in bed by 9 pm so he can get his full 8 hours of sleep! If he doesn’t he gets cranky!”
Peter nods his head.
They don’t speak to each other very much after that. Steve departs immediately to his son’s room to organize and Happy disappears to the living room. Not much needs to be done in Peter’s room since the space was only going to be used temporarily, but Steve can’t help but go through each item and find them a home.
Tony smiles and allows his fiancé to pull him in for a dance. They hold each other close, swaying softly to the music.
Peter is shocked from the blunt response. He almost expected Flash to at least think about it before immediately jumping to not wanting the baby, but Peter is on the same page. Or at least he was when he first found out.
Steve feels more at ease knowing that he didn’t have to face the press. He wasn’t ready to face the world just yet, let alone with four pups that were
Peter slowly approaches, fidgeting with the t-shirt that keeps sliding down his shoulder. His uncle snaps his head up, revealing swollen, inflamed eyes.
The sobs are soft, almost as if Steve was trying to keep quiet, but Tony could hear them and his heart breaks at the sound. Knowing that sleep was never going to come, he throws the blanket off and heads toward Steve’s room.
“Tony, you’re not making sense-”
“This is...for me?” He asks, turning to face his uncle and the Director.
“Oh there will definitely be some changes around here.” Pepper glances around the large office, imagining how the space would look once she gets control of it. But it wasn’t just this room that needed a makeover. The whole company needed one inside and out.
“More. Harder.”
“Papa, can I go with you on your runs?”
Peter smiles widely and rushes over to hug his uncle as tight as he can. “Thank you! I promise no more sneaking out and I won’t skip school anymore!”
“Never. You two will just be weird.”
Steve sighs and rises to his feet. He moves toward Tony and reaches out for him, taking his hand and forcing him to stop. Tony sighs heavily and lets Steve take his hand.
“Tony, tell me what you know. Is this his first pup?”
Peter curses to himself.
“Come on. You really want to cut your week with Pete short over some mission?”
He doesn’t want to bring up something as touchy as that and upset his son. Peter was barely keeping it together, and the last thing Tony wanted to do was upset him even more than he already has. He promised he’d be there for his son and help him through this difficult time, and that’s exactly what he was going to do.
“Now?” Sam has the audacity to ask. There’s still a clingy cat in the room and a teenager due home any minute.
“Right away, Mr. Stark.” The man nods and takes the ring to package it up nicely.
“Sorry.” Steve grins. His hands come to rest on his hips, his own chest rising and falling from the exertion. “Guess I wanted to breeze through this.”
Tony sighs sadly. “Stupid, stupid things. I was a kid myself, a little older than you actually. I honestly didn’t know how to cope with it.”
“I’ll be right back.”
It’s more difficult than usual to remove Steve’s suit. He cries out and flinches when Tony helps him slide out of it. Tony’s eyes are immediately drawn to bruises decorating his husband’s chest. He glances lower, remembering that Steve had been complaining of his stomach. Much to Tony’s relief there’s no bruises.
“Why are you this good for me, hmm?” Tony talks softly to her while he finishes dressing her.
“You talk,” Sam lies back and rests his head against the pillow, his eyes struggling to stay open. “Tell me what you’re feeling because I know you won’t open up again.”
Peter peers up at him and nods before pretending to eat. He’s not hungry.
“Not hungry,” Steve mutters, moving his fork around the plate.
Harley isn’t impressed with those words.
“I did believe you. I do. But you have to understand that at the time none of it made sense. You randomly show up claiming that we met and I’m the father of your unborn pup. It sounded-”
James surprisingly is the calm one. He’s mature for his age, probably because he had to grow up faster to take care of his younger siblings. It was heartbreaking. James was only five and already had his life altered in the worst way. It wasn’t fair to the young pup.
So maybe it was time Steve confided in him. He needed Tony now more than ever.
“Relax. You secret’s safe with me, remember?” Sam reminds the omega. “I’m almost done here. Pretty soon this room is gonna fill up.”
“I know. I’m so proud of you, honey. I knew you could do this.”
Sam smiles and shrugs. “I try my best. Now go. I’m sure everyone is missing you like crazy.”
“Is he-”
He had lost himself after Peter’s birth. He questioned every move he made, constantly doubting himself and his abilities to be anyone other than America’s hero. He was a father now. And that was his most important role.
“I have the coolest news! Dad, guess what!” Peter rushes over to Tony.
“Fuck,” Tony moans when Steve wraps his mouth around his cock. He grips Steve’s head, and threads his fingers through the blond locks. Steve hums and takes more of Tony into his mouth, moaning and bobbing his head. “Shit, Steve, that feels good. Yeah, baby like that.”
“I want to apologize for how I acted.”
“But-”
“Actually, I love spending time with you. I like watching you work. It’s incredible what you can do and I wanted to capture those moments.”
I feel so bad for both of them! And Pierce is so creepy but he gets worse 😬 I will update soon!
But almost. He still had a home back at the compound. It had been the only home he’d ever known. His family was there. Maybe he could have two homes.
“I just want him to be okay,” Steve says, his voice cracking slightly when more tears fill his eyes and roll down his face.
He climbs up onto the table anyway and wiggles around, wincing from the paper crinkling beneath him. “I want to go home. Papa, can we just go?”
“You didn’t! I thought you wanted to get married?”
“Then I’ll go.”
“You should see him, Pep. He’s perfect.”
“Hey, don’t do that. You can. Don’t let them control you anymore. I know that’s easier said than done but you can’t let them win. Not anymore.”
“Just one does. And I found him.”
For the longest time it seemed like he and Tony would never be anything but past lovers. They had broken up, and maybe some guessed it wouldn’t have lasted, Steve couldn’t say he agreed. He had been certain that he and Tony would never be together. But now here they were, together again and happy with their son.
They hadn’t had a chance to sit down and talk about their relationship and what was next for them. It was difficult to find the time when both Peter and Tony required round the clock care.
“He’s dead, J. I don’t think he cares.”
“Be careful. If he tries to come back just tell him I’m away and I’ll speak with him when I can.”
Then Tony does it. He gets down on one knee, just like Steve had imagined him doing. Reaching into the pocket of his jacket, Tony retrieves a black velvet box and opens it, showing the ring that’s nestled inside.
“If that’s Nat, she won’t be happy that you’re ignoring her.”
“Hi.” Tony smiles back.
A small smile forms over Peter’s face. “I guess so. Does it really get easier?”
“I wasn’t offering,” Natasha says and takes a drink. She sets the glass down and narrows her eyes. “You have a lot of nerve showing up here. Bucky could’ve done some serious damage.”
Tony brings him closer and presses a kiss to his forehead. “I love you,” he whispers. “we’re getting out of this. I promise.”
This chapter focuses on Tony and his grief. I’m sorry but he needs to suffer a little...right? Or is that too harsh? He did make Steve suffer for years so... 🤷♀️
“Something’s wrong,” Happy frowns. “What is it?”
“What is this time? Because the pickled onions and ice cream was disgusting.” Tony can’t help but shudder at the memory.
“No. Talk to me. What the hell does that mean?”
By this point, Steve has officially lost his mind. His brain feels numb, the lack of sleep interfering with him both physically and mentally. He can’t for the life of him figure out why his son was so distraught.
“I see the way you are with our pups and how much you love them. But it’s the way you’re beginning to love yourself that I notice a little more. You’ve been to hell and back and you’ve got the scars to prove it, but it’s amazing how much progress you’ve made. I could never have done it. I might be an alpha and you're an omega, but I look up to you. I want to follow you.”
More guards are waiting for him. He’s defenseless without a weapon like the ones they possess, but he has one advantage. He’s stronger than any of the alphas.
He gives the statue one more look, then he rushes away, hoping that his uncles don’t kill him.
“I was just wondering if you’d be able to show me my son. He’s moving a lot more now and…”
Steve’s smile grows brighter. “Yeah. Aren’t you glad I said yes the first time?”
“I already have, haven’t I? I left. I broke up with you. I just think this, right now, is better.”
“Where the hell have you been?” Bucky demands.
Peter doesn’t bother protesting and throws off the blankets from his body with a huff. “Fine.”
But now he had a new letter and apparently a son. The kid sort of resembled him, if the eyes and dark hair were anything to go by, but Tony still wanted to find a way that didn't tie him to the kid he just met. He didn’t do well with kids. They had never been something he wanted, mostly due to the fact that he didn’t know how to be a father. He didn’t deny that he could be an asshole. Kids and him didn’t mix.
“They talked to me too,” Happy says and with a sigh he leans back in his seat. His eyes grow misty again. “I didn’t even know if I helped them. I have no idea what the hell was going on with Tony. If he would’ve just…”
“He’s okay. It just caught me off guard. Pepper said he’s going to be strong,” Steve says.
He’d do it for Steve.
He reaches up with one hand to remove the glasses and end the terrible nightmare, but then his papa is smiling weakly at him and Peter freezes.
“I need you to pull up news or footage, keyword Ste-Captain America.”
Steve lowers himself down beside Tony and opens up his arms, smiling brightly when Peter is placed in them. “Hi, Petey. Are you happy to see me? Yes you are, huh?” Steve coos.
“How come you never told him about the test?” Bruce asks.
“You okay?” Tony asks. This time Steve turns toward him and nods, but it’s clear he’s trying to hide any pain he might be feeling.
Peter returns his gaze back on his dad, new tears forming in his eyes. He can see the genuine hurt in his dad’s eyes. It’s a look he’s never seen before. He thought he had seen pain when they talked about his papa, but this pain was different.
“Shit!” Steve glances down and Happy’s curious gaze follows. Steve can’t see it, but he can feel the wet spot growing along the front of his sweats. “My water broke.”
“I know, I know. Let me talk to him,” Tony says and turns to his son. “If you want.”
“Don’t,” Steve warns.
Nick Fury wasn’t exactly the person Steve had imagined telling about the baby, at least not right away. But Nick was the director and had every right to know. Steve just didn’t imagine telling him anything until he was ready.
“This is why you’re not doing events like that anymore. The Stark Expo is one thing but anything else is forbidden. You’re always coming home drunk and sleeping around. Now it’s finally caught up with you.”
“Except his closet,” Peter says as he fidgets with his hands. “He was always putting a bunch of stuff in there. You know, like Christmas gifts or things like that.”
“Right away, sir.”
Tony grins and steps further into the room. “Always. How is he?” He asks, coming over to get a better look at their son. Peter pulls away from Steve when he senses his other father and sets his gaze on Tony.
“I know you are. I’ve never seen you so giddy.”
He’s not sure what he’s even supposed to grab. The bedroom he’s currently residing in can only hold so much, and a part of him isn’t comfortable taking full control of the space yet. It was supposed to belong to a future family member.
He just wished the one time Tony decided to sleep wouldn’t be when their daughter was going to be born.
The nursery is nearly complete now that they’ve furnished it. All they needed to do was organize the new items they purchased. Steve pushes aside his exhaustion to finish their project. He wanted everything to be perfect for when his son came home.
“Everywhere. Isn’t that right, J?”
“Hey.” Tony stills his movements, abandoning their mating to comfort the omega. He lovingly strokes Steve’s face. “You’re not with him,” he says again. “He’s gone. He won’t hurt you anymore.”
“Whatever you want. The choice is yours. I promise we’ll be fine with whatever you want to do. You want to chill in that guest room from time to time that’s cool with me. And if you’d rather stay with Nat then that’s fine too. There will be no hard feelings.”
Steve nods and allows Pepper to lead him back to the living room.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” he says again.
The living room is another painful reminder that they wouldn’t have another chance to watch movies together. It was something they did after Steve would come home from missions or during any of his days off. Peter’s favorite thing was to show his papa all the movies he might have missed.
His son calms down and Steve is able to go in search of his boyfriend and dog. It’s not hard to find them; lately Tony’s spent most of his time working on the nursery. Steve’s tried, but with the fatigue and aching back and feet, he’s not able to help as much as he likes. He trusts Tony with the project, though.
“You’re gonna cum like this,” Tony pants against his ear. He moves his hips harder, making sure to hit that spot inside of Steve with each thrust.
Peter rolls his eyes. “No.”
The appointment goes well; both Tony and the baby are doing fine. There had been concerns with Tony’s age and if his uterus was capable of carrying a baby to term-it was the whole reason why Steve was supposed to get pregnant- but the scans were good. It was relieving.
“I know, but it’s fine. He’s okay.”
The alpha is locked behind a heavily sealed door. Steve throws himself against it, grunting each time his body collides with it. Its looks are deceiving; Steve proves to be stronger and his body creates dents in the metal. He eventually brings the door down with a loud crash and enters the room.
Steve visibly tenses at that name and hides himself in Tony’s neck, deeply inhaling the soothing scent to rid himself of the nerves coursing through his body. Tony responds by pulling Steve close and scenting him.
Tony curls up closer, pressing his lips against the back of Steve’s shoulder. “Was it good?”
“I’m fine, Tony. Don’t.”
“Again!” Harley says and Sam tickles him again.
“Yeah. I made a friend today. His name is Sam.”
“I love you, sweetheart.”
Peter smiles. “I’m happy you’re here too. Which reminds me...are you coming back?”
The exam room Tony leads Steve to doesn’t compare to the ones he’s used to. Hydra had only made their room exceptional for their potential heir. They didn’t care if Steve was comfortable or not. The bed in the middle of the room lacks the straps Hydra had installed on their beds. At least Steve wouldn’t have to worry about being tied down for the exam.
“Good.” Tony kisses Steve’s shoulder again. “How’s Tony Junior?”
“Told you. Did it work for you?”
“Tony?”
He ignores the tainted water and gently scrubs Steve’s body clean. Steve is still sobbing, the painful sounds echoing in the showers walls. Tony works quickly to get him clean, not wanting him to remain any longer than he needs to in this room.
Getting to know Tony took time, and even then there were still days when Steve was discovering something new about him. But he loved him despite his flaws and their differences. They didn’t make sense to some, but they didn’t need permission from anyone to feel the way they felt.
That thought is what has Peter reaching for the trash can and throwing up.
A chorus of ‘yes’ fills the room and Steve rolls his eyes. He couldn’t care less what the gender of his baby was. All that mattered was that they were healthy. So far the scans had been good and none of his past health conditions decided to pop up. The baby was perfectly healthy.
Steve whines low in his throat, needing to comfort his baby. As if on cue, the door opens and Tony comes in, smelling of coffee and grease. They’ve only been back a few hours and already Tony was hard at work in his workshop.
He’s snapped from his thoughts when Morgan whimpers in his arms. One glance down shows her tiny features contorting into distress. Tony hopes she’s not hungry again. The last thing he wants to do is go back upstairs and wake his husband.
“5:30.”
That gets Clint smacked by both his wife and Natasha.
It’s the breeding bench in the center of the room.
“So you know about-”
“He okay?” Steve asks, his voice laced with worry.
“Me? Why is it always me?”
Sure enough the doors open and the beta walks in with more bags of a food. A scowl forms over his face and he comes over to set the bags down on the kitchen counter. Tony rushes into the kitchen to greet him.
Pepper laughs. “Something like that.”
“Okay. We can stay in. I just don’t want you getting bored locked away here. We haven’t gone out in weeks.”
Tony is gripped tightly by Rumlow, his face beaten and fresh blood dripping from his busted lip. He glances up at Steve, defeat flooding his usually confident eyes.
“Give us a minute, Pete,” Bucky says. Peter doesn’t even protest and immediately heads toward the door. He smiles at Sam one last time before leaving the room and shutting the door on his way out. Bucky sighs heavily and leans back in his seat, slipping his hand free from Sam’s to rub at his forehead.
“What a bunch of jerks,” Ned frowns as they continue to make their way down the hall and toward their first class.
Steve whimpers and hangs his head. He’s not in the mood for any of Tony’s jokes. It’s not like he gets them half of the time anyway.
A part of him wants to answer the phone and tell his dad he’s thinking about him too and misses him, but the other half argues against it. Maybe he’s being too immature about this, but he wants his dad to feel just like his papa had for all those years.
Steve huffs out a laugh and leans closer until they’re lips are brushing against each others. There’s still a part of him that wonders if Tony was up to the idea of them having sex. Just because his energy levels have increased over the past few weeks didn’t mean that he was willing to do it.
“I can’t do this.” Tony shakes his head and turns away to hide the sob that threatens to tear from his throat. He takes a moment to gather himself before turning back to face the statue. “Why?” He finally has the courage to confront Steve. It was a shame it was too late. “Why didn’t you fucking tell me? That night at the stupid party…”
Peter nods and quickly rushes toward the guest bedroom.
Steve can’t help but smile. He sees so much of himself in his son. He had wanted to give anything to join the army and prove that he was capable of doing more than what everyone around him believed. It was clear how much becoming an Avenger meant to his son.
“Maybe you two should move in together?” Sam pipes up from his spot in the kitchen. “Save us all the headache.”
“Then it shouldn’t be too hard to find him.”
“Yes.”
“Jarvis?” Steve says, making sure his voice is soft enough to avoid waking his mate. There’s no response from the A.I. and Steve frowns. “Jarvis?”
She’s not the only one transfixed by his presence. The rest of the team gather around to properly meet their newest member.
“That’s what I’ve been saying for 15 years,” Sam says sadly.
Thank you for being such wonderful readers/friends! I love you all!
“You okay?”
“She looks good,” Bruce says as he finishes up the examination on Sarah. He smiles sweetly at the little girl and fishes into his pocket for a lollipop. Her blue eyes widen in surprise and she accepts the piece of candy.
Steve was still nervous about having a baby, but he was ready to love his baby with everything he had. Tony still appeared hesitant, or maybe Steve was overthinking again. Tony had already made it clear that he wanted to have a baby. He wouldn’t be pregnant right now if he didn’t. But Steve can’t help but wonder if his husband was truly joyed with the news.
Steve is already in bed by the time Tony joins him in the bedroom. Tony quickly changes out of his suit and into something more comfortable. He crawls into bed beside Steve and pulls him close, sighing in content when Steve accepts his touch.
And Tony gave all of that up. He had walked away from the people that he considered family and home. The guilt would never truly leave him, and he’s accepted that. It would be a curse to forever haunt him in this lifetime. He can only hope there’s peace after this. Steve believed there was.
“Steve? Hey FRIDAY sent me an alert. You okay?”
“Be good for Papa okay? Of course you will,” Tony smiles.
True to his word, Tony picks Peter up from school. This time around he’s not as nervous around the teenager, and they actually have a pretty normal conversation about Peter’s classes.
Once the room is ready for tomorrow’s meeting, Steve and Sam are able to catch their breath and chat for a moment before Steve was to leave. Sam always stayed longer than he needed to, liking to be prepared for his next group. Steve often wondered if the alpha just preferred staying late than going home to an empty house. It must get lonely.
Her eyes flutter open, their gazes locking with one another. Steve smiles down at her. He can already see parts of himself in her tiny features. The rest must resemble those of the alpha that helped create her. Steve was never allowed to view the alphas that came in; his eyes were always covered.
Tony is still hesitant, and with cautious steps he joins his husband. Steve glances up, offering a small smile. It’s the first smile Tony has seen in days.
“I am relaxing. I’ve never felt more relaxed.”
“Enhanced? What does that-what does that mean?”
He’s led to the nursery, and there he finds his daughter and husband. Morgan is in her crib, her face red and scrunched in displeasure, kicking her little legs and flailing her arms. Steve is sitting beside her crib with his head buried in his hands, his body shaking with each sob that escapes him.
Tony gives a small shrug in response. He immediately regrets it.
He eventually complied, deciding that one more contribution wouldn’t hurt. From what he knew about this organization, they were trying to change the world. Like he hasn’t heard that before. Everyone was trying to change the world. And yet no one had actually done it. At least, not entirely. He too was on that list. He wanted to make the world a better place with the tech he created. It was a step up from his days manufacturing weapons.
“It’s-”
“You seem to be better at this than I am. I’ve been reading up on caring for babies and I still can't grasp it. I guess I’m not meant to be-”
“You ready to do this?” Tony asks, turning his head in Steve’s direction.
“Morning,” he greets softly, peeking up to meet his dad’s eyes. The gaze is hard and makes Peter want to run back upstairs and lock himself in his room. But then the identical brown eyes are softening.
“Yeah.” Tony nods. “It nearly gave me a heart attack the first time she did it. Guess tummy time is working.
He can’t help but wonder if maybe this pup was different than the others and had the serum. Steve quickly shakes his head from that thought. He doesn’t want to worry about that, not when he had bigger problems.
“Obviously. He’s a good dog.”
“Mama, why are you sad?” James asks, peering up at Steve with sad, confused eyes.
“I gave you a name. I liked Benjamin,” Tony says.
“I’m gonna be honest with you. I do feel guilty, but that’s not the reason behind my generosity. I’m not an asshole.”
“Nah,” Tony waves the idea off. “I need to be here. Work helps.”
“Hey, hey relax. I’m on my way. Why? You miss me?”
“He really kept it clean, huh?” Tony says, his eyes roaming over the bedroom. “I’m not surprised.”
Steve nods and presses a kiss to the top of Tony’s head. “I promise.”
“Yeah, kiddo, it’s me. Are you ready to go home?”
“That’s alright. I think that’s the last pup I want to disturb.”
“Dammit, Steve,” Tony curses and rests his head against the door with a thump. Morgan’s cries reach his ears and he’s forced to forget about Steve and focus on his daughter.
“Yeah. But...not this version of him.”
With a heavy sigh he zips up his backpack and slings it over his shoulder. He never does make it to school, but that would just be another secret he’d have to keep.
Slowly he was regaining that trust and faith in people, but it was going to take more time for him to truly accept others. It took him some time to trust Tony and the friends he’s made through his mate. He only trusted this new alpha because she had aided in his and his family’s rescue.
First I want to apologize for the short chapter! These two have a lot to figure out still but it’s coming together! Thank you for being patient with me! I love you all! ❤️
The wall he’s landing on isn’t going to hold him for long and he crawls as fast as he can, relief washing over him when he spots the exit. Another boom shakes the deteriorating structure, the fear of getting caught in the rubble motivating Peter to move hurriedly.
“I’ll get the paperwork together. I know you won’t.” Pepper teases.
“Please!” Steve tries to turn his head away. “Don’t make him watch! Please!”
Steve chuckles softly. “Steve is fine, kid.”
“Morning,” Steve greets, frowning slightly when Tony grumbles his version of phrase. “Didn’t sleep?”
“I know.”
“Papa used to say the same thing.”
“I guess. Forget it. We’re not doing anything. I told him we’d take it slow.”
Peter takes a shaky breath and connects his glistening eyes with his dad’s.
“It’s okay! I can come by everyday!”
“Oh. I hope he’s okay. I don’t want him to…”
“So Sarah will be the flower girl and Peter the ring bearer?” Steve asks, looking at his fiancé for confirmation. Tony is distracted in the kitchen. Sarah had decided cookies were needed for her tea party, and Tony, wanting to be the best daddy that ever lived, went ahead and gathered up the ingredients to make his daughter homemade cookies.
Tony makes a face. “I hate that shirt.”
“Good.” Tony pecks Steve on the lips. “I gotta go. I love you.”
They are forced to break apart when the elevator comes to a stop and the doors slide open. Tony takes Steve by the hand and leads him out and toward their private quarters.
“No. I don’t know. The way you were holding her-”
It’s not a complete lie.
Tony brings the car seat over to the sofa so that Dodger can meet the newest family member. Peter is stirred from his sleep when Dodger comes over to sniff him.
He’s not left in complete darkness; the light to Steve’s room is still on, spilling into the living room and giving it a dim glow. Tony turns his head toward the hall, waiting for the light to be shut off and Steve to go to bed. But it remains on.
“But Steve is different. I’m not saying he’d hurt her,” Bruce quickly says when Tony frowns. “You and I both know Steve isn’t capable of hurting anyone he loves. But I do think he needs to see someone.”
Morgan sighs and her vision blurs with fresh tears. She sniffs and wipes at her nose. “You guys don’t...you don’t care about me.”
“The kid just saw you at the ceremony,” Sam says with a shake of his head.
Harley and Sarah move toward Tony, crowding around him and sniffing the new person. Tony chuckles and helps Sarah sit down beside him so that she can continue to touch and giggle at her baby brother.
He pushes his own feelings aside and focuses on his son’s. Peter was the one who should be nervous and scared. His situation was more dire than Tony’s.
“Shh. I’ll do it, sweetheart. I promise.” Tony places another kiss over the sensitive area before trailing lower until the collar of Steve’s shirt prevents him from going any further. Tony leans back and runs his hands down Steve’s chest and torso, a smile forming over his face when he touches the bump. “I won’t hurt you,” he makes a promise to his son. His eyes flicker up to meet Steve’s. “Or you.”
Steve frowns and turns back to the road. He wonders if Tony was being honest with him.
A part of him wishes he could go back and fix the way they left things. He wonders if his papa had felt the exact same way. He must have. Why else would he have written so many letters?
But there was still that ounce of doubt Tony had regarding the pup. The results of the test wouldn’t be for a few days, and though a part of Tony had been hoping that he wasn’t tied to the baby growing inside of the omega, the other half can’t help but wonder what it would be like if he was.
“I’ve had one checkup.”
Peter bites down on his bottom lip and eyes the closed door warily. “What if I can’t?”
It’s tempting to wake him and throw him out like Pepper had suggested. Okay maybe she wasn’t that cruel. It was Tony who said he would throw him out.
Tony scoffs. “I feel...a lot worse than just that. I-sorry, you probably don’t want to hear it. Or even care. I don’t blame you.”
“Eh.” Tony moves toward the coffee and takes the mug Steve left out for him. “Pete didn’t keep me up, thank God. But my back is killing me. Maybe you can rub it later.”
Their relationship needed to be mended first.
“I’m not,” Tony assures.
“I know you two weren’t together and I respect the decision you two made but...how come you didn’t come to the funeral?”
“Not since earlier. Why?”
“Shh. I know,” Steve soothes. He manages to get a few good burps out of him, then he lays him over his chest and holds his son close. It’s not long before Peter is purring softly. Steve responds with his own purr.
But she can’t wait for them to come looking for her. It’s obvious she didn’t matter. Their jobs, training Peter, and caring for Harley was important. She meant nothing to them.
“I could tell. You came so much.” Tony can’t help but grimace at the warmth trickling down his thighs. “If I’m not pregnant after this then I don’t know what to tell you.”
“I’ve been better,” Steve says, forcing a smile to hide the fact that in reality, he wasn’t doing all that great. It wasn’t just the tenderness from the birth that was affecting him. He was still struggling to wrap his mind around the fact that he had just given birth and needed to care for a tiny, vulnerable human. It was overwhelming.
“Can you wait that long? You should’ve done something sooner.”
Her parents work harder to share their attention and they’re getting better. Harley is still the baby of the family, and would always hold that title, but he’s learning to share.
“I've been through worse,” Steve replies and lays his head back, eyes focusing on the ceiling above him. He can still feel eyes on him and he knows it’s Tony staring at him again. He can’t bring himself to stare back.
Bucky gets up from the table, abandoning breakfast and disappearing down the hall. The bedroom door slams shut.
The nurse lingers nearby, checking the monitors the baby is still connected to. She offers help when Steve needs her, but otherwise she’s giving the new father space to bond with his baby.
Steve swallows hard before speaking. “My name is Steve Rogers. I was born and raised in Brooklyn. Um…” Steve pauses and frowns, unsure of how to continue. He can’t mention the army, his sacrifice, being frozen for years. He wasn’t ready to reveal who he really was yet.
“Hey. You can do this. I promise you’re stronger than you think. I never could have done what you did. I’m not as strong as you.”
“It’s an army thing,” Steve replies.
“Of course not,” Tony assures and takes Steve’s hand, bringing it up to his lips and kissing it. “It’ll be a group interview. Well, minus the pups.”
I had to add more Steve& Nat stuff because they’re adorable and I love them. She really was the first one he told about the baby and now she’s helping him out so much because she cares. Their friendship is so good! 😊
“I was approached by Dr. Erskine, and he was the one who offered me that chance. Dr. Erskine wanted omegas to be equal. His serum was meant to make them stronger. That’s why I’m this way. It affected me differently, though. He told me it would. It makes good great.”
True to his word, Nick had managed to keep Steve’s big secret hidden from the rest of the world and provide care for both himself and his unborn child. The medical staff worked for SHIELD and they too had orders to keep their mouths shut or else face consequences Steve was too nervous to question.
Tony only nods. “Okay.”
“Hey,” Steve greets with a smile. “Dinner will be ready in ten. Your dad’s on his way home.”
“Thor-”
“Shit.” He gasps at the results.
Tony gently places her in Steve’s arms, standing awkwardly while Steve struggles to get her in a comfortable position to latch on. She’s not having any of it, only growing more agitated with each attempt Steve makes. The shift in her attitude is doing nothing for Steve’s.
Peter’s glad the statue had been replaced. It was his dad who fixed the mess Peter had made. Peter still feels guilty for destroying it.
“You’re being too hard on yourself, sir,” Jarvis says, the sound of his voice snapping Tony from his thoughts. Tony lets out a sigh and slants in his seat. “Perhaps coming out here was a bad idea.”
Brock chuckles darkly. “You’re not going anywhere. Mr. Pierce won’t like his prized omega running away again.”
Steve’s lips part, a word over his tongue, and for a second Tony wonders if he’ll opt out.
“Pete,” Bruce is calmer when he speaks, a complete contrast to the other version of himself. “You shouldn’t be here. These missions are dangerous. You could’ve been seriously injured or-”
Steve smiles softly. “No more yelling. He’ll behave.”
“Tony, wait,” Steve tries to defuse the situation. “I’m not trying to make this about me. Having a baby was for both of us. I thought you wanted this.”
Happy eyes the pair closely, then with a nod, turns on his heel and leaves the penthouse.
“Like it belongs to someone else,” Peter replies, eyes filling with tears. “I don’t think I can do this.”
“I...I guess I’d miss them too. Peter is a lot of fun to hang out with and Harley does give the best hugs. Papa loves to draw with me sometimes and he always gives me a kiss everytime he sees me. And dad...I used to think he was too protective and the nicknames were embarrassing but...but I’d miss it.”
Tony doesn’t want to get his hopes up, especially when it was too soon to say for sure, but he was positive Steve was feeling like himself again. He wonders if their night out had anything to do with it. Steve had been different that night; he smiled and laughed, something Tony hadn’t seen him do in a long time.
Peter shakes his head. “No. I guess not.”
“No. I know you’re not ready yet.”
“I know! I’m doing everything I can to make sure both he and that pup are safe! I can’t just call anyone okay? All I have is you.”
Steve nods and turns so that he’s now facing Tony. He catches himself leaning closer and Tony follows. They’re so close to each other now. But the kiss doesn’t happen.
“Fine. If that’s how you feel then don’t bother calling me for anything ever again. I won’t be there.”
“Really? You’re gonna drag me like that? I didn’t need help-”
“Sometimes I wish he wasn’t Captain America.”
But Peter doesn’t want to hold on for so long. His papa had done that and it probably only caused him pain and misery. Peter wishes he could talk to his papa about that period in his life. There were still questions he didn’t have the answers to. He probably never would get them.
They wait until the following morning to tell Peter the truth. Tony is the first one up; he didn’t get any sleep last night, not that he was expecting to after the events of the previous day. He wasn’t sure if he'd ever be able to sleep again. All he could think about was the life they lost and the what ifs.
“You need to calm down. It’s not her fault-”
Their sex life was one Steve considered good. They rarely had a dull moment and if they did they worked hard to fix it and make it better. Usually whenever one of them was in the mood, the other didn’t hesitate to get on their level.
Steve chuckles before joining in, chasing after his son and catching him in his arms, using his strength to lift Peter up in the air. The little boy erupts in a fit of giggles.
“Okay,” Peter sighs sadly, then his face is lighting up. “I know the perfect time!”
He takes small, cautious steps toward the omega. He doesn’t reach out for him, deciding physical contact wasn’t something they needed right now.
“Tony, stop.” Steve tries to block the camera with his palm, making Tony chuckle again.
“No one is pretending,” Bruce adds. “We all saw the signs.”
“They’re his?” Sam asks. Steve doesn’t reply. The pups didn’t belong to that alpha. Steve doesn’t even know what happened to the three strangers that sired his sons and daughter. His lack of response must make Sam assume that the pups do in fact belong to the alpha Steve has mentioned. “Did he...force himself on you?”
One shoots and Tony grabs the side of his neck. He’s met with a sting and his vision blurs. He stumbles back, colliding with the wall. His legs give out and he slumps to the floor.
He can hear her voice in his head, but he tunes it out and reaches for the glass, bringing it up to his lips and taking a large drink. It burns going down.
For the most part their lives are normal again, and Tony’s feeling pretty damn proud of himself for accomplishing his plan. Every now and then he thinks about the life they lost and the guilt he now has to carry with him. But then he’s reminding himself of all the trouble he’s saved the poor kid, and that’s what helps him sleep at night.
“Don’t ever come near me. I don’t love you anymore. I can’t.”
It was hard enough with their busy schedules to find time for themselves, and now training a dog had to fit in there somewhere. It wasn’t going to work and Tony had no problem letting his boyfriend in on his opinions.
The praise only urges Steve on. He pulls off Tony’s cock and sucks on the head, then he brings Tony back into his mouth until the tip brushes against the back of his throat. Tony bites down on his bottom lip to stifle his moans, not wanting to wake their sleeping pups and ruin what might be their only night to be intimate.
Peter doesn’t say it out loud but there was honestly more his dad can do for him. Making a suit was nice, but Peter wanted more from him. It was just a matter of if and when he’d get the relationship he so badly wanted.
But the alpha inside him demands he breed the omega. Why else would he find himself locked in a room with a ripe and fertile omega? The omega was practically on display for him.
“I love you,” he whispers.
“We will,” Tony answers.
“I can drive you.”
“You better keep that promise or I’m coming for you.”
Tony sniffs and straightens up, forcing Steve to pull back. He turns so that he can face Steve. “It’s not your fault. You can’t blame yourself for this.”
Peter rolls over onto his side and forces his mind to relax. He’d figure out how to tell Flash and then hopefully the rest would fall into place.
“Maybe,” Tony replies. “She definitely noticed that first night you were gone. It was difficult but we eventually figured it out. I don’t know if you want to try breastfeeding again…”
“But those are the best.”
“Huh that’s funny. You used to do it all the time.”
He smiles at the familiar color scheme; red, white, and blue would always mean something to him. But it’s the star in the center that makes his heart clench in the most painful way. Beside the suit is the helmet he remembers wearing as a kid, and then there’s the shield.
He takes her out of the nursery and toward the master bedroom. Steve is already out of the shower and sitting on the edge of the bed, still dressed in his pajamas and surrounded by the clothes he’s picked out for the evening.
“I think he’s done,” Steve says when Peter stops nursing and falls back asleep.
“I’m serious! Let me take you out on a nice dinner and then we can come back here and cuddle all you want.”
Tony frowns up at him and props himself up on his elbows. “Why? Is it something I said?”
“And we brought gifts!” Thor beams, coming over to show off the bear. Steve accepts it with a smile. “How are you feeling?”
When Peter opens his eyes, he’s back in the lab.
Tony doesn’t want to think about Steve now. He had spent all night drinking and wishing he had done something right. There was guilt regarding his son, but the guilt he had for Steve was much worse. He’d never forgive himself.
But it wasn’t being on a team that Tony was struggling with. His feelings for Steve was the reasoning behind his decision to leave. It was the only way he’d get over Steve for good.
“Fine,” Steve replies, his voice is still thick from sleep, but there’s something else about his tone that worries Tony.
Tony groans and drags his cock slowly out until just the tip remains inside, then he’s thrusting back in and fucks Steve roughly.
“You’ll still be beautiful.”
Tony eyes the little boy on the bed. “And...James, right?” He asks and Steve nods. “He’s okay?”
“I’m not ready,” Steve whispers.
He’s roughly thrown into a stall and the cuffs are removed.
But then Tony surprises him by curling up close beside him. The scent of him had already been comforting, but it didn’t compare to his natural warmth. It’s foreign in a way to have an alpha this close to him. Usually the alpha’s he was near didn’t care about comfort and security. Only their needs mattered.
“Before you were born, Steve disappeared from his own party because it was a little overwhelming. That’s why you’re hiding, right?”
Tony kisses the gland and gently scrapes his teeth against it. Steve moans.
It’s the smell of coffee that Steve picks up first, then he hears the sound of footsteps. Correction. Multiple sounds of footsteps. Steve turns toward the doorway just as his two sons rush into the room. Harley pushes his brother out of the way, earning a small growl from James.
“About time you showed up. I was ready to leave,” Tony says in a teasing manner. The beta isn’t amused and he rolls his eyes. “I’m kidding. Lighten up.”
Steve doesn’t respond and his eyes fall shut. “M-my, pups…”
Steve wasn’t honestly sure how to do it. Every night he was forced to lie awake and go over the list of pros and cons he’s made. The obvious pro would be having Tony back and their child having both of their parents. The con was having Tony back and risk losing him all over again.
Tony makes a pained noise. He didn’t want to be reminded of that asshole. “Steve, stop.”
“We’ll get there.”
Inviting a complete stranger into his vehicle was one thing. Inviting a complete stranger into his home...well, that was something entirely different.
“Welcome to the family, Squirt. You’re going to love it.”
“Where’d you learn that?”
Then he grows quiet.
His head snaps up when a knock on the door fills his ears. The doctor is entering the room, a warm smile on her face.
“I hope so,” Tony says quietly.
Tony doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say so he keeps quiet. He doesn’t want to say that he’s the main reason Steve never had any peace in this life. Perhaps he doesn’t have to. He’s sure Peter knows all about their fallout and the stupid, shitty things Tony did.
Tony hesitantly takes the letter and reads over his name. “What is this?”
“I feel okay.”
Tony scowls. “Thanks for leaving me to hang, J. I needed help back there.”
“Depends,” Tony answers honestly. “This kiddo hates everything I eat.”
“We are a family.”
Tony sends her a quick glance before directing his attention back on his tablet. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Yeah,” Tony nods in agreement. “But he did have fun.”
“How are you feeling?” Tony asks and he gently lowers himself down on the bed beside his husband.
Peter sighs sadly. “I think he would’ve been excited about a baby. He never mentioned having another one.”
Tony grimaces, stepping back when the dog has set its attention on him and comes over, still wagging its tail. Its nose is cold and wet, and Tony quickly pulls his hand away. “Go. Shoo!” he waves the dog away, ignoring the chuckling coming from his boyfriend.
“Maybe if we switch them,” Steve suggests. “Peter Benjamin? Sound good?”
Tony comes in after him, a heavy sigh leaving his lips. Some time has passed since he’s been in his Malibu home. If the circumstances were different, maybe he’d feel more excited to be back, to be on a break from New York and his hectic work schedule.
“Great,” Tony says and his eyes flicker to the omega’s belly. He can make out the small bump under the form fitting shirt. There's still that bit of doubt he has. A part of him wants the pup to be his, but the other half wants nothing to do with the current situation. His life was screwed up enough as it was. Now it was like it had gotten a thousand times worse.
Shadows starting to cover his body, the world disappearing around him… and then Tony jolted awake taking deep ragged breath, with a gentle hand stroking his lower back, a soft voice whispering in his ears and light turning to shine through the darkness.
“let’s go back inside, it’s time to sleep”
Because he tried and tried really hard, but after more then twenty minute, of insufferable sighing and seeing that Steve didn’t turned to him, Tony just threw the book he was flipping through away, hitting the cabinet on the other side of the couch, and making the object on it fall on the floor with loud thud. Catching like that Steve attention.
He isn’t sure why the warm body on top of him was so relaxing, after a rough mission. But here he is, with an arm wrapped around Tony waist, the goatee rasping on his chest, and the warm breath on his neck lulling back to sleep.
Steve isn’t sure how Tony ended in his room, or even in his bed, but here he is, curled on the other side of the bed snoring, on top of the bed sheet.
‘, quoting his actual world.
“What are you doing?” a quiet and smooth voice reach his ears, followed by two strong arm, that close around his waist.
“It wasn’t” Tony only words, while his hand reached behind his back tracing slowly the scar, of his long lost wings.
“No” Tony hissed. “but…”
“I… mh…” started Tony, hissing at the pulling, but moving his eyes from the book to Steve face and vice versa. “Sorry? But you didn’t talk to me, and i wanted your attention?” continued the boy, blinding going to catch Steve hand in his hair, just to make the other boy stop his pulling. “And if you are are worried about the damage, i can always buy you a new book ok? Anyway that was all ruined, you needed a new book and…” and an hand covered his mouth shutting Tony and his rumbling.
Tony turns to Happy. “Can you get him some tea and another coffee for me?”
“It’s okay,” Sam says softly. “Take your time. We all know what it’s like to be nervous.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Slow down, stinker,” Tony teases and tenderly strokes his son’s soft hair.
“Just one. It was a few weeks ago.” Steve can’t help but shift uncomfortably from the alpha’s gaze. Tony eventually looks away when Bruce moves across the room to grab a pair of nitrile gloves. Steve half expects Tony to be by his side when the exam starts, but to his disappointment Tony lingers near the door.
Natasha glances down at her lap, noticing that the fingers she had in the messy brown hair had ceased their movements. Peter doesn’t mind; he’s already asleep. The day had been the hardest for their youngest member. They had to bury a friend, but he had to bury a father.
“I don’t remember saying it was going to be easy.”
Tony lets out a sigh and leans forward, twiddling his fingers nervously. He doesn’t even know where to begin. “I have a few questions about that night we first met. I’m gonna be honest with you here, but I don’t remember a damn thing. I tend to...act out when I’m drinking.”
“I never said anything about crushing on Mr. Rogers, sir” Jarvis said with a knowing look which only caused Tony to stutter and run away screaming ‘shut up!’
Rhodey wrapped his arms around his best friend who asked if he wanted something to drink and did the same to the others in the room before he exited to the kitchen.
“Yeah, sure. What is it, Jay?” He stood up as he gave a last look at Steve. A silent exchange went over the two.
looking at Tony, a faraway look in his eyes before he sighed and went back to conversing with Sam. Bucky squinted his eyes at the behavior then turned to look at Tony who was
No matter how much smarter and bigger his younger brother’s brain was compared to his, he wasn’t an idiot. And despite the stories Steve and his family told and will tell about him, despite his impulsive tendencies, James Buchanan Barnes-Stark was far from being considered an idiot.
A slightly colder breeze? Stiff.
“Finally awake, huh?” Steve chuckled as he stood up which earned him a pout from Tony.
, Jarvis thought to himself.
to tell you… And I was, you know, confused for a long time before I even decided on what my feelings were for Tony that I forgot to think of when and how I was going to tell you, Buck.” The blond was lying on the pavement with the palms of his hands over his eyes. “I just” he paused to sigh and then looked to the side where Bucky was. “I really really like him, Buck. I’ve liked him for a really long time” his voice cracked at the end.
He had yet to find one but aliens were a thing past astronauts had trouble dealing with. And he didn't know if the laws between them and other worlds still held through since the lack of trips his people made in recent times.
“The sass, Jay. Lower it a little. And that doesn’t exactly help calm me down” He pouted. “Not Steve’s fault…”
“Easy there, Cap” Tony said with a pointed finger “My ass can only take so much pounding. I swear I can still feel you inside me—” Steve squirmed and covered his immediately waking problem.
Tony was shocked to see the Captain up already and in a panic, it seemed. He went to support the man who's legs seemed to fail him. "Easy there, big guy" he said as the other man's entire being seemed to shake. Blue eyes scanning for any immediate threats and his breathing labored.
They had loads of fun.
Now or never.
Steve: I desire you to shut up
The countdown keeps going but it doesnt envelop the two men anymore.
“You fucking fuck, I will end you!” Running, crashing, screaming and yelling was all that could be heard.
“I cannot believe you, you fucking asshole!”
“Why don’t you go and greet that young Alpha downstairs, son?” he suggested and Maria gave him an approving squeeze.
He was a dead man walking, he knew it.
"As a kid, pretty much everything scared the hell out of me. And there were nights I would wake up crying." He looked at Steve whose eyes seemed to soften at him. "And I think even earlier, I had some really really bad days where I just was either inconsolable or so lonely I didn't know what to do with myself. "But somehow, Ana always knew what to do with me. Her and Jarvis always did." He smiled at the memory and Steve smiled as well. "Well, she used to sing me this one lullaby. And she'd sing it to me every happy day and every sad day. And she'd sung it to me one last time before succumbing to her cancer." He felt a hand grasp his over the counter and smiled at Steve before squeezing it. "And then the song just became a comfort thing. Something to sing when I was happy or sad or lonely. I never did know why I've never heard it on record before. Tried to search for it everywhere!" Steve was still looking at him with such fondness.
As he walked up to the attic however, he noticed the darkness that seemed to envelop the room. Shadows were dancing on the walls, the howl of the wind bounced around and created echoes.
Steve's eyes slightly slitted once more and a frown made its appearance on the blond's face. Blush and frown still on his face, Steve huffed up. "Well wolf me is right. I don't know why you're suddenly leaving-" "Steve, you rejected me!"
Drifting through space, calculating the distance between each star and each celestial body he came upon. He was recording a nearby galaxy when the JARVIS alerted him of a foreign object obstructing the ship's path. Thinking it was just another satellite wreck, he went to the cockpit and planned on obliterating it when he cocked his head in confusion. It looked like a sleeping pod. He asked Jarvis to scan for any signs of life but the pod was too thick and made of some sort of material that JARVIS could not get past.
Then the fireworks started.
Art for Among the Stars + a little poem I whipped up with it
And while the commotion downstairs was happening, childish laughter reverberated around the attic.
But steve just starts shrinking as he cries. Tony gets in his suit preparing to catch the  continually shrinking super soldier.
“Relax, Tony. It’s you and me, together” he said with finality. Trying to relax himself with his own words.
“Yep. Shit” They sat up together, and Steve moved to sit beside Tony. The younger man’s mind was reeling with panic and worry for Steve.
“No.”
“Before sleep, then work. Let’s go.” And with that Steve just moved toward the bedroom with a grumpy Tony tailing behind him, mumbling something about payback and a lot of coffee.
“Tony?”
Oh boy, and he didn’t like. He didn’t like it at all.
“What?” demand the blond raising his hand in a desperate gesture, just few second before that Tony flopped on his lap burying his face in his stomach.
Prompt: “You fainted…straight into my arms. You know, if you wanted my attention you didn’t have to go to such extremes.”
i don't know *shrugs* also is old this one
“Tony?” Steve started, turning around to look Tony in the eyes, eyes that reflected the stars and a future that only Tony could see… “I…” Started, but stopped right away shaking his hand and nearly falling on his knee, while taking out the little red box. “Would you marry me?”
Bored, and trying to come out of the writer block, i wrote this little thing inspired by this lovely prompt "
A scream. Hot sun burning his skin. Growing pain in his chest, and a constant mumbling in distance. A name… his name, repeated and repeated over and over again, and then his eyes snapped open.
Sighing, Steve turned back to his book, set on keeping his attention on his reading no matter what Tony did. Or at last try to…
“mh mh” mumbled Steve, taking Tony free hand in his, and starting to rub a finger on the neatl and clear letter on his wrist.
“Tony” started the man with a little smile starting to play on his lips. “My name is Tony Stark”. And after that everything went dark again, and Steve slipped back in a blissful sleep.
“What the…” Something started to crawl up Tony’s pants leg, making the genius move away from Steve to look down, raising his pants leg and finding a black eight leg crawler moving up his skin.
“Tony…” Steve sighed, going to massage his temple with his fingers. “You don’t have any clue of where we are” Steve continued stating the now obvious, raising his eyes to the night sky before shaking his head in defeat.
Around fifteen minute later and a finger poking at his side, a whine and the most suffering series of sigh a human could hold, Steve turned around looking finally in Tony’s eyes, that after a little smile averted his gaze turning back to the book like nothing happened.
“I want them to stop them.”
“Tony?” Steve called out, scared at Tony reaction, because that was the first time he actually was able to shut the other down. “Yes… no?” Steve asked again, growing unsure about the answer, with every minute of Tony stunned silence.
He could hear the faint explosion, the distant gunshot echoed through his body, mixed with strange sound, like churning, gurgling and dropping. Water? Blood? Either? Neither? He couldn’t understand, but he wanted, he wanted so bad.
Prompt:
“Let this happen.” whispered Steve. “It’s going to be ok. Let me love you, let your love free.” Pleaded and waited. Drinking with his eyes the man in front of him. Every little twitch, every little puff of air, the fast heartbeat. Till a little nod answered his question.
“This all soul mates things is not proved, it can’t be real, or at last I always thought about not being real. But then one day you popped up in my life, and everything turned upside down.
“You need to tell me what happened that made you hate that little bug so much… ok?” Steve asked, while raising from the street, and taking Tony in his arms to move back to the car and the comfort of the city.
Spiders
“HOW CAN I STOP THEM?” Tony screamed in the dark workshop.
Blood at his feet, feather tinted in red fluttering around. Dark shadow moving in silence and an immeasurable pain at his back, and a scream bubbling in his chest.
Leaving behind only a little note.
“Well…” Tony started, looking around at the big trees surrounding them and wincing. “Let’s say, everything is calculated.”
“Ok” Started Tony, making his hand slowly slid on Steve chest till… oh… OH… “ooooh” and a big smirk grew on the boy face, while the blonde face turned even more red. “Well seeing you have other thing in mind” started winking and moving his eyes from Steve lower half to his face “we could always turn the day into more fun activity…”
But that was only a dream, a beautiful dream, because Steve wasn’t there anymore. And nothing was worth anymore.
“Tony stop moving” Steve started, reaching out for Tony leg, trying to contain his laugh.
And then his eyes snapped open. His breath quick and erratic, the sweet cooling down on his over heated skin, the faint beeping of some machinery drilling in his ears, and bright light blinding his vision.
“Thinking” Tony said moving his hand to take back his forgotten coffee cup.
“Great.” Steve whispered with mirth in his tone and a smile blossoming on his face, not being able to be mad at Tony for that long, at last not when they ended in a beautiful magical little world, all for them. Owl hooting in the distance, fresh smell of pines permeating the air, water crushing on some kind of shore… peaceful, and perfect.
“You are not me.” Tony whispered looking at the open bottle in front of him, and the full glass near.
After that everything happened real fast… well fast for Tony liking at last. Steve leaned over the table. Put one hand in Tony’s hair just to thug the man toward him, and  plant a soft kiss on the parted lips in front of him.
What the hell was that?
“Why are they so goddam stupid?!?” mumbled shaking his head.
". Hope it makes sense, but i’m sure it doesn’t.  I’m sorry.
“Breath with me, slowly…” Steve soothing voice said. “It was just a dream, a bad dream.” Continued stroking Tony’s back.
“Shhhh” Steve voice reached his ears, soft and soothing. Tony blinked again, moving an hand to wipe away tears, just when a warm body moved. And strong arm wrapped around his still shacking form, in a tight hug. “No more bad dream” whispered giving little kiss on his neck. “I’m here, i will always be here for you”. More little kisses ghosted his skin, and Tony sighed relaxing again.
That was finally a Sentinel and his Guide.
“Are we lost? Or do you know where we are?”
“Love you too, sunshine” Steve whispered, setting Tony on the passenger seat, and giving him the ring that in the spider panic was forgotten. “Love you too.” Ended, closing the door looking at the little smile coming back on Tony face, and at the ring now in his possession.
A quick peck, and then everything finished.
“They are not stupid Tony, they are book” Steve sighed, abandoning his book and letting his free hand slide in the brown messy strand of the boy hair, massaging his scalp for few second before stopping and pulling lightly at the same hair.
And two names…
Tony screamed.
After that, he closed the distance, without letting go Tony hand and let their lips touch in a tender gesture. Closing his eyes and letting his sense run finally free, locking them on the man in front of him. Giving like that the final push to the wall in Tony’s brain, letting the connection between them finally spark and came alive in warm wave.
“I’m not interested in the book condition Tony, but could you… mh.. please move away from me?” asked Steve, face red and moving his eyes on the other side of the room, focusing his attention back on the book, letting finally Tonys hair go.
The dream, the vision melted one into another, until he couldn't distinguish between them anymore. Dream vs vision, reality vs delirium.
A life not mine, but at the same time mine.
“Tony…”
Steve still smiling happy moved away, murmured a soft “Thank You.” and left the kitchen with an astonished Tony behind, him with his mouth open still working on what just happened.
Tony just blinked, moving his eyes from the ring in that little red velvet box to Steve face, then back to the ring, opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water…
He wishes he could stay longer and hold Steve, but it was time to go. Steve gives Morgan another kiss, then Tony is taking her into his arms.
He knew better than to aggravate and push Steve’s buttons, and yet that’s exactly what he did. Steve was in a delicate state of mind; anything was going to set him off. Tony knew this and still decided to push and push until Steve had no choice but to blow up.
“Shit. Okay. I’m on my way now. How’s Ste-”
Steve smiles and leans closer to place a soft kiss to Tony’s cheek. Peter whimpers, forcing Steve to pull back and chuckle.
“Great,” Peter says, doing his best to hide his relief. Or maybe it was happiness. He doesn’t know. All he does know is that Flash was willing to talk with him. “Just come by place later. You know where it is right?”
Peter nods, a bright smile forming over his face. “I got it yesterday.”
He moves quietly until he’s standing near them and he reaches down to adjust the blanket that has slipped off around them. His eyes immediately travel to his husband’s protruding middle and his smile grows brighter.
Steve lets out a sigh and decides to cut his run short. He was exhausted from a sleepless night and the bit of exercise he was able to complete. He frowns at that realization. He should be able to go longer.
“Is he good?” Tony asks.
Tony chuckles softly. “Yeah, I bet.”
“How long have we been here?” Tony questions.
He doesn’t want to get out of bed, but something is telling him to search for his husband. It’s easy to find him. There’s a sliver of light peeking out from Morgan’s room, but it’s the mixture of his daughter's cries and soft sniffs that leads Tony to where Steve is.
“Steve, wait. We need to talk about this.”
Peter huffs and crosses his arms over his chest. “You know what I mean.”
Steve had asked for a scan before they left, but Tony assured him that JARVIS didn’t need to do anything. He made sure the AI kept his secret.
“Yeah whatever. Now move so I can go.”
“So Peter huh? You look familiar. Do I know you?” Tony asks, his identical eyes scanning the teen.
“Not like this,” Tony says, his voice shifting to a softer tone. He runs a hand down the curve of Steve’s back and along his hips. “Turn around. I want to see you.”
Tony bites back the groan of pain to speak to his A.I. again. “FRIDAY, he's not losing the baby, is he?”
“He will. He’s like you. Stubborn as hell and ready to fight anything that comes his way. He’ll be okay,” Tony assures, leaning forward to brush away the tears on Steve’s cheek.
“If you’d like,” the doctor says, sensing the omega’s hesitancy. “Again, I’m not here to pressure you okay? I’m trying to help.”
Steve shuts his eyes, not wanting to see the look on the alpha’s face when he enters him. The gasp Steve emits is muffled from the large palm splayed over his mouth. He’s forced to let Alpha take what was his.
Pepper narrows her eyes. “And then what?”
Steve takes a deep breath before answering, “I’m not who you think I am. I’m not even from this time. In 1943 I became an experiment.”
Peter shrugs. “I don’t know. You have a cool car so...happy?”
Peter nods and curls up against his papa, resting his head on Steve’s chest, and immediately finding comfort in the soft beating he hears.
"I got you!" Tony shouts as he catches Steve who's still just openly weeping.And Steve lets go of any fear he has left and kisses tony
“You had everyone worried when you shut yourself away from us.” Tony stopped tinkering and looked down. “I am not scolding you, young sir, simply expressing my concern.” Jarvis sat down beside Tony on his bed and laid a hand on his mop of hair.
Such a beautiful mirror, why had it been hidden away?
They sleep on just one pod, huddled together, a hand on the other's hair, another at their chests, feeling each other's warmth and heart beat.
Rhodey was about to say something when the brunet continued to ramble on.
“You sound like we’ve been doing this for months or something. We only did it last night, naughty boy” Tony teased but even he could feel the worry and anxiety in his voice.
Tony came closer to Rhodey just then and hugged him with such force that he nearly toppled over. He hugged back and couldn’t help but smile.
Anxiety pooled in Tony’s chest but Jarvis reassured him that both men were fine.
“He’s a good man, Tony.” He said taking a glance at Steve who was getting a last-minute scolding from Bucky. He looked back to Tony and hugged him tighter. “But he’s a dead man if he so much as hurts a hair on you.”
Steve isn't allowed to talk anymore, his voice is too loud.
Tony had tears in his eyes when he said "Oh for fuck's sake" and grabbed Steve for a kiss.
“He’s never gonna want someone like me…” he repeated. Rhodey put a had around the younger man’s shoulders and rested his head on the brown locks.
Days pass and while Steve was still clearly struggling with accepting what had happened to him, Tony yried his best being a gracious host.
And well Tony doesn't really handle Steve's resigned confession!
"Yeah, do you?" Tony said lacing his free hand with Steve's.
He watched the two climb up the stairs and decided to follow when he saw a different kind of air surrounding the pair.
“Steve would probably think wanting to date his best friend’s beloved younger brother as his main issue. Age gap aside. And probably the fact that you are underage”
The coffee machine beeped once, signalling it was ready. Tony sighed as he poured.
"Steve, you know you can tell me anything right? Steve nodded and then looked at his chest with such sorrow.
"That is what my scanners are telling me, sir. If it helps in identifying our mystery space man, perhaps reading his name plate would be a start."
but that second was abruptly interrupted by him being tackled to the floor. Steve was on top of him snarling.
“Y-you think?”
“I thought you were my best friend, Steven!” he yelled when he was able to corner the beefy blond.
“Forgive me if I sound too… blunt with this, sir, but I fail to see any reason as how this might be a problem” Tony immediately drew back from the warmth and looked at the man with tearful eyes and a shocked expression.
But it had been years , way before he was born, since his father's company had produced one of these. He grabbed the pod as he instructed JARVIS to pull him back.
He asked the house staff, to anyone who would entertain him. But all of them shook their heads and told him to let it go.
“Anything can be replaced in the house. You mustn’t be so worried, young sir”
When Maria and Howard married, things were a bit tense as it took quite a while for them to have a child and when they did, it was all worth it. Anthony Edward Stark was born on the 29
