Logic was telling him to step down gracefully, to listen to Steve, who was making sense.  Who had an excellent point about not upsetting Pepper.  Who had a good head on his shoulders and who was one of the only people in the room who wasn't drunk or high or some combination of the two.
Tony tinkered away at the Mark VII, which could now come to him and self-assemble while he held still, and could be taken off by moving gantry, and was flight-capable for up to two hours.  His arc reactor no longer bothered him in the slightest; aside from a weekly cleaning, it required virtually no maintenance.
But that was assuming this was even real.  It wasn't, he knew that.  This was half-dream, half-memory.  Yet he felt in control.
He wanted to stay mad at Steve, he really did.  But Steve's deference caught him off-guard, numbed him, and then feeling that sweet mouth moving between his legs, teasing him through the fabric...
The two of them were sitting cross-legged on the bed, plates of food scattered around them, like a pair of kids left alone in a hotel with their parents' credit card.
Steve's breath hitched a little. "Are you still drunk?" he asked, loud enough to be heard over the thrusters. He already felt better now Tony was here; he felt
Although, admittedly, Tony was pretty mad about that, too.  He didn't dislike the trio system but he sure as hell didn't want to be bonded to two men or to another Alpha.
"...I'm pretty drunk," admitted Tony after a few moments.  The alcohol was doing a good job at numbing the pain, but Tony was starting to feel queasy.  He looked over his shoulder at the bathroom mirror, wondering how many others had seen his neck.  His hackles had been raised all night; normally, his hair covered the scar pretty effectively. "You don't think anyone... anyone thinks I'm an acer, right?  I mean, it's... it's obviously not a bite mark... and... and I'm bonded to you. You're the best omega. I obviously like omegas." He winced as Steve worked on dabbing the blood out of his goatee.  Beneath it was the faint scar from when Justin Hammer had bit him on the lip the previous year; Justin, like Pitbull, was on the same level of dominance as Tony, and thus, the two of them couldn't stand each other.  Although Tony was of the opinion that even if Justin were less dominant than him, he would still hate the guy for being an annoying tool.
He put his arms around Steve's neck and pulled Steve over his chest, gently.  "We did win... it's over," he conceded.  "...everything after this should be easy, right?  An interview next week, a psych eval for me the week after that... but the worst of it's over."  He sighed softly, running his fingers lightly over the back of Steve's neck.  "...what do you think Project PEGASUS is?  A flying car or something?" wondered Tony suddenly.  "You think that's what Clint's been doing in New Mexico?  Test-driving a hovercraft or something?"
He had thought that the omega couldn't possibly hurt him and yet he was definitely hurt, internally.  Revealing that mark had done something terrible to him. He was injured, somehow.
"...whew," said Tony weakly.  He reached over and brushed a hand over the back of Steve's neck.  "...let's not accept any more tickets from Malick anytime soon, okay?  ...d'you think Donner is okay?"
He met Tony's gaze almost timidly. "Please," Steve murmured. He didn't want to think about HYDRA, or the winter soldier. Just Tony. "Tell me how to be good for you."
For some reason those words bothered Steve. Like...what other option did he have? Maybe it his forties thinking screwing up his brain. But an omega couldn't risk a bond going wrong. An Alpha could get over it, bond again, but not an omega.  Once bonded, the back of an omega's neck was forever tainted by the scar of the bonding mark. And whilst his Alpha would be focusing on the feeling of his new mate, the omega would still feel  his old Alpha...it was a form of torture. No one wanted to go through it. Steve always thought that the serum made him the exception. That he had been freed from his bond but...but really, Bucky had just grown so distant. And Steve had done nothing. He hadn't been there for him. If anything he'd distanced himself too. It was embarrassing, really. Bucky was the only one who had seen him so needy, so
"...you disapprove of my drinking," said Tony flatly, looking at him.  "I'm getting a vibe... like you're disappointed.  ...you never drank, before the serum?  Whiskey is like super-soldier serum for Starks, you know.  Dad practically embalmed himself.  ...it's not that bad, is it?  I keep an eye on it, you know.  I just need a little, to take the edge off.  ...like how you exercise for like, four hours a day.  Six?  Whatever."
Steve heard the Winter Soldier's footsteps and went still like a wild animal caught in the grass, his fingers clenched in the snow. His cheek was freezing, almost painfully so, but it had woken him up the second he'd fallen to the floor. Whatever he'd just seen hadn't been real, had it? But it was so clear cut and precise. Howard's face had been so sharp and yet he hadn't really been there. Steve hadn't seen that face for seventy years.
the Winter Soldier."  She lifted the hem of her shirt a little.  There was a scar on her stomach.  She locked eyes with Steve.  "I don't even know if he's human, Steve.  It's not him."
inner thoughts) because he felt it would only torture Steve to know he'd been loved all along.  Tony was still convinced that Bucky was dead and Steve was confused about the Winter Soldier. He felt that they should at least stay the fuck away from HYDRA until
"...almost makes me miss basic," said Sam, sarcastically as the young men tussled each other, grabbing Sean and trying to wave Steve over.
Steve's eyes fluttered open and he looked down at Tony at the sound of his name. The look on his face was heady and blissful, his lips parted a fraction. "I'm not stopping you," he assured him, aroused by the way the word
Pepper cocked her head.  An aide handed Tony a cup of ice and he happily began crunching it, pulling out his phone to check his messages.  "What'd you think Tasha wants? Think she's got presents for us?"
Steve blinked. It was Piper from before, but there was no Eric in sight. She didn't look at Tony, just Steve.
He sent Phil the name, asking if he could look her up. He got a reply ten minutes later, after he'd had a shower.
Tony frowned a little.  He was surprised that Steve thought it was a good idea.  He thought it was stupid and had sort of assumed Steve would agreed that it was silly.  Steve was the one who needed support, not Tony.
Sam placed a hand over one ear; he had a headset, Tony didn't.  "Cap, Widow, looks like the power's down. You're cleared. I've got a line of sight on the back door and right now the guards are distracted, you got about five minutes if you want to take it.  There's a keycard on lockdown you can scramble and a double dead-bolt that's going to need forced."
"He was asking to mate me, Nat. I think he had some pretty clear goals in mind. But he's fought Fury before, shot at him-- it's not all that surprising that he automatically went to attack him," Steve said quietly. "And I didn't-- Jesus Christ, I wouldn't sleep with someone who doesn't even know what year it is. I also don't want to be a cheater."
Natasha pushed her hair behind her ear. "Some people are also calling Steve a hypocrite, because you saved him," she said and pulled a face with a small shrug.  "The press really, really likes that ER photo and... well, it shows Steve being cradled by his Alpha.  People are saying he shouldn't have put himself into that position in the first place."
"I don't love you any less," said Tony softly.  "The only reason it bothers me is because it's a reminder that I pushed you away and put you in danger.  That I was a bad Alpha and that I failed to protect you. But it's over and from here on out things are going to be good."
Another round of laughter.  Eric had no story; he had been an obvious Alpha from birth without any big reveal.
Steve leaned into Tony's touch, not noticing if he was gripping him a little tight. The presence of his alpha and touch was comforting and grounding. He sighed softly and let his eyes slip shut. Then they flew open again as Tony bit at his ear and he involuntarily shivered.
He ran his tongue over Steve's head and tasted a drop of precum; he shuddered a little, not sure if he liked it or not.
it. You see me. He doesn't.  And I kneel for you because it's intimate and it feels ngood and I'm not gonna deny that it's part of my instinctive biology. But then so is sex and most people don't do
Steve woke up the next morning after sleeping through most of the day, his sleep cycle ruined by the sedatives and the night awake in the hospital.  The first thing he did was down a load of contraceptives before he woke Tony with a lazy sort of blowjob. They only had sex four times that day (a record low for when Steve was in heat). But it was like Richard had said: the heat was a mild one. It was almost nice, actually. They could appreciate the neediness of it, the rush, but there was no exhaustion, no awkward chaffing and no ruined sofas. Steve still wanted it to be over with quick though. He just wanted to hang out with Donner and Granite already.
is!" snapped Tony, gesturing around.  "I'm an aerospace engineer, not a fuckin' deacon, I don't know how the hell to get out of here, I don't even
Steve couldn't say which sense was tripped next.  There was heat, there was sound, there was light.  For a split second the room was lit up in a halo of light, the only sound was the roar of two repulsors going off at once, the hair-singing heat of the explosion.  Steve, Tony, and Rhodey were all thrown back.  Rhodey smashed into a glass case; Tony slammed into a wall; Steve's shoulder caught a sofa and he was flung against a window that broke on impact.
"--but they also attract trouble.  SHIELD won't tell us about what's going on but we know Rogers is on 24/7 surveillance.  I need an iron-clad guarantee nothing's gonna go down like it did in May."
Tony hopped off the counter. "Can I come in the shower with you?" he asked, voice small, almost child-like.
for me to do that.  I'm Tony goddamn Stark."  He fixed Steve with a smile, his usual confident smirk.
"You have an alibi.  You had an emotional reaction, destroyed your tracker, and spent the day with Banksy and Ty.  Tony's idea. The two of them are both vouching for your whereabouts."
In any case, he figured they had to go back to their rooms to grab their phones.  As much as he didn't want to be bothered, he would rather get a phone call on his cell than have people bringing phones to him like in the spa.
He wasn't angry, exactly.  He was too numb to feel anything, really.  Jarvis, though, had been inconsolable. Tony suspected that, if he didn't exist, Jarvis would have opted to stay at the grave for the rest of his life, like one of those oddly loyal dogs you sometimes read about online, sleeping pressed against the headstones of their masters.
Happy turned in to the McDonald's drivethrough without blinking. This was a common occurrence, then.
"Are you going to come to bed?" Steve asked, and then added, "To sleep. I mean... it's been a long week," he whispered, gaze drifting off to the ceiling.  "There was a point when I thought I would never make it back here again." Steve sighed and closed his eyes. "I forgot how awesome memory foam is."
He came out wrapped in a bedsheet, hair wild.  There was no mistaking what he and Steve had been up to.
"No, it's fine, just keep rolling.  We can cut that out," said Louis quickly.  "Steve, as an omega who served in the military, how did heats--"
"...because his clothes are here," said Natasha, eyeing the pile of ashy cloth.  It was the writing on the wall that convinced her, not the pile of burned textiles, but she didn't want to tell Tony about the wall because she was pretty sure he'd have one of his freak-outs.
"Where are we going for lunch?" Steve asked as they headed down to the garage. He only knew which car they were taking because Tony walked towards it. He followed at his heels, not sure if he'd be driving. He was sure he could manage a car- maybe he wouldn't take it to full speed though.
It had been hell though. A burning kind of hell. Nothing would satisfy him because nothing he could do or simulate was a real Alpha-- was
"That was before the serum," Steve corrected, sounding proud. And he had been. He remembered strutting all around their apartment with bruised knuckles for a whole week and Bucky being absolutely furious with him (but secretly proud, Steve knew, even if Bucky didn't say it).
Steve mumbled something about sleep and Tony felt like that was the most brilliant idea he'd ever heard.  He wanted to sleep so badly; his whole body was screaming for it.
Tony let his muscles relax a little, still on top of Steve, oblivious to the sweat and semen covering them.  "G'night," he said quietly, resting his head on Steve's chest to listen to his heartbeat.
"What, like growing some muscle?  HA!" shouted John. "No, they're good girls, and I like an omega with a bit of spunk!  Good for you, Stark! He's a keeper!"
He ignored his bond-feelings on the plane ride.  By the time they landed he was feeling pretty numb.
"Really?" Steve stared down at the glow through the t-shirt and something warmed in his chest. Was this a big deal? It kinda felt like one. The thing kept Tony alive after all. "And yes, I like the plan. Better to just get it out there," Steve breathed. The thought was a little nerve-racking...there would be so many people there. So many cameras. And suddenly they'd be analysing his and Tony's every move. What if the paparazzi started asking inappropriate questions now? How would Steve even respond to them?
"...both Clint and Phil are perfectly capable of looking after themselves," Steve pointed out. "It makes sense that they would be enthusiastic, you know? I just...if I'm going to shake things up I want to offer some form of compensation. I don't want anyone to get hurt because of me.  I have some money from my PA gig...  I don't know what it's worth, really." A spark of excitement seized in his chest. "I could donate a lot of it. Or I could just create a charity if there isn't one in place. People can do that, right?"
, Pepper recognized that, for someone who had lived through the twenties and thirties, Steve wasn't such a big fan of slasher flickers or electric guitars.  Steve and Pepper both liked lighthearted movies, and Steve was fascinated with modern animation. She took him shopping (something Tony would rather die than do; he had several shirts in his wardrobe that were several decades old) and occasionally dragged him to a concert or art show that she thought they'd enjoy.  Tony was happy to have her around again; she seemed more willing to come by now that Tony was in a stable relationship.
The journey wasn't long. Charlie landed them comfortably. And then they were back in the car with Happy driving them. Charlie gave Steve a small smile as he stepped off the plane. "Good to have you home, Cap," she smiled. Steve offered her a small nod in return.
He was halfway through the kombucha before he felt like he was ready.  He picked his way, barefoot, over the messy front room, wincing when his foot hit a piece of jagged concrete.  "Jarv, any word on those contractors?  This place is a disaster," called Tony.
"Steve means his Alpha thinks it's goddamn fucked up to buy an omega for yourself like they're some kind of dog," Hal said, a lot blunter than Steve was. He winced a little. Hal was used to the conference; it didn't bother her. She could talk about Trickshot and not get upset. But that didn't mean she was afraid to say it how she saw it.
When JARVIS mentioned Steve, Tony dropped the box he was holding and darted out, leaving papers, notebooks, and photos scattered all over the floor.
the crazy one," said DeSoto.  "I'm his second omega... I don't wanna end up like Trickshot.  No way I'm going out. Mr. Stark won me, fair and square, so I'm staying right here.  And-- and if you wanna beat me up you'll just have to do it here.
Hey everyone!  We are only one or two chapters away from OMEGA RISING PART 5: AVENGERS.  I know you guys are fucking excited for that and you totally should be.
Tony's mouth twitched a little.  "A little bit," he conceded, turning slightly to return the kiss.  "M'glad you don't think I'm an ass. Well, I mean, I am, obviously, but not for this."  He rolled over to face Steve. "...you know why omegas originally wore collars?" he asked quietly, suddenly serious.  "I was reading about the history on Wikipedia... it was to protect their necks. Because if you were wearing a thick metal collar, no other Alpha could bond you.  And if you were... if you were sold at auction or force-bonded, and then met an Alpha you actually liked... whose scent appealed to you... it wouldn't matter. You couldn't be rebonded."  Tony's voice had gone quiet. "I mean, it was a way to keep forced bonds intact." Tony lapsed into silence. He was thinking of Boswell and Banksy, who seemed so happy together, but whose bond had been forced.  In all likelihood, Banksy had been sold to Boswell, like a dog or a dressage horse.
He paused for a moment, reflecting.  "Although the auction thing, they can't say that's not fucked up."
Originally he'd done this with Obie.  For a few years. Then he'd done it as a matter of appearances.  Now it was habit. Beneath the earth, his parents were probably long-gone, reduced, at best, to a heap of bones and hair and teeth, like those he'd placed into trays of battery acid when he was a child.  They didn't know he was there for them and they couldn't care, because they were dead.
T'Chaka moved back around to take the seat next to his son, his hands clasped on the table. "Of course, we both know why we're here... but we still appreciate your co-operation Mr Stark and that you found time to meet with us so quickly." Pleasantries, of course. Steve didn't think anyone could turn down an invite from
When Steve's finger slid along his wrist, the soldier's whole body shivered with delight, the hair on the back of his neck rising.
Tony stood a little straighter and held up his hands, waiting for quiet; the crowd was still screaming questions but after a few moments, it died down, and everyone leaned forward expectantly.
.  ...you haven't eaten anything at all, have you?  Come on, let's go get some food in you..." Authoritatively, she took Steve's hand and guided him out of the room.
Were they?  Tony had no way of knowing.  He'd never done this before and Steve... poor Steve had only ever had, what, one or two full heats, ones that he'd suffered through by himself.  Tony remembered suddenly how he'd laughed at Steve's description of himself "suffering" through a heat, back in May. Tony had remembered thinking that spending a few days doing nothing but jacking off sounded great.  Now he realized what Steve meant.
, more just the whole concept in general. It was exhausting and Steve never felt better afterwards, perhaps worse.  He did not understand the 21st century's obsession with therapy.
There was a pause on the phone while Natasha considered this.  "...why do you care who she dates?" asked Natasha finally.
The doors of the other car opened and Phil got out of the driver's seat.  Steve should have known. Clint got out of the passenger's side. He stood there for a moment, frozen.
"Fine!" snapped Rhodey back.  He smoothed down his uniform.  He marched over to the door of the shop, wrenched it open, and stomped upstairs.  Pepper and Steve were consulting each other.
Everyone else was chatting, like this was just a normal business venture; the pizza boxes were passed around, over the tops of cubicles and around desks.  Brent tossed his tie over his shoulder so he wouldn't get sauce on it.
He didn't really believe that nothing was wrong, but he let it drop.  He didn't like talking about feelings.
"I'm sorry," said Tony.  "I'm sorry about what I said, earlier, about you being uppity.  I was angry.  It was... kind of a dick thing to say.  I should have gone after you.  I wanted to, but you were with...
He squinted out the window of the jet.  It was early morning and it looked clear and warm.  He checked his watch. Five minutes to eight.
He tilted Steve's head back and began trickling water over his head and down his back, his expression one of intense concentration.  He'd never cared for another person before and he tackled it with the sort of intensity he usually reserved for electronic problems.
The screen changed to a video.  Steve was smiling in the light of dawn, hair wind-swept by the ocean air, looking tired but content.  Bucky beamed at him, clutching the remote tightly to his chest.
"Well, I still think you should take it easy," Steve sighed. He almost wished he could get drunk with him. He didn't like fooling around with Tony in bed when he was drunk, it made him almost uncomfortable...but then, drunk Tony often took it as rejection, and not Steve being considerate. It got complicated quickly. So it would be much simpler if Steve could get drunk too.
"Because they're degrading, Tony," said Pepper, who didn't look a bit amused with Tony's Socratic line of questioning.
Tony ignored her, making his way heavily up the stairs after Steve.  The nice thing about all this commotion was that it was a very, very good distraction from the upcoming twenty-fifth anniversary of his parents' death.  He'd never quite learned how to cope with it and it still hit him a lot harder than he'd like to admit.
If Tony's actions could be called anything, it would be "waiting."  But what he was waiting for was unclear, even to him. His parents weren't coming back and there would be no closure.
But it hadn't worked out like that.  There were some things you just couldn't get back.  Lesson learned.
"полковник Карпов," he mumbled.  He opened his eyes but everything was blurry.  He tried to reach, weakly, for his Alpha, but his arms were pinned.  He couldn't feel his left one at all, but the right one was tingling with the pain of being tied down too tightly.  "полковник Карпов," he repeated weakly.  He couldn't remember anything but he knew that he could trust Karpov.  Knew that Karpov would take care of him, tell him what to do.
The seven of them made their way toward the stairs; the camera crew was clearing out, looking desperately curious.
Tony stepped out of the shower behind him and Steve half-watched him dress in the mirror with undisguised interest.
Tony ignored her, leading them toward the front of the Expo; firetrucks, ambulances, and police cars had all arrived, even a SWAT vehicle, and the merry fair-goers had dispersed to a safe distance, clearly terrified of the drones.
After thirty years of being bonded, Banksy and Boswell were severed, which could only mean one thing.
The food was gone in just about under fives minutes. It seemed not even getting shot could quell Steve's massive appetite. He sipped at the orange juice a little slower, however. He thought about what Tony was saying, thinking he could figure out what a 'soundbite' was in his head without having to ask (Steve was kind of sick about having to ask about things. Clint told him to just google stuff more, maybe he should.)
"Oh, I remember, alright," chuckled Happy.  "She said, ‘I've got to show Mr. Stark this, right away--’"
Tony rolled his eyes.  “Pepper’s always acting like I’m on death’s door.  Do I look sick to you, Stan?  Give me a break.  I don’t need sleep.”  He looked out the window of the plane, wishing he were out there, flying alongside it.  “...kinda seems like a waste to me, honestly.  Sleep, I mean.  We spend, what, a third of our lives unconscious?  I’d rather be awake.  Living my life.  Instead of wasting it.”
about safe spaces for omegas and felt guilty all over again.  Tony had never before spared a thought for any of these issues.
"But what if he isn't?" Steve whispered. He peered through the door then opened it, leaning in the doorway. Tony looked over his shoulder and met Steve's gave, and the look Steve gave him was enough for the Alpha to
Pepper looked like she wanted to hurl a few choice words at Tony, but instead she turned heel and left, slamming the door behind her.
Natasha arrived before Sam and Tony did.  Her hackles were up and she was oozing with adrenaline; one of the scientists, an older man, had already put his hands on his head in a gesture of surrender.  The other three, however, plunged their hands into their pockets and put something in their mouths.
Tony was doing that thing where he poured out a lot of information all at once and Steve struggled to keep up. He did manage to keep up, mostly. He was honestly more interested in the concept of an entire omega guard than in whether the prince was hitched up or not. He didn't really get the whole mating idea. He just found the idea of them all being fully trained and capable fantastic. "Very neat," he hummed.
Tony trailed after Steve, still oblivious to the water he was dripping everywhere.  He watched the way Steve moved easily. Tony's bedroom was becoming "their" bedroom again; Steve didn't hesitate this time to begin toweling himself off.  Tony sat on the edge of the bed, still in wet boxers, watching him fondly.
Tony grunted again in response, waving a hand weakly at Tiberius.  It was unclear if he was shooing him away or thanking him. Tony's breathing was heavy; Steve was thrusting up slowly, occasionally.  Tony had learned from the last heat that after about 24 hours he was nothing but a dildo for Steve's insatiable appetite. Normally he'd be okay with that idea, except that it was literally physically taxing on him.  And the reminder of their age difference was somewhat unsettling, too.
Tony placed a hand on Steve's arm and pulled him toward the bathroom.  "Brush your teeth," he commanded.  Steve made a little humming noise and obeyed but Tony could tell he was on autopilot.
“Mmm… how about you shuffle things around for me?” asked Tony, not looking up.  He reached out and pushed the tablet away with one finger.  “Eleven is really close to brunch, and I sort of hate morning meetings, so if you could go ahead and change that for me, that would be great.  Is that Americano?  I told you already, Stan.  Espresso.  Not Americano.  I like my coffee like I like my women, strong and bitter.  Go get me another one.”  He swiveled in his chair slightly, playing around on his phone.
About an hour must have passed. Bucky still hadn't moved. Steve was getting worried. The 'lunch break' would be over. How long would it take them to make an inducer that would work on him? Days? Weeks? ....hours? Steve shivered and peered over to see the same blank reflection of Bucky's face in the glass.
"Naw," said Tony.  "Look, Aria, I got this for ya.  I probably remember the words... uh, lemme think...
"Oh, hi," said Tony casually, his hips bucking up to press himself between Steve's legs.  He tilted his head aside and tilted the bottle back.  "...You, um, you're here now. Hi."  He leaned forward suddenly to kiss Steve's nipple, drawing his tongue over it, feeling Steve's skin pebble in response.  His back arched and his whole body moved in to Tony's touch.
miss women," said Tony.  He shrugged a little. "But I flirt for the cameras.  ...Steve, I'm forty years old. I don't have the stamina I did when I was twenty-five.  ...it's just that... after I came back from Afghanistan... I felt like if I didn't keep it up, everyone would... would think something happened.  So I kept going. But no, flirting's just... just part of my reputation." He paused, then said, "Y'know, before you were unfrozen, there was a big story in the news, that I slept with all of 2007's Maxim cover models.  So here's... a big secret. I only bagged five of the thirteen. The others, we just
"C'mon," said Pepper wearily, pulling his arm around her shoulders to drag him out of the crowd.  She nodded to Aria; Aria swooped in to grab Steve.
Fury looked up in time to see the Winter Soldier already practically on top of him.  He was seated, back against the counter, and there was no time to make sure the magazine was in the chamber.  Instead, he cracked the gun as hard as he could against the other man's face.
Steve leaned up a little to watch her go, not even having a chance to respond before the pink cheeked girl had disappeared out the door. He could hear in it her voice, though- the gratitude. His chest warmed a little.
Across the room, Carter had grabbed a needle off the floor, the one they'd tried to hit Steve with earlier, and she jammed it into the neck of the HYDRA agent she was rolling around with.  His eyes went wide and a moment later, he was frothing at the mouth and going limp.
would be an issue, but he guessed it was. He didn't know how he was going to get through to all the omegas in the pen today - the ones up for auction - he could only hope that because they weren't bonded they stood more of a chance of hearing his message. Maybe Steve had to more honest with them. DeSoto had asked about Bucky, but Steve hadn't really told him anything. DeSoto laid to bare everything, even getting shot. Steve could still be more up front with the omegas here... even with the shadow of SHIELD confidentiality hanging over him.
"And Steve is still a soldier," Aria pointed out. Sitwell hummed noncommittally in agreement. "I'm sorry...who are you?" She asked, narrowing her eyes at Sitwell of a sudden. She was in a blue leather jacket today with a high collar that made her look rather menacing as she stared him down.
"What right do I have to tell any of these people that my way of thinking is right, and theirs is just wrong and oppressive?" Steve said and Fred looked confused. Hal looked sympathetic.
"I would love for you to join," Steve whispered and squeezed Tony's hand, his expression sincere and eyes soft. He stepped forward to press a kiss to Tony's forehead, letting his eyes slip shut for a brief moment. "Sorry I just stole some of Happy's clothes... they probably won't be wearable again.  I stretched the shirt out.  But I wasn't gonna work out naked."
Tony's eyes were already open.  "No, no, I'm awake, I wanna party," he protested, flopping out of the car.
"I'm gonna walk out that door in a few hours," said Rhodey, pointing to the door.  "And you can come with me if you want. That's up to you."
in general. Steve moved to run a hand through Tony's hair soothingly, hoping to reassure him. He could sense his unease and the brief hiss of paranoia that underlined it. They sat like that for a while, Tony's face against his chest with his fingers tracing the mark at Steve's nape - the touch was gentle, made him shiver and almost squirm. It felt strangely intimate, just as the moment had been when that mark was made in the first place.
He had no idea what Sam did, other than he was some sort of pilot.  He knew Natasha was all about stealth. He'd seen her and Steve spar before, both of them lightning-fast, her body moving and twisting in impossible ways.
"...slightly more than me," she'd said, and Tony could have sworn he saw a glimpse of sympathy in her eyes.
"I think I'm gonna go sleep," Steve said quietly as he stood, a strange...hollow feeling lingering in his chest. "I just had a flashback, that's all."
"Just a tough pregnancy.  He's actually been puking a lot lately, according to George," said Banksy.  He gestured Tony over then added, in a low voice, "George is still in San Diego and won't be back until tomorrow, and Donner won't shut up about Gideon... we don't know how to keep him here.  If Gideon shows up..." He shrugged helplessly.
"...yeah... sounds good," said Tony, tucking the card away, still trying to get over being shouted at.  Tony rarely lacked confidence, but John was like a living embodiment of a bulldozer. Tony wondered if the omega who worked for him was eventually going to get shouted to death.  Maybe he was used to it; Joan and Maria were clearly immune. They were beaming at Steve; Maria was asking Steve if he would be willing to pick the two of them up for a picture.
"About you, baby.  What else?" he said.  He gave a single, lazy kick, drifting slowly across the pool.  He paused. "...you... you felt it, didn't you? That you were turning me on?  I'm sorry, Steve, I'm trying to be sensitive to all the shit you're going through, but... but I haven't seen in you in the flesh for months and now you're here in my pool and I forgot how goddamned hot you are.  I was just gonna go rub one out but... yeah, no, it's fine." Tony twisted, righting himself suddenly, treading water. "Hey, Steve? Remember how when I asked to see your neck you made me promise not to hate you?  You know I could never hate you for that, right? I mean, you didn't make that decision to accept the mark. Your body did. And it did what it did for a very legit biological reason, which is, let's face it, Barnes is a hell of a lot more dominant than me."
"I mean, I'm trying to run a company, Tony, I'm--"  She stopped dead, frustration arrested temporarily.  "
"He's not due for weeks, Tony, he and I cycled together last time," said Phil calmly.  (He had not told Tony about Bucky waking up and did not plan to; it would only work him up further.)  "Just hold on and let me check, okay? I'm sure where ever he is, he's completely fine and in control of the situation."
"If I was Steve Rogers I wouldn't have mated in the first place," Sitwell said, clearing his throat.
"No, I... I want a drink," said Tony, glancing anxiously at Steve.  He was clinging to Steve's hand a little bit harder than necessary.
Unaware of the tiny drama occurring between Hammer and his PA, Tony managed to ditch Steve and down four drinks in the first fifteen minutes.  He mentally congratulated himself and slipped off to the bathroom.  The drinks had helped take the edge off, and Tony was certain that he'd misread the analyzer earlier in the morning.  19%?  Probably 9%.  It would be easy to think he'd seen a 1.  A 1 was just a straight line, after all.
"No, no-- get off." Steve stumbled back. He couldn't see anything clearly. Just blurry, vague shapes that didn't mean anything. "I need-- I need to call Tony."
He was still stroking Steve's neck, nosing against him, his tongue dragging over the skin to taste him.  Steve's body was like a drug; it was like music; it was the only thing Bucky had ever wanted and at that moment he would have given anything to have it.
"Don't you remember? You wouldn't touch me because you were afraid of hurting me. You wouldn't even stick your tongue in my mouth. And now you've hurt me bad enough that I lost a-- a-- and
"And then...then when I got the serum the bond mark disappeared and I couldn't feel anything. I just assumed that it was because the serum had gotten rid of it, but maybe it just made it look like it did...that's why they want to scan for scar tissue."
It felt different than Tony (duh) but not necessarily in an unpleasant way. It wasn't his Alpha, so it wasn't quite as satisfying, but it did feel goddamn good. It was longer, thicker and its smooth surface was oddly pleasing in its own way. Steve let out a stuttered breath as Tony moved it inside of him, his hands fishing in the sheets as he moaned.
"Omega," clarified Natasha, her eyes eyeing him sharply, her gun still trained on the older scientist, even though his hands were still on his balding head.  "In the east, we say bears and rabbits."
"On it, Cap'n," Lawrence assured him with a small nod before heading down the same steps they only just come up from.
Gleason was getting out more wipes from his bag, presumably to clean Steve up down there. "How does it feel?" he asked as he pulled on a new set of gloves.
."  Tony played with Steve's waistband.  "As if some interview is more important that pleasuring my omega," he scoffed, leaning forward to brush his lips to Steve.  "I love you, Stevie... love how you blush... love that wholesome, all-American nice guy thing you've got going..." He slipped his arms over Steve's shoulders and traced the bite mark on the back of Steve's neck.  "Almost makes me want to behave myself... almost..." he purred.
"Anyone who wanted to assassinate you would have to be pretty elaborate about it.  You're Captain America," pointed out Tony.  "...no, it's not like an interview.  It's more like a mini press-release.  There might be one or two questions that we pre-arrange.  And yeah, I'll be there.  C'mon, Rogers, I'm like a bad penny.  I'm everywhere."  He watched Steve picking away at the crumbs.  The guy ate like five meals a day and still always acted ravished.  "...it'll be easy.  You and me will sit on the couch together, holding hands, and say something heroic, like... well, remember that Marley quote I told you about?
Ellis beckoned a woman over. She had blonde short hair, green eyes and a green dress to match. She looked absolutely terrific. She was an omega and smiled sweetly as she offered her hand.
Tony rolled his eyes.  JARVIS's program, left alone, tended to evolve.  It was, after all, a learning program; when left alone, JARVIS, "bored," would scour the internet for any and all data.  He had no interest in any one particular piece of information; information was information to him. Tony could go into his code and see what he was "looking" at, and it ranged from top-secret, classified files lifted from the Pentagon, to information on the dietary habits of the black-chinned hummingbird, to translations of the Brady Bunch theme song in every available language.
"Doing it for you, huh?" Steve echoed, voice still soft like he knew just how wild he was driving Tony. Then his expression shifted a little, becoming more sincere. "I trust you, too," he whispered just so Tony could hear it.
"I want food," Phil announced downstairs from his den, much to everyone else's surprise. "And then I want a shower."
In the bedroom, Tony had dragged Steve's pillow over his head, not wanting to leave the comfort of the bed just yet.  He rolled over to where Steve had been moments before.  It was still warm.  He buried his face into Steve's pillow with the softest moan of delight.
"You have no idea." The car started and Steve instantly felt nervous. How did he really know he could trust these people? He didn't.
"I'll make my own way now, thanks," Steve said to Mike, clearly not meaning it, as he stepped out of the elevator and towards the corner where Malick's car was.
JARVIS let him through and he stepped into the lab, setting the pizza down on a workbench as he scoured the chaos for his mate. "Tony?"
Tony dipped down and ran his tongue over Steve's entrance.  Steve was still slick, and his wetness tasted not at all dissimilar to a woman's; Tony tugged Steve a little closer and began lapping at his hole, closing his eyes contentedly as he ate Steve out.
It was no surprise to either of them when they woke the next morning to find it even more swollen.  Tony's first complaint was that he wouldn't be able to work in the shop with his hand so thoroughly out of commission.
But life was too short for regrets and so Tony didn't dwell on it much.  It was just as well that he couldn't have children; he was terrified he might end up like his father, treat them the way he had been treated.
"Who am I to deny the people what they want?" said Tony happily.  "Didja see me take down that asshole in Monaco, Jules?  Iron Man is like the Highlander, there can be only one.  ...that's the Highlander, right?  That there's only one of?  Jules, this is Stan--"
Tony reached out to grab a glass of champagne from the omega's tray; he'd sobered up considerably during Richard's talk and he was regretting that immensely.
"Starkspangled doesn't sound like a real name," Steve said, still confused but he figured Tony knew what he was doing. He'd been debriefed on things like Twitter before going undercover but his job had had nothing to do with it, and in the course of the last few months, he'd forgotten almost everything and learned nothing new.  The deluge of information about the 21st century meant he had to pick and choose what was important, and Twitter didn't seem like an important thing.
A woman next to him nodded fervently.  "Ashtray fought against his bond and one year he just didn't show up anymore.  What do you think happened to him, hm? Do you think he went to
There was a long pause on the other end.  "...what do I do, Steve? I can't go home if there's men waiting for me.  And George is in San Diego at one of those schools," said Donner. "Do I just... just keep waiting here at the bus stop forever?"  He sounded genuinely frightened.
Tony, already attuned to Steve's feelings, could feel his gut wrenching.  His eyes were actually watering.
She smiled.  "Hi, Captain.  Thanks," she said, her voice perfectly normal, not at all the giggling, hypnotic tone it had been back in July.
Tony flashed Pepper a stupid grin; she pressed her lips together.  She was wearing a long sweater-dress and clutching a binder (a schedule of some sort, no doubt; she loved schedules) and looking more than a bit frazzled.  She'd probably been dealing with Hammer for at least an hour, by the look at it.
I have feelings... I mean... he's cute, he's fun, he's smart, he's qualified, he's proud, he's..."  Tony blinked.  "...okay, a small crush, maybe just... a very little, tiny, itty-bitty crush.  That's all.  Look, we'll fire him, we'll get a beta..."
In fairness, they were probably somewhat disconcerted by both Bucky and Steve being in their underpants.
Tony tried to sip the coffee.  There was no alcohol in it.  Tony felt a stab of annoyance at Steve.  He held out the coffee.  "I don't want this," he snapped.  He flopped down onto the pillows.  "...I'm sorry, Steve.  I'm not mad at you.  I'm mad at... myself, I guess. I dunno."  Tony reached out for Steve's hand, finding it, lacing their fingers together.  He gave Steve's hand a squeeze, feeling even more guilty for snapping at his omega.
"How... sweet," Steve said, entirely unconvinced that that was the real reason...because they cared? Ha. No way.  More likely, they cared about how Steve's public persona affected SHIELD's public credibility.  Steve was used to being used as a mascot.
"I really wouldn't put it past them Tony," Steve muttered. He had to just go check. What if they went down in twenty minutes and found a kid who'd just been freshly mutilated? They'd feel terrible. Steve couldn't risk it.
"Right, yeah, that's Steve's.  We wanna keep that," said Tony.  "Just clean it off and put it away."
Tony patted Steve's hand.  "Thanks, Ty," he said, and hung up.  He was glad Steve was excited, but he couldn't help but feel worried.  The guy had been in and out of camps since 2002, and before that, had been exchanged between private owners... he'd spent, what, twenty years being tortured?  Who the hell knew what he was like after that? Tony hated himself for thinking it, but part of him wondered if it would be better if he were dead.
Tony frowned a little, his hand still on Steve's cheek.  "...but how is that different than forced bonding, Steve?  Isn't that what Barnes did? Took what he wanted?"
"Phil's fine," said Phil, sitting down next to Steve.  He seemed to pick up on the weird smell, too.
"You can't fix the world Steve," Phil breathed. "Take down one auction house, another crops up. You know how it goes.  Besides, in most of these cases, omegas won't press charges.  As you said, they're brain-washed.  The omegas in those sorts of places oppress themselves and we can't tear apart the network if they don't cooperate."
"Of course.  One of the famous Stark New Year parties," said Stone, casting a glance around the large, airy living room, still half-buried in orchids.  Stone was a tall man, clean-shaved, who wore a pair of stylish square glasses. His suit was cream-colored and matched with a silk navy tie. But it wasn't his style that Steve noticed, or even his face, which was conventionally quite attractive.  It was his smell. He smelled completely and utterly
The second he was out the door Keisha was on him. "Captain, please get in the chair, we only have five minutes." She ushered him way, shooting Banksy an annoyed but fond look.
Tony rearranged his face into a pleasant but less gleeful smile and threw an arm around Steve's shoulders.  "Our first Christmas together? It's gonna be
"More likely it's Tony, feeling guilty for the way he's been treating Steve the last month," growled Natasha.
Natasha threw her legs around one of the guards and brought him down the heel of her hands onto the back of his head; he dropped, and she kicked off him, running down the hall toward the cells.
"I did?  Great!" said Tony.  He'd rubbed shoulders with Ellis on a number of occasions and found him to be likeable.  He was a moderate Republican whose policies were most focused on economics.  If Stark Industries still produced weapons, they would have benefited greatly from his defense spending.  Ellis and his veep, Rodriguez, were both betas; it occurred to Tony that they were being invited in an effort to garner political support from the minority population of Alphas and omegas.  Having only ever met Ellis for business, it felt weird to suddenly be called on for a social issue.  Tony wasn't sure he was the right guy to sit down and talk about that stuff, but he figured Steve would take the helm and he could go ahead and get ragingly drunk.  The White House had an impressive open bar that Tony had decimated on four separate occasions.
"...being an Avenger might help you burn off all that excess energy you don't know what to do with," Steve pointed out as he set his cup down and picked up a fork. "Help you settle down a little.  SHIELD certainly got people like Nat on the right path. And it helped Sam with his grieving."
"Can you send Coulson?" asked Sam.  "Uh-huh... yeah, I'd say the perimeter's secure, I've got my tech, too, so he's not going anywhere..."  He covered the phone. "Fury's on his way. They're going to try to contact Phil."
Tesseract was, but based on context, it was probably some sort of top-secret facility or some type of top-secret equipment.  Tony was idly sketching a tesseract on a spare sticky note while he watched the screen.  He thought hypercubes were pretty cool; tesseracts tessellated Euclidean space, and in the same way a person could fold out a cube into squares, a four-dimensional hypercube could be folded out into eight squares.  Tony was already scribbling the proof out, just for fun.  Eight hyperplanes, with four of the cubes meeting at each vertex... Tony wondered if whoever had named "Tesseract" had appreciated what an awesome mathematical principle they were referencing, or whether the code name had just been pulled out of a hat.
Tony bit his shoulder anyway, just because he'd asked.  He bit until he tasted blood, then pulled away. He regretted it after he'd done it; now, with the mark on Steve's shoulder, he could compare it to the one on his neck and see how different they were.  And besides, Steve's body would just heal the shoulder-mark in like twelve hours anyway, so what was the point?
"That's a remarkable insight," said Tony.  It was unclear if he was being sarcastic or not, even to him.
"Oh, my gosh, really?  ...okay, you can blame Dave on that one, he made the pamphlets.  POSSV stands for Partners of Survivors of Status Violence."
The first one was Tony at his work bench, brow knotted together in concentration as he worked on something small with his hands. The second one was of Happy, beaming and being his usual self, hand raised in a peace sign. The third one was of Pepper, reaching up to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear as he scrolled down her tablet. The fourth was of Rhodey, giving a mock salute at someone out of his line of vision. And the fifth was of Tony and Steve together. It was a picture Pepper had taken from Steve's birthday... they were both looking at each other and smiling, their noses almost touching. It was a sweet moment and they weren't aware they were being watched.
"The Avengers aren't stupid," Steve said, the rest of them showing no signs of leaving anytime soon. "I recommended you join strongly, actually. In my report."
Pietro sighed, trying not to look irritated.  Bucky was obsessed with the idea of Cleveland, even though it had been explained to him, over and over, that Karpov was not there.
But the soft music and the warmth of Steve's body was mollifying.  Tony leaned into him, closing his eyes, the two of them swaying idly.
taking that away from him. He nodded and gestured for Phil to lead on. Natasha moved to step in line next to him.
Phil had been the last one to leave the room and he winced at Brennan's yell through the door.  He looked back to the hall, turning his attention toward several sheepish-lookig agents and a very feral Tony still growing at Maria. He sighed and leaned against the  door. Nick remained unreadable as ever. They briefly locked gazes.
Tony was too distracted to be trying to listen.  He was looking at Pepper lovingly while she crammed him into the back of the SUV.
Aria and Pepper disappeared together once they had passed Tony and Steve off to the hairdressers.  Outside, Aria stood leaning against a box with a cigarette loosely held between two fingers. The boys were the studio's problem now until they went live in forty minutes. "Has he always been like this?"
There were no dreams; his body's exhaustion had gone beyond that of his mind, and he slept like the dead for nearly sixteen hours before he woke up, mouth dry, hands quivering with the need for a drink, feeling groggy and weird.
The audience looked deeply uncomfortable with this shockingly candid, confessional-style eulogy that touched so heavily on omega rights.  Most of them probably had no idea that Banksy and Boswell were arranged.
"My behavior has nothing to do with that," he assured him, watching the doctors disappear out the door. "And it doesn't suck, I guess. I mean. I need it, don't I?" Steve tried to keep his voice neutral, shoving his hands into his hoodie. Steve leaned against the counter. Tony still stank of sex.
"You're not helping me."  Tony leaned over, pinching the bridge of his nose with exasperation.  And also to try not to breath in too much of Steve's smell.  It was intoxicating.  "You're sure it's not a heat-related thing?"
Steve didn't want to talk about any of that. It was personal. Bonding was a private matter, and maybe it was because he was old-fashioned, but he didn't think it was for discussion in the public sphere. Or maybe Steve just didn't really like people thinking about what him and Tony did in bed and how 'un-captain-like' that was.
"I care about how people see you too, you know," said Steve sincerely, and he squeezed Tony's hand gently.
"He's part of an older generation," said Tony.  "...Alphas in your day were like that. But they're a dying breed.  Come on, think about Banksy and Ty. The world's changing, Steve, and you're here to see it happen."  He leaned his head on Steve's shoulder as the car pulled away, leaving the angry crowd behind.
He followed, toweling his hair off.  He felt thoroughly refreshed from his morning nap.  Steve seemed to be doing better, too. The news about Donner had put a damper over the house, a little stormcloud of worry... but knowing that in a few short days they would take care of it, that a plan had been put into motion, was encouraging.
The recruits fell quiet then, clearly not knowing what to say. This probably wasn't how they imagined meeting him would be like, Steve figured but he was not in the mood for niceties. He could see all the questions in their eyes that they were too polite to ask and he had no intention of answering them.
Gleason ran a hand over his face. "Well he wasn't 'fine.' It looks like he was... with some rather unkind people. There's bruising on his neck and his sides. There's especially dark fingerprint marks on his left thigh. They must be very painful. We did a rape kit, but it looks like it'll come back clean.  So there's nothing we can do there...if he thinks anything wrong has been done to him, he's not saying anything about it. Or even admitting it to himself. It might be easier this way.  Nothing broken, no permanent damage done.  So at least there's that."
"Excuse me, thanks, coming through," said Tony, ignoring their questions with obvious delight at getting them riled up.
"When I'm with him... it's terrifying. My instincts kick in. I don't even know who I am anymore," Steve admitted softly.
The man laughed deep in his throat. The low sound rumbled in his chest. "I always did like them with some fire," he breathed, his smile sickly.  His accent was Russian.
"Yes but only because I was trying to get some work done, I'm very behind, why didn't you tell me about Wakanda--"
Sitwell was seated at what was left of the marble breakfast bar in the center and Aria was currently plating up a full English breakfast for each of them. Steve really didn't pay her enough. And then there was a man Steve didn't recognize. He looked like someone who could actually handle Steve in a fight, well built and strong. He was sure they sent him with that intention.
For Tony, who viewed the world as an elaborate equation, the temptation to count them had been enormous.  But this was his one, small act of defiance, of defining his abuse in a way that made him feel like he had some small bit of control over it.  They had made their tally as a reminder. Tony refused to be remained. He refused to quantify it. To him, numbers were an irresistible comfort, a constant certainty that never wavered.  But in this one, single instant in his life, he refused to acknowledge the numerical fact of what had happened. He had called them chicken pox scars so many times that he almost believed it himself.
. Jesus. Captain America didn't beg to anyone. Steve could feel himself heating up. He wanted to take off his waistcoat. He wanted to take off goddamn everything. Shit. It had been too long since he'd experienced this. "If you just keep me locked in my own cabin then it'll be fine," Steve said. "I've dealt with worse."
He dusted his hands off on his pants and picked up a piece of fried fish.  Tony, Pepper had once told Steve with annoyance, ate everything with his hands that couldn't be sucked through a straw.  She said it was a combination of Tony being a tactile person and also liking to bother other rich people with his refusal to act posh or snooty.  As could be expected, Tony began peeling away the fried part to check out the fish, eating the batter separately.
He'd settled down on the floor with a welding mask and was staring the construction of what would someday be the Mark VII but was currently only a conceptual heap of scrap metal.  Nonetheless, Tony found the slow process of twisting metal to his will to be a calming process.
"Steve, where are you?  Is Tony there?  I know he's not at home because Happy just went over to find him.  Is he okay?  ...Steve?" demanded Pepper.  There was neither anger nor confusion in her tone, yet.  Just pure professionalism.  Being Tony's PA for a decade had left her with a perfect poker face and voice to match.
Steve was outside, squinting up at the clear, California sky.  He looked up when he heard the door open. It was Sam, not Tony.
but it can take longer... six, eight months, even."  He took Steve's hand.  "...so we'll have to get Mark the lawyers and the money personally, if he's already three months along.  Is what I'm saying," he finished.  The only thing Tony hated more than getting involved in personal affairs was doing nothing.  He intended to get the kid help, anonymously, and leave it at that.
Tony made a mental note to call Clint discreetly and ask him, as an omega, if there was anything Steve expected that Tony was missing.  He only got one shot at this and he'd already messed up a bunch of times; he wanted to make sure that the rest of it, at least, was perfect for his mate.
Tony finally caught it.  There was a long horizontal scar on her neck.  Faint, thin, surgical. She was wearing perfume.  And Tony suddenly remembered Lydia and realized that this woman was not a beta at all.  She was an omega. Or at least... she had been, once.
Tony settled down into one of the leather seats of the plane with a groan of gratitude, hunched over his McDonald's burger.  "Clint's a lovable dork. He's like a super-spy. Spec ops, basically. He's bonded to his partner; her name's Natasha."
Dr. Brennan's gaze traveled back to Steve.  "...I've been given access to all your files to help me in my assessment."
"Well I don't know what's going to happen, do I? Some of them look...scary," he finished, staring out at the Alphas practically leering in. Seven looked very out of his depth. The paternal part of Steve wanted to pick him right up and carry him out of here already.
Gleason nodded and walked around, frowning a little as he peeled back the bandage to study his neck.
Tony tried to shake her out of his head, changing the topic as he held out his key fob, unlocking the Aston Martin with a chirp.  "So.  Steve.  What's on the agenda for today?  What's a typical SHIELD agent get up to?  X-Files-type stuff, right, aliens, killer robots..."  Steve looked confused.  "...The X-Files was a show with two agents named Mulder and Scully who debated over the existence of aliens despite investigating paranormal stuff every week, most of which turned out to be aliens," explained Tony.  "That's probably another thing you should Google when you have the time..."
Steve sighed when he felt Tony's hard on against him and rocked back against him. He moaned quietly, invitingly. "Please, please... Tony. I need it," he whined. He cant his hips up as Tony tried to push him, encouraging him to line up with Steve. It hurt when he first pressed in, not a lot, but it did. Steve grunted low in his throat as Tony pushed deep inside of him.
"Very nice, Tony," said Tiberius with a roll of his eyes.  "Hi, Steve." He kept a respectful distance. "Hello, David."
He had wondered, all weekend, what the bedroom lives of these Alpha-omega pairs were like.  Were the omegas are dopey and docile in bed as they were in public? Was sex just a chore to them?  Tony couldn't imagine any of them in heat, frankly.
The rest of the meal was thankfully without drama. The plates were cleared away and they moved into a drawing room for drinks and coffee. Steve just wanted to go home. But home was a plane journey away. Even Irshad snapping at some big business Alpha about equality in the workplace wasn't enough to make him smile right now.
Steve whipped around to see Justin on the stage, his left cheek slowly turning purple. His eyes narrowed and he stalked towards him. The crowd was running past Steve and, thankfully, slowly thinning out.
He wanted to tell her, so badly. About Barney's location being kept from Clint, and Gideon's involvement.  But he'd made a promise to Phil. And Steve knew, he
"Steve is with Tony. That's who he wants to be with. No one else," Aria said slowly as she moved back to take her seat again. "It's not a trio. His ex is screwing things up."
Steve's run was much  like the others. He ran along the beach and back again and would usually run until he felt satisfied. It would take hours and hours to tire him like this. One other male runner along the beach stopped him at one point for a selfie but that was all and Steve was left relatively undisturbed. It was peaceful.
Steve sighed fondly as Tony just took the shield anyway. Maybe once the performance was over he could get Tony to sleep and eat. Or he could at least hope.
"Pleasure to meet you. Hi. Hi." Steve shook everyone's hands and grinned when Judy gave him a wink. "I was hoping maybe I could help with some of the setting up. I saw you were still putting some tents up at the other end and I'm pretty good at heavy lifting. Oh! And I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch your name?"
"Sure, babe," said Tony, watching Steve with concern.  He was a bit nervous about lying down with Steve, considering Steve had just thrown a cup across the room and also attacked him earlier.  But he emphasized with the flashbacks and he was feeling depressed about how Christmas Eve was turning out... not to mention Pepper's rejection.
Tony made a noise of approval as Steve wiggled his hips down; he responded the way he knew Steve wanted, working his fingers into him, interrupting Steve's gasp of pleasure with more kisses.  The two of them found each other's rhythm quickly, automatically syncing up their bodies' movements.
And more than a bit angry.  Steve had jumped to sterilization without even consulting him.  Tony had wanted that, earlier, and Steve had fucking vetoed it... oh, but if it was for
And besides.  Fury's last orders had been for Steve to get away.  There was nothing more Steve wanted than to get away.  He wanted to go to the farthest corner of the earth, see if he could outrun the last two hours in the hospital, the sound of the doctor's voice.  "And you...
Steve tilted his head and then shrugged. "Yeah, I mean, I'd say this was going about... exactly how I intended it to."
Tony nodded, trying to stave off his feelings.  What the hell was wrong with him? Was he getting sick?  Was that it? He was used to some pretty bad hangovers, but this... this was different.  This was worse. Tony struggled to sit still and not let his teeth chatter as the people in the room around him reassured him that the mark changing didn't mean his relationship had to.
"Yeah?  Maybe you can mate my omega for me.  Everyone else has," snapped Tony, trying to wring the liquid out of his shirt.  Pepper cringed.
He let out a frustrated whine, his teeth digging into Steve's flesh.  His mind was spinning. Could he tear the suit off? No, probably not.  The suit wasn't designed to be torn apart. It wasn't designed to be pulled out without the gantry; he was bolted in and there was absolutely nothing to could do.  There was absolutely no practical way for him to mate Steve.
"...did you... ah... do you go to a lot of pubs back in the day?" asked Tony casually.  "They hadn't changed much, I'm guessing, aside from the flatscreens."
"PTS-- hell, call it whatever you want.  You want to let me make you breakfast?  I can make an omelette or something," offered Tony.  He desperately wanted to do better, make up for the last two months.
"Looking good, captain!" Happy greeted him enthusiastically. He grasped Steve's shoulder with a warm smile but there was something else in his eyes, something new. He was no doubt appalled at Steve being undercover; he was almost as protective over Tony as Pepper and Rhodey were. But unlike them he was entirely too polite to say it.
Howard's next words were garbled again and the film jumped slightly.  Howard reached out and his hand touched the small of Jarvis's back, gently guiding him.  Jarvis glanced over his shoulder with a smile; Howard smiled back and leaned forward.  They shared a brief, tender kiss.
Boswell looked exhausted.  Granted, it was the middle of the night and they had called up on rather short notice, but still.  Boswell looked
"Miss Potts, Mr. Stark would like a beverage in the kitchen but Captain Rogers would also appreciate it if you could avert your gaze away from their... predicament." The AI almost managed to sound amused.
Steve listened quietly, feeling considerably less giddy from their conference exit after hearing Clint's story. "I won't look for him. That's your call to make," he murmured.
"I know," Tony murmured back.  He avoided Steve's gaze, looking down at his hands instead, fiddling with them.  Tony preferred his hands to be busy.  He wished he were building something.  Or playing guitar.  Hell, he would knit if he had to.  Sitting here like this, doing nothing, was driving him crazy.  "...you will," added Tony.  He hoped Steve would, anyway.  He wanted to trust Steve so, so badly, against all reason, even after two massive betrayals in a single week.  He loathed himself for feeling so close to Steve.  The only other person he felt this way with was Pepper and she had earned it after a decade of unwavering service to him.  The only thing Steve had done was let Tony bite his neck.  And yet, here they were, stuck together.
Tony, Steve, Pepper, Aria, and two of Steve's buddies from 84 had gathered in Tony's house, mostly because of Tony's inability to get up any earlier than nine in the morning.  They wanted to touch base with Rhodes before sending him out to get Donner. Beforehand, there was a meeting with Gene. If it didn't go well, he could probably kiss meeting Donner good-bye.
"You're gonna be on SNL?" A few heads turned at the sound of Donner's voice. Going by his facial expression Steve guessed he liked that show.
"...and here you're already helping me find him," said Fury, glaring at Steve.  "Come on, hurry it up, let's go--"
They lapsed into silence again, and Steve closed his eyes once more, appreciating her touch almost as much as her lack of questions.
Under the table, Tony found Steve's hand and gently squeezed it.  Steve's expression was neutral but his fists were clenched under the table.
"How about we go get some pizzas?" Steve suggested, squeezing Tony's hand lightly. He wanted to steal a moment alone with him to find out what he really thought.
, where the heck is he..."  He hiccuped and then laughed, rolling his head against Steve's chest affectionately.
"I get that you're pissed at me. But if I hadn't told Director Fury you had palladium poisoning you would probably be dead already," Steve pointed out. "And after the way you--" He waited for Phil to walk past. "After the way you
"I'm fine." Steve huffed and ran a hand over his face. "I'm fine Nat, really...you don't need to worry about me." He glanced over at Tony and frowned at how forlorn the Alpha looked.
But he managed to get through the meeting with Gene relatively easily.  There was only one moment where Rhodey panicked slightly; Tony's name came up during a casual conversation about the AU conference.
He studied Steve's face.  Steve was avoiding his gaze but it wasn't a submissive posture.  It was... something else.  Tony's words of comfort didn't seem to be having any effect at all and Tony couldn't understand what the problem was.
"Did I mention I missed you like crazy?" asked Bucky, standing up.  Steve had gotten taller. A lot taller. They were eye-to-eye. Maybe Bucky had an inch on him, but he was no longer
"Considering your very recent trauma, I find it a little concerning you decided to go to that conference, as well," said Dr. Brennan.  "Being surrounded by a hundred hostile Alphas seems, frankly, self-destructive. I think we need to talk about that."
After they'd dropped off Donner, Happy drove them to the nearest emergency room without waiting for them to ask him to.  The rest of the night was sucked up into a series of X-rays and resetting of one of Tony's fingers.  One of the nurses brought Steve a coffee and gave an affectionate eye-roll. "...even the great Tony Stark gets into feral fights, huh?" she said.  She was also an omega, a tough one. "I swear, you should see the sorts of ridiculous injuries that Alphas come in here with, all the time... and they always say the same thing.  'I won, you should see the other guy.' Like that is all that matters to them... ugh,
Pepper's voice left no room for negotiation.  Tony dropped it, looking sour. He knew that there was no point in arguing.  At least he could say, truthfully, that he liked all the bodyguards. Except maybe Bethany.  Well, no, that wasn't true, he liked Bethany a lot. Too much, actually. He'd slept with her years ago, had a whirlwind affair, been briefly engaged (for literally less than twenty-four hours), released a sex tape with, and gotten into multiple out-and-out drunken fistfights, some publicly, before finally breaking up.  Tony hadn't seen her in over a decade and could only conclude that Pepper's inclusion of her on guard detail was probably some sort of petty revenge. They'd never gotten along. Probably because they were both redheads and Tony frequently dropped hints about which one was his "favorite" in the hopes of sparking a sexy catfight.  The catfight never happened, but not for lack of trying.
"Tony. Tony look at me." Steve knelt down in front of him and reached up, putting his hands on top of Tony's and encouraging him to meet his gaze. He'd seen this before, he knew what this was. "I'm not going anywhere. I love you. And you are
One thing at a time.  He couldn't honestly worry about Bucky, not while Vanko and the Winter Soldier were lurking around.  They needed taken care of first.
"Hi.  Sorry.  I'm a huge fan.  Sorry, you probably get that all the time, it's just that I'm a huge fan.  Can I shake your hand?"
His phone chimed a few times; he ignored it because it would be chiming all day with birthday wishes.
Happy offered Tony a brown paper bag; Tony pulled a styrofoam container out of it and a pair of chopsticks.  "Nong La?" he asked.
And Tony, who had spent the first several decades of his life struggling to get the approval of Alphas more powerful than him-- first his father, then Stane-- soaked up the positive attention like a sponge.  Being Iron Man was worth dying for because people finally loved him, approved of him.  It filled a hole in his heart.  Tony found himself laughing at the irony.  Now he had an
of what I want to do! How come you'll argue with me now, somehow you don't even know, but not your own mate? If you don't want to fight, then why the hell do you do it?"
"A toddler, sort of," Natasha pointed out. It was all a bit overwhelming. Clint looked so happy and domestic and nothing like an agent and a secret super-assassin. He just looked like a normal guy, with his wife and kids and... like a beta man would... how did Natasha fit into all of this? Steve had so many questions.
He knew the first time he'd seen a hypercube on paper though.  It was in his father's notes.  He had seen it, then, as a mere curiosity.  Now he was wondering.  If Howard was in SHIELD... and SHIELD had this thing... then surely...?
"Sure.  We can do nine-thirty," said Chantelle; Tom was nodding behind her.  "Well, good luck on your scenting. Donner, you make sure you listen to Dr. Emmett and be good, okay?"
"Come here," he murmured, pulling Steve against him, into his lap.  Steve moved with him fluidly, responding to every little touch, eager to please, eager to obey.  Tony made sure Steve was settled against him before reaching down, wrapping one hand around his length, groping Steve's entrance with the other.  Steve was wet; Tony gently worked two fingers into him, feeling his body twitching around his digits.  "...good boy..." he whispered into Steve's ear.  This felt... right.
Steve looked up to see George peering at the back of his neck not-so-subtly. The omega quickly looked away, trying to be polite but Steve knew what he was looking at. He must have noticed that the marks had changed-- that Tony's was just as prominent as Bucky's now. Perhaps he was curious about his own chances of being able to bond with another Alpha.
He was willing to ask permission and get on his knees and grovel if that's what it took to keep Steve close to him.  He wasn't sure where this sense of longing was coming from or how the hell to get rid of it.  He was operating largely under gut feelings and hoping that that was sufficient to lead him to where ever this crazy train was taking him to.  It seemed like the more time he spent around Steve, the more his brain was screaming at him to hold and caress and protect and nurture and
Tony lowered his voice, just in case.  "Dude. I'm so curious about this thing with the auctions, with like, Ashtray and stuff.  Don't you wonder where they went? If
"People are saying it was arranged.  That, like, the government sort of... orchestrated it," explained Tony.
"I...I don't like fighting with you," he murmured. "But I'd rather you say it than keep it all bottled up inside of you."
help," Steve pointed out, frustrated as ever. It was frankly ridiculous. There were bigoted Alphas everywhere; was Tony going to fight every one of them on the floor? Or was this still about the fact that Hammer had hit on him last time they'd met?
Tony paused, feeling like he'd misunderstood.  "Excuse me?" he prompted when T'Chaka didn't elaborate.
Natasha glanced down at her phone for a moment to text Clint.  He was the only one on the team she knew for a fact had experience with inducers and figured Steve might need someone to talk to, once he woke up.  She knew that, in all likelihood, Steve had probably gotten his neck patched, gotten fucked, and was going to crash for at least a day. She huffed a little.
Arcadia rolled her eyes at Tony as they passed him. "Seriously? How do you even put up with that? You really are a goddamn saint, Rogers," she said, squeezing Steve's arm as they slipped into the kitchen. There was a lot people in the kitchen, still, but it was considerably less crowded. Steve stared down at the 'Smarties' in his hand and remembered Aria's instructions.  He dropped them into his pocket instead of taking them.
During their last heat, they'd ended it with a mutual understanding not to mention anything that had happened.  Not that they didn't have regular, aggressive, dirty sex. It was just that during heat, it cranked everything up to 11.
"...see?  See how you inspire people?  She was an omega, too," murmured Tony into Steve's ear, his breath hot.  He nuzzled against the side of Steve's face.  "...so... proud..." he whispered, barely audible, his fingers ghosting along Steve's collarbone.
The asset's head snapped up so fast it hurt.  "Colonel?" he said, looking around hopefully. He blinked in confusion.  He was in a bathtub in the empty house. There was no water, and he had no memory of coming here.  How long had he been out? Had he been asleep, or just... waiting. "Colonel?" he repeated, getting up and stalking out.
"So they're going to take lots of pictures of us?" Steve asked in a murmur, rinsing out the last of the soap. He was surprised at how unbothered he was by the thought of having his picture taken. Steve just wanted to be there with Tony... the rest didn't matter.
to prove this to SHIELD. He needed to prove that he was still capable, that he was still Captain America.  That one little ambush and one little miscarriage had not compromised him.  "I want to hit back. I want to show them they can't just try and take me and suffer no goddamn consequences."
any more kids down here, but if you really cared about him at all, you wouldn't try moving him.  He's on bedrest until Thursday." (It was Monday.)
Natasha saw an opportunity and took it.  Steve was in no condition to be by himself and she didn't want to let him go without a fight.  Lightning-fast, she plucked his cell phone from his back pocket and took a step back.  "...it's from a blocked number," she reported, holding the phone hostage.  "I'll give you the phone, but please, Steve.  Please don't lock yourself away.  Or at least let me lock myself in there with you.  I'm worried about you."  The phone continued to ring in her hand.
"I have a theory," said Tony suddenly.  Natasha didn't say anything, so Tony continued.  "Steve's suddenly feeling...
accept your mistakes, which is why all we're asking for is for an apology to the prime minister of Yemen, instead of throwing you in jail!"
do it?  Back in his own century, every omega wanted to bear whelps for their Alpha.  Steve had, too.  Throwing away a baby seemed wrong to him.  But how the hell could he have a baby in this day and age, when he didn't know a damn thing?  When he barely understood how the world around him worked?
Behind him, he could hear Boots and the Chocolate Tree wishing each other Happy Best Friends' Day; his jaw clenched.  "
"Domestic bliss," said Natasha sarcastically.  Yet Steve couldn't help but notice the fond way she looked at Lila, the softness in his eyes he'd never seen before.
"Technically," Steve said. He wasn't even sweating, not a hair out of place. He was perhaps a little breathless (which was abnormal for the super soldier) but that was all.
"We're not going to let anyone beat us, okay? We're not going to let anyone get to us," Steve breathed shakily. "We're winning this fight. We have each other and that's all that matters, yeah?"
Tony didn't move. Steve sighed and slumped down on the sheets beside him, staring up at the ceiling.
"A new element," Natasha continued. "Something that won't, you know, burn up your insides." And there was that smile again, pretty but deadly.
"It's really fucked up. They're so brainwashed...it makes me think that I could so easily have turned into one of these people and there's nothing I could have done about it unless someone had pulled me out," said Steve.  "...thanks, Jorge."
Although Tony felt annoyed at being upstaged  by Steve, he had to admit there was one nice thing about this.  While Steve was being asked to do therapy and photo shoots and interviews and model omega fashions and appear on television and give inspiring speeches, Tony could simply hole himself up in his shop and work on the Mark VII.  Modular armor was very high on his priority list It was like his own personal Project 84.
Steve didn't return the smile.  He didn't get the way Aria was treating him at the moment. She kept asking him if he was okay. She kept looking at him like he might break- which was weird. Sure, he had bad days, but that was normal for PTSD sufferers, and he was in post-heat so he was bound to be a little emotional. But ever since his heat Aria had been strange and it wasn't like Aria hadn't seen a heat before. It wasn't
"Georgina, get back--" began the man on the phone.  "--holy shit!" the young man muttered when he saw Steve.
"My PA clothes fit," Steve pointed out with a smile, reaching up to run a hand through Tony's hair. "They're a little posh for me, though. I prefer jeans over dress pants- they're a revelation. And much easier to get around in."
He was breathing a little heavily, his cheeks pink as he stared up at the ceiling. Steve turned into the touch when Tony pressed a cube of ice against his forehead and sighed in relief.
that guy!" he growled.  JARVIS put Steve back on.  Tony was still worked up; the hair on the back of his neck was still standing up.  "Steve," he murmured, as if checking that Steve was okay.  The very idea of Justin even thinking about Steve drove him crazy.
"Pepper.  He thinks... he thinks the guy that tried to kill him, the HYDRA guy, the one that caused this... he thinks it's his old mate.  Bucky."
They were a boy and a girl, both somewhere between sixteen and eighteen.  The boy had dark skin and the moment Steve nearly stepped on him he snarled; the girl behind him was small, pale, light-boned, with blonde hair in a pixie cut.  An omega. And the boy--
The problem was the crowds of people, including media and police.  Tony hadn't even left Corona Park before he was stopped by several members of a SWAT team.
His hands came out automatically to stroke Steve's cheeks, his hair, every gesture a reward and a reassurance and a thanks, a complex acknowledgement of Steve's kneeling.  Tony was accepting Steve's submission, wordlessly praising him for good behavior.
"Tony.  Steve.  I think you should both talk to Dr. Gleason," said Pepper, staring pointedly at Tony.
It was about 9 by the time it was done, with some frozen sweetcorn thrown in and added cumin from the spice rack in the corner. It was nothing special, but it was food. Steve before he took Tony's downstairs (microwaving it to make it sure it was hot).  (He watched the plate go around and around as the microwave hummed; it was incredible, he thought, how you could make food warm up in a matter of minutes.)
"Why's it all about him?  I was there, too," interrupted Tony.  "I got my hackles all itchy for him. ...aren't there any news stories with my name in them?"
"...hey, Eric.  Any idea where Suite B is?  I wanna check out that, uhh... that workshop on how to properly mate an omega."
-learning stuff," Steve mumbled, almost sounding embarrassed himself. "I had no idea about any of this, Tony.  I was clueless.  In my time, omegas weren't really expected to... y'know, enjoy sex." He remembered the first time he went down on Tony, how strange the taste and weight had been on his tongue. It's not that he hadn't
"I admire your use of puns but strongly dislike your blatant copying of my suit design.  Flying robot suits are my
Part of him wanted to reach out to run a hand through Tony's hair and take hold, but he didn't want to in case...in case...he didn't want to trigger Tony. It was partly why the other on his knees slightly unnerved Steve. He was almost...scared that this might bring unwanted memories to the foreground. That would never be his intention. Ever. So he didn't dare touch, just in case.
Donner stood up.  "No. No, Steve doesn't go feral in heat.  There's been a mistake." Donner looked petrified to be speaking up.
Tony leaned forward and nuzzled his neck.  "I liked it better when it wasn't covered," he murmured, his lips brushing Steve's skin.  He could feel Steve's skin rippling an involuntary response.  He bit Steve's earlobe playfully, then ran his tongue over Steve's neck.
The edge of Steve's lips quirked up in the hint of a smile. "I'm Captain America… that, and you had really obvious tells. We had HYDRA spies in my time, too, you know, and they never did like me either."
Honestly, Steve was pretty excited in his own right. He couldn't wait to see Peggy again. That wasn't for a few days though. They had some solid time blocked out for bed and that lock exhibition thing at the British Museum, which Tony seemed overly interested in.  Plus, Steve had prepared a present for Tony's birthday.
Tony laughed, then realized he was serious.  "Oh... oh, no. No, we wouldn't-- I don't think--"  They'd never talked about it. Tony looked at Steve in alarm.  Technically, Steve could sire a child, if he waned to. Knock up another omega or a beta.  "--no. No, we don't want kids," he finished lamely.
He must have dozed off because when he woke up it was in a completely different time zone; it was morning and the Atlantic was sparkling beneath them.  The flight had taken nine or ten hours, but also shoved them forward in time, so that they'd lost nearly a day.
Steve huffed thoughtfully.  Hearing himself called "a bonded omega" felt weird.  He had thought he was unbonded.  Discovering his bond to Bucky was still there after all these years was like discovering he'd never lost his baby teeth, or something equally strange.
.  He frowned.  This wasn't about him; this was about Steve.  He'd feel like an ass if he went to a support group;
"Yeah, you're right. It would of. But it didn't happen. So count yourself lucky. If you want me to make you feel better about this, then that's not going to happen," Steve said flatly. Brock actually chuckled. The noise wasn't unpleasant.
He cleared his throat and cracked open the door a little. "Erm, do you maybe want to... put some clothes on?" Steve croaked.
"Right." Steve put his hands on his hips. "Who here believes every omega's bond is an Alpha's right?"
"They might have been able to work out that it was Steve's heat," Dr. Brazinski said. "His mind would be more pliable, more vulnerable, because of it. Just because they've done it tonight doesn't mean they could just do it in a week's time. They've been tactical about this."
Having someone else with two fingers up his ass was about the weirdest thing Steve had experienced since the novelty of being frozen alive. He tensed up almost immediately and Gleason had to keep reminding him to breathe. If Steve tensed up too much it would just hurt him further. He felt... tender down there, but not directly hurting.  The previous day, he's kept having what felt like muscle spasms of cramps.  Today it was just an ache.  The violation didn't hurt but Steve sure as hell didn't like it, either.  Steve didn't usually go up there other than for sexual reasons; have two fingers inside of him like this, in a clinical setting, was always going to be horribly uncomfortable.
sounds crazy... but it's not.  It's a very common experience and no one things less of you for it.  However, we really need to talk about your plans moving forward, because what you're doing now isn't sustainable."
Steve internally sighed as he watched the other walk away.  "What do you want me to do? Cure his alcoholism?"
On the phone, Phil was quiet for a moment.  "Steve. Listen to me. There's a lot of things wrong with the world.  We focus on the most egregious wrongs but the world will never be perfect.  Human trafficking is a problem everywhere. Things
Suddenly his mind drifted to Bucky.  He and Steve had surely felt something like this toward each other, hadn't they?  And did they still?
"They have back up," Kate mattered and darted away from the window, smacking at the gun to try and get it working. She had it aimed at the Winter Soldier all the while. "Let him
"Give Aria your number. I'll get in touch," Steve assured Bethany. And the fierce-looking woman almost smiled at him before gathering herself back together.
people. Steve had done a lot of things during the forties which made it hard for him to sleep some nights.
He shared a small smile with a detailed sketch of Peggy before he shut the door and locked it and headed to get ready for the party.
He replied to Peggy's text as the car started up and got them out of the studio's grounds. He was so excited to have some form of contact with her his hands were practically shaking. Her approval meant so much to him.
"Mm... where ever you want, baby," murmured Tony, luxuriating in the warm water, trailing his fingers through the bubbles.  He cracked one eye open lazily at Steve.  "I promised you Italian.  We can do Italian.  I know some good sushi places.  They say sushi is a good aphrodisiac."  He closed the eyes, melting a little further into the bath, rubbing one of his legs against Steve's.  "Vegan food is a thing now.  Vegan is, uh, no meat.  Or anything from animals, no eggs, no milk, there's a place called Real Food Daily in Hollywood that's pretty hot... mm... Indian is good... mmmm... there's a Himalayan joint on Venice that's got yak... honest-to-God
Rhodes was an Alpha and a lieutenant colonel; he walked up to Steve, exuding dominance, and barked, "
...Steve blinked in the bright light shining out of the other man's chest, startled by it.  The man looked middle aged. The light in his chest was strange; Steve didn't understand it but he was grateful for the light.
He knew SHIELD would pissed about this. That Fury would probably kill him. But Steve didn't care. They'd been spying on him, when he was on
"Sure... sure, go run, go sweat to the oldies or whatever it is you do for like six hours a day.  I'll be in the shop.  If you need anything just holler at JARVIS, okay?"  Tony ran a hand down Steve's arm.  He couldn't help but worry, but he knew the only real cure for a flashback was to shake it off, move forward.  Maybe later in the day, Steve would feel better; he seemed to love working out.  Maybe he just needed some time alone.
"You're a dead ringer for Barnes.  Are you related? He had a sister. Is he your uncle or great-uncle, maybe?"
Tony watched Steve melting down.  He turned to the front. "Happy, drive.  Take us back to the hotel. We're done."
"That's the Stark promise, baby.  Go hard or go home," sneered Tony.  "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going home.  Oh, and in case it wasn't already clear, you're fired, Rogers."  He turned to leave.  There was a sharp, fiery pang in his chest and he reached up to grab the arc reactor.  He needed to swap out the core again; Fury was right about one thing.  Wearing the suit all night had probably cashed out the palladium core, and he was sure the thing was sizzling inside of him, dripping toxic discharge into his chest cavity with alarming speed.  He wondered if he ought to risk flying back or if he should just hail a cab.  Decisions, decisions…
," said Natasha.  Sam did, but a moment later, Natasha was defending Tony again.  "You think anyone around here was thrilled when Clint brought me back?  Huh?  You think Clint didn't hear everyone telling him he could do better than some Soviet assassin?  You think we didn't deal with rumors about me being a spy or a mole or something for
"Here you go," Steve told Tony as he handed him a plate and fork, the plate laden with pancakes and syrup. He tugged up the edge of the sheet and snuck underneath himself with his own plate of food. He took the time to reply to Clint's text before he started eating.
"...Barnes?" said Tony.  He rubbed the back of his neck.  "...yeah. I know how it feels, I think.  ...I'm sorry." He swallowed. Knowing his own mark was replaced with the imprint of some other guy's mouth really bothered him.  "...can you feel him?" he asked tentatively. "I mean... the way you feel me. Before it was just... like... a memory of a dream. Is it... stronger now, that he re-bit you?"
Tony had long since wired up speakers and intercoms outside so he could yell at JARVIS from the comfort of his pool. The first time the pool maintenance had heard the disembodied voice, it had nearly given them a heart attack.
"I do. I just--" Steve sighed as Tony pulled at his clothes and he let him, not exactly displeased by it. Tony's hands were rough and warm, nothing like Brooke's. She said she liked
"How's it going?" she asked uncertainly.  She was surprised to see Steve without Tony.  Of course, Tony was, at times, notoriously lazy.  And despite Steve's size, she knew he could be stealthy.  He must have slipped away to let Tony get some extra rest.  She could only wonder how Tony was; last she'd seen him, he'd looked downright ill.  A cursory Google search the night before had taught her that, in fact, thousands died annually during sex, most of them older Alphas bonded to younger omegas.  It concerned her, a bit, because even though he was fit, Tony was forty, and Steve, half his age, was also in peak health. And always would be, thanks to the serum.
"Swipe to unlock," it said.  He pressed his finger onto the screen and swiped; nothing happened.  He tried a few more times, then realized his left hand was probably too cold.  When he swiped with his right hand, it worked fine.
Tony huffed a little and adjusted himself on top of Steve, tenderly wiping away the tears on his cheeks.  "Let's get you something to drink when we get to the hospital... it's okay... it's okay, omega... you're safe," murmured Tony.
"I already disabled my tracker.  I've been feeding them false data for days.  They think we're in Boston," said Natasha. "How about you?  Did Tony finagle yours, or did you just smash it off?"
He got up to get himself a drink from the mini-bar.  ...a couple of drinks. After spending all day by his parents' graves and then completely failing to fuck his omega or make him feel better, Tony was ready to throw in the towel for the day.
"This is Agent Thirteen on base 3 requesting immediate backup, I've got contact with HYDRA hostiles, at least a dozen--" Carter was yelling into the phone.  She had abandoned the semi and swapped it out for a pistol.  She caught Fury's eyes.  "Take the fire escape, go, take it!" she yelled, throwing a set of keys at him.
"Takes a lot for me to work up a sweat," Steve pointed out a little breathlessly. It was true. Clint had once despaired at him. They'd been sparring for over an hour and Steve hadn't even broken out in a sweat. The archer had just rolled his eyes as Steve offered him a hand to pick him up off the floor yet again. "
"An old friend," Steve said only as he went to fetch his first aid kit. Bucky was something private, something that was his. Steve wasn't usually selfish but Bucky was something he wasn't prepared to share with the world just yet- or rather, the memory of him. He was dead, long gone, but still precious.
"She can handle it," said Tony with a casual wave.  He pulled the sheet up a little more, settling back against his pillow, arm around Steve.  "Nat, do me a solid and go get me a cup of coffee, will you?  And throw a few shots of bourbon in it."
Tony had a million comebacks but they were gone the moment Steve started dropping the gs off the ends of his sentences.
He went back to the truck and watched the twins rifle through the bag of food from the gas station, picking apart a muffin together, peeling an orange.  They tried to talk to him but he ignored them, and they eventually stopped trying, eating their breakfast in silence while he watched.
What Tony had said shocked Steve. Not that Bucky had loved him, but that Tony could feel that. It was almost eerie.
The woman was bonded, but even if she were single, Tony would not have felt threatened.  His jealousy was ebbing a lot.  Having a proper honeymoon in his own house, getting to mate Steve over and over... he felt secure.  A lot more secure.  Their bond had solidified over the last week and Tony felt a lot more rational and less emotional than he had at the very beginning.  Thank Tesla.  The idea of being so out of control for his whole life was extremely unpleasant.  It was nice to be around Steve in public without his hackles rising at every time another Alpha interacted with them.
Tony appeared, still sipping his cocktail from the orange juice carton, robe still undone.  "Hey, but... we're still gonna get the ankle thingies off soon, right? It's starting to chafe."  He gave his leg a shake.
