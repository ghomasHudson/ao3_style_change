“FRI, the Phoenix project schematics. Access code: WARMACHINEROX91,” Rhodes says with his arms crossed.
“So what’s the plan?” Thor’s voice booms from the entry way. It’s the most aware anyone has seen him look since the battle against Thanos. Everyone of them knows that he has lost, what nobody knows, but out of all of them Thor looks to be faring the worse. His dual-colored eyes stare intently at Tony’s hologram, though, the determination they have always admired in him coming off of him in waves. Nobody speaks to answer his question, and he turns around to glare at Steve. The Captain’s insides turn at the hostility and accusation in his eyes. “You cannot expect us to sit idle and let him die.”
He’d banned anyone from coming to his penthouse since then, and avoided having to see what he was turning into when he was forced out of the solace of the tower. There was nobody to check on him, anyway, so avoidance had suddenly become a lot easier. He leans against the counter in his bathroom for a second longer, breathes a slow exhale and ghosts his fingers over the center of his chest before he tells himself to man up.
the knowledge is staggering.
He finds King T’Challa loitering outside the conference room, and though he sees that the others are already inside nobody is paying attention to the monarch. They’re all having separate, hushed conversations or looking down at the big tome in front of them. Natasha and the Captain seem to be deep in conversation about something that looks intense.
“Fine?” Rhodey growls, and tries to step towards Steve. His hands are balled into fists, and Tony recognizes that look. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes is about to make an appearance, and the genius knows that he has to defuse this shit now before they blow it out bigger than it already has. Steve is already devastated, Tony knows, and despite the fact that he feels about to break he knows that he can’t allow Rhodey to hurt him further. Though he is infinitely grateful to have his brother’s support. “He was about to—“
They have to go past Steve, however, and the soldier doesn’t feel like being left out of the loop right now. he knows he told Sam that he would let them do things at their pace, but goddamn it. he’s so fucking worried about Tony right now. and clearly, wherever he is is cause for concern in the boys that care so much about him. Clearly he hasn’t been okay for the past few days, and leaving him alone probably hadn’t helped as much as they’d hoped.
“If it’s not Pepper then—“
“Maybe they all don’t like your lame jokes,” the kid says and Tony laughs softly.
“Uncle Tony said we could go play down in the lab later,” Cassie pipes up from where she’s coloring next to Lila.
to be a part of this the moment you came to talk to me. I could have said no, and you would have left me alone. I could have chosen to stay normal when the spider bit me, Tony, before I even met you. I could have just pretended to still be normal, but I wanted to do something more. I told you,” his eyes are earnest as he looks at his mentor, and Tony rubs a hand to the phantom pain in his chest. “iWhen you do the things I can do… you have a bigger responsibility. I didn’t just come up with that, I
Steve stops him, this time, with a chaste kiss on the lips. He pulls away quickly, doesn’t feel like now is the time but being unable to stop himself nonetheless and Tony blinks again. “I’m not exactly impartial, either, Tony. I was—I admit, I was angry when they told me. I’m sorry.”
Peter, bless him, inherited Tony’s brilliance. He might not have been his biologically, but there was never any doubt who his fathers were. He has all the markings of both. His quick wit, however, Tony is totally taking claim for. “She—did she—dad!” that last part is a squeak, eyes bright and smile huge on his face.
“Stop,” Tony says tiredly. The last thing he wants, now that they are doing so well, is any more empty promises. By the sad look the soldier gives him, he knows that he has managed to convey his point well enough for the blond to get. It hurts, that he can’t even hear the words without the stupid part of him believing them, but he’d rather play it safe. For the time being at least.
place for Tony to be at.
,” Steve said vehemently, taken aback by the turn the conversation had taken. Part of him, a big part if he’s been honest, wants to be insulted at the fact that Sam would think that’s his plan. That he would even suggest anything other than Tony’s wellbeing is on his mind, but he can’t even fake that much. To think that everyone else had noticed how callous and thoughtless he had always been with the man who needed his supposed levelheadedness so much… to think he’d treated Tony like anything but a friend… anything but the man he—“Christ,” he says out loud. “That’s not—I didn’t—this isn’t about
“Is that how you saw me?” Steve’s eyes snap up to the brunet’s at the hitch in his voice. he doesn’t know where he went wrong, again, but it looks like he’d stepped on another landmine. Tony—well, he looks
this ended up going in a totally different direction than i thought lol
So when his friends come crashing into the apartment that day, December 16
“Mmm, I hear you,” he mumbles and finally manages to push himself back. He’s immediately assaulted with a pair of puppy eyes. Brown and concerned in a face that can’t be older than sixteen, and a mop of wild chocolate curls. Tony blinks at the kid for a second, going from
“It has been thirty nine hours since—“

“Try his phone. I can’t seem to—“

“Her name’s Morgan,” Rhodey says with an air of the defeat as he stares at them. Everyone else in the room seems to be holding their breath. “Well, Sarah really but To—we’ve just been calling her Morgan.”
“Yes! Yes, I need to—see yourself out, I’ll be—” he can’t even fully form sentences, that’s how excited he is. He walks to the door, makes it three steps into the hall, before he remembers his wallet and phone are still on his desk not to mention
“Is nobody going to let that go?” there is a grin on the blond man’s face as he says it, though, betraying his fake exasperation. Peter is standing at the island by his side, looking at him with his big bambi eyes, and Rhodey is sitting on the other side with a plate of pasta in front of him and the other by his side.
, until he found it in himself to ask JARVIS to call Tony up wherever he was and had gotten to hear the richness of Tony’s voice and the smile he couldn’t see.
Steve remembers the words, but now that he’s thinking back. Yes, there it is. The desperation. How had he not noticed that before? He merely nods at Tony, feels his heart breaking as the other man tries to compose himself, and stays silent.
“So, if you think about it, this is kind of your fault…?” he tunes back in long enough to hear the words that just came out of the boy’s mouth. Tony looks up from he had been fidgeting with the GPS tracker on his arm and tries his very best not to let the scream come out of his mouth.
and it was about damn time they started owning up to it.
“She also said that I should apologize,” Scott muttered, and Tony immediately went cold. Hundreds of fake apologies sprung up to his head; all the times Obie had said something cutting and apologized meaninglessly, the times Ty would punch him and then say sorry and do it again, the times Pepper would apologize when she couldn’t look at Tony after a mission. He didn’t need that from a virtual stranger too.
“Oh, Coop,” Tony says softly. “He didn’t choose anyone over you. He’d never do that, kiddo, he didn’t fight just because of her. The accords… the laws they were trying to put up… they were dangerous. They could have hurt your dad, and then you would all have been hurt, too. Clint—your father was just trying to keep you all safe and happy. That’s what he’ll
“Look at this!” he says heatedly. He’s waving the paper too fast for Steve to read, but apparently that doesn’t matter. “A C+ on fucking geography! A subject he could pass in his

, that exactly like Steve she hasn’t told the others anything about what happened in Sokovia. He doesn’t mean when Ultron attacked, but way before then. He feels the words about to burst from his lips, the accusations and the hate and bereavement for not only her but the whole lot of them, and has to bite his tongue so hard he finally tastes blood.
he knew that he couldn’t test it in this. If he did something stupid, it wasn’t just on him anymore. If he did something stupid the repercussions would fall on Wanda first, and then on the man who had trusted to keep him safe last night. He couldn’t do that to either of them. “You said you’d be there. You promised you’d help me.”
“God, I was an idiot,” Steve says self-deprecatingly.
“What he had to,” Rhodes says with an edge to his voice. When Steve meets his eyes, there is a challenge there.
, Tony is horrible at lying to himself. His attempts at distancing himself from the lot of them failed the minute they picked different camps. If Tony had been stronger he would have brought them in without a second thought. If Tony had been stronger, he would have never sold himself to Ross and the others to keep them safe. If Tony had been stronger, Barnes wouldn’t be in the Stark mansion using his
“Baby?” He touches Tony’s knees with the pads of his fingers, and though he doesn’t say anything, Tony angles his body in his direction. “Sweetheart? Can you tell me what’s wrong?”
had been worth it. he felt himself about to tear up, something he hadn’t allowed himself to do since before the war, until Cassie’s excited question pulled him back to the present. T’Challa gave him a smile that looked almost proud over the girl’s head, and he grinned back shyly.
“It’s not, дорогой,” she says just as softly. Her thumb makes soft sweeps across his knuckles.
“What were her favorites?” Cooper asks, and his voice is subdued. His reverent tone matching the way Tony has talked about his mother since the day she passed. Was murdered. He takes another shuddering breath.
that, but it still feels as though it’s my job to keep her safe, but… there are so many choices I’ve made that just ended up taking her in a more destructive path. That’s on me.”
“Buck?” Steve prompts, and the man looks up at him slowly.
“The lady at the store said it was better!”
“Tony,” she says, and the tone of her voice lets him know that it’s best if he doesn’t argue with her. “You’ve watched him before, you’ll be absolutely fine. Could you take the others with you, please?”
lucky.”
“I’m not like Stane,” Steve said weakly. Like he was pleading with Tony to deny it. Like it was the absolutely worst insult Tony could have given him. The memory seems to assault them both.
“Hey, no,” Tony cradles the boy’s head in his hands as if he might break and makes him look up at him. As his back is turned to the soldier, Steve can’t see the expression on the other man’s face but he is relieved when the boy relaxes. “Back when we met, you talked me out of a panic attack, remember?”
“What are you?” he asks. Old friend of Rhodes’s or not, he’s not about to risk their new found safety. Or walk right into the plans of an enemy. He’s done that before. Not a fan.
With a sigh, he tucks into his dinner and wills himself to stop being so maudlin. So what if some of his former fa—friends don’t like him anymore. It’s not as if he has never experienced that feeling before. Howard had been a very adamant teacher in that; every time he’d send Tony to a new boarding school when he began to be too “distracted” with other children. All it took was for one child to greet Tony by name in Howard’s presence for him to be relocated, and god forbid he find Tony speaking to someone on the telephone or exchanging emails or letters. As he grew older, the younger Stark had begun to be cleverer in hiding his distractions. By then it was others that had begun to tech Tony about heartache and lost friendships. It was the kids that befriended him for his money or connections, and the kids that found him too tiresome to deal with. It was the quick-as-lightning relationships he had that sought a comfort he never found, and were later labeled as one night stands by the tabloids. It was the people like Ty Stone who found too fragile and insecure to deal with but perfect for breaking, the people like Justin Hammer who didn’t even pretend. After his father, it was all the people who taught Tony that letting go was better and simpler than trying to hold on when he wasn’t worth it. When it was too much for people to handle; too much insecurity, too much neglect, too much brashness, too much of an asshole, too reckless… just… too much.
“Backstage. I was on my way to the car after my presentation. I was alone because Pep—“ his voice breaks and he has to clear his throat. Steve ignores the pang of jealousy the action brings and concentrates on Tony’s always-expressive eyes. The other man seems to be coming out of his haze. “Pepper was gone. So I was making my way to the elevator to meet Happy at the underground garage in the conference hall.”
be there, now, keeping him company. He was never meant to be so far away.
what she said stand as truth rather than trust
“We need to go,” Harley breaks up, finally. He throws his chair back and begins to grab his tablet and phone as Peter shovels the last of his pancake into his mouth.
Steve had said. His eyes had looked so sincere. His strong fingers grabbing hold of his wrist and brushing tenderly against his pulse point.
. I told him that we weren’t working. I told him that we both knew—” he can’t say more. Just the thought of the words he had told Tony makes him want to throw up.
“But that doesn’t make any—“
“Told you not to leave him unsupervised,” Tony’s voice says and he sounds much closer than he should. Steve looks up in time to have Bart-Bot get thrown into his arms.
Holy shit, it's been a minute and a half LOL
“I take it the boys disagree,” the voice on the other end sounds amused.
, and the baby seems to give up on the walking because she just gets on her hands and knees and begins crawling like someone is chasing her.
“I’m sure she’s fine,” he tells Nat quietly.
“Yes,” Steve said quietly. Shattered.
“Do you love him?”
out of there. I left you there, Tony. That was
Scott gave him a solemn nod, which Tony returned, then he made his way back to the rec room. Before he could enter, Ant-Man caught his arm again. It seemed like this was something the mechanic would have to get used to, though he smiled a little. There were worse habits to put up with than this.
hold anymore, and so it comes pouring out. The soldier knows Tony
he thinks as he stares at the words. He doesn’t dare look at Tony, can’t bear to see the hatred and resentment on the other man’s face. Any anger of his own at how the mechanic had reacted to the truth, any misguided self-righteousness, vanishes in the face of the woman’s memory. He didn’t have to have met her, he’s done plenty of research on her, has heard Tony drunkenly ramble about his mother in the moments when Steve had been privy to his most vulnerable moments.
“He’s gone,” Vision tells him quietly, wincing as his wound pulls. Steve goes very, very still at his words. His fury must be clear on his face, though, because Vision’s complexion goes a tad paler, something Steve didn’t even know was possible. “We saw the news before we were attacked. It—they said he was missing.”
No, this sounds more like the lady in Sam’s old phone. Suri or whatever its name was. That same old pre-recorded, repetitive voice that merely regurgitated information at you. It was nothing like the beauty and amazement that the AI’s they’d known brought with them. Steve drops his duffle bag at his side, and turns his head to meet Nat’s gaze. The others have begun to trace the space; Clint’s gaze goes to the television set and his jaw locks at the lack of consoles. Sam disappears down a side corridor, and a moment later reappears with a haunted look on his face. Wanda runs her fingertips over the top of a couch that lacks any sort of colorful woven throw. Scott and Bucky, the only ones without a connection to the place, drop onto a couch. Scott promptly begins snoring. Bucky merely sits at the end of the couch cushion as he surveys the place.
So he avoids T’Challa until the last possible second, but makes sure that he is cordial to him when they have to confer. He keeps the skepticism he feels about this meeting to himself, though he guesses the king knows. It’s all the same, Tony supposes, seeing as T’Challa thinks he can keep his guests from Tony in return. They exchange quick last minute instructions for each other, and then they are being escorted into the latest UN meetings about the accords.
to take that responsibility. Just like you decided to leave your family to fight another war.” That shuts him up pretty quick, and a haunted look crosses his face. Tony knows that Laura is seething with rage still, and wonders what the ultimatum was.
It’s only because Coop is suddenly at his side, plastered to Tony really, and Nate is going off on a litany of “Unc’a ‘Ony, Unc’a ‘Ony,” as if he’s singing a little song to himself that the mechanic finds himself nodding. He ruffles Cooper’s hair and turns to Cassie. Lang is still hugging her to his chest, but now he’s giving Tony a look that can only be described as assessing.
it had been over a year already. Why would the pain not get any fucking easier. Tony heaves a sigh as Peter continues to hide his face in his book. He pulls the stool next to his son out so he can sit down, keeping his hand on the boy’s shoulder, and waits him out. Tony massages his son’s back, reassuring slow passes up and down, as Peter’s whole frame shakes. Tony’s breath hitches, his throat getting tight with anger and pain at seeing his child this upset. It hadn’t been any easier for Peter than it had been for Tony, over half his pseudo-family gone and a father on the run like some two-bit criminal. The first four or so months had been
it, Tony. I could hear the stupid BARF in the background and you weren’t okay, and I was miles away. And the only—the only thing—what I could do—I couldn’t—“hearing the boy hiccupping tears Steve’s heart in two.
Second, I'm starting uni on the 23rd (!!!!!!!!!!!!) so things are going to be hectic for the next couple of things while i get settled and stuffs so apologies in advance.
“Are you fucking crazy?”
can do that,” he corrected.
“Yep, Dummy misses us when we’re gone,” Lila pipes up with a bright grin. “Uncle Tony said so.”
Tony thinks when they’re finally alone.
“That’s why,” Tony said, deciding to be truthful. When the other man gave him a confused stare, Tony shrugged and shoved his hands into his pockets. “You said you didn’t know what you’d do if your daughter were in danger. I—to be honest, I did whatever you could when my family was.” Tony turned his head to look at Lang, and caught sight of a pair of blue eyes over the other man’s shoulders. “I did whatever I could to keep
face. “He’s been asking for you for a few days.”
Steve makes a choice.
The news come, for Steve at least, out of the blue. It’s been a few days since he’d had a talk with Tony at the cemetery and since then he’s felt a little out of sync. He’s made his very best effort to spend time with his time, sharing meals or training or any of the other things they used to do
when he gets angsty. Tasha merely rolls her eyes and grabs his arm. He goes up without much more than a grunt, though once he’s on his feet he begins his tirade again; T’Challa and Tony look on with faint amusement at the moment as Rhodey tries to tug his arm away and
“Like you have to make up for it?” Tony asks, a sad smile on his face. God, this kid is too much like him. “Like you don’t get to make mistakes because someone already made all of them? You feel like you have to make up for what someone else did?” Peter nods, his breath hitching again, and Tony leans forward to grasp his son’s hands. This might be the hardest thing he has ever done, trauma of the last year and a half aside, being this vulnerable in front of his son might actually be the biggest challenge of his life. “I feel like that, too, you know? With you and zio Rhodey and Morguna and even with Viz. I feel—I feel so responsible for what happen. Most days, I lay awake till two am trying to think of everything I could have done differently. I’m—it’s what I do, right? The mechanic? I fix things? But there is nothing I could do to fix this mess and I just—so I try. Every single day, I try to—to be strong. For you. I didn’t realize what I was doing to you, amore, I am so sorry.”
Anyways! I hope you are all having a wonderful day/week/month and if not I wish you all the luck in things getting better and am rooting for you to kick every problem's ass :D
Tony isn’t home anymore. The mansion is locked up and dark and nobody will tell him anything about where he might be. A tall gentleman had asked him if his name was Steve, and when Bucky said he knew him the man had asked him, coldly yet polite, to stop calling. Master Stark had enough grief to deal with at the moment.
,” he retorts and his eyes cut to the man sitting beside her. Clearly, he holds someone just as responsible for landing her in that cell. Tony doesn’t think he will ever grow tired of watching what little is left of JARVIS break through his impassiveness.
“Stevie?” Bucky’s voice pulls him from where he was idly looking at the television. For whatever reason, they’ve got one of those gossip channels on. The text under it says something about a surprise visitor coming up later.
“How—“Barton doesn’t get to finish before Laura is marching towards him. She’s glaring the whole time and he has the good sense to gulp down and take a step back.
(On a side note, I have lost all hopes in the United States of America. It was a nice run.)
“As we have discussed, Ms. Maximoff,” and this time the king seems to be biting off his words this time. “Your pardons are unconditional. This was merely your last place of residence so we thought it best to bring you back to the last place that was your home. You may choose to do as you please from this point forward.”
Tony takes in a quick breath as images of a glinting arm, ripped off a soldier, and blood stained navy armor flashes through his mind. a bloody mouth and the beginnings of a bruise around a clear-blue eye. Angry words and even angrier tears. The clang of a shield on concrete. He brings his trembling hands down to rest under the table. Tasha gives him a concerned look, but he ignores it and stares at T’Challa. He doesn’t understand why he’s bringing this up now. They all know where they stand. The new heroes might still get to choose, but
“What the fuck?” Barton’s incredulous, though not angry not exactly, voice pulls him out of the moment. He notices that all the room’s occupants are staring at him then, and he feels heat crawl up his neck. He’s about to hand the baby back to his mother, clearly the baby’s dad has some disagreement with her choices, but then Laura is giving him a determined stare.
. Tony had too much pain lodged in to let Steve add any more.
Tony in that moment… the man who’d babble when he was nervous, the man who liked Steve’s hot chocolate after a bender, the man who’d jokingly-but-not-really offered to buy the Dodgers on a whim for him… he’d been so, so stupid.
. I never meant to hurt you, that’s true, I thought I was protecting you. It’s a bold faced lie that I told myself, every day I saw you and stood by you and brought you lunch and enjoyed your company, every day I was lying to both of us. I told you that I trusted you, I thought I did, but the whole time I kept thinking back to that dossier I had of you at the beginning and I never gave you enough credit. Then Sokovia happened,” Steve shook his head.
“You can’t keep doing this to yourself, man,” Rhodes’s voice had tried to be stern but he’d come out more like pleading. “This isn’t healthy.”
“See what?” Steve asked. His eyes were wide, pupils blown, as he searched desperately for an indication of what Tony was thinking. The brunette was numb, though, as the one realization he had been shying away from the whole time finally came into clear focus.
The morning of the hearing, he’s sitting alone in the communal living room. There’s a cooling cup of black coffee sitting on the table in front of him as he looks out the window to the trees surrounding the facility. Usually, he would be on his morning run around this time. It’s barely begun to get light, and he loves running around the perimeter when it’s cool and he gets to just
“Don’t,” Steve tells him pleadingly. His attempt at making Tony let go of his wrist is feeble at best. He’s avoiding looking at the engineer, and the brunette is afraid he’s going to bite right through his lip. “I understand, Tony. It’s fine. I just—I—I just wanted you to know that—“
.  T’Challa claps Rogers on the back and then crosses the room to where Tony is still sitting and gives him a reassuring squeeze to his shoulder.
“Kree?” Nebula snaps, she had remained silent through their conversation but now her suspicion is in full force. She springs to her feet and places herself between Carol and Tony. His alarm bells ring shrilly in his head and he forces the gauntlet to form around his hand.
“No,” Tasha says, and she looks just as shaken as the captain does.
Tony had said as he tinkered with a schematic in the workshop. His hands fidgeting with everything in sight, and his eyes refusing to meet Steve’s.
Steve doesn’t feel at all comforted by the worry in the children’s eyes.
“Where are you going?” Steve recognizes his voice even though it sounds hoarse.
All of his alarms had been ringing since the Captain had all but ran out of the kitchen in search of a wayward genius. He had started the worried fussing about twenty five minutes after the kids had stormed out of the kitchen. Parker and the Harley boy to the lab for some “recon” as they called it, and his own oldest child had slammed his bowl on the sink and stormed away. Nate was already fussy before Steve even less, missing his uncle like crazy, and had become all but inconsolable from the moment Steve stepped away.
“Why?” Tony asked quietly.
“She’s just a kid! You said it yourself, Cap. She and her brother were just kids. Von Strucker was manipulating them! You can’t fault them for that!”
“This is gonna work,” Steve says in an even voice, his eyes on the world outside their panoramic window.
team had pulled him in. if there was anything that Tony could sympathize with was desperate decisions.
. The cold might be seeping into his bones, and every breath might be a challenge, but his time is up. It was time to go.
“I want to stay,” Peter says quietly before the others can give him a reply. It kills Tony when he sounds like the actual kid he is. It makes him wish for a safe haven where he can stash him and all this utter
“James!” Sam chastises lowly, his voice tight. “This is not helping!”
“So were we. In Titan. We saw it happen.”
“I don’t think any of us have a choice. I saw what that thing can do. I was there. Half my fleet, gone. They said it came from there, so that’s where we’re going.” It’s another female voice, and it rings a bell for Tony though he doesn’t know why. It’s higher pitched than Nebula’s but there’s something about her accent that makes recognition sound in his head
“Fry, tell Ross to shove his bullshit up his ass,” he says tiredly.
But since when has the blabbermouth ever done what he’s told? Even when he was barely two years old and they told him not to run so much or he’d bump his head, he’d gone right ahead and done
“Jarvis’s wife,” Tony explained with a fond shake of his hand. “She was our cook until she got too sick to keep going; even then she commandeered the kitchen every time she dropped by. She was one tough lady, and just as pretty as Mama. She was,” he breaks off with a chuckle and from the corner of his eye he sees Steve’s smile transform. He looks utterly
“What in the
. But that’s just it, isn’t it? That would taste like a lie too. “I should go,” he finally says, just loud enough for them to hear.
Tony says for the both of them.
want for you guys.”
“What?” it was the first time Wanda had opened her mouth since she arrived in the kitchen. She was looking at him with something like confusing and betrayal in her face. Steve felt sadness swirl in his chest at her crestfallen look, and for a second he considered backing out. He thought about attending the trial and being there for her, but that was quickly stamped down by too many memories. He had been told to stand down before to protect his family, and he hadn’t done it. He had thought he had known best, and in the end everything had gone to hell in a handbasket. He knew himself, knew his temper, and while he had made leaps and bounds to stave off the instinctual need to
After Rhodey has stood his ground for them and baited Ross into court-martialing him, after Bruce had quietly and awkwardly worked himself into the room. After they had begun their discussion, their desperate attempt at understand what had happened; after they have looked after Vision’s wound and one of them had suggested food. He won’t remember exactly what led him to turn his head. It was something quiet, though, in the sudden stillness of the room. His hearing had managed to catch the faint sound of footsteps.
“No, it’s still months away. He said—“
“I can do better,” Steve says immediately and Tony chuckles humorlessly. Who would have thought it, huh?
“There’s nothing there,” Sam said and the same kind of haunted look came into his eyes.
“No, hiss,” Tony says to distract her from her evil punishment machinations. “My sanctuary is being invaded. Go away.” He dramatically hunches over his peach cobbler.
Because Tony knows his husband, knows him to a level that he had never thought possible, and he knows that wherever he is  he will know, and soon, and he will try to fight. God knows if he will have the time or the means to check on the kids.
When they get bored with that, Tony offers to get them one of the gaming consoles from the living room. Laura, and even Hope when Tony had talked to her, had expressed their preference for the children to limit their time with electronics. Being, essentially, a single mother for most of the year, Laura tended to let them watch television or play with their tablets during the day when she was busy. Being at Tony’s not only provided respite from that, but also a babysitter to entertain the children. However, they had allowed Tony the privilege of deciding whether he wanted to be the “cool uncle” who let them mess around with tech whenever they were at the compound, or if he followed their suggestion of providing them with more real life interaction. Tony had tried both, but had found that it was much better to let them get into things hands on and then answer their questions when they had them. Not only were they more aware of the real world, but they learned new things every time and so did Tony.
“Look, Tony, I think we both knew this might not work. We both knew from the start that—that we were too different. I’m leaving at the end of the next year, and you’re going to send me god knows where. I just—I don’t think we should be wasting—“The way Tony rears back at his choice of words immediately makes Steve feel like the worst human being on Earth. He wants to kick himself the moment the words are out, but Tony beats him to it. He takes a step back, then another, tear after tear falling silently down his cheeks.
“Laura and Hope said
“I don’t give a
“I think he’s trying to say is that it’s time to get our heads out of our asses and start listening, Barton,” Sam said. Tony could hear the judgment in his voice. Clint merely glared at him though he settled when Baby Bart murmured in his sleep.
Before Steve can open his mouth to say anything, Tony turns around with a proud smile on his face. He has a bowl of cereal on his hand and he places it in front of Steve, then one in front of Rhodey and another on the space next to the blond. Then, he brings the coffees over. He places a plain white mug with the words “Espresso Patronum” on the empty space next to his cereal, another one with the words “I am an

hadn’t garnered even a smile. On the third day, they didn’t appear. On the fourth, Cooper hadn’t walked into the kitchen either, and Laura had been banging cupboard doors. On the fifth, Clint made himself scarce and the kids all sat down for dinner. On the seventh, the hostility had transferred to Steve and he tried his best not to take it personal.
“I’ll talk to Pepper. She’ll get you there, I’m sure. For now, I think it’d be best if you went home, yes? Break the news?” Her smile spreads fully on her face, and Tony can feels his lips doing the same. It’s finally sinking in, that this is real, it’s true. This is actually happening, and even thoug he knows that the anger, and despair and bitterness will hit him later, for now all he feels is elation.
The mechanic stared at him with wide eyes, and then the ridiculousness of the situation got to him and he began to laugh. Honestly, less than a year ago this man had turned ginormous and had tried to squeeze him and his friends like grapes. Less than a year ago, this man had told him that Hank Pym, a man who didn’t know anything about Tony, had been right in saying not to trust a Stark. Then he turns all of that around and tells hugs him. When he had created Iron Man, Tony had never thought about just how strange things would be for him. Though the foes from outer space and dude with a reindeer helmet should have clued him in.
The press is juvenile and downright cruel when reporting about it. Certain websites make a game out of it; trying to guess why Tony isn’t in public anymore. Steve tends to only half-listen, now, only keeping tabs on when Tony is and isn’t in the public eye. He hates hearing the taunts and the insults; the speculation of what kind of substance Tony is taking now to numb the pain. The cruel and careless way his suicide attempts are reported. The fake sympathy and belated words of support. The stoic way with which Stane goes in front of the press, looking more careless and irritated with each conference, and his subtle jabs about his own godson.
“He’ll be fine, I’ll keep him company,” Tony responds easily. He just wants to get the hell away from the emotional rollercoaster he seems to be in. the workshop is safe; his work protects him. He’ll be fine once he can lose himself in coding, and metal, and grease.
“I did,” Steve said, feeling the words hit him like a blow. “Which is why I’m staying at the compound. I talked to Tony, and he told me why I was considered a liability more than an asset to you. If I’m in the room, they’ll lump you in with me. They’ll try to—to blame you for
“Bambino, this isn’t your fight—”

“Look, Captain,” Tony says and pinches the bridge of his nose. He can’t do this, he decides. He’s not this strong, and he can’t even pretend to be this strong. “How ‘bout I say
“Hello, Tony,” she says fondly and he grins.
“Yes, but. Anthony is human. Fully human, Banner, the stress it would take on his body if we were to—”
, brought a certain type of depressing peace. In the end there was nothing he could have done to keep the others around. They were going to leave him eventually. The only thing Tony had done wrong was become complacent, like with Pepper, while they were still around. All he had done wrong is believe that they’d find him worthy despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
“Mr. Stark?” T’Challa’s voice breaks him from his reverie.
,” and ah, there is the disgust. “Was back. Do you know what it’s like to have to talk to a spider dude off the ledge? The
“Very well,” the king said now addressing the occupants of the room. Tasha gave a solid kick to Barton’s stool that had him springing up into a seated position at once. He had drool on his cheek and he wiped at it as he stared blearily around the room. Sam, rolling his eyes, pushed a plate with toast and some eggs his ways and the archer began eating without even questioning what was going on. Everett Ross looked on with a raised eyebrow, and Phil smiled indulgently at his former charge. “I am sure you are all aware of your roles for the proceedings today. Those of you who are witnessing on behalf of Ms. Maximoff have already been briefed on what is expected of you. This is just some last minute reminders that you must all be on your best behavior today. The prosecution will try to get a rise out of you, and they will bring up some painful events in your collective past, however, it is important that you maintain a leveled head.”
“The idiot that thought this was a good idea?” Tony says and scowls when Baby Bart gnaws a bit at his cheek and Sam laughs.
Marina’s face softens, and the smile she sends his way now is actually genuine. She gently places the folder on his thighs, because she knows about his
“You heard what we did, right?” Sam chimes in incredulously. “You are aware of what she just said? Call me crazy, but from what I know, this whole you all blamed Tony for what happened in Sokovia. Even when Thor came back, even when Viz was created, you still held him responsible. Now she’s telling you that it wasn’t all on him, and you still refuse to accept that you were wrong!”
“Onwards!” the three mini-me’s shouted and Tony was irrationally proud of having taught them that.
Tony can feel the embarrassed rush of blood to his ears, and he determinedly avoids eye contact with everyone who isn’t Cassie. Cooper giggles next to him, and Tony turns to give him an unimpressed glare. The little shit only gives him a grin back, and Tony huffs. “Well, Tasha and the others got your dad here a few days ago, but you couldn’t come by yet since you were in school. So once you were on holiday, we called up Laura and asked her to bring you here so you all could see your dads.”
Anyway please enjoy, and hopefully i'll get through the comments some time this century. As always, incredibly indebted to you all and your support.
“Mom says that wasn’t all your fault,” Cooper says quietly, correctly hearing the hatred in his tone, and squeezes his hand quickly. Tony merely shrugs.
“They point, Tony,” is said incredulously. “Is that you’re a wonderful, kind man who did everything he could to keep his family safe.
“S—S—S’eve,” Baby Bart whimpered against her shoulder.
he was about to give some of them a blow they might not forgive him for. Still, he closed his eyes and thought about last night and the way Tony had looked this morning curled up on his chest with exhaustion heavy on his face and couldn’t find it himself to back down from his plan.
Peter blushes and looks down at his hands. Tony can see how tightly curled they are, and sighs at the kid. He already has too many self-defensive techniques that the mechanic really doesn’t like. Tony gives him a friendly shoulder bump, and the kid seems to take comfort in the gesture.
Tony to see it. “Tony, please, think about it. Why in the world would she be there? Did you advertise it?”
, and Tony feels his jaw drop.
“Oh, hell no, I’m not staying here for this,” Rhodey says as he wipes his hands on a rag. He motions for Steve to hand over the baby as the soldier blushes at the intense gaze of the other man. “That was a disgusting display of domesticity, but I can’t keep letting you both traumatize him. He’s an impressionable bot,” he tickles Nate’s tummy to get himself a quiet giggle and some choice words. “Tony, use protection!” he throws over his shoulder as he leaves.
So when Vision came into the compound with a team of paramedics behind him, Tony was with that boy. The boy with the crystal eyes and the gold-spun hair was holding his hand, mouth twisted into an unhappy grimace of regret, as Vision carefully helfted Tony out of his suit and onto a gurney. The boy’s eyes were brimming with tears, and Tony blinked.
“Not you,” Tony says quickly and squeezes his fingers.
Tony spins aimlessly in his chair down at the lab, and wonders what the fuck he thinks he’s doing. There’s a prosthetic metallic arm in front of him, and the schematics for neuro-sensors and connection and psychoanalytical theories that my not even work. There’s a tactile model of a brain to his right where he’s been doing some research. Highlighted parts of it indicate the places where a neurosurgeon, an old acquaintance of Helen Cho, has given some of his insight.
“No, Tony, listen to me,” the other man plants himself in front of Tony with an earnest look in his eyes. He’s holding onto Tony’s shoulders and even Baby Bart is quietly gnawing on his fingers. “I don’t know about the others, but for my part I am
that had gone when he’d tried in the past. “Now, go do your homework. I don’t need want to take the shop away, but I’ll have to unless I want your mother breaking down my door. Especially if it’s for something as easy as geography.”
Turns out, when and if Tony gets back on earth, he has one more thing to rub on the good captain’s face.
“You boys coming in or should we start without you?” Natasha materializes behind the king. Tony startles, but T’Challa merely inclines his head to motion Tony forward. The mechanic feels his phone buzzing in his pocket as he walks over to the door. He pulls it out and grins at the messages he’s received.
“Tony had a contingency plan,” Natasha says seriously. Tony opens his mouth to contradict her, but she merely shoots him a glare and so he remains silent. “We started working on it the minute Ross came to give his pitch. Research, evidence, anything that could incriminate Ross was dug up no matter how hard he tried to hide it.”

“Like the 1983 AC/DC tour shirt is the same as the ’77?”
The soldier was desperate to ask what they had talked about to incite such a change, but luckily kept his mouth shut. He bounced the baby in his arms a little more desperately as he fussed harder, his cries louder and more heartbreaking.
“You are all beautiful people and are welcomed to my sanctuary any time you like as long as you bring dessert,” Tony says and then unashamedly turns around and makes grabby hands at the plate in the soldier’s arms. Everyone laughs and rolls their eyes at their antics, and Steve blushes even brighter. He makes his way to where Tony is sitting, and then stops short when he notices there’s no place for him there. Tony can’t even hide his grin when Harley and Cooper, and Peter from the other side, glare at the soldier until he hands the plate and moves away. “You behave,” the mechanic says but it goes, as always, completely ignored.
, is what he said, if only to hear his friend laugh. Somehow, he’d started talking about doorknobs of all things.
“You didn’t feel like that two years ago,” Natasha bites back. He knew the moment his palm hit the table that she would come back with something vicious. They’ve been rubbing off against each other’s space for too long; they’re all angry and tense. He knows it was only a matter of time before they were biting each other’s heads off.
had called him. Even if
“It is possible. Risky, but possible,” Thor says and he looks a little more relaxed when he looks at Bruce. Rhodes steps forward too, his eyes glued to the scientist with the type of desperation the devout look at their saints. Steve can relate.
Before he can respond, Stark ambles from the entryway down into the hallway. He’s rubbing one of his eyes while he looks down at his phone, and the closer he gets the more noticeable it is. He’s been crying, and Clint’s chest grows tight. In the last two weeks he’s seen more of Stark than ever before, and he’s begun to notice a pattern. Even when they had been a so called team, none of them had ever interacted with the mechanic much, and sure he had a tendency to go on long inventing benders often, but—well, the archer can’t deny that while they had all been having dinners and movie marathons and the like nobody had ever really tried to bring the mechanic in. they had made an effort with everyone else, but not with him. Other than Cap’s fumbling and half-assed attempts, that is.
“oh, baby,” Tony says and his heart aches for this boy. Trying to be so strong for everyone else he’s tearing himself apart. “Baby, you don’t have to be strong for us, okay? We’re family. We take care of each other. If you need help, then we help each other. You don’t have to carry all of that inside you, honey. It’s not good for you.”
possibility, at that.
was making sure to pass around plates and napkins and making sure the giggling kids didn’t try to get a slice before everyone had sat down. Sam clapped him on the back with a chuckle as Scott beat it out of there and sat down next to his daughter.
on some new synthetic drug shit. He got hooked, and for a couple years it had been the hardest thing to try to stop. It had taken Peter, barely three years old at the time, petting his hair one morning while Harley read him from one of his books for him to finally stop. They’d been crying, these awful hiccupping sounds, as they had been the first ones to find him when they had come into his room for some cuddles.
“Owie, Unc’a ‘Ony?” Baby Bart says, and his little voice is filled with concern. Tony realizes he must have felt his trembling.
“The things that she showed me. I—remember what I said? When I asked you if—when I told you why I made him?”
“Anyway!” Harley says and leans forward in his seat. He squints his eyes at Tony. “Peter texted me,” he begins ominously. Tony groans. “No, no, no, now you gotta listen to me. Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Nah, buddy,” he says but his voice is rough. Sam gives his shoulder one last squeeze. “C’mon, let’s find the mini-bots before they destroy my building.” As if on cue, there’s the sound of cheering, both human and robotic, from the room down the hall. Tony laughs, and it’s a bit more genuine than it’s been in a long time. “You coming, Sam?”
don’t answer.
Tony thinks as he begins his speech. He pulls up the pictures, the documents, the uncovered footage and glimpses of conversation. The final nail in the Accords coffin, thank God.
Tony chuckles wetly, his hand going up and down on Peter’s back in a motion that sooths them both. “I know, Peter. I see it in your eyes every time you’ve been cooped up here. I know how much you miss it, and I hate seeing you unhappy. I hate seeing what this is doing to me. Tell me how I can help, bambino, tell me how we can work this out.” His voice gets a little desperate at the end, but he’s at the end of his rope as it is. And he hates that Peter is feeling so burdened all the time; Tony feels like that, has felt like that for decades, and he would never want his son to go through the same thing.
? The voice in his head asked. He felt his hands curled into fists and heard his labored breathing, and for a moment he didn’t recognize who or where he was. He was already going down to the lab to pick a fight with Tony, the man he had barely managed to get back, maybe, over something he knew nothing about. Natasha and T’Challa had no reason to lie to him; they had been the ones to help him, the entire team, the most. Why would they lie about this? He know, intellectually, that there was no threat. Ross was gone, the Accords were revised, they had been pardoned, but… God. Just when they had begun to feel safe, this happened.
like the right thing. The closer he got to the lab, the looser his chest felt and the easier it was to breathe. Maybe… maybe this was what it felt like to finally fight for the man he loved.
Tony was already at the entranceway when he turned around, baby asleep on his chest, and his eyes met Wanda’s square on. He was fidgeting, and Steve could tell it immediately put him, and Sam and Tasha, on edge, but his gaze didn’t waver. Wanda’s face was set in the same mask she always had when dealing with the genius, but thankfully her fingers weren’t sparking red magic. Steve didn’t know what he would do if he saw that again, truth be told. And then, proving once again the type of man he was, Tony said, “Good luck,” in such a solemn way that hit them all like a punch. He gave her a nod and strode out of the room after T’Challa gave him a smile and a comforting squeeze to his shoulder.
, he thinks again, even when he’s not exactly sure what it is that he means.
“Or that you’d left. I thought maybe you’d realized you made a mistake taking me back; I thought maybe that’s why you’d waited so long for us to… do that.”
, all floppy hair and big eyes, and—it turns his stomach.
but they could tell he was curious too. Wanda was eyeing him wearily and Vision placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. Steve guessed they had managed to make up when she didn’t immediately shake him off.
“Maybe later,” Steve says, not wanting to promise the boy something he can’t deliver.
He stands there for a while, breathing in the ever present smell of grease and Tony’s expensive cologne, and lets the sense of
Steve thought about leaving for the gym, or maybe even a run, after he left the others in the dining room. He tried to shake the look on Wanda’s face out of his mind, but it seemed to haunt him as he worked his way to the training room. He felt torn in two, in that moment, but he couldn’t shake the guilt that gnawed at him the longer he was away from his friend. Not for the first time, he wondered if he had made the right choice in letting her go on her own. He’d worked himself into a state, not even changing into his workout clothes or taping his hands, and had decided to say to hell with everything and accompany Wanda and the others, when he turned around and caught a glance of the training shield Tony had made for him to train with.
“Tony, really, I—“
“I think it should be you,” the king says as they face one another across the holographic table in Tony’s office at the New Avengers Compound.
He looks back at the same time the man turns to give the room a last once-over, and feels his heart stutter in his chest.
“Well,” Steve says and claps his hand. Despite the awful feeling in his chest, they can’t stand around and brood. They should be getting themselves settled if they were to stay, or talk options. He forces himself to keep the grimace off his face as he thinks about the loops they’d have to jump through if they wanted to leave the Compound. “We should get ourselves settled. We can start by looking for our rooms.”
“Shhh, no. No. I’m not telling you this to make you feel bad, honey. I’m just—I just want you to know, Peter, that you don’t have to be strong. Not for us. Not when it’s hurting you this much. I know, baby, I know how much you miss patrolling. I know how much you miss going to Queens to see Nerd—”
“What happened?!” Bucky explodes after a while, concern and anger in his tone. “What did that bastard do to you?! Steve, I swear I’ll kill him!”
Tony had had plenty of practice with that before, and the team would just be another tally to add up. This wouldn’t break him. He chose to ignore how that voice had begun to sound much quieter the more time he spent around them, and how much louder the broken part of himself kept crying out. He was Iron Man, goddamn it, he was forged with stronger metal than that.
Anger and disappointment flared up in his chest again, and he sullenly made his way into the kitchen. Clint and Cooper watched him slam cupboards and doors and serve himself a heaping plate of leftovers. He sat on the other side of the table, his expression clearly screaming to be left alone, as he shoveled food into his mouth. The boy and his father finished their own meal quickly before making a strategic retreat from the kitchen.
“Oh,” he’d breathed out, taking a step back. His heart filled with sadness and longing so intense for a second that he’d had to blink up at the ceiling for a second. Then, he looked down at Peggy, her soft smile and bright eyes, and couldn’t find it in himself to be upset at her happiness. “Hey, tell me about him?”
“Exactly. I thought… well, I thought that the others would understand the UN’s point. I thought they’d see that we were dangerous, and needed reassurance. The alternative… If I had said no,” Tony sighs and scrubs a hand over his face. “The truth is, Cooper, that if I had said no I don’t know what would have happened. Where we are right now would not even exist anymore, maybe. So I said yes, and I immediately started working on a way to amend the accords because—“
—“Viz blurts out. Tony stares back at him with a small smirk. Seeing JARVIS shine through every once in a while puts a smile on his face every time.
“Tony,” Steve says near anguished. “Of course us. All of us. We were supposed to be your team. We were supposed to have your back.
had taken everything away two years ago.
“Pete,” the mechanic says tiredly. God, the throbbing in the back of his head is killing him, but he feels like he needs to do this. He thinks that their conversation is long overdue. If tony’ heart has to be shattered, completely, its best they get it over with. Whatever explanations Rogers has will never be enough, but Tony is not the same type of asshole he is. Tony can listen, if only because nobody gives him the same curtesy when he needs it. “Please go with the others.”
“Yeah, like you know so much about it!” Harley sticks his tongue out at him and Tony smiles fondly.
“Harley Keener,” the boy says in a clipped tone. He takes the soldier’s hand, and Steve knows he’s gripping as hard as he can. It doesn’t do much, obviously, but the soldier knows the intent behind the gesture. It’s a warning in and of itself, and that’s even before the boy smiles up at him and says, “And I know of two elements on the periodic table that could destroy vibranium. Bet Tony would be able to get them for me if I asked.”
He’s about to retract when he sees the giddy excitement on Peter’s face. It’s like someone told the kid all his projects would be funded for the rest of his life. Which, they are, but Tony hasn’t gotten around to telling him that quite yet. The kid nods his head, making him look like a bobble headed doll, and Tony finds himself smiling.
“Per favore, babbo, tornare,” Tony closes his eyes tight at the fear and pain he hears in his kid’s voice. Peter knows the language well enough, but he doesn’t make it a habit of speaking it to anyone other than Tony and Morgan. And that is only when and if he’s feeling particularly emotional. To hear it now breaks Tony’s heart. He wants nothing more than to get off the fucking donut and go home, hug his kids close, and keep them safe.
a part of him to know that he didn’t have that right. Of the bridges he had burned in his stupid self-righteous quest, that’s the one that hurt the most to lose. He didn’t have the right to ask after Tony, didn’t have the right to demand answers or even offer comfort. Not at the moment, at the very least, because while Tony might have accepted him back in a way everyone knew that the genius hadn’t forgiven him. Nobody, not even Steve, had expected him to even give him as much of a reprieve as he already had. Vision might be trying to keep Tony from getting any more hurt by Steve, but the blond was also thankful that he had stopped him at that moment. The mechanic wasn’t someone who opened up easily for anyone; much less the man who had, both physically and metaphorically speaking, shattered his heart.
mirage Steve is almost convincing. If it weren’t for the quick glance he throws to the side.
They lapse into silence as they both eat their lunch. Tony thinks of something to say, something wise and comforting, and wishes that Jarvis were still around. Either version of him would know what to say to a kid who’d just gotten his dad back better than Tony himself would. Howard had never been the comforting or fatherly type. He’d never played soccer with him on the backyard or driven him to school or helped him with his homework. He can’t exactly relate his experience to that of the kid currently sitting next to him. He does, however, know how devastating it is to feel abandoned. To feel as though your opinions aren’t important; especially when you’re vivacious and intelligent and kind like the boy now making him company.
“That you were alone, and I was the only one who could help you,” Peter says, coldly. Tony feels a chill run down his spine at the words and the implication that this is what Peter has been thinking for the past two years. “Me, zio Rhodey and Viz are all that’s left. I know Viz turned off his transponder weeks ago, I know where he is, and zio Rhodey has enough on his hands with the UN and the Accords. I wasn’t going to let you—” Peter is still looking at the floor but his shoulders are shaking in that way they do when he’s trying his best not to cry and Tony’s heart breaks in his chest.
friends, but don’t for a second think I believe you. You
“I’m surprised Stark lets anyone down there,” Wanda’s accented voice cuts in. Steve winces. He doesn’t know why her words always sound so hostile when she speaks of the mechanic. He doesn’t know if he’s just making it up in his head now, after everything, or if it had always been like this. He tries to stifle the unease that thought brings up.
since Avengers Tower. Since before Ultron.
“It will.”
“No, we thought we still had months,” Peter is frantically tapping at his phone again. “There’s no reason for him to be at Green-Wood right now. He hates that place. I don’t know—“Peter runs a nervous hand through his hair, and Harley steps closer to the teenager.
1) this might be longer than I anticipated. This seems to happen every time i delve into Tony's emotional depth so bear with me.
Hey y'all!
your mom. Every time he came down to the facility or we called him up at your house, we couldn’t shut him up about you guys. He’d always be telling us how fast Nate was growing, and how smart you and Lila were, and how damn strong your mom was. How she could be able to take over the whole world if she wanted. I’ve lost count of how many conversations we had about how intelligent and beautiful and amazing and kind your mom is.” And it’s true, too, though Tony is embellishing a bit. All those conversations about Laura had come second hand to him, from Steve or Nat or Sam and sometimes even Wanda when she could look past her inherent dislike for the engineering. It doesn’t make Barton’s devotion any less true. “It’s just that, sometimes… well, sometimes dads do things that we can’t understand. Sometimes they make decisions because they think they’re the right ones and we can’t understand them, but we know that they’re just trying to do what’s best for us. Your dad… Cooper, your dad was trying his best to do what he could to protect you. Because he loves you all so damn much.”
When he opens his mouth as if to say something, Tony finishes his thought, “it shouldn’t have been me.”
“No,” Tony says, sincerely for the first time in a long time. Rhodey gives him a surprised look, but doesn’t ask. “We’re a mess. We’ve been a mess for—this entire time, but we talked. We—it was hard, but I think we both needed it.”
“Yeah,” Tony says quietly. “She was around a lot when I was very little. She’d say naughty words about Howard and rib Jarvis to make me smile.” He chuckles at the memory.
“Tony can feed him just fine. He’s been taking care of him for months,” she said, and there was barely controlled anger in her tone.
“This is different. You never go out. You can’t even be in the same room as Viz. You don’t let Ms. Potts in. Happy is barely around and even with Rhodey you just… I just. I just want you to be happy,” the last part is a whisper in the sudden quiet of the room. FRIDAY has turned off the television and the lights are down low.
“Oh, God,” Steve says in a painful groan. Tony blinks at his eyes to get the stinging to go away.
“Who did you lose?”
Steve walks towards Rhodes and Hogan with heavy steps. He doesn’t feel right, leaving Tony behind, but he also knows a dismissal when he hears one. Tony might have been ready to share stories about Howard and Peggy, since Steve had known and cared for both, and give a glimpse about his mother. Though the soldier doesn’t know
(See the end of the chapter for
when in truth he had been terrified.
“Listen, I’m not here to tell you how to run your life. God knows your punk ass won’t listen to me no matter how hard I try, but I need you to understand something. The first time you, when you—” Bucky gets this faraway look in his eyes, and Steve feels a knot forming in his stomach at the fear in them. “When you left him the first time was bad, Steve. Finding him… the way that I did scared the shit out of me. He was my friend, too, and even though I never picked sides I’m sure he thought that I did.”
sooner rather than later.
“I just—“Steve swallows and drops his eyes from his boy—well, ex-boyfriend’s face. He shrugs, stalling for time, while the voice in the back of his head that sounds suspiciously like Bucky tells him that he still has time. Being the stubborn ass that he is, Steve forces the words out his mouth. “I don’t think this is working anymore, Tony.”
“That was the plan all along,” Tasha said ruefully. She nodded at T’Challa, and then a projection of the revisions popped up on the conference table. The name, the Edwin and Maria Protection for and from Super Powered Individuals Act popped up and pride threatened to burst Tony’s chest, seemed to catch most of the people around off guard.
Tony can’t help it, he chuckles wholeheartedly at his son’s excitement. His heart fills with an adoration for this kid, this boy who had trusted Tony to care for him and love him unconditionally, and lowers the bundle a little. He uses a finger to carefully peel back the thin blanket she’s wrapped in, and angles her face towards Peter. The boy gasps, and Tony can see the tears in his eyes even though he’s smiling so wide. “Come on in, Petey. I think it’s time you met your sister.”
“You don’t know anything about the mechanic,” Harley tells Wanda without even looking at her. He shakes his head, and grabs the tablet they had been messing with. “Let’s go, we can finish this in my room,” he tells Peter and the other boy nods mutely.
The panic threatens to choke him so he forces himself to get moving because the longer he stands there, the harder it will be for him to do what’s right. He knows,
“They behave,” there’s the sound of something crashing and a beeping noise from the hallway. Sam laughs when Tony winces. “For the most part. DUM-E seems to be the real troublemaker.”
Rhodes is standing at parade rest in front of the Bentley when Steve gets to the main road. Hogan is standing next to him, and he appears to be having a heated discussion with the Colonel. Rhodes is nodding, his eyes hidden behind a pair of aviators, and his expression grim. Hogan is the first who spots him, and even though he’s wearing sunglasses as well, Steve can tell he’s scanning the area for his boss. His mouth tightens and he takes a step in the blond’s direction, but Rhodes stops him though he doesn’t take his eyes off Steve. He swallows the flash of irritation at their reactions, God, it’s not like he’d hurt Tony. Especially in a place that feels so sacred.
“FRIDAY, where’s Tony?” Laura’s voice sounded a little desperate. Steve didn’t know how she’d even gotten the words out. His own throat felt as dry as a desert.
, Steve thinks with a jolt. Tony hadn’t felt safe in the facility he had created with the team he had helped found, and they had all let him walk away. Had joked with him on the phone about how he still wasn’t a team player. Had let Wanda—“Dear God, what did we do to you,” Steve says out loud.
for them again.
“Tone—“
Tony swallows the mouthful of ham and rye and tries not to squirm. It’s not that he was purposefully withholding information. It’s just that… okay, who is he kidding, that’s exactly what he was doing. “Everything is so… shitty,” there’s a sigh and a giggle on the other side, and Tony bites his lip. “It’s hard enough as it is. I… I guess I wanted to keep the peace for a bit longer.”
“No, babbo, no,” Peter says, and he’s crying again. Grabbing tightly to Tony’s chest as the man drags him back into a hug. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, dad.”
Steve clenches his fists on the seat, and hears the upholstery tear at the force of it. He closes his eyes and focuses on his breathing. Reminds himself to keep in the here and now. Reminds himself that there is nothing he can do to go back in time and beat the people who hurt his friend to a pulp. He doesn’t know why Rhodes is telling him this, but he’s glad nonetheless. It explains so much of how Tony reacted to the team, how weary of them he was at the beginning, and his chest hurts with the realization that he’d been taught to be weary of people from such an early age. And this isn’t even counting everything that Howard may have done, which has been heavily implied by Rhodes and Tony and sometimes even Natasha.
Stark had walked away from him after that, leaving him looking after him with guilt and anger and a surprising feeling of empathy in his chest. Clint had stood there until Natasha had all but stormed out of the green house, murder in her eyes when she saw the archer standing alone, and had barked at him asking him where Stark was. It wasn’t until then, until his
Roge—
In the weeks they have been back, they have all tried to reestablish their routines. After a couple frosty days, Vision and Wanda are back making meals together. Scott and Clint spend their days training, watching trash television, or talking to their families. Scott has left a few times to visit with his daughter. Clint has had no luck convincing Laura to let him do the same. Natasha spends her days with them, polishing her knives, or out about the city. Steve knows she’d missed New York almost as much as he had. Him, Sam and Bucky quickly establish a routine running together or training in the early morning. Sam, after some mysterious donation and a few strings pulled, is back at the VA doing what he considers his duty. Bucky is usually attending his mandatory therapy sessions or out with Natasha or circling around the library trying to find something else to read. Rhodes still won’t spend much of his time with them, and often disappears
I almost got him killed?! The king who lied,
“Anthony,” the king calls his attention. Tony smiles warmly at him, something that would be a feat for anyone else calling him by that name. With the younger man, it never seemed like much of a problem despite the baggage the mechanic associates with it. “I’m glad you are here,” he says and gives Tony’s hand a friendly squeeze.
, around him.
“He’s busy right now, bud,” Steve responded as he walked into the kitchen. The other kids were already sitting around the table, and Wanda and Vision were moving around the stove, clearly having picked up their old habit of trying out unfamiliar recipes.
protection, and about to eat
“Tony, come on!” Bucky’s scream breaks Steve from his stupor. He feels his head turn numbly to look at his best friend as he disconnects the call and then immediately begins dialing the number again. “come on, you stupid kid. Come on, you just have to answer. Come
Steve stared at his friend with wide eyes. This was a complete three-sixty from the past

been broken, because the ache in his ribs can’t be normal. The pressure as though the reactor,
“That’s enough, Colonel,” Tony says sternly. His fingers are shaking now, the emotional rollercoaster he has been on all day finally taking a toll, and he shakes his head when Rhodey glares at him. “Please, wait for me in the car with Happy. I’m assuming he’s the one that brought you.”
B) i apologize for this not being the much anticipated showdown with bird boy but i didn't think i would do it justice in my current state of mind + this idea came to mind and it. would. not. go. away. So here we are. Sorry if it's shitty.
“Yeah, well, I’ve tried everything,” Clint says as he leans against the glass. He hadn’t noticed until the weight was gone, but his arm had gone numb at some point. He rotated his shoulder to try to get the feeling back into it. “He’s been like this for hours.”
Hours later, once Tony tells Peter everything and they have an honest conversation with lots of crying and even more hugs, they are sitting on the sofa in front of the TV. Tony in the corner, head thrown back, while Peter rests his head on his lap and stretches on the couch. One hand grasps the fabric of Tony’s pants tightly even in sleep. Tony, for his part, keeps carding his fingers through his boy’s hair and leaning down to press a kiss to his head.
“And I didn’t bother to ever ask about your family,” Steve husks out while shaking his head gently when Tony opens his mouth to protest. His thumb makes gentle sweeps over Tony’s bottom lip. “Tony, enough. Let me take some of the blame for once. It doesn’t have to be just you.”
What he was met with was silence.
friend, his companion, his partner, his bonded… Tony was the love of his life, and now all of that is gone. Now Steve has no idea what the hell is going on with him, with his son; he doesn’t know if they’re okay, if they’re holding it together or if they’ve started drifting apart. Grief is an ugly, hard thing, and sometimes it takes the best of us. His heart breaks every time he starts to wonder if Peter feels abandoned, or if Tony feels alone.
” the blond is shaking his head vehemently before Tony has even finished talking. “When did that happen?” Tony’s eyes are unfocused in a way that makes Steve sick; he’s seen this before. Dear God, has he ever. “When did us against the world become you against
“Yeah, bullshit,” Harley almost growls at him.

“Is today—“Harley begins
. Why did he decide to trust the witch over him, why did he decide Tony was worth so little, why did he pick Barnes over the team,
Natasha and Rhodey’s sharp intake of breath are loud in the sudden stillness of the room. Tony hangs his head in shame. His constant fighting and losing with that particular nightmare is always fresh in his mind. He never seems to get over it, and it leaves him feeling weak.
“Yeah, bud. It worked! It worked this time!” and Tony, because there is not a single thing he can ever keep from his son, can feel the tears running down his cheeks. He’s smiling wide enough to hurt, and his heart is pounding to a beat that aches, but god. God. It’s the best news, and the only thing he could think about was sharing this moment with his son. His constant.
The truth drops on Steve like an anvil. He remembers that conversation; remembers the flippancy and matter-of-fact way Tony had talked about the kid. How he’d mentioned he’d been crushed on the battlefield in Sokovia; “we dropped a building on him,” Tony had said. He’d been trying to explain the Accords, trying to tell them why they were necessary, when everyone had already made up their mind. When
The suited Tony says. There’s desperation and betrayal raw on his voice.
“Is that—“
“You’ve always tried to do the right thing, Steve,” Tony says quietly, ear pressed onto his chest against his heartbeat. “I’ve known that from the start.”
So that’s exactly what he does. Puts himself together, wills the excess of himself that keeps bursting at the seams, and gets out of the bathroom. Methodically, he picks up his watch and his wallet and makes his way to the garage. FRIDAY is mournfully silent as he goes, wishes him a quiet good luck that makes him close his eyes and wish for sarcasm and a British accent, and gets into his car. Nobody drives him anymore; Happy having left along with Pepper at Tony’s request. He avoids his eyes in the rearview mirror and revs out of the Tower’s garage.
the mantra runs frantic circles in his mind the longer he watches the memory play out in front of him. His eyes never leave Tony. Not when he cuts that particular scenario, or when he starts the next, or the next, or the
tell me though he’s tried, then it’s something that is eating at him. And that tells me enough. It wasn’t all your fault. We were your team, and we failed you. We should have trusted you more than we did. We turned our backs on you, and that’s on us.”
Some things can never be forgotten, but forgiving them? That's... well, that's not easy, but it's doable. especially if they're wanted so much by both.
Tasha snorts derisively. He can see where Tony learned that response then. “Something has to give, Phil. That’s what we’re doing, too, trying to keep the peace. It’s not helping, all it did was get Stark punched in the face and Rhodey swearing at everyone.”
, he thinks fearfully
“Almost, it’s a square. Can you say square?”
“He’s getting the flu,” Peter said, already munching on some cereal. He had managed to get himself a couple of sandwiches, an apple, a cup of jello that was meant for the girls and Nate, his cereal and a cup of coffee. Harley, with slightly less food, was munching not less enthusiastically. Tony turned to him with an unimpressed look at the sheer amount of food, and raised an eyebrow. “Cooper texted us last night,” he said pointing at Harley, who nodded and went back to his book. “Said his parent couldn’t sleep ‘cause the Bot kept crying. Think he got a fever or something.”
“Oh, give me a break, rich boy,” Clint snorted derisively. His own hands are crossed over his chest, and he stands on a near mirror image of the other man. “I came out of retirement because of you! Don’t talk to me about shitty choices when we’re still trying to fix
So Steve does what he has proven himself to be very apt at, and he runs. All the way across the pond and keeping only the bare minimum news on his former lover. Just enough to reassure himself that even though they might be together anymore, right here in this universe, Tony still exists.
“Do you promise?” Steve says, sounding like the little runt who stood up to Bobby Westminster in the alley behind the butcher’s for bugging Lil’ Ricky.
“I’m afraid he’s not in the tower at the moment, Boss Lady,” the AI’s voice sounds humanly distressed.
“she’s got a com unit on her. She’s smart. She’s powerful. If she were in trouble, she would have let us know already. Nothing we can do by freaking out about her. Remember last time?” and yeah, Steve knows he sounds a little upset. He can’t exactly help her. Wanda has been reckless in the past, and even though Steve
“I’m not letting you lose anyone else, Peter. Do you hear me? I’m not putting you through this ever again. You don’t have to be scared.”
And now they were gone, and he was left wondering how he could have ever thought that he was worthy of it. How his fool-self ever thought that the blood on his hands wouldn’t exact its revenge for the lives he’d taken.
, Tony says in his mind. He knows its not possible; there have been plenty of people who have tried. Pepper lasted the longest, but even she couldn’t stand all the baggage that came with loving Tony Stark. Not even the epitome of human perfection could apparently do that. He wants to throttle Rhodes a bit. Peter is a kid, someone who had already waded into too much of their shit to be dragged in again. Tony has already done the kid a disservice by making him and unofficial Avenger. Despite how desperate he had been, to bring the others in and prove to Ross and the UN that there were good super powered people out there, he never should have brought the kid. Sure, he was able to pick his battles, had already been doing it every day in his ridiculous pajamas, and Tony

, was a shot at not having the same regrets about the Captain as he did about his father. His whole life since their passing, Tony had wished for a shot to tell them the truth. That they had shattered and damaged him beyond help; that every word Howard said in derision for his only son had left a mark far deeper than the signet ring that had hit Tony in more than one occasion. He’d wanted, for years, to tell his mother that kissing the places Howard had hit in hopes of making things better had never helped. Tony had too many regret, his parents, Obie, Ty, Pepper…
when the pain and the guilt become too much, but at this very moment he can have this. He can allow himself to push aside the lingering resentment and bask in the reality of this mismatched group of freaks he’s found himself falling in love with.
“You know, people say that doing the same thing expecting different results is the definition of insanity,” Laura says as Nate rubs his little face on her shoulder.
The other Steve says, and the real one jerks on the other side of the glass. He brings a fist up to the glass separating him from the scene but can’t bang on it as he wishes to do. He can’t let Tony send him away. Not now when he knows that this,
Okay, okay. He’s got this. He forces himself to take a deep breath. One, two, three, four, in. hold. One, two, three, four, out. Hold. He can hear Steve’s voice in his head telling him to get his breathing under control; can feel the phantom weight and warmth of his hand running up and down his back. Tony hates that the process is so fucking familiar to him now; he’s been dreaming up fake Steve’s for a while now, worse still after Morgan came around as he was faced with the monumental task of parenting two children alone, so the process is familiar. He hates himself for needing that comfort so much, but he has never been able to grow out of it. Not even in the last two years without a husband.
sorry. You deserved better than what I gave you. Even if we didn’t talk much, or we weren’t as close as me and Cap, you deserved more credit that what I gave you. I don’t know what happened in Siberia, but I know it’s bad. And if Cap hasn’t told me about it, then I know it’s pretty bad, but I also know,” he says and bends his head when Tony tries to drop eye contact. “I also know, that if he
“another hundred to the college fund, sir,” FRIDAY chirps and Steve would swear there’s amusement heavy in her lilting voice.
“You wouldn’t have had to if you weren’t such a blabber mouth!”
Steve and I have had a lot of growing up to do. I'm glad I finally got some inspiration to get back to this story.
Tony woke up, every day, because he had a kid at home that went from calling him Mr. Stark, to boss, to Tony, to Mr. Dad, and Tony would now, more than ever, burn everything in the universe to see him safe.
But it’s enough to make him a little more centered. Rhodey is a god amongst men sometimes. Or all the time, if one were to ask Tony. “Steve, I’m sorry,” he finally says softly once his brother is gone. He still can’t force himself to meet the other man’s eyes.
“But Stark still won’t come out, and they still won’t make an effort to meet him half way,” Phil says, annoyed.
“There are fifty states and Mount Rushmore is in South Dakota, I’m practically an expert. Now, get, shortstack!” Tony cuts the call and chuckles to himself. He’s going to be on the receiving end of so much sass when he talks to the boy again.
the kid, and it breaks a bit of Tony away.
, that it will make the panic worse, but it was the only thing that he thought to do. Tony’s hands scramble to grasp one of the blonde’s wrists and grab a handful of his t-shirt. Though, Steve notices with so much relief his knees threaten to buckle, he’s not pushing him away. He’s simply holding on. Dear God, Steve would stand just like this for the rest of his life if it let Tony find some semblance of peace.
Sam merely narrows his eyes at him.
, he vows to himself. He has done far too much breaking, and though he’s shit at fixing this, he doesn’t have a choice but to try about this.
Tony was an idiot to think Peter was smarter than his fathers.
On a whim, he’d placed a long dining table in the New Avengers’ Facility. Much like one at the old manor, this one had been tinted with bittersweet memories too. It’s where he makes his way to eat lunch, however, because despite the fact that he’d used it as place to run away, it’d always brought him comfort.
“More than anything,” Steve says, doesn’t say
“Spider-Man,” Nat says, ear pressed against her phone but eyes wide as the camera now zooms on the image of the kid,
“Move,” is all Harley says as he tries to move past. Steve plants himself and refuses.
It was a rough year on all of them. Though Howard’s will came to ease a lot of the burden, and his wealth even more so, Jawwis and Ana still had to fight tooth and nail with every goddamn organization to keep them together. In the end, it worked out for the better, but Tony is ashamed to say he didn’t make it any easier on his adoptive parents. Though they were roughly the same age, they were a year and some months apart, Natasha had taken their loss better than he had.
. It’s about time Steve does the same.
If tony were hard pressed into giving an answer he would say that he had the most peaceful of rests that night. He would say that he didn’t toss and turn half the night trying to not freak out about the next day. He would like to say that once he got to sleep, he didn’t wake up to nightmares about the vision the witch had given him or the things that he had done. He would like to say that he didn’t wake up, gasping, clutching at his chest for a reactor that hadn’t been there for years. He would like to say that, halfway through the struggle, he hadn’t just given up and gone down to his workshop to keep tweaking the exoskeleton upgrades for Rhodey.
, you know?”
, the thought came sudden and sharp and it left him reeling. He had never thought about what he did as something that would eventually lead to this decision. Back in his time, people didn’t really talk about the aftermath of their trauma. That wasn’t a conversation for… ever, really. Men who had come back from war had been called heroes, and if they came back a little different, a little jumpier, a lot more despairing, then they were called heroes and people looked the other way. Maybe he had gotten too used to that, even when he thought himself different and his mother and Bucky had called him sensitive, maybe he had tried to hold too much of his past with him to this time.
Steve braces himself to be yelled at and cursed. He closes his eyes against the flurry of words that may come out of Tony’s mouth. He doesn’t know what to expect, really. It could be the hot, burning curses and yells or even worse, Tony’s cold, precise jabs. He thinks he’d rather have the former; they tend to hurt less. What he doesn’t expect is for the genius to take a long, hard look at him and turn back to his parents.
Tony wanted to say,
Tony thinks as his eyes meet Rhodey’s across the room. Natasha gives his hand a squeeze and T’Challa places a hand on the small of his back to lead him forward. He doesn’t know how this meeting will go, if it’ll be another repeat of the last to add more fuel to his nightmares or if they will actually make a difference, but he’s willing to try. T’Challa had said he was a man of convictions, and he thinks he wants to prove the man right. His eyes meet determined blue, and he takes a deep breath.
They haven’t had a sense of
“Good morning, beloved,” Tony says back, like every morning, his fingers still tangled in his hair. And then, like always, he presses his mouth against Steve’s and asks, “you love me, real?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“She wouldn’t hurt me,” Harley says smugly. They’d met once and Tony was one hundred percent sure the kid was right. “She said so. She’d just take it out on me.”
Now, alone, he has to take care of a six month old baby that carries both their last names and serves as a reminder of everything they have lost. He carries the weight of his best friend’s paralysis and the burden of introducing Viz into a world that wants him locked in a cage. And to top it, his son, the one person who has been with him unconditionally through every shit storm the past year and a half has thrown them, is going out and risking his neck to protect his city. Sometimes, Tony wonders how his heart doesn’t give out under the stress. Most days, he thinks that the pain is too much to carry right before even more shit gets piled onto his shoulders.
“I just—I don’t know, babbo. I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” Peter cries, hands trembling.
. Suddenly I was back in that goddamn dorm room, patching him up, while he tried his best not to cry because
“Yeah, I think—I think I could,” Tony says, a warmth spreading through his chest as he leans back against the couch and Peter rests his head on his shoulder. “Don’t take it personal, though, okay?”
“Sorry, that never gets old,” Steve knows that he’s not sorry at all if the grin on his face is anything to go by, but he doesn’t mind. Not when there’s the solid, warmth weight of the man’s thigh pressed tightly next to him and the constant brush of their elbows as they eat in companionable silence. Tony’s fingers brush his as they grab their mugs, and Steve turns in time to see him hide his small smile on the rim of his cup. He can’t help but smile back and resolutely ignores Rhodes’s muttered “Really? Right in front of my cereal?”
, he admits.
“We pushed you,” Steve says after a moment. One of his hands has Tony’s fingers pressed against his chest, and he’s taking in lungfuls of air that the genius finds himself mimicking. Already, he can feel the panic subsiding. He just feels tired now. “I—Tony, I thought—In Leipzig, I thought you’d come for war,” he starts making shushing noises again when Tony breaks out on a litany of

“I’m so sorry, Peggy,” he’d breathed out. His training on consent and sexual harassment immediately kicking in. he should have asked first, damn it. “I should have asked if you were all right with me kissing you. It’s just—I’ve been—I just mean, I—”
also, this got really dark for a second so read the warnings.
and I didn’t want to feel like that ever again. I love you; I love you so much and not being able to help you hurts,” Steve turns, tears in his eyes, to look at Tony.
“My sister.” Tony hadn’t expected her to admit to that.
, it seems like one of the most important truths.
. They were in the living room of the compound, Tony having moved across to the west wing when he couldn’t stomach to breath the air that once contained
“He wasn’t, though,” Sam says forcefully. He lays a hand on Tony’s arm when the other man is about to continue their walk. “Tony, look,” he shakes his head as if exasperated with himself. “The idea of keeping tabs on people like that didn’t sit well with me, that’s true. But I also went with him because he’s my friend. The dude that gave me back a purpose when I felt like I was stuck after my spotter died. He… I mean, he’s Captain America, you know? And that blinded me, a bit. No,” he chuckles mirthlessly and Tony sees something he recognizes all too well in the other man’s eyes. Self-loathing. “It blinded me a lot. It blinded me to the guy who made me who I was. Riley and I did what we did because of
“Like hell!” Rhodey and Peter say at the same time. The others had begun to get up from their seat, though Sam remained resolutely in his, but then they pause and look at the others apprehensively.

And yeah, maybe he won’t be going outside with the shield and the cowl for a while. Maybe he will decide not to carry the world on his shoulders anymore, but he will still have his team. Tony has proven that he’s loved him, even at his worst, and that he will continue to do so even when he falls. So, maybe, just
his mind screams.
“Is he okay?” Tony asked and poked Clint on the arm. The archer merely grumbled and readjusted and then went back to sleep. Baby Barton had face planted onto Tony’s chest and was gnawing at his shirt.
“He’s—“
“Mmmm,” he says concomitantly. Natasha has been trying to get him to talk about his feelings since she joined them in Wakanda. The only thing he had managed to actually be truthful about had been Bucky, and isn’t that a bitch. Used to be that he would rather walk through glass than talk about what Bucky’s condition was doing to him.
“Please,” Laura says and Tony turns in time to catch the eye roll she gives him as she plates some food for Lila. “He’s taken it as a personal challenge at this point. By now, I’m pretty sure the kids have up to half their doctorates payed for.”
“And why didn’t you tell me?”
“All of them, even Wanda, except me.” Tony shook his head with finality and took a step back. “I didn’t understand why you wouldn’t listen to me. I tried—the pens. Remember? When I tried to get you to sign the accords? Roosevelt’s pens. I hunted down for them. God, I was so focused—so—so
The ugly part of his brain asks,
Howard had… loved Maria, in his own way. One could even argue that he had worshipped her; her kindness and her subtle intelligence. Where he was harsh and unyielding in his ideas, she was soft and persuasive. While he’d been ruled by what he thought was reason, even when it wasn’t, she had balanced that with empathy. He’d admired, and perhaps even envied, her kindness. For that reason, he’d often caved in what he considered her “frivolities.”
Bucky: Steve, I swear to God. Call.
because Tony’s mouth curls into a painful mimicry of a smile and his eyes get sad. He glances away, turns back and offers Steve a tiny wave, and then turns to walk away.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” Peter whispers, almost biting through his lip. Tony forces it out from between his teeth with a thumb, then tries to wipe the tears that don’t seem to stop. Tony knows he’s in a similar state, but still, the compulsion is there. “He’s already hurt you so much, dad. It feels like—”
“Do you have a mission for us?” There was a hard edge in the Maximoff girl’s voice.
“I just don’t know what to do, Laura,” he admits, and he closes his eyes tightly to stave the moisture gathering in the corners of his eyes. “Every damn day I feel like I’m losing him.” he hears his wife sigh and then there’s a pressure on his side. When he opens his eyes, she’s leaning against the glass at his side; his arm comes around her automatically and she leans into him further. Nate is still making displeased noises, but he’s a bit more settled. Clint’s fingers comb through his thin hair, and they shake. God, to think he could have lost all of this.
Peter’s wide eyes move from Tony’s face to the empty bottle of rum to his right, and the engineer winces. Christ, he’s just as bad as Howard ever was. Why he thought playing house with Peter was ever a good idea, he doesn’t know. Though, looking at the lost kid in front of him, he knows exactly why he offered the Parker kid help. He should have known he’d fuck it up somehow, though.
Scratch that, he knows Tony does.
Steve takes a fortifying breath and slowly makes his way to the end of the corridor. He takes a right at FRIDAY’s prompting and comes to face another wall. This is solid reinforced glass, and on the other side of the door is the great Tony Stark. Only he doesn’t look as sharp or debonair as his picture on the cover of Time magazine. He’s barefoot in threadbare jeans and a black singlet. He’s running hands through his hair that even from his position Steve can see trembling.
“And when you realized that hadn’t happened?”
in so long. He didn’t think he ever would again.
“A message for you from the Boss Lady, boss,” the AI says. When the genius prompts her, Laura’s voice comes through the speakers. “Lunch is ready, boys.”
