Steve shrugged. “That was a step to the right direction. It’s less overwhelming when you have to face kids than the others.”
He gently took it from Clint. He excused himself, heading to his bedroom.
*****
And nervous as shit about that evening date. He needed help.
They stride to the cabin.
, Tony shook the thought. He was selling the place, not keeping it.
“Steve Rogers” Tony repeated, it left his lips like silk. And Tony bit his bottom lip, feeling the shift in the room. Man, Steve was making him dizzy the way his moods changed. He made a step toward Tony. Tony took a step back, Steve could sense Tony nervousness around him.
The elderly couple stood as they saw him approached.
Tony moves to Sam side instantly. Arm over his shoulders. “Sam, you and I need to talk. I think we have a bond here.” They walked away from the wolves as they heard Sam laughing to whatever Tony was saying.
He was completely exhausted, so he’ll give the guy the benefit of the doubt. What could be worse at this point, really. “Bucky it is.” Rubbing his hand over his now stubble chin. “So here a question for you—are we hallucinating from a gas leak?”
“Thor!” he turned to a sultry red-head, who accompany her was a brunette man, whose hair was tied up, the brunette waved. Both were in there uniform, deputies. Well—a title to make this town close to normal.
They were bare. Nothing to hide their bodies from one another. The moon was full, bright and lit the room. Tony looked at him curiously. He was right; he was all muscles and every woman's fantasy. At least those that were straight.
He moved to look down the short hall that led to the side entrance. The door that Wade smashed through. Before going to bed, Tony found the door off the hinges. Clint place it back saying,
“Pepper called, she was worry about you being on your own. So, I came down and, on the way, asked Laura permission to let Clint come out to play.” Clint chime in, “Man, without the GPS coordinate on your car we have no clue how to get here. This place is weird.” He took another bite of his sandwich.
“I promised your friends to bring you back,” he smiled, “Before midnight.”
“Marvelous, much to tell.” Loki shared what has happen earlier in the Shop. Thor booming laugh could be heard the street over.
"Yes, we noticed."
“I know that place,” he paused, contemplating. “Best I show you the way. This place tends to be…tricky”
His best friend held back his laugh, “Hey Tones”
“I’m here Tony…remember that”
Rhodey took a seat at the counter as Clint started showing his new skill. “Well, at least that’s good to hear. Shifter courting.” They both smiled.
Tony woke to the smell of something good.
"And!" He pointed a finger upward, "Just in case, Clint will feel the same way. We knew what we were signing up for in becoming friends to Tony Stark."
Frigga let out a velvet laugh out, “Maybe.” Her eyes twinkled. She rose, “Now sweethearts let’s go exploring,” she took one little hand as the other kids started to trail behind her.
I am going to finish this AU. Believe me. I'm snail slow at it, but I'm determined.
They’ve found Tony and Rhodey cuddle up in the armchair. Didn’t look comfortable. Tony was sprawl out on his friend as Rhodey kept a secure arm around Tony waist.
Author’s Note
Clint saunter towards them “Hm, so
“You are right. It has taken centuries,” Thor smiled proudly. His friends stutter in their walk, not sure how to follow up on that.
He grabbed his face and duck down to kiss him. Steve groaned, and he quickly stood up. Gathering Tony in his arms. Tony smiled against his lips as he heard Steve growl. At least this time it was the good kind.
He shouldn’t trust him. Really, he shouldn’t trust anything from this man, but he does and relaxes and stroked them. Steve bite Tony shoulder, moaning as Tony continued the strokes. Tony mouth opened, a pant, as Steve circled and moved a finger into him. Tony grasped Steve chin and crushed their lips together.
"Are you alright, Boss?" he asked. "You seem… Off."
Slowly, Steve started to pull away. Tony frowned and tried to pull him back. Steve smiled at him with a bit of concern in his eyes. Tony felt his heartbreak a little bit. He knew he wouldn't be looking so sympathetic in a few minutes. Tony was sure of it.
Removing all the bolts and screws was rather easy. However, once he was done, Tony was faced with another problem. The countertop was made from a heavy stone. He couldn't be sure what type of stone (though he knew it wasn't marble or granite) but he knew that it at least felt disproportionately heavy. Although he certainly wasn't as strong on his own as he was with the armor, Tony was still a pretty strong guy. He figured at the very least, he could lower the countertop slowly and gently on to the ground. At least, that was what he thought.
"Fine," Tony said.
"So am I." Tony felt his lips quirk upwards as a couple more tears streamed down his face. It didn't last long, though.
"Iron Man," she quickly clarified with a smile. "A lot of people eat here just to see him fly by." She gestured over to Stark Tower and Steve quickly glanced around. He did indeed spot quite a few people looking in the tower's general direction intently, almost as if they were afraid if they blinked, they might miss something. It did warm Steve's heart a bit, but at the same time, it couldn't do much to help how down he was feeling.

"Nope," Tony said, popping the "p." "Did all my homework last night."
"Which would be?" Tony smirked.
"You're amazing," Tony whispered.
"Most powdered bio-weapons are pure white," Betty explained. "They only become discolored when crossed with something else."
Since the Avengers' quarters were on the second level of the penthouse, it was a relatively short ride for three out of four of them. Clint, Natasha, and Bruce got off the elevator as soon as it made its first stop, while Steve remained on board to continue his ride up to the fourth level, which served as his and Tony's apartment. Nat headed straight to her door – the one closest to the elevator – with Clint on her heels.
"Is that good?" Steve asked.
So, when Loki asked him what the Tesseract had shown him, he answered honestly and said his next target. Well, somewhat honestly. That wasn't all, but that's the information he had somehow telepathically been given and needed to share at that moment, and when asked what he needed to execute that mission, he once again answered with full honesty.
"Oh yeah," Tony said as the door slammed shut. "I almost forgot. Happy, this is Steve. Steve, Happy."
"No," Steve said. "Haven't been feeling sick at all." It was the truth. He wasn't feeling physically sick. Just… Confused, not only about the whole situation but his feelings, his sanity… Everything had changed in a split-second and Steve was having trouble processing it all. However, Wylie seemed to accept his answer and didn't press any further.
"An orphan hospital," Jessica said. "There can't actually be one. That just sounds too specific."
"Are you crazy?" Natasha questioned.
"I don't need one to tell you that if you don't back off a bit, Barton's going to break free of his restraints and shove that needle right through your…" Before Natasha could finish that sentence, Clint felt a sharp pain in his right arm.
Remember kids, if you don't leave a review, I'm gonna tie you to the bed and set this house on fire!
"Tony, you're too sick to go," Steve said. "You might feel okay now, but eventually you're going to get worse and there's no telling when." Tony frowned. Clearly, they were thinking along same lines when it came to that.
"I don't know how to do that." It was clear she felt guilty admitting that. "I usually just stand around and wait for someone to open the door for me, but obviously that's not going to happen with everyone gone for the weekend."
he thought.
The best people to recruit – in Adoniram's opinion – were those who had already made a name for themselves; titans of industry, celebrities, and people who were just successful in general. Often the general public worked as a hive mind. If someone famous or successful joined the Church, they would see an uptick in recruitment numbers, either because their fans and followers were feeble-minded people who just blindly followed the leader, or because they thought that the Peoples Unity Church would cause them to be successful as well. It didn't matter which they thought to Adoniram, if the Church could sink its teeth into them before their delusions faded. Once their minds were corrupted, it would be next to impossible to leave. (That was, you know, unless he failed to produce results again.)
"Lovely to see you, too." He still wasn't getting it.
Natasha raised her glass in kind and clinked it against Stark's before washing the juice down in one go. Not having expected the drink to be as sour as it was, she made a face as she set her glass down.
Now that they've done everything they needed to do in D.C., it's time for the Avengers to go home.
Tony could feel a crack form in his heart. Steve couldn't bring himself to say the words – probably for fear that if he said it aloud, it would happen – but Tony knew exactly what he meant. He was afraid that Tony was going to die; that the only way for him to be free of withdrawal pains would be if he died. It was a dark thought; one that Tony couldn't claim that he hadn't had himself, especially in the thick of it.
." Looking down, Steve took his hand.
"That doesn't make it any better," Natasha said. "I know in our line of work that it can happen at any time. I have known that for years and for some reason it did not feel real to me until it happened. Then it became very, very real. Then you got sick and I thought, 'not again. Please, not again.'" Clint gently rubbed her back.
"So, whatever was in that letter, it's dead now?" Clint asked.
At that point, Loki blacked out.
"But why?" Clint had to try hard not to laugh.
"No," Steve said. "You've done a lot for me and I really appreciate it, it's just…" A hard lump formed in Steve's throat. He couldn't say it.
"I'm sorry?"
"No," Tony said.
"I'd like to see him…"
Almost automatically, Knežević knew exactly what he needed to do. Forget the pipe-dream of becoming a billionaire! He was going to do what he should have done the second he got out of prison; take his girls back, by force if necessary, and he knew exactly the place to start.
"Can you at least tell me the nest is secure?" Natasha knew the line had top-level encryption and she was far away enough from those goons to at least feel comfortable enough to use the code she, Clint, and Coulson had developed for discussing Clint's farm and family. Coulson must not have been in a secure location, though, as he took a minute and went into another room before replying.
"I dropped the countertop." Tony didn't give any further explanation. Steve raised an eyebrow.
Unfortunately, life wasn't so kind. A wave of nausea crashed down on Tony hard. Before he knew it, he was surging to his feet and rushing back to the bathroom, the bowl in his hands being held just below his chin to catch any escaping bile. Desperately, Tony hoped he could make it through the rest of the flight without literally throwing his guts up.
"Yeah," Steve said. "I got that, but that doesn't mean you run out into the street!" As he was saying that, Steve realized that he was talking to a brick wall. Tony was drunk. Of course, he wouldn't see danger when it was right in front of him. Steve facepalmed at his own stupidity. That conversation could wait until Tony was sober. For right now, the bigger issue was getting him away from where he could hurt himself and getting him to rest.
After some more awkward moments from the shop to the market. Tony never felt more self-conscious and Loki irritability hit its limit as he told the people in the market place off.
“Hello father! All is well” he brightens as he moved to Odin.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam just laughed, “Loki was right. Definitely bad if you’re this pissed.”
*****
“My place,” he admitted, Tony watched as his ears turned red. “Oh?” he couldn’t help to tease him more.
Yes, Tony has read one or two while between science books. Might be over two. Okay, fine, it was a fantasy romance genre series, and he had to know what happened between Tracy and her hunky vampire boyfriend Gerard.
He asked the attorney if he ever been there, response
would have just grown up. Guess we know where Wade gets most of his behavior from," he gave Thor a pointed look.
“Well hello!” the older man full-toned voice responded. He moved to take his cane, as he took steps closer to Tony.
Rhodey gathered Tony in his arms. Tony held his friend tight. He really was happy to have these people in his life. His family.
Tony look to Sam as he finished. “I’m a teacher,” he answers.
******
Tony shut the door, went to the bathroom and went straight to bed. Burying his face in Steve’s pillow. And just as Steve promised, he was back.
Rhodey sighed and let out a short laugh, “Why couldn’t you guys do normal stuff. Like wine and painting classes.” Clint stuck his tongue out at Rhodey.
“You may leave Tony with me. He’s safe, promise” Loki crossed his heart.
Steve held them up and gave a small smile, “Thanks.”
Steve talked about how he enlisted with Bucky right behind him. He said he wanted to do something. He wasn’t sure how to explain it to Tony. But he wanted to protect those that were weak, and he also chucked it up that his people, the Shapeshifters, were also warriors.
It took him longer to figure out where he was going. People he passed by for directions had no clue and his stupid GPS kept telling him to make U-turns. He vowed that he’ll take the GPS apart and make it better.
Tony mouthed
“Hey Steve, guess who we found” they watched as Natasha entered, with another boy, Jared—Tony remembered.
“Biologically?”
Since some huge blond now blocked it and it was not Thor.
That name was familiar. The lion swiped his huge paw at them. The blond took hold of Tony, taking him closer to his side. Tony felt hot and stared at two, surprised, blue eyes.
“So, you being here now, means he found her.”
*****
“Who are you?” Steve growled. “Cut the bull Rogers!” Tony steel himself, “How do you know her?” he shouted.
Tony veered off, away from the others. He was wearing his supposedly normal sunglasses. Obviously, there’s nothing normal about them.
“Tony,” he chirped. Then looked up as the door slammed shut, Tony visibly wince—Wade smiled turned upside down. Tension, the theme in this town. Though he was relieved to see Loki coming from the back, brow raised at the two having a staring contest.
"Another thing I probably shouldn't ask on my first day," she said. "But I can go home now, right?" Tony nodded in the affirmative. Conroy then began to gather all her things and stuff them into her laptop case. "Good, because I really don't want to find out what happens in my neighborhood after dark." Tony didn't want to find out either, so he let the conversation die there. Conroy eventually got all her things together and headed out the door. "See you tomorrow," she called over her shoulder as she left.
Stark nodded and Fury turned to go get Dr. Smith. Carol took that as an opportunity to head to the kitchen to get that snack. It took her a few minutes to search through the cabinets, but eventually, she found a bag of pretzels that still looked fresh. She also grabbed a bottle of bright-green Gatorade that she found in the fridge. It wasn't for her, though. Although Stark probably couldn't handle solid food now, he was still dehydrated an in need of electrolytes. Gatorade was the best thing on Earth for that.
For hours Knežević waited for Audrey and Stephanie to come home. In that time, he broke into Lorraine's house by throwing a rock through a window, made himself a mac and cheese TV dinner without any of it turning to stone (though, there were some close calls), and breaking the remote by using his whole hand to pick it up accidentally. As annoyed as he was, he tried to make himself accept that this was something he had to get used to. He didn't know how this happened (but he'd put a wager on the explosion having something to do with it) so he no way to fix it. This was life now. He had to get used to it.
"There isn't any, Tony," Steve said. "I poured it all out yesterday while you were asleep." He didn't flinch at Tony's hard glare.
"Even so, I'd like to do a blood test just to be sure," Rawls said. "I'm also going to order a full platelet count and tests for the most common autoimmune disorders; lupus, pernicious anemia, scleroderma… I really wouldn't worry about the HIV test, though. If you came back clean a month ago and you haven't been engaging in risky behavior since then, you're probably going to come back clean again. Do you have any questions?"
"No," Clint assured. "I wish I had, though. I couldn't see what you guys looked like when you walked into the room."
"I don't understand," she said. "Why would he throw you out over not finding a joke funny? That has to be the most illogical thing I've ever heard."

"And lit up," Steve added. "I really wish I had something to draw this with." Tony raised his eyebrows.
"I don't know what this meeting is for," she said. "But I would like to propose a ban on the use of the words 'I'm fine' when the person is clearly not." Tony frowned.
"When I worked for the Secret Service, I ran into S.H.I.E.L.D. a few times," Lara said. "They tended to be very helpful, especially those times when someone tried to kill the President with a freaky experimental ray gun."
"Hey, Steve." He looked up and saw Tony raising an eyebrow at him. "You okay?"
"Yeah," Tony said. A few seconds of silence followed before he finally said, "thank you, Peggy." Peggy smiled warmly.
, otherwise known as the Kingslayer Jellyfish."
Once the storm passed, Tony left, and Steve hadn't seen him since. He's texted him a few times, but for the most part, he's been trying to stay out of Tony's way. They had to halt construction on Stark Tower for a few days due to the Hurricane, so they were now a little bit behind schedule. He thought it best to just keep his distance for a few days so that way Tony could focus on what he needed to get done and he could maybe get his mind straightened out.
“You guys are pretty chill with,” he waved his hands around, “All this.” He started to shrug his jacket on.
Thor sighed, “Which one?” he crosses his arms. Thor had a glint to his eyes. It wasn’t anger; it was fondness. The one his dad held whenever Tony became mischievous as a kid. Tony felt a pang in his chest. Remembering his father. He swallowed more water. He felt Steve's thumb rubbing his side, soothing him.
Thor promised he will have a talk with Jared. They’ve told him it wasn’t a big deal, and they too found it funny. Once the headache settle. It’s not like they haven’t play pranks at the kid age and no one got hurt.
Rhodey helped him and patted his shoulder, “Believe us when we say that we are processing many things slowly.”
“Classy,” Tony teased and took a bite. It was delicious.
With Odin directions, Tony drove through the small town, making notes of the area.
Steve stood with his hands grasping his belt, a scowl across his face. Steve didn’t get the kid. The clear blatant defiance towards him—the frigid attitude towards him. He figured it was puberty—but puberty was different with them—he didn’t grow out of it, after tonight it looks like it had gotten worst.
Not all of them got a hang of it. Some made straining faces that had Frigga and him concern that an incident might occur.
As soon as Steve parked, he was out of that truck and moved quickly to Loki’s shop. Steve on his heel. That guy was no a slouch.
And the kiss—that was enough to understand.
Tony cleared his throat, “S-so, um—what are you?” he said as Steve pulled into the road, towards town.
“Aw! How cute,” Natasha smiled.
“Exactly, how do you know about Stark?” Steve spoke up. Staring, well glaring, ahead in the dark.
“Just let me off here,” Bucky pulled over. Steve stepped out and started removing his clothing. “Letting off steam?”
The high beams weren’t helping. And he felt a strong foreboding, something telling him to turn around and forget Nowhere Ville. Well, the town name was called
He stood by his front door, looking at the side table. His fingers skimmed the flowers he got for Tony. A mixture of red Calla Lilies, yellow Daffodils and lavender.
Tony was busying watching Steve cuddling up to the little ones that stayed. Not interested in the chase. They just enjoyed cuddling Steve. Tony couldn’t help but smile. It was cute.
“I can’t shift.” She stated once again. She looked around to make sure it’s just them. “I’m seven and my brothers are five and I’m the only one that can’t.” She looked like she would burst into tears.
So, what could have gotten Tony in this predicament?
What the hell was he doing?
Both men took notice of Steve. Their eyes had a gleam of something wicked. Steve stopped and nodded his head in greeting.
“Yea, I also got sick. I held out better, being half, my dad decided he couldn’t wait. He lost too much.” He flipped Tony hand over, both hands held him, Steve’s thumbs smoothing over his palm, down his wrist. Steve could feel Tony’s pulse quicken.
Steve coughed, “Uh—heard that your first public visit in Asgard was not comfortable.” Clearly Loki told Steve this. Tony nerves settled. Like before, Tony was used to public attention, but not the type that Asgard showed them. It’s not their fault, he knew. They just wasn’t used to
“Hey Tony,” Clint calls out. Holding a beer out to him. “Care to join us,” Tony stopped the scan, sending the details, notes to Pepper and moves down, grabbed the beer offer to him.
Loki sighed. Standing with arms crossed, a pointed look as he waited a response from the boys.
Tony gave him the most endearing smile. “Thanks. I love them.” He bit his lips and Steve found that he would love to bite those enticing lips.
He swears he’s hearing water. The closer he got, it’s roaring. Tony stopped as he made it to the edge. The edge of Asgard?
“Careful now, you might end up with warts” Tony turned to the smooth male voice as he shut and place liquid warts away from him.
Before he could say anything. A roar broke out. A bunch of kids ran out the tall grass screeching and laughing. Steve pulled Tony in, as the children ran past them, nearly missing them. His arms wrapped tightly around Tony’s waist.
“Some time ago. But they’ve sold it. A woman bought it. She stayed for a time, I’m assuming you are the new owner?”
“Is that right?” up close, the elder man gave Tony a once over. Well, you can’t blame someone for being cautious of strangers. “So, where are you headed?”
“You’re defenseless” Steve stated, as that explained everything. Tony gawk.
“Now my little ones, let’s start with a bit of our story.” She smiled and took a seat. “We all met Yggdrasil.”
“Fine. Found the town… let’s say
Clint swallowed his food, “Also, you should be less—” he paused searching for the right word “I can’t find the word. But you and that Steve guy are off. It’s just… the tension," he looked to Rhodes at that.
He stared down at Tony sleeping form. Clutching his pillow. All Steve could think of was
And he looked to a shelf that held some books and a few pictures. Family pictures. He looked behind to watch Steve busy with whatever he made. Oh, a guy that can cook. Big points for Rogers. Tony was a horrible cook.
Curious green eyes, a slow smile holding back a laugh. He was a few inches taller than Tony, with black shoulder length hair.
. And it left Steve with a knot at the pit of his stomach. That’s not something you want your mate to feel towards you—
And thinking of that, he frowns. Wade was a huge issue. He pushes Steve, challenging him for Tony. And yeah, he was immature—Tony had no clue what Wade was up to. And he sure as hell would not let the kid get in his way.
“It’s a date, not war!” Bucky called out.
Bucky made them breakfast. A nice greasy type breakfast for the hangovers. They would need it since there was an agenda placed for them. Tony took notice at Rhodey squinting at Bucky every so often.
?” Tony grumbled.
She had brown curls in a ponytail, and her cheeks were chubby. She was so enthusiastic earlier now she looked put-out.
She left just about everything to him. A few other things went to charity. Anthony Edward Stark was a genius, billionaire, and philanthropist. He didn’t need anything. Except her. Them.
“And two: nice move.”
Rhodey eyebrows shot up, his lips pressed together, holding a choke laugh. "Hold on," he raised his hand, "No, no. Now see we need to talk. What is going on, Tones?"
He gripped the steering wheel, then he let go; he didn’t want to break it again. Thor just fixed it. He took a deep breath and let it out. Taking the flowers, he got out the car and made his way to the house. Finding Clint and Rhodey waiting for him. He noticed the wooden bench, that was not there before. It looked like one of Wade’s work.
was doing with him.
Thank you for reading!
“So, Odin let someone in?”
He squeezed her hand. He didn’t have family left, not blood, he only has Pepper and Rhodey—few people he could call friend. All these last few weeks he was surrounded by boxes. Filled to the brim of memories. Sad, happy moments. What was he going to find at this place?
Tony stopped. Steve tilted his head, “Something wrong?”
“Loki and his sons,” he bit his lip, he didn’t want to pry, but he was curious. And Sam was a teacher, he the perfect person to ask.
“That’s one hell of a trick.”
“Well, we don’t have to worry about Steve.” Clint moved to enter the house.
He fell on top of his bed as he opened the envelope.
“Nothing. Just yes.”
“No, we just—” Jared spoke, but mull over his next choice words, “Not used to city folks” Wade finished for him, reaching a hand for a shake.
“Man, what is it with you two?” Rhodey questioned.
“Maybe it’s time to go,” Steve's gruff voice. He was kind to make it seem like he was giving Tony a choice. Tony blew out an air. “I feel you should have locked me up instead” Steve’s eyes turned on him and now Tony was caught in a stare down. Which got his heckle up. It was one thing to growl at him—but he would not get intimidated which he gave out his own impressive growl. Caught everyone off guard.
This—this was that explosive, lightning kiss that his Mother’s romance novels would describe.
The young man that chase after the cubs was helping them place their clothes on.
They’ve made their introduction earlier, when Clint let them in. Well, they came through the then broken side door.
“Okay, well that’s great. So, I’m looking for this place,” Tony pulled out his Stark phone and shown the address. The old man looked surprise at the hologram phone but smiled as he looked. More like squint his good eye.
They’ve bounced on the bed and Tony laughed against Steve’s mouth. He liked Steve eagerness. He pushed against Steve to let up. Steve pulled away, a little. His blue eyes held a bit worry. Tony just smiled, easing Steve tension. “I like where this is going,” he whispered against his lips, “But I have to say, I have not—well this is new territory for me.”
Tony glance over to Steve, he rose a brow at him. Steve just shrugged.
Wade came from the back and the gloom was back. Jared must have been at the back as he came right at the heel of his brother. “Twins?” Tony turned to Loki.
“I can’t,” she huffed. She looked at Tony shyly, she was okay around Steve, which is understandable. Steve was her kind; Tony was a stranger.
Loki chuckled, “Nonsense, my father seems to deem that you need help. And once he has that stuck in his head…well let’s humor him” Tony laughed. He could sense that Loki going to be fun.
After a few questions and some semantics, Tony was off the clock. He looked to his holograms, well not completely off the clock, he was going over some of the diagrams and other blueprints for the next project of SI. So, engross at this point, he didn’t know he was being watched.
“I guess one of us should be prepared,” he teased, as he shifted, and Steve’s cock brushed against his. Tony opened the bottle and poured some on them and his hand. Grasping them both together, Steve eyes turned predatory. And Tony felt those little aftershocks again. This only happened around Steve, it’s weird but he loved it.
“I will never trust another Odinson’s again.” Rhodey declared, “Well, except Thor but that is it.” he huffed.
"I don't snore." Tony snorted at the denial.
"…When it's been proven in the past that it can be done. Didn't some guy make his own version of your armor – technology you said yourself was twenty years away from being copied, let alone outmatched – and tried to kill you in Monaco a few months ago?" Tony clenched his fists under the table.
"Not without taking it out of the box," Bruce said. "And the CDC hasn't given us permission to irradiate the letter yet."
"Have you heard anything?" Tony shook his head.
To all my readers in the US, be advised that the FBI has issued warnings about protests being staged at various state capitols and federal buildings throughout the country. I don't care what your political affiliation is or your own personal opinion on the 2020 election, but please only go out if you absolutely HAVE to and if you do remain vigilant. I was extremely saddened to hear that five people died during the insurrection of the US Capitol back on January 6th, and I really don't want to hear about any more warrantless bloodshed. Please, everyone, just STAY HOME! That's what you're supposed to be doing anyway given the Coronavirus situation, so just think of this as more incentive to do so.
"I think I would just cut the wire." Steve laughed, looked at everyone else, then back at Tony.

"Good," Tony said. "Better than I expected. Steve's muscles relaxed and he gave Tony's back a rub.
"Colonel Rhodes is here already?" He blearily looked around, quickly finding that was not the case. "Who's she?" Carol took a few steps closer to Clint and held out a hand for him to shake.
Thank you for reading this fic. And thank you to those that comment and stuck to this fic. It's very encouraging!
“You gave them coffee,” he accused Rhodey.
Sam eyes twinkled and he gave a full-blown smile, “Ah right you met the boys, “he chuckled. “They are a handful.”
Rhodey raised his hand, “All right, as strange as tonight has been… what’s your plan for us? Because I for one would like to get my head check.”
Tony stood silent.
“Excuse me! Exactly how?” he felt his hand shaking, he couldn’t believe he was this angry. Tony let no one get under his skin. He was a suave ass himself, he was good at getting under people’s skin—he was
“Margaret
“So, know anything about this place?”
And here he was. On house arrest or should he call this unlawful imprisonment of an unknown mystical town. With an unknown, handsome blond with amazing blue eyes. One that once they touch gives him little aftershocks and he can’t help but let him invade his space.
Steve place wasn’t that big. He watched him go hang their jackets up and moved a short way to the kitchen. He saw a small table set up for two. A candle lit. Steve ears were completely red now.
“It’ll be up to your parents or they’ll let you decide. You have to wait until your bigger.” He advised.
Steve got to bite those lips, Tony gasped, and he plunged his tongue in. And Steve could smell Tony’s want.
“Boys, that was Loki on the phone.”
He glances over to Bucky, as he stares at the two but mostly at the man. Tony would think his eyes held, longing.
Tony’s secure in his sexuality. He only dated women, not because he had too, it was what he’s attracted to. And Steve was becoming something – he dared think – attracted to.
“Steven!” Thor was the first to move and embrace, unlike James, Steve did not mind Thor being in his personal space or his affections. He dropped his duffel bag to the ground as Thor bear hug him, he patted his back as he laughed.
When Tony growled at him. It was cute.
Years! Long years waiting for this. Always told what to expect. But not sure, now, what to do? It’s easier when it was one of his own—they would understand. An outsider… it was hard. He watched Thor’s own struggles when it came to Loki. His friend was a mess. Thor was never known for patience. He gave Loki years. In the end, with a little intervention, it paid off—he had a family, two sons.
“And I almost, kind of, promise not to put out on the first date.” Tony laughed out.
He bounced off the bed. If he was going to get some answers might as well get ready for the day. The old man said they had the run of the town, he grinned.
Tony made a friend out of all this at least. He began placing away the food he brought and few other necessities. He plugged the refrigerator in and brace himself as he opened. He let out a sigh of relief and found an envelope on the top rack with his name on it.
Sam saw Tony flash of confusion at that. “He was never born one of us. He was mortal, like you and your friends.”
*****
He gathered Tony in his arms; he grunted at him. And Steve brushed his lips against his forehead. It brought great joy for Steve to come home to someone.
“Not sure how much Loki said. But I bet he confirmed they are his and Thor.” Tony nodded.
Jazmin must have caught a trail of his thought, as she poked Steve bicep. Steve gave out a throaty laugh. “Honest, not even kidding, Bucky will tell you.”
“Shapeshifter.”
in his corporation.
“Guys really?!” The same young man from earlier had clothes clutched in his hands. He looked exhausted. “I definitely should have asked for more money,” he grumbled.
So, I just wanted to put out some things about this WIP I have going.
Here Tony was, in Steve’s home. Wondering how they got this far. Dating. He hasn’t been on a date for some time. Work kept him preoccupied, and he just hasn’t clicked with anyone either. Pepper said he was becoming picky at one point. She and Rhodey gave up in playing matchmaker.
It was at that; he felt an arm around his waist. And Steve was rubbing his eyes, “Tony,” he muttered as he leaned and kissed his temple. It melted his heart but looked down and saw that Steve was, well, still naked and turned to Bucky whose face was scrunched up.
He stepped to the passenger side and let Pepper in first. And soon he was behind the wheel and pulled off.
“So, no choice,” he flexed his fingers on the steering wheel, “I-it was hard, this whole thing…” he let a out a slow breath. “Now this…”
Steve settled by him, Tony turns and burst out laughing.
“He had… kids?” he frowned, “Is Thor?” he lifts a brow.
“Later. After this.” He pulls Tony along.
Steve ducked his head and nodded, “Yea. He found her. They did the whole courting.” That’s quite a term, Tony thought. “And they got married, and they had me.” Steve's eyes changed, a little sad and he spoke again. “She was sick. They thought it wasn’t a good idea for her to have kids. But she was stubborn and had me, she was strong for a while and then one day the illness took her.” Tony couldn’t stop himself; he reached a hand to hold Steve’s. Steve held on tight.
He didn’t realize that they were holding hands now. He felt an urge to press himself close to Steve. He pushed that urge down, so down it couldn’t see the light or until Tony was alone and could analyze that urge.
With a brow raised “I didn’t know you were into technology, Buck.”
“What was that? Oh, that’s not a good look” Rhodey gripped Tony tighter. Now who was going to have the panic attack.
Steve turned, “I never been this nervous.” Throw him into battle, toss him a mission and he would face it, not a twitch to his nerves. And here he was, looking at his best friend and not sure what to do at this point.
And pulled away, rubbing his nose against Tony’s, “I won’t be long.” He promised.
Attraction. Was putting it mild in what he wanted to do to Steve. God, where did that come from?
He took it and knew it was his Aunt Peggy handwriting. He opens it quickly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh,” he blinked, “Yea… same here. We’ll take it slow. No need to go all the way.” His hand at Tony thigh, soothing. Tony grabbed Steve collar and continued with their make-out session.
“So, the war.”
Natasha finally stop laughing to share an amused looked with Bucky.
So, can you guess the couple of unrequited love? Hahaha
Odin huffed out a laugh. “Anthony will be staying in Asgard for a time. He is staying at the old house, past the Wilson farm” Tony missed the look both men shared. “And since you and Thor live nearby… you be helpful in helping Anthony around.”
Rhodey and Clint disappeared on him. Natasha with them, probably. Thor—who knows.
Odin rose a brow and Sam just looked curious.
*****
Yea, without the old man help, Tony wouldn’t know where to go. He would not had found this house and thank god he was paying attention on how to get around.
“Okay, basic first. Name?” Steve tilt his head confused “You know my name,” Tony huffed “Just your first name. You know more about me, company included," that was true “Steve Rogers.”
“It hurt like hell.” He looked up at Tony, a smile on his face. “And now you’re huge,” they both laughed. Steve couldn’t hold back, as he brought Tony's palm to his lips.
“That was a history lesson?”
between us…"
*****
He had a pained face as the red-head held him by the ear.
“Oh, now I must know this goddess name.”
, touched Tony.
Steve smile was wide, “Thanks?”
Tony brain would short circuit soon. Or maybe not. He let out a short laugh.
“Nothing.”
It was the first time he ever saw his father cry as his mother passed away. “It was better that way. She would have suffered and die, badly. It wasn’t a risk that anyone wanted to take.” Even though, she suffered in the end.
But then again, Tony always had a knack in surprising everyone, including himself. So, he wouldn’t dwell too much on it. He wanted to enjoy this moment with Steve. He wanted Steve, and he also wanted Steve’s scent on him.
and Tony left it at that. The door was down the list of problems they had.
Steve was clearing his throat, but Tony knew he was holding a laugh in.
Tony moved quickly and motion to help Odin up the steps. Which Odin gladly took the offer. Tony imagine this place would look a bit beat up, but it seems it was well taken care of.
Tony blinked, he felt the shock wave down his spine and Steve drag him down the block. Confused—was he the only one feeling this? He heard a clear, loud whistle and turned to see his friends, Clint being the one who whistle—
Steve's face turned grim, “We need to talk.” Was it a question or a demand?
“Is that what you want to believe?”
The more he drove through the fog, it started to lift, thank god.
Tony genuinely smiled, “Nice to meet you. Please call me Tony.” He turned slightly to look at Odin “You have an interesting family.”
“Actually, that happened years ago.” His eyes roamed Bruce and poked the man, then turned to an amused Steve, a brow raised.
for you guys…” Steve smirked. “Stick with me pal and you’re not even going to know the definition of that word.” Tony sighed and Steve pull him in tighter.
"This woman," the officer said, pointing at Lara. "Claims to be the personal assistant of Tony Stark. Can you confirm that what she is saying is the truth?"
"Will do."
"Uh, thank you, Thor," Natasha said, not sure how else to respond.
"Tell them to hurry," Natasha said as she started rushing towards the door. "And to keep Subarian in one piece. We don't have a lot of time and he's got the answers we need."
"I know!" Tony looked shocked at his own outburst. He took a deep breath. "I'll eat," he assured. "I'll eat. Just don't worry." Steve put a hand on his shoulder.
"Of course, I'm sure," Coulson said. "We found him on the wreckage of
"Would you talk to Romanoff?" Lara shrugged.
"Oh thank God," she said as her posture loosened up. "I was really scared there for a second."
He knew it was wrong, that he was wrong, but at the same time, it didn't feel wrong. Boys were equally attractive to him as girls and if felt completely natural, like that was the way it was supposed to be. It scared him at first, but he'd learned to live with it. If nobody ever found out; if he never acted on it, he'd be fine.
"Let's not argue right now," he said. "Why don't we change into more casual attire, and when we come back, Captain Danvers can explain everything to us, alright?" Carol seemed to be placated by the idea, but Natasha had yet to lower her suspicious guard. "Natasha." At the prompting she finally relented.
"Palladium exposure," Tony said. "would that do it?"
"Don't say that," Rhodey said. "It's not
"No," he said. "A movie sounds like exactly what I need."
"Hilarious," Duran said dryly. "If that's all you got, I think I'll take my search over to ATF. I'm sure Agent Ness will be ten times easier to deal with than you."
"You sure about that?" Bruce asked. "This is a train station after all. There are probably more than a few charlatans around here ready to take advantage of weary travelers."
"I assume you mean 'has my ex tried to contact me?'" Bruce gave a reluctant nod. "It's okay to ask. He hasn't tried to contact me. It's still frustrating, though. I can't go home. I can't sleep, period."
"With Betty." Bruce almost wanted to cuff himself over the back of the head.
"Yippee," Lara said unenthusiastically.
"Sorry about that." She was whispering now. "I'm about to walk in the building and on the off-chance I get caught I don't want to make it worse on myself by having a camera in my hands."
, and Happy and Rhodey were scrolling through social media on their phones. Steve didn't think to bring a book with him, but he did have his phone. However, the only person he really wanted to text was Tony and he had a feeling that trying to do so would only be detrimental to him, so he refrained from even pulling out the device at all.
"So, you admit that you're not fine." Clint then realized how he clearly walked into that one.
"There's nothing to apologize for," Steve said.
"He was still very vague," she said. "That was probably on purpose. I have no idea who he was talking to or if they were talking about Stark."
"I got bored a lot in prison," Knežević said. "
"Yeah," Natasha confirmed. "I don't suppose you know where?" Clint sighed.
"Are you implying that you're a member of this group?" Freeman frowned.
Steve shoved that thought directly into the deepest, darkest pit of his mind. That was the last thing he needed to think about right now. There were more important things, like convincing this S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that there's nothing medically wrong with him so that way they won't have the opportunity to come up with some excuse to draw his blood.
"We could have talked him down further," she pointed out.
"I was in Louisiana visiting family," she admitted. "And you're damn lucky I was."
As far separated from the Red Room as she was, there was still a part of her brain that was wired against even feeling emotion at all. Emotion was compromising; it got in the way of becoming the perfect killing machine that they wanted, so it had to be eliminated. As a result, any time Natasha felt anything other than indifference, a little electric charge would be sent through her brain, telling her that "this is wrong." Most of the time, she could ignore it. However, with the circumstance and stress of the past few days, her brain was having a hard time doing so. It was even worse when she was forced to consider her actions with Maurita Sharpton and NHL.
"Right, right," Tony agreed. He took a deep breath, and then a step forward into Steve's arms, wrapping his arms around his waist. "This helps." Steve stifled a chuckle before wrapping one arm around Tony's waist and bringing the other one up, so he could run his fingers through Tony's hair.
Sitting back down in front of the mirror, Adoniram stared himself down. He then turned his gaze to the yellow legal pad in front of him. He spent all night working on this speech, with a little insight from Marx. Although this would be the standard run-through of the procedure, he liked changing up the foreword speech every time. It kept things from getting too dull. He read through the address one last time before he got up and proceeded to the backstage area.
"Couldn't Stark pay for your ticket?" Natasha asked.
"Well, the box is addressed to me specifically," Tony said. "So, no, probably not."
"Oh, hello, Miss Potts," he said. "I was just coming to get an update on the situation."
"I can call Happy and see if he's willing to give you a ride," Pepper offered.
"Can you stand?" Steve had to ask.
Steve watched as the man pointed at the elevator behind him.
"No," she said slowly. "You started screaming at me first."
"I would draw you something right here, right now," Steve said. "But I'd need a pencil and paper first." Tony bit his lip as he scanned the area of the cabin.
"Clearly," Lara said sarcastically.
"What the hell?" he gasped out, more in shock than in actual pain. "How did you…?"
"Oh yeah," Tony said. "I made a few calls, got them to stay open a little late for us. It's closed to the public right now, though, so there's no chance of getting spotted and recognized by a huge crowd."
The biggest issue that Steve had with S.H.I.E.L.D., though, was that for the longest time they were "closely" monitoring him and would only let him leave the facility when accompanied by an agent. (They probably enforced that rule for fear that he would get "kidnapped" by Tony again.) The stated reason why they did this was that they were afraid of it getting out to the public that Captain America had miraculously brought back from the dead. Once it did, Steve wouldn't have very much privacy, or at least that's what they kept stressing to him. Steve had a very good feeling that it was more because S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't want attention being put on them or have too many questions asked about how this had transpired.
"Die." Carol shook her head.
"Have you ever had a headache so bad that you threw up from it before?" Tony shook his head.
"Yeah," Tony admitted.
Stark nodded before knocking the shot back. He picked up the bottle of apple juice to refill it, only to find it was down to the dregs.
Rubbing her eyes, Lara moved to sit on the other side of the hallway, determined to wait them out. Taking her phone out of her robe pocket, she hit the home button to check the time. She groaned when she saw that it was almost one AM. That meant they'd been going at it for almost four hours and that she had five hours until she had to start getting ready for work. Again, she wondered whatever happened to basic human decency and erectile dysfunction.
"Has she had any objections to your presence since you've been on the team?" Tony's face fell.
Steve could already feel a few scrapes burning against his skin. He could feel blood sliding down his cheek and maybe on his right arm, too. However, that didn't stop him from trying to grab ahold of Rebecca's arm when she started to move like she was going to get up and bolt again. In response, Rebecca pulled his hand off her and bit it. When Steve screamed, Rebecca let go and ran back inside the building. Bucky wasn't even back on his feet yet when he went over to make sure Steve was okay.
"I know," Laura said. "But I'm still going to worry, especially with how impulsive you've been lately."
They eventually came to a stop in front of a pair of double doors labeled
"Of course not," he dismissed. "This is all old hat to me. You?"
"My son's," Clint interjected, holding up Lucky. Tony's frown deepened.
"I haven't thrown up since early yesterday morning," he said. "So that has to be an improvement."
"Oh," he said. "How so?"
"You don't have to stay," Tony said. "You can go home."
"You know that I do," she said. Clint looked down and tried to regain control of his breathing. It was still much too heavy for his liking.
"I already told you over the phone." He was hoping he could skip the part where he had to grovel about what was wrong with him and just get to the part where she told him what he could do to fix it, but apparently Dr. Cranston wasn't going to play it that way.
"…And I need to find whoever was responsible for this
"Oh, Susanna," Lara groaned. "As much as I love you, you're starting to prove Tony right."
"Finished with what?" he asked.
Dialing the number, Steve tried to swallow down his anxiety. Why was he doing this? Why was he so nervous? What was he going to say to Tony when he picked up the phone? All these questions and more were buzzing through Steve's mind at such a fast pace, he didn't even hear the phone ringing as the call connected and almost missed the sound of the phone clicking as Tony picked up on the other end.
"You don't need to make up for anything," he said softly. Tony shushed him.
"Are you kidding?" Steve questioned. "After hearing what Tony went through, it just scares me more."
"Steve," he said. "Are you mad at me?"
"Alright…" Knežević slurred out. "So this is shot number… Shit, I forgot. What number are we on?"
"Thanks," Lara said.
"Hey kids," Clint said. "How are you doing?"
"Well, I'm sure they'll be getting back to you soon enough," he said. "And besides, the media is going to want a statement in time for the early morning news broadcasts."
"Oh, and you are?"
Getting up off the ground, Knežević know knew what he needed to do. He needed to somehow get access to the necessary chemical elements to create this new compound, produce it, and make millions selling his creation. This time, he was certain that it would all work out in his favor.
For whatever reason, though, Dr. Wayne chose not to disclose this information to Barton. Not once did Tony hear him mention either disease. That was a problem because Barton didn't know everything about his health that he could. That had to be a violation of some law. After all, no one wanted a repeat of the Tuskegee Project. Before Tony could even call Wayne out on this, he and the other doctors left the room, which put Tony in this bad position.
"Don't." Steve stopped in his tracks and looked at Tony. He felt tears pricking at his eyes as he took in the surprised look on Steve's face. "Don't."
"Unbelievable," he remarked as he jotted something down on the page. Tony undoubtably knew it was the word "nightmares." With that knowledge in mind, he swallowed down his trepidation and kept the mood light.
"Give me my children back now." His demands fell on deaf ears as the social worker unflinchingly stood her ground.
"Okay," he said. "Just don't push yourself too hard." Tony scoffed.
"Alright, I'll gather everyone to the bridge," she said. "Try to come up with a plan of attack."
Tony."
With Salinas gone, Tony squeezed his eyes shut and fell back against the couch. He didn't allow himself to relax completely, though. He still didn't want to fall asleep. God only knew what Salinas' intentions were.
Although Tony hadn't thrown up yet, his headache still hadn't subsided. He was a lot paler than he had been earlier and Steve had noted as they were leaving that his hands were trembling something fierce. Withdrawal symptoms were setting in. Tony could feel it through his entire body. However, he was determined to power through it. Just if he could keep telling himself that, he'd be able to do it.
"You weren't even in the room when I wrote the paper," Betty pointed out.
"I'm here." For a moment, a soft smile crossed Tony's lips.
"Is it like a fetish?"
"Uh, yeah," Steve said. "I think it is. Again, I'm your
Shortly after the breathing tube was inserted down his throat, Clint began to find it difficult to keep his eyes open. They just kept drifting closed and it got harder and harder to force them to open again. It was like tiny weights had been hooked into his eyelids. Eventually, he just gave up the fight and let his eyes stay closed. Nothing interesting was happening anyway.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He's a boy dog," Clint pointed out.
Lying on the dirty sidewalk and crying her eyes out, Oswin mentally berated herself for not hearing that Homeland Security Agent out. If she just stayed calm and complied with the woman, then maybe she would have gotten to Nina a second sooner and Knežević wouldn't have gotten to her. If only…
"I think that's it for now," Pepper said. "I should probably be letting you go."
"Well, check again," Tony insisted. "You had to have missed something because I just don't feel right. Also, where's Steve? Are you still getting him or do I have to throw a tantrum?"
At that point, Bergeron seemingly gave up. He said nothing as he got up from his chair and exited the interrogation room. A few seconds later, the door to the observation room opened and Bergeron walked in. Duran made no attempt to hide the triumphant smirk that was appearing on her face.
"You sure?" Tony said. "Because I can turn it off if you want."
"I can't say why," Tony said. "I just can't." Slowly, the realization began to dawn on Peggy's face.
That was all he needed to hear. Pulling the underwear down with one quick motion, Steve was left exposed to the air.
"Hey, lovebirds!" she shouted. "Some of us have to work in the morning! Could you keep it down?!"
"No," Steve said. "Something is very wrong. It's been wrong since the Chitauri attack and you won't tell me what it is."
"I'd raise my expectations of people if I were you," Natasha said as she stood up. "You'll be surprised. They can make the right choices sometimes."
"No need to apologize," she said. "So, what is it that you wanted to find? Some sort of chemical plant?"
"Hey," he said. "No, no, no. Don't try to butter me up. You know what you did was bad. Very, very bad."
"Hey." Steve couldn't help but allow a small smile to come over his face as well. "We're here. You've got to get up."
The building seemed to be in decent shape, but Carol could have sworn she saw she saw the faded outline of the word "condemned" scrawled across one of the side-doors. Someone had tried to cover it up by painting over it, but there was no erasing what was already there. It was fitting.
"Wait, you mean now?" he asked.
"I have a mean right hook," Lara explained. "That made up for it. Besides, you're distracting from the point again, so I'm just going to come right out and say it. You're not taking care of yourself."
"I have to agree with Mr. Schaffer," the man to the right of Schaffer – Marvin Weinstein – said. "After all, who knows who this mysterious thief was and where they got the access codes. For all we know, it could have been an employee."
There were other people, though, that he was unsure he could extend the same benefit of the doubt to. Carol was only one of them. She had good company in Fury and Commander Hill. After all, they couldn't have known about this. Looking back on how they had acted when they came to drop off Tony, it clearly a bit suspicious. They gave nothing but vague answers and hadn't truly explained what had happened and how Carol found Tony. At the time, Steve was just so relieved that Tony had been brought back to him relatively safe, but now he was certainly questioning it a lot more.
"I wasn't going to do anything rash." Tony huffed.
"Absolutely not," he firmly denied. "I didn't even know Stark was planning something like that! I thought he was actually drunk!"
"Alright, listen up," he said. "Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment." He turned to Clint and pointed at a nearby building. "Barton, I want you on that roof. Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays." He then turned to Tony. "Tony, you've got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash."
"They said Captain Rogers went down with the ship, didn't they?" Hill noticed the medical team preparing to wheel a gurney down the ramp.
Even though they were arguing, Steve wasn't worried about either of them becoming violent. Lara was clearly furious, but she did keep her hands in plain sight even took steps to appear less threatening. Tony, meanwhile, was too drunk to walk a straight line, never mind start throwing hands. Steve felt like they wouldn't hurt each other, so he didn't rush to approach them. A slow and calm approach was probably the best to diffuse the situation.
The door swung open to reveal Bruce standing there, looking unimpressed.
"No," was Peppers firm response.
Everyone looked at her in stunned surprise; a billion questions easily popping into their heads. Carol caught on and held out a hand placatingly.
After being taken to the Hub, Bruce was led down to a lab and he immediately set to work. Betty wasn't there yet, but he knew it was a long way to New York from Virginia, so it was safe to assume she was still on her way. That was fine. It gave him time to think and get some work done.
"Thank you, tooth fairy!" he exclaimed, much to Clint and Laura's amusement.
Working as quick as she could, Duran began flipping through the files that Mrs. See had stored away in her cabinet. She was looking for one name and felt relief wash over her when she saw that the files were impeccably organized alphabetically. That made finding things so much easier, especially given that she didn't have much time. S.H.I.E.L.D. was bound to show up there eventually and if she stuck around long enough to bump into them, then her cover was blown.
Clint watched as Director Fury entered the room and began to discuss the issue of the cube with the lead scientist, Dr. Erik Selvig. He was able to make out most of the conversation through reading lips. The most he knew about the cube was that it was a potential energy source and it was supposedly a gateway to space. Not that he ever witnessed any proof of that himself, other than maybe this energy spike. However, that was all he knew. The rest was classified well beyond his clearance. He'd even be surprised if the scientists even truly knew what they were working on, the only person who truly knew being Director Fury. From the conversation, though, all he learned was what he already knew, which was next to nothing. Eventually, Selvig pointed back at Clint's perch and he made eye-contact with Fury. Knowingly, Clint vacated his position by sliding down a nearby rope and joined Fury out on the lab floor.
“Oh! I’m a busy woman Tony. So, you have to go this one on your own.”
And when Tony thinks about that… he never was a person who like strangers to invade his space. For god’s sake Pepper had to take things that people tries to hand to him.
Tony smiled and slid his sunglasses down, “I’m willing to answer whatever on your mind but please no pictures.” He earned some smiles.
These were his own inventions. Helped Tony in many things. Mainly recording info and picking up things. He gave them a tap as he scans the field, walking through tall grass.
Big thank you to Fra98ffri ( for a moment I thought I lost them) for being patient and betaing this. I know I need the help. And so appreciated!
“I doubt that, Rogers.” He patted his chest.
“Children!” Frigga could get their attention instantly. Who wouldn’t want to bask in this woman presence? She glowed.
“Usually we wipe your memories” Natasha finished.
“Come on,” Steve tug him, “History lesson.”
Tony was led into town again. He stood in a shop. Wasn’t exactly sure what they were selling. Bottles filled with dried leaves and powder, herbs? And other nifty trinkets.
And Steve refused to let go.
Good thing, since the topic of the conversation came into the kitchen. And so, did the tension. And Bucky looked as he was enjoying it. “Your door is fixed,” he Bucky announced.
The board could not wait for that process to finish, though. They wanted answers ASAP. Tony could not blame them. Well, at least partially. He was not known to be the most patient person when he wanted answers. He did hack into S.H.I.E.L.D. after they would not tell him what they wanted with the Tesseract, after all. However, instead of having the ingenuity of finding the answers themselves, the board members would rather pester Tony about it for all eternity, which was just a joy.
Freeman straightened up, nodded, and started to make his way down the hall. Adoniram slowly backed away from the door and shut it, careful to twist the lock before backing away from the door. He turned around and looked Salinas dead in the eye.
"Listen, none of you can sit this one out," he said. "I'm telling you as your public relations agent; it will do nothing but damage your reputations if you don't attend the State of the Union. I don't care if you're sick. I don't care if you're hurt. I don't care if you're
"The thing that gets me is that I didn't get to say goodbye," Steve said. "All that time and I couldn't say goodbye. She wasn't the only one, either. There were a lot of people that I didn't get to say goodbye to."
"Watering my plants."
"You'd think," Tony said. "But it doesn't always work out that way, especially after a biological attack."
"After the Everhart interview," he said. "A couple of the others, the Q&A session… It didn't get bad until the gala, though."
"As optimistic as I'd like to be," Tony said. "It's still probably best for her to stay far away from the city until she at least has the wheels in motion to get legal protection from him."
"The person," Subarian said. "How healthy they are, how they respond to treatment, whether or not they develop other infections…"
"Not the point," Jessica said. "Look, I need help. Can you help me?" Carol sighed.
The thing was, Loki
Her stomach jerked and for a moment, Lara could taste bile at the very back of her mouth. She squeezed her eyes shut and swallowed as fast and as hard as she could. That probably wasn't good for her stomach, but she didn't care. It stalled her upchucking for another forty-five seconds at least. Again, the officer looked concerned.
"And how much is some?" Tony paused for a moment to think about it.
Happy Father's Day to any potential Fathers out there, and if you're not a father, just think of it this way: Only five more months until Not a Father's Day rolls around!
"How can you be so sure?" Tony asked.
"Like, if I'm in the middle of pulling people out of a burning building, I'm going to finish getting everyone to safety before I come running to help."
"What a terrible fate," Clint said. "Trapped here, forced to be bored, only interacting with other idiots who poisoned themselves."
"Yeah," Audrey said. "An accidental explosion you caused!"
Surprise of all surprised, Tony found something worse than being treated at the hospital; waiting in the hospital waiting room. It was all the normal horribleness of being in the hospital with the added benefit of not actually being sick. Also, as disturbing were the hard-plastic chairs and outdated issues of
"Hi," Carol greeted, forcing a pleasant smile to appear on her face. "My name is Catherine Donovan. I'm a reporter for
"Uh, did you need this back?" Tony turned to see Rhodey holding up the packet he'd forgotten about.
"Excuse me, who gave you permission to be up here?" Lara didn't even look up from her plate.
"Thank you, Bruce," Steve said.
"No," he said in the tiniest voice possible, but he knew Steve heard him. He felt a hand come down on his shoulder.
"No, no, no," Tony said as he stepped behind the bar. "Threatening. No drink? Are you sure? I'm having one." He knew that probably wasn't a wise idea, but he needed something to take the edge off all the emotions swirling through him. Otherwise, he might have another hysterical break and he honestly didn't think he'd be able to pull himself together as quickly as he did last time. Meanwhile, Loki let out a seemingly agitated breath and moved to look out the glass wall beside him.
"I only gave him a small amount," the doctor explained. "Just enough to throw him into a dreamless sleep for a few hours. That is, if he stops fighting it." Steve nodded in understanding.
"Oh yeah," Bruce remarked with a sour look on his face. "Something tells me this isn't going to be anything like
"Alright," the man said with a broad but nonetheless genuine-seeming smile on his face. "Glad to see that everyone could make it. I understand not all of you have too much experience dealing with the public and the media, so we'll try to make it as simple and understandable as possible." The assembled group nodded and made noises of an agreement to that. "Now, before we get started, is there anything any of you think I should be aware of?"
"I'm fine," Stark said firmly. "What would you know about hard times?"
"Wow," Freeman said. "I, uh, this is amazing! Thank you so much, Brother!" He stepped forward and reached out his hand, which Adoniram took and gave a quick shake.
"What?" Tony narrowly dodged the blow and grabbed ahold of Lara's arm to keep her from attacking him again. "Non non! Je ne suis pas ta maman! Réveillez-vous!" With that, Lara's eyes snapped open and darted around the room in clear confusion.
to. Just get ready, okay?" Steve pressed a kiss to Tony's forehead and Tony grumbled a bit, still reluctant to leave his boyfriend. He forced himself to turn and walk out of the kitchen, though, and on his way out, he noticed that Lara had left her half-eaten plate of toast on the table.
That's what he was doing when he touched the shard. He had Marx show him all the information that was archived on different poisons and diseases. Most of it was alien, however there were some information on Terran poisons. Apparently, most humanoid creatures were vulnerable to nerve agents such as Sarin and VX. They had different names depending on what part of the galaxy you were in, but they still had the same composition and were just as deadly. The only way a person could be exposed to the gasses and still survive without permanent damage was if the person was enhanced and they were only exposed for a short amount of time, which Adoniram had found interesting.
he could hear a familiar, comforting voice say in the back of his mind.
"Tony!" He heard it again. It wasn't his imagination this time, especially considering how annoyed the voice sounded. He decided it would probably be best not to acknowledge them. They weren't going to be so kind, though.
"A month ago," Tony said. "I came back clean and I haven't slept with anyone or played with dirty needles since then." Thinking back, the last person Tony could remember sleeping with was Christine Everheart the night before he left for Afghanistan. Ever since then, his sex life's been dead in the water. It made him a little sad to realize he hadn't gotten laid in so long, but he had other things going on, like stopping insane megalomaniacs from killing hundreds upon thousands of innocent people and dying. He seemed to be doing the latter of the two a lot lately.
"Alright," Oswin said. "I'll be exiting at the service door near the northwest corner of the building. It's the closest exit to where I am. What should I be looking for specifically?"
"I think someone tampered with the report that I made on Stark," she said. "I just need to see it for myself." She flipped open the file and began to search through the numerous forms and information sheets S.H.I.E.L.D. had on the billionaire-turned-superhero.
"This is small to you?" The astonishment in Lara's voice made it clear she wouldn't have been able to hold back that comment, even if she tried. In all honesty, yes, the room was small to Steve and it was getting smaller by the second. He might have started having trouble to breathe if Lara hadn't recovered from the shock when she did. "Okay, okay. We know he's not in here, so we'll keep looking through the rest of the suite. We'll do the kitchen first, okay?"

"…When you were cast out, defeated?" Instantly Loki was filled with murderous rage.
"It's how people around here have been referring to the alien invasion," Pepper explained. "Outside of here they just call it 'New York' or 'the Battle of New York.' In the city, though, they call it 'the Incident.'" To Tony's surprise, he saw Steve's face pale a tiny bit as soon as Pepper said the words "alien invasion" and it made him feel reassured and awful at the same time.
As soon as he pushed open the door to the foyer, he could hear loud, lively chatter coming from the kitchen. Taking that as an indicator of where to go, Tony followed the commotion to where the other Avengers – along with Rhodey and Carol – were seated in the dining area. Before he could fully take stock of the situation, Steve stood up, walked around the table, and rushed to press a kiss right to his lips. Tony responded back enthusiastically, smiling all the way.
"What do you mean?" Hurt was creeping up in his voice. "I'm here to rescue you; both of you!"
"You blew up my door!" he said.
"Mist?" Adoniram scoffed.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Is he angry with me?" he asked.
"Shouldn't I be the one saying that?" he asked.
"No, no," Steve said. "You don't want to know." The look he gave Lara pleaded with her not to speak. Getting the message, she nodded and turned her attention back to her laptop screen. Barton still appeared to be confused, but a few hand gestures from Romanoff seemed to fix that. He pulled the puppy in his arms closer to his chest and gave Lara a sympathetic look.
Every time the police came to remove the Church members from the property, the members would claim religious discrimination and harassment. They'd usually have to be carried out while screaming about how the NYPD was fascist pigs that were preventing them from freely practicing their religion and about how the United States was a "fascist paradise" trying to suppress all its people. Having spent a portion of her childhood in Europe, Lara couldn't help but laugh at the notion. Obviously, these people had no idea what true fascism was and was ignoring the fact that there was currently a Democrat in office.
"You sure?" Pepper had one eyebrow raised, clearly not buying it.
"Everhart didn't," Tony pointed out.
Anyways, if you enjoyed this chapter, be sure to review and comment!
"Nice to meet you, ma'am." Steve was able to keep his face cool and composed but he felt his hand tremble a bit as he shook Pepper's. If she noticed it, she didn't say anything.
"You're not allowed to leave?" Tony questioned.
"He can move," Carol answered. "He can even walk. You have to support him and be mindful of his toes." Bruce turned to Steve.
"Right," the man said. "Well, Oswin, what would you say if I told you that I was about to make you an offer you couldn't refuse?"
"Should we tell her?" Steve asked.
"Really?" Lara raised an eyebrow. "Because the police told me they hadn't gotten any calls from Tony's address before I called." Pepper's eyes went wide. "That's not a good thing," she concluded.
"How do you know this?" Tony asked. "Didn't you almost date him?"
"So, taking him back to the tower isn't an option," Bruce said. "Where does that leave Tony? He needs help as soon as possible, and he's not going to be able to get it until he gets home."
"Regardless," the doctor said. "All our tests came back normal and he keeps insisting we do more. Since he's been asking for you, I've been wondering if you'd be able to convince him to go back to his room and get some sleep." Steve nodded.
"Yes," he said. "Why?" Romanoff put on her best innocent act.
"I still get to savor my victory, though," Natasha said. "And that does."
"Okay," Tony reluctantly agreed. Steve couldn't help but give him another worried glance as he let go of his hand and started baking away. It looked like Tony was trying with all his might not to fall asleep.
Bruce had just reached his room when he heard his phone chime, indicating that he had a text message. He pulled the device from his pocket and tapped the screen to see what it said.
"No," Natasha said. "I just broke the lock. The rest of the door is fine."
"Well, I have nothing for you," Pepper said. "So, if you don't mind…" She stopped abruptly when her phone started ringing. Taking the device off her belt clip and glancing at the screen, her eyes went wide. "I need to take this." Within seconds she was tapping the screen and pulling the phone closer to her ear. Meanwhile, Morse moved so that she was standing more directly in Freeman's way, effectively blocking him from the room.
"Good," she said with a small smile.
"What the hell?" he shouted. "What are you thinking, making that idiot a Decibel? Do you know what kind of damage he's done to us; to the Church?"
"He might not," she said. "But the least we can do is ask." Steve nodded in agreement.
Admittedly, not going right back to New York was probably a terrible idea. Already Tony's phone was ringing off the hook and he wouldn't be surprised if agents were waiting for them at the airport. After all, they didn't put that tracker bracelet on Steve for nothing. However, Steve didn't want to go, and Tony didn't want him to leave. Tony also wanted to crawl into his bed and not climb out until the beginning of the next century when they finally had a cure for whatever was ailing him, so to have both, he had to take Steve with him.
"As were the apple cider vinegar and the grapefruit seed extract," JARVIS pointed out. "Are you sure you don't need to see a medical professional?"
Carol nodded and put her arm around Jessica, helping her stand. As she led her up the stairs to one of the bedrooms Carol couldn't help but notice that Jess kept trying to take the weight off of her, probably either erroneously thinking she was fine and trying to stand on her own, or just plain didn't want to be a burden. Carol rolled her eyes.
"Dad, Dad!" Cooper said. "I lost my bottom tooth!" Cooper pulled down his bottom lip to show him and Clint played up his astonishment.
"I know I am." Natasha let out a scoffing laugh. "So, are you going to tell me what's wrong with you?"
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said. "I know the drill." The nurse nodded and left the room. Both Lara and Rhodey got up from their seats.
That was good. Bruce's office was on the second floor along with all the Avengers' quarters, and she was going to be heading up there anyways to use Natasha's hair dryer, so she wouldn't be going out of her way. That still didn't get rid of the weird feeling in her gut, though.
Bruce knew that the trick to getting out of a maze was to follow the right wall, but this just leads him in a circle. He tried to do the same with the left, but again just went in a giant circle. The only hope he had was the fact that there still appeared to be offices sprinkled about every so often. Bruce figured that the only way he was going to get back to the right place was by asking someone for directions.
Clint was stable for the most part, however, his blood pressure was dropping. He wasn't quite in the danger zone yet, but he would be if the doctors didn't get it under control soon. Hill had relayed the information that Subarian had given them and apparently the doctor had sounded more hopeful about Clint's prognosis than Subarian had been. Steve hoped he was right about that and wasn't just futilely keeping their hopes up.
"How did you know?"
Cat: *taps my shoulder*
"Right," Oswin said. "Now, how do I get in?"
She tried seeing the situation from his perspective. Steve had a lot of reasons to be scared, the obvious ones being obvious. The threat of his boyfriend dying a slow and painful death of an unknown disease was the furthest thing from pleasant, but there were other factors to consider.
"Well, then you better get ready before I butcher some more translations,
"Why am I back?" he questioned. "How'd you get him out?"
"That's the best deal I'm going to get, isn't it?" he asked.
"The security office has asked me to notify you all that the food has been cleared from any tampering and is ready to be picked up." Tony held a hand up in the air.
"Oh, go screw yourself, you little bitch! I hope the cops catch you, you dumb snake!" He shouted more verbal abuse at her until she was completely out of earshot and sight. She didn't care. She's been called worse. She just wanted to find a nice comfortable alley to rest in and sleep until the next century.
"I don't think I can." Her voice was broken, and a tear escaped one of her eyes. Pepper frowned and moved across the room to comfort her. Now that he was out from under Pepper's watchful eye, Tony took the chance to escape.
"Good," Tony said. "Because I don't think my heart could take it." If Steve had the energy, he'd give Tony a confused look, but he was too tired and too comfortable to move. "Just ask yourself this, what do you want from a relationship with me? If you can figure that out, we can use that to figure out what label we can put to this." Steve smiled against Tony's forehead.
"Yeah, but his inability to accept my forgiveness – hell, to even forgive himself – is concerning," Steve said. "He acts like I wasn't even there, that I'll still think less of him somehow."
"Public safety…" Tony held up a hand to cut Hill off. At this point, the situation had caught Fury's attention and he had started making his way over.
"Why, yes," JARVIS said. "I informed him of thusly." Lara gasped in mock shock.
Making his way up to the apartment, Steve could hear Bucky and Rebecca shouting at each other. They quieted down, though, when Mrs. Barnes' voice bellowed from the kitchen.
When she stepped out of the bathroom, she saw that Fury had joined Hill. Carol felt her stomach clench.

"By drinking so much that you blackout and wake up days later in a hotel room in Atlantic City married to a stranger." Bruce's eyes went wide, and his brows shot up to his hairline. He looked for any sign or indication that Lara was kidding. She gave none.
To escape, Clint tossed his knife in the air and used the distraction to try and punch Natasha again. She didn't fall for it and kept a tight hold on his arm. Clint quickly caught the knife in his free hand and charged forward, once again attempting to shake Natasha off. No matter what, Natasha wouldn't let go. Clint eventually managed to pin Natasha against the railing again. Both were straining to overpower the other. Clint had his knife poised to dive into Natasha's neck. She closed her eyes as she tried to force his hand away. Seeing that wasn't going to work out for her, she saw that the skin of his forearm was exposed, so she bit down on it, hard.
"What about Lilly?" Lila asked.
"You better be worth it, Stark."
"Not that far," she said. "Like Cabe said, she pulled him offstage before he could do any serious damage."
"He's the one who works for Stark Industries, Brother." Now he could recall. Duane Freeman. He was one of the most significant sources of income for the church. Everything he made went into the collective community pool, as did every other member of the churches. However, he made the most out of all of them. Technically, Salinas made more, but he was only required to add what he made from farming and his earnings as a Congressman. Any other ventures he had, he could keep the profits from to himself, leaving Freeman as their big earner. However, his money wasn't the reason Adoniram had taken an interest in him as of late. No, he was more interested in Freeman's connections to Stark Industries and – more importantly – the Avengers.
It was silent in the containment room as Steve stepped inside. Tony wasn't hard to miss. He was standing on the edge of one of the ramps that previously led to the containment module before Loki sent it plummeting back towards Earth with Thor inside. Steve didn't even try to bother going over to him or trying to talk to him. Instead, he just went and stood on the edge of one of the other ramps and just waited. Waited for Tony to say something, to make the first move. It never happened, so Steve finally gave in and said something.
"Worst case scenario bad." Pepper's eyes went wide, and her mouth dropped open. Tony stepped around her and went to get into position to go onstage. Pepper followed close behind.
This is actually also addressing a problem I had with Age of Ultron as Clint's family seemingly came out of nowhere. I mean, they hinted at Clint having a significant other early on in the film, but that was just one line and it didn't really well establish the reveal. Also, I found it a little disconcerting given that Clint was brainwashed in the Avengers. Wouldn't the people in the know about Clint's family be concerned for their safety? I guess that was poor planning on Thanos's part. So yes, Laura and the kids exist and are safe! That's all you need to know!
"Yes," Natasha said. "And judging from the looks of this report, I can clearly tell that it's not the one I submitted to Director Fury."
The Chief led them down a corridor to a viewing room. There, on the other side of the one-way mirror, sat a woman in her mid-fifties with graying reddish-blonde hair. She looked tired and her hands were cuffed behind her back, but she still held herself with perfect posture and composure. It was almost a little too perfect. As the Chief explained how no one could get her to talk, Hill side-eyed Natasha.
"Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump," Tony explained. I'm going to have to get in there and push."
"Hello," Bruce said. "My name is Dr. Bruce Banner. I'm also the Hulk." He said that last part warily as if worried about the crowd's reaction. Luckily, this crowd had left the pitchforks and torches at home. After all, it would be hard to clap with those things occupying your hands. Bruce's eyebrows raised in surprise at the generally positive reaction and shyly he raised his hand and gave a little wave to the crowd. "Um, a fact about myself…" Bruce's eyes scanned the crowd. Tony noticed that they fell on the fifth row, left-hand side. "One time in college I handed in a term paper that was written backward and in Latin, and still somehow managed to get an 'A' on it." The crowd – and the one person Bruce was looking at in particular – cracked up at that. It only got worse when Bruce added: "it gets more puzzling when you realize that this was before the internet and the professor in question didn't understand Latin." Once the laughter died down, Joe the presenter spoke up again.
Rhodey started first, “Yes, one, Tony has a curfew, must be home by midnight.” Steve wasn’t sure if Rhodey was kidding.

Steve noticed and moved towards her. Tony close behind. They crouched down to her level. Steve gave his most charming smile before he spoke, “Hey, shouldn’t you be playing with your brothers,” he thumbed to the cubs.
Once they’ve touch, something felt a bit off for Tony. Couldn’t be sure what it was but Wade eyes seemed to
Tony took hold of a sheet and pulled it off the couch. Motioned for Odin to take a seat.
He knew they were friends. He really did, but it was making Steve uncomfortable. “Relax Steve.” Bucky placed a firm hand to his shoulder. He was growling again. Bucky face held unbridled laughter, not wanting to piss off Steve anymore.
