After getting him back to his room, I wander back to mine, falling down onto my bed, letting out a light laugh.
"So you knew her?" I ask, my voice breaking slightly. Iron Man nods, sending me a sympathetic glance. "How was she? like- did she move on? was she happy?"
"well for me its only been a couple of years since the commandos." I tell her with a smile. "you haven't changed either. I'd bet you could still take down a bad guy with a bobby pin."
"Its your fault for accepting a job from Tony." I laugh, standing up and holding my hand out to him. "coffee?" I offer when I see the look he normally has in the morning - one that tells me he is not getting out of bed.
"I don't know, I just got thinking. I miss my boyfriend, you know, and you remind me a lot of him." he says with a chuckle, moving to sit closer to me. "thanks for being my friend."
"okay, I'll catch up with you later." she says with a smile, heading in the same direction as Pepper as I head towards Tony. I lean against the wall next to him, nudging his shoulder when he doesn't notice my presence.
"I'm worried about you. also the whole 'Cap is looking after Steve' lie isn't working anymore." She tells me, moving some empty containers off my sofa to sit next to me. "I mean, I've never seen you like this. You're lounging around in your underwear, this place is a mess, and you really need a shower and a hair cut."
"don't be ridiculous, no one is gonna come in, and I promise not to look." I say, smiling at the blush rising over his cheeks before turning around.
"god, are they duplicating themselves? there seems to be thousands." I mutter, leaning my hands on my knees while keeping an eye out for more agents.
"nah, you're fucking with me." He says, looking to Natasha. "he's fucking with me right?" he asks Nat quietly.
"hey, can't you see I'm crippled? and I needed the good Captain to keep me from dying of blood loss." Iron Man tells her, a grin in his metallic voice. "and we weren't cuddling, we both have almost boyfriends."
"well if you ever need someone to practice with I know Iron Man would be up for it, I also have some punching bags that can withstand Iron Man." Tony tells me with a grin, and I smile back.
"thanks. see you soon." I say, closing the door behind me, before scaling the building again to get back into Steve's clothes.
"Don't wanna hear it, Natasha." I yell, throwing the empty bottle against the door, knowing she'd just walk in anyway. sure enough, a second later the door opens, Iron Man stepping around the door instead, his eyes instantly going to the glass on the floor. "you look very sketchy in that. should I be worried that you're coming into my house in a black balaclava?" I ask with a smirk, not bothering to move.
"I'm sorry sir I did try." JARVIS chimes in, while Natasha's smile turns into more of a grin as she looks at something on her phone.
"Steve wait- I was in a bad place back then and I loathe myself for hurting you. please, just give me a chance?" He asks, standing up and instantly losing his balance. I catch him and steer him back towards the bed, gently pushing him down.
"okay then, Cap I'll take you inside." She tells me leading me away. I open my eyes when I hear a door shut, wincing at the sudden brightness. I look around and identify the place as one of SHIELD's quinjets, and take a seat.
"it was fun though." Tony says, leaning his head back against my chest. "Right, I'm getting a scotch." I turn back to the film, where some new breed of dinosaur is proceeding to eat everyone apart from the main characters, naturally. Tony places his scotch on the table in front of us, before sitting down next to me on the sofa. I wrap my arm over his shoulder, while using my other to spread the blanket over us.
"Cap has gone back to brooklyn for a couple of nights." I say quietly, looking up but looking back down straight away, when Natasha's eyes meet mine. that girl is too damn perceptive.
"he can stay at mine tonight." I tell Natasha, throwing her my keys as I stuff Tony into the backseat and following him in.
"You know I thought you were him for a while." Iron Man comments after a while, smiling lightly at me.
"uh I think he said something about meeting up with some old friends." I say, sending him a thankful smile.
"oh yeah. my walls were lined with his posters- wait this feels like a really dumb question but what
"oh pretty good, although iron man bled all over my workshop before leaving to snuggle up with Captain Spangles." he complains.
"hang on - you haven't been with other people?" he asks, his voice becoming sharp, my face falling before I can stop it. "So what? its my fault for not knowing that you were so deep into this? thats on you Steve, not me. If you wanted a commitment, you should have said."
. I mean its literally just a cut, but apparently Tony is still around, so I am not." I explain, leaning against a tree.
"well if you knew Steve like I do, you'd know he's definitely not the sexually repressed image that America makes him out to be." Nat jokes.
"Tony asked me to live here when you left, and he's staying at my place for a little while." He tells me, coming to lean against the surface next to me.
"No, just mustering the courage for coffee." he tells me, so I slide Tony's in front of him and put another on.
"god you two have gone straight to old married couple." Clint whines into the coms, making us both laugh.
"oh I know I still love him." I sigh, falling back onto my bed. "just maybe not in the same way anymore."
oh dear god I'm resorting to quoting emo bands for titles now ( this one is from rome falls by panicland XD (bloody good song tho))
"you were saying?" she sasses. Suddenly Iron Man drops down beside me, dodging a bullet as he lands.
"it was getting boring over there." He explains, firing his repulsor at a hydra agent. "can't you see we're
"oh please. the poor girl is probably in a committed relationship with you by now in her head." I say, chuckling at him.
"yeah I'm not surprised. I'll go and put the coffee on." I say with a chuckle, rolling out of bed. A few minutes later he joins me in my small kitchen, quickly grabbing a mug of coffee and taking a large drink from it. while he's staring lovingly at his coffee, I let my eyes dart shamelessly over his body. his olive skin is stretched flawlessly over his muscly chest, his muscles are more understated than mine, but hes still falls into the category of overly ripped for a non-supersoldier. I guess you don't notice it because of the suits.
"well, in most of the posters I had my helmet on, and the rest I had about 10 meters of makeup on." I laugh, sitting back against the wall.
"perfect Captain motherfucking America." I say, pulling off my suit and shoving on my hood because I really can't be assed today, grabbing a bottle of vodka out of the bag. "If only America knew." I chuckle, chugging the whole thing before slumping back on my sofa.
"Natasha, you better not be naked!" I say walking through the door to find Clint and Nat watching something together on her bed.
"you know why." I say, avoiding his eyes. "you're one of my closest friends. you're smarter than this." I say quietly, placing the bottle down and leading him towards the sofa in the corner of the room. I gently push him so he falls onto it before sitting down next to him, wrapping my arm around his shoulder.
"I'm heading back to Brooklyn, theres some stuff I need to grab, and I may as well do it now so I can pick up Steve." I say, pulling my boots on.
"from what I've heard from the news and from Natasha, you aren't big on 2nd dates." I say, raising an eyebrow at him.
Butterfingers whirrs happily when I walk in from where he's in the corner wearing the dunce hat, causing Dum-E and U to turn to look at me from where they're working.
"do you guys just spend every second together or something?" I ask as I walk in, grabbing a seat next to them.
"Yeah I told him, but the way he reacted- I just ended it." I explain, a slight pulling sensation running across my stomach.
"hellooo." she sings as I sit down next to her, placing my shield by the side of my seat. Hawkeye walks in next with Bruce trailing after him.
"no he's staying somewhere near your tower, apparently anything bad that happens seems to be centred around your tower." I chuckle, cringing at how easily I'm lying to him.
"I was too harsh. I just- i don't know." I take a deep breath, looking down at my knees. "first it became obvious that you weren't interested in me as anything more than a friend, which is fine by the way - but this last week you've been drifting away from me and I want to know if you're just sticking with me for me."
"I got you coffee." I say, grabbing the mug and handing it to him as he sits up. He takes a long sip, before opening his eyes to send me a smile.
"Thank you, thats good to know I'm not making an absolute fool of myself. Its a pleasure to meet you, I read up on your work, but I can't say I understood much." I laugh, sitting back down. Bruce opens his mouth to respond, but before he can Iron Man walks in.
"Oh no I think it was the other way around. the guy is like one of those Greek statues, probably has about the same amount of muscle as you actually." Tony tells me with a laugh.
to have a conversation over here?" he sighs as more agents run at him, turning to take them out, before turning back to face us.
"He does. I understand why you're pissed about it still, but Tony has a lasagne of commitment issues." He tells me, placing his mug in the sink.
"and if I hadn't come after you, then you would have died and we would have lost him anyway! you're not a super soldier Captain, stop acting like one!"
"I'm sorry - We tried our hardest to help you without me seeing but I needed to carry you so they could keep pressure on your wounds." Steve explains coming and sitting on the edge of my bed, still dressed in his full gear.
"well maybe the old Tony. anyways, whats wrong with playing around a bit while searching for someone who you actually want to date?" He says, looking down at his menu again, before closing it as the girl returns to our table.
"Tony- I told him about what pepper said." I say, burying my face in my pillow so she doesn't see me cry.
"so if you could just try it on, then I have a few tests to run to make sure it all fits." I say, handing him the pile of clothes.
"are you adverse to breaking speed limits?" I ask as I get going, looking at Iron Man through my mirrors.
"I'm going home for a bit. I need to get my head around this all. I'll see you for our next mission." I say, walking around her and running down the stairs, tears welling in my eyes, threatening to fall.
"look I'm sorry I was stupid, I just saw a flaw in your plan and you wouldn't have listened." He says when we're finished, tying the scraps of his undersuit around his waist.
that was a fun conversation. I couldn't exactly come out with 'oh yeah I'm kinda dating Tony' giving Iron Man lives with him, but luckily he understood why I didn't want to talk too much about it.
"Yep." He says, drinking some more while adding more detail to the hologram. The drink the bottle slips from his grasp and I reach out to grab the bottle before it can smash before placing it down on the table behind me.
"Steve?" Tony asks, rubbing his hand over his face, and interrupting my thoughts. "ugh I feel like shit."
"yeah I was going to but I ended up staying with a friend in Brooklyn. You and Steve have a fun night?" I ask, sitting down next to Nat.
"I guess both." he chuckles, out of the corner of my eye I can see he's still maintaining eye contact.
"its no problem, I just hardly ever talk about him. For me it was what? about a year and a half since he died I think? maybe less? I'm not too sure. anyways, the only person I ever really talked to about it was Peggy, so its sort of a double hit." I say, smiling up at him.
"okay.. well what do you suggest?" I ask, trying to keep an open mind. its not like I think this is what I want to do forever, This isn't who the world needs Cap to be after all.
"no its- its not your fault. I'm sorry I didn't tell you when I knew you were so close with other Steve." I say slightly louder, my voice breaking, causing me to wince. "how long have I been out?"
"okay, well I was going to ask you if you wanted to grab some coffee." A smile playing on his lips. I smile, before letting it fall again.
"yeah lets go, I need to get the jet from there anyway." I say, chucking him my bike helmet as I pull my hood on. I quickly climb onto my bike, feeling him climb on behind me before kicking it to life.
"oh okay, cool. I got Iron Man to record the meeting for me today, as I couldn't be there." Tony says, a small grin on his face. I feel my face go hot as I lean forward to death glare at Natasha. she just laughs, pulling out the photo again.
"god a guy can't get 5 minutes as Steve Rogers around here." I mutter, turning around to give Natasha some privacy as we both pull on our suits.
"I'll be fine - not the worst thing thats happened to me, don't look so worried, Capricorn." He tells me, a smile in his voice.
"mm.. how long have you been awake?" He asks, sitting up next to me, his voice thickened with sleep.
"holy fuck?" I say, watching myself. Its not too noticeable that I have makeup on, but it makes my eyes seem brighter and bluer, even my cheekbones seem sharper.
"yeah Cap's been keeping me posted. look Tony, why the hell are you even talking to me? you've been avoiding me like the plague for the last god knows how long, and now you come over here, chatting as if we're best mates?" I say, turning to face him for the first time since he sat down. I have to say, he's a mess. I mean obiously his appearance is flawless - Pepper would have his ass if it wasn't - but I can tell by the way he is sitting, by the empty glass in his hand that was nearly full a few minutes ago, that he's not okay."
"No I meant it." I respond, blushing lightly. He's suddenly in front of me, causing me to slam back into the wall in surprise. His hands move up my arms, his eyes watching my face.
"you told JARVIS to wake you up, and for some reason you weren't budging so I took to a more physical method." she explains with a smile.
"turn around, I need to change." he tells me with a small smile, making a hand gesture mimicking me turning around. I do as he says, pulling on my shirt and buttoning it up.
I act before I can even think about what was happening. the second I heard that crash I ripped myself away from Iron Man, rolling so I'm kneeling over him, my arms braced above his head and him flat on his back. I feel the concrete hit my back, and I strain against it.
"good to know. want to come to my floor and watch a film?" Tony asks, uncurling his legs. his floor is like his own apartment - it has a small kitchen, joined with a living room type thing, a bathroom and a bedroom.
"Steve, help me get the plates out?" Nat says quietly, walking towards the kitchen. I follow her after a second, reaching up to grab the plates.
"going back to the joke, it actually wasn't a joke. We were up at 5am every morning to go for a run." I say, sipping on my tea.
"okay, this feels better." I say with a smile as I rejoin Nat, watching her straighten the odd piece of furniture.
"okay, fuck I only have half a mask, you can't look at me." he says, squirming slightly beneath the large hunk of concrete on his chest.
"they wanted me to be strong, like Captain Rogers was, but he could lift buses, so thats a bit unrealistic." I laugh, placing down my empty mug.
"Steve is Captain America. don't be an ass and tell anyone on the team, especially not Tony or Iron Man or I'll cut off your dick and shove it up your ass." Natasha chuckles, raising her eyebrows at me.
"yeah." he says, slowly moving up my body, hesitantly placing his lips on mine. I let my eyes flutter shut for a moment, completely relaxing under his touch, before carefully pushing him back.
"oh wow yeah that really accentuates- well a lot of stuff." he says, his hand going up to scratch his head, before it drops uselessly to his side, him clearly forgetting he's dressed in a metal suit.
"I don't think so, he's really happy with his not-quite-a-boyfriend he keeps going on about - but he said that Mr America seemed more relaxed, more chatty around him." Tony says, smiling gently.
"we're fucking idiots." I whisper, a grin finding its way to my face. He just laughs, looking down and biting his lip. one of my hands is on his waist - I'm not sure how it got there exactly - but I use it to pull him against me, capturing his lips in a more urgent kiss, his tongue grazes my lip and causes me to gasp.
"don't worry - I don't mind cuddles." I laugh, handing him the mug of coffee I've had on the bedside table.
"you're an idiot, you know that right?" she asks, walking around the corner in her underwear, her red hair sticking to her back. "showers all yours."
"are you ready to order?" she asks, only looking at Tony, which causes him to flash me a grin, a hint of sadness still in his eyes, and I'm honestly not too sure why.
"we have our masks off, because it was stuffy enough in there and it was dark." I say, pulling back from the hug. she just laughs, grabbing my hand.
"Straight to the hard stuff, huh? The girl that bad?" I joke, sliding into one of the seats next to him.
"okay first, how long have you been up there? and second, don't you think that would maybe freak him out a little?" I say, sitting up.
"Just wanted to see how you'd react." She tells me, sighing as she stretches her arms out. "And I got some good photos." I run over to her, making a grab for her phone. just in time she pulls it out of my way and locks it, grinning at me.
He dropped the branch down and considered jumping to show off, but he decided against on the basis that a broken leg of his own would make him poor company.  He climbed down, grabbed the stick, and presented it to Viper with flourish.  "A walking stick for you," he said with a rakish wink.
Frowning, Steve chased the implications of that.  Why would Tony be in danger at SHIELD?  His name had been cleared of the double dealing, even if the media kept hounding him for it as a cover up.  He didn't think most SHIELD agents harbored any ill intentions toward Tony either, though he also thought there was no love lost between Tony and SHIELD - just not enough to need that sort of caution.
"You retain your insolence," Doom growled.  "I have done my part.  This alliance has ended."  Doom turned, his cape flowing dramatically behind him as he left the room.
"One that could balance out the chaos to come," she said.  "Take care of Steve.  He is important to all of us."
"I will be fine," Viper said, smiling sweetly at him.  "I am at the temple now.  Nothing will harm me here."
The calm tightened around his mind and a stubborn red joined the colors.  "I'm coming," Steve said, his mental voice sounding far away.
He looked up to find Steve stretched out on one of the highest rock formations, soaking up the light of the moss and generally pretending to ignore Tony.  Emphasis on pretending, because Tony could definitely feel the curiosity rolling off of Steve even with the suit on.
"I did try earlier," Steve said defensively.  He'd extended a few invitations through Iron Man the first month, but they had all been declined.  Of course, he hadn't really tried that hard.
The next night Tony found himself in a dark cave.  It was cold - bitterly cold.  It surprised Tony since all the caves have been mostly warm so far.  There was a moss lamp up ahead that Tony hurried towards in hopes of warmth, surprised to see another human.  Except when he drew closer, he realized it wasn't human.  It was a monster in a human's shape.
"Magic," Peggy replied, and there was a hint of laughter about her wings as they fanned out behind her.
Tony could get lost in that feeling, in the tenderness of Steve's thumbs and the desperate way Tony clung to his wrists to keep him there.  There was a wistfulness and longing to the kiss that could be coming from either him or Steve, he couldn’t tell.
"I'm sorry," Steve said again, swallowing down his unwillingness to back down from the fight.  It went against everything in his nature, but he wasn't going to let this break them apart.
Steve strained to hear, barely picking up on a rich, female voice on the other end of the line saying,  "He's awake.  It wasn't for long, but the doctors say he's out of the woods for now."
"Ms. Potts called me," Steve said gently.  "She said Bruce needed your help for the Tachyon particles.  And she needed you in R&D."
The smile Steve saw in all of the videos was back, and he wished he knew what to say to bring back the warmer one.  "You didn't sleep with her."
It was certainly a nice outfit, but the neckline was low.  Very low.  "You shouldn't need this kind of exposure."  Then he winced, because Tony was already snickering at his unintentional innuendo.
The ground shook violently, like it had with the hydra coming to the surface.  Was there a third?  Tony didn't have time to think as he was knocked into Steve and he heard Viper scream.  "As you humans say, go to Hell!" Steve said, the flame dying from his throat.  The smell of burning flesh was nauseating, and Tony was a little glad he couldn't regain his footing to look.
he told himself firmly.  He pulled away enough to keep the hug friendly, one arm behind Iron Man's back as he led them to the couch.  "It'll work out, Shellhead.  Speaking of work, considering we haven't seen you around recently - what have you been up to?"
"Do a lot of people want certain celebrities to get together?" Steve asked, feeling foolish. The USO girls had talked about the Hollywood rags, of course, and come to think of it, a few of them probably had the same level of devotion towards certain couples, but Steve honestly felt a little out of his depth on this one.
"I think we can find you some more fuel," Steve said, looking at the engine as he sniffed at it again.  "And the war on top sounds important, but even during the dragon wars, there was always dancing.  Sometimes more, in times of hardship."
Tony dropped Rhodey's hand, then straightened it out once he realized what he'd done.  He didn't look at Rhodes or Steve as he walked out, and Steve only just caught the hint of tears before they were hidden away by his sunglasses.
"Tony," Steve said, moving forward and looking very self-conscious while he did.  Just as Steve got within a few steps, however, he misstepped and fell forward, taking Tony with him.
Tony wanted to say no.  He wanted to yell and shout with his already abused throat to tell Steve to get lost, because he really didn't need this pity and misguided guilt.  They had pulled the plug on the relationship and for good reason.  What more did Steve want?  To stomp on the wires?  Because right now even being back under that building was looking like a good alternative.
Cap's eyes darkened before he closed them, and Leon regretted asking.  "No, I didn't save everyone.  Sometimes, I think, if anyone
"Then turn your back," Tony said.  "You could still hear me get away.  You could probably hear me thinking about it if I tried."
"You know your history," Captain America said approvingly.  "At least humanity has come that far.  So if it's not that, why are you so quiet lately?"
"Such wedded bliss," Kor'la'vin said, watching with interest.  "Wipe his memories now, and I'll consider it.  And remember, I'm watching your codes for any tricks you might pull."
Tony paused, staring at Steve's lips like he was riveted.  "That look better damn well be a promise, Rogers," he practically growled.
"It's different like this," Tony said, opening his eyes to get a better look. In a plane or in the suit, Tony was only exceeded by Rhodey as a pilot, but this was a level of its own.  He could feel the wind running past him and if there had been clouds, he'd have been able to touch them.  It was freeing in a way he hadn't felt since before the War.
Steve tugged lightly on Tony's wrist, not pulling, but not relinquishing his grip either.  Tony was helpless to resist.
Tony still looked like he wanted to argue, so Steve pulled him in for a hug, kissing his temple.  He could feel Tony practically trembling in anger.  "I need to get started
The future.  It was funny when he considered how far he'd come, yet how far he still had yet to fall.  There was nothing...
"Sure, man.  River in Egypt," Rhodey said with a snort.  "Not that I disapprove, but the Tony Stark Defense Squad?"
Rhodey leaned back, his arms crossed over his chest thoughtfully.  "Honestly, I don't believe half the things that come out of your mouth sometimes.  I've heard you tell stories where I'd been there, remember?"
"First, Howard Stark is a sore topic.  Do not bring him up unless Tony does first, and then steer the conversation away as fast as you can because that's probably Tony spoiling for a fight."
The fury that had been missing earlier nearly blinded Tony.  If he hadn't been pressing down on Steve's wound, he would have risked rushing her, gun and all.  "We. Are. Not. Leaving. Him," Tony said, gritting out the words as Steve whined softly.  And damn, he knew Steve was playing it up, but the sound twisted at his heart in ways the heart pump couldn't fix.  "Hydra's days are numbered and if I do make it out of here, I won't stop until I bury every last head.  You sure you still want that ride?"
Tony shot at the hydra's neck as he flew by with a rapid line of bullets, aiming the flame thrower at the neck that was now only barely clinging to the base by bits of skin.  One of the other heads knocked into him and threw his aim off.  He spun out of control, dropping about fifty feet before he righted himself, stomach flopping as he swallowed back his breakfast.
"If I promise to come back in ten minutes, will you stop following me?" Tony asked conversationally.  He could understand paranoia, but this was a bit ridiculous.
"Lieutenant, I need - Ah!"  The static in his ear was intense and he nearly dropped his shield as he fell to his knees.  He pulled down his cowl and fumbled for the com link, ears still ringing as he tried to stand, but stumbled.
insinuated the girl had been much younger when they'd had sex.  Steve was so angry he almost missed what Stark muttered a few seconds later.  "Or after."
"I've only spoken with him a few times face to face.  Mostly he just emails me with collaborations, like with the prosthetic limbs he's trying to create."  Bruce took off his glasses and started to wipe them clean.  Then he put them back on and looked down at his tablet.  "He's had me and a specialist in Korea consulting on that, but I speak more with Dr. Cho, the specialist, than with him.   I don't think he's the type for double dealings."
"Interesting," Tony said, wondering what kind of biological trick caused that particular trait.  "I could ask Steve to get you one.  It'd be safer for you."
Tony bowed his head and nodded, hating himself for not being able to say no.  He didn't deserve this.  He didn't deserve Steve.  Steve would-
He got an armful of two teenage girls, and Leon joined them after a nod from Steve, but he wouldn't have it any other way.
Steve shut his eyes, forcing his thoughts away from that.  Stark hadn't even been that hostile when Steve assumed about the affair.  Something had spooked him.  Something had him scared enough to lash out and-
Finally, Tony nodded.  It was a curt thing that wasted no movement, but he'd barely moved before Steve was pulling Tony against him with a desperation that scared him.
He did take off one of the armor's gauntlets, figuring the repulsor might come in handy.  It'd been easy enough to rewire in the end and it had only taken a few minutes separate it.  It felt strange without the rest of the armor, and he flexed his hand thoughtfully as he hooked up the wires to his heart pump.  The orichalcum should have no problem with the output, but he didn't think firing repeatedly would be a very pleasant experience for him.  Still, he probably had worse from the days he had to continuously recharge the pump.
"Okay, but this guy's being an ass about it.  So let's not," Iron Man said, tapping into the chair's interface.  "Besides, who said you didn't belong here?  There's no place I'd rather have you be."
Steve didn't mention what could happen, because Tony was already coming up with a list in his head.  Instead he placed a small kiss on Tony's head, hugging him tighter.  "I'm proud of you."
"Maybe the fact you've pulled back at the same time he became unreachable," Steve said dryly.  "Tony, I know you want to catch whoever is behind this.  Let us help you."
"In a snow storm?" Tony asked incredulously.  Then he did a few mental calculations.  "We were probably flying over the Great Lakes, come to think of it.  Fucking lake-effect snow.  That's just messed-"
Steve let out a puff of smoke and slowly uncurled himself from around Tony.  In the moss's version of daylight it wasn't as cold up here, but Tony found himself missing the dragon's bulk regardless.
Steve gestured to the waffles.  "You fall back on Tony-tactics even for the rest of us.  Blueberry waffles are his favorite."
"You didn't have to agree with me," Steve replied, but there was no accusation in his tone.  It was broken and small, and it made Tony ache to pull Steve against him and hold him close until Steve sounded happy again.  He didn't though; he stared at his empty hands instead. Had Steve needed a reason to stay?  Tony had probably jumped to conclusions if Steve had been asking.  He had been pretty angry at the time.
He wondered who her parents could be.  From his side of the Atlantic, since she didn't have the British vowels, but definitely not part of the local population up top.  "You live here alone?" he asked.
His left arm was forced down by the tentacle holding it, and a second tentacle wrapped around his torso, pinning his arm to his side. Another tentacle positioned his right arm until he was aiming directly at the crystal.
Steve's muttering stopped after that, but Tony got the impression dark blue was good for hiding in the shadows.
"Happy, this is Captain America.  Of course he's authorized to be here," Iron Man said, something in his voice telling Steve that he was trying not to laugh.
It wasn't a long journey to Tony's cabin.  He sank into his bed as Jarvis laid him down, too soft after getting used to Steve's flank.  Soft and cold.  "Steve-"
It could also fly, according to Tony, but Steve didn't see any wings on it.  He laid on the edge, pretending not to pay attention.  He didn't really think Tony could get up here, but he'd humor the human for now.  Tony liked showing off, and Steve liked watching him.
She did know why, because Steve had needed to hear it, but he ignored the jab at his denial.  Except now, he had no clue where to go from here.  If he was in love with Tony, what did he do with that information?
Sometimes he hated the fact that Vision had instant access to all of the safety monitors in the gym and probably a few of his own.
"No matter," Kor'la'vin said.  "I will find her, and that little brat in the Iron Man armor won't last.  But you...  The original Iron Man.  You could work for us."
Taken aback, Steve's eyes widened.  Then anger took over.  "He doesn't make weapons anymore," he said.  Tony had a panic attack over the robots having some of his circuitry.  He'd been genuinely upset people were getting hurt because of that, not just Rhodes.
The reminder of Tony's words was poking at the still fresh wounds, and Steve's grip around Tony automatically tightened.  He forced himself to be gentler, because he couldn't hurt Tony, not like that.  He stubbornly grasped at the anger though, until he forced himself to let go of it.  Steve needed to redirect that stubbornness into making this
He watched as Steve came down the stairs, expertly navigating them despite the crutches.  He waved the door open so that Steve wouldn't have to stand awkwardly while inputting his code.  He kept his face blank as Steve hobbled inside, motioning to the chair across from him, which Steve sank into gratefully.
The Stark Industries meeting room was at least comfortable.  It was tastefully furnished, even if the modern art on the walls wasn't to his fancy.  A brief check on Google told him it was ridiculously expensive too and the artist was important.  He made a note to Google more of the artist's works later when he wasn't on a small phone, because he was still interested in the art movement even if he didn't always like it.
Steve looked through the glass, his view too limited to see Tony or the machine.  Then he looked down at his hands.  Having the shield would be better because he was pretty sure that was reinforced glass and it was bulletproof.  He wasn't sure he wanted to waste the time to go back up and get it, however.  He couldn't afford Tony an opportunity to escape now that he was fairly sure JARVIS had warned him of what Steve knew.  "JARVIS, is Tony going to let me in?"
There was a number of things wrong with that statement.  Tony shouldn't be in love with Jan.  And he shouldn't be calling for Carol to save him when
"I'm sorry for leaving," Steve said.  "I shouldn't have, especially not because I was angry and scared.  I... probably would have felt better, staying with you.  And you wouldn't have been left behind."
Tony ran a quick diagnosis and found a couple, but they were an easy fix on his part.  "Nope.  You did a fantastic job putting me back together, Little Bird."
"He will always be there," Wanda said, merriment in her eyes as her nostrils flared.  "But not always paying attention.  I suspect he is now because it is rare for anyone other than me to be allowed in this cavern.  If you concentrate, you can see what he is doing as well."
"It is clear that you are the one who will destroy this world, and the future with it," Kang said, picking himself up off the ground.  "You are the one who doesn't belong in this time period.  So I will kill you, and save the world and my own future."
"I would watch your tone when speaking to Doom.  I do not tolerate threats," Doom replied, his eyes narrowed.
Still, the twins seemed to be settling in, and they had gotten more leads on the Skrulls' movements.  Steve was debating if they had enough to take this to the resistance or if they still needed more when Tony appeared beside him.
"He's fine.  Sam and Thor are with him," Rhodey replied.  "His frost bite is worse than yours, and walking on that leg set back his recovery, but he'll probably heal faster.  As to what happened, Hydra was trying to hack JARVIS.  It was a coincidence that you hit thundersnow when you did, but having JARVIS out of the picture probably didn't help the plane's instruments."
"I'm wearing a long-sleeved shirt," Tony said, tugging off his suit jacket with as little space as possible between them to conserve the warmth he was about to lose.  "You've got no sleeves at all."
Tony wished he had demanded a tablet, because now he had nothing to keep his attention or to keep  his hands occupied.  He could only stare at the burn marks on his hands and be grateful that they weren't too bad.
Tony was used to being left behind if he were honest with himself.  Maybe that was why it hurt so much when even Steve left. It was really hard to stay angry in the face of all of Steve's emotions though.  He could still feel the grief and the anger, and he tried not to think about what that meant.  "I'm..."
Tony started, looking up to see Peggy in front of him.  She touched his cheek comfortingly, and Sharon's wing came up to cover him and block the view.
Steve sighed, closing his eyes.  "How many people know?" he asked, reminding himself not to feel bitter or jealous.
"Sometimes you just end up in a dumpster, Cap," Clint said, completely unconcerned either by Steve's glare or his answer, ignoring both.  "As to the rest, it wouldn't surprise me, but I've never actually met him.  Nat?  You wrote the file on him."
get better.  And you've been training hard the past few weeks.  You can't go into this assuming you'll fail."
Tony was far from passive in the kiss, however, even if Steve enforced the pace, and Steve soon found himself stifling a moan because wow, he didn't know a kiss could feel this good.  Tony's
Steve's grip loosened immediately, but didn't give enough to allow Tony to escape.  "We need to get warm," Tony reminded him.
Stark held his hands up in surrender.  "Had no idea it was here, Pep.  Which is not to say it wouldn't have been gone by the time Captain Rogers left, but not me this time."
He didn't say they didn't know if the serum would keep Steve alive this time, or if it only worked last time because it happened so fast.  This was Steve, and Steve was the single most obstinate person Tony knew, including his own self.  Steve would survive, no problem.
"She has a point, Little Bear," Tony said as he administered some kind of drug to Leo.  "Ask Cap.  You programmed him not to lie."
Steve nodded, leaning a little closer so that their shoulders brushed, but Tony didn't even blink.  It worried him.  "How is he?"
"That's easy," Ms. Castillo said, taking the sculpture from him.  "I take this to Ms. Potts and say one of the staff broke it while cleaning.  It's a bit of legend; Mr. Stark and Ms. Potts's fight over it, so everyone thinks it's her favorite.  The staffer wanted to be anonymous for fear of being fired.  Ms. Potts just keeps it to annoy Mr. Stark, so she won't miss it."
"I am not one of the City's defenders, but you know I can fight," Wanda said, folding her wings against her sides.  "There is still much that must be done.  The human should see the mural before the chaos comes."
"Any kind of relationship will hurt eventually," Steve said.  It sounded like he was quoting someone, but Tony couldn't quite sense if it were Peggy or Sam.  "We can talk when you get back.  But Tony... thank you."
Bruce sipped his tea, wrapping his hands around the mug like he coveted its warmth.  "I don't know.  Maybe it's just the way he pokes at me like Iron Man does that's messing with my head."
"Hey, take it easy," Cap said, no longer next to Leon, but kneeling in front of him.  Leon froze as Cap started to massage the swollen muscles.  "You're pushing it too much."
"Careful.  She still has two charges left and she's planning something," Tony said.  "She'll have more control over where she can hop to with her stalling too.  She's upsetting you so you'll make mistakes.  Keep your head."
Steve was going to take his embarrassment over how he acted while meeting Hedy Lamarr to the grave.  "I was a propaganda piece, not a movie star," he insisted.
"I still don't trust you," Steve said.  "Or your weapons.  I can keep an eye on you like this, but on the ground it's easier for you to sneak off."
, because someone will steal it and hurt people.  It's all going to be used to kill people and it's my own goddamn fault for-"
"I know what you saw," Tony said, cutting him off.  He wasn't sure he could handle Steve saying it.  "Don't worry about it.  It's not your problem."
"I'll take care of that," Steve said firmly as Tony shut the computer down.  "Why don't you go sit with Colonel Rhodes until everything is ready?"
Steve stared at the door she left through, closing his eyes and not thinking about how Iron Man would have squeezed his shoulder or offered him a hug while saying something like that.  "Time to go home," he said to himself.  Except without the other Avengers or Iron Man... without
Instead, Susan slipped out of bed.  Tony or Cap were usually around the moment one of them woke up, and she wasn't surprised to see Tony in the kitchen, warming some milk for her.  She took a seat at the counter, swinging her feet as she took him in.  Tony was a little taller than her, but still shorter than Kes and Leo.  He was dressed casually in a t-shirt from a band she'd never heard of and blue jeans.  He didn't have shoes or socks on, which Susan would have thought would be freezing for anyone else, but how much computer programs felt that sort of thing was a debate for Kes, not for her.
"Am not," Tony said, looking down at his watch.  6:10, which was... maybe it was late?  He was also wearing dress slacks and a nice shirt, so he must have gotten ready before he got lost in the armor.
"God damn stubbornness," Tony countered.  Because the serum would help, but Steve's will power had done the majority of it, make no mistake on that.  And he'd done all of that while lugging around Tony's dead weight and managing to keep Tony out of the wet snow too.
"I'm always quiet, sir," Leon replied, which was true enough.  Kes was the chatterbox.  He was generally happy not saying anything so long as he didn't have anything to say.
He groaned as he opened his eyes.  It was completely dark, of course.  It's not like visual acuity would come in handy when his heart wasn't beating properly or when Tony would have felt a little better for the light.  Still, Tony was used to the universe conspiring against him.  There was a flashlight in the survival kit Jarvis had insisted on building into the suit, and Tony was ridiculously glad he had, just that once, listened to the old man's suggestion.
We walk in, and the first thing I notice is the amount of rolled up flannel shirts, vest tops and body glitter.
"Jeez, you think Stark is even good enough for that gorgeous lump of muscle?" Iron Man's robotic voice asks, taking Natasha's phone. Natasha laughs, and just when she's about to reply, Nick Fury walks in so Iron Man walks back to his seat.
"I saw her all the time, she was always visiting Tony and so was I, so we naturally crossed paths. his dad worked a lot, but Peg always came over and bullied him into going drinking with the other vets. she did eventually move on, but I think she waited a really long time, Howard spent a good part of his life searching for you." He tells me, sighing. "and um- she's still here."
"oh trust me, I'm far from perfect when I take this off. I just have to be someone else in this suit." I say, looking down slightly.
"no thanks, Happy's outside. Bye, Steve." Tony tells me with a smile, before shutting my door behind him.
"I had time, also I can handle myself. anyways, the only thing you coming after me  managed to do was get us both stuck!" I say back, hearing some shifting from the other side of the room. The reason we got called in was because of some acid spitting aliens. I saw a basement and wanted to check for civilians before the whole building went down, which is how I have ended up in a semi collapsed basement with Iron Man. I find the light I keep strapped to my belt, flicking it on before throwing it to the centre of the room. I easily lift the piece of wood pinning my leg down, before making my way towards Iron Man. Most of his suit got disintegrated by the acid, the rest of it hanging off him.
"Steve wouldn't have minded, he probably enjoyed the chance to see more of you. Nat told me that he left her a very excited message." I chuckle, easily slipping into Captain America mode now.
"how about I do something to help you relax?" he offers, one of the eye pieces going dark to mimic a wink, us both laughing.
"aww no now you're making the poor captain blush" She says, her eyebrows furrowing at my panicked look before following with her own. "sorry, just a joke I like to make because of his name and greek god muscles."
"Imagine if it was the other way around." she says quietly. I deliberate for a second, before lowering myself onto a stair. "I'll be back for you in a bit."
"thats okay - I'm not ready to take mine of either so same boat." he laughs, this time lighter. "so are you gonna tell me how you could hold up a building?"
A couple of hours later I make my way back to the tower, falling down on my bed after checking Tony's floor, finding it empty.
"so you think I will have remembered you? I didn't like have a one night stand with you while super drunk, because I definitely won't remember that." He laughs.
"to tell you the truth. the only problem is I really don't wanna lose the mask yet." I say, looking up at him.
"we're being called in." I shout, grabbing my uniform and quickly slipping into it. "how did you get here?"
"yeah" I chuckle, looking away from Iron Man's outline. why on earth is he bringing this up, most of all now? I mean jesus fuck we're stuck in a collapsed basement together minutes away from our probable death, but sure lets have this talk.
"okay I'm walking away now." I say, heading towards Tony's lab with a small smile on my face. as much as Nat annoys me, for some reason I never end up hating her. I guess its like it was with me and Buck - we were like brothers, we fought all the time and he was a pain in my ass, but we never properly fell out.
"Steve is leaving, and I'm taking him back." I say, stuffing some clothes into a bag. "I'll be back in a few days."
"running is faster than running home to get my bike. I'm a couple of minutes away now, so I'll get my helmet on so I'm on the coms." I say, in between breaths.
"oh really? well Tony and I did our research, and Clint Barton barely exists. no house, no landline, no nothing." he tells me, pulling up different websites, showing only a birth certificate, and a few mentions in a local newspaper as a kid.
"okay then surely going towards the door isn't the best idea?" Tony offers, in an equally quiet voice.
"I just still can't get over the fact that that guy is Hawkeye." Tony tells me. "I mean, the more you get to know him, the weirder it gets."
"okay." I sigh, sitting up. "Can you take him some food? He asked me to but I know he would force me to eat too, and I'm really not feeling up for it."
"well what do you mean by that? Captain America is so sexually repressed, and we've only been dating for a few weeks." I explain.
"yeah, I think so. I mean, I've cared about you twice now, and only hated you once. thats gotta count for something." I chuckle nervously.
"thanks for looking after me last night - I tend to overdo it when I'm out with friends." Tony tells me, his eyes occasionally flicking down to my chest.
"he kissed me." I say with a grin. "I mean he was sad about his boyfriend, so he definitely was not in his right mind."
"Late night?" I ask with a laugh, prodding his shoulder. sleepy Clint is always overly honest, he literally says whatever pops into his head.
On the other end of the room, Stephanie was dealing with a cocktail of emotions. She didn't know how to feel. She didn't know how to talk. Her eyes fixed at some point, mind wandering to the worst scenarios. She was brought out of her thoughts by Mrs. Barnes' question. "isn't it weird? Nobody came to the ceremony. No family or friends. I am sure I saw that strawberry blond somewhere with Stark. Isn't this suspicious to you?" she nagged. "There is nothing to worry about,” her mom reassured Mrs. Barnes.
“Hey Pepper Potts, CEO of my company and light of-” “what did you do Tony?” Pepper sighed, as her Friend and Boss decided to visit her one afternoon, at her office. “Why do you think I did something? Can’t I come in and see how my lovely CEO and her wonderful company are doing?” Tony said, throwing his trademark smirk. She knows he cares. Pepper knew Tony Stark when he flirted with her, on her first day at the job. She knew him when Stane betrayed them. She knew him when he shut down the weapons manufacturing and worked night and day to keep his company standing. She knew Tony who forgot to eat and sleep but still remembered that his receptionist’s granddaughter was a science buff. She also knew Tony would come to her because she was his only other family who would help him
“No. Go talk to him” he said, pushing Steve towards the other end of the room. Steve looked down at himself and took a deep breath.
On the other end, Sam saw Steve hiding behind the bar. "Hey man, who are you hiding from?" he startled him. “I uh, No one”, he squeaked, looking over his back. Sam followed his vision to find Stark, slightly tipsy and laughing out loud. “Isn’t it a date night for you? Why are you sulking around?” he nudged Steve with a shark smile.  “Wha- NO no, I uh don’t have a date”, he mumbled. “Did Stark say something?” he asked in confusion.
“I’ve waited long enough. Lost my patience. Would 7 work for you Barnes?” Sam asked, nerves under his skin.
Tony groaned and buried his head in his pillow to avoid the phone’s constant buzz. He whined and flopped in his bed as the buzzing continued and disturbed his suspended consciousness. He stared at the ceiling mentally summoning the force to stop the buzzing, it did not. He is not a Jedi. The buzzing stopped and he smiled.
“Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your plane” Tony continued like she never spoke. “if it departs before you arrive?”
“Or Dum-E would have dragged you to bed after you passed out on your workbench,” Bruce remarked, finishing his touch-ups. “Touché,” he said, slumping down in the chair. Bruce swatted him on the shoulder when his suit got wrinkled. “Hey Did you meet-” “STARK!!”, Bruce’s question was cut off by an agitated voice. “Gotta go. See you at lunch.” Tony said as he rushed out of his room.
in every place Steve is; flirting with Cheeky smiles and heart eyes. Turning green at the sight of guests around Steve at parties
“I said go ask him yourself. You wanna know why he asked you out? Go ask him. I’m sure he has answers.”
Tony let out a frustrated sigh after a while of mingling. He had been excited when Mr. Brooklyn had said yes. So excited that he forgot the details like name. He had a brief moment of panic when Rhodey pointed out.
He Bristled, “Eithuh he STILL don’t understand that weathuh is not climate despite literally everyone explaining it to him every time  he tweet this ignorance, or-”
he thought as he glared at the mini Ferris wheel and reached out to grab it. "ouch, you cruel women" he whined, when pepper hit his hand. "I have a meeting in 10 minutes, Tony. Go and nag your
They stood there close gazing into each other. “Hi” Steve blushed and squeaked. “Hi again” Tony said, smile so dazzling. “Tony I-” “You are so gorgeous” Tony cut him off, trailing a finger along Steve’s cheek. Steve shivered from the electricity passed through him from the touch, which got a deep growl from the other end. “You look Tony, Good. No- I mean-” his blabbering was cut off again by Tony’s lips.
A few footsteps broke her attention to the purple evening sky ahead. Few giggles and a lot more footsteps drew attention to the front door. Tony and a woman, walked in, all over each other giggling, and made their way upstairs, not batting an eye at Stephanie sitting in the living room. Her breath hitched. She was mad, frustrated, and weirdly hurt by seeing Stark with another woman. She doesn’t even like him, then why does it hurt? She walked away to her room and the door slammed shut.
Tony walked into Steve’s suit, mentally preparing for… he didn’t know what he was preparing for. He should have talked to Steve like a normal person. Now Steve hates him. He’s preparing for an angry outburst. Probably Steve yelling and cutting their friendship off. He is preparing to get socked in the jaw. He walked in to see Steve sitting in front of an easel at one end of the living room. “Steve I-”, Tony started. But he was cut off by Steve saying, “I know Tony. It’s okay. Forget it”, in a dejected voice and fake smile. “You- forget… what?”, Tony was confused now.
. It was obvious that Tony was trying to get in Cap's pants. “Welp, got work to do'' said Tony, making his way towards the Lift. Nat met Bucky’s eyes and gave him a nod. “Hey Hawkass, between you and me, who do you think has a better shot ?” Nat heard Bucky say as she finished her coffee and made her way to her suite.
Honestly, It was hard to be the face of American Television. With his Stark charm and witty comebacks, Tony is the dream of every producer and director of reality television. His days are run by shooting, meetings, promos, call sheets, contracts, scripts, make-ups, lights, and cameras. The nights run him down with parties, smooching, and fake smiles with fake people. But he would never regret this. Tony was born for the spotlight. Anthony Stark, the Son of Industrial Titan, Howard Stark, was seen as the chip of the old block. When he built his first engine at age 4 and first AI at age 16, everyone including his father was proud that he’s gonna take over the Stark Legacy. Then it became inevitable because of his parent’s death which made him take over Stark Industries when he was 21. He worked hard and partied hard. One SNL appearance as a guest host intrigued him and the world so much that he started making occasional appearances in different programs. He was double-minded after that. His last straw was when the double-dealings and his God Father, Obadiah Stane’s betrayal came to light. He shut down the weapons production; made his PA and Best friend Pepper Potts the CEO and High tailed out of the business. He struck a deal with Director Fury of SHIELD networks. Now, he gets to be daytime Emmy award nominee for best talk show host and the mind behind Stark Industries R&D.
“Oh Tones! There you are”, he heard and turned around to Darcy, his old producer, standing there. “I was just about to call you. We have one more PSA to record. I gave Peter the whole script. I didn’t know how he missed it-” She rambled steering them towards the studio. Tony took his seat at the studio setup, in front of the camera only to see Barton’s glare.
‘You always tell your students never to judge a book by its cover honey. It also goes for people. The media exaggerates, shows people like angels or demons. I’m sure he’s sweet’ her mom reassured her. ‘How do you know?’ she asked, to gain that confidence from her mom. ‘He has his mother’s eyes,'' Sarah said with a sweet smile and a soft voice.
“Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.” Pepper asked, noting down on her Stark Pad.
Other than that, her days were still. When she woke up late to an empty fridge on the first day, she asked JARVIS about food. She was directed to a scarcely stocked Pantry, many of which were expired. When asked about grocery shopping, JARVIS showed her a list made by Ms. Potts. She got to know that the grocery store was miles away from here and everything has been delivered so far. She added a few more to the list and ordered groceries. She cooked for herself, and leftovers were stocked in the fridge.
He is looking at the door, planning to bail, when Tony walks in. Steve choked on air seeing Tony walk in. He is breathtaking in a black suit with a rich red dress shirt and slacks hugging his thighs. Steve looked down at his own outfit, thrown over in last minute haste.
When Obie brought up the idea of marriage, he just balked at him for a minute and started laughing at the joke. When he was told it was not a joke, he refused. He knew how marriages worked. He saw how his mom used to dab her cheeks with blush to cover the bruises and throw a fake smile at everyone. He knew he was becoming just like his Dad. He loved his mom too much to give the same life she lived to another woman. Obie convinced him, telling him that it was just a stunt for 3 months for the board members. He was given so many choices. Choices better for SI’s future. But Rhodey’s choice stood out. He didn’t know why, but he chose this girl. Is it because she is a civilian? Is it because it is easy to cover up after 3 months? Is it because she was loved by Maria Stark? He didn’t know.
They broke apart for air. Tony’s eyes were dark and more focused now than earlier, which confused Steve about what happened next. “ I uh-. I have uh thing, a work to do, A CALL i have to make a call to someone. I have to call someone. Yeah Bye” Once confident Tony, blabbered and walked away.
Tony squashed down the hurt he felt and walked towards the door, “Just check in with whoever the Doc is Pep and-,”
On the other end, Steve Rogers sighed, taking out his earpiece and mic. He had been in SHEILD for a month now, avoiding this exact situation. Steve became a producer for various reasons. His passion for writing; his liking for the media glams; his friends. But recent times had added a few more reasons. One of which is his current show host. Tony Stark was gorgeous, smart, his type, and totally out of his league. Steve was skinny, gangly, and clumsy at times. Even though he said to his friends that he joined SHIELD networks for their better take-home than his previous job, deep down he knew it was his crush on Stark that sealed the deal.
Tony was buried in armor upgrades when Nat comes into his lab and stands next to him. After several encounters with 2 super spies and recently an assassin, Tony stopped getting surprised by their sudden appearances. He sort of... knows when people come into his lab without a pretense. Pepper and Natasha, when he does something stupid; Clint, to prank or gossip; Bruce, for some tools or Tony; Bucky, metal arm upgrades and now to mother hen him; Steve…, partially lives with Tony in the lab. “What did I do now ?” he asks Natasha, taking a sip of… what is supposed to be coffee. “You are trying to get into Steve’s pants” Nat retorted and Tony spits out...not coffee (he didn’t spit it out because of her question. NOT COFFEE). “I… what?”, Tony squeaked and wiped his mouth on his shirt sleeve. Nat raised one perfectly arched eyebrow at him which made him sigh.
“Tony you were supposed to-” “Pep, don’t worry I am here. Peter would be ready with my script already so it’s no big deal. I’ll take care of this. Bye Pep” “But Tony, Darcy-”.
Leon limped over to Kestrel, hugging her tightly as she dropped the gun.  Tony scanned the body for other traps but found nothing but a teleporter on her.  She was definitely dead this time, and after all she'd done to Steve and his ducklings, Tony was fiercely glad.
"Of course I am.  Why wouldn't I be?" Tony said, still not looking up from his tablet.  And if he called Steve a bad liar, Tony himself wasn't much better.  "You're seeing things, Cap."
Moving felt like too much effort.  The com chatter faded to background noise as Steve curled around his shield.  He was just so
"Steve, I know you're hungry," Tony said, poking the dragon's cheek.  "We've got to get going.  You promised me an early start, remember?"
"Eating with a friend," Steve said.  "I can't see you like this.  You don't have to talk while you're eating and I promise not to look.  Is that okay?"
"Tony!" Steve said as the man sank to the floor.  He didn't list forward, but Steve caught him just before his knees hit and he lowered them both down gently as Tony closed his eyes.  Steve could see tears at the corner of them, but he didn't mention it.
" Steve's voice rang in his mind as it cleared.  He didn't have time to reply, however, as the ceiling started to cave in.  Tony dodged not only the rocks and boulders that came down around him, but a massive hydra that was now falling back down to the ground.  "Whoa," he said, narrowly avoiding a head that tried to bring him down with it.  He watched for the few seconds as it fell before it disappeared into the darkness.
“Ha! If it had been my plan, they would be bumping uglies by now” Bucky said nudging Steve. “Wanna bet” Clint joined the conversation out of nowhere, which was less freaky after getting to know him now. “No,” Steve said.  “Bet what?” Nat asked as they entered the lift, completely ignoring him. “10 Dollars, that Steve and Tony will be an Item for Christmas” Clint smirked. “Make 20 for Valentine. Because this is between two Drama queens” Bucky said, ruffling his hair.
Thought about leaving this as a one shot but love this too much just let it collect metaphorical dust in my folders... do leave kudos and comments guys... ❤❤🤞
Upstairs, Tony was on a high. He just won another award, which he passed it on to the fake Caesar. The board got off his back and he had another beautiful woman hanging off his arm now. But something wasn’t right. Was there something in the drink? He questioned himself. “Hmm, What is going on, in that genius brain of yours?” the blonde asked, now in… when did they make it to his bedroom? he thought shaking his head. “Uh… nothing. Um…” he squinted his eyes at the woman and saw Stephanie. That was weird, he tried to remember if he had taken his so-called wife with him to… where did he go again? He shook his head more,  getting soberer over time.
“Ah, home sweet home” Stark said, walking into the mansion. The living room was an open floor plan with floor-to-ceiling windows. Stephanie walked in behind him, in awe at the view. He made his way to the bar on one side of the room and made himself a drink, as men brought in their luggage. “So here is the deal,” he said, nursing a drink. “See, the board members of my company think that I am too eccentric, and I think it’s just bullshit. So, we are doing this little stunt, where I act all responsible with you next to me for 3 months. You can go wherever you want and do whatever or do whoever you want, don’t get caught though. Then the stunt could end in less than three months. All your mom’s expenses have been taken care of and after this is over, I’ll pay you too.” He rambled, sauntering over to the couch. She gritted her teeth and resisted the urge to punch him.
He moved on to his other hand, wrapping it as well as he could, then planted his feet in the ground and waited for JARVIS to respond.
Tony got a sense of a shrug and exasperation from the brown dragon.  "I'll look after him," the brown dragon said before flying off as well.
"Yes and no," Bruce said, absently passing Steve a protein bar, which Steve accepted with good nature.  "He's...  Do you think he's the type to just give up on something if he wasn't interested anymore?"
"Not the time to be getting fresh, Stark," Steve said, though he wasn't disapproving like Tony expected him to be.
Steve took a deep breath.  "Can I see the Iron Man suits?"  He knew Tony had more than one.  He needed to see it again.
The glow stopped as Steve waited.  It was everything Tony had ever wanted.  He'd still have the heart pump, but his heart would work properly.  No more worries about it giving out or the pump malfunctioning.  He had searched for years to find a cure and even the orichalcum would work for maybe ten years, but probably only five the way he pushed it.  He didn't have to charge it anymore, but that didn't mean it wouldn't one day stop.  What Steve offered was almost a normal life.
Later after Jarvis kicked him out of the workshop to get more of the rest that he feared, Tony lounged on deck, looking through the folder again, the crystal from the cavern ceiling warm in his pocket.  He had the contents memorized by now, but that didn't make them familiar in the ways it should be.  For someone he supposedly met several times and helped become a super soldier, Tony had absolutely no recollection of it happening.
"I know," Steve said, sighing softly as Tony scratched behind his horn.  "We both have reservations about it.  But I'm glad it's you."
Tony closed the data stream, rubbing his eyes.  He didn't even have a physical body right now, but he was exhausted by everything going on.  Kids.  Even computer programs were exhausted dealing with kids.
He closed his eyes, leaning forward until his forehead touched Rhodey's shoulder.  Rhodey was surprised at first, then he brought his arms around Tony for a proper hug.  It wasn't the same as having a dragon curled around him, but it was nice.  Warm.  "Come on," Rhodey said, keeping an arm around him as he herded Tony below deck.  "Let's go down to your cabin and you can tell me."
Susan flinched.  Something must have happened that she hadn't told them.  Before he could move closer to her, Cap put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed it reassuringly.
"The spies have been released," Doom interrupted.  "Though they would not accept my offer of transport, so they will take longer to arrive.  They have been treated better than Fury's spies deserve."
Tony threw his arms around Steve's neck, giving the dragon what warmth he could.  Steve curled around him, cold cheek rubbing against Tony's warm one.  His headache faded to a manageable level; he suspected it was Steve's influence.
"He's a dumb ass too sometimes," Sam said with open amusement.  "But Steve is also special.  You know that, right?"
"I know," Steve said, trying to keep his voice light, but failing.  "Tony, these feelings are not your fault.  They aren't always logical."
Steve winced.  That was the exact opposite of the reason he and the other Avengers were here tonight, and now people were staring.  Still, at least it was him and not Natasha attracting the creepers tonight.  Natasha took entirely too much pleasure in leading creepy men off and doing things that made Steve shudder to think of, and Tony had asked them all to play nicely tonight.
He was looking at Tony now and he wasn't sure what to do with the scrutiny now that he had it.  "Just thinking."
Steve almost held out hope that Iron Man would prove him wrong.  It was dashed when the armor's shoulders hunched over.  "That's what I thought," Steve said, picking up the punching bag and putting it in the bag recycler  Tony had made, then picking up a new bag and hanging it.
Tony didn't know what was going on or why Steve had a sudden change of heart, but Steve never let Tony be extravagant for his sake.  He never let Tony spend any money on him, outside of the team.  Steve would accept gifts from everyone else, but from Tony it felt like he was always holding back a wince.
He shot replusor blasts at the ceiling then banked hard to the left at the very last second, turning again to go back down before he hit the other wall.  The turn nearly caused him to black out, but he scrambled to remain conscious as he avoided the tangle of jaws that tried to snap at him.
Cap flushed, sighing as he rubbed his forehead.  "That doesn't make you useless," Cap said again.  "Give it some time and-"
Once he was out in the hall, he looked back to make sure Tony didn't follow him.  He leaned against the wall and tilted his head back until it hit with a soft thunk.  To have let Stark see that, of all people...  Steve hit his head again for good measure.
"Yup," Tony said, sighing as he hit the wrong block.  "Realized it was a mistake.  We're good to go.  Unless you're mad about the whole privacy thing, but I think I learned my lesson on that."
It was a sea of calming blue and white.  There was worry and anger in the distance, but the calm was stronger, enveloping him with a warmth that Tony could almost feel.  "Steve," he said, barely above a whisper.  "You gotta...  You have to get out."
"Leon, stand down," Steve ordered, turning towards the kid and letting it drop for now.  "Tony was stalling.  I asked him to."
Bruce stared at Clint's feet for a moment, but allowed it.  He then chuckled.  "The other guy can handle Stark's frustration.  It's me that can't handle his drive.  I don't know how he does it without collapsing from exhaustion.  Even I need breaks sometimes or it feels like my head will burst keeping up with him."
He heated up the muffins and made coffee for himself, electing to try the Kona as well.  Once that was set, he took the elevator to the penthouse.
Tony looked down, leaning over as best he could to get a better view.  "I think you're on to something," Tony said, following another small crack.  He was reminded again why he never wore the armor to explore.  That, and things ended up destroyed more often than not.
The move back to the Tower went smoothly.  Tony was moved to the penthouse which Pepper granted everyone access to, even if it was really only her and Steve at the moment.
"So you what - take the emotional super-serum and quit?" Tony asked.  "That's not what I wanted, Steve."
The other Avengers had been very welcoming of Tony, even better than Steve had hoped.  But that didn't mean Tony was necessarily ready for this, and he could see how scared Tony was even though he tried to hide it.  "If you're not ready..."
"That's why you don't mind the cold so much?" Tony asked, feeling oddly hopeful.  Steve going to the surface would be a monumentally bad idea considering humanity's current problems, but maybe one day...
He was going to die, and quickly.  The thought terrified him.  After all this time, it wasn't his heart that would kill him.  Just the cold and the dark that was creeping back as the small crystal lost its light.
"Not yet.  Either sending things back in time creates a second, different universe, or sending it back in time will change things.  Either way, it's been eight times that it hasn't worked," Tony said.  "The future mes, they all still died.  They just tried to make sure we'd get it right eventually."
Steve leaned against the table, half sitting on it as he watched Tony.  He really hoped it wasn't the alternative universe theory.  He didn't like to think of eight different Tonys dying to save him.
Steve was silent on the end of the line, and Tony knew he couldn't argue with that.  "This is right, Steve, and you know it," Tony said, setting the bomb that would level the battlefield and give the kids time to get out.
talking about these things either.  "But if you hadn't noticed, we have a system.  You give me a pretty fair warning when you're getting bad, and I either leave you alone or try to tough it out.  You stop when I tell you to.  You usually apologize after, too."
Steve ran a hand through his sweat soaked hair.  The fight hadn't even gone like that, he reminded himself firmly.  He hadn't hurt Iron Man.  Hell, he didn't think he could actually dent the armor in real life.  Stark made sure the metal was the strongest he could make.  But he had
Steve was, in fact, sitting next to Iron Man, making sure they were back to back.  The bushes pricked at his side, but he ignored it and took a bite of his hot dog.
He hung up and wondered how Tony would take the news.  He texted Natasha to let her know and ask if there was any news from Iron Man, then found his escort to inquire where Tony was.
"No one here," he said, walking forward.  As he moved closer, the moss lantern's light filled the room.  The red object turned out to be a skull of some kind.
That didn't make him feel better, but Peggy gave him one last tail hug before letting him go and nudging him closer to Wanda.  "Go.  We'll look after Steve and the city while you're gone.  If Wanda wishes to show you something, you would be wise to go with her."
The Avengers alarm went off before Tony could finish, and Steve cursed silently as he scrambled to his feet.  "Do
The mural itself was carved in the stone, the color painted on the sinuous mineral curves.  The dragons in the picture were fighting men, and Tony traced a painted spear thoughtfully.  The armor the men wore looked like it couldn't be too far from when humans stopped hanging out in the trees.  That didn't make the weapons any less deadly, however.  Tony always had a healthy respect for weapons made by people who killed to survive every day, and they appeared to be working exceedingly well against creatures twice the size of humans.
Tony nodded and Steve let go of his wrist.  He took a deep breath to steel himself.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  "You're popular with the butterflies," Steve said to stall a little, just enough to give him time to figure out what to say.
Sighing, Steve kept a tight hold on his fury as he counted in his head.  His hand tightened around Tony's wrists, tight enough to bruise before he realized and automatically loosened his grip.  The shame at that more than anything calmed him down.  Tony didn't even wince at what no doubt had to be painful.  "Tony," Steve said, his voice more raw than he liked, but he pushed on anyway.  "What's going on? Is it Doom?"
"I give," Sam said, and Steve rolled off him.  "Damn, I thought you were gonna let me win that one."
Tony immediately ruined Steve's work by tensing again.  He could feel Steve glancing along his code and pulling back when he realized Susan was talking to him.  Steve was ever so uptight when it came to privacy.  "Something wrong?" he asked, making a note to high five her for her sass later.
Tony looked behind him as Steve whined softly.  He turned in Steve's arms, biting his lip in worry.  "What's wrong?" he asked.  If Steve had a reaction headache from over indulging in the link, it wasn't bad enough Tony could feel it.
It was a warning, not a rejection, Steve told himself.  A tightly controlled warning.  Whatever Steve had done, whatever wire he'd tripped, it sent Tony spiraling in a bad way and this was his warning to get out before things got bad and Tony got defensive.  A small part of him was proud of Tony's progress.  But mostly he was floored by guilt because Tony had sounded
Iron Man was quiet for a long time.  The face plate was blank, so Steve didn't know what to make of the silence broken only by the low hum of the arc reactor.  Then he nodded with a short, jerky motion at odds with the usually graceful armor.  "I... Okay.  I'll let him know."
A hand on his forehead caused him to startle, but the binding kept him from doing anything worse than making his head hurt more.  "These are withdrawal symptoms, my friend," Thor said, his voice low and soothing as he moved his fingers through Tony's hair.  "It was a while before we could track the Red Skull down and the Midgardian drugs have a strong hold on you, but the doctors assure us they will pass."
She grunted in pain and rolled, but before she could fire at him again, the room brightened.  There was a slow clapping.
"And you won't," Tony promised, fondness entering his eyes as he watched Steve.  "But we do have a lot of free time now that the twins are taking over monitoring Susan..."
enough.  He had Iron Man's trust, which meant as much as his love, friendly or otherwise.  So Steve ate his hot dogs and leaned against the solid and steady back of Iron Man's shoulders.  When he heard the mechanical sound again, he summoned up the best smile he could.  "Finished already, Shellhead?"
"You probably could," Tony replied absently, but he leaned in instead of away, allowing the touch.  "You're better at adapting than anyone I know."
The movie was fun, and Steve was charmed by how far Willow was willing to go for the baby.  It wasn't twenty minutes into the movie before he felt hard metal against his shoulder.  He looked over to see Iron Man's head against his shoulder.  The normally blue lights where his eyes would be were flicked off.
Steve didn't know how to respond to that, so he nodded.  He had enough food for thought to last him for a while in the very least.
"Then I think I may have a solution," Thor said.  "I brought some Asgardian mead with me on my last trip home, if you care to test your mettle against it."
Steve's opponent took her helmet off, her dark skin slicked with sweat and her straightened hair pulled back into a tight bun.  Her face was more gaunt and weary than when Steve had first seen her, but at least she has been sleeping better since Tony got their current base fully operational.  She glared at Tony, who only grinned wider.  "It was eight minutes," Susan said.  "And counting."
"Hammer's alliance with Vanko," she said, shaking her head.  "The agent in charge of Vanko's file said he would be easily controlled by Justin Hammer and it turned out to be the other way around.  It was a mortal error on his part.  I was ordered to blow my cover and save civilians."
"Why?  You want me to tell you everything just so you can tell me how crazy I am?"  Bitterness wrapped around him like ice.
"He's not a pet!"  Tony's head whipped up to glare at her, anger taking over the guilt.  "You're not-"
"Mr. Stark, you shouldn't just head straight down to the workshop," Pepper said, her hands on her hips as he started to unload the equipment from the ship.  He needed to get a proper look at the Rescue armor, because something about the aerodynamics was off.
He felt Steve's anger and shame, though he couldn't tell who it was aimed at, himself or Steve.  Tony swallowed, then let the repulsor power up.  "
It had none of the bright paint and colors that the dragon buildings did, or even the colors and patterns Tony had come to expect from this side of the world.  It was all the same dark, strange metal, with a rust the color of dried blood that creeped up the walls.  "Pleasant place," Tony muttered, feeling Steve's unease as well as his own.
"Where?" Susan snapped, pulling at the chains that bound Leo to the wall.  They came off with a satisfying clunk.  Leo slumped forward into her arms, and she laid him gently on the bench.
"Hm, it'd be good press," Tony admitted.  "I can put together a new line and that might shame some of those Hollywood execs.  Jan, you could help design some of it."
"What do you mean, 'even if I don't return your feelings'?" Tony asked, looking more upset than Steve expected.
"Why didn't you tell me it was Tony?" Steve asked, some of his anger abating.  One day Fury would figure out it was Pepper in the suit, and he would love to see the man's face when he realized it, but Steve was hopefully not going to be the one to tell him.  He certainly wasn't going to offer up the information.  Fury raised an eyebrow but didn't press further at Steve's change of subject.
caves.  He blinked, seeing Yinsen's face in the darkness as helplessness washed over him.  Steve's voice was a gentle litany in his ear as he calmed down though, grounding him in the present.  It was weird, and Tony held on to that strangeness as his heart beat slowed.
