“You need to breathe Tony.”
On the first December 16th after his parents die, seven months after his eighteenth birthday, Tony Stark wakes up to snow.
Tony kisses him, effectively cutting him off.
Tony releases a breath, curling his hands into fists and then relaxing them.
It’s a female voice speaking now. She sounds nervous.
“Let go of him.”
he thinks that, but she looks terrifying, and he
he had imagined himself whispering time and time again after everything.
“Okay.” Tony says quietly, burying his head in Steve’s chest and taking a deep, shuddering breath. “Okay.”
“Jesus Tony-”
him.”
“Steve?”
He just wants to take whatever pain is lingering in his eyes away, but he’s not really sure how to. Tony’s never been the most open, and he respects that he has his secrets, but sometimes… sometimes he wishes he could just read his mind.
There’s still a lingering worry he can see in Tony’s eyes, and he knows that this problem won’t be easily solved.
“I’m well aware of what he did, I was there.” He snaps, and instantly regrets it because Rhodey has been
Tony glances at the fountain again, and it looks normal now, calm and functional and
He feels restless, and makes his way to the kitchen, taking out a coffee mug with a little more force than necessary.
After two days, he had felt on edge, jumpy in his own skin. All it had taken was Howard having one two many drinks and a bad day at work, and on the third day, Tony had locked himself in the bathroom for an hour, and thrown up everything in his stomach.
“That’s what it says here.” Rhodey agrees, taking a closer look at the english description of it. “It’s actually really cool-”
He flinches, spinning around and relaxing as he sees Rhodey. The feeling of unease that had accompanied seeing the jar vanishes.
Steve watches Tony take the drink, hands steady.
“Why? You interested?”
“Nope.”
“Steve,” Nat says quietly, and Steve blinks away the haze of
But yet even now, even a year after seeing that video, he still falls asleep most nights with his mother’s screams echoing in his ears.
“You should’ve just let him do it.” He whispers, and then he’s just crying, crying in a way he hasn’t in years. He can’t breathe, but the rain is a constant around them, washing away everything else. Washing away the fear, the pain, the tears, everything.
“Tony.”
Tony laughs, and it’s humourless. “Don’t bullshit me. I’m going and risking my life to decode information for you. I’ll know more than anyone here by the end of this. I want all the facts, don’t pretend to be protecting me here.”
“You’re late Rogers.”
“A movie.”
Silence.
Ty. Who’s Ty? Someone from Tony’s past, evidently. And if Rhodey dislikes him, he’s guessing Tony does too, and there’s a good reason.
“Someone thinks rather highly of himself.” Steve says with a laugh, watching Tony stand and walk over to the kitchen to make some more coffee.
“I love you. I’ve been in love with you for the best part of two years, ever since you told me that you like jazz and smiled at me with those beautiful, beautiful, stupidly irresistibly blue eyes. So don’t insult me by not believing me.”
“Just what he said to you before. Finish it off
He flashes her a smile and a glare at the same time, and she just grins back, slipping into a seat next to him. Despite everything, Tony feels himself relax slightly. “Full of surprises. Though I’m not sure
No what he
Compartmentalise. He’s always been good at that. Breathe. Wait. Breathe again. The grief can't catch him unaware now, he can feel it simmering and burning and
For a second, no one speaks. Then Obie laughs quietly, slinging an arm around Tony’s shoulders. He doesn’t flinch, forces himself not to as the man speaks, too close.
Steve doesn’t answer this, only shakes his head.
He’s fine. It’s fine-
“Tell me the truth.”
“He-” Steve swallows hard. “He said that you hadn’t managed to finish it off...this time.”
They’re sitting around one of the booths in the corner, and Nat has her arms folded, which means it’s totally pointless to argue, except he’s much too stubborn to drop it now.
The only people who have a key to his apartment other than him are Rhodey, because he trusts him, and Obie, because Howard had said so, and it hadn’t been a tone that promoted a lot of argument.
His hands are shaking as he runs them over the drawing, looking at what’s written at the bottom in Steve’s slanting writing.
“Rhodey.” He says again, tone low with warning. He doesn’t want to bring it all up with Steve again, but he can’t quite bring himself to feel fully guilty about letting Rhodey lay into him.
He rolls his eyes, taking another turn.
“Clint?”
“What?”
“Maybe you are.” Tony says, barely louder than a whisper, and Steve can feel his breath tickling his neck where he’s tucked against him. Tony is the perfect size for dancing, small enough that he just
Tony is a solid weight on his chest, a warmth that he can’t feel. He doesn’t remember falling asleep, but it happens at some point, slowly, then all at once.
Interrupting Pepper Potts hasn’t historically been good for his health, but right now he doesn’t care.
Tony half smiles. The grief is there, waiting to pounce. The anger is simmering under his skin, ebbing and flowing. But Steve is here, and he’s the constant. He’s always been the constant, his anchor.
Steve stands. “One more thing.”
“Natalie.” He steps in before this drags out for longer than necessary. “No offence but… What are you doing here?”
Tony blushes, mouth curling into a small smile, and it’s one of the first times Steve has seen him blush, and a humming sort of pleasure comes to life in his chest.
“And then?”
If that means taking one fucking day off from classes, you’re going to take that day, even if I literally have to tie you to the bed myself.”
He glances at the bartender. He’s talking to someone else. Tony lowers his voice anyway. He’s not quite drunk enough to abandon caution, not tonight, not yet. And trust Steve to bring up the one thing that he really wants to avoid talking about right now.
There’s silence, and he can imagine the look on her face right now, a mix between pitying and sad.
Natasha pulls the paper out of his hand and starts to flip through it as information comes to life on the screen before them. Seconds later, Fury starts to talk.
Tony doesn’t seem fazed, but the grip he has on Steve’s hand tightens a little.
Tony shrugs, grin sharpening. “Like I said. Can’t rush perfection darling. Relax. It’s going to be fine.”
“You first.”
“He threw his lunch at your fucking head.” Tony snaps. He doesn’t know why today is the one where he’s feeling flashes of an almost uncontrollable temper, but at the moment he’s not bothering to keep it in check. “He’s been bitching all day. Can’t he just back off?”
Steve nods silently, keeping up barely with the speed at which Tony’s brain is moving right now. He isn’t sure how to deal with Tony like this, the choreographed hurricane that he turns into, and the single and unrelenting focus in his eyes.
“Yep.”
“Hi.”
“Yes?”
He doesn’t know why his voice is edged with sarcasm, doesn’t know why he’s suddenly getting an instinct to put up his walls and
Obadiah Stane had been reported as dead not even a week after being transferred to one of SHIELD’s high security prisons. Apparently, the man had an uncanny ability to make enemies everywhere he went. Steve had seen the relief in Tony’s eyes when he had heard the news, the relief and the tiny shimmer of regret, because maybe there would always be a part of the genius that cared for Obadiah.
“What do you mean?” Steve says carefully, taking a sip of the whiskey.
talk about his job at SHIELD, or the fact that he secretly runs a billion dollar company under a name that he hasn’t used for his entire life.
Steve.
Natasha, as always, reacts the fastest.
He shuts his eyes, shaking his head to clear it. He doesn’t need anything else to make an appearance in his dreams, least of all this.
He heads down the street, taking a shortcut to the left because if he’s going to be wandering around New York at 11pm to find junk food, he’s not doing it for longer than necessary.
that monster wants for
He can’t leave, because Obie knows about Steve.
“Tony may have let you back in here, but that doesn’t mean I, or anyone else, has forgotten what you did.”
Ty grins, pulling back slightly.
He doesn’t remember falling, but he’s on the floor, pulling his knees up to his chest, trying desperately to catch his breath. Steve’s hoodie, Steve’s smile, Steve-
“What?”
Tony places the drink down carefully, and smiles. It’s humourless, sharp. Deadly.
“I’m sorry, for judging him.”
“Come over?”
“No. What he needs is for you to
“I’m going to be fine love. Just worry about yourself. You don’t need to worry about me.”
“She used to take me sometimes if Dad was away working. It’s peaceful.”
Steve still isn’t sure how they got onto the subject of dancing, but they’re here now, and Tony is leaning against one of the kitchen surfaces, glass of water in one hand. Steve watches as he reaches into the cupboard with the other, grabbing one of Nat’s secret stash of cookies that she keeps hidden.
Obadiah, the one who sat back and let Howard Stark hit a
Seemingly satisfied with his answer, Steve smiles, kissing him again. He looks like Tony feels, like he could stay kissing him forever.

why the media’s favourite nickname for Tony Stark is the Merchant of Death, weapons selling or not.
There’s a silky soft laugh, and it makes Steve want to break something, because he sees Tony flinch slightly at the sound, despite the bravado in his words.
also works. He meets his eyes (eye) and tries to look as innocent as possible.
He’s pushing back against an onslaught of memories. Ty’s mocking smile, Ty’s hands all over him, Ty’s laugh that still plays in his nightmares.
“Okay. Okay good, that’s- that’s so good.”
“You've never expressed that interest in class before. Why now?”
“He was not
Something Rhodey had said once drifts back to him.
He stares at his friend, shaking his head and biting back a small smile.
“it’s a good view.” Steve says quietly, nodding towards the lake.
“Maybe I’m just full of surprises.” Steve says softly, because this song is a soft song, and Tony’s hand on his waist is gentle, and he thinks he’s imagining it, but it feels like Tony’s thumb is brushing over his palm.
“Yeah.” Peter agrees, going back to fiddling with the hair thin wires in front of him. “Oh.”
“Who did this to you?”
he’s been given. No, nothing good could come of being around Tony.
The eye of his teacher that he can see is dark. “I get the sense you’re not that sorry at all Mr Stark, but just don’t let it happen again.”
“Maybe. It’s comfortable.”
Tony reacts to this, and Steve feels his hands clench a little tighter around the fabric of his shirt, a small sound forcing its way out of his throat.
“New year won’t
He doesn’t say that.
he hadn’t expected. He guesses it will teach him to trust what he reads on Google.
He’s asking for one of Steve’s hoodies next time he’s away with his parents.
Steve’s face lights up as he sees him, a slight blush rising on his cheeks.
“Yes actually. Go and play nice with Ty Stone. His father is hours away from agreeing to a business deal, and I need them on side.”
“Oh I’ve been wondering, how’s your coffee boy doing?”
Steve truly,
But he sees it click, sees it piece together in Steve’s eyes because he’s not stupid, he’s so far from stupid, and Tony’s face is still bruised. He wonders if Steve has known for a while, since even before the bruises and their conversation in the coffee shop, but just didn’t want to believe it.
. He allows himself to be pulled into a hug, burying his face in the crook of Steve’s neck and just breathing him in. It’s so warm, he’s so warm, and Tony doesn’t really know when this happened, this desperate need for someone to tell him that it’s okay, and that
When he gets back to Rhodey, the tour guide is still droning on.
He can hear his heartbeat, steady and strong.
If he tells Fury it’s because he had a weird feeling that he could read the markings, he’ll probably get sent to the school counsellor.
Tony smirks, taking a sip of his coffee.
Peter huffs, folding his arms and returning his attention to his project. “No. But I heard Fury telling the Captain you were out when he came looking for you.
He needs Steve
Tony sees the confusion on Steve’s face, ignores it. He forces his tone smooth out, forces his smile to sharpen.
Steve reaches out, gently taking Tony’s hands in his own, and he looks up, question in his eyes. Steve's expression is hesitant, a little sad.
He realises that they’ve gotten all the way to Happy’s car, and slides into the backseat, because he’s really not in the mood for small talk today.
“Yeah?”
“Tony we’re gonna be late!”
, whether you like it or not, however many times you hide behind different masks and names and identities. You retain the same level of IQ, even if you’re a little too good at pretending otherwise.”
like to go out again. And then again, and again.”
“You love me.” Tony says again, quiet and disbelieving. Steve leans down and kisses him again because how can he not, and then again.
Just a boy.
“No. Yes. They’re coming this weekend. Want to have dinner. Obie's booking me into a hotel.”
He never wants to let go; never wants to stop kissing him like this.
Obadiah raises his eyebrows. “That’s all you came here to say?”
Tony smiles, and it’s worth everything.
He hadn’t thought he’d ever be one for physical contact, not after everything. But here they are, and Tony is more relaxed than he’s been in a long while.
Tony shrugs, playing with a strand of Steve’s hair, and shifting his gaze away. His forearm is covered in bruises today, but the long sleeves cover it completely.
Rhodey laughs, rolling his eyes. “Of course you did. Your attention span is worse than mine man. Why did you come over here?”
“I'm sorry.” Steve says quietly, feeling the burn of tears in his eyes, and he blinks them back. “Tony, baby, just-”
Steve can see Tony searching her gaze, and then he leans back in his chair, narrowing his eyes, smile fading.
Steve laughs, and it makes Tony feel stupidly warm which is dumb so of course he completely ignores it.
“You’re late.” Snaps Nick Fury, and Tony feels a flicker of annoyance before he shoves it away, pulling out a chair.
The drinking gets worse for a while, worse than when he'd come back from Siberia. Tony know's Rhodey is scared, he can hear it in his voice every time he talks to him. But then it gets better
“I only wish you’d consider my offer Tony. You were a real asset to the company. I know I made a mistake-“
That’s the last thing he wants, ever.
“That’s really none of your fucking business is it?”
His father tells him that, tells him whenever one of his many masks slips slightly. Most people spend their lives trying to see beyond the armour, if they ever realise it’s not the real him. Howard has spent his life making sure no one sees anything other than what he wants them to.
Tony flips her off without looking, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder and closing his eyes. Steve’s arms wrap a little more securely around him.
Sam, his boss and also one of his best friends, is leaning against the wall next to the staff entrance when Steve pushes open the door and tries not to wince as it slams behind him. Sam’s arms are folded across his chest, and he looks like he’s trying to be serious.
Steve, the one person who he wants to keep away from this goddamn snake pit of a life.
“Thank you. For coming when you did.”
He turns around (even though he already knows who it is, because his voice still gives him nightmares) and Tiberius Stone smiles.
He spots Rhodey across the room instantly, still at the bar, and makes a beeline towards him.
“You climbed into bed with him three years ago, don’t be dramatic.”
He’s twisting his fingers together, wondering how much to say, wondering just how much to talk about because Steve has just saved him from his nightmare-
But Maria was.
He pushes that out of his mind, because he hates them, and Tony is buying him dinner somewhere he could never
Tony smiles at him, and it’s bright and warm and so
“Maybe.”
He can only see half his face in the drawing, and his eyes are wide, dark. Then as his eyes move over the page, he takes in the rest of the drawing.
Hope you liked this! If anyone wants to come and yell at me, my instagram and tumblr are @wordsxstars. Thank you for the support on this!
“You’re happy.” Steve says quietly, and Tony lifts his head, eyes bright.
“He-”
Tony wakes up first the next morning, slipping out of bed and grabbing a clean t-shirt, Steve’s hoodie, and pants. Then he goes to make coffee.
of all times, but then again, maybe he does.
He wants Steve, he just wants to call Steve.
that still hurts like hell.
“Hey sweetheart.”
“Sorry for just… turning up.”
Rhodey hangs up, and Steve turns to Natasha.
It’s freezing again, but he knows he put the heating on yesterday.
“Don’t.” He mutters. “Tones come on. He’s just an asshole.”
Next, it’s shock.
“Hey!”
Tony ignores her as Fury raises his eyebrows.
He meets his eyes, releasing the breath slowly. The anger has vanished, the will to push him away has vanished. He doesn’t care, he doesn’t. But he can’t have Steve looking at him with pity, he
Tony rolls his eyes with a smile, lacing their hands together. “Yeah, okay. Promise.”
Eventually, the sun dips behind the water, and it’s only once they’re back in the car that Tony realises he feels lighter.
Steve coughs, flushing bright red, and Tony takes his hand away before he can even blink. He’s leaning back slightly in his chair now, and Steve can see that every line of his body is a little more tense, even though his tone is even.
“Right.”
at him to run. He feels light, dizzy. The world is still spinning.
“Don’t be dramatic love, I’ll be fast.”
time. But I don't know that for sure.”
The universe hates him, it’s fine.
There are bruises on his arm now, he ignores them. He can wear long sleeves tomorrow, it’s fine.
“You know my schedule now kid?”
“Hey Pep-”
A second later he’s gone, and when Steve turns around, Nat is behind him, staring at him with an open mouth.
Steve changes the subject, because despite the lightness of Tony’s tone, he can see something a little darker in his gaze that hadn’t been there a minute ago.
Maybe it’s something.
“Tony!”
Something in him drifts slowly back to consciousness.
Tony smiles again, but there’s no humour in it. “I’m aware. But it’s what I enjoy doing.”
Steve breathes out, shoulders dropping in relief.
SI tech is are anything to go by.
“So I’m supposed to just be
“That’s not my problem.” Tony says, pulling open the door.
“Whatever you say.”
He doesn’t know how long they stand there for, but it’s long enough.
Tony nods, picking his sweatshirt off the back of the chair. He feels bad for whoever ends up going with the Captain on that one. His missions aren’t exactly
He wants a fucking drink, and he wants Rhodey, and he wants Steve to call so he can go on the stupid date with the stupid barista, and most of all he wants to run, and get out of this den of shadows that he’s trapped in.
“Your little boy toy can wait outside.”
He sees Howard’s gaze wander around the apartment, and realises too late that the two empty mugs of coffee are still on the table.
“What can I do?” He says eventually, because there’s no point trying to understand all of it.
“Kiss me,” Tony says quietly, reaching up and trailing his fingers over Steve’s face, over his lips. “Just kiss me, okay?”
He lifts his chin, not looking at Obie, and walks back into the room.
Steve clears his throat. “What can I get you?”
“Just, I know I wasn’t very good at-”
He knows it’s not a threat, and it’s just Steve asking a question, but a tiny flicker of fear runs through him all the same. He squashes it fast.
Maybe it’s everything.
, and yet so innocent at the same time. He grabs Steve’s hand, eyes bright. “I have absolutely nothing better to do than this.”
After a lot of swearing and shoving, they finally break through to the spot the others have saved. It’s close to the front, but still surrounded by people.
“This is Tony Stark.”
“I figured out, over the last two years,” Tony whispers against his lips, because he feels brave now, and he feels light and happy. It's cold, but Steve is warm. “That it’s a hell of a lot easier to love you than to hate you.”
But now, as Tony Stark sits before him, burns dancing up the side of his face like a darker form of an artwork he never wanted to see, he thinks he understands.
“I’m keeping the hoodie until you get back.”
He sighs heavily, tugging his jacket tighter around himself and shoving his hands into the pockets.
“Parents.” It's the only explanation he needs to give.
And now Steve is smiling again, ducking his head slightly to hide the fact that he’s grinning like an idiot.
The waitress brings their drinks, and Howard gives him a look that says everything when he takes the full glass Obadiah hands to him. It’s like standing on hot coals with the two of them. Please one, piss off the other. Frankly, he isn’t sure which is worse anymore.
“Your hard drive is fucked, so your work might not be saving properly. I can probably fix it.”
Deafening silence.
“Yeah no shit.” His friend sighs, glancing at Ty before looking back to Tony. “I’m just worried about you.”
Tony smiles a little, pulling a blanket over him, and Steve’s eyes slip shut.
sounds happy.
“I’ve got a meeting in half an hour. Hurry the hell up.”
And Steve is shouting now, taking a step closer. “You were a goddamn kid Tony, and no one did anything, and your dad was-
“Never, Okay? That’s never an option. We can figure this out, and there’s always another option that isn't giving in to them.”
Steve steps back, letting him get back into his room. Tony hears him go into the kitchen a minute later. He feels like he needs to take a shower. Three showers, and then another. When he pulls his shirt off, there are twin bruises on his hips. There’s a faint memory somewhere, a memory of someone gripping too hard. The rest is logic.
with hiding from Steve. “You wanted to talk?”
Steve says, and suddenly his anxiety levels have rocketed up, “I’m guessing you don’t make a habit of going to nice or important places underdressed?”
Nothing Obie wants to talk to him about can be good, and he’s learned to trust the sinking feeling in his stomach over the years.
“Aren’t you supposed to be leaving?”
His phone is still in his hand.
Peter grins at him, and it’s shit eating. “You’re a mechanic. The Captain is the most talented agent SHIELD has, an assassin, and the legends say he’s probably a demigod.”
His ribs are aching, his head is aching, and he’s never wanted coffee more in his life.
“Steve?” Tony's voice is tinged with worry now, and god he doesn’t want to worry him, that’s the last thing he's
It’s not
He doesn’t remember the last time someone actually asked that question, actually put it into words and asked it and wanted to know the answer.
Maybe it’s something.
Steve feels his cheeks heat up and ducks his head slightly, because now is a
They get into the car, Obie takes his hand off his back, and the drive passes in a blur.
Tony whispers it back to him, over and over again as the music plays on, and then kisses him hard, relaxing into his arms.
“Rhodes.” Fury’s voice is a little harder now.
“What happened?” Tony says, and his voice is empty, because he knows, he knows but-
Two weeks later, Steve asks him to come and see an exhibition that some of his art is in. Tony doesn’t hesitate before saying yes, calling Pepper and asking her to cancel whatever meetings he has on his calendar.
“I've been good.” He says with a half smile, dragging his finger around the rim of his glass absentmindedly. “Teaching’s going well. You’d be surprised at how many of these kids are actually a lot smarter than they look.”
him.”
Ty laughs, and Steve’s skin crawls as he reaches out and brushes a strand of hair out of Tony’s face. Tony jerks his head away, eyes fluttering shut again, and Steve’s stomach lurches.
“Okay,” he whispers, kissing him. “Thank you, thank you so much I-”
“Excellent. It would be a shame to waste time, so I’ll get straight to the point.”
Ty smiles again, and Tony swallows down bile. Not here, not now, even though he can feel the panic crawling up his throat, clawing at his skin.
the look on his face.
The bartender pours him one, and then tops it up on request. He probably drinks it faster than he should, but he doesn’t care right now.
“Of course it matters. Tell me, or I’ll go off my own assumptions and guesswork.”
“You remembered.” Steve says quietly as Frank Sinatra sings, and some restless part of him that had never known what it’s like to have Tony Stark in his arms settles into sleep.
He won’t leave Tony alone.
“What are you, their messenger now?” He can hear his own voice, and it sounds scared. It sounds young, despite how hard he’s trying to keep it neutral.
He’s not even gay. Also, I don’t know him. I don’t even know how
“I trusted him.” Says Tony faintly, staring at the screen. He’s pale, Steve notices, and reaches out to take his hand, gently winding their fingers together. “I fucking trusted him. I hated him, but trusted him.”
“It’s not often I get to meet anyone Tony works with.” Obadiah says with a laugh. “So it’s my pleasure.”
with his experiments. He keeps smiling, even though he feels sick. Throughout it all, Obie remains at his side, hand resting on his arm. As if he would risk saying anything here. He hasn’t for the past ten years, there’s no reason to start now.
“I don’t believe you,” he says quietly, and Tony laughs, because he doesn’t know what else to do, he doesn’t know how to
Tony’s whole body is shaking, Steve can see that much.
He takes the subway to Steve’s place, keeping his sunglasses on and his hood up. He doesn’t get recognised, which is a relief, because he doesn’t have the energy for that today. When he gets there, he knocks once, trying to keep some sort of control over his expression.
Steve laughs a little, resisting the urge to kiss him
“I gathered, and I missed you too.” He says with a laugh, and Tony reaches up and gently kisses him again.
“I- Jesus Tony. That’s not why I like you. I like you because you’re funny and smart and I like being around you.”
Steve raises his eyebrows, glancing between his boyfriend and the computer. (Boyfriend. He isn’t sure if that word will ever stop making him smile.)
“Any time.” There’s a beat. “Also Steve, try not to run into Obadiah Stane.”
He opens his eyes, and Steve’s are so goddamn blue it makes his heart ache. His mother-
They’ve been best friends for years now. But for all Tony brags that it takes a lot to scare him, Rhodey has never had a problem sneaking up on him.
It doesn’t ease for a while.
“But what would be the fun in that?” Obie says with a smirk, nodding at Steve again. “Hope those bruises heal soon.”
For Steve, it had just been relief. He'd said as much, and that at least had made Tony smile.
Steve just stares at him, and it’s the look in his eyes that makes him want to grab him and kiss him, but also run and not stop running, because Obie and Howard goddamn know and now so does Ty.
“You’re late,” says Clint in a singsong voice, raising his eyebrows. They’re holding coffees, and Steve is torn between amusement and exasperation. “What do you have to say for yourself, hm?”
“I just wanted to- I know you don’t like opening up, not to anyone. But I’m here, no matter what, okay?”
He’d gone back to the stupid, tiny place again, and it hadn’t been for the coffee, (though it’s his favourite so far) but for the barista with the blue eyes.
“He’s your father.” Steve’s brows are furrowed, and a part of Tony wants to reach out, to smooth the worry from his face. Another part of him wants to keep laughing because it’s not funny but he feels almost delirious right now.
He hums as Steve readjusts their positions, and the warmth of his skin going all the way to Tony’s bones.
“Ti voglio bene,” [5] she says with a smile, and he murmurs it back because he does. He does love her, even though she has no idea about
He narrows his eyes with a laugh. “Why do I sense sarcasm Romanoff?”
“And you don’t?”
He glances at his phone. It’s 8 now, and he’s relieved, because it’s early November, and it’s getting a hell of a lot colder.
“Tony?”
“I haven’t had a lot of interactions with Hydra,” he starts, voice carrying in the silence, “only indirectly. I used to work for Obadiah Stane under the name of Carbonell, and there was… an issue about five years ago. Someone on the inside had sold weapons to an international terrorist group.” He nods towards the file still sitting on the table. “Hydra. I didn’t stay long enough to watch the consequences of that pan out.”
Dinner. His parents.
Tony lifts his shoulders into a shrug. “Twenty three actually.”
“You can do that?”
The doorbell rings.
Had he? He just remembers his phone vibrating with a text, and then the dread dropping into his stomach
“Tony.” He says quietly, reaching out and taking his hand. He ignores the pain, it doesn’t matter right now. “It’s not worth it.”
God, he can’t move, he can’t, he can’t-
“He hits you.” Steve whispers, and Tony forgets how to speak, forgets how to get air into his lungs. “Howard. Doesn’t he?”
He came in here because after the day, after the call, all he wanted to do was drink until he couldn’t remember what Obadiah’s shark smile looked like. They serve him in here; they always do, even when he doesn’t have his unconvincing fake ID with him. The lighting is dim, so he doesn’t expect to be recognised. He’s pulled it together since the call with Rhodey, but he feels almost vulnerable at the moment, even if he doesn’t look it.
Lies. All lies.
And then he’ll know that all he has to do to get Tony to stop fighting him on every tiny thing is go after Steve.
Steve lets out a shaky breath; forcing his hands to relax out of the fists he’d curled them into without realising. “Jesus.”
He knows he's been neglecting to do everything Howard and Obie expect from him, but he doesn't have the energy to care about them right now.
It’s not what Tony needs right now. Later, yes. Now? No.
But there’s no point dwelling on the past, not anymore.
But he does it, and hears Tony release a shaky breath.
Also, Tony had mentioned something about a movie night. So his motivation to get to class and then get
“Watch yourself Rogers.”
He makes a humming noise that passes for an answer, opening his eyes. The alleyway is still empty, thank god, because if he had to deal with the press and their opinion on Tony Stark having panic attacks at the age of 18-
that you can do to change that.”
Steve says goodnight to him once they get back, and apologies for intruding. Tony says he doesn’t mind, because he really doesn’t, and Steve's answering smile makes Tony smile back.
“Night,” he says, and for once, the noise in his head is quiet, because Steve’s eyes are so blue, and it’s dark, and his parents are far enough away that he can put them both out of his mind, if only for one evening.
He’s scared of what he knows.
Steve’s dressed differently this time, more normal clothing taking precedence over the SHIELD uniform.
There's snow on Tony's face, Steve brushes it away with his lips.
He hates this, hates that there’s a gap in his memory now. Something flickers in Steve’s eyes, but he’s not sure he wants to know why. Eventually, Steve shakes his head.
“No.”
Steve blinks, raising his eyebrows.
“I’m in love with you.” Steve blurts out, cutting off whatever he had been about to say. “I’m in love with you. So if you’re about to apologise for kissing me, please don’t.”
Tony has gone so so
“You told him?”
Steve grins. “Maybe. Just a tiny bit.”
Nat turns around, throwing her hands up in exasperation. “You’re both dumb. Glad you finally managed to get that one out Stark.”
“Yeah.” He says quietly, staring out of the window. He doesn’t like the blinds closed anymore, hasn’t for a while. It’s a childish fear, he knows. But he doesn’t care. If she was here, his mother would kiss him on the forehead, would smile that bright smile that always made him happier, would tell him that it’s fine to not like the dark, even at the age of eighteen.
a breaking point. There’s so much pain, so much loss. And yet he picks himself up every single time, without fail, and keeps going.
“Yeah baby,” he says quietly. “I promised, didn't I? Can you sit up for me?”
Tony’s lips curl into a smile. “You know I’m a literal billionaire, right?”
“Va tutto bene?” [8] Her voice sounds slightly concerned, and Tony’s throat tightens.
Some hard edge in Tony’s eyes softens at this, and Steve realises how tired he looks. Exhausted, worried.
“I don’t care,” and Steve’s voice is strong, calming. An anchor. “I don’t care what anyone says. I’m not letting you give everything up for me, okay? I’m not.”
“Hey.” Nat says, poking Steve in the shoulder. “Lover boys. I thought this was a
But at least Steve is safe.
He chokes out a laugh, closing his eyes as the panic releases its death grip on his chest, allowing his body to relax.
“That’s not what it looked like,” he says, and Steve’s voice is hard. He’s looking right into Tony’s eyes with a stubborn expression that even
His knees ache as they connect with the floor, waves of nausea rolling through him as he throws up whatever's left in his stomach. It’s from the alcohol, and whatever the
“It’s lovely to meet you too, miss?”
Steve feels a tiny flicker of bitterness at this, because Tony has grown up in a perfect life where he’s never
“GHB. The shit that Ty spiked my drink with. That’s what is was. I’ve had it before; it’s the same effects, especially with alcohol. It… I realised what it was too late.”
Eventually, Tony drifts off to sleep, but even unconscious there’s a shadow of a bone deep grief on his face. Steve shifts slightly, standing up, and gently lifting Tony, biting back a hiss of pain. He carries him through to the sofa, lying him down again and grabbing one of the blankets. As he goes to move away, Tony’s hand tightens around his shirt again.
“No offence Steve, but your boyfriend is an asshole.”
When they pull away, Steve is smiling, and blushing, and
He hangs up, turning back to Steve. “They’ll want a press conference soon. Pepper is on it, but can only hold off for so long. I’ve got to remind the shareholders who exactly is in charge, and that it’s not Obadiah Stane. But that can wait a day.”
Fury. I wiped them out five years ago.”
“Thanks, for fixing this for me.”
“Tell him then. He won’t give two shits and you know it.”
So instead he pulls Tony closer and kisses him hard, harder than before, hoping that he can help him to forget whatever demons he’s managed to find himself caught up with.
“Sir he wasn’t-”
There is a beat of silence, and when he looks at Tony again, he’s wearing a slightly guilty, yet woefully unapologetic smile. Steve raises his eyebrows, smiling slightly just because Tony is smiling, and its goddamn infectious.
It’s not the work phone.
Tony closes his eyes, forcing himself to relax. It’s a name, just a name. The fact that Fury’s blackmailing him into revealing it doesn’t matter. The fact that the only people on the planet who know who he really is are Fury and Nat doesn’t matter. Even Obadiah doesn’t know.
Obadiah is late, and honestly Tony isn’t surprised. It’s the only thing he can rely on about the whole situation that he’s finding himself in increasingly often.
“Hello?”
and he wants Steve more than he wants to
“Okay,” Steve says, and then a little more firmly. “Okay. Just be careful.”
Even Rhodey winces a bit as he hears it, and Tony pretends to be very busy with a project.
Steve looks like he’s about to be sick. “You didn’t report it.” Not a question. Tony just shakes his head, shoving the memories down, locking them away because
His hands are shaking. He gives both cups of coffee to Happy outside without explanation, throat tight.
He doesn’t want to run from it.
His ribs are still aching, and they’re not broken, but they hurt like a bitch, and they're definitely bruised.
Tony pulls it out of his pocket anyway, glancing at the caller ID. A mix of emotions flash across his face, but Steve can see the rage loud and clear, burning through everything else, burning through the blissful joy. Suddenly, Steve knows
“It’s not going to be a death mission.”
what Obadiah is about to say and he wants to yell at him not to, even though that won’t take away the truth-
he thinks.
Tony is twenty minutes late to the address that he texted him, and Steve is beginning to wonder if this whole thing is actually some elaborate joke. The restaurant he’s outside of is Italian, and Tony still isn’t here, and honestly he’s not sure if he’s relieved or not.
[2] You’re quiet tonight.
, just leave him out of it.”
“No no no-”
the second side. And I know you can’t share everything with me, but I just…”
He leads the way out of the apartment, and tries to work out if Steve, the most honest person he knows, will ever forgive him.
“I just need-”
“Dizzy,” Tony says, the words slurring as he shifts again, and Steve catches him with both hands, pulling him upright.
Obie laughs too, and it’s a cold thing.
Once he’s sure that he can breathe again, Tony opens his eyes, glaring at one of the cameras. Then he sits down, pulling a pile of paper towards him, and starts to read.
“No.”
“It’s literally the
Obie takes his coffee, Tony takes the other two.
“Okay. Breakfast. When did you last eat sweetheart?”
He left Steve’s apartment at 9, sliding out of bed and kissing him long and hard before leaving. He hadn’t wanted to drag it out. He hadn’t been sure if he could
“Yeah.” He says with a frown, reaching for a bag of chips. “Crazy.”
Steve watches as Tony takes a sip and closes his eyes, just taking in the sight of the billionaire. There’s something strangely intimate about watching Tony when he doesn’t know he’s being watched. There’s a softness on his face that no one else really sees, a softness that comes with being vulnerable, something that Steve knows is rare. As he watches, a stray curl falls into Tony’s face, and without hesitating, he reaches up and tucks it back again, hand hovering against his cheek.
Tony lets out a breath, shaking his head a little. “I don’t even know if I’m angry about this. I’m- it feels like shock. He was ready to kill me, he
The elevator dings, they get out. The hallway is empty apart from two people pressed against a wall.
Steve’s voice is soft, but it isn’t a voice that’s telling him he’s weak. It’s a voice of someone who cares.
Tony leans in, pressing their foreheads together, and Steve feels him take in a shuddering breath. Not for the first time, Steve is reminded of how young he is, how young they both are. Tony is someone who’s gone through more than what most people endure in a lifetime, and yet he is still here, still fighting.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice is quiet, and Tony is ashamed of the way he feels himself relax at the sound of it.
“I know.” He says with a humourless smile. “Just trying to make conversation.”
His lips twitch slightly. “No promises. Bye.”
he drinks so much at these parties if he’s not even interested in the alcohol.
“Okay,” he says softly.
He wasn’t. He wasn’t even a decent person.
Tony blinks, eyebrows shooting up. “What?”
When he meets Steve outside of the tiny art gallery, Tony smiles, but doesn’t kiss him. Too many eyes, too many people. Steve doesn’t seem to care though, only gives him a grin in response that is so open, so honest. Tony feels light when he leads him inside.
“You know I don’t care about that. How was dinner?”
hoodie, and he won’t pretend that doesn’t make him feel more than a little pleased) and a blanket.
“This is-” he sucks in a breath, closing his eyes for a second. “God Steve.”
“You look a little pale sweetheart. Seriously. If you’re going to hurl on my suit I’ll be a little pissed off.”
“What? I do my research. He graduated from MIT last year, and he’s come to New York to help his father with work.” She frowns slightly. “Also, how do you know he’s not gay?”
It’s the wrong thing to say, Steve realises instantly, as for the first time since arriving, anger flickers to life in Tony’s eyes.
If Steve is surprised by the information, it doesn’t show on his face, and Tony wonders if he’s judging and hiding it well, or if it just doesn’t matter to him.
“Hey.”
He rolls his eyes, lacing their hands together.
well who I am, who my father is. You know that I can shut you down in
“Mr Stark please consider-”
“No.” Steve says softly, hugging him tighter. “Tony you don’t. I’m glad I'm here, I’m glad I’m allowed to love you and be a part of your life. I wouldn't change that for the world, Okay?”
Tony’s stomach flips, and he takes another sip of his drink, hands shaking as he puts it down again.
the amusement radiating off Rhodey. They’re next to the fountain now, and there’s something about the rushing sound of water that is oddly soothing. “You’re being annoying.”
“At five in the morning?”
“So that’s a yes for me keeping it?”
a good idea.
When they get back to the hotel, there’s no grand goodbye. Obadiah and Howard go for another drink at the bar, and suddenly he’s left alone with Maria for the first time in… a while.
is the right word to use. He’d backed out of Obadiah’s company five years ago, and hadn’t had any desire to go back into weapons manufacturing. That hasn't stopped Obadiah from wanting him to keep in touch. Even after his mother's death, Obie had wanted to keep catching up with him, despite Maria being the person to really connect them in the first place. Or at least she had been, until Obie had hired him straight out of college.
Maybe it’s the stillness of the water, maybe it’s the setting sun. He doesn’t know, but something prompts the next words out of his mouth.
that he's going through so much effort to hide. And great now he’s
“Thank you for coming to dinner with me. I think-” He breaks off, glancing down at the fork that Steve can still see spinning between his fingers. He’s got a scar on his index finger, running down the entire length of it. When he speaks again, it comes out in a rush.  “We should do it again. This, or something else, or-”
Tony feels older right now, despite the fact that he's pretty sure he’s younger than Steve by a couple of years. It’s a stupid question, one that he doesn’t even have the energy to answer sarcastically
“Look into police records over the last ten years, anything linking to SI. We should be clean, so if there’s anything there, flag it.” Tony hands him his phone, typing in a string of code. “I cracked the firewalls, so it should be overridden. Tell me if you run into any problems.”
Too far, he’s said too much, he-
Ty, not for this.
Tony doesn’t trust Obadiah, not really. his eyes are too cold, too calculating. But the man is also the only person even closely resembling a parental figure in his life now, and it's hard to turn his back on that. Plus, Obie hasn’t done anything wrong that Tony could prove even if he wanted to. It's just… a feeling.
to afford. He can be grateful. He
There’s a part of him that wonders why, that wants to turn back to Fury and ask.
Tony smiles humourlessly, and it’s at times like this that Steve sees the businessman in him, the soon to be CEO, rather than the 18 year old boy that he really is.
He just wants Steve.
“No,” he snaps, spinning to face him. It’s a lie. He’s so scared. “But they fucking get off on power, all three of the parasites, and I’m trapped in the middle.” His voice is rising, not quite shouting, but he’s not relaxed either.
Steve steps towards him, and there’s so much in his eyes and Tony can’t breathe because he fucking loves him but all he does is hurt him, even when he doesn’t mean to.
As he looks at her again, he takes in the details. She’s dressed in a tailored suit, coat over one arm and hair windswept. It’s so at odds with the leather jackets and combat boots Tony is used to that he has to take a second. He sees the flash of annoyance in her eyes as he hesitates and decides to start talking.
“Yes.” Steve says quietly, without hesitation. “I know how they work, it’s a good idea to send me.”
Right. He wants to talk. He forces himself to look at Steve.
Obadiah's shouts continue down the hall, rapidly morphing into threats that send a chill snaking down Steve’s spine. Threats aimed at Tony, at Steve, at
Tony blinks. He’d been expecting shouting, disappointment, a detention at the very least.
Sam comes up behind him, and something about his face must give him away, because his friend laughs. “That didn't click straight away, huh.”
And that… that sentence is a code.
“Tony?” He says instead, searching his eyes and brushing a thumb over his cheek. “We don’t have to watch a movie if you don’t want to.”
“You had sex. With Tony Stark.”
“Oops.”
with him.”
the movie, Tony is the one who is falling asleep on top of him. He can’t say he’s complaining, because Tony’s weight on his chest is strangely comforting. He can only see the top of Tony’s head, a mess of curls. The rest of him is covered in a giant hoodie (it’s
Nick Fury comes knocking, he nearly dies from palladium poisoning, then December 16th rolls around. He declines Fury, or rather Fury declines him, but he doesn’t really care anymore.
“Thank you so much, for all of this.”
This chapter is more of a love letter to you all (and to Steve and Tony) than anything else. This is the first multi-chapter fic I've written and completed, and I have loved writing it so much.
like a child. But really, isn’t that what he is, even though he’s technically an adult now? A child who lost his mother, a child who’s never getting her back.
“Not in the slightest.” Steve says with a grin, sitting up with a tiny wince. He feels better, a lot better. He feels stiff, still tired, but so much more functional than before.
Tony feels annoyance flare in his chest, and he isn’t sure why but he just feels a bit
Obie laughs, flinging an arm around his shoulders and Tony forces himself to lean into it, to relax, to laugh with him.
He opens his eyes. Really, he needs to stop being surprised by bad timings.
That’s Steve again, because of fucking course he followed him outside, of course he did because he’s
“I missed you.”
look good in his unfairly flattering tight jeans and black shirt. It’s not a complicated outfit, but the term
God, Tony. And he had no idea, no idea about any of it because Tony is too good at hiding, too good at keeping secrets.
“Eight years. Give or take.”
It hurts, because Tony, the one person who has never failed to understand him, is gone.
“Yes. Please.”
“Steve.” Tony snaps, clearly losing patience. “You’re talking to a fucking billionaire. I’ll pay for what the class would’ve cost. Hell, if you would
“Yeah.”
“He doesn’t deserve something as normal as prison. I’m going to use the information to get him to give up every bit of control he has left, then throw him into the highest maximum security prison that exists.”
Tony leans forwards, resting his chin on his hand.
He’s not sure if he’s crying or not, but everything feels so fucking numb and the panic is gone but somehow this is so much worse.
“You sure?”
The email screenshots comes next, and Steve swallows down bile as Tony reaches out, scrolling through the information on the screen. There are endless emails, endless photos. Evidence, easily enough evidence. Words jump out at Steve as he reads, words that make him want to break glass, or maybe break the man who’d left only hours before.
“Point made.”
Steve clearly hasn’t gotten any better at masking his looks of surprise, but Tony doesn’t comment on them, and a minute later, they’re out of the back door. He lets the cool air hit him, something that has been tense all day uncoiling in his chest.
It’s not a question, Tony answers it anyway.
“Right.”
“Hey. You scared me for a second there.”
Obie just laughs quietly, and Tony’s given himself away by reacting like that. He’s fucking given it all away and he should have pretended not to give a shit but it’s
Clint grins, flopping down next to him on the bed and sighing dramatically.
He laughs at something his mother says, speaks when he’s supposed to, and avoids Howard’s gaze.
“Right. Thanks.”
Tony is just about managing to keep up, so he’s not surprised when his mind starts to drift a little. Five years ago seems like forever, and yet nothing at all.
He’s drowning, has been drowning for a while now.
Tony’s phone rings, interrupting his thoughts. He picks it up with a frown, eyes flickering over the
He takes it anyway, clicking the door shut behind him.
“You’re Tony Stark, that’s what you told us. How many other people know?”
(He’s one of them after all, however much he tries to pretend otherwise.)
But then Pepper knocks on the door of his lab, and she’s holding a paper bag filled with jam donuts and a cup of coffee, and she doesn’t say anything.  She just sits down, handing him the food and coffee wordlessly, and they sit in a comfortable silence for the rest of the evening.
“What happened to model student James Rhodes hm?” Tony says under his breath. “Listening to music in class now are we?”
He swings his legs over the side of the bed, testing his weight. Shaky. Fine. It’s fine. He’s fine.
Tony puts his feet on the table, boots making a dull thud as they connect. He sees the flash of annoyance in Fury’s eyes, and smiles a little, tight knot of anxiety in his stomach relaxing slightly. Fuck keeping on this guys good side.
Steve nods, stepping back and accepting the tracker as Tony hands it over.
And finally thank you so much for reading, and for all the amazing comments, they literally mean the whole world.
“I- I was at the party. Rhodey left. I was drinking. Then someone- it felt weird. Dizzy...Ty took me out of the room."
Something in him aches at the way Tony's eyes light up, and he has to kiss him again, pulling him closer.
and he won’t be fucking weak, not because of this.
“You owe me loads of sex. And chocolate.”
He just presses his head further into Steve’s shoulder. Tony is shaking, and it’s not from the cold at all.
he’s so beautiful. Tony reaches out, smoothing some of his hair away from his face, and smiles slightly as Steve leans into his touch, still asleep. His skin is so soft, and
By the time it’s dark, Steve is back in Tony’s apartment, and he really would sell his soul to have someone freeze time so he could stay here forever.
He shoves his hands into his pockets, following Obadiah out of the lobby door. They’ve booked a car and Tony gets in first, pushing until he’s right up against the window. The glass is cold, soothing.
“No one else knows.”
Rhodey touches his arm gently and he releases a slow breath, fighting for control.
“Me too.”
“Sure. And… do you work here now or something?”
“Call if-”
Of course she doesn’t. Of
“Keep telling yourself that.”
Tony shrugs, smile widening. “You didn’t. It was just heavily implied. You’re rather loud.”
The other man’s smooth voice comes through the line, and Steve tenses because he hates it for a reason that he can’t put his finger on.
He glances at Steve, eyes questioning, clearly wondering if it Steve was okay with him ordering on his behalf. He nods with a half smile, finally feeling his nerves ebbing away. Tony knows the restaurant, so he trusts him to know what’s good to eat too.
“Technically I’m not. I had to pull a couple of strings with the people in charge, and do a lot of whining to Pepper about how important it is to me that I’m here.”
He’s blushing again, he’s definitely blushing, because it’s been a while since he’s been on a date and he’s so damn
“Come on.” He says quietly, leading him out of the door. The hall is empty now, silent, and Steve feels a tension in him unwind.
for us Steven.” Tony says with a smirk, pressing a quick kiss to his lips.
“Do you still want to go for dinner?”
Tony doesn’t resist when he’s pulled into another kiss, and he can feel the heat of Steve’s skin and it’s so
“Wrong number, don’t worry. What were you-”
“Maybe give me your number? Then I can text you the timings.”
But all he says it “Okay,” and then he takes Tony’s hand again, gripping tight as he leads him up to his apartment.
“Nope. Sort of crazy day.”
“This job doesn’t wait for anyone sweetheart. I tend to need to stay awake for it.”
“Who did this to you?” Steve says again, meeting Tony’s gaze head on. He sees a thousand emotions go through his eyes in a split second, before they settle back down into something near emotionless.
“Yeah, who is this?”
“What was that?”
Steve’s heart is pounding, mind turning over the words again and again.
“Let’s go home.”
Tony's voice has dropped into something colder, nastier, but Steve still doesn’t regret pushing, refuses to regret pushing him on this.
He sees Tony’s hands pressed against the other boy’s chest.
“Don’t worry, we’re still going make it.”
Tony just stares at him for a second, and there’s an expression of disbelief in his eyes.
His boyfriend’s laugh filters past him, and the smell of coffee follows soon after. That’s his question answered at least.
“But listen, Tony I’m-”
“Where are you going?”
of what Natasha would do, Tony knows as much from hours spent working with her at SHIELD. But of course, this is not Natasha Romanoff at all.
God, It’s so
did I say that?”
“When am I not?” That's Tony’s voice, snapping him out of his own thoughts.
Tony’s eyes are what scare him the most. They’ve emptied out, and he doesn’t know why, he doesn’t know how to
“It’s okay.” Steve must have said the words five times over, but he doesn’t care. “You’re safe. Just stay awake, okay?”
“I know it’s not-”
“When did you get good at relationship advice? Has Nat been giving you classes or something?”
Tony kisses him again, then pulls away and smiles. The soft musement is there, but the secretive part… it’s no longer a secret. It’s written all over his face. The unreadable thing in his eyes is now so clear that it’s almost tangible, and Steve feels his heart in his throat as Tony takes his hand, winding their fingers together.
“I’m sure I’ll be seeing you later sweetheart. Have an
Obie had said that when they’d died, had looked at him with empty eyes, hand closing around his arm in the way he’d hated more than anything.
His phone rings, the work one, and Tony nearly jumps out of his skin. Once he’s got his breathing under control, he picks up.
“Steve he-” It’s not often Nat is at a loss for words, but she’s struggling now. “I don’t think it went all the way.”
Tony runs his hand over the computer, and he’s got a look of intense focus on his face as he examines the screen, playing around with some of the keys
Silence.
“I love you too. So much. I just don’t want you to blame yourself for things that aren’t your fault.”
“Right.” Steve blinks, flashing him a smile that is a cross between soft and sinful. It shouldn’t be possible, definitely not for someone like Steve, and yet here they are.
Tony opens his mouth to say something else, but then his phone rings. Steve doesn’t miss how the smile vanishes instantly, but it’s none of his business, so he doesn’t say anything. He hands him the coffee, and Tony winks once before turning away, already talking to whoever’s on the other side of the call.
Steve frowns slightly, and Tony can almost
“It won’t be a problem.” Tony says smoothly. “Will that be all?”
Tony grins, shifting so that their eyes meet, and Steve can see something shimmering and dark in his gaze. He hesitates for a second, wavering, because he really
Tony spins around, and that’s
“Right.”
“What was that?”
He doesn’t move, and when the first rays of sunlight begin to creep through the window, he gets up and makes a pot of coffee.
When he gets back to the table, they’re all laughing at something Obadiah has said.
“Did you ever find out who was dealing under the table.”
“A friend.”
“I love old fountains. Thank god for structural malfunctions.”
He nods, still not looking at Steve. “Yeah?”
So Steve had given him the space to breathe, and a week later, there had been a knock at his door. He lets his mind wander back to the feeling of relief he'd felt when Tony had turned up at his apartment.
“Okay, that’s good. That’s good baby. I’m on my way, okay?”
“I know.”
Tony laughs, and it’s something cold, nothing like the bright laughter from last night. The laugh is autopilot, he can’t really think anymore. Everything’s a mess, and he’s cold. He’s so cold. Everything is fucking cold and something in his head is screaming at him to run and fix it, to
“Is that a way to speak to a friend Tony? Can I at least buy you a drink?”
When they reach Times Square, Steve winces at the amount of people.
“He told me if I didn’t get Ty and his father to agree to that damn business deal, there would be consequences. I didn’t- I couldn’t let him, and you got hurt.”
He smirks, taking a seat at one of his bar stools. His father and Obie view him as a playboy, he knows that much. So let them.
“I was going to.”
Tony picks up the phone with a razor sharp smile, the blazing anger not faltering for a second, flicking it to speakerphone.
“Not an excuse to be an asshole.”
Tony laughs quietly, leaning against Steve, and he feels his heart stutter in his chest.
“I’m sorry.” Steve says, pulling him closer. “God Tony
He closes his eyes, leaning against the wall.
“How much do you remember?”
“This is..." He's not sure
the look on Steve’s face-
He reaches out almost hesitantly, running his fingers over Steve’s face, brushing against his hair, touching his lips. Then he makes himself comfortable against his chest, kissing him gently.
Steve lets him go as Tony pushes himself up into a sitting position, answering the call.
He knows his number, but the clean phone is in his apartment in his jacket. According to his mother's watch, it’s 4:38 when they get to the hotel.
Tony laughs, and it’s light, happier than everything else he’s done since walking in. Something in Steve relaxes at the sound, and he lets his fingers trace over Tony’s shoulders, his collarbones. He wants nothing more than to stay with him here for the rest of the day.
He gets him into the bed, but doesn’t try to take off any of his clothes because god knows he’s had enough of that in the last few hours.
Part of him wonders if it’s too soon. He’s only just met Tony, doesn’t know a lot about him. But…
“The answer is no,” Tony says steadily, even though his heart is still pounding in his chest. “You can tell Howard whatever you want.”
Steve leans in, pressing a kiss to one corner of his mouth, then the other. Tony closes his eyes, breathing out slowly and finally letting himself relax.
what Clint is referring to.
He doesn’t think Tony is breathing next to him, and Steve is shaking a bit, trembling with anger and something a little like fear, but not for himself. Obadiah reaches out, touching one of the bruises on his face, pressing down on the skin. Hard. Steve inhales sharply, swallowing the urge to flinch away from his touch.
He feels Steve come up to stand next to him, and he sounds so goddamn nervous.
Steve sits down on the bed facing him, and for once, Tony is struggling to read his expression. Or maybe that’s just his panic, though he’s not sure why he’s panicking, since the entire situation is completely his fault. The silence is what’s getting to him. It’s always what gets to him before an argument. It’s what gets to him with Howard, and it’s what’s making his heart rate speed up now-
“Fine. Just be careful.”
[4] Goodnight mom
“Shit,” mutters Rhodey under his breath. “Okay well Ty is someone I would love to rip in half, and he’s there. I just…I don’t want Tony to get hurt, so would you be able to maybe check up on him? Pick him up or something?”
is not something he gets often. Like he doesn’t deserve it. He looks so young in the moment, and Steve feels his heart in his throat.
you are-”
Tony realises he's spoken out loud, and fights to keep his expression neutral, even as Steve’s brows furrow in confusion.
Rhodey arrives a little late, but he’s beyond grateful for his friend, beyond relieved that he’s here. Obadiah shoots him a look that makes his stomach turn as Rhodey shows up, but there’s nothing he can do, or say, in front of all these people. Rhodey ignores the look, gently taking Tony’s arm and guiding him to sit on one of the bar stools, away from everyone.
“Tony.” Nat says quietly, warning low in her voice. He glances at her once, and there’s something in her gaze that makes him pause with a frown.
“If you say I’m sorry, I’m flying over to kick your ass.”
Steve traces his fingers over Tony’s face, and he’s so
Tony’s thumb traces over his cheek, but the relaxing motion doesn’t match his tone when he speaks again.
But no matter how much Tony pushes him away, he knows Steve won’t break, he won’t run, he won’t leave him alone.
“Thank you. It is sort of my job though.”
He lashes out, hitting Steve in the chest without any real force, because the last thing he wants to do is hurt him more, and he’s breaking
“I told you,” says Tony steadily, a lot more steadily than he’s feeling right now, “I’m not scared of him.”
“You’re meant to be in DC.”
“No. No one would have believed me.”

Obie just looks at him, and his eyes are so empty of emotion. Sometimes, Tony wonders if he’s even human.
If he could be anywhere else right now, he would be. Bed preferably, but sitting down could also work. At least the cafe is warm. Warm, with the smell of coffee lingering in the air. Coffee. That’s
Tony stands up suddenly, shoving back his chair. Too loud. He just… he needs to breathe, needing to get out. It’s too much. Obie, Howard, Ty, Steve. It’s mixing in his head, he doesn’t know who he’s angry with anymore.
He tastes like coming home.
“Tony was just-”
[9] Yes, I’m fine, it’s not important.
Howard makes him want to run and never stop running, but Steve is the first person who’s made him, even a tiny part of him, want to stay. And that won’t end well, not for anyone.
away from him, you clear?”
Sam saying it is making him think about it, which is making him blush even more and really this just isn’t what he expected to be dealing with this morning, especially as all he can think about is Tony's hands-
“Hey, give him a chance.” Steve smiles at the first customer who comes in, turning back to Natasha. “Just… can we try this again. Maybe all go for drinks together or something.”
“Thank you.” The Captain says, and his voice has a note of… something in it. Tony hasn’t heard it before, can’t figure out what exactly it is.
“Your father wants me to let you know that he’s going to be half an hour early.”
His head is loud, and everywhere else is quiet. Too quiet.
He finds his voice again.
He resists the urge to kick her, because he’s never heard Natasha Romanoff
anymore because Tony wasn’t more goddamn careful. He would leave now, except Howard is blocking the door, and there's no goddamn point in running from this.
He doesn’t sleep that night.
Sometimes when he’s around Steve, he thinks he hears his mother's voice, tinged with sadness, but low and soothing as always.
“Im fine.”
Tony smirks, sliding the money across the counter to him, along with a small piece of paper. His handwriting is neat, so unlike Steve’s own slanted mess.
He lets out a laugh, shaking his head and hitting her gently on the shoulder as Clint grins, throwing his apron at him. He manages to catch it before it hits him in the face, and he’s grateful for that because he really doesn’t need to go any
, Tony thinks, but that’s impossible, and ridiculous, and he can’t know, he
Why does he want to go out for dinner? Tony is an asshole, he’s been awful, he’s-
“Is it- I’m sorry, I don’t want to-”
It had been a mistake.
Tony nods, relief flooding through him. He is just starting to move back towards the door when Fury’s voice stops him again.
“Just to let you know that your parents are on their way to Malibu now, and that you’ll be attending a New Year’s party there in a few weeks time.”
Steve pulls him to his feet and he wavers for a second, but then grits his teeth. He feels better than he had last night, but still like he's been run over multiple times. By a train.
Steve rolls his eyes, but he’s smiling too as he untangles himself from Tony’s grip and stands, grabbing his jacket off a chair.
Because of course it’s his fault. It’s his fault for provoking his father, his fault for pushing, always his fault.
It’s like a clock.
Tony hesitates for a second, because he isn’t sure, he doesn’t
He goes into the graveyard alone, ignoring Howard’s headstone and crouching on the damp grass next to his mother's.
Obadiah just looks at him, small smile curving his lips, and Steve has never wanted to punch someone so badly in his life.
“I’m coming with you.”
Tony manages a smile despite the nausea rolling in his stomach. He just needs to
Steve Rogers asks him if he wants company, and he looks so sincere that Tony feels his heart break a little more in his chest. Steve is so honest it hurts, and he makes him smile, and he makes him laugh, and he makes him feel
I can’t do this with you right now."
“You left the coffee shop in a rush this morning.”
There are spare parts strewn across the bench, and Dum-e, a bot he made at MIT, is rolling around the room, occasionally bumping into him.
“Hello?”
He can’t tell him. Not now.
Because he refuses to be seen as weak, not by Steve, especially not by Steve, because he’s
He doesn’t say that.
Tired. Cold.
In the end, Tony isn’t surprised that Rhodey ends up punching Steve in the face, but when it happens he grabs his friend’s arm, dragging him out of the room.
The solution is obvious, but it makes Tony feel sick.
He wonders what Peter would say if he finds out his mentor and teacher, Tony Carbonell, is actually Tony Stark. He would probably die, if his frequent monologues about how
“I’m still sorry though. Didn’t mean to drop that on you.”
(He fails. He’s been failing at ignoring Steve’s eyes for three months now.)
Steve gives him an answering smile that is so happy, so full of light, that for a second, Tony feels his heart in his throat.
When he opens his eyes, the room is filled with light, the sort of light that you can only get when its a cold December morning.
“Okay Tony, okay.”
“Baby I could never hate you,” Steve murmurs, fingers carding through his hair, and the soothing, constant rhythm is making him feel like he’s floating.
“Good. You’re learning.” He always has had such a shark smile. “I came to let you know that your parents request you come out for dinner with them on Friday night. They’re both in New York for the weekend and they wish to, and these are your mother’s words,
“Dinner. I really want to go for dinner, but I didn’t know how to say that in a text, and I was worried you didn’t actually want to and I still don’t know if you do or if you were kidding or-”
She shrugs, a smile tugging at her lips. “Right. And how often are you actually
He hates Obie, he does know that much, hates him almost as much as he hated his father. He wants him gone. But… they work well together, despite everything. And if Tony gets rid of Obadiah, then it’s just him, alone, running a billion dollar company he’s never wanted to run.
“Good boy,” he says with a smirk, reaching out and straightening Tony’s suit jacket. He flinches back, and Obie laughs a little, giving him a gentle but not gentle push towards the door. “Try not to look so down about it Tony, it’s not the end of the world.”
“Nope, believe it or not, I’m way too behind on work to get a job. I only came here to make fun of you. I’ll be going, now that we’ve done that.”
“Hey,” Tony says again, softly, and Steve’s lips tug into a smile.
His mother is all smiles, air kissing his cheeks, her lipstick immaculate. She spends a minute speaking rapid Italian, telling him how
The rest of the sentence trails away, and Steve ignores the dread and confusion that are wrestling for control in him.
Steve furrows his brows, confusion knotting them together.
The idea that there is one person, one person to fit with you like the missing piece of a puzzle, one person who you always sense walking into a room, one person who makes you feel
“I should get going.” Steve says with a smile. “I’ll be late for work.”
There’s no noticeable change on Tony’s face, but his voice is edged with something dangerous when he speaks again, standing up.
Tony raises his hand, leaning forward a little, and his eyes look lighter. Happier.
Steve snaps out of his own thoughts.
“Better?” Steve says softly, not moving from where he’s crouched next to him. Once Tony is sure he can speak, he nods slowly.
“Why?” He dares to ask, because Tony can say whatever he wants, and he’s not really sure what he’s asking him to say, but it somehow feels so very important.
“You don’t
“That won’t be a problem. Thanks again. Really, thank you.”
It’s not an apology, and he doesn’t want to apologise anyway. He wants Steve to understand, he wants to explain, but not apologise. He would do it again, however much it made him hate himself. Obie is dangerous, and Tony refuses to let Steve get ruined by mistakes that aren’t his own.
The nightmares don’t reach him that night.
Steve laughs, kissing him gently, and the light in Tony’s eyes is really worth everything.
“Pep. Just

There’s a beat of silence, and when he speaks again, JARVIS is quiet.

“What did he tell you?” Rhodey says quietly, eyes dark. “What the
He knows Steve doesn’t miss the tinge of bitterness in his voice, but the pity he’s dreading never comes. Instead, there’s something sharp flashing in his eyes.
“Steve-”
“Your parents were in a car crash on the way to the airport this morning.”
“You- what?”
He can see the walls slamming into place, crashing down between Steve and the endless, consuming,
And now Tony just feels distinctly uncomfortable, because maybe he hasn’t expressed it in class, but that's only because he doesn’t pay attention. Everything just bores him so much and-
Steve sits up fast, hands steady and solid on his face as he cups it. Tony can’t breathe, he still can’t fucking breathe or move as wave after wave after wave of grief crashes over him. It’s endless, it’s drowning him, it’s suffocating and there’s no end, it just keeps coming. He can’t see, can’t think, and can’t breathe. He wonders if this is what it feels like to finally break. What would happen if he just let it sweep him away?
“Christ.” Tony groans, glaring at him. “One minute in the big leagues with some secret agents, and your hero worship for me just vanishes.”
“I’m nearly done.” The teen says, twisting two ends together. “My aunt won’t worry, she knows I like to stay late. Did that meeting go well?”
They found three. They’ve all been removed, and Tony’s changed the locks.
“Did I say anything to you?”
“What did you forget this time-”
“You don’t have to-”
Natasha gives him a lazy smile, pulling out the keys to her bike. “Nope. You’ve got time, so don’t stress too much. Be careful.”
It’s too late now. But isn’t that what he had said to Bruce so long ago? Something about the world’s leading authority on waiting too long. Maybe once, he would have laughed at that. Not now.
“Maybe a change wouldn’t be such a bad idea.”
“Why does Fury want me there?” He says, eyes narrowing. “Because last I checked I'm just the mechanic.”
what if he knows?
has been avoided.
“Rhodey?”
Pepper glances between them.
“With who?”
“You like it?” Tony says close to his ear, breath warming Steve’s skin. “You said a while ago that you’d never done New Year in Times Square, so I thought I should change that.”
Steve smiles, shifting slightly and pulling Tony against him. “Hi.”
“What?”
“For work?”
“Shit.” He mutters, yanking his sweatshirt over his head. “I have to go Cap, but come down about 7?”
“What?” He says, biting back a smile and playing dumb.
“He-” Tony is beginning to think that Steve might break something. “He didn’t do anything?”
“I know,” Tony says, because he doesn’t have the energy for this. He won’t lie to Rhodey, can’t bring himself to after spending the morning lying to Steve. “I didn’t want to steal Pepper’s concealer again, even though she doesn’t ask any questions.
“Good.”
He knows. He knows what Tony is trying to ask without him even having to ask it.
himself think about him.
“Please,” he says, and it slips out because that’s horror that he can feel now. Obie could tear Steve apart, could ruin his life, could organise an ‘accident.’ He’s done it before, Tony knows he won’t hesitate to do it again. He doesn’t make empty threats.
“What’s taking so long?”
Tony just snorts, unwilling to surrender his latte, and tolerating the nickname because Happy is one of the only people he actually likes. Also because he knows that Howard never tells him to stop drinking coffee because
But now-
ha- okay so I swear I meant to update this in time for Christmas, and then i didn't. And then it was supposed to be New Year which also didn't happen... and now here we are and it's the 23rd of January, and I'm finally updating :) hope you enjoy!
“Leave it Tony. It doesn’t matter.”
Tony huffs, kissing him again. “
Steve laughs, closing his eyes and tugging Tony against him. The next song in the album starts to play, and Steve smiles, just breathing. Frank Sinatra again. Steve knows that it was on purpose now, because it’s Tony. Of course it was on purpose.
The other boy shrugs, letting go of Tony and giving him a hard shove. Steve barely moves in time to catch him as he stumbles, and this is wrong, this is so wrong, because Tony smells like alcohol but he’s more than drunk right now as he collapses into Steve’s arms.
There’s a fair amount of screaming, mostly done by Justin and his friends, and Tony bites back a laugh as the feeling fades, sitting down again.
with this.
And now they’re both looking at him like they’re expecting an answer, and Tony remembers that Fury’s sentence had been phrased as more of a question. Right.
Steve leans forward, and he’s close enough that Tony can smell the faint scent of coconut shampoo. He forces himself to focus as the Captain speaks.
The Captain is still looking between the two of them, but then he blinks, face relaxing slightly.
He doesn’t know how he remembers the street name, doesn’t know how he finds the energy or the will or the words or anything.
Tony lets out a noise that’s half way between a laugh and a sob, and is on his feet in seconds, throwing himself at the man who has just walked in the door. Rhodey doesn’t flinch as Tony collides with him, only laughs a little, arms coming around Tony to pull him closer.
what she’s referring to.
“But I-”
The men crowd forward, and in seconds, Obadiah is surrounded by people escorting him out of the room.
“Do tell,” Tony grits out, because the last goddamn thing he wants to do is talk about Ty fucking Stone and his silver tongue with Steve.
Steve can’t begin to speak even if he tried, so only stares as Tony’s phone buzzes and he rolls his eyes.
He takes another drink, shrugging, and fighting to keep his tone even.
The party is in one of the hotels his father likes to stay in. They’re downstairs in the bar, and the whole area has been reserved for this evening. He’s been booked into one of the rooms on the same floor, but all he wants to do is
to describe it.
“So you’ve been working in the office over the past few weeks.”
“Steve Rogers,” Tony says, voice sharp, “will be staying here as my witness.”
Tony’s own words ring in his ears
Also, I am not Italian, so any Italian in here is a mix of three different translators and my friend who's taking Italian classes. If it's wrong, I'm sorry, and I swear I'm not trying to make anyone mad :,)
He makes an effort to soften his tone. Nice. He can do nice. He does nice for the cameras, for Obie, for his parents.
in a way that Tony hasn’t felt in a while. Suddenly, he doesn’t want to call Ty anymore.
“No. But did I forget to mention the cameras? I said they were mine, technically I loaned the footage to SHIELD. Apparently, they’re rather invested in taking down power hungry businessmen. I mean usually, they’re far more interested in global scale threats, but your scheming plus a rather large donation convinced them to lend a hand.”
“Cappuccino,” says Happy quietly, and Tony looks away from the pity in his eyes, turning back to Obadiah.
“I’ll also be testifying for emotional manipulation and blackmail, just because it’s a nice addition. If you don’t make a fuss about it, maybe they’ll bury you in the fancy prison garden, rather than the shitty one.”
“Define well.” Tony mutters, sitting down with a sigh. “It was fine. But i’ll be gone for a few weeks starting tomorrow. There’s a mission.”
“Bi,” he corrects gently, though he thinks he’s a bit past correcting people on his sexuality. The press know him as one thing, and hopefully it will
They both stop dead as Obadiah Stane hangs up the phone, standing outside of the apartment.
It’s fine. Just down the road.
They go back to Tony's apartment afterwards.
He hands Natasha a spare key, maybe because he has nothing better to with his evening.
“Staying,” Steve says with a small smile. “I just might run down to the store and get some more junk food.”
“Any time. Just be careful.”
And then… nothing.
and Steve smiles, worries fading.
“Last I checked, blackmail and emotional manipulation are
“It’s okay,” Tony says quickly, and that’s panic he can hear in his voice now. “Doesn’t matter. Can you tell me where you are?”
“I did.” His smile fades slightly. “Obie was not impressed.”
to do this from a security perspective?” Steve mutters as Tony pulls him forward.
Sam’s expression softens, and he claps him on the shoulder.
There’s a second of silence, and then he feels rather than sees Tony smile.
“I- you weren’t okay when we found you Tony." The tone of Steve's voice makes him wonder what exactly Tony had said to him last night. "Ty said… he said he spiked your drink. He said you would know what was in it.”
, and neither does Obie.
“Let’s not joke about that sweetheart.” He can hear the smile in Tony’s voice. “Just hurry up, okay?”
He touches Steve on the arm, and his skin is warm, it’s so warm, and Tony wants to kiss him again more than he wants to do anything else.
He just needs-
Hope you liked this! If anyone wants to come and yell at me, my instagram and tumblr are @wordsxstars. Thank you for the support on this so far!
Steve tilts his head to the side with a small smile.
“Love you too. Now hurry. Chocolate, remember?”
He ignores his father for the remainder of the ride back, and he knows he’ll get hell for it later, but he also knows that by the time they’re all up the next day, Tony will have already left.
so much.
Fuck.
“I’m-” Rhodey elbows him in the ribs, hearing the tone, and Tony barely reins in the urge to give his friend a gesture he knows Fury won’t appreciate. “I’m more interested in the actual mythology more than the art.” He grits out, shooting another glare at Rhodey.
“I’ll have a latte, but throw in an extra double shot espresso.”
For a second, Tony wonders if Steve is going to say something else. His eyes flicker with something unreadable, and there’s a part of Tony that wants to ask. The other part of him is so very afraid to.
“The caffeine should help.”
There are sketches of New York, paintings of his friends, photos of what Tony guesses are his favourite places. Eyes, cuffs of sleeves, hands holding coffee, a flash of red hair. He can feel the effort in everything that Steve does, everything he creates.
from him? Or was that suddenly just not an important detail.”
“You’re not seriously saying we’re-
Tony’s voice has shifted into something silky smooth, and Steve clears his throat, suddenly feeling hot all over.
“GHB.” He says quietly, running a hand through his hair.
He calls Happy, and if the other man is surprised to see Obadiah, he doesn’t say it.
Tony doesn’t answer, staring at his mug of coffee, but not really looking at it at all.
Tony gives him a bland smile. “Yeah. Maybe.”
and he swallows down bile and god his heart is beating so fucking fast. He doesn’t answer.
“It’s Steve.”
He drifts again.
He looks up, sees the blue eyes, and immediately looks back to his drink.
“I’ll be there. Thanks for letting me know.”
“Ti prego, Tesoro.” [6] He murmurs, and he sees Steve swallow. Hard.
It’s 11:49am. It’s Friday morning.
And now Tony is blushing like a fifteen year old. Excellent.
He had met Peter at the first class he’d ever taught at MIT. Tony had seen so much of himself reflected in Peter in that first hour that he hadn’t even hesitated. The first assignment he had set had been turned in a day early by the kid, and Tony… Tony had been genuinely impressed with it. A week later, Fury had agreed to let him have an intern working part time in his lab at SHIELD, and now here they are.
He loves him, has loved him for a while now.
“I was…busy.” A camera-ready smile, and he can see the expression on Obie’s face, and he knows he’s bought the lie, or at least accepts it for now.
The POV's also switch a couple of times throughout this but I think it's pretty clear so :)
“What,” Steve says quietly, “is that supposed to mean?”
He only sees the Captain nod once before Tony is out of the door, bolting up the stairs to the room number Nat had texted him about.
Rhodey has done this before countless times.  Over and over in the summer, and over and over throughout their time at MIT, when Tony had come back from visiting his mother and father, and spent hours throwing up, hours panicking, hours just hugging Rhodey.
Nat rolls her eyes, taking another aspirin.
Tony turns his full attention on Steve, narrowing his eyes slightly. “I told you, I left. I have no way of knowing. It’s no longer any of my business anyway. Plus I thought you had wiped out Hydra completely until about two minutes ago.”
“You look great.”
“I’m sorry I couldn’t be here sooner. Pepper called me after she got the news about your parents. I called in a couple of favours, got the next flight over.”
Panic. This is the panic that he’s been avoiding for weeks now, slamming into him in waves. His voice sounds young,
Can’t you knock or something?”
They would have taken him, tortured him until he broke, and then killed him. All so Obadiah Stane could have his moment in the spotlight, could get a tiny fraction of power back, could finally win.
Tony offers him a cookie with a grin, and Steve wonders when the billionaire had figured out all of Nat’s food hiding places. He smiles a little at the thought of Tony looking for the cookies, but shakes his head at the offer. Not hungry this early in the morning.
Rhodey shrugs. “I usually would be against blackmail, seeing as it’s illegal and all of that. But if anyone deserves to have his life utterly ruined, it’s Obadiah Stane.”
“If you ever want to share some details-”
“You wanted coffee, right?”
Again.
Sometimes, Tony hates his brain.
“Officially, I'm not even here. Those cameras you keep looking at?” An icy smile. “They’re mine. I hacked them an hour ago. This meeting never happened.”
can’t be selfish with Steve. But he wants to be, more than he’s wanted anything ever.
It feels like coming home.
Jesus this isn’t fucking
Tony laughs, calling the waitress over to order drinks. It’s not amusing. Frankly, he doesn’t give a
He’s not going to cry, he’s
As he stands, Howard grabs his wrist, and Tony flinches. Hard. It’s the opposite of Steve’s gentle grip. Tight enough to bruise. His heart is thudding in his chest, and he’s not really sure if he’s breathing anymore. They’re in a restaurant, it’s fine, it’s fine-
Steve turns as someone steps out of the group. He’s tall, clean-shaven, with a dark patch over one eye. His smile is terrifying. Tony matches it with one of his own.
Steve’s arms come up to wrap around him, pulling him even closer, and
No matter what he says, he knows how this shitshow ends.
She knows Ty’s name, Steve told her in the car. He’s unbelievably grateful that she doesn’t say it though. Steve glances at Tony, gauging his reaction. For a second, there’s a flash of savage pleasure in his face before it rearranged into something more neutral. Steve wonders where and
Tony’s voice comes back to him, laced with a wicked humour.
All other thoughts leave his head because she-
. “Definitely agree.”
Steve looks vaguely uncomfortable. “I can come back for it tomorrow, there’s no rush-”
“What do you mean?”
“Sorry. He was meant to leave an hour ago.”
It’s a restless sleep, filled with dead eyes, and shark smiles and a distinct lack of warmth.
“There’s a
He thinks of the drawing in the last page of Steve's sketchbook, it seems like a lifetime ago.
He considers calling Ty again, just for the sake of it, or maybe finding one of the far too many women desperate for a few hours in his bed.
. So I’m definitely allowed to treat you.”
Steve ignores that last request, following Tony to the door yet again.
She winks. “If you trade off sex with him for morning shifts Steve, I’ll fire you.”
likes him.
, his hand is so
Tony meets his gaze steadily, forcing himself to breathe. “Natasha, Fury, you. That’s it.”
“Can I take you out to dinner handsome.”
“Can we have some bottled water and two cappelletti in brodo di cappone?”
By the time he becomes Iron Man, the world has forgotten his grief. No one cared enough about Maria to grieve for her apart from Tony, and they no longer mourn Howard either. Instead, they turn towards Tony for the solutions to every problem they might have.
Obadiah shrugs, eyes flashing with ire. “I’m sure whatever you have to say is fascinating, so by all means.”
He’s not breathing. He’s not fucking breathing. When Tony speaks again, his voice is something he doesn’t recognise. It’s low, dangerous.
“Well someone had to chase after you.”
Rhodey shrugs, a grin tugging at his lips. “It was karma. We’re fine now, don’t panic Tones.”
So he just shakes his head, pulling away with a smile that he knows Steve doesn’t believe. When he lets his hands drop, something in Tony aches for the warmth to return. It’s fine. He can get coffee on the way to work. It’s
“I know,” Tony grins. “This is my ultimate playing card. The pasta here is some of the best in the world apart from in Italy.”
Two hours later, Steve and Tony are outside of Obadiah Stane’s office, and Steve can feel his heart in his throat. They’re both in suits, and Steve dimly that notices how goddamn
Tony blinks at him slowly, and then nods. “Yeah. Yeah I know I just- how did I not see it?”
A click, and the other person hangs up. When he puts his phone away, Obadiah's eyebrows are raised. Tony shakes his head with a wave of dismissal.
“What the
“Nope.” Tony's grip tightens slightly, and Steve forces his eyes open. “Don’t you dare fall asleep right now. Steve? I’ve called an ambulance, you have to stay awake.”
Clint shrugs. “Win-win. If he is, you win, because I
The doorbell rings and Tony rolls his eyes, padding over to open it.
The fountain explodes.
“Hey mom.” He whispers, swallowing past the lump in his throat. “I miss you. A lot.”
He takes a deep breath, adjusting his iron grip on the stupid amount of emotions that are making it had to get air into his lungs. He pulls the pair of dark sunglasses out of his pocket, sliding them on. He hasn’t worn them in a while, hasn’t had the need to.
“Tony.” she says quietly, touching his arm. “Sei in silenzio stasera.” [2]
Peter side eyes him, and Tony can’t work out his expression. “Thanks. So why are you early? And don’t deflect the question.”
That’s Steve and he has no goddamn clue why Steve is here or
It’s still dark outside, but there’s a shaft of light from a street lamp through the window. Steve looks beautiful like this, all soft edges smoothed by sleep and those goddamn
