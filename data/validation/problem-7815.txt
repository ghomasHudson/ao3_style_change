“Okay, fine. Let me show you.” Tony moved past Nat and into the closet, and she heard him rustling some things around before he reappeared in the doorway carrying a rather large contraption, concealed with a pink blanket that was draped over it. He set it on the floor between the two of them.
“Chocolate is sweet,” Nat corrected, “what these two have going is something else.”
Tony had no problem giving in now.
“Oh my god,” Nat groaned, “This can’t possibly be happening again, right?”
She didn’t know what was going on, but she knew she didn’t want to make things any worse. She followed the path Tony had taken, and plopped down next to him, laying her head on his shoulder.
“Because it does? I just told you-“
Nat flipped her hair dramatically, and Tony just shook his head at her, a smile starting to break across his features.
“Fine. He’s gonna go for a run. At 5, he’s gonna wake up, and go for a stupid run. But you proved nothing! You knew it too, so what,
Tony rolled his eyes, smiling, and then continued, “The guy, Matty, he puts tiny cardboard Jenna’s—Jenna is the name of the girl he loves—in the house, doing Jenna things, like reading this magazine she’s obsessed with, and he does the same with himself, and the whole thing is decorated in this way that’s so simple but, also it kind of shows that he knows her better than anyone else? And there’s obviously so much thought that went into it, you know? And, well, I don’t wanna spoil the movie, but,”
“Oh, I don’t know,” he waved his hand at her dismissively, without actually turning around to face her, “I probably became a fan subconsciously or something, I mean I
please just, tell me what’s up?”
“And it looks lovely on you, Nat,” Steve declared.
This wasn’t something that happened regularly, or ever, if Nat’s memory served her right. Sure, she and Tony were close, but he also had a lot of pride; he never wanted to feel weak or dependent. Thus, he wouldn’t usually resort to finding solace in his friend’s rooms in the middle of the night, even if the inconvenience of his frequent nightmares might beg him to do exactly that, all the time.
they saw.
Nat was pretty close with Tony, and she knew him—she
nocturnal. You do know that, right?”
“Oh, she is. Big time. We definitely owe her for, well, you know. This.”
unaware that he actually thinks I don’t reciprocate? Steve, I know this is like, a ‘moment,’ and everything, but look—I’m going to ruin it, okay? Because, well, because it’s sort of totally necessary that I say this.” There was a small, but definitive, moment of silence. And then, “You - Captain - are absolutely infuriating.”
the crazy one, but I really don’t think I was doing the whole ‘what if’ thing. All I said was that I
“Geez, Nat, give me a minute, would you?”
“No, no—yes, I get it. I understand your
He could feel the way Steve’s heartbeat picked up, and as far as Tony was concerned, that was his new crowning achievement. Steve Rogers, blushing all the way down to his chest, grinning from ear to ear, unable to stop his heart from giving him away. It was, quite possibly, the greatest thing Tony had ever seen. And he’d seen Nat take out six bad guys in the same span of time it takes Mr. Rogers here to flip a single pancake. So. There’s that.
He paused for a split second, and then, “Me, specifically. I ... I love you. Um, I don’t think I’ve said that, yet? I think I said ‘in love,’ but I don’t ... I’m not sure if—oh well. I’m saying it now.”
Steve continued the story.
Steve could hear, of course, but he wasn’t freaking out, not in the way he thought he would’ve, or maybe should’ve, been. Once the initial shock of Tony actually speaking to him again wore off, Steve realized he was just happy to hear his friend’s voice, context—and potential disaster incoming—be damned.
“Hey,” Tony said, softly, when she opened the door. He looked worse than he had the day Nat was interrogating him in his lab.
Tony tried again, “So, I was asking why you picked right now, three days before Christmas, at an absurdly late hour of the night, to torture me with what ifs about my love life, which, by the way, is already smack dab in the middle of falling apart and is, in fact, the entire reason I’m sitting here next to you right now?”
It’s cute. Gross, but cute.”
“You didn’t know what, Tony?”
And Tony can’t believe he’s found him. Or, rather, recognized him, finally, as exactly what he’d hoped at the sky for.
Nat was pretty confident that he believed her, like he knew that all along and just needed to be reminded. She smiled to herself.
Tony didn’t move, he just turned his face away from Steve and crossed his arms over his chest, refusing to give in.
There was nothing better than Thor on Christmas day. Because Christmas didn’t exist on Asgard, this was only Thor’s third or fourth year experiencing it, and you could tell. He had the pure, enchanted enthusiasm of a child, and it was infectious.
“I’m talking catastrophically unaware, Rogers. And honestly, this one’s kind of on you, I mean, I’m just a guy in a suit, and being a mess is one of my—many—charms.
"And Toni's lectures are always funny, well if they aren't directed at you," Bruce said.
Maria Hill looked at him sideways. "Then why did you ask?"
"I won't let anything happen to you, Toni," Barnes reinsured her, snapping her out of her thoughts. He was looking back to her with a smile.
The idea of Toni leaving the Tower and heading to Malibu didn't sit well with him at all. Yes, he knew she had a house there, and stayed there a lot throughout the year, but he didn't want her to leave like this. Without another word, he made his way over to Toni, who looked up as she heard his feet steps. Their eyes met, and no one said anything for a while.
"Toni," he said into her hair line as he held her tight, and he held her for a few seconds before he spoke again. He pushed her back slightly to take a look at her, but he didn't let go. "Are you okay? Did they hurt you? Did you need any medical attention? Are you okay?" He was just rambling off so many questions that she couldn't possibly answered.
." There were no words to describe how cruel his voice sounded. It was horrible. "They would be dancing on your grave."
Toni's eyes twitched as the sound of his voice. It was sickly sweet. "Who is this Nancy? And do I need to save her from you?" she asked.
Rogers was wearing a long sleeve dress shirt, which didn't seem to provide him with any warmth. "I'm not going to let a lady freeze." He smiled his innocent cute smile. "And we almost at my apartment. I'm fine."
Steve let Bucky walk pass him before he said anything. "This is about me wanting to join the army, isn't it?"
Salty let out a laugh. "I knew you would say that," he chuckled as he glanced her over.
Toni's head snapped up at the voice; her heartbeat raced as she noticed Schmidt, who was staring at her with such a look that she felt her soul shake. "Are you a Borg now?" She asked.
What did this woman do? What did she have on him? It wasn't pain like his handlers. Did she want to control him? Did she want to use him? Or was it something else? It didn't seem like she wanted to control him, but the Asset didn't know what else she could want with him, and it left him with questions. Questions, he couldn't answer. Questions, he wasn't used to, as he hadn't been awake long enough for questions to form. Plus, questions were considered unacceptable. He wasn't allowed to have questions. He was a weapon, and weapons did not think.
On the ground a few feet away from her, the two officers, who had been guarding the entrance, were lying on the ground. She wasn't sure if they were dead but she didn't want to find out, not when the person who did this was still out there. Knowing from the many horror movies she had watched, it was never a good idea to run into the darkness as that was normally where the murderer killed you.
Yes, Tony did hold it against him at first and was ready to throw the book at him. He was willing and did go to war with Rogers, but that's the past, and Tony wants to keep it there. Those days were bloody, painful times that will haunt Tony's dreams for years. For a while, he had thought the only way to end the war was for one of them to die, and towards the end, Tony had thought it would be him. He was ready in fact as he was the one that the world needed less.
"All I need is some sleep," she replied, turning back to him. He was also wrong about letting people in. If she let people in, she was opening a door to being hurt, and she was hurting enough as it was.
"Yes," Steve answered.
Getting to her feet, she crossed to the mirror in the room, which she was surprised he had. Toni took a long look at herself, and she had to give it to herself. She did beat Rogers in one thing, even if she was a hot mess, and that was being hot. Roger couldn't even touch that; however, she knew at this time (still unsure of what year it was) though, he was cuter. "Toni, Toni. What am I going to do with you?" she asked with a small smile.
"Yes, Miss Stark. I do know how impatient you are."
Hello
As Steve stared wide eye at her, his anger grew. He couldn't believe how reckless Toni was. Did she not understand what she was doing? "Hey!" He yelled, getting their attention. "Are you nuts?"
"No big deal?" Steve asked, pissed. "You have a-"
Jones lean forward, looking like he was trying to get up but failing. "Toni," he called, softly.
She let out a chuckling sigh. "And you still wanted to play chase?"
"Don't you even think about it! I will bite off fingers. I mean it."
"I'm peachy," she replied, as she narrowed her eyes at him. It was the same answer that she had given her father, and it would be the same answer that she would give Phillips.
She popped up, shocked that Sassy even asked. "Did you just ask if Steve and I are dating?" she asked, coughing. That got her heart beat up.
Jim gave her a hard look, a clear sign that he wasn't backing down. "No, I can't go into battle with someone I can't trust."
*O*O*
Toni had no interest in going back, even with the dropping temperature. She didn't care that her body was about to drop, and she even wished for it. Her nightmare—No Nightmares. Too many to count. She wasn't sure she wanted to count, but the number didn't matter, as the Nightmares—No matter the number- were still fresh in her head, and no matter what she did, she couldn't rid herself of
Somehow, someway, Toni found her way to the lab, which was just pure dumb luck. It was a random choice that Toni made based on the windows, which were covered. With a sore body and feet, she rushed over to the building and pushed through the doorway. To her joy, she guessed right.
battle with Skully as Zola had given them what they needed to finish off Schmidt for good. "You should stay behind and rest," Peggy replied, stepping to Toni's side.
"Why are you out of bed, Dollface?" James asks as he tries to get the genius back into bed. His grip is soft but firm, and it's hard to put up much of a fight against the former assassin. "You need to be resting."
"But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain. Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?" Schmidt said, glaring the Captain. It was quite clear that he wanted to kill the man in front of him and he would enjoy doing it.
Toni tried to wave it off, but she was only able to move her hand a few inches off the table. "I'm not going to tell you anything, because I didn't do anything," she stated, changing the subject. She didn't want his pity and if she could move, she would throw something at him.
Phillips stepped away from the table and walked to the door in silence. As he reached the door, he turned around and spoke, "You cannot judge a person when she knows you're watching. It's when she thinks no one is watching that you judge. We'll see who she is then."
It took her eyes a few painfully long seconds to adjust to the excruciatingly bright light, which seemed to get brighter as the time went by. The genius wished someone would turn the lights down, but she knew that wouldn't happen. The people who had her would do whatever it took to wear her down and take what they wanted. Toni wished she knew what they wanted, because this getting kidnap was getting old fast, especially when she had no idea of why they were kidnapping her.
Toni jumped as she felt a hand on her shoulder. "Mother fucker!"
"She is currently in Central Park," the AI replied.
Steve, fighting his negative thoughts, didn't look at the file until he had gotten back to his small messy apartment. He usually was very organized as messes weren't tolerated in the army, but he couldn't find the urge to clean up the tossed files on the floor. Those files were painful reminders to something that he had lost to the hands of time. It weighted heavily on his mind that he was the alone, which was probably why he was pushing so hard to find Toni.
Though Rogers pissed her the hell off, it irritated her to hear his best friend say that, but she didn't say anything. She didn't want to start with a fight with a man, who if she thought about it, she didn't really trust. She didn't care if he was a sex god. As she looked him over from head to toe, she cursed her body's desire to jump him. WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? She knew she couldn't have him, which made him so much more desirable. She always had a thing for men she couldn't have. Shaking her head, she knew it was stupid to fall for a guy who was going to die. That just screamed commitment issues, didn't it?
So i hope you like it. :)
Natasha looked annoyed, but she didn't say anything. She wanted to be piss at SHIELD, but she knew where they were coming from. Banner for example couldn't always control the Hulk and he could destroy a whole city, so SHIELD would need a way to stop him. Clint had turned on them already (sure not of his own will), but he had cause a great amount of destruction. With the Iron Man suit, it was possible for someone or something to steal it or recreate a suit like it, which had happened before. They needed something to stop a suit like that. However, that didn't mean she wouldn't let SHIELD have it if something did happen to Toni.
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets." She looked at him for one more second before she turned to Bruce. "It's bugging him too, isn't it?" she said, point to Banner.
Hey all,
Natasha gave Rhodes a look, studying him. "You think those two will last?" she asked.
He yells into the comm as the Winter Soldier doesn't reply quickly enough.
Steve glanced at Toni, smiling once more. "It takes some getting used to, but I had help." His smile could light up the night—anyone who disagreed with that get an Iron Man kick to the knees. "And it's good to meet you, Sam."
However, Tony is willing to look past this, because he knows he's being crazy. He knows it's his insecurities talking, and if he listens to them, he knows he'll lose it. He knows he'll push everything he has away, and he knows he'll lose the Super Soldiers, which is the last thing that he wants. Besides, he knows he's overreacting, and waking up alone isn't the worst thing ever. It isn't the end of the world, and he shouldn't read too much into it.
"Oh, he lives!" Wilson utters, with a smile on his face.
"S-Toni," he uttered as he tried some random codes. "Please let me in." He sounded weak, and it almost broke her. The way he said her name did not help as it made her heart miss a beat.
His face lit up. "You're such a ball of fun."
When Toni came too, her ankle was throbbing, and the ice pack had long lost its coldness—though it had fallen off during the middle of the night in her twists and turns. However, Steve had remained close, holding her in his warm embrace. Even when they both had fallen into a deep sleep, Steve's grip on her hadn't died, and it was as strong as ever. The only thing that had shifted was Toni's position and Steve now spooning her.
"Men," she spouted as she walked away. She didn't see his smile but she knew he was smiling. This was the first conversation that they had together since the diner. Though she wouldn't admit it, she had been avoiding him as she was waiting for him to yell at her. Taking a deep breath, she took a seat on the couch. The tools that she had brought were hidden in a bag under the table, which the guys hadn't noticed yet.
The sun had yet to come up fully when Toni awake from her nightmare. It was just breaking through the distant clouds, signaling how early it was. There was still a chill in the air from the night sky and a morning frost lined the grass. "S-Steve," she choked out, mindlessly reaching for him. However, to her displeasure, his side of the bed was empty and
That is all folks.
Anyhow, until next time!
The Captain had jumped from many planes; it was nothing new to him. He wasn't afraid of the height; he wasn't afraid of falling. He usually didn't worry, but this time, he couldn't keep his mind off Toni. With her mouth, she could get in some deep trouble, and he was afraid of that now. There was no telling what would happen to her down there with Thor and Loki.
Hiding her shook, the genius up played her tones. "For what? Did I miss something?"
Toni glanced down at her broken arm, as it was useless. Even if she was able to hack into that company, the cast would only slow her down and probably get her caught, which was something she couldn't afford. It would also be very stupid to rush in without a second thought, and Toni Stark was not stupid. There was no telling what kind of defenses her father had, but they had to be excellent for the time even if they couldn't compare to her time; however, she knew her father would probably fight her on that.
At the same time, Barton shook his head. "Not the time, Stark. Not the time." He was calmed, but there was an edge to his tone. He reached behind his back for another arrow, drawing quickly. He didn't look away from his target, his eyes glued on him.
Toni turned back to Sam, studying the man. Why did matter to him? What game was he playing?
Toni turned to the monitors and gasped. Rogers' group, who were being pushed back, were handling themselves at least, while the second group was not. They appeared to need some help. It shocked Toni that a small base had so many soldiers, but she knew that she shouldn't have been. This base was important. It held some important secrets, which they had been trying to steal.
"Never too early to start looking for the best for my child," he countered.
*O*O*
"JARVIS, are getting this?" Toni asked, forcing her inventor side down. Now was not the time to be drooling over a metal arm, especially when that man was attacking Steve. However, she
Toni exhaled, harshly. "It is, and if you and Agent Carter need a recommendation for a restaurant, don't ask me. I usually just skip that step in the date if you know what I mean," she said, winking while forcing a smirk on her lips.
The left side of her shirt hung lower than the right side, as it was not correctly button. She released whatever she held and tucked it in her shirt. "Oh, wait. I forgot that it's my fault. Always my fault," she snapped, turning back to the door.
spy, a man who had probably saved the world more times than anyone knew. Though he couldn't go hand to hand against Thor, there was no doubt that he could get it done, which was why it felt so wrong seeing him like this.
Toni drowned in her emotions for a few seconds, wondering how much of a pain and torture it was for Steve to be here. Did he really hate being here? Did he hate this sun? Did he miss the white Christmas that he had growing up? There was no doubt that he was a Brooklyn Boy through and through, and he belonged in New York, but did—
"Need…awake," the first one said, as he patted her cheek with something wet.
Smelling something burning, Toni responded—adding very dramatically, "Are you burning my pancakes? Steve, not my pancakes! I love pancakes, especially if they have chocolate chips in them."
She didn't know if she should be insulted or touched by what he said, so she picked insulted. Toni could never go wrong with that. "I'm quite capable in taking care of myself, you know." She held her broken arm close to her body.
"Toni?" Howard asked, his anger disappearing. He had noticed her eyes widen at the sight of the water.
Tony's eyebrow rises, as he feels every eye on him. He doesn't know what they're thinking, but he doesn't need to now. "On your date?" he asks. "Ha Ha. Funny. Almost believed you meant that." The genius waves them off as he heads toward the door.
"What do you mean my 'condition'?" she asked, confused as to what he was talking about. She didn't have a condition, well… besides the shrapnel in her body; however, that didn't affect her drinking ability.
Steve glanced Rumlow, willing him to keep force on his equipment and his team. "We're about to go to jump. We can't be…" He paused, as his jaw locked in place. "Like this." His voice was tight. This could make it worst, but he had to do something.
The asshole struggled to get to his feet. "That wasn't very nice. Someone should teach you matters. I would be happy to do so." He stepped to her, too close for Toni's liking, but she did not move. She stared him down. "You have some balls."
"There're no denying that, but look at you! You're a dirty, old man, Captain Rogers, and you know it! You're just lucky that you're a fine piece of meat."
Though Steve hadn't had many one on one conversions with the man—only talking to him when Toni was around, he hadn't even heard this man angry. Even when Toni had almost blew herself up countless times, Jim—sure, irate—was never this level of mad, which meant something
It was that emptiness that filled him every moment of every day, but after one of his kills, that changed. For once, he thought something as one of his targets was familiar to the Asset. It felt like he knew this man, but that didn't stop the Asset from killing him. There wasn't even blink of hesitation in his man. He didn't allow this familiarity to stop him, even if it made him wonder who this man was. Did he know this man? If so, how?
The look on Steve's face fell slightly as he got down on his knees and settled next to her. "There's a bigger tree at the tower," he said with a smile as large as his face. He paused for a second, allowing the smile to reach his eyes. "And there is snow in New York. A few feet I hear. Enough to jump in. Want to make snow angels?"
"Hey!"
However, just as he kicks his feet over the edge, the door to his room flies open, slamming hard against the wall. The loud thud snaps Tony back to reality, and it feels like someone has stolen his breath. Forcing himself to take a few deep breaths, he stills as he knows who it is before they even step into the room. He fights back his groan as their footsteps echo across the floor. Why couldn't they have held off a few minutes? He could've been gone…He could've been hidden. He isn't ready for this. He isn't ready to lose the two best things in his life, but it will happen and he knows it. Neither Rogers nor Barnes look happy.
That was exactly it; he didn't think a woman could do it, but she knew it was a common belief in this time. At least, Salty believed in her. "You can't tell me what to do, Rogers."
Blood dripped down her arm as she pulled the IV. The skin on her chest stung as she yanked the heart monitors off. The machine peeped a few times, but she was able to yank the plug out before it went off. "I need to go."
With his back to him and the agent, he didn't watch them leave. He stepped back to the typewriter and stared at the paper for a few seconds before he glanced up in the direction of Carter and Rogers. He did feel bad, but it wasn't anything that he hadn't felt before.
Shaking his head, Jim took a step toward his best friend. "Oh, god no," he groaned. "I do not need to hear that!"
Toni crossed to the knife and picked it up. "I do," she answered as she played with the blade. She had read about that mad man in a few of her father's journals. Schmidt's technology was ahead of its time and her father had-would spend months trying to figure it out.
"Geez," he whined, with a hint of laugher. "I feel insulted."
"O', I got the last name," he stated as he played hurt. "Why-"
Phillips stopped and looked at her. "How do you know about the Super Soldier Project?" he asked. He looked at her. "I didn't think you were a spy but now I do."
"Wasn't a request," Rumlow stated, still wearing a smile. "Rollins, here, will take you here to headquarters to see Pierce, while I collect Rogers. We may even let you fix up that suit of yours in one of labs."
Steve turned to Toni, eyeing her, before he stepped aside to let Pepper and Rhodes by. In a matter of seconds, Toni was in Pepper's embrace. "Toni," she said, crying lightly.
"You wouldn't want that," the man said, as he stepped toward her. He walked with a hop in his step as he was attempting to be cool. With the oversize clothes and sagging pants, it looked like trying too hard to be younger than he was. The tattoo on his face popped out at Toni as she tried to figure out what it was for a few long seconds. "A pretty little thing like yourself will only get hurt in Central Park at this time of night. There're scary things in here."
Toni was beginning to wonder why she wanted to come back to these people. All they did was tease and her. "Hey, can you blame me? I can only handle you people for so long."
With a sigh, Peggy turned slightly and stepped to the sleeping Howard, who was snoring softly. "I never realized he snored," she replied. "Might have to record this and tease him with it later."
Trig let out a howling laugh as he stepped back and turned to Gabe and Dum Dum. "I wasn't aware you knew Toni Stark personally, Grandpa. Geez, who else do you know? Do you know the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders? If so, you should totally introduce me to me."
love him either. Not at all, though he gets that weird feeling in his chest each time he sees him. He isn't sure why this happens as they had always fought like cats and dogs. There is and was never a time that they didn't, but he feels something for the blond, the likes he never knew. However, he refuses to knowledge or speak it out loud. It won't end well if he does.
The genius struggled in her zip ties, almost to the point of blood. She didn't need to look to at her wrists to know they were red and seconds away from splitting open. "Maya," she uttered, ignoring the armed guards from the Pony express in the room eyeing her. "Why do you have to be such an idiot?"
"I'm but still can't sleep," he replied, allowing Bruce to change the subject. However, he didn't like the idea of using the Tesseract. "And I'm stuck on the sidelines."
need him. She could get along without him just she always did, because she did not need anyone.
She smirked as she came across the room that held her device. She almost didn't believe it that she made it through the building without getting caught. She tried to open the door, but not to her surprise, the door was locked. There was nothing to hack and she would've to pick the lock the old fashion way. She got down on her knees and took out one of picks. Keeping an eye on video feed, she started to pick it. She twisted the metal shaft, but the lock didn't click. Instead, the tool slapped in her hand. "Fuck," she cursed.
"And we can do this later," Steve sneered.
Even if made her skin craw and her short of breath, Toni wondered for a second if the water would feel differently if she just jumped in clothes and all? She was already shivering, already freezing. Already panicking. She was already at the brink, where there was no turning back. No saving herself. Against her better judgement, she wondered if she would sink to the bottom, weighed down in wet clothes. She wondered how long it would take her to die like this. How long would it take for the water to enter into her lungs? How painful would it be?
He yells at himself. He's acting like an idiot, unStark like. "Like something you see, Barton?" he asks, while smirking and taking a seat next to Natasha.
The genius didn't let the AI finish, ending the call. As JARVIS was sending the suit, there was nothing else that she needed from him. Now, she just had to wait for the suit, which should only take a minute or two; however, Toni was never any good at waiting. Bad things happened when she was waiting with nothing to do. She tended to do stupid shit- well depending on who you ask- when she had on her hands. On the other hand, she had no interest at the moment to do anything, feeling like she had been ran over by a truck.
"So in other words no," Toni translated, bitterly. She didn't know what she was expecting but she would've thought that they knew something. Someone had attacked her and it wasn't random. Someone was after her for a reason. Did they know she was from a future? If not that, were they after her because she was a genius? It had her worried, because if they didn't know the reason, they couldn't figure out who it was. "What have you guys been doing?"
"Earth to Rogers. Is everything okay in that head of yours?"
She snorted again. "Well, according to me I am, but I don't think anyone else will agree."
Rogers—No, Steve. If the Captain and Barnes are going to tell him that they love him, then he better use their first names. Steve doesn't move from him. "Yes, we are. I've been in love with you for years, but I was too scared to tell you. I wasn't sure how you would react, and when I realized that I was being an idiot, it was too late. Bucky was back and you wouldn't even look at me. I thought you hated me, and I decided to let myself have what I wanted since I was a child. I let myself have Bucky, but there's still something missing. It took me awhile, and Buck was the one who realized it first. It's you, and it isn't too late. I just have to say it. We love you."
Her guilt and sadness over Bucky's death was getting to her more than she ever thought possible. How could she get over this when she could've stopped it? She knew he was going to die, and she let it happen… Then there was also the fact that she cared for Bucky, and now he was gone. She was never good at saying good-bye.
"Miss Potts is on the line and wishes to speak with you," the AI replied.
While Pepper moved from the closet to Toni's dresser, the genius eyed Pepper, her closest dearest friend, in shock. For once, she was speechless, unable to think of something to say. What could she say? She didn't want to start a fight with Pepper, not after everything. She couldn't lose another person in her life, not right now. Not so soon after Bucky and her father.
"Me careful?" She laughed. "You're funny." She pushed him away slightly so she could look up at him. She was worried about him being this close and noticing the glow, but she realized that he wasn't anywhere else but her eyes. "There's no fun in that..." She could feel the heat buildup in her cheeks.
The future Genius hoped to be gone by the time he figured it out, because she didn't want to be here when he learned that she was his daughter. "Well, it's a time travel device! For you see, I'm from the future and I'm stuck in the past until I fix it. How could you not figure it out? There was so many clues," she stated with a smile. However, at the moment there was no way he could believe her, and he may even discredit later on his own if she said it first.
"Why don't you tell us about it?" Toni said, suddenly realizing that she wanted to know how Steve and Bucky, the Brooklyn Twins, spend their Christmas. Sure, she had been in the past during the Christmas season, but it passed without any one really noticing.
"If was a bomb, I wouldn't just have got a broken arm. And it wasn't like I did it on purpose," Toni stated.
Steve tasted as peppermint, and though Toni wasn't normally into peppermint, she was loving it at this moment. She was loving the feeling of his lips against hers, as he explored her mouth. She really loved the feeling of having his body pressed against hers with his arm hands against her back. If they could stay like this forever, she would. He made her chest tighten with every smile and look, making her feel like some young virgin—which she was not. He made her knees buckle from underneath her as he ran his hands up her back. His hands felt amazing against her bare skin that—
"Does the world know much blood is on your hands? Does Stevie know? Does he?"
Said genius jumped when she felt a hand on her shoulder. Her heartbeat raced as she glanced up to see Peggy, trying to offer some kind of support. It shocked Toni how comforting the Agent was, when she was in so much pain after losing the Captain, a man that she loved. "I'm fine," she replied, stepping out of Peggy's hand.
Clint was not happy. No, he was downright pissed; besides the fact that he felt left out of the 'let's kick everyone's ass' group, (Hello, Nat was
"When's that? When you're leaving?" she asked, showing him her spunk. "You think that's better?"
With her shaking uncontrollably, it took a good few minutes for Toni to control herself. However, no matter how much time she gave herself, she was still shivering, even with the heavy (though not heavy enough) poncho. Stupid itchy poncho. "Fuck me," she cursed as she grabbed the payphone. Even in her frozen and annoyed state, she was amazed that there was even a working payphone, though she was thankful. She didn't know what she would've done if she hadn't come across it.
Wait…What? Her device? How could he have her device? It wasn't possible, but then what was it? Knowing it couldn't be the same device that forced her into the past, she knew it was a different one. Did he make a new device? How so? Yes, he was smart, but how did he figure out how to build one with incomplete blue prints? Did he really create to make a functional device? Or was this simply a failed look alike that Bruce was willing to work?
Howard's grip tightened around her. "I know, Toni. I know," he said, his voice trembling.
"I have no interest in playing chase, though it seems that you enjoy it." She snorted, but before she could open her mouth, he added, "You're falling into my trap. There's no chase." He took a step toward her.
The colonel had left a few hours ago and Toni hadn't seen anyone since, which pissed her off even more. Her back was starting hurt from the hard metal death trap, and she needed more pain medication. The pain had come back full force, and she was ready to snap. Plus, it was freezing in this room.
"I know, but there was a reason why you didn't. Though no one could name all of the risks, it would set something off," he said, rubbing her back. "I'm not a time traveler, but I think that is rule one of the hand book, right? I might need to look at your rulebook to see, though." He added a laugh.
"So your device is working?" he asked, still holding the file, but his focus was still on her.
"It wasn't," she countered. "And besides, you had already made up for it… Dad." The word felt weird on her tongue, but the look on her father's face was priceless.
This is basically a bonus. Someone (Can't remember who) had asked for a Bucky POV, so I decided to give you want. I wasn't planning on writing an other BUCKY POV so soon, but here you go.
Every part of his body was telling him not to promise that. His very breath was taken away from him at the very thought of not seeing her again, and it made his heart ache. However, he knew Dugan was right. He had to stay away from her, because if he didn't, he could change the whole time line, though he wasn't sure how much of the time line would be different since she messed it up in the first place. "I promise."
"I needed some air, and running clears my head," he said, looking forward. He had a goofy smile on his face that could make anyone smile, including Toni.
With his annoyance growing, Steve swung his left arm forward, bring his shield down on his foe's chest. It broke his chest like butter, making a sickness sound as he killed him. It was harder than he intended, but his anger drove him forward as he just wanted Barton to shut it. However, you couldn't just tell Clint to shut up, as that would just keep him going, knowing that he had you. "Did you complete the objective?" He asked, pulling back his arm.
"Don't tell me what to do," Toni snapped annoyed. She hated when people told her what to do.
"Big Sap." She let out a chuckle, as she reached up and placed her hands his wrists. "Fine, but it doesn't mean I'm letting you call the shots. I wear the pants in this relationships."
." How in the hell did he get that rank? She wanted to punch the person who gave it to him. "But I don't care! Just go."
*O*O*
Toni could hear the panic in the young boy's voice, and she almost felt guilty, not that as she could at the moment. There was only one emotion screaming in her head, making everything else feel distance and cold. "Right, and then you said it, by name, while denying having said it!" she said, loudly as she leaned backward toward the car.
"Then there're the calls from the reporters," Pepper added. "They're like sharks who smell blood in the water. A warning would've been nice!"
*O*O*
*O*O*
Toni smiled at him. "Damn straight." Even when she was back in the future, she would still be playing that card on Captain Rogers. "Besides, I'm not mad. Just annoyed. You can't keep fighting guys who are bigger than you."
Toni didn't know how long she could be able to keep this up, considering she felt like death. Granted, they did drive into a tree going 60 miles per hour and she was lucky to be alive. She was going to be sore for a while…well that was if she made it. "Not now." She hissed. She didn't have the time for a petty party.
That was Steve's fear, but if that was the case, he needed to know, so he could move on. "And what about you?"
"Bringing Ms. Stark back," Trip replied. "She's a handful."
Just like that, he lost his Captain's cool. He turned back into that hot mess he was a few moments ago. "What do you mean you lost the trail?" Steve snapped, his hand shaking at his side. It took everything that he had not to flip this fucken table right now. Shit, what? Okay, he had to take few deep breaths. This could not be good for anyone. He was high-strung right now and he knew it, but he didn't realize how bad it was. He was ready to punch someone.
“I have no record of an invitation, sir.”
He moves toward the table behind Tony, picking up the slips of paper that make up the schematics of the suit. Tony’s heart rate picks up, even though he knew that there was no way for the man to know what all the plans make together unless he aligns them correctly over a light source. “But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. And soon, it will be my turn.”
Tony can hear Pepper in his ear. “It’s ready, Tony! Get off the roof!”
(Though it only came after Tony prodded Rhodey a little.
It was worse because Steve could’ve stopped this. He was only a few feet away. If he had just heard. If he had just taken his time to get in the shower. If he had just laid with Tony content in bed for just a little bit longer.
“No, no, no,” Tony reassures, “I swear Rhodey that is not what happened. It’s not what you’re thinking.”
“Don’t let them find out I’m in Heat! You need to help me through this, please!” Tony all but cries out.
was the best thing that had ever happened to him. Steve was damn well lucky HYDRA hadn’t given him the chair in the past two years, and he wasn’t going to risk that in any way. He wasn’t going to risk losing the best thing that’s ever happened to him. Even if Tony decided to leave him, to end whatever it was that they were, he would still have the memories, and maybe that would be enough.
. You should’ve come to the house. You could’ve come and seen your godkids, but you didn’t. Now, we’re waiting on you. Let’s go. Come on.” Tony waltzes into the aircraft without letting Rhodey get another word in. Rhodey just shakes his head in exasperation and follows.
Pepper glares. “Okay, okay, I’m going.”
“Well, I don’t remember all of my husband’s fuck buddies. There’s just too many of them.”
reputation. A cover for his indiscretions. I have no wish to join you, but if you want your fifteen seconds of fame, write an article about sleeping with the power couple of the business world. In fact, if you’re going to say something, make sure it’s about me and Obie, not just Obie; that’s in the NDA too.”
Tony makes his way to the front of the house, spotting Obie with a blonde Beta woman. The woman spots Tony first and becomes slightly startled. Tony doesn’t know if it’s surprise over Obie so blatantly cheating on Tony or over seeing Tony Stane with a toddler on his hip.
“Yeah, it should be fine. It’s like Operation,” Tony says nonchalantly, “You just don’t let it touch the socket wall or it goes beep.”
Afghanistan
“Well, your company approved it,” the Beta shoots back with just as much force.
At first, it was writer's block and being overwhelmed with the world and then I was busy with school. I just got out of school, so I finally finished the fourth chapter. I'm hoping to do a weekly schedule for the next five to six weeks before school starts like I did before, and then when I have school again, every two to three weeks. I'll try really hard not to go on a 6-month hiatus again. Enjoy the longest chapter I've written yet.
“Impressive, you’ve upgraded your armor. I’ve made some upgrades of my own.” With that, the Alpha takes flight.
Steve's mind was breaking. How could Trip ask Toni? She wasn't here, because Steve was an idiot and pushed her away. Why did he always have to push her buttons?
"The new memory has Toni in it."
Until the next time:
Plus, she was there. That woman had caused nothing but pain and grief, and Toni wanted nothing to do with it, especially now. She thought she had freed herself from that part of her life, though she should've known better, because it was impossible to escape one's past. Toni should know this; she should be used to it, but she wasn't. The only thing she could do was to hope that Steve didn't pick up on it…If he did, oh, god. That idea scared her, though she wasn't sure why. The Captain knew her, knew that her past wasn't clean, so he shouldn't be too surprised.
With a look that could cut right through a person, Natasha's eyes narrowed, scanning the genius head to toe without saying one word. Clint, on the other hand, was all word, reminding Toni of herself when she was only running on 3 hours of sleep. "Toni! Look, Nat. It's Toni. So good to see you." His smile took up his entire face. A kid at Disney. "Wait, does that mean Rogers is in a good mood? Because, man! He has been a beast. A beast, I am telling you." He paused for a second. "He has to be, considering you're wearing his shirt. It means good things, right?" He gave her a wink. "You-"
"Oh, they don't know?" Fury replied as if he had something smelly under his breath. He could out stink eye anyone.
"Um…" Rogers looked up from the dishes and stared at her with large eyes and rosy cheeks. He didn't know what to say to that and that did make Toni laugh. He was innocent as ever. He turned away from her a few seconds later as he couldn't face her with his deep cherry red face. "Burnt the eggs?" he asked, changing the subject.
Romanoff glanced at Steve. "Maybe, we can use that," she replied with her arms folded a crossed her chest. Her eyes were glued to the monitors.
"Ten Minutes, Miss," JARVIS replied in her ear.
But that wasn't the point and she knew it. Now that her mind was clear, she needed to figure out where she was, and who had her. Could she be with those guys from before? She didn't think so, as they didn't seem like the type to stay in a cheap hotel. Sure, they looked like the government type, and the government wasn't one to spend the big bucks on hotel rooms, but there was no way that they were stay in a place like this. So where was she?
"Oh yea? What is that?" Toni asked, giving him a look.
Laying back, she stared at the ceiling and tried to think about her situation, but her stupid hair was irritating her. She had wanted to chop it off, but Pepper wouldn't let her. That woman wouldn't let her do anything and it was exasperating. Toni was a grown ass woman… Urgh! She thought. Since one of her arm was broken, the other was handcuffed and her body was stiff, she was forced to blow her medium black hair out of her face; however, it really wasn't working. Giving up on blowing her hair out of the way, she forced her mind back to work.
"Like I can do much with this?" Toni stated as she tried to lift her broken arm. The very movement of her arm hurt. Is that medication wearing off already?
On her shoulder, there was a discoloration, which drew his attention. "What is that?" he asked, trying to mask his growing anger. After getting to his feet to get a better look, he could see how far the darkened, yellowish bruise went down her back. "Who did this to you?" he asked, trying to keep his anger under control. He knew it wasn't fresh as the bruise was healing.
Steve folded down the blankets so Barnes could set her down on the twin size bed gently. Before stepping away, Bucky slid her boots off gently so Steve could pull the old blankets over her. They both turned away and started to step out of the bedroom.
He looks at her, knowing there's no lying to her, but he wishes he could. He wishes he could hide all of his emotions. "They are already in a relationship with each other."
*O*O*
Her brain snapped again, when she realized what was going on and whose arms she was in. She couldn't let him be the one to comfort her, and also, she did not need anyone to comfort her. She was not a child. "Let go," she stated as she pushed him away.
"And we can't send out Mr. Stark," Phillips stated as he turned to Toni. His eyes said it all. He needed her to do it.
Colonel let out a groan as Howard chuckle. "And there it is again. I hate that nickname."
"Good," the nurse said as she turned to leave.
As if nothing happened, Toni was sitting crossed legged on a different large sofa. A huge bowl of popcorn was in her lap, and she refused to share it with anyone. "Have any of you seen
"Remind me to slap that gene out of your father before you're born," the Colonel said, with a smile.
Steve gave her a look, cupping her face. "I'm getting there," he said, letting out a playful huff. He placed a soft kiss to her lips. "You're impatient."
Unable to walk any faster than snail, Jones stepped slowly to the struggling Dugan, who was unsteady on his feet. "I live with my daughter. Only unloved people end up in the nursing home."
"SHIELD will fall in a matter of days and Hydra will grow from the ashes." Though in a different degree as the Winter Soldier, the look on Pierce's face was unnerving. He was calm and angry all at the same time, and he even had a smile on his face.
"No stop signs-" Toni stopped as JARVIS had down turned down the volume. "Hey, what gives?" she asked, demanding answers.
"I think-"
He put the rifle down and leaned forward against the table. "I could tell from the plane that he wanted to talk to you by the way he was staring at you and I can assume from the look on your face that he did."
time or degree, and it usually pointed toward something wrong. Something deadly, and she was scared of what it meant, because it had to mean something. She was scared of what it said about her. It frightened her, making her heart race as her brain started to rapid fire, shooting out questions. Was she sick? Was she defected? Broken? Was she losing her mind? Could she not be Iron Man anymore? Could she not be a hero anymore? Was she useless? Was she a burden? So, with all her doubts, she kept it to her.
"You're counting on her doing as you plan but you don't know if she will," Peggy stated. "Why would she risk it for a broken device? If she's really as smart as she wants us to believe, she could just make a new one."
"I don't need your help, Rug Muncher," he stated as he whipped the blood from his mouth. His semi-joking mood had turned completely sour and he was shooting daggers with his eyes.
When Tony let a beat pass without continuing, Nat interjected. “Um, yes? Earth to Tony?”
normal.
“Well, yeah. That’s what I’ve been trying to explain to you for the past-“
Whatever comparison Nat was about to draw, the world would never know.
“Nat,” Tony began, a grin threatening to break open across his face. “He does not-“
“I told him.” Steve looked at Nat with a grimace on his face as he confessed.
Steve came back to the house and immediately started getting ready to work out
because a healthy jog apparently wasn’t enough to make him stop thinking so much. And he was going to lose his mind if, well, if his mind didn’t cool it. He needed to go take out a couple of punching bags.
“Alright alright, don’t take it out on Brucey. We’ll give it a rest, won’t we Steve?”
“At first, there was a bright side, because I couldn’t sleep. So,” he laughed, “well, as
At first, Tony just gestured between the two of them, seemingly defining “this.” But then, he smiled shyly, stood up on his tiptoes, and kissed Steve on the lips.
Tony watched him nervously for a while longer, bottom lip between his teeth, contemplating whether or not he should wait for Steve to say something first. He decided against that idea.
“What?” Steve asked, eyes wide and innocent.
She was cut off, seemingly—definitely—on purpose, by ACDC’s “You Shook Me All Night Long” being turned up to a deafening volume. Tony started dancing, like a drunk dad at a cook-out, and didn’t stop even as he took a sip of what Nat could only assume was coffee. The mug read:
“I don’t think you’ll drop dead, personally, but-“
“Yeah, I don’t know how many playboys spend their free time painstakingly crafting elaborate dollhouses covered in pink glitter, I have to say.”
– – –
“Nat,” he sighed, “I really don’t know what you’re talking about, okay? I just wanna work on this.” He broke eye contact.
“... Well? What do you think?” Tony asked him, all timid and skittish but somehow so sure of himself at the same time.
And yet, there would be the slightest pause before Steve answered, because his brain needed time to overcome the way his body reacted to Tony’s being so close. He usually did manage to say “yes,” or some variation of it, before Tony pulled out his pouty face. Sometimes, though, his brain would be perfectly fine, and he would wait anyway, just to see that face.
“‘I wanted to tell you that I do feel lonely, and that I do wish I had someone. So much. And I’ve been a little bit in love with this guy for what feels like a millennium, at this point, and I don’t know what to do? I guess? It’s sort of killing me, but I don’t want to get over him, either. I don’t know. I just don’t think he would ever see me that way—I feel like he’s too preoccupied with all these things to even think about seeing me that way. I guess.”
“Okay,” Steve said, without missing a beat.
Nat gave him an exhausted look, hoping to goad him into giving up the innocent act.
When Steve didn’t offer any explanation on his own, Nat simply continued.
Steve was upright, with his arms hugging his legs, and his chin resting on one of his knees. He tapped Nat on the shoulder. She turned around, beaming at him. He lifted his chin up so he could talk.
meta. Damn, Stark, you win. I really didn’t think you had it in you.”
“Okay,” Tony started, “I feel like I’m being punk’d.”
“Shut up, please?”
Nat continued, “Wait, you
both love
“Steve.” Steve physically felt his two selves become one again. This was not a dream, or an out-of-body experience, he realized. No, he had actually, really said all that - in real life. Steve raised his eyes up to meet Tony’s, not realizing until that particular moment that he had been staring intensely at the floor beneath them - no doubt to avoid the flood of tears which would have hit that very floor had he been forced to look at Tony while he was rambling and
Nat physically felt a pang in her chest. God, none of this was right. Tony? At a loss for words? It didn’t make sense at all.

Okay, so maybe Steve was being a

knew him. Over the years, they had developed a sibling-like relationship, and so even if they fought over silly things sometimes, Nat was the first person to be there if she thought, even for a second, that something was wrong.
“I can’t believe you did this,” Steve answered, finally. He grabbed Tony’s hand in his, and then clasped over their interlaced fingers with his free hand, kissing one of Tony’s knuckles so gently that Tony just might have imagined it.
She hoped teasing him would bring him out of the memory, would ground him and help him to not look so hurt, the way he did now.
She blinked her eyes way too many times and made a little pout with her lips. It reminded Steve of someone else he knew.
don’t get it, this time. You knew Steve was in love with someone—you said that. And
Even with the Tower, and the friends that he loved deeply, he was lucky to gain a real sense of belonging that he couldn’t have imagined he would ever have—but it wasn’t complete. He longed for a different kind of love. Not as a replacement that would overshadow what he already had, but an addition that would make
Steve merely raised an eyebrow, appearing completely unaffected by this declaration, probably because it wasn’t exactly news.
When Steve quoted Tony next, he mimicked his words in a lower-than-necessary voice, that sort of voice that everyone uses to denote that they are now relaying the words someone else has said to them, to you.
"Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect," Toni replied.
she thought to herself as she lifted the case onto the table. She snapped opened the case, trying not to pay any attention to the 'god'.
*O*O*
Steve's face fell slightly, and he looked pained. "I do
"You-"
Clint turned to him and explained the conversion that Natasha and he had with Fury. "I told Natasha this, but I will tell you this: 'If anyone happens to Toni because of him, I will never return to SHIELD.' They can consider me their enemy. I'm dead serious."
"You're a hand full," Trip replied.
Toni nodded and let him go. Barnes was still giving her a weird look, but she waved them off. "Go! Have fun. I'll be fine!" she yelled. She waited until they disappeared from her sight before she started back to the apartment for her supplies.
He glanced her over before looking into her eyes. "You may be human but you're different."
"No, it's not the main reason." He paused for a few seconds. "I see you got pass him tailing you."
"You're mad at me." Rogers took a deep breath. "You referred to me by my last name."
Toni's eye twitched. "I don't."
"Time travel," she replied, still struggling to keep a smile on her face as she broke free of his arms. "It's more strenuous then sex, but sex is more rewarding." As the words came out of her mouth, she felt like she was trying too hard.
Taking a deep breath, Toni rubbed as much of the grease and oil off her hands as possible. She tried to clear her head as she focused on the dark spots on her hands. Like most engineers, her hands were almost always covered in some kind of oil or dirt; it was normal for her. In fact, it was one the few things that calmed her, even with all the nightmares. It was probably why she couldn't stop building suits.
After he was sure that Toni wouldn't try to get up, Howard released his grip on her. "In the infirmary," he answered, not stepping back from the bed. "Do you need something?"
Steve's eyes flicked to Potts only for a second, knowing that it would never be Pepper. She had never seen battle, let alone flown a suit. He turned to Rhodes, eyeing him. "You intend to go out?"
She didn't know why that was so hard to do, but it was. Was it really that hard to breathe? Her mind wasn't kicking back like the pain was. She felt like she was on fire again.
Though uncomfortable, Toni buried her face into the hard mattress, hiding herself in the blankets—worn from years of use. With a strong aroma, she couldn't help but flash back to Aunt Peggy, smelling the old spices the woman was known for. God, it was overwhelming. She missed the spunky woman Peggy used to be, not the shell she was now. Toni hated that she was being robbed of her time with Aunt Peg, and she
, she told herself. She knew it was stupid to be worried, but she blamed it on the pain, clouding her judgment.
"I think Agent Sassy Pants is amazing nickname," Toni replied, trying to ignore the pain raising up in her chest. Before his death, Barnes had complained about not having a nickname and he would tease her for one. It had turned into a game for him. "Don't be jealous." Her hands went to the dog tags and squeezed.
"Candy Cane?" Steve asked, wrapping one arm around her waist and pulling had back against him. He held the Candy Cane out in front of her, waiting for her to take it.
"The sooner the better," Steve said, his expression turning rigid. A realization dawning on him. "If there're super soldiers out there, it won't end well for anyone."
"Well, our genius is there," Rogers says with a blinding smile. "We refuse to let him go."
However, Toni had other things to worry about, because Aldrich seemed—no, was. He was a complete nutcase, who needed a good punch to the face. Maybe, a kick to the junk as well. A good hard kick. He didn't care who got in his way or who got hurt, if he got what he wanted, which were super soldiers…who would obey him without question. And Toni knew he would do
And this is unbeta-ed and I am sorry for my horrible grammar skills...it was a real battle to proof this.
Also, I am playing with the idea of Howard finding out about Toni. What do you guys think?
Toni knew the perfect time to break into Stark Industries, and it was during the Stark Expo, while her father was on stage showing off like he always did. While he was making a fool out of himself, she would be sneaking into his company and stealing back her device. Hopefully by the time he found out, she would be long gone… though she still had no idea of how to power it without another arc reactor.
His hands balled at his side as he watched some man go after her, trying to talk to her. His metal hand twitched as his right went for the knife in his belt. He was seconds from jumping out from the bushes and attacking this man for daring to touch her. How dare he touch something that was
Toni knew what he wanted to say, but she also knew that he would know that she was lying. "I'll try, Steve," she said, softly. "It's just…" She hated talking about her nightmares. Why couldn't she just pretend these didn't exist?
if you know what I mean. You hear me? Painful places. Don't hurt her."
"Natasha told us," Steve says. "She told us everything, and we're sorry that we didn't see it."
brunette. It reminded him of something, though he wasn't sure of what or where it came from.
That was why Toni could never join the military or any government agency; she couldn't blindly follow orders or remain silent when she had something to say. It was a wonder that she worked so well with the Avengers…well it depended on who was asked. Captain America might disagree with that, as they were always fighting over something.
"You can talk about it. There's nothing wrong with talking," Bruce stated.
"What are you doing out here without a coat? Why aren't you at the dinner with Bucky?" he asked. There was annoyance in his tone.
Toni lets out a harsh sigh as she eyed her car. She knew it was unfair to be so angry at Steve for leaving, but she was. What was the point of being in a relationship with the man if she hardly saw him? Or maybe, she was just crazy? Being too hard? Too needy? She knew she adored him because he
The Archer pops a few popcorns into his mouth as he watches Tony get comfortable between Rhodes and Romanoff. "What? You're going to be main show tonight," he says with a smile. There's a smirk on his face. A fucken smirk.
Toni just closed her eyes and laughed. He knew how to comfort her, when she needed to do, and she had no idea of how. They didn't get along at first, and she hated him.
Dugan's hand tightened around his cane. "Careful. I don't think Captain Rogers is willing to share."
Steve gently places his hands on Tony's face, caressing his cheek. "Tony, we wouldn't say it unless we meant," he says. "Trust me. I promise you that. We love you, and that will never change."
"I am not going to hurt you," he stated as he stepped toward her.
Her father kneed in front of her again. "Are you okay?" he asked, ignoring her question. "You don't look well." He reached a hand to her, trying to check her temperature, but she slapped his arm away. "Toni."
"…I did mean it." There had been some hesitation in his voice.
*O*O*
When Tony comes to again, he's surprised to find himself in his room, because this is the last place that he expects to wake up. What he expects is to be tied down in the hospital bed, while Barnes and Rogers babysit him. Forcing fake pity down his throat. Being in his own room is truly the last thing that he expects, but he's okay with it. No, he's relieved with this, though he's still surprise the Super Soldiers aren't with him. But again, he's happy. He doesn't know what he would do if he's stuck with them and their phony worry for hours.
"Can't think like that," she yelled at herself. Her voice felt like someone was running nails down her throat; it hurt to even breathe. She would die for a glass of water right about now. If she didn't feel like death, she would be drooling for a glass right now. Her body was protesting, as her legs were seconds from dying on her. She didn't know if it was due to her run through the dense wilds for an hour or the car accident. Though nothing seemed broken, there was no doubt she had a concussion and some bruised rips, which could be why she was struggling to breathe.
Maximoff says as the connection is made.
You see I love a good chase. It keeps it fun," she said with a smile, a calculated smile.
"It might have worked if I was a dog." He glared, but she waved him off as she tried to get the picture of a dripping knife out of her mind. "Like I listen. Just ask Salty. I don't like orders," she said as she put her gun away and looked at the building map on the device. As she was looking, she added, "And you took down that man with a tiny knife?"
The man sluggishly turned around. "Toni," he called as he faced her.
"Come on!" the man yelled, angrily. Like an angry teddy bear, he picked up speed and tried to catch up to Steve, who was now a few good feet away from him in a matter of seconds. With lungs battling for air, he slowed and stopped a few seconds later unable to carry himself anymore. With annoyance on his face, he paused to rest—not that he could make it another foot. Picking a random tree, he leaned back and allowed himself to fall, landing with a thump.
"I had promised myself that I wouldn't ask you anything about the future," he responded.
"No." She squeezed out, as she covered her ears.
After making sure that the spider was off her, she darted to the back door of the complex. She reached into her bag and pulled her homemade scanner. The lock wasn't fully computerized as it would require her to manually pick the lock. The lock, impressive for the time, was connected to the building security system, and any attempt to pick the lock would alert the guards and slam down an interior partition inside the lock, making it impossible to pick. However, she was the famous genius Toni Stark and there wasn't anything that she couldn't hack. Plus, she had the scanner, which could hack the system and create an interference so the system would not know it was being hacked.
She glanced up to see Barnes, who was a sight for sore eyes. "Barnes," she called. "What happen to you? You look disgusting." She teased. "You make me feel better about myself."
Steve, with sketchbook open to a blank page, was seated outside a small café in Manhattan. Not a second passed without a person walking past him, and it was about every five seconds that a woman walked by him smiling. Even in old, bland, out of fashion clothes, Steve was still attractive young man, who stood out in a crowd. Though he wasn't an expert in women in any sense, he knew he was attractive and he could get any woman he wanted… well besides the one he wanted.
Toni closed her eyes as she felt his arms around her; there was something warm about it. "Get in line," she whispered. She was too tired to fight against her father, even if she felt uncomfortable. Why wasn't he like this in the future? Why was he distant then? It wasn't because he was interested in her, though he did throw out a few one liners. It was like he cared, and that annoyed her slightly. He should've been like this in the future not now, though she would take it now as she needed it now.
Toni's eye brow rose. Was he really flirting with her? If so, it isn't didn't compute, as his smile didn't match the look in his eyes. Besides, no chance in hell that she would date him. "Captain Rogers knows that I am queen, trust me. He knows and worships me. No, no, I'm just calling you fat. I know a few gyms that I can point in the direction of."
Peggy let out a laugh. "Well, I guess it couldn't hurt." She smiled. "But only on one condition."
To make things worse, she hated the name Sark with a passion, and she couldn't wait to be herself again. "No."
Rogers smiled as he squeezed her arm lightly. "If I'm the Cowboy, what does that make you?" he asked as he pushed himself to his feet.
"No, what I need is to get out of here," Toni replied, trying to sit up. "I need to work on my device."
Steve was a dog, not stupid dog, but he was a dog, and dogs didn't mix well with cats. He was loyal, caring no matter what, unlike her. Only doing it when it served her. Suddenly feeling overwhelmed, Toni ordered JARVIS to turn off he comms, needing to be left alone to her thoughts.
Toni can see Peggy wanted to say something, but she was refraining. Unlike her, Agent Carter could keep silence and listen, even if she didn't want to.
"With all due respect, sir. So am I," Rogers said.
"Barton, let it go," Natasha stated. "We have other things to worry about."
"You need to rest, Steve."
Toni let out a sighing smile as she recognized that British accent. "Geez, Peg. Keep it down. We don't want to wake Stark. We'll never hear the end of it, if we do," she replied, back stepping to the bed to sit. She didn't have the energy to put her shoes on standing up.
Hello! I am back
Feeling the sting in her entire body, her hand flew to her face, gently touching the spot where he hit her. It was like time had stop, as Toni was in a daze, seeing stars. It wasn't like she expected the man to treat her with any kind of respect, but it had been years since someone had slapped her like that. She had expected it in the past with that mouth of hers, but this was the first time someone had hit her like that. And this was much more than that. It was a clear sign that Rollins was not a friendly, not that he ever was. On the other hand, she got to rub this crap in Steve's face. She was right and he was wrong. However, now was not the time to gloat.
"Steve," she uttered, leaning against him. Her ankle was killing her.
Before she could turn away, Rogers pulled away from Carter and turned, which to her bad luck, put her right in the sight of Rogers, who was looking at her with those eyes again. "T-Toni…" He stared at her, unsure what to say. He knew he had been caught. "Why are you out of bed?" he finally asked.
"Didn't go well?" he asked.
Years after killing the familiar man and stealing his photo, the Asset wasn't sure of anything besides the countless bodies that he had dropped. Time meant nothing as it flew by, and all of those deaths meant nothing. Even after the chair, he remembered and only cared about that picture. Nothing mattered, besides that picture, even if he had no idea of why. That picture of the unknown woman meant everything to him, even if he knew nothing about her. That picture was the most important thing he owned, even if he could no longer remember where he got it from.
"Maybe, you don't know your 'soldier' all too well," Toni hissed, turning away from Phillips. She still had the mental scars from that attack.
genius, while his hands went to the bra, lifting it up and away from her body. Breaking away from her lips, he lift it up and over her head. Toni leaned back forward, expecting Steve to lean forward and kiss her again, but Steve turned away, reaching for the towel. When he turned back, he was faced with a wild confused look, but he only grinned as he started to dab her dry.
With a heavy heart, Steve released her and allowed her to slip out of his arms. He kept his eyes on her, unsure of what to do or say. Did he let her run again? He wasn't sure he could handle that, granted he doubted Natasha would let her get to far from them. "Toni, talk to me."
"I-" Toni started as she turned around. Peggy was gone and the doors were seal shut, leaving Toni all alone in the old fashioned New York. She wasn't scared, but this was a whole different world than what she was used to.
"Of course, that would be something you would complain about at this very moment," he said, as he pulled the quivering genius into his arms.
*O*O*
For the rest of the night, Toni slept peacefully, feeling completely loved and cherished in Steve's arms. It wasn't until the morning, when she got a phone call concerning Happy that she felt her world shatter. It was then that she felt everything went up in flames.
His smile faded slightly. "Neither I nor Steve were going to leave you down there," he admitted. "Something could've happened to you."
"Toni," Steve called, giving her a look.
The Genius tried to break the Commander's grip on her neck, but she couldn't pry the hands even an inch. With failing vision, Toni glimpsed up at up the woman as her grip tightened around Toni's neck. Toni never expected this woman to be this strong; she didn't even look like she could pick up 30 pounds let alone pick her up like a sack of potatoes. If this woman wasn't choking her to death, Toni might have called her pretty or be amazed by her, but she couldn't think with the lack of oxygen.
"Like I know mine," he replied. "And there's a lot of resources that come with being a Stark. Of course, you know that very well, Toni."
Sure, Pepper had forced Christmas on her in the past, but she hadn't a real tree in ages. She had almost forgotten what a real tree smelled like, and if she thought about it, it almost made her sick. "There's needles everywhere," she complained as she pushed out of Steve's arms.
She tried to push him away, but he held her tight. What was people with hugging her? Did they not know she hated hugs? "I'm fine. Just angry. Don't make me hurt you."
"Don't give any idea, Stark." He hissed, his eyes deadly.
to know she was.
She folded her arms across her chest as she turned to him. "Stark is a friend. I wasn't going to let her disappear again," she replied, calmly. There was something in Natasha's tone that Steve had rarely heard. There was a softness to it.
Taking a deep breath, Toni pushed herself into a sitting position and stared at the wall. She had things to do and she couldn't spend all day hiding from Rogers. She did have to go to work, which meant she would have to leave the room. She couldn't understand why she was being foolish about this whole thing. It annoyed her.
"Toni," he replied, a soft warning tone in his voice.
"You know we'll have to talk," Steve said, as he held the naked Toni.
Barton stepped away from the armor and crossed to the counter near Rhodes, who had gotten to his feet. "Now," he stated, picking up his bow. "Ready, Rhodes?"
His name sounded familiar to her, but she couldn't place it. "I don't need a baby sitter," she stated as the pain was getting to her.
Toni thought to herself as she stepped to the sliding glass doors. She had to speak to him now; she had to put on her mask. No one was allowed to see how broken she was.
Steve looked up and glanced around the room. His face heated up, turning red with each eye on him. "Nothing," he said, fighting back the redness in his face. There was a bit of hesitation in his step before he crossed (running almost) to Toni. His pink face disappeared as a smile emerged on his face. It was probably one of the biggest smile that Toni had ever seen, but she didn't get a good look at it as he dumped an arm full of torn paper on her head. Big pieces. Little Pieces. It didn't matter. She was covered in it.
Phillips buckled himself in. "Just a book?" he asked.
something is wrong.
"And let me tell you, a jealous Steve is funny," Bucky smiles.
Schmidt crossed to the door. "I do not have the time to waste. Zola, Sark, and I have things to do."
Shaking her head, she glanced toward the door, but she could barely focus. Her head was still spinning. As she closed her eyes, the door to the room opened and two people walked in. She waited until they entered and the door closed before she opened her eyes. Johann Schmidt didn't take any introducing to know who he was, though it took her a few seconds to realize who the small man. It was Dr. Arnim Zola, the master mind behind the hydra weapons.
