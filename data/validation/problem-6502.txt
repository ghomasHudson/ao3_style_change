“That’s a scary face you’re making Captain.” Tony remarked. He’d reached out, so that he was now the one grasping Steve’s elbow, gentle touch enough to draw Steve out of the dark well his thoughts had fallen into.
“Why don’t you shove it up your ass. Yeah?” Bucky flipped back. He turned his head from the window to look at Steve, sitting at the table they’d dragged in from the kitchen. “It might be our last supper. I wanna know who’s bringing it.”
“All of those people have to leave? How the hell do they expect them to manage that in twenty-four hours?” Hogan murmured in bafflement as the news castor went on to describe the unexpected terms of peace the Führer and the other European powers had reached, and what a historic and triumphant moment it was for Germany.
“You’re alright, love.” He murmured, it and a thousand other gentle encouragements as he gently washed away the mess. When Stefen was clean Tony abandoned the soiled towel atop the pile of clothes on the floor, uncaring of what Stefen would think when he was back to rights, just so long as he got there.
“I’ll still miss you,” he blurted, still smiling. It was important to say that, he thought, just in case Da didn’t know.
Father blinked, looking taken back. A flash of something close to irritation crossing his face before he grunted.
Tony had to bite his tongue to avoid saying all the things that welled up in response to that because Rogers, damn him, looked hopeful for the first time in their acquaintance and it had nothing to do with Tony but his damned name.
Steve never should have let Tony out of his sight. The problem was, Steve had come to depend too much on him. He’d become blindly selfish, subconsciously believing Tony to be impervious to harm. Tony had been the closest thing to invincible in Steve’s life thus far. Everything else got taken and broken, but not Tony.
Letters, Tony noted absently, one with Stefen’s return address and the other more curiously bearing the seal of the German Navy.
It was altogether too easy to get lost in these games with the Captain, trading barbs and parrying wits; and allowing himself to forget the damning truth that Tony was a Jew, and Stefen a Nazi officer. He would like it if his suspicions about Stefen’s involvement in treasonous activities would prove to be true, but the evidence was at best conflicting. He couldn’t shake it out of his mind, his Nonna’s words, and the memory of watching Stefen arm his children. There was a deep aching sadness growing within him each afternoon, dressing the children into their uniforms and sending them off, each time knowing they’d come back a little less innocent, a little more confused, a little harder in their hearts.
He was sure Peggy had tried, but she was one woman, flesh and blood and not the saint of her husband’s memory. Men did not listen to women the same way they listened to other men. Tony’s father certainly never had.
She stared long and hard at him, her honey brown eyes taking him in. The only sound between them the wind creaking the walls and the damn goat occasionally bleating.
In the end Tony gave her the address where to write him and agreed to visit her in Pola before next fall. An easy enough promise to make. No matter how the wind blew, whether he was with the Captain and his family or alone, he was going to see them again before he lost the chance.
Father had to be just as sick as Charlotte had claimed he was. Too sick to get out of bed, too sick to allow any visit but a doctor. The trouble was, Natacha knew of only one other way to make someone physically sick when you needed them to be besides the spread of germs, and that would take too long. And what if she accidently gave him something he couldn't recover from like the fever that had killed her mother?
He was working on the boat, the only useful thing he could do, and he didn’t know how many hours he’d been at it – only that his ears were ringing from the sound of the hammer he was using to line the belly with the sheets he’d crafted.
The new year had come and gone, but the city was held frozen in place. Charlotte waited amidst the small crowd gathered outside of city hall, safely ensconced in the back of her father's Mercedes. The crowds had been gathering every morning since Stefen's arrest, waiting for news and demanding answers from an increasingly anxious police force. No official sentence had been made, but it would have to come soon. The threat of violence was heavy in the air. The city bubbling like a pot of grease which the smallest spark would ignite.
"Pack?" Tony questioned, brow furrowing as a feeling of dread crept over him. "Are we going somewhere?"
His chest was going to explode. She had to understand. But even now he could see his grandmother's calm face the way he remembered it from childhood, the tilt of her chin as she listened. The stubbornness.
James was making a fuss again. Not a full on fit the way he used to, but what Tony liked to call one of his productions. He just wanted attention, Ian knew, and he’d do anything (even pretend he didn’t know how to dress himself properly) just to get it. It wasn’t right. Babies did that, and it just made things harder on Tony who was already getting tired of them.
“We are the trial.” Steve cut in, “We can’t allow one man to bully his way through our government, through our country, so he can play at war and take the lives of innocents. He has to be stopped. It has to end. You’re here because you know that’s true.”
"I thought you said the staff would be relived." she interrupted and now, Steve’s face began to mirror her confusion.
Steve repeated this again and again. He whispered it into his arms at night, using it to block out the pain, as well as the moans from the other prisoners. It was the only thing keeping him sane. Tony’s brown eyes staring up at him, simultaneously begging and demanding Steve to understand. To see the end that was coming for them.
Before he could even formulate an answer Péter had sighed, dropping his gaze to his plate in order to pick at what remained of his meal as he bit out, "How long will you be gone this time?"
James let out a sharp shriek and Tony whipped around, muscles already tensed for a dive, just in time to see James landing in his father's arms with a grunt of laughter, water spraying everywhere.
“Of course.” Stefen agreed, squeezing their shoulders gently before commanding more than suggesting that they get as much sleep as they could and let him know their decision in the morning. He was sincere, but Tony could see written on his face a sort of resignation. He knew just as Tony knew, what cold comfort safety was to them right now.
“Stefen,” Tony’s voice prodded him to look up at him. “You have to trust me. I will be fine. We’re all going to make it out of here together.”
Péter swallowed back the lump in his throat, and dragged his eyes down from the ceiling to look back at them and finish.
“Henrick.” His ruined voice sounded foreign even to his own ears. Please. He tried to say but his voice just cracked and the sound that came out of his throat wasn’t intelligible. Dvorak huffed a low laugh in response to the sound, shaking his head.
"I need you Tony." Steve whispered. the confession nowhere near as bare as the expression he wore as he reached with one hand, still shaking, and curled his fingers around one of the bright gold coins that hung from Tony's neck. Steve had no great strength left in him to force anything, but Tony followed that barely there pull like dust caught in planetary orbit.
“-Herr stark” Pepper said from across the table, again warning him, though there was not much heat behind it.
He didn’t know what had made him remember the bible shoved at the bottom of his trunks. He’d known only that he was tired, a tired so deep in his breast that it ached like a wound, and something about holding that little book in his hands and flipping through it had managed what the liquor had not, his mind quieting as it focused on the familiar verses and the scent of old pages and worn leather.
“Who the devil are Anton Roosevelt and Steven Grant?” Tony demanded to know, not because he needed it confirmed but because he wanted to hear them explain it. To the man’s credit, Pike didn’t mince words. Tony got the feeling mincing wasn’t something the admiral did often.
“Huh?” Péter gaped at her, unsure what she meant or what she was thinking as she turned back to the fireworks. She didn’t speak for a long time, and he became horribly anxiously certain that she was angry about what he’d said (and not said). And then she took him by complete surprise by turning and pressing a kiss to his cheek, whispering softly in his ear.
“Antony, darling how marvelous to see you. You look ravishing!” Janneke drawled appearing in a cloud of perfume and irresistible energy. Though Tony hardly knew her, he went along with it as she pressed kisses against both of his cheeks and firmly placed herself between him and the odious Frau Ursala.
, the wise woman, as was her mother before her and her mother before her. She was clever and kind, and good at reading people. She always knew when others told untruths or when they were trying to cheat her. She knew the plants, and how to draw illnesses from the body to keep the caravan healthy.
Tony wanted to believe him, but he had a hard time shaking off the feeling of dread that clung to him the rest of the night every time he’d thought back to the desperate way Harry had been clutching Péter. That had not been nothing. It had been love, twisted up with rage and despair. He’d seen enough of it today to know.
“She’s a good age for it, don’t you agree Major?” Frau Greers sister, or cousin, or something or another asked.
Tony drew in a shaky breath and leaned forwards, burying his face where shoulder met neck, breathing in Stefen’s scent in an effort to ground himself; but the next breath was even more unsteady. He twisted his hands, tightening his grip on Stefen’s shirt.
“They could ask!” Natacha insisted after a beat, though she sounded as if she only half believed the words herself. “Father would help them.”
“No Bambina,” Tony quickly reassured her, placing a hand atop her head and pressing one finger against his lips in the signal for quiet. “It’s just that your father is meeting with some very important people and we all must be very quiet now until they’re done. Sara could use some more practice with her letters. Why don’t you girls head to the school room with Frau Hogan and see if you can’t get through the alphabet today.”
Something tugged on his arm and pulled him up short. He growled and twisted to yank free of its grip, before he recognized that it was his name being called, and that the person who held him was Tony. He relaxed.
Sometimes, devoting your life to another person was a promise that they’d never die in hands that did not love them.
He found Julia and Hammer hovering outside the drawing room door, eavesdropping on what sounded like a very intense exchange between the countess and the baroness. Julia jumped as Tony came up behind them and had the grace to look guilty for being caught but Hammer just sneered.
"No!" Daniel snapped with confidence Tony was having a hard time mustering. "You made a mistake. They would never sign that. They would never leave without us!”
“Do you think he’s dead?” he heard Natacha whisper to Péter late one night, out of earshot of the younger children whom had fallen asleep on the bed to a slightly embellished story from Tony’s youth about the time he and his best friend Rhodey had nearly drowned searching for lost treasure in the cove. They were still sleeping altogether in the big bed downstairs, but Tony thought he might start insisting they go back to splitting up at night. For their own good and for the good of his poor back. The chair was not a comfortable place to rest.
He opened the file and began to read. Still, he thought, some trash still slipped through the cracks.
“Well you didn’t show her that today, not at all and it’s lucky that you’re both small and don’t have a lot of room in you for big grudges because she’s really forgiving. But before you think you’ve gotten off easy just remember it’s no desert for a week and early bed. Pepper and I have already discussed it.”
"Baroness Schrader, we have to go back." A voice suddenly piped up from the back, drawing Deiter's attention. He glanced in the rearview and saw that the speaker was the quiet boy. Ian.
"Can we trust this cardinal fellow to do that?" Bucky asked, brow furrowed deeply in suspicion. "Some fancy official from Rome. Why would he help us? I don’t like it. You can’t trust the Italians far as you can throw em."
Pepper stilled, her brow furrowing deeply in thought. “They’ve given other children who’ve turned on their parents to new guardians. Perhaps they’ll do that this time too?”
’, but it was not Tony who had mistaken a perfect stranger for one of the children. Tony was not that weak minded.
“And the puppets!” Artur reminded him with a shout of glee. “Maria can sing while we have the show!”
Artur opened his mouth but only a squeak came out, his face falling into a frown of contemplation as he lowered the shoe.  Yes, they would need food. Artur especially liked to eat. Not that it mattered anymore. Tony had found them and that meant he would leave.
There was a splash as Natacha slipped back into the water, jerking Bucky out of his thoughts. A moment later she appeared above the water. She wiped her eyes and peered back at him just long enough to flash a bright little grin and say “good”, before she disappeared again.
There was no telling when it would happen either. He’d just slip from one extreme mood to the other. The last time he’d crashed without anyone noticing at all, following Maria around listening to her chatter in a daze until he’d just disappeared into his office without so much as a word of goodbye. Tony had found Natacha placing a blanket over his shoulder, the familiar way in which she tucked him into a comfortable position and ordered his things suggesting that this behavior was not unusual to her in the slightest. He’d been using what looked like important documents as a pillow, his breathing labored as if he’d been running.
Tomatoes. Péter read, reaching for a large jar full of juicy plums in the back with a sense of triumph despite his skepticism. At least the soup would help keep his father hydrated.
“Then I will hide in the cellar just as I did today, and he will be no closer to finding you.” Tony immediately cut in. A vicious sound of protest rumbled its way out of Steve’s chest, but Tony pressed on. “You need to go back to the children Steve. You know you must.”
Only a few of them looked up with any curiosity at the visitors who had entered the camp, even though Tony's scarlet robes stood out among the grey in the center of the yard like a beacon. He forced his eyes away from the faces of the prisoners and back to the warden.
“Good, you keep rubbing, and keep telling him to breathe.” Tony squeezed Ian’s shoulder, and turned toward the stairs leading to the loft where Péter had just finished climbing down. He and Natacha were keeping the others upstairs, on the chance that whatever virus James had caught wasn’t contagious.
The news castor was reading studiously over silent footage of The Führer walking side by side with Mussolini, Chamberlin and the French Prime Minister, deep in discussion as they were swiftly escorted inside a building by stern faced security officers.
As far as little sisters went Péter had always considered himself pretty lucky. Natacha liked most of the games he did and was actually better at them than most boys. She’d beaten Péter and Harry most the time at their contests.
They’d not been out there long before voices on the terrace had drawn his attention and Tony had been surprised to see Pepper setting up Kaffeetrinken for the captain and Herr Bakhuizen. Though it wasn’t near as involved in his children’s day to day lives as Tony would like, it was a start. Stefen was out of his rooms at least, and the children seemed thrilled by his presence. Tony felt satisfied for the moment, even though he knew the achievement was far more likely due to Herr Bakhuizen’s presence than Stefen taking to heart anything Tony might have said to him.
“Herr Sark!” Tony paused at the sound of his name. He was halfway up the staircase, the books and manuscripts in his arms balanced precariously. He shifted them impatiently as Hammer took his time sauntering slowly towards him, three small parcels under his arm.
He’d heard the words but his brain was having trouble processing them, because he kept hearing Stefen say he hadn’t been wrong to want what he’d wanted, and that just didn’t compute. Tony couldn’t think of a single person who hadn’t at least been shocked by his lack of patriotism before this moment.
“Her voice is a true testament to the strength of her German blood. Tomorrow all of the young men in this room will be breaking down the door of my office crying, Frau Ursala, Frau Ursala, I must have the song bird, but is she suitable?” The woman, Ursala, cackled brightly with amusement.
But when Stefen walked in the door, already in dress uniform from his meetings earlier in the day, he had a nervous look about him.
Steve observed their escorts closely, only partly because studying them was a distraction from the tightening sensation in his chest with every bump and rattle that shook the aircraft.
“The Gestapo have taken Cameron’s family.” Stefen answered in a tone much too quiet and calm for the words that sent shock like a wave through the room.
“It’ll be alright.” He heard himself say, for the first-time half believing it could be true. His hand flittered over Tony’s neck, feeling the fluting pulse underneath his fragile skin. “Just take a deep breath. Stay with me, Stark.”
He needed to think with his head and not his cock. He’d say there was merit in trusting ones heart, but his was damnably flawed and past the point of corruption where the Captain was concerned.
“You know what I keep thinking?” He didn’t look up from his task, but it was clear he was speaking to Steve.
As the group disappeared around the corner Tony chuckled to himself, heading toward the day room, making a note to include farm animals on Artur’s long list of creatures worth knowing about.
It was impossible to see underneath the man's coal black uniform and crisp white shirt but Steve knew that if removed, it would reveal the long puckered scar that wrapped around Kurt’s body from navel to shoulder blade. A gruesome parting gift courtesy of the shoddy engineering of a mountain gun. Kurt hadn’t been the only soldier to kiss death that way.
“shame on you, sir, If you’re not here when you’re not on tour I don’t know what you’re doing, clearly not living’
His stare was poignant. Though Tony didn’t glance down to where Steve was gripping him he didn’t need to. Steve released Tony’s flesh like it had burned him, the sick feeling churning in his gut nearly drowned out by the ache in his chest at the thought that Tony had just put him in the same class as an overgrown bully who beat on children, and couldn’t accept the consequences for his own actions. Tony didn’t really think that Steve would hurt him did he?
“As if you were any good at hiding it,” Bucky snickered from the seat beside him at the breakfast table. “Why do you think I stopped talking about getting married?”
The words got under Péter’s skin like the prick of a needle. It wasn’t even that it could very well be his family one day. It was the realization that this was happening to his family right now, and to pretend otherwise, would mean pretending that he agreed with Harry when he said he shouldn’t be too friendly with the people who mopped his floors. Worst of all it would mean pretending that he agreed with the Nazis, who had taken the Klein’s lives apart on the grounds that they were worthless outsiders.
Even now, Rogers was too quick to rely on the honor of soldiers. He acted as if the night of long knives hadn’t happened at all. He said the things he said, and took the chances he took because deep down, he still believed they were honorable men. That they were all going to wake up one day, having remembered themselves, and band together against the common threat. The damn fool.
“Bucky, STOP!” Tony barked, struggling to hold him back. “Stop it! God damn it, what is wrong with you!” Bucky struggled to get loose, eyes locked on Steve’s which were locked on him, filled with pain and misery. Not enough. Not nearly enough. Bucky tore at the arms holding him like a wild animal.
Time served, Bucky had snatched up his promised citizenship and left the mountain troopers without a backward glance. He’d been a good soldier, but so had his friends. The price for that piece of paper had been too damn high.
Thankfully, Tony was saved by the sudden sound of a thud overhead followed by James’ all too familiar voice raised in a shout as he screamed abuse at someone.
There was a stunned silence following her announcement, a warning inhale of breath from Stefen as he finally raised his head and looked right at her with a discomforting stare, and then the children broke off into a chorus of dismayed shouts.
James on the other hand still hadn’t managed to master the doggy paddle and it was completely from lack of trying. He was happy with their attention and being held up in their arms. Tony suspected actually learning to swim on his own would be counterproductive to that.
Tony had meant what he’d said, the thought of tying his life to another man’s did not bother him. He’d follow Stefen as long as Stefen wished to be followed, but there must be trust between them. There had to be. Stefen could not keep him separate from his hardships any longer and he had to allow Tony to share his burdens. How else could Tony bring himself to put his faith in the man?
The cold woke Tony with a shiver. For a moment he lay in the dark, wondering at the chill within but then his focus was captured by the feeling of Stefen's body trembling against his. Small tremors shook his body where it was pressed against Tony's back.  Turning in the bed to look at him Tony's chest clenched at the sight of the captain’s hands clutching white knuckled at the sheets, his face deeply lined with tension as his mouth clenched and twitched, chased by nightmares. Stefen shivered violently and Tony sprang into action. It was horribly cold within the room. Cameron must have been late to feed the furnaces that morning.
Steve’s words where followed by a heavy silence, every man in the room still. He swallowed. Johan’s was just young and looking for reassurance that there were doing the right thing.
“It wouldn’t have been proper James.” Natacha answered promptly with an edge of rebuke that effectively silenced her younger brother. She sniffed, as if she’d caught a bad smell before muttering that she couldn’t imagine what the other girls would think if they learned their family was playing host to traveling performers.
Those brown eyes had caught his, soft and electric, mouth slightly open and panting and Steve had been rattled down to his core.
Tony really wanted to believe that this was all there was to it. That those twins had really been a pair of performers in some act of Bakhuizen’s that the Captain had shuffled through his home as quickly as possible to avoid gossip but it didn’t add up.
Becker snorted but his retort was drowned out by the roar of an approaching motorbike engine. He slowed, watching Corporal Nagal navigate the bike past the soldiers.
Tony felt a little sick, anxious at the sight. He could only hope whatever words the captain was trading with his son wouldn’t have negative repercussions.
He caught Steve’s eye and for a moment they shared a moment of commiseration. It didn’t need to be said. They would need far more men than they currently had in Czechoslovakia if they were to bring it fully under Reich control and staunch the rebellion.
To their credit, the children didn’t linger to ask questions. Péter grabbed Maria and Ian grabbed Artur’s hand while Natacha ran with Sara. Tony turned back to the train, eyes desperately searching for James but found only an empty doorway. From below it was impossible to get a good view inside, so he had no idea what sort of trouble could be keeping them. It flashed through his mind, that if the police had boarded the train and apprehended them there was little Tony could do about it, and for the sake of the others he should get in the truck and go. But Tony couldn’t. His heart beating wildly in his chest Tony ran up to the back of the carriage and grasped the bottom of the platform to try and pull himself up.
Every day after afternoon lessons Péter and his siblings, except for Maria and Sara who were still too young for the youth programs, made their way into town to meet up with their units. And every evening at five o'clock with the squads released them to go home to their dinners, Péter met up with his siblings in the square to begin the journey home.
She drew him back down and he made no resistance, the wine churning in his belly as she pressed her lips to his cheek. Tony swallowed back the lump in his throat. In that moment he was five years old again, bouncing into the kitchen in her old house, the smell of clove, frying oil, and pastry heavy in the air, her smooth powder soft cheek pressed to his as she hugged him close.
He didn’t get a chance to hear any more of it though because when Bakhuizen went on it was once again in German. “You’ve heard the stories. You know what they did to Strasser. If you had a damn bit of sense you’d send the children away Stefen.”
Artur squirmed in his seat, sweating under his layers. He started as a loud whistle blasted through the square. All around them people hurried to finish their meals and collect their things.
“It could have been much worse.” Tony admonished. The girl’s chin raised and Natacha stared at him, brows arching in challenge. Tony smiled weakly, too exhausted for anything more.
When Natacha sweetly pleaded, “Oh please father, say you will” something like shame twisted in Tony’s gut for getting their hopes up. His tug of war with their father was one thing, but he should not have put them in the middle of it. Now it was only going to break their hearts if the captain refused.
“Do you remember Ian?” Péter prompted and both he and Tony waited patiently for Ian to decide to speak. When he did, his voice was quiet and scratchy like he was hovering on the verge of tears.
“We can warn them a package is on its way.” Tony added, glancing meaningfully at Stefen. “We still have the radio.”
Well the goats wouldn’t be, Stefen! And there were all sorts of dangerous creatures in the woods. Like wolves! Wolves and mountain goats, and a plethora of other things that could hurt a boy of twelve traveling on his own; all because Tony had been stupid enough not to anticipate that Péter wasn’t the only rash one in the bunch.
He wasn't a little boy anymore and he had to be ready. For what he wasn't sure. Things weren't easy like in his books, where he could easily tell who was a villain and who was not.
They did not wait till April as Tony’s letter had said they would.  Rather, on a sunny day in the middle of March, just three days after posting the letter – that thanks to Grig, Tony knew for a fact the man at the post office read and reported on to Stanislov’s lacky – Tony met the Rabbi and his cousins at the soup kitchen, where with a little diversion from one of Benjamino’s students, he lost Stanislov’s man in the crowd and changed into a woman’s frock and gloves in a back room. Tony’s head and shoulders covered by a thick shawl, he and Grig had vacated the premises with the man his godfather had hired to watch him still searching the crowded hall of refugees for Tony’s face.
In the din it was hard to discern whether there were more wails or cheers, but it hardly mattered. Schmidt would make sure the papers only remembered it one way.
Stanislov was waiting for him in his father’s old study. Unlike the rest of the house the room had been dusted and the furnishings uncovered and polished. Stepping inside, Tony immediately noticed that the family portrait that had always hung over the fireplace – the one his father had commissioned the year Tony was born – was inexplicably absent, replaced by a portrait of a hound. That dog had always been a favorite of Stanislov’s, following him wherever he went. It bit Tony when he was four years old for trying to pet it. His mother wouldn’t let it inside after that.
And their answers were beyond lazy. Mostly they came from Péter, his younger siblings latching on and parroting his replies whether he bothered to think at all. Otherwise they all politely pleaded their ignorance and waited for the answers to be given to them. Ian was the only one who even bothered to take notes.
Tony hit the bottom of the lake bed, silt clouding up around them, but since he wasn’t a panicking child he was able to keep his wits about him.
"Let me help you with the soup." she replied, stepping out of Herr Hogan's embrace and away from them both, aiming for the stove. "I know how Bucky likes to make it."
Bruce and the others were huddled tightly together under the thin blankets Tony’d packed, forming a tight circle around a gas lamp for heat. He very much doubted he’d be getting much rest.
He watched Stefen and Natacha as they began to dance, completely focused on one another and forgetting about him entirely, but for once Tony didn’t mind so much being left behind. Not if it meant he got to watch Stefen dance with his daughter, both of them wearing identically shy, coltish expressions of delight, their burdens put away for the duration of a dance.
Everything he’d need at the base fit into his canvas bag so he had just left everything else where it lay.
“Yes. He barely has a voice but-yes.” Tony pulled his weary body away from the captains and rubbed at his eyes, heavy in their sockets. “His temperature evened out to 38.9 about an hour ago and hasn't moved, thank god. His voice sounds like someone took a shive to his vocal chords.”
But then it happened. It shouldn’t have. Tony should have just been one more slash of brown in a moving sea of them, but perhaps that just wasn’t Tony’s way; because as Steve’s eyes passed over the crowd once more, they were drawn to a man in a brown coat carrying a worn satchel slung over one shoulder. He wore a cap on his head, but the way a wave of dark hair curled over one ear resonated, as familiar as church bells calling for mass.
James and Ian were among the last children to trickle out. Péter, they said, had stayed behind to talk to the professor about a special assignment. Tony was glad to see that at least some of his fears about the children going unchallenged were unfounded. The said Natacha was in the lady’s room and had told them to go on ahead.
Ian lay where he'd collapsed, the fabric of the music rooms sofa biting into his face as he pressed it into the cousin.
“Not with you blowing your smoke all over the place,” he replied softly. The Romany sounded stiff in his ears but it came easier and easier to his tongue with every word spoken, like ice melting in his mouth.
“Good. Burn everything that can be burned. Use only fresh linens and towels.” He instructed, rolling up his sleeves. Eyeing the fresh set someone had stacked by the bedside next to a clean bowl of water. “Where are the children?”
“What have the remaining residents been told?” Steve asked Grimm as the man handed him a set of keys to their door as well as the side door downstairs.
Tony arched an eyebrow and lifted the lid of the basket, looking down into the bright assortments of fruit and cheese. Willamina had packed them with care telling Tony as he'd made his coffee, that the captain and his wife had made a habit of eating outside when it was only the five of them.
“Well my father, he revolutionized ship building, put Germany on the map, but all of that is just fanfare. He used to say nobody sinks a Stark ship, and that’s how you know we’re the best.”
The solid weight of the hilt in her palm felt like permission to do whatever she wanted. She didn’t want to bite her tongue and keep someone’s house. She wanted to fight. Fight like her Father. Like Bucky. Like her Mother.
As they rounded the corner Steve caught sight of the issued Mercedes Benz, gleaming black and imposing outside the officer’s office. He hissed out a breath. He’d never backed down to Schmidt before and he wasn’t going to start.
"Daniel!" Cameron came suddenly alive, shooting up from the couch and rushing towards his brother. Daniel met him half way, the older boy's shoulders shaking as he choked down a sob and buried his face against Cameron's shirt.
"Vieni bambini,” Mathilde jerked and stared at him aghast as the monk called to the children fluently in Italian. Charlotte fought a grimace. She’d forgotten Mathilde’s distaste for the Italians. Charlotte had the same mixed feelings about them that most people had but Mathilde was particularly firm about it because the dear woman’s husband had died in the Great War. She should have warned her.
They glanced nervously between each other, as if they didn't quite trust that they weren't being tricked before James was brave enough to ask, "Are you in trouble with the law?” He tried to cover his anxiousness with a deep scowl, reminiscent of Bucky's best. Steve's eyes caught Bucky's and he had to fight back the urge to smile.
“What about Beutlin?” Stefen suggested abruptly, the spark of inspiration leaping into his eye. Tony didn’t know who that was, though it didn’t take more than a moment's thought to recall that he’d definitely seen a Beutlin on the list of names written in the little book Stefen kept locked away in his study.
A familiar sort of longing panged in his chest, the way he suspected it always would when he thought of his late wife, but the feeling was not as sharp or as suffocating as it had once been.
He arrived later than usual to breakfast, unsurprised to find that Bakhuizen and the captain were already settled with the children, the captain perusing the morning paper with the same constipated expression that he always reserved for that mornings dose of fear mongering and government issued propaganda. Tony didn’t know why he bothered with it at all, if it put him in such a bad mood but he supposed a man of Stefen’s station felt he needed to stay informed. Tony reserved the right to tease him about it anyway.
“It’s alright Uncle Bucky,” Ian assured, though it was ruined somewhat by the peevish glance he tossed his brother as he reclaimed his seat on the couch, already reaching for the book he’d abandoned, intent now on shutting them all out. “I’m fine sleeping wherever you put me.”
Olasz words floated back to him over the screaming. They’d intended this, Steve realized with cold horror. The Reich had wanted this to happen and Olasz had been trying to warn him.
Steve tried to take his advice and breathe. His fingers were numb. He glanced down at them, found them white knuckled and fisted against the tablecloth. He slowly unclenched them.
“Just as I’m sure you didn’t mean to break the stupid vase this morning, or topple the stupid chair in the schoolroom yesterday?” Tony replied coolly and James shrank. Seeing that he was in fact listening, Tony gentled his tone.
The jacket and the scarf made her fairly indistinguishable and a woman with an escort was less likely to be stopped. Clever, the part of him he wished would take control acknowledged. But the part that saw only the practicalities of the mission and appreciated effective strategy was overcome by a creature of raw emotions. Rage. Fear. Horror. It all churned inside him, the emotions reverbing in on themselves with such speed that they created force, a ballooning pressure within his chest that he was sure would explode.
“Nothing like a pretty lady is there?” Catherine asked with a smirk and a wink in his direction as she opened the rear door for them.
Twelve year old females came with a host of mind boggling complications (dresses that were fine for brunches but not for dinners, skirts that were perfectly serviceable yesterday that simply wouldn’t due today, and a plethora of stockings and ribbons and sashes that all had to be coordinated) and while Tony liked to think he was a man of elevated tastes, it had been quite a few years since he’d had any need to keep his finger on the pulse of fashion and Natacha was in no mood to wait for him to catch up.
“Brother Banner?” Tony tried to interject a question into his voice for appearances sake, but when Bruce looked up his worried eyes lightened with a smile. Tony smiled back.
The monk just nodded thoughtfully and murmured, "That is what they say, but you see I wonder... Because I know this young man. He’s intelligent, I'd go so far as to say brilliant, whose gaze is not fixed at the end of a rifle. His eyes are on the stars and all their mysteries, and without him we might never know what they're made of. That young man matters a great deal to me, which is why I wrote to the International School of Geneva."
There were no guarantees. The only way anyone could assure that something like what had happened that awful night didn't happen again, was if the Reich was taken down. Tony could help with that by going to Dachau and rescuing the resistance members before their execution, making sure the information they carried got into the right hands.
“We can make more,” he assured her. And she nodded, murmuring, “I’ve seen Willamina make it before. Though now I wish I’d paid better attention.” Together they filled the bucket with the boiling water and somehow managed to get it upstairs without scalding themselves.
A/N 1: I want to just put a general warning here that Steve is a depressed kitten. He is suffering from a combination of severe depression and PTSD, and his thinking as a result is not always clear or healthy. There is an element of Dub/Con that comes into play here - through no fault of Tony's own - but nonetheless, Steve starts doing things because he feels he needs to do them, because he wants Tony and is afraid he'll leave if he doesn't make him feel loved. This is obviously messed up, and is something that they will adress when Tony becomes wise to it.
“An arrangement I assure you Captain that I was unaware of.” Justin was quick to say. “I warned Herr Stark to mind his place and your rules but he has no regard for authority. He’s caused nothing but chaos, unsavory visitors-”
“We’d better get them home, haven’t we Stefen?” Charlotte, on Stefen’s arm, tilted her head to look up at him, some dreamy fondness in her eyes as she stared up at him from under honey colored lashes that could have made her a star on the silver screen.  Tony wanted to roll his eyes. With that sort of expression on her face you’d think she’d birthed all of them herself and that this wasn’t just their second meeting.
His arms, his legs, everything ached with desperation making it hard to stay focused, stay on the task at hand. Steve kept going. He knew if he stopped for one second he would lose it. He was sure of it and he couldn’t do that.
“Péter!” Tony exclaimed once more, feeling staggeringly light headed and fearing he might drop to the cobblestones like a sack of bricks. “Péter!”
"No. Frau Hogan, if you would kindly show them to a room upstairs. We'll have something brought to them."
“Here go get dry, change into these, and I’ll see about getting your clothes cleaned tomorrow before anyone notices,” he offered, thrusting a folded night shirt Péter’s way. The boy accepted the offering wordlessly and headed for the bathroom and Tony breathed a sigh of relief. But just as the child reached the door Péter paused, turning back to Tony.
And so it came that after a long morning of speeches and spectacle, as beer continued to flow and music swelled throughout the Weisn, it was finally time for them to take the stage once more.  Bucky had been working the crowd after the last act, but he sobered up when it came time to introduce them, pride and an unusually solemn gravity in his voice as he announced them.
"Bye Tony." he whispered quickly voice warbling (or so Tony thought) before he stepped back as quickly as he'd come and began barking for Bucky to stop gawking and get them moving as he scurried back aboard.
“We could have stayed with the caravan, something would have come along. I’d have babies of my own. My mother and Rachol would be alive.” He let himself say it. Finally.
Göring had downed drink after drink, huffing passionately about the public unrest and dissatisfaction, glaring all the while like he held Steve personally responsible. Steve felt a vicious kind of pride about that, and he cared dangerously little that it probably showed. Göring  nearly turned purple at one point, sloppy with anger and drink, and was only kept in check by a firm reprimand from the Minister of War.
“The Führer is adamant that we meet his expectations or find someone who can. He wants production completed in four years. He’s firm on this.”
Tony scrambled for his abandoned nightshirt. To his horror he heard a door down the hall creak open. It was the left side, which meant it was the younger boy's room. He hurried to tug the thing over his head, covering his necklace and the love bites Stefen had left on his skin. He dashed back out into the hall just as the first cry from one of the children let out.
“That,” Bucky gestured vaguely at Steve. “Sound all posh and uppity, with your high class German. It makes me want to shit in your mouth.”
"You only need one." Tony announced and Stefen's head reared back slightly with stunned surprise, confusion written all over his face. Bucky scoffed loudly.
“Rather die… eaten by pigs. Free me or kill me. I won't go back.” Steve’s voice petered out completely like a dying automobile, but he held the woman’s gaze.
Once, his goal had been to stop the storm that was the Third Reich because it was the right thing to do. The only thing to do. It was still the only thing to do, but now he wasn’t sure if he could do it if it meant losing his family or Tony, and it terrified him.
For a time, he simply focused on pushing them forward as if he could peddle away from the stress of the last few weeks as easily as he could the villa, leaving it all far behind him. Sara at least seemed to be enjoying the speed. It only took a few minutes before she was giggling in his face, her blue eyes sparkling up at him. He turned a fast corner and she shrieked with glee.
And then Tony imagined so clearly those blue eyes watching him closely as he wiped grease from his brow that Rogers might as well have been looming over him; he could feel their intensity, the spark low in his belly they ignited.
Bucky's eyes snapped to Stefen with desperate longing, his gaze piercing as if he could will Stefen to open his eyes again with his gaze alone.
“Alright, it's time for lunch you said?” Tony placed his hand on Ian's thin shoulder, guiding him towards the door and away from Hammer’s domineering glower. “That's what I thought I'd heard but my hearings been off, what with all the sharp noises. Ian come along.”
He, unlike his sister, couldn’t have been more excited to be in the boat. He jumped up and down in his seat, standing suddenly, eager to watch Ian and Natacha boarding the small one person rowboats Tony had built for them (because apparently when the Rogers’ had purchased their home on the lake and procured a pair of dusty old row boats for their family they’d not foreseen just how fruitful their union would become).
“But it’s just as well. I’d choose to be with you even if there was.” Tony stepped up to his side until they were shoulder to shoulder. He didn’t try and touch Steve, and it was just like him, that some part of Steve wished that Tony would, even though he knew it would hurt. It was good Tony didn’t want to touch him. Steve’s skin felt so sensitive, even the touch of his own shirt against his flesh registered in his broken head as pain sometimes.
“We need to get inside. Go. Quickly,” he ordered, and the murmur of voices died quickly, fear and apprehension creeping back in as the adults scrambled to comply, ushering the children along as quickly as they were able.
Steve took hold of Tony’s hands again, grasping them by the wrists and placing them down by his sides firmly but gently. He removed Tony’s jacket and tie as quickly as his thick clumsy fingers allowed, and undid the buttons on his shirt. He let the articles of clothing fall to the floor at their feet without so much as a glance. Tony did turn his head to look at the pile they made, his mouth twisting in a small smirk.
It appeared that after the Knight of Glass that those Jews who had not been arrested and taken away were trying to flee Germany all at once. Judging by the long lines and raised voices clogging the station with bodies and noise, they didn't appear to be having much success.
“Is it from uncle Bucky? James asked, the other six lighting up at the mention of their favorite and only uncle.
It took them some time, with seven children in tow to choose the perfect tree. And it was something of an ordeal bringing it down. Tony's idea to use the sacks to help drag the tree turned out to be brilliant and allowed all of the children to help out, but that’s just what Bucky got for trying to argue with him over matters of engineering. They’d managed to get the humongous thing back to the house in relatively one piece and installed in the family sitting room without too much mishap.  Stefen went outside to fetch the carp that Harold had caught the day before and left chilling next to the back door. While the children scarfed down the lunch Willamina had left for them, the adults all rolled up their sleeves and began to prepare that night’s dinner.
Bucky lost Steve’s trail at the edge of Tennenlohe forest and spent several days searching the surrounding farmland for signs of him while dodging search parties.  Stefen’s delayed execution and the possible reasons for it was the talk of country, even out here in the farming towns. SS men were traveling from door to door in the village, reminding folks that vagrancy was illegal under the Third Reich and that anyone caught helping vagrants would be dealt with under the harshest penalties.
Much to Charlotte’s surprise Herr Stark did not immediately answer. He considered her silently for a moment, his gaze going to the captain who had turned his attention from the children to Stark, and it seemed to Charlotte that they shared an entire conversation in that glance alone.
Bucky and the other snipers worked more strategically shooting at tires and drivers. He spotted a mounted gun on top of an oncoming kübelwagen after it shot down two of their men in a single pass. Teeth gritted Bucky stood and shoot the gunner through the head before he could begin another. Position blown he started to run, weaving through the trees for cover as bullets pelted around him.
Despite himself, Tony felt a smile tug his lips. Thank god for Artur. He and Sara were the only ones who embraced Tony's rebellious nature with cheer, brimming with such innocently youthful enthusiasm.
Even so, she pressed her lips together and shook her head arguing, “If you could walk faster than Patroche I’d let you. You won’t make it on your own.”
The official was a reedy with a thin pointed face. He regarded them with a polite air of interest. He did not stand to introduce himself when they entered and gave off the aura of someone so dreadfully uninspiring it was hard not to start yawning on principle. By contrast admiral Pike had a commanding presence, no more or less than Tony would have expected from a man of his rank. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and despite the gray at his temples he shook hands with a crushing grip, but there was a kind of intelligent light in his gaze that made Tony slightly optimistic that the man wasn’t just brawn.
“My apologies Herr Stark, but the Captain returned from his travels later than expected and the house is behind schedule.”
He'd not slept the night before, and when the sun had begun it's rise he’d finally given it up as a bad job and thought to go out to the terrace; but halfway there he'd changed his track, heading for the kitchen instead, realizing that this particular morning he did not wish to be alone.
Tony kept silent on that issue, but privately he was grateful when Bucky released an impatient huff of air and shot back, “
"Dance with me," he entreated her with a smile and the girls pretty plump cheeks flushed a violent red. Hortense was always blushing and sighing after him whenever he came to the kitchens.
Stefen was about to do something that would tip the country over into civil war and even if he survived the attempt, the people would tear him apart.
“He’ll be fine. Come now. It's not every day one is placed so close to fame and glory. Enjoy it. While you can.” Schmidt said as he crossed the room to stand in front of Steve. They were nearly the same height. Steve had the strangest impression that in that moment, no matter reality, Schmidt was taller.
She paused, her voice lowering. “Especially when his position needs to be filled as quickly as it does.”
It wasn’t bad… at least it wasn’t supposed to be; but it had felt bad, and it was nothing for the little ones to have seen, and if Frou Hogan knew she likely would not let Tony take them out of the house anymore and Péter wasn’t alone in his desire to escape the confines of their home.
Christ. Tony expelled his breath in a rush, eyes flying open. He could feel tears leaking out of their corners but he didn’t mind them. Couldn’t have stopped them even if he had.
"She has already promised this sentimental old fool a dance," Tony interrupted smoothly and both turned toward them, the young man looked him up and down with a scowl as Tony flashed him with a friendly smile and a showy bow. He extended his hand for Natacha's and prompted, "Frauline?"
“That’s good Stefen.” Bucky replied with what he hoped was cajoling tone. “But you can’t give her this you know that, yeah? Everyone will look at this and see that it is rom. They will wonder why you are giving your woman this. You can’t marry a gadje woman like you marry one of our women, Stevie.”
“Get down, they’re coming.” Bucky waved franticly at Scott and Jons who quickly ducked down inside the bed of the truck. Bucky kicked Harrison’s feet where they stuck out beneath the truck. “And you, numskull, it’s a fucking act. Don’t break our getaway vehicle!”
3. While this fic does make use of some historical names and events, all of these characters are fictionalized, and we encourage you to view any occurrence as such. Out of respect for the subject matter, we have chosen not to focus on Adolf Hitler as a character beyond his necessary presence as an important background figure.
The memory, so clear and cold, stole his breath, and Steve blinked away the sting of tears, hot shame welling up within his chest once more.
Knocking the brush out of her hand Péter grabbed Anamarie's wrist and ran toward the other end of the street, praying that the car didn't reach the corner and spot them before they could duck down it.
"What was that song you used to sing for her?" Stefen asked, something soft but firm in his tone piercing the suddenly strained quiet. Bakhuizen looked up, and for a moment the two shared another of their private looks before he answered.
“We’re already running late and the subterfuge is overkill at this point.” She stuck her hand out for Stefen to shake. Tony grinned at the dark way Stefen glowered at the appendage as if he expected it or the woman to try and bite him. The woman carried on, breezily. “Catherine Bonnaire, I’m here to pick you up.”
“Find. Him.” Tony gritted out, pinning the white road ahead with his stare. “I can handle the rest.”
Stefen grit his teeth. Taking all of them to the opera was going to cost a small fortune. He’d already spent too much on housing them all and Natacha had this hungry look in her eye that didn’t bode well as she eyed the clothing racks.
"Then trust this promise." Stefen squeezed his hands hard as if he thought Tony might try and pull away again. "Trust that no matter what happens I'll take care of you and the children. We'll go to Switzerland and start again together. You, me and the children."
“Janneke Van Dyne is capable, and I’d trust her with anything.” Stefen replied without hesitation but Coulson frowned and shook his head. “Her name is on the list. “
“I may be gone for quite a long time, which will mean a lot of changes around here. Lucky we’ve done this before, right?”
He never should have left. He realized that now. Saw the selfishness of his actions. The pointlessness of trading family for a taste of vengeance. For an ideal.
They were all talking over each other and Steve’s head was pounding with the clamor. His hands shook as he placed them on Ian’s shoulders and he still somehow hadn’t managed to catch his breath. He looked over to Bucky who caught his eye and must have seen the pleading in them because he put two fingers in his mouth and whistled sharply for quiet.
Dvorak cleared his throat, stepping toward the wall with intent to ask about the pictures lining it (anything to fill the silence and stop the woman staring at them) when a floorboard creaked down the hall and a little girl appeared. She scuttled by so quickly it was hard to get a good look at her until she came to rest at the housekeeper’s side.
Letting Tony go now that he was such a part of the house would be just as difficult as letting Sam go had been, or letting Virginia or Hogan go, only worse. It would be the feeling of trying to cut off the flow of blood with a tourniquet. Raw pain with no easing the ache. Steve let out a long breath. His chest felt tight, as if he might start wheezing again the way he had when he was Artur’s size.
Despite the evidence before his eyes it was a moment before Steve really got it that the children were not in danger. They were not so much screaming as yelling, shrieking yes but with childish enthusiasm. They were singing and laughing... playing.
He had that memory, as well as the adornment that Stefen had made him to keep grounded in hope. What did Natacha have?
The dreaded Frauline Werner arrives and both Steve and Natacha must make big decisions with the best interest of the family in mind. Bucky has all of Steve's numbers and comes to the conclusion that Steve's growing feelings are dangerous. Steve's feelings continue to grow and he continues to ignore them - until he really can't (no but really. He can't).
. It would be a shame to continue to allow weaker genetics into the Wehrmacht.  Steve could have thrown his plate at the wall, had to clench his hands in his lap to repress the urge. And the hell just continued.
Natacha jerked. She’d been so enraptured in what was going on below that she hadn’t even realized the nursery door had opened and her younger sisters were standing not far behind her. The shouting must have woken them up. No doubt the boys were awake too, huddled in their beds while they pretended none of it was happening.
“I know. There’s an impenetrable room in this house that would suggest you’re better. We’ve never seen this kind of metal before. Our specialist thinks it might even withstand the drop of a bomb.”
“Stefen…” Tony sounded scared. Which was funny. Funny that they should both realize they scared one another in the same day.
you’ve a fine set of lungs but you’re still singing over your brothers so let’s try something new...”
"Let me handle that. Fear of a no is no reason to back down Péter, remember that." Tony smiled at him again, this one feeling more genuine than the last. Happier somehow. Tony raised himself up from the piano bench and Péter stepped back to walk with him toward the door but halted, surprised when Tony reached for his hand. That was strange, Péter thought at first until it occurred to him with dawning horror that he might still have paint under his nails.
Charlotte's eyes darted to his and this time he knew the fear swimming in them was as much of him as for him. Fear of what he might do. What he might say. The guilt almost knocked his knees out from under him. It was only his children – looking into their anxious faces – that kept him on his feet.
Some were written in German. But many were in other languages, unreadable to Steve but he suspected they carried the same message.
"Singing helps you not to feel so bad." Artur was explaining to Charlotte with a knowledgeable air.  "Tony taught us a special song to sing, we tried to tell you. It really works. Doesn’t it Tony?"
"The captain has given the rest of the staff the night off. It's just Harold and I." she explained succinctly, seemingly unaffected by Tony’s unusual dark mood. She seemed distracted by something, her mind deep in thought even as her body continued about its work, moving to open the back door for him so he could empty out the bucket.
A rough chuckle rumbled from the captain’s chest and he looked just as surprised by it as Tony was. It made something warm glow within Tony’s chest in response, his lips tilting upward in shared mirth as he returned an encouraging smile. While luck was on his side and the captain seemed captivated by his story Tony implored him once more.
* peeks out from hands* Any questions lol? I hope you enjoyed this and you continue to enjoy it despite the difficult subject matter. Please let me know. Authors need food too.
“We deserve a better world,” he rasped through the tightness in his throat, and she paused taking him in in silence. He swallowed thickly, too aware of her eyes on him as he burned with the conflicting need to hide his face in shame and to hold her tight and make her
Rogers was a thorn. One he’d do well to be rid of. It was no surprise to Dvorak to hear of him questioning the mass deportations and the decision to build more camps in Czechoslovakia, in front of the Führer no less! Rogers had always had that insufferable gall, along with that unbending moral code that made him so nauseatingly righteous.
Even in the dark Steve could see that Tony's olive skin was bleach white, though whether that was from fear or from the oozing cuts and bruises across his face was harder to discern. He was hurt, Steve realized with new alarm. His eyes flew over the children once more – thinking of all the situations that could have led to Tony being injured – before flying back to the monk, relieved to see that other than his face he wasn’t visibly bleeding anywhere else.
Steve tried to reach for him, grimacing at the brutal ache and the heaviness that weighed down his limbs. He clenched his teeth together, pushing through the sharp stabs of pain in order to reach. His arm shook terribly, and the pads of his fingers just barely brushed the warm skin of Tony's warm wrist but when he did, Tony stilled and looked down at him. Brown eyes meeting his. Warm skin under his fingers. Real. Alive. Oh god. Please. Please.
"Not anymore he doesn’t. He could barely write two words together on paper, had to ask for help to transcribe almost all of the work. It was embarrassing to watch.” Dvořák laughed.
He could hear the stairwell creak with age it was so quiet. Stefen hadn’t moved a muscle in what felt like hours, but realistically Tony knew was probably only closer to one.
"Did you know about the experiments? " He asked, staring hard at Farkas. "Just how close are the Germans to creating the perfect soldier?"
Tony frowned, considering the thin material that covered her and the pebbled skin on her arms as the child hugged her knees. They'd hung their clothes by the fireplace. When Tony went to examine them, he was relieved to find that they were mostly dry.
"I always eat with you. When I can." Steve amended when Artur frowned at him. "Go get ready, Artur."
Tony had wondered that very morning - as he’d scrapped his cheeks with the dull razor he'd been lucky enough to borrow from one of the laymen who worked the kitchen, thinking on the dust smudged glass and the grey brittle bones of some long dead man whose name had almost nearly faded from the plaque on the front of his glass coffin - if anyone would bother to collect his bones when he died. Grimacing, he’d hoped he would be lain to rest somewhere by the loving hand of some fond friend or lover, and not set to display like the poor bastards in the abbey chapel. Here lies St. Antony of Pola, a fool for love.
Steve blinked. Tony was leaning over him somehow. When had he moved? The bottle in one hand was extended toward Steve's nearly empty glass.
Steve began to step. He was not a good dancer. The music was almost too faint to hear and all wrong for a waltz besides. But Tony kept looking at him, following smoothly where Steve lead, and eventually Steve’s heart slowed.  It didn’t seem to matter to Tony that the music was wrong or that Steve was not graceful. He was lighter than air in Steve’s arms, every shift of his body echoing and calling to Steve’s in such a potent way that he began to wonder if he was truly leading the dance at all. He decided he was okay not knowing.
The hand disappeared and Steve choked in a lungful of air, coughing violently, the room and the voices in it dipping in and out like a wave.
It was obvious to him that Stefen considered the matter settled. Curse him. Stefen must suppose that it was just as easy as a kiss, just as easy as robbing Tony of breath and every thought would just melt out of his head and he’d just become some meek compliant simpering little thing happy to click his heels and say his yes sirs and go along with whatever the captain might wish.  Well, Captain Rogers would just have to think again.
Steve looked the boy over, taking in his well-worn trousers and too big shoes. They looked to be for someone twice his age, but they were sturdy enough and looked like they’d survive long enough for him to grow into. Stefen could well imagine that he must have stuffed them full of newspaper to make up the difference.
"Jann?!" Charlotte gaped at the woman, whom she now recognized under the layer of grime and shabby men's attire. Quickly, she rolled down her window and Janneke leaned against the door frame and poked her head inside.
“And it is such a good heart, Stefen. You give everything to them and all they do is beat you down and whittle you away until-"
“Good. Who does the washing?” Tony interjected, having neither the time or the patience to discuss anything that wasn’t Stefen’s immediate care.
Tony crossed the stage to fetch the instrument from Julia and crossed back to give it to Steve, who looked as if he was contemplating jumping off the stage and making a run from the room.
“How can they do this? How do they expect us to live?” Antonia bemoaned, sitting down heavily in her chair. No one answered because the answer was obvious. They didn’t care how the Jews would live after it was done. Overnight every Jew in the nation would become entirely dependent on the charity of the delegation and under that much more pressure to emigrate. The DELASEM, already understaffed and underfunded, would be overrun. They wouldn’t be able to help them all or get them all out before the worst happened. And the worst was coming.
