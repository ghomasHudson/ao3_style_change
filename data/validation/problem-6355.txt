“Okay good. I…ugh, how is asking someone on a friend outing so much harder than a date? Dates should categorically be more stressful, shouldn’t they? There’s so many more variables at play, and—”
“The little blue thing?” Natasha said incredulously. “The whole world of fantasy pop culture mashups and you go with that?”

“It could be more stuff along those lines,” Bruce grinned, entirely disproving his claim not to be a mind-reader, “but it doesn’t have to be. You look pretty in plenty of things, sweetheart.” Tony reveled in the low heat of Bruce’s tone for a moment, and then the recent mention of Rhodey brought something screaming back to him.
“I’m sorry, JARVIS. I didn’t think about the fact that that would have been upsetting for you, too.”
Content Notes: The submission Tony is practicing in this chapter is the non-sexual, 24/7 variety that has been teased for a few chapters now. So it's not a surprise, but it is something he struggles with, and that represents a very intense form of daily submission. if that's not your cup of tea it might be worth giving this particular chapter a skip; these kinds of scenes will be present in the rest of the story, but not quite with the same level of intensity since the entire focus here is on Tony adjusting to those shifts.
The room was silent except for a soft gasp that came from the direction of Pepper Potts. It came as little surprise to Steve that she was the only one who seemed to realize where this was going. Out of all of them, she and Rhodes were the least self-interested parties in this conversation; much more than trying to maintain particular relationships, they just wanted Tony happy. (Steve wanted that too. Even if it felt like his insides were splintering.)
The whole aftercare thing didn’t really seem like Natasha, but she nodded in decisive agreement with everything Bruce said, and when Tony opened his mouth to offer at least a token protest, her hand drifted lightly over his sore ass in silent reminder. And truthfully, Tony had very little interest in fighting them on this. The aftercare was always embarrassing to think about in the light of day, but in the moment he was sore and exhausted and wanted nothing more than to be coddled and pet and told there was one thing, at least, that he'd gotten right.
“No.” There was a watery laugh (oh god, was Pep crying? hadn’t Tony made her cry enough in one universe?), and then a soft, small hand on his own. At first she just rested her own hand atop Tony’s, but as the seconds passed her attention became more focused as Pepper traced a knowing, deliberate trail over the tiny but innumerable scars and callouses dotting his skin. A jagged mark on the webbing between his right thumb and index, a sovenier from an ill-fated trip to Mexico where he’d drunkenly attempted to prove he could perform a perfect dive into a resort pool without spilling the tequila flight he’d been holding, drew another watery noise that sounded like a laugh from her. (Clearly this pre-Iron Man Tony had been just as much as an idiot as he had been, then.) A different one, a burn just below the knuckle of his left ring finger, she paused over. “Bruce and I were exhausted and the welder got away from one of us. I think it was Bruce, but I can’t be a hundred percent sure anymore.” A couple seconds later, there was a soft pair of lips pressing a kiss lightly onto the scar. (Always trying to make it better, Pep. Even when you know you can’t.) He opened his eyes for that, he couldn’t
“There we go,” Bruce said in satisfaction. The first couple of times the fluid blurted out at once, almost like mini-orgasms. Soon it slowed to a steady, soundless drip-drip-drip. Still, Bruce made no move to stop, or even to slow down the relentless rhythm he’d set.
“There we go, that’ll help you settle down, hmm?” Steve murmured, leaning down to press a kiss against Tony’s jaw, pairing the gentle gesture with a brutal press of his hips that made Tony yelp and then moan around Thor, who roared and uttered several Asgardian curses in reply. (He was careful, though, Steve noticed, cognizant even now of the need to ensure Tony never felt for even a second like he was choking.)
Content Notes: There's a fair amount of sex in this one, both real (Steve and Thor partake of a bondage-heavy scene) and imagined. If you are sex-repulsed or have other questions/concerns before you read, just pop me a line!
“I can be almost anything my submissive requires of me. If they need pain, if they need me to make them bleed and cry and scream, I can. If they seek me out for gentleness, for light touches and soft words, I can provide that as well. There are very few needs I cannot satisfy, and for however long our time together lasts, I feel completely worthy. Guiltless.”
here—had he asked the guy to do nothing but photograph his and Steve’s every movement?) Tony watched him scroll through the images with a soft, open kind expression, commenting occasionally. When they came across an image featuring the two of them tucked into a corner of the room, Steve’s hand on Tony’s lower back while Tony stood up on his toes to mutter something into Steve’s ear, Tony halted the slideshow.
“I thought you weren't that kind of doctor.” Bruce arched a brow and made a sweeping gesture at the room around them.
“Because I trust him to know what I need. What he’s trying to correct here, it’s not just the action but the mentality behind it. He could beat my ass black and blue and never come close to changing that. Sometimes you can only take in so much of those kinds of lessons through the skin, you know?” Tony made a non-committal gesture, and Clint smiled that knowing smile again. “No, you probably have no idea. Not yet, anyway.”
“I don’t know much about the other version of me. You haven’t talked a whole lot about him, at least when I’ve been around. But he sounds like a damn smart guy, one who loves you just as much as I love both versions of you that I’ve known. So I just wanted you to know that he’s doing the same damn thing. No matter which universe you pick, we got this now, buddy.” Rhodey cleared this throat, this little speech clearly at the very limits of his comfort with expressing emotion. “Now wanna help me blow some shit up?”
First, I must note that if Agent Romanov ever learns I have shared this with others, I will likely go missing under suspicious circumstances. Do not believe any communications which allege to come from myself, no matter how convincing they seem.
“I don’t need anything from you right now, Tony, except for you to let yourself feel good. Let it all in. Feel it, let it take you over. I promise we have you.” Phil went to work on his cock, then, massaging all around the head and shaft for long enough that Tony felt himself start to soften several times, and then grow hard all over again. It was like riding endless waves of pleasure, which sometimes happened to correspond with actual arousal and sometimes didn’t. Then Phil reached down with his other hand and pressed a finger at a spot somewhere between his balls and his hole. It felt like nothing he’d ever experienced before, a consuming bolt of white-hot heat that seemed less like something being done to him and more like Phil was acknowledging something Tony hadn’t even known was there.
In the aftermath of truly deep subspace, Tony’s mind was a remarkable thing. In the slightly-less-than 48 hours since his correction from Bruce he’d vacillated sharply between the sweet and nearly wordless state he’d been in when Steve and the others had first arrived and something far closer to lucidity, often involving  highly technical remarks on everything from potential upgrades to the team’s tech to notes he wanted to give to one of the kids who snuck into the lab to work on their projects.
Steve hadn’t spoken in therapy. Again. It was getting absurd, he knew it was, but he had been awake for nearly all of the past three nights dreaming of Tony’s death with renewed vigour, and he was pissed right the hell off that Dr. Domen had dragged all this up again. It felt like it was doing more harm than good, and all Steve wanted at this point was to stuff all this back in the ugly, broken box in his mind that he kept it in most of the time.
“Yeah well…I’ll tell you all about it someday if you want. But today I really did just want to check in and hear about you, and to—and to say I’m sorry. That I haven’t done that in a while. I was a coward, and I was selfish, and I told myself I was staying away for your sake, so that you didn’t end up more hurt and harassed than you already were, but it wasn’t. It was for me, so that I didn’t feel quite so awful seeing it happen up close when I already could barely make it out of bed in the morning. Of all the mistakes I’ve ever made, I think I regret that one most.”
“Yes,” Tony blurted, no hint of his earlier hesitation. He looked across the room at Rhodes, unconditional gratitude and affection painting the lines of his face so clearly that for a moment it felt just as private and intimate a thing to witness as it would have to find the two of them exchanging passionate kisses or caresses. Steve averted his eyes, waiting until Rhodes cleared his throat, clearly trying to gather himself.
“Captain Rogers. I do apologize, but your presence is required in the penthouse.” He groaned, rolling over onto his stomach. Phil must have been up for some time, because the second Steve was in motion Coulson was on his feet, seeking out a fresh pair of dress pants and a collared shirt while Steve was still blinking away the last remnants of sleep.
After watching fondly as the large green figure ambled out of sight, Tony turned his attention back on the living room. There were two piles of paper, one lined and one unlined, on the coffee table, alongside a small selection of pens ranging from a simple ballpoint to one of Tony’s most expensive fountain pens. Coulson’s intent was more than clear, and while Tony had kind of brought the apparent ban on tech during ‘homework’ time on himself by using it to cheat on the last round, that didn’t mean he couldn’t be grumpy about having to return to the stone age.
“They’re never going to find where I parked my car.” It was a dickish answer, the kind of reply Tony only gave reporters nowadays when he either really hated them or really didn’t want to answer the question. (In the case, it was both.) When he glanced at Pepper he expected a head shake, or some other visible sign of disapproval. She flashed the peace sign and accompanied it with a little wink. Oddly enough, receiving tacit permission to keep avoiding this line of inquiry made it somehow more tolerable to offer something at least slightly more gracious. “Look, without getting into too much detail because a man’s dying thoughts should definitely get to be his own, I wished for what most people probably wish for: more time.”
“And are restaurants in this universe BYO condiments or…” Tony waved a hand at the Heinz clutched in Steve’s left hand, and for the first time, Steve looked ever so slightly flustered.

Other days…other days were not like that at all. Sometimes Tony rankled at the control, at the way the team wanted access to his body and his time and his mind, at the way they
He expected it to come pouring out of him like a sieve once he had broken through that first barrier. It didn’t. It felt like he was trying to drag the words out, as if they weighed too much for even his strength to bear and were determined to stay lodged forever in his gut.
“I went to the Dom as promised. The shrink has the paperwork to prove it. So if this is some kind of babysitting exercise it’s really not necessary, Director.”
Natasha drew her feet towards her, then threw them up onto the coffee table instead. Clint yelped and just managed to prevent his bowl of sun chips from meeting an untimely end.
“I…seven, maybe. I slept on my front a bit longer than I should have last night.” He heard the low scratch of pen on paper as Bruce made a note to himself.
“Mmm. How good it is to see you this happy, mostly. And wondering if you want to finally go on that date we’ve been talking about. Pepper mentioned there’s a benefit coming up, the Maria Stark Foundation?” Tony stiffened in his arms, just for a matter of seconds, but it was enough to rouse Steve’s slumbering protective instincts. “What is it?” Tony shook his head and aimed another kiss at Steve’s neck, just under his ear. But Steve had learned tricks of his own by now.
“Right. Do you want to…hang out or something? I want to enjoy my newfound freedom a little but I don’t really know where to go especially with all the press and everything, and I thought with all your explorations lately, you might have some ideas.”
“Oh hell no. She’s like the sweetest little dictator you’ve ever met. I’m pretty sure she would figure out a way to take me offline before I could manage anything close to an actual coup.”
“Good. Keep that in mind please, then, and use it if you need to. For right now you and I are going to have a little conversation, and you’re going to remember to answer just the questions I’m asking you, and that you are
Tony and the team both struggle in the aftermath of his breakdown. Steve watches Talia and Masdee grow closer as he considers his own next move.
“I think your decision to attempt to build a foundation of friendship with Mr. Stark, regardless of whether or not anything else evolves from there, was a wise one. But we still need to ensure that you’re focusing on valuing yourself and your life beyond that particular dynamic. Were you able to complete the brainstorming exercise I suggested?” Steve’s heart sank. He’d completely forgotten about his ‘homework,’ too focused on the other and more immediate demands on his time and energy over the last several days. “That’s fine. We’ll just try to think this through aloud then. When do you feel best outside of your romantic and sexual relationships? What takes a particular day from just bearable to something better than that?”
Things stopped being particularly funny after that, though. That sense of anticipation Tony had been feeling all day was at a fever pitch. Even though they obviously knew more about what was coming than he did, the team seemed to be feeling some of it too. They were unusually quiet as they made their way into the playroom and settled in. Tony wished abruptly that he wasn’t already naked, the panties and sweater having become unwearable after his scene with Steve. It was already so much to have all of their attention focused on him; having some kind of advantage, even a scrap of lace, would have been nice.
differently in this suit. Steve didn’t totally understand what nanotechnology was or how it worked, but the sounds of the motors and servos that had allowed the older version of the suit to move were notably absent, Tony’s stride smoother and far closer to how he moved outside of the suit. He made a gesture with his hand and the helmet portion of the armour melted away as seamlessly as it had appeared so that he and Steve were eye-to-eye. It was the most confident he had seen Tony since he’d arrived there, jaw set and head held high, and it was a bittersweet thing to realize that Tony seemed to believe in Iron Man in a way that he couldn’t conceive of believing in himself.
“Hush now, Just warming up the rest of you, Tony. You don’t need to beg for this. You don’t even really know what you’re begging for yet, hmm?” He keened, frustration and humiliated arousal warring in him at Bruce’s almost dismissive reaction to his pleas. Bruce skipped down a few inches, avoiding his kidneys, and landed for the first time on Tony’s ass. The blow rocked through him, and it felt like imploding. “Perfect. I think we can get started now.”
After the coffee meeting was finally, mercifully over, Tony found himself in a car with no clear direction to give the driver. He considered going back to the Tower, but he’d spent the last two days holed up there with Nat and Bruce, and that had been…intense.
“I doubt that very much,” Steve said drily. Across from him, Bucky snickered and flashed a thumbs up in Clint’s direction. (On the rare occasions where those two were remotely submissive at the same time they amped up each other’s brattiness to the nth degree. It was as charming as it was terrifying.) “But to answer your question…well, I guess the only thing that was out of the ordinary happened a couple of days ago.”
“Find Bucky,” he ordered, his own system calming in response to Natasha’s discontent. “The two of you…I know I haven’t always handled it well, how violent you both sometimes need to be with each other, but I’ve seen first-hand how much it can help. Go find him, work some of this out, and don’t go back to the penthouse until you’ve had at least five hours of sleep.”
Tony answered his call on the first ring, as he always did. The sound on the suit’s internal speakers was perfect; Peter could recognize the kinds of background noise that meant Tony was at SHIELD, and he knew a brief moment of guilt for having interrupted before he was babbling out a rushed explanation of an invisible man. He was almost grateful when Tony interrupted him mid-sentence.
Rhodey sat on a chair beside the bench, holding both of Tony’s hands. This, Tony felt, was a way better option than the cuffs that were attached to the arm rests.
And oh but how he wanted to run then. Even though he didn’t fully understand it, Tony knew (or at least suspected) enough to realize that he’d just dropped a bomb on them, shaken something they considered immovable and permanent. Once he had striven for these kinds of reactions in people, had delighted in witnessing the exact moment where they realized how incomplete and narrow their perspectives were. But now…now, Tony was tired. So fucking tired. And the last thing he wanted was to watch the way both Natasha and Clint immediately turned to Coulson, seeking guidance that, from the way Phil seemed to have frozen in place in his spot near the fireplace, Coulson couldn’t offer. Or the way Thor took several cautious steps toward Bruce, preparing to have to contain the Hulk if it became necessary. (For very different reasons, Tony didn’t hazard glances towards Rhodey or Barnes at all.)
So last chapter was a little polarizing (which is totally fine! You were all still very kind in your feedback, and I think it's good that you aren't always of one mind about how things are playing out.) I hope this one felt a bit more soothing, though, and that those of you who have been anxious for answers on Bucky are enjoying hearing from him!
Tony learns more about Pepper's struggles with the board, and is filled in about Steve's pilot program; Steve and Tony continue to take slow steps toward building a friendship.
Maybe it was weird. And maybe (probably) Tony would come to regret this decision someday. But right now the very last thing he wanted was for yet another version of his team (especially these particular people) to hide themselves away from him and call it kindness.
“You—every single thing about you—are precisely what we need. We just want to make sure we are what you need too, Anthony. That is our responsibility and our privilege.” Tony seemed so happily overwhelmed by that that Steve expected that to be the end of his active participation in the conversation, but as they all rose to prepare for sleep, he stayed on his knees.
“N-no, no, no,” he whimpered as she slid off of Tony enough to reach down and begin removing the cocking. “You can leave it, it’s okay. I didn’t mean it, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” The cockring was off now, and his cock twitched and dripped into Natasha’s hand.
A memory of a bright laugh and dishevelled, surfer-blonde hair sticking up like a porcupine after swimming brought Clint to mind, and Rhodey nodded to himself. Barton had his own issues just as they all did, but he felt a lot more accessible and plain-spoken than most of the others. He sent the message before he could let himself dither about it any longer.
An excellent question that I am deeply pleased was asked. Trues are venerated enough in most parts of the world that many countries offer subsidies for one or both partners to remain home; there are also legal protections that force employers to make flexible arrangements for True employees who wish to complete the majority of their work from home.
With pain dancing across his legs, and then his feet, and even on his nipples a couple of times (and the control it must take for Steve to aim the way he did, avoiding entirely the parts of Tony’s chest that were more fragile from years of harsh treatment), the next dildos were easier to bear. By the fourth, which was ribbed all over and and at least as wide as the average cock, he was harder than he’d ever been in his life. Every hit to his prostate was shattering.
“…have no reason to believe that their equipment is advanced enough to block or otherwise mislead our trackers. They are here, and close, they’re simply more advanced at stealth than we had anticipated.” That was C’Chemi, reporting back on what sounded like another fruitless scouting mission. Steve had never heard her sound quite so frustrated.
“Yes and no. I…a lot of what works for me about you guys is the differences, not the similarities. You’re a lot more likely to be disappointed by the changes than I am. And honestly, I already have enough issues with…well, a lot of shit, but self-worth and being set up to fail are pretty high up there. This really just waves a giant red flag in front of that metaphorical bull, doesn’t it?”
“So who’s this one for?” Again, Natasha answered by producing an object: this time, the arc reactor that Tony had removed from his own chest earlier that night. Steve reached out and laid a fond hand on the smooth glass,
“Naw, just already regretting that tonight will eventually be over, and wishing I could live it and archive every part of it at the same time,” Steve confessed with a self-depreciating smile. Tony made a quiet, thoughtful noise, which Steve honestly thought very little about for the rest of the song as he held Tony close, sliding his hand up from Tony’s waist every once in a while to toy with his curls.
“Oh Stevie is that what you been thinkin’? Course I miss him. I miss him all the fuckin’ time. Miss him whenever there’s coffee leftover in the pot at the end of the morning, and every time I look at my arm, or Dummy does something especially ridiculous. Mostly I miss him whenever I look at you, because it feels like I lost you both that day.” Bucky bowed his head, and this time he was the one gripping Steve as if trying to press his fingers into Steve’s very marrow. “We’ve been excited to have some version of Tony here because he’s sweet and funny and kind, so much like our Tony but different too. Careful in a way ours wasn’t, and so hurt by the world that sometimes I swear I could just blast my way into the other universe and…the point is, don’t think I don’t care for him on his own terms, I do. But I, at least, have also been excited about having him here because I felt like maybe his coming home might bring you back to us too.”
May was babbling, and Tony absolutely hated it. May Parker was one of a very select group of people who had never been afraid or in awe of Tony Stark, the mask or the reality . Across two universes she had yelled at him the first time they’d met, and he had always treasured the unique blend of fear and affection her presence provoked in him. Now she was rushing to reassure and apologize, which meant she knew two things: that Peter wasn’t coming, and that it hurt Tony a lot more than he was willing to admit. Avoiding her gaze, his eyes wandered over to the dining room table. The Avengers rarely used it, preferring to eat in front of the television or in the kitchen, but today it had been carefully set with gleaming china and silver cutlery. Tony had dug the stuff out of storage; it wasn’t the fanciest or most expensive set in the Tower, not by far. Tony’s own parents never would have gone for the colourful splashes of painted wildflowers, or the thin gold leaf encircling the borders. But for Edwin and Anna Jarvis, who had saved for months for this particular set after their wedding, it had been perfect. (And yet Jarvis still hadn’t yelled at Tony in his old universe when he’d chipped one of the small dessert plates. He would bet that the crack in one of the tea cups here spoke to a similar lesson about mistakes and forgiveness that Howard Stark, with all his power and privilege, had never managed to convey as gracefully or lovingly as his butler.)
Tony shivered, and this time he was pretty sure it had nothing to do with the drop that was still pressing at the edge of his consciousness. Sure, he was starting to get a little cabin-fever staying trapped in the Tower, but his isolation also meant a level of privacy and security that he hadn’t had in…well, for pretty much as long as he could remember. The press and the public had been a part of his life since he’d been born; as Howard Stark’s son, he’d smiled far more often for reporter’s cameras than the Polaroid that made very rare appearances in the Stark household. (Come to think of it, that might have belonged to Edwin and Anna Jarvis, not Howard and Maria.) He’d been not only encouraged but actively coached to behave as if the public’s eye was always on him, and those lessons had taken almost too well. Even in his most intimate moments, the people Tony had loved best in his own universe had sometimes struggled to work their way through his multiple layers of masks and shields.
“Uh…I guess I’d rank thudding a little higher than the other options.” (Steve’s mind helpfully supplied several mental images of both his own Tony and the one in front of him sprawled over Steve’s lap taking a paddle. He took another swig of juice, this time right out of the container.)
“Because!” Tony snapped, stunned that he was facing this reaction for a second time, especially from the one person who should have known better. “Because it’s a nightmare! I don’t fit here, or there, I don’t make sense anywhere anymore. And no, I didn’t really want SI to get the chance to out me, but now I’m just going to live forever as someone else, someone who knew who he was and what he needed. And you can’t even
So I have cried writing three chapters of this story, and this was one of them! But I'm happy with how it turned out, and I hope you all enjoyed it too!
“My aunt is in an assisted care facility. Everyone there tries their best, but the facility is very underfunded and understaffed. I’ve been doing some reading lately about the use of robotics in care facilities; they can perform simple tasks to free up support staff’s time, plus the more advanced ones have been shown to aid cognitive processes and emotional stability by making basic conversation with residents.” Tony used a holoscreen to take notes, nodding his encouragement; eventually, other suggestions started pouring in fast enough that Pepper began taking her own notes in an effort to just keep up.
“Please what, darling?” (Oh God she was going to make him say it, what if he asked for the wrong thing, what if she laughed and told Tony that he didn’t deserve it, didn’t deserve anything, he hadn’t even been able to save her the first time, and what if what he’d done to try to fix it  hadn’t worked, what if she was still—)
“Oh hey Pete. Ready to play with vibranium? Shuri sent a bunch of her own research along with the raw materials, so it’s possible you’ll want to call May. We might be here awhile.”
“You’re okay. We’re going to make this better. You’re going to be alright, okay? You remember what to do if it gets to be too much?” Bruce prompted.
“He’s not going to need the sleeve.” The words felt far away and abstract, like they came from another language he wasn’t sure he was properly translating. If his eyes hadn’t still been open and trained on Bucky, he wouldn’t have even recognized who had spoken.
“I like you,” he said simply. “I want to be more than friends with you, have for a long time now. There were reasons it needed to wait, some of them pretty legitimate. Others, Bucky has repeatedly informed me, are bullshit. And I'll probably have more screw-ups like that. This is so complicated, both our histories with other people and with each other, but I’m done letting that stop me. If I’ve read things wrong and you aren’t interested, or you need to think about it, then there’s no pressure, I don’t mean that. But from my side of things, I’m thoroughly sick of the whole ‘out of time’ thing. For once I want to just be right where I am, with exactly who I’m with, and I’d really like it if that included you.”
(The Author asks that I provide a content warning for allusions to child neglect, alcohol abuse, and something she calls “Howard Stark’s A+ Parenting.” I can only hope the latter is sarcastic. As annoying as his spawn is, I would not consider Howard Stark a model for adequate parenting.)
Thank you for your understanding and support of myself and the rough last chapter! This one should  be a little more polished, though knowing me there may still be some errors.
She and Clint exchanged heated words near the elevator. The submissive part of Tony’s brain hated hearing the frustration in Clint’s voice, and longed to soothe and beg forgiveness and make it better for his…for the Dominant. The rest of him just plain hated the idea of one of his potential partners in open conflict with one of Tony’s oldest friends. Finally, Clint seemed to lose the struggle between them, because Pepper strode toward the couch and sank into one of the armchairs with a heavy sigh.
To be fair, Rhodey had tried numerous times to avoid punishing Tony. He’d given him several reminders to get out of bed, had gone through everything they’d already covered about the importance and value of sticking to the schedule. Except where that conversation had initially left Tony feeling warm and safe and cared for, today it had just left him pissed off. He barely acknowledged his body’s other basic needs like sleep and food, and now he had this whole other set of needs that everyone kept insisting had to be met. It was infuriating and embarrassing and Tony just hadn’t wanted to deal with them today. He’d told Rhodey as much, though there had been a lot of swearing mixed in there, along with vows that Tony wouldn’t be putting up with any more of this shit for the duration of his stay. When he’d finally finished ranting at his friend, Rhodey had stood there staring at him for several long beats, then sighed heavily.
“Have you and Carol met yet? If you haven’t, you really should. I’m sure she would love the homage.”
Which brought him back to the door in front of him, which had just opened without him ever knocking on it, because Stephen Strange would always be a dick no matter what universe he was in. Tony took one longing look back, still unsure even now if he truly wanted the answers he was seeking, and then stepped into the house.
“And you know when to use it?” Clint pressed, clearly not intending to address the complete bafflement he’d provoked in his partner.
Did you SEE the way @SteveRogers looked at @YouKnowWhoIAm during the press conference? So tender. So pure. I just wanna squish their faces together. #AlwaysShipIt #TrueLove #IBelieveTonyStark
And now the ball is finally rolling! Your comments and kudos on part one were very much appreciated; I'm already having so much fun talking about this fic with you all! Please keep them coming; questions, specific moments/scenes you liked or are looking forward to, I love hearing it all!
“I loved my time at SHIELD. It felt…it was the first time I’d really gotten the chance to build something up instead of just tearing it down. I wasn’t sure until that point, until I saw it really starting to work, that I was even capable of that, you know? But it’s time. SHIELD needs someone like Tony, now, someone who revels in—maintenance, I guess. Constantly refining something. He’s never, ever satisfied, never lets himself off the hook, and that’s exactly what SHIELD needs now.” Somewhere around halfway through this rambling explanation, Steve realized that Dr. Domen’s tablet wasn’t in her hands. For the first time, it hadn’t even come out of her bag. “Wait, no notes? Am I boring now?” She smiled and took a sip from the steaming cup of peppermint tea he’d made her at the start of their session.
“We know that. We took a great deal of care to ensure you wouldn’t, and for once the universe didn’t manage to interfere with our plans.” Phil held the welder out without even looking at Tony as he spoke, clearly so certain he was correct about what Tony wanted that he didn’t require visual confirmation. Tony snatched it gracelessly by the handle.
This is an interesting question. The previous Stark’s relationship with SI was, I would say on the whole, a more distant one. Much like the MCU version of the man, the D/s universe’s Stark turned the company away from weapons after his time in captivity, but especially after making Ms. Potts CEO of the company and shortly thereafter being outed as a sub, Stark completed most of his work for the company without interacting directly with anyone beyond Ms. Potts herself.
“I do. I have seen much of death and its companions in my time, and its spectre never grows easier to encounter.” Thor sounded old, then, so much closer to his actual age than he usually did that Tony looked up at him with a start. Thor’s answering gaze was steady and unshrinking, so unlike the shifting eyes and awkward avoidance Tony had been getting from the others. He let himself drink that in for just a few seconds longer than was probably polite.
If Tony had seemed surprised and almost greedy to take in Coulson’s presence, his reaction to Jarvis trumped that by several magnitudes. He wavered on his feet (leading Steve to really realize for the first time that the other man was bleeding from at least one gash on his face, and perhaps elsewhere judging from the awkwardness of his stance) and made this…sound. If asked before today Steve would have confidently claimed to be familiar with every sound Tony Stark was capable of making: the almost beatific joy his tone took on when he monologued to himself (or Bruce) about science, his moans and cries and pleas during sex, the very specific belly-laughter that only his and Clint’s silly inside jokes could seem to coax out of him. He’d heard Tony rage and beg and fight and fuck, and he’d never heard anything like the noise that his own AI’s voice wrenched from the man in front of him.
“Sir, Peter Parker is requesting entrance to the penthouse. He appears rather agitated. Shall I allow him inside?”
?” She released an explosive sigh and brushed a stand of dark, curly hair impatiently away from her face.
Coulson sat back in his chair and frowned, staring at a spot somewhere past Tony’s left ear in thought.
It was a sight Tony had, of course, witnessed once before, but it couldn’t have been more different. When Steve had knelt then it had been meaningless to Tony except as a first stomach-dropping indication of the whole world of differences that stood between them. He knew, now, what it cost Steve to go against all his natural instincts, how badly he must want to make this gesture. Gesture wasn’t even the right word, though…a gesture had been what it was before, when the kneeling had been all about ritual. Steve had gone to his knees with grace, then, a smooth, flowing and soundless motion. Today he crashed loudly to the floor, knees colliding harshly with unforgiving hardwood. Steve didn’t seem to care one way or the other about how much that had to hurt, but whether because he knew how unnatural a position this was for Steve, or just because he hated seeing him bring himself more pain, Tony couldn’t stand it. He went to his knees too, slipping his hands under Steve’s kneecaps with his palms up, forming a protective barrier. (For all his anxiety about kneeling in front of the team rather than during secret shame sessions, suddenly Tony felt like he was the graceful one in this pose, the one to whom it felt almost disturbingly natural.)
“I feel awesome,” Tony volunteered before Bruce could even ask. His Dom had started his exam with Tony’s legs today, carefully prodding at the places where he’d been tied to the spanking bench. It was a relief and a disappointment to not be touched where the pain was the worst, but this was at least a comforting reminder of everything that had happened the day before. Bruce chuckled again, and this time he wasn’t alone.
After several failed attempts at sleep, Tony had given the whole thing up as a bad job and retreated to the workshop. He’d managed to fill close to an hour with rearranging various parts and tools to reflect his own preferences rather than Mark II’s. This at least made the place feel a little bit less uncanny, plus he would stop stabbing his fingers on the skillsaw when he was reaching for wrenches.  However, it didn’t solve the larger issue, which was simply that Tony didn’t actually have anything to do down here.
Steve took his time with the aftercare, lavishing Phil with praise and touch and small acts of service. Usually, this would have been enough to keep Coulson in that sweet, quiet place for hours, but it had been less than forty minutes when the other man glanced at his watch, and then nudged Steve.
“One of the only ways that Tony…our Tony was comfortable demonstrating submission in public was when we went out for food. He absolutely adored being hand fed, and whatever qualms he had with his submission were never enough to take that from him. I’m telling you this partially because when we’re finally ready to go public, there will undoubtedly be events involving food and you need to know that people will be expecting it. That isn’t some kind of ultimatum; if it’s not something you’re comfortable with then we’ll find another way. But lately, I’ve been trying to figure out how to make your problems with food easier.”
At a certain point after the Civil War, Tony though the had truly grown immune to Cap’s speeches. He hadn’t, however, counted on how much more effective they would be when not blanketed in hypocrisy or naivety as the other version’s so often were. Steve knew what he was saying; he was self-aware enough to truly own the implications of these words. Tony hung his head, a deep sense of shame and regret taking over from the last remnants of self-righteous anger. The team had done nothing but show him, over and over again for months, that they loved and supported him, and Tony had responded by letting his own shitty self-worth and fear overtake that knowledge. He had almost ruined everything; hell, maybe he still had.

“Are you kidding? I’ve dreamed of being here since…well, you know how long. I might never leave!” In his attempts to upsell the move, Peter very nearly gave away too much. His aunt’s gaze went from wistful and nostalgic to sharp and dangerous in a matter of seconds. How could Peter have been so stupid? May’s worst fear was precisely that, that Peter would find himself feeling trapped by fate and circumstance and accept superheroing as a life path rather than an occasional side-gig. That living in the Avengers HQ might push him further down such a path had been virtually her only argument against the relocation.
“Because you were already struggling enough to adjust to the idea of him being gone involuntarily, let alone…well, something more complicated. I know you and Tony have had your ups and downs over the years, but I genuinely believe that he was trying to do you a kindness here.”
Another excellent question, and one whose answer is tied up both in ongoing scientific investigations as well as more complex social and psychological factors.
What he hadn’t expected, though, was to feel nervous on his first ‘real’ day of work. It was just SHIELD and Coulson, after all, Tony had rebuffed and mocked both numerous times in his own universe. But then, he mused, things might have turned out very differently for his team and his world if SHIELD hadn’t fallen with such dramatic finality. This felt weirdly like a second chance.
The rest of the week seemed to crawl by for Steve. Seeing just how well SHIELD had run without him left Steve both proud and increasingly unsettled. It was a very real relief to meet his team for dinner when Friday evening finally arrived. Bucky had suggested the restaurant; it was new and trendy and they likely never would have gotten in without using Tony’s real name to make the reservation, but Steve was glad they had.
To add to the thoroughly bizarre atmosphere having industrial rock playing in Coulson’s office made, the man himself also wasn’t in the ergonomic monstrosity of a chair that he always sat in to do paperwork. Coulson was seated on the front edge of his desk, the top button of his shirt undone and his tie slightly loosened. He was undoubtedly still in Agent mode, but he was also going out of his way to make small concessions, to let hints of Phil in, too.
lose him again.” By the end, Bruce’s calm had evaporated, the grief they all tried to keep hidden from Tony suddenly so raw and exposed that even watching the footage felt like a profound violation.
Tony wanted to be able to look at it that way, he really did. Rhodey seemed so genuinely relieved, and Tony would have given just about anything to feel that way too. Instead,  it felt like being in the middle of a panic attack, but without his body having the actual energy to go through with the whole thing.
“You could try white noise?” In the face of this rather unexpected response, Peter was now the one silent a bit too long, his fork hovering inches above his pancake like someone performing surprise in a movie. “I have some of the same problems. When Dr. Erksine was shot immediately after they gave me the serum the noise was so bad I was sure for just a second that I was the one who had been hit. When I came up here, especially after the rebuild when it was just me a lotta the time, my system didn’t know how to handle it either. FRIDAY can pipe in a whole buncha sounds though, and even mix them together. I really like this one—what is it, FRIDAY?”
. Okay? I know I owe you, I know it was shitty that I lied before. But this assignment, it’s…I can’t fucking do it. Ask me something else, anything else.” At last, Phil set his tablet and coffee down. He still didn’t get off the couch, though, nor did he seem to understand how thoroughly fucked up this assignment of his was proving Tony Stark to be. He was actually smiling a crooked, mischievous little grin that felt like it should have belonged to Clint or maybe Bucky. Tony wondered how it was possible to be both highly suspiciously and very slightly turned on by a smile.
“Not sure what you mean, Cap. This is who I am. Shouldn’t have signed on the dotted line if you weren’t up for the whole package, you know?” There was a hint of a snarl in Tony’s voice, and a curl in his lip, and he hated himself so fucking much, why would he do this now, right when he was about get everything he had wanted since…god, fucking forever?
It was always a little unclear which version of the man he should expect on any particular day. Given that Peter’s own feelings toward Tony Stark’s sudden presence in his life ranged from annoyance to something dangerously close to the hero-worship he’d felt as a child, he was mostly fine with living in this contradiction. On his first day as an official Stark Industries intern, though, he hadn’t really expected to enter the workshop to find it blaring with deafeningly-loud boomer rock (Zepplin, maybe?) Tony shooting arrows that, rather than hitting the wall, made U-turns midway across the room and shot back in his direction was also rather a surprise.
“Rhodey?” The movie noise got quieter and Tony’s own body shook with the force of Rhodey’s gentle chuckles.
Kissing this Steve was everything and nothing like that. It was possession and desperation and lust, of course it was. Steve parted Tony’s lips and licked his way into his mouth with brutal insistence, a dizzying dance of teeth and tongue that refused to modulate its intensity even for a second. Steve gorged himself as if he would never get enough, coming up for air only when one or both of them were gasping for it, and diving back in the second he could as if it had been millennia since they’d had the chance to touch. When he decided he wasn’t in possession of enough of Tony’s mouth, Steve growled and tipped Tony’s head backward so that the base of his skull was pressed right against his own back, and then deepened the kiss unimaginably further.
After weeks of being on guard against precisely this kind of overreach, Peter’s initial temptation was to dive right into the scene below the streetlamp on which he was perched out of sheer spite. It was a surprisingly short-lived impulse, though. Oh he was still pissed, and he and Tony would be having numerous conversations about the fact that Peter was very nearly a whole-ass adult and not in need of rescuing. After months of coming home to May in various states of injury, though, he knew the kind of fear that manifested as anger. Whatever this thing was, it had Tony freaked right out.
Taskmaster stood over the prone form of the Iron Man suit. He wore the same white, skeletal mask as always, but he’d never bothered to fix it after Steve’s brutal beat-down weeks prior. It was cracked in several places and outright shattered in others, revealing a series of barely-healed fractures and abrasions in the early stages of scarring. Somehow the sight of the man’s skin made him look less human than when he wore the full mask, particularly when he leaned down close enough the cool blue of the arc reactor that the light mixed with the angry red of the marks to create a sickly, unnatural hue.
“So Peter, who do you think would win in a fight? Darth Vader or Stitch?” Clint demanded, with the seriousness of someone asking if he would consider being an organ donor.
“Calls herself Hawkeye,” Tony informed him proudly. “No, Clint doesn’t know yet, and yes I will record every micro expression when he finds out. It’s going to be next-level hilarious. Maybe I should sell tickets instead. America, now!”
“If you let me feed you, you can wear these while I do it,” Clint offered. Steve’s breath caught; he looked again at the elevator, caught between a desire not to intrude and an equally strong wish to not miss a single second of this. Clint peered at Steve over his shoulder and grinned. “Gonna have a seat, Cap?”
“I should never have…that is, I know Tony, the other Tony, I know he was responsible for maintaining his own relationships. But I also know that I could have done a lot more, as his Dominant and his teammate and his friend, to encourage him to reach out to you. I didn’t.”
Tony ignores him and walks out. Steve trails after him, naked and not concerned about it in the slightest.
“Shut up.” Bucky shakes him, just a little, “We’ve got to get out of here. Best chance of survival.”
“I’m in love with you.” Steve replies, “It’s really quite terrible. I can’t sleep when you’re hurting, and I worry when you’re upset.”
Then again, Steven thinks, tasting the pungent fear in the man by his side, perhaps it would be kinder to leave him at base.
It goes on for a while, fifteen, maybe, twenty moments through which Steven seems to loosen again, incremental and beautiful.
The battle has run its course, and he’s painted red and brown with its colours. He’s tired. Deep and seeping.
He weeps, quiet and broken into Steve’s heart. Bucky sheathes his sword, and after a quick look at Steve, moves into camp, dragging Stane’s corpse, detached head under his arm and body being dragged by the leg.
“For a moment only.” Steven says, “And I understand, though I wish you had told me earlier, if only to not make me a fool in front of Hammer.”
Anthony’s hands catch at the armour’s latch, and he looks up to the blond Alpha. His face is solemn, eyes curious where they meet Anthony’s.
Steve gets on his knees in front of Tony, waits until the man meets his gaze, “I need to hear you end it. If that’s what this is, I’ll accept it. I’ll leave. But no false endings. Not anymore.”
It is pure Alpha, and if Anthony put out his tongue, he would swear that he could taste the power that flowed out of him, could
“Oh heavens.” Anthony startles, and it sets Steven off again, laughing raucously. “Shut up, Steve. Good heavens, what am I going to do with
Steven is drawing him in before he can sit properly, and Anthony finds himself on the Alpha’s lap. Steven’s hands are brands on Anthony’s head, pulling him close, mouth meeting the meat of his neck, breathing hotly over his pulse point. There are a few quiet moments spent like this, breathing each other in. Anthony brings his arms reassuringly over the breadth of Steven’s arms, watchful for any injuries.
They keep moving, and Anthony can’t see ahead. Bucky keeps coughing, and Anthony rests his head on Bucky’s armoured back, feeling lightheaded. He wishes he still had his helmet.
Steven comes to a stop at Anthony’s feet, kicking Stane down next to him. The man groans, thick and choked. Steven gives Anthony a bloody, hard smile.
“Oh, yeah.” Tony kicks the clumps into a corner and when that doesn’t really work, sighs and leans down to move them with his hands.
“Hang on.” Steven says, taking the dagger, and before Anthony can blink, slices a line on his chest. Anthony tilts his head, and sighs as Steven gathers the blood.
“Uh, hang on,” Steve pulls his phone out and turns it on again. As they wait, he meets his mom’s gaze, quiet and watchful in her chair. She smiles, a hint of worry apparent in the way it curls at the corner.
Anthony pulls off Steven’s cock, languidly, feeling the drag of his length tickle his throat as it slips back out, slick with spit and pre-cum.
There’s conversations to be had, of course. Tony has been mapping them out in his head, exchanging thoughts in quiet moments with Bucky, knowing Steve’s likely to resist any form of real external help. The serum was perfect for him, gave him the tools he needed to fight the battles he’d always wanted to fight. It’s difficult to conceive of the ways in which it’s chipped at him, taken his humanity and scraped the edges blunt. Imperfection is not a quality Steve has the privilege of showing. It’s a secret they share, the three of them, the captain with his two moons, his lover and his brother. But it’s a burden too, and one that’s becoming visible outside of their orbit.
There is silence, all around, for a moment. The hole in the gate, exposing a courtyard of Hydra agents, a number of them thrown back by the cannonball, takes all sound, directs attention to the sheer force of what just happened.
Silence had followed and Steve had knelt down to kiss Tony’s chest, fingertips still playing at his jaw.
“I want Steven, I don’t want to be here anymore.” Anthony says, numbly. He needs to stop talking. He needs to get a grip. He needs to – he needs to not be here.
“You’re losing.” Clint calls in response, “Your soldiers are dying, your army will soon fall to us.”
His mind begins to untangle the situation, somewhere in the corner of his consciousness that is always thinking, quietly working out possibilities, storing ideas that no one wants to hear from an Omega; complex and ready. Always ready, but never heard.
Bucky teaches him like he would teach another Alpha, with the only accounting for his designation being in prioritising speedier and underhanded tactics over power knockouts.
“It is personal for all of us now.” Steven narrows his eyes, “Do you think it would be impersonal for me?”
.” Schmidt’s mouth purses around the word like a slur, “You have always been shortsighed. All of you, but possibly the Captain.”
He’d spent the debrief with his hands curled around the flat of his chair, eyes skipping between the clock and the agenda on the whiteboard. He hadn’t ever been the type to fidget but sitting there with Peggy’s steady voice droning on in the background, he’d felt like he was going to break out of his skin.
“Would you listen to me?” Bucky grits out, and Tony huffs in frustration, “No, seriously, look. He’s gone in his head, alright? Halfway through the mission, I don’t know what it was, had him shaking throughout the drop and when we’re in the field, he goes hard. Harder than he needs to, and Carter noticed it, alright. Tried to pull him out but he disabled the comms unit.”
But this morning, it was Anthony who held him, who gave him soft promises of the future he had planned out for them. Steven had been trembling too hard, gaze far away in the initial aftermath of their mating. Anthony knew he’d come back to himself when the Alpha had stilled, ears prickling as he listened with eyes wide with longing at Anthony’s tentative thoughts about having pups.
Anthony smiles in response, but it is a smile from his first few weeks with the pack. A false, tight expression. Steven comes closer, and in a quick, uncertain motion, kisses the omega’s cheek.
“Why would you even get me a goose?” Anthony throws his hands in the air, “Forget it, I know exactly why, and the nickname is still not cute nor humourous.”
“Well, if Thor hadn’t knocked out Schmidt, we wouldn’t have defeated Hydra before Spring. I reckon he gets a fair amount of credit.” Steven says.
“I could, very easily.” Steven closes his eyes, face torn with pain, “I have been capable of so much that is wrong.”
Much later, Anthony is sore and sated in a manner all too different from the sparring, laying on his stomach by Steven’s side. The Alpha is scrawling Anthony’s figure on an old map, long black chalk the only sound, scratching away in the backdrop of their tent.
Steven doesn’t respond, merely gathers him close, rocks him into his chest. Steven’s knot still remains, powerful, tethering Anthony in the most intimate manner.
He moves forward, and pukes onto her crotch. Her reaction is immediate. She shrieks, pulling back, too overwhelmed by disgust to hurt him, and he grabs the sword she’d put down to pull off her clothes. He swings it at her, clean and cutting. He has a moment where he recognises the arc is perfect, perfect for one aiming at --
Anthony tries to breathe. His head still hurts, but it’s dulling, slowly. The blow had been exact and calculated, but not detrimental. Natasha’s in his head again. Her hands moving over Clint’s body, pointing out pressure points, weak areas.
“I know.” Anthony smooths a hand over Steven’s hair, matted with sweat and grime. He’s scenting Steven, grounding him with his touch, and the Alpha is not so lost that he doesn’t know it. Still, he permits the touch with unsteady eyes.
“Alright, alright, come on.” Bucky drags him to the space outside Steven and Anthony’s tent. It’s an area generally avoided by the pack.
“I’m in love with you.” Tony whispers, leaning into Steve so that he ends up finishing the words against the boy’s collarbones. He feels more than hears Steve’s inhale.
There had been an evening, two weeks into their hunt for Anthony after he’d been taken, that Steven couldn’t quite recall how Anthony looked laughing. It had frightened him, strongly enough that he’d gone a little rabid. Eventually, he’d required Natasha to pet him for a while, omega pheromenes flooding his senses and settling him even as his bond pulsed in acute betrayal.
Steven clutches the omega’s neck, where Steve’s mating bond rests, gathering all of Anthony towards him. His eyes scour Anthony’s, looking for any pain there. He doesn’t know what he finds, can’t read Anthony’s gaze with the remnants of anger and adrenaline still pulsing in his veins. It agitates him, not knowing even with Anthony in his arms, whether the omega is okay.
“Thank you Bucky. You’re God’s gift to the world.” Steve says, “And Nat has the keys to maintenance so suck up your pride and ask her for help."
The castle is a wide, broad system, well-protected through separation. There are more walls sectioning off areas than you would find in a town. When Natasha, after weeks of slow, painstaking infiltration, finally got a full structural image of the castle, she’d come to the meeting tent laughing.
“That is not --” Anthony scowls, “How could it possibly be manipulation if you’re completely aware of what I’m supposedly doing?”
Anthony’s head falls forward. He can’t quite get his thoughts in order, feels an intense urge to be with Steven, even though he knows, rationally, that Bucky is right.
“Yeah.” Tony says, sitting down next to Steve. He pushes Steve’s knee up so that he can lean against it. Steve knocks his side with it but ultimately concedes his knee.
Steve can feel his lips move under Tony’s hands, but can’t recognise the shape of the sentences. The rhythm slips and Tony rises up a few more times before he’s coming. Steve’s hand cups Tony’s cock through it, feeling at the underskin as come spurts cleanly through and onto them. Tony blinks sweat from his eyes as he rises up and off Steve’s cock, falling onto the floor next to him.
Without quite meaning to, Tony ends up in Steve’s room after showering, snuggling under the comforter while Steve dries his hair.
“You don’t know anything about Steven.” Anthony shoots back. His hands pin Gregory’s to the ground, anger making him harsher.
“Want to share?” Steven offers, hand still poised over the map. Anthony takes in the figure on the map, the curve of his body sprawling, black over the grey lines of territories. His eyes are a bare outline, but the bow of his lips is defined, a salacious picture.
“Is it that obvious I’ve never done this before—whatever this is?” Tony wondered. “No wait, don’t answer that. Just. Tell me what I’m supposed to do here. Is it just paperwork? Because I really don’t really feel like filing things out in triplicate right now. In fact I think I’ve developed a very specific allergy to the type of paper that—”
Peter is midway through a complicated calculation that will help him determine just how much elasticity he can add to the latest batch of web-fluid without sacrificing tensile strength. So it takes several long seconds to realize that it isn’t the tunnel-vision he gets when he’s working. Sam just isn’t making sense.
“Maybe just, in my hair? Or on my neck?” Phil didn’t respond verbally, but he placed a hand around the back of Tony’s neck and steered his head to lean against Coulson’s denim-covered leg.
“I didn’t tell you this to ruin it, sweetheart. But come-downs from sub high can be really challenging; the higher you are, the further down there is back down to baseline. I didn’t want to compound that with confusion about what was actually happening.” Tony nodded miserably, hoping like hell that his pouting wasn’t as obvious as it felt. By the time he was standing, Clint and Rhodey were flanking him again.
The thing was, Tony could picture it so easily. Ever since he’d arrived in this universe and seen what Steve had done with the place, Tony had been so comfortable at SHIELD. He’d held himself back a hundred times from chipping in advice or suggestions because he hadn’t wanted to irritate or undermine Steve. And now, after Tony had all but lost it on the guy the other day, Steve was responding by offering him the keys to the kingdom. And fuck was it tempting.
The second Steve was just like that, so ruined deep beneath the surface that trying to even mark the space of the loss, let alone heal it, felt hopeless. He had barely started mourning the loss—the
Steve thought, too, of how completely that Tony had loved kids. He celebrated the successes of the children he visited in hospitals as if they were his own, and followed up with them for years after the fact. He could talk for hours about the work his kids did in the labs, all the ways they were going to save the world and put Tony out of business. In so many other ways Tony had been too ashamed or traumatized to love as openly and as deeply as he wanted, but being around children seemed to light up all of those dark places. Steve had wondered in his most optimistic moments if adoption might be on the table for them someday.
Once Tony started asking questions, he couldn’t seem to stop. Steve didn’t mind this, had never minded the other man’s boundless interest in the world, except for the fact that all of Tony’s food was sitting untouched on the table. When he pointed this out, Tony huffed and took a large bite from the half-eaten hotdog in Steve’s hand. It was just like he’d done with Pepper before the press conference—not quite hand feeding, but a casual, friendly sharing of food that demonstrated at least some degree of comfort and trust. Steve concentrated very, very hard on trying to appear equally as casual when all he wanted to do was shout in triumph.
His cock fucking dripped this time, and his hips shoved upward again. Not a coincidence, then. Tony pressed a second finger in alongside the first, shuddering and turning his head to muffle a moan into his pillow.
Tony’s brain stuttered for several intense seconds as he imagined himself at Phil’s feet, touching himself while trying to articulate a fantasy that Phil faithfully transcribed, seemingly unaffected by the show. His cock, already half-hard since he and Phil had made out, rose to full attention; Tony cursed himself for not at least putting on boxers after check-in. Several days of near-constant nudity had made getting dressed something he had to consciously remind himself to do, but there were occasional drawbacks. Phil didn’t hide the fact of his regard, either; his gaze wandered between Tony’s legs with the same casual possessiveness they all exhibited, but he didn’t linger there, either. As it so often did with the team, it seemed as if Coulson wasn’t any more interested in a sexual response than in any other. It was all information, knowledge about him that they sought out and coveted.
The graves of Howard and Maria Stark had once been truly massive, paid for jointly by SHIELD and the Department of Defense as monuments to not just the man and his wife, but all of the ideas about America and American-ness they had once embodied for so many. Howard’s had been defaced within hours of Tony’s announcement; they’d called him in Malibu, wanting to know if he wanted to hire private security, or have the markers taken down altogether, or moved to a private location. Tony had told them to leave it alone, and now he could read weeks of anger and disappointment and hurt and rage in every scrawled message and crack on the stone that marked Howard Stark’s resting place. Maria’s stone had emerged relatively unscathed, with the exception of a few errant drops of spray paint and a single handwritten note propped up against it that read
And then Tony had died, and he and Sam…well, it had all kind of fallen apart. Sam had been the first to pull away, triggered by witnessing Steve’s loss of his partner after enduring the death of his own Dominant. He’d come back, though, had even flown out to New York to drag Steve out of the Tower for walks and meals. And then the press had gotten wind of his presence, along with a few images of them walking ‘too closely to be friendly.’ (As Steve recalled, that was mainly because he had barely been eating or sleeping at that point and Sam had been genuinely frightened he would keel over on the street, but no one seemed interested in the truth.)
“Go get a kneeling pillow from the basket by the fireplace.” Tony’s brain stuttered, and he took a reflexive step back towards the elevator, but Rhodey wasn’t having it. He gave Tony a gentle push towards the living room and pointed to the basket. “Not joking, Tones. The submission ain’t an option, not anymore, and I know that you’re not getting any real peace out of spending time with your Dominants when you're keeping this from them. So until you’re prepared to tell them I’m gonna need to take you in hand a little bit.”
The others were quiet too. Bruce refreshed the snacks and turned on a movie just for some noise, but no one was really watching it. Phil and Bucky were both settled on a kneeling pillow at Steve’s feet. It was bigger than Tony’s…than the purple one, and clearly intended for multiple people. Thor, wearing the wrist cuffs Tony recognized from days earlier, had an arm around Clint, who was idly toying with strands of Thor’s long blonde hair. Natasha was somewhere near the elevator, meeting someone Tony assumed was delivering take-out.
The point was, Peter liked the hell out of Sam Wilson. And still the sight of him tossing the shield like a frisbee, cackling with glee as he caught Barnes on the ass, made Peter unfathomably angry. Steve had promised. He’d sworn he would help Peter, that he would pick up the superhero mentorship where Tony had left off. And here was, apparently preparing to hand off the Captain America mantle to someone else?
Still, they were all sincere in their efforts to repair their relationships with her, and she them, which made her unannounced visit to the Tower on a Thursday night (an evening she knew Tony usually spent alone) all the stranger. The real shock, though, was when the elevator doors opened and a metal suit, fashioned in the style of Iron Man but coloured in hues of blue and gold, proceeded her out of the elevator like a large metal bodyguard.
For someone who had now been living in the future for nearly a decade, there was a depressingly small amount of clothing inside. A small supply of plaid button-ups sat next to a couple more fitted items Peter had never seen Steve actually wear. There were close to a dozen of the ill-fitting pants Steve insisted on referring to as ‘slacks,’ alongside a couple pairs of jeans. One still had a price tag on them. Everything else was designed for workouts (which, who even hung that kind of stuff up?)
“I got that doll. You don’t gotta clean up my mess.” Barnes was emptying the dustbin into the trash before he spoke again. “I ain’t gonna apologize for them. It might make me feel better, but it won’t really help you any; just because he was wearing my face don’t make me him. And I’ve done enough in my own universe I gotta atone for. I’m sorry that happened, though. You deserved better, from both of ‘em.”
The thing is, it hurt because Steve was starting to agree with him. Not that Bruce couldn’t handle this; Steve had been entirely sincere in his confidence that he and Natasha would take Tony through the scene capably. But he wasn’t sure how much longer he could stand being on the outside, watching as the team lead Tony into submission and all that it had to offer. Steve wanted to be there, even for the parts like this that were hard, that hurt.
“Shit,” Clint muttered, leaping up and then halting mid-motion to peer thoughtfully down at the two people on the floor near his feet. “Natasha? Bucky? Take a minute and check in with yourselves. Where you at?” Bucky’s easy lassitude was already almost entirely gone, and he followed Clint to his feet. Natasha hung her head and took several long, deep breaths before following. Tony was astonished to see unshed tears shining in her eyes when she looked at Clint, but when she spoke her voice was steady and even.
“Tony, no!” came a chorus of shouts from at least three of the room’s current inhabitants. He cackled, unable to help himself.
He watches as Bucky and Sam exchange looks, clearly trying to decide how far to push. Steve doesn’t wait for the outcome of that silent conversation. He edges his way out of the kitchen, ignoring the eyes he can feel on his back as he resists the urge to let his long strides turn into an outright jog. His room is messier than…maybe Steve’s bedroom has ever been in his life. Like many of her generation, Steve’s mother had been a stickler for cleanliness, and then shortly after that had come the army. His bedroom has never been anything but a place to lay his head. Now, however, it bears the signs of his near-constant presence over the past several days. Several half-full cups of water jockey for space on the nightstand. Steve’s clean laundry, rather than being put away, sits in a pile by the door where the cleaning staff dropped it off. Several books Tony had recommended, which Steve had immediately ordered, sit in a cardboard box on the floor. He pushes them out of his way with a foot as he climbs into his bed.
“Yeah, Edwin Jarvis and his wife Anna, they pretty much raised me. Seemed fitting when I was basically trying to build myself a new parent after mine died. Look, Steve, I’ll go into more detail about any of this that you want, but can you please first tell me what happened to the kid?”
“I mean, sort of—though if I can give you one piece of advice, it would definitely be to avoid ever calling Nat a himbo to her face. Or behind her back. Really, though, we need this many levels because SHIELD people are so specialized. Think about Clint. He’d destroy a standard archery range, so he has his own. But there are other people around here who are proficient with a bow and arrow, just not at his level. So they require another range altogether. It’s like that for a lot of the weapons around here, and that’s before we’re even talking about enhanced people. Steve had the skeleton already built, of course, but fleshing it out has been a process. I would say we still only have about half the training facilities we’ll eventually need.”
Thor paced the jet like a caged animal. He always took it hardest when one of the team got hurt, doubly so when it was Clint and Thor was the only one around with flying capabilities who might have caught him. Steve wanted to give him comfort; he should, at least, have reminded Thor that Clint had known the platform to be unstable long before he’d stepped on it, that he’d known Thor was not in a position to be able to reach him in time. He said nothing. Bruce would talk him down when he was himself again, or Natasha could pull double-duty.
“Let’s plan on a full day of non-sexual play involving you as soon as you get back, then?” Steve proposed. “You sketch it out in as much detail as you usually do ahead of time, and send us your notes.” Rhodey agreed readily, and even leaned in to give Steve a brief hug and a back thump on his way out the door. They were getting there, Steve thought hopefully.
This is a fascinating question, and one that Barnes himself is very much still attempting to work out. In lieu of a definitive answer, I can offer instead a brief view into one of his more recent conversations with his therapist.
Content Notes: Tony's recapping of his scene with Bucky includes some sexual content. If you are sex-repulsed or just want to give that a miss, skip the second section in italics, as well as the first regular-font paragraph afterward (in which Tony also mentions some of the other things the team got up to during the period we skimmed over.)
An alert flashed at the top of the screen, and Coulson’s smile vanished into a more familiar, business-like expression as he clicked it and scanned the small text-box that emerged:
So instead of doing anything useful, Peter snooped. Because he might be older and more jaded than when he’d first imagined living amongst superheroes, but that didn’t mean he was entirely unaffected by suddenly bunking with the likes of people he’d dressed up as when he was a kid. That wasn’t to say all the rooms were interesting. It was clear that some of them, like the Winter Soldier’s, hadn’t been used at all since the compound had been rebuilt. Others, like Colonel Rhodes and Falcon’s, were so compulsively neat that even though Peter knew both men had been around, he would have had to be way more willing to really violate their privacy to learn anything of value. Dr. Banner’s room, recognizable from several feet away by the widened doorway he’d clearly installed to accommodate his shared Hulk/Bruce frame, was littered with a few interesting looking scientific journals, and it smelled faintly like a spicy kind of tea. Next to him was The Scarlet Witch. Peter almost didn’t venture inside. No one had seen Wanda since the service for Tony. He’d heard snippets of enough conversations to know that several members of the team were looking, and others (particularly Clint) seemed to feel that if Wanda wished to grieve her loss privately, that was her right.
Thanks for being patient with the brief disruption in my posting schedule. I try really hard to keep things regular, but the last few weeks have just been an extra level of bananas, as those of you who follow me on Tumblr have seen me rant about at length. Thanks for sticking with me, and for your wonderful comments, kudos, and #AskStrange questions!
The last section, meanwhile, contains a bit of a cliffhanger. This is, it feels like a good time to remind everyone, a guaranteed happy-ending kind of a story, but if you're trying to avoid things that might produce even minor anxiety at a hard time, might be best to give the last bit a miss until I can post the next chapter and you can read them together.
“Yeah. You go, give him the whole ‘Captain America is proud of you son, now come under the well-funded and regulated wing of SHIELD and also eat a sandwich or twelve’ speech. I can design his tech without him ever knowing, stay five degrees removed from anything he so much as breathes on. It’s brilliant.”
“To some extent, yes, but our scenes have been fuelled by a mix of need and our own interests, given your inexperience in these areas and the various time and health constraints we’ve faced to this point. Now seems like an opportune moment to expose you to a wider range of possibilities. Your needs and desires do not have to be, and really shouldn’t be, always filtered through our own.” Tony frowned, and Steve noted the way he pressed closer to the nearest body (Natasha’s).
An interesting question. Their particular relationship certainly pushes at the boundaries of what is considered acceptable or even legal in this particular universe.
Steve had been reading for almost eight hours straight, which was enough to make even his serum-enhanced head hurt. T’Challa had finally forwarded the rest of their ample documentation about Wakanda’s cross-training and workplace orientation programs, and it was…well, Steve had barely made the slightest dent in those eight hours. He had no idea which way was up anymore, no sense of whether he was doing the right thing, or whether he risked tearing apart SHIELD and destroying its excellent global standing for the sake of a pipe dream.
“I could keep you here like this forever,” Natasha informed him, leaning forward to run her nails up his chest. “In my bed, ready and willing and so sweetly eager to take whatever I wish to give you.” Tony’s dick pulsed in reply, but an edge of something sharper and far less pleasant nudged at the edge of his consciousness. (Would she really want to keep him like this, so needy he couldn’t see straight? Would she ever allow him to come? Or had he somehow made her so angry that she would want him to stay on the edge like this, desperate and broken?)
late!” he added, unable to stop himself. He rolled his eyes and tried to ignore it the best he could while the team cackled about his complete inability to turn off his Dominant instincts.
“I guess I really should have known,” she mused as she held him close. She had planted her hand unerringly at the back of his neck, nails digging directly over where a collar would rest if Tony were that kind of sub. “You were just too pretty on your knees to be a switch, weren’t you darling?”
“Anything,” Steve echoed back, a promise and a prayer and an apology. Then he moved to wrap his hand around Thor’s cock—not stroking or squeezing, just a possessive, solid hold. Thor's body jackknifed as much as it could within its bindings, and for just a second Steve swore he saw bursts of lightning at the other man’s fingertips. At this rate, it was basically a guarantee that Thor wouldn’t last long, but Steve didn’t move his hand away or try to slow things back down. (They had time.)
He, Peter, had done that. He’d made Ned look like someone seeing the sun for the first time after years spent in darkness. For several short but intense seconds, Peter was combing through every recess in his mind in search of other ways to make Ned smile that way, to keep him
Steve stepped off the elevator and into the penthouse level and found himself alone with Natasha and Tony. They were both dressed to the nines and quite obviously just returned from a date; as they stood in the kitchen and debated the merits of dessert-wine versus tea, Natasha kept finding excuses to brush up against Tony, an arm here, a hip there. The little efforts at flirtation appeared mostly one-sided, at least until Tony leaned down to whisper something into Natasha’s ear, a slight growl to his voice that Steve recognized well.
“Yessir,” Tony rushed to agree. When Bruce groaned in reply, he felt the vibrations all the way through him.
“I don’t know,” Steve shrugged. “No, this isn’t…it’s not me being science-simple, Tony, we just don’t measure levels all that often once someone has settled into their orientation. Not unless there’s a problem with dep or someone is in unexplained distress or something like that.” Tony still seemed disconcerted by this, frowning and staring at the ceiling in thought. “Wait, Bruce measured the team’s levels once we all moved in together. He wanted a sense of how our dynamic was impacting everyone, and whether or not our various enhancements had any impact on the biological aspects of orientation. I bet he’d send them to you.”
I'm so appreciating your thoughts and comments and questions on this verse. Long stories are my favourites to write (as many of you know!), but they do come with their own challenges, and one of them can be staying consistently motivated and excited. Hearing from you all ensures that's pretty much never a problem with this verse!
Other than a brief blip that turned out to have been caused by Peter himself attempting to dislodge one of the many monitors he was wearing, all the readings remained stable for the next several hours. Tony could feel exhaustion’s grip on his consciousness slowly strengthening: his limbs were heavy, his brain was sluggish, even simple bodily functions like blinking felt like they required an extraordinary amount of effort. At this point it was nothing but the emotional equivalent of muscle memory (was that a thing? Whatever, Tony was making it a thing) keeping him awake, replaying the memory of losing his own Peter overlaid with the screeching sound the monitors had made two nights ago when the medical team had been fighting to keep this version of the kid stable.
“It…from everything I saw, it sounds like it was fast. Maybe even painless. I’ve seen Wanda’s magic up close—”
“Rhodes said, and everything we’ve learned seems to confirm, that other than orientation, everything with the team seems to have been pretty much the same in his universe up to and including the Battle of New York,” she recited. Coulson nodded.
“I was hired on a nine month contract, Steve. This is standard for grief counselling, and it is something we discussed in our first meeting. I’m not entirely surprised you don’t remember, you were quite occupied with trying to pretend you weren't falling apart at the seams.”
As always, your kudos and comments continue to make this verse a joy and a delight to write. Please keep them coming! And remember to let the Doctor know if you have questions #AskStrange
Morning brought with it a migraine and a deep feeling of frustration. One of the aspects of moving to a compound in the middle of nowhere that Peter had actually looked forward to was the absence of city noise. While horns and bright lights were the charming soundtrack to New York life, spider-senses turned that background noise into an overwhelming cacophony. He didn’t just hear it when the neighbours fought or cooked. Or had sex--that was so visceral he practically ffelt it. On a clear night he could hear the grocery list someone was making on the phone with their partner almost a block away. It had been weeks after the bite before he’d learned to tune some of it out, and months after that before he’d managed a halfway decent sleep.
After a long, confusing morning, Tony has decided that even if their methods were a bit…odd, he knew what the team was doing. They wanted him to stay, maybe for good reasons, maybe for shitty ones. It was simply too early to tell. But right now they were trying to get him to forge connections to this universe, to care about this version of the team, about Rhodey and his
“There’s a couple trends here, and while I didn’t think they were related at first, I’m starting to believe otherwise. The first is that you’re increasingly seeking out correction in the form of punishment. Since I know punishment is something you have mixed feelings about—”
“My Clint was married.” It took only those four words. Four words to turn the other man from lax and carefully avoidant of Tony’s gaze to dangerously intent. It was like watching him go from Clint, the goofball who watched kid’s television and mocked the rest of his teammates on social media, to Agent Barton in a matter of seconds. (Tony had rarely seen his own version as anything but that latter, but the distinction between them in this universe was sharp and definite.) “I didn’t know, no one but Natasha did until we had nowhere else to go but his secret little farm with his sweet wife and his three kids.” Clint mouthed the word ‘kids’ soundlessly, while signing something Tony assumed meant the same thing. He felt almost guilty pressing rather than giving Clint a moment to digest what he’d heard, but if Tony didn’t get this out now then he might never. “If this is going to work between you and I, I need to not start out knowing you’re hiding an important part of yourself from me.”
“I know, I know, it’s just—I’ve never done one of these and meant it before. Even after we switched over from weapons there had to be so much compromising in order to pacify the old guard that had been there under Howard. Now they’re gone and we can just say what we actually mean.”
“Mr. Parker, as I have told you several times, the donation was anonymous. But there has not been a mistake; your bill for this visit, as well as all outstanding fees from previous trips to the emergency room, have been paid in full.” Peter’s nurse, a tall blonde man who stood with his hands on his hips, sounded exasperated. This was somewhat unsurprising given the fact that their current conversation was clearly a repeat. What was rather more alarming was Peter. Tony had been prepared for the heavy cast that went all the way up to his mid-thigh, and for the bruising on his face that hadn’t yet been taken care of by the kid’s healing factor. But he hadn’t been ready for a version of Peter that was so angry and tired. There were lines on his face that would have been more fitting of a man in his thirties, and he spoke with none of the over-politeness that had always been so wonderfully out of place on a teenager.
the atom. Broken would mean it was whole and then someone destroyed its structure; the atom was always made up of smaller elements than Dalton thought. He just lacked the technology to be able to visualize it at that level. So no one knew until they split it apart and could see what else was inside—kind of like smashing, actually.” Tony could have gleefully lectured about the development of atomic science all day, but even he had some level of self preservation instincts, and the Hulk had been still, entirely still, since Tony had made his presence known. He’d stepped too far into the room to be able to make it to the door, but if these labs featured the same security measures as those in Tony’s world, there should be a few Hulk-containment methods in here that could be voice activated...
“Uh, so. This is a permanent, natural magnet. Which means to reverse the polarity, we have to hear it to Curie’s point and then let it cool.”
“I was hoping all of this could be more like a trade. The way it was with you and Rhodey last night.” Unconsciously at first, Tony started matching his breaths in time with Bruce’s deep, even inhalations and exhalations. It was as close as he’d ever come, in his own world, to agreeing to practice meditation with the guy, and almost against his will he felt his shoulders shift down slightly from near his ears. (Sneaky bastard.) And this Bruce knew what he was doing just as well as his counterpart had; he and Tony exchanged grins, and then Bruce made a show of taking another long, deep breath. “I know there’s information you have to have, whether you want it or not, about our Tony. But we don’t…it’s like Phil said. No one’s trying to groom you. No one wants to make you him, especially at the cost of losing everything that makes you, you. I had the privilege of knowing one version of Tony Stark, and I would very much like to get to know you too, in whatever ways you feel like you can let me right now.”
Eventually, Steve added the salt Bruce had suggested to the water. That turned it silky and a little bit slippery, and Steve held Tony carefully as he adjusted their positions so that they were facing one another. The cloth he pressed to Tony’s skin was ridiculously soft too, better than the stuff he’d encountered at some of the world’s best spas. Steve’s care and regard were evident in everything he did, and even though Tony knew from the other side how irrational drop could be, he truly couldn’t fathom any force on Earth convincing Steve that his Dominance was anything but flawless.
“There we go now, see, it isn’t so hard, is it?” Clint was almost cooing in his ear, and it made Tony want to hit him and beg him in about equal measures. “You just need it so bad that beautiful brain of yours can’t quite keep up, can it? We’ll have to keep him better supplied in the future, Bruce. Poor thing can’t be expected to go so long without.”
Bruce’s touch never lost its steadiness. He got frustrated sometimes, just like all of them seemed to when Tony revealed things about his past. But here at Daily Check Ins Bruce was completely unshakeable. And while Tony loved the team’s protectiveness, the openness with which they wore their affection and empathy, he’d also quickly come to value that slight distance Bruce could convey in moments like this. (It made sharing the harder stuff easier sometimes, to pretend that it was something that only impacted Tony himself.) The only reaction Bruce gave now was to flatten his hands against Tony’s flank, so that he could feel the heavy press of Bruce's palms and the full length of this fingers.
“I’m not a spy. I never have been. Seriously, ask Clint, he knows the Doctor Potts story. I’m a disaster.”
Tony's new schedule meant that he also attended about half of the Avenger’s training sessions. They weren’t all as entertaining and involved as the first, and the entire team wasn’t always able to attend. The most recent session had been comprised solely of a wrestling match between Thor and Bucky. (Which wasn’t to say it hadn’t been a damn delight to watch; Thor obviously had the edge in the strength department, but Barnes was almost endlessly patient, and sneaky as hell.) After every one, Coulson asked for Tony’s impressions, and he always seemed to actually listen to the answers.
“He did regret it, you know,” Strange said, startling Tony out of an internal rant which might very well have turned epic had it been permitted. “You two might not have cared much for one another but he did seek out all other opportunities before making the decisions that would lead you all in that particular direction. There were none.”
Wakanda’s workplace orientation and cross-training models have vocal and well-funded critics, but are they the way forward in a world where most of the population is simply not getting what they need?
Tony had about a dozen arguments. Midnight was laughably early, for one, and he hated the fuzzy way that sleep medication made his brain work when he woke up the next day. And exercise? Tony’s brief affair with running had, he was quite certain, directly helped bring about the end of the world in his own universe. Mostly, though, what he felt was sheer relief in Rhodey’s steadfast, no-nonsense attitude and his structured outline of the days to come. His life wouldn’t look the way it used to, it couldn’t if Tony was really going to work this all out, but he wouldn’t face the days alone and unmoored, either.
He ignored Bruce’s greeting entirely and began to strip off, tossing the clothes into a pile on the floor next to a neatly bundled set of wires. Midway through clambering onto the exam table, Tony realized with equal parts surprise and annoyance that the awkwardness he usually felt about being naked in front of a fully-dressed Bruce was absent today, replaced by something that felt dangerously close to relief. (Coincidence and the power of suggestion. Had to be.)
“S’just…it’s like, my head’s a machine that needed maintenance for so long that I didn’t even notice how much gunk had built up in the systems, slowing down all the processes, bugging up all the programs, because it was so gradual, right? But now it’s all gone, it’s clear and everything is running at peak efficiency, and it’s so good Bruce, so fucking good to be fixed.”
“As anyone who ever worked with me here knows, I’m not exactly the type to sit quietly and do as I’m told.” A chorus of appreciative laughter greeted this entirely accurate assessment, Steve’s among them. Talia’s smile when her eyes found him at the back of the room was wide and open. “The point is not to stop a submissive from asking questions, or pointing out flaws in how something is being done. If there is something about the system they don’t trust and aren't comfortable with, that’s on you, on all of us, to fix. But there’s a difference between that and seeking attention or correction. As a Dominant, one of the most crucial judgements you’ll have to make is which one is happening at any given moment.”
Tony’s knees twinged for the fourth time in the last hour, and he groaned in frustration, bending down to try to rub some of the soreness out and vowing that he would take some time off from experimenting with this whole submissive kneeling thing. The others made it look so easy, staying in the same position for hours at a time. But however else Tony might be considering adapting to the orientational dynamics here (maybe, possibly), the pain was an important reminder that the distinctions between he and the people in this universe still occasionally had a very material impact on what submission could look like.
Steve gave the question the consideration he knew it deserved. He had spent months agonizing over everything to do with Tony. When greetings in the hallway went sideways, he obsessed for hours. On days when he let himself flirt too heavily at SHIELD, it kept Steve awake at night. Yet now, while every plan Steve had ever made regarding Tony lay in ruins at his feet, all he felt was a totalizing sense of calm. He’d made his decision last night when he’d taken Tony into his arms. There was no turning back, not without utterly destroying the other man’s trust. Plus there was the small matter of Steve not wanting to turn back.
“But I’ll go make more,” Bruce continued, smiling as Thor rose to join him. (The demi-god claimed he wanted to help, though Steve was pretty sure he also intended to scope the place out for additional snacks.)
this woman think—what, that Steve wasn’t aware of everything that had lost that day? She could never even comprehend the pain of it, the crushing ache that followed Steve around every second—“I do not mean that you have not mourned. There
If you have any questions or concerns about this or any other aspect of the chapter/story, feel free to let me know as always.
For all that Tony’s parting instructions had been forbidding to the extreme, Peter spent most of the next two or so hours playing games on his phone and tossing a ball to Butterfingers. The biggest danger he faced was the increasing discomfort of being in the suit for so long. By the time JARVIS announced Tony’s imminent arrival, Peter had sweat through the t-shirt he had on under the suit. He’d definitely need to stop at home before the party tonight.
“Oh sweetheart. That was so good to do to you, you were magnificent, Tony, just incredible.” There was motion around them as Phil crooned reassurances, but Tony didn’t care about any of it, could only curl himself in a ball and press himself into Phil’s arms, shaking and crying. “Shh shh shh, sweet boy, that was a lot, I know it was.”
Ah, a sensible question about things that matter like how to sort and categorize things. Excellent. Let’s get to it.
For the span of several harsh breaths, Steve just watched. This Tony was just as much in his element here as their Tony had been. His movements were graceful and precise, somehow made moreso by the juxtaposition of that smoothness with the ear-splitting music that served as background to the scene. A line of sweat running down the back of Tony’s neck revealed the effort this heavy labour was costing him, but as always Tony wholeheartedly welcomed the effort, never stopping even when certain motions caused him to wince or inhale sharply (what exactly had Bruce found when he’d checked him over, anyway?) And Dummy, who had refused outright to be in the shop after…Dummy was right alongside him, chirping gleefully and fetching anything Tony so much as glanced at.
“He told me he was terrified. That a threat greater than we’d ever faced was imminent, that New York hadn’t been an accident or a one-off. He told me he’d watched me, all of us, die after I told him he could have done more.” Maybe Steve shouldn't have said what he did next; the answer was already evident in the heavy weight of Tony’s silence. But he asked anyway, because he had to know this wasn’t another in a series of horrible misunderstandings. “Did you tell your Steve those things, Tony? Did he ask?” Tony snorted; a ruffling noise followed by a warning from JARVIS seemed to indicate he had gotten, rather unsteadily, to his feet.
Phil released, and pressed down again. On the third time, Tony came, and then promptly burst into tears. Loud, noisy, uncontrollable tears that came out of nowhere. His arms flailed, grabbing for Phil and Thor who quickly moved to bracket him on either side while Clint pressed himself right up against Tony’s back.
“No, you’re not.” Sam’s voice was kind and even as it always was, and right now Steve sort of hated him for the fact that he could sound this way when the fragile seams keeping Steve’s world together were suddenly unravelling. “All the more reason to ask for help, yeah? Look, man, caring for a teenager is hard at the best of times, and this particular teenager has been through a hell of a lot. I know that the two of you seem to have bonded in the wake of Tony’s death, and it’s great that you’re steppin’ up, but that doesn’t mean you gotta be his only source of support.”
but had been professionally tailored from the looks of it, draping Steve’s perfectly-proportioned body just so—had Tony immediately on edge. He himself hadn’t done more than shower and touch up the lines of his goatee, because he was supposed to have hours yet, and how Steve was just standing here all perfect and calm and put together. In one hand he held a bouquet of riotously colourful flowers that were about as far from the kinds of professionally displayed collections men like Tony usually received (he loved them fiercely and instantly); in the other, he held a bottle of ketchup. The only upside was that that last part was so bizarre that it temporarily brought the rest of Tony's panicked thought processes to a screeching halt.
It was a gloriously productive morning, knee pain aside, and he worked until his music stopped and JARVIS’s smooth tones declared,
The boxes she dragged into the living room were far too big to be take out. The first was probably 30 inches tall and another 18 long and wide, and she deposited that one at Tony’s feet with a triumphant grin. He tore the tape off to find several large stacks of clothes. (Oh, right. Had it really been just a few days ago that he’d taken their suggestions to order some of his own stuff, so he could stop living out of Mark II’s wardrobe? He could also could have sworn he selected a delivery date after the press conference as an added precaution, but perhaps the timing was what Nat looked so smug about.)
“He didn’t finish his coffee.” It was such a stupid way to start telling the story of his lover’s death that Steve wanted to seize the words back from the silence they had erupted into. Dr. Domen, however, was sitting forward in her seat and, for the first time, had put down her tablet. “He…Tony hated call-outs that came before he finished his first cup of coffee. The cleaning staff all had standing orders not to touch his mug until he got back, and it didn’t matter if the damn thing was ice cold by the time we finished what we’d been doing. The first thing he’d always do when we got back to the Tower was finish that cup of coffee.”
“The hell does it matter to you?” Peter demanded, hissing as he pressed his hand deeper into the ice. “It’s not like you’ll be around to have to pick up the pieces. Not like you ever are.”
“I don’t get it,” he interrupted a question about his latest journalling exercise rudely. “I…sorry, Dr. Domen, but I just…I’m where we were trying to get me. I’m not sure I really need to continue therapy, especially at this kind of pace. Things with my partners are better, and things with Tony look like they’re moving in a great direction. I’m not sure what else there really is to say.”
“Clint I got drunk and bitched about our alternative universe selves last night.” He expected annoyance, amusement, maybe even anger. What Phil did not anticipate was what Steve actually said.
When Steve started to chuckle, Tony halted mid-rant to stare at him, his mouth falling open in wordless indignation, and his already huge brown eyes widening past what seemed like it should be physiologically possible. The cartoonish expression brought Steve to full-on cackles that he could barely manage to breathe in between. Tony just watched him until he could finally manage to stop the spasms of laughter from rocking his whole body.
“Tony has asked to spend at least part of the day gagged,” she explained, as if there was nothing remarkable or even particularly noteworthy about that request. “He is exhausted in every possible way, and he has asked me to provide him with the opportunity to be silent. We both realize there is a lot to discuss, but as we have the luxury of spending a significant amount of time together in the coming weeks, there is no reason to rush those conversations. If you don’t think you’ll be able to stop yourself from pressing him for information today, then I’m going to ask one time and one time only that you excuse yourself.” No one moved or spoke, and after making eye-contact with each of them, Natasha seemed satisfied that her instructions wouldn’t be ignored. She turned her attention back to Tony. “Do you want to be naked or clothed?”
Because Tony’s mind and body were contradictory right down to the cellular level, being given permission
Stark then, of course, faced starvation during his misadventures in space. The result of these two conflicting patterns of disordered eating is an ongoing tension within Stark. Some times he becomes desperate for food, fearful on an unconscious level that it may disappear again. Otherwise, he still usually prefers to pick at food throughout the day; Dr. Banner has already picked up on the latter, but is unaware of the cause.
“Alright, so JARVIS has registered his vote. Now, Dummy, I was impressed by your style, but I gotta take off some points for the fact that you tried to Fury Road it. And Butterfingers, you know that if you break your brother, You is just gonna make you do all the extra work, right?” You, the only one not to receive a reprimand, chirped hopefully. “See, but you went and tried to tattle, and that’s just not cool either, buddy. I think I gotta give this one to Dummy. Barnes, you’re the tiebreaker.” Barnes surveyed the bots with a furrowed brow, even had JARVIS replay the footage like it was fuckin’ Sports Centre, which…yeah, he was definitely getting into the spirit of the thing, Tony could give him that.
“Normally, when Steve was actually taking a damn minute for himself I would be thrilled to let him. Hell, I’d shoot anyone threatening to interfere. But I’ve just confirmed that he’s not actually practicing healthy coping mechanisms. He’s avoiding you, and you’re avoiding him, and while the same morbid part of me that watches and enjoys certain reality shows sort of wants to know which of you would finally give first, I only have so much time. Bucky and I are supposed to be outta here in a couple days.”
“Oh my god he was dropping. He came to see me today, and his behaviour was…odd. He was seeking out both touch and approval, and he kept shivering like he just couldn’t warm up. I didn’t think a lot of it at the time, to be honest, because we don’t know him well enough to have a sense of how abnormal some of that is. And he calmed down after a bit. After we…”
“No, I think you did.” Howard responds, though his expression doesn’t change, “But despite your relationship with my son, and your role in this team, I don’t have to justify my choices to you.”
When he reaches the infirmary, he presses three fingers onto the touchscreen, hard enough that his hand shoots back in a reflex of worry, eyeing the glass for cracks. It holds, and he waits as the computer confirms and re-confirms his identity. His fingers have left prints on the glass, and he rubs them out in frustration as the computer lets him in.
“I know, okay, darling, I know. Director Carter called me up. I know what happened. It’s going to be okay. Tony’s going to be just fine.” His mom says.
“I am much nicer to you than you deserve, most of the time.” Bucky replies, dryly. “And if you’re capable of insulting me, you’re not too far gone.”
Tony had been laying on a bed of flowers. He had seemed like a Persephone devotee, with how the brilliant colours had bloomed all around him, “Why?”
Tony leans in and kisses him, a soft exchange. Steve smiles and pushes Tony’s hair back. He leans in for another kiss when Tony scrunches up his nose.
“You came through okay?” Steve raises his hand to Tony’s cheek, rubs at the skin there, somehow soft and clean even after battle. It’s as impossible as the rest of him. Steve’s hand leaves dark smudges, blood and dirt on Tony.
“And in the sharing of blood, I am become yours.” Steven says. He speaks softly, an oath kept for their ears. His hands come to Anthony’s cheeks, stroking below where Anthony can feel the blood drying, slightly itchy.
“What?” Steve asks, glancing helplessly for a moment before taking out his phone. The screen opens up, and he sees a notification for texts sent from Bucky.
“Oh, thanks! Great tip! Would literally rather go up to Carter and tell her I did this myself.” Bucky snarks back.
“Oh.” Steven breathes out, eyes darkening, a sweet desire in them as he drags Anthony closer. His mouth meets Anthony’s carefully, not wanting to smear the wet paint.
Steve turns to see Tony writing out a text on the notepad, right hand scribbling even as his left stays clasped with Steve’s. He thinks of this morning, frozen on the rocks, hearing Tony’s broken voice on the comms.
“Bucky, where is he?” Tony repeats, arms crossing. He feels the gauntlet unravel from his arm and sink into his skin, the click of a key turning.
Their army has broken off into packs, protecting each other’s backs, taking on sections of Hydra soldiers. Black litters the ground. Iron stays moving.
She whips a dagger at Anthony, the motion so quick that Anthony tumbles back to avoid its trajectory. It was a warning throw, Anthony realises, as the Alpha advances, the glittering mask of hers showing his own reaction in the reflection, scared and useless on his ass.The sight spurs him into action, and he advances, cuts her shoulder, flits back. It’s not a deep cut, nor is it disarming, but it irritates her.
“Fuck off, Bucky, no one asked you to stay.” Anthony says, pushing Steven off when he tries to press kisses against Anthony’s neck.
Gregory also doesn’t seem surprised, neatly leans back with an empty grin at their arrival. His eyes when they skate over Steven and Bucky, are that of a vulture’s, catching sight of a carcass.
“Mmm, hurts.” Tony’s head goes back on Steve’s shoulder. Steve exchanges a look with Bucky and Natasha, and they all come to a quiet agreement.
Steven cups Anthony’s hands in his, noting the roughness of his skin against the clean olive tones of Anthony’s fingers.
“And I will be there if he needs to fuck it out.” Anthony adds, and Bucky snorts before wincing at the gesture, hand moving to his face, where blood is drying.
“Not like this, I can’t --” Steve draws away, and Tony follows him, shushing at the pained choking noise Steve lets out. He wraps his arms around Steve. Ever since the serum, hugging Steve’s been like holding a giant bear, his back an expanse that feels impossibly wide. But in this moment, with Steve hunkered and withdrawn, it feels almost like before, with the phantom ache of protruding shoulders and skinny limbs pulsing under Tony’s fingers.
Anthony stumbles back, sword still clenched as she gargles, abrupt and lurching. She falls to her knees, and her eyes, through the mask, are surprised more than anything else.
“Fucking Wakandans.” Gregory swears, pushing up with a burst of energy. His hands fumble at Anthony’s visor, but he’s clumsy, and Anthony pushes him back.
A hand clamps over his mouth, and he’s pulled into a body. Anthony freezes and begins to struggle, battle instincts worn to a frayed age.
It is utterly bizarre to find himself on level ground with them, with him – Steven, his Alpha and a man who believes Anthony his equal when all evidence points to the contrary.
Once freed, Anthony crawls to the corner and bangs at a little device. Natasha hands him the end of her dagger, and he takes it gratefully, pushing it into the latch of the machine. The invisible barrier between them shimmers, flickers of colour appearing and disappearing before the barrier melts away entirely. Steven leaps and rushes to Anthony, who rises to meet him.
“I don’t know.” Anthony draws out, breaking into a laugh at the end. Steven joins him, and it feels light, for a moment, in him.
He hears Anthony walk up to him. He’s been taught how to walk like a hunter by Natasha, but he’s unused to it, slips up when he feels safe.
Tony obliges, thighs shuffling forward as he adjusts himself before reaching down to kiss Steve, nipping at his lips teasingly, mouth dancing away when Steve’s hands try to hold him in place. It’s incredibly frustrating, but it works, and Steve feels close, so close, his head lurching up to catch Tony’s lips, wanting him so desperately. Tony meets him, for just a moment, the soft plush of his bottom lip, before he shoves his fingers into Steve’s mouth.
“I wanted to tell you, but I didn’t know what to say. He’s my brother, but what do I know of him? And what could I offer you? The more I thought about it, the more confused I got.” Anthony smiles, a remorseful creature, “But you’re right. I should have told you the moment I realised. I’m sorry.”
He fucks him again, repeating Anthony’s song to him, and they laugh through it the whole time, breaking off into moans when laughing pulls at their groins or makes Anthony tighten around Steven. They come quickly and messily, grinning. Steven’s knot lasts for an hour, and they lay close enough that the boundary between their bodies seem to blur.
Anthony doesn’t know how it is he gets back up, lower body stiffened with a bizarre sting, body sore and raw. But he finds himself, wavering, on his feet. His eyes sting, the raw taste of puke still lingering in his throat.
Steve groans but takes his hands back, latching them onto Tony’s ass instead, digging into the thick flesh there. Tony moans in response, and falls over Steve, mouth licking up his chest and across the line of his pecs. It’s an argument, as holy as any conversation between them can get, and Steve laughs, a panting breath of a sound. Tony grins down at him, and Steve knows without asking, that he gets it.
Anthony’s hands feel trapped, sweat sticking his fingers to his leather gloves, making his maneuverability awkward. He has to keep blinking, the salt from his hair a constant, irritant sting. Gregory is tiring as well. His blows have flagged in frequency, and he’s taken enough hits to his head that Extremis is unable to keep up.
“Oh, love.” Steven rests his head on top of Anthony’s, and a brush of a kiss passes his forehead. “It’s okay.”
.” Tony says, lips forming the word like a curse, “It’s never been about wanting. It’s about how our world works. Our continued
“After Athens, when I gave that speech. You looked at me like…” It’s Steve’s turn to move his gaze away, to the grey of the walls, a safe colour that reminds him of nothing, “You didn’t know me, and you didn’t want me. Because of what I did. The blood on my hands.”
“Could I bathe first?” Anthony asks, breaking away, to pull his hair off his forehead. Steven follows the gesture, grin fading into a proud, seeking look.
The two sides are mindful of each other, not watching each other directly but aware that at any moment the pressure that simmers between them could blow open. There isn’t a weak link between them, no question of where loyalties lie, no limits to what they’ll do.
Steven finally breathes out, looking down at Anthony. His hands reach to Anthony’s by instinct before stilling, awareness flitting across his languorous eyes.
Down below, Steven’s army is gaining ground, but there are more Hydra soldiers pouring from the gate. It won’t be easy to maintain their position.
Steven has made no effort to be modest within their tent, can’t afford to be worried about nudity with the little time they have to maintain hygiene.
“No, your hands are hurt, and I wanna, I wanna --” Tony leans forward, over Steve. His arm shakes as he scissors himself, cock softening, the way it always does with initial penetration. “I want it
From the left T’Challa leads, from the right comes Clint. Thirty strong men and women on each side. Their army, tripled.
“You fell while trying to run away from me! Because I was fucked up, and you were scared, and you can’t --”
“It’s been a while.” His cock is an angry red, hints of purple, an injury begging for relief. He reaches a hand towards it when Tony gasps out an affronted sound.
The pack is curious too, drawing near Gregory’s makeshift prison to try and get a glimpse at the infamous Carver. But Thor draws them to the fire with loud wit and charm, has them laughing gregariously over a retelling of his performance at the castle. The especially curious ones – mostly soldiers who’ve fought the past few months against the Carver’s men – linger but Steven has them leave with a few glancing looks.
Anthony rests his forehead on Steven’s chest, and Steven’s eyes widen, stupefied gaze meeting Bucky’s.
“Shut up.” Gregory snarls. His horse moves restlessly at the tone, and he yanks the reins back. “Respond.”
They never tested the limits of how fast the serum made an average person, Tony thinks, watching Steve come to a stop in front of him in what felt like three broad moves.
He notes this, and then begins his search, hurried and uncaring for what he breaks as he swoops low under the steel bed, rummages in the sole drawer. He opens the wood up, hands searching the roof for a hidden catch. There’s none.
Steven smiles, a little smug, and kisses the omega openmouthedly on his gland for a breath, before pushing in harder. Anthony is still tight. Pulling out would be an almost impossible task if it weren’t accompanied with the privilege of pushing back into the hot, wet heat. It’s as if he’s being drawn in, pulled like those little metals,
Gregory laughs at that. With his armour failing him, arm dislocated and helmet useless, his twin brother finds it in him to laugh, mocking. Perhaps they are more similar than Anthony had thought.
When he was a pup, Steven’s mother told him that the Manhattenites were the most resourceful pack, had prospered in famine and war through their cleverness and knowledge.
Anthony’s heartbeat picks up, and for a moment, it feels that the sound is overfilling, his heart aligning to it.
Gregory’s face darkens. He’s taken aback by the banter, Anthony can tell, can’t see the Captain in the easygoing persona Steven’s put on.
His blue eyes, fringed with panic and fear. His hands, clutching Anthony, leaving red marks with the force of their grip. He’d come with a cry, yowling out and clutching Anthony close to him, shaking through his knot.
He still walks in tentatively, heart kicking up when he finds the tent empty. He storms back out and is about to call out for Anthony when Happy, wringing out wet clothing, flicks his head to the pond. Steven relaxes.
“And maybe after...” Anthony trails off when Steven’s gaze settles itself on Anthony, sharp and hopeful. Anthony grins at Steven’s anticipation.
But more than anything, Steve likes to -- he pulls back, and comes over Tony’s face. Tony screws his eyes shut as he laughs, and Steve smiles dopily at the sight. Tony keeps his hand on Steve’s cock -- hardening again -- and drags a fingertip through the mess, licking a strip of white off his finger. Steve lets out a breath, feels his muscles relax almost abruptly as the orgasm releases its hold on him.
Steve groans, long and guttural, and it’s like seeing the sun come out for what it does to Tony’s heart.
Steven reels back, hands jumping to behind his back. His face feels numb for a moment, everything seeming to prickle as the rage leaves his body, a flood that leaves him hollow and shocked.
“I went away again, didn’t I?” Steve asks, miserable, “Bucky was there, and I told him to, I told him --”
“Okay, good.” Tony says, obviously to himself. There’s a hand at his cock, where he’s slightly sensitive but still aroused. Tony strokes at it curiously for a while, and Steve can’t feel much of a reaction, but when he opens his eyes, it’s to his cock straightening.
“Looks like an octopus.” Anthony had said, to everyone’s confusion but Thor’s, who’d merely nodded sagely.
“Okay, okay, let’s go.” Tony soothes, as he drapes Steve’s arm over his shoulder. After a moment’s pause, he pinches Steve’s waist. Steve raises his eyebrows at him before wrinkling his nose in acquiescence.
“I,” Gregory begins, imperiously rearranging the strange pieces on the board, “Am of the opinion that my brother is wasted in your company.”
“That’s the difference, you know.” Gregory’s eyes drift away from Anthony’s, to the blue light in the corner, “Between me and you. The single, most damning difference. Further down than our designations. You’re the optimist. And I’m the realist. And so we will never see the same world.”
“I can not deny that the fair Captain mentioned, while we were sparring, how little sleep you were getting while forging these.” Thor says.
“What?” Steve says, through a mouthful of the sandwich his mom had brought. He’d finished the coffee she’d brought for him and then also had half of hers.
“I’m fine.” Anthony says, frustrated though he doesn’t quite know why, “I’m fine but you’re not listening. How can you say we’re not that different? I was born with every resource at my fingers, you were born scrambling for food.”
“Oh, ho, ho, look at me, Mister tough Alpha. Don’t need protection.” Anthony says, voice deep and throaty. “Don’t need nothing.”
Agent Sousa had come by on behalf of Peggy and said they were organising some scientist, Kennedy, to come by. Bruce had texted the group chat, saying he was feeling rough but to text him when Tony woke up. Natasha and Bucky were stuck with clean-up, according to Natasha’s quick call.
“I must say, Captain, your dinner plate gets the job done.” Thor yells down. Loki looks as if he is contemplating kicking Thor off the parapet.
Thor leads the attack, and he is a titan with armour, a god come down from Heaven, hammer by his side like an extension of his arm, war-paint struck across his face. The Hydra soldiers take one glance at him, and scream, running away. Thor’s army takes chase, blazing through Hydra soldiers from within, and it is only moments before they take control of the inner courtyard, blocking out the men’s escape routes.
“You in there?” Tony jokes, poorly. He strokes his thumbs across the skin on Steve’s cheeks, and the boy’s eyelashes flutter in tracking the motion. “Steve, Steve, it’s okay. Come back.”
“The mouth on you, Tony,” Steve says, appreciatively, as he pushes Tony’s head down and up again, spit trailing down his cock as Tony moans around it, “I don’t think I’ll ever get used to it.”
He sighs, standing up. He should give this to Pepper to organise. And he should probably draft a letter to be sent back.
Anthony flinches back, breathing raspy and loud in the morning air. His throat feels contracted, sweat dripping like tears off his skin. His hair is sticking to his forehead and he longs to draw it back, but he doesn’t dare move his eyes off Bucky.
“You’re going to give me a complex if you keep using that to manipulate my emotions.” Steven remarks.
“None,” Anthony whispers, rushed, “None. He does not hold anything over you, Steven. He is just a man.”
They’ve had this conversation many times, over the last month. It’s been well worked over, both having changed their stance multiple times, played at possible iterations of the battle and pored over contingency plans over many hours.
This is familiar, a pattern wrung out through many blowjobs until they figured out what they like best. Tony enjoys giving oral sex, and likes Steve to control him as he does it, decide when and how to use the man’s mouth. Steve likes Tony’s mouth, and likes the sight of his broad hands on Tony, the sight of Tony’s blown-out eyes and swollen lips as he devotes himself fully to the task.
Steven boldly moves his hands down Anthony’s back, resting at his waist. Anthony shivers at the sensation, but doesn’t move away. Steven relishes that.
“Just tell her you were fighting the biggest terrorist in the world.” Tony says, “Automatic guilt-trip.”
The gym door gets opened, and like an arrow his eyes meet Steve’s where he stands in the middle of the boxing ring, demolished equipment around him. His shield is nowhere in sight, but the left side of his face has a bloody smudge on it, and the sight is startling enough that Tony moves forward on instinct.
He sees it now, this brighter thing, in the quiet steadiness of Steven’s attention. In the ideals of this man, in his war. His future, a challenge and a certainty; one he accepts knowing the dazzling relief of Steven’s love.
The Hydra soldiers fighting Steven’s army are shaken, struck by the noise behind them, distracted. Steven presses forward, men and women brought higher by adrenaline and the euphoria of the sight of Thor’s attack. They rage through the Hydra men, bowling them over. Steven’s shield, notably splattered with blood, takes on more of that bright red, as he pushes forward.
Anthony shifts, and in a gentle breath, kisses Steven. They press together for a few moments, just their lips meeting for a stretch.
“Oh,” Anthony blinks. He continues fixing up the armour, letting the repeating motions settle him as he thinks.
“Looks like you’ve got a full set of party tricks.” Steve continues, watching as Tony rubs his eye again.
Tony joins him in the shower at some point. There’s nothing sexual about it. He simply stares at Steve as he washes, arms crossed and expression placid.
Steven kisses him, then, moving in a flash, the motion a quick peck that Anthony pulls him back in to continue. Steven’s groin moves between Anthony’s legs, hands pulling apart Anthony’s legs with confident ease. They both groan when Steven thrusts close.
“Together? Is this what that looks like for you?” Steven growls, “Gagging and tying him, keeping him imprisoned?”
Minutes after re-convening, Anthony walks back to the edge of the cliffside. He whistles, a long, low note.
Steve had just finished strangling a hydra to death, kneeling in sticky mud and panting from exertion. When he’d looked up, he’d found Tony watching him. He’d been in his armour, only his head visible from the deep reds and golds that ran down his body. Brown hair and brown eyes.
Anthony jolts forward to strike, foot cutting forward. Bucky jumps neatly over the low kick, but Anthony had expected this, and he pushes forward while Bucky is resettling, kicking mercilessly at his kneecaps.
Tony blinks a few more times, eyes flashing that eerie black before flickering to coffee brown. They open completely after a few moments of this, and stay at black film.
Steve drinks his coffee and asks for the bill while Tony thinks. The last two donuts get packed while Steve does his usual painstaking routine of calculating the tip on paper before Tony interjects with the amount. It’s when they’re walking out of the restaurant that Tony finally knows what he wants.
“Hey, what’s with the extra security detail?” Bucky asks, walking in through the glass doors. Natasha walks in behind him. They’re both still grimy from the battle, which reminds Steve that he’s also yet to shower.
“You will not be made to build anything you don’t want to.” Steven awkwardly reassures, “I believe Pepper will be satisfied enough with some new tools for cooking.”
Anthony makes a sobbing, grateful noise, and runs, uncaring of the ache in his body, how wobbly his insides feel. He rips off Bucky's mask, tossing it to the Alpha as he passes him.
“Hydra have wreaked havoc on the world for too long.” Steven says, “And, there was a time I didn’t know of them, didn't know who was the cause of all that pain in my childhood. Now that I do, I can not look away. Some days, I wish I could.”
“Definitely a demotion.” Bucky agrees, coming up next to him. His mask is over his face, and his voice comes out like a grating rasp.
A single man trots out on a black horse, golden hair flying in the wind as he rides forward. His armour is a pale white, almost tauntingly clean in the anticipation of battle.
“That’s very rich coming from you, Alpha.” Anthony says, and Steven knows the “Alpha” is purposeful, an attempt to soothe Steven’s sharp edges.
He’s not sure of it himself, had been furious in the same breath that he’d been sick with worry as he sat in the ambulance with Tony, the boy’s eyes black like a demon’s from a film. Tony had been blabbering nonsense about neural pathways, and Steve had wanted to kiss him and strangle him and hold him. But he’d bite his tongue before admitting that to Mr. Stark.
Tony watches Steve pull at his scalp for all of three seconds before he’s reaching out, pulling the hands into his. Steve’s hands unfurl and he grips Tony’s hands, eyes on where the gauntlet is shimmering just out of apparition.
Steve clutches Tony’s face, and brings him close, kissing him, once, then twice, and then, because the ridiculous realisation that he
“Good.” Bucky replies, letting a bit of his Alpha seep through. It’s ineffective against Steven, so it serves mostly as a reminder.
He turns his gaze to the gate. He’d had to rely on hearsay for a layout of the castle, maids and guards that Natasha had scouted out in a frenzy. Based on that, they’d made an educated guess that Anthony was being kept in the West wing, in the barracks with the prisoners. Steven works through the route in his head again. It’s either that or think of Anthony, and that’ll lead him to spiral into thinking of what’s happened to him, whether he’s hurt, whether he’s –
“Tony, he didn’t tell anyone.” Steve taps at his hand until he looks up, “Not even Nat. Peggy only told me when she got his notice by email.”
"If the fucker hadn't come back to life, it wouldn't have been an issue in the first place." Bucky mutters, darkly.
“He’s worried. He said he didn't – look it doesn’t even matter. I can help him, and he’s gonna hurt himself the longer he’s in that state. You know, we’ve both seen it.” Tony pleads, "You can't say you'll stand by and let that happen."
“Well,” Tony shakes his head, “Yeah? It’s not like it’s totally out of bounds for me to be in love with you? I mean, we’re dating!”
“I understand that.” Steve clenches his teeth in an attempt to keep his words in, “But you don’t think he’d appreciate having you here, considering he’s nearly died?”
There’s conversations to be had, but not in this moment, Tony thinks, not now. Steve’s resting, finally, easy and light in his sleep. Tony is curled up next to him, eyes on the clean movement of Steve’s chest. No blood, no rage, no omens. It’s almost shameful how quickly he falls to sleep, armour dormant in his skin, fingers hooked in Steve's shirt.
“An old phrase from empires, years back.” Anthony tilts his head, Steven’s cockhead resting at the corner of his lips, “Can’t remember who or when exactly, though. May not be a good guy.”
They move across the walls. Clint is light and quick on his feet, and Anthony has to sprint to keep pace at his heels. The rooftops are a mirage of safety, empty and elevated, but it would be foolish to neglect how exposed they are. They reach the final corner, turning into the concave centre of the fortress.
It’s distressing, to think that Tony had nearly been killed today and to save himself, had been forced to inject an unknown virus into his body. A virus which had left him with black eyes, panicked and crying in Steve’s arms as Peggy had desperately tried to bring him down. And now, he was here, asleep with only Steve by his side.
“Uh, to be fair, I’d planned on waiting until Bruce came back before having this conversation,” Steve says, “But Peggy says he’s requested a two week break.”
“You won’t.” Anthony says, “Because you will have people with you. Me, Bucky, Nat, Thor. We will be there, and we will make sure you are doing the right thing.”
Tony withdraws his fingers slowly, and Steve sucks on them, lavishing at each moment the joints and knuckles that make up Tony’s hand. Bite marks, faintly imprinted, remain as Tony slips free.
“Steve, Steve, wait, let me.” Tony scrambles, turning around. He’s rough as he pushes Steve down onto the desk and unravels his robe. Steve’s cock juts out, thick and long, and Tony’s hand grips the base of it before he bends down and licks hotly at the head.
“Stevie...lost himself. Went right at him, but there was something different about the man. Even after the experiments and the serum, he was never this strong. He threw Steve back fifteen feet. Clawed the flesh off Clint’s legs. And when Maria managed to get his mask off...”
“There was no other way.” He repeats the words dully, recalling Tony’s crackling voice over the comms. Bruce’s horrified expression as HULK gave way to the boy, and Tony explained what he was injecting himself with. Natasha climbing over Steve’s frozen body on the rocks, single-minded even in chaos. Bucky’s voice, from his perch, hesitant in the abrupt silence.
“That’s not fair,” Tony nudges Steve up so the boy has to make eye contact with him, “It was my turn to be nice to you.”
Steve rests a hand on Tony’s cheek, stroking upwards before unceremoniously thwacking his face, “We don’t have to make it a thing.”
“So what would you suggest?” Steven asks, something unfamiliar blooming in his chest. Something that tastes like the rapid heartbeat of a rabbit before it’s killed.
Anthony doesn’t quite know if he fits here, amongst the warriors, but he looks to Steven and knows what holds him in place.
Steve leans back, and watches him impassively as Tony eats the rest of the donut and downs the just-not-hot-enough coffee.
“Of course you don’t.” Gregory says, “It killed me, though. To have you beat me in this, with such a simping grin on your face. I have never hated someone so deeply.”
Anthony kicks back against the table, pushing back a good five feet just as the ceiling caves in. Clint and Bucky tackle Gregory, pushing his body onto the floor. Natasha jumps through a moment after, stepping over the clumps of stone and running to Anthony to untie him.
“Steven!” Anthony gasps, turning to him with a shocked expression, “You choose today, the day of our bonding ceremony, to betray me?”
“Just curious.” He remembered thumbing at the line of Tony’s goatee, pressing at the skin there, the contrast between the hair and skin.
“I’m not mad at you, Anthony.” Steven says, “It’s not even that upsetting, really. Lets me know when I need to reel it back. But it is disappointing, sometimes.”
“Donuts and coffee, that was the first step. I’m thinking distraction and comfort as the theme.” Steve suggests.
Steven is looking to them when Anthony turns his head back. Anthony can’t read his expression from here, but he catches the flash of teeth as Steven’s face splits open, shield lifting upwards. The army congregates behind him, breaking into sections. Six soldiers stay behind to tend the wounded, the remainder charge ahead, howling in excitement, fully immersed in the battle.
Steven grows bolder after a few minutes of kissing, the difference as marked as sleep and life as he turns Anthony over and onto the ground. He’s quick to assume power over Anthony, his hands moving quickly over his torso as he kisses; wet, teasing touches that have Anthony arching to meet him midway.
Cannonballs get shot into walls, raining fire on ramparts, guards with bows being thrown off. They use smaller balls, shoot four or five at a time, taking out entire rows of guards.
The men are dispersed in a loose formation, uniform in appearance with their war gear. Anthony had gone through several revisions with the armour for their soldiers, and he’d finally settled on an economic gear made by strong, simple iron, a delicate balance between protection and maneuverability.
Tony beckons him close, eyes still closed. Steve’s eyes widen, and he quickly sits, and then lays onto the bed. Tony moves to give him space, but Steve makes a small, protesting noise and Tony halts.
“Stop.” Bucky whirls around, puts his hands on Anthony’s shoulder. “You’re in shock, okay? It’s a normal response. We were just blown out of the sky. I understand how you feel right now. But you
It’s beautiful, Steven thinks, somewhere far back in his mind where he’s still capable of fully conscious thought, that as Steven’s knot expands, Anthony’s cock fills, hardening again under the weight of Steven’s knot.
“Always do.” Is her final remark before she leaves entirely. Anthony watches her descent to the frontlines, where fifty-some soldiers stand. Steven is by Bucky’s side now, and they break off their conversation when Natasha reaches them. She says something to them, head tilted innocuously, and Steven’s head turns to Anthony, meeting his gaze.
Steven smiles, knocks on his shield twice before pointing at Anthony. The soldiers take note of this, and there are cheers and giggles at the Alpha’s display. It is for the soldiers, for them to see that behind their war is an Alpha stabilised by a marital bond. It is for the soldiers, shows them there is love and pleasure beyond the fighting they’ve grown accustomed to in the past few years.
And it isn't perfect, and they're not as well as they both say, but the war is finally won, and they're still together.
“So, you’re saying, he’s stuck like this?” Steve says, horror and fear like coils around his lungs. I don’t have asthma anymore, he reminds himself, consciously breathing in and out in beat with the rhythm of Tony’s heart.
“How could you?” Tony had smiled then, again. Softer. The kind Steve would see him offer his followers, time and time again, in the decades that followed. The kind of smile that made you believe.
He can feel his cum pumping into Anthony, can feel the clenching and unclenching of Anthony’s rim, can feel his arm around the omega’s torso, his scent strong where Steven’s nosing his neck. There’s little else, for a while.
“It’s nice.” Tony says, but he doesn’t move away from Steve’s chest. Steve can feel Tony’s tears on his suit, and he rubs his arms up and down his back reassuringly. His mom gives him a smile before leaving, a determined glint in her eyes that tells Steve that words are going to be had.
“Get to the room, get Anthony.” Steven spits out. Rage runs through his body freely, warming his body like a blanket, giving him a sharp, pointed clarity. Bucky sighs behind him, but doesn’t say anything else as they run through the halls, Steven mapping the course to the probable room.
“Tent?” Steven asks, and Anthony thinks of trekking out to their tent, Steven likely carrying him there, in plain view of anyone who may be walking around.
As he stands next to the omega, listening to the elder Starrk recite the bonding rites, he rearranges his plans. He hadn’t accounted for an omega, and the new traveling companion means they will likely have to delay the charge into Boston.
Anthony relaxes his throat, a few stretching moments where he can’t quite feel it expand until he starts to move forward, letting his hands guide Steven’s cock into his throat. It’s obtrusive, at first, discomfiting and awkward. Anthony perseveres, breathing deep through his nose, careful not to contract his throat too much with it. He keeps his eyes wide, blinking rapidly to ease the sting. His jaw hurts, already, but the ache is secondary to the intrusion in his throat.
The fact that Steven is approaching him now, based on a comment half-hopingly thrown out by Anthony one evening – it’s a gift.
“He told me not to let you in.” Bucky continues, “Half out of his mind, and that’s what he tells me before telling me to guard the door and wait. You don’t think he’s got a reason for that?”
“You make me,” Steven’s eyes dart away for a moment before returning, belligerently almost, to Anthony’s, “You make me want a future.”
“I’ve done what I can for him here.” Howard replies, holding up a vial of red liquid. “This blood sample should give us enough to start investigating the composition of the virus.”
your snark and belligerence implying otherwise,” Steven says lightly to ease the sting, “Have an awfully low opinion of yourself.”
Anthony smiles, as if he can read Steven’s mind. He finishes putting on the salve and then goes to wash his hands.
“I will do this.” Anthony says quietly, “But it is my choice. I wish that you acknowledge this. You did not force or pressure me. I chose to do this of my own – of my own free will.”
Steven drops the furs, walking forward until he can comfortably meet Anthony’s eyes. To his credit, Anthony doesn’t shift back.
Steven spends the next hour almost pointed in his busyness, ensuring Gregory is guarded by people he trusts. The chilling, dark shade that passes over Gregory’s expression when he sees Steven pass, his eyes following him like a promise, unsettles Steven enough that he arranges Maria, Bucky and Natasha on alternating shifts over the man.
“You want it?” Steve asks. He pulls them down onto the floor, lays back and stretches his arms out. He knows what it does to Tony to see the sprawl of muscle, and smirks openly when Tony’s eyes skip over his shoulders. He clears his throat, and Tony snaps back to him.
“You’re fighting for me?” Anthony croaks, throat raw, though it feels a while ago that he’d had Steven down his throat.
“No.” Anthony retorts, “Maybe. I don’t know! I mean, you’re the one who’s so adamant on us being equals, but you never speak to me, not about yourself or your worries or how you feel. And I care about you, so it hurts. That you don’t trust me like that.”
Steve has a brief second where he registers that the fingers are slippery, incredibly hot against his palate, scraping at his walls, and then he realises where they’ve been, and that’s it. He’s coming, again, flashes of fireworks and bright spots that fade quickly until he’s gazing at the hazy figure of Tony, teeth clenched around the man’s fingers in the aftermath.
Anthony looks up to meet Steven’s gaze. The Alpha has concern wrinkling his eyebrows, aware of a depth to Anthony’s words that he himself can’t quite articulate.
It had not been Steven’s desire to bond. Perhaps in the daydream moments of childhood, he had thought of a family, future pups and a home high in the country. Now, he thinks of the future only over maps and battle plans.
Tony removes his hands, revealing red, teary eyes. “You’re so arrogant. Do you know? You’re the most arrogant person I know.”
Arrows get shot, and their army readies with shields, hunkering down and protecting themselves. Noise comes from the inside of the castle, and Hydra soldiers stream out like ants from a hill, quick and unrelenting.
“Beat me?” Schmidt’s eyelids rise, a simulacrum of the raised eyebrows he no longer has, “The loss of slaves doesn’t concern me. It’s the fight between the titans that I wait for.”
Steven gets meditative when he’s knotting, so when every immediate concern after popping his knot is handled (
Anthony lifts his tunic, and slices a small, bloody line into his skin where the flesh is thick and strong.
“Steve, I don’t care.” Tony says, firmer than needed. His brow is resolute as he turns away from Steve to open up a piece of machinery in the table, releasing screws onto the wood. The clattering noise is a warning.
Steven exhales, shaky, and nods, turning his gaze to Anthony’s face. He walks out like that, bloody hands holding Anthony with quiet care.
“But you will be honest with me,” Anthony pleads, “Excepting that I am your omega. You will be honest with me as a leader to his follower.”
There had been more missions in the past month than they were used to, since the Mandarin had launched an aggressive attack against Iron Man, and by extension, the Avengers. While Peggy had strategised and protected them from the media campaign, they weren’t able to avoid, and frankly hadn’t wanted to avoid, the attacks that had kicked off in China.
“I have nothing to say to you, but this.” Anthony says, hands and face steady even as his eyes leak, “You lived as a coward, traitor and parasite. Now, you will die being recognised as such.”
The Hydra soldiers don’t pay attention to their fallen comrades, circling around the cannonball and sprinting. The injured reach their hands out, pleading, and Anthony watches a masked woman cut them down as she sprints past.
Anthony rolls his eyes, and the gesture seems to satisfy her, eyes still glinting in that hard, brittle light. Like metal before it splits open.
“No, it’s not!” Tony replies, louder than he’d intended, and instinctively he looks around the diner. The few people there don’t seem to have noticed, though the waitress at the bar does make eye contact with Tony. Tony breaks off, and looks down at the powdered sugar and crumbs on his plate.
“Okay, okay,” Steve flashes a quick grin, “Counter-counter proposal, we go out for donuts and coffee.”
“Oh, sweetie, I know. Come here.” His mom’s lavender scent fills his senses and it makes him cry harder, the mess inside him bursting out. He’s hugging her harder than he should, can feel the outline of her bones, but she’s kissing his head, and she’d let him know if it was painful, so he forgets it and holds her close.
He swipes a streak of blood on Steven’s right cheek, then his left. It’s not as clean as the blue and white paint, but the colour is vibrant, almost glowing on his pale skin.
“They told me that they had to remove all the electronic devices from this room.” His mom says, a little later.
Time blurs a little, Anthony feeling himself sink into a stupor, into Steven’s arms. He doesn’t feel like thinking, his mind satisfied enough that it sits back, lets sensation take him somewhere low and safe.
“Let go, or else I’ll get the armour out.” Tony says, trying to yank his arm out of Bucky’s grip. Bucky holds firm, and pulls him far enough that the gym door is no longer in Tony’s line of sight.
“I was there, okay?” Steve presses, “And I’m saying, it wasn’t your fault. We had a plan, we’d discussed precautions beforehand, and truthfully, it went a lot better than it could --”
The last few months have brought many rounds of ... long, passionate love-making during which Anthony is consistently and shamelessly loud, noises that Steven draws out of him with poorly concealed delight.
Steven takes Anthony apart slowly. Agonisingly slow, like he’s gleaning every gesture in his mind, a sequence to trace out later. Steven coaxes him through it, hands seeming everywhere: in him, on his nipples, across his torso, by his bond. His lips are an anchor, mooring Anthony with tender presses.
“I acknowledge this.” Steven replies. He wants to say more, to reassure Anthony, but his omega is iron now, gaze drawn and clean in the summer air.
Her hands go to her armour. Her hands come to Anthony’s head, pull him closer, until he’s level with her crotch, her Alpha’s scent strong and hot. A dagger presses at his skull.
“Buck,” Steve straightens even with the sudden lethargy that's taken over him, characteristic now of these -- incidents, “Gotta have a word with you.”
While she gets back up, Anthony runs and picks up the dagger she’d thrown at him. He turns to her, clenching the dagger. His mind flicks through memories of trainings with daggers... all two of them.
It’s been a few hours. They’re back at camp, having captured Gregory, and at Anthony’s insistence, freed the four prisoners. It had been a feat, getting out of the castle without alerting anyone to their presence, and Thor had eventually had to charge the courtyard with a bloodcurdling roar, playing the role of maddened warlord to perfection. He’d been such a terror that the drunk men and women had still been scrambling for their weapons, weak and stumbling with full bellies, when the titan had leaped back over the castle walls.
“And in the sharing of blood, I am become yours.” Anthony echoes the first words they had spoken to each other, that had brought them together more completely than either had realised. He’d hated it, then, had been resigned and furious, scared and rebellious. How little he’d known, how little he’d had.
This is what Steve thinks of, alone, at night, after he’s killed and been killed in return. Tony bent over him, eyes barely open, mouth a tortured, pouty twist, red on his cheeks and chest, sweat a glossy cover across his skin, a tremor in his body as he pulls himself open, carving out space for Steve to occupy.
So this is Gregory Starrk, Steven thinks, even as his eyes flicker between Anthony and his captor. In face, he’s frighteningly similar in appearance to Anthony. But his body is a broad, tall thing. His hair is a shock of blonde, almost green in tint. He’s a clear Alpha, though the rumours of his exploits blur the credibility of his appearance.
“One day, after we beat Hydra,” Steven tells Anthony, “We’ll have another bonding ceremony, a proper one, with celebrations, and dancing, and more happiness. More love.”
“Hey!” Tony says, and Steve yawns into his face, laughing harder when Tony can’t help but yawn back. “Cheater!”
“It took me a while to get there with you too.” Steven replies, “Frankly, I still don’t really understand what goes on in that brain of yours.”
Anthony could never hope to reach that. Their ferocity and hardiness was something forged in their childhood, poverty and war carving off the fat of security and comfort that lined Anthony’s tummy. They were battle-worn. They’d lived more, seen more, done more, in their twenty-some years than Anthony had.
He mirrors the streaks on the other side, and quickly cleans his fingers on a cloth. Then, he dips into the white paint, painting under the blue on both sides. At the red paint, he stops, thinking.
The Hydra soldiers watch them quietly, their presence silent but looming. Their bodies stay subtly attuned to Schmidt, their hunger for violence as palpable as lust.
“But there is something I must also ask of you.” Anthony continues, “Between us, I request that you call me Tony.”
“You are the farthest thing from “okay”.” Tony throws back. His shoulders are a stiff, tense line as he washes his hands in a sink. Steve walks up behind him, presses his lips against the skin on the juncture between Tony’s neck and shoulder. Tony stills under him.
Steven focuses on Anthony’s pleasure as the omega starts writhing on him, consciously pushing down to meet Steven’s cock. He plays with Anthony’s nipples until they pebble, redden in a colour they only seem to get in heat. He licks and kisses Anthony’s body. He pulls at the omega’s cock with quick, rubbing strokes on his head.
Tony grabs lube … from somewhere, Steve doesn’t see where, because it’s only a few seconds before Tony’s shoving two fingers unceremoniously up his ass. Steve’s mouth gapes as his hand reaches over to clutch Tony’s ass, pulling at a cheek to give Tony better access to his hole. It’s natural to hold Tony, but it takes a few moments for Steve to connect what he’s seeing to reality.
Steve stills, and it’s only then that Tony realises he’d been moving, vibrating on the spot prior, like a machine overworked. His gaze isn’t quite human where it rests on Tony’s, there’s something too fixed in the gaze, unflinching. It's not quite unfamiliar.
Steven drags Stane by the bulge of his neck, taking the rocky, jutting path to where Anthony is watching. His omega’s eyes track Steven’s movements even as his hands shake in stilted, slight moments.
“Steve, I’m your friend.” Tony says, “Before any of this, that’s what we agreed. That we would be friends, no matter what. Before co-leaders, before boyfriends, before any of it, we would take care of each other. So you can’t ask me to know you’re in pain, and expect me to keep on with my life. You sure wouldn’t.”
“I just had a maths exam.” Tony rolls his eyes, “Finished it and came here when I got the alert the mission went wrong.”
“Okay, okay.” Anthony closes his eyes, lets himself leak into Steven, resting his head on his armour.
“Perhaps our intelligence network needs bolstering.” Steven suggests, “I will have to speak to Natasha.”
“It fits well.” Thor shakes his shoulders a little, “Though I don’t think I need this much padding.”
There is blood, gushing over the rocks and grass. Steven pulls Anthony back by the elbow so it doesn’t land on him.
Steve had not ever figured out how to describe the magnificent beauty that he had seen, hadn’t dared sketch it out of fear that he would sully it. He had simply stared until he remembered to leave. It had been the most difficult thing to look away, once it had gotten its jaws on you.
He had heard his God’s -- he had heard his own voice in his head, directing him through the pantheon. He remembered thinking he couldn’t afford mercy then, could only think of the steps he had to take. His heart had pulsed in his brain. He’d made a dance of the whirling savagery that came from his shield.
Tony pauses, crossing his arms at Steve who remains annoyingly placid in his anticipation, “You’re paying.”
“That’s a real nice sentiment.” Tony says, raising his eyebrows. He takes a sip from the coffee, and reaches for the chocolate donut that Steve had on his plate, half-eaten. It’s a mark of Steve’s pity for him that he doesn’t make a fuss about it.
Anthony hands him an unused cloth from his pocket, and Bucky grunts his thanks as he brings it to his mouth.
Anthony waits him out, lips moving off Steven’s cock and releasing his grip when he clocks the Alpha’s sensitivity. He rests his hands on Steven’s thighs, lightly furred and muscled. His head settles atop his hands.
Anthony certainly plays the role of bored, impertinent omega with ease. It would be a perfect disguise were it not for his keen interest in their battle meetings, discussions where Steven’s grown accustomed to him sitting by his side, silent but ever-watchful.
“But I am --” Anthony frowns as he continues, “I am not sure if I fit here, with all of you. I don’t have the experience. I haven’t fought, not truly. How could I speak amongst warriors?”
in this pack.” Steven says, “Before you knew them, liked them even, you were helping them. That is something Gregory would never think to do.”
When he drifts back to the awareness of his knot deflating, the first thing he hears is Anthony’s lilting voice.
It’s only when they reach the stairs leading to the barracks that they hear a guard’s drawl. He exchanges a look with Bucky, and they move down the stairs, Bucky’s crossbow propped up.
Steven nods, only realising he’s repeating the motion when Anthony’s hand dislodges from his bond. Steven catches the hand before it falls away, bringing it to his lips, kissing a prayer into the knuckles for a moment.
“Huh,” His mom squints, “Well, they didn’t confiscate my phone when I was coming through security, so I’m guessing it’s not too serious. I just turned it off. But there’s no heart monitor, no IV. Kind of surprising considering what he’s been through.”
Steve can’t see Tony’s hole, but he can see the movement of Tony’s fingers, in and out, this way and that. He’s almost rapturous as he watches, kissing Tony’s hip as he lets himself be blatant in his fixation.
Steve sits on the bed, careful not to dislodge anything. Tony doesn’t look any different, just a little pale and grimy from the mission.
Steve rolls his eyes, “I’m not the genius between the two of us. We’re not gonna figure that out today. Think more short-term.”
Tony gives him a dark look before climbing into the pit, ignoring Steve’s outstretched hand and trying not to wobble as he lands weirdly. Steve huffs and turns back to scoop some more soil.
“Are we going?” Steve says, impatience and exhaustion evident in his expression. Tony and Bucky exchange a quick look, and Tony winces apologetically. Bucky’s expression clears, and he nods, gentle.
“Because your instinct is to protect. Whenever you have used your brain and reached your hands out to metal, it has always been to help someone. Me, Bucky, Clint, Nat,
Tony knows Steve pretty well, has seen him in his deepest mortification, his darkest anger, his brightest joy – but there are moments when Steve still surprises him, silences Tony with a straight-faced delivery.
They come across three people on the way; Steven knocks out the alphas cleanly, Bucky gags and ties the matronly omega to the light fixture with her own dress.
Anthony steps back, wipes the tears that slipped out. Steven doesn’t let him out of his arms though, simply holds him tighter when Anthony makes a questioning noise.
Clint visibly exhales in relief, then nods. He takes out a red arrow from his boot, one that glistens bright as he settles it in. The arrow sprinkles red flecks of light into the air, a discordant, trilling noise spreading from them.
Steven presses against Anthony’s rim, loosened enough that Steven suspects he’d fingered himself before coming to him. He asks Anthony this, and the omega smirks, leaning up to whisper the exact details into Steven’s ears, of how he’d taken himself apart with four fingers -- “Only equaling to two of yours,” Anthony teased -- and then came on his fingertips to the thought of – “Your wide knot keeping me open.” Anthony finishes.
He gathers Anthony’s legs high and close, starts moving slowly and deeply, watching Anthony’s face as he pants, before the pleasure really hits him, and he starts moaning, loud and wanton.
