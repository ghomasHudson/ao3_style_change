Steve just grabs his food, and throws a smirk at them before heading back to his room.
-fluff towards the end
Rhodey wasn’t the only one worrying and fretting about him, perhaps the least subtle in his actions, more open, more questioning, a silent rage behind the calm demeanour (not angry at Tony, never angry at Tony even though Tony let that happen to him, to his legs) – he had always been that way and at any other time, any other situation, Tony would have been appreciative of it, would have drawn him close and wrapped his arms around him, and Rhodey would have engulfed him and kissed the top of his head like he always did.
"Always."
Happy New Year to this story! Hope you guys enjoy, just know Bucky is shitty at words, he's really not mean!
They lock eyes momentarily, and before Steve can even get a word out, he's getting dragged towards the smaller man, his arms coming to circle around his waist. "Babe, where have you been?"
On his way back to the room, he spots Morgan standing up in her crib, staring at him with wide, wet eyes.
"Fine, but what do we do when he asks to use our phones to text him or whatever? You know they don't go to bed without phone sex, or whatever the fuck it is Steve is doing up passed three."
When his Dad brings the kids to visit him the next day, he can't bring himself to look at him. The phone feels like it's burning a hole through the mattress and at any time might just make itself known.
He tries to subtly pull a pillow out from under the bed-usurper's head before pausing, recognising the tangled nest of curls. Steve lifts the blanket back from the as-yet unidentified figure's head, and is equal parts relieved and worried to see Tony.
"My robot puppy, intent on destroying the world."
"Tony."
"I heard him crying," the boy admits, fingers curled around his doorframe. "But he was already with you, I didn't want to disturb you guys..."
"An Omega with principles, you don't get a lot those now do you, Thunderbolt?" The name drove fear into Tony's heart. Thunderbolt was a member of the bandit group, the Wrecking Crew, who had been terrorising small towns in the Mid-West for years now.
Tony grinds his teeth, schooling his expression before meeting Namor's head-on. "Go on and believe what you want, about me and about them, but this is me warning you and offering you something better. This is worth a try."
"Oh sh-"
but yes we're in 😪
Guaranteed he sees an equal in Riri
From: MJ
Gwen's smile bares all her teeth, and Harley pushes down a shudder. The world was lucky they were afraid of Dad, otherwise they would have been wrecking havoc by now.
Ned had told him to smash it, or throw it off of the side of a building, anything to just get rid of it, and Peter should, really. It would be the smart thing to do, he just... couldn't though. Not yet.
"I know, but I still make time to come look for you every Saturday. You've been blowing me off." Natasha studies her friend, from his slightly-thinner frame, to the poorly concealed deep-set circles under his eyes.
While Tony had always laughed at her stories of Omegas dancing off into the night to join Satan's choir, something has him frozen, and when the goat bucks towards him with his horns, he finds himself sprinting off the street and into the woods that lined the town.
"Come on, Stevie, don't be mad. Look, he seems lonely, maybe you should go keep him company or something," Bucky says, waggling his eyebrows suggestively.
"Get off, Jerk, your breath stinks."
Seeing the boys worried look, Tony glances into the room, Peter still sound asleep. "Listen, Bud, you have nothing to worry about," Tony tries to reassure him, squatting down in front of the boy. "Do you remember when Peter was getting sick all the time a couple of years ago? His tummy was weak and he had to spend some time in the hospital?"
It feels amazing, the stretch and fullness and slight burn of Steve in him. There's a moment where Steve shifts, adjusting their position, and starts slamming his hips into Tony's ass, and
"Ugh, fine. But I'm only shaking on it if you both agree the deal is null and void if you don't make it happen by the Spring Formal."
"Welcome to the free world, Tones," Janet shouts, grabbing the back of his shirt and pulling him back towards them.
Stiff and exhausted, he gave up peering around the room when a figure appeared at the door, an angel whose hair was cast in a halo of light from the lamp in his hands.
"...about Steve."
Feeling cold suddenly, Tony darted upright, wincing when pain shoots from his ankle. "The sheriff?"
"Why did you come to me, why not Steve?"
"Come on, Sam. I caused this by running my mouth, let me fix it."
"No, not that, Steve." Tony sits up, the quilt falling away from him to pool around his waist. "I'm really sorry, this wasn't fair to you."
"If the rest of them wanted oversight they'd have joined Lang and Barton."
"Morning." They exchange a soft smile, Tony leaning down as Steve leans up to lock their lips.
Steve bursts out laughing, raising himself to his knees and getting a grip on Tony's thigh and hip before picking up his pace with long, smooth strokes.
"I won't start a team or anything, but it's okay."
The bruises hadn't cleared up, and Tony hadn't realised how exhausted and defeated he'd actually been until Reed had tucked him into the back of the wagon between his wares and he'd just passed right out.
Shooting up and smiling brightly at his dad, Harley claps him on the shoulders. "Really, Dad? Would you help me win the affections of my lady love?" he asks excitedly, grinning from ear to ear.
From: Ned Stark
Not noticing Harley's far-off look, Tony flicks his ear. "Firstly, don't squish my baby like that, and secondly, if I'm silly, you're both silly too, remember th- hey!" Tony's cut off as Harley pushes past them and plants himself in front of the Angel.
"Then I would just be wasting both of our time explaining."
Steve's working his fingers inside of him, Tony grappling for purchase on his broad back, when Tony lifts himself and shifts slightly, a keening moan ripping out of him.
"You tryin' to say something, Tony?"
"Thor, where the fuck did you come from?" Bucky sits up, pointing an accusing finger at him. "Don't you have a paper due tomorrow?"
"What do you mean you panicked?"
There's very little activity in the common rooms, except for the greenies diligently cleaning up the mess around them and Clint chewing on frozen waffles in a lawn chair, getting more in the way than helping.
When he's just outside the room, a door opens and a voice startles him. "Is Peter going to be okay?" Harley's gnawing at his lip, his brows furrowed in worry.
"Oh, shut, Tony." Reed marches up the stairs, Tony's laughing ringing in his ears.
"Let me get you an uber, or ask Rhodey to if you're not comfortable with me. It's a long way back to your place."
"Did you know there was a new smithy in town? An Omega."
"Yeah, you must be right."
"What it dooooo, Stevie?" Bucky shouts over the music, already slurring his words together and grabbing Steve's hand to knock back his drink.
They weren't his minions per se, Harley had tried to train them to be loyal to him when Pete first started off the brother wars by dumping Harley to hang out with Ned, but they had proved to be too wilful, and loyal to each other only.
Carefully, Tony shuffles them around, laying Peter against the pillows and crawling out of bed to go search for the medicine.
Steve doesn't really understand what just happened.
"Harley."
"You hear? Don't you get around to Nat's too?"
"We can grab something and eat it here, I really want to get the planning out of the way for right now."
Harley huffs, spinning around to stare at them. "Yeah, and I still got in trouble because you didn't help me wipe out the flight log."
"No, you're right. Things have been getting too intense. What was I thinking gettong involved with someone like Steve? He's a white picket fence type, and I want highrises. Oil and water, you know?"
You're saying dad knows how bad it gets for me, but do YOU even know?
The chapter in which things move kind of fast, we establish some plot, and Natasha returns home.
"I'm literally just annoyed with both of your voices, and Steve can't shoot dice to save his life. Winning doesn't seem as satisying."
Jess snorts, waking Morgan, and jumps to rock her back to sleep. "Scoping out the territory, I say," she whispers loudly, a gentle hand rubbing up and down the baby's back.
"Sleepin' and drinkin', why? When did you come by?"
"Yeah, it's the last time I'll ever listen to my mother. I ran away from a perfectly innocent goat straight into the hands of bandits," Tony explains, reaching over to take another sip of water. "Or maybe what she said was true, and he was the reason that happened. Oh Lord, I guess I'll have to go to church on Sunday."
Charmed, Steve smiles down at him, resting a steady hand on the back of his neck. "Of course not, Tony. Thanks for being willin' to come out here."
"Well," Tony starts, handing the packages over to Steve, "I thought we needed more than just my expertise. Turns out the town's library, though ancient and barely even running, has quite an extensive collection on farming. You boys ever go down there during bad harvests?"
"Ye-yes! It's creepy! Sue!"
"And I'm Sam."
Peter glances around the yard, trying to spy where Harley might have hid. "Oh- no, I want to- well I'd have to think about it, you know? I've been trying to stay downlow for a bit; once the media get a wiff of a supe joining a team, they start swarming. And I promised my dads I'd be careful and low-key."
Hope you guys enjoy 😘
"No way!"
"Okay-wait-" Tony giggles, collapsing into his arms. "God this is funny. Where's Steve?"
"You drink Mr Stark?"
By the time they join Sam downstairs, he's pacing in front of the door gesturing for Thor to unlock it. Tony is giggling up a storm sitting in the corner above Bruce, the genius' head cradled between his thighs.
Of course I care Peter. You're my son.
The Champions were a superhero teen society that operated all over the world. Riri was currently the only superkid in Queens that belonged to the society, joining after assisting them in (as usual for New York) a world-ending event. While many of the Champions kept their identities hidden, she was one of the few who didn't, and thus was able to be Iron Heart more often.
"Well okay then Just Tony, it's a pleasure meeting you."
The men approached him gradually, one pushing his hood off his head to reveal a masked face, leering at him so hard, his rotting teeth were showing.
"No, Steve. It's not the sex, you're very thoughtful and caring, I promise. I just don't think things are working anymore, and I want you to respect that," Tony says, chewing his lip. Steve is silent again, his shoulders drooping like they had the weight of the world on them.
@themechanic
Between the next few shots that cried into the air, someone stumbled over with heavy boots, yanking him up by the hair. "Now you boys go on ahead before I shoot the bit-" before Thunderbolt could finish the sentence, a bullet and his brain became acquainted with each other, splattering blood and brain matter over Tony's face.
The number of times the word ‘trauma’ had been used to describe some part of Tony’s injuries nauseated her, and the visuals his file provided were some of the worst things Natasha had seen in her long life. One had been trapped in her mind for days now though, keeping her out of sleep and making eating anything more than a few spoonfuls of soup and rice impossible: a torso-length picture had been taken by one doctor or the other, Tony’s body exposed, bruised a horrible shade of blue with large cuts and stitches littering him from collarbone to the underside of his belly.
Steve, flushed red from the warm sun, looks over his shoulder. "Yeah, Bucky got those. The fertiliser we got was the right one?"
*sorry
It's not that he doesn't want to be here, shit, he'd been the one to suggest staying for the party, but trying to keep track of all your drunk friends wasn't the easiest thing in the world, especially when he himself was trying to get drunk. And hopefully
Your dad is the best parent I know. Do you know how I know that?
"Hey!" Tony cries, unhooking his arms from the two of them and walking ahead. "So I bring you two together and you unionise against me?"
Suppressing a groan, Steve swallows down another gulp of his pitiful beer. "Yeah, so what? Is it a crime to enquire about a new member of our school, Natasha?"
"Only if you're up on time, Barnes."
"Okay then." And with that, Tony shuts the door on the best thing that's ever happened to him.
This was a mistake.
Bucky snorted, slinging his bag off his shoulder and walking over to sit down beside Tony at his workdesk. "What does that mean?"
"Can you two cut that out? Not even Nat and Bucky are this gross," Clint huffs, shoving meat into his mouth straight off of the grill and recoiling in pain. "Too hot, too hot."
"Yeah, if you're not going to be weird about it and embarrass me, I'll be your in-guy."
Sam comes over, dragging his desk chair to the back. "Calm down, man, it can't hurt you."
He had barely gotten through the first paragraph before he had tossed the letter; it was just some junk about coming home and things going back to the way they were, but Peter knew any possibility of things going back to normal was impossible. Too much had happened, too much had been said, and it struck him that his father could be so naive, or maybe he was just wilfully obtuse.
"Fine by us, our success rate has been a steady one hundred percent."
Bucky was usually the one to come into town, but he'd come down with a chill, and so Steve was left with doing deliveries and getting something for his best friend's illness by the town doctor.
Tony laughs, wrapping his legs around the blonde's waist. "Should I want that? I don't think we'd have much fun without it."
Hope you guys enjoy 🧡
"Nothing," Tony replies, a small smile crossing his lips. "I'm just thinking about home. I suppose absence does make the heart grow fonder."
When Tony wants to avoid his feelings, distraction is always the best to keep his mind from wandering. Except he's supposed to stay away and "break-up" with his favourite distraction, so instead he finds himself getting horrifingly drunk with Jan. Jan, who is so sweet and so nice to him, and reminds him of all the times they've hung out with Steve - who Tony still hasn't called.
Steve was always careful when unloading the produce at Thor's. While the man could live up to his name as an ex-soldier turned shopkeep, he was never a bad business partner, and would more often than not tip them with an extra bit of gold dust for their efforts.
Harley flinches and narrowly avoids groaning out loud. Stomping to the hall and ignoring the looks Pops shoots his way, he focuses on getting his hair right.
Something changes between them in that week, just a subtle change that has them being more touchy in front of the others, and not minding the jokes at their expense so much.
"Good, that's good. No one can know about this, especially not Reed."
"That's surprising coming from you, you must feel real bad about thinking I'm a whore."
"You doing okay?" Steve asks sleepily, readjusting the covers around them.
"I hope Ty here wasn't bothering you too much," Steve jokes, meeting Ty's stunned gaze with a grin. "By the way, I think Sunset's been looking for you. I saw her out by the barbeque area earlier," Steve adds, his "aw shucks" facade on full display (as Bucky would say).
The kid is a bundle of nervous energy though, his hair pointed in every direction from the way he had run his hands through them and she's almost sure he'd bite his lip right off if he didn't chill out. On a limb, she decides to just go for it.
The week that he's supposed to be spending elevating his leg, some of the men downstream hit gold. The town has an influx of young Alphas from neighbouring towns, and work at the forge seems to double, but with too little hands to manage the work, Reed sends for Sue's brother.
Peter mumbles out a "dad, she's only fourteen," at the same time Riri pauses, eyes wide and mouth slightly ajar, before quickly schooling her face into a casually blank mask.
jan can come too 🤠
Besides, it's not like your dad would even take me back...
Endgame stays the endgame, unless... haha (I'm kidding guys 😩)
And with that, Peter shoved the cell phone under the mattress, turning over to stare out at the sky. That definitely wasn't a good idea.
"Oh, that's cool," Riri says, dragging a chair from across the room to Peter's desk. While she normally hated group projects, working with someone like Peter was a godsend, at least she wasn't going to have to do it on her own or finish it the night before because her partner bailed.
Steve finishes with a little keening sound, bucking his hips up before pulling Tony off to paint his face in ribbons of white.
I'm in the hospital. Do you care?
"Because Steve doesn't think logically when he throws his heart into things. We knew that you would be reasonable in this. You get that we're not shunning you, right Tony?"
"What will you tell him about your ankle? It's pretty swollen."
"What brings you here, Barnes?"
Steve shrugs a shoulder, mixing Morgan's baby food. The kid's official favourite thing to snack on was apple and pear puree, but Steve was trying to get her to like the veggies  too (a mission he was currently failing at). "The guy is witty, I'll give him that," Steve says, pulling Morgan towards the table. "He might give you a run for your money, Babe."
-very excited for these new characters to enter 💛
"That's good then," Nat says, and at the three pairs of eyes staring at her questioningly, she explains, "Tony's been out and about with Johnny Storm, Sue's little brother."
"The pretty one with the nice ass?" she asks, her signature smirk stretching across her face easily. "I have no idea."
"Hey, kiddo. I saw your light was on and I was just about to make some hot chocolate, you want to join me? When can get a movie playing or something?"
"You're not going to burst," Thor says, dragging him inside with a hand over his mouth. "Let's play a game, okay? You be really quiet while we get Bucky and Sam."
"Shut up, Stark."
Tony scrubbed at his hands and face harshly, willing the soot and coal to come off. He couldn't dirty his room again, Madame Masque did nightly inspections of the hostel and had fined him extra for the marks his oil-stained hands had left on the dresser. He dunked hid head in the barrel, hoping to get it at least semi-clean until he could go by the bath house.
"So, I don't think it's that bad," Thor says, locking the door behind them.
Thankfully, nobody busts their doors in looking for Natasha, or breaks any bones (which was suspicious in itself), but Scott Lang and Barton do hand themselves in at an embassy in London a month later.
Just a few more minutes and he could leave. Outside, he can hear the boys laughing. They were a pack of four who stopped by every afternoon to get their tools checked over, apparently from hitting gold a few leagues down the bank. They were always full of laughter and fun when they were drunk, a happy change to the desolate and empty faces that passed through on the way to and back from rush.
"They headed into town to get the sheriff, the man sleeps like a log."
Wiping furiously at the tears that now streaked his cheeks, Harley grabs onto the back of Tony's shirt. "Yeah."
jvnetvandyne no funzies :(
"Of course it was, Steven," Tony says, playfully slapping his shoulder, "would I ever lead you astray?"
Smiling bashfully at his dad, Peter rubs the back of his neck, walking over to peck his dad and Morgan on their cheeks. "Hey dad, this is Riri. She's like insanely smart, she even created her own A.I. and won an award from the mayor of Chicago," Peter says, before blushing furiously and turning to Riri and adding apologetically, "or so I've heard... Sorry, Riri, I overheard some underclassmen say that..."
"Of course, I'd have to get the green light and speak to my lecturer about it, but I definitely think he'd be into it."
"This is not the way though, Tony, and I'm sure you know that. When an infection starts eating at your arm and you have exhausted all other options, you cut it off before it spreads, not resow the arm back on and invite it to live with you!"
"That was extra, and we told you that from the beginning," Sam says matter of factly, crossing his arms across his chest. "Besides, you weren't even good on payment."
Hi, I'm sorry that I'm terrible and haven't updated this in forever - my muse has been evading me, nd when she does visit, she demands fluffy sweet stories lol.
When Harley had brought him to dock amidst rain and a horrible cold front, Tony was uncertain whether leaving had even been the best choice. At least if he'd stayed, he'd have a roof over his head and some form of certainty over whether he'd live to see tomorrow (
The kid doesn't seem all that bothered by Ty's presence, but the look of boredom on his face has Steve suppressing a laugh. From experience, and having seen first hand 'Ty the Guy' in action, Steve knows he's probably saying something stupid and ridiculously inappropriate.
"Yes, dad?"
"Aww, when will he be back?"
"Well,
"Okay, I still don't want to have sex with you guys though."
At one moment Tony is blinking himself awake, but at the sound of Peter's panic, he's leaping out of bed and grabbing the boy before he can collapse. "Shh, Baby, it's fine, we're going to get you some help okay?" Tony tries to reassure him, sitting back in bed and drawing Peter into his arms, his ear against his chest. "Listen to my heartbeat, okay? Can you try to breathe with the beats? Let's try it."
"Now we both know there's nothing in there, Pickle," he says, grabbing a bottle out of the bottle warmer.
"Okay? That's good. How about you come sleep in my room too? We can get the sleeper couch out and get Jaime too, does that sound like a plan?"
"Someone's been hanging around Wade a lot. Should I expect any cussing soon, Cap?"
"I-" Tony starts, limping out of bed to start gathering the clothes he'd slept in and cautiously avoiding Steve's eyes, his eyes firmly placed on the floor. "Steve, I'm really sorry. I can't -
"That's the word on the street, love. You're taking the Storm boy to bed and makin' a man outta him." Nat sniffs, taking a long sip of her drink. "Which I don't understand, I myself like my men a little older, a little more refined. What do you even talk to that youngin about?"
"Hey Pete, you and Ned ever think about joining the Champions?" This was her sticking her neck out, she hoped this gamble didn't end miserably.
Thor slaps his hand away when he tries to steal a chilli fry, and Steve looks up with a withering scowl, sadly dragging himself to the coffee machine.
"Just that I fell down walking home, us Omegas can be so silly after all."
Harley does groan out loud this time. "Pops, just because you only used a bar of soap and the jawbone of a donkey to get presentable in your day, doesn't mean it works for me."
Rhodey huffs out a heavy, harsh breath, but doesn't say anything for a moment, sinking down into the couch across from Tony with effort.
After breakfast, amidst a mass of ill-timed innuendos and jokes, Bucky and Sam had conveniently found 'super important' work they'd forgotten to do, leaving Steve to show Tony around the farm.
Still, weak for a loving touch before all of this went up in his face, Tony curls around Steve's arms, cradling his leg between his own. Steve groans behind him, digging his nose into the side of his neck and blows a wet kiss there, causing Tony to giggle.
-religion 🌚
"Yeah, I brought sticky stuff. You can put it up by your bed."
@artingrogers this is my serious face
Hi, I hope you like the update, I feel like the story running off ahead of me and waiting for me to catch up 😂
Harley tries to dampen down the intensity, Peter is a good bro and the twins are evil geniuses.
On the first night, he had barricaded his door while one of the other Omegas had gone into a heat due to their proximity to rutting Alphas. Tony had had to mask his scent with paraffin, lathering his scent glands in the thick oil to throw the Alphas off.
"Dad told us never to define ourselves by our failures. They don't make us." Sam grins, hopping off the bed with his twin to shake on it.
"I gathered that."
Peter nods, rushing around the room to clear his desk and shove half-finished projects onto end tables and other surfaces. "Sorry about the mess, I like to keep busy before bed."
The Champions already had a webslinger named Spider-Man on their team; the boy had come from another dimension-slash-timeline along with another Captain Marvel, around the same time he'd taken on the alias and manifested his powers, becoming known as the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man in Queens. Peter had never met the other Spider-Man, but his dads had and confirmed it wasn't another
We don't know Riri well enough, but there's no harm in trying
I'm aorry
"She said she told them..."
"Fifty bucks they demand to see you within twenty four hours of getting here," Jess pipes up, Morgan sleeping in the cradle of her arms.
"Sure will, you be safe getting back now, Tony. Stick to the main road."
"Reed, this town only has one paved road, it'd be hard to get lost." Tony rolls his eyes, amused at Reed's mothering that had never stopped since that first day. God, he missed Rhodey.
"Then I should be thankful, my soul might still be saved with a man as virtuous as you defending it."
Tony is hesitant to leave, but his headache is pounding behind his left eye and he's not sure he
"We-I only think that maybe some time apart would do you both good. You're new here, and you git pretty serious with Steve early on. There are so many other guys an girls out there, who I'm sure are waiting for the chance to get with you."
Ty had bought his company for ten days straight, braving the rough seas with him in the cramped space of his quarters. Maybe it had been the utter despair and hopelessbess Tony was feeling, or the drunk haze he'd gotten used to being in since he started whoring himself out, but somewhere between getting roughly fucked into the mattress and sharing a sweet kiss so passionate it had him sobering up, Tony had fallen a little in love (or so he thought). Ty had a silver tongue, selling him dreams and convincing him of a future he had never even wanted. Between wet kisses he promised a cabin in the woods, built from scratch just for the two of them, and a cradle by the window for their babies.
"When we take communion, what do we drink, Mr Stark?"
Tony smirks, twirling a silky curl around his finger. "So you think my curls are cute, huh?"
Feeling his orgasm building up, Steve leans forward to kiss him, soft and slow and deliciously distracting. Tony can't think of anything else except Steve; Steve's lips pressing against his, his tongue picking into Tony's mouth, the hand he has curled around Tony's hip. He's nothing except this kiss, and this moment. The world could be ending right now and Tony wouldn't even notice.
Peter had heard uncle Rhodey and Dad talking about aunt Carol taking on and mentoring a young supe, but he never knew it was Ms Marvel.
"Okay."
While Tony had never been one to believe in God, his mama had been a Christian who had spent his formative years reading to him from the pages of her holy book. She'd never been too amused with Tony's smart mouth, even less so when he'd question her readings, and still, without fail, she'd read
"Is it your life's mission to use Omega stereotypes against everyone?"
Prince Namor tapped the table in a steady beat, unmoved. "I don't get what you're saying."
Looking embarrassed by the praise (or probably freaked out by Peter's babbling), Riri scuffs her shoe against the wood floor staring determinedly at her untied laces. "Uh, no worries, Peter, I'm sure everyone knows by now, you know it's physically impossible for Kate to keep juicy gossip quiet," she jokes. "My dad signed me up for a 'Young Innovators' competition, and I guess they liked what I did," she supplies, eyes not lifting from the floor.

@artingrogers @ArtDecider some truths are universally known PC 🙈
Smiling coyly at the man, Nat pulls away from Bucky, a small hand rubbing at his shoulders. "Who doesn't enjoy dinner and entertainment, Mr LeBeau?"
"I'm sorry, Jan, I didn't see you past Tony's big head."
"Well, I almost got kicked out of a lecture yesterday, and my chemical engineering lecturer is totally useless, so there's that," Tony supplies, waving animatedly at someone who calls out to him. "I didn't know Janet came to things like this."
Of course, it matters. It’s the only goddamn thing that ever matters.
hair, when Steve and Rhodey are unavailable and Tony is lacking for human connection. Sometimes, Steve thinks that she enjoys it just as much as Tony does and he can’t blame her. Tony’s hair is so soft, slipping through his fingers and sliding against his palm like little trickles of silk.
“You’re a shit liar.”
“We’re not perfect people.” Tony tugs at Steve’s wrist, dragging him back down until Steve’s face is hovering over his own.
He closed his eyes and drew a breath, fumbling for a hand on the doorknob to throw the door open. “Tony I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Please believe me. I love you!”
“You weren’t just the first, Tony.” Steve hadn’t missed the note of self-deprecation under the Omega’s words or the way that the caramel scent burnt around the edges. “I mean, of course you were the first O, but it was so much more than that. You know that.”
“Some idiot wizard turned up today and said that Independence Day is on the horizon, and apparently that’s enough for Ross and the WSC to look the other way. All hands-on deck. I’m arranging your flights now, and FRIDAY is encrypting your pardon documents. They should be arriving on T’Challa’s private server as we speak.”
“Are you going to come back or not?”
“Not like you to forget.” Tony smirks and Steve shoots him an exasperated look. “Don’t worry, I’ve been told that I can be very distracting.”
“Good one,” Tony snarks. “But really, Steve. You can be whatever part of you you’d like.”
That one had come in not long after their run-in in the hallway. It’s been sitting there, unopened and unanswered with all the rest, for more than a few hours.
Rhodey wraps him in a tight squeeze and guides him over to the table. Tony sits down with his family and eats his dinner the way he’s supposed to, a smile plastered on his face as Rhodey enlightens him on what he’s missed and demands new perks be added into his braces. Like being able to shoot missiles. Because Rhodey needs things like that.
One eye of the mask dilates in a cheeky wink and Tony cheers him on from the sidelines.
Bucky wasn’t particularly familiar with bonding. Hell, he wasn’t even sure if he was capable of bonding, his glands a mottled mess at his throat and destroyed entirely at his left wrist. But from what he did know, bonds drifted apart slowly if not properly tended. Or snapped closed if either of the pair attempted to bond with another.
Tony leaning into him feels like permission granted and his heartbeat picks up in his chest.
The barely restrained anger surfaces and starts to show its face—funny, and here Tony was thinking it was Bruce who was always angry—and Tony wonders whether or not it’s the sheer force of the super-soldier serum containing it.
A chill rushed through him and just for a moment, his mind whispered a hateful tale.
It’s the final straw, because Steve is only a man; a man in love and if Tony will have him like this, if Tony will wrap him in soft, sweet touches and whispered words, why would Steve deny himself?
“Aw, he’s just playing around Stevie. Don’t get your panties in a twist. Speaking of which, Tony was just telling me about that pretty red number he got you last week.”
It seemed too soon by Tony’s standard but Steve moaned low in his chest, an encouraging sound, when Bucky pressed into him from behind, jostling Steve forward and deeper into Tony. Bucky set a hard pace, hands on Steve’s trim waist as he’s rocked forward and back between Bucky’s cock and Tony’s weeping hole.
Tony grins at him, knowing and just the slightest little bit smug. “Yeah, that’s what I thought. Hold on, big guy.”
“Don’t fucking say it! Don’t you fucking say it, Steve.” Blood roared in his ears, and adrenaline raced through his body like he was mainlining amphetamines, every nerve ending alive with panic and fear. Steve would tell him to let him go. Tony would
Tony bites down on one of Steve’s nipples and another exclamation escapes him.
All the while, Steve never stops rolling his hips. Never stops slipping in and out of Tony’s body, caressing him from the inside out as if he can chase away the grief with pleasure. It’s bittersweet, the slick slide of Steve in his ass even as his heart is cracking all over again.
“I –”
“This—this is what you wanted, right? Is this—” Tony frowns at him. “Yeah, I might need just a little talking. Help me out, is this what you want?”
“You are so beautiful,” Steve whispers, one arm tucked around his waist to keep him steady while the other traces patterns over his ribs, sliding higher to brush light fingertips across Tony’s nipples and make him squirm.
“Oh my god.” Tony pushed out of Steve’s arms and rolled his eyes. He stumbled to his feet and came to a stop right in front of Bucky, so close he had to tip his head back to look up at him. “I told him that you stare. That you think about us. But he doesn’t believe me.”
“Dinner started a few minutes ago. Aren’t you coming to join us?”
The curry Steve had prepared for dinner was mostly gone, the massive bowl empty in the centre of the table. It was framed with a basket of samosas he had folded himself and another of delicate naan. He’d only burnt the first two, and Thor had devoured them eagerly, proclaiming their charred exteriors a delicacy.
Steve seems to consider that for a moment, rolling Tony’s words around in his mind and translating them into a language that suits him best.
For Steve, rebuilding that bridge with Tony had been all fiery shouting matches, eventually burning low into heated discussions and sharp comments. When distrusting glares gave way into uncertainty, Steve hadn’t missed his opportunity and everything had exploded again, with Tony’s legs wrapped around Steve’s waist and his tongue halfway down Steve’s throat.
Some of them may be fuzzier than others, with that sheen of uncertainty at the edges, but that doesn’t make them any less real. Not to Steve.
“Kinda busy here, Cap.” Tony snapped from where he was bent over a selection of various materials. Stretchy fabrics for Bruce’s pants, his brain supplied.
Tony means to unmake him and Steve will let him.
They’re plastered together chest to back, sweat dripping between them and Steve gasps, moans, damn well near cries.
This is going to be the exact same trap Tony keeps falling into over and over again.
There’s no reason to concern himself with what Steve Rogers is doing, though he still picks up the occasional breadcrumbs from the news on the off chance he’s home to catch it.
They wander back up to the communal space, leaving Tony to a project he absently had claimed to stay and focus on. The second they’re gone he drops into a nearby chair and gives DUM-E a helpless look.
“I’ll stop,” Steve says. “I’ll be more careful.”
Natasha lets her head tilt to the side and gives him an even look. “I was angry, Tony. I misjudged you on what I chose to see, ignoring the rest. And I was wrong.”
Clint mutters something else that Tony doesn’t catch, but by the way Peter’s cheeks darken into tomato red, he’s safe to assume it was unsavoury.
It hadn’t been a big concern – they had an eclectic mixture of family and Steve wasn’t even sure if he could have children after the serum. Bucky hadn’t brought it up outright, but had shared similar sentiments in passing. If anything, they’d expand their family in other ways if it came up.
Tony bursts into surprised laughter behind them, and Steve flicks a glare at him over Bucky’s shoulder. “Really? How did you even manage to tell him that already?”
Steve realizes a beat later that the screaming is him.
He can’t find the right words, shaking his head helplessly.
“So, we’re not going to be those people. I’m going to get dressed and walk out that door and it’s over. Done. It has to be.”
“Drop it. There’s nothing to talk about.”
There it is.
Sam plummets to the ground under Steve’s weight, his wings digging into Steve’s shins as he struggles to stay balanced before Steve rips the shield from his hands and rolls back down onto the mats. Sam wobbles in the air, trying to stay upright.
He blinks rapidly, over and over again, thinking that this Steve will disappear any second now. Except he draws closer every time Tony opens his eyes and it sounds like Steve is calling his name.
“We really want the physical stuff though.” Tony assured him quickly.
Nothing will ever feel
Steve swallows hard, gritting his teeth. Tony’s goading him, he’s petty and vindictive and he wants to break Steve down into pieces as some sort of deranged retribution for Siberia. Steve knows it.
“Captain Rogers,” FRIDAY says his name with a disdain Tony wasn’t sure AI’s were even capable of, “is currently on the B.A.R.F. floor. He is presently using the software to–”
Tony groaned, whimpered as a light smack of redirection landed on his ass. It was hot, despite the cool metal of Bucky’s fingers.
“You called me here, you know. Something in this crazy universe thought the first thing you needed to see when you came here was some handsome genius.”
When Steve saw Tony again months later, he was emaciated and half-dead on his feet. For a brief moment, Steve felt a glimmer of hope because Tony had come shuffling off the spaceship and stumbled down into his arms.
Bucky nods, slowly. “Thanks, I’ll, uh, think about it I guess.”
“I knew you would, Hawkass. You’re two sarcastic peas in a pod.”
“Tell us yours, Stark,” Wanda draws his attention, drinking from a can of pop that Tony doesn’t recognize, realizing that it’s in another language. Sokovian maybe. He wonders if she’ll share one, later.
“What if I’m
Steve rubs his nose against Tony’s, lips brushing against his too limp to be considered a kiss. Tony offers him a real one, letting his tongue gently slide along Steve’s bottom lip in an intimate caress.
Odin knows, Tony is.
over.
“I didn’t think you were reading them.”
eviscerate them both. Amazing how it only takes ninety days to end something Tony spent months planning for. Something he spent years enjoying and forgetting to savour.
There is really only so much one man can bear, right?
“Cake.”
“I thought you said you didn’t want to fight, Tony.”
Tony narrows his eyes. “This feels scripted. It’s a trap. You don’t really mean it. Who are you and where is Steve Rogers?”
“Would it really be so terrible if you had to stay like this?” Tony asks and Steve blinks, taken aback.
given that to Tony again after all this time.
“Sleep now,” Steve breaths into his ear. “I’ll be here when you wake up.”
“Not that it matters,” he said slowly, teasing, “but nothing would make me happier.”
It was good to have Bucky there, that friendship deep and renewed yet somehow different. It wasn’t that Steve hadn’t thought about what had been there before. But things had changed, and Bucky had changed too.
He was lying on his stomach, face turned away from the window in a wild sprawl across the sheets. Like an octopus, Tony had gathered the blankets and pillows into his arms, clutching them in his sleep and Steve’s chest twinged with a familiar ache when he realized all the pillows Tony had wrapped himself around were from Steve’s side of the bed.
“Ehh, I like to keep him on his toes. Oh, don’t get your panties in a bunch Cap, he’s going to be fine. Just let him cool off for a bit. Make him some fucking wagon wheels.”
“Me too.” Steve admits. “But you still want to? Talk, I mean, see if we can start to figure some of this out?”
“No, I’m sorry.”
Tony gives him a look. “Sure, whatever you say, Cap.”
A sixth text buzzes through as he’s sitting at his desk, halfway through his third glass of scotch because if there’s something Tony Stark knows how to do right, it’s a relapse. And he’ll be damned if he doesn’t deserve it after everything else.
“What did you just say?”
“Tony—”
. “There’s another way. Goddamnit, JARVIS, where are we on that SOS?”
And just like that, Steve started cooking for the team at least four or five times a week.
Steve will spend the rest of his life working to deserve Tony, he knows. But he’ll spend the rest of his life working to deserve all of them. His friends. His family.
Tony needs him to go before he does something he regrets.
I thought maybe one day you’d just listen.”
Stark Industries’ idea, of course, and Steve had approved.
“They’re not.”
“You need to shave.”
Steve takes a shuddering breath and starts to tug at the wires.
Before the anxiety subsides, he stiffens up when Barnes’ soft, Brooklyn drawl reaches out to him.
Tony is silent for a long time and when Steve looks up, his face is sad. It feels like they’re having two different conversations and when Tony clears his throat, shoulders ticking up stiffly, dread runs down Steve’s spine like an ice bath. Before Tony even opens his mouth, Steve’s breath catches and he starts to consider that the uncertainty he’s been feeling speaks to something more than he’d originally anticipated.
Bucky could hear Tony clear as day through the line. Damned super hearing. He’d made a move to shift away and Steve pinned him with a glare that made him pause.
Which absolutely wasn’t true, as the robot rolled forward towards an offering of a small Lego set of DUM-E himself, an equally miniature Iron Man blasting off beside him. The robot chirped, rotating his claw in Tony’s direction.
“Care to explain?” Natasha asks, but the jig is already up.
“Tony,” Steve says softly, crossing the room and wrapping his arms around him. Tony goes like a ragdoll, pulled into Steve’s embrace. He kisses the sweaty hair under Tony’s ear. “You’re already my family. But if you want to add kids to that equation one day, I’m not going to say no.”
“What if something happens? To us. To
“Absolutely not.”
“He’s fucking with you, Viz.” Sam puts in, and the smile slips away. That’s probably what JARVIS’ disapproval would have looked like if brought to life. If JARVIS had a face.
That’s all it takes for Tony. He arches up underneath Steve, hips slamming into his ass until Steve can feel every jerk and jolt of Tony’s cock, filling him with a wet heat that makes his own cock twitch again with renewed interest. It’s too soon but he clenches down anyways, pleasure bordering on too much, just to hear Tony gasp and drive up into him again.
Steve presses his cheek into Tony’s palm. “Tony?”
He’s exhausted, raw and painfully open in more ways than one.
“Yeah. A whole year.”
“Something isn’t right.” Tony shakes his head, giving him a questioning look. “Something doesn’t feel right, Steve. I can’t put my finger on it. It’s almost like we’re not supposed to be here. Like you’re—”
“Maybe, or maybe your swiss cheese brain has been forgetting to put our laundry back in the right place. Even DUM-E could do a better job than you do.” Tony dug his fork into the decadent chocolate cake Steve had whipped up for the bot and cocked a brow.
Clint gives him a look, passing them in the foyer, but Steve shakes his head, tucking Tony closer against his chest and leading him up the stairs. As he settles him onto bed, Tony lets Steve curl around him. He feels small and vulnerable, relaxing in small increments as Steve waits, stroking soft fingers up and down his ribcage.
“Can’t or don’t want to?”
“So, tell whoever is running it to shut it down?” Tony suggests, because it’s that obvious and he can’t understand why FRIDAY hasn’t done that already. She remains eerily quiet and something strange turns over in the bottom of Tony’s stomach. “FRI? Patch me through to whoever is running the session.”
“Don’t, please don’t.” Tony begs, closing his eyes and resisting the urge to cover himself. “Steve, please.
Steve flushes, licking his lips as another bolt of arousal rushes south. His cock twitches in Tony’s grip, and Tony waggles his eyebrows at him, sucking him back down and pointedly pushing Steve’s hand down on his hair.
It’s genuinely hard to tell which pisses him off more. That Ross would imply that Steve was little more than some meaningless, dirty, throw away romp in the sheets, or the fact that he’s so quick to overlook the blatant disregard for international law, the destruction of Leipzig, and, oh right, how Steve had beaten him half to death in Siberia.
For a brief moment it almost looks as if Tony believes him.
DUM-E rolled towards Steve, knocking the edge of his chair as he rotated his claw into his lap, like a dog waiting for scratches.
“You own it and I respond or I don’t, whatever your mind decides is enough. So, all the other memories change because the rational side of you already know that if you had done all those things, there would have been different results.”
“Absolutely.”
Bucky clings to him just as tightly.
Steve loves him, and tells him, whatever form that may take.
The hard-won ground that Ross has managed to hold onto is slipping away right before Tony’s eyes. Whispers of addendums and rewrites and complete overhauls have been ongoing over the past few weeks, at least. Tony isn’t privy to all the private conversations that are being had behind closed doors.
There’s a brief pause.
A chill washes down Tony’s spine and he resists the urge to shiver, walking over to the window as he tugs his shirt on over his head. The skyline is alive and vibrant with the sprinkle of lights from the other high rises and Tony searches the horizon. The
“I was trying to figure out a way to have it all because I didn’t want to lose everything again. I didn’t want to lose you over Bucky, and I didn’t want to lose him over us. So, I told myself a couple of small lies that snowballed into bigger ones and the deeper I got the harder it was going to be to come out.” Steve’s voice cracks and he clears his throat. “I don’t know when but at some point, I realized that I was going to lose you if I said anything so I just… never did.”
Tony stops listening because Peter’s jumped right into a whole slew of potential solutions. He settles across from Nat at the dinner table, eyes flicking back and forth to the door, watching for Steve.
Comments are much loved, let me know what you think!
After Bucky had fallen, Steve had been alone in his grief.
Bucky gave him a doubtful look, but it parted and cleared, sun coming through the clouds as Bucky nudged him back down, bracketing him in with his elbows and folding Tony in half.
Arrogant. Self-centered. All the other negative words Tony can’t fully think of right now.
“It’s like this, okay,” Tony starts, and he knows this might not go over well, but, “I had this memory of the last time I saw my parents alive I couldn’t get past. I tried not to remember it for the better part of a few decades. But B.A.R.F. allowed me to replay it over and over again until I was able to make it into something else. Actually, say goodbye to them, tell them how I felt, you know?”
If he closed his eyes, Tony was there with him, propped at the edge of his bed, eyes dark and hooded with desire. The shame curled into arousal and a sharp twist of tension wound deep in Steve’s belly. How many times had he pictured those eyes on him, watching him, while Tony dragged his bottom lip between his teeth and gave a little twitch of his eyebrows? A silent,
But Steve doesn’t apologize. He never apologizes, Tony has come to realize. The disappointment is just as sharp.
It’s hard to feel bad for him though, Tony still sporting a glossy pink scar across the breadth of his chest.
“Get the fuck off me.” He spits between gasps, desperate to get himself under control. “I’m fine.”
It’s been weeks now, and nothing comes to mind. He finishes errant projects, developing a series of new plans for upgrades for the Avengers, and revisiting where things are at in clean energy these days. Tony can’t help but feel that all of these things are simple fillers, activities he gives himself to pass the time while he does nothing at all.
Maybe it will stay until he wakes.
Barnes blinks and says nothing, not that Tony is paying anymore attention. He’s digging his fingers into Peter’s shoulder, feeling that the kid is trembling, and steering him into the elevator.
Steve would come like a rocket, pumping streak after delicious streak into Tony’s body as he leaked slick over his thighs, trickling down both their legs. Bucky’s name tumbling from both their lips until Steve’s own throat was raw with it.
Steve grins, leaning over to press a kiss between his shoulder blades before driving his fingers down hard, right into the spot inside him that lights Tony up from the inside out. His husband—his
, Tony thinks, as Sam’s voice chases them down the hallway. But what he would pay to see the look on Steve’s face when one of his own challenges him.
“They are, but that doesn’t mean they have to be important to you. You don’t need to read them if you don’t want to, Tony. We’ve moved on. I know that.”
Bucky fishes his phone out of his pocket and brings it to his ear. Steve tries to ignore him, fixing his gaze on the mess of broken glass. He can’t look at Bucky, and he can’t look at the photo of Tony and the perfect family Steve never had with him.
“I didn’t suck on your fingers!”
“Sounds that way.” Wanda smirks at him, looking younger in that moment. She’s so different than the woman he’d visited in the Raft a few months ago. Being here has been difficult for her, too, and Tony can appreciate the effort she’s putting in.
Below them, the water crashed in high swells, ravaging over each other as they reached up to greet the storm rolling in from the east. The once blue waves churned like the nausea in Tony’s stomach, where Death called like a siren and Steve was racing headlong into a decision to steer their ship towards her wreckage.
Tony’s not thinking rationally. He’s going to regret this. He knows that it’s not the right thing to say but he’s going to say it anyway because maybe Steve deserves to hurt, at least something close to what he suffers with. Maybe Steve deserves to ache with it, too.
“How was that, Cap?” Tony pops the faceplate up, and Steve grabs him, hauling him in and kissing him stupid.
“Stark!” Ross sounds every inch the bulldog, so Tony rotates his chair in a slow, lazy arc. He keeps his posture loose and at ease. Roguish nonchalance, Pepper had called it once.
“J.A.R.V.I.S.?” Steve calls out, blinking away sleep.
So he had heard him correctly.
He’ll hear Steve out fully first.
“If only it was that easy, sour patch.” Tony sighs heavily, the caffeine giving him just enough energy to shuffle over and refill his cup. He leans against the counter, and starts a new pot.
Steve claws back a whimper as Tony breaches him with a finger, pressing all the way in. “Is that what this is about? You want to get me back at me?”
They might be able to bring them all back. Morgan would have her uncles. A brother in Peter, even. But if they fail, they’ll lose everything. Steve will lose everything. This perfect little family they’ve created in the face of destruction, reduced to ashes.
“No catch, Tony.”
The doors open and once they're in a private space, the walls come down and Tony turns to Steve with a tentative, curious look. “Would you want that?”
DUM-E doesn’t buy it, trundling over to him on his little wheels and trying to give him a sharp prod with his claw. Tony smacks him away with a hand, light, against his long strut where it meets the claw.
“I’m a man who wasted a lot of time, Tony. I hope I get enough to make it all up to you.”
He had worked so hard, and made it through so much, without a single drop. Everyone else was allowed to make mistakes. Hell, she’d followed a man that had beaten the shit out of him without blinking an eye, but
They both know it’s a lie, but this time Bucky doesn’t call him on it. When Bucky doesn’t respond, Steve closes his eyes, turning as far away as he can.
“Fine, you’re right. I’m wrong. Clearly, I’m mistaken.” Steve back peddles quickly, offering a non-apology that’s all placation and stokes the fires of disdain in Tony’s belly.
Tony never gets to hear what Steve might have said, because the memory switches on them, fading to black and offering up something new.
He hammers until he’s exhausted and seeing triples, stumbling half-asleep into the safety of his bed late into the evening.
Tony frowns because it sounded right in his head, but his stomach is screaming that it’s a lie. They could have done this before, at any point. Hell, he had tried to talk to Steve, more than once, before everything fell to pieces.
It wasn’t Tony’s fault that it was all too easy to make Ross look the fool.
Tony sighs. He pulls his hands back from Steve’s face. Everything feels cold and sticky as Tony shifts his weight off the couch and Steve watches as he pulls on his clothes. Across the room, Tony retrieves a small, sealed bag from the desk and tosses it onto the sofa at Steve’s side.
Steve isn’t quite sure he’d want everyone to watch, even if he can appreciate how possessiveness turns into searing arousal when his teammates take in the bruises he leaves at Tony’s wrists or scattered across his throat. But it doesn’t hurt, playing into Tony’s secret desires with the fight all but over, and an endless stretch of time before them to settle up on said promises later.
Rhodey’s posturing brings a fresh wave of guilt because assumptions will be made about Rhodey’s loyalties and ability to remain impartial. That’ll eventually be blamed on Tony too, but it’s more than that. It’s unfair to Steve and even though Tony’s shouldered his fair share of resentment for the good Captain, Tony doesn’t want to see the guy emotionally destroyed
“It’s me, sweetheart, it’s me.” The endearment slips out, unbidden. “I’ve got you, okay? It’s okay. What the fuck were you thinking, you gigantic idiot?”
“Anything.”
“Later,” Tony says. “We’ll sort everything out later.”
“Tony—” Steve chokes, blinking away the tears. He can’t lose him on the table. He can’t. It isn’t even worth it. Tony could keep on living with the arc reactor, and he’s taking a risk—
Rhodey had teased him mercilessly when he’d found out that Tony had jumped on the whole self-care bandwagon. Until Tony deadpanned that his therapist had thought it was a good idea, and Rhodey had balked.
“Tony, won’t you even look at me?”
“Tell him there ain’t no us either.” Bucky offered. “And that it’s goats. Not sheep.”
“It’s not just you, honey.” Tony makes a little space between them, pushing the arc reactor up so it sits on the mattress between their shoulders. Tony’s gentle smile is alight, shadows dancing in the hollows of his throat.
want to stay like this?”
And okay, that’s true, Tony hasn’t told the kid everything. The bare minimum really. Need to know basis only, Ross had said after all. Plus, the kid had been so fired up just hearing that the other Avengers were coming back, Tony hadn’t had the heart to tell him much more.
“You gotta stop disappearing on me, Buck.”
He’s cornered him and stepped into his space and flat out refused to listen every time Tony’s given him a warning to back off. In fact, he can’t think of a single moment where Steve has stopped himself solely for the sake of respecting Tony’s wishes.
When the door clicks shut signaling that Steve is finally gone, Tony pulls off the rest of his disheveled clothing and curls onto his side. The tears come hot and heavy and Tony sobs like he hasn’t sobbed since he woke up, in pain and alone, after Siberia.
Steve has to find him.
Steve turns his face just so and presses a kiss into Tony’s palm, chasing his pulse south and kissing the inside of his wrist. He leans over Tony and hesitates, searching Tony’s eyes with his own, before he closes the rest of the space between them and kisses him.
“You have a hunch? What if you’re wrong?”
. Tony tries repeating Pepper’s words to his cracked, chipped heart but it can’t hear him. Even in the
“Just tell me I’m right, Steve. Tell me I’m right and I’ll help you. Give it up. You miscalculated. You’re flawed. Breakable.
He falls hard to his knees, gasping as he pitches out of the chair. He’s been sitting long enough that when the glasses are ripped off his face, nausea bubbles up and the abrupt bright lights blind him.
Most days he lost.
“It was just a dream,” Steve says again, feeling less certain even as the words leave his lips.
He doesn’t want to lose him. Not like this. Not when they’re angry and hurting and taking it out on each other.
It’s not enough for Tony to start liking the asshole.
It picks up on the fourth ring, and for a second Tony can see Steve in his mind’s eye, on the other end of the phone. He’d be all wide blue eyes, riddled with disbelief and probably more than a touch of hopefulness. The identical twin to his burner would be dwarfed in Steve’s massive hand.
He puts a heavy hand on Steve’s shoulder as he passes and Steve watches him go, still dumbfounded. He’s not used to losing time, if that’s what this is, and when he tries to remember saying goodbye to their teammates, he can’t.
“Someone would have to run him through the sequencing. He can’t use the software alone.” Tony muses aloud. “Would you run it for him? I don’t think he’d be comfortable with me doing it.”
“You’re on.” Peter shoves a hand at Sam first, then Clint, and Tony’s just sitting there rolling his eyes.
Steve reeled backwards, everything in him trying to reject the weight of what Tony had said. What he meant. What he was
He’s raw and open all over again, vulnerable in a way that he realizes he’s invested no matter what, and the answer is meaningless at this point because tonight he’ll go back to the Coast, and Steve will put one foot in front of another until he either pushes on or transforms into something else.
“Sir—”
No, Tony thinks. Steve would never.
The elevator bell goes off and Phil steps out. “One last mission report, Captain?”
The sound of skin sliding against the glass is an obscene melody in his ears, accentuated by the pianissimo of Steve’s desperate, little gasps. As Steve drops his head to bite down on his shoulder, Tony jolts forward, stomach pitching as he almost collides against the cold glass.
“Don’t,” Tony snaps without looking up, hands curling into fists at his sides. “Just—I can’t think right now. Everything is so fucked up, and I need a break, okay Steve. From all of this. I just need a minute and then you can shout at me all you like.”
It feels like if he doesn’t, he’s risking something more than he’s willing to bear.
The vacations they’ve gifted Rhodes and Pepper, and Bucky and Natasha won’t ever be enough. All these people, holding them together. Steve will never be able to thank them the way they deserve.
God, he wants to take him upstairs and spend the rest of the night taking him apart. It would be all too easy to strip them both down to their frames and start again.
He hobbles into the elevator. “The workshop please, J.A.R.V.I.S.”
He dove back in and Tony’s eyes fluttered up to meet Steve’s, who rewarded him with an equally dark look and kissed him hard, all tongue, before he spread him wider, stretching him further than Tony thought he’d go.
“You’re being cruel, Tony.”
“Come on, Happy and Pepper are waiting downstairs. They’re going to want to see you in your suit.” Tony claps a hand down on his shoulder, steering him away from the rest of them, away from Steve. Away from all of the conflict and the fighting.
They’d told him Captain America wouldn’t age, that Steve would be trapped in a cage of his own making while his loved ones grew old and died around him. Something about his journey into the past had changed everything. He hadn’t been prepared to step out of the portal and be an old man, but an odd sense of relief had followed soon after.
“Tony, come on.”
“I don’t– no that’s not–”
“Tony yes, yes, I–”
.” Tony licks his lips and swallows hard, tugging on the back of Steve’s hair until he gets with the picture and bursts into motion, throwing the blankets off and tugging Tony’s boxers down as he goes so his prick slaps back against his stomach with an obscene smack.
“Brace for impact, Sir!” JARVIS called through the ringing in his ears. Everything was numb. The world was spinning. Steve was unconscious, hanging from his grip, slack and still enough to be lifeless.
“Tony, please.”
Tony blinked back, waiting. Hesitating.
Steve comes with a shout, threading his fingers through Tony’s to hold him as close as he can. For that brief moment, they’re one again. Steve’s whole and nothing hurts.
Tony doesn’t whisper how he wants Steve to make love to him, possess him until Tony feels raw and home again. He kisses the unspoken words into Steve’s mouth and rolls against him harder, trying to spur him on.
Tony’s face is pale and streaked with blood, head limp against the back of the suit where it cradles him so gently amidst the sheer violence of the scene. His eyes are open, staring unfixed beyond Steve’s shoulder so Steve reaches over with trembling fingers and gently shuts them, trailing his index finger down to run along the set curve of Tony’s mouth. His beautiful, perfect mouth.
“He would’ve loved you, you know.” Steve’s not an idiot. When the curtain of confusion parts, and he has both feet on solid ground, Steve knows how much of all of this was real. “I wasn’t always so sure, but I think I know that now.”
“We wouldn’t be here if there were anyone else,” Scott cuts in. He’s twitchy and awkward. It makes Steve grit his teeth and shove his hands into his pockets, going for an air of casual he doesn’t feel. He shoots a sharp look at Morgan when she appears back in the doorway, and she scampers into the house.
“Tony!”
. Together, they were supposed to overcome everything.
He purposely doesn’t comment on Steve.
When Pepper excuses herself to the bathroom, Steve approaches him.
“Are you happy, Steve?”
A battle rages between them, as Steve opens and shuts his mouth a few times, finds words and sets them aside. Tony braces himself for the push, the pleading or the cajoling, but it doesn’t come. Steve just looks deflated, a hot air balloon slowing tumbling down from the sky and finally coming to a rest.
Tony sighs and runs a hand through his hair. “You’re too good to me.”
“What more do you want me to say?”
“Drop the bell, and this all stops,” Tony challenges, curling his fingers deeper. A third finger pushes into him and Steve gasps, toes curling with pleasure, with humiliation.
“Kiss me.” It’s another one of those damned demands but he’d be a fool to ignore it.
Tony will be long gone. Alone, hardly a drop of ink in the epic biography of Steven G. Rogers.
Tony shoots him a lazy, almost giddy smile because he’s drunk on Steve now. Of course, he is. He’s an addict who's just had his first fix in forever.
“What is this Fourth of July?” Thor boomed and Clint winced, dialing down his hearing aids.
It wasn’t long before dinner and dessert were being cleared away, dragging Steve’s attention back to the party. Tony was rolling his eyes, begrudgingly agreeing that it was present time as the team offered up various gifts, selected special for DUM-E.
“Ours?” Bucky echoed, thumb stroking light over the inside of his wrist. Tony broke away from Steve’s kiss and leaned down to offer one to Bucky, nipping at his bottom lip the way Tony knew he liked best. A little pain to accentuate the pleasure.
The letters, he thinks with desperation. He hasn’t had a chance to read them. If he had known, he would have read them, just for the closure. Just to know. It’s not fair that he should die without getting a chance to read them.
Daydreams of Tony telling him how delicious his gnocchi turned out, pulling him down for a kiss, danced behind his eyes. Or maybe he’d make him cannoli and Tony would whisper some filthy joke in his ear about the creamy texture, making him flush, hot breath tickling his ear.
There’s no hurry, no desperate flurry to race against the clock. Steve sucks marks into Tony’s neck, working his way down to his collarbone. “I dream about you every night. Only you. Always you. Then I wake up alone and I wait all day to see you again.”
Tony frowns, slightly. “You… you did?”
Now, Steve shucks his clothes slowly. His arms feel like dead weight, going through the motions to pull his shirt over his head and unbutton his jeans. He makes his way over to the solitary dresser against the far wall and digs around in his sock drawer until his fingers touch metal. Even in the time he was away, Tony had never moved it and now, Steve cherishes the old arc reactor like a precious gift. Sometime soon he’ll need to find a better hiding place for this.
The entire ordeal had left him with the same empty, hollow feeling; as if someone had dug out everything inside of him that once held meaning and left him a gutted frame of the man he’d been before. That’s what Steve was now. Empty and alone.
“Of course, Captain. You can find him down in the workshop. Should I notify Sir that you are on your way down?”
Steve’s told him about Barnes after the debacle on the helicarriers, but this is the first time Tony’s caught a glimpse of him.
Steve’s lip quirks, but he doesn’t actually smile.
Barnes has somehow picked up on the fact that he subtly favours his right. Even Rogers had never noticed that, the famed tactician that he was. The Winter Soldier is perceptive and it’s terrifying.
that you’re being an asshole and you’re going to ruin everything. Stop telling everyone how to live their lives. Stop goddamn pushing. If Barnes doesn’t want to go, don’t make him go. If Barnes doesn’t want to be an Avengers, he doesn’t need to be a fucking Avenger. You may be the Captain but you’re not God, Steve!”
Clint’s face is dissolving into a grin, and Bruce is peering over his glasses with humour in his eyes. Thor looks about ready to tackle them both to the ground, vibrating halfway out of his civilian clothing.
There’s no sensation left there these days. That’s different, startling Tony for a moment as the warmth of Steve’s kisses are lost on the new, smooth scar tissue. He swallows, the intimacy suddenly making it harder to breath and Tony can feel himself preparing to slip out of his own skin and flee.
Their every sensation, layered over each other and bursting like fireworks, fading and glowing renewed before the last had fully disappeared.
Tony shoves the seat back and springs to his feet, still bowed over Steve, careful not to break the constant flurry of kisses he’s pressing against Steve’s lips before he finally pulls back, eyes blown and breathing fast.
“Steve,” Tony whispers and he realizes his attention has strayed.
What would Tony whisper to him? Something sweet this time. Tony would want to take things slow, to savour and enjoy. They’d just saved the world after all, and after the frantic passion had been sated there would be time for love and deep, desperate desire.
It’s always been Bucky.
Bucky grunted, frustrated. “Can I bring the goats?”
“What else am I supposed to think?” Tony waves a helpless arm between them.
“Yeah,” He whispers. “When you said that you loved me.”
With the same quiet, even voice, Tony says again, “I’m sorry.”
“Why don’t you throw on that super old movie, you know the one. A New Hope,” Tony teases from the kitchen island, sodas in hand as he tosses one towards the couch just to watch Peter’s reflexes as he shoves upward and off the sofa to pull the can out of the air.
“Suit integrity 38%.” Water was gushing into the armour now, bogging them down and slowing the ascent to the surface. The sensation in Tony’s fingers was fading fast and he could feel the thrusters in the boots struggling under their combined weight along with the pressure of the water surrounding them.
DUM-E whirrs at him unhelpfully, spinning his claw.
Steve sighed, and carefully glanced up to meet Bucky’s eye. “Tony has this idea… that you might, that maybe you’d want. He thinks that–”
Steve doesn’t let him get anywhere near it, dipping and weaving through the battle. Aliens drop around him, but he knows what’s coming if he fails. He knocks Tony aside with the shield, and for a brief moment, he thinks Tony might blast him. The mask hides his expression, but Steve can hear him shouting inside the armour. He can practically see the ferocious flames in his eyes.
Steve blinks.
When the man wasn’t driving him up the wall, he was driving him half-wild with flirty comments that seemed to increase daily. They seemed to get worse around the time Steve noticed Tony’s eyes flickering over his ass when he walked by and the way he seemed to find more and more reasons to reach out and touch him these days.
Steve paused in his work, shaking out a cramp in his hand and nudging at Bucky with his foot, who glanced up at him. Scenting him lightly, Steve reached out with bliss and love and family, smirking as he nodded towards the cooling coffee cup.
“Steve–” Tony chokes on it.
If it wasn’t for the little hitch that Tony catches, a delayed reaction he doesn’t register until Steve’s already moved on, he would have thought his words had had no effect at all.
Natasha’s eyes flash. “Don’t play stupid.”
It’s light and teasing, but there’s so much more than that and they both know it. That’s not why Tony is here at all. Tony has always been home. It doesn’t take a lot of thought to know that this makes sense.
“What are you so afraid of, huh? That someone’s going to say something you disagree with? That you’re going to say or do the wrong thing? Look at me, I’m a walking tornado of mistakes and I’m still here. Nothing wrong with admitting you made a mistake and trying to do better next time.”
Tony sighs, long-suffering before he slumps back against the couch. “You, my love, need to relax.”
“It’s not good,” Bucky is saying. “I think Pepper is going to need to come down here—I know she doesn’t want to come, damn it, but he’s not—I’ve tried, Jim. You don’t think I haven’t tried that? I need her to issue the override code. She’s the only one that can shut it down—you haven’t seen him. You don’t know how bad it’s gotten.” Steve shivers, drawing the blankets around his shoulders.
Famous last words.
“What?”
“I’ve been working on cars like these since before you were even a twinge in Howard’s balls, so why don’t you listen for a damn minute and I’ll—”
“And you’re… you’re okay with that?” Tony had prodded gently, the question posed with a little more
“Can I kiss you again?” But his lips already pecking across his forehead, his temple, his cheek.
But Steve’s been setting aside the issue of their relationships for months and he’s not surprised that asking for Tony’s help today means he’s going to have to step into the limelight and face the music.
This wasn’t… he hadn’t…
Now, he was charged with trying to repair it, without looking like a fool.
. You don’t get to make that call. Never again, understand? We don’t do this. You don’t ever do that, and so help me Thor, if you do it ever again, I’ll fucking kill you. I’ll bring you back to life just to kill you myself.”
“Nope,” Tony lets the ‘
“We’ve never had to be, before.”
“Don’t get soft on me now, Rogers. Fuck me. Harder. Come on, baby, please, please.”
This is about closure, and feeling good. Steve wants to feel better right? And it’s been ninety-two days since Tony’s last felt good.
Natasha snorted. “Looks like someone already has.”
“Somewhere to be, Cap?”
They locked up most of the facility a long while ago, closing down wings and saying goodbye to the staff that remained. Natasha stays, because where else would she go? Bruce stays with her. They try to organize with the local governments to provide relief but are repeatedly told their services are ‘no longer required’.
Shoving his other hand into the puppet, Steve cracked his eyes open and glanced down at the little Iron Man. The material was worn now, pilling and thin from too many tumbles through the washing machine. But it didn’t matter, Steve had his eidetic memory and when he looked at it, it was like looking right into Tony’s perfect, handsome face.
“Yeah,” Steve admits, defeated. “Yeah, Tony. They would.”
“Fuck.”
Pleasure exploded through him and Tony swore he’d transcended into light itself.
“I love you,” Steve whispers, ignoring the wet sniffle behind him that undoubtedly belongs to Natasha. He ignores everything.
In his nightmares he belongs in Hell for all that’s happened between them, but if this is Hell, he’d stay. He’d stay here forever just to catch a glimpse of Tony’s body moving like liquid confidence, his bright eyes mapping out another genius invention.
A thumb flicks over one of his nipples, and Steve jerks into him, chasing after his mouth. “I thought you helped design this?”
Tony huffs a breath and feels his mouth pull back into a sneer he tries to prevent, but loses. “So what if I have? It was only a matter of time, wasn’t it?”
“Better get used to it, Pete. Believe it or not, it’s not the death-defying feats and saving the world that make it tough to be a superhero. And you can’t even enjoy the champagne yet.”
“Mine,” Steve rumbles in his ear, biting the soft spot under his ear and Tony moans around the fingers in his mouth. “Want everyone to know, Tony. I want everyone to see.”
"Well next time, don't."
Steve's fighting off the August chill on the walk back to the house when he spots Tony's mop of curls poking out in the crowd. He figures it can't hurt to say 'hi, so he sidles up beside him, clearing his throat by his ear to catch his attention.
"No thanks, I've already sated the fire in my loins. My lady love and I have a healthy enough physical life, but thank you for suggesting."
Rolling his eyes, Steve sips at his drink. It goes down rough, and he suppresses a wince, gingerly passing it to Bucky. "Come on Nat, don't tell me you're losing your touch," Steve teases, hoping she wouldn't kill him in his sleep for this. "Besides, isn't Rhodes still with Danvers?"
The three men in the lounge stared at the staires, turning to face each other.
"Then what were you implying bringing up their ages? It's a free country, isn't it? I'd be tired of men like you too if I was in the dating business."
Putting things in motion.
let's not focus on the negatives Ned.
"Uh huh, well, tell your friend he can approach himself, better yet, I'll tell him myself."
"Even so, certain factions and certain organisations are eager to have them back, though I doubt anyone'll stick their neck out for Lang or Barton," Matt says matter-of-factly, inclining his head to Tony. "It's Rogers they want."
“You’re sure, Tony?” Steve breathed against his mouth. “You want to be ours?”
He follows the wizard through the portal without a second glance.
“I’m going to assume that everyone has already reviewed the briefing documents.” Rhodey initiates the meeting, his voice a firm projection that envelopes the whole room. “So, let’s run through this as quick and as painless as possible.”
real. I remember—”
Steve didn’t push it right away, cracking eggs into a pan and frying them up. When his breakfast was ready, he refilled his own mug with coffee, padding over to refill Tony’s as well.
“Listen, Tony, I just wanted to say–”
“You ridiculous little punk,” Bucky shook his head and Steve’s cheeks pinked up again, eyes tipping off to the side. Always so shy, his Alpha. “I’ve wanted you forever. And then you went out and found this perfect Omega and Lord help me, I wanted him too. I shouldn’t have, but I did.”
“I don’t know, it felt like it needed to be asked so I asked it. I don’t know what else to say.”
“Don’t touch my parts.”
“Tony, sweetheart, I—”
“You uh, on your way out?” Steve shifts uneasily from one foot to the other. It’s an odd look on him, for a man who stands in nothing short of parade rest at any other given time.
The words hang like a childish threat between them until Bucky nods, resigned. “Yeah, sure. There are other sets. You could try it again, if you really wanted to. But Tony would be ashamed of this. He’d be so ashamed, if he could see you right now.”
“Of course, Pep. Wouldn’t miss it. And I was kidding about the cake. Please don’t get me a cake, unless you want to see something uglier than my fortieth.”
lingers unsaid in the space between them.
“Trading out one broken down body for another? Not your best idea. Three out of ten.”
The honesty is meant to hurt and it hits the mark on Steve’s abused heart.
“What were you doing?” Tony tried to demand but the words came out slurred and broken as if his tongue was too big for his mouth. It was almost as if he was hungover, confusion and disbelief rife in his expression.
“I hate this body,” Steve corrects. He may hate this skin, but he’ll always love Tony.
Tony could feel them breathing under his skin and all of a sudden, he knew. He
“Steve’s the best thing that ever happened to you. And it doesn’t take much to know you’re the best thing that ever happened to him. You think any of us could go through the things you two have gone through and make it out? This doesn’t just happen by accident, Tony.”
Tony’s limp body still feels heavy in his arms, even more unbearable under the weight of Peter’s disbelief as he staggers to his knees next to them. When Peter curls over them, his desperate pleas echo in the silence but Steve can’t think of a damn thing to say.
“I gotcha, Pete,” Steve says as Peter lands squarely in his arms, and he grunts under the pressure. Thin and wiry as he may be, the kid’s all muscle under that adolescent frame, and Steve sets him on his feet with a consolatory pat on the back. He grins at Peter’s outraged look.
Pregnancy suited Pepper. In the last few months, she’d grown round and soft with their baby—a little girl, though Steve still wasn’t sure he could believe it. Even when she was uncomfortable, even when she was snapping at Tony and ordering him about, she was perfect.
Steve keeps kissing him.
“A birthday surprise,” Tony corrected, “don’t get a big head. Surprise can go either way.”
It’s more than he could have ever anticipated and it truly feels like the beginning of a new adventure.
“Sir has died, Captain. The Avalon Protocol was established in the event of death during a catastrophic event. It would allow me to take over and pilot the Iron Man suit remotely until the fight had ended, so the team would not be left short-handed. The battle is complete and thus the protocol remains active only so far as to allow me to transport Sir to his next location. I am terribly sorry for your loss.”
“Have you ever thought about dyeing your hair?”
Steve laughs, a little breathless sound, because the blare of the Assembly Alarm is screaming through their bedroom and has been for a handful of minutes. JARVIS has thoughtfully started broadcasting the comms line through the Tower and Steve can hear that Clint and Natasha are already scrambling the Quinjet, and Thor is in the sky on route.
“Your husband trying to kill you creates reasonable grounds for separation,” Tony quips as if they haven’t already had this conversation multiple times before. He doesn’t know what Rhodey’s angle is tonight. They’ve carefully avoided the topic and danced around it for weeks leading up to the council sessions.
People systematically destroy the ones they love every day, trying to love them for something more than what they are. Tony and Steve deserve better than that, even if Steve doesn’t see it yet.
He shouts a quick set of directions to the driver waiting on the tarmac before calling the suit. Red and gold wrap around him, a sight Steve will never get tired of, and he resists the urge to rearrange himself
He’d almost forgotten that sound. There’d been a time where he thought he might never hear that sound again.
Yes, things are better.
Steve chomps down on a laugh. It’d been a long time since he’d seen a woman that spitting mad.
Steve is clocking his movements but why should Tony care? Steve probably knows now anyway, or at least suspects, and Tony has nothing to be ashamed of. Fuck Steve and his guilty conscience.
“I’m sorry. God, I am so fucking sorry, Tony. Please believe me.” Big, heaving sobs take over and Tony tugs him forward into his arms, half collapsing under the massive weight of him. It’s awkward and uncomfortable, one of Tony’s legs is quickly falling asleep under him, but he holds him through it all. Just like in Steve’s memory from the farm.
“What?” Tony jerks back as if Steve’s slapped him. His face tightens up, and he tugs the sheet up higher, like some second line of defense. As soon as he’s said it, Steve wants to take it back.
Steve is flayed open, spread over a spit and burning alive in Tony’s arms.
“Tony you–”
“Maybe we should get an alpaca,” Tony suggests, nose buried in his tablet while Steve reads the same line, over and over again in the newspaper. He hums without commitment. It’s Tony’s newest thing, these animals. They’ve accumulated half a farm in their backyard, and Tony loves them all.
Bruce is flat on his ass on the ground, arm freshly burnt to hell. Peter’s aghast, eyes whipping between them as Tony raises his hand and—
“If you don’t get the fuck out of my face right now, Rogers, I swear to God I’ll–”
Slumping against the window, Steve has to hold him up while Tony’s breathing evens out and he shuts his eyes against the technicolour blur of New York at night. Why he’d ever left New York for Malibu, he’ll never know.
As if sharing silent instructions, Steve recaptured Tony’s mouth and shoved his boxers down to his knees, a second set of hands tugging them off at his ankles. Maybe he could ask them to do all the work, just lay there and bask in their attention, warm and slick, mind wiped blank with ecstasy.
“Gotta stop meeting like this,” Bucky says gruffly in his ear, and Steve laughs. The sky opens, teaming with another invasion, but Steve just laughs and laughs.
“Tony?” Steve calls out, panicked, whipping around to where he last saw his husband, his own armour protruding from his stomach when that bastard of a wizard had given up the stone.
Tony gives him a calculating look, like Steve’s a series of codes he can’t quite figure out, tongue trapped between his teeth and poking just barely at the inside of his cheek. “Steve.” Tony ducks his head when Steve looks away, holding his eye. “Steve. Just—I’m here for you. I’m here
“Like you mean it.” Tony can’t resist goading him, licking behind his teeth between quick words. “Kiss me like you’ve missed me, soldier.”
Steve hates the comparison; he doesn’t even bother hiding it. “Is that what this is about? You think we’re, what? Your parents?”
“You keep saying something bigger is coming, Tony. What can I do like this? I need to be fixed.”
That’s worse.
“Some of us kept the rest of us up last night and don’t deserve nothin’.” Steve shot back, snuggling in closer until he was pressed against Tony’s front.
“Stop whining!” Natasha puts in from across the room.
Tony had asserted since the beginning,
“Fuck me.” Tony doesn’t miss a beat. His head rolls to the side, and Steve catches a glimpse of red cheeks and blown-black eyes before Tony’s eyelids flutter closed. His body jerks under a final sharp crook of Steve’s fingers, buried into the hilt again. “Yes, yes, baby. Just fuck me. That’s what I want. Fuck me every day for the rest of our lives.”
Steve’s voice is a whisper under the screaming and screeching whistling of the wind.
The workshop was dark and seemingly vacant, various projects strewn across the worktables and a few screens lit on the far side, running a set of code that FRIDAY was likely processing on Tony’s behalf.
at all. It’s written like he thinks I was going to, I don’t know, send it to the press or something.” Tony grips the kitchen counter so hard his finger joints creak. “You know, he told me he loved me. Before.”
Tony doesn’t look up right away, throwing his wrench down on the worktable and leaning against it, slumped over. White knuckles stare up at him as tension manifests physically in his body.
When Steve’s entire body recoils from the joke he flinches, Steve shaking his head and offering a watery half-smile.  “That’s not funny, Tony.”
“Sir the risk of decompression sickness—”
On the first day upstate, Tony hangs the picture of himself and Peter with Peter’s internship award above the kitchen sink and stares at it while he washes the dishes. He doesn’t speak to Steve. He hardly looks at him at all.
When he finally comes, pumping line after line of release down Steve’s throat, Tony shatters. The tears fall onto Steve’s hands, and Tony slides down the tractor, bare-assed on the dirty, old floorboards, cock limp and shining with spit between his legs.
“Fuck me or get out, Steve,” Tony snaps, already on his feet and yanking Steve up with him.
“Never.”
“You figured out time travel and you haven’t figured this out yet?” Steve grins up at him, Tony’s smile contagious. “That doesn’t sound like Tony Stark to me.”
Was all of this worth it?
If Steve would just hand them over, Tony would cherish them as all the slivers of Steve he’s never seen before. Without a doubt, Tony knows those slivers will fit directly into the cracks in their foundation. The cracks that have been there from the beginning. Resentment ebbs and flows beneath the surface because he gave Steve his own flaws willing, every imperfection, and in many ways, Steve has abused that privilege.
Quiet laughter rippled through them both.
“I know it’s not what you meant. But it’s true. Being close to you hurts me, Steve. I have never met another person who can hurt me quite like you do. And the fucked-up thing is I love you anyway. That’s not fair.” Tony meets his eye, reaches up, and slides his palm across his face. His thumb traces the hollows under one of Steve’s beautiful eyes before dropping down to do the same to his lips. Steve kisses the pad of his finger. “I don’t deserve this. And you don’t deserve me.”
He’ll stay. Steve is worth the risk.
“I did it again,” Tony whispers.
Steve shifts in the chair, drawing Tony’s attention back to the scene. Realization slams into him like a train.
I don't know if I can ever be okay.
PLEASE NOTE: though it wasn't planned this way originally, I just started watching bnha and am extremely fascinated by their superhero world, so I've decided to incorporate it into this story!!
"Listening to stories, that's the only thing you three are good at."
Just saying.
It's not exactly unfamiliar to find someone bunking in his room, but after a long night of being cooped up in the study centre, Steve wants to pull his hair out at the sight. He curses Sam, or Brock, or whoever gave their one night stand the idea that Steve's room was free real estate, and pads over silently to put his sketchbook away and get an extra blanket to make his stay on the couch a little more comfortable.
"Yes, then. Peter didn't just have a cold or flu, what he has probably won't ever go away, but that doesn't mean he isn't able to manage it in a few ways," Tony explains, grabbing Morgan's hand as she starts leaning back out of his hold. "Every now and then, it gets really bad for him though, so I'll have to take him to the doctor in the morning."
"We don't know yet, we'll have to see how things play out," Tony informs them, stretching out his arms when Jamie comes barrelling into the room. "Okay, no more work for the rest of the weekend."
"Hmmm," Steve groans, looking up to see his face. "Good morning."
"Sure, I'd like that, Dad."
Peter's eyebrow shoots up. "I mean, duh. You're not really known for having much self-awareness."
Tony sighs deeply, closing the project he'd been working on. "Right now? I'm thinking I'd kill for some pizza. And maybe some fries?" Tony asks lightly, hoping to steer them out of this conversation.
Tony took Steve's hand and held onto it. "Of course I am." He smiled, eyes still downcast. "Will you sit with me?" He didn't want to be alone right now, not when he was stuck in his head and thinking of Rhodey, of his mama.
Tony rolls his eyes, hobbling over to the chair in the corner. "Jesus, Reed. Not everything's a conspiracy. I hurt my leg, that's the part you should focus on."
Danny reaches out to draw the paper towards him, an eyebrow quirked. "They definitely won't get that right. They haven't even stood trial yet."
Tony bursts into laughter, nose wrinkling up. "God, no. I'm actually starting to wonder if any of it was even real."
"Uh, because you weren't answering your phone?"
"Okay, we get it." Gwen rolls her eyes. "But are you seriously not even going to listen to what we're offering?"
Tossing his clothes in the gym bag he uses for dirty laundry, Steve undresses himself before sliding in behind Tony, wrapping him in his arms.
"Just saying, the streets are full tonight. Be careful."
Thankfully the captain's boy, Harley, was still above deck when Tony had finally managed to pull himself up from the floor. Aching from the beating and numb with confusion and hurt, he sat quietly as the boy patched him up, drawing the shawl he'd rested on his shoulders closer.
hey, it's riri 😊
Tony pauses, and starts tapping a beat into the desk. "What about Steve?"
"So you all knew about this Tony except me?"
"Definitely," Steve reiterates, nuzzling into his neck. "What did you want to do today beside getting into my pants?"
"About that-" "We meddled and kind of fucked things up for them, therefor Steve cannot know he's here, and neither can Rhodey, under any circumstances," Sam interjects, cutting Bucky off who gives him a punch to the pec.
Steve smiles, resting his hat over Tony's face. "Just because I don't read, doesn't mean I don't listen to stories. "
"No psuedo-blowjobs in public, Tony," Steve whispers once she leaves, leaning so close Tony can feel his breath on his face. "There are kids here."
"I wasn't thinking anything else, a boy like that would be popular in Nat's place though."
"It really isn't, Tony, and I'm sorry. That was unfair of me, but you have to consider that these people aren't rational, especially when it comes to personal situations like this. Natasha may not be on Barnes's level of importance, but she was his second for years. Who says this isn't their shitty plan to force their way back in? Natasha's in the US, so they figure they divebomb the place and have just enough time to demand shit from us and the council."
"Oh, um, you just seemed really busy, I didn't want to disturb you if that was the case."
"So what do you think that's about?" Thor asks sarcastically, levelling Bucky with an unimpressed look.
It's maybe not the standard picture of domesticity, but it's as close as Tony has ever come, frighteningly so. He tries to stamp out the little licks of satisfaction that flush over him whenever Steve grabs his hand, or smiles at him in that soft way he does. Steve is gorgeous, and pretty perfect in every other way too, and Tony wouldn't mind calling him his boyfriend, or being the centre of his attention forever.
"Fine,
"I see you're up," came a deep voice, his accent more reminiscent of someone from the East. "How's your head feel?"
"Making a statement, with statement pieces," Janet says, staring off as if she could already visualise it. "I'd totally be into it if you wanted to?"
"Tony,
Steve's jostled in his seat by the voice that appears above him, Tony's charming smile lighting up his face. "You boys don't have corn to shuck?"
Laughing good naturedly, Reed walked him out of the forge, a bounce to his step. "And here I thought you weren't like the other spinsters in town. Sue should take you by the farm and introduce you to her mama."
"Oh my God, when is my makeover montage, Prince Charming? I have to warn you though, I got my braces removed years ago."
hope you guys liked!! I always start off with one idea, nd as I write the story and scenes take on a life of it's own lol.
I sent the letters, you said you got them??
"Pump those breaks, kid. We barely spoke," she says, but before the disappointment could catch up to Peter, she adds, "but you can give me his number and we can see where it goes from there."
"Good?" Steve slurs against Tony's collarbone, sucking a mark there.
Gathering his strength, he picked up the half-full (and who said he wasn't an optimist) bottle and chugged it back, cringing back almost immediately. Okay, so clearly he wasn't making good decisions to start with, but would that stop him? No. Would he bw more careful next time? Also no.
"Don't forget to breathe when you speak," Tony says amused, laying Morgan down beside Harley and taking a seat on the side of the bed.
When they pull away for air, Steve's face is flushed all the way down to his chest, a noticeable bulge poking Tony's thigh. "So you're definitely not up for morning sex?"
This was my first story and I'm thankful that I can still be writing it.
The boy splutters, almost dropping the textbooks he was hauling over to his closet. "Wha- uh no, we, uh, just figured it was kind of an elite society you know? I heard you guys had to personally invite people," he mumbles, staring at her with curious eyes. "Not that we wouldn't not want to join!"
Tony frowns, skimming over the report. "That would be giving me a lot of power I don't have. Rules have changed, and they need to answer to the big dogs."
Porn and angst 🌚
Peter rarely, if ever, brings people home with him.
"Kiddo that's really not necessary."
Blowing out a breath of frustration, he flips the burner open, going to messages and furiously punching out a text.
"There are still others, Tony," Stephen says reassuringly, placing a hand on his shoulder.
Tony giggles as he wraps his letterman around his shoulders, and maybe Steve flexes a bit to catch his eye.
Things had been in a downward spiral since May, but there was nothing Tony could
The sheets smell distinctly like Steve, and Tony feels comforted when he pulls the neatly folded quilt at the bottom of the bed over him, burrowing into the pillows for a good night's rest. He'd talk to Steve tomorrow.
"Okay, can you two take it upstairs? I have customers trying to enjoy their doggone meal!" Remy shouts from the bar, all pink in the face.
A rush of footsteps followed him, and before he knew it, he was surrounded, and held in place by two huge hands, crying out in pain as his foot twisted unnaturally. "Now hold on, sweetheart, we weren't done speaking with you just yet."
When they're done, embarrassingly fast for both of them, Tony looks up at Steve, flushed and happy and sleepy all in one. He watches his eyes get heavier, and how a stubborn strand of hair is stuck to his forehead no matter how many times Steve pushes it back.
Peter's breaths come out shallow and harsh, his shaking hands clutched in Tony's night shirt as he sobs quietly. The brunet whispers quiet little nothings into his hair, rocking his baby boy from side to side to try to comfort him. Peter's anxiety had always put a lot of stress on his body, and manifested physically sometimes too, it's why he tried to keep the house as neutral as possible, and why they had had to leave the Tower in the first place. Maximoff had never assaulted their dreams, but Tony's nightly screaming and panic-fuelled inventing hadn't gone unnoticed by Peter.
"Would I go into the city for seafood?" she asks, receiving twin nods of confirmation. "Why not? If the place is really good, I'd definitely be up for it."
Tony plucks it out of his hand, urging Steve closer to him with the heel of his foot pushing urgently against his ass. Looking down briefly, he pinches the tip and rolls the condom onto Steve's cock, tongue poking out between his lips. Steve throws his head back, pleased sounds escaping his lips and shallowly thrusting into the loose fist Tony uses to jack him off.
"Tony?" Nat quirks an eyebrow in Steve's direction, watching the man try to make himself as small as possible.
"My room's this wa-," Peter says, pointing down the hall and leading the way, freezing when he sees his Dad standing outside Harley's room, Morgan on his side, chatting away and doing that thing where he expresses with his hands.
Ty Stone was one of Steve's frat brother, and one of the only ones he didn't really get along with. The guy was pushy, and didn't understand moderation or humility, often getting their team fined because of his short temper. Steve was no saint, and aggression on the field was to be expected when you put a bunch of testosterone-fuelled twenty somethings together and made them compete for points and fight for a tiny ball, but he sure as fuck wasn't knocking the shit out of rival captains.
NB: Time-wise, am I making things move too fast?
"Woah, seriously?" Peter asks excitedly. "That's- that's great, would you be interested in going out with him?"
Peter slams his locker shut, nearly jumping out of his skin when he sees Riri casually leaning against the pillar next to him. "What?"
It's a strange feeling to be in Steve's room when it's so empty and neat. There aren't any dishes stacked on the shelves or covering his desk, no stray clothes littering the floor or heaped on the chair in the corner, and everything else is packed into it's rightful place, not a book laying around or crumbs dusting the carpet. Steve's room is homey nevertheless, and Tony realises it's the blonde's lack of presence that makes it feel empty, a solar system without it's sun.
Tony woke to the pattering of rain on the window, tucked into a straw bed and covered with a heavy quilt.
"Well, your mom is definitely correct, the future belongs to those who grab it in both hands, and mold it to their liking," Tony cheers, earning a giggle from Morgan and a loud laugh from inside Harley's room.
"Shaddup. Aren't you supposed to be sick?"
"Uh, thanks," Steve says shyly, cheeks pinking. "How's your first official week been?"
"Daddy's so silly, Morgan," Harley coos as he strides up to them, still laughing as he appears in the doorway, eyes zeroing in on Riri.
"Of course, I understand," Riri says, spotting his dad coming out of the house. "But if you're up for it, let Ned know there's a spot for him too. Our guy, Amadeus, wants to meet your guy in the chair."
"We haven't had a Code Blue in a while, has he been taking his meds?" Peter had been taking Prozac since he was thirteen, both for his anxiety disorder, and to help him with a PMS disorder he'd been suffering from  since he was thirteen.
We laugh a little, and we cry a little
Setting Bucky's shirt aside, Tony reaches for one of Sam's. "It's not problem, Burckaroo, but one would think one of you knuckleheads would learn how to sew. Good cotton shirts like this shouldn't just be left to rot and tear."
This ran from me, I didn't even have this in the OG outline!!
"You know Sam, one of these days you won't be able to speak for you and Stevie any more, especially since he's real sweet on our dear friend, Tony now," Bucky pipes up, trailing kisses along Natasha's collarbone.
so do you guys think Riri would like Harley???
Tony giggles, tugging on Thor's fierce beard. It was surprisingly not as oily as he imagined it to be, and for a second, he thinks of Steve with a beard, before getting sad again.
Steve glares at him from across the room for the rest of the night.
Bucky and Steve watch miserably as the Omegas their hearts were set on flirt and joke with the other men in the bar, Sam standing up to join them after the fifth deep sigh that comes out of Steve. "Either you join them, ask them to sit on your knots for all of eternity, or keep staring at them in silence while braver men make their intentions known," their long-time friend says in passing, tapping Tony's leg and sitting down to get a lapful of the brunet Omega.
"It seems laughable, trust me, I had the same reaction," Stephen says, ignoring Tony's stink eye. "Superheroes dealing with bureaucracy seems strange, I know, Namor, but whoever's out there? Whoever's trying to make Earth their battlefield? They're more organised than us, and they sure have better numbers."
Startling at the attention now on him, Tony turns to look at Natasha, wide eyed and slightly tipsy. "Nat."
"Of course," Steve replied, lowering himself to sit beside the chair, his hand never leaving Tony's.
Remy grabs his rag, moving to the other side of the bar. "See if I give ya' anything for free again."
From: Peter B. Parkour
"Rih doesn't make music anymore," Riri jokes, stretching back in her seat. "We'll get Fenty air before we get any Fenty music."
The brunet is dressed in damp jeans and a thin shirt, spurring Steve on to get into more comfortable and warm sleeping clothes, trying his best not to wake him. Tony huffs and groans a few times, but remains asleep, his face buried in the pillows.
On the one hand, Peter was clearly trying hard to impress her or something, and he clearly didn't want anyone to know who has dad was, so she didn't mind playing along. On the other hand, she would've killed for this opportunity at any other time, and keeping her lips shut would be hard. Besides, her main goal was bringing him into the fold; he was her pledge, so she hoped he'd be interested, though his dad might be against it.
Before Riri can say more, Peter reaches a hand out, placing it on Riri's shoulder. "I'm not trying to ask you out, Rih," Peter explains, mind running a mile a minute piecing the story together. "But my little brother is. Uh- Harley, the weird one."
2. Miles is on the Champions (no change to this or his comics intro)
Noticing his panic, Steve stands up to sit beside him, a grounding hand on his neck. "Hey, no need to worry about it. They know not to mention you, we wanted to speak to you first."
, damnit.”
“I didn’t order room service,” Tony glares at the door and makes no move to open it.
“I want you to sit on my chest and fuck my mouth, Steve. I don’t want you to be gentle, I want you to make me feel it. I want to do this for you. And I want you to
“Indeed,” J.A.R.V.I.S. says. “If I may interject, Captain. Sir appears to be at risk of interrogation by Ms. Romanoff. I’d suggest you hurry.”
Tony keeps him on the edge for almost an hour.
“I’ll admit, there does appear to be a special, paternal sort of way that you react to young Mr. Parker,” Vision adds unhelpfully, and Tony squirms a little in his seat, saying nothing.
“Not that you have a choice in the matter,” Tony said, “but when we get home, we’re getting married. I’m not letting you go, not after this. I mean it, Steve. The second we set foot on solid land. Married. Forever. No exceptions.”
His home, no matter where they are.
“We’re meeting Laura and the kids to take them tobogganing.” Clint supplied. “We’ll be back sometime after dinner.”
If you’d asked him a year ago if he could have pictured this, Tony might’ve laughed. He definitely would have laughed. There was no way to anticipate ever feeling this fulfilled. This desired. It was so crystalline clear now that this was where it all ends; that ache that lived inside him can finally subside and disappear altogether.
“It might help,” he’d said, “you know, when you can’t wake me up?”
Steve frowns. “How?”
“Jim?” Natasha turns her focus back to Rhodey.
see that Steve is just doing what’s best for all of them?
Peter agrees, and Tony lets out a breath he’d been holding onto for the entire exchange. Whatever Peter is thinking, he carefully hides behind an animated conversation with Bucky, first on the phone, and then in person when the assassin joins them in the workshop and presents his mottled shoulder for review.
“Come on, fuck me.” Tony’s gasping and clenching down, pulling out all the stops to just get Steve to fuck him the way he needs to be fucked. If Steve will just fuck him until he’s crying and aching, it’ll be worth it. “You fucking bastard, come on.”
He swallowed the last of the tasteless pasta, passing his dessert towards the sad older woman across the table who never spoke and the images disappeared. She’d been here longer than Steve could bear to comprehend, a constant reminder that even when Tony was here with him, they were anywhere but home. No one ever came to her weekly visits.
The air around them crackles and the liquid fire races through Tony and into Steve. The pain is instant and all-consuming. He doesn’t know how Tony can stand it. It’s like they’ve been plugged right into the New York energy grid and Steve feels his heart skip beats in his chest. His skin burns and he can smell them, the charred flesh of Tony’s wrist and their joined palms where Steve grips him and refuses to let go.
They’re running the same set of drills for the sixth or seventh time, and Steve can’t get his head in the game. Peter swings from the rafters above him, webbing his shield out of his grasp and tossing it aside to Sam before firing another shot that covers the cowl and steals his sight.
The silence hangs on until the last moment, clawing at them. Steve closes his eyes. “I know.”
“He’d get angry when I’d tell him to stop. I kept trying to convince him that there wasn’t anything to forgive and we didn’t need to talk about it. Through all of that he’d listen to me talk about you and what we’d had. I always came back to ‘how can he be so heartless,’ after everything.”
“My mates.” Steve rumbled in challenge, tipping him sideways and pressing him down into the blanket mound in a delicious display of ownership.
“Drop it, Pepper.”
What a goddamn farce.
Then Tony had stopped laughing.
“There he is.” Tony leans forward to brush his hair back from his face. “I always loved your hair like this. Gotta say though, Rogers. I did not love these pants.”
Steve lets go just as Tony prepares to fire one of the supersonic blasts at him—nothing that will injure their teammates, but packing enough force to propel them backwards a fair distance—and lands on Sam in his pursuit of Natasha.
“Sometimes I forget that you’re not the same person I met in the beginning,” she murmurs, then hesitates.
“What do you want?”
Tony takes pity on him. “If you come in here, I need you to promise me something.”
Tony’s voice startles Steve and his attention returns with a singular focus when the ticking of the keyboard comes to a sudden stop. Tony rests, setting his hands on the edge of the workbench in a controlled, fluid motion, giving the screen a blank look smeared with the beginnings of distaste.
Steve sighed, peace wrapping around him as he settled back into the sweet plane between wake and sleep. His brain was a happy buzz, filled with a fog that resonated with
“A whole life,” Steve mutters against his skin. “Kids and grandkids. I’m going to grow old with you.”
A big last thank you to fundamentalblue for her fantastic beta work, and resurrectedhippo's thoughtful comments every step of the way, beginning to end.
out for you.”
Kissed him for the last time.
“Me too, sweetheart.” He breaths, trapping Steve’s hands above his head.
“Tony, are you sure? They can wait.”
The program switches to Siberia next and Tony already knows what’s going to happen, and he knows why Steve won’t be able to break through. It’s so obvious; Steve has to know that by now, so why does he keep trying?
The other room was more tactile, filled with old fashioned, plush furniture and ridiculous things like bean bag chairs and a mountain of blankets you could drown in if you weren’t careful. FRIDAY had been a valuable consultant, helping Tony to fill the room with anything that might be helpful when it came to ‘self-care,’
The peace offering is powerful, and he remembers the way she was back then. How different she is now. Maybe that was the point and maybe it’s another metaphor entirely.
What comes out is, “I’m grieving.”
“Oh Captain,” Tony purrs in his ear, biting down on the lobe. “Consider it an order.”
“What do you mean ‘really though’,” Tony asked absently. “You asked me for my favourite food. I like cake. Any cake really. Chocolate cake, vanilla cake, any of the kinkier flavours that bakers around the world have come up with. Cake.”
Positive reinforcement is always a good motivator.
Peter glances up, expectant, as he pops off a few more plates, peering inside at the complex web of the inner wiring. It hits him all at once; the prosthetic wasn’t meant to be a weapon at all. It was a hastily thrown together thing and a poor substitute in comparison to the one Tony had blown off.
Clint had been the lucky recipient, and out of duty and his strong commitment to trolling, every winter at the first snowfall he unpacked the gloves from his closet and wore them until spring.
Steve sets the drawing aside, half finished, and in a few short steps he’s in Tony’s arms. When Tony kisses him, it tastes like the peanut sauce next to the stove.
Bucky twitches his fingers menacingly at Peter and asks him if he wants to stay for dinner.
Tony bites Steve’s lower lip, forcing Steve to share air and saliva and their combined gasps of pleasure.
Tony doesn’t know what to make of
A hundred possible responses come to mind and Tony settles on cold and detached, offering Steve a roll of his eyes and a shrug. “That’ll happen to you sometimes.”
“It was a simple fix, you know.” Tony’s eyes are fixed on the ceiling and his breathing is slow and even.
“Don’t be sorry,” Tony says, shoving an elbow into his ribs. “Aunt Peggy is just mad that in this timeline I got to you first.”
“This is how it should have been, last time,” Steve whispers into his skin.
“Are you sure you want to know?” Steve nods sharply and because he would want to know, too, if it had been Steve, he’ll tell him.
There’s a moment of hesitation where Steve gives him a disbelieving look as if he can’t believe Tony is pushing him, or can’t believe that he’s still sitting there. Whatever it is, Steve takes a few jerky steps back over to the chair and sits down, stiff and bewildered as if Tony’s pulled the rug out from underneath his feet.
“Master Override L-R-2-5-5-8, Captain Rogers, Steven Grant. I know you have the footage, JARVIS. Show it to me. Now.”
It’s blurred with Steve’s blood splattering onto his face and his arms raised over his head above him—
“Tony, don’t! Please don’t!”
Tony already knows that nothing Steve can say will make any difference.
“We’re in this together,” Steve reminds him. Always. “Maybe not everything needs to be a battle anymore. Don’t you think we’re getting a little old for that, sweetheart?”
“The letter was selfish. I see that now. I thought that if I could just… I don’t know, appease you, or something. Humour you, tell you I at least understood your perspective and why you were holding onto it so tightly, that maybe that would be enough. It was the easiest way I could get what I wanted.”
“Cat’s out of the bag, Cap.” Tony quirks an eyebrow at him, deferring to Steve’s lead as if it weren’t Tony who’d asked to keep things quiet, just a little while longer. Steve steps in close, resting a hand on the dip of his back and peeks at the phone over his shoulder.
“No, it’s not. He’s said he doesn’t want to go. He’s said he’s not ready, and you’re going to burn the Avengers to the ground if something happens out there, tonight. You didn’t even ask him, Steve! You didn’t ask any of them!” Tony throws his arm out in a wide arc, gesturing at the pristinely dressed Avengers behind him.
It wasn’t that Tony was ashamed, per say, because if he was anyone else this would have been perfectly normal.
“Fuck you.” Tony shoves him, in his space from one blink to the next with his hands forcing against his chest. It catches Steve off guard, and he staggers back, missing a step over an uneven patch in the floorboards. “You fucking asshole.”
, slices through his belly.
“Mail came for you today, Boss.”
“I know.” He wipes at the corner of Steve’s eyes with his thumbs, dropping them down to trace across his beautiful, trembling mouth.
They’re two magnets, spinning around each other, preparing to collide. Everything in him is drawn to Tony, even now, even like this. Steve’s been so fucking lonely with the weight of the world on his shoulders and there’s something inside him itching to let it go. If Tony wants it, he can have it.
Steve paused at the curious look on Bucky’s face. “That… you didn’t take them, right? This isn’t another prank war starting?”
“You look so pretty like that, sweetheart,” Steve stroked a hand through Bucky’s hair, pushing it off his face and holding it back at the crown of his head. “Buck’s mouth all over you. How’s his tongue feel inside you, honey, so good, huh?”
When he’d repaired things with Tony, he’d set it aside, his friendship with Bucky being more important as he held himself together with tape and string.
Tony’s resolve wavers, and he narrows his eyes. “That’s not what this is about. Stop twisting my words. Yes, Ultron and Lagos were both ultimate fuck ups, but this isn’t about
“Tell them about the big donut!” Natasha prompts from the table, smirking over the beer in her hand before taking a long pull from the mouth of the bottle.
“It’s okay. Tony, it’s okay. I love you. I’ve loved you since the beginning, you know that. It’s okay. I promise.”
“Don’t leave your parts on the table.”
“My biggest regret,” Steve says, solemn, and to his surprise, Tony laughs.
“I’d have given you damn well near anything, Steve. But I guess you already know that, don’t you?”
“We’ve got him, Tones. You just focus on pushing that shrapnel out.”
“And you want us to be his people?”
“Fuck you,” Steve snarls, jolting into the couch to pull off Tony’s fingers. He’s not going to play this game with Tony. It’s not worth it, it’s not—Tony’s body follows after him and he can’t squirm away. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Rhodey glares at him. “Wow, that’s rude. And no. Honestly, Tony, if you don’t tell him, I think I’ll have to do it for you. Steve and I have talked about it; we need all hands on deck and he at least deserves an opportunity to train with the team and get familiar with how to fight with us. You know he’ll get pulled in, either way. Why wait until there’s an alien invasion strolling through Brooklyn?”
Tony sighs, closing his eyes. “Because what you’re trying to do with these other memories… it’s, I guess it’s because you’re trying to prevent that last memory from happening, right? You’re trying to tell him – me – before everything goes to shit?”
An alien dog smashes into Steve from the side, and his vision tilts as he hits the ground, hard. Time stands still in the moments he tries to fight his way free. A series of bullets rain down overhead, and Bucky’s at his side, metal fingers digging into his bicep as he’s hauled to his feet.
“Fine. Tomorrow then.”
. Tony blinks once and slips away.
“I just – really want to thank you – for dinner.” Tony bit out between kisses.
“Listen to me,” Tony hisses in his ear, mouthing at the soft skin below. “This is the man I fell in love with. You’re beautiful. Delicate, breakable, and still the strongest fucking person I’ve ever known.” Tony picks up the pace, grinding his hips into Steve’s ass and Steve can feel Tony’s cock in his throat, spearing through him.
The coffee beside Steve had cooled, forgotten.
Steve grits his teeth and there it is. That gets him going.
“Don’t hide, Steve. Please keep trying.”
A mouth that’s never going to smile or laugh or kiss Steve ever again.
Every breath feels like shattered glass stretching through his chest cavity. Maybe this is what the shrapnel felt like in Tony’s, except he’s relatively certain that this pain is his shattered ribs, sliding around in his chest before the serum can stitch him back together.
“We can figure this out. Tony, please let’s at least try. No yelling this time. I promise I won’t. It’s been months and I don’t want to lose you over this.”
“We should test how good those senses stand up against my arrows.” Clint’s fingers twitch as if he’s prepared to reach behind him and grab arrows that aren’t there.
They’re just placing an order for pizzas when he does, and when Natasha sees him settle into an armchair across from Clint. She shoots him a small smile, and adds his favourite, from memory, into the already obscenely large order.
Steve curls over on his side, pulling down the blanket that hangs over the back of the sofa and takes a deep breath. The smell of Tony lingers on everything, sharp and spicy, comforting in a way that makes Steve think he could die here, if he really wanted. Just close his eyes, dream about Tony, and wait for death to come knocking.
, Steve. Do you understand that? How fucked that is? And even if you hadn’t, you lied. For years. Not weeks, not months. Goddamn years.” Tony balls his hands into fists at his sides. His voice is too loud and people are staring from across the street, peering over their glasses at the insane man screaming on the sidewalk. But he can’t seem to stop. “How dare you!”
“It can’t be wrong.” Bucky would mutter, buried to the hilt in Steve’s body, hands sweaty on his hips and back, simultaneously propping him up as he shoved him down onto the thin mattress. “Nothin’ this good could be wrong. Nothin’ wrong about you, Stevie.”
Surely, they wouldn’t, couldn’t—
Bucky had ripped his shirt right off his body, which, rude, but also hot as hell. Anticipation shivered down Tony’s spine as four hot, heavy hands worked him over slowly, rolling over his person as if they could massage pleasure into every crease and crevice.
Tony sleeps. Actually sleeps.
Peter sighs, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck. “I told him if he did anything to hurt you again, I’d suffocate him with my new super soldier web fluid.”
“Send them to Pepper when you’ve signed them.”
“I—Just, hold on.”
“You don’t fight fair.” Steve grits his teeth, rolling his forehead against Tony’s clavicle. “When we’re done, I’m going to fuck you right in the street. You hear me, Stark? Right in the street where everyone can see you and know that you’re mine.”
Now, their song wafts through the Compound, and Steve can’t hold back the tears as Tony looks into his eyes and tells him every way he has and will love him for the rest of their lives. He hopes that this feeling never fades, that Tony’s love is always shocking in its vastness, and that until the day he dies, Tony will always steal the breath from his lungs and breathe life back into his body with just a passing glance.
“Thank you.”
“Tony,” Steve groans low in the back of his throat and suddenly there’s a sharp, prodding tongue between his cheeks, lapping at his entrance and shoving inside the tight ring of muscles.
“Isn’t that a pretty thought.”
“What do you say, Petey? Maybe we can build him something better together?”
“I can’t lose another one of our kids, Tony.”
“The letter?”
Whenever he opens his mouth to speak, Tony kisses his harder. Silencing him with deep sweeps of his tongue because he doesn’t want to hear it. Not yet.
So why does even thinking the words leave his breath catching in his throat and his heart racing in his chest, pounding against the back of the arc reactor as if it might escape through his ribcage and run back to Steve at the first chance?
“Then at least stay with me. I’ll be your date, like old times.” Pepper sways into his space and lets her elbow knot between his ribs. He forces a smile. “He’ll leave you alone.”
Steve is infuriating like this. In a perfect world, Steve would just give Tony the answer. There’d be no cause for concern because Steve has a tactical head on his shoulders and could provide Tony with the best plan of attack and a series of secondary plans if needed. It would be so much easier if Steve would just tell him what he thinks, because Tony knows he has an opinion he must be dying to share. He
Steve gagged, his body moving of its own accord, carrying him back to the other corner of the bed as he stared at Tony and the distance between them widened like a chasm. Everything they’d had, all the love, all the trust, swirled and contorted into a whirlpool, circling down the drain until all that was left with Steve and his hands, dirty from where they had touched Tony’s sleeping, vulnerable body.
Tony almost chokes on his drink, laughing at Nat's insinuation. "With who, exactly? I live in a matchbox room in an Omega hostel, Natasha, where would I even fit any whelplings?"
The food's good, and the company's even better; Tony's leaning against Steve as the group watches Thor and Sam try to out-do each other in karaoke, both ridiculously belting out the words to Jolene.
idk maybe
"We made it official this passed Winter. Figured we couldn't keep living in sin anymore, and I wanted to make an honest man out of Bruce." Thor flashes his band, plain gold, but in a town like this, might as well have been encrusted with rare gems. Steve runs a longing finger over chain around his neck.
"Yes we ar-"
"Yeah, well you should all mind your own business. You'd swear I was asking you to give me his social security number and his mother's last name," Steve mumbles, petulantly frowning and staring back at the boy who was now alone, Danvers and Rhodes sneaking up the stairs as they usually did at parties, whether they were off or on. Steve's not sure where Janet went off to, but new boy has slinked back against the wall.
"Do you promise?" he asks softly, voice thick with unshed tears.
"A friend? Why doesn't this friend ask me themselves?"
Tony sighed, swinging his legs over the bed and walking over to the washstand. Pouring water into the bowl, he washed his face of sleep, hoping the puffiness would subside before he left for work.
"Should I expect you to be running after little whelplings soon too?" she asks coyly, circling the rim of her scotch with a finger.
"Not my fault you lot have been trying to push us in a box for centuries, besides, an Omega's weapons are courtesy and wit after all."
"Ye-Yeah, I brought you some cocoa." Sam walks over, setting the mug down next to Steve before sitting down on the edge of his bed, wringing his hands. "So, Bud... are you good?"
Riri turns out to be a great partner (not that Peter ever doubted it), and they manage to cut their ideas down to a shortlist of five projects.
@artingrogers
"Rhodey, just try to understand, you wanted my explanation, and I gave it!"
I'll call him. It's irresponsible of him to just ignore this.
"Oh yeah, I'm a real old-fashioned kind of guy, and just to prove it further, I'm going to give you my jacket - not only because you look like you're freezing, but because I'm chivalrous and shit, you know."
It took six months, three days and several hours to stabilise Tony and the baby, to a point where they could be transported between hospitals. Once Stark had been stabilised in Siberia, after several emergency surgeries just to keep him alive, and the doctors were sure flying wouldn’t further deter his health, he had been flown to Helen Cho’s new facility in South Korea, supposedly for further treatment, according to her source. The baby had gone with, and so had Rhodes, who hadn’t left Tony’s bedside since arriving in Siberia months ago.
"Oh, well... that's something."
"That depends on my business partners, and shame on you for trying to bully a poor farmer out of his well-earned gold."
"Personal computer," Clint says, melting into giggles with Sam.
"Either you put on thigh high boots and get a landscape painted on your back to protest corporate greed killing the planet, or we eat you first in the revolution."
"You've been doing that a lot lately," Reed said, leaning against Tony's workbench.
A hand comes down on Steve's shoulder, laughter ringing in his ear, and Bucky's signature stubble rubbing against his cheek.
"Who was that?" N.A.T.A.L.I.E. asks through her earpiece.
"Huh?"
@ArtDecider
"Hey, Stark."
"If they step foot in the US or in any of the ally countries, they're toast. Besides," Tony walks over to window, spying Harley and Happy shooting hoops, "they won't know where Natasha's being held."
"So what do we do?"
When Tony had boarded the ship West, he didn't have anything going through his mind except survival and the distinct brand of bitterness that came from having everything he worked for stripped away. The mirage of freedom and spark of hope had died as soon as he stepped foot on the dock, one of only three Omegas besides the captain's son on board. The crowd they'd sailed with was rough, mostly young men in search of opportunity and a new life among the golden banks in the West.
"Hey there."
Breakfast goes over well, and by the time they sneak into the cinema, the trailers are already rolling. They have a couple's lounger in the very back, and Tony slyly notes the emptiness of the theatre.
"N-No worries, Tony. What you said was mild compared to Bucky whenever he's losing at something."
Tony smiles, then dives in for a kiss, sweet and unrushed and Steve is clumsy in catching up and returning it, still regaining his faculties from sleep.
They both turn their heads when they hear sputtering, a red-faced Steve shying over to the bar. "Sorry, I-I was just topping up our drinks."
- violence (as in people get sh*t, not too graphic, it's from Tony's pov and he has his eyes closed)
Tony pats his cheek softly, running a thumb over his cheek. "Morning, Prince Charming, I didn't mean to wake you," he says, sliding all the way off the bed and rummaging around the room for his shoes. "You can go back to sleep, Steve. I'll see myself out."
Steve spends an unnerving few minutes powering up his ancient laptop, tapping the mouse furiously as if that would help speeds things up.
"I know that, dad. You've always been." Peter pulls Tony into a hug, and for a short moment, the rest of the world goes quiet.
- Tony is currently going through a really rough depressive episode, and this chapter is a bit heavy!!
Steve smiles at him
"Tony, what's wrong?" Steve finds the man sitting in the wicker chair on the porch, face turned to the sun.
"Yeah that's fine, thanks." Tony pulls the duvet up, tucking it around Peter. Despite his feverish temperature, he's shaking like a leaf.
"Okay..." Steve says trailing off, feeling a little suspicious. In their house, no one respected anyone enough to knock, even when social cues absolutely dictated that they
"Only that we want what's best for you both. You're our friend too, and we want to see you just as happy as we want him to be, and if that's what you do for each other, who are we to intefere?" Bucky stated, turning to face Tony. "But you have to know that Steve is... fragile in a way, a way he won't show anyone. I know he's big-lookin' and it seems he can shoulder the whole world's burdens, but he can't. And I'm not sure he'd be able to stay whole if you broke his heart."
And don't worry guys, no redemption for the Rogues, as voted by you 🤧
"Okay, sorry to burst your bubbles, but none of you are really my type - except maybe Thor, but he's also a little bigger than I'm into," Tony says, rolling away from the groaning lump on the bed and almost braining himself on the nightstand. "Besides, I here to see Steeb."
Balling his fists up, Tony takes a deep breath. "That's not what I'm doing here, I know what it looks like, but I promise I'm not that naive." Tony couldn't just release Natasha back into the unknown, she was most of that group's brains anyway, and without her, they couldn't go getting into any major trouble.
"Yeah totally, I have some ideas rolling around, so we can spitball and combine the best of ours, and my dad said it'd be okay if we asked him for help."
The first time was the hardest, but every other nameless foul-smelling Alpha after him had been easier. Some of them were even gentle, littering Tony with kisses or stroking his hair until he feel asleep, but none had been as charming (or deceiving) as Ty Stone.
"We've been plowing and planting the fields for a few years, Bucky's been seeing opportunity in starting a grape arbour, so we've been trying to clear that area over there." Steve pointed to the land at the end of the property.
"Interesting; there are great places in Manhattan, would you be interested in going to any of them?" Sam asks, smiling at her unguarded.
Shoving himself to his feet, Tony grabs onto a jagged rock as he goes. "Any other night I'd be more than happy to join you gentlemen, but tonight just won't work. I was trying to pick some berries for a pie, but I must have been too deep in my thoughts and trailed off," Tony starts, thankful his voice remained steady. "See, my husband just got back from fighting in the East, he's a colonel in the army."
"Tomorrow, don't worry."
"This just isn't working anymore, Steve. I-I'm not happy."
When Steve eventually drags himself out of bed, head throbbing and feeling like an animal crawled into his mouth and died, he can barely function. Throwing himself down in a stool beside Thor, he curses himself for mixing his alcohol last night, all the while eyeing the guy's mouth-watering plate.
"What does that mean?" Steve interrupts, poking his head out of the wagon to stare at the two men.
"Okay," Steve says defeated, deflating in his chair and going through his notes again when Sam leaves.
Tony takes a deep breath and looks up, his eyes wet but unwavering. "Steve, please."
"It tastes like cow puss, and you know it, Mr Lebeau."
"You should approach him, Steven. Maybe he'd be interested in joining your frat?" Thor smirks, patting Steve on the back before going off into the crowd - probably to ice those ribs - and Steve might just take him up on his suggestion. The poor kid does look lonely, and it was Steve's duty to get people interested in pledging for their frat. So what if he didn't really
"I agree, he doesn't seem to remember our talk today, so maybe if he wakes up, it'll stay that way?"
"Me walk you?" Steve asks sleepily, already curled around his pillow again.
"I can't promise that, baby, because we don't know how severe Peter's condition may be, but how about I promise to let you be the first one to know any news?"
"And what would this cost me?"
Steve laughs when he gets back to find Tony propped up on an elbow, stroking his dick languidly. "Strawberry scented lotion," Steve shows him the bottle, before grabbing the rubber they'd discarded to the side and tearing it open with his teeth.
"Of course. Only telling me to keep my filthy paws away from your friend."
"Isn't Tony older than him though?"
"Friends of a friend."
"By yourself? No. With our help though..." Sam trails off, sitting crosslegged on Harley's bed.
"Sweet, I owe you bro."
"Of course not, Tony." Bucky looked at him with pitying eyes, rubbing his back with a big hand. "Maybe you just need some time apart to figure things out."
"Thanks, Steve. You can give Bruce your congratulations when you get those herbs for Bucky. Let's settle up."
"Of course, Steve. Excuse my foul mouth." Tony winks up at him, taking a sip from his drink and letting the taste roll over his tongue.
"It wouldn't work, Rhodey. Neither of us are in the business of forgiving, and they're in no position to make demands."
"No," Steve says, flinging the quilt off of himself and getting out of bed to approach the man. When he reaches out to him, Tony turns away, still avoiding his eyes. "Tony, look at me."
Tony quirks an eyebrow. "Do you mean the drunkards who are too busy trying to get a knot off that they sometimes walk into the sheriff's office thinking it's Nat's?"
"Huh?" Steve asks distractedly, willing himself not to groan at the freezing monitor.
"Hey."
"Bu-but-"
Steve doesn't actually realise just how
At this angle, his neck is spraining, but the satisfaction of having Steve's dick in his mouth takes precedence, spurring Tony on to swallow him in deeper.
"You're not sleeping too well, are you? Those shadows under your eyes aren't from one or two nights of missing sleep," Natasha says as she drives her fingers into Tony, and hand playing with his hair. "You're just feeling sad aren't you, baby?"
When Tony had had his fill, and his groggy mind finally shook away the cobwebs, an alertness settled over him. "So, to who do I owe my thanks?"
When he finishes and she walks over to her basin, returning with a wet cloth, the shame and embarrassment finally sinks in. "Nat I-"
"Two hundred and twenty six attempted hacks this week, and that's excluding the phishing emails the accords lines have been harassed with for the past month. Everything we do know has to be on a need-to-know basis, it's enough that you're pushing for that woman to get better than what she deserves. Can she even be rehabilitated? We can't just lock them up forever."
There's a few lights on down the hall from his room, and Tony can hear one of the showers running in the bathroom in Steve's section. He pauses before twisting the door open, smiling in satisfaction to find it unlocked, but empty. Thor must have been right.
"Dad?"
"Sam? Why'd you knock?"
"How was your day?" Steve whispers, fingers curling in the hair at the base of Tony's neck and smiling at him so softly, and so openly.
"No I wasn-"
"You took the suit out for a joy ride and we covered for you, that extracts a heavy price."
From: MJ
"He always does, things even got better once he got the liquid valium last time."
"In the mid-West they either build short fence-like structures and have their grapes grow in tightly-packed rows, but since you want an arbor, we're going to have to use some of those longer posts," he continues. "I'm thinking ten feet at the least."
"It might not, but even then, at least if then they'd be locked up and can't do any damage."
"You seemed a little upset when you stormed in earlier, are you okay?"
"I'm only saying, if it came down to it, I don't think Steve will be able to survive you if you left. He's genuinely happy now, and that's definitely in part thanks to you, but... he needs to be happy by himself too."
Steve snuffles in his sleep, his eyelids fluttering. Tony can't help himself, he throws his phone across the bed and leans forward to peck kisses up his smooth chest, a sneaky hand trailing up his stomach.
Jan is passed out in his room, and really he should have joined her because he can never make good decisions on his own when in an inebriated state. Fumbling to get his phone out off his pocket, he taps out a message clumsily, erases it, types it out again with an emoji to lessen the blow.
"You're right, Sam, he could be a deadringer for teenage Steve, I don't know why I didn't see it before."
Letting out an exasperated sigh, as if he was stupid, Bucky goes back to staring at the group across the room. "You know, like when you date a lot of people at the same time. Sisterwives, Stevie. Polar game!"
With no hope of getting back to sleep, he gets up and walks to the lounge, stopping in front of Peter's door when he notices the light from underneath.
I'm horrible for taking so long to update this, I know!! :'( Please forgive me and enjoy a change of POV. Progress has happened and we touch base with the Rouges. TAGS UPDATED. Check out END NOTES for POSSIBLE TRIGGERS.
Which brought him right here to Bumfuck Nowhere, California. By the little town there were no golden beaches California was known for, only farmland that stretched for miles on end, and a never-ending sense of nothingness. It was a good life nonetheless, a little predictable and bland, but rather that than spending the rest of his life getting whored out or beaten to a pulp. Here he could come to the smithy and pound away all his frustrations; he could go by Thor's and buy a roll of yarn to start his knitting projects (because he finally had all the time in the world to do it), and even take part in town fairs as crazy and country as that sounded.
him, that much is clear, and Tony hasn’t felt this depth of love, maybe ever. But late into the evening, sated and half-asleep, hints of uncertainty churn behind Steve’s vibrant blue eyes. He’s holding something back and Tony can’t figure out why, or what.
, Tony thinks, feeling a sneer unfurl across his face. Sam, one of the few people capable of getting through to his darling ex-husband, and he doesn’t even try.
. I would have known, but if I hadn’t made it, you couldn’t have handled that. It wasn’t about me at all.”
“Can we try tomorrow, at least? To talk? Please, Tony?” If only Steve didn’t look so desperate, limp cock out, sweat running down the side of his jaw and disappearing into his beard, it would be easier to say no.
“No. That’s enough. I’m not doing this now.” He rubs absently at the scar beneath his shirt, swallowing hard.
“He probably is.” Steve had agreed.
Tony snorts, because of course Steve. Of fucking course.
That sounds like the best thing that’s happened to Tony in weeks. “I’d like that. So, what’s up, sugar bug?”
“I’m not!” Tony crows, breaking out into a grin. “I’m making Barnes sand those out tomorrow. Can’t wait to see the look on his face when I tell him how you—”
It doesn’t make sense. Steve can feel Tony’s fingers curling in his hair
Tony moves like water, flowing around him, going easily when Steve lifts him onto the counter and steps between his legs. His thighs grip like a vice, tugging Steve to him with heels pressed tight into his ass and digging in until Steve can feel Tony, half hard in his jeans, rolling up against him.
Tony had seen the signs from the beginning and ignored them.
Steve glances up to meet his eye and there’s a shimmer of tears there. The uglier emotions roiling in his stomach stops Tony from reaching out and holding that beautiful, desperate face. He wants to kiss the tears from his cheeks and assure him it’ll be fine, but he can’t yet.
That’s exactly the point. Maybe Shuri has something else in the works for him back in Wakanda. But all the same…
Amy-Amanda smiled, gentle and understanding. “Alright, hurry along, it’s lasagna on the menu. And remember there’s group tonight. Maybe you’ll share something with us?”
“Have you met yourself?” Steve slides a hand below the sheet where it’s pulled taut across Tony’s hip. The scrap of fabric does nothing to hide his own hard-on, and Steve’s thumb traces idly in the crease of hip and thigh. “We don’t have to. That was a lot.”
Tony’s grin widened. “Did I kiss you stupid?”
Is this letting go? Will it finally be out of his system after this?
“Put him on the damned phone, Rogers.”
“Tell him I’ll stay in Wakanda.” Bucky had said gruffly. “Go back on your own and work things out with your O.”
“Steven, I don’t think—” Steve knocks aside the hand Thor is trying to lay across his shoulder and pushes past him. He barks out an order to JARVIS to take him down to the workshop where he punches in his override code and seals the place down. Full blackout.
The abrupt change of pace startles him, and he can’t look away while Steve pauses and then eventually adds, “
“You want me to do the work?” Tony asks, glancing up at him when he pulls off and starts unbuckling his own pants. “Or do you want to do the honours?”
“Get him ready for you, Bucky,” Steve, always quick to whisper orders framed as suggestions, told the brunet as he knelt at Tony’s side, pulling back one of his thighs. A whisper of a gasp escaped as Steve held him open wide, giving Bucky perfect access to his hole and making him shudder.
Steve shakes his head and leans back on his hands, glancing up at the ceiling. “You have too much faith in me, Tony. Everyone does. I don’t deserve it.”
He grips Steve’s forearm when it enters his space and holds on tight, to pull him closer or push him away he couldn’t say.
Peter is… surprisingly unsurprised when Tony ‘spills the tea.’ He elaborates that he’s known something was up, because why else would the Rogues have been pardoned? Why else would international law be conveniently ignored, even for a short while?
“Come here.” Steve hauls him backwards towards the roadster, leaning back against it as Tony eagerly finishes unbuttoning his pants. He shoves them as far as they’ll go, tangled around Steve’s ankles, and then he drops to his knees.
“Hey, hey what is it?” Tony scrambles forward, concerned, but Steve just tugs him into his arms. He can still see him that very first time Tony kissed him, when he tasted like Mediterranean spices and hot sauce and sweet, delectable honey. When things were new and fresh but practically nothing in the face of all they’ve built together.
Steve had followed Tony’s remains across the U.S., spending too many days sitting at the base of the Tower in New York and lying in the grass in the Malibu sun. After Pepper and Morgan had travelled back to the city at the end of the summer, Steve had even let himself rest, his legs dangling off the dock at Lake Tahoe. As he stared up at the shuttered lakehouse the water had slowly turned his toes blue until he’d been forced to turn away.
Sitting on the curb like an overgrown child doesn’t do him any favours; Steve looks miserable.
“Oh, Tony.” Steve’s prostate lights up his body and every muscle strains and releases as Tony thrusts into him at a controlled pace until Steve’s body is relaxed and open under his hands. Running his metal fingers up Steve’s abdomen, Tony rolls one of his nipples until Steve is making little hitching gasps and takes the briefest moment to suck the tip of Steve’s cock into his mouth before he crawls further onto the bed, pressing Steve’s legs apart.
Tony jerks up, breathing hard. His eyes are unfocused, scanning the bed, then the room, then following the trail of Steve’s arm to his face. He’s white as a sheet and drenched in so much sweat the sheets are damp from where he was lying.
Being clothed helps him heave his defenses back into place and he feels himself put distance between them, shoving Steve back onto his side of the line and telling himself already that this was a mistake. That now he’s back at square one with a broken heart and a stomach full of rage, blackened around the edges with sorrow and grief.
Now… now was another story.
“L-love you,” he forces out.
He takes deep, steadying breaths.
Steve glowered at Clint. “You just had to be a jerk, didn’t you?”
Tony took the picture from him. “This is fantastic, Steve. We’ll hang it in the workshop.”
Tony shuddered. “Gross.”
“I don’t want to talk anymore, Steve. I just want to feel you. Can we just—”
“Tony, I don’t think—”
The first time his world had tilted on its axis, Steve had thrown himself into his work. An alien invasion had been more than enough to take his mind off the sheer propensity of his losses. And then there was Tony.
Somewhere along the way, Tony has settled. The burnt knot in his chest that was his marriage has grown smaller with time, and though he carries it with him, it no longer weighs him down. After Thanos, the world was in chaos, and Tony was tasked with fixing as much as he could, technology abound as he tackled food crises, infrastructure crises, the oil crises that forced the world into a globalized green energy era.
“Cap, pay attention,” Tony snaps from across the gymnasium.
“Just—come on,” Tony rasps, bracing a hand on Steve’s chest.
Tony looks up at Steve, and there’s something mischievous in his gaze. “Now one for Pops, kiddo.”
He reaches into his sweats and fists himself, rough and dry. It’s too tight but in seconds he’s coming hard, thinking about Steve’s bright blue eyes and the sweet taste of his mouth.
Everything else before that–well, it feels smaller now and maybe he didn’t deserve that after all.
In no time, FRIDAY had had a massive shipment of items from weighted blankets, to adult colouring books, to scent diffusers. She’d selected some inspirational quotes that were just on the right side of cheesy, contained in crisp black frames along the walls.
Tony meets his kisses with increasing urgency until it’s a push-pull of trying to get Steve out of his clothes and inside Tony as quickly as possible. He grunts in frustration when Steve refuses to shove into him with only spit slicking the way, grumbling in Steve’s arms as he plucks Tony off the counter and carries him down the hallway to their bedroom. With dinner forgotten, Steve throws him down on the bed only to cover him again, running a hand up his side just to see him squirm.
“What if it never gets any easier?” He feels pathetic even asking, small and childish. Steve hardly recognizes himself when he looks in the mirror anymore. He’s been lost a long time. Adrift.
“You do like old things,” Steve agrees, and Tony laughs a little, setting the colourless reactor on his bedside table before shifting deeper into the blankets.
“Always together.”
“Hmm? What? Oh, uh, wagon wheels.” Tony offered distractedly, giving JARVIS a series of instructions that set the model spinning and twisting at double the rate, a rapid sequence of formulae appearing.
“Keep going, you’re close now,” Anita says. Steve can’t understand how she remains so calm and collected when it feels like his skin is ready to get up and walk right off his bones. When he steals another glance at Tony, he looks as dumbfounded as Steve.
“If I wanted a getaway car, I’d’ve called Happy,” Tony grumbles, and that’s when Bucky grins at Steve, using the hand Steve has on his shoulder for leverage to pull him in and clap him on the back, disheveling his tie in the process only to start fussing with it all over again.
Pepper always understands. God, she’s too good to him.
Peter darts across the ceiling, and Steve calculates his next move but he gives himself away, eyes dart left as he feigns right. Steve makes a note to address the way he tracks his movements at their next individual session, but now, he uses it to his advantage, picking up the pace over the warning Wanda is calling from across the room. Just as Peter turns, just as he launches himself out of Steve’s path, Steve lets the shield fly.
Where was he now, if he was anywhere at all?
The thought of Bucky inside him made him shudder.
It’s final.
Rhodey clasps a hand on his shoulder and gives him a tired smile as he makes to steer him towards the exit. The dark circles under his eyes are new, and Tony knows that the days are grueling for him in more ways than one. But he stays, all the same, a solid-as-steel presence that keeps Tony grounded.
“Do you like it?” Tony asks, sounding breathless.
“Don’t want to talk,” Steve mutters, capturing his mouth again and bucking his hips up to meet Tony’s.
He doesn’t let Tony up for air until they’re forced to gasp into each other's mouth, trading kisses that turn into a wet smear of mouth against mouth. Steve picks up the pace, shoving into Tony with a singular purpose, and reaches between them to wrap a hand around Tony’s cock which slides between his slick fingers and brushes against the soft curl of Steve’s belly every few thrusts.
“Show me. Show me the day he wrote the protocol.”
And he was going to have that with both of them.
Steve’s vows feel like a rushed thing, now.
“And neither am I.”
“You think this is funny?” She demands. Tony’s eyes go comically wide, and he looks at Steve for some form of back up. Steve just shakes his head; Tony’s gone and done it this time.
There’s hope that maybe, if they try, they’ll get there. God, he wants to get there.
She would have told him to stop letting himself waste away.
Bucky moves to walk past them, when Tony pivots into his space. “Did you want to try B.A.R.F.?”
They’d made it. Another trial, another tribulation, and they’d made it through together.
“Maybe it is. I don’t always make the right call. I’m not perfect either, Tony.”
The air in Tony’s chest feels marginally tighter.
“No,” he interrupts, “I’d never turn you in, not even after everything. So what does that say about me, huh?”
Everything swells around him and Steve’s vision blurs with tears again. The hand on his mouth slips down and Steve gasps in air before it’s back with Tony shoving two fingers into Steve’s mouth.
“Steve, if you wanted to wrestle you could have just said something,” Tony teases, trying to shake him off his legs. The team groans in their ears, and beneath the cowl Steve is certain his cheeks have gone red.
, Tony thinks, because he doesn’t fight it, just gives the wizard the floor, watching with a mask of blanketed indifference when Dr. Strange speaks. The wizard talks in blunt riddles about a coming threat, greater than Earth has ever experienced, and the potential for the end of the world.
“Steve, stop pacing,” Pepper says, voice tight with strain as another wave of contractions ripple through her. “You’re making my head spin.”
. Finding Barnes… Well, that’s something I could do. I can help you find him and maybe if he’s not a complete fucking cyborg murderbot, we can fix him. Then it’s not all for nothing, right?” Tony’s voice chips at the end but his eyes flash with a fierce warning.
Steve jerked his head towards the door, the illusion shattering in an instant. The intruder, Amy, or maybe Amanda, a large woman with streaky grey hair and an ill-fitting pair of scrubs, stood at the threshold.
Groaning long and low in the back of his throat, Steve let his head drop back, jerking Tony at the hips to meet one last sharp thrust as the orgasm washed away.
Tony can feel it in the way that his stomach doesn’t register hunger, and the cold has stopped aching in his extremities. The ache in his chest has disappeared too, it hasn’t hurt in days.
She pins him with a pointed look and he sighs. It’s not like he’s ever shaken off the Widow easy before. “I’m not mad at you, Nat, not really.”
“You just wanted to make me dinner?” He asked suspiciously.
Correction, it was hard to see them all becoming
Everything is falling to pieces around him.
“Apologies, Clinton, but it brings me great excitement to bear witness to another Midgard festival! Tell me, what is this Fourth of July?” Thor asked, not markedly quieter.
“Can we just sleep?”
“That’s it?” Tony eyes him with doubt.
He sighed, they never lasted.
“Are you okay?” Tony lays a hand on his shoulder, standing behind his chair. As Steve leans his head back, the hand migrates to his hair, pulling his head back against Tony’s stomach.
Steve caught a flash of white sheets and a gurney. The words
A smile that was saying goodbye.
When he’s dreamed about him before, Tony is always older and recalled from the part of his mind where Tony will remember Ultron and Siberia, all the secrets that Steve has kept along the way.
Everything becomes more exhausting after that.
“No. Do you hear me? No.” Tony scrambles backward when Steve tries to reach out for him shaking his head. Pain erupts behind the arc reactor and Tony’s left hand startles away with a series of violent tremors and it’s supremely unfair that Tony should have a still-painful prosthetic on his right, and nerve damage and tremors in his left.
“But if it doesn’t…”
It’s the wrong thing to say.
Or maybe that’s just because this is Tony.
Over Pepper’s shoulder, Peter is shaking a dozen hands under Sam’s proud gaze without a shred of nervousness. He’s all eagerness and the humble ‘oh shucks’ of youth and Tony adores him for it.
FRIDAY turns the lights on soft, and low, and Steve sinks down onto one of the couches, letting Tony settle himself in whatever way is easiest. Everything is screaming at him to curl up in Steve’s lap, drape himself across him and never let him go, but it’s not quite right. Not yet.
“Please, Tony,” Steve begged, desperately trying to determine some course of action.
Tony took a deep, shaking breath.
“This is a bad idea.”
“Steve!”
He doesn’t speak.
Tony hummed a soft sound, hands tangling in the creases of Steve’s t-shirt.
The question bounces off the inside of his skull and sits heavy in his stomach.
“I didn’t think I would ever have this.” Once he starts, the words spill out of him like the tears slipping down his cheeks. Tony kisses them away, chasing after them as they drop and pool in his clavicles. “I wanted it, but there was never time to think about it. And then I woke up, and everyone I knew—everyone was gone and I— I didn’t think I would have this. Didn’t think
“I don’t, but I do want you to start getting it. Are you getting it yet, Cap? I’m telling you that the way you’re acting—the way you were acting when I got here tonight—that’s all Howard. That really the kind of man you want to be?”
Peter had been so angry when Tony had told him the Rogues were coming back. It had been a toss-up between the fact that Peter had had to find out about it all on the news, and the fact that Peter was one of a half dozen people who knew what had happened in Siberia.
“I love you, too. Fuck, Steve, of course I do.”
On the deck, the storm raged on and the sea continued its assault against the horizon.
doing this? I didn’t ask you to wait here. I didn’t ask for this conversation. I’m just trying to figure out how to be happy, alright, Steve? I just want to move on.”
“Stop.” Steve’s mouth snaps shut, the muscle in his jaw straining as he grinds his teeth together. It must be killing him, and Tony curses the hope that curls in his stomach and nudges at the mockery of a heart behind the reactor.
And then something happened.
“You’re beautiful.” Steve turns and smiles at him, something so warm and hopeful dancing in the blue of his eyes that Tony almost forgets that he can have this now. Steve. After all the wanting, it’s happening.
Exhaustion creeps into his bones as Steve picks them off one by one until the fighting is over and the team starts to trickle out from the surrounding blocks. They fall into a half-circle around Steve and he takes a quick inventory of potential injuries, pleased when everyone seems to be mostly alright.
“Do you…” Tony trails off, his eyes flickering back up as he moves marginally closer, the tip of his tongue darting out to touch the corner of his lips.
He watches, smiling a little as Tony shows her how to peel the sections of a clementine apart. The fruit squishes in Morgan’s pudgy fingers, but she gets the hang of it on the second one. The first slips around her plastic plate, and some lands on the floor for Steve to tend to later.
“You never say you’re sorry, you know that? You have to know that by now. Not ever. I can count on one hand the times I’ve heard you apologize, and even then, nothing changes. You don’t do anything differently. It’s just empty words.” Tony’s lip curls back in distaste. “Empty words, empty promises.”
Tony clamps a firm seal over the part of him that wants to hop onto the defensive, to remind Steve that he’d had no reason to give him the time of day anyhow. He reminds himself of the closed door in his face and takes a breath, letting Steve’s actions speak for him.
Steve smiled down at the pot of boiling water in front of him. “Oh Tony.”
The schematics make sense, but he just can’t quite get it right without Sam feeling like he’s lilting to the left. At this point, Tony is pretty sure Sam
“We already talked about this. Don’t be that asshole.”
Streams of coding continue to flesh out between pauses where Tony stops to crack his knuckles and stretch out his neck. He carries on that way for the better part of a half hour while Steve sits there, numb, watching with a renewed sense of horror settling in his chest.
“F.R.I.D.A.Y.,” Bucky interrupts sharply. “Pull up a picture of the Starks.”
But not this time. This time, Tony had other ideas.
“I’m going to suggest your formal Captain’s uniform. Purely selfish, I just want to see it up close. But that’s my suggestion.” Tony himself blinks once and his clothes disappear into a suit, all sharp lines and sleek angles. He’s a sight.
The sleeping pills.
Time stopped. Steve fumbled a hand onto Tony’s pulse point, eyes roving over skin that was too ghastly pale to mean anything except—
“Say it,” Steve gasps, forcing himself to keep his eyes open because he doesn’t want to miss this. “Tony, please, just—”
Dying doesn’t feel like as much of a loss as he expected. Maybe more of his heart was already here than he realized.
The revelation burns his fingertips and he powers down the soldering tip with a curse. DUM-E offers an empathetic whirr, and the fire extinguisher rolls across the ground at his feet.
Tony jolts awake too soon, a hard-on rampant and demanding attention between his thighs for the first time in months.
Tony shook his head. “Won’t change anything.”
Somehow, they manage to get through unscathed and then Pepper is there, setting her hand on his forearm and leading him off the stage. The frequency of her touches isn’t lost on him, and Tony knows exactly what she’s about. Pepper always knows what he needs, even before he realizes it himself.
“And what did you… I mean did you…?”
He springs out of bed with as much speed as he can at this advanced age. Steve is tired. The type of bone-weary tired that makes every breath a battle and every footstep a trek through layers of quicksand. It feels like his time must be coming soon, and when it does Steve will be ready.
“What the fuck are you doing?!” Steve ignores him, knocking his feet out from underneath him the second he’s upright again. “Steve, stop! Stop!”
“Steve! So nice to hear from you! I feel like I haven’t seen you in ages.” She greeted warmly.
He resists the urge to close his eyes, prepares himself to soldier through whatever else Tony has to offer. Steve waits for the bite of Tony’s malice, to find out that Tony’s been lying all along. Maybe he’d never meant to help him after all.
Tony froze, the project immediately abandoned. “What?”
Then Steve collapses in a heap, his last brain cell working to keep his weight off Tony’s decidedly smaller frame and as he presses their lips together, little more than a smear of lips, Tony whispers a babble of praise in his ears.
"Are you okay, sweetie? I'm pretty sure alcohol is supposed to loosen you up, love," the redhead says, tone carefully light. She'd seen this many times, even her strongest girls broke every once in a while, it's why she kept their hearts full and minds busy. Things, whether booze or pretty jewels or books to keep them busy, were material, yes, but for girls in their profession, it chased away the tendrils of darkness that every client left behind. Their work wasn't just hard on the body, but hard on the mind too, and she had lots of girls with dark pasts.
nope.
They hadn't exchanged numbers or spoken about hanging out again, so Steve didn't want to be the weirdo plaguing his friends for his info or stalking his socials if Tony didn't actually want to see him again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course I do, I see you guys getting dropped off together all the time."
Business first:
Steve absolutely does
"So, as new friends, we need to get to know each other better, right? How about we start with the basics, what's your favourite food? Do you like Italian?"
"Okay, I'm up for it. We can get breakfast since we'll be in the mall, it's still a little early."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh? That's real cute, Jaime, can I keep them all?"
"And people say Omegas are obsessed with our ages. Vanity isn't a good trait in marrying-age Alphas I hear."
"Tony," Steve corrects, swallowing the pills dry and soaking a slice of bread in the curry sauce. "And nothing happened; we smoked a joint, talked a bit and passed out. End of story, and not really anything for Rhodes to be worried about."
"Nervous?" Sue asks concerned, receiving a nod from Matt. "Enough to pull out of the agreement?"
Riri almost chokes on her water, before laughing nervously and gingerly putting the bottle down on her tray. "Listen kids, you guys are adorable, but I'm n-"
Finally, Reed comes down from the office, a bag of gold in hand. "Your week's wages, don't spend everything all at once now."
"I know you do, Baby." Tony chuckles, wrapping his arms around the boy.
He had gone to see her and she was just as beat up as her dad, the sight of all those tubes and machines broke his heart beyond explanation, and, with the nurses giving him the go ahead to hold her (she was tiny), he had teared up looking at the oxygen mask covering half her face. She hadn’t been given the best lot in life, but come hell or high water, she would make it, stubborn as she was. His father’s ring had slipped around her wrist like the bangles Ms Jones had always worn to church, clanging in tune with the band to send praises and hallelujahs to heaven. Rhodey had never known if he had ever truly believed in God, had spent years running from him and hiding from him - he had thought if he didn’t pray, didn’t say his name, God would simply not have been able to find him, that he would be safe from the all-seeing eye in the sky that wiped out all of humanity for disobedience and had men almost killing their sons to prove their loyalty. But, in that moment cradling the little one closer to his chest, taking calmer breathes to help her heart beat match his, and he should really stop calling them her, Tony would slap him with his research papers of the benefits of gender neutral terms and how they positively affect kids in later life, he can’t help but send a tiny silent prayer upwards, to whoever was listening, whoever would help, to help them through this and make them better. He had had several holy men come by to pray for them, the Imam leaving him with an “Inshaallah the baby will grow strong in body and heart, just wait, Allah helps all” and James had been holding onto those words for days now. Thankfully, they had been getting better, their everyday chats during the Kangaroo sessions made her weak heart a little stronger as the days passed and her lungs had been drained with success. This would be the perfect time for Thor to come back from wherever he had disappeared to, and give them a birthing blessing as he had done with Jamie’s birth. Deities and aliens, this little one already had him wrapped around their finger and praying to anyone for help, but he knew they would make it and grow to be tough, a Rhodes in everything but name (and genetics) through and through. They had been eager to enter the world but now had to regain their strength to face another day.
So when his chem partner, Riri, tells him they can't meet at hers after school to do their semester project, Peter internally freaks for about .3 seconds before his brain kicks back into gear and he reluctantly suggests that they can head to his. Riri is really cool, and all Peter wants is to be her friend, and she loves science just as much as he does (maybe even more) so he knows for a fact she'll love his lab.
Ty was a smooth guy, and if Steve hadn't seen it, he wouldn't even have noticed the change in his composure. "Yeah, of course. It was fun catching up with you, Marc Antony. We have to have dinner some time," he says, winking at Anthony and flashing Steve a grin. "You've been holding out on me, and Steve, it's great to see you back in the game, man. Tony's a real catch."
Hope you guys enjoyed it, what are your thoughts?? Please tell me what you think of the new developments 😏💛
"But dad!"
"Pete already ran it by us, and they have work to do, Harl. This jealousy doesn't look good on you," Tony says, reaching out to pinch his son's cheeks lightly.
"And this success... it would be getting Riri to date you?" Peter asks, waiting for their game to load.
"Oh."
oh i see how it is!!
"Oh, that- uh, right." Bucky is suddenly bashful, rubbing the back of his neck while red creeps up his neck. "So... some of the guys and I thought it would be a good idea to talk to you..."
"Literally no one is arguing, Steve. You need to turn in and realign your energies."
"I'm saying," Tony starts, a little desperation bleeding into his tone, "we need a unified structure amongst ourselves, and a few teams have already agreed."
"Trust me, these looks arrived overnight," Steve jokes, thinking back to his days as the scrawny kid always getting into fights. "Mom had me filling out on protein porridge to pick up some weight, and I guess I just hit a growth spurt one day, and boom - this happened," Steve says, gesturing to himself.
He didn't really know why he was thinking of these things, after all, if he wanted a family, he could have just stayed in New York. Still, as irrational as he knew he was being, it didn't stop him from feeling a deep rooted sadness.
