,” Steve says, inferno hands still griping the sides of Tony’s face, a thumb moving to press gently yet firmly at the corner of Tony’s left eye.  The thumb hovers a bit, brushing lightly over the lashes.  Tony helps by fluttering them so they brush over the pad of his thumb.
Spring comes, or so he believes. It’s bit hard to tell from where they are.  Snow is a constant thing, at this elevation.
They lay in the dark of the small cabin, on musty sheets, an inch of space between them, but it feels like a mile, an ocean.  A void of
“You’ll have to say, it was smart to have it here.  This is the closet RF tower to the Centers for Disease Control.  They have moles working there, who have coded all the canisters where they keep the old diseases.  You understand it better than I.  But from what Steve and Sam have gathered, they are at the point where they just send the signal from their site in the Sierra Navadas, it gets picked up through satellite, and gets put through this site, where it produces the frequency that would unlock the sealed specimens and release them before they can achieve lock down.  It gets to the airport, it goes international.  Smallpox, bubonic plague, everything.”
Thor escorted his mother down the walk (Odin shuffling close behind), and took his place at the platform that was serving as the alter, Loki and his jingling handcuffs at his elbow.
Steve could be doing this with anyone.  Tony doesn’t know if it would hurt worse to see him with someone else.
He has to admit that Stark has it under control.  He makes sure to catch every news story the man is on, and the entire set up is perfect.  Hair, suit, smirk, ubiquitous sunglasses.
“Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.  In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.  Blueberry?”
Bruce is exceedingly grateful in his humble way, slightly embarrassed when Tony thrusts it into his hands.  He has no other money, as the government seized his assets when he went on the run.  He uses it to furnish his living floor with calm, soft things, bamboo plants, and a bunch of yoga things, like a zen garden and a heavy hemp rug with huge, smooth river stones embedded into it, that apparently you walk on.  Bruce also purchases some nice kitchen things, a decent wok, bamboo utensils, and a frightenly large selection of special teas.  (Tony slaves away for a couple hours in his auto CAD to make a tea steeper that is of the Hulk resting his arms on the rim of the cup.  Bruce smiles and uses it all the time.)  He gets a decent wardrobe, soft button ups and khakis and a couple of nice suits and a tux from a tailor Tony recommends for press conferences and formal occasions.  After that, Bruce rarely uses the card for anything other than ordering supplies for the lab.
And wow, how amazing it was to call Tony his husband.  They’d been married for four years, but Steve knew he was never going to be completely used to it.  Waking up every morning to a scruffy, muzzy Tony was one of the best feelings in the world.  Tony often complained that Steve rated cuddling higher than sex sometimes, but Steve saw it this way: Tony had sex with a lot of people in the past.  He’d never actually cuddled with anyone before Steve.
He didn’t want to think about that.  Not now, not with Tony breathing trough a tube four floors above him.  “Maybe I’ll make him a little comic.  He loves those.”
“Look who’s back!” Carol shouts as she spots him, holding a three-hundred pound man in a bridal carry as she evacuates a building.
“The rest of you,” he calls over at the group of children the world relies on to save it, “let’s make this a smooth as possible. We’ll get Tony in, and we fall back as soon as he re-emerges.  Quick in-and-out, got it?”
It takes two days of sitting at a workbench, creating massive feats of engineering, trying to avoid thinking of
Tony cautiously walked up the stone ramp, the room all dark wood and tall windows, shafts of sunlight capturing the dust motes in their stillness.  Steve was sitting in one of the many hard burgundy benched chairs, staring at a spot on the floor near his shoe.
Ilya is quiet as he flips through the gigs upon gigs of pictures of dissected dragon corpses. Reports, trying to explain the creatures.  Guesses at what they can be used for.  Formulas for tranquilizers.
“But . . . soulmates.  The idea that there is someone . . . .”  Steve trailed off with a wistful sigh.  “I understand your doubt.  I share it to an extent.  But sometimes you see two people . . . . “  He threw an olive pit down the mountain.
After dinner, Thor’s Icelandic friends decided they needed to show the puny Americans how to drink and party, so Clint and Natasha had gone to put them to shame.  Sam just got shitfaced for the sake of it, and whenever he was turned down by anyone, he was good-natured about it.  Bucky sat at the bar, downing micro brews and fancy cocktails, and laughing whenever people fell over (which happened a lot).
“Tony, she wouldn’t kill you.   She loves you even if you drive her blood pressure up.  JARVIS, why does Pepper want to see us all?” Steve asked as he wrestled Tony out of his shirt so it didn’t stretch unevenly or break the seams.
But no. That wouldn’t do. He couldn’t reveal Iron Man to anyone, and as much as he might trust the stranger, it wouldn’t be safe to tell.
“About one.  There’s a better restaurant open during visiting hours, but the cafeteria here stays open for people with loved ones in urgent care or surgery.  The others are already down there.”
He could hear the crowds from the road. People recognized him, waving and cheering even while wearing another racer’s colors. Tony made sure to give a jaunty wave before slipping into the tunnel towards the pits.
“My father sent me here to learn from Steve how to be a king, and Steve has designs to make me one of his Alastors.  That’s it, really.”
two gunshots near the receiver, and Steve can recognize their unique crack, because of course Natasha prefers to use the guns made for her by Tony,
scattered the earth.  From it was born Aphrodite, the Kindly Ones, some races of giants, assorted nymphs, etcetera.  Supposedly, some of the blood landed here, and it may possibly be where the scythe Kronos used fell as well.  From the blood was born the first peoples who inhabited this place.”
The little girl who didn’t want the orange grabbed it from her father, skipping over and presented it to Tony proudly.  Tony dug his thumb into the peel, pushing until he was squishing the pulp, releasing the scent of citrus.  He shoved it under Steve’s nose.
Tony and Rhodey had practically been raised together, Tony’s nurse putting Rhodey in charge of watching him while they were playing and allowing him to sleep in Tony’s cot.  As they grew, it became obvious that Rhodey had inherited some of the family’s godly blood, manifesting itself in a well-disciplined military mind and the ability to be fully responsible in any assignment he was given.  There was a contingency plan that if something happened to Tony, Rhodey would become Howard’s heir.  Many people felt Rhodey would make a much better king, Tony included.
Tony wants to ask him to say it louder, but he passes the device across the table.  “Best GPS scrambling available.  No one can trace this unless you let them.  That includes me.  I don’t want the key.  But with this, I can forward you information.  Stuff I maybe shouldn’t have, stuff I shouldn’t know.  Stuff maybe I’m not allowed to interfere with.  But stuff that might be . . . interesting to you.  Got it?”
“Mother asked me if I would be willing to visit with you, to see how you have been doing. I apologize for not dropping by while you were with the shell, but my work takes me around the world for long stretches of time,” Ilya says in his light Ukrainian accent, and Tony can tell he has tamed it over the years.  “I hope you will excuse me, but I think you can understand my position?”  His lips quirk in a way that reminds Tony of Zoloto’s snout before he takes a long draught of his coffee.
“And my problems would still be here,” Tony groaned, rolling onto his back and throwing his left arm over his eyes.
“The big guy didn’t wanna walk in on you two fucking on the couch,” Clint called over from the table, as he plopped down and swung his boots up to rest on the edge.
Then he is lost in the damp heart of the Hindu Kush, billions of tons of rock, all ready to crush him.  A few years later, the house filled with stone crumbles into the sea.
“I did,” Steve says slowly, like he’s trying not to spook him as he sits down cautiously next to Tony.
they were avenging, but he could deduce it was some sort of vague ideal.  But the Alastors themselves seemed very vague.  It was probably best to assume that eventually he would be enlightened to their secrets (they seemed to
"How would you know?" Steve asked. "You haven't been through this. Nobody's been through this and instead of helping me out or trying to make me feel welcome or anything, S.H.I.E.L.D. has been keeping me locked up in an apartment with no one to talk to and nothing to do but read a few outdated, half-redacted files. Tony's the only one who's tried to help me so far despite being so sick and I'm grateful for that. Now, I'm not just going to let him go jump into a dangerous situation and hope for the best. I'm going to find him, and I'm going to help him. You can try to stop me, Agent Romanoff, but no matter what I'm not going to stop until that I know that Tony's safe and getting the care he needs."
"You realize that this is my business we're talking about here," Dante said. "You should take it more seriously."
.) Rhodey made pancakes and bacon, which was filling enough to tide them over for a few hours. After that, they just watched mindless TV until Pepper and Happy arrived to head over to the therapist's office.
When he finally did get back into his room, he slumped to the floor and struggled to catch his breath. He extracted the disc from his pocket and once again inspected it, albeit this time more carefully. He could see that the disc was stained black from the soot, but if he wiped it off it appeared to be light gray underneath. Pressing the button again, he watched as the compartment containing the shard slid out. Hesitantly, he touched his finger to the shard again, only to have the same experience as the previous time. He pulled his hand away as fast as he could and took the object to his desk, wondering what the hell it was and how it worked.
While Tony was talking to the girl, Steve looked around the huge open space they were in. It felt like the future with it's minimalistic style and grey and white color scheme. Directly across from where they were standing there was a sculpture that appeared to depict a waving flag made from many small squares of reflective material.
"Tell them to hurry," Natasha said as she started rushing towards the door. "And to keep Subarian in one piece. We don't have a lot of time and he's got the answers we need."
Clint wanted to laugh. He really did. This had to be some sick joke; a horrible one that the universe had decided to play on him for absolutely no reason. Sure, he's done some terrible things in his life – especially before he joined S.H.I.E.L.D. – but he couldn't imagine anything he ever did evening out to this.
"No," Natasha said. "I didn't. In fact, I specifically wrote that I could not recommend you for the Avengers Initiative at that time."
For a moment, she directed her gaze to the scenery passing by them but was interrupted when she felt something cold press up against the back of her hand. She turned to see Bruce holding her ice cream out to her.
"Well, yes." Knežević had to resist the urge to slam his head on the dashboard. "Don't worry about it. I've done this before. I won't get caught."
However, as the Church's membership grew, so did the crowds that came to attend the memorial services. Eventually, it became unfeasible to continue holding services on the sidewalk without obstructing pedestrian traffic so instead, they started gathering inside the tower itself. That worked out perfectly for Tony.
"She survived being exposed once," Hill said. "I'm sure she can survive it again." Tony wanted to point out how unlikely it was for a person's immune system to be able to fight of diseases as dangerous as Ebola and H5N1, but for the sake of everyone's sanity, he decided it would be best not to bring that up, especially right now.
"I have a crush on you." A wave of anxiety crashed over Steve as the fateful words came out of his mouth. "This isn't how I wanted to tell you, and it doesn't matter if you reciprocate or not. The reason why I was trying to keep my distance was that, for some reason in the back of my mind, I was afraid that if I gave any indication of that – no matter how subtle – S.H.I.E.L.D. or Loki would catch on and it would end in you getting hurt. That's all it was and I'm sorry I allowed it to escalate to the level where we were arguing and trying to hurt each other. That was probably more dangerous than any scenario I could imagine. Can you forgive me for that?"
Slowly, Tony felt Steve's hand come down on top of his. Steve gently ran a thumb over the back of Tony's hand as he looked up. When their eyes met, all Tony could see was a reassuring warmth emanating from those blue-green irises.
"Hello," he whispered so quietly that even with her enhanced hearing, Natasha could hardly make it out. She had to rely on her lip-reading skills in order to determine what he had said, and those were shit compared to Clint's. However, what Freeman said next wasn't hard to make out at all. His face completely dropped, and he shouted as loud as he could "
Special thanks to DiveTooDeep who commented and the guest who left kudos on AO3! It really means a lot!
"It might be paranoia," Bruce said. "But I can't help but wonder if they have some sort of ulterior motive in asking for her help."
"No offence to you or your Agent, Commander," he said. "But no one's gotten Sharpton to talk. Not even your other agents. What makes you think she'll be able to get something out of her?"
"No," Tony denied. "That can't be him. It's not possible. He died in a plane crash in 1945. He's supposed to be dead!"
"We've already had one attack today," she said as she politely shook his hand. "We don't want to risk another." Freeman frowned.
"You've been having nightmares?" Pepper was the first one to speak, to no one's surprise. "Why didn't you say anything?" Tony opened his eyes but directed his gaze to the ceiling.
Unsurprisingly, it was Carol. She had managed to stop herself before she flew into the next wall, saving it from complete destruction. She cleared a bunch of debris out of the way and stepped through the hole she had created. Looking around, she blew a loose strand of hair out of her face and tucked it back behind her ear.
"In the meantime," Hill said. "Why don't you all explain to me how this happened in the first place?"
"I'm not afraid to hit an old man," Tony said that, but he didn't mean that. In fact, he was more likely to push Steve up against the wall, kiss him until he couldn't breathe, and start ripping his clothes off.
successor, meaning that she wasn't under Mr. Stark's direct employment at the time and doesn't know the damage this woman has caused." Romanoff responded before Pepper could stop her.
Despite his anticipation for seeing Tony throughout the whole day, a big ball of anxiety burst in his stomach when the clock struck the magic hour of six. He didn't know the reason for it, but the emotion spread throughout his entire body at an exponential rate. He had to keep reminding himself that this wasn't a date and he was foolish to think otherwise until Agent Wylie showed up at his door.
By the time they got back to the hotel, Tony's mood had not improved. He stormed ahead of Steve after he got out of the car and wouldn't allow him to help him to their room. He only stopped at the door to their room because he forgot he needed the keycard to get in and tried to force the door. Steve stepped in and unlocked it before he could break anything.
"I'm sure," Jessica insisted. "It's Kingslayer Jellyfish venom. We only discovered those a few years ago. Your computer might not have it."
Which led to this moment: Tarquan listened as the Kree walked by, thankfully having not noticed his presence. He allowed himself to release a breath of relief before slinking out of his hiding place, heading towards the escape pods.
"I'm sorry." It came out muffled like she had brought her hands to her face in the pure horror of what she had done. "I can fix it! I'll put it back on the wall!"
"Because of whatever that struck the Tower?" The grogginess must have really had a hold on Clint, because he still wasn't quite getting it.
talking about his sex life…Well, it would be like Christmas came early for them and it was also why Tony was glad that the reporter never got a chance to bring up the sex tapes. Tony felt a little bit of relief at that. That was one less thing to worry about for now.
"She wants us out of her hair right now." Rebecca continued to stamp her feet and scream. "Would you knock it off? The neighbors are staring at us."
"That was Agent Romanoff's assessment of Tony Stark for the Avengers Initiative," he said. "Yet another tampered file."
"Just relax," Steve said. "It'll come." Things were quiet again for a few moments, until Tony felt the pressing need to ask something.
"I'm afraid we don't have time for that," Tony said. "Loki's going to open up that portal at any minute now and we all need to be ready to act in an instant. Now if you excuse me, I have a suit to fix."
"And you'd need a pretty up-to-date lab to even think about manufacturing this stuff," Betty said. "Plus, a boat load of money."
"Because if you don't, I'm going to have to restrain your arms." Tony raised his eyebrows suggestively.
"Okay," Stark said. "What's so private that we can't discuss it in front of our boyfriends?" Natasha rolled her eyes and covered her face with the palm of her hand. Clint could hear Cap give a warning "Tony" before he dropped out of the conversation entirely. Rather than be a part of the argument, he turned his attention back to the mail pile.
Just as she initially set out to do, Lara grabbed her purse and her sandwich and headed out the door. She didn't even stop to put on her shoes. She just left.
"Really?" she said. "Well then I'd have to inform you that there is a question as to this woman's identity."
The dollar store didn't sell jackets, though. (Well, at least not in adult sizes.) However, the cashier was helpful and directed her to the nearest Salvation Army Store. (Before you jump down Carol's throat for shopping there, she had no idea what they did.) There, she managed to find a coat that looked halfway decent and didn't smell like moth balls. After doing a better job at brushing out her hair with the hairbrush, she figured she looked okay enough to be believed.
"Yeah," Bruce said. "Well, she's Tony's assistant – that's how I know her – but we're friends. I'd say we're friends." A knowing smile crossed Betty's face.
Carol hesitated a moment as she approached the entrance. For a moment, she questioned whether the door was alarmed or if it really was open for the public. Pulling the door handle back, she found it to be unlocked and took that as all the permission she needed to proceed.
"Dr. Subarian?" Sharpton shook her head as if mentally berating herself for revealing the information in the first place. However, she was still able to continue.
The entire time he was watching the scene, Tony could feel a smile pulling at the corners of his lips. Although kids weren't his thing, he had to admit it was kind of heartwarming to watch that interaction. What really killed him though was the dad. He couldn't believe that someone would take their kid to bring a gift to their favorite superhero – especially with the prices they were charging for admission (all the profits of which were going to benefit the New York Battle Relief Fund.) That… Wow, that hit his feelings hard.
For a moment, Steve wondered if seeing a doctor would help, but he quickly threw that idea out. Although, yes, he was aware that the understanding of mental health and mental health treatment had advanced phenomenally in the last sixty years, the small, reptilian preservation instinct in the back of his head was screaming at him that he would be putting Tony in danger by doing that. He tried with all of his might to push it away, but when you have the memory of your mother tearfully describing a frontal lobotomy performed on a child in your head, it was kind of hard to quell that fear.
"Really?" Natasha asked. "This is fine? You're going to exhaust yourself if you keep pacing like this." Because if he was somehow infected (which Nat highly doubted either of them were as they had both been given some form of a Super Soldier Serum) it would make it harder for his body to fight off the infection.
"You know, you could talk to Happy and Pepper about this," Rhodey pointed out. "They seem really concerned."
"Alright," she said. "Is there anything I can do to help?" Pepper raised her eyebrows and began searching through her purse. She pulled out a navy-colored book with the numbers "2012" embossed in gold and several pages that were already worn.
"And we're not going to let it happen," Bruce assured. "We'll help you. You have our support, right?"
"It's okay," Steve tried to argue. "I can make you breakfast, then go back to bed." Tony shook his head, adjusting his position to better straddle Steve over the covers.
"So would the IRS," Lara added. "And the FTC, the Better Business Bureau… Hell it might even make the Secret Service hot and bothered enough to step in."
Eventually, Tony had to give up screaming and finally just accepted his fate. This was a battle he wasn't going to win. With one last extremely slurred "fuck you" to both the cops and the hotel owners, Tony started stumbling down the sidewalk. He wasn't sure where he was going, he just hoped they had booze there. …And, dry socks.
Steve, Clint, and Natasha did their best to fend off the Chitauri invading the streets. Steve was able to give orders to the NYPD to evacuate the media and those who failed to heed the evacuation notices earlier either to the basements of nearby buildings or down into the subway tunnels and to move back their perimeter to 39th Street. Meanwhile, Natasha covered Clint while he evacuated a stranded city bus. They were all able to hold their own for the most part, but all of them would have to admit that they were relieved when a certain God of Thunder showed up and struck down several opponents with one burst of lightning. If anything, it was going to give them the two seconds they needed to regroup and reassess the situation.
"Only when you're hiding behind a suit of armor." Tony's only response was a hard glare. Hill returned it in kind. "I know you have concerns over the authenticity of this man's identity, but you can't go in there. Not until we can ensure that it's safe for you to do so."
it is," Lara said. "Err, I'm going to have to work on that, now it sounds like a porno. Not the point though, do you need anything?"
"Probably not," Lara said. "But I have a friend from the Secret Service who lives in the city. I'll be okay.
Tony took a deep breath and squeezed his eyes shut. Realizing that was not going to help him to keep from snapping at her, he got up from his chair and headed for the door.
Once all the samples were taken and they finished their food, they were led down a long, isolated hallway. The florescent lights illuminated the bare white walls to be startlingly bright, making it impossible to see and seem like the space went on forever. Eventually it came to an end with a set of grey double doors and a doctor clad in protective gear. Despite the grim situation, he greeted them with a handshake and a smile.
As Steve's mother finished up wrapping up his hand, Mrs. Barnes appeared in the doorway, still looking extremely cross.
It made him want to skip through a field of flowers with a whole pack of puppies nipping at his heels. That was a good way to keep calm. The Hulk liked puppies. Hill was clearly struggling to keep her cool, though.
"Oh," he heard one of the more menacing voices say. "And when exactly did you get your medical degree, Agent Romanoff?"
"Captain Rogers, I assure you, your blood will be in safe hands." Steve's doctor – Dr. Fox – had an irritated note in his voice, which was nothing new, but hearing it directed at Steve ground against Tony's nerves a bit. "The serum is far too diluted in your system anyway. It would be impossible to separate it out, so you have nothing to worry about."
"Since Stark started to lose his mind and made his girlfriend CEO and a Russian traitor his secretary."
"I didn't think it was right for Dr. Wayne to withhold that information from Agent Barton," she explained. "That's why I told you right away; you had the right to know. Dr. Wayne disagreed. He wanted to wait until we knew for sure that it was Ebola and H5N1. I tried to convince him otherwise, but since I'm only here to consult on
Breakfast didn't start until six and they didn't need to be out the door until eight. This ensured everyone had a few hours to eat and get ready. However, since Lara wasn't going in front of any cameras herself, she had very little to do to get ready comparatively. So, with all the extra time on her hands, she decided to do it productively and headed out the door to do her job.
"Look on the bright side," he said. "At least we learned that the easiest way to tame the Hulk is to give him a puppy." Natasha looked up, giving Clint a confused look before turning to Bruce.
"Natasha made Chicken Spinnocoli," he said. "I saved you a plate. It's in the microwave." Steve frowned.
"Stark Industries," the lightly accented voice said. "You've reached Lara Conroy. How can I help you?"
Right as he was turning back to the now hot water and pulling the thing up from the faucet so the showerhead activated, he allowed a hand to ghost over the mass of scar tissue on his chest.  The false hope that his health issues would be over when they took the shrapnel and reactor out was gone.  Going into his final artificial skin graft, the doctors had asked to put him through a series of tests to make sure everything was good to go.
“Yup!” Jane chirped cheerfully, scooping the gurgling baby up from the blanket spread out on the floor.  Brandt tangled his fingers in her hair, but Jane didn’t seem to mind.  “Thor’s out too; said he wanted to get some meetings and such in so he could be with us all day tomorrow.  The four of us are staying in the Annie Oakley Room.  Bit of a squeeze, but it’s got two beds and we brought Brandt’s basket, so we manage.”
“Oh, yeah, hey, the growth of the car, and the introduction of the interstate system, that’s something you should look into.  A lot of culture shifts happened in the fifties and sixties because people could easily get pretty much anywhere.”
Steve deftly carried the pile over to the bed and laid it down, sorting towels and pillow cases and sheets into their respective piles.  “Well, we’re not going cold tonight.  Did the kids finish their baths?”
Taking advantage of the situation, Steve let himself trace the line of stitches across Tony’s chest and shoulder with his lips and tongue.  Tony gasped at the sensation, tears making his eyelashes stick together as he blinked blearily down, before immediately turning his head away, begging for more.  And of course Steve was helpless not to give it to him.
Steve had never appreciated another human being more since Bucky had held his hand out to the scrawny six year-old with blood coming from his nose.
It’s been instilled in him to feign sleep for a few seconds to assess a situation for possible dangers. Usually he’s only at home, in his own lab or bed, so it usually passes.  Hotels take a bit longer, but he can usually place it after a moment or two.  The times he’s woken in a hostile situation has made the practice worth it, saving his own life and others countless times.
Clever calloused fingers that knew just what to do, when to twist and pull and add pressure and take it away to insure that Steve was driven mad.  Tony, more than anyone, could make Steve lose his mind, in the heat of an argument or the throes of ecstasy.
The texture of rusting iron always intrigued him. It’s not pleasing in the slightest, but there was always some strange appeal to the powdery rough texture, and how different the dust was from sand or flour or something else. It was hard and metallic and
“Meaning we can’t tell you because we don’t know ourselves,” Nausikaa supplied helpfully.  Korkyra gave her a long-suffering sigh.
They ended up making out, before "I see you two finally got your heads out of your asses," rang out from the direction of the elevator.
.  You’ve been through so much that made you into the man you are today.  Alone.  Or with us.  It’s fine to want to find your family, but – “
Steve leaves for his first mission since they began their . . . arrangement.  He’s gone for five days, and Tony alternates between bingeing in the workshop and eating every carton of that new wine ice cream that they can find on the couch with Clint.
“A) Yes, I helped write them, but you didn’t see the first draft.  They could have been so much worse.  And B) there was never any choice.  It was sign them or stop hero work.  The UN isn’t the League of Nations.  The US can’t just do what it wants anymore.  We’re a big, powerful country, but we’re not the only one.  Every nation deserves to have its sovereignty recognized.  I’ll admit, we all played a part in setting the precedence.  But we could never operate solely on goodwill forever.  Yes, we saved the world from disaster.  Multiple times.  But you can’t tell people that they should just be grateful for us saving their asses.  The way the world is now . . . if a major crisis is averted, attention quickly shifts to the collateral.  Our job is messy.  But people nowadays . . . they take a lot for granted.  If we didn’t do what we do, we’d be called out for not doing our duty.  We can never win.”
They settled in, as they had gotten there pretty early, and started chatting with the other guests.  Clint was getting ready to grab Nat before she could start a wrestling match with Volstagg, one of Thor’s groomsmen, when it was announced that they should take their seats, as the ceremony would begin soon.
There’s red there, too.  Very dark, and only tiny rods amid the brown columns.  Dark, dark red, not purple enough to be called burgundy, because there is no cool color even hinted at.  Completely warm, almost too hot, like they could melt anything, and those sunglasses are protecting others, rather than him.
But Steve slides a finger into Peter’s plump fist, and the tiny fingers grip him surprisingly tightly.  He yawns, tiny plump mouth forming an “o”, and he opens his eyes.
One of his first memories was of the women, children, and old men waving off their warriors, packed into triremes and headed northeast, through the Hellespont and into the Inhospitable Sea.  Ever since there had been messengers, reports, urns in need of burial, as the remaining people tried to eke out a living.  It had been in his tenth summer when the first white sails of warships had appeared approaching the Piraeus.
Tony had been sent to boarding school at the age of seven, and had been home for the summer after he turned fifteen, planning on heading to MIT in the fall, when a drunken Howard had rammed the car he and Maria had been driving back from a gala of some sort into a tree.  At fifteen, Tony had been orphaned and became head of a company he had never been trained to handle.
He closed his eyes, and called up the memory, eleven years before, of the silken, silvery metal dome under his fingers.  The way it had seemed to reflect the reverberations of the blacksmith’s hammer up his own fingers and arms, rattling his skull.  He’d had so many questions for the smith,
He made a mental note to remember this for future masturbatory material, until he realized, once he was fully enveloped in Tony, who was making tiny, desperate breathy sounds, that this wasn’t a temporary thing.
It was a picture text, showing a chubby towhead baby of maybe three months.  In the corner of the frame, Steve’s teeth glinted in a wide smile.
“How are you settling in?” Tony asked eventually, voice quiet. There was no one to hear him, but he liked the feeling of secrecy and intimacy.
it World War Two.  The name came after I was frozen.  And people ask what World War Two was like, and for a second I don’t know what the hell they’re talking about.  It was just ‘the war’ to me.  And there’s this sixteen year-old volunteer telling me in monotone about scrap drives.”  Steve let out a half laugh, half sob.  “Like it’s ancient history.  Like I didn’t live it.”
“Have I ever told you?  If you weren’t frozen, Howard probably would have tried to make you my godfather.  I used to be so proud.  Godson of Captain America.”  He snorted and harshly pulled the toe of his purple sock.  “Now I think it’s just because you’re one of the only people who would have called him a friend.”
, but they couldn’t come up with four for everyone, so they cut it.  Still, they made a limited-edition batch, which we could auction off – ahh-ha!” Tony grunted as he pulled an industrial package filled with a dozen burgundy polishes.  “Pepper, take one.”
A dull sustained beep issues from the chest where he has the armor is stashed. A message.  Not blaring like it’s top priority, but insistent.
was ever content to sit at home in peace and plenty.  Tony had a theory, that there needed to be threats to one’s life if one wanted to feel alive.  In the ten years since the war ended, there had been no major conflicts, droughts, curses, anything that could compare to the tragedies and joys that had been brought to the city by messengers on quick feet, or the dusty battlefields that formed their history.
He’s always been impressed, because goddamn, that serum has the serious side effect of making Captain America into an actual sex machine, but it’s different, now.  They never put a name on it.  It just . . . happened.  They fell into bed, had mind-blowing sex, and aside from Steve making sure that Tony and Pepper were indeed on one of their frequent “breaks”, they never talked about it.  It’s wasn’t supposed to be . . . serious, or anything, just a means to an end.  The need to be close to someone, but someone who was just as much of a mess, someone who was too emotionally compromised to make something permanent with the other.  Relieving stress with someone who understood, someone who was too messed up for anything serious at the moment, someone who could keep a secret.
His mother liked geodes better.  Rugged exteriors that revealed sharp spears of color when cracked.  He disagreed with her, but would sit with her for hours to crack them open, investigating the contents with undiluted glee.
“Steve – “ Tony pleaded, wanting to know where this was going, before it went too far and broke him.
She smiled sadly, and as much as he knew he hurt her, he would be forever grateful to have her for a sister.
Steve hooks his boots around Tony’s wing joints and adjusts the mask to be readily accessible. “Ready?”
“Okay, then.  I’d need to see it in person, but it sounds like your problem’s in the fluctuating pressure.  If it was designed to withstand the pressure of a fuller pool, then when things dry up a bit there isn’t enough to sustain a decent flow.”
She shushed him.  “I’ll send it on its way.  But as for Steve, he’s out on his run around the island, but he’ll be back in time for breakfast,” Natasha told him as she sorted her knives.  Tony wondered if she did that as a comforting thing.  Plenty of warriors toyed with their weapons.
“Would you try eating solids if I made beef stew tomorrow?  Or I could use oxtails, or veal, or lamb?”
Steve’s throne obviously got little use.  It was very rustic, simply carved stone dressed with red cloth embroidered white and blue to indicate the rightful occupant’s residence.  Back home, Howard lived on the platform, the chair gold and brass with a curved wooden seat, dressed with purple silk and a leopard’s skin.  Tony honestly couldn’t imagine Steve ever sitting on it unless absolutely necessary.  The Phaiakes and Steve both seemed quite comfortable with a complete lack of court formality.  Obviously, the people and their adoptive king were a good fit together.
Really, why was it so wrong for him to be with Tony?  Because he was older?  Well, Steve was never going to have a relationship that lasted more than a couple years if he stuck to his peers.  There was a decent age difference between them, but then there was a decent age difference between him and everyone he knew except Peggy.
Tony presses foreheads with the both of them one last time, before stepping away slightly to shed his outer clothing.  It isn't winter anymore, but the cold still gets to him.  Quickly, he activates it, and the metal folds around him for the first time in months.  Safe, his mind says.  Safe now.
Steve is quiet as Tony drains his cup. He fights a small battle with himself, because he knows Steve will wait until he is finished with the coffee before he tries to get him to talk. But he also wants the liquid to still be scalding as it goes down.
Rhodey rolls his eyes.  “Man, you’re supposed to be assembling a new team, not following me around like a duckling.”
Bruce looked intrigued.  “You never told me that.”  He waited a moment for Padma to respond.  “Well, at three they wouldn’t remember much.”
“I want to know what we would be like if we didn’t have the weight of the world hanging over us. Worlds. The galaxy. The universe.
“I haven’t heard of you wrestling with Herakles,” Tony said mildly, not wanting the backlash that would come with informing him that he was not indeed a river but instead a dinky stream.
.  As far off as Korkyra is, there is a higher likelihood of things being different from the mainland and the Peloponnese.  You Athenians think that you properly follow xenia, and you do, but it’s a long way between properly respecting your guests and being friendly,” Fury told him.  “The Phaiakes are a particularly friendly group, mainly because as far away as they are, not many people make the effort to journey here.  Foreigners are novelties, but not in a bad way.  They’re curious about who you are and why you are escorted by the Athenian Navy.  News takes time to travel, and new gossip is scarce.  They’ll treat you kindly, but be forewarned they’re already talking about you.”
"Of course," JARVIS said. "According to web searches, when mixed with alcohol, Ketamine can cause prolonged periods of sleep and drowsiness, along with a lowered heart rate and shallow breathing. Other complications include difficulty breathing, arrhythmia, and potentially death." Rhodey's eyes went wide.
"You would be right," Carol said. "I know I had a bit of an issue with alcohol before the explosion, but I did have it under control in the years directly before it. After the explosion… I went through a traumatic experience. I was violated in a way no one should ever be. On top of that, my powers started fluctuating. Sometimes they would work and sometimes they wouldn't. I felt useless and turned to alcohol to cope. That's when things started to get worse."
"Oh, I know we're not." Steve looked down slightly and Tony got to his feet, wrapping his arms around Steve's shoulders. "It's alright. I'm not disappointed."
a certified creep. I mean, what kind of grown man sleeps in the same bed as a young boy that isn't his child?"
people would have called 911 or taken him directly to the hospital. No one takes a distressed person back to their house, especially if they're intoxicated."
Obviously, that news had been disheartening to hear, but even before that the atmosphere in the room hadn't been anything close to cheerful prior to that. Pepper had sat at the head of the table with her hands folded neatly in front of her. She remained silent and was intently listening to everything the lawyers said, only speaking up when they finished and nodding when appropriate. It was clear that the situation was taking a toll on her. She looked paler than usual and even though she did her makeup as impeccably as she normally did, her eyes still looked tired. Just overall, she didn't seem like herself and she wasn't the only one.
Tony had gotten up and retrieved a yellow legal pad and a couple of number two pencils. He gave Steve an apologetic shrug as he set the items down on the table.
"I feel like I've explained these fifty different times today." He pulled his hand away from his face and looked Rhodey in the eye. "I wasn't trying to kill myself. I just wanted to sleep." Rhodey raised an eyebrow to that.
Steve and the other Avengers have discovered that Tony's missing, and are now searching the hotel for him.
"No," Lara said. "The button just makes the elevator stop on the nearest floor and stay there in the event of a fire. If Tony's still wandering around here drunk, it'll stop him from making an escape using the elevator."
"It's show time." Happy grinned and got out of the car. Tony slid into the seat closest to the door and allowed himself one last deep breath before he went out and faced the world.
Pulling down Tony's street, Rhodey was relieved to find that the media had not set up an encampment in front of his house. At least, not yet anyway. Punching in his access code at the gate, the entryway flung open on its own, allowing Rhodey to drive down into Tony's garage.
Pepper was still visible in the corner of the screen. Instantly Lara could see her eyes slightly narrow, almost as if in suspicion. Whatever Freeman had to announce, it wasn't pre-planned. Lara took a deep breath and held it.
Tony's stomach twisted and tears started dripping from his eyes. As much as he hated it, he knew that it had to be true. Steve wouldn't scream at him like that if he loved him. Tony would be a fool to think otherwise. Maybe he'd been fooling himself all along, thinking him and Steve could work…
Slowly, Steve turned around and moved to sit in a nearby swivel chair. Natasha found another one and pulled it up to sit beside him. It was clear that troubled thoughts swirled behind his stony expression, but he didn't speak up. Again, Nat found herself having to take the initiative.
"It's no problem, Captain," Fury said. "Although, next time we meet you're going to have to explain why you and Stark haven't disclosed your relationship to S.H.I.E.L.D."
So, Steve prepared himself as the concierge brought up the file they wanted. For the first few minutes, they watched the video play at normal speed without seeing a single sign of Tony. The concierge then offered to speed up the video to twice it's normal speed. Then he sped it up again, and again. Natasha had to stop him from speeding it up to sixteen times it's normal speed out of fear that it would go too fast and they would miss Tony.
"Then you don't need me to pressure you into giving answers you might not be able to give," Steve said. "Just tell me what you know right now, up front. If you don't want to say anything, it's fine." As much as Tony would have liked to stay silent, he still felt as though he owed Steve an explanation.
Steve pulled the blankets tighter around himself as he laid awake in bed. The day before, S.H.I.E.L.D. had moved him from the hospital room he was in before to a small apartment on one of the upper floors. It had all the basics; kitchen, table, chairs, bathroom, and a bed. Other than that, though, the room was completely sparse. The most high-tech thing in the room was the refrigerator, which left Steve amazed with simply the amount of food in it, which was probably a good thing. They didn't want to overwhelm him with too many modern marvels of the twenty-first century all at once.
"Any idea when Barton and Romanoff are going to be flying in?" she asked, making eye contact with Tony.
"I don't believe I am ruining anything," JARVIS said. "I was merely advising you as to what might be in your best interest."
"Did you give my number to anyone else?" She made a point to ask the question slowly in properly enunciated English. Bruce nodded in confirmation.
"You've been poisoned," she declared. "By a Kingslayer Jellyfish." Jessica looked at her in sheer disbelief.
"Can you please stop snapping? It's creepy." It took a moment for Clint to recognize the voice as Tony Stark's – the only person who had been brought into isolation with him – and that it was coming from behind a vinyl sheet that was separating them.
Looking around, Lara quickly spotted Pepper and her assistant in the back. Both were on their phones and Lara could tell that they were trying to restrain their voices' volume and tone. A blonde woman sat at their table with them and from the way she was dressed (black pants suit with a white button-up shirt) she could tell that she was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Automatically, Lara knew she was going to have to supply ID, so she fished around in her purse for her wallet and pulled out both her driver's license and her SI ID. The agent nodded in approval of both and Lara quietly mouth the words "thank you."
"Well," he said. "If I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket I'd sleep better I suppose." As he finished saying that, Clint took his right hand and tapped the area over his heart with his two middle fingers while keeping his thumb, index, and pinkie finger straight. Natasha nodded in understanding.
The entrance to the basement was just off to the side of the kitchen, so Jessica didn't have to go far. She got a glass out of the cabinet and started filling it with tap water. Satisfied with the amount, she took the lid off the vial and dumped its entire contents into the glass. For a second, she thought she heard Salinas' footsteps approaching her and the momentary panic caused her to drop the vial. It shattered into a million pieces at the bottom of the sink.
"Still," she said. "It's not normal for you to be like that, especially in public. I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
"What would that be?" Thanos smirked. Loki was then grabbed by the neck and once again dragged across the rocky surface of the asteroid. When they reached the edge, Thanos lifted him in the air so that way he was eye-level with him. The smirk turned into a full-blown grin.
"Right," Steve said without really thinking about it. When Tony did not look quite assured, he amended it. "Well, I have been having trouble relaxing, but it's not that serious."
While the six Avengers were parting ways, they all found themselves vowing that no matter how far apart they were, no matter what happened, if the Earth needed them, they'd be there.
"No," Bruce said. "He's fine, but as I said, he's probably going to want to tell you himself." Lara nodded in understanding.
"Nose goes!" Within an instant, everyone had a finger on their nose except for a very bewildered looking Carol.
I hope you guys are still enjoying this story and aren't mad that this chapter was entirely OCs. (Well, one character from the comics, one character I've taken from lonelygirl15 and put my twist on, and one OC, but still I doubt you've recognized which is which.) This chapter is meant to serve as a bridge of sorts to what's coming next, so hopefully, you don't mind.
“That is awful it is… But what does that have to do with us?” Tony wonders not leaving his place at the doorway.
They had noticed that David only talked about himself and how great he was at everything he set his mind to and the other thing he loved to talk about was how bad everyone else was compared to him. They had yet to hear about a person in David’s life that wasn’t an idiot, incompetent, crazy or mentally sick in some capacity. And the person who was the biggest target of this treatment was Tony. David would make fun of Tony’s thoughts and opinions and it wasn’t unusual for David to mention what they did in the bedroom and then laugh because Tony apparently preferred being bottom.
“Good. Come on let get you to the bed.” Steve doesn’t know how but somehow they made it to the bedroom without falling over on their way there. Carefully Tony makes Steve lay down on his back first so he can clean him up with a wash cloth but only took the worst before turning him over to his stomach and sat beside him on the edge of the bed playing with his hair for a few moments before taking out the cooling lotion and another bottle Steve hadn’t seen before. Carefully he begins to put the cooling lotions on his butt. “Sorry tell me if I am to rough.” Tony says softly making Steve chuckle softly. “What?” Tony wonders.
“You are the smartest one I know, you have three PhD and that is three more then I have.” Steve replies trying to ease the tension between them. He was smart there was no doubt about it and once again he press down the urge to kill David. “Tony… How did this happen?”
“Don’t encourage him Nat!” Steve jokes as he sips on his gin and Tonic. If given the chance Tony would do it without a second thought.
“Good night baby… and good bye… I miss you.” He whispers into the night hoping that somewhere that Tony heard him.
First off I would like to thank my incredible Beta arielgryffinpuff, who proof read this chapter and I will forever be greatful becuase I write like crap since english is not my first language
Steve would be at the party. And he would probably do something stupid when he saw David because that was just who Steve was. Steve had left several messages on his phone he listened to when he was alone and just cried.
It becomes quiet in the room and it is tense and uncomfortable. Nat and Bucky moves to kitchen to get more drinks and food for their friends and Pepper started to look at her perfected manicured nails and Tony looked anywhere but Steve, whose focus was solely on Tony waiting for the answer he knew wouldn’t come. He had noticed that Tony was glued to his phone whenever David wasn’t with them ready to answer every call or text he might get from David.
“I told you it would be a nice time.” He tells David when they are alone for a moment. “People love you.” He ads to boost his partners confidence even more.
Then he sees the blonde that will send David over the edge. And fuck he hated that his parents loved his best friend more then his partner.
“Well Howard and Maria invited me and I said yes. We have always been close. I used to make sure Tony stayed out of trouble.” He says remembering the old times.
“No. Just work.” He lies like he always does these days. “I need to leave.” He says abruptly and takes out his wallet and put some money on the table and is on his way to leave when Rachel stops him.
Tony looked uncomfortable by the question. Maybe it wasn’t that he didn’t want kids nor was it because he didn’t like kids no he loved kids. So the million dollar question was why Tony didn’t want kids. He would without a doubt screw the kid up before it even came home and he was even more terrified of turning out like his dad. There was a reason he had legally changed his name to Tony from Anthony. It made him freeze every time someone used that name and it was a constant reminder of him never being good enough for his father. He could still remember the tone his father had used when he called Tony into his office, so clinical, hard and unemotional everything a kid don’t need and everything that happened after that made him have panic attacks and nightmares. And he doesn’t want to turn out like that.
“I think you should talk to someone, truly talk to someone not just mention it to me. I think it affects you more then you admit.” Tony tries to explain to Steve.
Steve doesn’t know how long he sits there just listing to Tony’s even breathing memorizing it until they aren’t there anymore and he knows that his husband will not wake up from his nap.
“For over two hours?” He sounded skeptical but then again he was always skeptical whenever Tony left the house without David.
They had just gotten home from a long day of running around the city getting ready for Maria’s first day of school. The whole family was exhausted and decided to order pizza for dinner. There was a ring on the door and Tony is there in a heartbeat. He was starving. But when he opens the door it’s not the pizza guy.
Carefully he puts Tony’s phone back on the table just as Tony enters the living room with two bowls of chocolate ice cream. Sitting down on the couch again and snuggle up against David’s side, handing David one bowl as he does. Then he starts the movie they were watching again.
But that was twelve years ago he had made that decision and he realized that his children were growing up and could almost take care of themselves and didn’t depend on him for everything. When they left the house in the morning and he kissed his husband good bye he was left alone until the afternoon when they arrived home again and that was if he was lucky usually they were home around six every night with school activities, friends and other things important for teenagers. His husband wasn’t much better with running an international corporation Steve was happy the days he could work from home and he had someone to eat lunch with and talk to for that matter.
Tony smiles and kisses Steve again. Sometimes words wasn’t necessary because he knew that they would figure this out, just like everything else that had and may come their way. As long as they loved each other everything will be okay.
“You know he is in love with you right?” Tony’s heart speeds up, could it be true? Could Steve actually feel the same way he did? No David probably just misread the entire situation and saw their friendship for more than it was. No they were just really close friends that had stuck around each other through all the highs and the lows for 16 years and would continue to do so until one of them got sick of the other or one of them died.
“Yeah. Doubt that it will be better than mom’s food though. But they can try!” Maria came from a long line of proud Italians and had plenty of recipes to show for it. Whenever Tony had friends over she just happened to make four different dishes in case they were hungry. And since it was the best pasta he had ever had he couldn’t really say no when it was offered.
blame you for any of this. I fully blame David.” Carefully he moves closer to Tony so he could be close enough to reach his hand out to him. Carefully he puts his hands over Tony’s. “Is this okay?” He asks looking at Tony for any kind of reaction. Good or bad.
He smiles at the questions. So keen on making everything right, just so Tony would be happy. He loved how much Steve trusted him when he was in this vulnerable state of mind, how he could just let go completely and knowing he was safe because he had Tony there to catch him when he fell.
“Yeah yeah right!” Bucky mutters and puts the controller on the table with too much force while cursing under his breath. Steve notices Tony checking his phone again.
“He is no-body sweetie.” He places a kiss on the girls head Howard’s looks gets stern and colder, if that was possible. “He is just lost.” She seems to buy the explanation and rest her head on his shoulder.
David was clenching his jaw, he didn’t like that he was being challenged. “Divorce, child custody, adoptions and paternity testing and such.” David explains shortly. Steve just nods playing interested in what David was telling him. What the hell did Tony see in this guy?! His thought process is interrupted when his phone sounds and he sees that it is the hospital.
“Did you know that the Gracias down the street got a divorce?” He questions and Tony just shakes his head. “Married for thirty years and three kids together and she devoted her entire life to her husband and kids. Kindest woman you’ll ever meet.” Steve continues and Tony is still not catching on. “Now she lives in a studio apartment because that is all she can afford after the divorce and is forced to begin working again and she is 58...”
Tony had been right; the Italian place was good but nowhere close to his mom’s food. He listened to David talk as he sipped his wine and chewed on his lasagna- David had insisted that he should try it because it’s the best in town according to him. It wasn’t and Tony made better in a rush but ate it and pretended to like it, like you do in the beginning of any relationship.
Slowly Tony moves out of the bedroom and to the kitchen where he start the kettle and pulls out Steve’s favorite mug, a big white one with a cartoon T-Rex and under it said Tea-Rex and it was simply his favorite because Tony gave it to him for his birthday when they had just started dating. He hums softly as he pulls out the lose chamomile tea and put it into a tea sifter and places it into the mug while he waited for the water. He decides to clean up in the living room while he waits or mostly where Steve had come over the floor, he cleans it up and puts away the toys and spreader bar under a blanket, in case his friends insist on barging in on them tomorrow. The kettle sounds indicating it’s done, he pours it into the mug and let it sit before going to freezer and takes out the tub of vanilla ice cream, also a favorite for Steve, and he scoops it up into the bowl. Putting the tub back and the picks up the mug and bowl and then he moves back to the bedroom where Steve had gotten dressed in a pair of sweats and t-shirt that was to lose on him, the collar still on Tony notes and was snuggled up under the covers.
“I know… I know that I…” He begins and his heart breaks. This is not his friend whom he remembers. “That I have no right… and I probably woke you up and… sorry..” He was incoherent and not in a good way. He seemed to hunch more and tried to make himself smaller. “We fought… I thought he…” Tears welled up in his eyes and began to fall.  “He would have killed me…” He ads in a whisper. “I pushed him… then I ran…” He admits.
“I know. And I am sorry for being an idiot and yelling you. Its just…” Steve stops talking and focuses on his wine glass and spins it around in his hand.
Tony finally spoke. “Just imagine if I stayed away the first time I left him...” Tony lets out a small laugh before letting a new wave of tears fall.
“Are you sure? Is there anything I can do Tony?” Tony relaxes a little thinking that it probably was a honest mistake from his side and David hadn’t meant to hurt him. Maybe he liked rough sex and simply got carried away. It didn’t have to be a more complicated answer then that Tony decides, or at least he tries to convince himself of this.
“Take my card. If you decide to leave him just give me a call and I will help you.” She sounds so honest and genuine he almost believe her. “It took me four time trying to leave before I left for good.” She admits.
It is late and they were just about to call it a night when someone caught Tony’s interest. Steve follows his eyes and it lands on an older man he is closer to 40 Steve assumes. His hair darker with strays of silver in it, he was normal built nothing to spectacular but still looked good in his dark washed jeans and dark button down with his sleeves rolled up to his elbow. He looked back at Tony who seemed like a kid in a candy store and that hurt like a bitch! He wanted Tony to look at him like that.
“I don’t remember that I asked you to beg.” Tony murmurs and let the leather hit him on his lower back making Steve gasp in chock before Tony hit his left butt cheek three times leaving his skin stinging and then dragged his fingers over the area he hit with a soft hand. Soothing the area Steve notes. “You don’t speak unless I ask you to that understood?” His voice was hard and cold. Steve doesn’t have the chance to reply before the riding crop his right butt cheek harder than before and then he drags the crop down to his thighs where he is more sensitive and for a moment Tony let the patch of leather just drag over the skin before it landed with the loud clash. Making the skin sting Tony started to hit him faster and with more strength and intensity without the soothing after working his way over his thighs, butt and back. He must be completely red on his entire backside he thinks as he bites down on his lower lips to not scream out in a mix of pain and pleasure.
“Isn’t that a bit early?” Natasha questions, which was a fair question in everyone’s mind sense they had only been dating for six months and those six months had been rocky at best. Of course they had tried to say this Tony who would only get defensive and say that they didn’t understand their relationship and that they should really try to get to know David better.
He smiles as he leans back into his chair and thinks that life is good and it would only be better from now on!
Tony sits up and turns to the table and takes a bite of the food. “This is delicious sweetheart.” He takes up some more food, blows on it and reaches out to Steve who opens his mouth and let Tony feed him. He chews it slowly before swallowing. “Good boy.” Tony praises. He takes another bite for himself and then back to Steve who eats it slowly. “Did you do what I asked for today sweetheart?” Tony asks giving Steve another bite.
Tony’s face went blank. He couldn’t speak, his chest felt tight and his heart was beating fast. Steve will think he is ridiculous for thinking that he could protect Steve. God he was stupid there was nothing he could do to protect Steve even less so when he was hiding out at Steve’s apartment. His sight was getting blurry and his breath was getting shallow. And now he was having a panic attack. Great. Just fucking great! He gripped the doorknob until his knuckles turned white as he was trying to even out his breath and calm himself down. It didn’t help. His chest tightens even more and it seemed like his heart was on its way out of his chest.
It’s quiet between them again and moves over to Steve and runs his hands through the blonde’s hair. “I am sorry for what I said this morning. I know you love our kids and I never doubted that.” Tony rests his forehead against Steve’s. “And if you and I ever were to divorce I would never let you live in a studio apartment and force you to begin working at 58, I would make sure you lived comfortably.” Tony promises him. “But I do plan on spending the rest of my life with you.” Steve smiles at that.
“If you had obeyed orders I would have gladly touched you until you came, in fact that was my plan for tonight so you only have yourself to blame for this.” Steve groans again and tries to angle his hips, which was impossible in this thing, to get more out of the touch earning him another smack on the butt. “Behave!” Steve whimpers but stays still. He didn’t have to make it worse for himself right now. “So tell me sweetheart what were you thinking when you touched yourself like this?” Tony never stops moving the fingers over his prostate.
“I am marrying such a funny guy.” Tony teases when they break apart. Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s neck playing with the strands of hair on the nape of his neck. Steve wraps his own arms around Tony’s waist and rests his forehead against Tony’s enjoying the soft touches of his hands. Steve felt lucky that he soon could call Tony his husband. Never had Tony used his preferences in the bedroom against him. Even when they were fighting and it would be so easy to use it against Steve, Tony never did, he hadn’t always been that lucky. If he had done chores with any his previous partners it would earn him a comment on how it was his job as a submissive and if he would complain about it the response was always ‘I am only joking.’ But not Tony, sure he would call him a lot of other things when they were arguing but he could deal with that. He was brought back to the kitchen when Tony was sucking softly over his pulse causing him to groan in pleasure. “You sure there is nothing you want to tell me?” He asks again and Steve can’t figure out what he is after but his mind wasn’t really cooperating with him when Tony’s mouth was traveling over his neck.
“He truly sounds like one of a kind Tony.” He takes a deep breath before he says the next part knowing how it will sound. “Just be careful alright? You only met him three weeks ago and I don’t want you to get hurt.” He says softly. Tony had a tendency to rush into relationships, giving too much of himself and later they would crash and burn and he was alone to pick up the pieces.
He checked his own phone to see if the hospital needed him but everything seemed like it was going fine. Damn it! Maybe they could change the topic to Tony’s work. That was far more interesting then hearing about Tony’s love life that didn’t involve him. He was not at all upset about this.
“Yes I do. Because even if you don’t like to admit it you want me close the day after we have a scene and yesterday was pretty intense for you. And I want to be here for you and I want to make sure you are okay so I cleared my schedule for the day and the Avengers are on their own unless the world is literary going under.” He explains to his boyfriend.
That sounded like a good idea Tony thought distantly and got help from David to get up. His head was spinning but they got Happy to come and get them and they where on their way to the hospital.
He wanted to say none but he knew the rules if he disobeyed he got punished. The vibrations ease up inside him making it easier to think. Tony smacked him again, he was taking too long and he opens his mouth to speak. “Fif…” He begins and things for a moment and opens his mouth again to give him his answer. “Fifteen sir.” He regrets it instantly and knows it was too little.
“See what? You got a haircut?” Steve had not changed his hair in the last six years and Tony knew that.
“Tony! What’s wrong?” David was kneeling by his side. When did that happen? “Let’s get you to the hospital.”
“Yeah I know… I was just surprised, maybe some more prep next time.” Steve suggests again in the soft tone.
Tony stop in the doorway. “Because everything is always my fault! It doesn’t matter how much I try or how much I support you and your decisions! When things don’t go your way or I can’t live up to your standard you get pissed at me!”
“No problem. Just say what you need from me and I will give it to you.” Tony assures him again then he hands him a plate with food. “Now eat. I know you are starving.” Steve chuckles and takes the plate and sits down by the bar and finishes his breakfast in no time and then he helps Tony clean up the kitchen stealing small kisses and touches whenever he could before they land on the couch where they take their usual position of Tony half sitting and Steve using his midsection as a pillow and Tony playing with his hair slowly while the movie was running in the background mostly forgotten.
“I am not leaving him. I don’t know what kind of game you are playing here but you will not ruin my relationship with David and I don’t care what lies you make up about him.” Despite saying those words and trying to push people away he took her card and hid it behind his drivers license, keeping it safe just in case and then he sent a quick text to David.
“I know but…” He gets of Steve’s back and lay down on his side so he can look into the blue eyes he swore he could see the entire universe in. “It just you are so amazing when you are in your submissive mentality that I just don’t understand why they would mistreat you after… or ever.” Tony admits.
“Sounds great Tones. I would like to meet him.” That would soon change though. They see that Pepper is on her way to fall over and fall asleep on the table in front of her and they just look at each other and laugh before starting to carry their friend out of the bar. As they stand on the side walk and wait for a cab to come by they hear yelling in the distance. Its New York so people yelling at each other was nothing new or strange so they just ignore it and continue talking as the yelling comes closer. Suddenly Tony is turned around and has a hand tightly around his wrist and he is certain that it will leave a bruise but that was the last thing on his mind right now as he was prepared to fight of a stranger who was probably trying to rob him but realizes that its not a robber trying to steal from him but his boyfriend who looks furious and ready to kill.
“Isn’t that why you make prototypes? To find out where you can improve?” Steve offers knowing how long it had taken for Tony to make Dummy and he adored that robot. He also knew that Tony’s confidence and self-worth had been completely shattered by David. Maybe he should bring up the support group that was in his church? Get him in contact with a therapist to.
“Good choice. The belt it is sweetheart.” Tony lets go of his hair. “Clean this up and I will arrange a few things. Then meet me in the living room when you are done, naked.” He orders. Tony gets up from the chair and runs his hand through the soft blonde hair before going down the hall and what he guessed was to their bedroom.
When he was 19 his mother got cancer and she wouldn’t survive it. They all knew it but still hoped that something would change and she would survive this. Because Tony didn’t know how he would survive without her. Two weeks before he turned 20 she died. Two days before his birthday they buried her. It was a rainy day and his father stood close enough to him to make sure he looked like the loving father but not so close that Tony would believe it. He wasn’t allowed to cry. He was a Stark and Stark men don’t cry even when they lose their mother. Howard held a speech about the strength of his mother, what an amazing woman she was, how much he would miss her and how his love to her would never fade. Tony knew he hadn’t written it because he Howard had never spoken or showed his love for his wife of almost 25 years. That night Tony moved out. He didn’t want anything to do with his father anymore. Howard swore that if he walked out that door he would be cut of form the money and his heritage from Stark Industries and Tony just shrugged his shoulder. He didn’t even want it.
He changes out of his scrubs and into his clothes before heading home and seeing as he was constantly tight on time these days he had begun biking to and from work getting his cardio in and is was cheaper than using the subway or bus every day. And it was great for clearing his head after a long day at the ER and it was usually faster anyway. He takes the path through central park to avoid the traffic.  The chilly February air was biting at his cheeks and making his lungs burn at every hill.
“No we had an argument and he slipped and hit his head! I would never hurt him!” David defended himself.
“I can make breakfast and the dinner we can figure out. The kids need more chores! Worst case we hire a housekeeper.” Tony smile knowing Steve will hate that because it was a waste of money when they were capable of doing it on their own.
“Yeah sure we can share.” Tony agrees somewhat reluctantly like he doesn’t want to be caught with Steve by his side. They say their good byes and get their coats and head down the stairs. While they wait for a cab to stop Steve decide to ask Tony something he knows will not be received well by Tony.
“Have you noticed that David never take any responsibly for his own life? All his previous partners have cheated on him and have been crazy, the people at his job are incompetent and are jealous of him and his knowledge and that’s why he never gets promoted and his family all have mental illness and he simply can’t have a functioning relationship with them. Have you noticed that?” She asks and he doesn’t even answer because, no he has not noticed that and the few times he had questioned those things it had ended badly for Tony so he decided not to focus on that.
“If he called you he knows I am here!” Tony says with certainty and Steve can’t help but believe him and the fact that he looked terrified, all the color from his face was drained and his eye’s wide as if he was waiting for David to come through the door right this second. “I should probably go back. It will be worse if he finds me here.” He mutters and gets up from the couch and moves to the door but Steve catch his wrist yanking him back.
But one night after dinner when Adam was at dance practice and Joanna doing her homework he got Steve alone in the kitchen.
“Yeah maybe but you sure as hell feel stupid.” Tony says through the tears. Steve notes how pale his friend look. He didn’t look like that a few hours earlier.
“He didn’t. I would have punched him first.” Steve promises Tony. “You are not going back to him. You can hate me all you want I don’t care if it means you are safe.” Tony just nods.
“Where have you been?” David asks as Tony got closer. He was drinking Tony notice. This is not how he had planned on the night ending. Why had he ever left the apartment? He could have avoided this. This was on him and he knew that.
Soft fingers travelled up his spine as he was doing the dishes from dinner. His entire body shivers in comfort by the gentle touch, Tony let his hand stay on the neck rubbing softly, the metal of the engagement ring felt cold against his warm skin, then rough lips over his t-shirt clad shoulder lingering for a moment. “Is there something you would like to tell me babe?” Tony questions and Steve turns off the faucet and grabs a towel to dry his hands before turning around to face his fiancé. God he loved saying that.
Then something seemed to click in David’s head and he looks worried and concerned. “Oh my god Tony! I am so sorry! I just got carried away and… you were so good and I am so sorry!” He panics and Tony just smiles and shakes his head telling him that it is okay.
They had been together for six years and they had agreed that it would just be the two of them. Maybe a dog but certainly no kids! They had been mature people and talked it through and he had given Steve an out if he wanted kids in his future he would understand it. Kids was too big of a thing to compromise on and Tony had understood that but Steve had said he was fine without kids and had no problem with it being just the two of them and they had been great for the last five years but today when they had been attending a charity event a reporter had asked them about kids he went for his ordinary “We don’t want kids” and usually they said it union but there was a different answer from Steve’s mouth today catching him very of guard “We are thinking about it.” Tony had looked at him with confusion before getting his composure together and laughed slightly “We will discuss it later I guess.” But there was nothing to discuss. They had this discussion already and had made a decision. No kids.
“Very mush sir!” It’s quiet between them and all Steve can feel is Tony’s hands ghosting over his inner thighs. It was a barley there touch but it was a sensitive area for him so he didn’t need much to be a whimpering mess wanting more from Tony. He groans when he feels rough lips and a wet tongue on his thigh kissing and sucking. His cock started to leek more pre come then before. “Please…” He begs quietly.
“Happier then I could ever dream of.” They both just smiled at each other and fell into that comfortable silence and ate their dinner knowing that the person beside them was happy because of them.
David hid his face in Tony’s neck for a moment before he muttered into his ear. “If you ever try to leave again… Trust me when I say that Steve is the first one I am going after.” That wasn’t a threat that was a promise Tony knew that.
When he came home in the afternoon, the kitchen was still a mess and the dishwasher still open. He decided that this was it; he had it with his husbands cleaning system he swore by but obviously it didn’t work! With a heavy sigh he turns around and marsh down to the workshop Tony had in the basement. Steve was not surprised when the music was blaring in the workshop and he had things scattered around the room, yet it was cleaner and more organized down here than the rest of the house. He taps on Tony on his shoulder and Tony spin around surprised to see his husband looming over him. The music stops in an instant and Steve just stares at Tony.
The young waiter came back and put down their cups and moved on to the next table. Rachel took out a picture from her purse and put it in front of Tony. It was a young child who had David’s eyes there no question about it as he got a closer look at the picture he saw that the jaw resembled David as well and the same color of hair.
Steve looks up and tries to decide what he should tell his husband, the brown soft eyes that looked at him made the choice easy. He could always tell Tony the truth. “What if I fail?” He questions, his voice was barely above a whisper.
David’s face softens and he looks at Tony with those hazel green eyes he adored. Tony lets out a breath he wasn’t even aware he was holding as he sees David’s entire body relax by his touch and assurance. This was good they were still good.
“Anthony I came all the way here and I want to talk to my son.” Howard’s voice was stiff and his jaw clenching. He had hoped that this would be easier, that his son would still be broken and desperate for his father’s approval.
“We are moving in together!” Tony exclaimed as they were sitting at Nat and Bucks place drinking bear and playing video games. Normally they would be happy for Tony or at least pretend to be happy for him but it was hard to pretend when they hated David and saw how bad David was for Tony.
“Alright I guess. People talked, we partied at night the usual.” David shrugs his shoulders, taking sips of his whiskey.
David looked furious and as he clenched his jaw as he was preparing to tell Tony how he was doing this for Tony. But Tony was annoyed and tired and had a meeting in the morning so all he wanted was for David to go home and calm down.
But more often than not it was just him and the family dog, a black Labrador named Pixie. His daughter had a fascination with pixie dust when they got the dog eight years ago.
“Its red and gold. And the metal details are the same as my suit.” Tony explains behind him. Steve continues to feel the new collar; it was a ring in the front, few flat circular surfaces of metal that were connected by a thin line all the way around. It was a simple collar but Steve loved it. It was from Tony of course he loved it. “You like it?” Tony broke his trance.
“Babe?” David was home earlier then planned. Quickly Tony put his phone inside a box that was meant for decoration but he had figured out how to open and close it without it showing. David thought he had Tony’s real phone but that was his work phone he rarely used.
The last part wasn’t even a question it was an order he knew Steve would obey. He sighs and decides to refocuses his attention to the screen in front of him because he had actual work to do and Pepper would kill him if he wasn’t finished by the time he went home today. And truth be told, he would rather send another missile though a wormhole again before making Pepper Potts angry. Yeah he was terrified of her and it was no secret because everyone was terrified of an angry Pepper Potts. She should join the Avengers he thought distantly. All the bad guys would just look at her stern look and run away crying for their mommy. He chuckles at the idea but sighs soon enough and get back to work. Tech doesn’t build itself apparently.
“So how is SI? When is your dad officially retiring?” He questions knowing that he will be holding a big party like he always did when big things happened.
Smiling like a kid in a candy store, Tony started taking cases of whatever alcohol was in the fridge and started stacking them into a tower on the floor. Pushing the tower forward and careful not to send it all crashing down, Tony inched it over to the cash register. It was a slow process, but he managed to do it. Although, before he let the cashier start ringing up his purchases, Tony ran back and got two more bottles and a bag of M+Ms. What? He was hungry. The cashier raised an eyebrow.
to hurt this woman. Steve looked to Hill to gauge her reaction. She didn't look concerned as far as he could tell, so he decided to trust her judgment.
"You're right," Adoniram said. "But we don't need to do that anymore. Not when we have this golden opportunity just sitting in our laps."
"So," Salinas said. "Would you mind telling me why you were walking around my neighborhood drunk at this early hour without any shoes?"
Dr. Holcomb then left the room and a short while after her promise was delivered upon when an exhausted-looking nurse came to switch out the mask. He quietly thanked her when she finished, and once she was gone he was left alone with his thoughts. The biggest one after I'm never coming to this hospital again was where's Steve?
Thinking fast, Duran took her gun from where it was holstered at her hip and headed back outside to confront the alleged serial killer. When she got out there, Nina rushed to her feet.
"You better get used to it," Pepper said as she stood up and shouldered her bag. "It might not seem like it right now, but trust me, it can get much worse."
He pushed back from Steve, hard, more to stop himself than out of any fear or insecurity. As much as he wanted to screw Steve senseless right then and there, he was aware of that invisible boundary they had set in place. They were not going to have full-on sex until they were both ready, and right now Tony was anything but ready. Besides, having sex right now would only further delay his arrival to work. Panting fiercely, Tony felt Steve place a hand on his arm. He met his eyes immediately.
Lara tried getting ahold of Tony once again, but still, all she got was a busy signal. She tried calling Pepper next, but her phone rang several times before going to voicemail. She then tried Steve, hoping that he was with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Tony as well so that he could pass on the message, but no dice. She thought about calling either Tony's bodyguard Happy Hogan or his best friend, Col. James Rhodes, but both were on the other side of the country and were unlikely to be of any help. Finally, Lara called 911, just to make sure they were on their way. That ended up being the most productive phone call as the police needed details that JARVIS just couldn't give them, such as identifying marks, the attackers' demeanor, and what exactly they were capable of. Lara assumed a lot given how painful that punch to the face was.
"Last week," Salinas said. "While Stark was in my house, he and possibly my maid attempted to poison me with the venom of a rare species of jellyfish."
"I wish," she said. "My cat, Telemachus, hates dogs. He'll scratch his eyes out before he even knows what's coming. However, in lieu of official adoption, I wouldn't mind being considered his unofficial dog mom."
"No thanks," Steve said to the old man without really paying attention to anything other than the text on his screen. "I think I've already got someone." As he got up, Steve could have sworn he heard a scoff of "kids these days," but ignored it. He started to walk away from the café while typing a text to Tony at the same time.
"You know that?" he chuckled humorlessly. "Is that what you know?" He then leaned back to find he was on an exam table like the ones found in most private practice doctor's offices. It wasn't exactly the most comfortable thing in the world, but Clint found himself decompressing and relaxing on top of it like it was the world's finest feather-filled mattress with the softest silk sheets money could buy. "I have no window," he heard himself saying. "I have to flush him out."
Gasping for breath, Lara looked around for her purse and found it resting by the front door. She grabbed it fast and pulled it over her shoulder. Taking a deep breath to calm herself, she didn't look up or behind her as she reached for the knob.
"Why would I be?" Steve said. "I mean, I'm sorry that happened to you and I want nothing more than do punch out the guy who did that to you…"
Very abruptly, Tony started gagging. He was sitting in one of the booth seats with him and Steve on one side and Bruce and Romanoff on the other. He had been given the aisle seat so he could get to the bathroom quickly if he needed to, but it looked like that wasn't going to happen anyway as his body seemed to freeze upon him. Luckily, Barton – who was sitting in one of the recliners across the aisle – practically thrust an airsickness bag underneath him just in time to catch the first round of Tony's retching. Once he got the first round out, there was enough of a pause for Tony to get to the bathroom for rounds two and three.
"Look, we have sort of an emergency situation going on right now," Steve said. "Tony's house just got robbed and he needs to go back and check the damage. Can you please help us do this one thing real fast? If you do, I'll leave with you as soon as we get Tony back to the hospital. Deal?"
I thought the first two episodes of WandaVision were okay. I was hoping they'd give a little more context as to what's going on with Wanda's television fantasies, but it seems like they want to keep us guessing. I know a lot of people were speculating that this was going to be the MCU's version of House of M, but so far I'm not really seeing it, which to me is a good thing. House of M was a mess. I still don't understand what happened other than the fact that Wanda's powers got taken advantage of during a mental breakdown and that's just plain not right. I hope they have the dignity to handle this better, otherwise I am going to scream.
"You never know," Carol said with a light-hearted note in her voice. "Alright, get off your butt. You need to get to calling Hill and Fury.
"True," Knežević said. "But it's pretty hard to give up when you've got nothing else to lose." Tony rolled his eyes and hoisted the man to his feet. He was careful to keep his grip firm around Knežević's wrists and avoid touching his palms.
"I could have done it, Father," he called up to Odin. "I could have done it, for you; for all of us!" Loki hadn't been expecting any sympathy, and he sure as hell didn't get it.
"How did this happen?" Tony said. "That's what I want to know. This facility has the best security system and the best security officers it can possibly have, and JARVIS is programmed to notify me if the alarms are tripped or if reports of a break-in come in from this address. It's more secure than Fort Knox. No one could just walk in here and take whatever they wanted."
After going on a drinking binge, Tony drunkenly wandered off and was eventually found by S.H.I.E.L.D. and returned to the Avengers. Now it's time to talk about what happened.
"Well, you're not wrong," Tony commented. "And if you know that you already know more about this crap than my assistant, so congratulations."
"So, is this all that we're putting behind us?" Tony asked. "Because I'm getting pretty sick of leaving all these conversations between us hanging." Steve sighed. He moved so he had one hand on the railing and looked down at the metal seal of the airlock below. This wasn't how he imagined telling Tony, but it seemed he had no other choice.
Thankfully, Tony was saved from having to answer Fury's question when Dr. Fox stepped into the room. All eyes turned to the doctor as they waited to hear his assessment of Steve's condition. Seeing as he had the rapt attention of the entire room, the doctor wasted no time in giving his prognosis.
"I could go to Target and get some stuff to keep us entertained," Lara offered. "You know, like games or whatever."
Her first step was to remove Stark's wet clothing. It was standard procedure when dealing with someone who had been exposed to the elements in mid-winter. However, Stark had somehow managed to soak all his clothes, meaning she would have to strip him down to his underwear. Carol had no problem with this if Stark remained asleep throughout the process. After all, he was drunk and vulnerable. She could only imagine what conclusion he would jump to.
"At first I wasn't sure how serious to take it," she admitted. "I mean, I saw the black marks on your neck, but I didn't think anything of it until you asked me what I would do if I knew it was going to be my last birthday."
Tony let out a breath of relief. Whatever happened, it had already been taken care of. It could have been worse. The tower could have suddenly knocked out power to all of Manhattan as he feared. This was good. He could relax.
In the end, Natasha heard the screaming from across the hall and came running. Immediately recognizing that it was KY jelly on the walls – not actual blood – and that Clint had no obvious injuries, she smacked him on the side of the head with a throw pillow and hauled him to his feet. Both Lara and Tony gaped, surprised that Clint was okay, and they had been tricked.
"Yeah," Tony said as he snuggled closer (if that was even possible) and tightened his hold on Steve. "I think I understand better than anyone."
"It won't kill you immediately," he finally settled on. "You might get heart disease from it in sixty years if you start eating this stuff regularly. Otherwise, one burger shouldn't kill you." Steve didn't seem entirely convinced but took another bite of the sandwich anyway.
The team more or less knew in the first week, but it was completely confirmed one morning, when a sleepy and caffeine-deprived Tony wandered blearily into the kitchen and accepted a fresh cup of coffee from Bucky with a quick kiss over Bucky’s jaw, which was more a skim of lips than anything else. Bucky and the team had immediately frozen, but Tony remained oblivious, murmuring quiet
He finally comes down enough to slowly pull out, an action that makes both of them grit their teeth from discomfort, before he slowly lowers Tony back to the floor, panting and turning himself to the side to lean on the wall next to the other man.
Tony’s face completely drains of color, and he struggles to his feet, his hands curling into fists. “What are you talking about?” he asks, and his voice is shaking.
It’s with a special kind of horror that Bucky fills in all the missing places, all the gaps in Tony and Steve’s relationship, their hesitant avoidance of one another, the kiss on the hanger where Tony had looked a million kinds of lost, the way Tony had almost collapsed after seeing Steve watch them kiss, and…
“There’s nothing you can do. I’m fifteen weeks along, I’ve just got to let it take its course. Unless you’re offering to get me laid? I haven’t had sex in
“Bullshit,” Bucky growls. Tony presses his lips together. Bucky desperately wants to pry them apart and force him to answer the question:
Bucky shields his eyes from the sudden onslaught of sunlight, gasping and blinking back tears. It must have been brighter outside than he thought. Bucky takes a deep breath and fits his legs through the window, bracing his hands on the sides of the window frame as he slithers through, and lands on the floor in a heap. His sides ache from the tight fit, his visions slightly blurry from the overexertion, and his palms are stinging and cut up from left over jagged fragments of glass that stuck out from the frame.
TW: very brief mention of suicide (like he just thinks about it), if you want to avoid it just skip Steve thinking about shit after Bucky leaves and head to the next break :)
He doesn’t. All memories of Steve he has are tinged with love and desperation and want, but because there are so few he can’t … he loves Steve, of course, he does. Bucky doesn’t need memories to fall in love with this man. But Steve had
Tony’s answering grin is wry and his voice is self-deprecating when he says, “That’s the newest model. What do you think?”
“Couldn’t bear to leave it in the workshop,” Tony confesses, and shyly offers it to Bucky. Bucky takes it with his flesh hand, not trusting his metal arm to be so gentle with something so precious. He holds it very carefully and studies it with meticulous eye movements, taking in every curve and dip of the baby-resembling white blob floating in the black.
“Black Widow, I need you and Hawkeye on top of a building. Hawkeye, I want clean shots, Widow, I need you to be my eye on things. There only seems to be a few dozen, so this shouldn’t take long. Thor, take out as many as you can, but avoid lightning.”
Rhodey looks back as well, and does a double-take when he sees the super soldier. “I–hello,” he says, and Bucky forces the edge of his mouth to go up in a smile.
Steve leaves, Tony's mystery is unraveled, Natasha tries her best to be supportive, and the whole gang except for Sam and Bucky now knows
Gosh, does Bucky feel bad about the art. But it’s too late. What was done is done; the damage is already inflicted.
Bucky nods a little, not wanting to speak. “Me either,” Tony sighs, and runs a hand through his hair, making it even more rumpled.
To his immense surprise, Steve does it without questions, pulling Tony tighter against him as he buries his face in his neck. “How are you feeling?” Tony asks quietly, wondering how the other man is going to respond, if he does at all.
“It is so,” Tony says, and his breath hitches when one of Bucky’s hands–his metal one, good God–slides up from his foot to his calf, lightly grasping the muscle.
“Fine,” he grumbles, and forces the corner of his mouth to not twitch when Tony beams at him. He gets to his knees before his boyfriend and avoids any stray thoughts about the position, instead focusing on gently kneading Tony’s feet through his socks.
Tony winks flirtatiously in response to the icy look, and Bucky rolls his eyes. “Quit bein’ a menace,” he says, voice soft and full of Brooklyn.
“I’m a mechanic,” Tony snaps back, and he can feel a flush threatening to warm his cheeks. Bucky simply raises his eyebrows further but complies, and this time Tony doesn’t hold back his moan.
During this time, the team has been called on three more missions, all of which Tony politely declines. The Winter Soldier hasn’t been spotted at all, and when Tony combs through the videos later he can confirm: Barnes wasn’t there.
Tony snorts. “I’m pissed, but also, I don’t recall saying you were allowed to leave me again.” He pauses. “Also, I’m not sure my libido could take it.”
“Here,” he says, handing Bucky a notebook and bright orange pen. “Write down anything you want to be on it. Go wild; I can basically add anything you want, so if there’s an engraving you want, or a color, or a mounted machine gun, I can do that,” Tony tells him, and laughs a little at the interested gleam in Bucky’s eyes at the possible prospect of his bike having a machine gun.
“You fuckin’–” Bucky hisses, but he doesn’t get a chance to tell what Steve what he is before Steve suddenly continues his attack, this time targeting the side of his stomach, his neck, his armpits, and anything else he can reach.
“Are you excited?” he asks softly, before gently pulling away and sitting down on the workshop couch, draping his arms over the back.
He gasps into the shirt and slowly, bit by bit, sucks in deep breaths and calms himself down. The other hand slowly rubs his back, and when Tony pulls away to look at him, the comforting weight of the hand doesn’t leave, like it didn’t in the alley.
“I love you just as much, please don’t think I don’t. I know that right now, I have to try and be there for Steve to try and make up for the time I wasn’t, if that’s even possible. But the last thing, the absolute last thing I ever want to do, is leave you behind. Tony, I’m serious. You’re amazing and I love you
“Ah, Steve! No, no!” Hot tears squeeze out from the corners of Bucky’s eyes and his stomach hurts from laughing so hard, but he can’t fucking stop. Finally,
It’s like he’s watching things happen from through a frosted glass window. Everything’s distorted and fuzzy and unclear, and all he can do is keep hitting and pounding at the glass, trying to be let in where things will make
There’s still a pit in his stomach, a pressing weight on his conscience, but now it’s for the very man who used to protect him from it. Now it holds all the affection and appreciation he should have given Tony Stark, all the times he should have said
” Bucky says, laughing, “Thor says it’s a flerken. It’s another animal, apparently. Has tentacles, or something.” Bucky wiggles his fingers a little, and Tony cuffs him upside the head.
He also thinks it’s another gap in his memory, something else he should know about but just can’t remember, and after the whole thing in the shower, he decides to not pursue that train of thought and chooses instead to follow Steve silently, obediently.
Nothing has changed here, that’s obvious enough. Sure, Tony and the rest of the team now know of his pregnancy, but Steve already knew. For him, this isn't news at all.
The gentle ping of his floor being reached is, in comparison, too soft, and Steve feels like it ought to be a louder sound, that it should fill more space. He can still hear his own labored breathing over the ding, can still hear his own thundering thoughts, thoughts that are running rampant like a herd of swiftly moving deer, of rampaging wildebeests, of… of… God, Steve doesn’t know. He’s not a damn zoologist.
There’s another cluster of buildings and businesses across the street and it’s as if Bucky’s on autopilot, his training and experience from Winter bleeding into his movements as he ducks behind the other cars and picks his way to the highway, crossing it quickly and blending in to the shadows under the awnings of the buildings.
“You ready to go home?” Natasha asks from behind the steering wheel, and Bucky manages half a nod before thunking his head back against his seat, breathing out a sigh.
“Please, Bucky, don’t be like that,” Steve begs. “You’ve seen the damn notebook. You’ve seen us in paper. We can’t be anything, Bucky, it didn’t work.”
They furiously jack each other off and try to kiss, but it mostly dissolves into Steve burying his head in Bucky’s collarbone while he swears softly in between ragged pants, and Bucky just kisses the side of his neck, careful not to leave marks, before burying his nose in Steve’s hair and moaning as he gets closer to the edge.
Bucky, the bastard, doesn’t even have the audacity to deny anything, or deflect. Instead, he turns and looks Tony straight in the eye, brandishing his spatula sternly. “Don’t be an ass; Steve doesn’t know how to handle that,” he says, ignoring the sputtering from the man himself.
So far, he knows what to expect from every single week he has left, has been eyeing a few facebook groups, and has ordered brightly colored vitamins.
In short, he was worrying about other things than calling his boyfriends. Now, however, it was the only thing on the forefront of his mind.
Tony takes a moment to unravel that statement. “Of… me? Bucky?” He turns to Bucky, who winces. “Were you…? Did you two…?”
him, we just haven’t crossed paths,” he tells them indignantly. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I must return to my humble abode.” He turns away from them and their ridiculous prying, refilling his cup one last time.
He wanders down to the gym for a few hours, checking the simulators to make sure they’re still in good condition. When he’s done with that he goes up to the kitchen and makes himself a sandwich, cautiously sniffing it before cramming it into his mouth.
.” he continues, and frustration is laced throughout his tone. “But something clicked the other day, a sort of feeling, instead of a memory. It just hit me, all of the sudden, how much I used to love him. And just… just watching him try to end it all because I wasn’t there for him… it was too much for me, too.”
Bucky now can appreciate what an ass he was that night, how demanding and prissy he had been. He knew Steve was tired of hiding, too. Knew that he would have done anything to change laws and make it acceptable, but that was before. Then the war happened, and then Captain America, and suddenly Steve’s body matched his mind and spirit, and he had a reputation to uphold. Captain America couldn't be bisexual. It just wasn’t done.
“No, I believe you,” Tony murmurs. He puts his head in his hands. “Do you remember anything else?” he asks, his words slightly muffled.
When he gets back to the Tower, he asks Jarvis what the language was. Jarvis tells him that it’s Spanish, and he mulls the language over in his head, the rapid-fire way people had been speaking, the soft sounds of an S or A, and the hard roll of some of the Rs.
“Yes, please,” he grunts and Tony swats his hand away from his fly and opens it himself, pulling out Bucky’s cock and giving it a few strokes. He stands up with a grunt and directs Bucky with gentle pressure on his hips until he’s leaning against the table’s edge, his hands braced behind him.
If you're still invested in this fic and have been following it week to week, I just wanted to say that when I see your name in my emails either because you've commented or left kudos, I do recognize your user, and I get a really fuzzy feeling! Thank you thank you please know that any gratitude you show for my measly little fic is completely returned :)
Bucky opens and holds the door for him, inviting him inside. Steve files in silently, moving to lean against the wall just inside the room.
Tony accepts the water gratefully and turns around to rinse his mouth, spatting against the stone wall. “Thank you,” he rasps, touched by the gesture. The Soldier shrugs. Tony appreciates that he doesn’t ask.
“You’re not going to like it,” Tony warns. Steve growls at that. “Alright, alright! It’s, uh, Barnes.”
He moans obscenely when a finger squirms into him, and the next few minutes are spent in silence, broken only by soft grunts from Steve as he fucks Tony open with clever fingers, and desperate murmurs of “oh, God,
Tony visibly cheers up. “It tried to kill you,” he tells him brightly which, okay, is a little concerning. Bucky isn’t sure what to say, but Tony seems to have the talking covered.
When they finally find themselves in front of Tony’s glass workshop, Steve’s heart plummets. The lab is dark with the black out screens of a lock down, and Bucky sucks in a sharp breath beside him.
“No I don’t,” he argues, trying in vain to turn the device back on or override whatever Jarvis did to the tablet, all the while trying to remember what he was working on in the first place. “I’ve worked for longer before.”
Steve swallows harshly and shakes his head a little, before burrowing further into his blankets. “I don’t want to get up,” he whispers.
Three hours after that statement Bucky Barnes has a new shiny arm with a tiny gun, and he realizes Tony was right: it hadn’t hurt at all, not once.
“Thank you, Tony,” Bucky says, pure happiness in his eyes when he says the words, and God, Tony could swoon.
He was right to trust Steve. Bucky positively licks his plate clean before sucking each of his fingers into his mouth, closing his eyes in bliss as he savors it, completely oblivious to the burning gaze drilling into him from across the sticky red table, Steve’s slice forgotten.
“No,” she whispers after a moment’s hesitation. “I did have my suspicions,” she admits. Her eyes stray, and she seems to be thinking about something. “Who was it?” she asks, just as softly.
,” Steve cries, and this time he does throw up, all over Bucky and the floor. Bucky just clutches him tighter, breathing into the other man’s sweaty neck. The room smells like blood and vomit and sweat.
He wants to be done with it all, he wants to scream and cry and run until he can’t stand anymore, he wants to hurl himself off of a cliff or into the fucking ocean again just to make the pain stop, but somehow, he gathers it together.
The muffled crunching of wood alerts Tony to the man standing in the doorway of their kitchen. There’s a dent in the wood from Steve’s fingers, deep grooves where the wood gave way and splintered apart. His hands are white-knuckled, and Tony knows if he doesn’t stop squeezing he’s going to carve a hole clean through the frame.
He’s even lost interest in his art. He had started again, after a long break, but it didn’t hold the same luster for him it used to. It was no longer a safe place for him to document his memories. As he had found out a week later from Bucky confronting him, just looking at them was enough to sweep him back to the memory, forced to relive events he had tried to hide away in the sketchbooks to
It takes a moment to realize what Steve’s saying because this is the first time since the incident that Steve’s called him Tony, not Stark. He feels something uncomfortably warm stir in his chest, and he stomps it down before it swells too much to be coherent.
The last time he tried to just tough it out in his workshop without any clear goal he ended up sobbing on Steve’s bed and almost drinking.
“Pepper and I used to do work at this table,” he says, tracing the edge with his thumb. “Glad it’s being used again.” He takes a deep breath and looks at the two of them, making eye contact quickly before looking away. “So? Are we playing twenty questions, or is someone going to talk?”
I NEED YOUR HELP: we're all aware that Thor got Tony seven stuffed animals, and with the exception of the purple stuffed platypus, we don't know the other six. I have ideas, but if yall want to recommend some cute animal that could be one of the stuffed animals in the comments, I might add yours in! Feel free to name it, and I'll give credit in the next chapter :)
“Hey, hey,” he says soothingly, and hops up on the bed as gracefully as he can, which is to say, very ungracefully.
He offers a hesitant smile and thanks her, getting in line. When he’s finally at the counter, the young woman working it looks up at him and smiles flirtatiously. “What can I do for you?” she asks, leaning over the counter a bit.
Bucky never said anything about keeping the conversation secret, and Tony knows him well enough now to know that was on purpose. So, he makes an appointment with one Steven Grant Rogers. Well, not really. He just shows up unannounced.
Clint is outside of the quinjet, waiting for the rest of the team. He holds up a croissant in greeting. “Want one?” he calls.
His face carefully clears itself except for a small, forced smile, and Tony nods politely at the other man. “Morning, Cap,” he greets, and Steve’s teasing smile evens out into a flat line.
Tony pulls some sort of gun thing out of a drawer and switches it on, a red light coming out from one end.
“I’ll be here when you wake up, Steve, I’m not going to leave you, not again,” Tony whispers, making up his mind in that exact instant.
Bucky delicately arches an eyebrow. “Oh? Enlighten me.” He throws the sketchbook at Steve’s feet and can’t help the sadistic curl of satisfaction as Steve flinches.
He lifts his head to look, but before he can even fully take in the sight of the two most beautiful people in the world, he’s being hugged to within an inch of his life. A firm chest collides with him forcefully, large arms wrapping around him while hands just as big wrap themselves around his waist. Steve smells like dust and sweat and hard work, like he always has, and Bucky burrows further into the enclosure of the man’s arms with a dry sob.
Bucky pushes him back gently into the rocking chair. He clears his throat and nudges Tony’s chin up with the knuckles of his hand. “Nightmares?” he rasps.
He’s exhausted, and all he wants is to go to his bed and sleep. He hides his face in her shoulder and thinks about it for a long time. “I don’t know,” he finally answers, a blatant lie to both their ears. She doesn’t call him on it, however, and just pulls him closer to her, wrapping her arms around her tighter.
Tony looks at him and smiles a little. One hand comes carefully down to cradle his stomach, and his voice only trembles a little when he says, “I’m having a girl.”
The quinjet touches down soon after, and Tony feels the pit drop out of his stomach as he registers what this means. “I have to de-foam myself with Capsicle?” he says incredulously, looking at the other man sideways. Steve clenches his jaw but doesn’t outwardly acknowledge him.
And to that, Tony doesn’t know what to say. “I’m not breaking up with you,” he says faintly, and turns his head to look at Steve, who’s clenching his jaw so hard it looks as though it’s about to crack. His eyes are fixed firmly on the floor, and if Tony didn’t know better, he’d say he looked as though he was about to cry.
Although… he looks at the stiletto in his hand and the window, and realizes that maybe this isn’t the best idea. It’ll likely cause quite a noise, and without his metal arm and with all the physical pain he feels, he’s not sure if he’ll be able to fight anyone at the moment, much less several people with a gun. Still, it’s not like he can just pop his head through the window and politely ask for a bathroom break… yeah, maybe not. Of course, he could just punch the window out, but then there runs the risk of fragments left in the frame, and adding glass slashes to his arms and sides is not his priority right now.
When Bucky presses his lips together he knows he could easily pull a poker face and rid himself of emotion, but he lets a small smile fight through to let Tony know he’s only teasing.
Any suggestions, requests for future chapters or comment oneshots, and constructive criticism will be seriously considered in the comments, and replied to!
Fuck. That kind of stung. He knew it, of course he knew that the little girl in Tony wasn’t his, but to hear it so blatantly said, just flung out carelessly, it made something hot and sharp twist inside of him, carving a deep hole. It hurt, actually, really really fucking bad.
Bucky glares at him, but the corner of his mouth twitches, as if he’s very used to that sort of behavior. Tony thinks that he must have been quite the charmer back in the day.
Steve turns his head away from Tony’s lips as the man continues shuddering and slurring his name through his orgasm, tucking his face into the side of his neck, a wet strand of hair tickling his nose.
Quick chattering in a language he doesn’t recognize starts up to the side of him, and he turns his head slightly to investigate. A faded sign is hanging over the store that reads
Bucky had wet his lips, his tongue darting out to swipe over them. “Shit, Stevie,” he rasped,and Steve just nodded dumbly, because he didn’t know what else to do.
Tony continues pressing his face into Bucky’s shirt, breathing slowly through his nose, hitching a muffled sob every once in a while. Bucky keeps carefully running his metal fingers through Tony’s tresses, scraping his scalp lightly.
He points to the food in her hands, then looks back up. “What are those?” he rasps, and she smiles again.
Bucky should feel like a failure, his own anxiety clouding over better judgement and what he needs to get done, but all he really feels is relieved. He’ll probably get a good chewing out for this once he’s reunited with his boys, but for now, he just scrunches himself tighter into his little ball on the train seat, staring resolutely out the dirty window next to him, watching the warm cows flit by until they’re replaced by cool cement.
Steve and Bucky are separated, Steve off to medical where he can get some closely-monitored sleep, Bucky to the hall outside where he falls asleep on one of the benches with his head pressed against the wall and his fingers stroking through Tony’s hair, who lays pressed to his side.
Sadly, sleeping with a concussion is probably not a good idea, especially if it’s so severe that a man with the healing factor of Steve’s still has dilated pupils and can’t walk properly.
The pants, for one. He orders several pairs of bottoms made specifically for pregnant people, which are low-rise pants with a flap that goes over the belly. Tony expects to feel very silly in them and will most definitely be hiding their existence from Bucky on the becoming increasingly rare conditions of them having sex. It’s not that he wants screwing to become rare, it’s just that trying to have a good time with a watermelon in between them is quite the struggle. There’s always the option of hitting it from behind of course, but with Tony’s back and hips, it’s just getting harder and harder… Tony shakes his head, forcing his mind back onto the website he was buying the pants from, firmly clicking the “buy” button.
Bucky snorts. “Sam took it. Said I couldn’ be trusted.” His face distorts for a second, giving Tony a brief glance of the layers and layers of pain and guilt he has hidden away from his time of the Winter Soldier before he manages control of his expression once again. He peers at Tony. “You alright?”
Bucky gasps and shakes his head, bowing his head and fighting the warmth building behind his eyes, warmth that threatens to turn into boiling tears. “I’ll–I’ll be fine,” he manages to rasp.
“That’s nice,” Tony says, and he knows the next thing he should say is something along the lines of “I’m pregnant”, or at least “I have something to tell you”, but the words get strangled in his throat and they lapse into silence.
Tony grinned up at him, accepting the hand. “Got tired of talking about your feelings, Platypus?” he teases.
a need, not a want. He wonders when Bucky started holding this place in his heart. “–but there’s nothing we can do right now, so please just take a break, in
“I don’t–” Steve says jerkily, “You don’t… understand,” he finishes, the frustration he’s feeling evident in his voice.
“He wasn’t there. Just this.” He clenches his jaw and turns away, and Tony senses there’s something he’s not saying.
There’s a yellow one full of drawings of mundane things like a snail after rainfall or a pretty flower, and page after page of scribbles and shapes for practice. It’s his ‘future’ sketchbook, the one he opens most frequently and has the least amount of complicated emotions associated with it.
After that first day, however, of Tony not saying anything and Bucky and Steve awkwardly finding each other's eyes before looking away, they’re split again, this time for good.
He thrusts as fast he dares, chasing his own finish, before he’s suddenly pushed over the edge and bites down on the nearest bit of skin, trying to be as gentle as possible but knowing he misses by a mile when the metallic taste of blood fills his mouth. His vision whites out and he groans, pistoning weakly as he shakes against Tony, pressing him more firmly against the cold tile.
Tony thinks. He wonders, then, why he can practically feel the worry and kindness pouring out of him in waves, if it’s absent from his features.
Tony lists to the side and the other man catches him quickly, gently leaning him back against the wall. “You’re going to be fine,” he says soothingly. “I know you will, Mr. Stark. I just need you to be strong.”
He had sat up as quickly as he could, and squinted across the room, willing his eyes to adjust to the poor lighting faster. The sight that greeted him made him freeze.
“I’m not sure, but it might start to burn in an hour or so. As in, second-degree burns or worse. I can’t quite tell how corrosive it’ll be to skin but I don’t think we should find out, Steve.”
They fall into silence, and it’s slightly tense. Bucky knows they’re both teetering on the edge of, “what now?” and the problem is, he
Bucky just feels tired, and so very, very guilty. The anger drains away in a rush, and Bucky’s head is left spinning. Then, almost as if a switch has been flipped, Bucky suddenly realizes what Steve is doing.
They stand there, and then Steve is opening his arms and Bucky is rushing into them, pressing himself as tight as he can to Steve. Bucky’s head immediately tucks into Steve’s neck, and his breathing is slightly ragged. Steve’s is just as labored and he tucks his nose into Bucky’s hair, his arms wrapped impossibly tight around the other man.
Steve’s steps are too loud in the hallway as he puts one foot in front of the other and makes his way silently into the main compound, keeping his chin up and face stoic. The elevator is devoid of the usual mellow tunes JARVIS plays for its passengers, and the emptiness and quiet amplifies Steve’s breaths until they’re too loud in the stillness, and he can hear the raspy quality to them, can hear the unevenness.
Tony can feel the edges of guilt creeping into his vision, whispering that he should have paid more attention to the both of them, recognized some sort of sign that everything was not okay,
“Buck?” he had whispered into the darkness. His heart was pounding in his chest and he could taste the fear on his tongue. Was Bucky being possessed just like the pastor had warned them might happen? Was he having a seizure?
“You knew before I did,” Tony says, laughing. They both ignore the slightly rueful undertone to the tinkling sound, and Bucky shrugs.
At the time, Bucky hadn’t even entertained the notion of using the phone, his thoughts instead racing around his left arm, his mind trying its best to convince him that every single person in the entire station knew he was missing an arm, knew who he was, what he had just had done, etc., even if Bucky knew that no one really was. He was also fighting the compulsive urge to turn around every couple of seconds to scan the area around him, also convinced that more Hydra operatives were just lurking around the corner, ready to descend from the eaves and take him back on another little impromptu road trip.
Nobody speaks. Tony’s still heaving, standing in place, completely frozen, unsure of what just happened, and what he’s supposed to do. To his and everyone else’s surprise, Barnes is the one who makes the decision for him.
As they got older, however, it became significantly less innocent. When Bucky was about fifteen and Steve sixteen and having one of their sleepovers, Steve woke in the middle of the night to the sound of labored breathing and gasps coming from Bucky’s cot, and a frantic rustling of fabric.
He suits up and flies away front the tower, asking JARVIS, as he flies, for the Winter Soldier’s coordinates. He’d slipped a small tracker in the hem of the shirt he’d given him, thinking that it would be useful at a later time. As it turns out, he was right. It was maybe a little underhanded, but so was the Winter Soldier, so.
“Jarvis,” Bucky rasps, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand hurriedly, but there’s no use; more fall to replace the ones he got rid of. “Get Tony and Bruce,” his breath hitches as a new sob racks him, and he gasps out the rest: “Tell them it’s an emergency.”
“Can I help you?” Steve asks, evenly, calmly. His face is drawn, tired, and Bucky knows that if he didn’t have the serum there would be impressive bags under his eyes. There’s a light scruff on his jaw, too, as if he didn’t have the willpower to shave.
Bruce turns to Thor, who’s being uncharacteristically quiet. “What are you thinking?” he asks, and Tony doesn’t realize he’s holding his breath until his throat begins feeling uncomfortably tight.
Eventually, Tony tilts his head upwards slightly, and Bucky gently tilts his head downwards, so he’s now cautiously meeting the eyes of the other man.
Steve shouldn’t be doing this, he really shouldn’t. How could he have given into this? He was supposed to be stronger than this, but one heated glance from a billionaire and suddenly his composure is gone, his dignity thrown out the window. Tony had pressed him over and over again and he knew he should have said something earlier, told him to stop, but he hadn’t, and now look: he was fucking him against a wall.
“You don’t see it, do you?” Steve asks helplessly. Everything he’s been bottling up for the last two months is starting to boil up again, and Steve struggles to keep a lid on it.
Tony feels a sharp twist of arousal in his gut as he hears those words, and he sucks in a sharp breath.
Steve comes to a halt barely half a foot away from Tony, and Tony opens his mouth to say something, anything, to get out of this uncomfortable situation because Steve is too close,
Rhodey wipes away the kiss, rolling his eyes affectionately, but then he grows more serious. “Tony, he uses your house and money and resources, not to mention your
Lastly, thank you so much for sticking by me, giving kudos or leaving a comment or interacting in any way, and just wanted to let you know I appreciate y'all.
His AI directed him to a courtyard with several metal tables and metal chairs, arranged in a row. Tony landed there, letting the armor fall off of him and adjusted his suit, walking forwards into the middle of the little square, looking around and waiting for his guest.
Tony is frozen for a second before he shakes himself out of his stupor and tells himself to pull it together, damnit. He clears his throat. “Yeah, they’re for you. You can change… oh, I guess right here is good too.
"Wow," Tony said once Steve left. "Sometimes I can't help but think 'Really? That's the guy my dad never shut up about?'" Honestly, Tony truly had that thought a few times, but it was never filled with as much agitation as he was feeling at that moment. He wasn't sure why he felt that way, but sleep deprivation probably had something to do with it.
He kept still as the footsteps got louder. His eyes were squeezed shut, silently willing the Kree soldiers to pass him by. He knew that if they caught him, the rest of the ship would be spared. However, it was far more important to his people's continued survival that he not be caught as he carried with him the key to restarting their civilization.
He sat on the stool he used whenever he was in inventor mode and just fumbled with the things in front of him. He didn’t know what he was doing nor did he really care he wanted to be mad at Steve because that was easier than being angry at a dead man. They had been through a lot together and even though it nearly broke them up at a few points they still made it through and came out stronger on the other side. But this would be their breaking point because he would not budge on this. He would not become his father and force a child to learn everything science related so they could take over Stark Industries.
After their not so great first attempt at sex almost a month ago, David had been prince charming, he was still feeling bad about it. David had bought him flowers and other gifts, taken him out to lunch and dinner dates, bringing him coffee before work and showing up at work to surprise him trying to make up for it and make sure that Tony knew that he cared and that he was sorry for what had happened and assuring Tony that it wouldn’t happen again. Tony’s days was spent talking to him on the phone or texting him and at the end of the day they usually met for dinner before they made it to bed and David picked him apart before putting him back together in the most amazing way.
"It's too late for that," Knežević growled. "If there was a silent alarm, security has already been alerted. I'm coming to get you. Grab as much as you can and meet me outside."
"That's the thing," Steve said. "I know my thinking on that is wrong. I know that everything's changed. It's been over a year and I still just can't come to terms with it. Every time I look around I expect to see things a certain way, but I don't. Every time I talk to someone I expect them to say one thing when they come out with something entirely different. I keep trying to reconcile it all in my head, but it just isn't working, and it just gets worse when I'm around you." Tony's eyes narrowed in confusion.
"Then what's wrong?" Steve hesitated to answer. He did not want to upset Tony, and he had a feeling that if he tried to talk about what was bothering him, that's all that would happen. He tried to come up with a way to phrase it that would minimize the potential emotional reaction, but he could not figure it out before Tony tried asking again. "Why don't we try this; when did you start feeling like this?"
"Jesus, Romanoff," Tony remarked. "Your ability to dig up information on people is uncanny." She shrugged.
"That is all, Brother Duane," he said. "You may take your place for the start of the service." Freeman nodded and gave a bow.
"I like the sound of that." Loki froze as the throne began to turn around. He instantly recognized the figure sitting in it. Real fear crept through his veins. Of all the people in the universe to run into, this certainly one of the ones you didn't want to.
Only a small one, though, as he was only halfway to Steve. To get the rest of the way there, he had to go around to the other side of the penthouse and take the local elevator up to the apartment. On the way there, he passed by the archway that led to the communal kitchen. He popped his head in to make sure Steve wasn't in there and saw Bruce at the stove, cooking a meal that Tony could only guess was a type of curry. It smelled good and before he left, Bruce told him to tell Steve that dinner would be ready in ten minutes. Tony told him that he would, but honestly he doubted he'd remember to once he had Steve close, even if the food smelled
So, she was left to find other means of entertainment, causing her to resort to mattress tag origami.
"Because I was scared of what you were asking me last night," Steve said. "I thought you wanted more out of this." At that, Tony began to look a teensy bit guilty.
"I mean he's not in there." Steve walked around Lara and toward the bedroom. "He probably went to bed while I was asleep."
serious trauma," Natasha said. "And even though you act like a child most of the time, it's not the same thing." Clint let out a hiss.
"Yes," Freeman said. "To protect us from the Kree should they try to stop us like last time." Adoniram had to resist the urge to roll his eyes. His mythology was biting him on the ass again. Nonetheless, he acted the part and made sure that rage was evident in his tone.
"Isn't that a bit callous considering your client is missing," Bruce said. "Never mind that he's Steve's
Bruce looked like he was going to say something in his own defense, but they all had their attention diverted when a beeping noise came from one of the computers. The Tesseract had been located.
"But it made perfect sense for you," Happy said. "At least, back when…" Steve nodded and cut him off before he could say any more.
"Yeah, but this is the last thing Tony needs right now." Lara brought a hand to her forehead and squeezed her eyes shut. "I swear on my mother's grave that I locked that door on the way out. I forgot to put the key back, but I swear I locked the door."
Clint didn't give an answer and frankly, Natasha didn't expect one. Over the past few months, she had noticed that Clint had been constantly keeping himself busy, mostly by fixing things around the farm and playing with the kids. She had a feeling this was his way of coping. He needed to keep his mind busy, otherwise, he'd have to think about what Loki did to him. Nat didn't think that this was entirely healthy, but at the same time, she couldn't be one to judge. Her way of coping involved running, kicking, and punching; not exactly healthy either.
"How?" Thanos said as he crouched down, putting his hand on Loki's neck. "You have no real power here. You think you do, but you don't. Give me one reason why I shouldn't snap your neck right now."
"Tony?" Rhodey's voice came over the speakers at the same time the elevator chimed to indicate it had reached the desired floor and the doors opened. Tony stepped out with his eyes squeezed shut, wishing that he had never given Rhodey JARVIS' override code.
Sliding out from inside the cool surface of the rock box, Knežević got up and surveyed his surroundings. He was just outside of Topanga State Park. If he continued down the Pacific Coast Highway going south, he'd come to a set of public restrooms he could wash up in and eventually a Taco Bell a few miles down the road whose dumpster he could raid. He doubted the bar he was working at before would take him back, given that he missed six days of work. No matter how shady that place may be, they'd still probably refuse to let him continue to work there. They probably thought he called the cops on them or something by now and abandoned the place. That would be the smart move.
