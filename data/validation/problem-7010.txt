Tony snorted, nodded. “He bought the whole damn building. I have my own lab in the cellar, people will hate me.”
Tony’s hands were trembling but certain. He cupped Steve’s face tenderly and searched his eyes for a long, endless moment before he pressed his lips to Steve’s. And Steve melted into him, and the taste of him sent a long, coursing moan through his system.
Tony smiled, as he reached around Steve to turn the water off—and it was a sad little thing. “I know.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Tony commented, brushing a finger along Steve’s spine and smiling when he felt him shiver. “You eat more than a pack of hungry wolves per day. That much food wouldn’t go unnoticed.”
"Be careful, Captain. The thing is priming," Thor cautioned, and before Steve could so much as answer, the creature popped a bulb out of its gruesomely rimmed bell-shaped body, which landed just a short distance from him and exploded on impact with the ground, immersing the air with… What was it? Pollen?
Suddenly, he went over to a large machine tucked in the far corner of the room. Steve hadn’t even noticed it until now. There were large twists of cables curled round it like ivy clinging to concrete walls. At its top was a rounded cap of metal. The whole thing seemed to be attached to the big computers filling up the room.
Steve’s mouth lifted in a half-smile, almost shy. “It was the first time I considered it. You and me. I wasn’t really being serious, you’d never given me any reason to believe you’d be interested, but I remember looking at you and thinking ‘What if?’…”
Natasha rolled her eyes. “Six—and a two-man tent. We’ve already discussed this at least twice. Were you napping?”
“Up here,” a voice said and Steve looked around with a confused expression, before he spotted Tony sitting in top of the RV’s roof. He was leaning back, staring up in the sky.
Tony didn’t know why he was so surprised. Steve had said as much, and of course, Tony had always hoped it was still a possibility. He had tried not to, but the hope had stayed with him, throughout the Accords, throughout Siberia and all of the months after.
“Yes,” Tony said without hesitation, and looked Steve square in the eyes. “JARVIS has been beating him from inside without even knowing it, and I know his matrix can beat Ultron’s. Just without the homicidal glitches. Hopefully.”
All at once, everything came back into focus—the sights and sounds of the hallucination all but gone. The elevator’s door had opened, that’s where the sound had come from. Steve shook his head, pulling himself from the wall and panting heavily. What had just happened? A massive pain settled between his temples, and he reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose as he stumbled out of the elevator.
Bucky lingered for a while, staring at the screen while his thoughts spread into several directions at once. He was… relieved, and happy, and on the other hand, kind of empty.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “So? You did what I usually do. What all of us do at some point or the other. Captain America being impulsive is not the end of the world—well, probably.”
Slowly, Tony brought their mouths together. The kiss remained soft and all too short, and Tony pressed his forehead against Steve’s after. “That might… potentially… be the case, yeah,” he admitted quietly and a nervous chuckle sputtered through his lips. “That’s a first for me, so be gentle.”
“Sleep now,” Steve ordered gently and leaned in to press a gentle kiss against Tony’s forehead. “We’ll talk about it tomorrow. I promise.”
Every fiber of him screamed in protest. Divided with the need to both comfort Tony and stand his ground. To pepper his face with soft kisses and shake him until Tony told him that even if Steve
Tony startled a little as he looked up and spotted Vision standing in front of the ceiling-high windows. For a moment, he thought about berating him of not making his presence known, but then again… JARVIS had always simply been there, too.
“Jo will pick those up in a bit,” Tony said, pointing to his clothes. Then, he grinned at him wickedly. “Wanna join me for the shower?”
Everyone came together, with fists or weapons, and soon enough, chaos broke loose. Tony couldn’t exactly miss his targets, but his moves were predictable at best, and they’d trained together long enough that he could be sure the others would find a way to dodge his beams.
“I know,” Steve said. “Believe me, I know, and I appreciate it. You took us in, gave us a home when you didn’t have to.”
"What the—" Steve started asking, then shook his head. The dust spread quickly and engulfed a small section of the ground, reaching to where Clint and Natasha stood. Natasha was closer, alternating zapping the creature with her stingers and shooting it with her pistols, while Clint was a little ways behind her now, firing arrow after arrow, hoping one of them would work. Steve could tell the two were getting a good whiff of the stuff. He himself was completely immersed in it.
Then, without ceremony, Tony sat up a bit, settling on top of Steve, bringing their middles together. He lined them up, and after spitting into his hand, wrapped it around both of their erections. Sparks detonated across Steve’s skin, as an inhuman moan ripped through his throat. His body was aflame, his blood bubbling with elation so pure it had to be illegal.
. “Yes,” Steve said, and on a second thought, he added, “I wanna touch you.” He didn’t know where this sudden boldness was coming from, but it was rushing through his veins like molten lava. It was just Tony with him—he didn’t need to hide from him. “All of you. All the time. I… I wanna know how you feel around me, and everything you said that first night… I wanna… I wanna do everything with you.”
When he turned his gaze on the interior of the club again, this time lingering on the details, he stopped in his tracks. Spotting Tony didn’t take much; he was seated in one of the more prominent couch areas and talking animatedly with an older woman. Just the sight of him, confident and in his element, agitated Steve and wiped the smile off his face. A low buzz started at the base of his skull and maybe he shouldn't have taken that drink so fast. "Buck—"
“Efficient, aren’t they?” Natasha asked no one in particular as she slowly pulled herself into a sitting position.
The universe only slowly drifted back into a hazy focus as the tremors of climax gave way to shivery aftershocks. Lifting his head somewhat, Tony glanced up at Steve and couldn’t help the ridiculously satisfied smile that spread across his face. “How do you manage to still make this better?”
Steve nodded. “That wasn’t all we found there,” he said, almost a whisper. Steve’s fingers squeezed his, and he opened his mouth and that was of course when JARVIS raised his voice, breaking the reverie between them.
Steve had him in a firm grip, moving up and down relentlessly, and when Tony felt himself slipping, he clung to him with all he had, pressing a broken moan into his shoulder.
Steve licked his lips and exhaled slowly. “Takes two,” he said, admitting, for the first time, that he’d wanted this just as much as Tony had. “I could’ve stopped you at any point.”
Steve glanced at Tony as they both came to a halt. “I’ve stayed here for a week or two, after the Chitauri,” he explained. “A nice old lady is letting the cabin in summer. It’s very… basic, but it helped me calm down and regroup.”
“Aw, come on,” Steve said, grinning light-heartedly. “Learn to live a little. Besides… your ass is nothing to be ashamed of.”
“Impact radius is getting bigger every second,” Natasha supplied. “We’re going to have to make a decision soon.”
Tony reached forward as if in trance, the tips of his fingers running over a few light scars, tracing Steve’s ridiculous abs, flicking his nipples just to gauge a reaction.
“It’s beautiful, right?” Steve murmured as his eyes travelled across the many constellations. “You don’t get to see that in the city.”
Steve popped the bones in his back with a groan and decided that a shower had to come first, before he went to check on Ian. Walking into the bathroom, Steve automatically picked up a few wet towels from the bath fun yesterday and wrinkled his nose. It was definitely time to switch them out.
A million things ran through Tony’s mind—what to tell Steve, how to apologize for what had happened last night. How to survive the dreaded ‘it’s not you, it’s me’ speech while knowing perfectly well that he was one step from losing the most important person in his life.
Tony expelled a low chuckle, tried to sit up, and fell flat on his back the next second. “Nope. Bring me something? If the others ask, just tell them I couldn’t get my legs to work.”
To be honest, Tony didn’t know what to with this. This was unknown territory, and it left him speechless. He’d done his fair share of quickies, of fast, anonymous sex, and some of the guys he’d been with might’ve been a bit rougher with him than they probably should have. His one-night-stands had always praised him for being wanton and shameless, for doing everything they’d wanted, he… he couldn’t just let himself fall like this, could he?
Tony grinned. He reached for his fork. “Alright. I’ll give it a try just because you look so pretty in your apron.”
“Now you look like your dog died,” Vision said, cocking his head, and the comment was so completely and utterly out of place—so
Steve pressed himself against Tony in a manner so intimate Tony had never, even in his wildest, considered possible. “Hardly.” Steve’s head tilted as he considered him, drawing out a deep breath. “Not getting to talk to you for weeks… not knowing where we stand… that was the worst thing that ever happened to me. It was killing me.”
With shaky movements, Steve lifted his hips as Tony stripped the fabric of his pants down his legs. And then, for the first time in his adult life, he was lying completely naked in front of someone else. A man whose kisses still burned his lips. A man who lived in a whole other time.
Tony’s jaw tightened but he didn’t answer. They sat in silence, until Steve couldn’t take it anymore. “Your turn now. And no cop-out.”
As soon as Tony loosened his grip on him, Steve moved to carefully pull out. He didn't move away, though, enjoying the proximity they shared and the quiet that was common in those moments right after sex. But then Tony spoke, which made Steve lift his head and look at him with mild surprise.
"You're sure that'd be okay with… uh…" he asked, not sure who might actually object. Bucky rolled his eyes but stayed quiet.
Tony broke off and closed his eyes. There were tears threatening to spill over, and he pinched his nose to get a hold of himself. He had been so blind, so naive to think that Stanus wouldn’t truly hurt him, and that had sealed his doom.
thought flew out of the window like a rocket when Steve leaned in even further, a hand settling on Tony’s hip to keep him steady. And then his lips were pressed against Tony’s mouth and that was just…
“Steve,” Tony gasped, loathing to pull his lips away but needing air. His head was so light it felt like it was slowly floating away into the stratosphere.
That only made Bucky laugh heartily and clap his back. Steve had realized early on that Bucky had seemingly retained his power and his physique, which was all kinds of impressive.
“I don’t want to talk about me,” he said, then bit his lower lip contemplatively. “Let’s talk about you instead.”
With a shaky nod, Steve’s fingers left Tony, feeling him shiver at their loss. He sat up, his hands scrambling against Tony’s thighs, pushing them up and over his hip.
Steve’s hands were shaking, too clumsy to handle something as precious as Tony’s naked body. Yet he had asked him to, so Steve tried to do as he asked. He tried to be slow and careful as he slid his hands up his ribcage, but eventually, curiosity got the better of him, and he let his fingers travel down, to the firm curve of Tony’s buttocks, then to his rapidly hardening member.
On a shaky sigh, Steve sped up. And soon after, he pressed his face back into Tony’s shoulder and moaned into his sweatshirt as he found release for a second time.
Steve nodded, though he didn’t really feel like it. In only a few hours, he’d be switched back in time—which was good, of course. He
Shivering, Tony opened his eyes. Steve seemed mesmerized, his lips parted and his eyes displaying a drowsy kind of lust as he watched his finger skate across Tony’s skin.
“See?” Steve said. “You already got a goal to focus on. Makes the journey so much easier. Old hiker wisdom.”
Tony cringed, and he was probably making it worse instead of actually confessing what he felt, but he couldn’t really do better. Not yet.
Eventually, he started fretting again, not with the intensity of before, but it didn’t make it seem any less despaired.
“Try to remember that in a moment,” Tony jested, then walked over to the other end of the room, to some kind of container. He pressed a few buttons, then one of the lids opened and out came…
Tony stared up at Steve with wide eyes. He released a deep breath and shivered. The revelation of having apparently fallen for Steve Rogers had almost immediately ended up in a massive freak-out.
“I’m a genius,” Tony muttered. “Doesn’t matter if I’ve done it before, I’m capable of building a stupid tent.”
“I just want you to know that I think it was worth it,” Tony murmured against his lips. “Coming back here… no matter how this turns out, with the bill, or with Thanos. It was worth all of it. Got no regrets.” He bit his lip, then laughed, a sort of wheezing sound, and shook his head. “Well, we both know that’s a lie. I got about a million regrets. And a lot of ‘em involve you… the way I handled things with you back in my time.” He raised his eyes to Steve’s. “But I’ll never regret giving you and me another chance.”
“Stark, I really—” The last word turned into an uncomfortable gasp, when Tony simply moved forward and gently deposited Ian in Bucky’s arms. He didn’t let go of him for a good few seconds, though, waiting until Bucky’s stance relaxed and he reached around to cradle the baby in his arms.
If they wanted to stop this, Tony really needed to take Ultron out of the equation, and fast. Without him meddling any further, they might have a fighting chance.
As Tony ended the call, Pepper took him by the hand and steered him toward the kitchen island. “Come on, you need coffee, lots and lots of coffee.” She refrained from mentioning that Tony also needed a good meal, a haircut, a shave and deodorant.
Natasha’s amused expression slowly turned into a deep frown. “Around eight. What’s wrong? Is Tony still in the lab?”
"Are you ready to talk yet? You may not get too many more chances. We're getting impatient and I'm really itching to cut out your tongue."
Bucky nodded and looked at the ground. "I just... I got away once... Just for a little bit... I remember. I remembered... Was rememberin'."
The hallways inside were as dark as the alleys outside. All of the lights seemingly broken, every word seemingly suspended in the air above their heads. It was quiet. Still. The air felt crisp and cold, despite the insulation in the building. There was a creeping thought that somehow, someone was watching. Hairs rose and nerves were rattled. Surrounding everything was the unnerving thought that though nothing could be seen, someone else was in the room as well.
Peter smiles widely when his eyes fall on Wade and his red suit. His voice comes out as a gasp as he quickly rises from the bed, tripping over the blankets as he does so. "Wade!"
Wade was so fucking good at this and it was easy to get Peter to react, to get him to make those sweet little noises that he'd try and swallow down. Wade wanted to taste all of the sounds Peter was making, but the thought of doing so was put on the back burner when he felt Peter's tiny hand rubbing against him through his pants.
His mother's folder held the same things. There were pictures of his parents standing next to Wolverine, next to Nick Fury. There were matching death certificates that listed their cause of death as a plane crash but... Were they on a mission? Was the plane sabotaged? What the hell? Why did Peter never hear about this? Why was he never told?
Bruce waited for them to be a few steps away before he rushed in and to Tony's aid. In all the years of knowing Stark, he doesn't once remember being so scared for Tony's life before. He knelt down next to Tony who was still panicking as he fought to take a decent amount of air into his lungs and ran his fingers over the place where the bruises would sit atop Tony's throat. He could see the finger-shaped indents and the creases of the metal plates from Bucky's palm.
He shifted to leave the bed but slipped a little and fell right out onto the cold tile. He heard an, 'oh my god' from somewhere and the door beside him opened up. Nat herself, or, he thought, he couldn't be sure, grabbed onto him and he pointed to the small bathroom's door. She seemed to take the hint as he gagged and she all but dragged his ass to the toilet.
He looked down at himself and saw that he was covered in the blood. It stuck in the grooves of his metal arm and crusted on his flesh hand. His black pants were stained even darker and his leather vest was slick with blood. He looked up into the mirror and the panic he felt rising up in him didn't even register on his own face, because the face looking back at him wasn't his.
Peter watched in mild horror as a thick, tar-like black mass spread from the man's body and took the shape of a face. Not a regular face, but a twisted one with glowing white eyes and sharp teeth, and-
Peter was finally able to force words out as he sobbed. "Please, Wade, please let me cum for you, Wade please, need it so bad. Cum in me, Wade, please, want it so bad."
Peter's bottom lip quivered as Bucky took in the sight of the straps holding him to the hospital bed, and Bucky wanted nothing more than to be out of his bed to hold the boy.
"You're gonna be a good boy and let me have what I want, right Parker? And, you should think twice before saying no, because I have authorization to kill you if I have to."
Steve is in the process of leading Peter to his own table when the boy freaks out again, the metal reminding him of the table he'd been strapped to back at Hydra. Bucky comes to the boy's side and promises that he's safe here and promises that he won't leave the room if he'll just lay on the table and let their doctor bandage him up.
Some nights, that's the kill that wakes him. Sends him shooting up from his bed drenched in sweat and screaming. Sometimes it was the kill that made him go statue still at random during the day. Sometimes it's the kill that brings a tear to his eye once he's finally alone. And sometimes it was the kill that made him lash out at others to keep them away.
Wade just stares at the angelic boy sitting in his presence for a moment long enough that Peter begins to wonder if he's done something wrong. "Should I... Not have asked?"
Suddenly, it dawned on him. "Яблоко от яблони," He repeated, stunned. Peter'd had a plan this whole time.
Wade instructed both girls to find something to catch puke in for when he threw up again. They were both covered but didn't seem to care much as one got up to look for a bucket or something, and the other one stayed with Peter, probably to make sure he didn't choke on his own puke.
After a moment, MJ agreed but told him that he was to wake them if anything happened. He agreed with a laugh before thanking them both for helping. He told MJ that he was lucky to have a friend like her around.
And Bucky, who was now worried as hell and still down an arm had to think quickly because he could see the boy's hands and Peter needed his help so he'd do what he had to do. He moved like a flash and trapped Peter against the bed with his leg and brought his hand down on Peter's shoulder. The boy knocked out like a light and fell like a sack of potatoes against Bucky's leg.
Tony took that time to ask Friday what the hell happened to set Peter off, and she could only say that Peter made a call to May Parker and seemed to be in visible distress the longer that the call went on. He asked her if she knew what went on during the call, but she confessed that she could only provide what happened on Peter's end of the call. He asked her to play it back, so she did, and Tony could hear the shake in Peter's voice, the desperate begging.
Peter clawed at the ground, sobbing as his dick started to harden up again despite all the abuse it's received in the last 15 minutes. Wade still didn't let up, but he couldn't stop himself from complimenting Peter. He told him about how pretty that he looked, covered in sweat. He told him how beautiful he looked when he cried for Wade's cock like he was. He told him about how gorgeous he was getting fucked senseless.
"A week... it's only been a week Stevie, but it's been too fucking long," he muttered against the slightly chapped lips of his lover. "But I remembered something, you know? Just during the ride back. I remembered something, Stevie, from the train... From all those years ago..."
An Agent turned and smacked him hard enough it made his head roll and he ceased his screaming. He's only been here two weeks, but it's felt like hell, and he hasn't seen Wade once. Was he going to die in here? No, he couldn't die. Not when his parents were right upstairs!
Despite Peter missing, and all of the chaos, right now all Steve wanted was some normality. He wanted to make breakfast for his lovers and watch television with them. He wanted Nat to laugh at him while he tried for the umpteenth time to figure out the coffee machine. He wanted to cuddle and kiss them and tell them everything would be fine.
With another deep breath, the poured the alcohol onto the wound and let out a soft cry from the added sting.
After a month and the relocation upstate, his wounds seemed to be as healed as they were going to get, left as white patches of skin across his chest and arms. He saw Peter touching them sometimes when he was studying or thinking or just zoned out. He'd been doing a lot of that lately. He'd noticed that when Peter was alone, he'd curl up on whatever chair or couch he'd been left on and his hand would go straight to the damaged skin, and he wouldn't react much, just trail his fingertips back and forth across it.
Nat's knife was carefully strapped to her thigh like it usually was and as they pulled into the dirt parking area, Steve reached over and pulled it out of its holster and checked to make sure it was loaded.
Bucky didn't move. Peter whimpered. He could see the rock falling. He could feel the weight of it on top of him. Wade moved forward again, and Bucky shot him in the thigh. Peter flinched at the gunshot and Wade kept moving forward anyway, finally falling to the ground next to Peter.
She was silent. She wasn't going to argue with him, not right now. Not when she was trying to handle the fact that he was just going to be up and swept away again without hardly any notice whatsoever. She was getting fed up with this life of theirs.
It was less of a secret to Bucky because he's the one who helped Peter inject the damn serum in the first place. This boy was the physical embodiment of Steve Rogers' recklessness and Tony Stark's genius all tightly wrapped up in one little body and two giant blankets. He ran his only remaining hand through the boy's knotted hair.
He hesitated before whispering something else in Russian that Steve obviously didn't understand. He was learning, but at the same pace as Peter, so there was a ton he didn't know. Natasha, goddess that she is, however, had no problem translating. It kinda sounded like music to hear her talk over Bucky's deep voice speaking Russian to her.
Steve and Nat were stunned. Bruce was startled, to say the least, and Stark was downright terrified as he desperately fought Bucky's grip. The world's number one most deadly assassin, The Winter Soldier, was halfway between murder and a mental breakdown (though one supposes they go hand and hand sometimes) right in front of them... The most terrifying man in the world was in tears.
Wade was getting hard, this he couldn't deny, and he made this clear to Peter when he pressed his crotch against Peter's leg. Peter whined and that's when Wade noticed the little bulge in the front of Peter's pants. Wade leaned down and rubbed his nose over it and Peter's hips bucked. If Peter was this responsive now, Wade can only imagine what he'll sound like later on.
Even now, from eight feet behind and only a view of the man's back, Steve could tell that Bucky was fuming. His shoulders were squared, and he wasn't presently worried about the blood covering his hands and his knees. His breaths were long and heavy as he quickly walked ahead, assuming that Steve was following.
Tony's eyes widened, and he looked so goddamn afraid that Bucky had learned something terrible. And in a way he had. Bucky squatted down to look Tony dead in the eye.
Though he declined becoming an Avenger, Peter eventually agreed to move to the Avenger's base... Per Aunt May's request.
But Peter behaved, and he gave it his all. When the man made him swallow his load, he figured that would be the worst of this for now. Rumlow made him stand and bound his hands together with his own belt, probably to act as some kind of lead for the boy.
He said nothing, instead moving past Nat and into the apartment. He looked back and forth before turning towards the bedroom. When he spotted Peter curled up under the blankets, he sat down on the edge of the bed and took Peter's hand into his gloved ones. He watched Peter's face. He knew that Widow chick was right behind him somewhere, as he could feel her eyes judging him. He pretended not to notice and brushed his thumb across Peter's hand before pausing to look at the irritated scratch on his wrist.
Peter came to an abrupt stop when Natasha stepped in front of him. He looked down at the floor and didn't even try to protest when she pulled the sunglasses off of his face. The room went silent. Tony was staring with wide eyes, mentally trying to decide who the hell thought they had rights to put their hands on Peter.
He looked over the edge of the truck and dove forward to swing between Sam and a woman that had him at gunpoint.
And Bucky had to consider it. Of course, he did. A safe place for Peter? A mostly normal life? It's all he's wanted for the boy since he came into his care, but of course, he wasn't Peter's only parent. He couldn't just decide on his own.
Everyone went a little still when there was a knock on the door. Bucky motioned for Peter to stay put before going to open it. Bucky was met with the red mask, and also an old tacky Christmas sweater and he laughed before ushering Wade inside.
. The muzzle was wrapped tightly around his jaw and his smudged black makeup did nothing to hide the murderous glee in his eyes. Bucky reached up to his face only to feel the same muzzle underneath his fingertips. And he lost it. He rose like the dead from the bed full of it and stormed over to the mirror. One kick to the center shattered it and sent glass flying.
Nat stepped around the counter to greet them and Peter smiles, holding small-talk with her until his eyes are drawn to the bracelet she was wearing. He reaches up and carefully touches a finger to one of the shiny spiders. Nat crouches next to his wheelchair and allows him to keep looking at it, loving the interest he's putting into the glittering jewels.
Peter wasn't mad about the ride, he was more ticked off that Wade left the GODDAMN PLANET and didn't even think to tell him that he was leaving. Wade continued to go on about he'd be back but he didn't know when.
And then everything with Rumlow went to shit, and Bucky was suddenly back in his life, even though he didn't know it. And then there was Nat, who'd been part of Bucky's life for nearly as long as Steve had been. And then came along the rest, and then Peter... Poor kid.
Sam was learning, well, trying to learn. Once he punched Bucky in the shoulder, as a friendly greeting that's popular in this century, and the violence set Bucky off. Since then, Sam's found the line and known not to cross it. As a counselor to veterans with PTSD, Sam knew why Bucky reacted the way that he did.
Peter can't help but think Wade looks cute in his sweatshirt, but he says nothing aloud. "I was under the impression that you didn't know how to cook."
And he fought until his leg couldn't take the movement anymore and his bloody knuckles ached the same way his heart did. And he screamed until his voice was hoarse and cried until he was all out of tears.
He took the time to use his fingers to stretch Peter out. He took the time to press and curl his fingers in the places that made Peter moan and writhe beneath him. He could see the little beads of sweat start to form on Peter's neck. He leaned down and licked the sweat from Peter's neck and let his teeth graze the skin.
As for Steve, he trained too, just less. Most of Steve's time was either spent in a parental panic or out searching with a team for any traces of Peter. But it was nothing but useless. They weren't even sure if he was in the country anymore, let alone the same state.
As if some sort of miracle, he saw her out of the corner of his eye, and she was smiling like always and she looked happy just like she used to. It made him literally sick to his stomach and he had to curl up and hurl into the bucket that'd been placed by his bed.
The door rattled as it slid up the old rusted tracks and groaned when he pulled it still. Natalia slipped under the door and he did the same before pulling it back down to the ground with a clang and a cloud of dust.
Wade grabbed Peter by his slender hips and pulled him closer. Peter wrapped his arms around Wade's shoulders and straddled his lap like it was something he'd done a thousand times already. Wade didn't miss the way that Peter was holding his hips up. It was almost as if Peter was unsure about this, about Wade.
Peter knew what was happening, he knew he needed to get back inside, but all he really wanted was to find Wade. He went to walk towards the treeline, but tripped and landed in the dirt. He let out a sob.
Steve focused solely on the punching bag in front of him. He wasn't worried about being back at Avengers HQ and he wasn't worried about Becca sitting with Nat by the door and he wasn't worried about being in the same building as Tony Stark.
Eddie, moderately shocked that he was being spoken to, blinked a couple of times and then shook his head. "Uh, oh, no, no, he's not. He got out, I'm sorry. It was either him or Peter, and, well... Kind of a no-brainer, yea?"
TW: gore, self-mutilation, abuse, murder/death. This episode contains the graphic death of May Parker. Viewer discretion is advised.
! No, if he's there, it means they were able to save him, and he's there with Peter... And if he's there, then God knows what they've done to him, if he's even still alive..." Bucky was becoming erratic, and again, Steve didn't blame him. But he needed to try and calm down, as he was getting dangerously close to another strong outburst.
All of the other kids started yelling at her to shut up, so Wade let off a round into the ceiling. It made them all jump, but Peter was almost totally unresponsive. Wade could easily tell that this girl didn't want to be a part of this, so he decided to strike a deal. He'd let her off easy if she helped him out.
He told the girls to follow him as he scooped Peter up. They all went up to Peter's room where Wade put Peter in the tub, still fully dressed. He turned to the girls after that and gave MJ specific instructions to go upstairs, go into the apartment, go into the middle dresser drawer and get some of Natasha's clothes to wear for now, and to shower while they were up there. He also warned them that if anything else was touched, they'd be in big trouble and that they were to come straight back downstairs once they were finished.
They'd been curled up on the couch for a couple of hours when a cold front moved in, and you could feel it through the whole apartment. Peter came out of the bedroom around that time, wrapped in blankets but still shivering like the devil, watch vibrating on his wrist. They both stood then, encapsulating the smaller boy in their arms. Their bodies produced enough heat now that the cold wouldn't bother them nearly as much as it bothered Peter.
It was only when the fight was over and his adrenaline died down that he felt the stinging pain in his side. When he looked down, he saw the blood seeping through his suit. He pulled on his jacket and said nothing once more.
He had to do what he had to do, so when Peter turned around... Bucky hit him. Right in the space where the head meets the neck. Peter went out like a light and fell like a sack of potatoes into Bucky's arms.
His hands trembled. His body shook. He stood, hands pressed against his flat stomach as his nails dug into his skin. It was like something inside of him wanted him to rip the baby out with his bare hands.
"It was a crime back then, Buck. And... And there was no word then, for what I was- what I am, and..." Steve's hands were beginning to tremble, just as they always did in times like this. "And I never knew how to tell you, so I didn't, and then you were gone away with the 107th and there was Peggy, and she understood. She understood and I was so afraid... Buck I was afraid to love you. I was worried what you might think of me."
This was a place out of date and out of time. Old and dusty with windows that rattled when the wind blew. The floor creaked as they walked across it and Bucky's eyes fell on the shelves of their old belongings. The basket by the door with their books and Steve's old drawing pads was yellowing and falling apart. Tony'd had the electricity turned on, but none of them were so sure that any of the fixtures would actually work anymore.
Directly above him was Mister Doctor Strange, looking like a worried mom. Peter's actual worried mom didn't look so much worried as disappointed. Her fiery hair was no match for the burning anger in her eyes.
Tony was struck by her words and visibly hurt, but if there was something else he knew about people, it was how to piss them off. "Yeah, but he's not MY kid, and last I checked he couldn't possibly be yours either, so why don't you put him back in bed and get out?"
Nat was more dominant, easily giving commands and dolling out praise and punishment when need be; Bucky was a whole different story. Cut from a much nicer type of dominant cloth, he was about as dominant as one could be. He was the lead in their relationship, the one the others went to when they needed something, whether it be advice or to be put in their place. The three of them knew that Bucky could take care of them. He knew their minds better than they did, even on the days when he didn't know himself.
Steve and Sam weren't phased by guns. They were in the military. They held guns and listened to gunshots left and right during each and every day of battle they endured. They listened to grenades and land mines blow up their comrades and watched the blood flow from the bodies of the fallen.
Peter nods, now nervous and fully aware of Nat's limp and how Steve had limited movement of his right arm. Peter felt the overwhelming need to physically injure this Wade guy. Though he knew he'd never get close enough to do anything. Not with the max security surrounding whatever cell they were going to put him in, if they were going to put him in a cell at all. The look on Tony's face made Peter wonder if they might just dig a hole and leave him in it.
With shaking hands and fingers, he lit the lighter and brought it to his left elbow, only barely wincing as the flame tickled his skin. He assumed he was meant to hold it there until he was told to quit. He held it there, easily and readily obeying. And when the man told him to quit, he put the lighter right back from where he grabbed it from. The man seemed pleased and smiled, a cruel, evil smile.
Steve's cheeks turned dark red as Nat pulled his Christmas themed pajama pants down to his knees and started kissing his bare hips. Steve stuttered as Bucky grabbed Nat's hair with one hand and pulled her head closer to his crotch. Her lips glided along his dick and he gripped the countertop behind her head. Steve's been too involved with work and Christmas to have any time to enjoy himself, and what better time for an intervention than 4:30 on Christmas morning?
he wouldn't be getting kidnapped ever again. Hopefully keeping him out of The Life would keep him a little bit safer.
Steve peppered Bucky's face in kisses and the small puppy jumped on them, making the pair laugh. Steve finally opened the box and paused. "It's specially made for your hand..."
"Yes! YOU insisted on taking him on the mission, YOU took him into the warehouse, and YOU let him get shot!"
But that might prove to be a problem considering that small spaces were now one of Peter's least favorite things on the planet. It was actually even worse than the old fear that he used to have of clowns.
When Peter was finally calm enough to get a breath of air into his lungs, he quickly expelled it with a cry of, "I killed her!"
He watched as the wide-eyed brunette looked down at the man beneath him and let out a breath, slowly lowering his arm. He wiped the bloodied blade on the sleeve of his shirt and returned the knife to its holster as he stood. "Let's go."
He was still muffling his cries with his arm when the front door opened, but even his heightened senses couldn't help him out of this one, because it was taking everything that he had to try and shut off his mind.
He could see the guilt on Steve's face, the remorse on Nat's. He just wanted to curl in on himself and stop existing for a while. He wasn't even a whole person anymore. He felt that he was much, much less than that. An object, a weight to be carried, a burden. He just wanted to be normal and he couldn't.
Wade let him go, only to sit up and grab his hands to stop Peter from clawing at his own skin. It was animalistic the way Peter tried to tear into himself. It was like there was something on the inside he needed to rip out. Some demon living inside of his bones, making him like this.
He made his way to the back of the lab and sat down at Tony's computer. He slid his hand across the holographic keyboard and smirked when the screen lit up. Tony had a basic password, it was juvenile and stupid, which made sense because so was Tony. Peter typed in 'captainamericock' and was looking at Tony's background in an instant.
Wade looks a little sheepish. "I had to learn really quickly when I was younger. I've basically been cooking my whole life."
She could barely hear Steve's soothing voice over James' sobs, but after a while, even those quieted down until the apartment was nearly silent once more. She knew that James might blow up several more times today, and when he did she'd be there for him.
Peter emerged from the bedroom, hair still a mess and looked up at Wade with tired eyes. Wade threw together a cup of instant coffee for the little spider and Peter was thankful, to say the least. He sat on the floor by the fire and sipped from his cup.
Peter begins pleading, voice so hoarse it hurts him to breathe but he doesn't want this to be deflected or put off any longer. She was dead and they knew and they probably weren't going to tell him for a long time, but he wanted to hear it. He wanted the truth. For once he just wanted someone to tell him the truth. So Bucky sent Wanda for Steve in his place and knelt back down in front of Peter.
The boy that checked them out didn't even seem fazed, but that's most likely because he was much busier checking Peter out anyways. Peter was too engrossed in his story to notice, he was telling Pepper that he's supposed to have a date with a guy-not boy-a guy. He was wondering if she knew why everyone seemed so... Allowing of their relationship if Wade was supposed to be a bad guy.
The adults, like always, pushed Peter from the room so they could do what they had to do, but Peter sat outside the door the whole time. He almost wanted to cry, but he knew that Bucky would want him to stay strong... Especially since Steve was already crying.
'If the only thing I can do for the team is take a bullet, then so be it' he said. His words kept playing on a loop in Tony's head. Tony realized that Peter was right, he did give them the information, so it was partly his fault.
He held Peter until the younger boy was out of tears to cry. "Come on..." He stood, still holding Peter in his arms and walked into the other room to make coffee. It was relatively easy to work around the spider attached to his chest. He was small enough that he wasn't an obstruction to the process.
fault that he's dead, Peter... It's your fault that Ben is gone!" The sing-song voice turned into pained screaming directly in his ears. Then the screaming turned into high-pitched ringing.
Everything looked the same as it did this morning, with the exception of their mugs from this morning. Those had been washed and neatly sat on the counter together.
Wade kept his hips slow, even when Peter started begging him to go faster. Wade shook his head and kissed along Peter's jaw.
Bucky runs his fingers through Tony's hair a couple of times before resting his metal hand on the back of Tony's head. Tony doesn't resist as Bucky guides his face into his crotch until he's smushed against the denim tent at the front of Bucky's jeans. Bucky always got off on having power in the bedroom, but he also really got off on taking care of his lovers. Right now Tony needed a little bit of hard love and a quick attitude change.
Peter's nearly a quarter of the way through his sandwich when he speaks again, this time quietly asking Wade what they did to him back at Hydra. The merc shakes his head. "They can kill me sure, but I won't stay dead. They thought it was hilarious just killing me over and over again. They didn't even ask me anything, really. Just needed a laugh I suppose. Who better to laugh at than the comedy experiment, huh?"
Peter was shaking violently, tears streaming down his face. "I- I'll be-" He hiccuped between sobbing and trying to force the words out. "I'll be good! I'm-" He broke off into a fit of sobs, but it didn't take a genius to realize that he was about to apologize.
When Tony came by, he wanted to speak them, but he wasn't sure if Tony was the right person to tell, considering that at this time he didn't have very much of a place in the boy's life. Tony tried to be around when he could, he wanted to be part of the boy's life, but he could only be around so much, he would only come around every once in a while. He knew that the boy was still afraid, but that lessened a little more with each of Tony's visits.
Bucky was all for going back to the old fire-trap, as he called it, but Nat worried what it might mean for Peter to be moved yet again. They spent days deliberating about this move and the effects that it could have on Peter and his well being. They agreed that he'd be much closer to everything he loved, and Queens was barely a half an hour away. They just wanted him to have the chance to be a regular teenager again.
Peter held up the large knife in front of him, placing himself between Rumlow and Wade's body on the floor. Rumlow laughed, insisting that it would take him less than a second to end Peter's life.
Today though was very, very different. Last night, Bucky never went to bed at all. He was up all night like he'd been all week.
Though Peter had lived in New York for such a long time, he's rarely ever left it. Aunt May had to work, so she couldn't really take him places, and Mr. Stark hasn't taken him anywhere at all. He's been on one mission out of the country, and Steve made it clear that they weren't doing any sight-seeing on that trip. So it was nice to be with Wade and see all the sights as the rode the bus out of New York.
Nat didn't say anything against this because technically true. Wade was here because Peter had been sick, Nat just didn't know why. Wade paused and sighed. "And there's something that I have to tell you."
As soon as he came into view in the doorway, it was like something in the room shifted and suddenly his guardian angel was watching over him, his leader, his protector. He gently asked Wanda what happened, she said she didn't know.
because the characterization of steve rogers at the end of endgame is wrong and you can't tell me otherwise. and also i wanted fluff cause i've been away and sad. sorry for both of those things. hope you guys haven't given up on me.
She followed the older man around and they continued to search for Peter together, and when they found him, Wade was ready to kill everyone in the room too.
Finally, directly to his left was another bed with the young boy he recognized. He was strapped down too, and maybe for good reason, he looked erratic, on the brink of tears.
Bucky was still wary of Eddie. He watched the exhausted looking blonde as he hovered around the door, muttering quietly to himself and munching on a piece of candy that seemingly came from nowhere.
He could describe it as a high powered magnet inside of his chest where his heart should be. A magnet that drew him closer to the metal that was Peter's skin. It was almost like iron sand in his veins, shifting and pulling him to Peter's touch.
Wade didn't think he'd ever seen anyone eat a sandwich so fast, and it kinda made him chuckle, but also feel bad. Peter must be starving. Once he was finished eating, Peter kept sipping on his Sprite, not wanting to over-do it and throw up everything he just got into him.
Peter nodded and wiped his palms on his jeans. "I'm going with you... I'm going to make that motherfucker pay for what he did to me."
He had sensed something was off about Tony recently, he just couldn't put his finger on it. Every time he approached the subject, Tony went on the defensive. Steve knew the signs. He knew what was happening, he just wanted to ignore it and be happy. He truly cared for Tony, but it was obvious that Tony didn't feel the same anymore.
Peter looks like he's never seen anything so beautiful, and as far as he can remember, he hasn't. "Do we have fields like this where we live?"
See, Tony Stark is not broke. Not even remotely close. If being broke was an island, Tony Stark would live on the moon.
Peter cried out. Maybe pain was pleasurable, but not like this it wasn't. This was horrible, the blood trickling down his chest. The burns from so long ago, now bleeding from yet another wound that wouldn't heal.
"I can't believe you wouldn't tell me about something like that if you knew! I can't believe you'd keep something like that from me, especially if you knew how I felt!"
Peter watched as the man sat down on his bed, and he felt something he never remembered feeling before. He thinks it's what other people describe as butterflies in the stomach when you get nervous around someone you like. "I feel... Like I should've gotten you something."
Every once in a while Peter would start thinking out loud, asking all kinds of questions that neither of them had the answers to. "Why would they hide this? Who were they really? Who would have killed them?" And so on and so forth. There were a few questions Wade didn't WANT the answers to, "Would they have come back for me? If they loved me, why would they keep leaving?"
Just across the alley from where he was standing, was a door that led into the next building. It looked... Off. Upon closer inspection, it seemed that the door had been kicked in. Pushing the door open, he saw the aftermath of what looked like something being dragged across the floor. And then he spotted, on the white carpet, one firey red strand of hair.
Steve began to press into Bucky, slowly and gently. Bucky's arms wrapped around his shoulders and he used this to pull Steve closer to him as if Steve didn't want to be as close to Bucky as humanly possible. Steve pulled back a little to watch Bucky's face as he rolled his hips. He saw the tears in the corners of Bucky's eyes but paid no mind. Bucky had already been crying beforehand, and he was very emotional when he bottomed.
He would stick around in New York, keep helping with cleanup and rebuild as much as he possibly could, but he would do that from his own apartment in Brooklyn. Staying here, seeing Tony all the time while he was his politely distanced self again, it was an impossible thing.
, come on—don’t say that,” Tony said on a fake whine. “Everyone thinks we kept our names, remember?”
Steve hummed his thanks and took a small sip before setting the bottle down next to him. His pencil flew over the sketchpad in his lap, outlining a very distinctive set of eyes. He couldn’t focus, though. His insides were overwhelmed with conflicting feelings, thoughts of Tony and last night and what would possibly happen now.
Goddammit, he shouldn't be yelling at Tony in this situation but it seemed he couldn't help himself.
Tony,” Tony clarified. “Not that I don’t want to, trust me, I do, but… I don’t want to spoil your first time with each other.”
He was wrong. The second his head hit the pillow, he was out cold. Emotionally drained. Physically exhausted. More at peace than he’d felt in months. Instead of awkward and new, falling asleep with Steve at his side had been breathtakingly natural. As though every night since Siberia had been nothing more than waiting for his husband to come home.
Steve nodded, and pulled at Tony’s hand, bringing him nearer. “Don’t worry too much,” he whispered, then kissed his lips chastely.
They stepped around a corner, walking a little further into some secluded hallway, before they came to a stop. No lights were on; there was no sound. Steve supposed he should feel grateful for it, but instead found himself resentful and uneasy, wishing for some noise to crack through the funeral silence.
Tony still remembered vividly how Steve could inspire so much grief. And yet, his love for Steve couldn’t die. It was the one thing he knew was everlasting. His love for Steve would survive him, the world—the whole damn universe.
Grabbing a towel and wrapping it around himself, Tony headed out of the bathroom. As he passed by the door, he felt a familiar tingle, an outward tug at his core. He froze in place for a moment, then smiled as he saw Steve sitting on their bed.
Bruce snorted before he could help himself, then tried to compose his expression. “You go work on the formula, we can manage those last bits alone.”
Steve frowned. He was about to say more, Tony could see it, when Natasha cleared her throat and brought them back to practicalities. “We really
“We will?” he murmured, suddenly feeling very small. In a few hours, they would be going into a fight together, and he had no idea what lay ahead of them. He didn’t want to think about it. He wanted to keep Tony here. He wanted to relive this over and over again.
When they met, Tony didn’t move fast enough to counter Steve’s attack. He had him in a stranglehold within seconds, not allowing Tony any room to move, and then, he was raising his shield in the air. At first, Tony had a panicked moment to think Steve would actually punch him, but it was a strange movement, much more a signal than one of Steve’s typical attack moves and Tony didn’t know what to make of it until there was an indiscernible shock wave vibrating through the air.
Steve’s face sort of… fell, and Tony hurried to add, even while tears welled up in his eyes, “No pain. None at all. It’s just a… vacuum. I’m sure it’ll pass.”
, Steve thought, but couldn’t bring himself to say it. Tony wouldn’t want to hear it, and Steve didn’t want to darken the mood. He knew—not so much by actual words from Tony, but by all the things he hadn’t said—that he was still wrecking his brains over the hits and words he’d inflicted upon Bucky in Siberia.
"We need to get you out of all this. Think you can help me?" At the very least, the material looked sturdy enough to be put to other uses.
Bucky glanced at Natasha again, and they seemed to come to some sort of understanding. “He was sort of…  attached,” he said, “… to Tony.”
Tony huffed, reaching for Steve’s hand and cautiously entwining their fingers. “...you build something better.”
After washing up a little and relieving himself, Steve stood in front of the mirror for a long moment, staring at his dishevelled reflection. He had let Tony into his body, Steve thought absentmindedly There was no higher declaration of trust and connection, as far as he was concerned. How did Tony feel about the whole thing? Steve wasn't sure. All he had to go with were words of love uttered in stealth.
"Hey, Tony?" Steve called, his tone soft, as he stepped in. "Thor's back. Asked us all to come up and see what he's got," he continued when he saw the man still lying in bed. "Hey, are you even awake?"
Tony shook his head. “The kind of man I am today… There’s a darkness in me, and it will never go away again.”
Steve breathed in, deep. “We are…” His eyes drifted past him, as if searching for the right words. Then they locked back onto him. “Tony I… I really don’t want to mess anything up.”
“Clearly, the implants altered his memories in some way,” Bruce said, as if they’d been in the middle of a conversation. He was hunched over a few monitors, just as Tony walked back into the Hulk room. “Rewriting portions to fit with some grander scheme. Most likely, it was done to reduce his moral objections to a minimum.”
“Then we’ll take care of it,” Stane said. “Tony will do what I tell him. He wouldn’t dare not to. Not to me. Not after what happened. So if I tell him the boy’s trouble, he’ll get rid of him. One way or the other.”
Once… once all of this was over, he would talk to Bucky, and finally tell him that… no matter what, his parents' death wasn’t on him, and that—that he was his friend. Not a guy he had to deal with because he was Steve’s chosen brother, but because he wanted him around. In his team, in his home, at his side.
When everyone had left the workshop to gear up, it was just Tony and Steve. Steve had pulled out one of his uniforms from a sideboard next to Tony’s suits, and was just pulling the top over his bare chest.
Later, upon Steve’s request, they stopped at a huge-assed pink elephant to make a selfie, taking it as the metaphor it sure as hell wasn’t meant to be.
"Plenty," Steve said, his tone quiet, private, as he leaned down to nudge Tony's head aside so he could get at his throat. His hand kept the constant tease to Tony's cock, which peeked through the unzipped suit, while his other hand sneaked around to rest on the small of his back, pulling him close against himself.
Bucky smiled and tightened his arm around her waist. “You sure didn’t use to,” he agreed when the ache subsided. He traced a human finger along her decidedly rosy cheeks.
,” Tony said, slapping a hand to his heart. He held Steve’s gaze a moment longer, before he put the tumbler back down on the table and walked over. It was the first time he was within arm-length, and Steve lightly bit his lower lip when he got a whiff of Tony’s aftershave.
In fact, they were so busy with themselves that neither heard the barn doors swing open, or the timely gasp that preceded Clint’s shrill, “Oh my GOD! What the hell are you guys doing?!”
. Not that he’d been waiting to see him again for days, but sure, now was a great time, a perfect time, this was—
A good couple of hours later, Steve leaned against the wall of the Stark Industries’ Medical waiting room when Pepper came running through the doors, her high heels clicking loudly on the tiles. “Steve!”
Steve hadn’t even unpacked his few belongings yet and he’d already decided he wouldn’t. With all of these feelings raging inside him, he knew that being so close to Tony and not close at all would be something he couldn’t endure for long.
“Uh, sure…” Tony said, thinking hard. Steve couldn’t possibly be talking about them fighting Ultron in Sokovia, because if he did, it was all too late already. The chain reaction had already started.
“I would never let you use the Time Stone if I had another choice,” Strange said, his voice suddenly very gentle. “There is usually no way to make use of it without an advanced knowledge of Mystic Arts. There are dangerous channels…”
Tony couldn’t help himself, a breath that was somewhere between an aggravated huff and a surprised chuckle left his lips. He stared at Steve, maybe really seeing him for the first time—this brave, strong man, who once again managed to surprise Tony.
“I know you don’t want to be here, but I need to see to that, so… let’s just get this over with quick, okay?” Tony offered.
Tony smiled. It was such a Steve thing to say. “After Ultr—I mean, after I messed up, I think you wanted to make sure I was more honest with you, but… turns out there was a lot we couldn’t tell each other.”
Steve looked down at the USB-stick in his hand with some trepidation. He didn’t know what kind of SHIELD Intel was on it, but the fact that Fury had tried to leave him in the dark about it, and only trusted his best spy to do the job, was a telling sign if he’d ever seen one.
They settled themselves in position, facing each other, hands held already. For a moment, Tony was unsure whether to settle his other hand on Steve’s shoulder or on his waist, but Steve made that decision for him by placing his own hand on Tony’s waist.
Natasha’s feet crunched on the gravel path behind him. There wasn’t room for choosing his words wisely. His foresight was clouded with unbridled hurt and he whirled around, grasping her by the shoulders. “You know, at times your selfishness knows no bounds.”
No one had ever told him about lovemaking, and Steve honestly didn’t know when he’d learned the mechanics. It was before he’d started working for Mister Hammer; perhaps in a book he shouldn’t have looked in, or during a conversation with a fella he’d known at Art School.
have a presentation tomorrow? At your alma mater? Weren’t they planning a gala for you, honoring the anniversary of your graduation? What kind of anniversary was that again?”
“I’m still doing that,” Steve said. “Every moment here with you is one of those memories I’ll want to look back on when I’m old and frail. These might not be the best days of my life, but they’re still amazing, because you’re here, with me.” He smiled, kissing along the lines of his goatee. “Loving me.”
Ultron roared when he finally realized what was going on. His fury seemed to strengthen him, and in the next second, his eyes turned red once more and he broke the railing in two, rushing forward. Bucky took a shot at him, and when that didn’t take, he took up the fight, metal arm against metal arm.
After putting his office in order, Steve went to the main auditorium for the day's first class. As always, he'd gotten a full class to teach. History of Arts was not an easy subject, and some faces were familiar.
He was quiet for a long minute, then placed his human hand on Stark’s contract. “Я не знаю, что делать.”
He and Rhodey made their way towards the parking slot, driving to the club that was just a few miles outside of the MIT campus. He wouldn’t be going to any more frat parties, Tony had decided—avoiding campus life as best as he could. The chance to run into Steve was just too much, and if there was one thing Tony would gladly live without for the rest of his life, it was Steve looking at him with pity.
“They dropped our case,” Steve gamely plowed ahead. “One of the caseworkers turned up at the hospital and said they were very sorry but our current situation was deemed unfit for raising a child.”
The happy dream he’d been living was about to vanish into thin air and God, he didn’t know how he could bid Tony goodbye.
They both stared at one another for a good second longer, before they simultaneously reached for their Avengers communicators. Sometimes Tony really
Tony smiled at him, feeling the love for this man settle in so deeply in his heart, now, it was becoming harder every second to not just blurt it out.
Tony’s knees nearly seemed to buckle at that. “Thank you,” he breathed, then exhaled a relieved snort. “Second-favorite ‘yes’ from you so far.”
Steve watched Bucky fly all across the room and into the next wall. He couldn’t shake his stupor until Tony took stance to fly after Bucky—his helmet now firmly in place—and only just managed to hold him back with a grab of his hand.
“You’re doing it again,” Natasha said from her place across from Steve. Everyone else was in the front of the RV, and Tony was still listening to some terribly loud music.
He had forgotten how bright the bathroom in the facility was. They hadn’t been here often in those last weeks. Ever since Ian was born, the two of them had stepped down from Avengers business mostly, only joining the team for meeting or more urgent missions. And that meant they more often than not slept in the Tower.
The next minutes were a series of chuckles, moans, hisses and bite marks. Before Steve knew what was happening, Tony sat on his thighs, their chests pressed against each other’s. Tony had gently directed Steve’s hand behind himself, and was now simultaneously dipping both of their forefingers into himself. Their hands were entwined, and all Steve could do, as he stretched Tony open, was to stare at him in utter awe.
Tony must’ve gotten rid of his shirt, since he was clad in nothing but jeans with the first two buttons undone; he was sleeping on his side, chest turned to Steve, and his head reclined against his own arm. He looked so soft all over, so open where he was usually so guarded. And something about the way Tony looked almost careless while sleeping made Steve’s heartbeat quicken.
“You don’t have to stay behind, just because I can’t go out…” Bucky said on a sigh, as he walked back into the room, helping Natasha slip into her coat.
“That means ‘cuddles’,” he said quickly, reaching for Steve with one hand and pouting when he didn’t move one bit. “Come here, I’m not that hungry, really,” he lied, turning around once more until he was lying on his back. He kicked off the covers, completely unconcerned with his nudity. He bent his knees, while stretching his upper body, and running a hand down his chest until the tips of his fingers were lightly skimming his cock.
He could hear the doors of the cabin lock behind him, and the lights within the small room turned green, indicating that everything was ready to spray Tony with the disinfectant if need be.
Rhodey shifted and produced the road map they’d been working on for the last month or so. “I already told everyone that they could only come along, Tones. And a few minor changes won’t ruin anything… I know that you’re upset but we really should look at the bigger picture.”
Steve stepped up to him, so close that Tony couldn’t help but take a step back. “Let me come with you, Tony. Please.”
The whole room felt… it felt off. Steve couldn’t put a finger on it, but it wasn’t something he was familiar with. It looked luxurious, and everything had some kind of sleek elegance to it, even the wooden easel in the far-end corner, but it all looked so strange—the whole, giant space, and Steve felt a cold shiver running up his spine.
“Of course we did,” Natasha told him with a gentle voice, her head still pillowed on Steve’s shoulders. “You’ll make a great dad.
"Whatever it is," Steve said, reaching over to close his fingers around Tony's hard cock. "I'm glad it's working." And he found himself letting Tony push him wherever he would, eventually lying down on the bed when they reached it. The nervous energy was still rumbling in the pit of his stomach, and Steve had to close his eyes to keep from showing it. He didn't want Tony to get the wrong impression.
. “And you have every right not to want me back, I won’t make a big deal out of it, and you’re all getting along just fine without me, I get it, just…” He took a deep breath, exhaled it.
,” Peggy said in mock-drama and with a light chuckle. “That’s usually followed by you doing something drastic like… crashing a plane into the Atlantic.”
. Tony let his head fall back on the pillow, one hand flying to his throat as he pulled in a huge breath. He probably shouldn’t have done this while leaning right over Steve, he thought belatedly, inwardly scolding himself for being so stupid.
Steve gasped when cool air fell on his overheated flesh. Glancing down, he had to bite his lip at the sight and the feel of Tony's hand teasing his cock just right. It took considerable effort to tear his gaze away, but when he met Tony's eyes, he felt he might get weak in the knees. When Tony asked for him to stay dressed, his words went directly to Steve's groin, making him twitch in Tony's grasp.
After some back and forth, Rhodey had taken up the room on the other side of the hallway, and Bucky and Natasha were living on the floor above them. Carol and Rhodey had decided to try long-distance after all, and whenever she visited for summer break, the two were sickeningly cute together.
“Of course, boss,” a female voice that was decidedly not FRIDAY answered, and Steve blinked as a small drone came flying into the room, picking up the cube before leaving again.
Tony sighed. “See those big doors at the top of the loading ramp there?” he said and looked at Clint. “They should all be milling around behind that, that’s where the bio-weapons are, and they’re waiting to rush out when their commander gives the word. Shoot one of your smoke-arrows in when the doors open and you’ll have a great little party going.”
They started with the grounds around the house. The grounds of the Graham Mansion were as big as the estate of Stark Mansion—not so much in structure as in means of acreage. There was a restaurant with bar on the premises, a pond and a gazebo. The gift shop was in the back alongside the courtyard. The property was surrounded by a number of bare-branched beech trees; and the whole appearance, all except the cars and the definite hum of passing traffic, made its origin more authentic.
“Oh, I think you heard me, hot stuff,” was the only thing the man said, and it had Steve huff an annoyed breath.
Tony snorted. “Thinking a bit highly about yourself, huh? Yeah, Steve, it’s gonna fit. You’re just gonna have to spread me first.”
this chance to be with each other without the two of you. Don’t you understand?” Natasha asked, shaking her head at him, as if Tony was insanely stupid for not getting it. “I didn’t have any hope of finding James again, and keeping him had been something out of reach my entire life. Trust me, this is the very least we can do. And I know he can be without me for now, and he knows the same about me, too.”
Tony had a second to realize that yes, this was happening, and before he could blink, Steve was against him, his hands clutching at Tony’s hips and pushing him against the nearest wall. And for a moment—a tiny, insane tick of a moment—Tony managed to think that Steve was drunk and he shouldn’t be taking advantage, but then…
Tony watched him for careful seconds, then repeated the words in his mind. “He ‘loved you’, huh?” he asked, and felt his expression darken.
Steve snorted, and adjusted his grip on him. He’d lost his pants at some point, and kneeled down behind Tony.
Steve nodded, and took a moment to look around. The sky was huge and cloudless, bright and blue, and very, very far away. The trees around them were still slightly damp from a recent rain shower and the wind was whistling above the cliffs. He released a wistful sigh and turned his eyes once more to the almost-blank sheet staring up at him. His thoughts were locked away somewhere, and what talent he had was captured in a torrent of confusion.
“You know I do,” he said. His fingers gently brushed the skin along his neck, massaging the skin and framing Tony’s jaw.
Steve rolled his eyes as he cast Tony an unimpressed glance. “Yeah, well, I don’t like other fellas anymore, either, smart-ass.”
there. It wasn’t the time to tell you, simple as that.” He paused and then continued in a kinder tone. “You don’t know what they did to him. You haven’t seen the pictures we’ve seen. For decades, he killed in the most heinous manners possible. What does that tell you about his capacity for good?”
He also knew that Obi wasn’t exactly known for his smooth talking and empathy, and while he’d give him a hard time for that pedophile comment, he’d eventually have to work with him again. An intolerant asshole he might be, but he’d also taken over after his parent’s death, that had to be worth something.
But even as he thought it, he felt a flicker of doubt. The night before, Bucky’s eyes had been jaded maybe, had been hard, but there was also sorrow, and confusion. He’d looked blatantly hurt, like he couldn’t even understand what he was doing—
Looking down at Tony’s face, Bruce nodded his head. “It’s fixable. Just stay with us, you hear me? Let’s get inside and I’ll get it out.”
“Wish I had,” Tony murmured. He’d forgotten how… much… it was. The unique mix of art and practicality, all of those paintings and sculptures, the symbolic icons and Sanskrit inscriptions. And the magic. It was everywhere, and even now, after Tony had travelled back in time, after he had touched those powers with his own hands, he was no closer to understanding them.
“Gotta have to take your word for it, because from my point of view, it’s pretty damn weird. You and I—we’re not… we’ve never… you never even looked at me twice. For God’s sake, we’re like the last two people who should ever hook up!”
“…cheated on me?” Tony finished, unbothered. “Sure. All the time. Her lovers wrote her letters she sometimes read to me out loud. And they visited her regularly. She even wanted me to catch her, invited them to our bedroom. Later on, she preferred to take them to the boathouse. The only place she wouldn’t bother me was the workshop.”
“Awesome!” Steve called, looking way too enthusiastic just because a bunch of people had apparently died in here. Tony should probably find it more worrying than sweet.
Well, going back at this point would be unwise, Steve reasoned. If he was going to make it to lunch tomorrow, he'd have to drive back all night, put Bucky at home and then drive out again. It made no sense. And he was lucky, he realized, that he was off work the next day. Still, it seemed a little impolite to impose.
There were sounds coming from the other room, and as if he’d heard Steve, Iron Man came flying back through the corridor. The two soldiers, but also a third man—a heavily injured, bloodied man with crazed eyes and brown hair—running after him.
Ross’s stance tightened. “Well, we obviously can’t clear him, Miss Romanov. The hearings confirmed evidence for twenty-three murders in the last fifty years alone. And both Mr. Stark and Dr. Cho could not confirm that the implants are effectively deactivated. He is still a threat and he must be treated as such.”
"Gotta admit it’s looking a little suspect," he said, listening to Tony's heaving breaths. "Do you need anything?" he asked tentatively, shifting a little to get closer.
,” Steve said as he pointed his finger on the address on the pamphlet, “Hey, that’s a haunted house!”
“Tony always wants bacon,” Steve replied. “His cholesterol level, however, tells a complete different story.”
Some kind of guttural sound left his lips then, but he couldn’t be bothered to keep track of those things, not when Tony was finally fully bared to him. All nervousness forgotten, he freed the both of them of their remaining clothes, and what followed was slow as honey, voluptuously sensual, their lips and hands sliding over damp, shivering flesh, caressing, kneading, and biting softly.
“Keep… looking…” Steve begged him and smiled when Tony nodded, his eyes remaining open even as their lips touched again.
“It’s not that interesting,” Bucky said, making it sound as firm as he possibly could. Which wasn’t much, because if Steve had at last found a girl, he
And sure enough, when Tony had finished talking, the frown on Steve’s forehead was a prominent fixture and it didn’t smooth out again for a good few hours. Tony had basically watched him retreat inwards, pondering the idea in his head for a whole long while. Only when Helen had shown him the remodeled Cradle, throwing all kinds of neuroscience terms at him, Steve had come out of his stupor and instead started to ask about a hundred questions.
Tony licked his lips and nodded, hand subconsciously reaching for Steve’s. “We’ll be over in a minute,” he said. “And, uh, Car?”
His hands traveled from Steve’s chest to his arms, grazing lightly downward until, finally, Tony laced his fingers with Steve’s.
With that, Steve raised himself up into a sitting position, only to turn them both around and push Tony down on his back. The next thing Tony knew, Steve had wound both of his legs around his middle, and his body pressed him into the mattress. He poured a moan into Tony’s mouth as they kissed and Tony felt himself clamp hard around Steve, tremors rocking through his body. His whole body trembled even as waves of a powerful orgasm washed over him, suctioning Steve inside him with desperation. Steve’s fingers surely left some bruises on his arms with how tight he was holding him, but Tony couldn’t be bothered. Every mark Steve left on him would be something to cherish later.
Tony looked at him in confusion, at the room, then he seemed to understand. He shook his head, and looked around. “No it’s not, it’s…” His eyes swept over the walls, the windows, and the bed. “Oh fuck, it is.”
Tony moved, activating the suit and stepping into it. He pulled Steve against him, making sure he was covered by the shield’s width. “Great date,” he said before the noise became too loud. His faceplate was still up and he cast Steve a likely embarrassingly lovestruck smile, winding Iron Man’s fingers around Steve’s.
Steve paused. “Uh, yes,” he said slowly. “I remember Thanos just fine, but… I meant the battle in which we fought that sentient Slime-Monster.”
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve from behind. “I can’t tell you that,” he said, nuzzling the side of Steve’s neck. And—all right fine—birthdays
That he might’ve developed a crush that was a tad more serious than his usual infatuations that never lasted longer than one night and a morning.
“Easier than you’d think,” Steve replied. He started unwinding the bandages from his head, rolling them up as he went. “They were dreams. There was no one judging me. With Tony, I could just be… myself.”
“I never knew it was an option,” Steve admitted, biting his lip so he wouldn’t just kiss Tony again. To distract himself a little, he touched Tony’s wedding band, fingertips rubbing lightly over it. It was no use, though, he could still feel Tony’s breath against his face, shuddering through his open mouth. Tony’s lips were so close, so tempting. So Steve took his face in his hands and kissed him again.
Steve sighed, turned around and glanced at the room. “I can leave. But you shouldn’t be here, either. Let me take you home.”
Next to Tony, Steve rolled his eyes, raising both hands to his temples, and shaking his head. He let himself fall back on the bed, mouthing, “I
“Well,” Clint said, as so often the first to find his words, after Strange’s chanting came to an end. “That was—”
“It’s okay,” he said, casting Steve a reassuring smile. “You were out of it, flashback, and it’s me, so it’s not the first time someone just planted one on me. Don’t sweat it.”
And then Tony said the most unexpected thing, making Steve's breath hitch on a startled chuckle. Their bad luck with dates seemed to be a thing, although Steve couldn't say
“Why are you doing this?” was the first thing out of Bucky’s mouth. He reached for Steve’s arm and dragged him back.
There they would be driving to the scarce viewing areas somewhere northwest from the town, making sure to get the best spot possible. And all the while, they’d talk about college, about their new dorm room at MIT, about the classes they’d have together, the people they’d meet and they’d wait for the magic to happen. For seven days, it would just be Rhodey and him, and it’d be perfect. Life-changing. Unforgettable.
He was breathless, his knees were sore, his arms were shaking, and he didn’t care one bit. All he could do was sob his pleasure into the leather of the bench, clenching his eyes shut as he fought off his climax with little success.
At that, Tony stood up. There was still a spark of pain shooting through his body, but it was manageable. He walked forward heatedly, pushing a finger against Steve’s chest. “You’re not invincible.”
Tony smiled, happy that Steve was happy. “I’m glad,” he said. His body tingled with awareness that hadn’t existed before. There were some serious thoughts at the edge of his mind—like how he wanted to convince Steve that this was a good idea when they spent most of their time apart, or how he could find a way to have more time together—but in the end, Tony was too tired to think any of them through. Instead, he forced himself to lean up on his elbows, and looked around at the room. There wasn’t a box of tissues around, as far as he could tell, but he did spot a package of paper handkerchiefs on the nightstand.
She took a seat next to him, shucking off her jacket and stretching her legs as she leaned back against the wall. “Look, Steve… I know you don’t want to tell me anything about your
“Can’t even keep it in your pants when half of the US government is watching your every move, can you?” someone said.
“Had a meeting with Pierce,” Steve said and dropped onto the couch. He wound an arm around Tony’s shoulder and pulled him closer.
“Boss,” Friday called, her voice too soft for her programming. With each day, she became a bit more like Jarvis, and Tony wondered what that said about him—that his AIs were able to show more compassion than he ever had.
At least he would die at Steve’s side, together, like it was meant to be. He’d made his choice, long before Strange had given Thanos the Time Stone, and with it came peace. Peace, sorrow, and everything in between.
, after all. Tony Stark—tech prodigy, business magnate, one of the richest men in the world and constantly ranked on Forbes’ list of
Next to Steve, Bucky rolled his eyes. “You think you’re going to decide for all of us? If I’m being carted halfway across the country against my will, this will better be a democratic decision making.”
Soon enough, they slept. And if Steve glanced through the window every minute or so, watching Tony’s silhouette moving inside the illuminated tent, while still tasting him on his lips, well… no one had to know.
It was a letter, Steve realized, and recognized the kind of flaming red paper immediately. He’d seen it in the secret drawer compartment in the Morning room. It was the same color as the hidden letters he’d found in Indries’ desk.
Steve inhaled him appreciatively, clutching Tony to him with sudden possessive restriction. For a moment he simply let himself revel in the steady rhythm of Tony’s heart beating against his chest. “He shot you,” he murmured.
“You two are really incorrigible, you know that?” Bucky’s voice was echoed by Natasha’s chuckles. “Can’t you, like, wait until you’re alone?”
“An hour ago, I think,” Steve said. He rubbed a hand over his neck, then sighed, as if realizing something. “What year is it… here?”
He wondered what exactly it was that he looked like right now. His submissive posture, arms raised over his head and legs spread to accommodate Tony’s hips between his thin thighs. And Steve couldn’t help but briefly think back on Hammer’s words:
Tony’s brown eyes all but absorbed him. There was a deep line between his brows, but it was more wonder than pain. It took a moment before Steve was fully seated within him, and afterwards, they remained locked in silence for a long beat, kissing ever so slightly. As though getting to know each other all over again.
Sure, he had no idea what they were to each other right now, but he wanted to have the chance to find out.
“Natasha…” he started, sighing. He had no idea how she did this—always knowing what was going on in Steve’s head.
Tony huffed, groaning as he cast a hand across his forehead. “Yeah, thanks. That’s not making it awkward at all.”
For a moment, Tony didn’t move, and Steve’s heart missed a beat, thinking he might have truly lost Tony’s love over this. But then, he caved in. Tony’s lips pressed firmly against Steve’s and there was a hot breath against his skin as he put both of his hands on top of Steve’s, pulling him in. Tony leaped into the kiss with everything he had, exploring his mouth with liberation. Their hands were clasped together as much as possible, until one of Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve’s waist to pull him closer.
“Very funny.” Tony thought about saying more but the quip died before he voiced it. He wished he could have a sliver of their coolness, but it had all evaporated the second some police officer had raised his gun to shoot at Steve.
“What does it matter, anyway? I know everything, as do you,” he said in return and pressed their foreheads together. “This is crazy, I feel like my mind’s ripped in two… I can still feel you kissing me goodbye.”
“It’s not,” Tony insisted, the wings letting go of Steve, and of course he’d be trying to get away, so Steve kept his hands on Tony’s shoulders, keeping him close.
“There’s no lasting damage, right?” he asked Thor, his voice casual. “That antidote will just cleanse everything, and they’re back to normal?”
Tony hummed in agreement, and when Steve pulled back, he leaned up to press a kiss against his lips. “Pretty sure teasing us is all the reward she wanted, but yeah, I’ll think of something nice.” He grinned, nipping at Steve’s lower lip and biting it slightly before he slotted their mouths together again. He sat up, and his knees weren’t all that pleased, but he only needed to move forward a bit before he could settle in Steve’s lap comfortably. He cupped both of his cheeks, trailing feathery kisses all over his face. He pressed their chests together, and while he felt sticky and sweaty in so many ways, he didn’t want to get dressed again, just yet.
Steve nodded, as he reached for the yellow pencil. “Good choice,” he agreed and handed it over to her. “The circle there is right in the middle of the picture,” he explained. “Artists call it the ‘focal point’, you don’t always need it, but in this case, it’ll pull the viewer’s eye right into it when you give it a bright color. Yellow’s always a good way to do it.”
The others were already sitting around, waiting. Barnes cast them a suspicious look, the others tried to avoid looking at them at all.
Though it had happened several times in those past few weeks, Tony found himself overwhelmed with a powerful wave of emotions that astoundingly didn’t knock him to the ground. Every time he looked at Steve and saw him looking back with open affection, he was sufficiently stunned.
Rhodey had little hair and a big smile. He had remained silent so far, but now smiled at Steve warmly when their eyes locked.
Nothing. Tony frowned and reached for his phone. That was… more than unusual. Ever since he had Extremis wire itself into his brain, he and JARVIS were constantly connected, talking whenever they felt like it. And JARVIS had not ever
She might just as well have kicked him in the gut. Silence settled between them, before Steve cleared his throat gruffly, and told her in a voice that was harsh with pain, “Whatever consequences there may have been, it was not your right to hide this from me.”
who were still able to fight—stormed forwards. Tony saw Captain Marvel, Thor, Gamora and Peter—both Peters, really—rushing towards Thanos’ body.
? The guy was actually leaving Steve and Steve was about to ask for his fourth whatever-it-was. Whiskey, probably.
“Oh Steve,” Peggy whispered and slowly raised her right hand to cup Steve’s cheek. “It’s not your job to save everyone, you know? It’s not your job to—to…”
Tony sighed, but nodded. “True, yes. As you should’ve known by now.” He started walking towards Steve. “Detective, I—”
Bruce turned around in his swivel chair, casting Sam a comically serious look. “Keeping things in working order.”
When they’d started this, Tony had done most of the talking. There was so much he’d needed Steve to hear, things he’d never thought to tell him before. Tony had felt he owed him an explanation for a lot of things. Why he’d wanted to give up Iron Man for Pepper, why he’d built Ultron, why he’d supported the Sokovia Accords. He told him about how hard it had become… how hard
…then Steve was standing right in front of him. And he was only wearing skimpy boxer briefs and nothing else.
Slowly, Steve walked closer, kneeling down in front of Tony. He took both his hands in his own. “What are you talking about?” he asked. “I don’t understand.”
Steve thought, confused for a moment. The kid didn't look a day older than eighteen, but if he was Bruce's assistant he'd have to at least be in his early twenties. The way their hands lingered didn't escape Steve's notice, and he felt warm with mild embarrassment at the very obvious flirt.
“Something wrong?” he asked as he caught Tony staring at him intensely, but Tony only shook his head as he turned.
Steve hummed whenever Tony spoke, not knowing how to respond or not bothering to think of an answer. He pressed his cheek to Tony's neck, his fingers lazily drawing patterns on his abdomen as they sat awkwardly. His legs were starting to go numb, but he wasn't ready to move just yet, acutely aware of how utterly Tony trusted him, letting his entire weight rest against him.
, there were some things he really needed to take care of, and soon. He leaned down, because both his boxers and pants were still pooled around his ankles.
Steve leaned closer, his face barely an inch away from Tony’s, which, for some reason, had Tony’s heartbeat quickening. “You didn’t touch that sandwich I brought you last night. You haven’t eaten since your burger yesterday at lunch.” He tapped a finger to the counter and shot Tony a look of pure superiority. “Now eat. It’s time someone takes care of your well-being, since you obviously won’t do it yourself.”
Tony turned back to Wanda. “We don’t want to fight you. In fact, we’d like you to work with us. Offer you a place on our team.”
“Captain Rogers?” Phil Coulson’s voice muffled through the door. “Are you ready? We are debriefing in half an hour.”
“Yeah, no problem,” Tony replied, eyes roaming Steve’s face. His skin was stained with dust and grime, and the upper part of his uniform seemed to have been hit with a few droplets of the same oily fluid that had been dumped on Tony at some point before they’d effectively killed the whatever-monster-it-was. Steve looked fine, all things considered, and yet… it had been a close call. And a completely unnecessary one, too.
With his eyes set on Tony, Steve took in the beautiful colors flashing across his face, catching the contours and sharpening some features while putting others in contrasting relief. It was, he thought, a more breathtaking sight than fireworks usually were. He couldn't honestly say Tony was infuriating anymore, but then, he probably had not been rational about the whole thing at the time.
In any way, falling in love with Steve wasn’t what surprised Tony. Steve had always held a rather special place in his heart.
“FRIDAY, blackout,” he ordered, then cast Steve a pointed look. His eyelids lowered a fraction at the intense expression on Steve’s face. He was biting his lip and flaring his nostrils as he blatantly looked Tony up and down.
He did. He’d seen it in Tony’s eyes. And the knowledge that the larger-than-life Lucifer Morningstar had somehow fallen for him, Steve Rogers, had been terrifying before, but it was a million times more so now.
"Can't wait to hear it," he answered shortly, his hands massaging Tony's ass deliberately. A blowjob sounded like an excellent idea right now, even though they were at Tony's workshop, a halfway public space—Steve didn't care.
to Tony in private, just a minute or two, without Ross monitoring them, he was sure they could find a way out of this mess together.
“You’re not going to jail,” Steve said, swinging a roundhouse kick at two robots flying by, sending them to the wall across the bridge they were standing on. “These are… I’m sure Tony’s lawyers will come up with a fancy name, ‘Circumstances of potentially apocalyptic significance’, or something. You’re needed, it’s an emergency, they have to understand that.”
“He wouldn’t even miss you,” Stane said, his hands now clamped tightly around Steve’s upper arms. “No one would. Why don’t you go? Why don’t you leave Stark Mansion? He doesn’t need you. He’s got his memories. He doesn’t love you. He wants to be alone with his wife again.”
“At least now you know he feels the same way about you. You didn’t have that the first time around. You never believed me when I said he was looking at you with big heart-eyes all the damn time.”
The others had woken in the early afternoon. They’d headed for lunch at some greasy diner before eventually driving for their next destination. Apparently, Tony had already made reservations for a campground in the Smoky Mountains, since it was always pretty crowded this time of the year.
“You don’t have to,” she said, calmly. “It’s okay not to know everything right away. You will figure it out with time. I did, and so will you.”
“We talked to Reed Richards, and he is sure that Doom had already gathered the Sequencer back in 2018.”
“You know… I’m not sure you understand the concept of a getaway-car,” Sam said when he eyed the Beetle Steve had rented from a car shop nearby.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, pressing a kiss to his hair. “I really am. I should’ve been by your side for this. Please forgive me.”
“Here you are,” Steve said, setting Tony’s drink down in front of him and one of these blooming onions he loved so much in the middle of the table. Retrieving a bottle of beer from his jacket, he wrapped one arm around Tony. “Sorry. Didn’t ask if you wanted anything, Jim, ladies.”
It clearly was a struggle, and Steve knew in his heart that this wasn’t how it had played out in reality—even before Tony opened his mouth. The change from his previous annoyed and slightly resigned expression to the more amicable one he was sporting now… it seemed off.
“What, Steve,” Tony said, his gaze mocking. “You want to tell me you suddenly have feelings for me?”
“Stand down!” he yelled, commanding his legs to pump faster. If anything, the blur ahead became more distant, twisting around the next corner and vanishing from sight.
Wanda’s lip curled up in a disgusted sneer. With her magic, she suddenly hauled Tony off his feet, pinning him against the ceiling, which—
“Tony…” Steve breathed out. And he knew, it all lay in Tony’s hands now. Extremis had given him that power. It was power in its purest form. He could easily let Project Insight do what it had set out to do; he could let it kill all those people, if it only meant to save Steve. He could doom the whole world with so much as a simple thought, if it meant Steve would live.
There was a long beat as Steve took him in, heavy emotion storming his eyes. “Of course,” he said quietly, but Tony knew he didn’t like it.
When he walked out of the bedroom, Steve shut the door behind him, briefly contemplating the items on their to-do list. Their pile of laundry was reaching Mount Everest proportions, but it was Tony’s turn to do it. Tony had agreed to do some of the housework themselves, and now that Steve had finally drummed home the importance of separating colors and checking the tags for instructions, he didn’t have to supervise anymore.
"Grasp the deeper meaning behind a huge stuffed bunny?" Steve scrunched his nose, though he was still smiling. "Who even gets something like that for their sweetheart? It's completely ridiculous."
Hi guys :) I will be on holidays for about two weeks now, so there won't be any updates in that time, but chap 7 is almost finished so I hope I'll be able to post soon after. I'm a bit nervous about this chap since a lot of people had very distinctive (and very different) ideas of how the 'big fight' would play out with all of the Avengers involved and yeah ... I spent a long time thinking this over and I hope I'm not disappointing anyone ;) After this chap, we'll be in post-movie territory, but there will be a few more chaps, probably around 11 in total. Hope you enjoy this!
…” Sam started, but when Steve turned around and glared at him disapprovingly, he shut his mouth and raised both hands in defense. “Just saying, man. Clint was very graphic. Not that I needed to know which way around you guys are doing it.”
“You smell so good,” Steve murmured, favoring his throat with a long, amorous lick; his smile broadened when a breathy whimper escaped Tony’s lips. He nuzzled him a moment longer, then leaned back up. He was quite the sight, hair mussed and uniform top slightly tugged up above his pecs, pants pooled around his thighs.
Steve’s head poked out from behind the folding screen, where he was currently undressing himself. He didn’t look too happy at the prospect. “They’re not the same,” he said.
He let go of Steve’s shoulders, putting both hands on his face instead, gently stroking along his cheekbones. The guy was unreal, all deep blue eyes and kissable lips. There were a few drops of sweat lining his brows and Tony leaned up to kiss each one of them away.
Tony’s mouth was a thin line, but eventually, he shrugged out of the undersuit, rolling it down to his hips. He sighed, or tried to, what with all the shaking, as he pushed it further down, until he was only sitting there in his boxer briefs.
They were quiet for a minute longer. Bucky sighed and sank back against the RV. He put a hand on Steve’s shoulder, patting him a few times. “Okay… wow.”
Tony being seventeen, a distant voice in his head echoed, and Steve sighed. He couldn't listen to that voice for much longer. Tony seemed downright desperate. And honestly, Steve himself was beginning to lose patience. He wanted to be the kind of guy who could resist the temptation he was facing, at least until Tony was eighteen, but he wasn't. He had no will to refuse.
Trying to block one of Tony’s punches, Steve’s fist hit his shoulder hard and it knocked him backwards.
“How long have you known about this?” he asked slowly. Careful. Tempering his pace as to not over-exert himself just to make a point.
Steve’s eyes flickered to something in the back of the barn, and when he walked to the tractor, Tony didn’t understand what he was doing at first. But then he stepped up to him again, twirling the little red screwdriver in his hand. “That’s mine,” he announced, and pocketed it right after.
“You can’t just blow it up,” Dr. Cho went on, her voice all bravery. “You have to get the cradle to Tony.”
As Stark Industries’ future CEO, Tony’s workshop had been moved to one of the more prestigious floors a few months ago and the atmosphere in the building had grown on Tony very little ever since. The place was clean, as clean as it could be and with each shiny white floor they passed on their way up, the knot in Tony’s gut drew a little tighter.
Steve stared stupidly at Tony’s door. Then, he sighed and shook his head, his fingers coiling and uncoiling nervously, his eyes glued to the door in front of him. God, he was pathetic. It had only been a few days since he’d seen Tony last. And yet, here he was. Pacing in front of Tony’s bedroom door like a hopeless teenager with some wretched crush.
Tony clenched both of his hands, and stormed forward before he even knew what he was doing. He approached Steve with a firm stride, and when he looked up, Tony shot back all the irritation he was feeling.
He took Barnes’ measurements in record time, saving them onto his private servers before closing all projects. Together, they left the workshop and stepped into the elevator. The guest suites were in the upper floors of Stark Industries’ headquarters, and while most of them were occupied today, they had two bedrooms each, so Tony figured they’d be okay.
“Water under the bridge,” Tony whispered, and his mouth found Steve’s in a blink. Steve’s mind collapsed and his body fell pliant in Tony’s arms. It amazed him that Tony’s kisses still had that enthralling effect over him.
He scribbled a couple of names on the left side of the board and a few more on the right. "Anyone wanna share their thoughts?"
They kissed for what felt like hours, and Steve realized how long they hadn’t done that. To simply kiss, and breathe each other in. There was never enough time. Once they pulled apart, both grinning like loons, Steve let himself fall back on the bed. Lying side by side, he blindly grabbed Tony’s hand and held it against his chest.
“You, I don’t know, want to talk about it?” he asked, and he knew it sounded cliché, and the offer was stupid for so many reasons, because this was
“Probably wouldn’t—wouldn’t stop you, if—Oh God…” His breath hitched when Steve rubbed him more firmly, and he let himself fall against Steve’s chest, barely managing to stay on his feet. “You’re not playing fair,” he accused him with a smile, closing his eyes as he felt fingers fumbling with his belt.
It took a while for the dust to settle, but when it did, Steve could see the Hulk on the edge of the collapsed building with Wanda standing a little ways behind him, and the night sky obscured everything behind them.
“I know you like keeping to yourself,” he started, swallowing down all those tons of innuendos forming on his lips. “And that’s fine, really, no judgement, big fan of doing the lonesome brooding. But if you want to, you know… hang out… or talk tactics or whatever it is you mid-twenties do these days, you can just come down to my shop.” He shrugged, and almost immediately felt stupid for even bringing this up. Steve didn’t like him, it had been clear on the Helicarrier, and it was still painfully clear now, a good few months later.
"He's running you down anyway," Steve said, looking away from him at last and surveying their surroundings. "He better not try anything funny."
“I know, you cheeseball.” Tony’s eyes locked on Steve’s for a moment, then he gave him a meaningful smile. He stood up and held out his hand to him, swaying slightly to the beat of the song.
All of them smiled. Bucky looked at Tony as he laughed. “Do you remember the time when we didn’t know who Doom was?”
At some point, he must have passed out, because when he came to, Natasha was already un-bandaging his upper body. Seeing he was awake again, she spoke, “Clint bought some new bandages. I figured it was best to do it while you were out. Do you feel any better?”
It didn’t take Steve longer than five seconds before he’d let go of Tony fully and retreated to his side of the bed. Last night had felt… right. It terrified him, in some ways. Those last years, he’d spent so much time building an impenetrable wall around his heart. Ever since his parents had died, he’d figured it would be better not to get too close and personal, and it had never felt right when he was sharing himself with someone.
“Show-off,” Tony said with an entirely strangled voice and made to move forward, grabbing Steve by the back of the neck, pushing him further down. Steve conceded with a sigh, glancing back at him over his shoulders and pressing both hands into the armrest. Tony dropped to his knees behind Steve, spreading his ass cheeks apart with both hands. He pushed a finger into him and it went in easily enough, but not without resistance. “All right, then,” he murmured and opened the bottle of lube again.
Steve thought as he approached the lab door. It'd been some time since he'd last seen Tony, drunk and ready to get to work in here, and tucked him in bed instead. He'd kept his distance after, mainly because he thought that might help put a stop to the pointless flirting and the…
Everyone was already here, Steve realized—Maria and Phil, Pepper and Happy, Rhodey, and the rest of his team. He greeted them all, accepting the many heartfelt congratulations with as little bashfulness as he could, before he made to ready the table for dinner.
“We won’t last much longer,” Tony yelled at Steve, who stood next to him, staring into the sky. The good few dozen spaceships above the city where a sight to behold, but the more worrying matter was the storm of raw energy crackling through the air.
, right. Wounded pride was a bitch, Tony supposed. That’s what Steve had come here for: To get the last word. To finally have Tony admit that he had been right all along.
For a moment, he could only lie there, gasping. There was a thin stream of blood dribbling down his forehead, and his lungs burned as if his ribs were bearing down on them. Somewhat dazed by the suddenness of it all, Steve pushed himself up into a sitting position. He rolled his head to the side, staring up at the sky. A deep peach—the sun creeping towards the horizon with a sliver of bright red.
Guh. It was beyond difficult to find words. He’d been sure they’d return to him once the shaking had settled into a post-coital hum. They didn’t. It seemed sex with Steve had rendered his mind goo along with the rest of him.
“I know you’re nervous,” Steve said, a patient smile on his face. “And believe me, I would love to just stay here. Watch a movie. But the thing is that…” He swallowed. “We’ve worked hard for this day.”
“It doesn’t mean anything,” Natasha tried to sooth him, of course knowing where his thoughts were heading.
Tony froze, fingers digging into Steve’s skin. But, to Steve’s credit, he didn’t move away from Tony one bit. On the contrary, he leaned forward, shielding Tony completely and likely giving Clint one hell of a view, what with the way he had his ass pointed straight towards the barn’s door.
“You’re a hero. It’s what you do. You fight and you fight more and then someone mucks up the works and makes you fight even harder. Just how it goes.”
Afterwards, he’d asked Tony how long it would take to implement DUM-E’s matrix into a warfare system.
A tiny crooked smile appeared on Tony’s lips. “Cute,” he said before he leaned down and started typing on the keyboard.
“Ah,” he commented, trying not to sound too alarmed, then fired-up his boot thrusters and raced towards the ground. His scanners confirmed that Romanov and Barton had likely inhaled the stuff as well, but by now, they were already on safe grounds, so what he did next was a no-brainer.
Tony’s hands grasped his as though it was Steve holding him to the world and letting go would make all fall away.
“It’s not,” Steve fired back. He depended on that knowledge. This wasn’t real. There was no place on this earth in which he’d find himself so intimately close to another man. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be.
When Tony glanced at him, he saw Steve struggling with words. He smiled at him, bringing their foreheads together as he put a hand on Steve’s cheek. “Yeah, I know. Sorry for turning up here like this, I just figured if I’d give you a heads-up, one of us would get sucked into another dimension or something.”
Suddenly, someone barged into the room. It was Coulson. His tie was a little askew, and it was the least put-together look Steve had ever seen on him.
Tony once more opened his mouth to say something, then closed it again. It was a thing he did these days, double-checking every word he said, and more often than not biting back whatever thought had come to mind.
Tony’s eyes flickered sideways, and Steve could see the gears in his head spinning. “What are the odds,” he eventually agreed.
unfair,” Tony whimpered, but his head leaned sideways nevertheless, and even his subdued panting and moaning was driving Steve crazy within seconds. Tony never used to be silent during sex, and Steve absolutely loved that about him, and refused to be deprived of it just because they were parents now.
Wrapping a hand around Tony’s arm, he started walking him to the door, but stopped in his tracks when Tony said, “I know you watched me in the river.”
“You gonna let me do it?” Tony rasped, the steady slide of his hips had Steve dangerously close to climax. “You gonna let me show you how good it can be?”
But no. He wasn’t. He remembered what it had felt like to be drowning in ice. It hadn’t felt like this.
“This would be a lot easier if we could… If we call them,” Bucky said, “bring in the others. Explain what’s going on. Fly to Siberia together and stop that bastard.”
“Had to kill the other guy,” the robot intoned gravely, and its voice was both resonating within the room and Tony’s head. “He was a good guy.”
Steve nodded, despite knowing that Bruce couldn’t see him. “I just…” He swallowed. “If he’s the devil, why… why is he even
For a second, Tony thought he might have seen a flicker of recognition on Barnes’ face; a flicker which quickly proved to be nothing. Tony’s heart fell. He should have predicted the possibility that Barnes wouldn’t recognize Steve at all. And he should have stopped Steve from getting his hopes up.
Now, this may sound bad, but Tony and Bucky made an agreement long ago when their relationship blossomed from a seedling to a sprout and Stark had been added into their relationship. Bucky was the oldest, he'd seen the world, he knew how to handle people and nearly anything the world put in front of him. It'd been made clear to Tony from the start that looks can be deceiving. Steve wasn't really very dominant. Every once in a while he'd get in a mood where all he wanted to do was be on top and make love to Natasha or fuck Bucky senseless, and they let him do as he pleased.
Peter outright promised that nobody was going to die, and Bucky reluctantly asked what kind of weapon he was looking for. Peter said he'd take whatever was concealable and would do a lot of damage. Bucky offered him a selection of blades and smaller handguns. Peter said he'd take a knife, as he didn't quite trust himself with guns just yet.
Meanwhile, back in Brooklyn, Tony was finally leaving Steve's apartment and heading home to Pepper. Steve knew now that Tony didn't know that Bruce was in with Hydra, and he kept it so that Tony didn't find out from him anyways. Steve waited until Tony was out of sight before calling Bucky again.
Peter is no longer keeping count of how many days he's been free of Hydra because he's now refusing to define his new life by something like that. He knows it hasn't been long, just over a month, but he's going to live the rest of his life however he damn well pleases.
"Buck this isn't you anymore. It's time to go. Let him go." He stepped up to Bucky and stood behind him, sliding his hand up his chest and settling it over his heart. He slid his other hand along Bucky's metal arm until their fingers touched. "Let him go, Buck."
Peter took a few quick steps backward and fell onto his back, the force of the fall knocking the air from his lungs. The mass sat atop of him, making it next to impossible to breathe. It leaned in close, definable only by its eyes... And then it smiled and leaned forward, allowing itself to be absorbed into Peter's body.
"You want to earn some slack, don't you Parker? Maybe you want to eat a meal while it's hot? Take a shower? Get a haircut? Maybe you want the chance to be dressed in something warmer than a paper dress? Sleep somewhere other than a box?"
"My system suffered a malfunction at 01:30:21 on Friday morning. My system did not reboot totally until 01:44:15, sir."
The day spent with Mr. Stark and Pepper was nice. They went shopping and Pepper made sure to help Peter sort his things into his own bags so he wouldn't accidentally leave without something of his.
The ornaments were a little old, leftover in a box of memories nobody'd opened in years. Old knickknacks covered in dust and sadness, forgotten in the ripple of time just like they once were. The box that Natalia found them in was old, bent in all of the wrong places and covered in a layer of dust so thick that the writing on the outside almost wasn't even legible anymore. The old penned cursive was faded, but Bucky knew Mrs. Rogers' handwriting anywhere.
The scarred man looks up at Steve from under the bill of his cap and mentions something about having the light beam checked because he noticed it didn't go off when he approached and Peter ended up startled, which was the exact reason that the lights were installed in the first place, so that didn't happen.
The next morning Peter woke to the scariest Russian assassins sleeping next to him in his bed, and for a moment it freaked him out. It's not every day you see such frightening people laying around and looking like the sweetest people on Earth. Peter was lucky that way.
All he could do was shake his head slowly, not nearly trusting his voice to carry a coherent thought across in a conversation. Steven sighed.
It was getting too easy. Why hadn't anything happened yet? Friday was meant to alert someone at the first sign of Bucky turning on them, so why hadn't anything happened?
Wade was sitting with his head in his hands when he heard a soft groan from the tub. He looked up to see Peter glancing around in confusion. "Wade?"
Once he had a dream sort of like this, except he and Bucky were romantically involved... It was kinda weird but he wouldn't deny the dream he had was a little hot. Peter didn't know what he was thinking right now, his head hurt too bad.
Peter didn't quite know what to do right now. He had a cellphone in one hand and a syringe in the other. He had a date with Wade tomorrow and his parents were upstairs probably wondering why he hadn't greeted them yet.
Once they reached the privacy of the Quinjet that Steve brought, he sighed and sat his shield down. "How did you get here?"
He pressed on through the trees, and the forest only seemed to get darker the farther in that he went. He pushed on through until he collided with a wall of trees. He turned around and there was a second wall. He was closed in by trees on all sides but one.
Bucky began to doze off and Steve pressed a kiss to the tender skin of his temple, on the side where the old machines used to torture him, to prove that he was more than what happened and that he always would be. "I love you, James."
Inside the Hydra base, on the very bottom basement floor, Wade and Peter were working on trying to escape. Their only other help was the imaginary James inside of Peter's head.
In his nightmares, they'd found him as a partially decomposing corpse, laying in a pool of his own crusted blood. And right next to him, always next to him, was that asshole in tights. Somehow Bucky knew that Wade wasn't the real cause for Peter's disappearance. If that bullshit mission to capture the mercenary was anything to go by anyway.
He could feel her looking at him now, and looking at where he stood. He was like an abused lapdog, loyal to a fault, staying around for the scraps. That was all he ever got. He hadn't had anything but the scraps from the feet of those that stood above him in so long now he forgot what a meal was like... But he couldn't leave, because he was needed. Wasn't he? That's what they said, after all.
So Steve pulled him closer, kissed him deeper, held him tighter. He tucked Bucky's unruly hair behind his ear and cupped his cheek. He shifted until he hovered over Bucky. The brunette looked up at him with loving and still lustful eyes. See, Bucky didn't bottom very much, but when he did it was a treat for everyone involved.
Bucky didn't move as he felt Steve sit down on the edge of the bed beside of him. Steve moved his arm away from his face, and that's when Bucky focused on his worry-stricken face.
Because Peter had been hanging out with those senior kids like it was no problem in the world. He let them pressure him into drinking even though he didn't want to, and with one of them making his drinks, it wasn't hard for his cup to get spiked.
They were all just empty words now, accompanied in his dreams by empty bodies. Empty promises and shattered hopes. He could see their bodies, but not their faces. Nothing that made them human. He had nightmares about their voices, their gentility. He only remembers glances of them, brief instances that he spent with them... But he had no idea who they were now. He had no idea if he'd ever see them again, whoever they were.
"He's alive, and he's at the same base that they're keeping Peter." Bucky's eyes were wide, filled with rage and terror and sadness all at once. Steve didn't blame him. Brock Rumlow was one of the men that was there when Bucky was being tortured. Steve was once able to piece that together after Bucky had awoken from a nightmare, shouting something about a skull and crossbones.
Then again, if he'd been phased, he wasn't going to say anything anyways. With Peter in this state, the last thing Wade wanted to do was put the kid farther off, and scolding him would do just that.
Peter then pounced on Wade once more, kissing him hungrily as Wade wrapped both arms around Peter to trap the younger boy against his chest. He dug his nails into Peter's back as the boy tried desperately grinding against him.
The old him pulled aside a picture frame on the wall and opened a small hatch, then the memory was gone. Peter, more curious than ever, carefully stood from his chair and made his way to the picture. In it he saw the woman, May, then in memory, he saw her again,
Getting into Tony's lab wasn't hard. Peter'd seen Tony put the code in hundreds of times already... Okay, that was a lie, but he memorized the code by just seeing it once.
Wade almost couldn't get enough of Peter's little gasps of pain. His head hung low as the stretch burned between his hips. It was painful but he loved it. He knew that for the next week when he moved he'd feel the memory of Wade fucking him in this dark little alleyway.
Bucky didn't take his eyes off of the mound of blankets and their gentle rise and fall. "I had to pick Peter up from school today."
Wade dug his thumbs into the soft skin of Peter's hips and the younger boy squirmed on his lap and it made their hips grind together. The action pulled a moan from the boy's lips and a smirk from Wade's.
Peter smiled to himself as he walked towards the door. He turns to the older man as he grabs the handle and repeats the one phrase he'd asked Nat to teach him. "You know what they say: Яблоко от яблони."
Natasha shrugs. "We can ask, but I doubt Peter would like that. Besides, I'm not sure she could help for very long."
He needed to be the guy that would get the job done and mow down anyone who got in the way. He needed to finish the mission with another success. He needed to make sure that Peter got out of here alive. And if Peter was already gone, he'd blow up the whole damn building while he was still inside.
Wade lifts his hips to grind against Peter and Peter responds by pulling his shirt off and tossing it across the back of the couch. Wade had to admit that the kid was fucking gorgeous. He was so sexy and he didn't have any goddamn clue what he could do.
"Tony's orders, Peter... You ran away, you've been gone for days..." She shook her head, hair falling into her eyes. "That Mercenary brought you back to us half dead, with one of the deadliest creatures inside of this facility... I don't know what you were thinking Peter, but now we need to know where he is. We need to know where Wade Wilson is and what he's done with VX9103."
Right now the screen showed his heart rate was elevated, almost to the point of a full-blown panic attack, but thankfully it was starting to slow again.
Steve's heart jumped at the sound of 'Aunt Peggy'. Steve thought that it made sense that Peggy would end up being like family to Tony, and all Steve could do was laugh and say, "You know, if I hadn't crashed, you might've been calling me Uncle Steve."
Figuring that he wouldn't be back here again for a while, he took his duffle bag from his room and his suitcase and stuffed them both full with most of the things that he left behind. He resorted to putting things in his backpack when he filled both of those up. He really had no intention of attending school today. He knew that by now his parents would all be out of the house, so it would be safe to go home.
So for now, it was just the two of them. And Bucky made easy work of getting Peter home, and into warmer clothes, and into bed underneath the best covers he and Steve had. He couldn't put him downstairs just yet as his part wasn't fixed up for him yet. And besides, he didn't want to leave him down there anyways, even if it was.
The longer he went on, the more anxious he became, wondering if he'd ever find his bedroom. Suddenly, the idea struck him, and as bad as it was it was the only one he had.
Wildly he thrashed, looking around like a frightened animal, and right now he was. But there they both were, alive and staring back at him with life in their eyes and in their veins and he looked down at himself and he was clean, still wearing his t-shirt and sweats from the night before and he was safe and so were they. He relaxed, suddenly realizing that it was nothing more than a dream once more.
Nat was kind enough to stay with him through the first sermon he ever remembered attending. She sat next to him calmly while he listened about God's plan for each and every person, each and every day. He wondered if him being kidnapped was somehow all a part of God's plan for him, and then he wondered why God was so cruel to him if it was. Had he done something to anger him? Was he not a good follower?
Peter, halfway to hysterics, pointed a shaking finger towards photo on the wall. "I saw her. She was, she was dead... Was it real?" Then, again, more desperately, "
Stephen Rogers, who was the most innocent little twerp in the world and had an obvious crush on me?"
He made what felt like a neverending trip to the point they were meant to meet. He saw Wade standing there, looking excited to see him. Peter reached into his coat as he approached the merc, who was still beaming. Peter approached quicker, easily pretending to be happy... And yanked the knife from inside his jacket, quickly plunging it into Wade's chest. There was a spurt of blood and a sickening crack of Wade's sternum as Peter shoved the blade as hard as he could into the merc's body.
Peter bounced into the kitchen and hugged Bucky like he hadn't seen him in forever. In reality, it'd only been a couple of days since Peter was here last. Bucky hugged him and even kissed him on the head.
Peter was silent as a hot plate of rice and sausage was sat on the table in front of him. He awaited Rumlow's permission to eat, and as soon as he had it, he dug into it. His body wasn't used to food this good. He'd been eating cold grits every day for at least a month, so this was a treat. Rumlow ate across from him in silence, just watching the boy.
Cold. She knew it was cold. The goosebumps on both of their arms proved that. If he wasn't going to shoot her then... Then he was going to make her suffer.
He covered his ears to try and drown it out, but it was coming from the inside of his head, not the outside. There was no way to escape the shrill sound pounding away at his eardrums. All he could do was curl in on himself and wait for it to fade away.
...And then his cries were over as suddenly as they began, and he was dead silent, eyes shifting as if he was listening for something. And he was. Very faintly Peter could hear the vibrations of his cell phone. He stormed over to it and ripped it out of his jacket pocket.
Peter felt at home in Wade's arms. And Wade, well, despite the sins that were about to ensue, felt blessed. He had this young boy in his arms and the boy wasn't even fazed by his humor or his skin.
Nobody seemed to mind that he didn't talk much, because some days nobody else said a whole lot either. As of right now, he was sat on a small swivelling stool in Tony's lab, having his arm worked on while Steve and Nat watched on, discussing more plans and ideas about the move. He'd been kinda zoned out, but when he finally focused he heard Nat say, "It's gonna be our first Christmas with Peter. We should at least be able to do it somewhere he's comfortable, and that place isn't here."
He stands outside of her apartment building for a long minute, looking up at the floor that she lives on to hype himself up and go over his words one more time. He finally enters the building and takes the stairs two at a time up to her floor. As soon as he left the stairwell he could feel the nerves begin to build up, but he forced them back down.
Tony... Steve didn't really know how he was supposed to feel about everything Tony'd just put him through in the last few months. They'd been arguing so much, but half of the time Steve didn't even know what they were arguing about. They'd argue for hours and make it from point A all the way to point Z and then some in as little as an hour. Their voices rose to levels so ungodly that Steve was glad the rooms were sound-proof.
TW: gore, self-mutilation, abuse, murder/death. This episode may contain graphic details of how May died.
Rumlow sighed and brushed the dust from his shirt before dragging a once again unconscious Natasha towards one of the meat lockers. He pulled the heavy door open and the blast of freezing cold air made him shiver before he dragged her inside. Carefully, he propped her up in a corner and then turned on his heel to leave.
Peter went to kneel down next to Wade's extremely dead body, but Rumlow pointed the gun at him, urging him not to move, lest he want to be shot too.
Tony looked down at the teen where he slept. He was curled up into a tight ball, blankets bunched at the foot of his bed. He shook his head and pulled the covers over Peter and sat on the end of the bed with his back against the wall. He watched the web-slinger as he slept, strands of hair falling into his face and sighed.
Peter slid his other hand up underneath Wade's shirt, fingers brushing over his chest. With a smirk, he dragged his blunt nails down Wade's skin, finally stopping at the elastic of Wade's sweats.
"I see everyone die... All the time. Torn apart, tossed around. Everyone... All of them. All of you."
When they arrived, his jaw dropped at the giant room filled with all kinds of technology that he'd never seen before.
Rumlow left Bucky's line of sight as he ducked into the alleyway and Bucky cursed rather loudly as he picked up the speed as much as possible.
May's laughter was distant now, echoing in his ears as he brought the shaking knife to his wrist. His body wracked with sobs as he slowly, painfully dragged it across the width of his wrist. It stung, but he wanted it, he needed it, he knew he deserved it as payment for his sins...
Bucky felt shocked, but he just nodded, smiling softly when Peter looked up at him over the edge of the paper. "Okay, Petey."
As of right now, he was sitting on a rickety old counter going shot for shot with some of the senior kids that showed up earlier with alcohol. MJ and Ned were looking on in concern while Peter laughed loudly with these senior kids. One of the senior boys was leaning on the counter next to Peter and touching on his leg. Whether Peter noticed or not, they didn't know.
He made sure to get the note to Bucky before he was finished packing, and the man thanked him with a kiss on the top of the head. Peter couldn't deny that knowing that he was going to be alone here in Wakanda scared him immensely, so much so that he wanted to cry at just the thought of Bucky abandoning him, even if it was necessary.
And Wade reaches out and grabs Peter by the hand. Wade didn't know if he took Peter's hand to stop him from clawing at the scars, or just for the sake of holding his hand. Maybe it was both. Wade wondered if Peter felt what he felt. Though Wade didn't even know what he felt.
Bucky said nothing as he and Steve sipped their drinks, only speaking once their cups were empty. He pointed to the ceiling above them and smirked, "Mistletoe."
Natasha brushed past Tony and Bucky both to pull Peter into her arms. She shushed him gently as she led him from the room.
He tried to sit up only to be yanked back to the bed. When he looked, he saw the thick leather strap holding him captive, but the wild breath in him was slowed when he heard a voice calling his name. He wasn't sure where exactly to look for it, so he just looked wildly in search of the voice he seemed to know.
Eddie, halfway out the window turned back and as he spoke, Peter could hear the Symbiote's voice. "Anyone."
Peter took three big steps back the moment he saw them, two bright white eyes. Unblinking, they stared up from him from low to the floor, the pupil-less masses urging Peter closer without a word, but he willed himself to be still. To be sane. Doing so may have been the only way he'd stay alive.
"I... Bought this for you, right?" She nods, watching the way that Peter smiles over remembering that he gifted the bracelet to her.
He remembers the relieved look on Tony's face when he walked into the tower a couple of days later. The moving day had been moved back a couple of weeks due to the incident, so he was able to stay in bed for a couple of days until it didn't hurt so bad to breathe anymore.
And Bucky, standing there staring at the little boy in front of him, broken and bruised and covered in blood and beaten beyond any possible repair... He wanted to cry. He knew what it was like to be on the other end of Hydra's neverending torture. He knew what it was like to be treated like someone else for so long that you forget who you used to be. He knew what it was like to wish so desperately that someone knew him enough to bring him back.
This was the time that Ned and MJ decided to intervene because they remembered that Peter had said that he'd been seeing someone, and it wouldn't be good for him to be caught hooking up with someone at a party.
Tony bit his lips and Steve glanced from Tony's face to his own crotch and Tony took that as an incentive to reach down and rub Steve's dick through his jeans. Steve shifted his hips a little, arching up into Tony's hand.
She was no longer his aunt. Now she was merely just the husk of what she used to be. It was her skin. Her hair. Her bones... But it wasn't her.
This time the person took an interest. "Oh, you poor, deluded child... Deadpool works for us. He has
a short filler, will be continued in the next chapter, was going to be longer but I procrastinated and would miss my deadline if I tried to put it all in one chapter :(( sorry.
Steve leaned against the front door and closed his eyes... It was gonna be a good life, starting now.
On every wall he came to there was no light switch to be found and the darkness continued to consume him. He saw something dart across the hallway not far in front of him. A sweeping mass of uncertainty lingered around him as he went. He knew that whatever was following him could not be stopped. It could be slowed down at the least, with webs, but he still didn't have his suit.
Wade laughed and agreed to make him something while he dressed, and Peter nodded. Peter waited for Wade to leave the bathroom before sitting on the edge of the tub. Wade came back a couple of minutes later with a sandwich and a can of Sprite, which Peter gladly took.
The wooden door opened partially, but even through the small opening Peter could easily tell that something inside was wrong. He pushed gently on the door and called for May again. The door opened all the way, only stopping when it ran into the table against the wall behind it. May was nowhere to be seen. Peter could see the dust floating through the air and coating all of the furniture. It was abundantly clear that nobody'd been here in months.
He blinked again, but there she was, standing in front of him. He jumped, despite knowing that she wasn't real. She was covered in blood and even from here he could see that her heart was nothing more than a large cavity.
Wade just shakes his head and sits up a little straighter, "Oh, no, you're okay it's just... Nobody's ever asked me that. You know, what my life was like? Nobody's ever wanted to know more about me than what I look like under the suit." He lets out a laugh, but it sounds more nervous than anything, so Peter is quick to say that he doesn't have to tell him anything if he doesn't want to.
Tony stood still, but Steve kept on going. "You've kept him locked up on this base for months! You haven't taken him anywhere, you haven't let him go anywhere, and you've sectioned off a whole list of places he isn't allowed to go! Tony, he's a kid and you're not letting him have any fun. You're not letting him do what he knows he can do."
Right now it was almost like Peter was the one who'd been brainwashed by Hydra, and maybe he had. Nobody but Peter really knew the severity of what'd happened to him. They never thought it would be alright to ask, in the grand scheme of things he hasn't been home with them for very long. He still wasn't even fully healed in some places like his leg. Bucky thinks it's taking all the kid has to walk without a limp.
He looked down at the little spider and suddenly wanted to protect him with everything he had, even if it meant his life.
Which parent, he didn't know. Whichever came to get him when Ned called... Speaking of, Peter needed to have a talk with Ned about that one.
He always woke with a jolt, and a quick reflex to hit whoever was too close. It made him feel awful that he'd hurt someone else. He was supposed to be getting better, and now he was. But Peter was having nightmares now. He'd become so claustrophobic that he got antsy standing in the elevator for more than three minutes at a time. It was awful to watch Peter suffer like that, and they all wished there was more that they could do.
After the final moments of bliss had passed and everyone caught their breaths, they fixed their clothing and shared kisses and finished their coffee. Steve took to cleaning up any mess in the area while they waited for Tony to arrive with Peter and Bruce. Having Bruce over took some deliberation on all parts, but eventually, they decided, what the hell. Because Bruce was their friend, and despite everything, they still loved Tony and wanted him to be happy, even if it wasn't with them.
The man then unfolded it for him and stood on the other side of the table. On the cloth were various objects, ranging from a scalpel to a lighter. Peter furrowed his brows in confusion.
He tried to suck in the air that he needed to answer her, but he couldn't. He just stood there gaping like a fish out of water. He touched his chest, and Natasha made a mental note to teach him sign-language soon.
He tucked his hair behind his ear. He knew it was pretty long now, but he didn't really want to cut it right now. He thought the shoulder-length style kinda suited him. He kinda liked the way it curled out around his shoulders. It made him feel... Different, but in a nice way. In all of the pictures he'd seen of himself, his hair had never been this long.
"You passed out. Peter, can you tell me if you've been suffering from shortness of breath? Increased heart rate? Dizziness? Um, chills? A sense of intense fear?"
Peter wasn't zoned in all of the way. He was aware of the weight on his shoulders from his books in Wade's backpack. He could hear the cars passing on the street. He could feel Wade's grip on his arm as he led them through the concrete jungle.
Bucky lowered his gun just as Nat and Steve appeared behind him. With a furrowed brow he spoke. "You remember who I am?"
Bucky's lips held a smile though, and his cheeks were flushed a beautiful rosy pink. Steve could never get enough of how gorgeous his boy was. It was a dream come true to be with him every day.
He was good at it. Or, he thought he was anyways. It stopped working on Bucky after about three months of them knowing one another.
Peter strides over and lifts himself onto the small countertop. He pulls his knees up to his chest and rests his arms on them, eyes totally focused on Wade, whom Peter is hoping will share more of his story with him.
Peter was getting frustrated by his lack of sleep. It made schoolwork hard to focus on and it made training difficult. He felt like there was something wrong with him, that he was a freak that couldn't ever get any damn shuteye. He felt like the others were judging him, Mr. Banner, Wanda, even Scott when he was on base.
Wade poked his head out of the bathroom and saw that the girl that helped him was awake, sitting next to MJ who was still sleeping. He whisper-yelled to her, asking what her name was. She told him it was Marie. If it was the truth or not he didn't care. She asked if he had a smoke she could bum, and he said yes, but only if she'd carry the trash out when she went to smoke it.
MJ looked up when the bathroom door opened and Wade came out of it. Behind him, all of the kids began filing out of the bathroom, all looking afraid from their lives. One of the girls was shaking, and the sleazy one was covered in blood. It looked like it was his own. The kids all sprinted out of the front door and Wade crouched down by Peter, who was awake once again awake, but still mostly unresponsive.
And with that, they left, not looking back once, and smiling at everyone as they passed. And Bucky's only coherent thought as he watched them go was,
Peter pulls his jacket closer to his body. He's not really dressed for the weather, purposely only wearing a thin jacket despite the thick snow. He left early this morning to avoid seeing his parents and getting scolded for his lack of preparation for the day. He took a total detour from school after he got off of the train, walking in the totally opposite direction.
Tony wished he knew the answer, but all he could do was hold this boy, hold his son, hold him tightly.
Peter cried something that sounded like 'thank you' over and over again, but he was sobbing so hard it was hard to tell, so Wade folded his body over Peter's to achieve maximum depth as he continued to abuse his sore little hole. He left hot slobbery kisses on Peter's neck as he stroked him in time with his thrusts. He felt Peter pushing his hips back against him, and he was fucking living for it.
It was almost like Peter was waiting for Wade's permission to cum, because in the next couple of moments, Peter stilled, and then he spilled his load all over his own chest. Wade didn't think twice to take that moment to cum inside of Peter, either.
He just wanted to bring the boy back. He wanted his laughter to fill in the silence around them. He wanted the boy's smile to dull the ache in his chest. He wanted to teach the boy more. The boy who had so much to live for. He had so much ahead of him, and Bucky would be damned if Peter didn't get to see it.
Peter looks up as he plugs a thin cord into the top of the code box and then links it to what looks like an old Game Boy. "I need out of here, and I need you to help me."
With that, Bruce turned and walked back into the apartment without sparing so much as a glance back in Tony's direction. Sure, Tony will admit, not out loud or to anyone else, hell, barely even to himself that yes. The real reason he started hooking up with Bruce in the first place was to get Steve's attention back. He thought if they were caught sleeping together then Steve would have no choice but to pay some attention to him... But then Nat caught them in the most ridiculous way. With Tony laying like a pretentious asshole across their bed and Bruce, knelt down between his legs blowing him like his life depended on it.
"Last year... There was this girl I liked, and her dad... He was a bad guy. Stole all kinds of tech, remade it, and then sold it... I didn't have my suit at the time, so I was basically wearing sweats and a hoodie, and... I took a lot of damage... Lots of bruising, um... We crashed a plane, and I was thrown a good couple hundred feet... I was in so much pain I didn't want to move, but I knew I had to..."
For everyone to see just how willing Peter was to save another teammate was refreshing... But the manner in which he saved them wasn't refreshing at all. This whole scenario was the kind of refreshing that came with opening a fresh bottle of water, only to realize the water is hot.
Steve sighed and pulled Tony close. "I'm not saying I'm done being mad about this, because I'm not."
He put the food away and, figuring that Peter wouldn't take a real break to eat, settled for bringing him a snack. He crouched down next to Peter's chair and a moment later, the younger lad was looking down at him. Wade gave him a soft smile and offered him a package of pop-tarts.
Loud boots were coming down the hallway, and they didn't even have to look to know that it was Bucky. He was angry, but what was new?
Once she got Peter calmed down enough that he could breathe properly, she got him to crawl back into bed. As soon as he turned his music on in his headphones, he was out like a light.
And that one word really covered all of the questions. How would he leave them? How would they be found? How would they know that's what they were? They were both looking at him and he was quick to understand. He was the key to finding their boy.
And as Bucky looked down at the puppy who bared his younger sister's name, he wanted to cry again, but this was Christmas, and Christmas was no place for tears. Not now anyway, hell, he and Steve just got engaged for fuck's sake, this was no time to be sad.
Peter, however, did not go to rest. He went instead down the hall and into the kitchen. He was pained but he was hungry. He didn't want to mention the injury, but Wanda noted his pain and discomfort the moment he walked into the room.
Bucky followed Friday's directions to the letter, slowing his bike down as he approached the place that Peter was supposed to be in. He stopped the bike. Friday insisted that this was where the signal was coming from.
Following the doctor inside the church was easy. He was preoccupied with his phone and it was easy to tell he'd never been taught that looking over his shoulder should be second nature. It was clear this guy had probably never been tailed like this in his life, and with the coating Stark made for the bottom of their shoes, their footsteps were literally silent anyways.
He watched from the bathroom door as the girls made their bed and went to sleep. He switched the light off before closing the bathroom door so as not to disturb them. He thought it was kinda fucked that they had to be so grown up tonight, despite their young ages.
"Baby, what's the matter?" Steve brushed Bucky's hair from his face. He didn't use the pet names very often, but Bucky loved it when he did. Steve knew, but he didn't want to use them too much, in case it started to be too much for Bucky instead.
When Peter woke up, the first thing he was made aware of was the searing pain in his body. It burned in his leg and in his shoulder, and for a moment he couldn't remember why. It took him a long minute, but then he remembered the way that those Hydra agents shot Wade right over him... The way that they shot him at close range without care.
Without any kind of plan, Peter pulled on some clothes without bothering to shower. He went down the hall and to the kitchen, where Tony and Wanda were. He walked around Tony like he was another piece of furniture in the way. In his jacket pocket was Wade's iPod. He figured he ought to return it, as Wade must be bored without it.
He glances up to Wade who is indeed being very quiet, just people-watching. Peter leans into his side and watches a smile break out on his face. Wade turns and he feels the older man kiss his head and he sighs softly in near content before he suddenly remembers why they're there and what he's about to do.
Peter was short on breath. He could FEEL all the rubble on top of him. He could smell the settling dust, the metallic smell of his own blood. He could taste the copper on his tongue.
"I don't know who that is! I have no idea who the hell you're talking about!" He's getting really worked up about it now, he can't help it. It's so goddamn frustrating not remembering the simplest of things. As of this point in time, he doesn't even know when his own birthday is. All he knows is what happen at Hydra and a few very vague and unimportant things from long before that.
"Buck? Are you coming?" Steve could see Bucky's hands shaking as he stared at what used to be their front door. "Baby?"
The man that Wade spoke to starts driving the boat towards an island in the middle of the water, and that's when Wade finally breaks the silence. "Casco Bay. Just off the coast of Maine."
Nat stood and gently ruffled Peter's too-long hair before asking him if he was interested in having some of Bucky's stew, and he agreed with a smile. Bucky glanced over his shoulder with a smile and made up a bowl for Peter as Nat wheeled him up to a place at the table. He said a sweet thanks for Bucky as a bowl was placed in front of him.
Three days. He has to wait three days to see Peter again, and he already misses the little web-slinger so much. Monday, Peter will be cleared to go back to school, which means he'll be unsupervised. Whenever Peter gets the chance, he's going to slip away from the school to meet up with Wade, and they'll probably end up fucking in an alleyway somewhere close to the school. It's an amazing thought that Peter would still want anything to do with him, though, Peter didn't know what he'd done yet, and he certainly didn't know what was going to happen the more time they spent together.
The wall opposite him was lined with windows and outside he could see the sun cresting the horizon, but it was unclear to him if it was rising or setting. He had no bearings, and it was disorienting as fuck.
As far as eyeshadow palettes went, these were some of the best and maybe most expensive. Just simple glances to the packaging gave away their names,
He ended up crying himself to sleep on the cold metal table, and when he woke there was a hand over his mouth. Afraid, he fought before seeing the masked Deadpool over him. As soon as Wade removed his hand, he started crying again.
They sounded so far away, and, the room is too fast, sit, sit... Fall. He fell. He didn't try to catch himself, he just fell straight down onto the tile like a bag of bricks. He was out before he even touched the ground.
"You're scaring him!" Wade snapped, and the thought of scaring Peter seemed to be enough to snap Bucky back because in the next second he was freeing Peter from his grip. He was staring at Peter as he crumpled to the ground, but his free hand pulled his gun and pointed it at Wade.
If he thought that Peter was loud before... Jesus Christ, Peter fucking screamed. Like actually yelled from the pleasure. His mind was just fucking gone at this point, focused on nothing but his own pleasure. Wade could feel Peter's drool on his arm but he didn't care anymore. All he wanted to do now was make Peter cum harder than ever before. He wanted to make Peter writhe and scream and cum for hours on end, but for right now he'd have to settle for making the most out of the little bit of time they had.
It showed Wade, and it showed a group of guys they didn't recognize grabbing Peter. They heard a familiar voice on the recording, but the camera didn't catch who it was, so there was no way to be totally sure. There was one thing they knew for sure though.
"I wanted to keep you away from this life, kid... Seems like all we've done is drag you into it... No more, Petey. I want you to be done with this. Powers or not, I want you as far away from this as possible... If I have to move you to Alaska, I will, you hear?" He sighed and shook his head. "Maybe not that far, but I want you safe, and I know Tony and Steve do too, hell, they all do... I'm gonna get you out of this life... I promise."
Tony took a deep breath and was silent for a very long moment. "I hope we find that Red sonuvabitch soon... Cause when we do, I'm gonna kill him."
Eventually, he just turned his phone off, knowing that anyone else would just contact him through his watch, but even that was starting to get annoying. He was ready to go find somewhere quiet that he could be left alone for a while. Maybe he could get Flash to stick him into a locker and he can just stay there for the rest of the day.
She and Vision were in the middle of their weekly cooking lesson, so Peter just grabbed an apple that he ended up never eating.
Wade looked around. "It'd take the world's greatest detective to find us. And I don't see Bruce Wayne around anywhere, so I'd say we're good for a while."
He had Peggy, but she wasn't really his. It was 1945. After Steve went into the ice, Peggy went on to fight, like he knew she would. She had a family. A husband, children. She became a godmother in 1970 when Howard and Maria had their baby. Steve would have only made her life more difficult... It's strange to think that if he'd been around, he probably would have been Tony's godfather all the same.
Peter was aware of one thing when he woke: he was alone. But that wasn't unusual for him, as he was quite used to being left on his own for long periods of time.
He felt Wade's hands roaming his body and he felt a tingle in his veins, but he soon became aware that it was a tingle of fear as the little girl approached. Peter was weighed down by fear, and by Wade's arms. He couldn't move anywhere, but he could hear Wade's voice in his ear.
He knew Peter would protest everything that had anything to do with anyone else finding out about his wound, and so Bucky just sighed.
Somewhere not so deep down he knew that if Bucky hadn't taken the job, he would have. Part of him wishes that he'd taken it, just so he could take the pleasure of squeezing the life out of that brainless motherf-
Quickly, he tapped the small button on the front of his vest. "Nat he's coming to you, do you read?"
There would be no end to this until Rumlow decided it was supposed to be over. That time didn't come fast enough, and neither did Rumlow. This was one of those moments where Peter wished the man above him would put more pressure on the pillow and just end his fucking suffering.
He was a little shocked when the guy shook his head no. "No dude, from the museums, from the history."
When Peter woke, his bed was empty, but there was a dent in his blankets. "Friday, was someone here last night?"
He knew that she agreed wholeheartedly. They'd both been swallowed by the spotlight and spit back out again after they'd been chewed like they were nothing more than waste. They never had a choice, but Peter does. And if Peter doesn't remember being a hero, then obviously he can't go back. They're not going to train him as a hero, they're going to treat him like a son... When all of the paperwork is finished, he will be, and they'll be 100% responsible for Peter and his life.
He began to feel drowsy but kept fighting despite that. He couldn't let himself be taken, not now. He promised Bucky that he'd be home!
Peter just thought for a long moment, deciding that he just wanted to ask the most unimportant questions. Maybe they were unimportant to others, but to them, these may just be the most important questions that could be asked. The questions that made them feel more human, as though they were more than what had happened to them.
Tony turns back to the ceiling, now somewhat furious. "FRIDAY, alert all personnel to a facility-wide search and put out covert ABP's on Peter and the mercenary Deadpool as well." He kept talking as he walked down the hall, Bucky and Steve following behind him. "Deadpool is armed and dangerous and he's meant to be brought back here in as many pieces as possible. Peter is to be brought back unharmed but should still be considered dangerous."
They lay together in the bed and Peter puts a pillow between them to make sure they stay on their respective sides of the bed... If by morning the pillow is discarded on the floor and the pair are curled up together, well, nobody needs to know.
Natasha flipped the switch and the lights turned on with an audible clank... And Steve didn't know what else to do but yell in pure rage as he stared at the chair in the middle of the room.
It was like an alarm going off in their heads, because in the next moment they were both waking up, instantly checking on the child lying between them.
"Наклоняться." He told her, and she did. She hiked up her slip and bent at the hips over the counter in front of Steve, who wasted no time in grabbing onto her thighs and gently guiding his way inside of her. The quiet little gasp she let out was enough for them both to hear. With everyone busy with the move and the remodeling on top of their other jobs and caring for Peter, the three of them hadn't fucked like this in far too long.
Nat watched on. Bucky and Peter held each other so highly. They were talking quietly, each sporting huge smiles. Peter was going on about how excited he was for Bucky to open the gift he got him. Bucky felt the same, telling Peter that if he didn't like it then he could always pick something else, but Peter insisted that he'd love it no matter what it was.
Eddie stepped around him to the window and then paused. "Oh, and you might want this." Eddie pulled a large syringe from inside his jacket and put it into his hands.
The adrenaline was the only thing keeping him on his feet at this point, it was the only thing making him strong enough to do any kind of damage. He didn't have the time to be weak right now, his strength was the difference between living his life and dying.
Steve looked bewildered, though his posture was rigid, firm. He was still like a wall and his voice was cold as ice. "I got him shot?"
Wade sat up, taking Peter with him before obliging to Peter's wishes and taking his red sweater off. Peter could see the remnants of what once could have been considered a tattoo of sorts, but now the skin was nothing more than burns and dark discoloration. Peter figured it had to have been from a time before Wade's mutation because Wade's healing factor probably wouldn't allow him to have tattoos now.
After another long, sleepless week of trying to follow Peter's scattered bread crumbs, they came to a stop. They had all the crumbs they needed to piece the loaf together. Peter's clues were few and far between, but once Bucky found the first one scratched into the paint on the train he took to find Wade, they weren't too awfully difficult to notice once they happened across them.
"Forvige me father, I believe I've sinned... I don't think I've ever confessed in my life, but I'd like to start."
Would anyone look down on him for not wanting to keep it? Could he really live with himself if he did? What would Aunt May think? He wished he had her perspective right now.
Bucky was quick to hang up and Peter put a lot of effort into pulling himself up off of the bathroom floor and down the hall to the office. The secretary asked Peter if he'd called someone and he said yes before being offered a couch to lay on, but Peter decided that curling up on the floor would be just fine.
Steve kept his arm around Bucky and still held his hand as he walked him from the room. Natalia joined them on their walk, an arm slung around Bucky, leaning on him while they made their way out and down the hall to their bedroom.
Peter was vaguely nodding along to what Wade was saying all while being helped to his feet and out of his clothes.
Just before he closed the door, he tossed his pistol in with her. So if she managed not to freeze to death, she could at least kill herself before the hypothermia took over.
I'm so sorry I'm just now getting a new chapter to you, life has been crazy with family stuff, and I moved! I really hope you guys are still out there wanting to read this. I love you guys, and this story is for you.
Bucky had been teaching him weapons, as had Nat. Steve taught him more hand-to-hand, as you can never be too over-prepared in this line of work. Bucky thought he was pretty good with guns, but if Peter wasn't ready, then he wasn't ready, and that was okay.
And yes, Tony will admit that somewhere inside he still had feelings for the old man, but it was too much too late now. Steve had just proposed to a man he'd been with much longer than Tony had even been alive. Tony leaned on the railing and hung his head.
Tonight was one of those nights that everyone was gone. Nearly the whole team was away and it left the base eerily silent. Peter sat up from his bed and pulled his blanket tight around his shoulders. He clutched his pillow to his chest and went in search of a different place to sleep.
The only people that were truly paying attention to how long Peter had been missing now, were the Hydra agents, and everyone at S.H.I.E.L.D. who was tasked with finding him. Half of the Agents were ready to give up, knowing that they'd probably never again find the boy in question... And the other half knew that if they didn't find him, then it would be hell for everyone involved.
He tilted his head as if to ask her what else he possibly could have done, but then he laughed. "Don't worry, Romanoff. I didn't have time to kill your man candy. No, I'm not interested in them... I'm not even interested in you... But I figured you're the fastest way to get to Steve, and he's the one that'll talk first."
Peter just laughed, cheek pressed against Wade's chest. "If I ask you what this cost, you, will you tell me the truth?"
Nat sat there with him for a little while before placing a much needed call to a number that she took from Peter's phone. It rang a couple of times, but once the call started, she wasted no time in speaking.
Wade was getting angrier now, especially knowing that he'd been given such a strong date-rape drug. He stepped closer to the kid, demanding to know what time they drugged Peter, to begin with. The soberest of the little group answered from the door, her voice meek. She said it'd only been maybe 45 minutes since they slipped it into his cup. Even the smaller doses of GHB could last up to 4 hours. Knowing this, he demanded once more- and none too gently- to know how much they gave him. She said it was a little more than he would need because he's smaller than the people the others usually dose up.
"Your son is nothing short of a genius, and although my own sister is very smart on her own, she has wished for a second opinion, and mine will not do."
. He wasn't any kind of worried about killing a man in the house of God in the slightest, and that made Bucky worry.
Because with Peter sitting on the couch, an arm slung over his face, Steve Rogers wanted nothing more than to be the best goddamn parent in the world.
"Then prove that you know how to follow orders, Parker. Pick up the lighter." The man leaned on the table, waiting.
He knew that if he had a chance of getting out, he needed to find that man, that Deadpool. The line of a Michael Jackson song from his childhood made it's way into his thoughts, and he knew that it was the thought he needed to hold onto. It was the mentality that would earn him his freedom one day.
Bucky sighed heavily and hesitated for a long minute before reaching into his back pocket and pulling out a folded piece of paper and slipping it into Peter's hands. "This is a lot to handle, but I'm right here for you, Petey, no matter what."
He was leaned against the headboard, just staring at the wall across from him. Today was definitely going to be difficult. Memories were presenting themselves to him despite a month of peaceful, ignorant bliss. No matter how much he blinked, he couldn't shake the memories he was being presented with and the fact that Wade had left at some point didn't help in the slightest.
Wade kept violently beating against Peter's prostate, moaning because Peter tightened up with each thrust. Peter was getting a little too loud now. If anyone passed by the alleyway they'd think someone was being taken against their will, but Wade just couldn't bring himself to muffle Peter's chants of 'oh Wade, yes, fuck, yes, yes, yes, god it's so good, fuck!'. The chanting didn't last long because soon enough Peter couldn't even form words, producing nothing more than babbles and moans and whines, but they were so goddamn loud Wade finally had to reach up and cover Peter's mouth.
Steve, ever the gentleman, paid for their coffee and gently asked Tony if he wanted to go back to his apartment and watch the new season of
Wade doesn't deny it. Inside of the next bag is actually something they'd discussed over text recently. It's small, but it kind of means a lot to Peter, especially since he's trying to reinvent this person that he's going to be. He wants to do it right. So when he pulls out the tissue paper, all he can do is smile.
Wade laid beside him as they kissed, and it was lazy and careful and soft. Wade's lips were gentle as they brushed across his jaw, fingers light as they danced across his hip, laugh soft as Peter breathed his name.
Wade's cheeks flushed as his dick strained against his sweats. Peter didn't move, waiting for absolute consent. The moment Wade nodded, it was like a free-for-all.
The air inside the Quinjet was thick, tense. Everyone inside had the same thought, but nobody wanted to vocalize it. They were all sure that they'd find Peter, but their one collective thought was,
He turned to MJ, basically claiming her as a new sidekick of sorts. "You need to get all of those other kids out of there before I start shooting everyone in their knees."
While everyone sat down to breakfast, Nat could tell that something was a little but off with Peter. When nobody was looking, he just looked sad, lonely. She could see him touching his stomach every once in a while, and it didn't take a genius to figure out what had him down. It was Wade. The fact that he wasn't present had her little spider upset, and as soon as she figured it out, she started wondering what there was for her to do about it.
"You seem to be doing just fine." He sighed as he laid back. He looked at the small ring on his right ring finger, the only thing that made this May even remotely real. She wasn't anything but a hologram produced by Peter's hippocampus. Out of all of the things he's invented, this one had to be one of the worst ones.
Peter stretched out on the bed a little and his shirt rode up to reveal a patch of tan skin that Wade just couldn't stop himself from kissing. It made Peter shiver again and Wade took it as a sign from above that little Peter was getting off on the idea of Wade, too.
royalty looking nothing shy of a fucking hobo and his cheeks flushed as he reached his hand out to shake, "Your Highness, a pleasure."
Meanwhile, upstairs, Tony Stark seemed to be losing his mind for the 100th time as he paced the 5th floor balcony. A worried Bruce watched on as Tony procrastinated going back into the apartment.
He looked up at the closest person, Wanda, and she nodded as she gently took it, quietly asking if it would be okay to put it on his wrist. He nods and holds it out to her and she, being the Saint that she is, pays no mind to the things already there and gently fastens the watch on. The screen lights up and displays his heart rate to him, and she quietly points to the little icons and tells him what they mean after he asks her to.
Bucky frowned impossibly harder and turned to Nat. She seemed to understand, just like Steve did. Despite the whole ordeal, they'd all just gone through, Peter needed Tony. He just hoped they'd all be on the same page of pretending that nothing happened between them, for Peter's sake. The poor kid had enough going on already as it was, they didn't want to add to his stress.
Peter wanted to protest, but the look Wade gave him was enough to make him shut his mouth before the words even had a chance to escape... But then he got an idea, and it was wild and wicked and he loved the thought. "Well," he slid his hand up Wade's chest, "can I at least show my gratitude?"
The burned man led him through another set of doors and into a room, empty of everything except for a metal table and a chair. He looked up at the man but was forced to sit down in the chair. He bit back the questions on his tongue as he looked over the table. On top of it was a large cloth, folded over something he couldn't see yet.
Sorry about how long it's been, I'm trying to pack up to move in a couple of months on top of still trying to graduate.
Once she'd found him out as Spider-Man, she finally understood why he was awake so often in the night. She understood the nightmares that woke him from the few hours of sleep he managed to get.
"It's not you guys, it's me, I... I don't even know who I am anymore, and I appreciate you guys including me, but I just don't remember. I don't, I'm sorry." There were tears of anger and frustration in his eyes and no matter how much he blinked they refused to go away and it was just frustrating him more.
"He... Dropped me from high up, he threw me onto the ground, slammed me into things... Slammed my head into the ground... His suit exploded, and I couldn't just let him die. He was a bad guy, but I couldn't leave him to die, Wade, I couldn't do it."
Forklifts and bulldozers and cranes lifting hundreds of pounds of metal and cement slabs way above the heads of the city-goers.
He wished he could say that he'd never had to dig a bullet out of his own skin before. The last time he'd done so was in May's bathroom. It took him three hours to finally remove the bullet and another hour to clean up afterward. Thank God May had been out that day.
Wade looks up at her, his mask concealing the slight shock on his face. He takes a breath and stares into her eyes while she stares back at where she thinks his eyes should be. "Don't you mean, 'people like us'?"
And the whole room seemed to stop. There wasn't a single sound in the air aside from the vibrating of Peter's watch and his heart-wrenching cries.
(PSA, lots of annoying over-detailing in this one but idgaf. I actually sat for a while adding things into a cart on the Ulta website so I knew what to write and what Wade's all-around price would be.)
For now, he didn't hesitate to open his mouth for Bucky's hardened length, but Bucky didn't move. Bucky watched him with hawk-like eyes for any sign of misbehavior. For any sign of guilt or remorse. Any sign of anything but lust. Despite the situation, the last thing Bucky wanted right now was to be intimate with Tony.
Everything started to go dark, but he fought to keep his eyes open. He saw Wade be lifted to his feet by men in black suits. Wade pulled the blade slowly from his chest.
