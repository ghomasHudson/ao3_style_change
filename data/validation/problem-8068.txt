"Hi," he said.  Steve was wearing one of the hotel's robes.  He looked pretty good. Smelled good, too.
"I didn't say anything," said Sam, holding his hands up.  "Look, he's got a meeting with Dr. Brazinski in thirty.  You guys wanna get lunch?  ...I'll make sure we're back for the simulation component," he added quickly, seeing Steve's look of hesitation.
Despite wanting to panic, Steve still made it to the toilet. He was pretty sure he managed to pee in the bowl but it was hard when he couldn't actually see it.  He made a mental note to leave Tony's maids a nice tip.
"Tony," he whispered. "Talk to me. You don't have to tell me what was it about, just talk to me about...something."
Tony looked to Steve at Aria's mention of yet more interviews.  "...there's nothing more to say, is there? I pushed Steve away because I was insecure about all the... all the bullshit expectations of dominance that's shoved down Alphas' throats our whole lives, and because of me, Steve was put in danger.  And him getting... getting bonded by someone else, it opened my fucking eyes. I don't care if I'm some macho, swaggering jock. I'm Tony goddamn Stark and all I care about is that I'm with Steve and that he's alive and safe and happy. Don't really care if he's
" asked Tony.
"Let me know when my pizza gets here. You can just tell JARVIS; he'll call me up," said Tony, ignoring him.  Seeing their confused looks, he added, "JARVIS is my AI program.  He's sort of a virtual butler.  Say hi, JARVIS."
"Well, congratulations again," said Sean to Eric stiffly before edging away.  Clearly, he wanted nothing to do with Tony or Steve. The woman in the collar followed him placidly without looking back.
"Yeah.  Vodka, please?"
"Mr. Stark, there is someone--"
He hovered over the bed, over Steve's sweet sleeping form, for several seconds before tearing himself away.  He wanted to stand there, hovering, all night.  But that was insane.  Steve hardly needed someone to guard him.
"Hi," said Steve without looking up from his waffles.
than the neomodern, minimalist design of Tony's huge, impersonal mansion.  Tony had made the right choice, coming here... getting to touch Steve's skin, sit on his couch, peer into his life.
"Two of my own, and a stepson that's my Alpha's."
when they got together...
Tony still wished Steve had let him have that second bottle, though.
It was another thirty seconds before Steve's lungs were beginning to tug in chest in protest. He licked at the swell of Tony's knot one last time before pulling off with a gasp, eyes left watering a little.
someone."  He passed the program to Steve to pluck a drink from a passing waiter.  "Any workshops that look good to you?"
He felt guilty. Like he'd shown weakness. Like he should have been better. When, in reality, there was nothing he could really do.
He would
"I spoke to your friend earlier. Natasha?" Pepper offered. "She tried to explain...everything." She gestured with her hands, smiling awkwardly. How was she supposed to be normal in front of Captain America? She'd been bossing him about for two weeks and now suddenly...now his presence was almost intimidating. A man so significant in history was now pacing around in a trashed living room and looking to Pepper for answers. For reassurance. "...Tony isn't in a good place right now."
With that, DeSoto sat firmly on the floor.  He looked like he wasn't used to standing up for himself and seemed a bit surprised to find himself arguing with Captain America, of all people.
Steve reached for Tony's present and gave him a half serious look. "Is this safe to open in front of company?"
like a bite mark to you?" spat Tony, rising and glaring at DeSoto.  His dander was up, which only highlighted the mark.
them."  He reached up and rubbed the back of his neck in the same way Steve often saw Tony do when he was stressed out.
"Yeah, well, I'll just replace the core every once in a while.  No biggie."
"...I'm with SHIELD," he explained.  "We're supposed to have surveillance on the two of them at all times, until we can determine the level at which Rogers has been compromised.  Of course, I said to Fury, I don't plan on surveying the guy while he's with his mate. But I gotta be here, protect the perimeter, stay within hollering distance."  He shrugged a little, almost apologetically.
"Whu?  Yeah. Yeah, answer, answer," said Tony blearily, half asleep.
"Oh.  Right," said Tony.  "...you see what I mean, Steve?  It's too early to think straight."  He pulled the soldier toward him.  "...Maybe we should just go back to bed..." he murmured suggestively, pressing their bodies together, nipping at Steve's jaw.
Clint sat down and attempted to set Lila down, but she began crying again, and so he sat at the table with her in his lap.
Steve suddenly stood and emptied the orchids and water, not caring about the mess as he stuck his fingers inside. Nothing.
He let out a frustrated whine, his teeth digging into Steve's flesh.  His mind was spinning. Could he tear the suit off? No, probably not.  The suit wasn't designed to be torn apart. It wasn't designed to be pulled out without the gantry; he was bolted in and there was absolutely nothing to could do.  There was absolutely no practical way for him to mate Steve.
" he let out breathlessly, the question practically a single syllable.
Donner curled in on himself visibly, like an automatic defense mechanism. His eyes were fixed on the floor. "I promise, I'm not a badly behaved omega. I'm not like him. I'm good. I--"
His grip tightened and he pressed down into Steve, his metal fingers digging into Steve's wrists, his teeth fitting perfectly into the bonding-mark that he'd worn into Steve's neck.
"Clint recruited her,"  said Phil.
But he couldn't ignore the shaking of his hands.  Tony took great pride in having steady hands.
"Locked back on, coming in hot. Watch yourself!" called Rhodey.
Tony walked into the kitchen on the 29th at nine-thirty, for example, stretching in his robe.  He pulled open the fridge and pulled out a carton of orange juice, drinking it. Aria frowned.
A pause.  "I can handle it, Steve, I can handle anything.  I'll Avenge so hard, it'll make your head spin."  Tony drew back, examining Steve's hair with the sort of critical look he normally used for engines, making sure he'd gotten all the suds out.  He smiled.  Yes.  Perfect.
"Come on," he wheezed.  "Come on, we gotta-- gotta get you dressed, gotta-- get in there--"
Rhodey crouched beside him.  "How often do these happen?"
"We do! Hey, little bro!" Trey turned around to beckon one of brothers over. The one who'd gotten Steve shit-faced before. "Come on, let's go to the kitchen and make some drinks guys."
"...the new Mark VII's gonna make the Mark V look like the Mark II," he informed JARVIS, eyes darting over the circuit diagram.
"полковник Карпов!" he repeated, hopelessly.  He turned, staring at the omega, his vision blurry with tears.  "What did you do?" he demanded. Was he having a heart attack, was that it?  His heart and stomach were both twisting terribly, constricting, aching.. "
He walked in line with Mike's step which certainly didn't help him endear the Alpha to him any further. "Everyone's talking about you," he said, voice gruff. "Causing quite a stir."
He felt eyes on him; he looked up.
Tony nuzzled Steve's neck.  It was so weird to see him, the familiar Captain America from the posters... yet also to smell him, undeniably omega, not the dominant Alpha Tony had always assumed.  It was paradoxically strange, seeing Steve as his childhood hero, as opposed to his mate.
Admittedly, it was calming.  Steve enjoyed physical activity and using his body, and even if he wasn't sure he understood what a chakra was, he appreciated that Aria was more than a publicist.  She was a friend.  After the insanity of the conference over the weekend, Steve needed some peace and quiet, and yoga class turned out to be just the thing.  Working out was to Steve what building was to Tony.  Over the next few hours, both of them settled into a sort of peace.  Although Steve never quite forgot about the young omega auctionees, or Donner.  And Tony never forgot about the refugees in Wakanda who had had their lives ended by a rocket that bore his family name.
Tony's body was trembling a little, lip curled in a snarl.  Natasha was pressed against the wall, head ducked a little, eyes down, not looking directly at either Tony or Steve.  It was a strange tableau, the three of them, Tony lying on top of Steve, Steve wiggling beneath him, Natasha pressed against the wall, hunched.
, but obviously that was before I was on so it's not
"ROGERS!"
Sure, the house was huge, but Steve was someone who liked to be on the move. He hadn't been on one of his signature miles and miles long runs in far too long. He was itching to get back out there and sprint along the beech.
"...how... how long's a while?" asked Donner, taking a clipboard with a pile of papers on it for him to fill out.
"And promise you won't do anything reckless?"
"...I don't see George Bennett anywhere," he reported.
"It's the mornin- after pill, Steve," Aria filled in.
"P-Please.. you gotta... you g-gotta--" His Brooklyn accent was back full force now. Steve's chest was rising and falling a little heavily too as he struggled to catch his breath. It was too much. Tony was going to drive him crazy with all this teasing. Of course, he'd teased Steve before but...never down
"Is he... alive?"
"A team of... uh... well... remarkable people, Fury calls us.  Superheroes?  Kinda. I guess. I dunno."
"I don't even get why you people put so much pressure on yourselves at Christmas. Just do whatever you want. I swear, some of you act like if you don't get turkey then the world is over," Aria muttered as she got into the car. She was Jewish, Steve had found out after a few weeks of working together, and found all the Christmas extremities quite bemusing. "You see people the rest of the year. Why is the one day so much more important than the rest?"
Donner ducked his head down in answer. Rhodey felt like punching a wall.
and, admittedly, shocking. Steve hadn't expected that. The minute he'd felt the bite he'd expected Tony to be out.
She heaved a world-weary sigh and got up, walking across the room to gently close the door.  "Go back to bed, James.  I'm sure where ever he is, he's doing fine."
"You weren't flirting! You had your arm around her! And she looks like
to--"
"Hey." Steve put a hand over Tony's. "The same goes to you. These Alphas will be jerks, and they'll actually be talking to you, and not me. So the same goes to you. If you want out. Just say so, and we'll go. None of these asshats are worth either of us getting upset over." Then he leaned over to kiss Tony's forehead, closing his eyes for brief moment.
Wanda frowned.  "...loss?"
Tony looked up.  No, down.  The world was upside-down still.
Numbers Nine and Twelve, the ex-Miss Teen Illinois, stepped out of line; Twelve grabbed Seven's hand, and virtually yanked him off the stage with her.  Seven was clearly struggling not to cry; Number Twelve hauled him after her with a sort of grim determination. Number Nine, on his other side, took his other hand.
"You told me to double cycle.  Makes more power. Good advice."
"Apparently."
"He felt out of control, didn't he? Make him feel in control," Aria said, taking another long drag.
"Don.  Stop it," interrupted Mackenzie.  "Only person who's in trouble here is him.  And we're not going to talk about him, okay?  Important thing is that we're all safe, right?"
Donner snuck a look up again.  "
Steve gave his head a little shake to clear his thoughts.  "What's President Ellis's stance status stuff?" Steve asked curiously. "Do you know?"
burned
"You clearly have not seen me around my friends," slurred Tony, pushing Justin out of his mind.  "If your friends were all supermodels and shit, you'd slap about ten asses a day.  ...what's your deal with
hoary chestnut was dealt with.  Let Natasha go kill the Winter Soldier and
Weapons were still trained on Fury, but no one was moving.
"And is this your first?"
Karpovs plowed on with his story.  "I couldn't reach far enough.  There were too many targets.  They were mad about the man in the car even though I completed my objective.  He said something to me.  I didn't want to go back to the chair.  I tried to grab his hand but it was too far."
Tony let out a noise of protest, still feeling hurt.  Christmas Eve had become one of the few intimate things he and Pepper had together, something they did outside of their working relationship.  Every year they'd go up to Mt. Baldy and drink a cup of cocoa with a shot of peppermint schnapps. They'd been doing it for a decade. The only year they'd missed was the one when Tony was in Afghanistan.
"And why were you in his chair?" Pepper asked patiently.
"Hey, aren't you Iron Man?"
Trigger warnings apply to this chapter: Steve gets a rape kit done and Tony talks about some of his experiences in Afghanistan.
"Why would anyone find out?" Steve asked, keeping calm. "It's literally
Tony gave Steve's hand a tug.  "There.  No more JARVIS.  See?  ...he'll check back in tomorrow when the house reboots.  It's scheduled to update itself every morning at sunrise.  ...so, um, it's just us until then."  Tony gave Steve a small smile, feeling suddenly awkward.  Why?  He was proud of his smart house, proud of the amount of programming that-
Tiberius's face darkened.  "I got a bad arvicolinectomy."
He'd kept asking the same question over and over again. By the time they were at the cabin Bucky had asked him to go on a date about seven times and Steve wasn't almost crying for it. Especially when he realized the conversation was word for word from a day back in the forties. They'd had a fight, Bucky was trying to make it up to him...and it was in that moment that Steve realised Bucky wasn't really
When his thighs began to quiver he knew he was getting closer. Steve squirmed happily as Tony played with him and stroked him, whining a little too as he rocked up into his touch with eagerness.
As they drove away, they passed a police car going the opposite direction.  It was marked with the number 17.
"They induce us every two weeks," said Cupid.  "What is it, Monday? I guess our next heat would be on Friday?"
thought Tony.  He bet the Barnes brats were behind this whole Winter Soldier thing.  Of course HYDRA would recruit them; if they smelled at
"...I carried you," said Bucky, brow furrowing.  "You said you didn't want to mate in a cell, with cameras.  So we left the cell and now we're here. No video. Have I completed my objective?" he repeated, desperately wanting validation.
"Coulson."
"Yeah, well, don't flatter yourself, Jarv.  I'm paying myself the compliment, not you. After all,
strip," he said, handing it to Steve.  "It's a non-orientable structure with a single boundary and a single, continuous surface.  It's the topological quotient of a torus that has zero Gaussian curvature and a Euler characteristic of zero.  I mean, you can represent it in a three-dimensional Euclidean space as having an x value of cosine u multiplied by one plus half-v cosine half-u, and a y value of sine u multiplied by one plus half-v times cosine half-u, and z value of half-v times sine half-u, but obviously, plotting it parametrically or using cylindrical coordinates is like, way simpler, you just set the log of r sine half theta to equal z cosine--"
The food was amazing. Steve had seafood linguini with a terrifying amount of garlic bread on top. After dinner they shared a dessert (which Steve consumed most of) and then they headed to the nearest park for a walk. It was colder out tonight so Steve had pulled his coat collar up against the chill. Apparently it was summer, but someone had forgotten to inform the English weather.
"Are you an American?" called Pietro.
Ton startled awake with a yell and a swing at Steve (who easily avoided it thanks to his reflexes).  It took Tony a moment to remember they were in Alabama, which was dry and hot and dusty and somewhere he'd really rather leave.
With Steve's heightened smell, he had already noticed that the woman was not, in fact, a aeta straight away. He felt sick. The fact they had them working here in this school, after what they'd put the omegas through... it made Steve feel angry. So angry he felt it in his bones. His hands flexed by his sides.
"What are you doing?"
a four, on a good day.  His father and Obie had both easily been nines.
He was goddamn heavy. No one wanted to carry Steve again.
when they found out I was a breeder," said Twelve bitterly.
," said Tony, sharply, and Steve froze.  "Get a condom and put it on me," demanded Tony.  There was at least one benefit to his status; when Steve was in heat, he became easy to boss around.
"What if we find someone who's already being shipped off and just, y'know, track them?"
Sam smiled tightly.
Suddenly Pietro froze.  A hand was on his shoulder.
Tony waited until they were back in the car to begin complaining; Steve was holding on to the orchid, clearly more fascinated with it than Tony.
"Okay.  Fine. Sure.  Stay together," said Tony.  He gave Steve a sidelong look.  They'd have to radio in this pair later.
Tony bristled.  "Didn't you hear a damn word he said up there?"
"You think I'm not worried about his drinking? Even when I was his 'assistant' I would rip into him about it and serve him singles instead of doubles. Tony knows I don't like it. He can literally
Steve crawled back up to Tony's body and pressed a kiss to his cheek. He smiled, blue eyes sparkling. "Are you sufficiently awake now, hm?"

He let Tony's calming words wash over him and calm him marginally. Steve swallowed and trembled. He could feel Tony's hands on his waist, encouraging him to turn over, but he didn't want to-- he couldn't face him. Steve shoved his face against the pillow. "I can't-- I don't know how to do this. I don't know
Tony hoped Steve's charity involved giving away orchids because at a glance, there were already two dozen in the living room.
"You don't dream."
Steve's thumb traced over the engraving with a small smile playing at his lips. He already felt like less of a traitor to his ideals, knowing that was written inside. It was simple, but beautifully true. Steve set the box down carefully and then he leaned forward to kiss Tony softly. "Thank you," he murmured, nudging their noses together in an affectionate gesture.
three?"
Tony closed his eyes again, a slow smile of pleasure spreading across his face, arching his hips into Steve, letting his body be used and pressed into the counter over and over again.  Even now, even in the throes of passion (Steve's face was flushed and his muscles were popping), Steve was still conscious of his weight and size; his actions were deliberate, not too rough, and Tony felt a surge of affection that had nothing to do with sex.  He'd always been a selfish lover and expected the same from his partners.  Seeing Steve acting so consciously, so careful not to hurt him... it engendered in Tony a rare sense of trust in another human being.
"Have you seen me naked?"
"Dropping him off?" asked the beta, nodding to Steve.
"What if I
"So the end justifies the means?"
"Steve's fine," said Steve.
The man was silent.
himself.
That night they'd gotten ready together and they had a good routine going by now. Steve would make sure Tony made it out of the shower with no suds left on him, and once they were dry, Tony would tame his hair, which seemed determined to poof up for every formal event he ever tried to attend.  Tony knew his way around a bottle of hair gel, something Steve was eternally grateful for.
The way T'Challa looked at them made Steve think he was going to come out with a snappy remark any moment. He had a feeling that the prince wasn't feeling as friendly as his father.
"Oh my God, you're naked," said Pepper, holding up a folder to hide her eyes.
DeSoto's face lit up.
Laura nodded sombrely.
Steve was upset about other things and it was making him more upset to hear about this.
Pepper looked thoroughly alarmed.  Tony wasn't merely distracted, but dangerous.  And he wasn't even anywhere near Steve.
He couldn't really understand that now. It felt so... distant. Especially with Tony, his mate, ready and hard in front of him. Steve swallowed thickly at the sight. "I just wanna be good for you," he whispered with heavy lidded eyes. Steve licked his lips then leaned forward to nip at Tony's own, which were parted just perfectly.
"Next Tuesday I think it is. We'll book a hotel."
"No, I don't want-"
"You don't need to apologize," Pepper cut him off.  "Whatever makes you comfortable."
He rubbed his neck vigorously.  The collar, pressing into his raised hackles, felt like little needles.
"There wasn't a trigger. I was just sleeping."
"Come, soldier, let's go.  Time for your medicine," said Karpov, rising, and the soldier rose with him, eager for it, forgetting all about the name of Stark and the blond omega in their cargo hold.
Tony's skin was crawling.  Something didn't feel right.  But he couldn't put his finger on it.  Something was
Banksy?  From
If he wasn't dead, then he was having a real bad trip.  It was entirely possible that he would wake up from this  to Obadiah shaking him and yelling that he had to stop taking whatever pills he was offered because didn't he know he had a board meeting to go to?  And Pepper would be there, perfectly groomed, looking exasperated but offering him a small smile and a prepared speech, and his biggest problem would be feeling a little hungover and he would be better by lunch, which would probably be something too expensive and not very filling, and he would make his driver take his limo through a drive-through.
Besides, his mind was occupied with the phrase "work on our bond."  Tony doubted very much that a week would be long enough.  Hell, a lifetime might not be long enough.  Steve was a super-solider; the serum had created a freak of nature, an omega more powerful than most Alphas, rippling with muscles and strength.  And Tony was... well.  A national disaster.  A piping hot mess.  Back asswards, absolutely salmagundi.    Even with a regular omega, Tony wouldn't have had any clue what the hell he was doing.  But when you factored in Steve's status as the world's most powerful omega and also factored in that he'd been previously (no-
Steve got to the safe house around two in the morning, thoroughly exhausted from the drive. Bucky was mercifully asleep by then. The safe house was more of a cabin. There was a navy Land Rover outside of it, but that was all, and the house was surrounded by a sparse sprinkling of pine trees. There was no other houses or cars in sight. Bucky grunted, half awake, as Steve parked the car. He got out and walked around to the passenger seat. "I'll just be a moment Buck," he whispered and leaned down to brush his hair out of his eyes; he was still mostly asleep then. Unconsciousness had worn out some of his edges.  He looked tired, gaunt.  Like he had not been eating or sleeping well recently.
Ha!  If only Tony knew.  A childish part of Steve couldn’t want to see the look on his face when he found out who he really was.  He let out a long breath.
list!  What the hell was that? The two of them nearly got into a scuffle; everyone saw--"
...was Howard secretly like that with Jarvis?
Tony realized he was clinging to Steve, squeezing him protectively, his breath coming out in sharp little huffs.  The mere
"He looks homeless," Maria said worriedly.
But Steve was frozen and it was impossible to tell if he was in temporary shock at someone touching him or whether she'd discovered some sort of magical "off" switch.  Tony had seen videos on YouTube of people hypnotizing chickens and he wondered, bizarrely, if this was like that.
"Or a quartet, whatever."
"I mean- I did like it, sort of, but then not because it was a random stranger doing it. You make me feel good
Tony sighed and leaned his head on Steve's shoulder, closing his eyes.  God, it hurt.  Another Alpha.  But their bond was what it was.  He didn't know what the future held but he couldn't get rid of Steve anymore than he could cut off his left arm.  Steve was a part of him.

It was funny how even now, when he could drop dead at any moment, he desperately wanted to impress Steve.
it, why do you inject me with stuff every time I see you?" he demanded angrily.
do something else!"
Tony groaned and stretched, then wrapped his arms around Steve.  "Oh.... maaaay... guh," he slurred happily, nipping Steve's neck.
"I wasn't followed here. I would notice," Steve said, although Fury didn't look convinced. He looked back to the window, his eyes narrowing. There was a glint of... something outside.
"Calls 'em like I sees 'em," she said with an unapologetic shrug.
Tony ruffled through the rest of the documents in silence, drinking, brooding, trying not to think about that cold, winding, narrow road where his parents had met their sudden end, or how Jarvis had wept inconsolably at the funeral.  He kept one ear out for Steve, hoping he'd come home, but the hours slid by and his omega were nowhere to be found.
"Beach."  Tony sounded a lot more confident now, and he was going faster.
"Please Tony," Steve begged. "Make me yours again."
"Please, sir, don't treat me like an omega."
"Tomorrow's my birthday," he said, grinning at Steve.  "...I was thinking we could go to the Mile High Club... you know what that is?  I'll show you on the plane. Didja pack my stuff, too?" Tony was determined to have a good time, especially since he knew in about a month, the shit was going to hit the fan with 84.   When they came back, they were hosting a gala in New York to finally sell off all the orchids; the proceeds would come pouring in just before the crack-down.  The lawyers were putting together the last bits and pieces. Tony was more anxious about it than he'd admit; the idea of sixteen hundred Donners and Tys was horrifying to him.
"Don't let Ryan hear that," said Banksy, giving his arm a friendly slap  "Steve-- can I call you Steve-- I do know you've busy with a lot of other projects right now... you're doing some big work for omega civil rights?" he prompted.
Her shoulders slumped and the light faded.  "I can't. It's too strong. It's not regular glass, it's something else."
Steve and Tony didn't let go of each other's hands.  When their lift stopped at their floor it took them more than a few seconds to actually step out of it.
"Could we use the connection to try and locate Barnes?" Fury asked, stepping forward, his eyes fixed on the scientist. "Is there a way to strengthen it, somehow?"
"Oh... oh, no; no no no, DeSoto.  No, of course not, I'm not going to do that, I... I love Steve.  I love him with all my heart, more than I can even tell you. I'd never get rid of him.  C'mon, you'd have to be a moron to get rid of Steve. No, I just--" Tony had lost the authoritative voice from earlier.  He realized, too late, that he was now reasoning with DeSoto, like he was a person. Which he was. "--just want to know what happened to Ashtray and Trickshot."
"Shall I tell Captain Rogers we're in a trio, then?"
"Sorry, excuse me.  That's likely my mechanic," said Malick to Pierce.
Next to him was a magazine.  Had he been reading it?
"I'm not scared of--" began Tony.
"You see? His programming is failing," said the man in the uniform.  "...we're probably going to dismiss Karpov and just keep the asset for breeding purposes.  He's the closest approximation we have to an enhanced soldier at present, but we've known for years that Project Eve and Project Guiding Star were flops."
Tony ran his hand down Steve's neck and back again.  "Mine," he stated, softly.
Tony's top lip still had the stitches in. It looked a little sore. So Steve pressed a kiss to his bottom lip gently. "I love you."
"It didn't matter how strong I am. He was always going to one-up me in that thing.  At least now I know not to fight a weaponized robot suit in my jeans," he joked gently and then exhaled.  "I'm just...I'm glad you're okay," Steve murmured. "I was so scared."
And he did.
"I'm just not sure Tony is good for him," Aria sighed, looking bored as she tapped away on her phone. "And wonderful. Photos of them making out are already on Twitter." There was plenty of comments already, and dozens of retweets which would soon become hundreds, and then thousands. Aria held up her phone for Pepper and Beth to see. "I guess least it's not a tape--" she added with a hint of mischievousness.
Steve moved to sit down, grabbing the Nutella and smearing his pancakes in it. He couldn't exactly get fat so he made the most of it. "It's supposed to be a surprise," he sighed. "But fine.  I'm singing
Pepper stared at him.  "...what?"
But that was ancient history, now.
The omega had instructed him to follow, so he did.
Pepper crouched on the floor by Tony, who had balled himself up against the side of one of the couches and was breathing heavily.  Her hands were out and open in submission. "Tony... Tony, it's me... you're home. Tony."
some dark screwed-up part of his mind wanted it too. He couldn't tell Bucky to step back. His lips parted but his words wouldn't leave him. He ran a shaky hand over his face and shivered, cringing as a tremble shuddered up his spine. "Fuck," he whispered again.  "Bucky. I don't know-" he couldn't finish his sentence, his words stuck in his throat.  "You don't know what you're doing," he finally managed to get out. "Buck. Stop and think.  Urgh."  Steve grunted and curled in on himself as a spasm when through his middle.
...the fact that Bucky was a ninety-year-old man didn't mean Tony didn't need a new suit of armor.  Just in case.
"I was kind of hoping for something that wasn't metal," Steve said. He didn't like metal on his neck, surprisingly enough. It kind of brought back bad memories...memories of a metal arm pressed against his neck in a small cage whilst Steve screamed at Bucky not to hurt him. "It's...cold," he provided as an explanation.
"The guy from Monaco who tried to kill me last week.  He's in cahoots with Hammer."
The doctor shrugged. "When a body is trying to reject the bond bite it becomes more agitated and red; it heals slower and so infection is more likely.  No serum in the world can change that."
"Does a man love his creator?" replied JARVIS philosophically.
Pepper cocked an eyebrow, fixing Tony with a questioning look.
"Stevie," he said suddenly.  He wasn't even aware the name had fallen from his lips until he'd heard it himself.  The moment he'd said it, though, he genuinely wanted to cry.  He hadn't felt anything this strongly in... ever, actually.  Not that he could remember.
"Mm'kay."  Tony yawned, stretching his hackles.
HYDRA.  Ha.
"It's fine," said the man in the suit with a small smile.  "We have use for him. ...a very nice little slogan, Captain.  Less nauseatingly patriotic than is typical of you," he said, nodding to the wall.  "Unfortunately, not especially legally binding." He laughed a little, and turned to Bucky.  "Soldier. We need blood samples. Would you be so kind?"
They led him into a large, warehouse-like area.  The cube was in the center.
Tony closed his eyes, kissing Steve's thumb pad as it slid back and forth over his bottom lip.
"Not much-- I'm fine--"  Tony's eyes were squeezed shut and he was wheezing softly.
"I got it," he said quietly.  "Either this is real, and I'm already dead... or it's
Steve stared down at Cooper and his eyes went wide. He could see the similarity almost immediately. The boy had Clint's exact eyes. Natasha was grinning at him, waiting for a response.
"It'll be good to see a few different people and see who works out for you best," Brazinski said encouragingly.
put him there. We have to do something to get him out. Please, Rhodey. We'll owe you one. A huge one."
"Shall we?" Phil asked and Steve nodded. He shared a reassuring glance and nod with Pepper too before he slipped out of the door and lead Phil to his hotel room.
Also it was painted red, white, and blue.
Steve cocked his head at Tony when he didn't say anything immediately. "Are you...okay?"
"You can't buy people, you goddam--"
"As a matter of fact, he is," said Tony.  He let go of Steve's hand, but only to wrap his arm around Steve's waist and drag him closer to him.  "Who better to benefit from an Expo that showcases the wonders of the future than Captain America, right?  And I think I speak for every progressive, forward-thinking American when I say that I wholeheartedly support his stance on advancing omega rights.  It's that kind of dynamic, modern thinking that helps us move forward as a society, and helps our best and brightest, regardless of status, really shine in the tech market."
Besides all that, he drank.  Pepper didn't abide drinking.
He wasn't given a choice; Tiberius Stone, Boswell Mackabee, Thomas Banksy, Brent Walker, and Jeffrey Walker entered with a lot of loud cheers and congratulations.
Everyone was standing and shaking hands.  When Steve had finished and slid his papers back over to Hawley, Tony rose with him, keeping a hand on his shoulder as Hawley reached over to shake his hand, then Fury, then a guy from the Department of Defense... then Malick was sticking his hand out, and there was another veiled threat there:
"...'86?"
"You sure?" asked Fury.  He could sniff out a lie a mile away.
She reached out and slapped him.  "You hypocrite! Steve's been nothing but loyal, and you... you flirt with anything that moves!  In the last twenty years you've had, what, fifteen different girlfriends--"
"He's got you," said Brent.  "How much're you worth, Stark, ten billion or something?"
Tony pulled the crystal plug from the decanter and turned up the bottle, drinking directly from it.
"Tony, it's not working!"
Tony had the presence of mind not to lay down on Steve, but he couldn't bear to let him go.  He remained clutching Steve to him, oblivious to nurse's pleas that he needed to let go.
Rhodey shook Chantelle's hand while Donner hovered by the door, eyes downcast respectfully.
All he could do now was make sure the omega got to be somewhere safe, that he was taken care of.  For once in his life Tony wasn't feeling selfish, not at all; the idea of Steve being injured was too intense.
"Come on, you're always thinking
they could deal with all the other HYDRA lowlifes... the ones that didn't make Steve go all weird and crazy.
"Oh dear Lord," he whispered, hands moving to fist in his hair.
"I didn't know I had scent glands in my neck at all."
He didn't understand what bonding would feel like to an omega who was forced.  Alphas couldn't really be forced, and besides, they could distance and even sever bonds.  But for omegas... what was it like to be bonded and to feel devotion to someone you didn't even know or like?  Baffling.
Steve leaned back down but then winced as the sheets brushed against his sore neck. He turned around on his front, arms folded under the pillows. He turned his head on its side to look at Tony, his hair tufting up a little at the top. He smiled a little in return, looking sleepy.
Tony's hackles spiked.  "I'm not
He had checked in on Karpov, who was bunked on level A-2, but Karpov had had half of a bottle of vodka and was barely conscious, so the soldier had decided to carry on with his investigation of the omega.  This was not technically disobeying orders since Karpov hadn't told him he had to stop or that there was any sort of time limit on talking to the omega.
Tony hopped off the counter. "Can I come in the shower with you?" he asked, voice small, almost child-like.
When the song ended, Tony gave Steve's hand a gentle tug.  "Let's get some overly-expensive food in you, Stevie. Ever tried foie gras?  ...Pepper wouldn't allow it, said it was cruel or something. God, she can get preachy."  Tony's tone was affectionate.  "Fortunately I had last say on the food and I felt like it was a good compliment to the monkfish so... ta-da!"
“Makes perfect sense in the future,” Tony replied with airs, making Steve roll his eyes. He'd been using that excuse to get away with things for days. Steve strangely rolled with it. It unnerved Tony at first but it was how Steve was. He rolled with whatever was given him and Tony had fun with it. Tony asked, “So when are the Commandos moving out?”
Whoever it was, by his gait, he was either injured or…burdened by a heavy load.
Steve embraced him tightly and said, “Yes, you can.”
Steve knew he should have felt ashamed by his dirty thoughts but he actually felt bizarrely guilty.
How was it possible for a human being to have eyes such a piercing blue??
“Come again?” Tony inquired to the empty patch of air.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Apple sauce,” Peter said with a big yawn.
The Soldier did not reply. It was not a part of the mission. He kept his gaze level with his target’s and said, “Tell me your name.”
with you should be determent enough to keep you from drinking again…even if I was gone.”
Tony studied Steve. He truly did appear worried. What did he think would happen? It wasn’t like it was…
Wade threaded his fingers through Peter’s and gripped him more securely. He retorted, “Baby boy, I won you over with lame-ass jokes, or did you already forget my amazing pickup lines?” He turned to Steve and said, “Sir, it would be an honor to hear your one-liners.”
. He’s cool.”
“What will it take for you to change your opinion about the man? Peter cares deeply for him. He
“And you did the jitter bug. It’s a match made in heaven,” Tony teased Bucky, bumping him lightly with his elbow. Bucky glanced incredulously at Tony then shot Steve a look from across the counter and his gaze seemed to ask, “You’re really dating this?”
Howard’s fingers spasmed on the clipboard he was holding and he fully faced Steve, giving him all of his attention. He gasped, “It can be used as an element in a catalyst converter too. Are you telling me that robot has a catalyst converter in it?? What else is it made of??”
, me too. Shall we venture to more courteous accommodations?”
His tapping grew faster.
to him.
“I am tracing your call right now, you cheat.”
Or was he already gone? What if Tony wasn’t in the era because he was still in the past?
“We did not kill Stark, Captain. He’s more valuable to us alive than dead, no matter how annoying he gets,” Coulson assured him.
They separated awkwardly, untangling their limbs and reluctantly pulling away from each other. Once they were both standing, Tony grasped Steve’s hand. They exchanged grins and then walked back into the mansion together, connected by their clasped hands and so much more.
There is was, the topic of love. It was out in the open and Steve did not feel brave enough to broach any further on it.
Howard rounded his table and met her halfway. They hugged and then both kissed the other’s cheek. When they pulled back, she smiled warmly at him and whispered, “You’re not looking too good there yourself, Stark…”
“I’m grabbing life by the balls!” Tony explained one night to Steve.
“Osborn! Get your hands in the air!” Fury yelled as SHIELD agents began to surround the Goblin with weapons raised. Fury continued, “There’s no way out of this so come quietly!”
“It feels like it is too impossible, doesn’t it?” Tony continued, “After all our trials, is it really this easy?”
“I made him take a nap,” Bucky explained. “He was up all night with you.”
Tony was a crass man but he still flushed upon the invasive question.
“America and her Allies.”
Wade drew one of his kantanas and the sonic gun from his belt and pointed both at Eddie. He warned, “Not any closer, Dr. Jekyll.”
“They won’t bother us if we don’t get caught,” Tony lightly sang.
“Hey, jerk,” Tony called out as he walked over. “Your arm’s ready to go.”
“Really?” Steve gazed up at the sky and wondered if someone in Brooklyn right now was looking at the same thing.
“I found that on the roof late last night. I checked it to see if it could give me any clue as to where you went. I suggest you check it
Tony snapped the face shield back down and turned back to the Shelby Cobra just as the said intruder landed on the ruined vehicle. The man lost his footing on the crumpled car and fell back on to his back very similarly to how Tony had landed.
What the hell?
Because of his drowsiness, it took him a few minutes to remember the last time he was awake was when he was being pulled back into Venom’s dark embrace.
Peter flushed and awkwardly murmured, “Ah, Aunt May this – this is Wade…my, hem,  boyfriend.”
Wade blinked open his eyes to find Peter’s hazel eyes staring into his. His eyes were half lidded and filled with such emotion that Wade nearly choked. How long had Peter been looking at him like that?
Tony pulled up another screen and pulled up Coulson’s files. He compared it to the others he’d uncovered and then sighed in relief, “No…No, he’s one of the good guys.”
Eddie bit down on his lip with a conflicted expression and then said, “I just…I just wanted to apologize for everything on behalf of me and…and Venom.”
Tony ran his hand down Steve’s chest and then whispered, “I’ll have you know, after you fell asleep last night I placed an order online and paid extraordinarily large fees and other sums of money to have certain items delivered overnight before you woke.”
"You don't do that anymore," Steve argued. "You are in a stable relationship and, for the most part, have given up on drinking..."
Not long after he revealed he was Iron Man to the media, Tony had stumbled upon one of his dad’s old notebooks and, in it, Howard had noted the Commandos finding the base. He’d written there was a lab there that contained scientific marvels but the next page that went onto describe those marvels had been torn out of his journal. Tony’s curiosity was piqued and the chance to use Sneaky was just too good to pass up.
“Do you have enough charge to get there?” Tony asked Jarvis.
Like most of his generation, Steve hated using his fingertip so Tony got him a stylus pen for the touchscreen. Tony teased him about it relentlessly but Steve would not forgo it. Tony could not help but smile whenever he saw Steve tapping away on his tablet with the stylus.
Steve leaned in and Tony did too.
Steve paused before answering because he wasn’t really sure how to explain everything to his teammate. He didn’t even know how to define what he shared with Tony…
He’d never experienced it before, but he’d read up about it. That darkness had felt empty and  eternal and it only appeared if one’s soulmate was awake or…
His heart jumped at the chance to go flying with the Iron Man suit. He’d only done it once before in the middle of a battle and it had been exhilarating.
“Yup, good ol’ Sneaky, just sneaking around, looking for Skelator’s sneaky red faced cousin,” Sneaky replied, rocking on its heels.
Peter dropped again and when he caught himself he looked down. He was probably halfway down the tower.
Tony closed his eyes and he could imagine Steve by his side again.
Steve blinked in surprise then said, "...But then I won't be able to see you."
“I…I won’t sleep with him,” Steve stated. “We’ll just stay friends. Don’t worry, Buck. Tony probably doesn’t swing that way anyway…”
Steve draped his arm over Peter and sighed, “Me too…”
“Can you guess which ones?” Tony asked.
“The aliens are in the pipes,” Solo murmured to him one day his mind had grown too fragile. He was rocking back and forth, clutching his arms gasping, “If you are careful enough, they’ll enter your body though the water and take over your mind.
“He is?!” Peter gasped excitedly, his shy nature toward Bucky totally evaporated and he looked to Steve with unabashed joy. Peter grabbed Steve’s dog-tags through his shirt and bounced in his arms. “When he coming home??”
Wade lightly tapped the front door with his back without looking at it and it closed with a gentle click.
“…What happened? Something with Tony? Is there anything I can do?” Sam gasped, stepping closer to Steve.
A dark promise but it was one that made him smile. He pressed his forehead to hers and promised, “I won’t leave your side until my dying breath.”
“After hearing so much about how much better it is than Vaseline, I just assumed you had a stockpile of it,” Steve teased, finding the entire situation hilarious. Tony was still frowning and Steve wrapped his arms around his fiancé and tried to break that frown by suggesting, “Speaking of…do you have any Vaseline at least?”
Schmidt just smiled his creepy fleshless smile and looked at the shot up doorway he’d been standing at when Tony first came in. The Red Skull stated, “I think it is you who will lose in the end.”
Steve was the first in the room and Peter sat up to embrace his stepfather. Steve murmured, “Welcome back, Pete.”
Tony nodded and blasted out of the lab.
“Everyone stay here,” Tony said. “Jarvis will keep you informed.”
The AI did as he asked, and a video file opened on the screen, replaying the scene. He paused after Steven said his name and rewound it and played it again.
Steve squeezed his arm one more time then slipped from his side and went over to Peter. They played a bit before Steve began to tell Peter about his mission.
Natasha sat on the end of the counter sipping on some tea and reading the newspaper. She merely glanced up at them before returning to her article.
“But how does this precognition come about from spider gamma-radiated DNA?” Steve questioned. Hydra had infused Peter with the spider gamma-radiated DNA when he was still a fetus in his mother’s womb. They wanted to create a super-soldier stronger than Captain America and if Peter truly had precognition along with his healing ability and strength then they had succeeded.
‘Same time, same place?’ Peter asked.
“…Steve, there’s no backing out now. I’m marked and everything,” Tony teased, touching the spot on his neck where Steve’s hickey was already beginning to form. Tony was grinning at him like this was all a big joke and whatever hurt was there was successfully masked by his humor. He clearly was uncomfortable but was staying strong for Steve and Steve instantly felt like even more of an ass.
“My husband? Yup,” Tony replied.
Peter yawned again and watched Steve with barely open eyes as he pulled out a tiny spoon. He opened the apple sauce, scooped out some and held out the full spoon to his son.
Tony stated, “We need to speak to Mary Parker.”
“My notes,” Howard replied. “I’m still working on trying to find you a new element.”
Mary’s mouth twitched, almost giving in to a smile.
If Richard was not my birthfather I would be dead right now, you hear me?
“Forget about every single thing they said. None of it was true. They only said those things to get a rise out of you!”
Flushing to himself, he murmured, “It wasn’t the same without you, you know? It was horrible…”
Thor sat up sharply, gasping for breath. He clapped Steve’s shoulder and gasped, “Thank you, my friend. The beast constructed an inhibitor which countered my lightening powers and turned them against me! How fairs the Man of Iron?”
She went up to James and picked up the gun he was still holding. She put her hand over his and made him pull the trigger, shooting the chair. Bullets peppered it and smoke began to rise from its new holes.
The doctor mumbled something a scurried away. Coulson rubbed the back of neck to relieve some of the tension that had gathered there but it was to no avail. He sighed heavily and walked out of the empty room the doctor had pulled him into.
He didn't know anymore.
"Steve?  Steve, are you alright?"  He waved a hand in front of Steve's eyes.  They were unseeing.
"  He scoffed.  "Is stupid weakness.  Makes Alphas weaker."
"You know you're the fourth person to ever touch it?" said Tony, glancing down as Steve's fingers traced the arc reactor.
Steve let out a noise of frustration.  "No.
"I think so," Steve said. "...but he'll bet money.  And he'll win.  Tony's good at stuff like that. He's smart."
"You gonna go work now?" Steve asked gently, like he already knew the answer.
Steve smiled faintly as metal digits brushed through his hair. It felt strange but he appreciated the sentiment behind the gesture. Dazedly, he reached up to trace his fingertips over the face plate, his thumb brushing over a metal cheek. He knew his Alpha was behind there. He could feel him. That was what a bond was. Reassurance. Trust. Security.
"Jarvis was married, too."
!"  The last word was more growl than anything; Tony strained, burying himself up to the base, his whole body spasming.  His and Steve's chests were pressed together and he could feel Steve's partial erection on his stomach but found it strangely erotic even though he'd never really been one for men.  Steve's scent was like its own sexual experience all by itself and Tony found his face buried against Steve's neck, huffing him, licking his skin, lost for a few seconds in the feral pleasure of mating.
Pepper snorted into her drink, unable to keep from laughing at how disastrously this conversation was going.
"He's dead already." Steve murmured as they pulled up outside the office. He looked up and gave Tony a grave look. "I can feel it in my bones. I just don't think we'll find him in one piece, Tony."
"Yeah.  He was really cool."
"Two hundred and nine, sir."
day's notice.  Probably because they knew if they had more, Tony would be able to wear Steve down, guilt him out of the mission, maybe, find some excuse not to do it.
"I mean, are you a natural--" he began.
Hello darlings.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!  This is the LAST chapter of OR: Part 4.  We will announce new names for the first 4 parts on Thursday, the 27th.  Omega Rising: Avengers will begin in 2019.  Stay tuned, and thank you, as always, for your support!  We love you!  - Tony
"Sounds good," Steve said even though it didn't sound
"This--" Steve took a final turn. "--is it." He was grinning, mostly at Tony's reaction. "You'll get it once we're in there. Oh, and be nice." He leaned down and kissed him square on the lips before he moved to get out of the car.
Suddenly, Steve was no longer so serious. "Can I have more waffles? And syrup? Actually, I'll take syrup."
Rhodey walked over, his steps heavy, arms out.
"How you doing, how it's shaking, buddy?" asked Justin, grin widening.  "You’re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car.  Just met your new boy, he's great... oh, and you know, this is Miss Everhart. I call her Christine, she's from
Natasha stood in the long, empty hallway, the red alarm lights still flashing.  She was staring at them with a mixture of irritation and... something else.
not double-bonded," said Laura, smiling down at him.
" he repeated a few more times, just for good measure.
Tony felt a twinge of anger.  How come
"Aw, hell," said Sam, already pulling out his phone.
This was yet another new emotion: sympathy.
A group in the middle were bickering over the lunch someone bought whilst a male omega sat off to the side drinking a milkshake with a shit-eating grin. Then he saw Steve and got up in an instant. "Oh my God! You're here! Steve's here!"
...could be funny.  And here's one about-- is that seriously about how to 'properly' have sex? Oh my God. That's hilarious. We should go to that one. I bet they just want you to do missionary all the time."
"Those are almost as bad as Gideon, Jr.," said Tony.  "Just give the kid a regular name if he's an omega, instead of something stupid."
Aria had said nothing; she watched Tony's forced calm with a hint of a frown gracing her features.  Pepper mouthed
Wanda's brow furrowed and she made the same crushing motion with her hands, as if crumpling up a ball of paper.  Her muscles quivered with effort; between her hands, sparks of red electricity crackled.
, which featured the titular Boswell Mackabee interviewing politicians and singers and athletes and also usually included a couple of entertaining skits.  Its lighthearted title didn't do it justice. Boswell Mackabee liked interviewing politicians and he did so ruthlessly. When the show had first aired, he'd been young, wearing brown suits and a thick pair of glasses.  Boswell Mackabee was now in his seventies and his hair was grey, but he still had the heavy glasses and was as sharp as ever.
It could happen in the future…a world where Tony was from.
“I have to die,” Steve stated, the words coming much easier to him than anything else he’d exchanged with Tony.
What was Peter doing with Deadpool??
He went early to the meeting spot for his date and was surprised to find Wade already waiting and decked out in his Deadpool regalia. He was sitting on the ledge of the twenty story building, with his feet dangling over the edge.
Horror and guilt flooded his body.
“I just moved in. I haven’t quite settled yet.”
July 4
“Good, I need you to stand at least. Can you do that?”
“You overthink things a lot,” Peter grumbled. “And you did so with Wade but times ten.”
. Stay with me, beloved. Please,
With a combined yell from both Wade and Peter, they both gave their all in one final jerk. They fell back together, wrapped in each other’s arms.
(See the end of the chapter for
It quickly felt stuffy beneath the sheets and their harsh, frenzied gasps echoed heavily in their ears.
Steve raised his head to deliver a level look at his boyfriend. He dryly asked, “Is your head not screwed on right? Do I need to call psyche?”
Peter kept screaming his name as if Steve had the strength to defeat this shadow monster. Steve was his father, he was Captain America the Super Soldier. Steve was undefeatable in Peter’s mind and he expected Steve to save him.
The first time had been obvious. They were falling in love with each other, and both of them would’ve done anything to save the other, including changing the future.
,” Tony gasped his name like it was a plea. “They’re d-dead.” He gulped for air and couldn’t speak no more but he didn’t have to. Steve picked Tony up and held him close. Tony buried his face into Steve’s chest and tightly held Steve back. Steve lightly patted Tony’s hair and whispered, “I’m here. I’m here for you. I’m here, Tony.”
“It’s nice to see you,” Steve said. “Are you done with whatever you were working on in the workshop?”
Jarvis inclined its head and murmured, “Yes.”
Peter bit down on his lip and then murmured, “Sure…” His lip slipped free from the grip of his teeth and he smiled into his pillow. He imagined Wade without his mask and also smiling. He couldn’t wait to see that and to kiss him without his mask.
And twenty minutes was a very short time for three opposing forces to work around each other.
Tony leaned forward and finally replied, “What’s bothering me right now is all this talking. I want your lips on me right now, Cap.”
“See, Clint,” she called out to semi-sealed door. “This is a vast improvement from ‘Hail, Hydra.’”
Tony released a deep sigh and nearly face-planted into the pancakes. Okay, he can do that too. He'd rather pretend the kiss never happened than lose his friendship with Steve.
“But he’s going to leave you so you should just stay with me,” Bucky stated. “Why even consider going back?”
"I'll take care of the rest," Tony said, once Bucky filled the first plate. Bucky nodded and he and Natasha slipped away, leaving Steve and Tony alone. Tony picked off the last of the hot dogs and stated, “You had that look again.”
Steve let out a strangle squeak in protest and Bucky’s fingers dug into his jaw.
They were taken to a conference room since the interrogation room was too small for the half a dozen lawyers that came with Tony. Despite Tony’s objections, he could not go with them and promised to wait outside.
Steve smiled at his best friend and his not very cryptic way of asking how Steve felt about Tony.  Steve replied, “Far from it.”
Natasha asked to help going through the files and Tony gave her access and she started to read. She learned how to work it quickly and was adding to their lists at a fast rate.
“Actually, she found us,” Jarvis retorted dryly and a holo-screen opened above Tony’s workstation. The image displayed Mary standing on the ground floor. She was staring directly into the camera. Somehow she could see one of Jarvis’s near invisible cameras and was staring directly into its line of sight.
He allowed unconsciousness to take him and to let his body recharge.
“Very well,” Jarvis stated and fell silent.
Peter moaned into his mouth approvingly, making Wade choke on his own breath.
Since the Winter Soldier had survived, he assumed that maybe a tiny portion of the organization survived. He was expecting maybe a few dozen people…
The people in the living room left the screen, getting ready to fight the Sinister Six.
Peter grumbled under the praise but flushed happily all the same with Wade’s compliment.
“Are you Captain America!?” Her boy gasped. His eyes twinkled with excitement and reminded Steve of Peter.
Peter used a rolling motion to stand himself up with a slight jump and lightly landed on his toes.
More tranquilizers were shot into him and Steve collapsed. He fell facing Tony and he squeezed his eyes closed so he would not have to look at the unmoving figure.
Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair and whispered, “I would gladly get stabbed by a hundred crazy women if it meant the end result was
Steve leaned back into the cushioned, leather seat and murmured, “We’re just really good friends…” Steve paused then said, “He’s my best friend…I know it sounds ridiculous, we’ve only known each other a few weeks but…I haven’t felt this closeness since-since Bucky.”
Sam crossed his arms over his chest and chuckled, “Good luck with that.”
brother,” Peter hissed as he struggled to break free of the robot’s grip.
“Well, when you say it that way it certainly sounds bleak…” Tony murmured.
So this was what falling in love felt like…
Natasha landed the quinjet a hundred feet away and Steve led the Norse God to it but his thoughts were no longer on the mission but on the iron sentinel watching over the proceedings from a mile away in the sky.
Tony looked at his dad’s crotch in disgust. Wait, he really was there right now.
Tony bit down on his lip knowing his answer would parallel hers.
Sneaky froze and then dropped his gaze. With a lower voice, it asked, “Is it Howard Stark?”
Tony made a face, wishing Peter had chosen to skip work. How much longer was Peter going to go there? The whole point of the internship was as a cover for him to see Tony without raising any questions. He could start working in the real labs now and no one would question it. He’d talk to Peter about it later…and maybe he’d find a way to bring up Deadpool, but, for now he had time on his hands and a new husband waiting for him at home.
Shit. Bucky must think he was his new handler.
“Yes!” Pepper said, nudging Tony. “Also, thank you for telling me about Wade. We’ll narrow down the people so Peter and Wade won’t have to hide their relationship.”
“It’s a trilogy, babe, don’t worry we are definitely going to have to have a movie marathon with that one!”
“James,” she repeated and hearing her say it solidified it in his mind. There was no questioning it or the memory. This was his name. It did not feel odd like Stepan had.
“You're dead,” Tony bit out harshly.
Marcel provided his own therapist to testify about Tyler’s mania. She stated that her symptoms had nothing to do with trauma but from an ongoing mental disease. The doctor had interviewed, Tyler prior to trial, and was assuming she suffered schizophrenia but could not say so definitely without further sessions.
James shoved her into an alcove when a spray of bullets rained down the hall and she couldn’t hold back her chuckle.
He and Jarvis exchanged nods and Howard silently opened the door to the bedroom. Maria was awake and still reading the newspaper he’d left her with. Tony was deeply asleep and curled into her side with one arm thrown over her thigh.
“We should go.”
Steve smothered a chuckle upon Tony’s question and said, “No, it wasn’t.”
Peter wound an arm around Wade’s head with a fond smile and whispered, “We did.”
Steve did the only thing he was able. He promised him, “I’m here.”
“Want to see?”
“Or…” Steve whispered, his voice breathless at his daring. He trailed his hands lower and he ran his fingertips up the sides of his sensitive cock and gasped, “But I think I am dirtiest here. I haven’t touched myself here since you left.”
Mr. Stark who he has been in a relationship with for the last two years! The Captain is being wrongly charged by—.”
Steve laid back down and stared at the ceiling. His clothing and the sheets were sticking uncomfortably to him and his melancholy seemed to weigh down on his chest.
“By all means, use that restless energy on me, Cap,” Tony flirted. Steve grinned and slid closer to him. Hook, line, and sinker. Tony Jr. was beginning to stir beneath the sheets. Steve bent down and lightly kissed Tony, his lips gently caressing Tony’s lips in the way that made Tony crazy.
They had already discussed the next test for them to be holding the experiment close to their body to see if it would react any different with being so much closer to the person it was meant to be protecting. How would it react differently? Would it react faster? Would it push the danger farther away?
When his dinner hour came around, Tony hadn’t noticed because Jarvis wasn’t there to notify him. It was Panzer himself who knocked Tony off his bench and ordered him out of there. He was certainly more direct and forceful than J. Tony laughed as he got off the ground and happily smiled at Panzer as he left the garage.
“Steve?” Ben questioned.
He tried to look at the chart while holding the babe and Steve could tell he was having trouble turning the pages so he offered, “I can hold him.”
Steve smiled though it appeared strained and he grasped Tony’s hands. He assured him, “Everything is fine! I was just wondering about Peter’s bio-shield? I don’t know much about it and I was wondering if he told you anything?”
“…Let Jarvis finish the hacking and confirm,” Bruce whispered gently. “Steve wouldn’t want you to see that.”
! And I’m going to be a superhero one day too! When I get famous from that everyone would know my name anyways!”
Steve’s heart went out to him but was suddenly inspired.
“Right now, I just wanted to say, without a doubt, you completed me. I never before felt an ease like I did when I was with you, Steve,” Tony whispered.
Steve was inside the house, standing in front of a closet door. Behind the closed door, he could hear sniffling.
…Or that a new inscription had appeared on its chest where MK 15 once was.
“They are so much more than that!! Try it!” Wade gasped.
bad.”
Tony glanced at the image and then murmured, “A way to escape…much more dangerous than the reactor, but, I promise, I’ll be careful. I’ll always come back to you, Steve.” He reaches across the counter and grasped his hand. He promised, “I am here for you as you are here for me.”
He couldn’t ask for anymore for his birthday to make it any better.
Steve helped Tony up and took off his bomber to make a makeshift pillow for him to lean against in addition to Steve’s body. Steve seemed to unconsciously rub at Tony’s arms which Tony took comfort in. The super soldier asked Gabe, “Have you seen anything like this?”
She had to act fast. This man was her senior and more experienced. Surprise was her greatest asset at this moment.
Pepper rolled her eyes and rose to her feet. She walked over to them and stated to Peter, “I think it is great that you are not letting this incidence tie you down. You should keep trying to live your life, in whatever ways you can.”
It took him a moment to note the tender pain in his chest and then another moment to comprehend that meant the surgery was done.
The lock clicked as the door opened and Steve shot to his feet.
Bucky’s eyes suddenly narrowed and his pupils became tiny pinpricks. Steve did not have a chance to formulate the danger before Bucky clenched his hovering fist and punched Steve. Steve fell back and Bucky pounced on him. He screamed bloody murder as he hit Steve in the head repeatedly. Stars flashed before his eyes. Through the blood, he gurgled, “Buc – .”
Eddie tested it out for a day just like Peter had. Did something happen while he was wearing it?
Steve was going to die without knowing another’s affection and it just wasn’t right. Tony stated, “I mean…” He couldn't believe he was doing this and stated, “The feeling is mutual.”
Tony unexpectedly laughed. It came out of him so fast that he had no chance to stop it. Steve grinned at him and Tony smiled at him too and carded his fingers through his.
It took Tony only a few seconds to see how broken Wade had become and, he bitterly admitted to himself, it was because of Peter and Wade’s close relationship, a relationship Tony had been trying to deny…
Tony ran away to the bathroom as soon as he was able and stuck his head under the faucet. All he wanted to do was touch himself to release the pressure in his cock but every time he closed his eyes all he saw was the horror in Steve’s eyes and it made him nauseous.
Steve shook his head and murmured, “It’s even better than a dream. It’s real.”
Tony chuckled as he rolled his eyes and mumbled, “
Steve wildly nodded and then ran to the bus with the matching number on his ticket.
“Jarvis?”
Steve smothered his chuckles and Friday announced, “Peter has returned to the Tower and wishes to know your location.”
Steve grasped Tony’s head and reclaimed his lips. Tony hummed with approval and slid his glorious tongue back into Steve’s mouth. Tony began to slowly hump his hips into Steve and Steve automatically met his movement with thrusts of his own.
The detail ended up being delayed which soured Steve’s mood. The extra hour it took them to arrive could have been spent with his son.
“Hem hem.”
Every precaution he made amounted to nothing.
Steve couldn’t stop his eyes from tearing as he got closer to the property. He couldn’t even run anymore and jogged weirdly as he randomly laughed and cried like a crazy person.
Once he found another girl, someone as great and beautiful as Peggy, the feelings would go away.
So the months flew by and one day Steve happened to look at the date and he realized their one year anniversary would be coming up…except he didn’t know which date to choose.
“Out to you maybe,” Tony replied sulkily.
He tossed the empty bottle over his shoulder as he left the lab. Dummy would pick it up or set it ablaze, either way it would be disposed of.
Tony sat up with a huff and his eyes trailed over Steve’s bedroom. It was nondescript and he could tell it was furnished before Steve moved in. There were very few personal touches to the décor other than items that had been placed recently.
Turning to said hero, Tony said, “We need to put this thing back together and keep
“Us. I am calling an end to it,” Tony stated. He had to put an end to it. He wouldn’t let Steve stress about it because he would. He’d worry about hurting Tony or double think starting something with Sam. Tony was selfish but he wouldn’t take that from Steve…He deserved the best.
The projection of his father reached out to the suit and grasped its neck, emulating what Howard had done at that moment in the alternative future. Howard whispered, “I would
Tony groaned, “Jarvis please explain to Steve that it is not a big deal.” How many times did he have to say it was only once a year?
Tony looked over his shoulder, his neck muscles protesting as he did, and peered questionably at Steve. He asked, “Out-out? Do you want to make some kind of appearance or –?”
“I’m sorry, Sir. I was just reacting to your life being in peril,” Jarvis retorted smartly.
But by now he knew Tony would not leave him, whatever the verdict, and the fear was washed away as soon as it appeared. Nevertheless, he held Tony a little tighter all the same…
Wade sipped on whatever alcoholic concoction Natasha had mixed up for him. She guessed correctly on his extreme sweet tooth so he could just barely taste the rum inside. He leaned against the wall and watched Peter interact with his friends.
Metal shudders started to close over the windows, as Jarvis stated, “Sir, a projectile has breached the building.”
“Gwen, eh?” Tony said. “So what’s the story? She broke your heart or wants to just stay friends?”
The resulting empty click stopped his heart.
“The Red Skull does not run,” James stated to her and not over the communicator. She picked up their pace. They had to get out of there. If they were still monitoring the interior of the building then...
Barring scarring Peter again, Tony yelled, “We’ll be out in a moment!”
Tony was pacing and Steve was sitting on the couch watching him.
Steve smiled diminutively at him and nodded. He looked at his food and said, “Good. That’s all I want. We can continue our affair in the privacy of the Tower but…out here we’re just friends.”
They were several miles away from the target location and on the roof of some nondescript office building. The entire team was surveying the location in their own way. Clint was at her side also looking through his own binoculars, Thor was flying reconnaissance, and Bruce and Tony were still in the quinjet, looking up the blueprints to the building.
He pretended not to notice but Tony very pointedly called him Howard, not Dad, even after Howard discovered their relation. There was a history there that Howard had yet to experience but Tony had already lived. A history where Howard and his son were estranged…
"He's nice."
"Donner, will you shut up?" snapped Tony.
"Oh my God," Steve whispered, and his breath hitched. "I didn't think there was anything the museum hadn't already snapped up," he murmured and gently took the photo, holding it closer to see it. There was more photographs but the Smithsonian had everything, something Steve silently resented. Most of it was from war photography, sure, but they had some of
He wasn't worried about Tony reading them. He'd never shown any real interest before.
Still feeling stupid, Steve headed back inside.
The only visitor to Steve's room before the psychiatrist was a lone nurse, who came to change the bandages on the back of his neck.  The old bandages were soaked through with blood, and a thin yellow liquid that was probably a combination of pus and lymph, and a clear fluid that smell strongly of musk and heat and... well,
Then his face split into a smile, one that was incredibly charming and winning and that Steve and Pepper knew was completely and totally fake.  "Yeah, let's go have a holly-jolly interview, Stevie. You're my favorite ho-ho-homega." He tapped Steve on the nose with a nauseatingly level of cuteness.
Everyone considered this plan.
"About this?" asked Tony, holding up a color picture of Steve shirtless.
Tony held Steve's hand and let them be dragged up to their suite.  The penthouse offered a nice view of the park; the furniture was all upholstered in a style that was both modern and timeless, as if WWII-era London had clashed with their own time.
What did that text even mean? Did that mean Tony was...dying?
That was part of why Steve had loved the fight so much. The adrenaline rush. It had been addictive.
Steve let out a high pitched sound that bubbled up from the back of his throat as Tony teased at his most intimate area. He was fully hard by this point, his erection shiny with Tony's spit and curved against his stomach.
But he could smell French toast. And, oh God, there was so many names.
The days following the mission were nerve-wracking for Tony.  He kept waiting for a call from SHIELD or, worse, a personal visit from Fury, who had a habit of popping up in his life like some sort of ominous gopher.  But that call never came and eventually Tony was forced to conclude that either they didn't care about the fiasco or, more likely, the report given by Natasha had smoothed the truth over a little.
"I think we have very different ideas of calm," Steve breathed.
about all this?"
"My Alpha," he repeated in a murmur, the phrase strangely novel as it left his lips. Bucky had never been his Alpha- never out loud. Only in technicality.
He had no one to protect; he was unpaired.
And Steve looked to the future with hope.  Because everything had worked out so far, and now, for once, he was no longer alone.  He was facing the 21st century with a bond-mate and, finally, he felt like he belonged there.  The future was bright.
Steve tried not to look nervous as he sat down across from everyone. He didn't even look at Gideon, focusing on Councilwoman Hawley over everyone else. She looked like she was going to be leading the discussions. She was prim and proper and Steve trusted her to give a fair verdict on his behaviour.
Sam's eyebrows raised.  It was a surprisingly personal, introspective revelation, one Sam would have thought Tony incapable of making.
"...what do you mean, not buy them?" asked Tony, not sure he'd heard correctly.  "You're not going to try to smuggle 'em out in a laundry cart or something, are you? There's like twenty of them, aren't there?  ...please tell me this doesn't involve any fighting or anything."  Tony knew Steve could get a bit crazy at times and this convention was hitting most of his sore spots.  They had come here to make a point. Tony didn't have his suit, he was worthless without it, and the last thing he wanted was for things to get hairy.
"JARVIS, Jarvis wasn't a slave," said Tony.
Tony stepped into the empty, cavernous house after Steve, looking around.  The indoor fountain that the stairs curled around was still flowing, babbling merrily, and the orchids were all bright.  Many had dropped their flowers but the people Tony had hired had clipped the stems and many were re-blooming.
"...ha.  DeSoto's the most obsequious human being I've ever met.  I get that from everyone. Don't want it from my partner," replied Tony.  "...don't your omegas ever
"HEY!"  Pearl barked as a man with a flashlight walked up.  "The beach is closed, you can't park your van here.  Do you have a permit for that fire?"
"Okay, folks, listen up!  We're serving the warrant at 6:30 sharp!  Once we've done that, you can all go in, but let's be clear here:
She walked out onto the back deck of Tony's lodge, dialed Aria, and said, bluntly, "What kind of trouble?"
"Hey, Steve?" asked Tony, clanking down the hallway in front of Steve.
Happy, pleasant in his own gruff way, wished Steve a good morning, which Steve returned with a polite smile.  But then Steve was glancing over at Tony again as Happy pulled the car away from the hotel’s entrance.  Tony’s bad mood was too obvious to ignore.  “...are you alright, Mr. Stark?”
"I know, I know. It's gross; mine would never bet me. She doesn't even play but... she wouldn't," Hal finished quietly, stepping closer to him. She was in a green cardigan with foxes stitched around the collar. She looked too
Natasha nodded. They knew what it was like.
, he thought grumpily.
Tony regarded Steve wearily.  Talking emotions took a lot out of him.  Steve was trembling slightly under his touch, eyes glazed, sitting quietly with his hands in his lap.  His head had tilted very, very slightly, giving Tony easier access to the spot behind his ear where the gland was.  Tony rolled his thumb over it, putting enough pressure on it to keep Steve quiet.
They lapsed into silence again, and Steve closed his eyes once more, appreciating her touch almost as much as her lack of questions.
"Tony, come-" Steve sighed as he pulled Pepper away. "...on," he finished, alone in the foyer now. Wonderful. He didn't bother to grab his shield from the gym; it was pointless. Stark security was top of the line.  He just headed upstairs to their room. Steve stripped down, stiffly. He grabbed wipes and got rid of the last of the blood away from his legs and then went to grab the first aid kit, redressing his bullet wound robotically. Steve had done this countless times and Tony would have been too shaky to help anyway.
Tony's hackles rose up and he tugged impatiently on his collar.  It was only late morning but Malick's earlier jab about his neck had done a lot of damage.   Physically, and emotionally. Tony hid his mark well and had never had to answer any questions about it.  The hackles did a good job of covering it, and Tony's hair was a bit on the long side anyway. But there were enough pictures out there of Tony that, surely, anyone with enough time on their hands could probably note that the marks on his neck and back and shoulders appeared after 2008.  After his capture.
"Ha!  Told you!" said Tony triumphantly, tapping the glass.  "Metal arms, see?"  One of the doctors looked up with irritation from her clipboard and mouthed,
He gently reached down and took one of Tony's hands, moving it to the back of his neck.
"Clint sent you guys one.  I told him not to but he insisted," said Natasha.
"There is nothing comfortable about you Tony," Steve said, although his tone wasn't critical...but Stark had this way of surprising him. Keeping him on his feet. He didn't know quite how to describe it. But Steve honestly quite liked being dragged out of his comfort zone now and then.
For a brief period, Pepper had put earnings reports into hidden folders on private servers, knowing Tony would find his way in and read them eagerly.  He had to admit, that was a good strategy to get him to read them. But it only worked for two quarters before he learned not to take the bait.
Steve knelt down in front of him to meet his gaze and Donner looked alarmed. "Please," he whispered. "You gotta see this ain't right. All we're doing is trying to protect you Donner. Because we're scared for you, scared about what's happened and what will happen if you go back to him. But we can't
, you smell
," snarled Tony.  His hackles had remained spiked since they'd opened the lounge.  "He was-- he was-- he was molesting Steve, that's what, he's always had a fucking creepy obsession with him and he-- fucking--"  Tony got too worked up to finish.
Pepper walked up suddenly.  "...Tony, did you get another drink?"
"What arm?" Sam prompted.
"Experienced?" repeated Tony with a small grin.  "You mean old?  ...I'm glad you don't mind."  He touched Steve's jaw back, the only sound in the room the faint buzz of the air conditioning.  "...to be honest, though, I can't say I know very much about omegas."
then?  Sounds thrilling.  And Sam goddamn loves those..."
And then Steve slipped into the water, naked, and waded over. He gently slid the sunglasses onto Tony's face. "You really are used to having servants, aren't you?" he asked, tone not critical at all, more curious than anything else.
He microwaved a Hot Pocket, ate it, and then dragged himself to bed with a bottle of Jack, feeling utterly wrung out.  He tossed and turned for a moment, but gave up, eventually making his way down to the shop, where there was still the opened box of old records he had been rummaging through earlier.
excited to meet you, Steve."
Aria cocked an eyebrow.  "Sometimes
He surfaced, shaking his head, treading water and reaching up with one hand to wipe water from his goatee.  "...it was hard for me to get back in," he said suddenly.  "In the water.  Because they waterboarded me."
He stopped suddenly.  Steve was still eating dry cereal; Fury's gaze had shifted from Steve to a mirror on the wall just behind him.
"The ones I had access to, yes.  Tony.  You had a complete and total break-down when you found out about Steve's old Alpha.  Of course I read Steve's files.  You're my best friend and you bonded to an omega with a long history.  I worry about you," said Rhodes.
And Tony had just fired him. On the spot. In the middle of a conference.
"I'm going to go downstairs to take the suit off," said Tony as they walked toward the front door.  "You go see the doctor, I'll meet you in five. Ask Pepper to make me some espresso, I'm getting this crazy headache.  You know caffeine's supposed to help headaches?"
Donnie."
"...Steve?  I'm gonna take a nap, try to sober up before dinner... could you rub some lotion on my neck?" he asked quietly.  Even with the collar off, his hackles were still itching like crazy. The back of his neck had the same sort of inflamed itchiness caused by bedbugs or fleas, both of which he'd become acquainted with in Afghanistan.  His offer, allowing Steve to touch his neck, was no small request, and Steve understood Tony was trying to communicate how much he trusted his mate without actually verbalizing it.
"Hold your calls?" repeated Pepper incredulously.  "Do you have any idea how many different departments--"
"Tony!  Tony, I got your messages, are you okay?  Oh my God, I'm at the house, your house is a wreck, Tony... what happened?  Where are you?"
"Oh my God." Aria leaned heavily against a wall to see Pepper and Sitwell watching her with concern. "They were doing it in the kitchen! I'm scarred for life. Heats are crazy."
Steve nodded and headed towards the plane exit. "As I'll ever be."
"Please Nat," Steve sighed. "I just want to be safe. To know for sure."
"That's ridiculous!  I'm smart, rich, handsome, witty, charming--"
Sitwell let out an annoyed huff but complied as Steve began running his fingers through Tony's hair in a soothing manner, fingernails scratching across his scalp lightly. Tony's body trembled against his and made Steve's heart ache. He loved him. He understood him.
"I'm going to kill you," Charlotte muttered under her breath.  Callum's hackles went up.
Steve's lips tingled. The shape of Bucky's mouth was familiar to him but this was different. He shivered as Bucky's tongue nudged against his own and soon his thoughts went offline and the kiss was deepening to a point he hadn't anticipated. "Bucky. Buck-" Steve's cheeks were a little flushed and he was a little breathless. He couldn't speak because Bucky was kissing him again. He eventually pushed him away with the hand on his chest.
Tony bobbed his head, taking in more of Steve's length, experimenting with what made him comfortable.  Steve was huge (what part of him wasn't?) but Tony could definitely get more than half of it in his mouth before he began to gag, which he felt was pretty good.  Steve was begging beneath him, hips wriggling, and Tony paused to push a third finger into him, pushing his digits deep into his mate while he continued his oral ministrations.
There was something about knowing he could turn Captain America into a babbling, cursing, gooey mess that made Tony feel wonderfully powerful.  In the bedroom, at least, he felt every inch the Alpha he was supposed to be. Steve melted under him like butter.
"I don't know anything about the Winter Soldier!  He's above my clearance!" yelled the scientist, voice tight with pain.
, though, only that "it," whatever "it" was, was dangerous and powerful.  Steve had recognized it from a drawing of an actual hypercube, but a hypercube was merely a shape.  Not a thing.  Tony felt like everyone might as well be talking about "the rectangle" or "the pyramid."  Maybe they didn't know what the hell it was after all and that was all they knew: its shape.  That made it even more intriguing to Tony.  He desperately wanted to see it.  For one thing, he'd never seen a 4D object with the influence of a ton of drugs.
"Hey Lila," Steve said and offered her a small wave. The girl offered a small wave back.
, spade, you're
sounded like something you said to your kid, not your partner. Steve already didn't like Mike as the Alpha walked up to him. Mike didn't look too pleased about the detour either, like Steve was personally inconveniencing him... which he guessed he kind of was.
"How about you, Gene?  You buyin'?" asked Tony.
"Not even gonna offer a guy coffee first?" asked Rhodes.
in his shop?  God damn it.  He pulled up his boxers but he couldn't see a bug bite there, so he went back to work, forgetting it almost immediately, humming along to Aerosmith while he screwed some hexbolts onto a chest panel.
Tony couldn't say he felt too bad about their failed mating session.  He'd been warned it would be hard, and he was certain they could figure it out.  More important to Tony was knowing they were together and would keep trying. It's not like the Mark 1 had been the perfect suit; Tony was fine with working toward improvement.  They were sort of starting from scratch, re-discovering each other as mates. But Steve had reassured him he wasn't going anywhere and they were okay, and that was good enough.
it?"  Steve turned onto State Street.  "...is
Steve really loved dancing. He honestly did. It was the closest you could get to fighting, in a way. A sense of rhythm was key and you had to watch what your partner(s) were doing in order to do it well. A good fighter was always a good dancer, or at least in Steve's experience.
Steve's new suit was mostly black with deep blue details to bring out his eyes. He wore a waistcoat and a jacket and had a white shirt underneath. He let Tony fix his hair for him, because, truly, Steve was useless at that kind of thing.
"We know," Steve said, with startling optimism in contrast to when they'd been after Donner. But he didn't feel wholly responsible for Charles like he had Donner. He looked excited. The cucumbers had fallen down into his lap.
"Oh my God, oh my
a triple," said Tony.
Tony gave a small smile.  "You mean post-serum," he said, pushing his arm under Steve's neck to hold him.  "...the Mark 6 has the capacity to toss around semis. Maybe it's overkill. I dunno.  I just... always want it to be better, you know? ...I threw together the first model from scraps but that thing was still something else.  Could've easily thrown a car." He closed his eyes. The Mark 1 had been sloppy, yes. But effective. It had torn through bodies like they were garbage bags filled with vegetable soup.  Had crushed skulls like grapes. Slammed men into iron blast doors and rough-hewn rock walls. Afterwards, Tony couldn't say how many he'd killed. He didn't really want to know, either.
Tony let out a noise of surprise.  He wasn't even fully awake yet but already his hips were moving, thrusting into Steve.  Steve's whole body was tight, rigid with a sort of desperation, like he was tensing from pain, but that wasn't in; the whole room was thick with his scent.
," he repeated.  "...drives... Pepper, I gotta go!"
"I love you," Steve told him, suddenly serious for a brief moment.
sounds crazy... but it's not.  It's a very common experience and no one things less of you for it.  However, we really need to talk about your plans moving forward, because what you're doing now isn't sustainable."
Steve knew when a panic attack was coming by now. He could feel it in his own chest- a tightness and uncomfortableness that wasn't his own. He didn't know what had caused exactly but it wasn't hard to guess. Fortunately most of the suds were washed away from Steve's hair so it didn't matter that their shower had to be cut short.
The blond was making a lot of noise, all of it in English.  The soldier ignored him, waiting.
"But it makes perfect sense...
"What's that supposed to do?" asked Clint, glaring at Tony.  No one was being especially warm to him but he didn't seem to either notice or care.
"That's a remarkable insight," said Tony.  It was unclear if he was being sarcastic or not, even to him.
"I don't know how we're supposed to respond to all these summons at once..." said Tony, tearing open the envelopes indiscriminately.  "A lot of them are at the same time... let's see, here's one from Lake Cherokee... here's one from Alderdice... yep, looks like half the camps are suing us, and some of the parents, too."
Fear was unknown to him.  He was finding the restless prickling feeling to be very, very unpleasant.  He gripped the sink's basin and heard a crack; looking down, his left hand had gripped too hard.  He pulled it away.  He hated it, sometimes.  His left arm itched constantly but he couldn't scratch it, and every movement made noise, whirrings, clickings, that he was always worried would compromise a mission.  Often he was required to be completely silent.  The mechanics of his left arm could make that difficult.
He'd disappointed him. He'd let him down. He wasn't good enough.
know the first unit takes two hours to wear off," said Steve disapprovingly.
"Sixty," said Natasha.
He looked back at Steve.  In Steve's days, omegas and Alphas didn't "date."  Their relationships tended to be more closely described as servant and master.  Tony looked down at the wine menu; the light was dim; without a second thought, he tugged down the collar of his shirt and used his arc reactor to read it.
"Thank you. I needed to hear that," Steve whispered and kissed Tony's cheek because his lips were sore. He leaned his forehead against his cheek briefly, his eyes shut. He wanted to kneel down and rest his head against his thigh but now he wasn't the time or the place.
"--my-- my mate-- he touched my mate-- he touched our mark-- he made him kneel.  He hurt my Steve."
Before the plane was due to set off, Steve took the opportunity to shower. He collapsed in the sheets naked after that, downing two bottles of water and sighing as he tried to ignore the burning sensation that was beginning to rise in his gut. Why was this happening to him?  Why
Suddenly there was a hand on his head; Rumlow was stroking his hair.  "Calm down. You're with STRIKE agents. The most important thing was to get you off the street.  I'm sure you feel threatened right now because we're all Alphas and you're not with your mate, but we're soldiers, like you, Steve, and no one here thinks any less of you for going into heat.  It happens. Take some deep breaths, okay? ...Stuart, can you hand me some water for him? Here, drink this."
"What can we do about?" Hal asked, sipping at her lemonade through her straw. She looked so young. "What are
"Sure, Tony," said Steve.
"No one's... no one's been on the grounds, have they? Not in the past...hang on, what time is it?"
"Every year we go through this, Tony," said Pepper, pinching her nose.  "It's none of your business and you have nothing to feel threatened by. I'll be back from Hartford on the twenty-eighth, okay?  You're going to have a great Christmas."
"Steve-- Steve, stop-- ow... Steve, stop, I'm too sensitive-- get off," protested Tony, tugging.  His knot pulled him back and Steve whimpered, wriggling on top of him. "Steve, c'mon, stop... I'll give you more later... you have to go do that interview today before you're in a full-blown heat," said Tony, reaching down to try to shimmy his knot out of Steve.  Steve had a vice-like grip on it; Tony's fingers were soon slippery with Steve's fluids. "Let go... I promise you'll get more later..."
"But I'm making Steve this omelette special!"
Oh, right.  Status Alliance.
I think I can figure out how to make a cup of coffee."
mugs?" asked Tony, who was still nursing his own glass of liquor.
"Find the wine?" repeated Tony, even more confused.
I'm just taking work seriously."
Bucky woke up with a strange feeling.
His body shuddered with Steve's.
Tony beamed.  "Good morning, sunshine!  Look what I made for you!"
The nice thing about hitting rock bottom was that it provided a very unshakeable foundation.  Now that the worst had come to pass after all, Tony was feeling more stable than he had in a long time.
"First cousin, four times removed," said George, adding, "I checked with Aria."
"Tony, I can't get you ten million dollars at the drop of a hat."
"He's having a tantrum," she said.  "Just tell them to send over beta agents.  What about Phil? He's an omega, send him."
Steve felt a sinking feeling tug in his gut as he watched Tony make himself a drink. It was probably around eleven in the morning. He bit back a frown. Gleason's words rattled around in his head...
means, yes?" asked Karpov suddenly.
"Hey, wait a second, what's wrong with being an Alpha and a girl?" asked Natasha, eyes glinting.
"--yeah, so what?  He's probably here, actually..."
Steve walked over to the tank, holding Tony's suspicious gaze as he moved to open the tank in one go. He sighed. He already knew this wouldn't go down well. But Tony knew who he was bonded to: a
Tony sat up, oblivious to the sheet pooling around his waist, barely covering him.  Pepper was unfazed by either the nudity or the arc reactor. "No, no, hear me out, it's an amazing idea."
"Got it."  A pause.  "I'm sorry."
"I know what it's like to lose a bond, Banksy," said Donner, pulling him into a hug.  "...it doesn't get any easier. But
Steve's sketchbook had a few drawings of Tony in it, that was all. Tony's collar was still up there along with their clothes. Their phones were locked with Stark-level security. There was no way they were getting into either of them.
Steve, to his credit, didn't let his polite demeanor falter for a second. This was the man who worked undercover for Tony Stark for weeks without being caught. But under the table one hand was clenched around the side of the chair he was sat on like a vice. He was good but he was not perfect.
"Would you like to come home, Donner?"
Hesitantly, the soldier took the cup.  He hadn't eaten for at least a day and he was hungry.  He sipped the coffee; it was rich and warm. The twins seemed to be having fun in the hotel room; Karpov seemed enraged that he'd ended up stuck with them.  He didn't mind. The girl scared him, but the omega was interesting. The way he was lying on his front, his shaggy blond hair... it hit some chord in his mind, something so close yet also just out of reach.  Someone else he'd known, an omega, used to lie like that, on his front.
"What, that me and Steve are bonded?  Yeah, I heard a rumor."
thing to win an omega?  I doubt it's permanent, I think you just win them for a night.  They could just hang out with you, swim in the pool, eat my food... you know, live their life as a normal person for once, instead of
"What's that place where you cut off your hair and give it to kids with cancer?  They can have it.  Or... or maybe, uh, I don't know, uh, the... the World Wildlife Fund.  JARVIS!  JARVIS, I need you to update my will again."
"Let's do this," Steve said, sounding as hyper as he looked.
to not do it.  But I'm only twenty-five, and--"
Tony leaned forward, elbows on his knees, shirt tossed over the back of the couch, face still expressionless.
"Yes, correct.  Very good. Now sign."  Pepper dropped the stack of binders into Tony's lap.  "And anything with a checkmark on the tab, pass it back to me so I can notarize it."
Tony took a sip of his drink, eyes still training on Steve over the lip of the glass.
There was another crash from somewhere in the house; Tony tumbled off the second-floor mezzanine, hit the jets on his boots, and managed to land rather delicately on the floor with a loud clank of metal on stone
"Did... did that guy just teleport or something?" demanded Tony.  He was pointedly trying not to look at the guy's leg, bent at a weird angle.  It was making him feel ill.
He wasn't sure what to do without Steve here, exactly; he would normally make a beeline for the bar but his stomach was still a bit unsettled.  He checked out the program to see if there was anything good.
"Well, why would I?  Steve was a good role model for you.  He's strong, courageous, candid... his status doesn't really matter," said Peggy easily, sipping her tea.
I have feelings... I mean... he's cute, he's fun, he's smart, he's qualified, he's proud, he's..."  Tony blinked.  "...okay, a small crush, maybe just... a very little, tiny, itty-bitty crush.  That's all.  Look, we'll fire him, we'll get a beta..."
They languidly kissed and touched until daybreak. They spent their last few hours simply being with each other. They put forth no effort and did no strenuous activity. It was comforting but, with the rising of the sun, Steve halted the kissing with a groan. He pressed his face into Tony’s and moaned, “I don’t want to go.”
Steve violently jerked behind Tony when the projection suddenly cut off and Howard disappeared.
Steve finally broke his gaze from Tony and asked the man beside them, “Almost?”
Tony nuzzled his face affectionately into Steve’s scalp. His hair was still damp from his run and he loved the smell of his sweat.
Tony instantly froze and, for a moment, Steve thought he was dead. The gun almost slipped out of his fingers and a scream caught in his throat.
“Who –?!” Tony wheezed, unable to finish due to the tightness in his chest.
“What is that?” Steve gasped, staring up at the giant rabbit sitting next to the couch in the community room. It was so large that its head nearly hit the ceiling. It had a dog collar around its neck and on the tag it said, “Happy Birthday!”
“I was frozen, that’s different.”
Karpov reached for his face.  He blinked, but didn't move.  If he got hit, he got hit.
"O.  It's O," he said, still trying to sit up, needing to see what was happening.  He only let them push him down after another spasm hit his stomach.
"Where's Steve?"
? You're
He distantly realized his left hand still hurt and that the fingers were probably sprained but that didn't need to be fixed right this minute. Steve just tugged Tony towards the sofa and straddled his lap once they got there, his hands curling around his Alpha's shoulders.
Steve. Say it."
"I'm going to lift you up now, alright?"
He couldn't understand how he hadn't seen Captain America first.
"Oh, by the way, Donner is at the house," Steve said. "Not sure if you picked up on that. You were kind of out of it when I called him. But Gideon found him at George's. Managed to convince Donner to come back to ours, told him that if he insisted he was there of his own free will, that they couldn't take him away. And apparently Pepper gave Gideon's people a good talking to as well."
Brazinski smiled at him. "SHIELD is aware of the role they played in setting up your new life. We do not simply wish to abandon you because you cannot go out into the field, Captain."
"Good morning, ladies."
, Steve!  You know, showing them what a
His ribs were bruised and his neck... dark, thick, finger-shaped bruises arched around the back of his neck. They were an ugly purple color. Steve trembled when he looked in the mirror.
"Don't--" began Sam, but his comm had already started playing Steppenwolf's "Magic Carpet Ride."
"Why not?  Omegas are just as good as anyone else.  Besides, you were modeled after an omega."
It was a miracle.
family.  We... we do the lodge every year."
While Steve and Banksy were talking, Aria and Pepper had stopped by.  They looked like yin and yang, with Pepper's light hair and eyes contrasting sharply to Aria's dark hair and smokey eye make-up.  Pepper was in a soft pink pantsuit while Aria was in dark, swishy slacks and a dark blouse. Funnily, though, both of them were tapping away on tablets and carrying binders under their arms.
Justin's eyes flicked over to Steve, then back to Tony.  "Oh course not.  I don't expect
?"  Karpov looked furious again.  "
Tony frowned.  He wasn't
Well, shit.
Steve ended up spending a good few hours tearing through punching bags. He wrapped his hands but his knuckles still got sore. Then he had angry sex with Tony before passing out in bed. He woke up out the other side of his heat feeling strangely unsatisfied and generally frustrated. It felt like the world was slowly turning against him.
Natasha gave no indication that she had heard him; she was driving over the speed limit but her eyes kept looking at Steve's in the rearview mirror.  "Ты уверен, что не спала с ним?" she asked with a smirk, catching Steve's gaze. Steve rolled his eyes in answer and Natasha laughed. It was an almost unnerving sound and she took the next turn a little sharper than she had to. She was enjoying herself, that much was evident.
Pair-bonds rarely, if ever broke, with death being the only real condition that tended to separate partners once they'd bonded.  Tony had heard of people wasting away after losing their partners-- everyone had-- but that was all anecdotal.  Clinically, Takotsubo syndrome had been described fifteen years after Alpha-omega divorce had been legalized; whether or not the two were correlated was uncertain.  But Takotsubo syndrome was generally reserved for pair-bonds that had been around forever, like Howard and Jarvis.  And besides, he and Steve weren't paired.  Tony had merely
There were a pair of lattes in the cupholders in the back.  Steve reached for his and sipped it; it had cinnamon in it.  Happy really was a sweetheart.
Steve stared at the recorder curiously. It seemed fair. Though he was sure that meant Fury and countless amounts of scientists would be listening to him later, all deciding if he was capable for the field or perhaps even sane. Fun.
Peggy reached over to flip the over album over and the first picture was on Steve on stage, in the same get up he'd worn for Tony only a few nights ago. Steve tried very heard not to turn bright red. Now he
"Well, I've gotten a few offers," she said, scrolling through her emails. "A lot of charities want you was a patron but with project eighty-four you're have gonna have enough on your plate soon enough.  Let's see... erm... oh! There it is! Vogue's releasing a new omega clothes line and they want you to model for it! Isn't that cool?"
He was cold but it wasn't bothering him. Steve walked over to the bushes where he'd seen Bucky before and then felt stupid. Of course, there was nothing. Bucky was stuck in cryo and it shouldn't even be scientifically possible for him to be awake.
"Granite...?" repeated George, clearly confused.  "Like... like the rock?"
"I..." Steve seemed to gather himself for a brief second. "I don't want to ruin any of the pictures. Please. They haven't done anything wrong."
"Steve.  Since your publicist just walked in on us, can I have Pepper come in to get me a drink?  Even things out?" asked Tony hopefully.
These are also the last 2 chapters of this part of Omega Rising.  Part 3 debuts July first, and it's is gonna be lit, so stay tuned!
"Still. I couldn't do it. But then, I've never been in love."
"Hey boys," Natasha greeted them airily as they stepped into the lab's observation room. She was sat at one of the control panels, typing away at a computer.  On the wall across from the door, a window looked into the simulation room.  There was two seats set up, just in case Tony want company, but one had a fair simpler headpiece. After all, it wasn't Steve's subconscious that they'd be exploring, it was his Alpha's.
The thing was, he wasn't worried about being hurt.  He was worried about what Steve would see.  About appearing weak.  Steve's words, that he was one of the strongest people Steve knew, reverberated through his head.  They weren't comforting.  Quite the opposite.  They were an expectation Tony now had to live up to.
"He's asleep," said Tony.  "...actually, I forgot we ordered a pizza.  ...you know, in retrospect, breakfast food would be more appropriate for when he wakes up... do you have any idea how to make pancakes?  You're an omega, you can cook, right?"
Steve mulled it over in his head. "Safe...doesn't really sound like me," he murmured, eyes fixed on the jet as Happy curved them around to it.
Tony threw back his drink with a small shudder at the astringent taste of the alcohol.
"Okay, y'all have been split up into teams," said Lawrence, taking over.  "Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. Team Echo is residual and Team Foxtrot is emergency medical personnel.  Cap, you're on Team Alpha, which will be the sweep that immediately follows the serving of the search warrant and will be headed by you and Judy.  Remember to stick with your team at all times. We don't want no one being by themselves at any point, for liability purposes; I expect every single person on site to be within hollering distance of a teammate.  Y'all got that?" More nodding.
Then he cried out and curled in on himself, another wave running through him as his body fought against the inducer. "Fuck." He gasped, his abdomen burning with a cold sort of pain. Hopefully it would be over by the time they got home and Steve could just bathe and sleep. That was all he wanted. And sex, of course. But Steve didn't want to get pregnant.
He turned around with a scream of uncontrollable rage, grabbed the nearest thing he could (a small building from the model expo), and threw it across the room.
Tony watched sulkily as Pepper pulled him away from the dance floor, but there was so much good music and loud noises and colors that he was almost immediately lost in wonder.
"Yeah, sure, why not?  They're your friends.  It'll be like a double date," said Tony.  "We can do whatever you want, Steve.  It's your birthday.  You name it, it's yours."  He rubbed the back of Steve's neck with his thumb.
Steve had slept well and was in a good mood, all the drama from the day before forgotten. He was practically glowing.
"He won't know if you win," said Maggie over the tops of her cards.  "I'll see it, Mike." She tossed a collar into the pile.
"Tony! Please, just-" Steve put his face in his hands and exhaled slowly, his shoulders tense as hell. The pain wasn't so awful. Really... his adrenaline rush was dying down though and soon it was going to start to hurt to breathe,
He ran his thumb over the contours of Pops’ dog-tag and thought back to the moment he had lost it. Peter never thought he would see it again yet it had found its way back into his possession.
Steve let go of Tony’s shoulder and guardedly asked, “You can’t what?”
! No way, you got to be shitting me!”
Steve and Tony exchanged loaded glances then simultaneously looked back to Peter.
Another Hydra agent stepped forward and frantically stated, “We brought you here when the base came under attack! We were hoping to use you to fight them off! We used the –!”
The microscopic bots finished building the armor and similar screens appeared before him. He flexed his hands and murmured, “This is amazing.”
Steve smiled warmly at Tony and leaned himself and Peter toward him and Tony replied with a warm smile of his own. He tilted his head up to nuzzle his face against Steve’s and he reached out and placed a hand on Peter, creating a triangle of their upper bodies.
Steve wordlessly nodded and dragged his feet after Cable, pulling food off the shelves at random until his arms were full. When they got to the counter, Cable gave the cashier a plastic card and it paid for all the food.
Tony’s hand gently nudged Steve’s thigh and, as if he was clarifying Steve was really there, he whispered in question, “Steve?”
“I fell apart without you,” Tony confessed. “If it weren’t for Peter I probably wouldn’t have survived it…”
“Har har har, yeah, definitely not like that,” Tony replied just as sarcastically.
“Oh, my God,” Peter gasped, his hands trembling as he held Wade. “Wade – oh, my God.”
Tony’s heart flipped in his chest. The only other time Steve had told him he loved him was in that video from Schmidt but now here it was, for real, and in person. Tony knew before he was kidnapped that there was something there, but to hear it aloud…It made him feel like the happiest man alive. Steve loved him. Despite everything they had been through, they still had each other and were in love.
“When you first woke me, you told me my primary mission was to research James Buchanan Barnes.”
going to share Bucky’s fate.
Steve did as Tony suggested and grabbed a plastic-wrapped navy blue suit with a white button up shirt. On the floor, Steve spotted some loafers with dark socks tucked into them so he grabbed them as well.
“That is your son, Peter,” Ben stated.
Tony plastered on his blank board members’ meeting face and truthfully answered, “No, you keep the hair.”
“Just wanting a word with Steve,” Tony replied.
Bucky and Sam excused themselves, leaving the family to their long-awaited reunion.
The trial was always there, festering in the back of their minds and it made them more urgent and when they had sex they acted like they might never be able to make love with each other ever again.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, when did you two start fucking?” Logan asked bluntly.
Ben nodded and said, “Richard told me after a particularly bad mission. He wanted me to know in case he and Mary did not come back…Like now with the years it had been since I last heard from either of them. They’re dead, aren’t they?”
More uneasy glances and Peter’s apprehension rose.
Tony's heart swelled and he cupped Steve’s jaw to press another kiss into his mouth. But that nervousness came back and Tony paused. He dropped his gaze and stayed uneasily, “We’ll have to come out if we want to be legally married.”
“I…” Tony paused and Peter looked up at him. “I’m sorry for restricting the computer without talking about it with you first. It was stupid of me…”
She looked at him with an expressionless face and replied indifferently, “Stark?”
Steve chose that moment to enter the room. Their eyes met and Steve froze like a deer caught in the glare of oncoming headlights. He looked petrified and spun right around, practically fleeing the room.
She began monotonously, talking about her cleaning duties at the Tower but then she got more emotional and her eyes got a faraway look as she spoke of the attack and described it in great detail.
“Now you know how I feel after walking in on you and Pops!” Peter retorted, playfully pushing his shoulder.
“Y-You do?” Tony gasped.
Tony gulped and focused his eyes on Steve’s right shoulder. The smooth skin and muscle made his cock twitch. Lovely, a hard-on will definitely cajole Steve right now. Steve’s own dick was flaccid and any form of sex was probably the furthest thing from his mind.
It did not surprise Steve that no one could find even a trace of Bucky. After the fall of the helicarriers, Steve had searched high and low for him for weeks but never came across him, not even a clue…
Several files opened and Jarvis explained, “The team’s statistics are saved onto the hard drive.” The files were sorted in alphabetical order by the team member’s last names. The first was Dr. Bruce Banner and Tony quickly read over his file. He was impressive but didn’t seem to be connected to whatever happened to the time change.
“What are you talking about!? Of course I want to see him!” Tony hissed with a venomous glare at James’ back.
“I can have a real mattress delivered here within the hour if you don’t want to sleep on this thing,” Tony said, motioning to the tiny hospital bed beneath him. Peter sleepily followed Tony’s hand to the direction of the bed then yawned again. Both Steve and Tony paused in their argument to watch the yawn then traded knowing glances. Tony shifted Peter in his arms so the toddler was leaning back more. Hopefully, he would go to sleep soon. The poor guy must have been exhausted.
Next time, Ch. 4: The Beginning and End of a Name
“Sure,” Tony replied and they fell into step beside each other. Tony’s hand instantly was drawn to Steve’s…He wanted to hold it.
– like I threatened
It’d all be over before they knew it and then they could move on with their lives.
Bucky jumped to his feet and ran back into the shadows of the nearby trees.
His eyes were glowing red and a number of horns jutted from his scalp. On the ends of his hands he had jagged claws. He raised one of those hands and pointed it accusingly at Steve.
“How long have we been what Bruce?” Tony eluded the question.
“What mask? I don’t see any mask,” Wade retorted, tossing his mask aside and pushing Peter down onto the full length of the backseat. “I just see one very sexy spider with a tarantula sized dick.”
Steve shivered from the tone of his voice. He recognized it as the same one he had used by the pool. Tony would probably be 100% fine with Steve kissing him right now.
The man looked annoyed and Steve wondered how long he had been trying to get his attention. Standing by at the base of the rubble, by the team, stood the other detective.
Steve glanced out one of the windows.
“Come on, Buck,” Steve said. “It’s time to get up.”
“This guy is a major troll,” Sam said, smiling fondly at Steve again. “We were running separately at first and Mr. Super Solider here said, ‘On your left’ every time he passed me.
“I told you not to follow me!” Bucky hissed through gritted teeth.
Steve nodded and said, “Good. You two will probably pick up more than anyone else…”
She paused before the door then, ever so carefully, pushed it open. Her eyes focused on Peter’s small form. His back was to her but, as soon as her eyes fell on him, she felt what she could only categorize as a strange lurch inside her.
He knew now that those running shoes he had seen were the Captain’s. Captain Rogers had been in the same building as Coulson – maybe just in the other room, when Coulson was there…He could not believe he missed it. But, most importantly…
Tony closed all the personnel files around him and focused solely on the ones in front of him on the storage records of the Winter Soldier.
Every piece of him was how he remembered: his hard muscles, soft lips, the tiny happy sighs he made when they kissed, the way his fingers latched onto Tony…and those blue eyes. How could he forget their shade? They were the color of pure blue tropical waters and Tony wanted to sink into their warm depths and never leave.
Steve nodded, it had been in the files SHIELD provided. He sullenly took a drink of his beer, wishing he could feel even a little bit tipsy.
Peter sat rigidly beside Tony. His eyes were locked on the podium and tears fell unhindered down his face. His tiny hand latched onto Tony’s as soon as he sat down and held him in a painfully tight grip. On Peter’s other side sat Ben Parker. The older man was also crying but continuously rubbing Peter’s back to offer some semblance of comfort. In Peter’s other hand, he gently held Steve’s sole remaining dog-tag. He had not let it go since his father’s death and had yet to speak since then…
Barnes walked off and, Natasha watched him go with a hard expression. She murmured to the group, “We’ll execute the plan in 30…” And then she walked off, following her soulmate.
Steve's eyes twinkled like he knew exactly what Tony was thinking and, without looking away from Tony, Steve informed Fury, “In fact, I’m more than fine. I’m in an era where I can love the man of my dreams, marry him, and spend the rest of my life with him. Not to mention, my best friend is alive and probably lurking nearby, listening in.”
Steve tensed in understanding and then instantly fought his captors’ hold. The men grunted but held him strong.
Tony told Pepper he could speak and he really thought he could. He had assumed he had gone through the worst of it in the private ceremony where the emotions were more raw and true. Yet he was still too emotional and, with tears still running down his face, he stepped up to the podium. Dozens of microphones were attached to the podium and he could barely see over them. Cameras clicked and flashed madly as they captured his grief and immortalized it. To the world, Tony announced, “Steve was a noble hero, an amazing man, a doting father, and a loving husband. Without him, my life…” Tony inhaled deeply as he was overcome with emotion. The world was watching him and he always thought he was used to their prying eyes but he had never been under their scrutiny when his chest was flayed open for all of them to see. Tony felt like all the mechanical eyes of the cameras were stealing more than just his image, but pieces of himself as well. They hallowed him out, taking what little was left.
Steve smiled at Tony and then tilted his head to lightly peck his lips.
“…I’m going to go talk to Stark,” Steve announced and started walking toward the tower with a renew purpose. The only people he ever trusted with his life were Bucky, Peggy, and Howard. Being Howard’s son, Anthony was the closest thing Steve had in connection to his late friend. Solo was great in helping Steve learn but he didn’t know the truth and Steve desperately wanted to find someone he could trust with it. There was a very good chance he could share that with Howard’s son.
In send half of that second, the lightening burned into Steve’s back and, by the damaged arm still holding onto him, Tony tightened his grip and used the last of his fuel reserves in his boots and blasted a few more feet away.
like it when Tony called him "hubby."
With his jaw hanging open with shock, Peter nodded.
He thought back to when he first rocked Peter when he was a toddler and how much smaller he had been that he could easily fit in his arms. Tony had marveled at his lightweight body and soft skin. Peter had trusted him with ease and easily stole his heart. Back then, he would have never thought in a million years he would have considered the boy to become his son nor could he have ever seen this current horrifying period in their lives.
Steve’s nails dug into the palms of his hands. He dropped his head and begged, “You promise?”
Steve took it all outside and sat at one of the tables in front of the deli. He leaned back and studied the rooftops, wondering when Bucky would appear. The streets were busy as commuters walked past to get to the nearby subway platform or to explore the local shops.
Peter chuckled but obliged and leaned down to kiss Wade again. It was different kissing him upside down but it was a
Without any more encouragement needed, they hurried downstairs and lay Tony next to the broken shards of his old arc reactor’s display case.
Venom was his responsibility and if Peter did nothing his pops was going to die for naught.
with the technology of that era? It took Tony huge amounts of materials, space, and energy to create a small amount! If Tony could figure out the formula he could probably make enough to cover his armor and be completely indestructible.
Maybe this was a summer home? Or maybe this Peter had created Friday? Tony liked the idea of that, his son making an AI just like he had.
Without him meaning to, a small smile tugged at Tony's lips. The merc was wise in not bringing it up with Tony sitting right next to him.
“I thought the Avengers defeated you,” Peter grumbled.
Tony stewed over the questions as he trolled the internet. As he was looking for the photos, he was also making anonymous posts on websites about Steve’s case. He applauded the people who supported Steve and blasted the naysayers with negativity and an undeniable arguments in reply to their postings as to why they were wrong about Steve.
“Babe, the alien base-.”
The final chapter is here! Once again, thank you to all of you who have read this, left kudos, commented, bookmarked, or simply followed!
command it,” Tony smartly countered, shooting Pepper a grin over his shoulder. He looked back to Bucky and said, “In fact, let’s make this a thing. You will not hurt me or Pepper, that beautiful red head over there. You can kick the ass of anyone from Hydra, I’m sure they deserve it, so you have the freedom to do that.”
“I love you too…”
Just before sunset, when the sun was still on the horizon and dusk had yet to darken the sky, they arrived at a small town. The buildings were in shambles but, as the army, rolled through, the French citizens cautiously began to peek out at them.
Steve cupped the back of Tony’s head and drew him into a deep kiss. When they split Steve informed him, “I am in love with you and only you.”
At all.
Conscious of the arms around him, Tony whispered, “Bucky…you probably don’t remember. You fell and then were captured by Hydra…” Tony gulped and then whispered, “I – I knew you were going to fall and – and did n-nothing.” Tony pressed his forehead onto Bucky’s shoulder and repeated, “I did nothing…”
Tony and the others all made a move toward Steve as he stumbled back. He fell and drew all the eyes in the waiting room to him with the violent fall. His hood fell back and Steve raised his hand to ward Tony off.
Steve quietly moved around the kitchen as he prepared breakfast. He turned on the coffee machine and patiently waited for Tony’s emergence. As Steve cracked open the second egg for his omelet, Tony dragged his feet into the kitchen.
“You’re as handsome as the day I met you,” Steve promised and lightly pecked his pouty lips. He added, “Minus an appendage.”
“I am sorry, Sir. I did delay but the young Master has started to cry,” Jarvis stated and Steve felt his heart leap into his throat.
They were in the future...their future.
“That’s embarrassing,” Steve murmured, staring at the new wet spot on his trunks.
“Tony…you can’t keep him in a glass bubble and protect him from everything. He’s an adult. He needs to make his own choices,” Pepper whispered softly to him.
Steve stared down at Tony. He’d been with him since he was born. He watched him grow and mold himself into the man he was today. He was not just his soulmate, he was his best friend, and he was the man who held Steve’s heart. Steve had denied it for years to protect Tony but…Tony was staring at him with pleading eyes. Tony had never wanted him to push him away and he still wanted this.
Howard’s finger stilled and his eyes widened as he stared down at the crude drawing of the shield in shock as all the Vibranium components and formulas filtered through his mind and
Happy drove them in a Bentley with tinted windows and dropped them off at the park. He would come to pick them up when Tony called him.
The trial was the most talked about thing on all of the news channels and social media. Polls were being taken and conspiracy theories abounded.
Tony elbowed his stupidly grinning fiancé back, but Steve chuckled and then wrapped an arm around his shoulders which Tony snuggled into without complaint.
“I beginning to see why Bucky calls you a punk so much,” Tony yawned and pushed himself out of the bed. Steve didn't move as Tony dragged his feet over to him. He felt exposed but also turned on by the way Tony's eyes slid over his body.
Or Peter could go to kindergarten as Mary’s son. No one but a select few knew Mary Parker was Peter’s mother. Steve had even given Peter his mother’s last name so Peter knew himself to be Peter Parker, not Peter Rogers as the media referred to him. Ben and May Parker had been a part of Peter’s life almost as long as Steve and Tony had been. Steve had even Ben named Peter’s godfather. They loved Peter and, if asked, would help them keep Peter’s secret.
“Brilliant, let’s go!” Howard said, sounding way too fucking happy. It made Tony’s mood fouler.
“I can feel your pulse,” Tony whispered with a feathery touch across his wrist. Steve flushed deeper as he realized Tony could feel his racing heart. Tony leaned closer, pulling himself maybe centimeters from Steve. He drew his hand further up Steve’s arm and whispered, “I never knew you could get nervous, my dear Captain.”
Wade smiled at the teasing face Peter made toward the blond and Steve’s resulting squawk of indignation.
The madman’s words made Steve’s skin crawl. He had hijacked the networks again and stated, “A true story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese. They sound... Chinese. But they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth…My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knockoff: the Chinese Theatre. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the 'Big One' is coming.”
Peter was no longer the pudgy toddler the rest of the world saw him as. His son had grown and was a small child now, standing as high as Steve’s hip with long thin legs that no longer toddled but strode confidently.
Tony groaned and turned to the other two bots and ordered, “Butterfingers! U! Clean up after Dummy before he tries to himself!” The bots instantly went to action and Tony turned back to Steve. He said, “We could go down to Queens right now and talk to them. It can be just you and me. Peter does not have to go. We can explain the situation to them and ask if they want to meet him. It’s…” Tony pulled out his tablet and looked at the time. He said, “It’s a little after three on a Saturday. They’re probably home. You can’t keep putting this off, it will make you go crazy.”
When the doors opened, Peter cautiously stepped out into the dark corridor and walked over to the sealed door of his
He was looking for a birthday present for
“Yes, he’s wonderful,” Steve replied, stepping back from the Norse God of Thunder.
“Alright, Sneaky,” Steve said. “How can we help you?”
“What is that?” Tony asked and was rewarded with a groan from Steve. He grinned and said, “No, really tell me what it is, the concept escapes me.”
Bucky’s hands suddenly grabbed Tony, his fingers digging deep into his flesh. He gasped, “I’d be crazy not to...”
Tony laughed and grasped his hands as he asked, “Do you think we will be coupley enough for Pep?”
Steve sighed lightly and secured his arms around Tony. He whispered, “Before I tell you, you have to promise that you will not think the worst nor worry. You are very protective of Peter but he’s an adult now and makes his own choices.”
Out of spite, Tony was so tempted to shoot Howard down like he had done to Tony time and time again. Growing up, it’d been Tony’s dream to work with his father but the man never gave him a chance, stating the work was too important for Tony to help.
Steve’s teammates knew what to do. He had given them their orders already and knew they would move proficiently. With the exception of Tony, Tony was not answering his communicator and Jarvis was eerily silent.
She slowly inhaled and then stated in an even voice, “Are you going to just stare at me or are you going to help me up?”
The master held up his hand and one of his minions placed a gun in his hand. He cocked it and then pointed it at Natasha. James jerked but did not make any move to stop his master. Yet, when his master saw the twitch, he moved his gun to point it at James and her heart clenched.
And he thought Steve was dead so this sudden departure had to be traumatizing. Tony probably assumed he was gone for good.
!” He exclaimed, running to him.
Peter nodded to one of the larger lockers and said, “Pops, this is yours. Please, put on the black tactical gear. It’s the strongest armor you have and I need you to make it through this in one piece.”
The tension in Peter’s face relaxed slightly and stared at Bruce in shock.
Morning came and Tony blearily woke to the sounds of the city waking and healing. Sirens intensified with the new light and construction crews were already busily at work.
Tony carded his fingers into Steve’s hair and caressed his scalp. Tony could only imagine the thoughts going through Steve’s head and how long he’s been thinking this. He had to set this straight.
"Venom's activity may have been enough of a shock to his system to wake him," Bruce hypothesized.
Steve nodded in agreement. Tony always came back. He had to believe in his husband…and he had to be there for their son. Peter needed him now, more than ever.
Peter nodded and stepped onto the tops of his dad’s feet and then wound his arms around his neck. Tony wrapped a single arm around Peter’s torso and then murmured, “Ready?”
Peter didn’t have to ask what he was talking about. He considered it for a moment and then replied, “No, I don’t miss it…I think the risks outweigh the benefits. Venom tried to control me but I am my own person…”
Steve couldn’t help but chuckle, making Tony’s brows raise even higher and, with it, Tony’s facial expression also shifted. He was no longer looking at Steve with distrust and suspicion. He studied Steve like he was a puzzle that was hard to crack.
“Is it?” Bucky whispered and the smile fell from Tony’s face. That was right…Bucky was going to remember more than just his past as a Commando…he was going to also remember his time as the Winter Soldier.
He could
Steve meandered through the crowd and looked for anyone anxiously touching their soul implant like he was.
Steve Roger’s coffin was constructed with military grade metal and had been sealed with an airtight lock. The outside was a fortress but the inside was inlaid with the most expensive and softest silks available. The silks cushioned the walls of the coffin and a silken, red shroud had been wrapped around Steve’s remains. His infamous shield lay on his chest reminiscent to the same kind of rights given to warriors of old, like he could carry it with him in his next life.
Tony peered up at him with large doe eyes and looked like a small, frightened child. He hissed, “In the end, I lose someone I love…” Steve’s bottom lip trembled when he heard the belittled tone to Tony’s voice. Tony himself was trembling and shaking his head back and forth. He shakily gasped, “
“Coulson will know within the hour,” Clint stated tersely.
"Of all the questions about the future, of course that is what you ask it," Monty sighed heavily.
By the tone of his father’s voice, Peter was instantly on the defensive and he immediately glanced at Steve, the very probable reason of how his dad found this out,  and saw he was frowning at Tony. He too did not seem happy by Tony's reaction. Peter'd never told Steve not to tell him but now Peter wished he'd been able to be the one to tell his dad, especially with this reaction. He looked back to his dad and tersely replied, “Wade. His name is Wade and, yes, I am dating him.”
He wanted to beg Tony to delay, to keep him, even if it was for a few seconds more.
Iron Man turned to Howard and stated, “Then let us proceed without any more delay.”
Steve rubbed his arms one more time and then moved his hand to the small of Tony’s back and maneuvered him toward the bed.
“Yes! Okay!” Tony replied, his mind already racing with ideas. He wanted to do everything with Steve but he also wanted it to be special. In the past, they had to keep their relationship a secret so all their flirting and time together was short and fugitive. This would be the first time they would actually go out with the intention of it being a public date.
Bruce reached out and lightly placed his hand over Tony’s. He whispered, “Nothing survivable, but we’re still looking.”
marry someone had any part in that. If you can trust me, you can trust Steve.”
Wade was used to people confusing Deadpool with Spider-Man but that wouldn’t be the case once everyone knew exactly who he was. When he’d enter a room, he’d no longer be just a horribly disfigured stranger, he’d be Peter’s horribly disfigured boyfriend.
Natasha ran the back of her fingers over his cheek in a quick caress and then drew away to cock the gun. She commanded, “Let’s go back to the cold room.”
“Bucky’s making coffee. It’s his way of saying, ‘stop sleeping,’” Tony groaned.
Logan lit a second cigar.
“Greattt,” Tony sighed. “Who else is on it?”
“I’ll make some toast,” Pepper whispered. “Will…Will you be alright alone?”
Coulson needed to answer Stark’s inquiry so, as he started to slowly circle the room, he replied, “You’ve been quiet, Stark. You’re making Fury worried.”
Peter had to have misheard him. It had to be his mind playing tricks on him because his father wouldn’t –
Tony flushed as he remembered Steve hissing, “Don’t.”
It was different without his mask as a barrier…it was more real and…personal.
“But you told me not to!” She yelled back.
“Ugh, no, gross,” Tony groaned. He did not need that visual of Aunt Peggy with his dad right now. Tony paused, collecting his thoughts and then asked, “Wasn't – Isn’t there something going on between you and Peggy?”
“I won’t let you have him!”
His future self totally had a hand in that.
This was it. This was the moment he had been dreading ever since he started looking into it. He heavily sat down and Pepper immediately grabbed his hand. Rhodey stopped pacing and turned to watch the hologram that opened in front of Tony. He stood next to Tony, lending his presence as a form of support too.
Eddie reluctantly pulled his hand away and Peter let go of him.
Wade came back into the room carrying an armful of various chip bags. They all turned to him and he said, “I couldn’t decide so I got a sampling of everything.”
“Hence the ‘boy toy’ – who should be waking up soon,” Potts murmured pointedly.
Tony’s hands and feet were nearly gone.
“Nah…I’m up now and I…” Tony’s gaze flickered to him for barely a second and then he murmured, “I doubt I can go back to sleep now anyways…”
Steve cupped Tony’s cheeks and kissed him sweetly. His husband returned the kiss until he suddenly cut it off with a groan.
Marston thought he had bagged the interview of the season. Steve had not once given an interview since his son’s discovery. Marston assumed that was why they had called for the exclusive, last minute interview.
Peter looked at Pepper with horror and gasped, “What happened?! Did one of the compounds we were working on explode?!”
He carefully stood and paused to let the water drip down his body and let the air dry him as much as it could. Tony heard him get up and turned on his side to watch him. He smiled flirtatiously and murmured, “What a view.”
Bruce helped both of them to their feet then helped Tony into the bed. His friend moved stiffly and Bruce winced every time Tony jerked. He must be in a lot of pain. Once Tony was settled Peter scrambled up the side of the bed to join him. Bruce also helped him with a light push. He gaped at his low weight and it made deepened his sadness for the boy.
! How am I supposed to keep this a secret?!”
He'd then toss and turn the rest of the night and worry about his future. Steve was innocent. Would he run if he was proven guilty? What of Tony? He couldn’t ask him to run with him. They’d be fugitives for life…but they’d probably wouldn’t even make it far. Everyone knew what they looked like… so they would have to live like hermits in the wild…with no technology…and he couldn’t do that to Tony…But he knew he’d never do it in the first place. Running was a fantasy. In reality, Steve would let them take him and humbly serve his sentence despite the injustice.
“’Fine’ is not how I would categorize it…” Tony grumbled. He tightened his hold on Steve’s hand and he bit down on his lip before stating, “Everyone is here. We want to help you…”
“I am Friday and, by my analysis, am I to assume Wade stole Cable’s time travel device again?”
Rogers got to his feet and asked, “How do you take your coffee?”
“I love you, Papa,” Peter whispered back and the smile on Steve’s lips tugged up all the higher.
But then why did Steve have these feelings? Why did he try to kiss him earlier?
“I can talk to her,” Steve offered. Maybe Natasha did not know Bucky fought for them. Maybe she was angry because she thought Bucky had abandoned her.
Fury suddenly turned his ire on them and Steve and Tony both stiffened. Pointing at them, Fury hissed, “And you two, you’re going to get back into whatever you were wearing when you arrived and then you are going to stay in isolation until Cable arrives and escorts you both back to the past.”
"Wade..." Peter tightened his hold on Wade's arms and was glad he was still behind him. He wasn't sure how to bring it up so he murmured, "I'm sorry about last night..."
Tony looked at Steve in a whole new light. It had never once crossed his mind Steve could be attracted to the same sex. Tony had ogled him in the defrosting chamber but he hadn’t expected any form of reciprocation…Tony internally shook his head to clear it before it started leading him to more lusty thoughts. He could admit there is an attraction to Steve there but, the man himself was so uptight that he couldn’t get any tighter. He needed to loosen up a little before he got into bed with Tony.
Wade was trying to will his body to heal faster. The sooner he was healed then he’d sooner be able to help Peter. Once he was able, he pushed himself out of Vision’s hold and he walked next to Peter, refusing anymore help as he moved with his boyfriend and was trapped in his unchanging gaze.
Wade held out his hand and Eddie shook it. Eddie dropped his gaze with a flush when he realized he’d been caught staring. Looking at Wade’s tie, he said, “Nice to meet you.”
“…And it was the closest thing I had to an
“But SHIELD wants everything to do with the Captain.”
Tony lightly patted him on the chest and unwrapped his arms, leaving Steve’s neck and front cold. Tony murmured, “I knew the blue would look great on you.”
Steve repeated, “Is Zola going to die?”
“Thought I’d join you two,” Tony said. He leaned against the railing beside Steve and waved at Peter. Behind him the polar bear shifted into the water and Peter lost all interest in Tony.
Steve stepped into the living room to find the boys laying on the ground, their heads side-by-side and touching. Their fingers twitched on their controllers and, above their heads, flew Peter’s fully animated, fighting action figures of Thor and Iron Man.
There was a good possibility that someone could be spying on them in one of the surrounding buildings but…
Steve would be a little tougher. He’d be in a plummeting plane and facing off against the Red Skull…but it was still possible for Tony to swoop in.
When the final bullet clicked into the barrel, Bucky turned the gun on Steve. Steve leaned back, weakly trying to escape the bullet he knew was meant for him. Bucky pointed the gun at his head and Steve squeezed shut his eyes. He immediately pictured Tony.
“Crystal, sir,” Steve replied. "But I must insist on staying with my son. He was traumatized by Tony's 'death' and my disappearance. I can't just leave him again like that."
The next guard was bolder and forwent greeting him and outright asked, “Are you really Stark’s kid?”
“Where are you going to put him tonight?” Pepper whispered.
Jarvis most likely left him a plate in the refrigerator and Howard’s mouth was already watering for whatever it was.
A minute passed and the danger of the nuclear blast coming through was becoming imminent. With a painful gasp, Steve hissed, “Close it.”
“What does it do exactly?” Bucky murmured.
Sam watched him, alert to the difference in his demeanor.
His throat felt like it was clogging up, but he managed to whisper, “It’s not your fault, Tony.”
“RELEASE PETER, BEAST!” Thor screamed.
“Yes, sir.”
They eventually took the trip to D.C. a week after Bucky asked. Pepper requested the time, hoping SHIELD would have a better hold of itself in the time. SHIELD did use the time wisely. Hydra was pretty much devastated by the time they left California and the only remaining agents were on the run and being hunted down.
“S-Sorry?” Steve gasped suddenly feeling shameful. “It felt amazing, Tony. I swear.”
“I really didn’t notice until I saw it,” Tony said between bites.
Looking back down at the dark liquid of his coffee, Peter bit down on his lip and worried it between his teeth. He lightly murmured, “I hope you’re right…”
Damn, he loved that smile.
Peter breathlessly nodded and Happy gasped, “I think so…”
“I’m a bastard,” Tony hissed. “I should have kept tags on them. I did not even know my own cousins were dead! I’m horrible! I’m a horrible, horrible person! He is going to despise me!”
“Yeah…Sorry about that. Think of it as a compliment. You’re hot and my body is letting you know it’s excited to be touching you,” Tony said with a cocky smile to disguise his fear. Was he pushing Steve too much? Was going to destroy their friendship in the end?
Steve would not try anything risky with Peter so he went for the direct approach. He stepped out of his room and walked only a few feet before getting stopped by one of the personnel.
“After everything that happened last year, no one would have faulted you for not wanting Bucky to live in the Tower but you let him. And now you are trying to help him get back together with Natasha. You’re going above and beyond…” Steve reached across the counter and lightly caressed the side of Tony’s arm with his thumb. He murmured, “So thank you.”
“Because you hit me first, so I am clearly Subject A. Now, are you going to throw the paperclip first or should I do it?"
“That sounds disastrous!” Steve gasped.
No one had thought his mysterious lover was in fact was the dead Captain America. After a while, when neither Steve nor Tony did anything scandalous, the paparazzi stopped bothering them and moved onto the next big story. They knew it wouldn’t last and, when it was eventually revealed, the paparazzi’s attention would increase by tenfold.
Tony grinned at him and whispered, “I love you too, you sap. What brought about this sudden declaration of love?”
When Cable saw the photo in his hand, he put two and two together and he leapt to his feet and demanded, “What the fuck did you do?!”
Tony shakily put the mug on the coffee table.
They landed in an array of dazzling lights bright and sparkling as fireworks with glittering images of people and events passing before Tony’s eyes too quickly for  him to focus on.
Number one was apprehension. He had hoped the charges would be dropped due to insignificant evidence but that clearly was not the case now. He was going to trial and, if he lost or not, history showed everyone would think him a rapist.
Steve dropped his head and Tony couldn’t take it anymore.
– I love you, you Goddamn ass! I did not want to hurt you and the only way I used you was by proposing this scam of a relationship and truly loving it. I’m sorry I fucked up your schedule.”
“Venom has been taken into custody with Eddie Brock,” Steve explained.
Venom’s body exploded stabbing into Wade and Tony before Steve could finish his warning.
“Triple shot coming up!” Gary replied with a smile. He gushed, “You know I’m famous now? They got a picture of me serving you two your coffee yesterday and it’s all over the internet!”
“Papa!” Peter exclaimed when he came into the room. He took in his uniform then gasped, “Did shu save dat-tha world?”
“I saw,” Steve replied. “And it was clearly about Peter…”
Steve let them know they were fine but, he was drained from the long car ride and stressing over Bucky. As soon as his best friend saw him waiver slightly, he pounced on Steve and made the others give him some space.
“Can I go too?”
…well, you seem like the perfect bargaining chip…Seeing as we’re family, I thought you wouldn’t mind helping your little brother.”
“And I’m still not here,” Tony murmured with a roll of his eyes.
Steve’s wild eyes frantically searched the dark room before they settled on Tony. His fear broke down into a shattered relief.
They all assumed he had some type of amnesia so they answered all his questions about the modern world without pause. It was a blessing because the world changed vastly since Steve was last awake and he would probably never figure out how to navigate it without help.
Tony stood in the center of the room with holograms, projected from Jarvis’s cameras, in a circle around him. His chest remained bare and his skin was aglow from the light from the holograms. Tony must have undone the top button for his jeans and they hung loosely off his hips, displaying the tops of his red boxers and the tuff of hair that led down to it. Steve did not give himself time to dwell on it. The lustful desire was gone from Tony’s eyes and he stared at the projections with a hard glare.
“Do we have any intel on who breached the building?” Steve asked as he followed the rest of the team to the elevator.
“Wait,” Tony gasped. Steve greedily sucked on his bottom lip, distracting him for a moment until he clarified, “
Steve rolled his eyes and lay his head on top of Tony’s.
Venom lunged forward as soon as he was close enough and tried to swallow the green beast. Yet, once again, Venom found himself being stopped. The green beast pushed him back with a growl and yelled, “YOU UNGRATEFUL BOY!”
“Don’t come any closer!” Steve gasped.
"I cannot do so without breaking several state and federal laws."
The Soldier’s cell was sparse.
He did not turn away or grimace like all of the others...hell, he was turned on by Wade.
The photo Steve’s pinkie finger was gone.
Steve felt his eyes heat and he begged in a whisper, “Please, don’t make this any harder.”
Tony led him to the lineup of press. They paused to pose for pictures. They wrapped their arms behind each other and they both hooked their hands on the other’s waist. They smiled and ignored all the questions being thrown their way.
He knelt down but made no move to pick it up instead leaned forward pressing his face to Steve’s crotch. Steve’s hand immediately reached out to the wall for support as Tony teased him to full staff.
“The heart of the beast is nowhere to be seen however,” Clint cut in. “There’s been no visual on the Red Skull.”
Tony shamelessly muttered, “You know, if you were cold, I have several creative ways on how to warm a person up.”
Steve expected him to take off his top first by the way Tony had been touching his torso but the mad genius bypassed that and went straight for Steve’s belt.
“Avengers program?”
Steve whispered, “Yes, sir.”
Tony carded his fingers through Steve’s and whispered, “Me too…”
His mind flashed back to that pivotal moment when he decided to pick up his crying son and the bullets hit him instead of Peter. If he had not done that Peter may have been dead right now. The very thought tightened the muscles in his throat with dread and he squeezed Peter as if to reassure himself that he was still there.
"After we avenge our parents.  After we kill Stark. Then what?"
.  A seam.  An "other."  That's how bonds felt to her, as a beta, a sort of mental stitch.  A clear line demarking one mind from another, yet so obviously connected, woven together.
He looked up at the wall piece again.  Was that how Steve saw him?  It was beautiful.  A good way to preserve the old arc reactor.
Steve winked at Sean as he walked away and the omega's face lit up.
, Steve's brain provided childishly. He almost smiled.
"We have some queries. Four different possibles. But nothing has been confirmed."
"--he's setting a fire."
"You're going to clean this up in post, right?" asked Tony through the handkerchief, all too aware of the camera crew drifting around.
Abby pulled a face. "Oh the whole thing is gross. They say it's just for a
"Well, Captain," said one of the doctors, flipping through his chart.  "...this probably doesn't come as much of a surprise to you, but aside from the ankle and your neck, we don't see any other injuries at all, so we'll be able to discharge you in about a day or two.  Until then, get some rest. You look like you need it. ...oh, and you're scheduled to see a... Dr. Gleason? Tomorrow at nine." She replaced the chart and walked out, turning off the light after her, leaving Steve alone for the first time in literally days.
One of the staff gave Steve his clothes, now washed, in a bag, and escorted them out, opening the front doors for them. He bid them good night, which Steve politely returned, and they headed outside to find Happy waiting for them with the car
The doctors had told him the ice had fucked up his biology. No more heats (he'd been too sick for his body to have them in the thirties anyway). No children (not that he really wanted any). He'd had no hint of one for the five months he'd been awake.
"We...we don't do threesomes," he told her. Although, for a heat, it kind of made more sense. It meant once person wouldn't half kill themselves by keeping the omega satisfied alone. But not right now. Steve patted her arm. "I'm sure you'll find someone great."
get to him.  Yet he didn't miss the universally accepted notion that he was clearly not the primary Alpha.  People knew his dominance status was low, and their questions clearly indicated that. It made Tony feel like a piece of shit and, God, if he'd ever wanted a drink, it was now.  He was planning on getting well and properly hammered as soon as the cameras were off.
"I'm not his Alpha."
"Tony! Fuck-" Steve went to move Tony's hand away from him but found he couldn't. He squirmed as he felt fingers rubbing over slippery thighs and swore under his breath.
It was after sunset by the time Steve came home.  JARVIS alerted him; he jogged up the stairs to greet Steve.
When Steve woke the next day, he woke thirsty and horny amd sore. And the day passed like the others had, except without the awful call from Maria telling him his other mate was awake. Steve tried not to think about Bucky (which was especially hard when he was, well...hard, all the time). On a primal level Steve would always want him. Oh, his traitorous goddamn body.
"You're not pressuring me. You're doing like the opposite of that," Steve assured him. He moved to sit on the bed, near Tony's head so he could glance down and meet his gaze. His heart was hammering away in his heat a little. Steve swallowed. "And I don't expect you to understand from my perspective. Just like I can't really understand yours.  We're different.  It's okay.  "
The learning annex didn't look anything like Tony had pictured.  He was reminded of a waiting room at a massage parlor or a therapy office.  They were in a narrow, dark corridor with a couple of little potted plants and a little table with a tiny fountain running.  Tony spotted a white noise machine on the floor under it. Yeah. Total therapy vibe.
Tony's already agile brain, capable of switching between multiple streams of thoughts at once, often giving the impression of a short attention span, was about ten times worse when he was on any sort of stimulant.  If Pepper had her way, he wouldn't even drink coffee.
"I'm sorry."
Judy appeared and peeled the bottle of whiskey from Tony's hand.  "Mr. Stark, public inebriation is--"
"Please Tony, don't shut off from me now. I can't take it."
"I understand Steve is good for him," Aria said, taking another small sip of wine. It was sweet and smooth and ran down her throat pleasantly. "But it's Steve I'm worried about, I mean obviously I'm bias...as are you. We're allowed to play the favourites game a little, I think. Steve is a huge personality. He's 'captain America.' But on bad days he still feels like he's in the forties and sometimes he needs Tony to remind him he's a
"You're high and I'm not encouraging this by giving you what you want," Steve told him pointedly, the edge of his lips twitching upwards. Tony was so indignant about it' it was almost sweet.
"What film are we- oh!  You think we're actually going to watch a movie.  Cute.  Allow me to introduce you, Steve, to the concept of Netflix and chill.  JARVIS, TV!" called Tony into the cavernous front room.
strange. He looked the same and yet, at the same time, entirely different. His face was more severe, sharper. All the boyishness had faded and a maturity was in its place. His hair was long and ragged, a state he never would have left it in before and his eyes- they were empty, like there was nothing behind them.
Pepper cringed.  "No.  Bad idea, Tony.  Justin's presenting tomorrow.  He was very insistent, so we gave him a slot, but--"
Bucky nodded.
"It's fine.  I appreciate his concern.  Although I'm here for Captain Rogers, not you, Mr. Stark."  He leaned a little to the side to see Steve.  "We should probably rebandage that.  ...please sit."  While Tony had been grilling him, the red spot on Steve's bandage had spread a little.
"My neck hurts," was all he had to say. "Like, really hurts."
Tony gave the microphone a couple of taps.  "Hello?  Is this on?  Can I get this-"  There was a shriek of feedback and everyone groaned.  Tony winced.  "Oh, ouch, that was unpleasant- oh, good, there we go, that's better- can you hear me in the back?"  Tony pointed the microphone toward the crowd.  He was walking easily around the stage, apparently unperturbed by the vast, empty space, or the fact that he was in jeans and a t-shirt.  "...kind of embarrassing that we still haven't figured out microphones, huh-"  The crowd laughed easily; Tony was talking to them like he was in front of a friendly crowd of twenty friends instead of a sea of strangers.  "-well, it's good to be back- I kind of miss the dancers, though, to be honest, feels weird to be up here without them-"
"It's not a hair donation charity, is it?" asked Tony, tearing open another card.  He skimmed it and placed it in the "normal" pile.  The next letter, addressed to Captain America, was a plea not to trust the government, pointing out that jet fuel couldn't melt steel beams.  Tony put that in the "crazy" pile.
Tony was looking away now.
The last few weeks had slogged past with a certain shine to them.  Tony knew Steve was restless; the guy was up at dawn every day, working out, but Tony was content to play around in his shop with the new suit and ignore as many e-mails and phone calls as possible.  He got a brusque letter one week after the battery of SHIELD tests informing him that he was approved for active duty (or rather, that Iron Man was approved for the Avengers initiative) and to await further instructions.  That was it.  No more, no less.
"Maybe ten grams, hardly any, listen, Rhodey, I'm going to implant--"
"Steve is," said Joey.  "Once a soldier, always a soldier.  ...come on, it's this one." He pulled out a key fob and clicked it; a little electric car parked on the curb chirped.
To distract himself from the ache in his chest, he played Tetris on his phone half-heartedly until they landed, and then he let Steve escort him into the limo and to the hotel.  The time zone change and climate difference made Tony feel a little under the weather.  Or at least, that’s what he told himself.  He didn’t want to think about the other possibility, that he was legitimately ill.
"Tony.  Steve says he'll be here in twenty minutes."
"I'm tired and I want to be in bed already," Steve said and opened the car door. "Thanks for the ride, kid."
"Tony?" Steve asked quietly. "Tony, what does it look like?"
"Not a conscious choice, Mr. Stark.  ...I'm sorry to say that, usually, the more dominant Alpha's mark is the one that the body accepts.  Even in cases of forced bonding."
Steve had seen Natasha be aggressive before.  But not like this. Her words, her tone, the volume... all of it was hard and violent.  She looked ready to murder Tony.
"...the heck?"  Tony shook the box; a note fell out.  He plucked it up.
"I'm not keeping an eye on him. I'm not his goddamn babysitter," Steve said, certainly not sounding impressed as Tony half staggered past him.
Steve smiled back. "I can imagine."
," he said. "And the fact that it got all the way into the house makes you guys seem like easy pickings. And even if they just got recordings of you doing...that, it could definitely damage Steve's reputation."
Before, he'd simply bitten, sharp and hard, instinctually, and his teeth had always found the mark perfectly.  The second his mouth was over Steve's neck, though, he felt nothing but a sort of painful confusion, because the scar was no longer fitted to his teeth at all.
"Since January, okay?  Just a couple of dates... it's nothing serious."  Happy paused. "Yet."
"Crap!" he exclaimed.
Steve's mind drifted back to a conversation with Aria.  She hadn't seemed to want to comment much on Steve's bond but Steve had asked her, several times, her thoughts, and finally, she'd caved.
with our big squishy frontal lobes, and, to quote Phil Collins or Coulson or whatever that little dork's name is,
Tony's goatee twitched in a smile.  "You know how to flip the screen?"
"No," agreed Happy as they drove down Pennsylvania Avenue.
Tony felt Steve's body tense and clench and harden all at once; a moment later Tony's mouth was filling with Steve's seed.
Tony nosed Steve's hair a little.  His smell was still very Steve-ish but it had changed, very, very slightly.  It was all the more unsettling for how subtle it was than if it had changed radically.  It was... uncanny.
" she shrieked.
Steve squeezed his hand back, a reassurance.  They were going to get through this, together.
him, and it felt like he did. Steve whined loudly as he was filled, aware of that sensation and little else. His body tensed and his back arced up and Steve only realised he'd come to when he felt the wetness of his stomach. He squirmed beneath him, looking at his Alpha with a dazed expression like he was only just now seeing him for the first time.
"Agent Hill says her closest match is a Colonel Karpov. He's been with HYDRA since the cold war," Sam said quietly. "Where did you see him, Steve?"
"I collared
"...Ty said he was worried about us, and then you came out and said the right thing.  It really helped drive my point home.  Thanks."
"Oh... Oh, God, Captain--" blurted Tony without thinking.  "Yes-- Captain-- oh, fuck, yes, God-- you gonna take it-- you gonna take what I give you?"
A sudden moment of clarity.
Happy was waiting at the curb; Tony opened the door for Steve, pushed him in, and slid after him, slamming the door in the face of a TMZ reporter.
to get in." He paused.  "Unless he's like, a super-genius."  He looked the blond up and down.  "I don't think he is," he added, sounding almost disappointed.
"Maybe a break from SHIELD is good for you, Steve.  You and Tony... you have a lot of stuff to work out.  Relationships aren't easy," said Natasha.
"Four... three..."  The cameraman mouthed the last two numbers, two and one, then pointed to Steve and mouthed that he was live.
?! -into it. Steve kicked his jaw and knocked him out, finally lifting his gun to shoot the other remaining agent in the chest when-
"You have an agent?  You know how to text?" asked Tony.
He wondered when he should shoot himself.  It was getting bad.  Not unbearable, yet.  But he didn't think he had much time left.
"I'll pass, thanks."  Pepper, as usual, was completely unfazed by Tony's flirting.  She rose, her attention already drawn to her Blackberry.
But they wouldn't know until they got him back.
He glanced up from the program as Eric was asking Tony about his suits, something to do with metal. Whilst Eric wasn't even acknowledging him slightest, he wasn't like Gideon and his chums who were openly hostile.
Steve smiled at the memory.
"I love stunts," said Tony quickly.  "Remember Monaco?  Bad decisions and impulsive behavior are the cornerstones of my entire system.  I mean, that makes up about seventy, eighty percent of everything I do. Seriously."
Watching Malick get so flustered he gave up and walked away almost made Steve feel better.
Oh lord. Pepper was going to kill him. And then bring him back to life. And then kill him again. Steve's throat went dry. This was a disaster. This was the worst it could have possibly gone. His phone buzzed in his pocket. It was Fury.
"Yeah, I can tell," whispered Steve bak.
"Not hard, my ass," she mumbled under her breath.
Steve had the energy of a border collie and kept pacing around, grinning like a fool.  Tony wondered if there was any truth to what Steve's psychiatrists said, about him only being happy when he was fighting a battle.  Steve was approaching this like a military operation. Certainly, it had militant overtones, but... still.
He watched Tony go with a heavy exhale. He ran a hand over his face. Tony was almost...too good at that.
Tony opened his mouth but nothing came out; the lump in his throat was too big.  He closed it after a moment.  What was there to be said, anyway?  He'd mated Steve because there hadn't been a mark there.  Except there was, maybe, a mark covered up by the serum.  A claim laid by another Alpha who death was now no longer a certainty.
...besides.  He had an auction to attend.
Steve's sleep was restless, but he didn't dream, his mind bogged down with enough visions for the day.
"And Status Alliance is also donating a hundred," said Banksy.
"Please-" Steve gasped out, squirming beneath him. "Tony. G-get us out of here."
"Phil's fine," said Phil, sitting down next to Steve.  He seemed to pick up on the weird smell, too.
"Hey!" cried a young, black omega.  "That's my chair." Tony pulled out his wallet and handed the man a hundred-dollar bill.  "...but, uh, you can have it. I like the floor anyway," said the man, tucking the bill into his pocket and sitting down on the floor.
Clint sat up.  He was in the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility in the middle of the Mojave Desert and he had been on a six-hour break from guard duty, which meant, for Clint, sleeping.  His room was small, a tiny room outfitted with three other cots and lockers for other agents.
, Steve," she was saying.  "I mean, I believe you're having these flashbacks... but not that they themselves are based in reality.  I'm sure they
"Again, not Steve's fault.  While I'm sure this all might seem crazy-"
This would be good for Tony. Steve had no doubt. He hadn't had enough Alphas in his life who weren't assholes.
Steve had no idea what they were talking about. He fought against Jarvis but soon gave in as it became apparent that the older omega was a lot stronger than him. He didn't understand most of what they were talking about. He figured it was because they were rich. His ma always used to say the rich lived different sorts of lives.  And you didn't have to be a genius to see that these people were the richest of the rich.  Their house was gorgeous, the hall wide and lushly carpeted, with art on the walls and fancy decorations on the shelves.  Every room seemed bigger than the apartment he and his ma lived in.  Which admittedly was not saying much.
friends?  "How are you liking world peace so far?" he hollered, and the crowd roared with delight.  Tony was sucked into a crowd of bodies, people shaking his hand and handing him drinks (Tony hated people touching his hands, hated being handed things), people touching him, congratulating him, wishing him happy birthday and many more (ha ha, the irony!), women kissing his cheeks and lips and cooing over him.  Tony basked in the attention, practically high from it.
Tony stretched with a yawn.  It was true; he liked sleeping in when he was home from boarding school.  Or, now, college.  He was in his second semester at MIT.  It was fun, being among college kids.  Everyone was so mature.  Some of the Alphas were already bonded.
"Steve," Phil said calmly. "You do know he's...he's probably dead."
Something tightened in Steve's chest.
He still had one hand on Steve's leg and another on DeSoto's head.
Another episode had begun.  Two men in yellow jumpsuits were breaking up what looked like blue shards of glass. Both of them were betas. It was a show that really wasn't about status. Just like
They landed a solid two miles away from the base, in a clearing in the woods.  It was still dark out; there was only the faintest hint of grey-blue on the eastern horizon to indicate dawn was approaching.
him. But then, Bucky had given him a miscarriage, and he'd gotten into a car with him. But that was still different- HYDRA had put him there, it hadn't really been his fault.  DeSoto's Alpha sounded like he was simply a terrible person.
?  Oh my God that is delish."
"Oppressive?" Donner echoed. "But they chose to be here."
The last coherent thing he remembered was Bucky pawing against the glass after Karpov.
"My advice is to steer clear of her.  She knows every trick in the book. And I'm willing to bet that she would love to get her hands on Steve."
Steve gave Pepper a strange look but still followed her out of the room, just as Rhodey was walking in. He blinked in surprise at seeing a room full of agents. "Sam Wilson, Colonel," Sam greeted, easing away the awkwardness as he held out a hand.
Natasha laughed and Bucky smiled at her like she was God's gift to the Earth.
Steve jumped to his feet, but Cable reached up and snapped him back down.
Tony stepped in front of him and trailed his hand up Steve’s torso, his fingers tugging at the buttons of his shirt as his hand went up. He leaned in and whispered, “I bet my tongue can undue you in five minutes or less.”
Steve had never seen him physically until he just suddenly appeared.
“The time machine will not work without the Tesseract. The Red Skull has it.”
Like at their tower, Osborn had a private elevator that went straight to the living quarters on top of the tower. Steve and Tony followed Harry into the lift.
{True, you’re more worried about yourself right now, aren’t you? Don’t lie, we already know the truth.}
Steve had just recently found out when he had been first removed from the ice Hydra agents had taken the same samples SHIELD took from him. They did numerous experiments that ended with just as many deaths.
!" she exclaimed, coughing on her tea.
Richard laughed almost awkward, running a hand through his beard. "Obviously it helps! Orgasms are more than just a bit of fun! They sort of-- er, suck it all up in there and certainly increase the chance of conception. And it goes without saying that you're omega will be willing to do it more often if they're having a good time of it!"
He checked his watch.  Wednesday, March 2nd.
Donner shrugged.
Steve's phone chimed.
?" asked Clint in amazement.
"I wanna come!" whined Tony.  "Why can't I--"
"He wants to have sex with me," Steve wheezed, laughing himself as he ducked his head down to press his forehead against his knees. "Asshole."
She'd put up with years of what probably qualified as sexual harassment from Tony and was willing to dismiss this as him perhaps being a little bit stupid because he was upset about the disruption to his routine and because he was flooded with hormones from Steve's heat, but she couldn't just ignore it, either.  She couldn't let him sabotage his relationship with Steve. She liked and respected Steve, and she was all too aware of the concerns Aria had expressed to her only days ago, before they'd taped
"Why are you here?"
Steve moved on instinct and this time he didn't hate himself for it. He savoured the delicious tremble down his spine as he moved to kneel on the floor before Tony, hands grasped behind his soldier straight back in a perfect posture as he bowed his head down in the ultimate submissive gesture. It was as simple as breathing.
It was all coming together.  Tony's heart ached for his omega.  He was aware that he was repeating "right?" a lot, but he couldn't help it, because Steve and Natasha were ignoring him and Tony felt like he was still missing something important.  It was making him feel stupid, a sensation Tony virtually never, ever experienced.
"Am I the only one who doesn't need a gimmick?" asked Natasha.
"I can get another vasectomy though, right?" asked Tony.
"...I think we're okay," he said quietly.  It was more of a hope than a thought.  But it wasn't like Steve could reveal anything worse than the partial bond he still had with his old war buddy, right?  No, learning that Steve was already bonded to another Alpha was literally the worse thing Tony could think of, the greatest betrayal.  There was nowhere to go but up.
would have been a better name than
Finally, the beam hit the particle bottle ring, the thin wire triangle that should stabilize it.  The room lit up, white-hot; Tony was sweating, and he could smell Steve, and above him, Coulson and Barton, all of them alluring in their own way, their sweet little omega scents mixing with the other comforting, familiar smells of Tony's lab: oil and grease and gasoline and hot metal.  The particle bottle ring was glowing blue.  There was a loud boom from below them.
The phone rang.
"...make sure you're careful," said Tony as they rode down the elevator.  "Not for you. For those other omegas. I don't want you to get them in trouble and them have them getting
Shit. He hated being uneducated. He wished they'd used protection. Shit.
Steve squeezed Tony's hand back, the touch oddly grounding. He swallowed as they were lead down a corridor, Pepper walking out in front. They turned into a dark room, the edge of an elevated stage peeking out at the end of it with curtains hiding the rest of the platform. It all looked rather intimidating. A beta guy came around and offer them juice boxes; Steve politely declined. He let out a long, slow breath and ran a hand over his face.
nights? You mean--?" Steve's face clearly portrayed his emotions. Hal gave him a look of sympathy.
"--hope you're hungry," added the woman.  She, like Cooper, signed most of what she said, giving the impression of someone who was passionate about their words, her gestures fast and smooth, like an overly-emotional senator giving a speech.
"Just to be safe, we also recommend taking levonorgestrel after mating.  10 mg."
see that stupid jerk," said Tony.  Hammer was one of the few Alphas Tony felt he could handle, and he was itching to put the guy in his place.  The way he'd come on to Steve in Monaco... yes.  If Tony was only going to assert his ownership of Steve over
"One right does not mark out a wrong. But it's a start. And it's a gesture. I am not saying that tonight will compensate for my actions, or anyone else's. But I am hoping that tonight makes it evident how seriously I am taking the consequences. Thank you."
"I'm not watching you die because of mistakes I made seventy years ago," Steve disagreed, curling up under the sheets. He missed being small again, being able to hide under the sheets when he'd pissed Bucky off.
His right arm was throbbing with the effort of keeping Bucky's metal arm away. Steve kicked at him with his still working foot. He was shaking. "Bucky," he whispered. "Bucky please.  You said you wouldn't hurt me, remember? You were scared of hurting me. This is going to hurt me a lot.
Sure having sex without protection felt good but Steve was
Natasha sighed and mumbled something in Russian.
Steve tried and failed not to laugh at the sight- "Sorry. I just....you look so unimpressed down there." He tucked his head over the edge of the bed and winked when Tony glared up at him before laughing again. "It's cute. Really."
"...Okay," said Tony.  He avoided actually promising.  "Not safe" was a relative term, anyway.
," Steve said. "Oh!  Or the
his mate was bursting into dinners covered in blood saying that Barnes was alive and their baby was dead, and it wasn't supposed to be like this at all, they were supposed to be safe, Vanko was dead now, they were supposed to be in a stable fucking relationship and this wasn't stable at all.
"What the hell was that?" demanded Fury, gesturing toward the window.
At eight, Steve woke Tony with an hour to get ready and another for travel time. He leaned down to kiss his forehead, and smiled when Tony made it clear he was not impressed. "If you get up now you can shower with me," he told him. "Otherwise you'll shower on your own."
Tony backed off just enough to flip Steve over, pulling down his pants to rub himself between Steve's legs, feeling Steve lubricate him, feeling Steve's hips buck under his.  Steve let out a cry of protest when Tony untangled Steve's legs from his waist but almost immediately melted into submission at his touch, letting Tony rearrange him to his liking.
In this chapter: Tony and Steve fuck, go on a date, and then head to Camp Pendleton for Tony to get an unauthorized taste of SHIELD's subconscious simulation exercise.  A bit of fun filler before the next chapter, which is long, intense, and full of flashbacks (much like Tony himself is.  Wink.)
"где полковник Карпов?"
Then Steve was crying out as Tony's teeth sank into the mark on the back of his neck and moments later he was coming. The pain combined with pleasure was
Steve whimpered, still riding him.
The snowball fight lasted for over an hour. The adults certainly went for each other more than the kids, and Steve and Clint especially ended up soaking wet. But they were doing so much running they couldn't even feel the cold. Steve was thrumming with energy. He and Cooper were hiding in the edge of the woods, making snowballs behind a tree. The kid was delighted at just being on a team with him and the serum meant Steve could keep up with the other three adults, although Natasha had headshot him multiple times. Usually Steve would worry about something like this triggering his PTSD but today it hadn't even crossed his mind.
name, so why do you care if she doesn't change hers?" Happy was saying.
Steve had showered. Or rather, panic showered (because he really was gross). After all, he hadn't showered since his long car journey the day before. He was also conscious of the fact that he could potentially smell of Bucky. In the shower his mind wandered too; he thought about how Bucky ignored half the stuff he said, touched him without asking permission... his mind was stuck in the forties and he acted like it.
Donner was nearby, listening, eyes wide as he watched Tony and Armando posturing.  Neither one looked ready for another round but both were gesturing and yelling at each other, threatening the other.
