The woman smiled, red lipstick on and hair down, tailored black suit with a red blouse and high heels. She put her sunglasses on, smiled at the camera, and presented the world's worst fear, missiles inside of missiles inside of more missiles.
"Besides his lack of creativity in bed, and his horrible taste in tech, and his too gelled, I-am-momma's-boy, hair, I don't see his creepiness"
creeps. They are fucking stalking you, you should get a restraining order, and save both of us, and Pepper, from the headache"
She pointed at one of the reporters, one who was in her CEO event, all these years before. He was tall, had a handsome too-white face, with blue/green/hazel/something eyes and honeyed hair.
A bottle of whiskey in her hand to wash the taste of caviar of her mouth and a non-lighted cigarette in the other to stop herself from screaming, she could be confused with a hooker in the middle of the dark alley she entered to escape the panic attack.
The man decided her coldness was just pettiness, and rolled his eyes, sitting as far as he could, as Natasha drank a glass of champagne and flirted with the boarding crew.
"He remembers me too much of a guy in my English 101 class, but without big eighties glasses, long blonde curled horrible hair and rotting teeth. That guy was a serious creep, the creepiest guy I ever met"
"I'll not discuss this with you anymore. Think what you may about me. But hack my systems again, or harass Pepper with your stupid things -
And they thrived, father and daughter, the biggest geniuses in the world. He showed off her, she delighted herself in the spotlight.
"You are almost thirty already? Uh oh, old man, you should be settling" Natasha laughed, her legs up against her couch, the video call in a hologram in front of her.
The press was her big turn. She woke up tired, and she definitely didn't want to do what she had to do, but that wouldn't matter for the reporters.
"Jarvis, keep me awake, please, darling" She was suffocating, she was suffocating and she couldn't stop it "Please dear, just talk to me"
Being the politician's favorite person was exhausting.  She was born in 1980, at the end of the Cold War, but that did
That didn't mean exactly that her persona, the person behind the red lipstick, and the smart jokes were okay.
"I'm sorry Tones, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, so so so sorry. I will do anything, but please, pardon me" Rhodes begged, in the hospital.
) was responsible for any damages, the price would be here to pay and the fault would be hers to take anyway.
When she was six, her first circuit board was on Mr. Stark's workshop table, glistening eyes looking at her with wonder and interest.
It took barely two minutes for it to light up, and she ran to the new unfinished armor, putting it as fast as she can, and float away, to search for Stane.
But, when she strides down to her kitchen, and see Obadiah Stane there, all fake smile, with a devil glint in his eyes, looking directly at her arc reactor, barely covered by a sports bra, she wanted to run.
Natasha didn't need Pepper to rise a Weapon Empire, and she certainly didn't need her to rise a Clean Energy one.
"I'm alive, I don't suffer from PTSD or anything, I'm not reopening S.I. Weapons Division and that is that" She smiled "Any other questions will have to wait until my adorable P.A. come with decent quotes, what I would do without a little Pepper, my friends?"
The name of her P.A. stung a bit. They had a bit of an affair beginning before Natasha destroyed everything with her lack of tact.
No one was alive, not even Yinsen, another death she would remember until she was old and grey, another casualty of her life (
"The issue is that it is my business, Miss Stark. You are a superhero now. You are a soldier, as much as anyone in the war."
She picked up the reactor, putting it in her chest with a clank. It was just her luck that her hands were small enough for this.
Extremis made her stronger, but not enough to resist an explosion. Her body repelled the major injuries over big pieces of bomb tossed at her, but fragments of shrapnel entered her chest.
He laughed, and suddenly, Natasha wasn't stressed. The press didn't exist anymore, neither Pepper or Coulson or
She would break that promise two days later when strange, terrorist men waterboarded her. Then and there, Natasha promised to kill each and every one of them.
"I don't want to make the 'frick-frack' with you neither, heathen, but….. Killian? That guy has serious problems"
She got home, and went directly to her workshop, to improve the armor. She needed to be safe. At all times. She did a new arc reactor, put the older in a safe place. It was her heart, after all.
"No, I cannot, my dear terrorist" Her voice from inside the armor sounded male, and mechanical "I hope you burn in hell"
"I just want you to help me escape from this hospital, and take some months to stay with me, at the Mansion" She pledged "And never do that again, never, platypus"
) "You'll tell them Iron Man is your bodyguard, and that it wants to keep its identity a mystery, because his family or something, right Miss Potts?"
"How ironic, Toni! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever! And now, I'm going to kill you with it!"
A high-neck tick golden dress kept the arc reactor far, as she smooches her way into the place, taking a glass of champagne in one hand, while the other touched coldly her "partner" in the arm.
"Creepy Creepister Clone Killian? Maybe it's a brother or something" She shrugged "Maybe it was a clone, a multiverse experiment…. I just find Killian less boring than Hammer, and they both are at each party that I go"
Run to the mountains and never come back because her gauntlet was in the basement and she didn't have a weapon and
"Oh no, darling, I'm as well as I ever been. Fantastic, I dare say" She winked, before laughing high-pitched "I'm also feeling like I could use a party, and some reporters too"
"It's a pity that I don't give a shit about being a killer" He pushed his hand into her chest and picked up the arc reactor "When I ordered the hit on you, I was worried that I was killing the golden goose. But, you see, it was just fate that you survived it, leaving one last golden egg to give. You really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you? Your father, he helped give us the Atomic Bomb. Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you?" He smiled, walking off the apartment as she gasped in horror.
Natasha may have some destructive tendencies, but she loved herself, loved her body. So, dying wouldn't be happening.
He tried again to replicate the serum, now using for base the trials in Russia on some strange virus and the small robots of the initial trials in medicine.
"Indeed, Mr. Coulson. Also, here are the cards, so you can stick to the story and don't slip up anything"
inappropriate, especially in the front of major shareholders and other businessman and businesswoman.
"Toni, I was not expecting you here" His voice was faking his joy. He was not pleased. "Thought you were recovering"
"You could say that" Natasha smiled, her best press smile, and she could almost scent Pepper's sigh of utter disappointment in the sidelines.
"Brothers and sisters don't leave each other because of weapons. They don't use each other to rank up in the
And with her small face up, a pressed smile in it, she would walk, behind Mr. Stark or in Mrs. Stark's arms (
Agent Coulson sighed, as he was expecting this, but wasn't keen to the conversation that would follow.
Sited in a table, her heart only functioning because of a car battery, she decided don't do weapons anymore.
It was like that. Almost every week. After her afternoon classes on Saturday or Sunday, get ready to a gala, or a press conference, or rich people visits who liked to coo over her for five minutes, before forgetting she even existed.
As soon as he closed the door, she started to crawl. She needed to get into her workshop, she needed to pick up her heart.
They let the silence reign a bit, the barely-woman looking at her StarkPad, at new designs for the Jericho, and its continuation, the Eden ('
She sat on her couch, trying to look less tired and beat-up. But, being the young adult, just scratching 23, that she was (doesn't matter all the trauma, in the end, Toni knows she is just a child in this big bad world, learning to walk the steps of her father), Natasha could only look distressed.
He shouted at his Toni when she left to pursue her dreams and engineering degree at MIT at only fourteen (three years before he could, he was jealous, he was burning with jealous rage. How
replicate the serum. His trials in apes and monkeys (all highly illegal, but the government threw a blind eye because it was Stark) all failed in a way or another.
"So she better runs, if she knows something. If your little P.A. runs fast enough, I might not catch her. But it might be a little late for you, Toni"
"You! What's your name? I think I remember you from my CEO press release, but I'm getting older, you know" Natasha laughed as she tapped her temple, and the press giggled (
"We mostly want to keep you safe, as Iron Man connection with S.I. is explicit" He sighed again "The press will be crazy"
So, Natasha covered her bruises and the purple bags under her eyes with make-up, let her hair down and her crimson lipstick on.
) and she and her P.A. weren't in an all that good moment since the redhead decided it was her mission to boss the brunette around.
"Well….. Like the first, I have to ask what everyone is itching to discover: What is Iron Man, as the flying hot red and golden armor was dubbed by the media, connection to you?"
He didn't look once at her unshed tears, or how her hand curved around a bottle, drinking herself away.
Nobody attacked her directly. They really needed her. But she heard the whispers, the giggles. One glare of her, though, and everybody would shut the fuck up.
"I-….Wha-... What's happening?" Her breath was suspended, and she had to put a hand on the wall to stabilize herself.
"Don't be such a fool, child. Your heart will be better off with me. You never had one, in principle" He cackled "Just a frigid, heartless, cold,
), black dress, high heels. Plans for weapons mixing in plans for robots like DUM-E in her hands, black hair in curves like a halo.
She wasn't Toni Stark, the innocent, genius, wide-eyed girl anymore. Neither was she Antoinette, the good, well mannered, child socialite.
Not because Pepper was her P.A. or a woman, but because professionalism exists, and the redhead couldn't act like a friend in board meetings or anything like that.
She slaps his hand away, hard enough to hurt even him. Her eyes are chips of ice, cold and hard. “I am Toni Stark,” she says softly, dangerously. “I am Toni
“Is something wrong?” she asks, deliberately keeping her voice light, a bare touch of concern coloring her tone.
Her speakers crackle and pop, electronic whistles and whines that make her wince, but it drags her attention solidly to the screen. And she can’t help but grin from ear to ear, all the exhaustion and muscle strain and heavy eyelids gone, as excitement flutters in her stomach, jolts adrenaline through her system.
“Of course, sir,” JARVIS says immediately, and there’s a click that he feels in the bar in his hand.
The fire’s in his throat, dancing on his tongue, splashes from his smile, and he leans forward and presses his mouth to Steve’s, soft and sweet, and all the lasers and screams and arrows and war cries wash away in purifying blue-white flames.
Bucky’s head throbs again. That voice sounds familiar, the cadence and smug fucking way of speaking, but he can’t place it. “I’m an American citizen,” he says. “I have rights.”
Steve opens his eyes to find himself in the Malibu house, but there’s an odd, dreamy surreal quality to the walls and edges that hurt his eyes to try and focus on. He takes a moment to get his bearings. It’s the den, but different. Different furniture, different television, different arrangement of things. Different books on the shelves. What is he doing here?
. Knows without having to look that they don’t contain the documents those innocuous categories would otherwise indicate. “Understood, sir,” he murmurs.
Toni takes another swig from the bottle and pours the mouthful that’s left over her head. It’s lukewarm, but it trickles like heaven over her face. She dries away the sweat and water with the towel, and tosses it and the empty bottle back onto the bench. “I’m almost legally obliged to point out that it didn’t work, because I’m not your sugar mama,” she says. “I was looking for a personal assistant, not a kept man. And you didn’t get that job either.”
It takes a few hours, but eventually SARAH — Smart And Radiant Archival Heroine — comes online, and makes her way into the Internet to see what she can see. Tony leans back as she departs SI servers and scrubs his face tiredly. “JARVIS, remind me to reflect on the morality of letting a baby AI loose on the internet in the morning, will you? I need to sleep.”
Steve knows he's going to have to move very carefully with Tony, because Tony might not always see things that should be obvious, but he has a distinctly uncanny ability to make massive leaps of logic from small, disconnected, inconsequential things to comprehension and realization when it's exactly the least advantageous for the other side he does so.
“No,” she says, and she’s a little surprised at how honest that answer really is. “No, James. It’s been, what, eighty years or so for you two? Go. Be with him. I’ll be fine.”
all the time,” Toni says miserably, swiping her eyes with her wrist. “I can feel it, and it gets stronger when he looks at me. And I know he’s not angry with
The doctor pokes and prods her fingers, and she swears at him violently. He asks her how her injury happened, she retorts that she broke it on some asshole’s face. The doctor is unimpressed with her, sends her for x-rays, more walking -- pantyhose feet slipping on the floors, because the heel of her right stiletto broke off in goon number three’s shoulder and she refuses to walk lopsided -- more waiting, more swearing at medical professionals as they maneuver her this way and that to take images.
If she notices, she doesn’t say, just matches his speed without apparent effort. “We all have our burdens to bear, sweetie,” she says with a grin. “Seriously, though. I can do this all day. Stop fretting at me.” As if to prove her point, she reinserts the earbud with a roll of her eyes and speeds up enough to outstep him, forcing him to catch up to her now.
He turns on his heel and walks back towards the door, hears the Asset whisper around the edges of his mind, caged and restless. He ignores it, because he can, but there's an edge of it in his stride.
Instead of screaming and fighting, which is probably what he expects her to do, she swings her legs up, feels her attacker’s arms loosen briefly in surprise and slide up her chest as her weight drops her down. She drives an elbow back, sharp and fast, catches him in the side just under the edge of his tac-vest. He grunts with the blow and his arms loosen again, loose enough that she slips right out and hits the ground on her palms and ass as he staggers back a pace.
“Yeah, go ahead and do that for me then, would you, J? A 24-hour lock, unless she hasn’t eaten or slept.”
He sleeps for a while, exhausted by the tests. When he closes his eyes, Peggy is sitting in the chair beside her bed. When he wakes up again, she’s still there. The doctor eventually comes back, does some more tests, simple ones, asking who the president is, the year, the date, other snippets of trivia that don’t seem important. He answers, though he doesn’t see the point. Feels his stomach churn again as her face just falls and falls and falls with every answer he gives.
“Toni needs to be somewhere she feels safe,” Bucky finally says, deliberately casual. “Is she welcome here?”
she thinks, and the tears are falling now. As Bucky sits upright, dismayed and offended on Steve’s behalf, she bends to wrap her arms around Steve’s narrow, bony shoulders. He doesn’t seem to notice, just continues to hang his head miserably, until her hand finds and covers her soulmark on his skin, and his eyes widen, head jerks back to glance over his shoulder and she feels a jolt as his eyes seem to meet hers. “You’re wrong,” she says, soft and fierce, watches those eyes soften and shine with wet emotion. “I love you no matter how strong you are. I love you no matter what. You’ll find me, Steve, and it’ll be hard, but we’ll get through it. We’ll get through it, all of us, together. Okay?”
She laughs harshly, coughs, tastes a hint of blood. “For you, asshole,” she says, exhausted, and pushes herself onto her ass away from the puddle of vomit. She’s near enough to the wall that she can lean against it, which is good because sitting up on her own is not in the cards. The knot under the red star on her chest is throbbing tightly. She wonders if the blue circle on his is doing the same. “I came for
He tries to make use of them, conscious of the value of the gifts he’s been given, but he’s paralyzed by the choices every time he tries to adapt. He stays with what he knows. Graphite and charcoal. Pastel chalks and his fingers to smudge. He has a whole box full of funny little white paper roll-sticks that are supposed to do that for him, keep his hands clean, but try as he might, he can’t figure out how the hell he’s supposed to use them, and he’s too embarrassed to ask.
Calling Pepper was a good idea, because once she finishes expressing her utter delight and pleased surprise at his foresight in calling her, she tells him to check his email and there he finds a wealth of information on the project, notably what exactly they expect for each calendar month. Helpfully included in the information he’s amazed she compiled in a short, five-minute conversation is a list of everyone’s birthdays.
“For the last time, Obadiah,” Toni says, without looking up from the sheaf of design specs and technical portfolios Pepper has sent her. “SI is not pursuing, entertaining or accepting any new contracts for weapons from anyone. I don’t care if Captain America himself walked through the door in all his red, white and blue glory, announced the Red Skull was rampaging through Manhattan, and only a Stark missile could put him down. That’s not our business anymore.”
“I know, weird request, not my usual control-freak style to have Junior run the code, but these are probably the most lethal protocols I have ever slapped together in under ten minutes. I want to make sure they are
“JARVIS,” she says, grimaces, pushes a hand against her chest. It hurts to talk. “JARVIS, you there?”
And that’s when he drops the act, flares into a bonfire, and bolts at top speed for the holes in the bulkheads through which he entered, and doesn’t even care all that much that he bowls over the workers who have now appeared to continue their crucial repairs.
Clint’s frustration and aggravation are a tight, roiling ball in Natasha’s chest, clenched hard enough that she’s concerned the teasing is going a bit far. Normally, she wouldn’t worry, but it’s been a stressful few months, and he’s always taken awhile to come back down off the edge. This, at least, she knows how to handle. She stands and moves to the couch, settles against his side. Abruptly, the ball shifts to pleased surprise, and he only hesitates for a moment before dropping his arm around her shoulders.
“What, the texting, or me and Clint? Actually, doesn’t matter. We’ve been doing that since we first got together, so...Thirteen years? Yeah.”
When she gets back to the living room Rhodey’s still sitting on the couch, uncommonly still and serious. There’s a thoughtful, cautious, assessing expression on his face that Toni isn’t sure she likes. It’s, in fact, making her anxious, nervous flutters gnawing at her stomach.
“Normally, sir, I would say no, but given ma’am’s physical condition has deteriorated, I believe extenuating circumstances allow me to classify any such order as pursuant to my secondary protocols, ensuring ma’am’s wellbeing.”
qualifier on “treatment” a floor away and through shatterproof glass. It makes him antsy, unsettled, to know that things have been glossed over for his benefit. He settles for closing his eyes and focusing on his coffee. The taste, the smell, the heat. The curve of the cup in his hand. The nearly-silent slurp as he sips it. Tries to ignore the tremor in his hand, the sour taste in the back of his throat.
But Toni’s alone inside, like he’s seen her a dozen times, barefoot and wearing ratty old jeans and a black tee-shirt, safety goggles pushed to the top of her head. She’s hunched over the central work table, feet tapping rhythmically on the rungs of her stool, surrounded by the glow of her holographic screens.
Remembers putting the pencil to the pages carefully laid out on velvet under glass, remembers each and every sketch. Late at night, by candlelight, on the front, in hotel rooms on the bonds tour.
She doesn’t do romance and love and expressions of affection. She prefers loyalty and respect, devotion to hard-forged bonds. Still, she knows that, if it were at all possible to force it into existence, she’d already have given Clint Toni’s mark, be wearing Toni’s mark herself, and have her comfortable partnership with Clint a full-blown metaphysical triad instead.
shit, and recently. Her face is hollow in that way that suggests it used to be rounder, more full. Crinkles at the corner of washed-out blue eyes, lines of laughter turned to lines of pain. The dark shadows beneath smoothed and dulled by concealer, but Toni’s hidden enough of her own sleep-deprived bags to know the signs. Toni’s eyes flick down briefly. Clothing just a touch too big, suggesting rapid weight loss. Her legs in an awkward, unnatural stance, white-knuckled grip on the handle of of a cane.
She pulls the blade out of the forge and sets it on the anvil. Her shoulders have passed beyond sore, have settled into a dull throbbing set of knots that will require a tub of Icy Hot and a professional masseuse to wrestle out when all's said and done, but she picks up the hammer and starts swinging.
. So there’s all that shit, and Stane swore up and down that he’d find out who’d been dealing Stark weapons under the table. Turns out it was him. I mean, neither of us liked him. He was an asshole beyond the capabilities of just about anyone. An asshole and a goddamn bully.  He sold Toni out to the Ten Rings to get his fat fucking hands on the company. You know how Toni found out?”
“A day or so,” she says. “Coulson asked me to try and recruit an expert in biochemistry and the various incarnations of the supersoldier project in particular, to help Simmons decipher the Hydra files. Is Toni in the machine yet?”
“It's meant to be integrated under layers of reinforced Starkweave with your uniform,” Toni says, trotting back to him and reaching out to undo the bindings. “Which is almost ready, actually. Fabrication sent word that the preliminary work is done. They need a fitting to make adjustments, and then it’s finished.”
“Good.” Almost before she can do more than think about it, the suit starts shifting around her, the subtle alignment corrections that allow for offensive, tactical maneuvering and weapons use. “You sure I can’t run away with the armor? God, she’s handling like a dream.”
“I don’t want to fuckin’ see you text-fucking him,” Bucky snaps. “I got enough of that by accident. Not really interested in seeing it on purpose.”
Steve follows the nurse through the corridor, though he’s not sure why. There’s a pleasant haze over his thoughts, an urge to be compliant, that’s vaguely unsettling deep down where a mutinous little voice is still yelling at him to wake up. He wants to know where they’re going, but can’t find the desire to ask. He’ll find out soon enough.
Tony puts a hand on the wall, leaning heavily on it as he clutches his chest and reins in his hyperventilation before his head starts swimming. “Hey Cap,” he says, breathless and voice twitching with the kind of laughter that comes in the sagging relief of not being killed after a really good scare. “Been taking lessons on how to scare the bejesus out of old friends from Widow while I’ve been unconscious? Cos damn, you’re pretty good at it.”
They make it half a dozen steps across the room when music suddenly blares, loud and strident. She shrieks in surprise, and Bucky twists and drops her. By reflex, she lands fist-down, the Iron Maiden classic three-point crouch, and muscle memory whips her hands up, palms out,in a firing stance. Somehow, despite dodging the other way from where he dropped her, Bucky’s managed to get halfway in front of her, like a human shield, eyes wild, knife out, every muscle a tense coil of predatory instinct.
“It is,” he insists, and pins her hand under his. “You think Stevie’d begrudge you this? You two are the biggest fuckin’ idiots I know. Knew.” Swallows. Voice is getting slurred now, a pleasant numbing tingle spreading where stabbing and burning had before.  “Shit. You both fight and fight and fight, but once someone’s past your walls, there’s nothing you wouldn’t do for them. Touch the fucking mark, Toni. Have at least that much of him. I don’t mind, and neither would he.”
sore from forging, actually making a soft noise of pleased surprise when she pulls out the escrima sticks and finds the button that charges them with fifty thousand volts of electricity.
- PTSD, anxiety attacks, polyamory negotiations, a partial breakdown that's been a long, long time coming. Friends telling each other harsh truths. There is angst in this chapter.
Finally, the door of the room JARVIS wants her to hide in looms in front of her, and she stumbles through it. Her head is splitting, trying to fly off her shoulders, and bile surges in the back of her throat. She slams the door almost before the Winter Soldier is through, and locks it. Her throat spasms, and she scrabbles at her releases. “J, let me out,” she says thickly.
Tony cracks the bottle top, smirks and drains half the bottle in a long gulp. “I didn't notice,” he replies, replacing the cap. “I usually have armor on or near me. Isn't that a thing everyone does in our line of work?”
Tony’s heart aches to see the sparkle dim. “But the internet is forever, huh?” That’s a feeling he knows all too well.
“Someone’s been seriously fucking with your head, Rogers. As far as I know, Peggy Carter is alive and fucking well at the ripe old age of ninety-seven in a nursing home in Cambridge, England,” she snaps. “No one’s killed her. You were never married. She married some guy named Gabriel back in the fifties.”
“... hotel sucks,” she rasps, and her eyes drift closed again. “Bed’s flat. Room s’rvice sucks. Gimme m’money back.”
Fitz looks a little dazed, blood trickling down his cheek from where the goon punched him, and Simmons is supporting him with her arm around his waist. “That was really…” He licks his lips, tries to focus. “That was really cool.”
“Mmmph.” With effort, she raises her head so she can look him in the eye. “What’re we doing out here, Steve?” she says, husky and deep, and a thrill shoots through her at the way his eyes darken. “There’s a perfectly good bed inside.”
For the record: I am polyamorous myself. I attempted to write in a poly-realistic manner, as I perceive it to be. In a universe with multiple soulmates possible, poly kinda goes with the territory. Things get terribly blown out of proportion really easily without communication, though. They really, really do.
“Good morning, J,” she says, scrubbing another round of shampoo through her hair because she can still smell the smoke from the burning van. “That took longer than I expected it would. Did you run into any problems during the installation?”
“Repair the most critical sections first,” he says, and uses his finger and thumb to zoom into a still shot from the security feeds: Tony, closed eyes brighter than they were a minute prior, and a faintly visible phoenix anima glowing around him. “And send the best we have after Tony. If he’s become a Phoenix host, we need to retrieve him quickly and quietly before we have a riot situation on our hands. The world doesn’t need a reminder — or god forbid a repeat — of the Phoenix Five.”
“I… I don’t know, Commander. We’re still compiling a damage report. The med lab is in the center of the widest level, though, for security reasons. So… approximately half the bulkheads on this floor?”
He doesn’t move except to straighten his posture from where she drops him, and just sits there, staring up at her with a hollow-eyed intensity that sends chills racing down her spine. “You’ll be taken. You have high value as a target. Iron Maiden, Stark Industries, Stark Solutions. One soulmate, of high value due to his unique skillset. Through you, he may be controlled.”
“Good. That simplifies things. Their other offensives won’t pose a problem to the suit. They'll turn off the interstate soon, onto a smaller highway. There should be significantly less traffic.” He doesn’t say the words
“Aw, shit. I knew there was something I was forgetting to give you.” She wiggles out of his lap, goes over to the table where she left her briefcase and thumbs the biometric lock. She comes back and plops back down in his lap and breaks the seal on the manilla envelope with her thumb. “I kinda took care of all that too,” she mumbles. “It’s been done for weeks, just… there wasn’t a good moment to give it to you.”
"I don't think I ordered any more flowers," Tony teased. It caused Bucky to blush, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly.
He was faced with a deadly evil, feline gaze from the red-headed spy who was smiling proudly at herself for catching her latest prey...
Tony suddenly became very nervous once he reached his car's trunk. His palms felt too sweaty now, but he didn't let it show through his bravado. He had to keep it neutral.
The only option was to make an appointment with Dr Stephen Strange, since Dr Cho was overseas mentoring a handful of Brazilian apprentices.
"No, no, it's okay. Hey, it's okay," Tony chuckled, "I'd be lying, myself, if I said there wasn't an ulterior motive to have me looking at your baby right here." Tony tapped the hood with his knuckle.
They could already hear Clint's bickering as they turned the corner, and soon saw Bruce already shaking his head in defeat while the archer attempted to correct Thor on his mixed-up pop-culture terms.
"Then I won't take that privilege away," Tony murmured, his tone serious; his eyes deep and sincere. Steve's heart leapt.
some reassurance that, in between what was going on, maybe… maybe he still found it in him to… to stop and still remember that I loved him. And that he... loved me." The mechanic drooped his head, willing the tears to remain at bay.
"Tony could use some help bandaging his wounds," she said into the silence, "You saw how his suit was shredded in battle; the bots even tore through his undersuit. The cuts are pretty bad."
He stops to think about it for a minute. He wants to -- God, he wants to -- but he probably shouldn’t. He mulls it over as he gets another bottle of water out of the refrigerator against the wall, is still thinking when he finishes the bottle. “Not sure that’s a good idea,” he mutters.
“No,” he gets out through clenched teeth. “Spent too much time under. Bad enough I let you stick a paralytic in me.”
Rhodey’s hiss is vicious and horrified, and he turns to face her with fluttering hands and apologetic tones, shooting Toni his dirtiest look as he does so. “Carol, honey, I’m so sorry. I should have warned you that Toni doesn’t really stop to think about what she’s saying before she
Panic sets in fast and hard, and he’s on his feet in a heartbeat, wildly looking around for a ship, an alien, hell, even a red-suited witch, to explain his current situation. Useless instinct has him holding his breath in a desperate attempt to not suffocate which he knows is utterly ridiculous because he doesn’t know how long he’s been up here unconscious, but however long it was, he had to have been breathing the whole time.
“Cagey bastard,” Toni says, amused and accusatory, and tosses back the rest of her coffee. “Sure. No promises, but talk yourself blue while I work. I won’t mind the noise.”
“Y’r bein’ rude, Clint.” Toni’s voice is less angry, but just as dark and possessive, hoarse and ruined and lust-drunk. Her hands roam Bucky’s shoulders, rake over his skin. “Go ‘way. M’busy.”
She can tell him down to the hour, the minute, the second, because her mind seizes on numbers and doesn’t easily let go, but she makes a show of counting. “God, let’s see… it’s April so… five and a half years? Six and a half years?” She flashes him a self-deprecating smile. “We don’t really pay so much attention to anniversaries and dates and stuff like that. We just celebrate life in general.”
“You don’t,” Tony snaps, and his headache spikes again as loud, belligerent thoughts crash like tidal waves against his laughable mental shields. Fucking hell, how do telepaths
“Most people just refer to us as FitzSimmons,” Simmons offers with a friendly smile. “We’ve been partners and best friends since the Academy.”
He’s silent as he watches Tony pace around the laboratory where Steve had him moved after that Capitol business all those months ago. He kinda hates to admit it, but there’s something fluid, focused and attractive about the absolute attention Tony pays each piece in the lab, from the destroyed pod with its petal-curled, jagged-edged, bowed-out door panels, to the filing cabinet by the work table that contains only extra office supplies.
Toni lets a stream of epithets fly as two of the remaining drones strafe her, rounds pinging off the legs and back of her armor. She spins left, wild and wide, dropping like a stone as she rights herself vertical and fires on the rightmost drone. The repulsors score a direct hit on its undercarriage. Its mechanics whine, high-pitched and distressed, before crashing into its undamaged partner.
“Toni?” he whispers, hoarse and huge-eyed, and his hands fist at his side until his nails are biting into his palm and the sound of metallic stress is all he can hear.
He jerks away from her, spins on a heel, feeling like he’s careening towards a cliff and the brakes are gone. “You utter, fuckin’ stupid goddamn moron,” he snarls, angry and vicious. “Do you even realize what you just fuckin’ did? I’m never going to be myself. I’m fucking
Captain, if you’re going to lie through your teeth right in my face, at least have the common goddamn courtesy to make it believable.”
The door opens behind her. “Hey, birthday girl,” Rhodey says cheerfully. “I thought we agreed after ‘01 that you were never going to lock yourself in the workshop on your birthday again.”
“In your current condition, you will be unable to fight for any sustainable length of time, ma’am,” JARVIS says, “and your… companion is an uncertain element, due to the Hydra conditioning to which he’s been subjected. Your best option is to--”
He keeps going, scratches his cheek, looks smugly satisfied with her reaction. “Morgan knows how to listen to and take the advice of someone who’s been with the business for twenty years, Toni,” he says, as if explaining to a child. “He’ll do what I tell him to do. Now fix yourself up and get outside. The ceremony is going to start soon.”
Yeah, so. Cliffhanger. I know. At 5000 words, it was pretty well the best place I could have ended it. :)
Toni eases up with the boot repulsors as the squat, ugly, abandoned-looking outpost appears, reducing thrust until she’s directly in front of the rusty door, and hovers in midair for a moment. There are two guards stationed in sight. One patrols the top, the other stands beside the door. “Nah. Not really in the mood for AC/DC right now. I’m feeling…
“Right. So. I thought she was fucking dead, man. She was in a bad, bad way. Every bit of body fat, every single curve, and a lot of her muscle tone was just
Until he hears, very clearly, Parker say, “Cap’s usually right, at least a little. Our community has been through too much in the last few years. We need to hear his side before we can make any decisions.”
“Basic operations are functioning acceptably,” JARVIS replies. “Shall I begin the higher function diagnostics?”
She shrugs and smiles. “We wanted to be here, darling. Knowing how to take care of ourselves won’t hurt a bit.”
“I love you too,” Toni says, quiet and amused, sets her cup on the table behind them, and turns to wind both arms around him, her eyes knowing, but bright and happy. “It’d be nice to stay out here forever,” she continues, and her palm smooths over the place their blended mark used to be. “But you’re right. It’s almost time to go back. Not the least because I’m pretty sure Pepper will personally drag me back to be Toni Stark, Media Darling and All Around Genius. The launch of the new Starkpad is in a few weeks. Pretty sure she’s gonna make me adult for that.”
but hesitates. JARVIS is his own man, this should be his decision. “What do you think, J? Do you want to integrate them?”
and that…” Her voice breaks and her hands fist tight in the material of his shirt at his waist, and he holds her as she sobs into his chest.
“Thrift store. Restuffed and re-upholstered it myself. Unique one-of-a-kind Hawkeye original. You can have it for a million dollars. Why are you here?”
“New assignment, got stationed back here a few months ago,” Coulson says. “I just haven’t had a chance to drop by and say hello.”
I’d say a shower, but I doubt your legs are up to standing for very long.” Her nose wrinkles. “Barnes isn’t the only one who smells like a swamp. And the heat will do those bruises good.”
Hogan takes the paper and squints at the printing, lifting his sunglasses to do so. Steve flushes a little, because his mother and the nuns at the orphanage had despaired, and rightly so, of curing his chicken scratch penmanship. “Oh! Yeah, I know where that is, Captain.” He hands the slip back and puts the car in reverse, backing out of his parking spot. “Toni's loves their stuff. Mr. Barton used to commission pieces all the—” Hogan's mouth snaps shut so fast, Steve hears his teeth click. “Shit, sorry, Captain. I didn't mean to say that.”
“J,” she says as she turns away and moves towards the door. “As soon as I’m out, lock it down. Seal everything. I don’t care what it takes, you keep them safe. If it looks like they need it, let them access armory specs and prototypes.”
Toni scoffs into her mug, realizes it’s empty, grumpily slides off Clint’s lap to go get a fresh cup. “Aunt Anna and Howard didn’t get along,” she says over her shoulder as she drains the pot into her mug. “In the way that a falling nuclear warhead and the ground don’t get along.”
It takes immense effort, but he does so. Toni’s blurry above him, bloodless-pale and terrified. “That’s it,” she says with a trembling smile, one hand holding his to her cheek, her other shoved tightly into their soulmark. His anchor. “Tell me about him, huh? C’mon. Tell me about Steve, Bucky.”
not in the mood, Barnes,” Toni says in the silence after the music stops, and swipes the video she’s watching backwards.
He doesn’t slow down at all until he’s halfway back to Manhattan, and he only does that long enough to consider his options. He doesn't have many. He might not have
He has knives now, wickedly curved kukris from one of Natasha’s many hidden caches. They’re not fighting to kill, he realizes quickly, the first time he is tagged by a shot from one of their guns and has to pull a trank dart out of his body. It dug into a scratch in his metal arm, a lucky shot that means he doesn’t have to shake off wooziness as his system tries to process sedatives. But that’s their disadvantage. They don’t want to kill him. They want him alive.
“Yes, I want to run the program,” she snaps, jabbing the appropriate key and hissing as her fingers rub a little too hard at her head. There’s a wet spot there, which is never good. She pulls her fingers away, half-expecting to see blood, but blinking at the black smear present instead. She sniffs her fingers cautiously, then stares down at the small pool of motor oil that is inexplicably staining the floor under her desk. “How the hell did that get there? Christ, I need a maid.”
Steve ducks his head, trying not to hunch his shoulders in discomfort. No matter how many times Toni explains it, or how many times Natasha mocks him for it, it’s disconcertingly like speaking to a ghost, a little too much for his liking. “I was wondering if you had any record of the project I told Toni I’d help her with,” he says awkwardly, and chooses to focus on his aimless linework in order to avoid searching the ceiling for the hidden speakers. “I didn’t get many details out of her before she fell asleep, and I don’t really know where to start.”
The staccato of footsteps coming down the hall turns him around, in time to see Toni emerge from the hallway with a suitcase in hand, tinted glasses pushed carelessly into her hair, looking so young and uncertain Steve has the overwhelming urge to enfold her in his arms and keep her safe from everything he suddenly knows is in her future.
“Of course, sir.” JARVIS, ever unruffled, doesn’t even hesitate before he continues with, “You have been tagged over six thousand times alongside mentions of Captain Rogers genitalia. What would you like done with—“
Thinks again of Peggy’s ruined face. Thinks of Bucky, and everything Iron Man is probably doing to him, torture and experimentation, inside that tower.
Dusty rose began to blush onto Tony's cheeks as Steve remained seated and stunned. His heart beat erratically; his eyes wide.
"You may think of yourself as a mess, but you're my mess now, and I'm nothing if not an organised person."
Every bit of sadness, every bit of hope and every bit of love weaved its way between their hearts and their bodies as they moved closer together... their lips never breaking apart; their hands memorizing each other's bodies as if they'd both disappear within seconds!
Steve was crying too. He was sobbing waterfalls and he let his salty tears mix in with Tony's as their kiss wove its own apology that the words could not.
“Steve,” Bucky’s thin voice was the only sound to break through in the room as he tried to bring Steve’s attention to the situation.
trust Steve not to pull anything, but Tony still couldn't quite as easily shake that hesitant (panick-y) edge off.
"With what proof?" he asked incredulously, throwing his arms in the air, "He covers up his tracks well enough. Look, Steve, all I want is a good night's sleep not worrying about my father, and just lying next to the only one in this world who doesn't make me feel like trash."
To add to that happiness, Tony couldn't help but smile, his eyes still closed, as he heard Steve's voice join in to sing along with the next lyric:
Steve wrestled with the vending machine down the corridor, letting out all of his frustration out onto a simple machine who wouldn't give up a pack of cashews.
They were all still relaxing in Natasha's living room. Eating snacks and enjoying each other's presence.
“Only you have my love,” he cried deeply, “Only you, Tony. Only you… Only your eyes will I see… every night before I sleep. Only your laugh is the sweetest sound. And only your heart has mine… even after it stops beating.”
“Mmnf, yeah Buck?” the alpha moaned in ecstasy. He loosely untangled his limbs from Barnes and stretched out his limbs lazily.
A battle with Dr Doom and his bots was never a delightful mission. It left the team pretty annoyed and tired for the most part.
“There-there was too much light-lightning,” Tony cried, “And it-it was scary- the thunder. A-and Howard never-he never let me sleep with-with Mommy. And I- Just kept hearing him say over and over,
She sat him safely on the couch and went to check on the coffee in the kitchen. Thankfully, since F.R.I.D.A.Y alerted her ten minutes before the time that Tony would be coming by, his coffee was basically finished brewing.
observation skills, I'd like to compliment yours… What gave it away first that I'm a first-time racer?"
"Wh-what's with the-the eyes, huh?" the brunette shivered, his voice wavering as he tried not to let his cries overflow, "Can- can't a guy c-come s-s-see his fe-fe-fella?"
"Hi, I'm Tony," he said cheerfully, wiping his hands over his jeans, "I'd, uh, love to shake your hand, but I doubt grease would be a good look on you."
A lazy smile appeared on his face as Tony found himself floating. He floated amongst the clouds. It all felt so soft and safe. Natasha’s summer scent cocooned him in the warm rays of the sun as he floated on cotton. Tony was drifting away, waiting for the stars.
He grabbed the back of Steve's head and forced Steve's gaze to lock with his. Tony absent-mindedly found himself playing with the hairs at the nape of the soldier's neck.
"No, it's just… Nat, I had a cake planned for you! I wanted to bake it myself to apologize for being a mess during my heat. And now, I didn't have a chance."
Bucky's voice drifted off, too ashamed to speak the words. Tony's face was unreadable as he looked off to the side. Sighing, he didn't face Bucky as he spoke.
“No, I just said that by tomorrow, Tony would’ve made something grand and beautiful for Nat, to make it up to her,” Rhodey replied calmly.
No late-night cuddles on the couch, wrapped up in each other’s warmth. No lounging late in bed as they watched sappy rom-coms. And no sweet, little moments of feeding each other bites of their breakfast in the mornings.
“I love you,” Tony whispered, gazing into Steve’s eyes. The warm, brown colour hypnotic in the night.
," Nat whispered softly, "You don't have to be sorry--it's only natural to miss Daddy. I know I miss Uncle Bucky too, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate you any less," she pecked another kiss to Tony's cheek, stroking his little back reassuringly, "I always have
careful with that giving attitude there, Steven, because a first time racer like you can't really trust just anybody to get too close to his car," Tony grinned, flashing pearl-white teeth that made him look completely dashing. Steve's stomach flipped once again.
"MY GOOD FRIEND, ANTHONY! We have all come bearing gifts, and food of garbage, in order to partake in the Midgardian tradition of swearing ultimate
Making his way to the checkout, Tony turned to his side to get out his card. So he couldn’t see the oncoming-
Tony had become lost. And Nat was terribly frightened that Steve would be the only option to make him better.
He shrugs. “You shouldn’t have to change who you are for me. He, they make you happy. Who’m I to get in the way of that? I’m not threatened, not anymore, anyway. Either I trust you, or I’m an insecure jackass. Kinda tired of being the last one.”
“She places high value on the bringers of caffeine,” Paula replies, and the corners of her eyes crinkle in amusement. “You should see the disgustingly large salaries the workers in the cafe on Forty-Six receive. Coffee will
She should be enraged that another person has such a hold on her soulmate, and if it were any other person but Toni Stark, she would be. Any other person but Toni Stark, and Natasha would creep quietly into their room in the dead of night and slit their throat. She is cold and practical, and no one who wounds Clint, who drives Clint into the depths of near-panic, deserves to keep breathing.
She takes a long breath, and then another. She nods without raising her head. “Okay, Tony. I can’t say I’m going to believe whatever it is you’re going to tell me, but I’m listening.”
“I’m going to donate you to a community college as soon as we get back stateside, JARVIS,” Toni mutters, moving along the stairs and down a deserted hallway until finding the door to the armory closed. She peers through the narrow window, seeing crates and ammo cans, some labeled STARK INDUSTRIES, some labeled HAMMERTECH. Toni is insulted on principle. Under no circumstances should HammerTech be allowed in the same room as her stuff. It’s just déclassé. “Maybe even a child care center. Busy Bee or Honey Bear or Little Flowers on Penguins. Something saccharine like that. You can entertain snot-nosed brats for the rest of forever,
“I know she can. She’s the strongest fucking person I know, living or dead. I know she can handle it. But see, here’s my problem: she shouldn’t have to! Christ on a fucking cracker. You don’t understand. You really don’t understand.”
“I still don’t understand why he had to go shopping,” Toni grumbles, flexing her fingers in a wave, and watching the light play off the metal of her gauntlets. “The cupboards are still full of food. I checked. Even with my increased intake, we shouldn’t be low on
Clint sprawls back against the couch, tucking his arms under his head. “Yeah, but you didn’t. You asked for help, you reached out to Coulson. I probably know better’n anyone how many people have burned you, Toni, so I’m just fucking proud of you. And so is Nat.” He closes his eyes, flops a hand around until he finds an edge of the blanket she discarded, and drags it over himself. “Me and Nat’ll work you into our team. I’ve been meaning to try some more aerial maneuvers in combat. Hard to do that without someone who can fly.”
to him. He’s not wired for this shit. He’s not meant to be a leader. He’s the guy who follows right behind the leader. The lieutenant. Damned good at making sure shit gets done, but not the guy who comes up with the plans.
“Shoulda hired me as your kept man,” he says, shifting into a more aggressive stance. “I’m much more agreeable when nudity is involved.”
Miles. Miles Morales. Standing, terrified but defiant of Ulysses’ visions, on the steps of the Capitol. Steve facing him, with the kind of perfect, patient faith only Captain America can display, confident Ulysses is wrong.
There's a very tiny voice, deep down inside, still howling at him to stop what he's doing and run away.
The rest of the session passes in blessed silence, even though Steve can feel the weight of her knowing gaze the entire time no matter how attentively he stares at the pages on his lap.
She chuckles, leans up and kisses his cheek, then hunches back down where it's warm. “You say the sweetest things, Rhodey.”
. It slots in place, and the picture clarifies into crystal sharpness that momentarily takes his breath in a way that running doesn’t. His legs eat up the distance she put between them, and he falls into step with her again, hooks a finger to pull the bud out of her ear as he does so. “How fast d’you think you can run, Toni?”
“Jesus, Bucky.” It’s less a curse and more of a prayer as it leaves her mouth, and the bond between them wakes with deep, solid emotion. “We don’t have time to do anything,” she groans, but her hands are skimming under the hem of his shirt anyway, pressing firm and warm against his abdomen and hips, nails digging in until he’s hissing and grinding into her, skating up to trace his mark under the cloth. Swallows his moan with her mouth.  ”Coulson’s going to be here soon. We have a meeting.”
“Captain Rogers and sir are indeed good for you,” JARVIS says dryly, “if at the age of thirty-two you have finally learned the fine art of patience.”
She has the world’s longest shower, with two rounds of shampooing, and finds clothing that hasn’t been worn for days at a time which, to her at this point, is a goddamn novelty. It takes her three tries to walk out the door of the penthouse suite, because she really doesn’t want to have to look anyone in the eye. Sometimes, she wishes she had a broader streak of cowardice than she did personal responsibility.
He blinks in surprise. “Oh. Okay then, let me back up.” He opens his mouth, then closes it again. “Actually, let me start with pants.” He fishes around his side of the bed, comes back with his jeans, and slides off the bed to put them on. Toni ignores the way her mouth goes dry even though she privately thinks his ass needs to be registered as a weapon of mass distraction.
He learns about Toni Stark purely by accident, but can’t get the name out of his mind once it’s gotten a toehold into his thoughts. Howard Stark hadn’t been a close friend -- he’d barely known the guy, if he’s being honest -- but he’s something Steve can grab onto, clutch like a lifeline to his past. Toni’s been raised by people he knows. Knew. People he
Once they return with the list of equipment Tony gave them to liberate, and Tony’s set up a makeshift workshop in Clint’s spare bedroom, data is sifted, sorted, streamlined, sourced and sequenced (and occasionally supplemented with more midnight archer raids for more miscellaneous storage devices).
“She didn’t, no. I thought JARVIS hired her car service. I hope I’m not taking you away from your real job.”
He’s sitting in the boardroom, in yet another interminably boring meeting with Coulson, trying to keep his eyes from crossing. He absolutely does not begrudge Steve and Toni having their time out in Malibu, because if two people
The relief he feels at that is pathetic and overwhelming, but he’ll take it. He’ll take it, and get through this appointment, and the worst will be over. Clint’s just trying to help, and he knows that, no matter how much Clint’s particular brand of help makes him want to punch Clint through a wall. By the time he’s ready to call the session to an end, he’s got enough on paper, just like with Natasha, to finish later. It’s not his best work, but it’ll do.
“Thanks,” she says mechanically, but has already stopped really paying attention because the bulk of her formidable brain power is occupied trying to wrap itself around the notion that
In the meantime, I hope the absolute tooth-rotting fluff and flirting in this chapter will tide you over just a little while longer.
Bucky puts his tablet down as Steve moves past into the kitchen. “So talking to Toni went well then, I take it?” he calls after Steve, and is rewarded by the sound of a door slamming further in the suite. Bucky isn’t sure when it happened, but somewhere along the line, he became the functional adult in this fucked-up back and forth. the three of them seem have have sunken into. He slides his head between his palms, locking his fingers on the back of his neck, and just breathes for a few moments. Then he sighs and scrubs his face. “Okay,” he says softly. “Alright. I’ve had it. Goddammit, enough is enough.”
Steve still isn't sure how he feels about all that, about Toni's...proclivities and her ongoing relationships, he's still stuck on processing their completed soulbond after all, but he's pleased to discover that the abrupt, unexpected reminder doesn't upset him in the slightest. “It's fine, Mr. Hogan,” he says. “Clint is a friend.”
more that he made almost everyone around him utterly miserable at every waking moment. The old bastard gets one more day in which he’s the cause of discomfort and suffering, however minor it might be. Toni imagines he’s staring up from his VIP box seats in Satan’s amphitheater, smirking at the mourners with their umbrellas and rain bonnets and dripping jackets.
Toni glances up at the observation area, but no one’s visible. With a sigh, she slumps, rubs her temples. The nanites are doing their work, but her whole body is a mess of dull aches and fiery itching. “I do a lot of things more or less constantly, Pep,” she says tiredly. “Would you mind narrowing it down a little?”
Tony shakes his head slowly, and despite himself, his heart really goes out to her. Despite her mind-bogglingly immense power potential, Kobik’s a kid, and a very young one at that. He isn’t going to allow her to run rampant over anyone’s free will anymore, but that doesn’t change his certainty that she really doesn’t know what she’s doing with any level of consequence.
Toni blinks as she sheds her clothing and steps into the shower. “That’s… thoughtful,” she says, tipping her head under the spray to wet her hair.
“Certainly, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS replies pleasantly and immediately, everywhere and nowhere at once. “What may I help you with?”
The HUD begins streaming data, lines of code flickering almost faster than she can follow. She keeps an eye on it as she shifts her focus to the fine motor stuff, checking the flexibility of the finger joints and the gestures they afford her. Christ almighty, this alloy is amazing. Even with only a three percent blend of vibranium, it’s outperforming all of its predecessors, and she hasn’t even left the ground yet.
She cuts her boot jets a dozen feet up and lands in her usual crouch, letting the helmet flow back from her face as she straightens. In the armor, she’s the same height as he is, and there’s something surreal and more than a little amazing to be looking him straight in the eye. She swallows hard, smiling faintly. “Captain,” she says, grave and respectful.
“I made myself clear. Barnes understood. Rogers was busy bleeding, so who knows? I’m sure Bucky’ll explain it to him if he needs a reminder.”
And he stares at it for a long time, touches it gingerly, traces the lines. Almost forgets Rhodey in the process of not wanting to recognize what he’s seeing. “Okay,” he says, disbelieving and incredulous. “What the
Comes back to himself an indeterminate amount of time later, trussed up with heavy cuffs and rope, in the back of a van that’s moving at highway speeds. There’s a bald man wearing a neat, three-piece suit and glasses sitting on a bench near the front, behind the two bucket seats. Two more of those black-clad fuckers are between him and Baldy, holding white poles.
Panic hammers suddenly under Bucky’s soulmark, and there's nothing but cold fury under the white star.
And, just as importantly, they're geared. They're armed. They're armored. She hadn't meant to fall down the hole and drift into unstable territory, hadn't meant to insult and offend any of them. The minute they have information, they can go without needing to worry about upgrades or repairs.
Toni untangles her hands from the blanket, letting it slide away from her arms. She leans back into Bucky’s shoulder, one arm looping up and around his neck. She grasps Clint’s forearm with her other hand, and his palm is warm and tight on her arm. Feels Natasha lean forward, follow her back, foreheads still touching. “I’m thinking,” she says. “And once I’m done thinking, I’m pretty sure there’s going to be some violence.”
“Yeah?” Fond, familiar teasing. “You and what army, glowbug?” He closes the faceplate, tips her a salute, and soars off, she assumes towards the landing pad.
“Too slow, old man,” she taunts, jabbing at his gut with a one-two combination. The punches don’t hit, but she didn’t expect them to, because she wanted to force an opening. When Steve obliges by bending slightly forward, she flows into a twisting scorpion kick, and her instep cracks into his shoulder, and he staggers one step with an
“I take after my mother that way,” JARVIS says pleasantly, as the reinforced double doors on the far side of the fab-lab start sliding back. “Control towers have been notified of your non-mission flight status, ma’am. No restrictions are in place today.”
“Spoilsport,” she says with a grin. Consulting the HUD shows her position as nearly two hundred miles from the shore. While it might be time to turn back, now that she’s in international waters, it’s also time to blow shit up. “Give me some drones, J. I need to test the repulsors and the targeting system, so the trip back’s as good a time as any.” She pauses, checks the time in the corner of the HUD. “Steve back yet?”
He frowns, looking lost in thought. “You need one,” he says absently. “People are going to start to wonder about things pretty soon.” He shifts his head, glancing at her, and rolls his eyes. “Oh hell, Toni. Stop looking at me like that. I don’t want to be your soulmate. I said I
Carter looks shocked, uncertain, then indignant. “If this is how you treat your working relationship with SHIELD, Stark,” she says coldly, “then perhaps we should revisit the nature of the relationship.”
“See,” Toni says softly, “this is why I’m not going to at you for invading my privacy, for reading stuff you were never meant to see, because you have every right to see it. I wasn’t thinking, and I was very fucking inconsiderate. I broke the Poly Prime Directive, I wasn’t open in my communication, and I am so very fucking sorry, honey.”
“I know,” Toni says gently, and she leans in to kiss his forehead. His hand fists around her shirt, and she stills again, but her hand continues that steady stroke up and down his back. “You still with me?”
Director Fury stands at the window, with his hands folded behind his back. “Six weeks ago, the Stark Industries polar exploration vessel
She steps forward, leading with a straightforward strike with her left hand. It’s smoother than she has any right to expect, given how long it’s been since her last spar with Clint, but she’s still off-balance and overextended. Steve turns his shoulder backward, and she hits only air. True to his word, though, Steve doesn’t try to touch her as she slides past him, just steps back to give her space. She spins, throws a cross with her right fist, alternates in a few kicks with jabs. It’s insulting that, supersoldier or not, he’s not even really trying to dodge her. Half the time, she swears he doesn’t even move.
When he stumbles quite by accident into a tiny but serviceable chapel on a day he’s lost track of counting, he thinks he might shed a few tears of relief. He can't move for a long time, and remains standing in the doorway, hand white-knuckled in a death grip on the knob, convulsively swallowing down painful lumps of emotion until he feels like he can finally breathe again.
The worst part is that, no matter where she goes, she has Rhodey and Clint looming over her, one at either shoulder, making sure no one comes close enough to look at her funny, let alone try and grab her again.
Natasha stands at the glass wall with her arms folded, watching Clint and Bucky run the obstacle course below. Ostensibly, she’s critiquing their form, and observing the new hard-light tech in action for FitzSimmons, but in reality she keeps getting distracted from noting the glitches and areas Clint and Bucky could use some work because Clint and Bucky aren’t even remotely interested in running the course as it’s meant to be run.
She bites back the bile rising in her throat, biting her tongue so hard the taste of blood blossoms sharp and metallic in her mouth.
And because she’s her, she immediately assumes her favorite CEO position: slouched comfortably, hands folded across her stomach, feet up on the corner of the desk. It’s not as comfortable as it usually is, because Toni isn’t a CEO that comes to work in a suit and skirts and high heels - she’s more of a jeans and tee-shirt kind of girl, only wears a suit jacket over it to satisfy Pepper’s constant, fond nagging to
Peggy sits down, folds his hand in both of hers, and he does his best not to yank it out of her grip. “You are Captain America,” she says. “You’re the
Toni opens her mouth to say… she doesn’t know what she’s going to say, and then a chime from the window where JARVIS had been running the trace interrupts her. “J? What’s up?”
“Stop givin’ me perfect set ups,” he replies, coughing on a laugh and wiping his wet cheeks with his real hand.
“Nah,” Bucky says with a sudden grin. “You got a nice ass and all, but I don't think you're really my type. I'll leave Toni to fuck you sideways though, if you accept substitutions.”
Once she’s up, she stretches head to toe, yawning with enough force to make her jaw click. “Do we know how bad it is yet?”
She also does something she swore she would never do, back when she was silly enough to think that the world wasn’t stupid enough to try and take too much of her stuff at once. She leaves the decision to JARVIS, but tells him he’s free to engage his Panopticon protocols with the goal of finding Steve Rogers. JARVIS is the most advanced intelligence on the planet. He doesn’t need to sleep, or take breaks, or eat to recharge. He never gets tired, he never gets frustrated. He doesn’t make mistakes twice. He never loses focus. It takes him twenty-six minutes to infiltrate the Triskelion, and another ten minutes to infiltrate the Helicarrier.
“Buck,” Steve says thickly, and holds out the arm that isn’t wrapped around Toni, hand extended to him.
Go another direction. He’s not in red-and-gold in the fist fight. He’s in the War Machine armor. Why the hell is he in the War Machine armor?
The simple act of putting breakfast on his plate shouldn’t stall him in his tracks. He should eat food, because it’s fuel for his system, but there’s too much choice and he’s paralyzed by the sight of fruits and pancakes and bacon and breads and cereals and juices set up on the counter.
Natasha makes an indelicate sound. “It's why you should never go anywhere unarmed,” she says disapprovingly. “Your hand wouldn't twitch if you carried your knife everywhere.”
“Whatever you say, doll,” he replies with a laugh, and goes to find something appropriate to go running in.
For a moment, she keeps the mutinous look, then slowly takes her hands out of the turret schematic, and slumps. One hand flicks at the air, and the video of the STRIKE agents hanging frozen in the air screels through scenes too rapid for his eye to catch. With a quick flick and twist of her wrist, Toni stops the video, flicks her fingers to start playing it, and throws her hand up, splayed in the air.
the smirk in her voice, even if a quick glance up doesn’t see it on her face. “I don’t put on the slinky black dress for just anyone, you know.”
She knows why Obadiah is insisting on her giving some sort of speech, though. It looks good for the paparazzi. There’ll be a way for him to spin it in order to generate positive PR for the company. She knows, as sure as she knows every line of her soulmarks, that Obie is going to want her to settle down, marry someone -- probably Clint who, despite all the tabloids’ wild guesses, is practically her husband after all this time together -- and start popping out babies to carry on the Stark dynasty.
mark, glitters in the blue light. A shock of lust and something deeper, more solid, more terrifying, jolts through him. “Jesus Christ,” he says hoarsely, reverently, and has to close his eyes because seeing her sprawled out for
She sets the folders down on the table and picks up the binder. She’s already flipped through it once, but does so again now. “So he, what, wants me to be the benefactor until he can get his house in order? Cos I don’t do that, Phil. I won’t do that. If I do this, it’s my way.”
He sighs, glances over his shoulder at the still-closed door, sensing more than hearing Steve coming up the stairs in search of him. This is a conversation he'd be okay putting off indefinitely, but running from conversations with Steve has never worked out for him.  He waits until the door opens, and meets Steve's startled gaze with a smirk. “Hail Hydra,” he says, and turns back to the sunset.
“You heard me. Sorry for invading your privacy or whatever it is you’re going to yell at me for, but I just wanna know somethin’... which one of us are you jerking around, me or him?”
He retches violently, barely makes it into the bathroom and coughs up bile into the sink. He leans his head against the mirror and turns on the tap to wash it away, splashes water onto his face when he feels like he can open his eyes without the light stabbing into them.
He and Director Fury have been having two different conversations this whole time. Phil prides himself on his ability to catch the subtle cues, but Fury has apparently been leaving him in the dust since he walked through the office door. Nothing Fury has said is untrue, but there’s an underlying meaning to every word that comes out of his mouth.
how self-satisfied it is. She grinds her teeth together and her hands fist at her sides. “Big girl in a suit of armor,” he taunts, crooking his hand at her. “Take that off, and what are you? A plain old, boring-ass vanilla human.”
It sends a visceral thrill down his spine. He moves up to the underside of her jaw, brushes his lips over it. “M’sorry,” he says again.
proud of. Making it smaller, more portable, is a feat that has frustrated him since long before Toni was born. Toni’s smarter than Howard, though. It only took her a week to figure out what he was missing. Toni knows Howard can put her work to use, and Toni wants to make the world a better place, but more than that, Toni craves the recognition and credit. And Toni has learned the hard way that she cannot trust Howard at all.
Has the sudden urge to sketch something. The curve of a woman’s shoulder. The wicked smirk of a man’s mouth.  A pair of stars, one cradled within the other. A blue circle with a hollow white triangle inside.
They stare at each other for a long moment, her eyes wide, his inscrutable. Toni's breath hitches in her chest. Her heart pounds with a solid, painless thump, and warmth spreads up her neck. The itching vanishes as if it never was.
conversation was real because while she thinks it happened, she’s also pretty sure her mother is long dead), has snapped and snarled at everyone who’s approached her. Locked everyone but Bucky out of the workshop, and if she could have locked him out too, she would have.
The next text takes so long in coming Tony assumes the conversation is done and has finally poured his smoothie into his travel mug to take into the office with him.
Rhodey's got her. She's half-delirious from heat-stroke and dehydration, thin and still racked with the cold she could never properly shake, not with expired meds and filthy water. Pain's a constant ache in her chest, her hands, her legs, her belly, her head. Screams and curses in half a dozen languages still ring in her ears. Her nostrils are full of smoke and fire and wet dank rock, hot metal and battery acid, and the disturbingly delicious smell of roasting human flesh. Skin burning, peeling, cracking, searing away after days in the desert sun.
Fennhoff isn’t alone. With him is a thin, white-haired man in a grey suit and black, round glasses. They both turn as the door opens, watch him come in. Familiarity stirs beneath the placid surface of his thoughts, a nagging feeling he’s seen this man before.
“Alright, we are green,” he says and bends to pick up the shield, slide it onto the harness on his back. He pushes doubts and dissenting inner voices ruthlessly away, becomes focused and clear. He has a mission to accomplish. “Let’s get this done.”
“Stop thinking,” Natasha tells him, abruptly slamming his attention back to the here-and-now, and he blinks at her, tries not to turn beet red as he looks back down at the sketchbook in his lap and knows the tips of his ears are burning scarlet as he sketches in her artful, high-heeled pose on the barstool in the middle of the room.
She struggles half-heartedly to sit back up, but puts no serious effort into getting away. “Too much to do. I have to make lists of what I need. Gonna have to practically port the entire workshop here in order to connect your arm.”
Bucky slumps against her back again and his arms loosen, but stay around her waist. “Kay,” he mumbles.
and the pit of her stomach drops out. “Aw fuck,” she says, tears squeezing out of her eyes as she cradles her probably-broken hand inside the crushed gauntlet. “He’s got his shield back.”
), but his chest only bears a white star inside what he thinks is a martini glass. His mind recoils, rebels, screams that it's all
The repulsor blast is gentler than she remembers it ever being on her muscles, but stabs out and tagging a drone on the rear aileron. The drone’s blip on the HUD blinks as smoke erupts from its tail and falls out of formation.
They tend to forget how many hours she logs hammering and hauling heavy machinery and components in her workshop. Tend to not consider that she lives full-time with three violent, world-class assassins beyond Olympic-class in speed and strength. Tend to forget how goddamn fucking smart she is, how fast her brain tracks physics and extrapolates responses.
Toni glances up from the prototype prosthetic on the table, snaps off the mini-blowtorch and shoves her goggles to the top of her head. “Tell him I’m busy,” she says grumpily. “If he needs repairs, he can get in line, right behind my bio-engineering department. He, at least, can find his ass with both hands. They apparently cannot.”
The moment when Tony rises out of the destroyed pod like a phoenix from the ashes, eyes glowing solid gold and a disturbingly familiar emblem spread across his chest.
“Shut up, Tony,” Steve murmurs, and tilts his head down as a hand comes up to cradle the back of Tony’s head. “And just let me kiss you.”
Carol pokes Rhodey until he digs a pen out of his pocket and hands it over. “Let them protest,” she says, bending over the coffee table and scrawling her signature on the charter. “It’ll give me a great opportunity to kick over the anthill and watch them all scramble.”
when he’s at full extension. He looses, and behind them, one of the two cars starts belching smoke, its engine whining and grinding in distress. “Why is it goddamn asshole
She tsks, extending her arm upwards, repulsor port warm against her palm. “Hydra needs to institute some sort of basic firearms training,” she says, and shoots him square in the face. “You guys are worse than stormtroopers, seriously.” The guard flies back, out of sight, and Toni charges both palm ports again.
His enemies smarten up, come at him in numbers, six, eight, ten at a time. Knives slice his skin, electricity jitters through his nerves, the prick of two separate darts hit his shoulderblades. Blood sprays across his face, hot and fast and wet, his blades a silver whirl around him.
"Your information is a little spotty, Spangles,” she says, sliding into the rhythm of snark to keep herself focused. “There’s no one here by that name. Iron
Rhodey and Carol stare at her. “Can we get a recount of whatever vote elected Natasha as the training officer?” Rhodey asks plaintively. “I’d rather not get killed by a hologram three steps from my suite.”
She hits the hood of the trailing van with both boots, driving deep dents into the engine block, lets her knees flex, lets the van absorb her momentum. The van bows forward, and its driver’s eyes are comically wide behind the wheel. She launches herself sideways, flipping heels over helmet, feeling excitement and glee flicker in her chest. Not hers, James’. She lands on a foot and a knee on the side of the road, drops Sitwell into a heap, and gets busy untying James.
Toni reaches out and plucks the two cards out of Carter’s hand, runs her fingers over them, tucks them into the inner pocket of her suit jacket. “And you can also tell Fury that I want a new liaison. The one he sent me is broken.”
Steve frowns at that. He knows Toni’s had some close calls, but the way Hogan says it makes it seem like there’s more than just the handful of incidents he’s heard of. “That usually a concern, keeping her safe?”
“Very good, ma’am. A notification warning has now been set. The manufacturing process will pause in approximately four hours.”
She smiles, runs her index finger along the rim of the speaker again. “С любовью,” she says softly, and cuts the call. She flies in silence for awhile, drawing closer and closer to the Indian coast, thinking about Clint, about Toni, about soulmates in general. Privately, secretly grateful she only ever manifested the one mark, because she has never wanted to share her life that much with anyone.
“Miss Potts is here, ma’am,” JARVIS says, jolting her from her doze. “With your clothes and your coffee.”
Incredibly, her eyes open and focus on him. Hazed and in pain, she gives him a dreamy smile. “I’m … sorry…”
Carter follows her gaze, whips out a pair of latex gloves, and is slicing the package open. “This is Agent Carter,” she says, after tapping at her ear. “Stark’s behaving strangely, possible biological contaminant or mood-affecting technology in a package that was delivered here this…” She stops talking mid-sentence, staring at the two cards that spill from the envelope into her hand. “Oh,
He turns his back to the elevator as the doors close again, and walks a few paces back down the hall towards the stairs. “My appointment was early, Ms. Potts,” he says, swipes through the security door and starts down the first of twenty flights. “I didn’t think you’d be in your office at the crack of dawn.”
Her turn to hesitate, suspicion flaring hot and squinty-eyed in her chest. “JARVIS,” she says slowly, “if you cracked my seals to punish me with that godawful smell because I didn’t listen to you and test the stealth tech in the lab before I took it into the field, I swear to Turing I will break your code into itty bitty pieces and use you as the StarkPhone’s answer to Siri.”
“I’m the CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation, Rhodey,” she says archly, squinting at the seam of the artificial leg in front of her. “I’m also the Chief Robotics Officer of another multi-billion dollar corporation. Neither of which seem to be able to keep engineers and technicians who are actually
“My name is Steve Rogers,” he says slowly to the mirror, and watches his own face for whatever reactions he has. Waits for the disconnected feeling. Doesn’t get it. He nods to himself. “My birthday is July 4, 1987.” A twinge of unease at the year, not the date. He makes a mental note. “I am a captain in the US Army.” Seems to be true. “I am Captain America.” Also seems to be true. No dissonance there. “I am the successor to Chester Phillips…”
“The color of Colonel Danvers scarf is a lovely shade, ma’am,” JARVIS says blandly, and Toni cackles.
She laughs, and it hurts, and it trails off into a hiss of pain. Which then deepens into a groan as she hears the slow shuffle of someone swimming back to consciousness on the floor. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. How is he
“He seems to have developed some sort of Phoenix Force ability,” Steve continues, bland and professional, keeps himself from so much as letting an eyelash twitch when shock and a hint of fear flashes through Schmidt's eyes. “He burned his way through half of the Helicarrier and disappeared. I'm looking into the circumstances, and have prioritized resources in order to locate and retrieve Stark as quickly and quietly as possible. Once he's found—”
Time to go sideways and track down associated memories, earlier ones, that might give him some clue. He sorts through a trial, Clint’s. Right. Bruce killed himself with Clint’s hands, goddamn them both. Trying to reason with Carol, trying to make her understand what a fucking self-fulfilling prophecy is. Not helpful in the least.
He learns that Natasha will disappear into the gym with a grim look in her eye, and punch the heavy bags until her hands bleed. He learns never to try and engage her when she’s in these moods, but to make his presence known because she takes comfort in knowing that she isn’t isolated and alone.
fucking Hydra, honestly, but I had to push the year forward. You have a new social, and excellent credit. Your job history is mostly Stark Industries, but I kept the first couple of years of your service intact, just made them overseas. After that, SI’s security division. It’s what was easiest, since I own the damn place. Your taxes have been retro-filed. School records too, extrapolated from what I could find from the 40s. For all intents and purposes, James Buchanan Barnes is a real, legal, modern person.”
“Yes, ma’am,” JARVIS says. “I am receiving several error messages from the diagnostic, ma’am. Manor sensor systems are damaged in several key areas, notably the gymnasium, the den, and the kitchen.”
Maybe Clint or Natasha could steal a quinjet? Shit, no, she’s not supposed to know about their affiliation with SHIELD, and she sure as hell doesn’t want SHIELD to know about Captain Kill slung over her shoulder. She has Clint’s loyalty, she knows that, she’s had it for years. She has Natasha’s too, though that’s more recent and not as solidly built. But she doesn’t like or trust the folks who sign their
“I’ll close my eyes, cos ew, but no. Not ever again,” Clint replies from where he’s sprawled face-down on the bed beside her.
Hogan waves him off and turns the engine over. “All part of the job, sir,” he says. “Where to now? Back to the mansion?”
He has to tell the story over and over again, not because Clint doesn’t believe him, but because Clint swears it’s more entertaining than anything on the pay-per-view. The first time he brings out popcorn, Tony declares that he’s not going to talk to Clint again. Clint bets him he can’t last an hour.
“Take your time,” she says, lining up a shot on a pair of goons, and blowing them both into walls in quick succession. “Finding Steve is imp--”
He stares down at Toni, lost and pained, her battered face framed in his palms. Wishing for things that were is his wheelhouse, not hers. It stabs something in him, cracks something in him, to hear her wish for simpler times, because that has never been who she is.
Her fingers are violently shaking under his hand, clenched in a fist, but he feels them spread, slow and tentative, until they’re flat against his skin. Hears her suck in a breath, sharp through her teeth, feels warmth and exhaustion stream through him, a bone-deep chill. And then...
The blade hisses and steams as she quenches it. Reheats it. Hammers again. Quenches again. When that blade is done, she moves onto the next unshaped metal. And the next. And the next. Sometimes she looks up, and Bucky is sitting silently on a stool, watching her with dark, angry eyes. Sometimes it’s Clint, perched above her in a vent. It’s never Natasha, but Toni wouldn’t see Natasha anyway, unless Natasha wanted her to. She ignores them all, because she can’t stop. Most of the time, she’s alone.
She may not need a suit to deal with threats, but it sure as fuck is a lot easier. Toni breathes a faint sigh of relief as the armor closes around her, powering up weapons and flight systems. “You two should stay here,” she says. “JARVIS can lock the workshop down after I leave. You’ll be safe here. It’d take a tank to get through those doors.”
“Yes, Uncle Obie,” she murmurs, and is glad when he turns his back and walks away, because she isn’t able to hold back the steel-eyed glare she levels at his back. “Asshole,” she breathes, and starts finger-combing her hair to straighten it back out. “Fucking pig.”
He improvises, breaking chairs over backs and shoving heads through walls. Gets knives from the kitchen, starts cutting into throats and eyes and guts again. Wonders how many fucking people are left to kill.
“It was one time in the Trevi Fountain. And, if I may… Google did not invent captchas,” JARVIS replies, maddeningly calm, and there’s one of those fractional pauses, the ones that make Toni grind her teeth. “But you
The presentation goes surprisingly well, mostly because she doesn’t have the brain power to deviate from the cards Pepper handed her. She talks about the exciting new direction for Stark Industries, speaks glowingly about the vision and support of the board of directors, manages
“You are fucking evil,” Clint complains, sprawled across the couch in the den with an ice pack cradled to one cheek. He spears Natasha with a dark, baleful look before letting his head roll back against the cushions.
In hindsight, he really should have expected Magneto, of all people, to violently recoil from unnatural influence to serve an organization founded on the same principles and by the same general people that founded the Nazis.
“Yep. We’re good.” He rises to his full height, and Toni’s breath catches in her throat, because Steve Rogers is who she dropped to the floor, but Steve Rogers is not who gets back up. He’s minus the shield, minus the uniform, minus the cowl, but there’s a set of his shoulders, a look in his eyes, something about the way he holds himself… There is absolutely no doubt in Toni’s mind that this is Captain America in front of her now.
“Hold on,” she says through gritted teeth, and squeezes her eyes closed. “If I survive this, remind me to kill you,” she mutters, and braces for impact.
Tony hides the convulsion of his throat at how humiliated Steve sounds by turning back around and letting his hands fly over his console, saving and sweeping away his design work, pulling up his programming matrix. “I can whip someone together to help you out.”
Bucky stiffens, feels the knot of dismay and dread tighten and tangle. “Okay,” he says, stands there for another moment, trying to think of something to say. Some way to repair what he’s just fucked hideously up. He can’t. “Okay,” he repeats, then slumps and turns to leave the workshop.
“Then buddy, you got stuck with the wrong soulmates,” Toni replies, with a snort. “Cos Bucky’s just as insatiable as I am. God help you when we’re all together again, is all I’m saying.”
Everything is white and cold, and thick blue lines pulsate overhead, humming with a bone-jarring pitch that makes Tony’s back teeth ache.
“Maybe I could make the magical bodysuit into Iron Man armor,” he muses aloud as he orients himself, shields his eyes, and hopes like all hell the naproxen is still working to stave off any recurring headache-inducing events that might happen to him along the way.
Coulson opens his mouth, looking more than a little amused, but whatever he is going to say is abruptly pre-empted by a chime from JARVIS. And Toni freezes on the spot, because that sound never means good things.
Well, this was a harder chapter to write than I thought it would be. Not a whole lot of action, but other things occur, including the following:
“Hail Hydra,” Carol whispers in his ear, and that’s the only warning he has before her fist impacts the back of his head.
, open fucking heart surgery by someone without light or, you know, sterile tools, shit rations, no medicine, daily waterboarding… And she
“One can only hope it stays that way.” And if she hasn’t jinxed herself, JARVIS just did it for her. Oh well. It’s more fun this way anyway. “Shall I queue up your usual entrance music, ma’am?”
“Sounds perfect,” Simmons says, hovering over Fitz as she cleans the cut above his eye. “What if they have a tank?”
It might be irrational, because he’s seen Toni since, but always from a distance, always with glass and bodies between them. He has no idea how he’s going to react to seeing her awake and in arm’s reach.
“It helps,” Steve says with great patience, once again attempting to not break his pencil, “if you sit still.”
These fuckin’ emotional surges are getting a little old, he thinks, presses an absent kiss to her temple and breathes through the urge to bawl.
At least the nausea is gone. And the headache. Once Fennhoff increased the frequency to every two hours, started him on meditation techniques with special music designed to soothe his heightened senses, all his discomfort and uncertainty just washed away like it never was.
That’s a question Bucky would very much like answered himself. He eases himself back against the wall and leans there, not feeling the least bit sorry or guilty for eavesdropping, and waits for Clint’s response.
Blood and bodies continue to fall in his wake. Holes appear in walls, sometimes with a body still hanging out of them. Picture frames fall from walls, vases pitch off pedestals and stands.
The blue circle on his chest is half-hidden by the hem of the tank top, but there’s a red point, like the top of her star, visible. It’s a measure of how tired Toni is -- and how terrified of Natasha’s promise of “words” -- that she doesn’t spend more than ten seconds debating whether or not to just jump him where he sits. Twenty seconds, tops.
at the SHIELD report rerouted by Fury directly to him. It’s from the Joint Dark Energy Research Facility, flagged for review, observation and intervention by the Avengers Initiative and Stark Security. The report is currently tucked away in the innocent-looking folder under his hand, but Phil’s never been more aware of the flimsy facade in his life. It’s too big, sometimes.
Toni tenses. She wants to tell him no, she’ll wait in traffic because she has the awesomest boyfriend ever.
I couldn't have done this without the encouragement, support and sharp beta cheerleader skills of  Medie, JustAnotherPipeDream and SilverShadowKit, who kept me going, propped me up when I was down, and helped me dig myself out of plot holes and painted-in corners. Couldn't have done it without you.
“Okay,” Steve whispers, incredulous and wide-eyed, then jerks his attention back to Bucky, who’s on the other side of his chest, touching their double stars gently.
Blue-white flames wash over him, explode out from him, and he rises into the sky like he’s in his armor, howling as the madness boils away, distills down fine and pure, decants into a container in a corner of his mind, and fades into stillness.
Logically, he knows that the tower is not nearly as safe as it seems. It was only a week or two ago that it had been invaded by hostiles in an attack that left Toni nearly dead. He knows he needs to learn better methods of self-defense, but with his whole body a giant ache, it’s hard to want to internalize that.
“Fucking God,” Steve says shakily, and pushes his hands through his hair, holding onto his head for a moment. “How the hell is she going to be okay with all that, Bucky?”
“I’m beginning to recognize a theme to our attempts at vacationing,” Clint says, leaning just as heavily on her as she is on him.
Toni eyes him suspiciously, and he can practically hear the wheels turning in her head, trying to figure out where he’s going with this. “You’re up to something,” she says, faintly accusatory. “Even if I couldn’t feel you plotting whatever it is you’re plotting, I’ve been with Tash long enough to recognize when an innocent request is hiding some nefarious agenda.”
He can hear the music a flight of stairs up, loud and throbbing and a little more vulgar than he's really comfortable with. He knows he’s missed a lot, but he has no idea how music went from singing about love and the brassy melodies of jazz and big band to growling about violence and calling women bitches.
“Well,” Helen says, and begins to disconnect the leads trailing from the sides of the cradle to the sticky pads dotted all over Toni’s body. “You’re going to have to get used to it, I’m afraid. You need at least one every thirty minutes or so until the mass die-off hits early tomorrow morning. Human beings aren’t meant to heal this fast, Toni. The nanites need raw materials, and this is the best way to make sure you have them available.”
The hair on the back of his neck rises. Something is not fucking right. JARVIS is never unresponsive, not even in the middle of the night when no one else is awake but him. His system floods with adrenaline, senses sharpening until colors are neon bright, until he can hear the traffic out on the street as clear as if he was standing on the sidewalk. Muscles coil, feet shift. He doesn’t fight the Asset as it swims to the surface, because
She sighs and pulls the helmet back over her head, mimicking Steve’s gesture with the cowl of his uniform. “Fine,” she grumbles without any actual disgruntlement. “But if I drop you, don’t blame me. I don’t usually fly tandem.”
“Oh, it's totally your name now,” Kamala says in the sort of happy, bouncy tone that always makes Tony uneasy, because it usually means some new rabid corner of internet Avengers fans show up at the Mansion or the Tower in cosplay or with signs displaying their shipping preferences. “Don't worry, Tony. I'll make sure they know it's not a pairing name for you and Ms Grey. Or Mr. Summers either. Just leave it to me!”
The deeper he goes, the stronger his disquiet becomes. He thought the building, that Stark Industries, was a facade to cover Iron Man’s villainous operations, that the floors would play host to a variety of illegal laboratories and hideous experiments. Stockpiles of weapons. Schematics for missiles and bombs. Torture rooms.
Every single syllable hits home, her own words cutting vicious and sharp, and just for a moment, her vision hazes in red. “Oh, you’re going to regret you said that,” she snarls, and drops back into her ready stance.
He blinks, but recovers quickly. “Lola,” he says, figuring he’ll at least follow this line of conversation and see if it turns up anything beneficial. “Fully restored.”
He removes his hand from the pod, and swipes it down his face. He might have the serum back to full strength, but he still feels like he’s pushing a century in age some days. “Are you sure there’s been no sign of Phoenix Force activity?”
A text feed pops up on the right side of her HUD, a neat bullet-point list, and she scans it as JARVIS narrates. “The most common signs are increased aggressiveness, uncharacteristic behaviour patterns, anxiety, panic attacks, impulsivity, lowered inhibitions, decreased self-awareness. Rarely, some bonded pairs and triads have also reported recklessness, lowered morality, decreased objectivity, violent impulses, disconnect from empathy, unstable moods, and compulsive thoughts.”
Despite all of JARVIS’s mother-henning and disapproving silences, Toni thinks her new stealth tech’s test is going well. So far, the suit isn’t showing up on radar or sonar, radio doesn’t seem to be picking up any frequencies, and even naked-eye observation has to be particularly sharp in order to spot the shimmer giving away her outline. All in all, she’s quite satisfied with how it’s holding up.
She jerks into the present, hands rising by instinct to block or deflect an incoming blow. But it’s just Morgan, staring in agitated disbelief at the document in his hand.
The footage he found when reconstructing his first day awake was grainy and shaky in places, and he isn’t sure he has the right Helicarrier until he crests the mountain range along which it patrols and sees the damage done to the side. It’s clear repair work has been started, but he can’t have been mobile for any length of time, because the repairs are just as clearly still in the very early stages.
He holds his right hand up, and she slides the repulsor right over his fingers, adjusting the fit. A little loose, but serviceable. “Max distance, probably twenty feet,” she says, HUD’s warnings getting a little more intense with two more guns spitting bullets at them. “It kicks like a drunk mule. Point four seconds between shots, point six delay in firing response off the gauntlet. Squeeze in towards your index finger with your thumb to fire.”
Some bits blatantly lifted from Endgame. A lot of sibling dynamics. A surprise guest who totally isn't going to turn out to be Natasha. >.>
Toni doesn't hesitate to speak her mind, and it's one of the things Clint really appreciates about her. Neither one of them have patience or the appropriate brain-to-mouth filters for idiots, and sometimes there's nothing he likes better than to just sit with her and see who can come up with the snippiest one-liners. It's fun. It's challenging. It's something he can do with no one else in his life, because no one else has the snark or the weird twist to their sense of humor he and Toni do.
paperwork. Uh…I thought you needed an identity for that. I kinda... don’t think the Department of Soulmate Registration’s gonna take my social, since I got it in the forties.”
He stops mid-chew, the sweetness of the tomato suddenly tasting sour and ashy, and his fingers feel numb around the phone. Some distant voice in the back of his head is telling him that he should put the phone down now, because there is absolutely nothing good that will come from this. But that voice is drowning under the tidal wave of rage and hurt screaming through his brain.
She’s looking at him, clearly expecting one of his snarky retorts, but his mouth is dry and his brain is frozen. His lungs keep trying to stop. Slowly, the amusement fades from her eyes and the smile falls. “Bucky,” she says softly, “we don’t have to do this right now.”
To Rhodey’s credit, he doesn’t bat an eye at her dramatic declaration. He doesn't even look up from his computer. “So you’ve said,” he says absently, fingers dancing on the keys. “I’ve yet to see supporting evidence, though. Don’t you call yourself a scientist? Also, I think you’re drunk.”
But Toni… Toni had done none of that. When Clint came to kill Natasha on the orders of SHIELD, when he instead saved her, when they completed their soulbond, he had gone straight to Toni and asked for help. Asked for a place for Natasha to be safe. Asked for understanding.
“She flew in with me last night,” Helen says. “She’s here to keep an eye on you, and make sure you listen to me when I say that this process is going to use up a lot of your body’s resources, so you’re going to have to take it easy for a couple of weeks. Food, rest, all the stuff you really hate the most. Speaking of which, are you hungry? You’re probably feeling the effects already.”
Closes his mouth again, confused at the strength and command in the urge to say nothing. Wrestles with himself, needing to be clear of pain, but deeply defiant of the needle. He still hasn’t resolved the conflict when Rumlow lets a low, triumphant laugh. “Iron Patriot and Warbird just left. A quinjet followed them. We’re probably not going to get a sweeter opportunity, Captain.”
“In a normal competition,” Mary started, “This pie would be one of the bottom three, at least. Your filling is too runny and too sweet, and your dough is too thick for it to taste good.” She shook her head, and took another bite. “Still, you’ve served us with a complete and edible pie, so you’re already better than most of your teammates.”
“I didn’t do it ‘cause I’m your friend,” he huffed, trying not to let his voice tremble too much. “I did it because I love you.”
Tony shot his repulsors at random as he carried Steve in his arms, flying at practically the speed of light to get back to the Tower. Steve weighed no more than a sack of potatoes, and was just as limp, head flopping side to side as Tony flew him back.
“He does, we just didn’t think we needed to share with you.” Tony just grinned as Fury turned the full force of his one-eyed glare onto him, but luckily, Fury seemed to decide that Tony’s comment didn’t merit a reply.
The rest of the team reacted very well to Steve’s announcement of his new pet, all things considered. Clint and Thor were ecstatic, rushing forward to pet him, and rushing back just as quickly when the kitten growled at them, baring his tiny fangs in a way that was both threatening and adorable. Natasha didn’t seem interested at all, just patting Steve on the shoulder in congratulations before returning to her coffee. Bruce stayed away a little nervously, but smiled as he watched the kitten’s antics.
“Because it was weird and invasive? I promise I didn’t take any pictures of you naked and sell it to the tabloids.”
“Did you ask Tony if you could keep him?” asked Natasha, who’d finished her coffee and was now eyeing the kitten with mild amusement.
“Ah,” said Thor, waving an airy arm at him. “We on Midgard are not constrained by time. Time is never-ending and never-changing; we are nothing but slaves to time. Why shackle ourselves more than we should?”
“Tony,” said Steve, a little sadly, and before Tony could process what was happening, he was scooped up in Steve’s gigantic, warm arms, and Steve was cuddling him aggressively.
Steve was shocked, and utterly speechless. Tony had never spoken about his childhood much, and Steve had assumed growing up famous and a child prodigy wasn’t exactly the easiest of childhoods, so he’d never asked about it, out of respect for Tony’s privacy. “Howard… he never…?”
“And we all know he’s not gonna be back ‘til at least lunchtime, so you might as well drink this, Tony.”
“Fuck you, Rogers,” said Tony. He glared at Steve for a second, but then the wind seemed to blow out of his sails and he slumped against Steve, tired. “I’m sorry. I meant to say, fuck you, Stark-Rogers.”
Tony almost collapsed with the relief he felt, the tears he’d been holding back for hours, now threatening to surface. He wiped at his face angrily. “Can we see him?”
“I love the red, white and blue theme,” Mary commented, lifting a slice of pie up to look at it from every angle. “And, oh! Apple pie! An American classic.”
“D’you think I should keep him, JARVIS?” he asked, watching the kitten play with his tail on Steve’s bed.
Tony gripped his arm but instead of pulling himself up, he tugged roughly at Steve’s arm to make him fall down as well. Normally, without the suit, there was no way that Tony would’ve been able to shift Steve by so much as an inch, but Steve, caught off guard, stumbled a little and fell almost right on top of Tony.
“I can’t wait to taste it,” Mary said excitedly, quickly biting off a large mouthful. Steve barely had time to resign himself to the fact that Tony would lose, when Mary gagged, spitting Clint’s brownie into her handkerchief.
“I just… I just thought you were a good PA. That you wanted a raise or something. By being my friend.”
Steve was riding the high of their combined win, and maybe it was that, or maybe it was the way Tony was pressed against him, or maybe it was just Tony’s
“And so what if I did?” Steve’s smirk slid off his face as Tony nipped harder at his neck. “This is a competition, and I’m gonna win.”
Both Steve and Tony stared in shock at the offending black rectangle for a few seconds, completely indifferent now to the throngs of people who’d started gathering around them.Tony reached slowly for his phone, almost as if he didn’t want to see the other side of it.
“No we don’t.” Tony sighed, leaning into Steve’s chest and wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist. “We gotta change that.”
,” said Steve, his unusual confidence probably a result of the champagne. “I’m not a child, Mr.— Tony. I pay bills and do taxes and make my own doctor’s appointments,
“Today’s challenge will not be as difficult as last week’s,” Mary continued, “but, today, we’ll also have a higher standard for judging. We’re not looking for merely edible anymore; we want creativity, originality, and something that defines who you are. Today, we want you to make us one batch of your signature brownies, in any flavour and with any additions you’d like.”
“Happy birfday to me,” Tony mumbled as he followed Steve into the car. Happy winked at Steve, but wordlessly drove them back to the Stark Mansion. You didn’t work as someone’s driver and bodyguard for this long without picking up their tells.
“I found him on the street, and I couldn’t leave him there to starve,” he said simply, picking Bucky Jr. up and scratching behind his ears. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, Tony, and you can kick him out if you want to. I’ll just go with him.”
Steve didn’t have any answer to that, and the silence built up between them, tense and awkward. Vaguely, Steve realized this was the first time he and Tony had ever truly been alone together. What did you say in a situation like this?
“So does that mean I win?” asked Clint excitedly, popping into the tent with no warning. “I mean, if Steve and Tony are kicked out, and I had the third best brownies last week… I win, right?”
Steve scowled, and Tony figured he’d better come to the rescue. “Steve, honey,” he started gently, “We both know you aren’t fit enough for this mission.”
to anger management classes when you’re right here destroying private property whenever you feel even the slightest bit—”
He’d found the poor thing on his morning run, cold and starved behind one of New York City’s many huge dumpsters. It had looked up at Steve from a pile of rags, little green eyes shining in the cold, and let out a sad, plaintive mew. How was Steve supposed to ignore that?
“—but I can’t keep telling you to get over him, Tony.” She placed her hands on her hips, exasperated. “Wasn’t this the whole point of today?” Tony had the grace to look a little ashamed of himself. He really did feel like a dick for putting Pepper and Rhodey through all of this, especially when they’d tried so hard to get him this date, and with how happy they’d seemed when he agreed to it.
—until Bucky Jr. yelped and fell back onto Steve’s lap, startled awake by the loud knock on the door.
Tony kept going, blind to anything and anyone except his own pleasure. He thrusted harshly into Steve, but paused as he felt a stinging pain on his leg. He looked down to see Steve’s hand clutching at it, his nails digging into Tony’s skin, and Tony pulled his hand away immediately. Steve pulled his head away from the pillow, gasping for air.
“I must’ve been fucking exhauted to put that in,” Tony growled. “J, new command: I can override whatever the fuck I want to.”
Tony tried not to get frustrated. He’d been horny all day, staring at Steve in his oversized shirts and baggy jeans that somehow made him look sexier than when they were skin-tight. “What’s wrong, honey?”
“Peter, you know you’re not allowed to speak like that,” he said, less sternly than he would have at home.
“Peter!” said Steve, shocked, not about the swearing but from what he’d said. “What — your father and I are not getting divorced!”
had ended up buying little flowers for both of them, in blue and white to match their tuxes. All in all, when Steve was dressed up and gelled up and make-up-upped, he decided he’d never felt more uncomfortable in his life. All he wanted now was for this goddamn dance to be over.
Steve watched Tony walk away, noting the way his salt and pepper hair shone in the moving lights and how perfectly his suit hugged his figure, and felt his stomach sink sadly back down to the depths of his shoes.
“Pete, it’s freezing out there. You won’t be able to see anything through that snow!” Tony exclaimed.
Tony forced himself to push Steve out of his mind, instead fantasizing about what his date would look like. They’d spoken for a bit on the dating app, but the app itself encouraged in-person meetings more than online interaction, and Tony knew very little about this guy, except that he was new and exciting.
“We’ll need some time to decide on the winner,” said Mary, gesturing between the couple. “You’ve both done wonderfully, you deserve a break.” A smattering of giggles broke out as the judges turned away; everyone knew Steve and Tony had already had quite a wonderful ‘break’, and Mary’s comment had very clearly only been for the audience.
“I don’t trust what people put on their dating profiles,” said Tony dryly. He had to admit though, that this date seemed impressively well-qualified, so much so that Tony was pretty sure at least part of it was made up. Tony didn’t know any names, as the dating website’s rules stated, but ManWithAPlan was a military veteran, with a strong liking for both art and injured animals. He described himself as “tall and blonde”, exactly Tony’s preference, and even made it a point to state that he didn’t want children. That was the most important part of it all for Tony, given that… well…
“You feeling better, honey?” he asked, pushing his fingers harder and inserting a third one. Steve didn’t reply, but his long, drawn-out cry was enough of a response for Tony. He sat up and spit on his palm, slicking himself up. “I wish I’d brought lube, but this’ll have to do.”
“Okay, honey,” he said soothingly, offering Tony an arm. “I'm not gonna lie, that was the funniest thing I’ve seen all day, but I think we’re drawing a little too much attention to ourselves.” He tugged the hood of Tony’s hoodie harder over his face and bent to help him up, but Tony stayed on the ground, glaring at him mutinously.
“Today is all about getting your soundbites and the interviews. You’ll not need to be all dolled up when you’re baking,” Sandi smiled, and Peter raised his hand. “Yes, uh… Spider-Man?”
As if he’d heard Steve’s thoughts, Tony turned to face Steve, still smiling. “I can, and I mean this very literally,
“I think he was trying to tell you,” said Clint quickly, trying to mitigate the damage. “He just, uh, couldn’t find the opportunity.”
“You look amazing, Tony,” said Pepper warmly, standing back and admiring her work critically. “If you don’t go home with this guy tonight, I’ll eat my hat.”
He forced his attention back to his loaf, pulling it out as soon as the timer hit thirty seconds. The smell of freshly-baked bread wafted across the tent as soon as he opened the oven, the scent of a perfect bake.
Two weeks later, Steve decided he wanted to add a small amendment to that: he’d follow Tony to the ends of the Earth, as long as they didn’t make a pit stop at Homecoming.
“So we didn’t technically lose, then.'' Steve smiled, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist. “We… won together.”
“What does it fucking matter?!” Peter yelled once more, pushing his plate away and standing up from the table. “If you’re gonna get divorced, then do it and get it over with! Stop putting me in the middle of your shit!”
“What did I tell you?” Steve said sullenly as the couple watched Ty walk up to the table. A loud cheer arose as Ty signed his name on the sheet for Homecoming King, and he turned and winked at the audience like a washed-out movie star — half the girls in the crowd swooned, and one of them actually
“It’s okay, honey,” he said, petting Steve’s hair as Steve curled sadly into Tony’s chest, tired and exhausted from his orgasm and the asthma attack. “We just gotta be more careful.”
“I feel like I can’t breathe,” Tony sobbed, clutching onto Steve even tighter. “Everything here reminds me of the Ten Rings, and I don’t
Bruce held his arm up for a fist pump, which Thor duly returned, despite looking like he had no idea what had just happened.
“Sleep and rest aren’t the same thing, honey,” said Steve, kissing Tony’s hair again in an attempt to mollify him. It seemed to work, if the way Tony buried his head in Steve’s chest once more was any indication. “How about we go lie down for a bit, huh? You can have all the cuddles you want.”
“Well, I’ll need you to make this for me more often.” Steve grinned. He’d never heard Fury pay anyone a compliment before, and it was gratifying being the first person in history to receive one.
“What’s wrong with it?” asked Fury, quickly taking a curious bite. He spit it out almost as quickly as Mary, but not nearly as lady-like, his brownie landing all over the grass instead.
Noel came sprinting into the marquee, a small phone held aloft in his hand as he ran towards the judges. He came to a pause next to Steve and Tony, taking deep panting breaths.
“I owe you for the pie, Cap’n,” Tony smiled. “And I should be fine. Now, let’s see if I can slide you this baking tray without anyone noticing.”
“I’m sorry,” he said quietly, trying not to wake Peter up. “But you really did deserve better, Tony. Howard didn’t know what an amazing son he had.”
This time, it was Tony who pulled Steve in for a kiss. “Fuck,” he panted, right into Steve’s open mouth. “I’ve wanted… but I thought… I’m too old for you, Steve.”
Steve felt his heart grow by a couple of sizes as he shyly followed Tony to his regular booth. He was finally sitting down and having a drink with Tony the Barista!
“Look at me,” said Tony, raising his arms and looking himself over sadly. “I’m old and faded. Even Pepper broke up with me, and she’s closer to my age than you are to hers. You could have your pick of hot kids. Why me?”
Admittedly, it was not the best idea he’d ever had, considering Tony tasted like a combination of old alcohol and morning breath. Still, Steve Rogers was nothing if not stubborn, and he stayed pressed to Tony’s lips until the older man pulled away in shock.
“”I know, I know, you did it for both of us, but that didn’t mean it still didn’t hurt.” Steve looked up at Tony sadly. “And to be honest, Tony, I don’t think it was worth it.
“Until they cost me the best thing that’s ever come into my life,” said Steve fiercely, and really, Tony couldn't have done anything else other than kiss him.
“It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” Fury growled, but at this point, the producers of the show were eagerly nodding along, and he was forced to accept.
“Everyone else, thank you for your enthusiasm, and I hope we’ll see you here next week to cheer your teammates on.”
“I notice your blue is the same shade as Stark’s,” Fury commented mildly, taking another bite of Steve’s pie.
“Nothing except ice, maybe,” Clint sniggered, but quietened down when both Steve and Tony turned to glare at him.
“Everyone makes mistakes in the kitchen,” said Mary, patting his back gently even as she gulped down a large glass of water. “What matters is that you tried. And your execution was almost perfect.”
Steve sipped his coffee with a smile, his heart content and at peace. Sitting here outside of Stark Bookstores, he had everything he needed to keep him happy: a nice, fat, new book and a hot cup of coffee that would stay warm for at least an hour.
Steve couldn’t hear him of course, but something in Tony’s voice must have soothed him. He relaxed in Tony’s hold, his cries slowly turning into quiet moans and whimpers.
“Good,” said Steve, slamming his flute on the table like he’d seen in the movies. “Now that I can tolerate you again, I got you a birthday present.”
“And I had thought you invited us to your feast of popped corn to celebrate your union!” Thor thundered. “Was it not supposed to be so?”
Steve was the very last person to be judged, so he watched the others’ results with interest. As he’d predicted, almost nobody had managed to make a good pie, Natasha’s in fact resembling the “fruit-flavoured soup with dough croutons” that Fury had predicted more closely than it did a pie. Bruce had burnt his pie so much that even the filling had gone dry, and neither Fury nor Mary were able to cut into the blackened crust.
“I was a terrible husband and father too,” said Steve gruffly. “Tony, I’m so sorry. I should’ve… should’ve been there for you. I should’ve
.” Tony collapsed onto a pile of snow, bringing his knees up to his chest and hiding his head between them. He didn’t even care if he looked like a teenage girl right now — nobody was around to see him except Steve, and Steve had no idea what teenage girls in this century were like.
“Are you serious?” Fury barked as Steve and Tony re-entered the marquee, hand-in-hand and with identical grins on their faces. Steve looked about presentable, but Tony’s hair was a wild, sticking-out mess; anyone over the age of thirteen would’ve been able to tell what the ‘urgent Avengers business’ had been about.
seemed so… formal, for something they did in their pyjamas essentially every weekend. But this… this really was their first date, which they decided would be better than trying to face the hordes of paparazzi if they’d had their first date somewhere public. Tony was seated in front of the giant TV right now, all soft and cozy and
honeymoon, not for whatever you’ve got going on between you and your phone,” Steve hissed, slipping Tony’s phone into the deepest pocket of his jacket. “Just.. try to live in the moment a little, Tony.”
“I am going to say something that I will probably regret, but Clint and Nat and Thor convinced me, and now I have to do it or I’ll never forgive myself. And also, Natasha might maybe stab me.”
Inevitably though, Steve and Tony were soon cuddled together, trusting the thin blanket over their bodies and the pale light from the TV screen to hide them. Thirty minutes in, Steve wasn’t even watching the movie, more focused on the bright lights shining off Tony’s face, how every frame illuminated his beautiful brown eyes, and how his cheeks sparkled in the low light. He watched as Tony laughed at a particularly funny scene, admiring the multiple laugh lines in his cheeks.
“It’s scary how much I love him already,” Tony commented, gently pushing a stand of Peter’s jet—black hair away from his face. “I dunno how parents can feel like this every day. It’s… overwhelming.”
Right now, it seemed like Steve’s biggest competition was either Clint or Wanda. Clint had experience, being a stay-at-home father, but Steve was confident his pie would taste much better. Wanda had the advantage of speed, considering she was using her powers to do almost ten things at once, but Steve didn’t think much of her… flavour choices.
“This wasn’t an easy decision to make,” Mary started, “because both of you did wonderfully. Even after today, you need to be proud of what you’ve achieved, and of the fact that you’ve made it here at all.”
“It’s stupid,” said Tony, blushing a little bit, and Steve could feel his heart soften as he took in the soft red on Tony’s cheeks. “I just — I noticed you were a regular at the shop, sometimes, but I never got a chance to talk to you. And then when I saw you were here at the same time every week, I figured picking up one shift a week wouldn’t kill me.” He smiled shyly at Steve. “I’ve been working here for three months trying to pluck up the courage to talk to you. I’m an idiot, huh?”
Steve had tried to apologize, even as Tony’s words stung him. He’d pushed his hurt aside and brought Tony food the next day, his customary peace offering. Not only had Tony not let him into the workshop, he hadn’t even touched the food, letting it rot on his doorstep until Steve admitted defeat and took it away. He’d asked JARVIS to pass along messages and to tell Tony he really was sorry and that he wanted to talk, but JARVIS said Tony was in a temporary blackout and couldn't be reached. Tony really was stubborn about not talking to him, and Steve couldn't do anything about it.
Without warning, the Iron Man gauntlet flew to Tony from behind Steve. It wrapped itself around Tony’s hand in a matter of seconds, and Tony aimed it directly at Clint, who squealed and rushed into a vent. That didn’t stop Tony, who aimed small repulsor blasts at the ceiling until they heard another shrill squeal, meaning Tony had finally found his mark.
“At least you didn’t mess up as badly as Thor,” he offered, trying to be optimistic, but wilting under Tony’s glare.
“Tony?” said Steve, pulling away after a couple of minutes. Tony relaxed, laying his head on Steve’s chest and listening to the comforting rhythm of Steve’s strong, wonderful, amazing heart.
Steve grinned in spite of himself, taking Tony’s hand in his own. He kissed Tony one more time for good measure, grinning as Fury’s scowl deepened and Mary’s smile grew bigger.
Although lately, it was getting harder to justify, even to himself, that he was only looking forward to the books and the coffee.
,” said Steve again, running a hand through his sweaty hair. His voice was trembling, but he couldn’t seem to let go of Tony.
Mary and Nick looked at each other. They held their gaze for a charged second, and then, Fury seemed to give up. He nodded his head slightly.
They looked at each other and, as if by mutual consensus, trooped out of the door, patting Tony on the back and muttering quick well-wishes for Steve. Tony didn’t even wait for them to leave before he hurtled inside, cradling Steve’s hand in his own.
Almost as Tony said those words, however, Thor seemed to have taken it into his head to help them. There was a loud crack of thunder and another bolt of lightning struck the tower, the same as he had last week. Apparently, Thor didn’t trust Midgardian ovens worthy of baking for a king.
And today, he told himself, today was the day he was finally going to man up and speak to the pretty little barista.
Steve wiped his brow as he set the prepared loaf into the oven, sighing with a secret relief that this whole thing was finally over, at least. Behind him, Tony was still working on shaping his dough.
“Peter, honey,” Tony started again. “Your Dad and I are not getting divorced, okay? We’re just… going through a rough patch.”
“Okay, I think the cameras got enough, you can stop now.” Fury sounded mildly disgusted, and Steve laughed pressing one last kiss to the corner of Tony’s mouth before pulling away.
“Tony,” said Steve, looking him directly in the eyes and trying not to let his voice tremble. “Will you marry me?” He laughed, slightly choked up. “I should have prepared for this better.”
“Fuck Steve,” Tony panted, when they were outside the gates, in an area that was less crowded. “You couldn’t have stopped me?”
“I’m not gonna yell at you,” he mumbled, staring determinedly at the floor. “I don’t agree with what you did, Tony, but I guess I can understand.”
“You’re still the most beautiful person I know,” he whispered into his ear, “Even without the serum, even with all these bruises, I still want to carry you to bed and fuck you ‘til we’re both tired out.” Steve stiffened under him, probably from the pain, and Tony continued caressing him softly. Anything for his Steve.
Clint just sunk further into his arms, and Mary gave him one last pat on the back before turning to Fury. Steve, noticing the cameras were no longer trained on them, walked towards Tony, who was staring disconsolately at his brownies.
“You can pick which bedroom you want, Peter,” said Tony quietly. The log cabin, which Tony had inherited from his father, was a large, luxurious place, with everything from a central heating system to a swimming pool — not that they could use it now, in the dead of winter. There were three bedrooms, including an enormous master bedroom, but Steve knew why Tony was letting Peter pick first. Steve wasn’t sure he wanted to be sleeping in the same bed with Tony either.
“Whatever you say,” said Fury, eyeing him like he thought Steve was crazy. Steve kept the smile plastered onto his face until Fury had turned away, dropping to his knees as he tried to calculate whether there was enough time for him to make a second batch.
“And I like yours, you big dork.” Steve smiled as Tony settled himself to sleep, apparently with no conscious thought. He wiggled his lithe body around a pillow, cuddling into it, fast asleep the moment his head hit the pillow.
“Steve, look!” said Tony excitedly, distracted away from his boyfriend’s eyes for the first time that day. “They’ve started accepting nominations for Homecoming King and Queen!”
Bruce nodded in agreement, still clutching his tea, which Steve could see now had flecks of paint and plaster in it from the destruction raging around them. “I’d leave them alone, Cap.”
.” He paused for a moment, his voice suspiciously shaky. “A bit of flattery so you could ask for a raise, huh?”
“And the bookstore,” Tony confirmed, laughing at the gobsmacked look on Steve’s face. “My name’s Tony Stark.”
“Yeah,” said Steve, gulping down a glass of punch. He could see some of his friends from the football team gathered around the voting booth — it would be a good way for him to kill some time and avoid dancing, and he could finally introduce Tony to all of them. Two birds, one stone.
“First of all, kid, you gotta stop calling me that. It’s ‘Tony’, or I’ll quit being your friend.” Tony smiled at him, letting Steve know he wasn’t really mad. Which was good, because Steve was more than a little anxious about things like this. “And second, I thought you didn’t drink?”
“Don’t say that, Tony,” said Steve sharply, and Tony looked at him curiously, momentarily distracted from their situation. Was Steve as badly affected as he was, and just hiding it better? After all, the guy
did you put into that thing, Maximoff?” asked Fury, his eyes blazing. “Were you trying to kill us?” Wanda looked confused, almost on the verge of crying.
Tony could have come up with a million arguments to refute that, but he knew Steve well enough by now that he’d accepted there were times when you couldn’t cross him. He glanced at Fury, shrugging apologetically.
“Thank you, Steve,” said Pepper, looking relieved. “I didn’t think you’d still be here, and I would’ve taken him home, but now I can get back to arguing with the idiot managers of this place.” She pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek and patted Tony’s. “Happy birthday, Tones.”
sure your pies are cooked through, because only half of you will be moving on. Is that clear?” Fury continued. Steve snuck a look behind him to Tony’s station where he was fiddling with his ingredients, clearly not paying attention to a single word Fury was saying.
Steve didn’t really care about any of this, and he found Tony’s attempts at stirring the pot more adorable than anything. Still, he was determined to win; and right now, the path seemed very clear ahead. Steve had grown up making bread almost every other day. This wasn’t just his childhood; this was something ingrained in his brain, and the recipe on the show didn’t seem that different from what he’d made so often as a child.
to counter whatever she might do. Except me. You need to trust me, and you need to trust that I know what I’m doing. Steve's still in there. I know he is. We just have to get him back.”
“Present company aside, boss,” she says, “SHIELD isn’t exactly on my list of besties at the moment.”
With a sigh, she gives up on the email she’s trying to compose and send before the plane lands. It’s either that, or risk delivering a deadly, if unintentional, insult to the Wakandan ambassador, and that wouldn’t bode well for her hopes of opening negotiations for purchasing some of their vibranium stores. She’s already got the Stark name working against her; Howard made no friends there back in the 40s, barging in without asking and carrying off a hunk of their property. The last thing she needs is to make everything twelve times harder by fumbling her grammar because she can’t handle the stylus properly.
and she’s letting Clint help her out of her dress back in their hotel room, roll off her absolutely destroyed stockings and wash her makeup off. Rhodey’s in the other room of the suite, getting his weapons out, making apologies to the host of the charity auction over the phone. Toni can’t talk Rhodey out of sitting vigil all night. She gives up trying, because the Vicodin reduces her need to care about anything.
“Because he’ll just crawl into the vents and nest in there if you try to kick him out,” Bucky says, and starts to put her cup of coffee on the counter beside her.
Toni isn't seated at her desk, or standing at the holo display center, like he expected her to be. Instead, she's standing at the floor-to-ceiling windows, leaning against the glass with one shoulder, arms crossed over her chest. She’s looking out and down, eyes fixed on something beyond the tower. “What can Stark Industries do for SHIELD this morning, Coulson?”
There’s a moment of silence and then Clint says, “Because a fucking supersoldier punched me. If Toni’d punched me, you think I’d be up here getting ice and aspirin?”
“Yes, ma’am. But, as the saying goes, discretion is the better part of valor. I beg you, be discreet. Wait for Clint and Natasha.”
“You know what the amazing thing is about the Phoenix Force, Steve?” he asks conversationally, and this time, it’s his grip that’s iron, keeping Steve locked in place, forcing him to his knees, even as Steve bucks and shoves, tries to break free. “It burns away what doesn’t work. It’s a cleansing force, a purifying agent of the universe. I think it’s absolutely fucking hilarious that out of all the people on the planet,
“Nice try, JARVIS,” she says, trying not to grin and failing spectacularly. “But the suit’s capabilities are more than enough to figure out if there’s a glitch somewhere. Now, be a good boy for Mommy, and tell her why her armor smells like a toilet threw up on a compost heap.”
The left wheel of the Jeep hits an indent in the ground, jolting Toni painfully against the sudden lock of the seat belt. Clint just sways gracefully, his hip almost touching her temple. Toni has a very brief, very enjoyable fantasy about shoving Mr. Perfect Balance right off the side. “How many are back there?” she says. “I don’t want to take my eyes off the road to check.”
In Civil War II, Captain Marvel starts pre-emptively fighting crime by listening to Ulysses, a newly-minted Inhuman with the ability to predict the future (at least, that's what it looks like at first blush). Tony objects, because we shouldn't arrest people for things they might do. Carol persists anyway, and the mission she undertakes with her Ultimates results in Rhodey's death and Jennifer Walters' being crippled and nearly killed. Tony keeps challenging Carol's certainty that Ulysses is seeing a definite future instead of what science tells him (Ulysses has the ability to crunch numbers and see
“Doesn’t take a genius to see how a fight’s most likely to go when it’s two fellas in flying, laser-shooting Stark-tech dropping in on two other fellas who have no weapons, no armor and no warning.” Bucky shrugs, glancing at Natasha with an amused smirk. “Balance it out with everyone in power armor, or even just fully geared and armed, different story.”
Toni’s hand slides up his back again, her other hand wrapped around a mug of steaming, creamy coffee. “You with me?” she murmurs.
“Jesus fuckin’ Christ,” he says hoarsely, as fire and acid shriek through his nerves again. He wants to scream, thinks he might have been since his throat is so raw and Toni’s face is so pale and tight, but swallows it back. “How much longer?”
“I did, thank you JARVIS.” He sets the bag on the counter and starts hauling produce out to wash. He glances out of the window over the sink as he does, squinting at the far-distant horizon. “Is Toni still flying?”
“Hail Hydra,” Steve replies, and Schmidt's image fades out as the holo-com returns to standby mode. He remains standing in place for a long time, staring thoughtfully into space, turning the entire exchange over in his head, examining every aspect of it that he can think to examine.
Toni flicks her fingers again, and the picture jumps. Steve’s standing on Iron Maiden, the chest peeled and torn away in chunks, the shield raised again Toni, barely visible under the broken armor, one wide blue eye shocked and terrified. Tiny hesitation, then another flick. Toni, bleeding and dazed, crouching in front of him. Hope warring with despair, head tilted towards him. Steve, in the middle of shaking his head, still angry, still murderous.
She lands flat on her back, skidding across the floor. His fist punches down again, hammering into her faceplate. The metal shrieks and groans. A sharp pain cuts into her eyebrow, and her right eye is suddenly blinded with hot and wet. The HUD flickers rapidly.
“Fuck you, kiddo,” she coughs, and her arms tremble, but she gets her ass up and pulls herself forward another few inches. And that’s where she slumps, eyes fluttering shut, body going boneless and limp as she falls onto her back.
He starts, blinks. She’s not smiling anymore, and there’s the faint hum of worry in his chest. “What? No, no. You an’ me, we’re in this together. I’m with you.” He snags her around the waist, nuzzles into her neck until she’s purring happily again. “Out for dinner, or y’wanna stay in and I’ll cook for you?”
“Toni,” he chokes, forehead rolling against hers. He palms her ass, readjusts her position until the head of his cock is nudging her entrance. Then he snaps his hips forward, sinking all the way in with a single thrust. Wet, velvet heat engulfs him.“Oh, fucking Christ,” he says, squeezing his eyes shut and feeling sweat pop on his forehead.
Much later, after Toni’s helped Rhodey study for that test and they’ve watched half a dozen unfunny sitcoms on TV and Toni’s stretching sleepily out on the couch under the afghan Rhodey’s mother knitted for him to use as a throw, she feels Rhodey’s hand brush over her hair.
He reaches out to turn her head more fully, and she feels his thumb brush over her cheek. “Nah,” he says, and his mouth is warm and damp, kissing it gently better. “You should be okay.”
a host. And I no longer am, because Extremis did its job and killed the infecting entity before it could affect me.”
His eyes are blurry and his face is wet and he doesn’t know why, not until her thumb gently brushes away the tears streaming down his face. “I’m sorry,” he says, thick and choking. “I woke up and I didn’t know where I was or who you were. I just reacted and I didn’t mean to fuckin’ hurt you, Jesus Christ, I’m sorry.”
in communication resulted in his utterly clean background check. JARVIS doesn’t usually make mistakes. “I repeat: I’m sorry, what?”
Toni perks up a bit at the mention of Carol’s name, because Carol can honestly be scarier than Natasha when she puts her mind to it. Carol will be on her side. “You’re still an asshole,” she says. “You couldn’t just land like a normal fucking person and knock or something?”
She bolts, pushing off the ground and into a dead run, panic hammering in her head. She’s got just enough self awareness to try and keep things between her and Steve, out of the line of sight of that goddamn shield. If that hits her, if she falls, if he catches her, she’s dead. Bucky's close. He has to be. She just needs to stay alive a little while longer.
And the tale Tony weaves, waking up on the Moon with blue fire surrounding him, getting unbelievable data scans from a device he built from scavenged alien technology, deciding to return to refute his results and discovering that his results can’t be refuted… Frankly, if anyone else but Tony Stark told him this story, he’d laugh and invite them to pull the other one.
And if the Phoenix Force corrupts Tony, the same way it’s done to every other one of its hosts, so much the better.
He sighs and regretfully leaves the armor behind, heading up to the flight deck and stopping in the penthouse along the way to pick up a jacket. At least this Phoenix bullshit hasn’t taken flying away from him, he thinks, albeit a little bitterly, as he lets himself float into the sky, rolling his eyes at the rapid formation of the Phoenix suit around him the moment his feet leave the ground.
The door in the kitchen opens and then closes again, and everything is silent. Bucky leans his head back against the wall and closes his eyes. Just for a second, he contemplates rushing right back to his room, make sure Toni’s still where he left her, still asleep, still safe. He knows it’s irrational, because JARVIS would have said something if she was awake, or injured, or under attack.
Bright, jagged surprise laces through Clint’s thoughts, and Tony finishes extricating himself from Clint’s head. “That’s not what you said before.”
Natasha arches an eyebrow. “It’s cute how you think this is a democracy, Rhodes. It’s not my fault you were too slow to grab the opportunity when it rose. Besides, if you’re that eager for something constructive to do, FitzSimmons need training. Their basic SHIELD aptitudes aren’t going to cut it with this team.”
Steve lets himself into his apartment and closes the door behind him after surreptitiously checking to ensure he wasn’t followed by either SHIELD or a loyalist devoted to Herr Schmidt. He’ll never be as perceptive as some of his friends, but he’s no amateur at spotting a tail. Everything is free and clear, but he still takes the precautions of closing his blinds and sweeping for listening devices, technological, magical and otherwise, before he opens the door to the small utility room where he keeps his holo-com and body paint.
is going to happen, and she’d much rather prefer a pleasant meal spent playing footsie with Clint than whatever it is this guy’s been coerced -- threatened? blackmailed? -- into. But she forces herself to sit back and say absently, “Yes, that’s fine.”
is all she has time to think before he’s in her space and she has to duck under an open-handed sweep of his arm. She barely gets clear before his knee smacks into her solar plexus and knocks her rolling across the mats.
“Thanks, J.” She eyes the corridor, debates for a second. “Hey, out of curiosity, where is everyone? I figure they’d have all swarmed me by now.”
Impulse makes him reach out and lay his hand over Tony’s, but it’s a smart move, he thinks, because Tony is just as touch-oriented as he is perpetually touch-starved, and he knows it has the desired effect when Tony’s eyes dilate, his face flushes, and he inhales, soft but fast.
“Tomorrow, I think. Cho’s landing in an hour, and Coulson’s arranging transport for her and all her shiny shit. Gonna take her awhile to set up, so I’m guessing it’ll be tomorrow afternoon at the earliest.”
With a mild tinge of regret, he tucks his tablet back into his jacket's inner pocket and straightens again. “Thank you, Paula,” he says, taking a quick peek at the brass nameplate on her desk. He glances at the closed doors leading to the inner office and hesitates a moment. “I don't suppose you can give me any hint as to her mood this morning?”
His eyes rake downwards over her wet body, linger on her hips, then come back up to her face. “In,” he says, eyes dark and glittering, and reaches for the tie of his sweatpants. “Definitely in.”
She blinks again and shakes her head. “No,” she says. “I’m really not. I mean, I used to. Might again in the future. But right now? That’s
He learns to interpret the vague, fuzzy sensations that resonate in his soulmark. Learns the hum that means Toni’s happy. Learns the dull ache that means she’s upset. The angry buzz that means irritation, which is different from the angry buzz when she’s contemplating murder. Learns when she’s tired, or hungry, or aroused. Learns to listen to the pulse of their bond before he’s even conscious when he wakes up in the middle of the night or the middle of the morning, in her bed -- which has become
In his cocoon, he wakes in the eye of a firestorm, with the piercing cry of a hunting raptor in his throat.
“Yeah, got that too, J,” she grunts. She doesn’t stop, rolls onto her shoulders, using the momentum to drive both feet into the pit of the goon’s stomach. She scrambles upright as he doubles over, twists into a perfect, graceful spinning hook kick, briefly thanking whatever whim made her put her work boots on this morning instead of leaving her feet bare. The steel-reinforced sole connects with his jaw with a solid crunch. He staggers into the wall, rebounds and comes back towards her. She knocks aside a sloppy, telegraphed grab, steps inside his reach and drives the heel of her hand into his nose.
Steve takes a long, deep breath and lets it out like a man coming to a decision. “I’m going to kill them all,” he says, matter-of-fact. Water is wet, the sky is blue, Steve Rogers will destroy Hydra.
“STRIKE standard escort complement is twelve,” Coulson says over the comm. “You will be looking at three vans, four agents per van. They will have EMP tech available. Are you vulnerable?”
By the time Fitz crawls back to his suite that night, he’s a whimpering mass of paranoia and bruises. The hand-to-hand with Colonel Rhodes wasn’t terrible, except when he got distracted and ended up flying across the ring. He still doesn’t think it was really his fault; he hadn’t known Rhodey (as the man said to call him) was a brilliant engineer until their appointment. He can’t talk shop
the ridiculous amount of money we pay them, since I end up fixing all their numerous fuck-ups. I don’t have
“No. Definitely no.” She shovels a giant ball of ice cream in her mouth, chews and swallows. “And if it’s all the same to you, I’d just like to skip straight to the ‘let’s never bring this up ever again’ part you mentioned.”
It’s only there for a second, but it’s battering around his chest under the blue circle, and he knows he didn’t imagine it. She smiles at him, at them, but he knows that’s false too. The bottom drops out of his stomach, and for a minute or two, all he can hear is the pounding of his pulse in his temples. All he can feel is the desire to retreat to the gym and smash through a few dozen reinforced bags.
The Hawkeyes have commandeered an Avengers quinjet, the Guardians another. Both cargo holds are packed full of mutants and altered humans and normal people who are just
She attends two of Coulson’s meetings, but doesn’t have the presence of mind to remember a word that’s said. She has the impression those meetings were a whole lot of nothing to say, though, because if something important had been talked about, she’s positive she would have remembered it.
He glances at his watch, eyes the elevator doors again. There’s no cell reception in it, he knows from personal experience. To hell with it. The elevator isn’t the only way down, and he skipped his customary cardio today.
When he asks her if she’s okay, she blinks at him once or twice and says, “Yeah. I’m okay. The nanites are still in the process of shutting down and flushing out of my system. It’s a little tiring, that’s all.”
Then his voice is back, a different cadence than she's ever heard before. Commanding and authoritative. “Link me up, JARVIS. Real-time feed to the suit’s sensors. Keep that channel open at all times. And I’ll take those overrides now, Iron Maiden.”
“Toni…” Pepper’s voice softens in a way Toni never likes to hear it go. “Toni, we’ve been friends for a long time now. And you know I would help you with anything. I really would.”
Awareness surges, recognition screams, triumph blares trumpets in her head. Something lightning-bright and blazing-hot and almost-visible snaps into place between them, and it
Toni cuts the jets, kicks herself right way up, and burns her stabilizers hard in the span of a second. She comes to a screeching halt in mid-air, right between vehicle two and three. She flips her hands up, repulsors whining to life, and blows the back doors clean off of van number two.
He swings his arm up and hooks his hand around Steve's shoulder, beams back at him and says, “Catch me up on what happened while I was taking a long winter's nap.”
Sometimes, he misses the ice. After two days of answering questions and authorizing accesses and giving permission for people to start moving in, and dealing with SHIELD via Coulson, in between sitting with his soulmates who are not conveniently placed in the same room, he’s more than ready to climb in the chair, have this whole fucking week wiped right out, and curl up for a few years of undisturbed rest.
Memories stir, meeting a big, bald man, targets of interest. It’s fragmented and hazy, makes no sense. His shoulder is melting, flaying to the bone, and the torment hits a new intensity. Fire washes across his mind, burning and searing and filling everything with dark, thick, choking darkness.
She sighs through her nose, a deep exhalation the ends on a wince and an involuntary motion of her hand towards her ribs. Her eye is throbbing too, and there’s an ache in the wide scrape above her eyebrow that’s still sluggishly leaking blood. “They’re still going to kill me,” she mutters. “I’m not going to be able to hide any of this shit from them.”
The message is not from Toni. In fact, it’s not a message his phone at all. It’s Toni’s phone, which he must have taken by accident the last time he brought her coffee, because their StarkPhones are identical. And the message is
He can hear other small noises in the house, now. Muffled curses and the swish of fabric and the tread of footsteps. Panic gnaws at him for a long moment, and he feels the urge to run and hide in a dark corner. But only for a long moment, because something else is surging, rising, blazing through his head, washing panic away in a bright white nuclear fire.
