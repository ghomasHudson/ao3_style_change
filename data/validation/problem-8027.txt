“Your Daddy was talking about the time of day, bambino. Not that wretched woman,” Maria lied to his son, which seemed to satisfy the pup as he nodded before picking his toys back up and resuming his play.
“Me too,” Tony chokes out, more emotionally fragile than he realized. He hears Steve make a noise of confusion above him, vision too blurry to see his face.
“Well of course, but that doesn’t mean – “
"Oh no! I wasn't supposed to tell you!" Miles confessed again with his hands ending up covering his mouth. Their Dad slowly leaned back into the couch, possibly trying to become one with the it, as the teens again laughed at their fathers expense. Their other father simply closed his eyes in frustration as Miles realized how upset his Pop must be if his Dad is essentially hiding into the cushion at this point.
"Jamie tell Poppy what we did today."
“Pepper is on it and will drop off the paperwork to sign before we leave here,” he said before turning back to her with a smile.
"I can, actually," Tony said with a smug smile, keeping still even as the Alpha slowly began to approach him. The Omega recognized the Alpha's tired moves, the way he thought he was intimidating even when he had nothing to back it up. That, and the feeling of warmth in his bond gave Tony the confidence to stand his ground.
It had been Peter’s idea to introduce her to the Avengers in small groups, after he and Tony had been planning a huge brunch to bring them all in at once. Realizing how overwhelming that would be, they started planning the introductions in increments.
“Hey!” cried the pouty archer.
Sure enough, the British voice spoke over the loudspeakers in every room of the mansion, asking Joey to join them in the living room. They sat there for several minutes as both Tony and Steve’s confidence began to waver.
“Wobots!” he said excitedly as he shoved one fist in the air.
“Father.” Tony felt instant anger hearing his baby so upset, which must have come off his scent cause his son just whimpered more.
“Yup.”
and having a sleepover does
“So it’s not true?” She asked, incredibly disappointed.
“I...I mean...you can call me whatever you want, Daci.” She had considered what her cousins called their parents, and settled on the one that sounded better to her.
“Yeah Daci, way to kick his grumpy butt,” Clint said as he offered her a high five, which she gratefully matched.
“You know, for a genius you’re pretty dense sometimes,” the blonde quipped back, smiling when his husband scoffed out in offense.
“Like you told me about your heart? When you found out a week ago?” she snapped at him, seeing them both draw back in surprise. “Peter told me on Sunday.”
Tony stretched his legs out a little before turning to cuddle next to his husband and daughter – taking a breath before reassuring her.
“Tati! Look!” she cried with joy as his face lit up when he saw the paper.
“Feel sorry for me baby, I’m injured,” the brunette pouted as he tightened his arms around Steve’s neck.
STEVE
The blonde remained quiet but obliged him, laying the heavy book in his lap.
. She couldn’t help fidgeting from his onslaught, wondering how much longer he thought she deserved this.
But Steve and Bucky had each other, at least. And they only saw that shithead on the weekends until their mom realized what was going on.
“Are you shit–” his longtime friend began dramatically, “STEVEN. Two weeks ago they wrote “KICK ME” on my wings! MY WINGS MAN!” he said bellowing with laughter along with his friend.
“Yeah well, next time have crazy-pants here stay away from
“Sure, squirt,” he said, feeling as exhausted as Bucky as he carefully pulled her up and out of her chair and took her into the bathroom. He made sure the water was warm enough before adding the bubbles, helping Jo take off her diaper then plop down in the tub.
In the street. There were three hooded figures that grabbed her the moment she stepped outside. She had tried to yell, cause a scene as they quickly dragged her to a white van, but one of the thugs had covered her mouth and nose with a white cloth. And then darkness, until now.
“I did this for you, my ungrateful husband,” he huffed out. “If anything, it’s you who owes me, your brave and daring man.” Steve chuckled at that, hefting the man a little higher in his grasp as he continued their journey back.
“Good! Glad that’s settled, I missed my little lab buddy,” Tony said with a clap of his hands.
Steve ended up staying at the mansion for another hour and a half - twenty of those minutes spent working on their project. The rest of the time, Tony was humoring Steve with all of his questions about the architecture, paintings, statues...and just about everything else he found to be beautiful.
“So then what happened before the cemetery?” Tony asked with concern. Joey shifted in her seat without responding.
“Hey! I thought you were sick? Do you still wanna come over?” he asked as Happy pulled up.
“Hey! I still am, bribing children with candy is a key element to my style,” he sassed, immediately laughing when his husband shut him up in his absolute favorite way.
It didn't take long to neutralize the threat, glad that his husband and son had also remained unharmed. After being assured the Dora Mijale would take care of the threat on the city, he steeled himself to help the neighboring village and save as many as they could.
“Ruth made me write an essay on the dangers of marijuana, what it does to an epileptic brain, why it’s currently illegal, oh! List of things that
He tried to stand up, but the dizziness from having his head slammed on concrete made him fall back over.
wanna do that?” he returned. Steve tightened his grip on Tony’s right leg to release his left hand, strong arm still holding Tony up on his back as he checked his own glow in the dark ring for reference. He returned his hand to balance Tony better before continuing walking the two down the path.
"So you're definitely not upset that Pop weirded out after seeing his ex?" the young man said with a smug smile. Tony smiled at his oldest as he shook his head fondly, boy was too smart for his own good.
“Breathe, Tony. We are not kicking you out,” his father said more gently than he’d ever heard him, a firm hand on his shoulder bringing him back to the present and realizing he’d said those things out loud.
The two had taken the pup on a walk to the park, Clint looking adorable as he matched his outfit with Lucky's purple collar and leash. Bucky brought a blanket and snacks for a picnic, just enjoying this kind of time together as he watched his boyfriend bond with their pup.
. You were the only family I had for the…worst time of my life. When I…when I lost…”
as she handed the teen the phone, Joey taking a gulp before taking it from her hand to put to her ear.
When they made it to the bedroom, they were both left only in their underwear…and Steve’s nerves began to set in again.
“Doesn’t excuse the attitude,” he reiterated to the teen.
“Go to your room, I can’t look at you right now.” Even as he watched her leave in distress, the need to get
STEVE
“Ha! You’re in tru-ble. He used your
Definitely coming from Joey’s room, making the brunette quickly get up and begin walking to her bedroom.
“Hey, Buck come on no harm done. She was just looking out for her cousin,” Steve said on her behalf as she blinked a few tears away.
“And if that’s not enough!” she said loudly, causing them both to look back at her in surprise. “She did swat me on the leg with her slipper,” she said with a sudden pout.
Or man.
“I’m great Uncle Thor, but what about you? How is Asgard?”
"Another round friends! I can share stories from my homeland that will keep this celebration going," the demigod boomed, helping change the subject.
Did you figure it out before Steve did? XD
“Yes sir,” she said with another smile. Emerson turned to the closest uncle – who turned out to be Sam – to koala bear hug him. Sam squawked a little as me tried to maintain balance. She may have jumped on him as well. He quickly positioned her more comfortably in his embrace.
“I love you too, Thumper,” her Dad said with a chuckle. “And I’ve already told you – I’m not going anywhere. Your Stark-ass is stuck with me.” She laughed a little before finally pulling back, sitting up as she looked down at her father. She felt her Pop shift behind her as she leaned back into him.
A smile started spreading across Em’s face at his antics. She was glad to have these two on her side. She stole a glance at her other foster father, the one who was glaring daggers into his husband’s head and couldn’t help the laugh that escaped her lips.
Steve quickly whirled around and enveloped both of his ridiculously incredible kids into a bear hug, before mercilessly tickling the pair.
“Yes, thank you. For there are more than two genders in this world, so why limit yourself? As for you, Brock, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. I do not allow bigotry in my own home,” Thor explained as he eventually released the fuming teen, standing back up as Rumlow scrambled to get to his feet.
“Hail Hydra.”
“Harley is at Nanny’s house so he can have as many cookies as he wants,” the older Omega predictably replied, purposefully pushing the plate closer to the pup. Steve stole a glance at Tony, who was smiling fondly at the interaction.
"You two idiots finally figure it out?" Natasha said sweetly, holding a cup carrier with what looked like two cups of coffee. Clint made grabby hands towards the redhead who handed him one cup and gave Bucky the other.
Peter smiled at his Pop, taking the tablet and moving to curl up further into his embrace in gratitude. He obliged being the little spoon as his Pop curled around him, burying his face in Peter’s hair. He felt his Pop’s breathing slow down and even out indicating he had fallen asleep.
Tony noticed her grimace at the prospect, but declined saying anything when he heard the little patting of feet, turning to smile as Peter rejoined them.
“Thank you for,” the blonde said suddenly shy, “being so amazing.” Tony felt his heart melt and his goddamn knees even weaken a little.
“HAPPY BIRTHDAY!” the brunette said as he quickly stood up and threw his hands in the hair. “Why are you spending it working? Come on, I’ll fix you a drink.”
“Bambino, I need you to look at me, my love,” Tony said slowly, offering his son a smile before continuing. “First of all, in what universe would I ever allow anyone to push you out? If Steve even hinted at that, I would kick him to the curb, understand? You are not going anywhere. Maybe not even when you become an adult,” Tony teased, smiling when it got the desired giggle from his pup. “He was telling the truth about lions, but they are wild animals. We are domesticated animals. Plus...bambino do you honestly believe Steve would do any of that?”
“What did you say?” Steve asked as he sat up and faced him.
forgiveness I wanted…” she said looking away again at her family.
“Eat Unca Miles!” Lilli cried as her brother quickly chimed in, the two chanting and continuing the attack on their uncle.
“How about I help you take a bath while your Daddy and Uncle Steve start cleaning up this mess?” their mom suggested as she kissed her cheek again.
“Sorry, I don’t put out on the first date,” Steve apologized sarcastically. Tony simply smiled coolly back at him.
Steve looked at Tony, a silent plea to check on her as the policewoman explained the situation. The brunette nodded with a small smile, walking past him to check on the teen inside. There was broken glass in the entrance-way, signs of a scuffle as he made his way to the voices in the living room.
“Tony, introduce us to your friend,” Obie somewhat growled out, and it was the first time Tony had ever seen the man thrown off.
“Hey Petey! Wanna help me dip some strawberries?” he asked. When Peter smiled and walked over without his usual enthusiasm, Steve looked at Tony in concern. He mouthed
“Great. Vi, I’m so sorry,” her Tati said as he stood up to face the woman.
But this was worth it.
“No,” Peter began after rubbing his eyes, “he left a note. He said he had to do it.”
Tony immediately straightened up and stared incredulously back at the super soldier, who only shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
“Okay, I know what you’re going to say, but just hear me out…”
“No, Steve. I’m not...I’m not lying. I really did have a family emergency. I swear that night...that was the best night of my life.” He looked sincere, but Steve believed it was still too good to be true. The look on the Omega’s face made it clear he realized he hadn’t convinced him either. “Look, um, do you see that pup on the monkey bars? The one about to jump into the waiting arms of the man encouraging him?”
As well as a promise for what was to come later that evening.
“How will I know? Or how will Clint know? What should I do?” he asked before he flopped back on his bed, crossing his arms over his eyes. He heard Cheryl chuckle at him but choose to ignore it.
who apparently abandoned me with the devil himself and NOW chooses to zombie herself back into my life. So no, Pop, everything isn’t
“Steve,
So Steve turned around and started walking back to his truck. Smiling to himself as he heard his boyfriend yell before pounding feet caught up with him and slipped his hand in his.
“Well then hurry the fuck up!”
"It's one thing for your people to get married in the eyes of our Lord, it's another thing entirely to have them raise a child," the wife added.
“I know Tony, she told me,” he whispered, running his hand along his beloved’s cheek for comfort. “Don’t worry about that right now. You are both safe and we can always talk about it later. I’m just glad to be home,” he said before pulling his husband back down to kiss him again.
“I’ll tell your daddies,” he said maturely as they finished their transaction and walked out of the store.
“You’d be a great Captain, Rogers. Think it over, okay?” Fury asked with a smile.
“I’m sorry, is this your…mistress?” Tony asked skeptically as Steve gingerly bandaged her foot. The woman in question’s face turned green and scrunched up at the question.
“Could we go to the gym today?” she asked quietly before pulling out of the hug, puppy eyes looking up at him - making him cave easily.
Steve would’ve been proud if he wasn’t so angry when she said, “no.”
“I thought you said you’d be Mulan, Lilli-bear! Besides, all of us are dressing up, babygirl. And you gotta dress up to get candy, don’t you want candy?” the brunette asked as Steve felt his eyes roll automatically at his ridiculous love.
“I heard he tied the knot, had to see the competition for myself.” The blatant arrogance stunned the man, if only for a moment as Steve felt anger spread through him.
“So, one, I was upset about that for all of point two seconds. She was throwing a lie in my face about you to get me to like her. And two, I didn’t even have to know it was a lie to not care about it, because…” she let out another laugh before looking at him with tears in her eyes.
“Thank you,” Peter said.
“I have a lot of powerful friends,
"Hm, well maybe - wait, Emerson do you have a UTI?" he asked with concern.
He wished he could’ve laid there longer and not interrupted the scene that made his heart melt, but the serum never let him sit still for that long. He carefully lifted Em’s head as he slid his way out, surprised when she didn’t wake up or even stir when he placed her head under a pillow. He took another moment to look at his family before moving to use the restroom. When he opened the door again to the bedroom, he smiled again to see his family hadn’t moved.
"Then what do you want princess?" the genius asked sincerely, smiling at the almost-adult. Her face scrunched up, indicating what she wanted wasn't something her parents would like.
“Did you just get him to agree to a nap? God, I love y–” he stopped suddenly, paralyzed with fear as Steve simply smiled back at the man. He leaned down to kiss him, whispering the words back.
“You’ll apologize to Vivienne the next time we see her. Okay, cub? She was really looking forward to getting to know you today,” he said as he pulled back to look her in the face, adding to the guilt in her stomach. She nodded back in response, though a small part of her wanted to argue that the woman hadn’t said two words to her all day. “Here, take this,” he added, Wolf suddenly appearing in her arms as the man stood up and placed her back down on her bed.
“Steve?” Harley asked shyly, hands resting on the Alpha’s head.
“Huh, and how exactly do you know Tony?” Helen asked, putting a protective arm around Tony’s shoulder.
“Bambino, come sit with us,” Tony told his son, one hand over his now visible tummy as the pup put down his legos to go over to the pair. He and Steve were sitting on the couch together and Tony pulled the pup between them. “We wanted to talk to you about something…”
“Come along, lad, let’s get your hands taped up,” Pappy said before he took off walking towards the front desk, not bothering to see if Harley was following him. But the pup did, after a moment, racing off after him as Steve watched with a fond smile.
“Right. Thank you, honey. What’s important is that you are forgiven, you are loved, and you’re not going anywhere Emerson Stark.” He smiled at her blush.
“Told you she’s a terrorist,” Sam said.
“Huh. Well. You should know that if you’re ever mean to him, I’ll tell Uncle Rhodey.” That had not been where Steve expected the conversation to go, taking a second before Steve realized he was getting a shovel talk. From a six year old.
Because behind James’ back - what he gently brought forward - was a puppy.
“Stone?” he asked incredulously, standing up to face the man. He felt Natasha’s small hand on his wrist, holding him in place.
She hadn’t seen May since before her Dad’s surgery. Though her parents assured the teen May wasn’t mad at her, it had just seemed weird asking to see her.
“Excellent points,” Clint agreed with a smile.
his ridiculous man.
He brought a change of clothes to shower and change into at the station, hoping none of his coworkers would notice. If Sam noticed, he didn’t say anything and just wished him a goodnight. He counted himself lucky no one else saw him.
But as time went on, Harry’s attitude started to change.
“He’s not a dog.”
“Aw, come one, when the cats are away…the mice will play,” she said as she brought the pipe to her lips to take a hit. She blew the smoke out slowly, Joey doing everything in her power to not get distracted by her gorgeous lips. Cara tried handing the pipe to her again as Joey felt her insides coil as the memory of the last time she’d done this crept in.
“I heard that!” shouted Tony.
He was finally released after Wade had spun him around a few times, glad to finally stop so he could look at the lanterns they had released - floating high in the sky and painting the perfect moment. He laughed with happiness as his parents moved in to hug him in congratulations - confessing that they'd known about it for a few weeks, after Wade had asked for their blessing.
But if he hadn’t enlisted, he wouldn’t have met his best friend Sam or his partner Natasha. And even though Buck lost his left arm from their last mission, he and his brother had made it out alive. For that he was thankful.
“J, lower the volume please,” Pete requested with a smile as he typed in his passcode. He opens the door, rolling his eyes again at the collective groan coming from the pair. They were under the hood of one of his Dad’s old cars, both also already dirty.
was what the pompous doctor suggested?” he heard Steve ask, now next to Bucky and offering him some tissues.
He looked over to Emerson, who wasn’t making eye contact with either. Peter interpreted her not immediate rejection of the idea as a sign to go. Adding a quick, “sure, Pop” before standing up to leave the room.
The man was prepared to too, as evident by his cocked back fist he was lowering.
“Hey Jim, good to see you,” Steve said, attention turning to the grimacing man and handing over the sticky girl. He reluctantly took the girl, shooting both Steve and Tony a glare but greeting his niece regardless. “Babe, do you mind helping me wash this off?” the blonde asked as the genius decided to roll with it, abandoning his friend in favor of (if nothing else) the chance to rub his husband’s arms. They walked to the kitchen and Steve’s demeanor didn’t change, still happy and almost playful.
to a Thai restaurant. Steve chastised him for spending so much money, assuring him his presence was “spoiling him enough.” He remembers Tony’s face scrunch up adorably, apparently he wasn’t used to not showing off to impress his dates.
“Who’s to say it can’t bite both of us?” the other teen voices, eyes fixated on the spider. Miles’ brows furrowed in confusion.
When Steve resurfaced, he frowned at not seeing his husband above the water.
“Seriously, what is happening?” Steve asked again.
“HEY!” she squawked as she tried to wiggle free, not exactly enjoying the two grown ass men dog-pile crushing her…but laughing nonetheless.
“JARVIS is Clint busy?”
“Me too, I told Jo you’re the only reason I’m actually friends with her,” Xavier teased. His daughter looked offended before mock-glaring at the other teen.
“You want me to keep your secret?!”
“Holy shit,” Wade said, turning to Miles with a frown. “Smiles why would you do that?”
“Yeah, I’m sorry if she scared you buddy, she’ll be okay,” Steve said with a smile as he turned to Peter.
Which, honestly, only inspired the man to tickle the unsuspecting child.
If one more thing was added to her current pile of crap – she might lose it.
“I’m betting he ran away with the president’s daughter,” Sam spoke up, saluting Tony before doing another shot and draping his arm around Natasha. “He’s too pretty for the circus and he’s too smart to get knocked up by a teacher.”
“So Harley, Steve tells me you like dinosaurs. Do you have a favorite?” Clint asked the boy, leaning forward to address the pup.
“It’s not broken, just sprained. My pride’s hurt worse than my ankle,” the blonde grumbled as he stretched to grab one of the pieces of paper. “What are you guys doing?”
“I’m not…I’m not supposed to…” she started, unable to think of anything except how hot Cara looked making rings with the smoke. The brown eyed babe didn’t pressure her anymore, smiling as she sat next to her and smoke the bowl herself.
“Yes, what do you think I meant by ‘long haul’?” the blonde asked with a shrug, unsure if Tony was actually offended or not. “I’ve told you countless times but apparently I need to up my game,” he said with a sigh as he pushed his husband back onto the bed, crawling on top of him. “You’re it for me, Stark,” he said in his Captain voice, claiming the man’s lips when he let out a laugh.
“Hey Daddy! How was work?” Peter asked, coming over to give Tony a hug of his own.
“Emerson, you are just as innocent and precious as your sister. You were the one that made her feel loved in her short life and no one blames you for wanting the best for her. But what I wanted to say… is that you didn’t deserve that life either. That life was…unfair and very cruel to you,” he closed his eyes as a few tears spilled, thinking of what she has gone through. He opens his eyes and smiles as her own tears betray her, finding strength to finish.
For a moment, she looked like she wanted to continue their little game, but changed her mind as she ran into her daddy’s arms.
!” Peter said excitedly. Steve smiled brightly back at his son, nodding in approval before turning to his husband curiously.
“Yeah they are going on a date tonight,” Daci said, watching as Peter’s expression went from nervous to relaxed.
“Sweetheart, we need you to breathe okay? That was a bad dream. Your Pop and I are safe and bored and absolutely alive,” Tony said. She could hear Steve scoff a little next to him. Her heart eased up a little at that. Chipped a little of the anxiety away.
“– I don’t know,” the shorter man said, shoulders shrugging. “I don’t know,” he repeated as he wrapped his arms around the super soldier – sighing as he returned the bear hug. Steve kissed Tony’s cheek before settling his head in the crook of the genius’ neck, breathing in the smell of motor oil and lavender.
Steve started moving his hands up the brunette’s legs and down around his thighs to fully grab his ass. He then yanked the smaller man towards him, a yelp escaping the genius’ lips. His body slid on the couch and practically onto the floor. Except he didn’t fully fall, because the smug bastard had a hold of the back of his knees as he loomed over the brunette with a sneaky grin.
“I love you baby, and your Uncle Steve loves you, and your Nana and your mom loved you too. Never forget that, okay?” he asked, smiling back at her as she threw herself into his arms. He hugged her tight, placing a kiss on the top of her head.
“Okayyyy,” she said still laughing, unable to detach the bear from the bear hug.
"My other present is you not finishing that sentence! And yes, early presents are a thing," she said after pulling her hand away quickly...knowing her immature father well enough to avoid the childish lick. She pulled away and started walking out of the kitchen.
“I love you too.”
“Fuck me sideways, are you a real paramedic? There’s no way you don’t moonlight as a stripper,” the brunette said as Steve felt his ears turn red, embarrassment burning brighter when he heard Sam snort next to him.
“Tony why are we at your parent’s mansion?” Tony still didn’t answer, just driving the two until he parked in front of the front door.
“Sleepy. My head feels funny, Daddy.”
“Okay Papa,” a sleepy Harley replied, snuggling closer into the Alpha as Steve stood the two up before walking them back inside. He spotted Howard first, who smiled at the pair before turning to the living room.
[Cool with me, just need you home by dinner] Tony replied.
“Bingo!” Pete said in triumph, ever thankful for his Pop. “And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with nannies, but
Peter thought for a moment before saying, "we'll flip a coin for my birthday." The two men stared back at him before turning to whisper to each other, earning yet another eye roll from their children.
“You haven’t had dinner yet,” Pop said with a grin, leaning back and wrapping her arm around her Omega.
meant.
“Harley?” Steve called, walking towards the playscape and frowning when he didn’t see anything. He was about to head inside when he heard a whimper coming from the side of the house. “Harley?” he asked again, walking towards the noise and frowning harder when he saw the pup trying to control his whimpers. “Hey bear,” the Alpha said to his kid, sitting down next to him behind the bushes.
“I’ll get it David Beckham, you stay here and help Steve get the food out,” Tony said with a laugh before taking off after the ball. Well, walking after it. He was barely starting to show and since they still hadn’t told their families, they really didn’t want the public to find out first.
He reluctantly started reading, rolling his eyes again when his brother leaned against his shoulder to listen as well.
“Hi,” the boy greeted.
Steve’s phone suddenly buzzed, snapping the blonde out of his moping as he turned to check it.
“Wait, Dad seriously?!” Tony exclaimed, watching as his son and father left the room together, much to the others delight.
“Yes you can, Buck. You’ve done it before,” Steve snarked back as he rubbed the lab’s ears.
“Are you offering?” the teen quipped back.
“Emerson, Samantha was dying. From the drugs your father and I put into my system when I was pregnant with her. She was in pain, having withdrawals. It’s why she was so fussy. Do you understand what I’m saying, Emerson?” she asked with a smile. Her mouth gaped open as she shook her head a little in disbelief.
“I got it Steeb!” Peter exclaimed as he ran back in with a small, wet, blue towel. He handed it to Stevw as the boy gingerly sat next to them, looking sadly at the unconscious teen. Peter watched as Steve gently wiped her face and neck. The blonde looked over to the boy, handing the towel back to him with a small smile.
“I almost killed you…like…like I killed my baby
He wiped the device before putting it near his little brother - who immediately complied and took the thermometer in his mouth without protest. He looked back to his Dad and gave him that
“It would at least explain his behavior,” Steve said, earning a glare from Bucky.
“You’re lying,” he quickly snapped back, hands moving to his hips at the sheer amount of betrayal from these two.
Just a quick stop by his apartment to return the necessary item.
the AI spoke up as the two started getting into it. They both groaned at the update.
"I didn't play Deadpool, I played Wade and Peter. I would never wanna play with that
"Do superheroes get nightmares?" The superhero chuckled at the question as he used one hand to open the door to his room.
Peter, confused by the question, answered with a mouthful of waffles, “yes?”
“Beloved?” he whispered to the sleepy genius, smiling as brown eyes slowly flicked open through thick lashes to his blue ones, watching the man begin to register the person in front of him.
" as the elevator dinged open. The taller man rushed in first pressing the button before Peter even got into the door. He gently shoved him on the way up, then growled when he had to karate chop grabby hands before they saw their family. He was able to dodge about half the ass-grabbing until the door open again and he rushed out to find his family. They walked in to find his little brother and sister sitting together on a couch reading a Shel Silverstein book. Once their presence was made aware, the boy jumped up and ran straight to the taller man, jumping into his arms as Wade tossed him in the air a few times.
He walked forward and saw in the middle of all of this, was the love of his life on one knee.
“Is she okay?” he asked in a deep voice, hoping his uncle wouldn’t notice.
“Okay,” Jo said, not really sure what she wanted her to say to that. Thankfully, her best friend grabbed her arm to steer them away. She went willingly, unwanted feelings bubbling in her gut as they walked into the air conditioned building.
"So the deal is you'll live here part-time and part-time with Wade, work at Stark Industries during the day while
The Stones had never approved of Tony anyway. Even though Tony lived comfortably, they saw him as
“Unca Bucky!” Harley cried in excitement, wiggle down from Thor before toddling over to her father, who sighed heavily before obliging the toddler and lifting him up into his arms.
“Jesus Stevie,” Buck said in disgust, causing the blonde to roll his eyes in amusement.
“His name is none of your goddamn business cause he is not your son. I’m bonded, Ty. I have a new Alpha and soon he’ll adopt
“I can’t promise that lovebug, but I will do my darndest,
He was looking at her with a smile, pulling the covers back invitingly as she crawled over to him and under the blankets. She immediately wrapped her arms around the brunette, beyond grateful for these two dorks as parents. He returned the embrace, giving her a tight squeeze before settling the two back comfortably.
“But Daddy,” Peter whined, looking close to tears as his parents froze for a moment. Daci felt bad for him, knowing the dread of being separated from your parent.
“They’re pretty silly,” she said after a moment, smiling at seeing two little monkeys wrestling each other.
“Well, on the bright side, you won’t have to hole up with us for a week,” Natasha said with a smug grin.
He’d have to do better about convincing the blonde otherwise, then.
“I just don’t like her, she seems two-faced.”
from this two-bit tramp!”
“That’s true but so are you. You were my first pup. Baby bear to my Papa Bear,” Steve said as he pulled the pup into his lap, kissing his blonde head. “I love you Harley. Just as much as I love your Daddy and Peter.”
She eventually stopped in front of the door to Tony’s room, turning to smile at Steve before opening it. He followed her inside as his eyes fell upon a bruised and bandaged Tony. He was surrounded by pillows but still looked better than he had expected.
“Sam? Which one of those is mine?” Emerson asked with her arms crossed.
“So glad you guys came to visit,” he said sarcastically.
He had decided to momentarily drop the investigation in favor at gawking at his husband while they changed for dinner. Plus he trusted Steve...and Barnes was miraculously with Natasha now. Not to mention Steve seemed perfectly fine now, even shooting his husband a smirk as they finished getting dressed.
She nodded, wiping her eyes with the palms of her hands to rub away the tears. She turned to smile at her other two uncles before she went to find her guys.
have to, so I guess we can wrap these up for May…?”
He rolled his eyes and laughed with his friend, taking a moment to enjoy their view while grilling on the balcony.
"I'm your friend's little sister and also an American so you don't want any diplomatic issues?" she replied with snark. Shuri looked hurt and sighed heavily, erasing the smirk on Emerson's face as she frowned at the sight.
She did not owe the woman who whored her out for drugs a goddamn thing.
“Is...everything okay sweetheart?” he asked, noticing the suddenly antsy nature of the child. She had slowly come around to trusting the Avengers and hadn’t acted this shy in a while. Her blue eyes shifted back and forth before looking up at his. He was patient with her, arranging sandwiches as she climbed up to sit on the counter next to him. And after taking a deep breath, she started to speak.
“It was a trick,” she began, quietly and without her recent confident vibrato. Both Tony and Steve leaned in towards her as she continued. “They only invited me over to find out stupid Avengers gossip. They didn’t actually want to be my friend.” She hung her head as she told them, focusing on a pattern on the table that she traced with her hands.
“Alright,” Steve said with a smile, gently untangling himself to turn the shorter man around to face him. “What did you want to tell me?”
He settled for nodding in silence, following the man down the stairs and back on solid ground.
“Hey kiddo, how about we get you home, huh?” the man suggested as he rubbed her arm in comfort. She suddenly shook herself from his embrace.
“I didn’t say he was. But it’s nice to imagine he’s kind of like one. My mom’s allergic so I’ve never had a dog. I want to adopt one when I move out, that’s at the top of my list,” Steve said as he was pictured what it would be like.
"Well, Pop, like you...I also happen to have a sugar daddy," he said, hoping to ease the tension in the room. It made his sister and Dad howl with laughter, while his Pop simply crossed his arms in response. Peter smiled a little at his family, knowing his Pop well enough to know he'd argue against him.
“Yeah well, Clint gave me a ride after my irrational husband abandoned me at the capital.”
Clint hummed below him, wrapping his hands around the brunette’s face and deepening the kiss.
“Are you two close?” the brunette said as he filled their glasses with water.
Clearly, it wasn’t in Steve’s.
“Yes! Okay? Yes. They did. And it hurt like a motherfucker!” she said as she once again curled in on herself. The two fathers sat in silence as they absorbed this new information.
“What were you doing up?” she asked, knowing he wouldn’t have been able to hear her from their bedroom.
“They have their moments,” Cheryl agreed. “I wouldn’t have all of this though...if...I had dealt with it when I wasn’t ready.” Bucky stared back at her for a long moment.
“Dad…”
“Uh huh…and is that the only reason you stopped by?” Steve asked with a coy smile, hand still holding the door mostly closed.
"Are you gay?" he asked, causing the two fathers to choke on their breakfast. She had never officially came out, though the fathers could've guessed when the only crush she's had since they met was on a certain princess.
“Bruce, tell me they’re alive and well so I can kick their asses,” his husband blurted, startling the three.
To both of them.
Which was why it made sense, seeing the redhead storming towards him first thing Monday morning as he continued avoiding his boyfriend in favor of hiding beside the school.
He made sure to sigh heavily before addressing the drunk teens - evident by their sway.
“I’m not exactly…hurting right now, if you catch my drift,” she said with a horrible attempt at a wink and finger guns.
Faded white daisies - by the look of them.
He ignored his little brother’s recant of whatever happened last night in favor of sipping on the hot coffee he had poured himself. He watched the younger man prepare some burgers and fries for them, offering his thanks by not asking him to stop talking - even though he couldn’t care less.
“Why did you call me bear?” Harley asked, quiet and almost shyly. Steve thought about it for a moment, unaware the name had slipped out before answering the boy honestly.
[Hey dads, is it cool if I hang out with Xavier after school today?] she lied as she messaged their group chat.
"So, you going to finally tell me what Bucky said that upset you?" he asked his husband who fondly rolled his eyes at him; the man must've known he'd bring it up sooner or later. His love took a breath before answering quietly.
“Soooo…rumor has it you asked Wilson out to prom?” Peter had been sitting on the bleachers after school, waiting for his science club to meet up in another half hour. He turned to look at Emerson climbing up to join him.
, and Wade just
She sat on the comfy couch in Kate’s office, foot tapping from her anxiety. She just told Kate her deepest darkest secret. The reason she refuses to meet with her birth mother and why she constantly worries about her fathers’ kicking her out. Kate was silent, probably thinking the worst of the sullen teen in front of her.
“But neither of us are going anywhere, okay? We’re right here,” he finished quietly after planting another kiss on her head. He held her for a few more minutes as the three sat in comfortable silence.
“Any theories?” the blonde asked.
“Come on! It was six against one, that deserves a swift kick in the crotch!” she said, sticking out a foot in emphasis.
Steve looked back at her and sighed.
“I’ll throw in Steve’s blueberry and peach cobbler,” Tony said to Rhodey with a smile, enjoying the playful scoff from his husband. He also sent his oldest friend a meaningful look, considering the conversation they had earlier.
Not to mention the sweet, ‘Steve!’ Harley tried saying repeatedly.
Tony focused on his breathing as he thought about that spark he felt when he had shaken Steve’s hand and chalked up to static electricity. How fan-fucking-tastic the sex was between the two.
Woof. Sorry to do y'all dirty like that. I wrote a lot this weekend and didn't want to leave y'all completely hanging, so here's the other two I wrote.
"My man!" Pat said with a hand out to high five the kid, the boy grinning and complying. "I saw him on the news, that dude is awesome. We can definitely do that for ya. And you miss? I hear you'd like a cut and color?" Pat asked as he ushered the two to sit in chairs next to each other.
“Almost regret not getting a tattoo on my ass,” the brunette murmured as he wiggled his rear a little. Steve gently swatted said ass with a chuckle before responding.
“Tony, honey, everything’s fine. Great, actually. That’s my happy voice, not my panic voice,” Steve clarified, sending a little of his current happiness into the bond. The feeling he got back was happy and thankful.
Something was wrong. Tony was lying to him and broke up with him and Steve just wanted to know why. No, actually he thinks he knows why. He just wanted to help Tony.
She clutched her stomach in pain, determined to keep checking the kitchen rather than ask her fathers for help.
“Alright!” she conceded, gasping for air. “You win! P… Papa please!!” and true to his word Steve released his captive, giving the three time to catch their breaths, sprawled over each other and looking up at the ceiling. She stayed a moment longer on Steve’s broad chest, enjoying the deep breaths he was taking, lifting her up and down. I think I’ve got a hang of this ‘good touch’ thing, she thought to herself as she rolled off Steve to lie beside him and Peter.
“Two dads and a million aunts and uncles are more than enough,” she grumbled into Steve’s shoulder.
He continued driving in silence, soaking in her words but knowing her well enough to know she wasn’t telling the entire truth. He waited until they pulled up in front of Susan’s house to confront her about it.
“Hey Daci,” Tony said with a smile when he noticed her in the doorway, beckoning her inside.
...it was Clint.
“If he does, your Dad and I will take care of it. Or Natasha, she technically called ‘dibs’” he smiled at his son who laughed at the thought, knowing his aunt well.
And he was...
And he definitely felt like he was doing better when they had several good days in a row. They were back to pranks and teasing and stolen kisses. But he should have known himself better than that.
Gave him the courage to go yell at his stupidly generous husband.
He even broke down to his vice principal when she called about his absences, crying on the phone as he explained he needed a mental health day.
It took all three of them to carry it up the elevator in one go - since her hands were occupied with holding Max. They helped her set up as her Pop went to make lunch, her Dad even letting one of the scratching posts in the living room.
“Okay...I really thought I told you-” James began, hands up in surrender as Clint quickly interrupted him.
“Prolly has a tiny one,” Xavier muttered in support. She smiled at him, so incredibly thankful for her friend. In this uppity spoiled private school, she tolerated very few people.
As expected, Bucky shot up out of his seat and absolutely shook with rage.
"You need to get dressed first, maybe take a shower cause you look nasty," she said as she confiscated his bowl of popcorn.
“Jo?” they heard a voice behind them, turning around and both frowning at Cara.
“Tony, go to your Mama and help with Peter. Steve and I will find him,” Howard reassured the Omega, nodding to the other Alpha before heading to the boy’s room.
He knows he could do it and love this boy unconditionally, but he wouldn't go through with it without Tony.
“Who are you going to be, darling?”
“When Buck said that, he meant you should be grateful for the ones in your life that love you. Not that you shouldn’t open your heart up so others can love you too. And you, my sweet girl, have so many people that love you in this life and already think of you as family. Like May and Peter, Sam, Nat, Clint, Pepper, Rhodey…your Dad. And me. I love you so much Joey, and I would never be mad at you for wanting help or advice from someone that isn’t me or your Dad. I know I’m a stubborn ass but I also know my limitations when it comes to female anatomy.”
"That chicken-shit wouldn't dare!" Tony piped in. "With everything he's done, he'll probably cop a plea to escape some jail time. If word gets out, can't imaging what it'll do to Stone's stock either..."
“Tony…” Steve said pointedly as Joey didn’t bother stifling that laugh. “Hey,” Steve’s attention turning to the teen, “you still need to answer my question,” he finished with a pointed finger in her direction. He turned his attention back to the sauce, revealing more on the stove for Joey to make out they were having chicken parmesan for dinner. She took another whiff as she smelled garlic bread in the oven.
"Instead of presents and a party, yes," she said confidently as she smiled at the blonde.
Joey’s brows furrowed as she thought about it, shaking her head no in response.
“-who’s at the door?” a young voice asked, grabbing the door to open more to see. Standing next to the teen was a small girl smiling at Steve.
“I know you’ve been teased at school for it. And when I stood up for you you literally yelled that you weren’t a damsel,” James muttered sheepishly, curling in on himself next to the blonde. Clint suddenly remembered that instance, guilt seeping in his pit for lashing out at this wonderful man.
“We don’t…
“You don’t care about me! Just let me go so I can run away...it’s what you want!” Leo declared before he collapsed in on himself, crying his tiny eyes out. Peter finally released his wrist and sat on the ground next to him, hesitating a moment before wrapping one arm around the shaking boy’s shoulder.
Bucky was kicking ass in the army, moving up the ranks and able to tell his husband who told Steve.
“Because I’m trying to give her a normal life. And yeah she’s five but she deserves her autonomy and her own bed in her own room. I can’t...I can’t keep relying on her. She deserves so much more than what I can give her…”
“Tony, I love you. I’ve loved you since we first met, loved you more when we took Peter in, and even more than I thought possible when you insisted we bring in Emerson. You are the love of my life…those four stones represent each of our individual birth stones. A family I wouldn’t trade for anything. So. Anthony Edward Stark-Rogers, will you…renew your wedding vows with me?” Steve finished what he needed to say, kneeling still waiting for Tony to respond.
“Oh man, are you still grounded? I’d love to take you out for a girl’s day.” Joey squinted her eyes at that, still smiling.
She took a moment to glare at both of them before looking down.
“Yeah, you’re right. I should go talk to him. Come with me and sit outside the door,” Tony said with a purr, smiling when Steve’s smell changed to happy and he felt appreciation push through their bond.
Tony would chuckle if this was a funnier situation.
Nothing.
“I had never wept so hard and so quietly for so long in my entire life,” Buck said with a straight face, which immediately broke when his oldest friend in the world burst out laughing.
“I don’t know what I want,” she answered honestly. Past shrinks have either told her what was wrong or spent the whole time being condescending to her.
“You okay baby?” he asked Peter, frowning when the tears began to spill down his cheek, causing Steve to kiss the spot and bring the boy into a hug. When the boy shook his head no, Steve stood the two up, cradling the boy close. “I’m going to take Petey upstairs to get an ice pack. Nat you’re obviously in charge.”
"Have I apologized lately for how horrendous I was at his age?" she asked.
She blinked some of the tears away that made him blurry. She suddenly felt both incredibly drained and overwhelmed. She was craving physical reassurance and hesitated only a moment before speaking again.
“They are currently hiding in Sir’s laboratory, pretending to be doing something of importance.”
“If she’s anything like these three she must be an angel,” Clint said, walking to the fridge that was covered with family pictures. “I’ll trade her for Barney,” he continued, seeing the beautiful teen hugging Bucky in one of the photos.
“How are you so sure?” Clint asked, a little insecurity creeping in even as he was being given everything he’d ever wanted in life.
All day, she thought about what would happen if she lost Tony. Tony, who’d just gotten into her life only to be stripped away from her.
“That’s a very respectable trade,” his Pop said smiling at Wade.
“Nah, no of course not,” the shortest one clarified. “We just mean cause he’s a fairy.”
“Nothing,” she whispered, shrugging unhappily. “It’s not like it’s the first time I’ve heard that…”
They sat together at the dinner table as Pop brought the eggplant lasagna he made from scratch and Dad brought in some salad behind him. Dad started talking about the work he’s been doing preparing for the Stark expo, which happens to be the same weekend as his birthday.
Steve waited until they left before vaulting himself over his husband to finally claim his spot on the couch. Tony stared at him, confused and disappointed. “Wait, what? No encore? You’re such a tease, Rogers.”
“Everything okay?” Steve asked quietly after placing a gentle hand on his shoulder.
“Yes!” she exclaimed, throwing both hands in the air, making Clint wobble a little.
Steve only made himself more comfortable, grabbing the mass of blankets off the ground, as he responded, “you’re welcome to join me, but no funny business.”
“Now, I realize you’re here to lecture me about the dangers of marijuana before administering whatever punishment Dad ultimately decided on,” she said, throwing a glance at Tony. Which got a chuckle out of both of them. “But may I present evidence to the contrary,” she said pushing forward the stacks of papers towards them.
“Son, you know I can easily move you from that seat, correct?”
The other goon.
“Did she just out parent us?” the brunette asked his husband in confirmation, who only smiled and nodded in agreement.
She knew this was a possibility, of course, seeing him again. Thought it was a small possibility after the name change, new identity and superheroes as fathers. But then again, the universe never really seemed to be on her side.
“Jo, that means that you’re home by eleven thirty at the latest,” Steve said pointedly to her.
“Her powers…” Steve said quietly, connecting the dots before Bucky did.
“What do you think, Petey? Does calling her Aunt May live up to your family standards?” Jo asked teasingly at the boy.
“Yeah, maybe you’re right,” Emerson said quietly, “but it felt right to a tortured six year old. Knowing death was better than a lifetime ripped away from her family and forced into sex slavery in a different country was –”
“She’s straight! She knows you like her and she’s using that.”
Wade helped halt his thought process with a quick kiss on his lips, pulling away with a slap to the shorter man's ass. Peter glared at the back of Wade's head as he waited a moment longer before joining his ridiculous family.
“Tony! Don’t you dare give in. He is still grounded and we already did the other thing,” Steve stopped himself before confessing something else. Peter turned to squint at his Pops, confused but also really intrigued. They had already spoiled him on his actually birthday. He turned back to his still silent Dad, knowing the final nail to his Dad’s will-powered coffin.
“Yes well, your fathers warned me of inappropriate behavior, I should do better to control my temper.” She smiled again before patting his enormous bicep in comfort, getting up when the oven beeped to indicate the frozen pizzas were done.
"I think you could literally pull off anything. Even a man bun. However I must warn you if you do ever get a man bun then I will be forced to no longer be seen in public with you," she teased as he laughed along with his daughter. He rolled his eyes fondly as she moved to sit at the kitchen island.
have done better. And I will do better,” he made sure to lock eyes with Tony. “I promise.”
“Yes Harley. I love you son.”
The blonde’s expression went from confused to shocked as his eyes widened at what was inside.
He gently closed the book, holding it close to his chest as he watched Tony shift over to sit directly in front of the taller teen.
She could also tell by the lighter weight in front of her that Tony was sitting closest to her. She still kept the blanket over her head, not really in the mood to start whatever conversation they were planning.
“And what is wrong with checking in on you? Your wife was the one who made me promise to keep an ‘eye on her boo’,” the smug man said, even adding air quotes. It was a low blow, using her wife against her but it worked. Whatever, she was weak cause she missed Shuri. She wasn’t afraid to admit that.
“Edwin,” Mrs. Rhodes said as she walked by them to move to the living room, baby in her arms and the other two girls following her.
,” she said sobbing.
But the Alpha just took it in stride, wrapping his arms around the Omega while maintaining eye contact.
“Holy shit,” Steve said as the two ran towards the two bodies. Bucky ran for Daci but did pause to steal a glance at Clint, who was still breathing.
“No, he’s got a point. Let’s go,” Bucky said, turning away from the pair and heading straight for the elevator. He waited a moment before Steve came into view, glad he could only hear and not see their goodbye kiss. He also purposefully ignored Steve’s side eye, not feeling the need to assure his oldest friend he had no plans to be a brainwashed assassin again.
“Peter,” their Pop said tiredly, walking up to rub the boy’s back.
“Girls too...sometimes Becca was the brains of the operation,” Steve said absently, laughing when Tony poked him in annoyance.
“Now. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to give your daddies a call and give them your location, if they wire transfer me ten million dollars to an offshore account. And then we’ll sit back and watch them fall into the trap I’ve set for them. And after we watch the superqueer-os explode into a million pieces, I will gut you and leave you to die, which is more than a cheap whore like you deserves.” He smacked her again after his little speech, the ringing in her ears that had began to dim getting louder.
Which meant...HYDRA had turned her into the soldier Bucky had always been afraid of.
They were out there for over an hour, enjoying each other’s silent company as they stretched and listened to the city sounds below.
“You’re right we should hold hands,” Clint said. And before Bucky could voice that he was answering his question, the blonde grabbed his hand and dragged him down the stairs.
“What are you talking about, sharpshooter?” Of course he would make a joke right now. Vi was right about him. And that’s why the next words came out of his mouth.
, Steve. Steve, meet the love of my life, Peter.”
“Yes, also that. Very important factor, but there was one other thing I said.”
"Invasive? Like you x-ray me or something?" Emerson asked innocently as she swung her feet sitting on the counter. Bruce shared a look with the fathers before gently addressing the teen.
“JARVIS, see what Barton, Banner and Romanoff are doing. Invite them up for celebratory pizza,” Tony said to the ceiling. Conversations picked up as the others quickly arrived, Daci remaining quiet as she watched the group get loud and interact with one another.
And suddenly Jo felt the air leave her lungs. The energy in the room shifted as she heard Steve answer for her.
“I think he knows better than to mess with you when you’re really upset. He still has bruises from the last time,” he reminded her, smiling and eyes rolling
“About what?” he asked, though he didn’t want the answer.
"You brought me tulips, Bambi?" his Dad asked with a smile as Peter quickly handed him the bouquet. His Pop stayed a little weary, eyeing the flowers in his husband's hands.
“What? Peter? No, this is my fault – you heard the principal, I started it.”
, Alan! My boys shouldn’t be expelled!”
“Steve,” the bastard whined back, turning around to grab some fruit to slice up as Steve furrowed his brows and crossed his arms in response. When his brother turned back, he smiled at the sight of the teen and put everything down to walk over and envelope him in a hug.
“Love you baby,” his brother said, smiling when she returned with a “wuv you dada.” He kissed her cheek once more before handing her back over to Steve.
As he walked by a closed door, he could hear sounds coming from behind it, the word ‘no’ sticking out better than the others. Buck placed his ear against the door, in case he felt he needed to step in. He heard ‘no’ again and a little more forcefully, followed by a ‘stop it, Brock!’ that had Buck grip the handle to open the door.
“Come on Petey-pie,” the blonde said again, finally able to pull the little koala bear off his Daddy long enough to bring him up into a hug. Steve stood up with him, giving her a second to see Tony while the man comforted the tired kid. She felt Rhodey nudge her shoulder, encouraging her to get up and walk over to the hospital bed.
Which made Daci both relieved and disappointed at the same time.
She yelped from the snug clothing while he simply finagled her to sit up and on his lap, wrapping his arms around her in comfort.
Steve patted the open space next to him on the couch, his face tired as he pulled some of the blankets the other three had been sharing to give. She gulped before declining and moving to sit several inches away from the man, curling up into a ball at the farthest end of the couch.
“She said you had pretty drunk eyes!” the Alpha whined.
“We should get going, actually,” Cara said, obviously uncomfortable with the cold shoulder Xavier was blatantly throwing her way.
"Do you think he'll actually file charges against me?"
She heard him sigh before hugging her slowly, wondering why this wasn't keeping the voices at bay.
“So it’s just us?” Tony asked, moving to unbutton Steve’s shirt. The blonde rolled his eyes fondly at the man, knowing there was a chance that they couldn’t just jump into the tough conversation. A pretty big chance, actually…since his husband was a damn horn-dog.
She felt anger roll over her as she refused to break his piercing blue eye contact.
That’s when he spotted the hole almost big enough to fit through. He managed to push past the pain, getting to a sitting position as he tried to make the hole big enough for his body to squeeze through.
What she needed, was a fucking drink.
“Yeah huh!” Tony exclaimed, offended and finally looking up at him. “I lied about your one hundredth birthday present, I lied about liking your oatmeal raisin cookies and I lied about your ass not looking slutty in your yoga pants.” A smile spread across the super soldier’s face as he considered the man’s confessions.
“Not really, just some teenage bullshit…”
She obliged, sitting near Steve and downing the glass he handed to her.
He thought about that possibility as he climbed into his bed later, smiling to himself as he slept peacefully that evening.
“Well, if he was good enough for you, he’d be here,” Sunset purred out, even having the audacity to play footsie with under the table. Tony lost his composure when he jerked his leg back, bumping the table and causing his godfather to finally put the menu down with a glare.
“Hey Nat…”
Buck followed them, sipping on his coke as the two made their way into a secluded room. Inside were a few people that he recognized but he steered toward the redhead he always thought was cool.
“Right, well, I’m off for a run,” Steve said in a clipped tone. “I need you back to watch the boys by noon, Morgan’s got a doctor’s appointment at twelve thirty to update her shots.” Tony mumbled what he thought was a confirmation, but he was drifting off to sleep, barely hearing Steve ask JARVIS to remind him of the appointment.
“Thanks guys, I’ll see you later,” Joey said as she got out of their car and headed into the mansion. If she can pull it off, she’s going to plan her eighteenth birthday – which is in several weeks – to play paintball with a small group. Peter wouldn’t be able to play, but he could cheer and watch them from the sidelines.
“Tony , I should be straight with you…”
“We do,” Tony purred back, returning the kiss before leading the two to the dining room.
“Hello Ashley,” he returned with an equally fake smile, the same one he uses with the press.
“No! You are just trying to weasel your way out of this and you know Pepper will kill me if I don’t go! Jo, what time does the luau end?”
"J what time is it?" he asked the AI.
“Hi Peter,” Tony cooed, soaking in the warmth and gently kissing the pup’s head. “I’m your Daddy. And this handsome Alpha here is your Papa. We love you so much, peanut.”
Peter looked at Wade who had been listening to Emerson's story, the man looking at her with a sad expression. Miles moved to sit in his sister's lap, hugging her in comfort after hearing a little bit about her past. She easily returned the embrace and kissed him on his cheek.
Normally a hug from her dads meant only love and acceptance, but the negative voice creeped back up into her brain as they stood there.
“Cause you’re madly in love with me. And my cock-sucking game is on point,” Wade argued in his defense. Peter couldn’t help chuckling at that, rolling his eyes as his husband continued distracting him from the upcoming event.
...who...the
“I...I…” Daci said, unable to stop the thickness of her voice, looking to her father for help.
“You read my case file?” she said accusingly, cringing at her own harsh tone. She felt her old walls go rigid with defense.
“Steve’s turning 30 in two days and doesn’t want to get a drink with us,” Clint explained as Steve felt himself fume a little.
Joey’s draw dropped like in the cartoons. The words registered in her brain, in her heart, in her fucking
dress up as princesses.”
“Hey man,” Rumlow slurred out, keeping the door still mostly closed. Buck didn’t respond as he pushed the door open the rest of the way.
So needless to say, he was not a fan of the Starks.
“Yup. Morgan’s too young for bath salts and bath bombs, but you should see one of my baths one of these days,” Tony said with wiggly eyebrows. “I can make it look like a rainbow.” Daci stared at him for a second before a smile broke across her face.
“How about I help you get to bed?” Natasha asked the doctor, walking over and helping him to his feet.
“Was just as freaked out as she was. But that’s my point. I failed her and I keep failing her and-”
“I know you are, sweetheart.” He heard her sniffle a little before continuing.
Steve pulled his hand away to place both on the side of his love’s face, bringing him in to kiss in gratitude.
She rolled her eyes as she tried to sit up, immediately pushed back by the God of a man she had somehow forgotten about. She did not mind his touch, however.
look she’d seen from him a million times.
He looked down as his eyes bulged in disbelief. Sitting there, fangs still embedded in his skin, was the colorful radioactive arachnid. Shock and panic caused him to have a delayed swatting reaction, killing the bug he had worked so hard to create.
She stood against her bedroom door, growing more frustrated at the sudden anxiety in her stomach and quick intake of breath. Pete was with Wade, her Dad took Miles clothes shopping and her Pop had offered to spar with her. She turned him down because she wasn't in the mood.
"Can we wear these out?" Miles asked excitedly as he ran to show his other father the entirety of his outfit. Steve looked perplexed as he looked around for a store employee, smiling as a young woman came over to help them.
And there they were: two of his most favorite people on the planet. His most favorite squealing when he saw him.
“It’s um…” the brunette faltered as Steve waited patiently for him to continue, focusing on finishing up their drinks. “I...
"Of course, Miles! Do you know how you want it cut?" Steve had asked as he returned the hug the boy had given him.
“Well…” Em interrupted the silence, “sounds like you should go tell him that.” She gave him a small smile that warmed his heart. Up until this point, Steve had been very respectful of her personal space…knowing her history with men. Any doubts were squashed, however, when he brought her into his chest and wrapped his arms around her. He noticed the slight hesitation from her, only for a moment, before extracting her arms to wrap around his middle. The father selfishly relished hugging his daughter.
She actually laughed in their arms, heart full as they slowly starting laughing with her.
“This is Clint, he found my wallet and brought it back to me,” Bucky explained as they heard the sounds of the ‘monsters’ joining them - screaming out ‘MOMMY!’ As he watched her squat down to give all three a hug, he suddenly felt like he’d outstayed his welcome.
“I have a fucking grandmother?!” she demanded at Steve, who simply set his pad of paper aside at her outburst. Tony, still confused, looked back and forth between the two as Steve took a breath to answer.
She shook her head no with a small smile of her own, not wanting to cause any more stress to the man by making the boy scream again.
“This is cause for celebration!” Thor bellowed once more. “Invite the others, we will drink and feast tonight!”
“No, please, keep it up,” the blonde finally said.
. You should know…I’m…bi,” she confessed.
When she started her period…well looking back it was hilarious.
“You’re fucking ridiculous, you know that?” he asked rhetorically, helping himself to some of the bed as he felt exhaustion begin to take him. “Hard to believe you’re the one.” He felt Clint stiffen next to him.
“So,” Steve began, “Rhodey said you had something to tell me,” he said gently. Tony scoffed out a laugh, grinning while thinking of that rat-bastard of a best friend.
the teen said in greeting, Tony feeling himself already smile at the dork.
“Tony. Why did you suggest that I should cheat on you? No jokes this time,” he said as he kept his husband’s gaze. The brunette threw his best puppy eyes, but Steve didn’t budge.
“Actually,” Tony said with a little bit of ire, fingers twitching to grab his phone, “I was under the impression it would be a two person lunch. You see, I didn’t want to be rude,” he finished with a look at Stane, who was still looking at the menu and ignoring the two as if they were bickering children.
“–okay, I get it. Sorry, I’m not…I’m not trying to overstep. Just saying in the grand scheme of things…”
And even though Bucky was exhausted, he couldn’t argue with that.
“Daddy!” the toddler cried as he ran towards the genius, who gladly picked the boy up into his arms before planting several kisses on his face.
“Excuse me?” Steve asked.
“She might as well be…” she mumbled into her arms.
"What about...Caesar?" he asked thoughtfully as he concentrated on juggling five kittens.
The game eventually ended, the Avengers winning by three runs as Steve sighed in relief, wanting to get to his best friend and away from the two short perverts. He should’ve known better, as Clint rushed past him and jumped into his boyfriend’s arms - just as Buck had barely made it out of the dugout.
Steve smiled at her, suddenly feeling incredibly protective over this kid he barely knew. He would need to tell Tony and Peter about it, call her social worker in the morning… and maybe do some breathing exercises to prevent him from murdering her foster parents. He showed her to one of the guest bedrooms before going to tell his boys the update.
Peter knew that was true, technically, but he couldn't control the anger welling up inside. He hadn't talked to him about it, how weird he'd been acting, because just when he thought he should the man was back to his old lovey dovey goofy self. He was a wonderful man, and thinking otherwise always made Peter feel guilty. Wade had enough insecurities, doubting him would only add whatever strain Peter was making up in his head.
“He’s right, Tony,” Steve began, turning to the three stunned individuals. He put the ingredients away and pulled out some cereal boxes in a high up cupboard. “Here, cereal for breakfast. After you’re finished you two can get started on cleaning every window on this floor. And scrubbing the bathrooms,” he said with a smile.
“So am I,” James said sincerely as he sat up and leaned against him.
Also, it was pretty much a straight shot train-wise to his office from school, minus an additional bus stop along the way. But she ended up getting a ride from Happy anyway – which was their way to compromise.
“Clint,” James growled out in a warning tone. “That’s not happening…”
“Am I missing the joke, here?” he asked with a hint of blush to his cheeks. She suddenly looked apologetic, moving to sit up fully before wincing in pain from the action.
"Alright, chill baby bro," Joey said with a frown, hands reaching up to steady their acrobatics.
“Well...that doesn’t really surprise me,” Steve said absently as they approached a frantic Tony.
She had woken up from a bad dream, which wasn't as scary as other but still made her feel sick in her stomach. Grabbing Wolf, she walked to her parent's room and gently opened the door. Her Tati was immediately alert but smiled and waved her over when he saw her. She hesitated when she got to his side of the bed, seeing how Clint was snoring and taking up the middle of the bed. But her Tati just gently grabbed her and placed her between the two. Her Daddy made some noises and just barely opened his eyes at the two. Daci held her breath, but quickly released it when the blonde wrapped his arms around her and pulled her into a hug.
“Those are giraffes!” Peter said, following her line of sight and pointing to the tall creatures.
The more words this girl learned, the harder it was to even try to argue with her. And when you’re an equally stubborn teenage male, it becomes a competition. Granted, it’s against a fourteen month old, but still.
“But…but you’re all sweaty,” Tony said with a frown. His husband laughed and proceeded to kneel before the man, resting his hands on Tony’s knees.
“Ruffians? Thugs? Whatever you call them…”
“Dada nap,” she said quietly.
“Oh, please. She’s
She was thirteen when she got her first period. Months after she lost her father and was still getting accustomed to life without him. Living with her uncle wasn’t that big of a change, as he had practically been her second parent her whole life. But he hadn’t had to be her sole guardian and therefore hadn’t planned on teaching her how to handle blood in her underwear.
“Oooh, right. I don’t actually give a shit about Barnes, neither did Dad,” she confessed easily, eyes still on the ceiling.
“Good to have you back, Captain” came the ever faithful AI when he stepped into the elevator.
Needed this.
She was furious at Cara and that fuckboy she’s still with.
"Momma said I was named after him. James was his first name, right Momma?"
“Yup, smart like his Daddy,” Tony said with a smile.
,” she said nonchalantly as Steve’s entire body froze, swearing he could feel his heart drop to his feet.
“Seriously, James?” she hissed at him as they finally made it to the door. The three peered inside seeing that a doctor was reading some results to Jo. Tony quickly brushed past his friends and entered the room, walking over to stand by his husband.
They shared a glance and smiled at each other, both overwhelmed but currently at peace with all of this. They’d find out in a few hours what was actually going on.
“You’re forgiven,” Tony said with a smile, biting his bottom lip.
They’ve been texting for a few days now, and Tony has never felt this way about...well, anyone.
his Pop muttered with teasing smile, getting him a glare and scoot from his husband. The blonde laughed aloud at the brunette's movement and reached out to pull him back onto his lap. Peter briefly saw his Dad cross his arms and pout before the teenager just closed his eyes, not wanting to watch the pair.
“Uncle Clint Uncle Buckyyyyy!”
The teen smiled before nodding, walking back with May to her car. They sat in silence until they made it her couch, the older woman grabbing two ciders for the pair.
“See, I was thinking before we go, you fuck me, then plug me up so I get to walk around all night with your cum inside me. Then, at some point tonight, we sneak off somewhere and you can just take me again. I’ll be all loose and ready for you,” he said as Steve gulped audibly thinking of the possibility.
After Clint tired the pup out chasing each other, he walked over and collapsed on the blanket next to the brunette. Lucky followed, promptly falling next to them and passing out asleep.
Life wasn’t a fairytale.
“Ah ha! So you
It took everything in the genius to stamp down his anger towards his ex.
“That shit cray,” she mumbled in agreement as she rested her face in her hand.
“We’re still cute,” Sarah argued, getting a giggle out of the teen as the three heard the doorbell ring. “Oh no, Joe must’ve ‘fished’ his keys into the lake again…”
Immediately dropping when he saw who it was.
The genius simply raised his eyebrows several times as Steve waited for him to explain.
If you would have told him a year ago he was going to his senior prom with a blonde guy, he would’ve guessed he lost a bet with Steve.
“I’m sorry, Pop. For the record, I
“Ah! I’m sorry! It was dangerous…and I could’ve died!” she hiccupped a sob between breaths, wondering if she could pass out from this kind of pain.
, if I remember correctly. Well, let’s hope you find your voice in court; cause you’re going to need it.” The man stood there gaping at him while Tony grabbed Joey’s arm to lead them away
“Okay,” Tony parroted, taking a deep breath before continuing. “I’m pregnant.”
“He didn’t give me details, just that you’re being dumb and it has to do with Steve.”
“I could call my husband, he has friends in high places but he’s in D.C. right now…”
The first day Sarah came home from the hospital, Tony was the one who kept trying to keep Joe and Steve from fussing over her as he wheeled her into her house.
“I’ll do it,” Miles threatened, trying to appear taller. He was six two and about the same height as the vigilante.
It took two days. Two days later when Steve was sitting in the living room with his drawing pad, Emerson came in to ask him a question.
“Sucker punching me was low, even for a trashy dyke like yourself…so I wanted to see if you’re free after school today. For a fair fight,” Staci said, finishing with her arms crossing her chest. Joey stared back at her, never really one to back down from a fight.
“Well you would know, liar!” they shouted together before erupting in laughter.
) is currently away on business but I am available to come down. I can be there in half an hour?”
“Tati I can go,” Daci said as she stood up, secretly liking the idea of dealing with the Hulk rather than crying babies.
“Nothing important,” he offered with a smile. She stared at him a moment longer, before dramatically rolling her eyes and wedging herself down further into the couch next to him.
“Sea mons’er,” she clarified before dunking herself underwater. When she came back up, sans bubbles, she reached over for her rubber ducky, pretending it was screaming at her in terror before she then pretended to eat it.
"You were with your Daddy, in his lab, late last night?" the taller father asked carefully. Their "oooOOOOOs" increased until their Dad gave them the cut-throat sign.
“- no, no cub,” he said as he gently shifted her around to face him on his lap. “Look at me,” he said gently, waiting for her to look up before continuing and not caring of the tears beginning to form in his own eyes. “
“I know it’s you, you son of a bitch. At least have the decency to face me.” Wade slowly turned around, still wearing that ridiculous fake mustache. He reached out to pull it off when Wade stepped back, preventing him.
told me not to reach out to her for money.” She looked shocked before her face morphed into a smile that produced a genuine laugh.
“Okay, thanks.”
“So you see?” Tony continued with a choked smile, gently breaking up the hug to give her room to breathe and look at them. “You’re not going anywhere. You are stuck with two dads and a brother for the rest of your life,” he said tucking some hair behind her ear.
“Let me rephrase that,” the woman said with a no-bullshit look, “you need a drink?” she finished with her hands resting on her hips in challenge.
“Fuck,” Bucky said quietly, licking his lips as Clint twirled around for him.
She took both the water and the pills Steve handed her, still not looking at either parent as she swallowed them. She finally responded, looking down at her lap.
“What about your messy room, Petey?” Tony asked. “Did you check there?”
“You done for tonight?” the blonde asked between attacking his lips and grabbing the man’s perfect bubble butt. Tony mumbled something that apparently Jarvis understood, as the lab effectively shut down around them. Steve took that as a yes and proceeded to walk the two all the way back to their bedroom, Tony kissing him the whole way.
And if it happened to be next to the brunette, well, Steve was just making sure he was participating in the conversation. To not be rude.
Bucky held Clint by his shoulders at arm-length, a mixture of emotions running through his system while the blonde just smiled dopily back at him.
His smile was starting to make his cheeks hurt as she easily melted into his hug, sighing dramatically against his chest.
“I asked you first,” his man teased. Steve huffed out a laugh, leaning against the counter as he considered his question.
can protect you. ‘Captain’s daughter getting an MIP’ is pretty fucking good ammunition to get you fired.”
“COMPLICATED?!?” she surprised herself with the volume of her own voice. It was at this moment she felt a strong hand gently grasp her shoulder. She turned teary eyed to her Pops who looked confused between the two.
So he blames his sleep deprivation when he was startled by a knock on their door late one afternoon.
“Cleaning supplies are in this closet,” he said, pointing to a small door visible in the hallway. “I’ll put on some tunes,” he continued as he walked to the touch screen along the wall. He decided on nineties pop when she came back with cleaning spray and towels.
Four year old Emerson was something else. Big, watery green eyes stared back at the men as her adult clothing shifted on her tiny child body. Her long brown hair hung in her beautiful face as she kept blinking back at the men – looking like she was expecting them to hit her any second...or worse.
“Sweetheart,” he heard his husband say. “You’re obviously in pain; let Steve look so he can help. We promise not to be angry until we’ve heard your side, in its entirety.” Steve looked away from her to gawk at his husband.
“Yo, Picasney? A little help here?” his brother asked exasperatedly. The blonde rolled his eyes from the nickname, responding by bringing his feet up on the couch and away from the child currently rolling on the floor in protest.
Joey sat there staring at her while the waitress brought their food.
BUCKY
“She’s so small! I thought I could outrun her easily,” she said with a pout before hitting him again when he erupted into more laughter. Steve reached a hand over to pinch his husband’s leg, reminding him to lay off as the genius yelped in surprise.
“What the fuck did you just say?” Clint asked, scrambling to stand on his feet and glare are his boyfriend. The bastard at least had the audacity to appear startled, Barney frozen next to the brunette as he looked back and forth between the two.
"Yeah, I think so too," she said with a blush.
“Now, why were you up little one, did you have a bad dream?” the blonde asked after releasing the two and taking a step back to look at Peter.
“What ‘bad word’ did it in for ya?” he asked with a smile.
“You’re gay,” he hissed at her while she rubbed her elbow.
She was led into a small room, only noticing there was already an occupant when Hill the Traitor closed the door behind her.
“She’s with SHIELD,” her father said in English. As if that meant she was supposed to suddenly trust this stranger.
“Harley, nothing between the legs. I don’t know what Pappy just told you…”
, right? And we’ll get through it together; like we have with all the bullshit that’s been thrown our way lately.” Tony laughed in agreement, unable to really conjure any other real emotion. Although…right now, he was just happy to be here with Steve.
Peter instantly relaxed, smiling as well at the picture of the cute baby girl.
“He said…he said he’d sell me if I was bad…” she whimpered out before bursting into tears. And Tony suddenly found himself (not for the first time, mind you) thankful that the rat bastard of a father was already long dead.
“Come on Em,” Peter said, offering a hand to help her off the couch. “Let’s go play video games before we’re scarred for life.”
She focused on Maria’s face and soothing words, ignoring the garble of noises coming from the other teenagers. When she could breathe again, but still leaking tears, the policewoman gently stood her up and led her out of the cell and down the hall.
“You don’t know that…”
is your latest arm-candy?” Sunset sneered out, glaring at Steve as Obie continued talking to Tony as if Steve wasn’t there.
Even his own parents, who they told over lunch at their mansion. His Mama burst into tears again, but this time with obvious tears of joy. His father, who was holding Harley in his lap, congratulated them before kissing the pup’s head.
