"He makes you think," Mary said with a smirk. "About more than yourself, or heaven forbid, even Peter."
“You’re not entirely sold on the whole idea of talking to someone else, a stranger really, about your problems.” Tony nodded to her, folding his glasses in his hands. “You wouldn’t be the first the think that, and you won’t be the last. Even with a celebrity status such as yours, that feeling can be amplified, along with other negative thoughts about it.” Tony slipped his glasses back on, not looking at the Doctor. “I actually wish that I saw more that are constantly in a spotlight sought out our services. It could really help coping mechanisms, a way to deal with the immense amounts of stress that come with life.”
“Nope,” he shook his head. “No more corruption. If they ever joined forces, we’d all be doomed.” Meg let out a huff of laughter.
"He shouldn't choose to be with someone like me. I've got anxiety attacks, and nightmares, and so many Daddy issues it's not funny," Tony moaned a little. "I'm already a father, and sure my son likes him, but that doesn't mean he's ready to be a dad-"
"I know that he'll never ask me out, so I need to woo him." Steve was sure in his actions. He wanted to get to know Tony Stark, wanted to know what made him tick, wanted to help build up the self-esteem that had been chipped at since he was a kid. Steve wanted to be there for Tony, to stay in his life, to keep that warm feeling in his chest whenever he saw Tony smile, or laugh, when Tony really just let himself be him. "I've got outside help, but I need an insider."
"When Tony became CEO, I went to him," Bruce said, not answering the question. That was answer enough for Steve. "I told him about my research and what Howard had been hoping for, but I didn't tell what Howard had planned to do with it."
“-and Mary said that at Peter’s last eye appointment, the Doc said that he might need glasses in another year or so.” Pepper’s mouth made a little ‘o’ shape and she nodded.
Peter turned and hugged Mary’s waist tightly and she bent down to kiss his cheeks. “You be good, don’t go wandering off, you know, all the rules I gave you with your grandparents. And remember, you still have to listen to Steve because he’s Captain America, but Captain America still listens to me.”
"We'll keep looking for other leads," Clint spoke up again. "That never stops. Like you said, they're unorganized, so we just find another one of their slip-ups and go from there."
"An attack just outside of Stark Industries doesn't stay quiet for long," she told him. "I'm trying to stay ahead of it, to keep Rachel and Mary's identity out of it, but there are a lot of reporters looking in to this. There are pictures of them from every smart phone within a three block radius popping up on social media, including one of you carrying Tony back into the Tower and refusing an ambulance for him."
"Tony? Peter?" Tony turned his head and saw Steve burst through the doors from the stairs, helmet pulled off, shield still in hand. He spotted them and jogged over, taking a knee next to them. "Are you two alright?"
"Not that it's any of your business, because I am an adult and you are not, but no, we didn't have sex. The sheets are clean." It was too early in the morning for this, specially with no coffee. "What do you get into when no one's looking?"
"He wasn't testing it," Maria said grimly. "He wasn't even in the room at the time." A cold tingle ran down Mary's spine at those words.
"It's what we've down the past two years," Mary said a little quietly. "It's been a while since they've had someone to spoil for Christmas-"
“Yes! That’s him!” Peter ran into living room before Tony could catch him, and Jamie wiggled in Steve’s arms. She was very attentive, and attracted to, Peter’s energy, almost channeling it. Tony was probably right, she was going to be very active as she grew up.
"Is that the only word?" Bruce asked carefully. It would be obvious that he would be nervous about coming on board a vessel with so many SHIELD agents around, so many opportunities to exploit the Hulk like so many others had tried to do. Or to take him down.
"I'm also a father," Tony said with a tiny smirk. He looked between the two boys. "Alright, you've got a deal." He put his hands out, each boy shaking one of them. Jamie let out a coo, then was finally able to reach and pat Peter's leg with both of her hands.
"I can't imagine why he would stop responding to you after that." Bruce gave Tony a deadpanned expression.
“Papa!” Peter snugged down into the space between Tony and Steve, hugging the blonde, careful of Jamie, even though she giggled. “Are you staying home?”
Steve hummed and pushed himself closer, kissing the end of Tony's nose. "All because you brought me flowers. You're so cheesy, Rogers." He couldn't help but smile when Steve did. His expressions were contagious. "I don't even like flowers, so, you were right earlier, I'm not a flowers kind of guy. But those one, downstairs in my lab? I fucking love those flowers, because they were picked with me in mind, not bought in a store, and it looks like you just threw them in whatever glass container you could find in the office, because it was the thought of the flowers that mattered more."
Tony's eyes were a little wide, his mouth hanging open slightly, shocked at the words that were aimed for him. Steve moved from the front of the punching bag, standing in front of Tony and putting his hands on Tony's shoulders. "You are an amazing man, and I'm sorry that I may have indirectly lead you to buy into the thoughts that you aren't."
“Of course I tried!” Howard exclaimed. “I tried for years, but they never responded to anything that I did. There was no other conclusion than to say that they were corrupted. I figured they had been damaged in his last mission.”
"Pop culture is becoming easy, but I'm still slow on the tech," Steve said, watching Tony closely. He turned suddenly, throwing the shield, watching it ricochet off the building and into the three approaching men.
Starting to touch on Iron Man 2 in this story, but only parts. Now I'm really starting to mess with things and the timeline, but it should be fun. I brushed over some parts because they would have been identical to the movie, (like Pepper becoming CEO, and Tony seeing Natalie Rushman and hiring her under Pepper's nose), so I went right to the good stuff. Next chapter might be longer, some fun stuff is going to happen!
Dum-E rolled up, a bottle of green liquid in its claw, and Tony easily accepted it, taking a large drink. Mary was used to drinking some strange stuff, and she just raised a concerned eyebrow at him. "It's not alcohol," Tony told her, even though he knew that wasn't what she wanted to hear.
"When I've figured out what I'm going to do, I'll show it to you," Tony said, finishing with Peter's clothes. He opened an empty drawer to put Wade's stuff in. "Make it easier when we get to head over there. I think it was mostly the top floors that were damaged anyway. Little bit of superficial damage on the ground floors."
“He said it to me, too!” Wade piped up. Tony looked at Steve and pointed to Wade, as if somehow proving a point. Steve just let out a little sigh.
Tony pursed his lips a little, then drew them together tightly, fighting off the tingle and burn that moved up towards the back of his eyes. Why would he feel the need to tear up at this? Oh, right, because until Tony had a son, these were some of the nicest things that Tony could ever remember being told to him. The only other person he had heard something like this from was Jarvis, the live man, when he was just a little boy.
Tony held up his hands and took a step back. "What do I know, I'm not a SHIELD Agent. I've leave this to experts, because you know what? I was working just fine by myself before Fury decided to put his little organization into my life." He turned around and stalked out, anger fueling every step. Bruce hopped up from his seat to try and follow Tony.
Peter jumped to his father’s side as if magnetized. “So can Mr. Steve be my new babysitter? Pleeeeease? I’ll make you ‘sketti if you say yes!” the little boy begged, grabbing fistfuls of his dad’s suit jacket and tugging insistently.
“But I wanna go to aftercare and draw with Ned and see Mr. Steve,” the boy sighed, wrapping his tiny arms around his father’s neck.
“Yeah, the middle finger never seems to pop up fast enough when I’m around my roommate,” Bucky sighed, leaning over to look inside the arm along with Tony.
“Of course,” Sam nodded, hoping he’d got through to Steve, but knowing that probably wasn’t the case. “Just promise me you’ll think about what I said?”
“Maybe, but all you’d have to do is flash those sad, blue eyes and flutter those pretty lashes and she’d let you go free.”
“Happy, right? You pick up Peter in the afternoons,” Steve asked politely, trying his best not to gawk at the red head who stood directly next to the man he was speaking with.
Tony wished he could sue the shit out of whoever took this picture, but it technically hadn’t broken any rules. Peter’s face was obscured in the picture, there was no telling if it was actually his son or not, despite that line of thinking being entirely braindead. Of course it was his son, why the fuck would he be holding some other random six year old from the Community Center?
“It’s ‘by the time you get married,’ bubba,” Tony couldn’t help but chuckle. Peter was saying the exact same thing he did whenever the kid fell over and got hurt. “But I appreciate it.”
Besides, it was good for him to get out of his apartment. The fresh air and sunshine would do him some good.
“Bye, Peter,” Pepper smiled, blowing the six year old a quick kiss before grabbing one of Tony’s bags despite his protests. “Shut it, we’re going to go load up the plane. You go brief the babysitter, then meet us there, you have five minutes.” she muttered, giving the genius a pointed look.
“Well how on Earth could I say no to that?” Steve tossed his hands up in defeat. “Now I have to say yes, just so I can be your sidekick.”
Tony’s head snapped around to look at the single strap that had, indeed, caught up in the door slamming fiasco.
"Oh, really? A good surprise, I hope?" Tony couldn't stop smiling, he really had missed his boy while he was away.
Natasha seemed to consider this, glaring at the still surface of the half-frozen body of water in front of her to the blonde man beside her.
"Hey, spidermonkey!" Tony grinned, catching his son and tossing him up into the air before squeezing him in a tight hug.
“Nooo, daddy! Real cookies!” Peter ignored his father’s affronted gasp as he crammed his tiny fingers between the lid and the container to try and pry the top off. “He made them from scratch, like with flour and eggs, not a bag of cookie dough.”
“Would you two shut the hell up! I’m not doing anything untoward with Stark!” Steve looked five seconds from tearing his hair out. “The guy felt guilty for leaving his son home alone so often that he promised to do whatever the kid wanted on Valentines. It just happened to be hanging out with me after aftercare one day.”
Tuesday just hadn’t been the right time to talk. Timing was important with these things if he actually wanted a chance to get through to Tony.
An object in motion stays in motion while an object at rest tends to stay that way. If the blonde keeps working, then there’s no possible chance he’ll stop and think about the things he’s avoiding.
So, built like a brick shithouse, handsome as the devil, good with kids, a national hero, and disgustingly humble as a cherry on top of the lab-made man before him.
Steve fell silent again, obviously debating with what to say as the two men sitting on the couch across from him raised their eyebrows.
Today was probably the best way to do it, anyway. It was more than enough time after Monday’s fiasco, and since it was Friday, Tony would have time to thoroughly think through what he had to say over the weekend.
“Alright, well. If that’ll be all, Mr. Stark?” Natalie asked, already slowly backing up towards the elevator.
It had been a jumping spider down in the lab and it had bit him four months ago, Peter had cried until Tony had created an entire story about how it was secretly a special spider and that it would give him super strength and webs.
Tony, not one to deny his son what he wanted, (especially after business trips) followed the energetic boy towards his bedroom. His eyes couldn’t help but take one final glance at Steve before he was pulled away.
Tony hadn’t been lying about a short drive. It took under ten minutes to get there from the Rec Center, and with New York traffic that was saying something.
“Woah, hold on. Now THAT’S interesting,” Bucky shot up, nearly falling out of his chair with how quickly he leaned forward. The drinks rocked dangerously. “Are you telling me THE Tony Stark was hitting on you? Right in front of his kid?”
“Perfect timing,” she hummed, putting her cell away in satisfaction. “Something just popped up, I’ve got work to do. Have a good rest of your afternoon, and don’t think so hard. You’ll wrinkle your pretty little face.”
“I swear I get no respect around here!” Tony huffed, casually placing the drawing face down on the desk and pointedly ignoring the concerned look Steve cast in his direction. “Well, let’s try ‘em then. They better be damn near perfect or there’ll be hell to pay.”
“Don’t worry, puddin’ pop. You’re on the Super Special A-Team,” Tony reassured the boy, crouching down to be eye level with him.
“Language!” The teacher said on instinct. This hadn’t been the first time one of his students had cursed in his room, but none of the other offenders had said it so loudly or to their parents. Certainly none of them had been a typically well-mannered first grader before all this either.
They made it through half the batch of cookies and almost two episodes of the show before Tony cleared his throat, signaling to his AI to turn the volume down. It was time, he had stalled long enough. The two of them had to talk about what was going on between the two of them.
Both boys had finished their art projects for the day and were scribbling onto printer paper with crayons, babbling about what their costumes would look like if they were heroes. The veteran could hear the two of them discussing backstories from where he stood at the sink, rinsing out the watercolor cups and setting them aside to dry with the paint brushes.
“Well, another fun fact about Captain Rogers is that he’s the world’s most heinous child murderer. All his victims were the young sons of famous billionaires,” Rhodey droned, knowing his friend wasn’t comprehending a single word. “The craziest part? All of them were named Peter.”
“Oh, come on. Don’t act like that, I’ve heard you make some mean spaghetti and meatballs,” The blonde shrugged.
“Yes, yes, it’s all very life and death right now. I understand,”Tony waves his hands through the air before picking his glass back up for another sip while he begins to pace. “It starts at twelve, be there fifteen minutes early, and it’s a lunch meeting at some stuffy bistro downtown. Happy?”
“Now tell us what’s been bothering you, man,” Sam was using what everybody deemed as his therapy voice. It was a soft tone of voice that he used when he wanted somebody to open up to him, and as much as his friends teased him for it, the voice never failed to goad them into bearing their souls. Bucky despised it.
“You better stop talking or I’m going to hurl all over you and this fancy, new-fangled arm,” Barnes growled. “And you can’t say shit, not when you’re mooning over Steve of all people.”
“You’re welcome, Captain!” Peter saluted to his teacher. “You can be my sidekick and help me defeat Mr. Bubbles, ok? Here, take this shield so you can protect yourself.” the boy handed him a tiny, plastic shield from his knight halloween costume he wore a few years prior.
“Didn’t want Miss Nat!” He yelled, frustrated tears slipping down his face as Tony scooped him up into his arms.
Her phone chirped where it sat in her front pocket and she pulled it out to squint at the message on her screen.
“I wanted to make this weekend special for us. Something to make up for how absent I’ve been lately,” Tony folded his arms, slumping back against the edge of the counter behind him. “We were supposed to have FUN this weekend. Now you’ve gone and scheduled all these meetings and-”
“If you would go put the cookies away before they bring ants into your room,” Tony grinned, handing the plastic box back over to his son who shot a grumpy look back, but still went to do as he was told.
“Uh-uh. I thought the only kinda paints that there was, was just, like, um, finger paints and stuff,” Peter explained as he reached out to poke at the dry, red paint. “Do you use it like chalk?”
“It’s sort of like finger paints, except these you have to make the paint yourself,” Steve picked up a brush and dunked it into the water. “What color did you want to use first?” The blonde man asked, offering the wet brush to Peter.
Peter sat there, glaring stubbornly at the space in front of him, obviously thinking over his options. It wasn’t long before the boy stuck his nose up in the air, scooted his chair back up to the table, and picked up a marker to resume coloring. His decision had been made.
Peter dragged his brush against the top edge of the page and gasped as the paint on the brush turned it blue. “Wooooah, it worked! How does it do that, Mr. Steve?”
“But that’s different. I can handle that. But you’re working outside the law, Natasha. There are rules. You have to follow them.”
?” Loki sneered the last word, like it was poison, making Thor flinch. Loki had been very vocal about not considering Thor his brother, now that they both knew Loki was adopted. His disdain for Thor was evident in everything he did. But Thor would never give up on Loki, no matter what.
Tony beamed at him. “That’s the spirit. Nat’s right, though. The tactic we’re using now isn’t working. We need to take the gauntlet off of him. Any suggestions on how to get it off?”
“I know. I just think people’s personal life should be private. I didn’t want to talk about it unless you were okay with it.”
Six years later, Natasha was bone tired after stepping off the plane from the long case she had been working on. A case that ended brutally and unhappily for pretty much everyone involved. In the end, they’d caught the perp, but that didn’t erase all the damage he’d caused or the people’s lives he’d taken and ruined.
"Essentially," Jane said, "other worlds exist. And somehow Tony cracked the secret of travelling between them. This isn't science fiction anymore. It's real."
He waited and waited as on the surface his teammates called in Fury, appraised him of the situation, and what they were going to do about it. Vision kept immaculate control of him and they hung out in space until Fury reached their hideout. They came back down again. Fury’s expression was thunderous as he took in Thanos, his missing hand, his bashed in face. Then he scoffed.
Clint grasped the stone, and thought about Natasha. He instantly found himself in the in between. It was an empty, black void, devoid of anything he thought the soul world would look life. It was just him and the blackness and his endless thoughts of Natasha.
"Wrong answer. Come on, Nat. I'd really like to meet the guy my 17 year old daughter is spending all her time with. It would make me feel a whole lot safer if I knew him."
"Uh, no. You're actually a 17 year old high school student and Natasha's best friend who happens to be deaf."
Once Tony and Steve made their way to the hospital, they went straight to Bucky’s room. The only two people currently in the room were Natasha and Peggy, and since the hit and run incident both had been informed of the crazy world jumping fiasco happening. Granted, Natasha already knew and had met the other Tony when they had switched places.
Tony sat himself down on the couch as his body shuddered violently. “Ugh, that guy gives me the creeps,” he muttered.
Thor was about to respond when Vision interjected. “Clint, Thor may be right. His sceptre was mind controlling you, but who was to say that by holding it, it was also mind controlling him?”
“I won’t challenge you for the throne. Asgard is yours. I’ve been spending more time on Earth with Jane and the Avengers, and it’s begun to feel like home.”
“I can’t do it without physical contact,” she said. “I’ll need to be right there, where my magic can reach his mind.”
"Look," Natasha said. "I know we aren't close. And you're still pissed I posed as your secretary in order to evaluate you. Hell, you're probably pissed I didn't recommend you for the Avengers. But we've been through shit together. We're a team now. And I defend my team. And if you need to talk, I'm here. I'm not the most warm or fuzziest person, but I'm a good listener, and I tell things to you straight. If you ever find yourself needing that, I'm just two floors away."
Matt snorted. “You’re not getting information out of his boyfriend. Are you insane? It was one thing when you wanted to deal with Anatoly and Vladimir, okay? I get it. You guys are Russian. They might have known your family. They might have talked to you and trusted you. You could have infiltrated their ranks. Dealing with Wesley is going to get you on his radar. You can’t get past him and Nobu if you want to live. They’ll tear you apart.”
With a sigh, Tony plopped down on the couch right next to Steve and sank deep into the cushions. Steve handed him the plate of pasta he made, and Tony dug right into it. Steve noted the way his eyes turned to glance at Natasha and Clint drinking his beer, but how Tony didn’t indulge himself. Curious, for Tony to be completely sober. Steve wondered if he’d ever seen a truly sober Tony in all the years he’d known him. There was a first for everything, wasn’t there?
Tony smirked. "Yeah." He looked over at Steve, remembering how the tiny man could fold into him, how his hands dwarfed Steve, how much he loved being able to count the man's ribs with his fingertips. Steve wouldn't be Steve anymore if he weren't small and skinny.
Tony snorted. “Just try us, asshole. We’re not as hard to get rid of as one might think. After all, we have the stones of power.”
"But...I'm not actually married to Steve. Does Steve even exist in this world? Are we even together?" Tony felt panic dredge itself up, stick in his throat. He doubled over in the chair, trying to gain purchase of himself, to breathe clearly. Goddamn it. He hated these stupid panic attacks.
No, he wasn’t going to get drunk tonight. He wasn’t going to make things worse by leaving his son for the third time in a week. He’s Tony fucking Stark and he’s not going to sit here throwing a pity party for any longer than he already has.
Yes, at a passing glance you could imagine the two were related. With similar messy brown hair and a slightly shorter than average stature, there were a couple of common traits. The eyes were what made them undeniably connected to one another. They both had wide, expressive, brown eyes that lit up like lights on a Christmas tree the moment they were in front of something that excites them.
He had asthma, he was deaf in one ear, poor eyesight, a weak immune system, and on top of that: he was tiny.
“I have webs, though. I can tie up bad guys an - and I can swing from buildings,” Peter explained, clinging tight to his father as he stood up from his chair.
“Sure, no nightmares,” She muttered, giving him a skeptical look before giving in and turning back to the pond. “What is there to talk about?”
The sound of his kid’s excited chattering fading into the background as Tony glared up at the ceiling, wondering just how in the hell he’s going to ask Mr. Rockin’ Bod Renaissance to dinner with him and six year old son without making it sound like he’s totally hitting on him.
“Hmmm, nope! My dad says he has-ta meet Ned’s parents first before we can hang out together, but he’s SO busy doing super important business man stuff that he still hasn’t talked with them yet,” Peter explained, scribbling down the name ‘Spiderman’ in messy handwriting next to his drawing.
“Maybe,” Steve sighed, flopping back onto the ratty old couch that’s been residing in this apartment since before the dawn of time. “Buck at work already?”
Peter would be hungry when he woke up, and a home cooked meal would do him some good. Not that it took a certified genius to boil pasta and toss jarred sauce and frozen meatballs into a pot, but for all that Tony could build a machine in the dark with both hands tied behind his back, the man knew fuck all about cooking.
“Maybe one for Ned,” Peter mumbled, sitting up from where he had been slouched over. “Maybe one for Unca Rhodey, too.”
I'm not dead! I'm sorry this took so long, but I got caught up in school and all that jazz. Now that I've got my college application stuff rolling I'm less stressed and I've started writing again, yay! I'm not sure if I'll have a chapter out every week like I did during the summer, but I'll try and post to this story every other week. If you're just dying for something to read, though, I'm also writing a sequel to my spiderman spring break fic and will update that inbetween chapters of this fic. Maybe, depends on how much homework I have lmao.
“You know what’s not appropriate? How tight that shirt is,” The genius huffed. “I mean did you buy it a couple sizes too small on purpose or do your muscles just do that-”
So, with an air of professionalism that Sam would pat him on the back for and Natasha would roll her eyes at, the teacher handed off the backpack to Peter and wished him a good evening.
Right away Steve was hit with a rush of noise that had his hand shooting up to adjust the volume on the hearing aid in his left ear, the combination of about forty different conversations taking place and music playing over the restaurant speakers overwhelming him instantly. The settings for a quiet classroom were too sensitive for a bustling diner like this.
“I...girlfriend? I don’t-what, I’m sorry, us?” Steve struggled to find the words to explain just how terrible and insulting he found this entire situation. He’s seen this man approximately six times and never for longer than fifteen minutes. Never with anything but a cool, cordial attitude he saved for disagreeable parents. How on Earth could someone who was rumoured to be one of the top minds in the world possibly come to the conclusion that Steve would be amenable to a date when-
The genius had to stop himself from physically recoiling. “Rogers?” he asked incredulously. “You want to hang out with Mr. Rogers? Are you sure?”
“Noooo! I don’t want no dumb babysitter! Don’t want Natalie! I want you to be home but you’re always gone!” Peter was still shoving Tony, over and over as frustrated tears filled his eyes.
“What she said,” Happy mumbled as he took her place in the elevator, closing the doors behind him, presumably to take Tony’s bag up to the penthouse.
Apparently the talk with Ned’s parents had gone better than expected, and Tony would be leaving with both Ned and Peter this afternoon. Ned had pulled a note from his parents to show Steve and everything. It would have been terribly inconsiderate to embarrass the genius in front of both of his students, so the art teacher gave the boys a big grin and made them promise that they wouldn’t get into too much trouble.
“You are 100% correct, what was I thinking? Of course that’s J, looks just like him. He’ll be so happy to know you were thinking of him,” Tony pointed to the smile drawn on the sun in the corner of the page. “Is this like the sun from the Teletubbies? You put a baby face on your sun, punk?”
The puppy eyes were forgotten entirely and the blonde’s irritation was back full-force. “Nothing. I just wanted to let you know that you shut one of Peter’s bag straps in the car door.”
“Fine,” she sighed, leaning back into the bench. “But only since this whole thing is just because of your huge crush on Stark.”
It would have been weird for the blonde to waltz up and interrupt their play-date planning and call Tony a hack parent and ruin maybe the one good thing he’s seen him do for Peter. He’d have that chat tomorrow.
For half a second the billionaire wished he hadn't gone through such extensive lengths to keep his son's identity hidden from the public. It's not that he was ashamed, he just wanted his son to grow up as far from the spotlight as possible. That meant a restraining order on the press that would end in a lawsuit if any pictures of his kid ended up in the papers or the news.
“Uhhhh...blue. I wanna do blue first,” He took the brush, looking up to Steve for further instruction.
Peter had been rather grumpy in the morning, it wasn’t all that surprising seeing as he was usually a bit more subdued after Tony spent the weekend working.
“Well?” Bucky motioned for the other to keep talking. “Have any of them put the moves on you, Mr. Prude?”
“Of course, it doesn’t matter, right?” Nat asked, standing up and brushing herself off. “Since you definitely don’t have a crush on Stark, all of that stuff is pointless.” She had the smallest hints of a smug smile on her face as she stared down at a stunned Steve.
It’s not like you get to see the whole picture when you only meet-up with somebody once a month for an hour. Bucky’s free to call and come in whenever if there’s any problems with the arm whatsoever, but Tony’s not stupid. He knows Barnes would never do that and barely gets through these small appointments as it is.
Tony quickly swiped up the first pair of car keys he came across and hopped the elevator down to the garage. He thanked himself for the high quality elevators that got him from the top floor in the tower to the basement in less than a minute. It took another minute for him to figure out which car he had taken the keys from and by the time he was speeding out of the tower it was nearly six already.
The blonde peeked up out of his arms to shoot his friend a scathing look. "Oh, really, Buck? Do enlighten me."
While he may have nudged his resume into a more favorable light for the job, Steve really did enjoy every afternoon he spent working here and had done better than the previous art teacher had, according to the staff.
“Hey, I’m not complaining!” Tony pushed past the quiet, somber mood and tried to smile widely. “Lasers are much cooler than that hideous thing. Rogers totally got the short end of the stick here.”
“He qualified to work on aged beauties like this?” Tony was bent at the waist, taking in all that he could of the bike without getting on his hands and knees to peer into the guts of the machine. It looked like he was about five seconds from doing that anyways, expensive suit be damned.
“I have a babysitter!” It seems that Peter had finished his maze. “Her name is Miss Nat and she’s real pretty.”
Therapy had helped, obviously. But it came with the unattractive side effect of giving Bucky the ability to psychoanalyze everything that Steve was doing.
"This is the third time you've set me to snooze, sir. If you don't get up soon you might be late to-"
“In your dreams, Stark,” Bucky snickered, walking backwards so he can flip the genius off with said arm as he walks backwards to the door. “Until next month?”
“No, I mean...I’m sorry that I haven’t been home lately. It’s not fair for me to be out at work so much,” Tony tried to push through the uncomfortable. “I know you were upset with me this afternoon and I want to know what I can do to make it better.”
“Oh, please,” Nat rolled her eyes. “Between work and spending time with his son, Tony doesn’t have the time to meet anybody, let alone make time for regular dates with them.”
“Daddy!!! You said anything!” Peter whined, puppy dog eyes in full force. “I’ll be so good, an’, an’ we can get those cheeseburgers you like an’ we do it right after art, pleeeease daddy!”
She looked the same as she always did when they met up. Never leaving home without her leather jacket, it had practically become a feature of her person just like her fiery, red hair and guarded green eyes. It’s part of what had been so jarring in seeing her dressed up with a skirt and blouse in Tony’s house.
Steve had made more than enough well meaning mistakes in his life, but this might just take the cake.
“It’s absolutely stunning, Pete. We’ll have to show them as soon as possible and not a second later. It’s decided,” Tony nodded like it was official business, making his son giggle. He pointed to the orange blob floating to the left of Pepper. “What’s this?”
“No thanks necess-ses-ses-ary, mister. You can just gimme some of your cookies,” the boy nodded, letting go of his toy for a second as he climbed into the seat next to his dad and began to eat.
“Right away, sir,” JARVIS replied, pulling up a holo-screen in front of the man and flipping through news articles about SI until he found the most recent one about Tony Stark himself. “There seems to be another article about Peter, I’m afraid.”
Peter passed out cookies to both the adults, then grabbed one himself. (After contemplating which in the box had the most chocolate chips in it, of course.) The three ate in silence, the youngest amongst them completely oblivious to the tension in the room.
“He’s just lonely. I don’t regret moving out, it was good for me,” Bucky rolled his shoulder when Tony was done, glad to stretch out his shoulder and back now that he didn’t have to sit still anymore. “But I can’t say it doesn’t worry me to think of him living all by himself in that shitty, old apartment.”
Natalie stood up from the couch and made her way over towards the billionaire. “Mr. Stark, welcome back. How were your meetings?”
“Good on ya, J,” the genius mumbled around a yawn, getting ready to stumble through a lightning fast shower so he could fall into bed and get a couple hours of shut eye before he went to pick up his son. Maybe he shouldn’t have been up so late the last few nights, but while in Vegas…
But, lo and behold, the monday after their Valentine’s day dinner, Tony rang him up and asked if Steve would be available to watch his son over the weekend.
His trip to the park had been meant to clear his mind, pull him out of thoughts. Now all he could do was think, albeit about better things than this morning. He had came her to clear the air with Natasha, not to have his feelings for Tony questioned and become even more confused than he-
“Firstly, bold of you to assume I’m not already planning on how to defile a national treasure like that,” the genius hadn’t actually made any concrete plans to seduce Rogers, but the sputtering his best friend did over the phone after he had said that was worth the minor fib. “And, secondly, I’m not going to do that because he seems like just the type of boy-next-door to get awkward after sleeping together, and I’m not doing that to Peter.”
The boy seemed to deflate the slightest bit. “Daddy’s on a business trip right now, so unca Happy has-ta pick me up again.” It was quiet for half a moment before Peter perked up again, almost like he was trying to shake his disappointment off of him. “But when Happy watches me for the night we get to order in pizza and I can stay up late!”
Surprisingly the entire building hadn't burst at its seams from their chaotic energy, but they'd had some close calls from what the artist had heard.
“You’re truly a card, Barnes,” Tony muttered, still refusing to look up from where he was busy at work, much to Bucky’s dismay.
“Yeah, a real boy-next-door type too. He’s perfectly qualified, he works with kids for a living,” Tony explained, waving his hands dismissively.
“Woah, Peter! Look, it’s Tony Stark!!” Ned called out, the teacher could hear the legs of his chair scraping against the flooring as he stood up quickly.
“Not getting - no! Nat, no. That’s not what this is about at all,” Steve should have known Natasha would find a way to shake him. Deflecting was practically second nature to her, especially when it came to talking about things she didn’t want to.
“Give it to me straight, Doc. Are you going to have to amputate?” Bucky asked where he sat on the exam table in front of Tony.
“Would you calm it with the air quotes stuff. It’s super obvious you have a hard-on for Stark,” Bucky rolled his eyes like Steve was somehow being the unreasonable one.
“Mr. Stark, please!” the teacher’s face was flushed red and the previous angry look on his face was now a mix of confusion and embarrassment as the blonde struggled to comprehend what was happening right now.
“A new sitter? And you trust this mystery man with the life of your son for three days?” she questioned incredulously. “Who are you and what have you done with Tony?”
“Are you ready to go yet, Tony?” A new voice called from the elevator. In rushed Pepper Potts, CEO of Stark Industries. She was scrolling at something on her tablet distractedly as she strut over to Tony. Behind her trailed two others, the man who regularly picked Peter up from daycare and - oh, no way...it couldn’t be.
“As nice as that would be,” She slapped Tony’s hands away from the elevator controls. “I can’t just go firing any slimey old man who calls me pretty in a condescending tone of voice.” Pepper gestured to the living area of the penthouse as the doors opened in front of them. “After you.”
“I’ve had it for years and it hasn’t stopped working yet,” Steve countered, feeling just a bit defensive over his lack of knowledge relating to anything technical while in front of a certified genius.
The rest of class went by without a hitch, the teacher beginning to doubt that the first grader had ever been in a bad mood at all. Maybe he had read too much into it and the boy just had a case of the Mondays.
“I don’t even know what you’re talking about, Nat. Please enlighten me,” Steve huffed, crossing his arms against his chest defiantly. He was unwilling to believe the words coming out of her mouth.
The blonde had been over the moon to finally fight alongside Bucky, but when he got to camp he had realized he might never get the chance. Over half the regiment had been captured by the opposing side, a dangerous organization named Hydra, with no chance of getting them back. Or so Colonel Phillips had stated. It was hard for Rogers to take those odds lying down. So, with the help of Agent Carter, a pompous tech genius he didn’t care much for, and a small plane, he parachuted down onto enemy lines.
The tentative friendship they’ve formed began when Tony, who rambled enough for the both of them during the check-ups, made a joke that finally pulled a reaction out of Bucky. Not a large one, mind you, but the small scoff and roll of his eyes had felt like full belly laughter from the silent man before him. Now the two of them could banter back and forth, and the engineer was delightfully surprised at how well the mechanic could keep up with him.
“You’re not in trouble, Pete. I’m just curious,” Tony nodded, rubbing a hand up and down his back, trying not to betray how anxious the idea of Steve knowing made him.
Tony had thought about warning the babysitter before he got home, but after witnessing what he did, he was glad he didn’t. There was something about seeing the man interacting with the light of his life and making Peter smile like it was nothing that made him feel like a ridiculous teenage girl. Natalie hadn’t been a bad babysitter in the slightest, but she certainly hadn’t been on the same level of dedication as Steve helping his son create a mini city in the living room for Peter to play superhero in.
“Ned said that once he gets his Death Star that he’s gonna bring me to his house and we’re gonna build it together,” Peter said from where he still sat at the table, finishing his drawing up.
“And you said yes??” Bucky looked more amused than he should have. “You dumb fucking boy scout. You know you’re allowed to say no to people, right?”
“So he needs an eccentric billionaire to fill up the place, I see where this is going,” Tony nodded sagely. “You want me to be your bestie’s sugar daddy, I completely understand now.”
“That’s a dirty trick, and you know it, Stark. How am I supposed to say no to the puppy dog eyes?” Steve scoffed, unable to hide the smile that crossed his face when he saw Peter peering up at him from the booth seat with wide eyes and his bottom lip jutted out in a fake pout.
“Since Valentine’s Day is this Friday, we’re going to spend this week making all sorts of fun, Valentine’s themed things. You can make cards, or decorations, or anything you’d like as long as it has to do with the holiday,” Steve informed the class in front of him, gesturing to the multitude of different crafting materials spread out across the back counter. “I’ve already got a bunch of supplies out, but if there’s anything else you think you need, just let me know!”
“Depends,” she hummed, looking out to the pond that was only starting to defrost after a long, cold winter. “Are we talking about what happened at Stark’s or the fact that you’re not getting any sleep at night?” She gave him a sharp, knowing look.
“That’s ridiculous. I can just look at Jarvis’ feeds on my Starkphone. I don’t need you to send me updates,” Tony insisted despite some of the tension leaking out of the line of his shoulders as soon as Steve had brought up the idea.
Maybe it was in the way he could tell Steve's been holding back in every conversation they've had since first meeting, or the multitude of trust issues Tony's gathered through the years. There was something more there.
“He works at Stark Industries and he helps make all the cool science tech stuff that helps out the whole world, he’s the coolest!” Peter threw his hands up to emphasize just how incredible he found his father. “Sometimes, if I’m good, he lets me into the labs to help out on weekends. He calls me his tiny intern, which I think means like a super special work buddy.”
“Any particular reason you chose our place to wander aimlessly in, or did you just need an excuse to hang?” Sam drawled, leaning across the armrest of the couch.
“Yeah, I really like cookies,” he hummed, eyes still glued to the TV as he fished a small hand around blindly for another one.
“Oh, can it, you big baby. You’ve never fit the damsel distress stereotype and you’re not going to start now,” Tony could practically hear the sound of Rhodey rolling his eyes. “If that’s all you need from me, I’ve got some real important shit to be doing right now.”
“I asked if you had any plans tonight, Johnny Bravo,” Tony sighed like he hadn’t just said something straight out of the teacher’s nightmares. “I get it if you’ve got some little girlfriend or whatever waiting for you at home since it’s good ol’ Saint Hearts day, but if you’re free I’d really appreciate you coming to dinner with us.”
“Don’t get too starstruck, Platypus, or I’m gonna start getting jealous. What, you got a crush on America’s Sweetheart over here, or something?” Tony teased.
It was all a part of an after school program that the Rec Center organized, almost like a daycare but with activities to do instead of just a room full of toys for the kids to go crazy with.
“Oh, wait! Daddy, I wanna show you somethin’!” Peter wiggled down out from his father’s arms and shot across the art room towards the drying racks. “Mr. Steve, is it ok if I take my painting home tonight?” The boy stopped inches away from swiping yesterday’s painting, turning to aim a pair of puppy eyes at the teacher.
There was a brief interlude where Peter spent a minute peeking out from behind the chair, jerking back behind it whenever his father moved. Tony figured he should sweeten the deal to really put his plan into motion.
“Peter and I, yeah.” Tony was shifting around, from his arms hanging loosely to his sides to folded across his chest to shoved in his pockets. On anybody else it would have looked fidgety, but that was ridiculous. Tony Stark didn’t fidget. “It’s nothing serious. Don’t worry, Fortunato. I’m not bringing you home for a private wine-tasting in my basement anytime soon. I figured we’d just grab burgers at the joint down the road and then I’ll be out of your hair for a long time.”
“Har-dee-har-har, you’re fuckin’ hilarious,” Steve groused, glaring at the empty space in front of him. “Why do I even talk to you? This is harassment and ableism, you know that right?”
“I hate to break this to you, Mr. James B. Barnes, but the thing was already cut clean off when we found you,” Tony explained in a grave voice as he spread out his tool kit in the empty space next to Bucky.
“No I think we’ll give our golden boy a heart attack. What do you think?” Tony hummed, loosening his tie and popping the top couple of buttons of his dress shirt.
Usually when Tony got back from business trips he was met with excitement and one of those heart-warming hugs that made every trial and tribulation worth it. This time, it was radio silence from his son who was sitting in the living room fiddling with his toy cars.
Just that small movement had Natalie’s attention the same as if Tony had jumped onto the counter and screamed, and wasn’t that interesting?
What, with Stark running into Ned’s parents and immediately throwing himself into a conversation with them. Which had been a surprise for not only Steve, but Mr. and Mrs. Leeds, as well. There were twin looks of shock written across their faces as someone who they’d only seen on a television screen beforehand was asking if their son could come over tomorrow and build a Lego Death Star.
“Old! I’m sorry, did you just call me old?!” Stark yelled, setting him down and pretending to shake the boy by his shoulders. “I’m in the prime of my life! Why on earth are you calling me old?”
Tony sighed, slumping on the island. He took a minute to rest there and try to breathe through the stress headache and jet lag currently joining forces to wreak havoc inside of his skull. Like a switch had been flicked, suddenly the genius wasn’t hungry anymore and was feeling like he could sleep for days.
“I’ll have to make one for Liz, she’s a fourth grader and she has really pretty hair. If I make her one I should probably make some for her friend Betty too, though…” Peter continued to babble to himself about who he’s making gifts for as he wandered to the counter to grab construction paper and glitter glue.
Tony rolled his eyes and straightened back up. While he wasn’t going to back out of his ultimatum, he looked reluctant to upset his son even further.
As it was, he had his phone in his hand, hovering over the button to call Natalie and see if she could come in short notice to watch Peter while he went out. He was practically shaking for a bottle of scotch right now.
"Oh, no no no," Tony shook his head. "I was lucky enough to work with two piece outfits. And in California, most of them were shorts, so I didn't have to go through this trouble."
“I’ll work on a spell that might be able to shield him. At least until you can find the scepter.” Strange turned to leave the room, and Steve turned to follow him right away, vaguely aware of Loki following him as well.
Steve frowned a little, then crossed his arms over his chest. “Can I ask, why didn’t you tell me before that you had my other pokemon?” Tony tensed a little, really not wanting to get into this. “And where are my Sandshrew and Magikarp?” Tony really didn’t want to answer it. He remembered, at 6 years old, finding the pokeballs, and how two of them were already gone with the third barely hanging on.
"Jarvis," Tony said, a little smirk on his face. "Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk." He felt the power running to the boots, the flight stabilizers coming online, using the interface to start the maiden flight of Mark II. With less explosions this time. "Ready? In three, two, one!" He jumped up, letting the repulsors take over, speeding him out. He winced when he scraped against the side of the garage tunnel, but couldn't help but whoop as he hit open air.
“Still inside the Tower. Jarvis is combing the internet for pictures of the kids where they clearly got too close,” Steve informed him, looking down at his phone. While Tony had finished his appointment, Steve and Jarvis had teamed up to assess the damage, and then try to control it as much as they could. “He’s trying to suppress as many pictures of them as possible. All the things they’re jumping to is ridiculous.” He shook his head a little. “I don’t think this would such a big deal if they hadn’t of seen the name on the building right away.”
“Because my birthday is coming up,” Peter told him. “I’m gonna be Eight this year.” Tony couldn’t help but smirk a little at the very matter-of-fact tone coming from his young son.
"I've got Mary helping me out," Steve admitted. "Plus, you wouldn't usually be concerned with a snow storm delaying my flight by another day. If it were Peter? Yes, absolutely, but not me so much."
Tony found Steve walking towards Peter's room, with both his and Wade's bags, and moved to open the door for him. "I could have gotten those," Tony told him.
"I think it should be a little girl," Steve said with a soft smile. Tony let out a groan, dropping his head back on the chair. "What?"
"You make it sound like someone would be rifling through your mind." Both men turned, jumping back, at the voice that sounded behind Tony. There was Loki, leaning against the wall, looking at his nails. "We both know that someone else has already done that."
“We get to stay in the Pirates room??” Peter said in an awed hush. “That is so awesome!” As the door swung open Peter was the first one inside. Tony smiled at Steve and let him walk in next.
Tony suddenly reached up, putting a hand on Steve's cheek, and Steve stopped talking. He turned his head a little, almost hesitantly, and kissed Tony's palm. "Tony?"
Mary checked the text from Tony, a picture of him and Peter in the car, having picked him up from her parents place, then tucked her phone into her jacket pocket. She had to idly wonder if Coulson knew that Peter was Tony's son, or if he just had her come with him to Stark Industries because of what happened at the Benefit back in March.
"I didn't get a decent night sleep for the first three months," Steve said. Tony frowned a little and looked over at him, turning his body a little. "After I first woke up. I don't think I slept at all for three days, and then when my body was just too tired, that's when I slept without dreams, or memories." Tony watched the blonde slip his hands in his pockets, looking very much less Captain America, and more Steve Rogers. "I know, right now, it's not your ideal action, but if you need me too, I can watch Peter for you."
“I think that we can keep this contained fairly well,” Pepper told him. “There’s no official confirmation that it is you, but the blue against your shirt is what attracts some people.”
, girl. He reached down, paused for half a second, then picked her up. Tiny fingers wrapped around his thumb and he sucked in a breath. Tony was suddenly leaning in towards Steve's ear. "Peter did the same thing to me," he said softly.
If Mary was going to get married, then that meant that Coulson would be moving into the Tower for sure, which was okay. Meant more people around, and Peter liked Coulson. Bruce said that he would stay in the Tower, probably still travel around the world, but he felt better knowing that there would be a place for him to come back too. Clint had come back to check on Mary, and to apologize for his mind-controlled actions, but he had liked having his own room. He said that he probably wouldn't live there full time, but he'd take Tony up on the offer of a room whenever he was in the city.
"No," Steve shook his head. "You might have been over-compensating for something you didn't get enough of as a child, but everyone else who's moved in has had the option to say no. If anyone thought that it would be detrimental to Peter, Mary and Phil, or Rachel and William, wouldn't have moved in." Steve reached over to steal one of Tony's fries now. "You're right, mine are better."
“You came here uninvited,” Rhodey looked over at Dr Strange as he tried to cut in again. “I think that it’s plenty obvious that this is not a good time.”
Tony blinked, looking at Captain America, dirty, bleeding, exhausted, and took his hand, letting the super soldier pull him to his feet. "I'll take that into consideration next time." Tony said with a tiny smirk. He worked at the rest of the helmet, as Thor went over and picked up the faceplate he ripped off. As Tony pulled off the rest of the helmet, he took the broken piece and let out a breath. "So, where did we leave Loki, then?"
“I would like to see him talk to someone, at some point,” Tony confessed. “Kid keeps a lot inside, and I know what that’s like. I know that he knows that his Mom isn’t getting any better, and whether or not if he actually has dealt with the actions of being the one to pull the trigger on his dad.”
Mary pat his cheek a few times, pulling his eyes back up to her. "You are not allowed to get mopey tonight, you hear me?" Tony gave her a weak smile. "This isn't just a family dinner because the boys are coming home, it's also because you're back home. Steve's been in love with you for a while now, he just didn't know how to say it, or when. A lot happened over the course of this week, and I think that he realized that it's better sooner than later."
Tony felt himself lean his back against Steve's chest, and decided the liked the warmth of Steve a little better than of the scotch. But that was just the smell, a little part of his brain told him, perhaps the taste would be a better warmth. "Steve," he closed his eyes, feeling his throat close a little. "I have been fighting this feeling since I got back. You don't know how many times I've caught myself looking over at this bar, or thinking about it. The motion of pouring a drink is second nature, you know. Could do it one handed."
Tony nodded a little to him, biting the inside of his lip discreetly. "Thanks, Cap," he murmured. He wouldn't admit out loud that he was thankful for the offer. Tony was afraid that if he fell asleep with Peter nearby, he might not know that he was there right away, like he had when Rachel had tried to wake him up. He didn't want to hurt Peter, he would never want that to happen.
Tony nodded, kissing his Aunt Peggy on the cheek before rushing back into the house. He hoped that she would talk Howard down, knowing that he wouldn’t be happy with what had happened. He held onto Vee, but not too tightly, and hid around the corner. He didn’t want to eavesdrop, but he wanted to know if he should stay in his room for the rest of the day or not.
It took Tony a few seconds for his brain to cycle through what William might possibly be talking about before his eyes widened. "Wha?" Intelligently said. "I mean, of course," he nodded quickly. "You're sure about this?"
It was when they were on the helicopter, headed back for the base, that Tony took Rhodey's arm. "I don't want the press to report I'm back yet," Tony told him. "I don't want them to know until I'm heading back for the States." Rhodey tilted his head, but nodded a little. "Rhodey,...." He took a breath, but was interrupted when the helicopter shook as they landed.
"Nah," Tony shook his head. "I don't see that becoming a thing. I mean, look at how often I call you by your name."
"Peter is used to sleeping either in his room, or in mine if he has bad dreams," Mary told him as she went to the hall closet to get a blanket and pillow. "It's just for one night, Tony, just sleep in my room."
Tony took a breath and opened his eyes. His tablet was still resting on his chest, but his glasses weren’t on his nose. “You’re not supposed to be working.” Tony turned his head a little to see Steve walking in the room with a tray of food. “I moved your glasses for a reason.”
“Speaking of the new kitchen,” Steve quickly grabbed a rag to try and grab the dollop of applesauce that was falling from the spoon, and missing. Tony made a face when he felt the room temperature food hit his leg. “I thought you said that the Penthouse was only going to be two floors.”
"Sometimes, your stream of consciousness is absolutely fascinating," Steve told him with a smile. Tony's breath caught in his throat as he watched Steve's eyes. He saw something change, something shifted, as he looked at Tony. Everything seemed more open with him. Tony pressed his face to Steve's neck, the blonde moving to wrap around the genius. He tried not to think about what it meant, what he saw, just grounded himself in the moment, knowing that Steve would be back in DC before lunch time
“We’re okay,” Wade replied, a little shakily. Tony started to pull himself over the center console towards the back, noticing how both boys were unbuckling themselves and moving closer to Jamie. Tony had never heard her cry so loud, but he figured she’d never been involved in something as physically jarring. Their daring escape from Hydra had her cushioned and sheltered in his arms, not bouncing around in the back of a car.
Two planes behind him. "That's my exit." He cut the line and took a turn. Time to lose them, avoid the attention for everyone's sake. He forgot that sometimes the military had the right training, and it was getting harder to evade what they were throwing at him. When he deployed flaps he quickly up underneath one of the planes and latched on, trying to get his breath back. Maybe it was time to call Rhodey, before Rhodey had to call Mary and Peter.
“I am glad to see that there is one who cares for the Man of Iron so well,” Thor said to Steve, moving forward to hold the door open for them. “I think that your stubbornness is good match for him as well. You will probably need to draw from it, as he needs to rest for at least a day after his encounter.”
"J," Tony said quietly. "J, get the door for the lady." He was tired, and he needed the help. No use in denying it, not when it would keep him from Peter. As Mary came down, he was happy to see that Peter wasn't with her, but he wondered why she was alone.
“If you’re the one who did this to him, why aren’t you the one to reverse it?” Steve moved a little closer to Tony, without touching him.
“I’m working on it,” Tony said, punching Steve’s arm. “Go change, whiner. I’ve got the fuzzy creature.”
Tony buckled Jamie into her car seat in the middle, then helped Peter up into his on the side, while Steve lifted Wade on the side. “You’re looking about as whipped as the boys,” he said to Tony as they headed for the front of the SUV. “I can take the drive from here.”
“I’d stay clear of the door,” he warned the others. Steve kept his arms crossed, not moving, as Rhodey, Sam, and Bucky all backed away to the other wall. Rhodey moved the fastest. Tony rolled his neck a little, then dropped one arm out straight, raising the other behind him with a fist, looking towards the open door. Everyone watched the door in anticipation. And after a minute looked towards Tony. Tony took a breath, dropping his arms, shaking out his shoulders, then tried again.
There was a little chuckle over the phone, but it sounded a little forced and Tony frowned a little. "Hi Mr Stark," Mrs Wilson said, and she sounded tired, or something. "Sounds like the boys must be having a lot of fun."
“You’re a saint,” Tony said with a smile. “Seriously, crossing things off of my stress list is the best feeling.”
“Don’t think I’m going to give you any slack because my awesome niece just took her first steps,” Rhodey said with a smirk. “If anything, it proves that she was waiting for me to show up, to show off.”
Tony reached over, lifting a hidden panel in the wood and punched in a code. The rest of the let out a click and a soft hiss, and it started to slide away. Steve blinked. A hidden door in the wall. Peter took his hand and pulled him in as the door opened enough to let them through. Steve could tell that the room past the hidden door was big, and long. There were glass cases in the middle of the room and along the walls, and soft lights started to flicker on.
"I know that Peter would really like it," Mary said, knowing that it was a low blow. She smirked when Steve made a little whine.
It took several minutes, but Tony was able to pull himself together enough, and leaned away from Steve's arm, but slid one hand into the bigger one. Bruce was watching them, now with curiosity. “When did this happen?”
Tony found Bruce first once he boarded the Hellicarrier, almost completely on accident. He had been looking for Coulson and Peter, but saw Bruce through the windows of the lab he was in. They marched Loki by and Tony caught the smile of insanity that Loki threw towards them. He was sure that it was directed at both Tony and Bruce.
Nearly five weeks since they left, Steve and Natasha hadn't been able to find anything. Tony had of course had Jarvis follow every mission that had Steve's name attached to it, and found out that Fury was at least keeping them both busy. Steve had at least kept up with regular calls to Peter, letting him know that he was indeed coming back after his job was over, but he still didn't know when that would be.
“Hey, thanks for the warning,” Bucky deadpanned as Steve put the shield in its case to be polished. Steve smirked a little. “Well, they’re menaces, including your little clone, but that’s not why I was waiting for you.”
"Yeah, there's going to be a discussion about this later." Tony tipped his head back to try and slow the bleeding a bit more, winching as his chest pulled. "I need to put a call signal in the suit," he groaned out. "Last time I took a blow like that, it was from Steve. This guy hits nearly as hard." Not a minute later Steve was pulling up in the car, and jumping out to help Tony into the passenger seat. "I would say that we're not telling Peter or Mary about this."
Julie was rubbing her face with one hand. "I knew he didn't take the divorce well. He was overseas when he got the papers. But he sent them back, signed. I knew he'd be upset, but he never tried to contact me."
He stepped closer to Tony's back, resting his head on Tony's unoccupied shoulder, pressing a soft kiss to his neck. Tony turned his head to smile at him. This was Tony, the real Tony Stark. Here in the Tower, with the family he managed to build, there was no pretending for the press, no fake smiles, or exaggerated attitude. Tony was naturally cocky, and yeah he had an ego, and sometimes a jerk, but he wasn't a bad person, wasn't uncaring as the tabloids sometimes made him out to be.
Tony then made two cupcakes that he figured would be just for Wade and Peter, both with a red base. On the first cupcake he took the black frosting, putting down lines to make it look like a black tip flower. Tony took the blue frosting and did the same thing on the other cupcake, a blue tipped flower. When he was done with the cupcakes he looked up to see Peter and Steve watching him, sitting next to each other.
Everyone had been invited to Jamie’s first birthday party, just like Peter’s. There had been no answer from Barton and Romanoff, but Bucky wasn’t going to miss another party because they wanted to play games, specially not for his goddaughter. They had made it up to Peter by making a special breakfast for him the morning after his birthday, and giving him his gifts. This time Meg had been across the country, unable to get back in time thanks to one of the sculptures she was working on and a shipping mistake that couldn’t wait if they wanted to salvage the project. She made sure Bucky had brought her present for the little girl, and her apologies to Tony and Steve, again.
Steve had disappeared with Mary and Coulson, and Tony assumed that he was showing them their cake in private before they would have to cut into it. That was fine by Tony, as he was currently trying to walk with Peter attached to his left leg, and Wade attached to his right leg.
“I’m sure Rachel won’t care. Everyone can admire that sculpted chest of yours,” Tony said as he started to pull Steve towards the door. “I know times that I may have properly worshipped it.” Tony couldn’t help but grin at the dusting of pink on Steve’s cheeks. “Probably shouldn’t say stuff like when we’re about to eat in front of the family.”
Bucky shook his head no right away. “Only met her a couple of times.” The Winter Soldier remembered seeing her, but they didn’t interact, not really.
"You're right, most of them are probably SHIELD agents anyway," Tony said with a little sigh. "They'll know exactly where to go, they probably already have a map from spy surveillance." Coulson hummed with amusement. "That hum says that I'm probably right." Tony's phone pinged and he pulled it out. "That's Pep, gotta go." He hopped up from the chair, then pointed at Coulson. "You've got twenty minutes, and I expect to see you out there with the boys." Tony pointed to Steve as he headed for the door. "You are in charge of getting the boys form Mary's room so Agent doesn't see her yet, and making sure that they're dressed. Don't fall asleep on me, Rogers!" Tony saluted before leaving the room, shutting the door.
The suit going to the Military, the Air Force with Rhodey more specifically, and Iron Man showing up to break ground and get started on a new project was enough to deter the media vultures, a little bit. Tony was no good at pouring the concrete, and let the professionals handle that, but he was masterful at the frame foundation, and lifting the steel bars without the use of a crane. He was trying to keep one of the safest construction sites around.
"Bee-charmer?" Tony turned his head to look at him, hand still patting away on Rowan's back. "Really, honeyed words?"
"I can stay," Tony nodded. "I took a different car, no one will know it's mine. I don't think I would be able to let him go anyway...."
Steve frowned at her. "Tony Stark was willing to give his life to save millions yesterday, because he was the only one who could do it. There aren't many people I know who would be willing to make that call."
"I was checking on the other arrangements, before I had to step in to get these three delinquents dressed," Tony defended. "I was actually on track, for once! All of the food is on schedule, and the outside seating is almost all set as well. Your officiant has her own room and getting ready herself. The guests are allowed to roam the vineyard, but the gate to the ceremony area hasn't been opened yet." Tony stretched out his arm to pull his suit jacket over his watch to glance at the time. "We still have seven minutes until those gates open." Rachel was staring at him, and Mary was smiling. "What? I usually meet all my business deadlines, and I was a fairly competent CEO of a multi-billion dollar company for several years."
Steve kissed the side of his neck, but didn't say anything. He slowly turned Tony around so they were facing each other now. Tony brought Steve's hands to his chest, resting just above the arc reactor. "I can't sleep, Steve, but I wish I could. And it's getting real tiring of saying I can't sleep. I'm done with nightmares, and I wish there was an easy fix." Tony's vision wobbled, tears filling up. "I want to sleep, preferably next to you, and close my eyes when it's dark, then open them when it's light out again. Peter's done with school, and the damn perceptive kid is gonna notice if I'm collapsing from exhaustion in the middle of the day. He asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday, today. I don't know how I forced myself to give him an answer that wasn't, 'Drown myself in a couple dozen bottles.'"
“And then I found someone as fucked up as I am. In LA.” A bitter laugh. Tears stream down his face, but he pays them no mind. His voice comes out raspy, so he clears his throat in between words. “I even knew he was engaged before anything even happened. All we did was talk at first. We’d meet up for coffee, for dinner, then we’d talk. I knew he was engaged, but I invited him to my apartment anyway. To talk...amongst other things.”
“What? What am I doing?” Steve looks at Tony, eyes hauntingly blue. His lips are drawn to a slight frown, a slight
Steve places the frame back on the table. “T’challa did. When Bucky and I got there, there was nothing left to be done. Zemo had killed all the other supersoldiers. I think...he was expecting
Tony huffs. “Fine.” He tears the wrapping paper impatiently, already expecting to see a framed photo of him and Steve. And it is, but something about it doesn’t look right. Upon closer inspection, he notices the familiar strokes of Steve’s brush work. “It’s us...at the MET,” Tony whispers.
“A few.” Steve hunches over himself, trying to make himself look smaller than he actually is, but to no avail. He keeps his coffee close to his chest, then lifts it to take a swig. “I kept getting mixed signals, you know? I knew he liked me...er. I know now that he did. And we kinda...we were...before dating…we did—-”
father—I didn’t know he was in a serious relationship at the time. We were both doing this science convention thing in LA, and I just...fell in love. Quite the whirlwind romance, if you will.”
Tony pushes himself closer, tries to hug Tommy again, but Tommy leans away. He wipes the tears with the underside of his shirt collar. “No. I know I should’ve told you sooner, both for your sake and his. And mine, I guess. I’ll properly end things with him, if you ask me to. But I can’t promise that I wouldn’t hate you. It almost happened once before.” Tommy looks down on the floor. “I don’t want to hate you, Dad.”
Tony squints. He ducks his head in a futile attempt to feel less vulnerable. “I don’t know how to say this…”
for accommodating us so warmly, Mr. Calloway,” Tony says. “I know our visit is on such short notice. But I hope our requests haven’t been a bother?”
to become friends with. But the thing is, Steve’s relationship with Tony can no longer stay on the outside. That’s exactly what they’re trying to do here, bringing that relationship into their lives.
Tony flails his hand over his head as he groans, long and loud. “That’s not the point. Oh my god, you are just like him.” Tony falls back on the bed and crawls underneath the duvet.
“A shame Wade can’t be here. But I guess somebody has to stay and handle all the wedding planning, huh?”
Upon entering their quaint home, Tony had been immediately hit by the smell of coffee and freshly baked bread. Erik had been sitting on a dining chair, waiting for Tony to step in and take in his surroundings. Charles and Pietro had been nowhere to be found. Tony had been hoping to have them around. Charles was a natural mediator, the peacekeeper that kept Erik in check. And Pietro could at least be a human buffer in case Erik had wanted to castrate Tony.
Tony is asleep. He had been dozing off by nine and had started snoring ten minutes later. There's drool on his cheek and it slides down to the pillow, creating a damp spot near his ear. Dimmed lights and a soft murmur of AC/DC playing in the background before ten are par for the course these days, though Steve is still having a hard time adjusting to Tony sleeping at reasonable hours.
"Leave." It doesn't have as much bite as Tony intended. It comes out almost like a plea. A desperate plea, like how everything else in Tony's life has become a tad too desperate, so he doesn't try to mask it anymore. "Please?"
"Enjoy your special date. Thanks again, Steve. I'll talk to you later." He smiled and nodded as she hung up. Steve slipped his feet into the black shoes on the floor, then slipped into the bathroom to check his hair. He had gotten a haircut the day before, and had somehow managed to keep Tony from seeing it yet. It helped that Tony had been out doing last minute board meetings with Pepper for SI, and spending the night with Peter.
When Steve woke up, and was pulled back to SHIELD, his first question had been about his beloved Pokemon. He had been told that the cold had damaged the balls, but that they were working on fixing it. He was also informed that Howard Stark had been the one to collect the pokemon left behind. They didn’t elaborate past that. Steve assumed that Tony Stark had them now, after reading the files. He would just have to wait a little longer to be reunited with his friends, his only family remaining now.
"When did you start that training? After Iron Man?" Steve moved so that they were facing each other now.
"I don't care," Tony growled, not taking his eyes off of George. He had a startled look when he thought that Tony was going to charge him, but looked smug again when Steve stopped him. "I want to hit something, and there's something in front of me."
"Yeah," Tony gave a little shrug, looking at the father. "Not exactly what I wanted to be happening right now. How are your girls holding up?"
"All the food is about to be taken out of the oven, or being prepared now, so it'll be fresh when the reception starts." Even the coffee the team he had assembled had been heaven in his mouth that morning. Tony turned to look at Pepper and smiled. "You look good in that blue dress."
“You’re right, I probably couldn’t care less. Anyway, I will be dubiously ignoring all media for the next five days.” Tony watched Peter run back into the room with his sketchbook, pencils, and colored pencils, and pushing them into the backpack that Mary held open for him.
"Dr Banner, how long until more of your tests are done?" Steve asked him, pulling out his Captain voice.
A book dropped in front of him on the desk, and he glanced up to see Strucker, and his stupid monocle. "Wanda, let him read it. I think that he has earned a reprieve." Tony gasped when he felt the control slip from his body. The chains were gone, but the cuffs were still on, threatening to give him a shock if he tried to step out of line.
"Sir, I do so hate to interrupt, but Mr and Mrs Fitzgerald are arriving in the garage." Tony pressed his face into Steve's shoulder when the AI spoke up. Steve dropped a kiss on the top of his head, rubbing his shoulder.
“He’s not going to hurt us again,” Wade mumbled out. Julie frowned a little, looking down at her son, running her hand through his hair.
"I'll contact you." Fury said, then looked back down at the tablet. He was apparently done with Tony. Tony huffed out a breath, feeling anger curl in his stomach, but he knew when he wasn't going to get anything else. It didn't mean that he was done, but it would be useless to continue. Plus, he had to get back to Peter. He felt a little guilty then, hoping that he could distract Peter from thought about Agent by letting him see Mary.
"They're also very well behaved," she beamed. Tony slowly walked around the couch, over to where his son and his best friend were, and suddenly sat down in front of them. Both boys looked up at him with very serious, and innocent expressions on their faces.
"You were kissing Mr Steve," Peter stated, and there was a wrinkle in his nose. "Adults look gross when they kiss." Tony snorted, biting his lip and swallowing the laugh that bubbled up his throat. "Why were you two kissing?"
Tony held up the other evolutions stones he had. “What if we put these stones so that they lay against the eggs? It’s never been done, because it was thought to be silly, but what if we could influence the evolution straight from the egg?” He moved the Fire Stone so that it was nestled against the egg. Then he picked up a Water Stone and looked at Vee. “Want to help me? We need to pick them out. I think that maybe this one should be Vaporeon.” He pointed towards an egg, and Vee chirruped happily. Tony laughed and put the stone against the egg. They repeated the process with a Thunder Stone.
"Key!" Tony shouted, and Loki smirked a tiny bit. Tony never looked away from Loki. "You'll wake her up-"
"Yeah, gonna be big stuff, real proud of it. Hey, listen, don't wanna hold you up, I'm sure we'll see each other around, again." Tony pat his shoulder with his hand and started walking again. He could just circle around and take the back entrance to the building.
"Would you be able to shed some light on what happened between Tony and Steve?" She knew it was a long shot, and this was close to an invasion of Tony's privacy "What they talked about, what they did, all that while I was out."
"No," Tony said with a little snort. "I could buy Disney in an hour if I really wanted, too." Steve didn't deny that was possible. "I don't know, just, a feeling I can't explain," he shrugged. "Didn't say no, though. I know they'll have an amazing time." Steve kissed him softly before Tony tucked his head under Steve's chin.
Tony gasped when those same sharp things were pushing into his skin, then started to drag down, like scalpels cutting down towards his fingers. His mouth opened in a silent scream when he felt the cuts sliding down his middle fingers. They lifted, but then were poised at the base of his index fingers, the process repeating. Each finger was sliced, and tears had started to collect at the corners of his eyes.
He tracked the sound to the couch, and picked up a couple pillows until he found the phone. He plopped down on the couch and looked at the caller ID. Now it was really weird, if Pepper was calling Jarvis should have automatically put it through, he knew that Tony had been waiting for this call. "He pressed the button, opened his mouth to answer-
"What were you thinking?" Steve had a hard time associating the hissed voice in his ear with Bucky, but the man was standing in front of him, threatening him again.
"Repulsors offline. Missiles offline," Jarvis reported mournfully. Stane squeezed again, the HUD display starting to crack, and more red than anything was flashing in his face.
He tried not to be weirded out, or worried, when Happy and Mary spent some time in the kitchen making food for everyone, and he started to hear laughing. They had probably been sharing stories about Tony. That had scared him, and the smirks he got when they had been eating dinner had been all the answer that he needed.
"I'll take the secret to the grave," Steve swore, putting a hand up in oath. "Peter told me that it was your mothers’ recipe?"
“But,” Strange interrupted them, “he wasn’t seen. The Titan only knows of my presence and power, and possibly that of Wanda Maximoff-“
“Like I said, drive you nuts. In a good way.” He turned with her in his arms, before setting her down on her feet, holding onto her hands. She hadn’t learned to walk on her own yet, but if someone were holding onto her hands to keep her steady, she could get a decent pace going on the floor. Steve helped guide her towards the bedrooms, hunched over so he didn’t stretch her arms up. As they got closer they saw a pillow go flying past an open door, and Steve nodded.
"I'm not a lab experiment," Meg said, but she was smiling. Tony was starting to like her if she thought that it would be fun.
“Well, I know that you’ll all have fun. And Steve deserves a vacation, too.” She got up again, setting the suitcase on the ground. “This will really be the first time that he’ll be able to relax, without having to think about SHIELD, Hydra, or anything else Avengers related.”
They left Julie feeling a bit more secure, the boys asleep, and Tower still under partial lockdown with a full lockdown for the residential floors. Steve and Tony hit the elevator and Tony was turning to look at the blonde. "Wade overheard everything, didn't he?" Steve nodded and Tony sighed. "That kid, we need to put a bell on him."
"Yes," Tony said, nodding. "Do it right away, Jarvis." Tony turned eyes back to Steve to see his eyelids fluttering. "Hey, come on, open those eyes." Tony felt more comfortable moving to sit on the bed now. Steve's eyes opened, his pupils blown wide, and they stuttered around as he took in his surroundings, before settling on Tony. "There you are," Tony said, putting a gently hand on Steve's chest. His heart was hammering in his chest.
So, I've mentioned it before, but I wanted to put it out there; I'm thinking of making this a series. Following Tony and Steve, and Peter as he grows up throughout the years, and eventually becoming Spiderman. Instead of putting large time jumps in this story, I would end this one at a point that feels natural, then continue in other stories, and one-shots, etc. What does everyone think of that?
"Go on," Mary waved her hand. "No need for you to help us with groceries," she chuckled. Steve gave her a smile and waved to Peter before heading back over to his apartment, the leaves forgotten outside.
playing in the background, so then the next time it happens we have to replay the episodes we missed," Tony continued, stealing another olive from Steve's plate this time. Steve trade plates with Tony, putting another spoonful of green, then black olives on the plate, before filling up the empty one. Steve had planned for that to happen. "In reality it should not take us over two months to make to Season Five."
"Not my call," Tony said, pulling up a chair to a screen on the other side of Bruce. The Serum that Tony had been working on was pulled up, Bruce having had tests running all night. "Didn't argue with the Soldier who made that call though. I had an armful of baby, and a desperate need to get out of there." He nodded to the screen and directed his next question to Bruce. "Is that part of what they used on the Maximoff kids? Because, I'm finding it hard to believe that Strucker was able to get them abilities like they have, but he couldn't figure out the Serum with all of Howard's notes."
Tony took the distraction to quietly slip away, and back down to the workshop. He locked the door, frosting the glass, and walking towards the back, taking a seat in one of the leather chairs. "Jarvis, set a recording, please." A screen popped up in front of him, showing him recording options, and an image of himself.
“We’ll started with just buttered noodles,” Tony countered. “I don’t feel like coating the new kitchen in plastic tarps when she starts actually spaghetti sauce.”
"I have secured their location, and can relay that neither Wilson has been injured," his AI dutifully relayed. "I am working on contacting them, as cell towers communications have not been restored yet."
"I'm doing better," he confirmed for Peter. "They say I have to stay in bed for today, but I feel even better now seeing both you and Wade." Tony was always amazed at how Coulson could use his professional sounding voice with the kids, and still make them smile. Tony himself had never used the higher-pitched "baby voice" with Peter, or Wade for that matter after meeting him, but he also never used his business voice. Granted, his business voice was usually used for the Board of Director, or potential clients, and he just didn't like most of them in the first place. He liked kids. Especially his kid.
Bucky hadn’t said much during dinner, but Peter made up for that easily. In a twist that neither Tony nor Steve saw, a lot of Peter’s talking and questions were directed at Bucky himself. Tony was sure to keep an eye on Peter’s chocolate chip cookie consumption, not wanting him to have a sugar rush that would keep him up all night.
“Is he going to be okay?” The teacher asked warily as he watched Tony maneuver his agitated child into the carseat and tug the restraints in place.
“And they were rock solid. Pete knocked out a tooth on one of them,” Stark was grinning down at his son.
“I...uhm, ok?”Steve looked even more confused now, the tiny crease between his brows looking close to becoming a permanent fixture on his handsome face. What the hell was Tony doing thinking about his handsome face like that for?? He needed to focus. “See you later, I guess…”
“Not for a couple years, I don’t think,” he mumbled, the sound of computer keys clacking in the background. “Here, I found him. I met him maybe once or twice when he needed reinforcement from the air force. Why do you ask?”
Nonetheless, it was a relief to have those nuisances gone from SI. These series of meetings mostly had to do with their yearly review of how things were going in this section of the company, which was especially important with the new employees. Hence why Pepper forced Tony to come with her. It was better than the boring meetings with the dinosaurs on the board of directors, only for the sole reason that he got to wander the company and actually watch what was going on. He even got to meet the California interns that were all very promising and Tony was sure he’d be writing all of them recommendation letters or hiring them in the next year or so.
“You’re right, Petey. I must have forgotten,” Tony stopped to shake his head at his son, standing with his hands on his hips. “What would I do without you?”
As Tony buckled his son into his car seat, he glanced to the picture of their little ragtag family next to them. The guilt of not spending any time with him this weekend started to eat at him.
“Pepper, my dear, you came to see me on my deathbed after that long and dreadful trip!” Tony called out, flinging both arms out dramatically to either side of him.
It was another lovely Friday morning for Steve Rogers in his delightful, empty apartment. At least the light streaming in from outside meant that it was morning and he didn’t have to pace around the combined living room and kitchen until he was too exhausted to stay upright, just for a couple minutes of rest before the nightmares started up again.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Steve hummed. He’d been meaning to have a conversation with Natasha for a couple of weeks now, but she was definitely avoiding him as of late. Which normally wouldn’t be too hard to get around if she wasn’t an honest to god spy. Or, at least, he’s coming to believe she is. “Thanks, Sam. See you later.”
By the time Peter finished up the chocolate and peanut butter ice cream he had shared with his father, he was starting to yawn. The bill had been paid five minutes ago and the tip laid out on the table. Tony reached over to pat his son on the back.
“When you go to his place can you steal something and bring it home for me?” Bucky grinned before doing his own version of puppy dog eyes.
“She’d eat me alive an’ then Becca’d cheer me on from where ma can’t see,” Bucky rested his head onto his mechanical arm, tossing the menu to the blonde.
"Peter Parker, where can I find him?" Tony was nearly out of breath, tapping his finger on the counter frantically.
The blonde huffed, rolling his eyes as he grabbed Ned’s bag as well, directing him to the gym. By the time Steve had his only remaining student settled, the sound of Peter’s mean words and yelling had devolved into loud crying, heard from across the parking lot, as he simultaneously tried to push his father away and pull him closer.
“Funny, I didn’t take you for a gossip,” Tony squinted up at him before slowly going back to looking through the arm, shining a light down towards the wrist joint.
With an assurance from Natalie that everything would be fine and a threat from Pepper to dismember him if they weren’t in the car fifteen minutes ago, Tony said his last goodbyes and finally trudged into the elevator and down to the garage. Almost immediately, he pulled up the video feed from the penthouse living room onto his cell.
“Nothing except for the fact that nobody’s used one of these things since the goddamn stone ages! Where’d you get this fossil from, Fred?” Tony was looking at him like he was crazy, even as he flipped the phone open and punched in his name and number.
“You’re an art teacher at an aftercare program for elementary school children. They don’t just let ANY creepy, crawley, crazy serial killers work in a place like that, and if they did, they probably wouldn’t waste the energy it takes to make friends with the kids like you are,” Stark rambled, waving his hand through the air like all of this was obvious, textbook information.
I'm so very sorry for any mistakes in this chapter! I didn't have time to edit this as thoroughly as I would have liked to
“Alrighty then, guess I’ll just have to eat all this spaghetti by my lonesome!” Tony sighed dramatically, piling food onto his plate like it was a chore. “Lone Rider Tony, saddling up to the table for some solitary grub...sure wish there was an ace-high cowboy who would come and save me from cashing in.”
“I promise I’m not lying. Go ahead, try it,” Steve gestured to the paper in front of the little kid.
“Thanks for watching my little monster and making sure he didn’t impale himself on a paint brush, or something,” Tony gave a slight nod to the blonde.
“Oh, come on!” Steve groaned, running a hand down his face in exasperation. “He’s a good-looking man. Sue me for checking the guy out, not like he hasn’t done it to me ten times over.”
"Tony, you need to get some rest yourself, before we get there," the man interrupted him. Steve figured he must have been talking to Mary's parents. "I can hear it in your voice, son." ('Don't give him sympathy, Bill!" Steve heard in the background.)
"Yeah, yeah," he waved her hands off, but caught one of them. "I know. After he sang to me," Mary raised her eyebrows, "I had to tell him I loved him, too. I told you, just sweet on a whole other level. I actually think he's trying to make me the woman in the relationship." Mary smacked his arm and he chuckled. "Now, I'm a Daddy to someone else, and all I can think about, when I'm thinking about that, is, am I gonna screw up?"
“Give her time,” Tony smiled. “I’m sure in a few more months she’ll catch on. Hey Pete, you seen Papa?”
"Ms Potts?" She looked up when Coulson spoke, Pepper Potts coming the stairs, in a bit of a hurry it looked like. The last time she had seen the red-head was when Peter had been only a month old. "Did you forget about out appointment?"
"That might have actually been a little contained," Tony said thoughtfully. "I let myself get a little more seriously than normal though, so that's probably par for the course."
Steve had made sure to keep Clint and Natasha far away from Bucky and Meg, and still make time with both Jamie and Peter. He was determined to get them to semi get-along, because he was also determined that the four of them would go to Disneyland as a family. It was endearing, even if Tony thought that he held such lofty goals.
"Anthony," Thor said, reaching forward to grasp his arm in greeting. "Your mechanical servant has filled me in on what happened, but there is no way that Loki could have left his confines down here." Tony looked over at Loki, who was watching them with blank green eyes. Except they weren't exactly blank, there was a carefully concealed spark of amusement. He wanted something.
Mary chuckled and leaned in to kiss Peter's cheek. "Look at that, baby. You're just like Daddy now." Peter squealed and grinned.
"Let's take it one step at a time, Tony," Mary said, but she was smiling. "Can you stay tonight? I know it's already late, but if you have to-"
Steve put a hand on top of Peter’s head from behind. “Bucky, this is Peter, Tony and Mary’s son. Come on in guys, the food still has a little bit of time to cook, but I’m sure that Peter can keep us entertained. What do you say, Petey?”
"Seems I set the bar a little high for myself." Tony felt himself smile so wide that it actually hurt a little. He pulled Steve's head up, kissing him sensuously, keeping him close.
"Will you?" Steve looked at him. "Try to sleep, that is?" He ran his thumb softly under one of Tony's eyes. "Much longer and it's going to look like you got into a bad fist fight."
Steve was moving after them, then lost his footing and hit the ground on his side when Clint was suddenly falling against him. Bucky wrapped his arm around Meg's waist, lifting her up and backing away from Natasha, but the mother was still swinging her arms, and started to kick her legs out to get out of his grip. Steve put a hand to Clint's shoulder to keep him down on the ground while Steve got up himself. He felt so lost.
"We've actually spoken." Steve saw the confusion on Tony's face for a second. "A couple of weeks ago." There was the recognition, and a wave of emotions passed through Tony's eyes in the matter of a second. "How are you-"
"Tony!" Pepper practically screeched. He was already done with this. He couldn't stop thinking about Vanko's words.
"No, because you would have told me before hand, cause you're a damned gentleman." He leaned further into the arm, pulling out a couple of wires. "You would have told me you were leaving, before insisting that I have to be more careful with this assassin around, before insisting that we shelter someone else who may have fallen under his scope, before insisting that I never be alone!" Tony growled and threw the soldering iron on the table. "I'm pissed, if you couldn't tell."
They drove, and they waited. It sounded like a large plane was coming in, knowing the sound from her time with Steve, and then Pepper and Happy were stepping out of the car. She waited in the back.
A couple hours later, as he held onto Tony as he slept, he let the smile slowly slip away, mind slipping away into thoughts that he tried to keep buried in the back of his mind. If that’s what Tony really saw, and felt, what was happening? He and Tony were both technically human, no unnatural mutations, at least nothing that the Serum could have caused. So why was Tony literally seeing the universe? It didn’t sit right with Steve. He kissed Tony’s head again, closing his eyes.
"SHIELD brought over some of Howard's old stuff, and I've been slowly going through that." Tony motioned over to the crates in the back of the workshop, one of them not opened. "Apparently he was a founding member of SHIELD, so there's that."
“Ah, Steve quit the superhero business once he found Bucky. They took off on some kind of spiritual road trip together. Bucky posts photos about it on Instagram all the time.”
Natasha snorted. "More like never. I didn't think you even knew how to do anything in a kitchen besides make coffee."
He emerged later that night after testing out the comms with the younger Natasha. He wanted to make her feel included in the mission. That was something Steve really appreciated about his new side of Tony he was witnessing. Not only was he adamant about keeping her out of harm’s way—something he wholly agreed with—but he even saw the genius go the extra mile and make sure he stayed connected to her; he made sure she knew that they were all right and let her assist them in any way they needed. Steve liked that Tony didn’t just dismiss her, that he cared about her feelings and had the foresight to recognise she may be worried or feeling lost, not knowing what was going on. It was…well, Steve wouldn’t say
