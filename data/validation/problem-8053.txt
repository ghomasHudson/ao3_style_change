After he finished with the active cleaning, he just stood there, pondering.
Love wasn’t something he'd ever wanted.  It was inconvenient at best, a weakness at worst, and how much did he know about weakness?  He was a walking weakness, a scarred mass of mistakes and loneliness and alcoholism, emotionally stunted and unable to operate as a normal human.  He could create, he could destroy, he could rise again, but never go smoothly through life, just live with all the normal joys and sorrows that most people had.
“Mmmm,” Tony mumbled around a finger as he sucked the last of the broth off of it.  “Gotta try that sometime.  But you promised me lamb, and lamb I shall receive.”
“Bucky?”
“I’m – give me a minute.”  His heart hammering, Tony gazed up at the oculus, slow tendrils of smoke rising from the hearth.  He turned his head, and gazed into crimson flames.  “Steve?  Can I tell you some things?  They aren’t . . . making sense to me.”
“Someone will see to it that you get your pay,” he murmured.
“Wanna go look at the stars?” He sounded breathless.  Tony nodded and allowed himself to be pulled up and out of the room.
This is how it would be with Tony, Steve could tell.  Soft, tender touches that shook him to the core, skating across overheated skin and pulling him out, stretching him out like taffy, but in such a good way.  He would never return to this coiled tension that he had carried ever since puberty, multiplied by ten since the serum had made him so much more sensitive and
Chucking, Steve pulled him up a maintenance ladder and onto the roof.
Tony thought it was nice to see Steve having some more “settled” friends, as opposed to the eternal frat boys and Russian assassin he usually hung out with.  Not that Thor and Jane were anywhere near normal.  Two years before, the pair had apparently gotten so drunk they thought they had been transported to Asgard by Idris Elba.
Tony reached up and pulled the cannula out of his nose, blinking at the dank surroundings, like a cave.  His vision was blurry, but he was able to make out what looked like the metal of a collapsible drinking cup.  He tried to grab it, but he miscalculated how well his fingers worked, and it clattered to the ground.  He was wracked with deep coughs, seizing control of his entire body.  He tried to roll off the cot to hurl the bile that was rising in his throat, but something stopped him.
“You okay in there?”
Maria laughed while Peter groused.
cold.  He was covered in a rough blanket.  Had he passed out somewhere weird?  There was something in his nose.  There was something buzzing in his chest.  Oh, his chest ached.  Like someone had done open-heart surgery or something.
Bruce cut into what was probably going to be the pissing contest of Tony’s life.  “Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?”
Pepper gave one of her trademark sighs.
Steve didn’t know how long they stood there, waiting for Stark to emerge.  It felt like another seventy years incased in ice.
He can pretend that Steve can’t sleep without him either, that Steve has to force himself to stand up, that Steve doesn’t want to leave the bed anymore than Tony wants him to, that the sigh and the deep breaths are him arguing with himself to stay.
“Don’t come any closer,” Tony called as he back up towards the wall, searching for some way, any way, to catch or stall Shapanka long enough for Tony to figure out how to disable the ice maker. Shapanka, crossing a section of floor that disguised the trapdoor for the stairs down into the basement labyrinth. “I’m warning you . . . . “
“Have I ever told you?  If you weren’t frozen, Howard probably would have tried to make you my godfather.  I used to be so proud.  Godson of Captain America.”  He snorted and harshly pulled the toe of his purple sock.  “Now I think it’s just because you’re one of the only people who would have called him a friend.”
“Love you.  Bye.”  The call ended.  “Steve says you should come up for the Fourth.”
“That’s not – that’s not the
“On that lovely note, have a pleasant day, gentlemen.”  The four council members rose, cracking their aged joins and chattering lightly as they took their leave.  Steve remained seated, so Tony did as well.  After the group had entered the courtyard, Steve turned to him.  “I have several advisory councils, but this is the smallest and also the one that meets most frequently.  I will expect you to sit in on the others, but this group meets so frequently it’s not necessary for you to always be here.”
Standing in the motionless elevation, Steve ran shaking hands through his hair.
“You two need to talk.
“Then no.”  Steve leaned in to kiss him.  “I’m gonna go on the tour of the building, then head into history museum.  But who knows.  Text me, and we’ll convene.”
– what’re you –“
Fury rolled his eye.  “Please.  You shot your mouth off on your own accord.”
“Vision?  Little help here?”
.   Steve is crap at comfort, but giving solidarity? He wins the prize, every time. No one is better at simply just
“Stark!  We need to talk,” Coulson’s voice came over JARVIS.
The entire room chorused “Come on, Pepper, it’s for charity!” and she sighed in defeat.
“You think you can come again?” he asked, voice pitching far lower than usual, but judging by how dilated Tony’s eyes were, and the feeble twitches coming from his cock, this wasn’t going to be over soon.  He grinned at the determined look that crossed Tony’s face.
And whoo, new series!  How does this one look?
“He’s an asshole.”  Hot, but an asshole.
Tony had somehow obtained a human ovum (where he got it, Steve probably would never know), and had worked with Bruce to re-program the ovum to produce human eggs using the Tony Stark X chromosome.  It had taken ages, but they had finally managed it, and has saturated it with LH hormones to make it produce eggs at a far accelerated rate aside from the normal one every twenty-eight days.  Many of the eggs that had been produced were defective and would not survive fertilization, but Tony and Bruce had spent the last several hours searching for the two undamaged that they had known would be in the pile.
“I’m here.”  He doesn’t say anything else.
Tony shifted uncomfortably. “Got a bit of a hero’s complex, do you?”
His eyes.
“I’ll help you.”
” scared Tony worse than the image of Steve burned and bloody and dying.
“I’ve stopped worrying about that kind of thing when it comes to you.  Come here.”
The only ones he wears indoors now are the cheap neon frames with the bits of black translucent plastic that Clint got at the dollar store.
He was unrelentingly harsh, wound up in a way he didn’t understand, toweling off and pulling on his clothes.  He wanted to go to the gym, he wanted to punch something.  He wanted . . . .
“Maybe I shouldn’t tell you this, but the thing will vibrate if he sends you a text,” Rhodey grinned from the driver’s seat, cap pulled low over his brow.
“Well, they won’t match, but hopefully you can ignore that?” Laura piped up.  Tony shifted the pile enough to allow her to lay the slightly scratchy towels on top.  “They’re not the quality you’re used to, I’m afraid.  None of it is.  But is should suffice for a couple of days, yeah?”
Tony turns, and there’s Steve, brow furrowed, jaw set, arms crosses, triceps bulging. He looks firm and serious, and Tony opens his mouth – to say what, he doesn’t know – but Steve cuts him off with a crushing hug.
wanted to be a soldier.  I wanted to prove myself while helping my country where I could.  Bucky said that to me a thousand times, but I didn’t get it until I had Hydra blood on my shield.  If I hadn’t been frozen, I still would have had to work.  I would have been sent to Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf.  Maybe the USSR.  I would have never been allowed to quit, to hang up my shield.
– to you.  And
– them.”
“These models-“  Bucky tapped the model on his, a brunette wearing a black leather jacket covered in buckles and army green cargo pants, and sliding sunglasses back into her hair.  “Could they possibly be, um, changed?”
“First off: how do you turn in to humans? Are dragons some special offshoot of humans?  Why does my blood test as human?”
“Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?”
, which was the color of the sky.
, much less a lawsuit.
But friends have always been better for him in the long run.
He’s coming to consider this one of the happier periods of his life. Every day is full of new things to learn and discover.  Zoloto has taken charge of his tutelage as she promised, and he is endlessly grateful for her guidance.  It makes him ache for the mother he never knew, but he feels her warmth when he thinks of her and when the shell tells him stories of her.
“Sam?  No.”
Immediately the medical team backed off, allowing Steve and the others to slip through.  Tony sobbing, threw his arms around Steve’s neck.  Steve eased the oxygen mask off of his face, and Bruce efficiently removed the IV and other monitors.  The blaring of the medical equipment stopped, leaving the room silent except for Tony’s shuddering breaths on Steve’s neck.  Steve held on, stroking his hair.
He’d be trying not to laugh, but would be relentless in his pace.
They were already nervous about the twin’s heath.  They hadn’t been specific, but from what it sounded like, there were some changes that happened during Tony’s DNA manipulation.  Nothing that would get them into Xavier’s, but smaller mutations defiantly outside the norm.  Nothing horrible, but they were still wary.
He doesn’t encourage eye contact, keeps people distracted long enough for him to leave them in the bed (it’s not his bed, not really), and goes where JARVIS protects him from harm and people knowing that there’s some part of him that grows blacker and blacker, shriveling and languishing from lack of attention.
He would probably regret it, hell he already did, but he stayed close, savoring the warmth and closeness of Steve that he’d never get awake.
Steve pulled back a fist, curious of JARVIS’s tone.  The AI sounded cautious, but then, Steve looked out and saw night had fallen.  He only used the punching bags when he was angry or frustrated, otherwise preferring to use the other training equipment.  Repeatedly hammering the bags for hours at a time was no help whatsoever in gleaning new skills.  It didn’t do much in terms of releasing frustration either, but then again, someone usually came by and distracted him.  Usually Tony.
, that vague ideal his father had always droned on about.  It disgusted him, trying to be like his father, as he was the mirror opposite.  Howard Stark had a son he never heard.  Tony Stark heard the children he would never have.
“Excuse me?  Captain?  Hi, I’m Caroline.  Uh, my father was in the war, and, well, he passed away in the eighties, and my son,” she shot a glare at the boy, who had good sense enough to look sheepish, “he knows nothing about his grandfather’s history; he only cares about body counts.  Could you, if it wouldn’t be too much trouble . . . ?”
She rolled her eyes. “Shapanka. I
“Augh,
(See the end of the chapter for
They waited.  For something.
Steve was staring at him. Eyes wide and blue, body pulled into a slight crouch, as if he had been in the middle of hurling something at his attacker. Tony just wanted to peel off the armor and wrap his arms around Steve until he returned to full warmth.
“Are you familiar with the history of our island?” Steve asked after a while.
He allowed his mind to drift to that bright red vibrator, so seemingly innocent if you had no idea to what it was intended for.  A harsh breath came from his powerful lungs.
But does he really want to know? Does he?  He knows better than most the burden of knowledge.  It’s not always good to know things.  God, it’s downright awful some of the time.  But this is an addiction he could never hope to kick.  He thrives best while unraveling the secrets of the universe.  It’s not good for him, but he can’t
“What?”
Someday sunk in the deepest mire.
“Problem?  Are you feeling ill?”  Something in Natasha’s eyes told him she suspected something.  She seemed to know what he was thinking.
Steve had a triumphant smile on his face, nodding as if Tony had just passed some sort of test.  “One of the first things I learned about being a king: don’t let people undermine your own convictions.  Not everyone can be king, but everyone believes themselves a kingmaker.  Tony, if there’s something you feel you need to do, or something you believe to be right, don’t listen to people with ulterior motives.  Follow your instincts.  Heed good advice, but be wary of your advisors.  At the end of the day, you are the one making the decision, and the consequences will be on your head.”
A guy in his thirties shamefully pulled out an orange.  “My kid didn’t want it, and I didn’t want to throw it out.  I wasn’t going to eat it in here, though-“
“So,” Rhodey thankfully cleared his throat and patted the horse’s flank as one of the little slave girls brought it an apple to munch.  “Where’d you get her?”
Tony’s eyes were soft as he looked at his meal.  “It’s perfect, Steve.”  He grabbed a spoon and shoved some stew in his mouth and moaned.
“Handling what?”
Steve smiles weakly, through he looks like he's about to vomit.
And he was helpless to protest, and let Tony sway their bodies close together.
Not out of it enough to not notice every time Tony laughed.  He would jerk up then, trying vainly to stifle the frigid spike of jealousy that someone else was making Tony happy.  It was an unhealthy attitude.  Clint would smirk at him every time.
Steve appraised him out of the corner of his eye.  “Then maybe you could join me, sometime.  I only ever went up Lykabettos alone.”
“Careful, Steve,” Bruce said calmly.  “I can stitch your wounds, not save you from the evil eye.”
His lips felt numb as he said it.  “We won.”
” and slammed to a halt. “Iron Man?”
Things change after the glasses.
“Of course.”  There were things that Tony didn’t want anyone to know, much less the gossiping servants.  But it seemed that it was prudent to retain that caution in Korkyra.
*hover over italicized terms for a definition*
The leaden ball of guilt that had been forming since Steve had left Tony alone in the music room finally completely solidified and threatened to knock him down ninety floors and embed him in the pavement at Pepper’s accusatory tone.
“Same as Happy’s.”
“My favorite were the mineral based pigments.  Expensive, yes, terribly expensive.  But ground up ruby will last a lot longer than any bug guts.  You can’t use synthetic paint to mimic iron oxide.”
“I'm not afraid to hit an old man. “
“You know me so well, Cap.”
Was Pikas
The appearance would be small.  Short and to the point.  It had been scheduled for the morning that Tony would be discharged, to divert some of the attention.  Steve tried not to be disappointed he would not get to escort Tony home from the hospital.
“It’s not bodily fluids, is it?” Clint asked warily.
They passed once again through the back courtyard.  “Just for your information, we spend a lot of time here.  This and the orchard just behind us act as our exercise yard.  But Steve likes to mix it up, take us around the island to practice different tasks.  We also bathe out here every six days or so,” Natasha supplied, stopping only a moment to bend down and run her fingers across the pebble mosaic.
Iron Man safely tucked away, Tony Stark jumped into the driver’s seat and sped away.
“Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow.  What’s your thing, palates?”
A tiny voice whispers in his ear.
“Don’t go.”  He was sobbing.  “You’re all I have.”
Sometimes it was easier just being mad at him.

Easier said than done. In his head, Tony knows he has Steve’s unwavering support. Steve knows his struggles. Steve had
was . . . intoxicating.  Sharing the couch with him at dinner, the way Tony could differentiate the difference between the sharp, pointed heat of the hearth flames and the mellower body heat that bled from the man.  It wasn’t the exquisite beauty in his form, the smoothness of his skin, the deepness of his voice, the slight tang to his sweat.  No, it that unidentifiable
“What’s your grand plan?” Steve shouts over the crackle for flames. “You always have one.  Tell me.”
you hate dealing with them, but sad to say the media trusts you.  Your testament to Tony’s character would be far better received then anyone else’s.”
Steve smiles, forced, but there is an element of fondness mixed in with it.  “I thought you would have gold-plated couches or something.”
“That is the point.  That's Loki's point.  He hit us all right where we live.  Why?”
They said their goodbyes.  Barton and Natalasha were going back to SHEILD (though really, Barton needed serious therapy, and both could probably use a vacation).  Bruce had consented to taking up residence and a lab at the “A” Tower as everyone was calling it now.  Rogers was headed out, planning on seeing the world.
The lead agent, Coulson, took off his listening equipment and moved over towards where Steve was sitting, skimming through the digital files they had given him.   He was currently immersed in the story of one Bruce Banner.
Tony stares balefully at the gently pulsing green field located in the heart of the Ural Mountain Range. “Any guesses for what the green is?”
Tony looked down at himself.  “I’ve been naked the whole time?”
Apparently, this was how it was supposed to go.  Everyone he knew was dead.  His children were to be born in an age he didn’t know.  This age, of fast-talkers and smartphones and insincerity.
He didn’t know how much time passed before he felt Steve stretch out again, without the covers smothering him.
“How many?  What are their names?”
He could tell he is in his own bed, upstairs in the penthouse, so that was good, but it usually took a second to wrench himself from unconsciousness.  Waking was always a jolting thing for him, wrenching from one state to another, the switch moving from “Off” to “On” immediately.
“Just tell him where to look me up."
Suddenly tense, Steve made a noncommittal sound and kept his eyes straight ahead.  His tone was slightly apologetic.  “You see, Tony, I had the space prepared for someone I hope will fully join my Alastors very soon.  I have it from godly authorities that a child of Hephaestus will soon make their presence known.  I want that person to be able to develop their father’s gifts while with us.”
. It shocked him to the core how much meant it.
He fills so full, yet so empty.  Because this is what he wanted, wasn’t it?
She shushed him.  “I’ll send it on its way.  But as for Steve, he’s out on his run around the island, but he’ll be back in time for breakfast,” Natasha told him as she sorted her knives.  Tony wondered if she did that as a comforting thing.  Plenty of warriors toyed with their weapons.
“Fine. What brought this . . . episode on?”
“Tony,” the voice of a long dead man, who had been dead to Tony for his entire life.
Steve and the woman were looking down at him, faintly amused smiles on their lips.  Lightning quick, she stole the cup back from him.
Moving forward with the proceedings, clearly a practiced move, Steve deftly twisted two forefingers and thumb, teasing, swirling around the shaft, meeting at the tip, and pressing the thumb into the slit.
.  Pale silvery-brass in color, tarnishes iridescent.  6 to 6.5 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness.  Metallic luster.  Streaks brownish-greenish-black.  Cubic crystal structure.  Brittle.
“GPS says it’s straight ahead.  It won’t be well marked, but we’ll figure it out.  Our only timeline is self-imposed.”  Natasha was gently stroking the bristly hairs on the back of his neck.  Trying to soothe him, but it was only setting him more on edge.
“Well, he’s refusing hospital fare and is forcing us to smuggle in outside food, so nothing out of character,”
Morita was on the other end.  “Captain Rogers, what is your-“
Stop making excuses for yourself.  It’s not your fault that Ultron went the way he did, but you were the one messing around with playing god.  It’s done.  You can’t change the past.  But you could fucking
He’s wincing from how terrible that sounds when he hears Steve clear his throat behind him.
.  It’s awful, to think a man could believe that about himself.
“I know white gold is the ‘in’ thing right now, but yellow gold looks better on warm skin tones –“
“Money wasn’t the goal.  It was a ceremonial bet.  We got you two into a relationship.  That was what was at stake,” Nat winked as she tucked the three dollars into her pocket.
“If you swing by Detroit, head to the Henry Ford Museum.  It’s filled with cars and Americana.  Perfect for a crash course in the culture shifts, and well.  Cars.  I love cars.”
People stared as the man carried Tony away, but no one tried to stop them. They had to fight against the press of the crowd to get away from people craning their necks to get a load of the wreckage. But the man obviously knew how to navigate a crowd, and a few minutes later Tony was laid out in the front seat of a 1945 Mustang, covered in the man’s jacket as he peeled away from the Speedway.
Now it’s overwhelming and slightly unbearable, pushing and pulling against one another in sheer desperation, and every thrust reminds Tony of how deeply Steve is already lodged inside of him.
When the blast died down, the man untucked his chin from where it was hooked over Tony’s shoulder and glanced behind them. The track’s fire crew was approaching carefully, wary of sudden flares and hotspots, and as quickly as possible, began spraying powdered fire suppressants.
return home.  Howard, half-drunk already and resplendent in cloth of gold, hadn’t even glanced at him.
Steve bites his lip.  “I thought . . . you don’t have anyone in the pipeline?”
He could hear Steve answering but the words jumbled together in his head. A few other voices jumped in, making it even harder for Tony to pick apart the sounds and understand the sentences thrown at him. Geez, it really seemed he exaggerated on the drinks. A soft hand brushed his shoulder and he meet the eyeless face of the Widow. He felt himself flinch away from her but her hand held him tight. Her ruby lips moved once more and he was pulled back inside the pub by the Fairest.
I also apologize for any mistakes, I don't have a beta and English isn't my first language^^"
“From the two meetings what I’ve got was, you joke around about what happened to us with Them. You stay away from the Court and push away other changelings who tries to open to you. And you don’t help unless you’ve got something to gain for yourself.”
“... I’m sure that Fury would be happy to negotiate that with you.
“Well, I wouldn’t say no if you wanted to choke me with those thighs” Tony shrugged earning a laugh from Bucky and a choked breath from Steve. “But that would make your boyfriend jealous. Fairest don’t share.
He was holding down the Wizned wrists and pressed harder to underline his words. Tony felt the pulse in his chest beating stronger and faster. Blue light was seeping through his cotton shirt and a fleeting thought came up to him.
“It is good that you’re here among us again Tony. You should consider coming back to our neighbourhood!” Thor suddenly said, slowing down to a stop. “This was made to be our home. All together, changelings need to be with each other.
Everyone does.
Steve looked surprised at his actions and did a double-take between their leader and the wizened. Fury said to the Fairest to leave it be and they both went away to search for the client. While waiting for them, Tony let himself rest again a tronk. Rubbing his eyes and giving short slaps to his cheeks, he tried to keep himself together. A meow made him looked at his feet where Goose was lying, belly up. Soft fur on display but Tony just glared at it.
His shirt was dark with sweat and grease but thin enough for his visitor to notice the light blue halo coming from underneath it. Tony snapped his fingers, bringing back his attention to his face. That’s why he hung around with humans usually. They couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary, bless them.
“But if you’re not a changeling, what the hell are you?” he laughed. “No humans are allowed here and I doubt Fury is one to make exceptions.
They awkwardly looked at each other and Tony held out a hand.
“I’ve been home for a decade. I just haven’t… Really knew the Court existed. Not until a month ago.
A first chapter a last ! I hope you all liked it. The story will be quite slow to start (so many things to set in place) but I hope you'll like it!
think I loved Them. I didn’t survive all of this just to have an asshole claiming I
The voice was soft and feminine, making their head snap where it came from. It belonged to a slim silhouette all draped in black who seemed to appear out of nowhere. Black pantsuit, heels gliding without a noise along the concrete floor towards them, she was like a character out of a black and white film. The only touch of colour on the newcomer had was her red lips and scarlet hair that fell at her back. If Bucky perked up at the pretty lady appearance, Steve and Tony recoiled a little. Her eyes and nose were non-existent. As if someone had taken an eraser and rubbed out the details. Sure there was a bump where a nose should be and a slight cavity for where the eyes had been but that was it. Just smooth skin and yet, she moved her head as if she was taking in each of them. It was clearly unsettling. Tony envied Bucky and the fact that he could stare at the illusion instead. For changelings can see the damage made by the Fae but no one else can. The Wizened narrowed his eyes at her. If she was there since all the confrontation without any of them noticing her, she could be a Darkling. Darklings are partially made of shadows, Fury being the best example. She seemed to feel his gaze and sent him a smile that looked mischievous and sharp at the same time. Yeah. Definitely a Darkling.
An hour later -so he wasn’t as nearly finished as he thought, so what?- the mechanic was walking the duo out. Widow hadn’t said another word even if Bucky had tried to get her attention in and out of wolf form, showing off his muscles when he could and earning eye rolls from the changelings. But it made the atmosphere bearable after the nearly-fighting between Steve and Tony.
“So Tony! How is everything? How's your shop? Although, with how hardworking you are, I know your customers must leave satisfied!
"Only you would actually use wyrd as an everyday tool! Isn't it tiring?
“No matter how hard you like to play pretend the other changelings aren’t
He decided to spare marble-man some trouble.
Tony turned around with a raised eyebrow. The Fairest looked away embarrassed at being caught, for a split a second, before facing him again. At least, he didn’t shy away when caught. The Wizened turned fully towards him. He didn’t like what Steve said. He couldn’t pinpoint if it was a compliment or an insult. And maybe the changeling didn’t know it himself. Sadly for him, Tony was the kind to push and be inquisitive when something was said.
Bucky’s panicked voice couldn’t cut through them. What he could only see was those blue eyes, staring into him and he stared right back. He wanted to kick his ass but thankfully he remembered that this dude was made of marble and he would hurt himself if he tried.
Well, that was tempting: the Court did have interesting trinkets in their safe. But he wanted that mundane money too just to be able to pay his rent.
"Why are truly you here Tony? You only talked to the barkeep, and that was more of a one-sided conversation.
“You know what we say about Fairest though? It’s incredibly rare to see one escaping Arcadia. The reasons? Either they just can’t escape, or…”
He was put down on something soft. A loud booming voice that could only be Thor's announced he was going to fetch some covers. Carbonnel wanted to get up and tell them not to bother. He was going home after all. He wasn't going to just, fall asleep here. He could hold his liquor better than that. He wans't going to-
Getting up to his feet, Tony sighed, conflicted about what to do. The only positive thing in saying “yes”, to visiting the Court for a special command, was that he’ll get to pass by Valhöll. It had been a while since he visited other changelings and old friends. But there were too many negatives in falling back into their lair. He always had mixed feelings about the Court. Their intentions were all for helping the changelings who survived Arcadia in creating a new life. Yet, they had something else behind their mind in harvesting all these lost souls under their wing. Also, Fury’s an asshole and his cat was even worse. So. There’s that.
Tony waved back before stepping back inside his garage. Through the door he watched their back going further down the streets. It was the evening, the many shades of orange of the dusk bathing the city in its colours. After staring at their retreating back the mechanic went back inside with a tired expression. He still had to deal with the Widow waiting for him but he slipped to the bathroom discreetly first. He washed his face there, cooling himself down a bit, then looked at himself with tired eyes. He was the only changeling who could look human with and without wyrd. But it hasn't always been the case. Or at least, they had been one single thing that would tip people off. He closed his eyes and laid a hand over his “heart”. The first time he noticed the blue light he had completely freaked out. He would wear layers and layers of clothes, sweating non-stop, just to hide it. Now he knew how to hide it and he’ll keep it that way. It was harder when he was upset or scared when he was in the middle of creating something, but he’ll just have to push it down further down.
And that was the real issue, wasn't it? Not the Accords, not the lying, but the fact that Steve had chosen Barnes over him. And it didn't matter that Tony could
Steve chuckled, despite himself. "Old habit." He answered. At this point, it could very well be the last familiar thing he could hold on to from his time with-with the Avengers. At the compound. Where Tony was.
Tony laughed, incredulous. "Wow. Okay then, that's- I mean, I knew you didn't think much of me, but I hadn't realized just how much of a bastard you apparently believe me to be. Or how incompetent."
All of a sudden, Tony laughed. It wasn't helpless or sarcastic or bitter, it was a genuine, amused laughter, tinted with relief. "How is it, Rogers, that in one conversation, you manage to tear down everything I thought I knew about you?" He said.
"What is it with you and slaughtering sandbags when you're upset?" Sam asked, sounding genuinely curios.
who are not above the law!
"Well, damn, Steve, save some words for the proposal, will you?" Tony chuckled and Steve froze. Was-was that...? Steve tried to stop himself from getting his hopes up. But maybe he did...maybe Tony loved him, too.
"I love you. I'm in love with you." Steve hadn't thought it'd feel this good to tell him, even if he knew it would probably be the last time.
you." He said chuckling, more to himself than to Tony and the hitch of breath he heard brought him back to reality.
Sighing, he went to his room.
"Steve, you have to come up, the team's worried about you." Sam said truthfully and Steve appreciated it, he really did, but he couldn't even hear the word
, he had really said that last sentence out loud. It seems by the time they were done, Steve wouldn't have any secrets left.
When he got out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around his waist and hair still damp, Steve thought he'd started hallucinating because the burner phone was buzzing. For a moment, Steve stood there in complete shock, before it registered.
"What do you want, Rogers?" Tony said, sounding tired and resigned. Rogers. Steve hated that coming from Tony. He swallowed. It was now or never.
Just a word. "Call."
"That's not true!" Steve denied fiercely, defensive because, god, how could Tony even think that?
Sam looked at him doubtfully, but didn't push him and Steve was thankful for that.
"Tony, just-Let me say this, please." Steve said, words soft. He couldn't believe how calm he actually felt. It had never felt easier talking to Tony that it did then. And really, Tony already seemed to believe there was nothing worse that could happen between them. Might as well get everything out in the open.
That made him curios. "Tell me what?"
He couldn't do that, because the one he loved wasn't there. Steve didn't have him. He had never been Steve's and now he'd never be, because Steve had blown that up spectacularly.
believe that if I had the chance, I'd have done so many things differently. I would have told you long ago, would never let you think I didn't care, because I do. So, so much."
Yeah, Christmas miracle. Sure. It was the first Christmas Steve wasn't with the whole team since he woke up from the ice. Well, it was the first Christmas without Tony.
Steve thought humorlessly.
"Please spare me the bullshit." Tony snapped. "Look, I can admit when I fuck things up, Rogers. But this? This war that happened between us, it wasn't all my fault. Because a
"You're right." Steve said simply.
Tony was calling him.
"Tony, I'm sor-"
"Wha-What are you talking about, Rogers?" Tony asked, clearly shaken and uncomfortable. "Seriously, are you sure you're alright?"
As fast as he could, Steve grabbed the phone and answered. Well, answered might not be the right word, considering he didn't say anything, just stood there, holding his breath in anticipation and fear.
and he looked at Steve, full of hatred and at the same time pleading.
Steve stopped punching the sandbag, turning to see Sam at the door, leaning casually on the frame. Steve knew he couldn't hide forever, but it had been only two hours and honestly, he expected Sam to get the message that he wasn't really up to talk right now.
The man had just too much pride to do that.
"What?" Steve was sure he sounded like an idiot. "No! No, everybody's fine. Nothing's going on." Was that why Tony had called so suddenly? Steve felt warm at the thought that Tony would still jump at their defense the second he thought something was wrong.
"Let me get this straight, Rogers." Tony said, sounding dangerously calm. " You suddenly decide to become alive after
"You sure about that, Rogers?" Tony asked, a hint of mockery in his voice, as if he was a kindergarten teacher asking a child what had he done wrong. "Did you even read the Accords? Or did you just decide you didn't like them and therefore they were wrong because you're Captain America and God forbid we say otherwise."
"I knew I'd find you here."
"Now's not really a good time, Sam." Steve said, proud that his voice didn't crack like he thought it would.
“I know it’s my first year in your group, but do you guys always get together for birthdays?” Tony asked as he plopped on the couch with a glass of Sam’s “secret” lemonade.  (He put mint leaves and bourbon in it.  That was the secret.)
Nowadays, dragons largely keep to themselves and their shells, tending their hoards.  Dragotsennyy
he’d announced to them all, and they had just been so fucking charmed, stepping up to be Steve Rogers’ family, and Tony just couldn’t be content with just that, could he, so he’d gone and fallen in love with the bed head, the dry remarks, and the man who knew his history yet chose to believe in him.
And unlike anyone else, afterwards, Tony could lay sated in Steve’s arms, the well-toned muscle surrounding him, making him feel safe.  And loved.
*ehem* But now I present to you, Idiots in Love.
“I have unfinished business with Loki.”
of him.  Which couldn’t be right.  “Your reputation, unlike everyone else’s, precedes you.  Except maybe a few reputations we will not name, because it is unnecessary.”  Steve’s voice had risen, points of color high in his cheeks, determinedly not looking at Natasha, who was laughing at him.  “But Tony.  The things we do, you’re already doing in a sense.  I thought you might have what it takes when I saw you ten years ago.  When I began hearing stories of what you’d done . . . I
And the worst part is, he knows that if things were different, he wouldn’t drop everything for Steve.  If they were together, Tony would bitch and moan half-heartedly and Steve would smile indulgently before firing right back, and they would fall asleep together.
as he moved the device within himself, whimpering and crying out.  A slick column of red moving between well-muscled cheeks.
Steve talks as Tony does what he can to dry himself and puts on the clean clothing. Nothing of consequence, just inane chatter about missions that Tony doesn’t need to know, but it does the job of filling the still heavy air that hangs over the night like a pall, and drowning out the drip of water from outside. Tony can’t forget, not for a second, why he has called Steve here, and Steve has always remained vigilant about Tony’s drinking. But Steve does try to put him at ease when it counts, which Tony can only be grateful for.
Steve groaned.  Not in the sexy way.  “Just,” he pulled the sheet over Tony’s giggling form, “go the fuck to sleep.”
Maria, always the more vocal of the twins, had a rigid frostiness in her tone that was completely different from her usual warm softness beneath her layer of snark.
was a version of the clear gloss with sequins that Bucky loved so much, with white dots and red five-point stars.
Somewhere in the masses of warriors they found Steve, who assumed his role quite beautifully.  The only thing about his past that had come out was that he was from Athens.  None of the aristocrats knew of him, but one day he just emerged from the crowd and went to work.  There were memories of a runty armor boy also named Steve, and they looked incredibly similar except for the incredible physique that the boy would have needed to attain in several hours.  Whispers circled that Steve had been blessed by a god, or that he was the son of a god.
“‘Monster Spray’?” Tony was about to start snorting when Girl Child appeared at Barton’s hip, pouting.  “
“How so?”
Tony tries to hide from him, until he sees the sketchbook holding Steve’s heart.
Wha – why?  You’re
“Oh, it’s here!” Tony exclaimed with a little dance, jigging his butt as he jumped in place before  grabbing the box and struggling with the packing tape.
information out of people, Tony; Steve’s not one to be moved.  I love him, always, but it’s different now.  And anyway, I have Angie now.  It would have been awful to leave him for her.”
“Good to go on this end.  The rest is up to you.”
“Ah, yes.  Our beautiful Korkyra is no match for dusty Attika, boy,” a third man said playfully.  “Steve, where do you plan on taking him?”
The wick hissed in the oil, telling Tony that he should probably try for sleep. He scratched out a few more words, and held the papyrus up to read.
“I thought you couldn’t buy marital aids until you were twenty-one.”
Maria sounded so proud.
(See the end of the chapter for
It would seem awkward, keeping an intense eye contact throughout sex, but Tony does as he’s asked.  It isn’t any of the ridiculous no-blinking stare downs, Steve doesn’t complain at the flickering eyelids and rolling eyes when he presses on Tony’s prostate, but he always finds Steve’s gaze again.
” Tony grinned, snuggling down into Steve’s arms.
“Something troubles you,” Ilya tells him.
So he lets himself cling as well, he lets himself have this, because it’s damn well all he’s ever going to get, and he’ll fucking take it.
It was an odd question, and oddly pointed. “Well, I have my secretary who runs my life and nags me. My chauffer who is also a sort of personal assistant. Oh, and a butler who takes care of my parents' old house, but it’s not very often that I’m there.”
Warm fingertips grazed his jaw, as Steve tilted Tony’s head so he could meet his eyes.  “Is that why you decided to become a hero, Tony?”
“You’ll what?  Make vague threats we both know you won’t carry out?”
“So what does she do . . . ?”
Steve’s hands stilled over the StarkPad above him.  “‘Cincinnati Museum Center at Cincinnati Union Terminal’?”
The supersoldier serum had apparently affected Steve’s Y chromosome, so Peter would inherit many milder forms of Steve’s adaptations.  Excellent immune system, higher endurance, increased strength, increased flexibility and dexterity.  The small traces of serum would also enable Peter to survive
“Fuck, they got me here, and Barry and Tom back at the station.  Terry’s on call.  They don’t trust us to keep a lousy live signal?”  The man snorted, eyes drifting back to his monitors.  “Be my guest.  You’re not shutting anything off, are ya?  My supervisor will have my balls if we lose signal in the middle of a live game.”
“Are you going to get him anything?”
He should probably open his eyes, should investigate the source of the warmth, but he couldn’t bring himself to.  After several years of waking in a panic in his own bed, of taking a precious ten seconds to figure out

Clint sighed heavily.  “What?”
“A combination of things.  But . . . how do I put this?”
“Do they think mother outranks best man?” Jane asked, juggling a squirming Brandt.
“No need,” Tony
“Nnnnnhhhhoooo?”
“No, no intention of shutting anything off, but if it does, blame us.”
“Pleased to meet you,” Frigga answered.  Odin grunted.  Loki rolled his eyes.
“Come now, my dear, I am enjoying my stay in the States.  It is much warmer here,” Frigga admonished, and Tony could tell who Thor better took after.  “And I plan to stay for the next few months, and help my son and new daughter with their child.”
“I can’t want to help you? I don’t want you to backslide, Tony. You’ve come too far since then. I don’t want see the man I . . . respect and admire so much, and who has done uncountable things for the good of mankind and the universe brought down by something as little as addiction.”
Every year after that, Rhodey had extended Roberta’s invitation back, and without fail, Tony would decline.  Her diabetes got the best of her a couple of years before Tony’s captivity, and while he didn’t go to the funeral, he sent so many flowers that Rhodey later complained that his sense of smell was broken.
Steve chuckled, low in his chest but somehow hollow. “Not covert in the slightest. But special ops, sure.”
are you gathering all these people to prepare for?”
Natasha was, as always, unreadable as she assessed him.
“You have no idea.”
“Hello, sweetheart.  Mission was boring.  Bucky and Sam listened to me, imagine that.  Missed you ignoring my orders.”  Steve tried for a smile.
“Perhaps the service here is crappy?” Natasha chimed in innocently from where she was crouched the back seat of the musty van they had “borrowed”.
“Tony, you know you will not be considered actually pregnant, right?”
“Well,” he bites out, “didn’t you ask me not to?”
“I am.”
Waking up on the ground is usually bad. His cheek is pressed to what feels like some sort of smooth concrete or stone.  Not quite marble.  There isn’t any of the usual pain Tony associates with spending any amount of time on the compact surface.  There are blankets wrapped around him, with one cushioning his temple and the top of his skull.  He is curled in the fetal position.  No chains or cuffs around his wrists or ankles, so that’s good.  His gauntlet is still on.  The armor case digs into his side.  Where is he?  Damn it’s cold here.
Peter boasted gleefully.
“Well, yes, but that was to be expected.”  She whispered something he couldn’t hear and looked out the window.  A soft, cool breeze, smelling of pomegranates wafted through the window, which was odd, since the fruit did not come into season for another few months.  She stood.  “Come with me.”
That phrasing was . . . wrong.  Who said New York City?  You either said New York or specified a borough.  He voice was off.  Her inflections were off.  The only people he knew who even vaguely talked like that . . . hadn’t been born.
The oil he had been supplied with wasn’t the best, but he supposed he’d have to get used to that.  It wasn’t horrible, but it wasn’t the viscous liquid he was used to at home.  It was thinner, lighter, yellow rather than green, like the crappy stuff they sold in the agora.  Tony dabbed a bit on his tongue.  Not bad.  Not Kretan, but Korkyra didn’t seem like the place that imported things it could produce.  The only man who could probably import was his host, and Tony doubted Steve would keep the best oil for himself.  But Tony liked it better than the earthy, fuller oil that came from Athens.  Korkyran olive oil was light and fruity, with a hint of grass.
Tony choked out.
The moment his fingertips breached the current, the surface exploded.
“You can call me Tony.”
He had been wrong.  On the corkboard by the door, an assortment of colored pins had been stuck into the corner, pieces of construction paper still speared through and small bits of glitter clinging in the cracks of the wood.
Steve is standing there, looking slightly lost in the monolith of concrete and steel.  He's holding a gift bag containing a box covered in a blue ribbon, studying the lump of rock with large pyrite crystals on a side table.  With a jolt, Tony realizes Steve’s never been up here before.
“Sorry,” Cap wheezed.  “My son-“
“Well, look at

After he found his clothing, he dressed in a linen peplos, feeling anything else would look like he was trying to show off, though he didn’t deny himself a golden fibula or his amulet.  Deciding having all the trunks out wouldn’t be the best for his shins, he dragged the armor-filled trunks into a corner and set up the one with clothing by the bedstead.
Tony feels his stomach gurgle.
Note to self.  Vibranium plus the core of a neutron star can apparently flatten a forest.
Steve shook Tony’s offered hand, warm and dry with a strong grip, but his palm was oddly soft. “Steve Rogers. Well, technically Steven Grant, but I can’t see you caring. Former US Army.”

to share, they just couldn’t for some reason), but almost immediately, Tony felt included.
“Thank you, JARVIS,” she smiled at the ceiling, before turning back to Steve.  “Am I clear?”
Pepper walked over, greeting him like an old friend.
“You know basic reproduction, yes?”
“Yeah?”  Barton was scowling as he scavenged for arrows.  “Get in line.”
He’d grown up surrounded by people claiming blue eyes were so gorgeous, because they show such emotion.
– and turned towards Steve.  “You’re staying with me?”
“Yes.  She had a son, Phaeax.  He and someone history forgets to name had at least three sons, Alkinoos, Lokrus, and Rhexenor.  Rhexenor had a daughter, Arete, who married her uncle Alkinoos.  They had six children: Laodamas, Halius, Klytoneus, Minyas, Echetus, and daughter Nausikaa.  All of the sons except Echetus left the island for other colonies, so the man I knew as Erskine was left to keep the throne.  He married, but had no children.  It was believed to be part of Poseidon’s curse.  Which is strange, because the brothers who left were able to have children.  Sam’s mother was a daughter of Halius.  But Erskine did his duty.  He was pretty old when the Hydric War started, but he came with what few soldiers he had.  He, um, died in the last year.  He claimed me as his heir on his deathbed.  That’s the basics of the monarchy.”
“But I didn’t
“No one’s watching!”
“That you want to hear . . . ?” Tony can’t say he hasn’t entertained the idea of Steve’s reciprocation, but if it is
Wheezing, Tony shook his head.
It’s nice, like this. They aren’t yelling, they aren’t throwing caustic accusations, they aren’t rushing to save the world. Just Steve and Tony, calmly discussing Tony’s alcoholism with some cautious joshing. It’s something that Tony needs to try getting a bit more of in his life. Despite how heart-wrenching it is to think of the
They once again lull into silence. It’s weighted, but not as tense as before. Steve is visibly fighting with himself over saying something, but Tony can’t for the life of him pin it.
“Oh my god, I have
Steve pulls him into his arms, and it’s the same and different, because he’s so familiar with Steve’s embrace but know he doesn’t have to break it off, doesn’t have to hide what he’s feeling, he can stay in the warmth as long as he likes. This is coming in from the cold Russian winter and chucking your thermal mittens away, because
The heat chamber was used to test how well vehicles would respond to extreme temperatures in the natural environment, so the room wouldn’t get too dangerously hot if one limited their time inside. By the time Tony arrived, limbs and heads were steadily emerging from the ice. He would have to request to see Shapanka’s ice-making blaster, but it wasn’t likely he was using liquid nitrogen. He mentally kicked himself for not keeping a better eye on Shapanka, but what happened had happened, with no major damage. The man hadn’t killed anyone, and most of what he had stolen would likely be recovered soon enough.
“I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.  I've seen the footage.  The only thing you really fight for is yourself.  You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.”
“As a team,” Steve agreed.
“C’mon, Stebe.  Do ‘t fr’ meee?” Tony slurred from between them.  He had been out from his painkillers for several hours.
“What’re you sorry for?  Not like you could have prevented getting frozen.  Not like you could have made Howard be a better father.”  He was still pulling on the toe of his sock, probably irreparably stretching the seam out.
“I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?”
They never yelled at him, their disapproval just grew, and Tony was forced to drink more to stave off the feelings of worry and concern.
“And my sword is more of a secondary, finish-the-job weapon.”
When he awoke, he allowed for a moment of self-hatred.
Tony bit his lip, trying not to just shove her away, but the possessive clench of her fingers would likely soon draw blood. He turned his torso, breaking her hold. “It’s just a number! Superstition and magic lie only in fairy tales! Everything can be explained in this day and age, with science and technology at everyone’s fingertips –“
“No, it - it's alright.  I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.”
And the true weight of what they had done hit him.  He had
“No.”
“If it makes it easier, just a piece of paper that says ‘I, Steve Rogers, do so solemnly promise that I am after Tony Stark for his heart, not his coffers.’  I don’t really care if either of us gains a little weight.”
“Okay then.  Let me draw you.”
“Steve, you okay?” Tony looked scared.
“Don’t
They get the leg braces on, and take the stairs slowly.
Steve gave Tony the painkillers and a glass of water, also thinking to grab one of his numerous tablets and the stack of papers Pepper had left with SI letterhead.  Tony snatched the tablet but wrinkled his nose at the paperwork.
Not SSR agents then.
It takes two days of sitting at a workbench, creating massive feats of engineering, trying to avoid thinking of
The producer counted down, gesticulating to the screen holding the cropped images of two nigh-on elderly white men.  He host, and Senator Stern, one of the Avengers most vocal opponents.  There red light was blinking, a fuzzy mic was dangling a few inches out of the shot.  The host was introducing him.
“Shapanka,” Tony growled, “better leave now before I get cold feet about releasing you.”
Except for the paint, it was just as he remembered it.
“Why?”
Because he still has Steve, albeit not as fully as he might want him.
Tony laughed.  “Yeah.  It’s
“Never said it was.  It is, in a sense, completely fucked up.”  He pauses to let Steve have his little laugh.  “But if we want to change it, we have to play along for a while.  We gave to sit through boring meetings and wheel and deal with unsavory characters.  It sucks.  But we can’t just say ‘no’ anymore.  It’s not yes or no, black or white, up or down.  The world is grayscale.  Everything happens in degrees.  And everything is up for interpretation.  Twisted, more like.  Something sane and reasonable can snowball into the bane of humanity
towards the palace.  The fresh scent of the olive and plane trees was obstructed by the cooking fires that were only just now being started.  At the front gates of the palace, the watchman was calling out as the slaves threw open the inner gates, taking the reins and guiding the horse into the courtyard.
The Raft had been breached.  Which was disappointing apparently.  No pet superheroes for Ross to play with anymore.
“We’re next,” Steve said out of nowhere.
“No, but I’m still confused as to why you asked me to marry you.  But I’m not gonna just let you go, either.”  Tony burrowed deeper into Steve’s embrace.
Steve’s laugh, bright like sunlight, burst forth. “I think I can pay attention to Happy’s turns. So, what do I need to know about . . . well, SI?”
“I’m a dragon.” Zoloto nods again.  He crumples, laughing hard enough to make his ribs hurt.  “Would you believe that’s not the weirdest thing that someone’s ever told me?”
He had taken Tony in to his doctors this morning, and Tony had insisted Steve be present in the room throughout checkup.  Tony had “accidentally” forgotten that he didn’t need to be completely nude to show the doctors his stitches.
Steve didn’t know what to do.  He had refused to keep Bucky away from anything, remembering how he had felt during his integration process, but now he was wondering if the shock of it all had been too much.  Seventy years, aliens, Steve’s relationship with Howard’s son, it was all strange.  Steve wanted to help, but he couldn’t think of anything else to do.
He opened the projection screens, revealing the files on the candidates for the Avenger Initiative.  Himself.  Dr. Banner / Mr. Hulk.  The three-thousand year-old Norse god, who must be god of man ponytails.  And a new file for the newly-thawed Captain America.  Hello, daddy issues, thy name is Tony Stark.
He should drop his arms, move away, run from the room.
He pretends to be asleep, and Steve always presses a kiss to his brow.
“Man, that orange will help save America.  Hand it over.”
“Mm-hmm.  I need to talk to Steve.”
Tony rushed over and cleared a couple of attendants away. He placed a hand on Steve’s wet and chilly cheek, and rubbed a thumb over his eyelids. Steve’s straw-colored hair was plastered to his face, and was still half-encased in ice.
Tony started retching.
,” Tony puffed, but honestly, he didn’t feel too terrible.  The entire time, Steve had run back and forth like a distracted dog, cutting him off and doubling back, sometimes running backward at twice the speed Tony could manage.  At first Tony though Steve was just showing off, but as time when on he suspected this was Steve’s way of trying to keep pace with Tony’s much inferior speed.
“Look, all of us-“
“Morning,” said the . . . nurse, he supposed.  Except she didn’t look like any nurse he had ever seen.  His mother never would have dressed in clothes mean for an office.  Nor would she have dreamt of having her hair down or wearing makeup, especially lipstick that dark.  He couldn’t place his finger on every single thing wrong with her, but she wasn’t like anyone he’d ever seen.  She checked her watch.  “Or should I say afternoon.”
more than you ever needed to know about that in the first place.  Let’s just say Steve is a man who expects monogamy.  I can’t give him that, not in my line of work, and I could never move to Korkyra.  How he lives there,” she shivered, “I don’t know.”
“I’m just putting this out there, Tony.  You don’t need to take this as a serious proposal –“ Steve stuttered.
“So what do you need exactly. If Fury called for me, I guess it isn’t just an arm you need. Ask away, don’t be shy, I’m good at my job.
"Don't read too much into it: sometimes it's just relaxing to be around other people like you. That's it.  What about you Rocky? Trying to drown your sorrows in some good wine and get blissfully drunk?
“Goose is not mean, he has good taste.” The King of the Court commented coldly.
"Heh, you get used to it. Plus it's not as if I have a choice in that matter. I was a mechanic as a human. It was already a part of me when I.. Well, you get me. It's just second nature to me."
Sorry for the long wait! This chapter was supposed to be longer but I decided to end it here because it seemed more natural for the plot. In the next chapter we'll have more of Steve and Tony bickering! And bucky being tired of them.  ;)
He was dropped with a laugh. Thor took advantage of his height and ruffled the older man’s hair, leaving it standing up and filled with static electricity.
"I make sense I guess. I wish I could understand why They changed me the way they did.
"No. I don't think that's a good idea. Give me that drink." Steve took Thor's special 'mead' and set it further away from Tony who let out a sad noise at the action. "I think it's enough for this evening.
.” The Fairest growled, eyes blues sparkling with anger.
“My name’s Steve.
The Fairest glared at him but didn’t comment. It wasn’t hard to guess that Tony didn’t get his old life back. He couldn’t disagree, he was blessed with his life but calling him lucky… Bucky sent a worried look towards his friend and Steve blinked slowly at him with a quirk of his lips.
"Every Sunday, after all, it's the day the Lord took a nap, didn't he?
So why not mix with other creatures or plain humans? Fury claimed it was for the wellbeing of his Court. If, for example, every werewolf learned about changelings, they will get curious. And since changelings don’t have much power or control over their wyrd, if they are seen as monsters or threats they won’t stand a chance. Better to hide from everyone, to concentrate on sheltering and grouping all of the changelings together. Barnes was the exception. Why? Because he had a pal changeling?
(See the end of the chapter for
The blond was alone, surprisingly, with just a glass for company. Most changelings were frowning back, looking at him like some sort of oddity that was out of place. The Wizened hesitated for a couple of seconds. He was leaving after all. Going to leave just to turn back and sit with Steve would break his dramatic exit. Then again... Steve was probably trying to fit into this strange community and no one was taking the time to see him. The Wizened sighed and turned towards him. With a new determination, He went to sit down in front of him, taking the man by surprise.
"Let's just take you home. You live right above your garage right?"
“Do pass by the bar after your affairs Tony. It would be good to talk.”
“I-Well, sorry. Again. I shouldn’t stare.
He’ll give it to Fury though: if he gets a werewolf on his side it could be useful. And it won’t be the Wizened problem anyway. He’s just there to fix the arm and then, bye-bye! He will be left in peace by the Court.
“I will show you one of our gateways to Arcadia”
“Well, well. That went poorly.”
The left arm of Barnes was missing from the shoulder. He bowed slightly his head in salute. Maybe he was a knight of the Court’s who lost his arm for their safety.
Thor looked at him with sad eyes, his smile still plastered on his lips. Guilt twisted Tony’s stomach as he realized how harsh he was on him. He couldn’t blame the larger changeling for trying to move on from their past and Thor didn’t deserve the anger when he had only ever be kind to him.
But that is one of the many wonderful things about the Avengers. They don’t need alcohol to throw a great party.
“Sustainability. Legality. When I started out, circumstances were different, but circumstances change. They think the government would be in trouble if I continued under their banner. And right now, it would just be me.” Steve bit his lip and considered his words. “There are others out there, who do what I did, but none of them are publicly connected to any government organization. So, maybe I could go rouge and start again, but I’m most comfortable working with a partner or team. And there aren’t any teams out there right now.”
Some of us more so than others, Steve though blearily.
looking lost but full of hope at a new life after the last one undoubtedly fell apart. And Tony could give him that. Steve looked to be the kind of guy in need of purpose in his life. He needed to be doing something good, for the betterment of humanity. And Tony worked in that field already.
Feeling numb, Steve left the phone on his night stand and went to take a shower.
Tony was angry. And hurt. Steve couldn't do this to him. "Stop fucking with me Rogers, or I swear-"
a cruel voice in his mind offered and Steve felt his heart clench painfully at the thought. Sam's words echoed in his mind and Steve sighed deeply.
Tony was breathing heavily, his anger burned out to leave a deep sadness and Steve's eyes tingled with tears that he refused to let out. He didn't agree with he Accords, really, and maybe he never would, but Tony was right, they all let the Accords divide them, they didn't trust each other and look where it got them.
"Things like this don't happen to me, Steve." Tony repeated. "I don't- Pepper always said I loved to easily and too deeply, but people never-never, you know-"
"I love you." Steve whispered, just because he could now.
"I'm not!" Steve almost shouted, panicked. "I'm not, really, I do love you."
"I know I may never agree with you on the Accords-"
"Huh. Well," Steve could almost see the grin that was undoubtedly splitting Tony's face in half. "This wasn't the way I thought I'd spend Christmas' Eve."
It all came back to Tony.
Tony was shocked and touched and freaking out, because Steve loved him, Steve loved him back!
"I am nowhere near drunk enough to be making this up," Tony grumbled, running a hand through his hair and, yeah, Steve finally let a tear roll down his face. He knew it would hurt, Tony rejecting him, and Steve knew he'd never been able to stop loving Tony. This really was hopeless.
the name made Steve's stomach turn, guilt eating at him, coupled with intense longing. Steve knew that he should really get a hold of himself, but every time he thinks he's actually doing better, something happens and it all comes crashing down again.
"Went better than you expected?"
"I'm sure you'd all like to. Too bad you're fugitives from the law." Steve said and immediately wished he could take it back. Instead, he looked away from Sam, sighing and rubbing his eyes. He was tired.
, like this was ever about the Accords!" Tony interrupted, venom in his voice.
"Is it ever?" Sam said and now he sounded tired. "Natasha dropped by earlier."
"You know I read them." Steve said through gritted teeth.
"Don't hang up." Steve said immediately, panic surging through him. "Please don't hang up."
After the second beep though, Steve seemed to realize that it was really Tony on the other side, it was Tony who'd pick up the phone (if he hadn't already thrown it away the second he got it) and promptly hung up.
After a moment, Sam left and Steve wished the floor could swallow him whole.
"I don't think you've ever realized this, but since I woke up from the ice, I had no one. Nothing. The Avengers gave me a purpose. Somewhere to belong. But you, Tony...you gave me a home."
"But then came the whole thing with SHIELD and once more I felt as if I lost everything. I didn't know who to trust, was still dealing with an overwhelming new world. And then finding Bucky..." It was risky, mentioning him to Tony, and for a second he held his breath, but Tony seemed determined to listen, so he didn't say anything. "You were right when you said I was compromised, because Bucky was the last piece of my past, the last familiar thing I could hold onto from the life I had lost and I didn't want to give that up. And I needed to find him, keep him safe. I owed him that."
Steve froze. "...What?"
, but he couldn't help it. If there was something Steve couldn't stop doing, it was standing up for what was right. And the Accords weren't.
"I'm sorry," Steve said, miserable and guilty and so, so sorry. "Please, even if you can never trust me again, even if I have no right to ask this,
"She said to 'call'." Sam repeated, and Steve could see he was going for a casual tone. Sam obviously knew who Nat had meant when she said that. Steve wondered whether the other knew. Had Natasha told them, or was he just that obvious?
Steve froze, as if he'd been thrown in the middle of a blizzard. He kind of...kind of wanted to laugh because Tony couldn't have been more far off if he'd tried. But to think that's what Tony believed hurt. Not when Steve cared so much about him, not when he lo-
that it wasn't like that, that he could see why, because still- it
Tony was audibly thrown off. "I'm, I'm what?"
"Hey, we made that choice." Sam said, voice determined and leaving no place for arguments. "It was our decision to side with you and we stick by it."
Steve couldn't think of a time in his life he had been happier. "I am."
Steve loved him.
The fear, the reality that he had lost Tony.
He fiddled with the buttons, closing and opening the phone for a good ten minutes, wondering if he should call, or just send a message. Steve knew he said he'd be there if that's what Tony needed, but now, months after sending Tony that letter, he knew Tony would never call (unless of course, there was a world wide threat, and even then, Steve doubted Tony'd immediately ask him for help).
There should have never been sides to begin with.
Steve bit his tongue to stop himself from saying something he'd later regret. God, he had missed Tony, but in that longing, he'd forgotten just how goddamn irritating he could be.
When he woke up, body covered in cold sweat and shivering from the horror of what he'd seen, Steve would reach at the side of the bed for his shield, just to remember it wasn't there. That it wasn't there, because
"Look, Wanda cooked enough to feed five super-soldiers and come on, man, it's Christmas. After all that has happened, we should spend it with the people we love."
"-But I know I'd do anything to change what happened between us in Siberia." Steve finished forcefully, because Tony HAD to know, he had to know how much he regretted that, how much Steve wished he hadn't been such a coward and told Tony the truth.
"That's literally what you signed up for." Steve said bitterly at the last one. "That's what the Accords do, Tony, they restrict you! You may as well be Ross' lapdog now!" Steve knew it was a mistake, Tony himself said it better than he ever could,
Tony saw that all screens had turned on and hands made of cables and wires had started to crawl around them. He blinked a few times, surprised at himself, he knew the workshop reacted to his moods but it never turned violent against something. He noticed Dum-E rolling around, letting out a long beep worriedly. The mechanic waved at him to back off and the claw lowered itself, obedient. Steve and Bucky looked at the place brimming with wyrd and Bucky let out a sigh. Anxious but still admirative.
So... About the fun.
“We have Elementals, Darklings, Beasts and Ogres. A whole menagerie for you to discover Marble.
Tony lift his head to ask her more about it, but the Widow was gone. Message delivered. The Wizened looked back down at Potts and sighed. Was she close to that other him? Was she still mourning like Jarvis and it’s why she was looking for him? Even though, she won’t get any answers from him. He couldn’t speak for that Fae version of himself.
"You took my drink remember? I think it counts."
Was an exception.
Tony Carbonnel is called to the Court. They need him for something special.
Tony worries about Potts so the solution to that is... Valhöll
But the now woke up marble creature wouldn’t let him go. The grip was strong and
Widow siped her glass and Tony left his stool, ready to leave this place. Not before grabbing the plate with the doughnuts. He would send the plate back to the pub. Maybe.
“I got clients here too you know. Leaving for even an hour is bad for business.” he drawled letting himself fall onto his chair, clearly unmotivated.
“I’m not a fairest. I’m a…” he stopped. Looking at Tony in a way the mechanic knew oh too well.
“Let’s try this again. My name’s Tony Carbonnel and I won’t stare at you creepily when you sleep again.”
“I didn’t sign for this.”
He didn’t really believe that though. He thinks of Thor in particular, who is always smiling and trying to lift people’s spirits up. Even Tony himself could be a people person if he wanted to. The wizened realised that was all he had since he didn’t like any other changelings. (Or, if we were honest, he didn’t bother to try to know and like any other social being. Thor managed to get through because he couldn’t stop even if he tried.)
“You drag me here, after harassing me for weeks-
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you, buddy.” Tony warned. “That thing is also a changeling and a mean one at that.
“Then don’t assume shit about me. If you had a decade to heal, I’ve only been back for four years and no family waiting for me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Resting against the table with all of the mechanic tools, the werewolf dropped the leftover screws he had in his hands and smiled with his teeth. Very pointy teeth. If he thought that was intimidating, well, it was. But Tony had seen worse and just sniffed back hauntigly at him.
“That’s for the ‘dog-person’ comment. Don’t push your luck Carbonnel.” the wolf warned him, half-serious.
Widow stepped and sat next to him, nodding a thanks at Thor who slid a glass with some red liquid towards her. Tony was 97% sure it was blood. Darklings were creepy enough to do that. The other 3% leaned towards cranberry juice (because that was also a level of creepy in Tony's mind).
“What’s the deal with the ring?"
Tony sent a side glance to Steve. Fury didn’t seem to be charmed or influenced by the fairest. So it couldn’t be just because he fluttered those white eyelashes of his. So Fury probably needs a werewolf. Give him an arm, offer a community of changelings for his friend, and get yourself a loyal doggy.
, with his suitcase full of tools and an obvious lack of enjoyment on his face.
And with that last sentence, he stepped aside and showed him a large door covered in vines, nettles and brambles. Tony raised and slipped his hand between the stinging leaves and thorns, feeling it slowly wrapping itself around his limb. Then his shoulder, then his face and neck. The unkempt weeds finally wrapped around him and pulled him to the other side of the wall.
“Thor...  Y-you're squishing my air pipe!”
“Et Tu Brutus?
But he very quickly pushed it away and answered back with as much energy.
“In due time, if it’s needed.
“Do I? Maybe you’re right. Maybe it’s just a bit presumptuous to think you know me after the second meeting.
The Fairest looked like he wanted to push but didn't. He just pulled his glass closer with a sigh. Tony, not one to appreciate awkward silences, bounced back with a new question:
“Why do you keep calling me a fairest?” sighed the man, obviously confused and annoyed at the choice of words.
Cold hands gently grasped the Wizened and pulled him upwards. Tony titled into his arms, not really steady on his feet.
Tony, Bucky and Steve were all sitting in the closed
“You were taking too long.” she uncrossed her arms and rested herself against the wall. “I am here on behalf of Fury, as you have probably guessed.
“That sucks. Can’t imagine what I would do with my evening if I couldn’t get shitfaced.
“Well aren’t you a lucky one.” Tony mumbled under his breath.
Well. Nearly no one.
non-humans in their world? Shouldn’t you warn people so they don’t get into trouble? Tony rubbed his temples and tried to calm down.
Alas the more he thought about it, the more he was hesitant. Even as they’d set the date and tools, they haven’t said much on what they wanted for him. He hated that, not being able to know what they had planned for him.
“Please don’t.” Steve asked with a pleading tone.
"The carvings and speels will come after I made the entire prosthetics. The wyrds follow the flow of every joint that will then help with the shifting and the morphing.  I can change the prosthetics in one shape to another but it needs to activate itself when he shifts right? That's the issue, I can't seem to understand exactly how the shift works and how to accord it to the arm... Paw. Let's call it Parm.
He's shy? No that couldn't be, especially after he saw him confronting him back in his workshop. Still, the Wizened have to admit that it was slightly strange: he has all this handsome marble creature thing going on and he didn't have a crowd of groupies around him? I mean, there is yourself? Which didn't count. Nope.
Goose narrowed its slit pupils at that sentence before giving another sound of outrage. The wizened could only imagine the many orders and insult in it. Then, to his surprise, the ginger cat got up and rubbed himself against his legs. Tony felt his fear and anger seeping from his limbs, he slid down against the tree and let the cat settle on his legs.
Tony raised from his chair but a large hand landed on his shoulder, stopping him from jumping on the redhead. Thor glared down at both of them, his usual smile gone to scold them.
"No. I won't, I'm still mad at him.
Steve made a face at his question. Or maybe it was the nickname? To be fair, it was a shitty nickname, he needed to find another.
"Let's n- you know what, you will do it anyway.
The wizened bristled at that and sneered right back, without missing a beat.
“Not him Carbonnel.” a familiar, deep, voice called behind him.
He was looking for a sign of wyrd, a sign of his time in Arcadia. Normally, changelings had a particular physical trait that only over changelings could see (due to the fact they were all modified and filled to the brim with the Fae’s magic). Thor had his long blond hair that fizzled moved and twist as if the wind was always caught in it. if it wasn’t the hair it was the eyes that turned white when he would get too excited and the air would grow heavy around him.  Tony…
“You thought I was a statue not even two seconds back. Pretty sure you didn’t notice me then.” drawled the Fairest, clearly unpleased at being called ‘granite’.
“Whatever. Now that we know Mister Rock-of-Wonders is not my client may I know for who am I here for?” he drawled at the King of Changelings.
“Yes. We’ve heard about the fake humans They put when they kidnap people. I didn’t have one so when I came back I just… Walk back into my mundane life, or at least tried to.” he cleared his throat, the memory of it coming back to him and making him uneasy. “I don’t know why either They didn’t do it. Fury told me that I’m the first changeling to whom it happened.”
Chastised, Tony didn’t comment back on it. The King may be right but at the same time, his workshop felt specifically like
“Sure, even if there are more werewolves than redheads on this earth.” Bucky answered back at the mechanic who nodded along. the wolf then tilted his head curiously and proceeded to share his own thoughts.
"From what? Are you in trouble?"
himself out to your… Workplace.
“That’s reassuring…
He crushed the picture in his hands. He’ll be careful and move on.
“I- What you don’t?” Tony shook his head and pulled to break free again. “You know what, who cares, let me go! I didn’t realize you were a living thing.”
“We’re nearly finished anyway. Bucky, I need to see you in wolf form. Steve…Stand over there, look pretty and don’t bother me.”
"Do not blame your lack of talent in eating on us Carbonnel."
“Of course! I just need to first make a prosthetic for you as a human, then one for you as a wolf, then I'll improvise a bit-
“I have a name.
Finally, after a couple of minutes, three silhouettes walked towards him. Goose perked up and pounce from the changeling’s lap, digging its claws in his thighs as he did. Tony gasped and look at the scratches on his trousers.
It didn’t twist and change to his will. It just… Had a mind of his own. No big deal.
"If it's not a "regal" like you said, I want my money back.
“Ah, Thor! Yeah, he is. He’s a kind soul, don’t tell him I said that. Since you’re a dog person you would get along with him: he acts like such a puppy sometim-OW!” Tony yelped and pointed his pen at Bucky, while rubbing his side. “What the fuck you threw at me?
“Huh, it’s a recessive gene? Like redheads?
Fury was… Strange even for a changeling. Half of his face and body was made out of shadows. The skin seemed to fume, black mist that coiled around him, sometimes shifting on his skin like clothes. Even when you shook his hand, it seemed as if his fingertips were intangible and will turn to smoke. Only one eye would peer at you, actually looking like -well- normal. Slinking between his legs and running up towards Tony, a ginger cat miauled at the guests. The Fairest actually smiled softly at the cat and held out his hand to pet it.
Broken toys? That was his work Fury destroyed behind his back. It was not him being childish, it was him feeling betrayed.  It was the fact that he didn't ask or didn't even try to talk to him before going behind his back. He wasn't going to forget that easily. Widow was right in one way, Fury didn't see them as pets, he just was their King. That meant he gets to act without caring about the consequences.
"He has a job and a life a part of being my friend. Plus I thought I wouldn't do any harm to talk to other changelings.
“So tell me Bucky, how one is born a werewolf?” Tony asked while taking the measurements needed for the werewolf’s arm. (And also desperate to change to tone of the conversation.)
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you saying that I am not of good taste? Fuck you.”
But the man shook his head. he got up to his feet and -okay he was, even more, taller now- peered curiously at Tony.
“Help Barnes. We will pay you your fees for the material of the prosthetics and for the price of the enchantment, once you’ve complete and finished it-
“I knew Fury lied when he said you were house-trained.” Tony snarked back. “Remember who’s making your arm.”
Tony leaned in, standing in a close face to face with the beautiful changeling, and, with all the spite he had, whispered:
"No." he mumbled. "I'll walk alone. On my own." he stumbled slightly.
A moment at Carbonnel's Garage.
"You don't mind? I actually can get drunk and I feel like having a bit of fun. And for God's sake have a doughnut. "
"Some people say storms and thunder could be linked to temper but you don't seem to be the type to blow up at people and storm away." Tony tried jokingly. He wondered if Thor ever used his wyrd. After all, elementals can't really use their magic in everyday life.  Thor seemed surprised by his statement, his happy facade cracking for a second before letting out a soft chuckle at the changeling.
“They don’t
“It is such a pleasure to see you back so soon! Have you lost weight? You feel lighter than last time…”
"Don't waste it for us Thor. Not every one of us deserves it."
She stopped a few meters away from them, crossed her arms and smiled.
“I'll give it to you: that was pretty badass.”
Thor lifted Tony a bit higher with a thoughtful frown, unbothered by the squirming man in his hands. The Wizened could hear the snickers and laughter from the people around and tried to shut them up with a glare. Unsurprisingly it didn't work.
“Sometimes I feel like this is a piece of Arcadia you’re brought in our world. And you’re still surprised I don’t trust you.” the mechanic suddenly snapped, stopping in his tracks.
"Gonna take me home Rocky?" he slurred with a smirk. "You didn't even buy me a drink.
“It has been too long!
“Well, there is only one reason why changelings walk through this door and it’s not for my charming self, sadly. What does the cyclops want now?”
“No one wants any remembrance of Arcadia, Carbonnel. But we influence our lairs with our soul no matter how much we hate it. Many changelings came here, slept, and live a full life within these walls. This isn’t just me. Also, you can’t say you haven’t impacted your own home yourself.”
"I don't think that's the right phrasing-
Still, he couldn’t take any risk. He needed to make him stop thinking about it.
“And you Rocky? Did you hang a bit in Valhölh?” He must be popular since he’s a new face in the pub.
The “living thing” sneered at that, the grimace not breaking that unnatural beauty he had, before letting him go. Tony felt back on his butt, in a very ungraceful manner, before rising to his feet huffing, embarrassed.
Steve gave a genuine smile and waved goodbye as he went back to join Bucky on the street.
” the man growled in a menacing voice.
“The name is Widow. I was sent here to meet up with Tony Carbonnel. Didn’t expect to interrupt such a dramatic lover’s quarrel.”
this.” Steve spat out with fury.
Tony raised an eyebrow and didn’t bother with a response. Instead, he turned back to Bucky, now really curious.
“You’re a Fairest!” realised Tony in a shaken voice. “The fuck you were doing sleeping here?!”
Until next time ~
“Is that your way of flirting with me?
“I mean.” the Fairest let a smirk appear on his lips. “It’s not like I didn’t make the same jokes. And he is making your arm. Fury had sung your praises when he talked about you. Will you truly be able to link the arm to his shifting?
Steve had the decency of looking shaken at the revelation and, finally, let himself be pulled away by a frantic Bucky. Tony will give him points for trying: he could still feel the heavy mass crushing him and the cold hands around his wrists and shoulder. Bucky clearly had trouble moving his friend about with the weight of him.
"Cherry and beer, a new recipe. You don't mind tasting it for me?
“Tony!”
“Still not saying sorry. No one stays here to take a nap.
"Do you do that often?
“Emails and phone calls count you cyclops! And you just threw me in front of a Werewolf? I didn’t even know werewolves were a thing!
"Because your pride couldn't handle a few broken toys?"
“Virginia Potts. She seemed to be looking deeply into you, a bit too deeply. Since she was around when your fake died you might have a little visit from her and it’s better to warn you about it.”
