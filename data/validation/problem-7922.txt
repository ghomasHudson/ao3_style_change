“Wait, what were you doing in New York looking for me like it’s
Rogers laughed, eyes crinkling with relief. His thumb unconsciously stroked Tony’s knuckles with delicate care.
“For what?”
“Christmas Eve, too. Very romantic, Cap,” he teased, smile growing as Rogers shot him a small but genuine smile.
Accords? Lie to me for another two years? Finish what you didn’t in Siberia?”
blinked back at them. He gently squeezed Tony’s hand, a painfully soft look on his face.
“Technically, it’s Christmas now,” he said, glancing down at his watch. Sure enough,
“Marvelously Cinematic, huh?” Peter asked his brother as the alts gathered across from them, not looking particularly pleased. James just smirked.
“I’m just hoping they were from another earth, not our timeline, otherwise we might start seeing some ill effects from those fights,” Dad said. “At least they disappeared fairly quickly.”

“Can I come with you? I can give you a hand looking for him,” he offered.

not. A kid like that would be… she hated to think it but she had to:
“Did you ever think about what I want?” Kate asked, somewhat hysterical. She knew her voice was high pitched and practically squeaky. “My mother is

fault, that much was clear. Even if it wasn’t something they’d done, even if it wasn’t something they’d knowingly been party to, it was obvious that the weird AIM agents had been after MCU Steve. Somebody wanted him, and they were willing to tear 3490 apart to get him. James stood in the doorway as they approached. Alts. It was
“Moles,” Natasha spoke from just behind him, her arms crossed. “You suspect moles in SHIELD.”
Antonella stood with 3490 Steve, conversing quietly with the doctor. Tony only caught snippets from his seat—“ecstasy” and “will know better when she wakes up if”. Tony didn’t wholly understand what had happened. Francis and James sat across from him and some of the Avengers from both worlds—Tony had, in the chaos, lost track of who was who, and could not for the life of him tell the Clints apart, or the Bruces or Natashas or Thors. The Janes were simple given their age difference, but that was the only pair that was. The two boys looked guilty and utterly worn out. James had a nasty cut above his eye and Francis had a split lip and an amount of blood on his shirt that was not appropriate to his given injuries. Tony knew only that Kate had overdosed, that the boys had gotten into a fight with some other guy (who was probably being treated at the same hospital if the blood on Francis’ shirt was anything to go on) and that now everyone was crowding up the hospital hallway. Peter had been called, and 3490 Happy (who had also informed 3490 Pepper who insisted on coming down) had picked him up and brought him to the hospital, dressed in pajama pants and an oversized coat, obviously having jammed his feet into shoes without socks or even bothering to really tie them. Tony had initially been surprised that none of the Avengers went home, that none of them went back to their own families. But after a while, he wasn’t surprised at all anymore.
“I can’t believe my ears—“
She’d seen pictures before and heard the stories, but seeing that monstrous face that was, literally, just a red skull with eyes—well, Kate was once again gaining an understanding about the phrase
“Steve, I had my reasons, you have to understand—” Antonella began, but Steve didn’t let her finish. His tone went from hurt to furious.
“It’s a gateway between worlds. Or, it will be. I saw it in Antonella’s private lab at SI. I only got a quick look, but it was enough to get the basic structure of the thing—problem is, I don’t know
It wasn’t just Kate, either, or Peter (who Tony

“GET UP, PARKER!” Flash shouted. It was, in fact, exactly what Peter was attempting, but as soon as he’d made it to his hands and knees, Flash swung down and punched him in the gut, sending him right back to the ground. Tony winced in sympathy. The kid was taking a

and you look like I’m telling you the dog died.”
“Well, stock’s about to take a dive, that’s for sure. Can we get some wine with this dinner? I think I need it,” Other Pepper said, resigned. Tony felt an enormous rush of relief and a tender love for Other Pepper. The others seemed to take their cue from her, and soon enough she and Steve had so many drinks orders it was a good thing Tony’d had a very short stint with a guy who was a bartender. She and Steve passed out drinks for everyone to go with their hardy dinner of steak and potatoes (Tony figured they could use the good food, after news like that). Tony even allowed Peter and Kate to have a glass of wine each—a luxury she never allowed for fear they’d develop a taste for it, but she did feel a bit grateful that her children hadn’t made a fuss when they’d informed them that their guests would be invading their personal home for an extended period of time (though Kate had rolled her eyes and sighed heavily). Tony, therefore, was the only one at the table without any alcohol. She was drinking carbonated water instead. Among her own Avengers, this never raised any eyebrows, so she wasn’t expecting it when Other Clint piped up:
Tony tried desperately to get out of her armor. There was no automatic, emergency release. She had to release catches on each piece individually. Was her ARC still working? She didn’t know. She hoped so, or she might stop breathing here soon.
assumption, that did it. One of the landmines didn’t go off and a single man got through. I heard a couple of shots go off from the wrong direction, so I turned around and took him out, but it was too late. Bucky had been shot in the chest three times. He bled out as I held him, and my boys staved off the attack.”
more. If they did, maybe James could be convinced to take an actual break. Thinking about their fearless leader, Torrun wondered if he’d eaten anything yet that day. She doubted it—there had been a morning shift and an afternoon shift of fighting, and James had been out for them both. Quietly, while the others spoke, Torrun moved about the kitchen, making up a hearty dinner. She slipped out of the kitchen, unnoticed, as the others argued.
The mansion was still the way that Tony had left it, architecturally, except with one exception—the door to his father’s old workshop now had a complicated lock on the door. Tony knew this from having passed by it on the way to the kitchen and having seen the clear tablet next to the door, much like the ones he had at home in Malibu.
“Well,” she drawled, “Now the Alts have seen Kate partying, us arguing, and you two making fools of yourselves, I think it’s Peter’s turn. I’ll just have to make a big deal out of it if you get second in the science fair, darling.” Laughter filled the room—everyone knew Peter was perfect. James slapped his brother on the back.
The lights blended into one, and then there were no more lights at all.
. They had been staying at the mansion with the Stark Rogers family for seven weeks now, with no real word on when they would be leaving. That didn’t bother Steve as much as it should have. What bothered Steve was that he couldn’t seem to get her out of his head.
. Because you’re
This was somehow a lot less than what Peter had always envisioned and expected. This felt like…well, like high school, all over again, if the teachers cared a bit less. He didn’t know what he had expected exactly. Shiny desks and eager students? Enthusiastic professors? Interesting new material every week? He definitely expected more of what had gone on that morning—great scrimmages and practical training. He knew that was still something they would be getting to—he just hoped it would be better than the classroom. Eventually a bell rang and everyone left before Dr. Pym even dismissed them.
“Well, James and Francis got quite upset with him, I think, but he’ll be ok,” Antonella said, sounding uncomfortable.
“Steve I’m not getting a signal. Oh my God, Steve, there’s no signal. There’s
“Anywhere from five seconds to five weeks to five years to five thousand,” Dr. Richards said with a shrug. “It’s unstable. I don’t have data for anything like this. I can only work in the theoretical.”

“SCATTER!” Clint yelled as the arrows were in mid-flight, everything happening in split seconds. Kate felt like time itself had slowed down as she leapt away from where they were currently standing just as the guns started firing.
“… What kind of bribe?” The Omega asked after a moment, sounding amused and pretty interested.
The Omega muffled a surprised moan, but followed his lead smoothly, intertwining his long fingers through blonde hairs. After a long, innocent yet very affectionate kiss, Tony’s mouth opened for him, and Steve bit down at his bottom lip, harder enough to make him yelp, before sliding inside with his tongue, swallowing the delightful sigh.
Tony’s eyes widened as his own narrowed. It was difficult for both of them letting go of each other. Steve knew how he looked from the Omega’s view: big, powerful,
Peter nodded and curled into his Pops’ big chest, sitting on his laps, just like Tony did more often than not.
“You said Peter,” Steve pointed out.
Wade’s eyes were wide open as he looked up at both of them and nodded, a little pale and intimidate. Good, you should be scared, he thought, fixing his gaze on the kid. Those were his hormones talking, clearly. With those messy, ash blond hair, eyes as clear as the sky and old scratches on both cheeks, Wade was kind of adorable.
“A nightmare?” A sharp nod from Steve, who added, “I needed to make sure you were both safe”.
“Dad, Pops! Are you coming?” Peter’s voice made them groan and growl in disapproval, but Tony didn’t stop leaving a trail of warm kisses up to his jaw, purring louder to keep the Alpha’s focus all for himself.
Tony’s answer was to purr again, knowing how he affected the Alpha. But Steve needed answers and growled back with a bit of a warning. The Omega pouted, so adorably the Alpha had to resist kissing him again.
“I love to hear you ramble, Omega.” Steve offered, starting to gently pet his hair.
, he thought, and he didn’t realize that he was calling Tony’s name again and again, with a more loud voice. He was also shaking him, with his trembling hands - he was all shaking, but he was focused only on the genius.
They left the lab while talking; Tony was leaving a trail of delicate kisses on Steve’s neck and jaw, sometimes rubbing his nose against his skin to scent him. Steve was just gladly enjoying all those sweet attentions and couldn’t wait to reach their floors to reciprocate.
At least, that was what he thought he looked from the outside. If asked to the two Alphas in the room, they would have said that Tony looked like a tiny and pouty ball of frustration, with the cutest fluffy head.
“That’s enough from you two!” Tony snapped, interrupting what he probably thought was a fight, while it was just his two silly Alphas proving their
“Everything’s okay?” Steve asked surprised, already looking down at his belly.
“Good. It doesn’t mean you can’t get anxious, though. You are his father, and… No, that’s not it. You love him”
“I made breakfast before leaving this morning, hoping to eat it with him and settling his doubts, or, or fixing whatever I did wrong when I asked for a bath. He ate before I came back,” and that’s what really made him miserable: after a whole night alone, his Omega still avoided him during the day.
“Stop interrupting me,” the Omega’s growl was intimidating enough: he was trying to make a speech, a serious one. And for once, he wasn’t fishing for compliments. The Alpha just settled with a docile rumble which satisfied Tony enough to continue.
“Again? Hmm, I think Prince Charming woke up Prince Tony too many times this week. Let them sleep peaceful together, tonight I’ll tell you the legend of Tony of Locksley, a heroic outlaw, also known as Iron Hood,” he made a gesture with a hand to make him get out, with an encouraging smile on his lips.
“No Steve, everything’s not okay. And you know it,” He growled, waving both hands in the air. Not a single Alpha in his life had ever stopped him from growling, he wasn’t scared to deal with any kind of person.
“Tony. My Omega. I’ll go hunting in the wild streets of Manhattan for you, but let me hear what’s annoying your wonderful mind first,” he made Tony’s name sounding severe like the look he gave him, clearly not impressed by his attempt to change topic, to shift the attention away of something important, because he decided it wasn’t significant for Steve.
Be a better man.
Steve rested his head on the armrest to roll his eyes up without the Omega seeing him, and rubbed again his fingertips onto his mate’s scalp, stroking his hair fondly. Both of them were letting their hair grow, and Tony’s head was so fluffy and soft the Alpha enjoyed a lot running his fingers through them.
He opened his mouth, but Tony shushed him. “Are you willing to risk adding something else that could put you in more troubles?”
,” The Alpha whispered, and the Omega released a purr at that throaty tone. “My beautiful Omega, I need you.
I’m going to die. He’s going to kill me, and he’s never been so sure of anything in his entire life, as he turned to watch Steve walk away from him. He didn’t have a dangerous heart condition, not anymore, but he pressed a hand to his chest, trying to calm down, and took deep, long breaths, closing his eyes to focus on inhaling and exhaling, to avoid the almost certain heart attack.
His expression hardened, feeling on the verge of an explosion: what the fuck was Steve thinking? Since when he decided to whom Tony was allowed to get close? A growl threatened to leave his throat. Tony never gave him such decisional power on
He tried to focus on the children, while playing with his hands, just to do something. Mary was talking, moving the action figure in the air, and the attention was all on her. Although she was the smallest, and the youngest of the group, she took the charisma after Tony: she made people listen to her, and laugh, and think, and dream, more easily than a kid of her age – and even people of Tony’s age – will ever do.
Alpha, and as Omega all his instincts were irrationally screaming that the Alpha would have done everything if he was submissive enough…
Steve found himself wrapped in the Omega’s arm a few moments later and didn’t wince at all, even if Tony tried to sneak up on him. As if he couldn’t recognize Tony’s scent when he entered the kitchen.
“Well, then keep an eye on them if it bothers you,” Tony said with a shrug. “They seem fine to me.”
“So, this is you proving to me that you’re really responsible?” her mother asked.
This was where family ended up. This was
to tell him, but she knew she didn’t want him to find out from a myriad of positive tests in the trash.
“I need to get you a girlfriend. Seriously, and more friends, then you’ll regain your senses,” Tony said. “I think you’ve been alone too long, Giggles.”
“Peter,” he tried, but Peter wasn’t in the mood for his sage advice, apparently.
Tony brought out the little charm from her hand, gently clipping it onto the rest of the bracelet. She turned it so Kate could see. It was a tiny charm of an arc reactor, little sapphires set inside to provide the blue glow. Kate’s pretty blue eyes were wide as she stared at it for a moment. She met Tony’s eyes, looking so confused with emotions even Tony, who knew her daughter better than Kate guessed she did, could not untangle them.
James was exceedingly grateful for his early Christmas present from Tony—he had no idea how it really worked, and Tony said it was a very early prototype, but it was an armband that could create a holographic shield capable of being just as corporeal as his father’s, just as bullet proof and great for throwing. He used it to take out a couple of enemy troops before managing to grab a gun from one.
get in at school, Dad?” Peter demanded.
“Seriously?” Brandon asked. “Just like that?”
Steve felt sick, and it had nothing to do with any actual illness. He wondered, as the door to the basement gym slammed shut, if he had in him the same personality, the same capability for unintentional cruelty. He was certain that 3490 Steve had his excuses and explanations. He was certain that he had meant well, but all the same here was a boy (and it was strange to Steve, to think that he was only a few years younger than himself when he still seemed such a child) who was hurt and angry and clearly feeling like an outsider in his own family. Good intentions weren’t always enough.
“Don’t look at me like that,” she said. Steve, thoroughly chastened by this simple request, looked away, his face turning red. 3490 Tony looked at the rest of the alts. “Are we done then? Good. I’ll show you to—” Tony was yet again interrupted by 3490 Steve’s appearance.
Tony turned off the holodeck, and the blue lights disappeared. He walked over to the mini kitchen area of the lab, going straight for his coffee maker. He put in new grounds and filled the pitcher up with water. He turned it on, and then turned to Steve.
“Any girls we should know about?” Steve probed gently.
,” Torrun spoke.
“What the hell was it, Tony? Do you know?” Steve asked as the penthouse quickly emptied. Lewis was screaming and crying as his father tried to calm him down, but otherwise everyone seemed fine.
“You look like somebody kicked your dog.”
. I mean really, guys, come on. I could have put James, Azari, Torrun, Kate and Billy out there and it would have been cleaned up in twenty.”
“Wait, wait—you had no idea what I was going on about and you came up here anyway?”
Bucky only nodded and led him away towards a SHIELD vehicle that had arrived. SHIELD—they hadn’t really even discussed it, who was heading it, who was dealing with it—at the moment, everyone was reporting in to Maria Hill. Steve supposed they were going to have to deal with it all without him, now. Bucky put him in the SHIELD vehicle, a standard black SUV driven by some junior SHIELD agent whose name Steve probably knew, because he made it a point to know as many of the agents as he could, but Steve couldn’t recall it just then. Bucky hesitated for a moment, shouted something over his shoulder, and then got into the car beside him. Steve wanted to tell his oldest friend that it wasn’t necessary, but he didn’t have the energy to argue. And hell, what did he know—maybe it was.
“Why not?” Peter asked. Anything to keep him talking, anything to keep him conscious. Peter did not believe in God, but Peter was praying, silently praying with every second that passed.
“So we have no way of knowing yet whether or not both of our universes are going to collapse,” she said. “Brilliant. Did he give us an ETA for that data?” Bruce shook his head. “Just ‘not tomorrow’. It will take twenty-four hours, at least.” Tony pinched the bridge of her nose. Twenty-four hours was a long time to go without knowing whether both of their worlds were on the verge of collapse.

“Leave him alone, Peter, he just got off the ice a year or two ago,” 3490 Tony said. There was a slight note of admonishment in her tone.
“Whatever,” she replied, still obviously stung. “I’m going to find Francis.” She hurried off. Peter looked down at the little girl once more.
“What? How are you not sensing the sexual tension, Teddy? It’s as thick as a fog,” Azari said. Torrun stayed silent, her eyes watching the subjects of their discussion. Steve and Tony of the MCU had been acting weird around each other again, screwing up their team dynamics as usual. They sat in the living room with their own team, watching a movie that had yet to be released in their own universe.
“I’ve got room for one,” Tony said a bit reluctantly.
the same. It was close enough. Peter took in ragged breaths until the heaving ceased, until the coughing stopped, and he could return to his spot slumped against the bathroom tile as fake-dad’s hands fell away. MCU Steve sat beside him. He didn’t speak. He just waited. Peter was familiar with that tactic. Couldn’t say it didn’t work well.
,” Steve said, rolling his eyes. It took the other man a second, but gradually he caught on.
Steve. And suddenly out of the smoke he appeared. Terror was written all over his face—he’d heard her scream and come running. He gathered her up into his arms. His face was beaten and bloody, and he’d clearly been injured. The shield on his arm was dripping blood not his own. But he was ok. He was safe. He was alive.
“I shall also join you on this venture,” Thor agreed. But this time, Steve shook his head.
“So?” 3490 Steve asked.
“I’ve gotten some sleep,” James said insistently, but he knew his sister knew he was lying. She just raised an eyebrow. James’ expression crumpled under her skepticism, and he knew it. He was too hungry and tired and upset to be strong. He sighed and offered her the bowl once more, pleading with her. “Please, Katie.” He didn’t know what he did right. Maybe it was his tone of voice. Maybe it was his expression of utter despair. Either way, Kate took the bowl and the roll he offered. James wandered over to his brother.
“Oh, no, Tony,
“Was the cube blue?” Tony asked, feeling like a doctor making a diagnosis.

hadn’t really benefited from being favored at Avengers Academy. He had less training time when it came to SHIELD, but that was because Avengers Academy was itself a SHIELD sanctioned training program. Any of the other kids would get the same treatment—and a couple had. His biggest perk of being the kid of an Avenger was getting into the Academy at all; Francis didn’t have any powers. He shouldn’t have been there. He knew that. But he and James had always trained together. It seemed ridiculous that he couldn’t go when they had always ‘gone to Avengers Academy’ anyway. But it had set an awful precedent, and now the whole school was in the mess it was.

“I know,” Natasha replied. There was grief on her face too.
“I don’t expect you to say anything,” she said. “You’re just here. Convenient ears. All the more convenient that they’re almost just my own.” Antonella took a long drink of her sparkling grape juice as Tony tried to gather his thoughts, which seemed to have scattered to the wind.
, Tony. We should hold onto that.”
“Ah,” James gasped just as he right himself and promptly fell backwards again, his eyes rolling back. Luckily Peter was there to catch him.
at a party full of university boys,” 3490 Tony said, obviously enraged.
“Computers are doing their thing,” Dr. Banner,
angry. Guess who has been grounded from Halloween parties? I figured Mom would let up for the holiday but—nope.”
But he knew she would, knew she had to. Her gaze, which had fixed on the floor, flicked up slowly to meet her husband’s eyes.

. It reminded Steve of the days before Thor and Jane moved out, before the slow trickle of Avengers left the mansion, and the mansion stopped being ‘Avengers Mansion’ and started just being his and Tony’s home. “Wish our Capsicle here’d wear it more often. Might dislodge that stick in his ass.”
“What?” Francis asked, bewildered. “What is it?”
“Just say it,” Natasha said. Coulson nodded.

“Tony how old are we?” he asked.
Of course, there were reasons why the test might be wrong, Tony reasoned. She was a scientist, after all. False positives could happen, even multiple times in a row, if certain conditions were met. They were only testing for elevated levels of the hCG hormone in the system. Certain rare diseases could cause those same elevated levels, though Tony was fairly certain that Extremis had wiped out any chance of her getting a disease. She could have choriocarcinoma, potentially. And Tony, in that moment, staring down at the seventh little plus sign, could not decide which would be worse if she had cancer again or if she were pregnant again.
“I knew I would be,” Natasha admitted. “They had security measures we don’t. I wasn’t really trying to be subtle anyway, they had to expect this at some point if Rogers is half the tactician he seems to be.”
Tony. He didn’t always come to a wholly favorable opinion of the man. Yet here he was, having complicated feelings for a woman who was only just a little different from the man he knew. It was exceedingly confusing.
“You mean to tell me that it’s 2013 and you’ve only been a group for barely a year? And not even a cohesive unit?” Tony asked. One look at their faces told her it was true. They were all blank, unconcerned. They didn’t understand what being Avengers

“Don’t you sass me, soldier,” he said. “The limo is out front. I’m giving Special Agent Romanov the day shift, so get ready for the graveyard shift. Your assignment starts now.” Steve recognized the dismissal and nodded curtly to the Director of the United States Secret Service. He left the office, heading out front to the limo that would take him to wherever Senator Stark was.
do? James hurried his steps and opened the VIP door.
“How long have you been off the ice?” she asked. He looked surprised to be addressed about this topic. He shrugged.
“No it’s—we were in the hallway, it’s our fault,” Francis said, dismissing his explanation.
, which is to be expected given his background. And he’s not as innocent and apple pie as he looks either.” Antonella threw in a smirk with that last comment. Tony just raised an eyebrow.
Steve was
“Well, I was pretty…not mean, but let’s say petty…with Steve at first,” Tony replied. “But eventually I took pity on him. He was living in this house, alone except for my parents—I was at MIT still—and he just…he was lonely. It was sad. I knew what it was to feel alone in this house. So I dragged him out to some parties. Introduced him to Rhodey so he’d have somebody in the military to talk to. Somewhere along the lines we became friends. He helped me through some tough shit. He got married, then divorced, and, well, after a near-death experience we both kind of realized that we’d been stupid for seven years. I had Peter and Kate in 2000, and we got married six years later.” Tony touched her tablet, moving to her pictures. She found the wedding quickly and handed it to Other Steve.
Tony agreed, getting up from his chair as well. He looked drained. He looked freaked out. Steve put a hand on his shoulder.
A cluster of students stood in a circle with hardly any gaps, all chanting one phrase over and over again:
“Working on it!” James hissed back. The Hulk roared as they giant it fought froze his arm in ice.
“If I’ve overstepped my bounds, ma’am, I’m very sorry—” Steve started, feeling humiliation sink in his stomach. She knew. She

“You should probably know that there’s someone waiting on the other side of the door so they can’t be seen right now,” Natasha said suddenly. Tony didn’t know how she managed that. He could swear that to have her spy abilities she had to have a sixth sense.
Chapters 7-9: Thursday, October 20, 2016
His mother was dead. The universe was probably collapsing. And he’d just killed a man. A bad man, sure, but a man. He felt his gut twisting.
“Steve?”
“Unfortunately. Battle stations everyone, this is not a drill! Arms locked and ready on the central console. Do not engage until given the order,” she called out. She saw a few puzzled glances, but no one ever disobeyed her outright. She looked at her watch. It would probably be only sixty seconds or so now. She could hear sounds of guns loading, of agents getting ready to engage with thin air at her order. Tony could never decide whether that power was awesome or terrifying. Steve would say both. Tony tended to agree. She was halfway done with her coffee now. She’d have to have Mary make her another cup. Scratch that, she’d need a full thermos. She wished she could make it Irish. There were thirty seconds left, tops. Tony could feel the tension in the room, and yet another odd feeling—confusion, probably. They didn’t understand. Yet.
“But you’re kicking us out,” Tony stated more than asked. 3490 Tony shrugged.
The bunker was quiet. The kids were all in bed. The Avengers of Steve’s earth were all too exhausted to converse. Steve showered quickly, getting all the blood and dirt off of himself. He didn’t have a change of clothes, but all the SHIELD bunkers kept a few extra things in the linen closet, so he’d grabbed a fresh pair of sweats and a t-shirt. They were a bit small, but at least they weren’t covered in filth. He checked into one of the rooms in the bunker, peeking in to see his sleeping children. Well, Peter and Kate anyway; Steve didn’t know where James was, but he doubted his oldest boy was sleeping. Steve could hear the Avengers of 199999 speaking quietly in the kitchen, deliberating over the information Steve had dumped on them. There had probably been a better way to divulge that information, a more tactful way, but Steve was all out of tact. Steve was all out of energy. Steve was all out of everything. He was hollow.
“Just
“Not just that. You should be older. You’re nearly my age, and I was born in 1970. I met the Captain in 1990, when he came off ice. A few years later, there were reports of a gamma radiation accident—the same that created the Hulk. And in ’96 I made the suit to escape capture in Iraq. That was the same year Thor showed up and we made the Avengers,” Tony said. She could still see that cave, still hear Yinsen’s voice.
be with the news, anyway. Tony had to say, she was getting quite used to having them at the dinner table. It was entertaining, to have herself to speak with. Even if he was very different, Tony found that Other Tony had many of her same speech patterns, and she enjoyed exchanging insults and challenges with the man, all delivered via pop culture references that grew increasingly obscure as the dinners wore on.
“Oh, no,” Kate said. “Secret identities are created for a reason. Can’t have friends over, that would be a national security risk—there’s way too much sensitive info stored in this house. We’ve had parties before, though—Mom just always rents out a place; ball rooms, laser tag, under 21 club, Chuck-E-Cheese, whatever.”
“Wow, I am so sorry for your tragedy, Kate. It’s absolutely terrible that you snuck out of the house and got completely fucking trashed and now have to suffer actual
“No. Bucky’s not a beautiful flower, he’s a stubborn ass like you,” 3490 Tony said, a smile playing on her lips. “I’m much more partial to Camellias than Bucky Barnes. No, this is the part where I tell you maybe you should be sketching the beautiful flowers instead of ghosts.” Steve looked down at his sketchbook. He felt
“Well, you could always avoid it all together and stay here,” 3490 Tony chimed in, making her way to them with a tablet still in hand. “Pepper is always saying how she wishes she could clone herself. I’ve offered to make her a life model decoy but she never takes me up on it. Says she doesn’t find the suggestion very funny. Can’t imagine why. Anyway, you’re all set. All of you. All of you are all set.”
toys. It was
“Well that’s not suspicious,” Hill said, raising an eyebrow. “Are we sure they didn’t plant it for you to find?”
They couldn’t decide on a new game of cards to play. They’d already run through poker and blackjack, had burned through Kemps and Euchre. Bruce had dryly suggested Go Fish, but no one wanted to put themselves through voluntary torture. They weren’t at that point just yet. So they were sitting in silence, trying to think of a new game to play, when Clint spoke up.
For a minute they sat in silence, before Steve became hyper aware of his cold, bare chest. He grabbed his own shirt and started to put it back on. Tony was still lost in thought, so Steve grabbed Tony’s pants and held them out to him. Tony looked up at him, startled.
could do, their parents with a team so large that full group pictures rarely showed everyone’s faces.
“That’s correct,” he said.
“Didn’t she say he was incompetent?” MCU Clint asked.
“Why?” Tony asked, puzzled. Steve raised an eyebrow.
“So you made Peter’s room into his tech haven,” Kate recalled.
“Are you making up nicknames for your security detail? Tony, not everyone finds that endearing,” Pepper chastised him. Senator Stark just waved her off.
“And why
“I love you three more than anything,” he said quietly. “I’m sorry I can’t be more for you, can’t be different for you. I’m sorry.”
them to say something; 3490 Steve looked grateful for her devious intervention). 3490 Tony made a note to J.A.R.V.I.S. to buy double of all breakfast items for the foreseeable future to avoid disasters. Tony personally, and his counterpart 3490 Tony, was content with just drinking coffee for breakfast. 3490 Tony, however, had 3490 Steve putting a plate in front of her and stubbornly adding eggs and an English muffin to it. Pepper, on the other hand, had long since given up trying to introduce Tony to healthy eating habits and left him with his coffee in peace.
“It’s not—”
“Not so much considering JARVIS is tracking my every move—“
After a shower and some food, Steve headed to the conference room for a debrief with Fury. He found Tony as he was headed down there, and he couldn’t help but frown at the other man a bit. He was always taking unnecessary risks and not following orders and
that you’re older,” Kate insisted, moving her arms once again to pull him closer. Francis looked increasingly uncomfortable.
“Tony, what’s going on?” Steve demanded. Her fellow Avengers, surrounded by their children and families, looked at her expectantly.
“Hey, Tony, I was hoping I could talk to you and Steve tonight,” Other Steve appeared in the hall, and Tony could not have been more grateful for his presence. He would be a perfect distraction.
“Then I want to keep an eye on them. A close one. And separate the head from the shoulders so to speak—Fury, Hill, and Coulson will stay at the Triskelion. I’ll take the others home,” Tony said as the opening sequence to a new episode rolled. Bruce looked surprised.
“I’d say this is pretty Hallmark of you, but frankly, it is a bit stalkerish. Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t just turn you over to the feds,” Tony drawled. It didn’t matter that just seeing the man made his chest ache with a long repressed hope. No, he knew Rogers only wanted something if he was willing to take the risk to return to New York.
“I needed you, Rogers. Not to blindly sign the Accords, because I know that’s not who you are. I needed you to
. He missed Thor belting out the latest Midgardian Christmas song he’d heard throughout the tower. He missed Clint hanging up the garland by imbedding them in the wall with arrows. He missed Bruce’s careful concentration as he decorated cookies. He missed Natasha’s soft humming as she skillfully wrapped presents. He missed Ste—
Rogers blinked in surprise. “Wait, what?”
Rogers’ face was so grief stricken that Tony almost felt bad, but it had to be said out loud. “I do trust you, Tony,” he whispered.
“Merry Christmas, Steve.”
“I didn’t know...” Rogers said quietly. “I’m sorry, Tony. I’m sorry I didn’t listen. I’m sorry about keeping the truth about your parents away from you. I was a coward. At first I thought I was doing it because I was sparing you the pain, but I realized I was doing it to spare myself. You were happy, even after the whole New York debacle. We were getting along, and I didn’t want to ruin the new friendship that we’d had. And I meant to tell you at some point, to find an opening for the conversation, but then Ultron happened and then the Accords...” He trailed off for a moment.
He took a steadying breath before continuing. “I’ll admit, I didn’t listen to you as much as I could have with the Accords. Sokovia was still a recent mess, and Ross was going after the Avengers, and there was no accountability for the fallout. The Accords were to prevent something worse from happening to the Avengers.”
“I missed you, Tony.”
With a shake of his head, he cleared away the spot of fogged up glass. His shoulders went rigid as he caught a sign of movement in the window’s reflection. Beating down the mounting panic in his chest, he subtly reached a hand towards his gauntlet watch as he turned around.
anyways?”
But that was a recurring theme for the both of them, wasn’t it? They were always too far away from each other. Maybe that was why they never understood each other, why they were absolute shit at communicating, even at their best.
It’s moments like this where he desperately missed Jarvis and his gentle aura, his guidance, his sturdy support. He missed JARVIS and his calm presence at the tower and in the suits. He missed his mother and her soft singing as she played the piano. He missed the few years the team had been together as a unit—as a
?” He stormed forward until there was a foot of space between him and Rogers.
“Here to tell me about how you and the other jolly Avengers are having a grand old time in Wakanda? Need something to help your bestest friend Barnes? Or are you just here to rub it in that I’m a miserable fuck even though it’s the holiday season?” Tony shot, rage gradually building up. “Are you going to tell me I’m wrong again? Argue about the
. But you couldn’t even give me that,” Tony said, blinking rapidly to clear the moisture in his eyes. “We were supposed to be a team! And look at us now: Bruce is gone, Thor’s off in space, and you’ve taken the rest of the kids after the divorce. Hell of a team if you ask me.”
“I wanted to see you,” Rogers replied softly. His normally confident shoulders were dropped, hunching in on himself as if to appear smaller. “I wanted to apologize.”
“Oh, uh, we were in the states for a mission. Sam went home to his ma and I meant to stop by the tower. I just...wanted to see you. To apologize.” Maybe it was a trick of the light, but Tony could’ve sworn there was a blush on his face that wasn’t from the cold.
Tony stared at him for a bit, scrutinizing him to see if he could find a trace of dishonesty, but nothing came up. Rogers’ determined look radiated nothing but sincerity.
“We had three days to read it over,” Rogers pointed out, eyebrows furrowed in frustration. “I couldn’t just sign something I didn’t agree with completely. Ross was clearly trying to take us down. It was a bar for the Avengers. We would’ve had no choice in our missions. They wanted to control us like some government lapdog!”
“You could’ve talked to me! We were supposed to be a team!” Tony stressed. “You’re a damn hypocrite for calling me out on Ultron. Didn’t you think I deserved the right to know about my own parents’ fucking
“Why couldn’t you trust me?” It came out more softly than he’d intended to, but his emotions were already going haywire as is.
my friend. I’m sorry it seemed that way.”
, he thought to himself with a wry twist of his lips. Jarvis used to take him on walks through New York on Christmas Eve when his parents were too busy hosting their annual Christmas Gala. None of the shops had captured his attention as much as this toy store, the delicately carved soldiers and animals never failing to impress even his young, genius mind. Jarvis had never seen his fascination for them as a childish thing. The year before Tony left for boarding school, Jarvis had even gifted him a beautifully crafted nutcracker. He’d treasured it, but Howard had destroyed it during one of his drunken rages, roaring about him wasting his time with useless junk and interests. They didn’t go on any more of those walks after that.
Tony hadn’t initially intended to go out in the dead of night, but the tower was too empty. Of all the shitty Christmases he’d had, this year was taking the fucking cake. Pepper was going to fly in from California, but trouble with some board members had dragged her off once again. Peter was spending Christmas with his Aunt. Rhodey and Vision were still at the compound, which Tony couldn’t bring himself to return to after the events of their Civil War last year. Buying back the Stark-turned-Avengers-turned-Stark-again tower and moving in didn’t lessen the pain either. There were too many memories of the team, but he’d rather stew around in his loneliness there than at the compound. And of course, most of said team had fucked off, leaving him to deal with the collateral damage.
“Siberia, Bucky, the whole Accords mess.” He shoved his hands into his pockets, but held firm. “I want you to know I really am sorry. For everything. I know the letter didn’t even cover the half of it, and I shouldn’t have acted so blindly about it. It was just...Bucky was the last thing I’d had in connection to the past. I couldn’t lose him again, Tony, you have to understand that. But I didn’t mean for it to go down the way it did.”
Right, of course Nat knows what happened better than Steve, even though Steve was actually there. He should have asked her in the first place.
You left those kids in there with that thing?

::winking face::
It’s really messed up
“Everyone in Timely, come on out!” Rogers shouts. “We can take back our government right now! For too long, we've looked away as Roxxon, Fisk, and his assassins have forced us to live in terror! Come out of your houses! Come and demand to live free! Come out and say ‘no’ to the land-grabbing, come out and say ‘enough’ to the water-stealing!”
“Whaddya think, Apple?” he asks, absent-mindedly petting her haunch.
Steve looks at him thoughtfully. “Nah, I don’t see it. I don’t think Lord Byron knew the first thing about engineering.”
The three strange men keep popping up around town. Steve’s seen them more than once in each of the town's saloons, playing their cards and dice, and three times again at the hotel. He’s caught them going in or out of Fisk’s casino twice that over again.
“Don’t do that to me again.” Steve’s voice rumbles over Tony’s lips. His fingers drag down Tony’s cheek, along his jaw. His other arm wraps around Tony’s waist.
In the morning, Steve pulls the curtains open to a clear sky and several feet of fresh, powdery snow on the ground.
“Did I ever tell you that you didn’t need to leave in the first place?”
“Thanks.” Steve didn't know that, or not in so many words. It makes a kind of sense. His decision to ask Tony had been less about bravery and strategy and more about embarrassing levels of loneliness and sexual desperation, but there’s no need to tell Sam that.
to see you? That I give a fuck whether you literally die in a fire? Shows what I know. My mistake, so if you’ll excuse me, I believe I was trying to make my exit—”
In the morning, Tony’s head is nearly clear. He tugs Steve to the edge of the bed and then sinks to his knees and takes Steve in his mouth. Steve holds Tony by the back of the neck. Tony’s not sure what makes it feel possessive. And hasn’t he always wanted to belong to Steve?
The lyrics I’ve included of “Poor Wayfaring Stranger” are adapted from several different recorded versions. In the folk tradition, I’ve rearranged some lines and changed some bits here and there. I’ve mostly pulled from
“Don't mock me, Stark!” Steve snaps over his shoulder. “I'm trying to save lives.”
“It’s just—I know you love your work at the garage. But you could do
. Communication between two people is like a big afghan blanket that was hand-crocheted by your friend’s elderly mother: it can be a little lopsided, with one side more complete or open or duplicitous than the other; it can have uneven spots of broken trust, skipped stitches of missed opportunities, loose tails of yarn of things unsaid, and maybe the flowers don’t look all the same, because people change, and relationships change; but it can also have sections where the design and pattern are in perfect harmony, like a pair of lovesick idiots finishing each other’s sentences; it can have a whole row that had to be taken out and redone, like conversations that start out wrong and need to be paused and started over from the beginning; and it can, overall, be just the right thing to wrap around your shoulders on a chilly spring evening.
Steve sits up straighter in his chair, shaking his head a little. He doesn't reply.
Of course, she couldn’t be completely sure that that is where the lie lay. But, along with revising the list of who she holds dear, Natasha had decided some time ago that, as far as her teammates were concerned, she would take everything they said at face value unless objective facts contradicted it.
Rogers is there in the twinkling of a bed-post and he knocks Turk down with one slog, which is quite a sight. “Where are—”
Steve catches him and guides him into the entry hall. “Let’s get some real food in you,” Steve says, stomping melted snow off his boots and locking the door behind them.
Steve chuckles. “Oh, well, if it’s gold foil, then—”
The second thing Tony tries to do is impossible.
Tony opens the book.
“Success” was here thought to have been achieved because it was believed that—even though the Asgardian sorceress who had been turning stoplights into unicorns and pigeons into barrels of flour all morning near Houston St. disappeared before she could be apprehended or interrogated—no civilians and no members of the team had been grievously injured or killed.
“And I’m supposed to believe you’re in the habit of just giving people what they want?”
After his monthly medical check-up, Steve asked where Dr. Suresh—his usual physician—had gone.
for real real?
“What job?” Tony asks, perching on a stool across from where Steve’s dicing onions for their dinner.
If there is such a spell, though, Tony doesn’t know it, so he skedaddles right on out of there instead.
She’s small, with delicate bones, and her head hits the window beside her a good six inches lower than that of the man behind her. Her eyes flick between the puddle and the LED sign announcing the next stops. Occasionally, her eyes drift shut and her shoulders begin to relax, only for her to jerk upright again.
. I’m probably making up half of what I promised you on licensed Iron Man and Captain America action figure sales alone. Think of it as a bonus for a job well done.”
Tony pulls out the second he finishes and replaces his cock with a plug. He doesn’t bother with lube, just slams it past any resistance and walks away. Steve can't turn his head far enough to see him, can't call out to him through the gag. With the senses left to him, he tastes the leather and metal of the bit in his mouth and hears a shower running in a nearby room. Tony doesn’t return after the water stops.
, Steve tells it. Still, the hiss lingers, making promises and spinning tales.
His eyes slide away from Steve’s, landing on the wall behind Steve’s bed. He tilts his head so his sunglasses catch the light and the rosy glass turns to a glare of impenetrable white. He uncrosses his legs, crosses them the opposite direction, wriggles his hips, crosses his legs back the way they were. “Hey Pep, y’know what, my lunch date is here, can I call you back in a couple hours? Okay, four and three-quarters hours, how’s that? Yeah. Yeah. You too. I will. Bye.”
Steve grins. “Yeah Tony,” he says, watching Tony smile back. “You did great.”
“You’re the one who put me in charge,” Tony says groggily, burrowing his face into Steve’s shoulder. “Having second thoughts?”
Tony opens Pepper’s next: a silk necktie with a matching pocket square.
James looked at her with heavy-lidded eyes, his eyes frightened and impossibly blue. Natasha wondered if those eyes were lying to her. “Is that me?” he asked.
“Thank you for telling me.”
Destroy all Escalation tiles if there are at least 6 Cap Escalation Tiles. Generate 2 Red AP, 2 Yellow AP, and 1 Green AP per tile destroyed and 1 Purple AP for every 2 tiles destroyed.
“That’s exactly how they’re supposed to work.”
Steve wouldn’t go quite that far, but Sam’s probably right. Maybe Steve can come up with a plan that doesn’t involve sex toy manufacturing or imposing on Tony’s generosity.
unacceptable pun count: 3
“Jealous?” Tony whispers, pinning Steve’s wrists above his head. He nuzzles Steve’s shoulder, then bites it. He grinds his teeth against Steve’s skin until he draws blood. “You know what you mean to me, Steve.”
Tony scowled up at him from his hospital bed. “It’s just a stupid spell.”
Carol comes by, carrying a cardboard case of six slender glass bottles with artful labels and old-fashioned script. Steve recognizes it as a luxury brand of sparkling water that Tony liked. After a brief discussion of Avengers business—ostensibly the reason for her visit—she pops a cap off one of the bottles and offers it to him. “Hey. Wanna not get drunk with me?”
What? No, we’re just walking through some big shelves.
since I can’t communicate with any ants back home though I guess it doesn’t really help
He thinks he sees Stark’s eyes land on the ‘64 Stark Rifle hanging above the bar before he takes another swig.
Steve finally takes the flask from Tony’s hand. “It ain’t from this river, is it?”
Right???
So what does he mean?
As common ground goes, it’s pretty fucking precarious.
yeah evil robots having free rein of a planet-sized library’s worth of resources seems like pretty bad news
Steve pulls out before he climaxes to splash Tony’s face with his come, then bend down and lick it off. “You’re a mess,” he remarks as he laps at Tony’s skin.
“Now you’re getting it. All the details are right here.” She taps the file folder on the table between them. “When not in the field, your movements are confined to the Helicarrier, or other SHIELD facilities on a case-by-case basis. You can be Captain America, but you can’t be on any superhero teams. Ms. Marvel will lead the SHIELD-sanctioned Avengers. That’s the gist.”
right i’ll be quick
“You don’t just think registration is wrong. You think it’s—authoritarian, an invasion of privacy. That I’m chasing power, or control, or I don’t know what, but you think going after our friends meant nothing to me, that I want to lock them up.”
“Bad dream?” Steve asks, setting Tony’s mug on the nightstand. It’s Tony’s favorite, the yellow one with the black cat.
“You know other celebrities have PR people to help them with this stuff, maybe even write answers?”
"I'm alright."
Today Tony tastes like whiskey and a woman’s genitals. When he finishes fucking Steve’s face, his come tastes sweet, like he’s been eating nothing but fruit.
Tony forces his face into blankness and turns to meet Steve's gaze. "Can you tell me why the—was I injured?"
“Like what?”
let me rest
It’s huge. There are windows that are two storeys high, looking out on stars dotting a black sky like captured fireflies. It’s beautiful, too, the breadth of it wrought in sweeping Art Nouveau curves. Even the hum of the ship’s engines is pleasant, a low thrum like the lapping of ocean waves. Panels, sconces, moldings, and what Steve first takes for framed paintings and photographs turn out to be fixtures, screens, and projectors for computer interfaces, appliances, and holograms. It’s overwhelming in its scale, intimidating in its beauty,  and uncanny in its almost-familiarity.
“You asking me or telling me?”
“Oh, do you have an early morning tomorrow?”
Steve lifts his eyes back to Tony’s face and finds Tony gazing back at him, wearing the same expression of weariness and resignation that he feels on his own face.
, Tony tells it.
Steve's trying, Tony tells himself. That's all that this stilted conversation means: Steve doesn't know what to say either, or how to go on, but he's here and he's trying. "The painkillers haven't worn off yet," Tony says. It reminds him of how thirsty he is. There's a fresh glass on the end table, condensation still forming on its surface. He reaches for it and takes a strip through the swirly straw. It's something Steve would've brought him back in the early days, when Iron Man had a secret identity and could only eat and drink through the slit in the faceplate.
that doesn’t bode well
like away from the node that links it to THIS weirdness
“I’m sure I will.”
“Son of a bitch!” Tony winces. Then he rallies. “No, no, wait—this is good. This is good.”
Something in Steve’s face closes off. Tony admonishes himself for the surge of hurt he feels seeing it. It’s better to get this over with now.
The magical blast was the color of plum blossoms, smelled strangely akin to carnival hot dogs, and was accompanied by a sound like a huge sheet of ice on a frozen lake cracking because you have taken a step too far and are about to plunge into icy water.
There is an idiom in the English language that goes: “don’t bring a knife to a gunfight.” It means: “be prepared and bring the appropriate equipment and expectations to a given situation.” However, it is also worth mentioning that even during a knife fight, it’s important to bring not only a knife, but the right kind of knife. A butter knife or artistic reproduction of an antique hunting knife or a knife made of jell-o would be just as inadvisable in a knife fight as a knife in a gunfight.
“Me neither,” Tony murmurs.
“It’s Tony. Do you know Steve’s favorite flowers—”
—there’s a use for Captain America. Out here, where everyone’s needs are easily met, where all of the planets and species of the galaxy are at peace or working toward it, where the only ships being sent out are research and exploration vessels, where superhumans are accepted and celebrated, there’s no need for Captain America at all.
Urich looks up sharply at that. “Not at all. I get money and directions in the mail.”
“We have a lot to talk about,” Steve says, slow, jerky, unsure of his ground. He pushes himself up by his elbows and scrubs at his face. “Have you talked to Pepper? Carol and Rhodey?” Steve should call Maria, too, and the Avengers. Reed will want to hear from Tony. Tony will probably need to talk to his lawyers, too. “I can call—”
If we could find our way back to the Archives, we could then get out of range of the node and it would probably snap us and the building back into place
“I hate that we’re in this pattern of mutually assured destruction—you escalate. I escalate.” Tony had been sure, scant minutes ago, that he’d finally hit Steve’s limit. That Steve came here to shut Tony down—armor, body, heartbeat, mind. But he says he believes in Tony. Maybe Tony doesn’t have to be a disappointment.
okay good talk
If Iron Man takes more than 2250 damage in a single hit, create a Team Iron Man Escalation tile. If the damage is dealt by a member of Team Cap, the threshold to create a tile drops to 1810. If the damage is dealt by Captain America himself, the threshold drops to 1660.
He gives no sign of seeing Steve as he steps closer. It’s like walking into a windstorm, tousling his hair and clothes and swirling into an almost solid barrier around Tony’s body. Almost.

The humanoid ones are cyborgs
The light in Steve’s eyes is golden sunlight. “Seems fair. You spent all that time staying at mine.”
Tony would swear he can hear Spencer shaking his head. “This wasn’t the plan, Stark.”
in the meantime, have you asked Nico for help?

with you?”
The time before that, though—the image is seared into Steve’s memory. Tony’s armor, sparking and scratched, disabled on Steve’s orders. Steve told Tony that he’d lost when he sold his principles, but it was Steve who lost when he’d cracked open Tony’s faceplate with his shield.
Tony doesn’t know where this faith in him has come from, amidst all this, but it doesn’t matter. “I would’ve if I’d been drunk.”
Got it. Me and the squirrels’ll be there in 5
Steve, who was attending out of a desire to get to know Tony better, said, “Just being a supportive teammate.”
Tony thinks the last question has mentally prepared him for the line she’s on, but he’s still shocked—just for a second—when she asks, “Are you out as bisexual?”
Ten minutes later, the intruder is still out like a light. The results on Steve’s screen haven’t changed since he first conducted the scans.

so we're safe for now
“Steve—”
“I liked the message of that glittery one Happy took away from that woman in the front. Though I’d prefer if it were me you were doing it to.”
“How long since you first came down here?”
The next day, not a single one of the reports Steve receives mentions Bucky. Maria’s refers to him as an “unidentified combatant.”
“Uh, no. And. She’s with someone else now,” Tony answers, hoping that details aren’t required.
oh, sweetie
“You ain’t the town spooney,” Steve says sharply.
“Yes.”
“Exactly like that. Oh, Tony, you too?”
that’s so great :) :) :) :)
Hey Bucky. How was fighting that librarian?
The thing is: that’s not all he’s hiding. Tony can tell. Steve’s better at lying than Tony remembers him ever being, but Tony knows his tells. And Tony, thanks to Steve, has nothing to do but sit, and wait; lie down, and think about Steve, pace around Steve’s room, and wait. For Steve.
“I’m here, aren’t I?”
going to be even
not actual physics
“Yeah?” Steve shifts minutely closer, barely a step forward. He doesn’t touch Tony, doesn’t quite crowd him, but it’s still too intimate. It’s not the way you stand across from someone you can’t trust. It’s not the way you face someone who’s wronged you. “Because, I was. Thinking of us.” Abruptly, he adds, “You don’t remember.”
Level 170: 8365
“We’re in, we’re in!” Parker insists.
There are different kinds of lies.
After one ring comes a muffled, “Hello?”
When Tony knocks on the door of the man’s hotel room, though, it swings open, unlatched, and rather than Tillard, a toff in all white is ransacking a chest of drawers. Tony doesn’t need a second look at the swell’s shiny albino gator boots to know he’s one of the fellas Steve had told him to keep an eye on.
The hand lifts, buries itself in Tony’s hair. Full contact. Immersion. Tony leans into it, wondering when he closed his eyes. Tears eke out of the creases. What if he could earn Steve back, for real, in small pieces just like this one?
“Not at all,” the mayor says, her smile widening. “Why do you ask?”
that he doesn’t trust that Steve just wants to be there for him?
“There will be,” Hardison assures him.
. That’s how Steve’s always thought of it. Maybe it was getting his start in a singing and dancing show.
“Don’t you dare—”
Four: it’s an invasion.
Steve has no fucking clue. He doesn’t know how to be with Tony like this—or maybe at all. “I want to stop—reacting in anger.” It’s inadequate but it’s all he has right now. “It’s just that no one else gets under my skin like you. It’s so easy to be furious with you.”
“Tony,” the person sighs, and though their voice is too low to be recognizable, Tony knows with utter certainty that it’s Steve.
“Y’know what’s sad? That’s actually perfect. Dude’s so desperate to be considered useful, he’ll thank you for the chance to do something he knows you want.”
“And the other scene we caused?” Tony asks—though, judging by the email he just got from the Avengers’ marketing team, it’s probably pretty good. Unless, of course, people are buying the merch to burn it.
Destroy all Escalation tiles if there are at least 5 Cap Escalation Tiles. Generate 1 Red AP per tile destroyed and 1 Yellow AP for every 2 tiles destroyed.
Jen chuckles. “You were not found guilty of either of those charges, Captain.”
Across the room, Tony rearranges himself in his seat again. Steve thinks he can hear the wood frame of the chair creak all the way from where he’s sitting. He wonders what subject Tony’s trying to study that has him so restless and frustrated, and why he’s here at all instead of getting help from JARVIS.
Too real, Steve thinks but doesn’t say out loud. Of course it has. Where does that leave him now? And that word.
Steve’s
that was 2!!!
Other times, it leaves us wondering: which part, exactly, is the lie? What information does this lie give us about this person, their motivations, and their true intentions?
Steve ducks his head. His jaw works. He always says what he sets out to say, no matter what it costs him. “No. I wish I hadn’t said that in front of everyone.”
tiled?
“You’re saying you trust me to decide whether you live or die. Whether you
Steve kicks a rock ahead of him. He watches it skitter over the dirt and scrub. “He was—really kind.” He looks straight ahead, and okay, maybe his face is a little pinched, in places. “He could tell I was self-conscious and was trying to make me more comfortable.”
“And who’d want a cursed thing like what you're tellin’ me about?”
and why did he say it in the groupchat
“Well, you didn’t have to cancel Star Trek night in person,” Tony says, shifting from one foot to the other. “I know you know how to use a phone now, old man.”

Steve drops his arms and takes a step back, pushing the table with him. It takes a floorboard with it.
Steve’s men take Tony to a concrete cell that reeks of ammonia. Four of them stay behind. One has a cane. Another has a leather case that he opens, showing off what’s inside—sharp, blunt, hooked, shiny, dull. It’s meant to intimidate him. It works.
“I came straight to you,” Tony says, then winces, like he didn’t mean to.
“Not like this. I’ll stop coming here.”
I mean okay wait but
“Trust each other anyway. Tell each other the truth about what’s going on, so we can take care of ourselves as well as each other.”
He looks at the dead-blow hammer in his hand, at the whiskey climbing down hand and hammer both.
Steve cups Tony’s cheek and kisses him so sweetly that Tony believes, for the length of time Steve’s mouth is pressed against his, that Steve isn’t angry with him at all.
“Here.” Steve takes the lid off a saucepan, takes a scoop with a slotted spoon, and holds it to Tony’s face. “Taste this.”
“I’ll consider it,” Hardison replies, but it sounds like he’s smiling.
awww did steve step in front of you to shield you with his body and shield?
“I feel like I’m all that’s keeping you in Pleasant Hill.”
“What?”
Steve’s voice sounds like someone forgot to grease the wagon at the best of times, but he sings anyway.
Level 170: 10570
Steve looks at Tony with questioning eyes.
“Haven’t yet had the pleasure of meeting him,” Tony replies, winsome as he can, holding the man’s gaze with his own. “Do you know when he’ll be in?”
Then Sam catches him off guard by saying, “You look good, though.”
“I want to go home,” Steve says.
Tony can never say no to Steve. He freezes.
“Tony, look.”
nothing trying to kill you?
“What happened?” Red Wolf asks when he and the others arrive. His face when his eyes land on Steve is nearly comical. “Rogers?” He shakes his head. “Wong said, but I thought maybe he’d been putting the wrong kind of plants in his pipe.”
“That’s great,” Tony says, a little too heartily. “Great. What I wanted to say was, I think I know how you’re feeling.”
As usual, Steve has to take a moment to catch up. He frowns, blinking dumbly. Tony wants him to—convince him that he cares? That he’s sorry? That he doesn’t want Tony to go? Tony will still have to leave. It’s not like he can stay here indefinitely.
so we told him when we came from and also were like “what teleporter” and “who are you”
Steve steps up to them. “Evenin’.” He nods at Stark, then turns to the stranger. “Anythin’ I can help you with? Mister….”
“I’m glad you’re here,” Steve says quickly.
let’s pretend we don’t know that and move on!
then we make like pietro and run
“Not refusin’, just takin’ a step back, is all.”
"I promise," Tony says. It doesn't matter how desperate he sounds as long as Steve believes him. "Please. I won't fight you again, I can't. I can't. Even if you say no, even if you don't touch me or speak to me again, I promise."
“No, no, it’s a perfect set-up for the Big Colombian Chupacabra, we just need—”
Steve’s expression is fierce; Tony feels it scorching with its intensity even as he fails to determine what it means. He searches Tony’s face as if he’ll find an answer there—though Tony doesn’t know what for.
Steve glares in Tony’s direction. “How long did you know they were on?”
All of Infinity in his grasp, and he can’t get anything he wants, because it’s not even a possibility. It’s not a construction that can be built.
a lot of them went down under friendly fire
“I was saying, are you sure you want to take on renovating and redecorating this whole place by yourself?”
Steve has to believe him. He said he would.
“Everything’s just like it’s supposed to be. If you see any children around town without their guardians, though, give the sheriff a call, would you?”
The mosquitos follow them out of the mud. Eventually the bugs taper off; the heat and humidity don't. There’s a man, or something like one, at a gate, which he opens to let them by. Some ways later there’s a creature that isn’t quite a horse, though trying to figure out what makes it so clearly not a horse sets him on edge. Tony gives it a bouquet of yarrow, which it eats with enthusiasm.
A laugh punches out of him and doesn’t stop. Each laugh he bursts into is a blow to his chest.
“You are alive,” the not-horse notes.
Steve ordered this.
what?
“See you soon,” the infernal creature says with a wink, and then there’s nothing but vapor and the smell of sulfur where something shaped like a man had been standing
I’m saying normal stuff. you’re the one who keeps interpreting it like that
so the casings are part of life support for living beings
A man on a horse gets close enough Tony can hear the mount's breath. Tony punches the man off his saddle.
Tony’s still sore from the night before. More importantly, Steve’s using sex to distract him.
Everyone needs to be held accountable for their actions. Even superheroes need oversight and to face justice. Why can’t Steve see that the SHRA needs to be enforced so it isn’t replaced with something even worse? Why can’t he see that Tony is trying to keep them safe? Fighting Steve is destroying him, but he has to keep going somehow.
“Oh.” Tony stares, his eyebrows starting to knit together before he seems to remember himself and breaks into a grin. “I knew it would work,” he says smugly. “Bruce is the best science bro ever.”
There was a whole folder on Tony. It contained nearly a hundred files: articles; news clips; and amateur footage. None of the files were dated. Some of the news clips and all of the articles mentioned or showed the date, but enough of them didn’t.
wait wait wait don’t get too excited
“Just wondering if I could get you to say it again,” Tony says, unthinking. He hasn’t known how to act around Steve, not since he woke up to find a whole year overwritten in his brain. This is a role reversal for them, now, Steve’s friendliness and Tony’s stiffness. It makes him feel like he’s skipped a step on a staircase, standing here and acting like he's used to the idea that they aren't friends.
a few times yeah
I own analog stuff
::face blowing a kiss:: ::dog emoji::
Tony doesn’t hear a peep about him stabbing a stranger in the neck, nor anything about a man vanishing quick as a wellspring in a desert. Not even from the Parker boy, who’s been poking around just across the way in Banner’s shop.
“Why’d you come back to the team?”
we’re good
Already, Steve’s proximity feels like a hallucination. He’s feet away, now, not even in arm’s reach. As if they’re safe from each other this way.
“Is that gold leaf on the wallpaper?”
So when you got your Tony alone you laid one on him, right?
Steve shakes his head minutely.
I had one too
“It’s awful out there. I’m not ready for what knowing will do to you.”
Tony waits for the afterclaps.
Tony slips, the pad of one foot sliding off the floor and leaving him unsupported. It wrenches his arms, pain exploding across his injured side. A moan escapes him, and he blacks out.
"I—it's difficult to talk about," Steve says after a moment. "It was—a lot of people have died. Las Vegas is" —he takes a deep breath, as if readying himself to say what's next— "gone."
He drops his hand, steps back, and zips himself up again. “See you soon,” he promises before he goes.
“I mean it.”
“I—I’d like you to hold onto these for me,” Steve says. “And—know that I’m thinking about you. I know I’m—I know you don’t think about me the same way, but—”
Tony had a plan for this—like he does for every eventuality, it seems—and his plan was Steve. What a joke.
well so this other tony looked panicked af
“Better than,” Tony says, reaching into his pack and pulling out Steve’s dragoon revolver.
We’re not fighting for the people any more… we’re just fighting. Steve removes his cowl and surrenders. Maybe now his friends will stop hurting each other.
Stark glances up with a frown. “I tell you I’m a molly and that’s all you gotta say?”
It’s his job to announce and introduce them. He refused and was informed that this duty was not optional.
and then OMG
Steve’s supposed to smile at that, so he does.
“Okay,” Tony promises. “I won’t.”
There’s a woman in one of the single seats along one side of the car, a backpack on the floor between her legs, a handbag resting on top of that, and an upright bass in a hard case wedged between the wall and her arm. There’s an open bottle of cola under the seat behind her—the man sitting there has both feet on the seat and his arms wrapped around his knees while he dozes, forehead bouncing against the window. Every time the train jostles, the puddle draws closer to her backpack. The woman eyes it, warily; other than the cola and a few inches around each seat, bodies fill every square inch of floor in the train.
The cheers and yelling were louder than gunshots.
“Lemme—” Tony tries to say, but Steve shifts his weight so Tony can’t find his feet. Steve covers his mouth with one hand and drives against him harder than before. He hoists Tony higher by one hip, so that Tony’s feet scrabble to find purchase, while Steve boxes him in with his legs and weight, keeping his thighs pressed tight around Steve’s cock.
I just didn’t think I was his type.
Then Steve looks away. A muscle twitches in his neck. Even as he pulls away, his physicality is palpable. “We’re here to talk about what’s going on now.”
Yeah I spent a lot of it flying sweeps over the Archives trying to figure out where y’all had gotten your asses to
The Skrulls had hit everywhere at once: SWORD, the Helicarrier, the Raft, the Cube, Thunderbolt Mountain, the Baxter Building, the Sentry. And a virus was uploaded to the Stark mainframe, destroying satellites and SHIELD defense systems.
How could that possibly be true? This can’t be what Tony meant.
“The flowers.” He bends down and plucks a stalk. Several little stems branch from it, each with a cluster of small white blossoms. A dragonfly lands on it. Steve waves the insect off and lifts the flower to his nose. It smells like grass seeds, chrysanthemums, and white sugar. He offers it to Tony.
The man straightens up and frowns at Steve. Probably he's realized that he and Stark have been having their row in the middle of the street and happened upon by the town sheriff. “Honton,” he replies.
Tony pulls the knife out and steps back, but instead of a mess of blood pouring all down Wormseed’s white clothes like water from a broken dam, what he sees is an overripe smile, pale eyes, and a pristine white suit unmoved by wind.
“Why aren’t you angry?”
Steve is—no, the man pretending to be Steve, it can’t be Steve, this is nothing like Steve—Hydra. He’s Hydra’s Supreme Leader. He’s—the things he’s done—the atrocities he’s committed in Steve’s name—
They step out to a pair of doors, side-by-side in a long, curved hallway. Tony offers a brief smile before stepping into one, the door sliding shut behind him. Steve stands there, staring blankly ahead, wondering how many hours they have until they part ways forever.
“I usually just get a lot of booze and cheese and Iron Man merch,” Tony continues. “Which is great! I mean, I love those things. And I mean, no one has to get me anything at all! And Jan always knits me something, and Pepper gets me something that’s like, for work, and Rhodey makes these cookies. Oh, do you want one? They’re really good.”
also it had way too many eyes
Smiling weakly, Tony lifts the arm armored by his gauntlet. “Needs more power.” Then unconsciousness takes him.
He sets Tony down gently on a large bed, making sure Tony has cushions propping him against the headboard. He must see Tony wincing from the light, because he draws the curtains and dims the overhead lights before he leaves the bedroom.
a travesty
Tony smiles, a parody of tenderness. He lifts a spreader bar from the bag and makes a show of examining it. “Oh, you know me, Steve,” he says sweetly. “I’m sentimental.”
Tony, of course, calls him Rhodey, but that feels too familiar for Steve. And James isn’t much better, considering there are already two James Buchanan Barneses on campus, and while Steve still thinks of them both as Bucky in his own mind, they’re also who he pictures when he hears the name
"Can you promise me sumthin' else?"
“Where’s Banner?” Tony asks.
Steve fights to keep his voice even. “It gonna keep you from singing the whole town down like the walls of Jericho?”
“Oh Sheriff,” she says melodically, “have you heard Mister Stark’s yarn about the roller-skates?”
Steve hadn’t heard about those lenses, and he’s surprised Tony follows that sort of thing. Maybe he shouldn’t be, since apparently he makes Clint’s hearing aids, too. “But it wouldn’t really be me,” Steve says, then regrets it as soon as it’s out of his mouth. “I mean—”
He can't bear to be any more specific.
Honton’s cornered Stark at the hotel bar this time; Honton screeching like a banshee, Stark hissing and spitting in a voice too low for Steve to hear. He’s only on his second tumbler of the night, though it’s been full dark out for near an hour. Honton’s lucky to have caught him so early into his now-nightly drinking routine. Then Steve remembers how pretty a tale Stark tells even three sheets to the wind, the clever words that spill out of his mouth even when he’s down to only a handful of his wits, and thinks perhaps Honton’s not so lucky after all.
you’re in a different library dimension thing?
Another newcomer is in town, too, though no one can quite say which train he came in on. His clothes certainly don’t look like they’ve been worn while traveling or packed into a bag; he wears a white waistcoat, jacket, cravat, trousers, and even shiny white boots, not a speck of sand or road dust to be seen about his person. The trousers, waistcoat, and jacket are embroidered in what Steve might call a plaid if it were in any colors other than ivory and cream on white. When Steve stares at it for too long, it looks like it’s moving.
Deals 1500 damage or 1930 if the target has dealt the most damage on the enemy team.
“Honey bees makin’ a hive in the carcass of a lion,” Tony replies after a moment. At the gatekeeper’s nod, he goes on, “What type of bird would be reckoned to lift the heaviest weight?”
“Well. Maybe it ain’t.”
It must look like he’s just going on a jog across campus, because no one gives him a second glance as he runs all the way to Stark Tower.
“I just want to be there for him,” Steve pleads.
The first he speaks of himself is when he tells her about his home planet.
Steve’s here, but he’s not Steve.
Tony makes an aborted gesture that might be a shrug. “You were furious the last time I saw you.”
"Hey," Steve says softly. He isn't quite smiling. The chair he's in looks comfortable, not like what you usually find in hospitals. Tony wonders how long he's been sitting there, or how often. "How're you feeling?"
“What’s next?”
He’s disappointed he doesn’t get to eat it himself, but he has a good feeling that Tony’s going to offer him another.
really hurt, it’s hard to get enough breath to feel better.”
—Tony will take it.
“We’re set with the FBI,” Parker reports unenthusiastically.
“You made it!” Tony had beamed. He’d taken off his jacket, so he was just in a black tee and dark, snug jeans. His hair was mussed, his feet bare, and the arc reactor blazed bright under the thin fabric of his shirt.
"Too long."
two primary types of robots identified
Then he hears the whine of repulsors being charged. “Hey, don’t—”
“Oh yeah? How am I supposed to know that?”
The almost-mouth turns up into an almost-smile. “A crane. If you like feathered folks, how’s this: who’s killed the greatest number of chickens?”
Actually the other Iron Man had a secret identity that Tony helped him keep hidden from the other Captain America.
“What’ve I gotta do?” Steve asks. “How can I help?”
“I don’t know.” Steve turned to Tony. “Tony, I was trying to say, I know I didn’t hurt you—
By the end of it, Steve’s gotten a fair few rounds off, though Mugwort reacts to them like he’s been bitten by a particularly large horsefly, Slovenwood grimaces and plucks them out of his flesh like splinters, Wormseed doesn’t seem to even feel them, and Doom’s armor serves to protect him from everything but a single shot through his shoulder.
bummer
, Tony tells it.
. You’re a genius, you could—”
He recognizes that it’s a kind of magical thinking, feeling closer to Tony because he has something he built out of his armor, like using someone’s blood to cast a spell on them, or a lock of their hair to locate them.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Tony promises.
“What? Why not?” Are there special billionaire cheese knives? Or maybe 21st-century ones Steve doesn’t know about? Probably not the latter, at least, because if there were a known way to improve something metal and analog by adding lasers or hard light holograms or an AI, Tony would’ve been the one to figure it out, and all of campus—and by extension Steve—would know all about it.
“Never happen,” Steve says, finally interrupting. “We’d stop it.”
There was some pretty architecture.
“Of course. You enjoy your evenin’, then."
Please.
Steve doesn’t mean that. He can’t. He—he knows the way to make it stop. That’s why he used the overrides. Why he has them. To stop Tony.
Tony nods.
No one stops Steve from putting himself on the mission. He meets the first wave of Hydra cannon fodder with more vitality and emotion than he’s felt in weeks. It’s like sensation returning to his limbs after coming in from the cold; he’s connected to his body, his purpose, his ideals. This is what he’s for. He knows this. There’s no question that this is right.
Steve takes Tony home. Tony is subdued, speaking only when Steve prompts him.
If Steve’s any judge, Stark’s just under one bottle of whiskey into his evening when Steve takes a seat beside him at the bar. Neppie Gallentine sits at Stark’s other shoulder, laughing and preening.
Then he’s gone, leaving Steve to stand on Tony’s doorstep, thinking that over.
“I didn't know it was him.”
are you two still up in the gallery?
Stark pulls himself upright by feeling along the case of his fortune-telling automaton. He leans against it for a moment, letting it support his weight, before steadying onto his feet. Honton continues yelling. Stark brushes dirt off his trousers and heads toward his front door, Honton turning with him to keep shouting.
don’t let him touch you he’s covered in melted ice cream and toddler gunk
Tony tries to bring up what happened to Bill. He’ll explain, and—
Steve’s already got his feet in the stirrups and started toward town. “Star looks good on you,” he calls over his shoulder.
“This isn’t a mocha,” Tony says, peeling the plastic lid off his cup with renewed suspicion.
Tomorrow's the last chapter! At ~2900 words, it's the longest one.
He tilts one of the IV poles so he can see the bag up close. There are no markings on it. He does the same with the other, but it's just as blank.
When he’s so far from the passage he exited that it’s no longer visible in the distance, a pale sun is rising behind him. It’s nearly past the horizon when he reaches the edge of the river. It’s wide, wider than the Mississippi in Louisiana. The surface is spotted with scrubby, sand-colored grasses and arsenic-green algae. Some ways to Tony’s left is a punt barely big enough for four, a tall, solitary figure standing in it with a still-taller pole pushed into the water. The boat is smack in the middle between the two shores. The boatman is wrapped in a ragged white cloth that can only be described as a shroud, and looking at him fills Tony's head with a screech and clatter louder than a steam engine.
Tony crossed his arms. “So it’s just when you’re talking to me? I would’ve pegged you as the type to make my parents’ murder all about yourself.” He frowned. “I mean, I would’ve pegged you as the type to make it all about yourself.”
Tony’s eyes have an amber cast to them in the twilight. His lip curls. “Yeah, you’re right, I guess the only option
chittt chuk chuk chikk
“Tell me, Steve! Tell me what I can do!” He’s begging. He doesn’t care. “What can I do to make it stop?”
When Tony protests, Steve hits him.
Cyan light from the marquee of a closed-down gas station cuts through the orange-tinged fog, illuminating a snowflake as it falls, right in the scant gap separating Steve’s face from Tony’s. The wind picks up. Another flake catches in Steve’s eyelashes, then the shoulders of his coat, in the skin of his knuckles, on the tips of his ears.
Steve shakes his head. He doesn’t know what to say to make Tony understand.
Steve’s sure the ferryman is someone he knows, someone from town, maybe, who he’s walked past every day for years. He’s also sure he’s never met the man before.
The scent of ammonia hits him again, and he can tell he's fading, can feel the stifling wrapped-in-clouds sensation of painkillers, but he knows that means something, reminds him of something. AIM labs tend to have that singed, methane-flavored scent of Bunsen burners and oxy-fuel. On Skrull ships, you get either the earthy, faintly fungal smell of Skrull exertion, or the sulfuric hints of whatever they use as a cleaning product. Hala smells a little like New York, Tony thinks, or tries to; his brain feels like an unwieldy gastropod oozing into the corners of his skull. Right. Hala. Petrichor and a hint of sewage. The Mandarin's facilities always have a tinge of burnt ozone, which Tony attributes to something about either Makluan technology or the Mandarin's replication of it. And ammonia—ammonia makes him think of blood and the sound of automatic weapons and—and—
That little, feminine voice clearly didn’t belong to Tony: his was deep, a little rough and honeyed, appealing even, and Steve could’ve listened to him talking forever. Mary’s voice was higher, firm but still gentle, and sounded so worried it pulled them out of the rouse-induced haze.
Bucky cracked first, and after a heavy sigh he let down the spoon and glared at Steve.
“What if I’ll bribe you, mister Rogers?” He asked affectionately. They both changed their last names after the wedding, and the complete version was Stark-Rogers, but every variant was like honey for his ears.
“What if–What if we call Happy, send him to pick up the kid,” the Omega’s eyes were still lost in the arousal daze, he couldn’t take his hands off Steve’s shoulders, biceps and everywhere he could reach, being kept at arm’s length.
Sadly, peace and quiet didn’t last long. Tony had as many enemies as Iron Man, and one particularly dangerous showed up just when he and Natasha found the first trace of the Winter Soldier. They destroyed a part of Washington, while Tony and Rhodes saved Pepper and the President, and the nightmares returned.
“Of course I did. You’re upset Omega, and I let it happen, allowing Peter to invite an Alpha to our trip: the first Alpha he’s closed to, who doesn’t belong to our family. I really want to make it up to you,” he hugged his Omega back, tight and comforting, rumbling low and making him sigh in satisfaction.
«It was just a reflex. You know I’m happy that you had it removed, right? It was the right decision.» Steve said, brushing his thumb on the back of his hand. He tried to smile, but the moment his head touched again the pillow, he felt the exhaustion get back again.
«Your- Your arc reactor,» Steve’s dry throat made him sound even more exposed. «It’s gone.» He whispered, lowering his gaze.
Maybe he really hurt Tony, he wasn’t only being over-dramatic or throwing a tantrum for his hormones out of whack. Steve had been patient during the past weeks, always support his Omega during the pregnancy: he prepared in time, he did all the lectures - and made Tony at least listen to him reading them - and asked JARVIS to find useful information on internet. There was too much trash over there.
He saw Steve’s pupils flaring, his lips parting a little when he understood what Tony was saying. “You like the name?” He asked, voice full of hope.
“Uh-uh, piece of cake. I’ll do them suuuuper quickly,” the little Omega climbed out Steve, all scrambled and way too enthusiastic, and the Alpha let him go with a soft chuckle.
“The baby’s fine,” He reassured, and Steve’s body relaxed. “But I’m not, Steve, I’m carrying around a pretty big responsibility here, my back is aching and you weren’t there when I woke up- I know that you need your morning routine as much as I need my lab’s hours, and your scent was still on the bed so I didn’t really feel alone or bad, but, uhm, but, my point is… I - I’m rabbling.” He sighed loudly.
“Hate that doctor. He do’s anythin’ Cap tells him” Tony grumbled, and Steve nodded with proud. “’s just a scared little sh-” Steve let out a cough, disapproving the poor choice of words, stopping him.
to let him go; with his fast reflex, the strength, and the perfect knowledge of Tony’s movements, he could’ve blocked him on the spot before he even moved. Wouldn’t that be…fantastic? No, no no no, that was still his body talking. More specifically, his ass, still sore, but apparently extremely fucking thirs–
“You’re a f- OH, HILARIOUS, AND HERE I THOUGHT THAT’S MY PLANE!” He speeded up anyway, bordering on running. Half of the jet belonged to Steve, his mind recalled, and he promptly removed that thought. What’s mine is mine, and what’s Steve’s is mine too, so. Whatever, He was aching, because his Alpha was a fucking tease and he could blame only himself really, he’s been the bad influence in that sense, all over the years.
“Alpha,” he whined, but doing as his Alpha commanded, pressing his forehead against Steve’s shoulder. They both huffed and sighed, but there weren’t much they could do.
“We’re not at war, honey,” he kissed him again, on the lips that time, as sweet as he could. “And even if he were, and one of us... Alpha, if one of us didn’t make it, we’ll never be alone”
The Omega tried to take the mug off Steve’s hand, but the bastard lifted his arm too high for his height, so he started to whine and to complaining as they moved around the kitchen like children who were playing tag. Only slower, because Tony was still very pregnant, and Steve didn’t want him to be hurt.
Then, he woke up one day and he discovered he slept for almost 70 years, and everything started again. His nightmares were full of water, strange technologies and aliens. Often they came all together, even if he slept once every four days and not for many hours.
“It works with Sam ‘n Clint,” he spoke while chewing, and it wasn’t pretty. A memory soothed Steve’s spirit: Bucky used to lose his charm when there were only the two of them.
, and I can’t wait your next heat for having you all to myself. Consider this trip as a break, and when we’ll be back, I’m planning to keep you in our bed, in my arms, purring for me, so satisfied and trembling you’ll forget what day it is and how many times I made you come”
He entered the new Avengers compound and slid his shield off his shoulders, setting it aside on the floor. Sometimes also Captain America could be a little messy, by leaving the shield anywhere, or the dirty dishes in the sink, or putting coffee grounds in the disposal. Nothing that Tony didn’t know already.
“So… You’re Peter’s friend”
Last night, the Omega caught him off guards: he didn’t expect to be accused of losing interest in the most brilliant, breathtaking, handsome man on the entire planet. The thought kept him awake all night, and he hoped breakfast would’ve been a chance to clarify, to remember Tony he loved him above anything else.
The Alpha smiled tenderly, and he leaned to kiss the top of his head, finally pressing a warm and protective hand on his back between his shoulder blades. “Of course, pretty Omega” he reassured, rumbling quiet.
, so he settled for bumping his nose against Steve’s shoulder and inhaling the Alpha’s heavy scent with a quiet sigh.
His Alpha was doing something about it: group session, they worked according to him; Tony himself had his huge share of issues, but he chose a private therapist to set them straight.
me with that tone, Alpha,” Tony whispered threatening, pointing a finger to Steve’s face. At least he didn’t yell, probably for the same reason Steve didn’t want to say the wrong thing, “And yes, that would’ve been helpful, a good starting point”
“You’re good at removing shirts,” the Omega confirmed.
Tension rose when Peter left the room, the Omega felt it on his skin. After a few seconds of heavy silence, he heard snarls ripping from the Alpha’s throat, his jaw set in a hard line, his instincts were surging and he felt the need to stop him, to reassure his Alpha everything was fine, no one would’ve taken away his children from him. Tony ran to gather his mate close, running his hands soothingly over his body, and murmuring into his ear. He kissed Steve many times, on his earlobe, on both eyelids, on the tip of his nose and finally on his lips, hearing the growl reducing kiss after kiss.
Steve couldn’t believe Bucky’s questionable method worked, for that reason he took a few seconds before reacting. He had his Omega completely relaxed against him, his delicious scent was filling his nose and he could sense a rush of Tony’s wet slick pooling between his thighs. Fuck, he could already feel the delicious taste on his tongue.
“Can you tell Snow White, please?”
Steve run out of air and froze, while Tony got up and searched for possible threats. When he didn’t see anything wrong, he turned to Steve and found him really pale, covered in sweat. His whole body was trembling and he was watching Tony as if he was the most absurd thing in the world.
