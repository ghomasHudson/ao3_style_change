He picked up the black leather collar with a silver "Toto" mounted on it, frowning as he eyed the dog, contemplating how it would fit.  He glanced over at the fluffy black wolf ears head band on the bed and pushed down the surge of anger.
Seriously.
Without a word Steve, lifted the edge of the blanket, the welcome unspoken and deeply appreciated. The book was set aside and arms tucked him close to that barrel chest. The steady thump of a heartbeat against his cheek, chasing away his errant thoughts and settling him the way nothing else could.
He was the Iron King and the Iron King has no weakness.
It was only here, in his private rooms; that he could afford to loosen the tight hold he usually kept on himself. Only here could he set down the armor and be something other than the Iron King, protector and servant of the people.
“So you’re not so much the boogie man after all.”
A day late. Again. I will try to catch up tonight.
It was Thor’s good concert suit and Loki would kill them both in their sleep if he found out that his brother had lent it to Steve for the night. But desperate times called for desperate measures and Steve was definitely fucking desperate.
Removal of their masks revealed three men and a woman, all middle aged with faces extremely pale and smeared with soot. They all remained tight lipped in the face of his questions so he gagged them and set the Legionnaire on sentry mode.
"Like you even answer any of her calls El Rey." Heather, his second in command and beta fox scoffed as she kept pace with him through the woods. "Remember that time you rerouted all calls from her number to the local dog pound? I swear her catty bitch of a daughter Laura wanted to scratch your pretty brown eyes out for a month after."
Stiles made a face at that, confused by the sharp lancing pain in his chest. He felt his eyes begin to sting and quickly blinked them away. His next breath was a bit ragged and watery but he kept breathing steadily until it passed. There was nothing he could think of to say.
He finished typing and waved away the keyboard, glancing at the small confirmation icon that all the messages and instructions had been sent.
Yeah, he was gonna be okay.
Stiles stared down at his hands, flexing his palm and wincing as the thick scar tissue pulled. He absently massaged his palm with his other hand, biting back the million questions he wanted to ask.
Anthony curled his lip, his brown eyes sparking with anger. It had all been a test, a trap set by the rebels to set him off balance, to observe how he responded to the sight of his soldier ripped apart and destroyed. He gestured sharply at the whole tableau, as if saying 'satisfied?'
He watched them walk out and slumped back in his chair, closing his eyes to everything for one peaceful moment.
"Yup." She nodded, her curls bouncing cheerfully. "The spell you set up worked. It came right to the Nemeton like catnip. Brought a couple of friends like you guessed it would.  Got them all in one neat swoop."
"Get a fucking room you two, you're stinking up the place and driving the dogs wild."
Where was the man who appreciated his unconventional thinking. Where was the man who'd read them all the riot act about following every lead and not letting anything slip through the cracks.
He gave her a serious and contemplative look then turned to Jake.
By the next spring, people were accustomed to dealing with him and he'd already visited several homesteads to diagnose and treat several ailments. One farmer had thanked him as the Witch of the Woods as he was making his leave and from then on the title had landed on his shoulders just like that.
This time though, after a quick look around, she ducked into the janitor's closet; shucking her tote bag and yanking off her scarf. Her dress followed, along with her clunky boots.
She slipped on those cheap foldable five dollar flats and pulled the legs and the sleeves of the leotard down passed her heels and knuckles. The latex gloves went on and the hairnet was pulled up to cover her hair.
Rodney waved him into the jumper and dropped himself into the pilot's chair. "They're not coming today. It's just the two of us. I wanted to show you something."
“Just wait.“Reaper grinned wickedly. “You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.”
A picnic, which Ronon loved. In this stunningly beautiful space, which Ronon helped them find.
He'd scored a couple of ruby red glitter heels, forgoing the silver ones even though they would have been more historically accurate. They were hella cool even though he'd had to practice walking in them for weeks so that he wouldn't break his ankles on the night.
The blond shrugged, still working on whatever he had before him. Anthony curiosity soon got the better of him and he eased off the bed carefully and wandered over to the other man. He was soldering some delicate circuitry that looked like nothing else the brunet had ever seen before. Anthony stepped closer, almost touching the larger man’s arm as he tried to get a better look. The captain froze, glancing over from the corner of his eyes before starting once again.
He could shoulder it though. It was what he'd always done. He'd step away from SI for a while, letting Pepper and Happy circle the wagons and protect the company.
Tony stood in the alley way, ignoring the drizzling rain as it steadily soaked his shirt sleeves through. The night was still warm and the drizzle misted over everything, making the dirty streets shining in the flashing red and blue lights.
The Iron King was the holy hand of Sol.
Frowned as Natasha smirked at him from across the kitchen table and murmured a vague comment about checking the workshop, before slipping out of the kitchen with an arm full of snacks.
"Reynard Stiles…" Talia began once more. "Surely if you heard the circumstances of the situation…."
With how both Rossi and Prentiss were nodding sagely at the blonde's words, Spencer realized that he was really and truly trapped between a rock and a hard place.
He so fucking tired and didn't want to do this anymore. Any of it. He was stepping back and letting the chips fall where they may.
"Are you kidding? There's going to be ALL the dog jokes."
He could hear the weeping of his people behind him. The  very young and the very old, the weak and infirm. Those who had not been able to pick up a weapon and fight the scourge that had been slowly encroaching.
Derek nosed his way up his lover's spine before tucking himself along the younger man's back. He took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. His mind ran on the scene earlier today when Stiles had gone left instead of right, trying to protect Scott.
After a while the captives began to lose their fear and became more curious of the robot keeping guard. One of them made a noise of recognition, their eyes darting from Anthony’s hooded and masked face to the tarnished gold visage of the automaton. The driver turned navigator carefully directed them between an out cropping of rocks, revealing a sheltered canyon; at the end of which stood a large set of doors.
She gave him a smart salute and grinned as he chuckled. "Hey Johnny. Thanks for the whiskey."
"Come on… You're overdue for your downtime. Zelenka and Biro will cover for you for the next 24 hours straight. I have something for you that will make you forget all of those assholes."
The blond gave him a slow and appreciative look. “You look good in our clothes. They suit you.”
He drained the last of his liquid courage and thumped the heavy crystal glass down unto the bar. That would be his only drink for tonight. He needed to be clear headed if he was going to achieve his nearly impossible goal. The rest of the night would be club soda and bitters if he didn’t want to accidentally throw up on someone important from nerves.
He stumbled out into the harshly lit room he’d stood in before, where he’d first met the captain. There were more people this time and most of them stopped and stared as he passed, their conversations falling quiet. He forced down the urge to squirm uncomfortably. He would not show weakness before these shadow dwellers.
After listening to his woes, she hummed softly before curtly reminding him of  his culture and hung up. He gaped at the phone, affronted by her unspoken slight at his intelligence, before flopping back unto the bed with a sigh.
The table shook, the holographic map floating above it flickering briefly before steadying. Nobody even blinked, accustomed to the General taking his ire out on the furniture. Tony nodded for the advisor to continue, listening closely to the detailed report of the indecent.
The man smiled and it was beautiful.
They all went into her tote bag, along with a bottle of water, a granola bar and her overdue library books. She stomped down the stairs, stopping at a closed door.
He resigned from NCIS the next day.
Competent and good looking bar tenders flitted confidently from customer to customer, pouring and mixing a myriad of drinks for the very rich, very demanding crowd. It was all so surreal and so fucking terrifying at the same time.
The voice was asking his permission to touch him and he managed to nod shakily. He was pulled from the car gently and made to sit on the curb, his head tucked between his knees as a the gently hand gently rubbed his back.
"Your dad would be so mad that you're doing this."
It took them an hour to reach one of the old ceremonial pyres, deep in the thick woods and overlooked by the King's decree that all of the old temples and holy sites be destroyed.
He was a King, even if these rebels did not know it. He would carry himself as such. He was more than his doomed soul bond. He was more than just a man whose secret hopes had just been crushed. He was more than just Anthony, who wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of his days tinkering with his little machines.
"Stiles…" a soft voice came from the back of the wolves, Scott stumbling his way forward as if he'd been given a hard shove. "What if your dad was one of the lives in danger? How would you feel if something were to happen to him?"
“You look a little nervous. Let me buy you a drink gorgeous.” A warm, deep voice said from his right elbow. A hand wearing an expensive looking red and gold watch slapped a thick money clip down unto the bar. “Bar keep, another one of whatever my friend just had, thanks.”
Tony swallowed down his hurt, shunting aside his wounded pride for later. This wasn't the first time that Gibbs had dressed him down in public, but it was the first time where bearing the brunt of his boss' anger felt like a punishment, not a choice.
His skin was pale, much like everyone Anthony had seen so far, but there were patches of pink along his arms, wrists and neck. This man had been in sunlight. Very recently in fact. Anthony narrowed his eyes as the man absently rooted around on the table for some tool or the other.
In this cold and dark place, he felt naked, weak and at the mercy of the shadows that lurked at every corner. The Rebel leader had him at a disadvantage and it galled him to be in such a position.
He looked down at the man at his feet. Ronon had taken the brunt of the impact when the floor had collapsed beneath them, breaking his leg and injuring his head which was still bleeding sluggishly through the bandage Rodney had managed to put around it.
Ewan shook his head, "Wrong. There's something not right I tell you. This place is creepy as fuck and shrouded in an unholy mist. When has that ever boded well for a group of young, albeit alright looking twenty somethings?"
Kiba kicked at the dirt road as he walked, hands in his pockets as he slouched within his jounin jacket.  Akamaru was just a bit ahead, sniffing at bushes and generally being a dog. It wasn't often that his nin companion got to just fuck around so Kiba liked to cut him some slack every so often.
Once in a while they would pass an open doorway, carved directly from the bedrock. The room beyond would be lit with the same blue light, its occupant bustling around the small cramped space, hard at work.
"She said that her grandfather, Kind Gerard, gets more and more crazy every day and that her dad has been taking more and more of the royal duties.  She also said that he's been stepping up her training in weapons and matters of state. That's good right?"
Stiles grinned wickedly, "I stole it from Derek Hale after I fucked his brains out. "
His dad had nodded and gone on with his day, no longer that surprised with the things his son came up with.
The Forge at North Pass burned, belching massive columns of black smoke into the ever blue skies. Raging hot flames flickered within the black cloud as cascading explosions slung burning debris and ash far out unto the fields of green below. The fire roared like a beast, licks of the almost white flame reaching up hungrily to where Anthony hovered, several of the Iron legion in formation around him like an honour guard.
"Didn’t Carson brief either of you on this?" Rodney gave her a disbelieving look. At both Teyla's and Ronon's confused expressions, he turned and gave a helpless look at their team leader. "John."
He'd watched you tube videos on styling his brown wig into pigtails, the blue ribbons tied in bows at the ends of the braids.
Thunder rumbled in the distance and he imagined that it sounded a little further away this time.
He also had to know which ones never to dial. Which ones lead to poisonous atmospheres or to enemies just as bad as the wraith. He had to keep them all in his head and keep them straight because one small mistake could lead to death, or worse.
After a few terse seconds, the lettered started to move once more.
Derek soon joined him in laughter and it echoed through the quiet and cozy little house for a long while. They settled against each other on the couch, Derek’s arm slung over Stiles’ shoulder as they caught their breath.
His chest ached, his breaths burning as his vision swayed. He leaned his head against the wheel and tried to do one of the exercises that Jarvis tried to teach him but it didn't seem to be working.
Tony leaned against the railing and looked out unto the city lights. “I’ve spent most of my life making weapons and gear to support our troops in the field. Things designed to wage war. Maybe it’s time I help our brave soldiers after they get home as well.”
He looked away, staring unseeing out into the night. “It’s Bucky you see, he’s my best friend. My brother. He lost his arm out there. A few seconds later and he’d have lost so much more. I’d have brought him home in a body bag.”
Riddick blinked, his eyes adjusting to the light and he looked up to see a rugged man looking down at him with a last smirk. He gave the man a slow once over, his mind racing furiously. The man’s face was known to him, his reputation even better known. He looked around to see if the man’s partner was around but there was no sign of her.
He ends up following the redhead out of the large room, looking back just once to catch a glimpse of the blond over the shoulders of the other two rebels. He was standing there, watching them leave with the strangest look on his face.
Anthony ached, his heart twisting at this weakness. Here he was, letting down his defenses before the enemy. Soul mate or not, The Captain was dangerous. He was the leader of the rebel scum, the one who’d united the rabble and had led them against the sunlight kingdom. He was a clever and ruthless scoundrel who the Iron King had sworn to destroy.
Invited. Tch. More like strongly suggested by the Don of the east coast himself.
"Don't need too. Answer's still no. your little tree fucker's not setting a foot across our borders. Period. End of discussion."
Then he would make the trip down dirt side to visit one of his friends and spend some time soaking up all the planet had to offer. Quatre would welcome him with open arms, letting him sleep his jet lag off in a nice big bed, before stuffing him full of food and taking him to visit the Maguanacs at their coastal base.
Without thinking twice about it, he turned further into Derek’s embrace and tucked his face into the werewolf’s neck; a soft whine escaping his throat.  Arms tightened around him, holding him steady as he shook, his mind still reeling by what he’d just witnessed. When he finally pushed away, the arms loosened but still held him, Derek’s skin warm and comforting through the thin material of his t-shirt.
“Clint!” The captain scolded “we have to be sensitive to Peter’s pain, it must have been a hard decision to make”
Harry wanted to pull his hair out, he never really developed much of a sweet tooth how could he when the Dursley’s never allowed him any sweets?
His godfather just smiled back and clapped him on his back.
Because Tony knows Peter would have treated her like his little sister, looked out for her, protected her. He would have been an amazing big brother.
“Metal arm man right, I fight you, I win. But he wrong spider not scared.”
“Due Stark's mistrust of me, he will not let me go alone with him."
"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead -" She was sobbing heavily by now her breaths coming out in tiny little gasps, she was nearly incoherent, Harry's chubby little fists now clutching tightly onto the bars of his crib, eyes wide and filled with fear. "Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy..."
Tony feels pain like he never has before.
Loki took a deep breath, he hesitant to continue.
“This is not enough for heir Potter-Black to have gained an emancipated status”
“Thanks girl, patch it through to my lab, I will take the call in there”
Glad they’re finally getting somewhere Peter nods.
“Ahh I see. What you ask for will be done, simply sign these papers Lord Black, heir Potter-Black”
A couple of minutes passed, and Dudley hadn’t returned with or without the freak but that was alright Vernon thought, probably just taunting the boy. When a few more minutes passed, and Dudley still hadn’t returned, Vernon began to stand up when he heard a dull thud coming through the front door, he turned to his wife with a small frown and they both made their way to the open door. Petunia let out a small gasp and clutched her hands to her mouth in shock, Vernon’s frown deepen and opened his mouth to ask what was wrong when Petunia seemingly fainted on the spot. He rushed to his downed wife and when he got closer he finally saw what had shocked his wife so before he could comprehend what he was seeing, he too appeared to just collapse.
“What?” Peter looked up at the man distractedly, shaking his head as if to clear it “Oh, um yeah, I’m fine. Just where is Mr Stark?”
When the pain he felt the instance the gauntlet was on him gone, Tony knew he just knew that somehow Peter was responsible. So he looks to where he saw him last but he’s not there he’s beside Tony.
“Good, to see you awake Queens” The man said when, their eyes connected, nope Peter was not fanboying, especially not over the fact that the original avenger had a nick name for him.
Flashblack
So he pushes his enhanced body to it’s limits like he’s never done before to point where he’s running so fast he’s practically flying.
Harry took the blood quill that was offered him and nicked the tip of his thumb over the parchment with it, once the blood drop touched the surface of the parchment the small cut automatically healed.
And he was an avenger, it doesn’t matter that it was never official, that the team was broken up when he came onto the scene.
Peter thought mind reading was an affect of the mind stone not soul. The figure rises an eyebrow in judgement.
Tony let out a gasp in shock. He was not expecting that.
He had thought that he had gotten ridden of the girl when he convinced Howard and Maria to give the bitch up; Even at the young age Obadiah knew that Lily Stark possessed an intellect and perceptiveness for beyond what was normal for her age and would soon surpass both her father and brother and therefore she had to go before she could become a problem. If any of the Starks would figure out what he was up to it would be her. It was a blessing that she was dead in his opinion, he placed the letter in desk draw he would place it in his safe at home when he left to go home.
That had to be Bucky he had the mouth of a sailor when he actually bothered to speak, he glared mostly though which honestly scared Peter a little bit at first than he had gotten to know the man and found out he was a giant cuddly teddy bear underneath it all.
“Captain cold this better be good and was in the middle of something extremely important”
The whole battlefield inhales, shocked at just came out of this kids mouth.
Strange was looking at Peter weirdly, his hands folding on top of the end of his bed, the scars that Strange had once told him he got in a car accident more obvious under the harsh lighting of the room they were in. “You alright, kid?”
The others wanted him in there, to preserve his body for the funeral they argued. But before that can happen the world needs fixing, Peter isn’t their priority but he’s Tony’s.
There was also the fact that his mum and dad both lived with his uncle on a semi permanent basis and he seems to be oblivious to this fact.
He at last came to the end of the parchments and signed his name at the bottom next to Sirius’ signature. He was finally free.
The man of iron leaving was unlikely to be a big problem, he did it all the time after all. He wasn't likely to need the avengers, if he hadn't even told them he was leaving in the first place but after the recent struggles with Ultron, Thor was rather on edge at the idea of Stark going off on his own.
“Late afternoon tomorrow, Mr Ross said we could take the company’s plane, we will leave early morning”
Screaming fearfully (with the charm broken, maybe the neighbours would hear?) Lily turned clutching Harry tightly to her, she whispered "Harry, you are so loved, Mama loves you. Dada loves you. Harry, be safe. Be strong"
He thinks about his aunt May, Ned and Mj even Harry who he hadn’t spoken to in years even before Thanos and the snap that decimated half the universe.
“Where’s the guy with a goatee” that had to be Mister Stark, right? That the other Peter was talking?  Or maybe it could be the Strange guy? Peter wondered as he knows that Mister Stark wouldn’t leave him if even if he had just scraped a knee. The reply to the question was lost as everyone began the notice that he was now awake, since everyone saw he was now up Peter opened his eyes blinking rapidly in order to adjust to the new light and sat up, clutching his still throbbing head, and looked around. His gaze landed on Steve Rogers, Captain America! Peter was most definitely
They had made the appointment in the muggle world to make it harder for anyone to track what they were up to, there were some of course that still could but it brought him and Sirius some time and lessen the pressure on them.
Loki stares at his brother, they both knew he would never admit such weaknesses to anyone let alone to Stark.
Vernon was monetarily distracted when Dudley turned on the TV, he sighed as the news about the abnormal activities played again, something about some group called the avengers and picked up the secondary remote and turned the channel.
And aren’t they smart Harry, so clever to think of all of them.
That didn’t work either.
“Ahh yes, he is we were just finishing a meeting, I’ll put him on now”
His son groaned and got up from the table and hobbled towards the door reluctantly, the freak would pay for making them pause their dinner.
And Peter knows, he just knows what’s about to happen next.
Vernon took another bite of his dinner; the chicken was quite juicy, and traces of the gravy could be found dripping from his moustache. Through his small piggy eyes, he could see Petunia adding another helping of potatoes and piece of chicken onto their son Dudley’s plate. Good, the boy will grow up to be big and strong, Vernon thought to himself. Unlike that runt of a boy, speaking of.
If they had they would of thought to cover Peter as he had long shed his mask.
At this point the other avengers really really wanted to leave the room but both Tony and Peter were standing in front of the door.
The confusion was apparent in his tone, he thought that his pseudo uncle would also be coming with them. With his forced participation in the Triwizard tournament he was all but declared an adult especially since the chief wizard of Wizengamot who also happen to be his (illegal) magical guardian didn’t fight his participation they were going to the Gringotts to make it official and for him to claim his heirships to the Potter and Black estates.
Cut-throat cut across his godfather before he could finish speaking.
‘Oh, no this is strictly a stealth mission FRIDAY, In and out with none the wiser.’
"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!"
Tony turned off and put down his tablet and made his way from the common area to his penthouse to start packing. He had a feeling that it would be an exhausting trip.
Like Tony hadn’t failed him.
Lily just shakes her head used to her husband's antics by now, she did have to put up with it all throughout Hogwarts after all. She opens her mouth to reply with  an admonishment when a loud bang cuts her off.
Suddenly the pain is gone.
If she could just get to the fireplace on the other side of the room they could get away before he'd realised they'd gone. But even as she thought it, she realised how hopeless it really was. Voldemort was already at the nursery door.
Loki just sneered in response, before clearing his face back into a blank mask, he would need the emotional distance however small it maybe for what he was about say. It would bring up hurtful memories for the both of them, but perhaps if what he heard was true whilst spying on Stark it may just allow them to start healing.
“You chop it off, it will grow back” Peter smirks
He pulled the stack of parchment that cut-throat had put in front of his godfather and got to reading, he was not stupid enough to sign something without reading it first no matter how much more respect and trust cut-throat and Harry had for each other which was a lot more than was normal between goblins and wizards.
"I will pass along your concerns then brother." Thor said non to gently.
Even when he couldn’t be there he protected Morgan, she sleeps with a spider-man plushie underneath spider-man quilts, with a picture of Peter by her bedside looking after her; scaring away all the monsters with a spider-man night-light shining away.
“I didn’t choose the name Spider-Man for shits and giggles; my DNA is literally half of that of a spider”
Heads bowed.
“Do we have tooo?” He whined, even as they made there way out of the shop to the law office just down the road.
Harry was currently wondering who was the parent in his and his godfather’s relationship, the man was just about jumping out of his skin with excitement and mostly likely due to a sugar high.
each other.
Tony nodded forgetting that the lawyer couldn’t see him, it made sense they’re people who would take advantage with a lawyer it mitigated the damage.
The whole battlefield let’s out a breath when they realise nothing happen and they look to Tony suddenly scared.
Having Morgan soften him, sue me he thinks to himself.
“No my arm is dying, you need to get rid of it to stop the damage from spreading, it’s stopping me from healing fully”
And Peter remembers that Mr Stark is back on Earth where he lived the last five years without him.
Still he’s too slow from stopping Tony getting the gauntlet off Thanos but not too slow to use the distraction of Thanos realising he doesn’t have the stones anymore to take them from Tony.
“So, when’s the arm going to grow back?”
"No, that...that isn't possible..." He said quietly. "Wh...when did..." again Loki sighed.
“Bruce now!” Shouts Tony, Bruce nods his mind made up, if it keeps him calm then, Bruce will help. He turns to Strange and T’challa they can take the kid to Wakanda, they nod and plan is put into motion but just as he’s about to pick the kid up he opens his eyes again.
Peter’s going to die.
Unbeknownst to the avengers and co since the moment Peter snapped his fingers there was a news helicopter over ahead recording everything that was happening.
“Yeah kiddo it is, if it’s okay with you I would still like to come to London and sort things out?”
“Harry? He’s fourteen what does he need a lawyer for?”
Harry could say without a doubt that he did not see that coming and he was also extremely confused some of the results were expected and others not but that could easily be explained and the rest, Harry didn’t know how they could possibly be explained. He handed the parchment to Sirius at his insistent nudging, he could see his godfather’s eyes widening the further down he read that was a good sign; shows he wasn’t keeping things from Harry.
Peter walked up to her but unlike with the stone she’s didn’t sense when he was near so he reached out and tapped her on the shoulder. She startles but turns to face him.
Peter shakes his head, hurt that that’s what Tony would think.
Peter points to Bucky and says “My arm, get rid of my arm”
“When you leave is entirely up to you Peter, I would suggest though before you do so that you find the others”
“Kid, it’s time to go” There’s a hand on his shoulder and for a second Peter thinks… he lets himself believe that it might be Mr Stark. But then he looks up and see’s the other Peter, the older one who said he was from Missouri.
“Gross I knew that stuff was coming out of you” pipes up Sam, completely ignoring the tense atmosphere in the room.
Everything in his life had lost all meaning, none it mattered as the moment right now did and okay maybe he was fanboying just a
"I overheard Stark talking to FRIDAY" He said.
Peter finally stops talking and relaxes into his hold like he never wants to leave and let’s out a happy sigh.
He and Mr Stark part ways, running back into the thick of it.
He lets out a quiet sob that is somehow heard by everyone and slowly they tickle around him and Peter. Tony pays them no mind trying to keep Peter’s attention on him, trying to keep him awake.
So Peter asks. “Why can I see you?” The figure stares for a moment “because you opened your mind”
“I didn’t choose the name Spider-Man for shits and giggles, my DNA is literally half of that of a spiders”
A blinding smile appeared on his face. Before he could say anything, a piercing alarm sounded and the lights began to flash red, the alarm stopped before the Captain's voice exclaimed through the speakers.
“The pain would of killed you before you even finished healing, but because you’re here you don’t feel pain so your body can concentrate on the actual problem instead of just the symptoms of the problem.
“Listen here, witchy witch don’t assume to know what I got going on . You know what they say it only makes an ass out of you and me but mostly you. Only you actually”
Tony understood that, he just didn’t care.
So Captain America picks up Spider-Man and carries him off the battlefield, his limp body in his arms. The avengers stoically following beside him.
“So?” asks Tony bringing everyone back to the point at hand.
“We’re not getting rid of your arm, Just because you think having a metal one would be cool”
Tony makes his dislike known.
So he holds on tighter as even more explosions go on and he feels the weight of someone throwing themselves over him and pulling him out of the way as a missile explodes just where he was.
"If it is such a problem you ought to talk to Stark about his security." Loki snarled, ignoring his brother's last comment. Stark did not deserve the truth for what he had done or more appropriately what he hadn't.
It doesn’t matter that he never went on a mission with them.
They were also working on his removing his guardianship from the Dursley’s. He might already be emancipated but that was in the wizarding world and not quite valid in the muggle one.
He had never grew to like that one, the bitch.
Harry let out a nervous breath that he had been holding in for the duration of the conversation with his uncle Tony (not that he had actually called the man that).
He might actually die
With the last of his energy he falls into the Titan in what seems like a last ditch attempt the whole battlefield holds their breath but it’s a distraction Tony hold on to the gauntlet and waits for the nanobots to transfer the gauntlet to him and then lets go.
Peter feels pain like he has never felt pain before.
A cinnamon roll, really.
this time.
His only exception to this was his favourite desert treacle pie, now that he could eat all day.
James stands up instantly and performs a mirror spell on the front door. His mouth hangs open in disbelief for a moment before he gets himself together and turns to his wife.
He shivered at the thought of diapers and changing them…he was going to need therapy once Harry was older Tony just knew he was going to be scarred for the rest of his life. A nanny would need to be hired but Tony was hesitant, his sister’s letter coming back to him.
“Peter nooooooooo!” Tony screams, the whole battlefield eerily quiet as Thanos’ army fades into dust one by one.
He hadn’t seen the freak in a while, he better not be up to any of his freakish tricks he thought to himself again.
Harry just nodded his agreement it made sense after all, most of their current plans rely on the headmaster not knowing what they were up to.
“Ready to get out of here little ńayk”
Tony’s just about to argue back when  Peter starts to speak out of nowhere, although Steve’s not really sure what comes out of his mouth is words so much as it’s a lot of hissing.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know. There was a letter your mother wrote thirteen years ago but I only just got it and once I read it I made plans to come and get you but then I found out that someone I had trusted and purposely kept it from me and that I got it thirteen years too late”
“Is Harry with you? I would like to speak to him”
Harry made his way through the short tunnel connecting Privet drive to Wisteria walk and waiting for him on the other end was aforementioned godfather, obviously under countless glamour spells along with other charms to help make sure his presence wasn’t detected by anyone other than Harry himself. Harry couldn’t help the smile that creeped onto his face as soon as his godfather came into his sight; his steps became quicker and soon enough he fell into run and all but collapsed into Sirius’ arms. Sirius let out bark like laughter but nonetheless pulled his godson even closer and let out a relaxed sigh knowing that the boy he thought of his own was okay, that he was alive and well albeit a bit thinner than he would have liked.
That’s how long Peter had been dust for.
He knows he’s going to die.
That brings back delightful memories he thinks to himself.
So I Finally finished rewriting this whole story, so we got three options.
Tony at this point was immune.
There was a pause and some talking on the other side of the line.
And then Steve comes saying that “there’s  footage of the battle…. Everyone saw… Spider-Man, everyone knows it’s Peter…. They know he’s…”
Five years.
“You are in a way, your arm is dying to stop the damage spreading and in its place a new one will grow”
Nobody said anything, so Strange gave a short nod bye, opened one of his yellow portal things and stepped through before he left though he turned back to Peter and said “When you’re back home, swing by the sanctum we need to talk. Your father knows where it is.” He nodded his head in agreement, what the doctor wanted to talk about that they couldn’t just talk here and now.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
People are displaced, scared and didn’t know what was going on. The avengers need to be there for the public they argued.
'James and I, we’re in hiding right now. James didn't want to tell you…I agreed because I knew you would want us to go to you… Insist that you could keep us safe'
It’s Peter! He’s alive! He just woke up.” The princess exclaimed in disbelief and she race back out of the room. Tony immediately goes to follow but Steve is stuck in disbelief.
"James, stop working Harry up he'll never go down for his nap otherwise"
Tony thinks that a lot has changed in five years, he has a daughter now and they had just celebrated her fifth birthday.
“Yes that’s good, do you know when you be here by?”
“Why would someone do that?”
Gamora didn’t know how to answer that, she guessed Quill could be considered powerful or at least before the Killed his father and as a result Quill lost his newfound powers but none of her other friends were all that powerful when compared to the immense unquantifiable power of the soul and the rest of the infinity stones.
Perfect timing Tony thought to himself, just the excuse he needed to get out of this briefing.
Peter looks over to see Captain America throwing mjolnir his way, he reaches out to grab hold as it passes him and for a second nothing happens and Peter is almost crushed before the hammer lifts him up and carries him away.
Peter let out a put upon sigh, making a few of the avengers laugh.
2. Wait until I finish writing the grass is greener rewrite (probably june/july time) and post both at the same.
, as Mr Stark walked in with his aunt in tow who by the look on her face had heard her nephew’s last comment.
“This is nice” Peter whispers and immediately proceeds to ruin the moment by saying “I guess we’re there now”
That Tony does care about so he gets his lawyers and Pepper on it, his eyes never leaving Peter’s.
The first thing that he notices, other than the pain that he was growing through was numerous heartbeats all around him; it sound as if the whole team was huddled around his bed, which would exactly be a
It was Wanda however that had a reply.
Rogers stoic expression in place just lifted his eyebrow he in the way he does to shows his absolute disappointment in you.
Harry owned a lot to his godfather in fact, he knew everything about the order of the phoenix and their current movements and he knew more importantly of the meddling of a certain old breaded wizard. Dumbledore had enacted a communication blackout on Harry, something that all his so-called friends had no problem following despite the fact that Harry had only just a short few weeks ago witnessed the death of his boyfriend Cedric not that those traitors were privy to that little titbit of information. His godfather was the only who knew and had bothered to keep in contact and make sure he was okay, well okay as he could be given the circumstances.
Maybe it was time that he took a very long vacation, one that lasted a few years, at the very least until Harry was of age to go to Illvermory as Hogwarts was out of the question regrettably and then it would be down to good old muggle fake names and disguises along with some glamour charms to keep Harry’s identity safe.
That didn’t help clear things up at all, who the hell was the trickster?
Obadiah Stane was not a very considerate and compassionate man, evidence by the fact of him keeping and hiding a letter he was sure Tony would very much want to see. Which presented Obadiah with a problem this letter threw a spanner in his work and would derail his plans for Tony and the company and thus unfortunately it could never make it’s way into Tony’s hands.
Tony made to get up before Steve grabbed his arm and once again let loose the eyebrow of disappointment.
And suddenly he gets up, his energy renewed. Ready to give every last atom and cell of his body til he’s nothing when he catches Strange looking at him, holding up one finger.
And the helicopter sure that it’s seen everything there is to see turns and  flies away.
‘FRIDAY, we got any hits yet. I want this sorted yesterday’
Steve had only just managed to convince Tony to get some sleep in the quest quarters T’challa had given them when alarms started blaring down the palace.
Not even when he was forced to feel every single one of his cells tear apart only to stitch themselves up again as his healing factor kicked in over and over again.
Peter almost reaches out to pull Mr Stark back into a hug before he manages to stop himself he definitely did make grabby hands to him though.
Peter thought this might be an appropriate place to announce that he was awake before a fight broke out between the two. It wouldn’t be the first time it had happen, to say they got along like a house on fire would be a huge overstatement and a complete lie.
As it was they were too busy watching the scene ahead of them to pay much thought to look up.
Sirius argues that Tony would without argument take him in, he adored his little sister and would of done anything for her.
He stops walking, what others? he thinks to himself.
Thor blinked rapidly once more, jolted out of his shock.
In awe of this small teenage boy.
His arm begins to itch.
“Son check for the boy, if he isn’t outside or finished with the chores too bad he will be locked out. His own fault really”
Almost but not quite.
"It keeps the useless midguardians out fine but poses no obstacles to a god, especially one with my such talents and skills"
It’s only ten minutes later but Peter’s sure it’s been hours when another explosion goes off and he’s thrown to the ground clutching at the huge gauntlet in his hands.
At that moment the resident god of thunder made his usual dramatic entrance.
Thor woke with a sudden start, sensing a dark presence looming over him in his bedroom within Avengers Tower. He sat up immediately, summoning his trusty Mjolnir into his hand. Before he could do anything else however, the lights flickered on revealing a tall man with startling bright green eyes. Thor let out a quiet put upon sigh, weirdly or at least, weird for someone who wasn't a norse god from myths and legends, the sight of this male in his room made Thor relax.
“Brother of arms, this must be quick I have something with upmost importance to see to”
With his head held high.
“One would think Stark that saving the world would be more important than whatever party you’re planning.”
“I don’t really know, he was like a father to me I guess he just wanted the company to himself. You know he was the one who arranged for my kidnapping in Afghanistan and the one who conceived your grandparents to give your mum up”
Vernon Dursley was a creature of habit; therefore, his everyday habits were quite easy to predict something that came in quite handy for his nephew. His days always began and ended the exact same way, and it was because of this that Harry found it extremely easy to avoid his uncle and slip out of the house unnoticed when he was supposed to be doing his chores.
"What does that matter?" Thor asked flatly, somewhat concerned.
“You’re body is healing the damage done by you wielding the gauntlet quicker than it’s killing you”
Tony stormed into the briefing room A.k.A the common room to vent his frustrations to the aforementioned Steven Grant Rogers.
And the moment he does he almost regrets it.
That’s how long Peter had been dust for.
At this point Peter’s patience is wearing thin so he argues “but I don’t feel any pain”
With that said, Tony heard some talking going on in the background and heard Ross reply to someone saying “It could be arranged”
“I actually don’t know, never regrown a limb before.” It was at this moment he knew he had
The weird orange place he went after he was dust.
“She speaks. I am sure the trickster can help you find the way if you ask nicely.”
By the time Steve has carried Peter to edge where the compound once stood and laid him down where there’s no longer any debris digging into the poor kid the footage had circulated all on going and active news outlets and by the end of the day it would have been watched by the entire world.
He wonders if his parents would be proud of him, maybe angry, definitely scared.
“How do you know my name” He asks, thinking belatedly that maybe she was thinking of the other Peter, the older one.
“Wow, that’s a lot.” Harry breathed out in slight disbelief.
Peter felt a little weird when he woke up, I mean instinctively he knew he no longer had his left arm even without looking, it was like he was experiencing a lost his body didn’t quite know how to deal with. He was in pain, but not really at the same time, he guesses that’s what phantom pain feels like. When you’re not actually in any pain but your brain is misfiring confusing thinking that you are, so hurt even they injury that supposed to hurting isn’t there anymore
‘Yes, Haraldr is not a common name, it was the only hit sir’
Peter still wants to leave.
What was he the infamous Tony Stark, playboy, philanthropist, billionaire going to do with a baby? He'd never even had a stupid goldfish growing up, what was he going to do with a kid? He could just barely look after himself even then, if he is being honest with himself that was only because of Pepper micro managing his life. Little children especially babies had always made him uncomfortable; they were just so…fragile and dependent. Tony was scared that he would fuck up any child in his life.
Thor just shook his head in response, they had gotten into this argument many times before, he grew tired.
Head held high.
‘Yes sir, shall I alert Miss Potts of your departure’ Friday asked in return, Tony took a moment but thought it best that the less people who knew he was gone the better, hopefully he would be back by tomorrow. He just wanted to check that Harry was alright and then go from there.
He will be an amazing big brother.
"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now..."
Pepper and Steve tell him a press conference needs to happen tomorrow at the latest before too much false information spreads, but Tony doesn’t feel like speaking, like seeing anyone so they compromise the conference will happen but a week from now when Tony is feeling better.
Actually, maybe not Tony thought to himself, Lily might have registered him in the muggle world, he knew after all that she and James marriage is also valid there on her insistence.
“When you’re no longer in pain”
Peter walks up to figure curious.
He was an uncle, Lily was dead, and there was a baby out there that needed him.
“Peter” she’s breathes out.
“I just know, just like you know my name”
So he keeps staring at Peter through the glass window.
Tony was confused, and he had to question why Obadiah would even keep this from him, none of the man’s actions made any sense, after his death Tony had found a box of his stuff and it only led to more questions. He shook himself from his thoughts thinking Obi always just brought back the betrayal that had apparently been going on from the moment he had met the man.
It itches even more, so Peter looks down.
Nor so scared.
Thor grew concerned he knew what that blank face meant, he would not like what came out of his brother's mouth next.
Nor when he sobbed over Gwen’s broken corpse.
For a world renowned genius Tony really wasn’t getting it evidenced as he once again asks “so?”
If anyone would have asked, Mr and Mrs Vernon and Petunia Dursley would exclaim quiet adamantly that they were perfectly normal people with a perfectly normal family, there would be no mention of their quite abnormal nephew and Mrs Dursley’s abnormal sister and brother in law. They would of course also have said that that perfectly normal Wednesday evening was as perfectly normal as all Wednesdays prior. After all, in true Dursley predictable behaviour they had begun the day same as they always do.
Peter lets out a weak laugh at that, it brings a smile to everyone’s face.
“Because you’re in pain”
They turn as Peter comes within touching distance of them, and he knows, he doesn’t know how but he knows that this is the human form of the soul stone.
He plucked out a book of suit material and opened it to a certain page before standing. At Hotchner's nod to approach, Spencer presented the chosen swatch, his hand running over the ebony material.
The vehicle rolled to a halt with a sad wheeze and a heavy, ominous clank. The music flickered and died leaving him in the silence of the deserted street. Tony sat in the darkness, hands gripping the wheel until his knuckles turned white.
Private Isabel "Dizzy" Flores checked her appearance in the reflection of the elevator doors one more time. Her uniform was pressed and perfect, her Mobile Infantry black beret perched neatly on her head.
Anthony scoffed, curling his lip at the very idea of a ransom being paid. The captain quirked a curious eye. “You disagree? You don’t think that your precious hand of Sol will trade for your return? The same self-righteous bastard that sent you over the Unlit Mountains to kill us. To roust us out of our homes and murder us. Is your life just as worthless to him as ours?”
The werewolf moved around the cabin comfortably, leaving Stiles to come in and close the door behind himself . Stiles watched him putter around the kitchen, tugging off his gloves and stuffing them into his jacket pocket.
He gaped open mouthed as Derek climbed in, dressed in head to toe tight black leather, looking like a scowling sex on legs.
God, how was he going to do succeed now? Their funds were already so low. They’d all scraped and scrounged and tightened their belts for this one chance and he’d frittered away a part of it so foolishly.
He kept the cottage tidy. Took care of the cats as he learned learned their moods. He harvested from the overgrown gardens and took gifts of milk, sweet honey, fresh flowers and juicy, fat grubs to the creatures of the great forest. Renewing old truces with the beings that lived in the mist and the magic of such old growth.
He instructed the legionnaire to dig, burying the broken automatons as well as his own armor so that they would not fall into enemy hands. A location beacon would allow them to return at a later date for retrieval.
He faintly heard his names being called and he blinked and tore his eyes away from his moth. Because they couldn't be anyone else's but his really. Black was looking between him and the steed in question with a look of resigned defeat.
The Iron King certainly has no soul mate.
The Witch of the Wood watched the blaze from the trees, the warm strong arms of the werewolf boy, Remus, keeping him steady as his life burned.
He'd ended up becoming the Witch of the Woods the summer of his fourteenth year, just before the leaves turned and the wind got cold. The old woman he'd been apprenticed too had disappeared one day into the deep shadows of the old woods and had left him alone.
"Science later. Rest and Relaxation now."
He'd thought about trying to make a life on earth, as the others had. He'd even tried to settle down on L2 with Hilde and the dream that was a junkyard. But he hadn't been able to stick it through, the siren song of space calling to him before too long. Howard had called it the Fever and  told of men who lived their whole lives without ever touching down on a planetary body.
The Iron King would fight back the darkness as all the previous Iron Kings had done for generations long past. With his holy armour, with his Iron Legions, with the blessing of the great Sol himself, God of the sky and giver of light; he would face it.
Stiles breathed out sharply, his whole body thrumming at the sight. Licking his lips and tasting cherry, he carefully placed the collar around Derek's neck.
He started seeing a therapist, reluctantly at first, but after meeting with the woman recommended but both Seeley and Brenan, he'd made real progress. It was difficult, learning to trust someone with his truths and not trying to cover them with fake smiles and denial, but he pushed through the pain. He wanted, no, he needed to be a better man than he was. For both himself and his partner. He needed to discover who Anthony DiNozzo truly was.
He curled to his side, away from the heat that seemed to surround him. He'd accidentally crashed into one of the burning buildings. Karen's voice rang in his ear as he pushed himself to his knees, urging him to get up and out and reporting that one of the rafters he'd stuck his web too had been rusted through and had given away under his weight.
He wrapped the glowing stone carefully in a bit of his mother's handmade lace and tucked it into his shirt next to his own heart. Scott handed him the bag he'd already packed and hugged him tight.
Ronon wasn't a scholar back on Seteda but he wasn’t open about his level of education either. It helped people underestimate him. It let them speak in front of him without censoring themselves, thinking him no smarter than the wall he was leaning against.
On the back cover she wrote out her list. The plan laid out step by step. She'd memorized it. Knew it top to bottom to top again. Studied it until she could see it when she closed her eyes. Tonight was the night. She was ready. She had it down. It had to be tonight.
He was just contemplating putting on the floor length red stain night gown when a low voice came from beyond the change room door.
He chuckled as the bond between them bloomed fully as he lay a gentle hand on the fur covered head, pouring all the adoration and love he felt into the bond and getting the same in return.
"Oh my little Duckling, this Is going to be so amazing." The happy blonde squealed, pulling Spencer into a tight hug."I knew that when I recommended you that you and Hotch were going to hit it off right away."
Scott nodded sagely. "Yeah, Ally tells me about their court rivalry all the time."
Spike barked a laugh and gave Xander’s spent cock a teasing squeeze before snagging Xander’s gun holster and tugging the brunet towards the small office where their camp beds had been set up.
He'd been back in the Village Hidden in the Leaves for two days already, and had slept for a full twenty hours before feeling human enough again to face other humans. The last mission had been rough. He'd been partnered with Hinata from his old team and an older special Jounin, sent on a special mission to track and kill a missing nin with a high rank in the latest Bingo Book.
He bundled Rodney into the shower, sucking him off and fingering him until the man was lax and pliant against him. Drying him off tenderly, he brought the man to the nest and watched as his expression softened at the sight.
She gave him a shove to shut him up. "Johnny Rico. It's fine. You were out fighting a war. I didn't need you moping around while I picked myself up. I would have clocked you a good one if you'd shown up at my door with that hang dog expression."
He scratched absently at his red triangular cheek mark, nodding at another clan member as they sped by. The street was all but deserted, leading deeper into the woods that Kohonagakure was famous for. Amakamaru turned and wuffed softly before he slipped into the tree line, disappearing from view. Kiba didn't rush to follow, knowing full well where his partner was going.
They looked out unto city for a while, its tall spires of gold and glass gleaming in the eternal gaze of the Sun God Sol. Sol was waning, reaching its lowest zenith in the east. It would never truly set for Sol never removed his gaze from the Sunlight Kingdom, but sometimes he would slide low enough to form antumbra shadows in the west.
Kiba nosed his way down the blond's body, sucking and licking at the points that make his lover gasp and cry out. Naru's scent had changed from his time on the road. That milky sweet of youth had sharpened into a spicy richness that made the back of his mouth water. The kyuubi was closer to the surface, a smokey heat that mixed with the blond's sunlight and citrus.
He nodded, his sheepish smile turning to a frown, placing his flesh hand over hers. "I'm sorry for not visiting you in person. I wanted to but…"
One day, Rodney stalked into the room where Ronon was doing in morning katas and, after stopping and staring at Ronon's naked and sweaty body, had told him to prepare for a trip though the gate in an hour.
Stiles sat up in interest. “So… like some kind of extra sensory perception?”
Weir had ordered  a portion of their supplies to the alpha site as well as some non-essential personnel. They had also sent a message back to earth informing them of the upcoming storm.
The werewolf gave a put upon sigh. “I’m saying that the character has a lot more in common with you than you realized.”
Oh yeah, Gibbs was in a bad mood today.
Satisfied, she tucked the make-up away and stowed her bag behind some storage bins in the small room. The window was easy to prop open and she stepped down unto one of the large dumpster bins that stood right outside.
Warning. SMUT.
He dove away on the last would, making broad strokes to where Teyla lay floating. Ronon blinked a bit as the scientist's playfulness before growling and diving after him.
Tony managed to nod, still a bit too numb to object. He slipped his arms into the sleeves and shrugged the garment on. It was thick enough to be warm but not too heavy and he sighed at the warmth it brought.
#Irondad and #Spiderson
Slim fingers gently ruffled his hair and a kiss was pressed against his brow.
