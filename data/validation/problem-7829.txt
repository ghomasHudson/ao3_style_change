? Like did he have a termination or did 'Giddy' give the babies away?"
like Tony's. But who else could it belong to? He rubbed at his chest. "Ribs? Oh-"
about that- that's how I grew up, that's perfectly normal.  There's trios all over the place, it's not a big deal. I mean, Dad was in one, apparently, (news to me,) but that's not the point. I'm just saying, it's not
"How is this 'normal'? You guys have to have a weird little conference every year because it's the only place where this shit is normal. Even in the forties we could have called this behaviour conservative," Steve said and DeSoto frowned a little like he was only just realising what time Steve was actually from. "And I don't want to beat you up, Jesus Christ. That's the exact
Tony grabbed his phone off his desk.  He wanted to look up honeymoons on Wikipedia real quick, just to make sure they were doing everything right.  And he was going to call Clint, too.  Finding out that Steve's fertility was high had been a nasty little surprise, and Tony wanted to avoid any more.
you are..." said Richards, rolling his eyes.
"...so I guess Steve's gonna be okay," he'd said, softly.  "...and... he can have kids, I guess."
Around three in the morning he looked up to see Tony in the door way. Steve smiled almost bashfully.
"As an artificial intelligence system, that is perhaps the highest compliment you could pay me," replied JARVIS.
Another gaggle was coming over.  A man with dark skin who was wearing sunglasses approached, followed by two men behind him who were actually about as big as Steve was.  Their ringleader, with the sunglasses, was short and an omega, and with his Alpha entourage, he looked positively tiny. But he walked with a swagger that indicated he had no idea.
take it off.  Not without the gantry, which was back at the Expo.  The Mark VI was not self-assembling.
In a few hours' time they would have their answer about Donner, and Tony wanted to point out that perhaps Donner would be okay, that this was only the beginning and in a week or two weeks or a month or something, Donner would come out of his shell and act normally and stop weeping at any mention of his precious "Giddy," who had ruined his life.
to be bonded, but this is
Steve's neck was re-wrapped in cool, fresh bandages.  The nurse told him, gently, that there wasn't much they could do about the pain; they didn't want to use topical anesthetics because the wound had to be allowed to drain, and they couldn't risk making the infection worse, and besides, drugs worked completely differently on Steve because of the serum and now wasn't the time to try to figure out how much morphine to give Captain America.
Well, she certainly wasn't as brilliant as Tony, right?  She couldn't be. No. He was, supposedly, the world's third smartest man alive.  He had to be right. As his number of total encounters approached infinity, each individual encounter approached zero in terms of significance, negating any singular bad thing that had ever happened to him.
"I know. I'm bad, I know. I just-- in my head Bucky always wanted women over me. And Pepper's amazing. She's so great. And I just...sometimes I don't understand how can even compete with that." She was exactly the sort of woman Bucky would bring back to the apartment: fiery, and not afraid to take charge.
Steve was so screwed, probably not in a good way, but he had to try; he had to say
The crowd laughed properly then. Steve turned a little pink, honestly not meaning it like that.  Boswell fondly rolled his eyes with a sigh.
"Nothing's
"Mm," said Tiberius with a short nod.
Tony had long since wired up speakers and intercoms outside so he could yell at JARVIS from the comfort of his pool. The first time the pool maintenance had heard the disembodied voice, it had nearly given them a heart attack.
Steve nodded back and then looked up at Tony's hand on his shoulder just as Banksy got drawn in Pepper and Aria's organizational planning. The touch of the Alpha's hand was warm and grounding. "Yeah, I think some air," he said softly, and reached up to take the hand.  He let Tony lead them out; the others had this; they wouldn't mind if he and Tony disappeared for ten minutes or so.
Tony blinked.  It wasn't him; it was his father.  The loaf of bread was Tony.
It looked
Natasha fell quiet. "The scan will take a while; you should go do something useful," Coulson told her softly.
"Okay, look, this one was
He realized what Steve was trying to say.  He didn't want to mate in the studio, with the drawing on the wall staring at them.
Pepper knew at a glance when Tony had had a rough day, and she could tell Steve was exhausted too, so she took it upon herself and Aria to handle things.  They shooed Steve away, letting him grab his presents and go upstairs, and told him not to worry, they would fix up rooms for Tiberius and Banksy and Donner if they wanted to stay.
Tiberius's nose wrinkled a little.  Even in Steve's time, there were lots of wives' tales about bonding and marriage.  June brides and bonds were considered lucky; if it rained on your bonding day, then your omega was going to be cursed with nothing but girls.  You were supposed to marry when the hands of a clock were going up and bond when the moon was waxing to ensure prosperity. If you bonding while it was waning, you'd be cursed to poverty.  "June brides" and "June omegas" were still enough of a fad for the vast majority of pairs to bond according to the tradition.
what it felt like to be objectified and degraded.
me.  They were glad to get rid of me and I was happy to leave 'cause they were always shoving me around and stuff."
Tony followed Steve into the hotel and they crept up to their room.  The bed was freshly made and the headboard had been replaced already.  There were fresh flowers on the table in the living room. For some reason it all felt very perverse, how neat the room was, and the two of them standing in it after what had just happened.
he knew was dead.
Tony looked back to Steve and linked their arms together.  "She sounds serious.  We'd better go before she unhinges her jaw and swallows you whole.  I need a drink.  C'mon, the simulation's over, it went pretty good, I think... let's just both relax, okay?  ...hey, d'you think this place has karaoke?"
When Tony got accepted to MIT, at the age of fourteen, his father had seemed unsurprised, not impressed, and Tony had gone off to school the next year seething that he
Gleason nodded slowly and looked over to Tony. He could see the tension in the alpha's shoulders. Slowly, the doctor set his bag down.
He wasn't sure if knowing about Bucky beforehand would have even changed anything.
Tony doubted Steve had meant it like that but he let his imagination go wild.
"He's alive. And he's gonna be okay. Look, Clint, he's not in the best of shapes now, but I think it's best you hear his story from him." (He'd said not to mention the rape kit, so Steve wasn't going to.) "We'll be heading home tomorrow or in the next couple of days, and we can bring him back with us."
him..."  Justin's words about controlling his omega were echoing around in his head.  For some reason it bothered him.  It bothered him a lot.
Eric got a look of sympathy.  "Aw. I'm sorry, man. You okay?"
Bucky kept staring.  Now that he was awake, it was all coming back.
"Steve? Steve do you copy?"
From the audience, Clint watched with a grin.  Thanks to Steve’s influence, the party was heavily omegas and omega rights supporters.  It was a nice change of pace from the often Alpha-dominated parties he found himself attending for work.
"Why would you want someone to dress up as slave? Surely they just looked malnourished and sad?" Steve said, not understanding why anyone would dress up as a slave. The name Princess Leia did sound vaguely familiar though.
"Humility isn't a practice I'm especially fond of," answered Tony.  One of his hands was subconsciously running up and down Steve's arm lightly, half-paying attention to the screen of the tablet as Steve browsed the news.  "Besides, I thought we weren't gonna do any interviews 'til our honeymoon period was over.  I'd like to spend a few days with Steve
"Oh, ah, me and Ginny got some tickets to go see a show," said Happy.
Tony stood up, pulling out his wallet and throwing down a few bills on the table without looking.  "Well, let's get it over with.  You're driving," he added.  He got a thrill from knowing that it was killing at least a few Alphas to see an omega driving a two-million-dollar supercar.
want spinach. And even if you do eat some, you'd wake up the next day and be like
of a man's pants."
"Hypothetically, let's say I wanted an omega who was good like DeSoto."
"Give him a break," said Coulson, walking in slowly, toweling his hair.  "He's post-heat. He's probably just exhausted."
"No, Tony."
"I'm bonded.  I don't want him," she added, as if she could hear Tony's thoughts.
"I would suggest getting an omega therapist as soon as possible," David cut in. "What he needs is perspective."
He had gotten used to Dr. Gleason and didn't feel threatened by him.  He wondered if most omegocologists were omegas themselves, and how an Alpha would be able to convince another Alpha to examine an omega while said omega was in heat.  Tony didn't want any other Alphas around Steve, certainly not now.
Steve blinked back to the present. "Maybe another time," he murmured. Two graveyards in one visit would definitely put a downer on the trip. "Pepper said we don't have anything for tomorrow, but stuff the day after. So we can just laze about, whatever you want." He turned to face him and saw Tony's expression. He reached up and brushed dark hair away from the other's eyes.
"If Barnes has made it this far, he can keep going," Clint said. "He has a good skill set. He can look after himself."
He ran his hands over his face. "I need advice...I need to speak to someone who knows how to do this. Jesus Christ, Tony, I only get one shot at this and I cannot screw this up."
Steve was clutching the case to his chest and it had bloody handprints on it.
"...well... uh, I wanted to go to Julliard if I could get a scholarship but it's about forty thousand dollars," said James.  "I mean, I'll probably know by the end of April and then if, uh, if I can't get a scholarship I'll probably just go to the University of California instead and try to transfer halfway through.  My mom's single and so we don't really have the-- sorry, this is probably super boring. Wow, I can't believe I'm talking to Steve Rogers! You're even taller in real life."
"After the fifth or sixth time you catch Tony choking himself with a belt and masturbating, you stop really noticing," said Pepper breezily.
"But you left," returned Tony.
Steve stared down at the table, his mind swimming with doubt. All he could think was that they were right. They'd always been right. Everything that was going wrong. Every weakness they were taking advantage of...it was because of his
That really hadn't been the answer Tony had been hoping to hear.
is terrifying.  When I'm Iron Man, it's just
"Damn." Steve leaned his head against Bucky's metal shoulder, the cool surface helping to sooth his burning hot forehead. He vaguely remembered screaming in the cell, fighting against Bucky when he'd tried to mount him. He remembered that feeling of
"That's impossible.  You dream. You just don't remember it.  Now you'll remember it more, because your mind is healing."
She let him off twenty minutes away from the hotel, close to a subway station so he could go where he wanted.  She knew Steve had a new tracker, but she hadn't told Tony or any of his friends; Steve seemed like he needed a few more hours of privacy.  Natasha being Natasha, she didn't ask why.
No more men with guns.
"Gideon wants Donner back," Steve sighed, heavily. Banksy frowned, moving to hand a hand on Donner's arm. "Though I'm confused as to how he can legally demand that."

about this, more
They stepped out of the copter to see the light of Tony's suit glinting up above them. Steve's gaze followed it around for a second. Natasha pulled out a tablet. "Right. Our three contact points, wires to jennies, are here, here and here-" She pointed to two closer dots, then one much further away.
Tony groaned loudly and dragged his hand down his face.  Steve was sitting across from him, pretending to read his SNL script, even though his eyes weren't moving across the page.
Forget it.  Easier said than done.  Tony wasn't someone who let things go easily.  He couldn't forget.  But he could certainly distract.  He had a psych eval to prepare for, and Steve's birthday, and the Mark VII.
No wonder some people were calling their bond arranged, a political alliance.  Tony didn't think Steve needed to hear about those rumors.  The poor guy looked exhausted.
He was not used to making choices and suddenly there were an infinite number of them before him.  He was utterly lost without his handler's direction.
"How about we go have a bath, yeah?" He asked gingerly. "Then you can call Pepper whilst I reheat the pancakes and make us coffee, and you can eat and drink as much as you think can manage. You only had one drink last night and I'm so proud you for it." The tone of Steve's voice proved he meant it. "Please don't make that all for nothing."
He clicked it on; immediately the HUD was up, the targeting system, and--
"Hi, I'm Iron Man," he said through the helmet.  "Looking for a guy named Steve?"
"Hey.  Tony. He'll be okay," said Natasha with uncharacteristic gentleness.
He made himself feel as angry and sharp as he could, hoping Tony would take the hint.  If he didn't, fine.  Steve could do this all day.
"Are you sure they won't let me call it badassium?  I thought it was typical to name an element after its creator."
Steve watched Phil flit about for a moment. He didn't really understand it. Sure, he'd torn up a few doors but that was to stop himself from doing something he'd regret. Phil seemed to be genuinely invested in his task at hand, arranged the fruit on the counter next and then the packets of pills he'd been given by the doctor. He was focused, not mindless. Steve had been focused when he'd been tearing down a cottage in the south of France in the forties.  Well.  Actually, he'd been out of his goddamn mind.
to feel this, but it was unfamiliar and Tony wished it had an "off" switch.
Steve smiled faintly but it didn't meet his eyes.
"Take my hand."
It was easier to protest the exercise thing than to start panicking.  It was only July.  They had, what, five or six months to figure it out?
"We got enough bedrooms," said Tony, nodding.
Ducky, Amber, and Freak dropped too.
Had Tony been worried they were a thing? The thought was pretty funny. Natasha would have probably eaten Steve alive; Steve found her dominance to be too intense for his liking. They were close, but not like that. Their relationship had a lot of give and take, but statuses never came into it. Natasha kept giving him that
"Having a midlife crisis is hard when you already own, like, eight red convertibles," joked Tony with a small smile.  "...go get Coulson out of here, will you?  I need my beauty sleep."
Отвратительно."  A
"You know exactly how it's going 'cause I'm wearing a wire," growled Rhodey quietly, getting up and walking into the bathroom of the suite for some privacy.
Fred smiled but it didn't quite meet his eyes. "I'm sure."
"No. No, it's something...sweet."
Steve could hear sirens; a police car turned the corner and, not anticipating the jam, slammed into a van, which slammed into the car in front of it.  The staccato of automatic gunfire and the familiar smoky smell was everywhere.  Despite the tall, glinting modern buildings around them and the sleek hybrid cars, this was war, and Steve was familiar with this.
God, he'd been so sexually frustrated.
, he thought.  Because Steve's body seriously didn't feel like it could take the knot and Tony thought there was a distinct possibility he'd wreck himself if he tried to forced it.
...!"
"After our honeymoon is over we'll work out that charity," Steve said. "But like you said- this time is for each other. And I know what's going on outside doesn't make that the easiest thing right now but...but I think we should try. This time is about each other and assholes like Vanko and Hammer won't take that from us, okay?"
Steve was tight from his release, but still soaking wet, and the moment Tony pressed into him, Steve's body responded; Tony pushed the head in, moaning at how smoothly the shaft slid in; beneath him, Steve was whimpering and writhing and had torn a hole into the sheets from clenching them.  "You want my knot?" asked Tony, probing him. "You want it, omega?" He pressed in; Steve's body shuddered, clearly wanting to please.
And his neck was throbbing.
Tony nodded. "Okay.  ...collars on," he said, clearly trying to look nonplussed and failing miserably.
Gideon's eyes darkened a little.  "Don't think I won't kill him to get what I want.  With him waking up twice a year, I could very,
Again, the woman appeared in his field of vision, her mouth still moving wordlessly; Tony shoved her aside.  "STEVE!"  Why was he yelling?  If Steve was responding, he wouldn't have known, anyway.  The ringing was high and tinny and sharp; Tony's mouth was filled with blood; his mind was full of static, a combination of panic and shock.  His only coherent thought was finding Steve.
Did that mean he
"You heard her.  Shoo.  Get out of my house," snarled Tony to Steve.
The heat was gone and left an ache in his bones which just made him want to sleep for days.
glad we don't have to worry about dominance hierarchies!"
"Have you ever had a prostate exam?" asked Dr. Gleason.
"Hi, Mr. Stark?  John Jameson." The man stuck a hand out.  He was extremely dominant; he had a brash New York accent, Queens, Tony suspected.  He had a mustache and pepper-grey hair cut in a style that implied he might, at some point, have been a marine.  There was an unlit cigar in his mouth and, between that and the mustache, Tony was strongly reminded of his father, even though they didn't look very similar.  Maybe it was the dominance thing. John's aura shut both Tony and Malick down in an instant. His was a incredibly powerful, aggressive bearing. "My girls here wanted to meet your omega.  They're fans."
"You gonna make him go on a run, or something?" she asked bemusedly.
Rhodey looked between Steve and Tony and then Aria and sighed. "I thought you were supposed to be the
"I knew he had to come. I told him where I was," Steve replied calmly as Phil pulled the swab out. Then he pulled out a comb to run through his hair. That almost felt nice too. Clint almost smiled at him. "Where is Tony now?"
"...love you, Cap," said Tony.
Tony shut off the speaker comm.  He was hoping that Steve would be able to get out, but if he couldn't at least his announcement would draw most of the guards up there, which would allow Nat and Clint and Sam to do a sweep.  Tony was planning on going up and shooting every last guard as they came out. One of the last people he expected to see was
"Hello, Steve, Tony, Donner..." he greeted them, voice distant, like his was daydreaming.  Tony thought suddenly of how Jarvis's voice had gotten like that, after Dad had died, and his blood chilled again.
to piss us off?"
Natasha rolled her eyes.  “Oh, boy… this is going to be his birthday all over again, isn’t it?”
"Woo, boy," said Mackenzie, pulling out a hashbrown.  "That guy's the worst nester I ever saw. One time--" He turned to Pepper.  "--one time he set up in the middle of SHIELD HQ's lobby, just a big pile of folders and papers and stuff... it was something else.  I'm talking about two or three feet deep, a sort of... well, a nest, literally, nest of all these dossiers and reports, I thought the archivists were going to lose their minds."  He turned back to Sitwell. "That was before your time, I think."
"We can't convince you to stay for a bit?" asked Banksy.
Tony ignored her comment.  "If an Alpha is acting around an omega like the omega is in heat, but the omega
Karpov swore.  "See, this is what I told her would happen!  The programming has to be
Tony ragdolled onto the bed and let Steve undress him. Mentally he was totaling his wins and losses; in total, he had lost $135,000 but had won a car that appeared to be '62 Studebaker, either a Turismo or a Hawk, which had to be worth like, thirty to forty thou... so really, he'd only lost a hundred grand.
?  Please!  Tony can barely even feed himself.  ...where are you, Steve?  And how did you possibly get him to agree to one drink in thirty-six hours?"  Before Steve could answer, she cut herself off.  "Damn it, Hammer's on the other line again.  I'll call later.  Please tell Tony I need him to give a statement about the party he threw and we need to discuss how to fix his home; I have a few contractors on retainer.  And because I know he'll ask, yes, I am, mad.  Furious, in fact.  Good-bye, Steve."
Tony wondered if he meant the Dora Milaje.  "...okay," he said slowly, finally. "I won't intervene.  You have my word. ...but if you change your mind, you know, I really don't mind coming in and--"
Steve ignored her and walked right on out.
to  get in that goddamn place and if you'd been paying attention you'd noticed that Tony collared himself too! Now goddamn let go before I have go in there myself," Steve warned them. He'd thought with enough Alphas already; he didn't want to start fighting with omegas too. "You hit him and yell at him after he spent all weekend dealing with crap from statusist bastards and supporting me? Then you're bad as the rest of them! Now let him
.  Tony could have laughed out loud.  Steve, double-bonded Steve. Steve, whose body hadn't even chosen Tony as his primary Alpha.  Steve, who Tony had been faithful to for almost a year now, his longest-ever stretch of monogamy.  He was jealous! Ha! It was almost laughable.
, he honestly wasn't all that fussed about where that ended up being.
The asset stood beside him, in a long coat, the snow clinging to his hair.
Tony blinked in surprise.  "A half-hour?
Hesitantly, finally, Banjo nodded timidly. "T-there's an old building out the back. They call it the learning annex."
"...yellow?"
Steve needed to apologize.
"Oh, he loved Maria very much, too.  No, there was never any doubt about that.  But it was different, you know. Her being a woman and Edwin being an omega."
"What are you talking about?"
mostly dreamed about girls."
At the front of the room, Steve focused very hard on not looking drunk (whatever that really meant).
!" said Dr. Brennan, looking murderous.
"Captain," said Agent Carter happily, kneeling by Steve with the wire cutters.
Steve turned and stepped into the foyer.  "Somebody! Somebody help!" All eyes turned to him. He felt something warm running down the inside of his thigh and trembled, his stomach spasming again. He was shaking.
"Well, what
Tony flopped onto a stool and put his elbows on the counter without looking at Steve.  "Who's coming?" he demanded.
"Me too.  But no, he's actually rather mild.  Practically beta-like. Maybe that explains Rogers's behavior..."
"The coffee will be ready if people want it," Laura said. "Cooper! Cooper, why don't you let the grown ups have someone alone time for a minute?"
Steve could still remember it. He could remember it like it was yesterday. The burning blue heat from it and the ghoulish light that  blinded his eyes as he was-
"Captain!"
, you know? But this whole relationship, it's not just me anymore.  I've fucked up already, multiple times, and hurt you, and you keep trusting me and putting me in charge like some sort of moron... I'm not good at this, Steve.  I'm not a good Alpha. I try but I keep fucking everything up. I don't really care about hurting myself, but hurting you... that's a whole 'nother plate of tamales.  I just want you to be happy, that's all." He reached out to brush Steve's cheek. The skin there was smooth; Steve probably only shaved once or twice a month and his peach fuzz was light and soft.  Typical omega.
"Someone has to feed you." Steve pointed out, smiling was Tony sipped a half of a sweet strawberry between his lips. "I'm not making you late for anything Tony," he told him with a fond laugh. He leaned on the edge of the doorway, watching the curve of Tony's shoulder blades as he slipped a shirt onto his back. It was his lucky shirt (something he'd picked up during his time as a PA).
"Don't," he growled.
The crowd erupted into delighted screams.
"No, no," agreed Phil distractedly, pushing a t-shirt aside.  He flung a dishrag out of the nest, no longer wanting it, then the box Natasha had given Steve.  A small piece of paper fluttered out of it.
"I'll just sit here trying really hard not to be offended by this," he hummed, half to himself, and Happy shot him a reassuring look.
Steve undid his after he took off Tony's, dropping both collars on the bed. Steve practically sighed in relief when the weight was gone and grimaced as he rubbed at his clammy neck. His eyes widened when he saw Tony's neck, though. It was red at the back. It didn't look good; the skin had gone all puffy. "Oh, Tony.  You are
Bucky shook his head.  The bartender shrugged and went to get a glass for him.
Bucky was here. Steve could smell him, and he was going to find him.
He rolled off her.  He wasn't hard, she tasted wrong, she smelled like nothing.  "I can't," he said, flopping onto his back.
The Winter Soldier seemed to freeze for a brief moment. HYDRA agents were closing in and Fury was bleeding out on the pavement.
He put his arms back around Steve and put his mouth over his neck, still rubbing himself against Steve's wet little slit.  "If you want me, put me in," he whispered against Steve's neck, his words slightly muffled. Tony had every intention of biting down the moment he was inside of Steve; his teeth had already found their grooves.  Tony had grown used to ignoring the other mark. Sometimes, rarely, he'd accidentally try to fit his mouth into the wrong scar, which was a very disconcerting experience. Both his bite-mark and Bucky's were equally present, slightly overlapping each other, giving Steve's mark a weird sort of 3D look, like one mark was the shadow of the other.
Another episode.
He remembered the day Captain America had revealed himself as an omega. Gideon had been quietly furious, frustrated that there was evidently a 'better' version of Donner out there.  And Gideon wanted him. But Stark had gotten there first. Donner had been relieved. Least he couldn't get replaced. Donner was pretty certain he had loved Gideon, or had at least wanted to. And it broke his heart when the other severed the bond. He'd spent over seven years with the man and then he pushed him away... just like that.  Donner had been polite, dutiful, and obedient.  It hadn't paid off and it struck him as very unfair.  He was not used to thinking of anything as unfair (as a breeder, his life wasn't really his own and he had no right to say what was fair to him), but
Steve had hugged Tiberius tightly before they said goodbyes, telling him a sincere thank you.
"I do believe your assistant is going into heat, Miss Potts," Phil said abruptly and Steve shot him a glare.
He poked his head into Steve's studio.  His old arc reactor was glowing from the wall and Steve was sitting beneath it, clutching his phone.  "...hey, Stevie," he said wearily. "...don't worry, they'll leave once they realize it's just us. Come to bed.  ...don't worry about this; he's just trying to mess with us. We'll be in England in a couple of weeks anyway... we kinda need the break, huh?"
Hands in hand, Steve and Tony walked slowly back into the dinner party to mingle.
"Project Eighty-Four is a surprise," Steve and leaned over to kiss Tony's forehead. "You'll see in time."
"Two," confirmed Joey, pointing upwards.
He decided to change the subject.  "Look, I'm drunk, just... forget everything I said, okay?  Scratch it.  Here, give me your laptop.  I just wanna hang out."  He pulled up the command prompt and began typing rapidly, occasionally stumbling over the keys and having to go back to correct errors.  His coordination was shot.  Nonetheless, within minutes there was a download bar on the screen and he was re-configuring half of Steve's settings.  "Welp... okay... you had two Trojans, I got rid of 'em... doesn't look like you've ever defragged, tsk... bam, there's your Wifi, it should be free from now on, you're welcome... I'm going to set up a few proxies so you can browse the internet in private, looks like SHIELD tapped you... asshats... did you know they were monitoring you?... well, they're not anymore... there ya go."  He handed the computer back to Steve, drew his legs up onto the couch, curling up.  "I'm probably gonna fall asleep," he informed Steve, fixing his gaze on the computer screen.  "I'm crashing here tonight.  I'm... I'm pretty wrecked.  Good night, Steve."
Pietro had said there were no hard feelings.
me, I swear to God."
"Captain Rogers, Stark," he said with a nod.
Steve was looking up at him, but Tony's hackles had already risen and anger was coursing through him.  The idea of anyone touching Steve was bad enough, but doing it like that... Tony was instantly alert, ready to fight, his body flooded with adrenaline.
Pepper scowled the nest before turning back to Tony.  "Tony. Speak to me."
Tony promptly leaned over the railing and vomited.  "...oh, shit!  That was... unexpected.  Wow.  Okay," gasped Tony, heaving.  "Sorry, I... I had a few drinks... actually, I feel a lot better now... I'm ready for Round 2..."  He shook himself out, a cold sweat breaking out over his skin.  "...wouldn't be a party if I wasn't getting palladium poisoning!  I mean alcohol poisoning.  Sorry,
"I just... I didn't want anyone to worry," he said, one hand holding Steve's, the other reaching out to begin playing with the wires.  "Look.  Pep.  Take a week for the dust to settle, maybe a few personal days... and then we can talk about Stark Industries, okay?  ...how's our stock?"
"I'll go wherever you wanna go," Steve told him, all those different names not really meaning anything to him in particular.  "And Natasha might not kick your ass... if we don't let on that we just...you know." He was glad the shower hid his blush again. But seriously, Natasha would probably kill Tony. She wanted the best for Steve; it was all in good intentions, but it meant her and Clint got protective pretty quickly.
," hissed Sam.
Tony's knot pushed him to a whole limit that Steve didn't even know he could take. He moaned and he panted as Tony began to fuck into him, his hands moving to curl around his Alpha's shoulders as he moved it closer. Every word Tony spoke was like velvet, his own voice rough with arousal as he took what Steve so very eagerly given.
"You can wear a squirrel suit for all I care."
"Okay. Well, I'll be there. Do I need to bring my shield?" he asked, only half joking.
"Yeah, well, I asked you to match me as a
"Why can't
"To talk about Steve Rogers," said Bucky, somewhat confused by her question.
"I know I'm asking for a lot right now," Steve murmured. "But I just...he's so
His phone beeped with a text. Steve sighed and grabbed his phone, opening it.
"I, er, yeah...it was a couple of years ago," Donner looked at the floor.  “But that was a long time ago. He wouldn’t let another Alpha touch me now.  I’m good. He wouldn’t bet me again.”
"Omega... omega...
It was probably on all the forms the security council made his sign, but Steve still felt he had a right to be offended at the invasion of privacy.
Steve's heart was stammering away in his chest. He felt like he was having a panic attack of some sort, except he wasn't. Tony was.
Pietro sat beside his sister.  Her gaze broke from the television and fell on him.  There was a faint sheen of sweat on his skin. She reached out and pressed the back of her hand to his forehead.
Bucky scrambled to his feet quickly and saluted.  "Colonel Karpov granted me leave, sir, to see the omega, sir."
"Thank you. I...I didn't have anything of all of them."
"It feels like my dad just walked in on us," Steve mumbled as he watched Fury disappear, his cheeks still a little inflamed with embarrassment. He cleared his throat and pushed away from the door.
"He'll be fine after some sleep," confirmed Pepper, who seemed, like Happy, to be thoroughly unconcerned.  Or at least desensitized.
Tony fought to untangle himself from the sheets, still groggy and panicked.  "JARVIS-- JARVIS, shut up, seriously, shut up!" he gasped, kicking the sheets away.
He traced the imprint of the circle with his finger.  "Sorry," he said.  He gave another experimental tug.  Still knotted.  Not that he expected anything different after fifteen seconds.  It didn't feel bad, really.  Actually it felt pretty damn nice.  A sort of added dimension to post-coital cuddling.
Ah, yes.  Aunt Peggy.  Another one of Dad's old pals.  Somehow, Tony had never pictured her as being drop-dead gorgeous.
The pool itself was gorgeous. The tiling was a mix of deep greens and blues, just like the sea, and the pool's edge was arched into an attractive curve. Naturally, the water was warmed. It was appealing and the thought of just floating in the water until all the stress bled out of him was very tempting.
"He was acting very anxious in the car," supplied Rumlow.
older..."
"Steve?  Do you understand that you're going to be taking some levonorgestrel and that that it can cause cramping and dizziness?  I want you to call me if you're having trouble with the side effects," said Gleason.
"This is a reminder. And a promise.  This is a reminder that I'm not going to be a pawn in HYDRA's game. That I never was. And I never will be."
"How can I wear the Cap costume when I've been fired?" Steve deadpanned.
He glanced up to the clock on the wall. "We have twenty five minutes until we need to leave," Steve said, brain accessing quickly. They had time. Just...if they were quick about. He smirked subtly, a mischievous glint in his eyes.
"But..." Steve sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. "What if I-" He paused, finding the right words. "What if I don't
it.  I once got my ear pierced in college but I let it grow back because Obie threatened to kill me and I think he was serious about it.  Sometimes I choke myself with a belt to get off."  Tony took a breath.  "I think you know most of my other dirty secrets.  But let the record show that I've always been honest with you, Steve.  I may be an ass, but I'm an open book.
Irshad was shooing away a waiter with a plate of shrimp; she apparently didn't eat meat, or at least shellfish.  Tony hooked the waiter with his free hand and pulled him over to Steve, who had been tearing through appetizers like they were nothing.  To be fair, with a metabolism four times faster than everyone else's, they would have been nothing even on a day when Steve hadn't eaten.  When he hadn't lost a lot of blood.  When he hadn't been running for his life.
There was a flash and suddenly a blond was standing in front of him.  Tony blinked. "You!"
He rose and sat on the couch in the most dignified way he could, crossing his legs and trying to ignore his erection.
"...Jesus, Tony, that's insane.  I'm putting my foot down," said Pepper.  "No more juice cleanse."
The crook of his left arm got a fierce itch that couldn't be scratched; he flexed the fingers irritably, ignoring the whirring of the gears.
"The trauma... it involved his previous mate," said Pepper, watching Sitwell closely.  Sitwell was gazing at them like a hawk, clearly ready to intervene if she tried to give Gleason too many details.
"You guys met last year, I'm guessing," said Tony.
I'm an omega, and being an Alpha would not make me better if it made me like you."
"Lila, we don't throw food, no matter how funny it is," said Clint.  He looked over at Steve. "Let me tell you, man, having a two-year-old makes the whole secret agent gig seem easy.  So what did Malick want? I'm guessing he wants the status rights crusade to end, huh?"
A = Ω
New plan: get trashed, maybe see if he could have a good aggressive fuck with Steve, and then fall asleep.
"--and he made us go to
bonded," Steve affirmed softly. "I don't remember it happening, for the record. I just...woke up with it," he said, as if he could read Tony's mind. He was always good at filling in the blanks.
"We can't get food right now, Buck," Steve breathed, his gaze eventually drifting over to Bucky. He looked good, or at least, better than he had in the HYDRA base. The serum meant it was hard to tell if someone was really malnourished or not, although Steve did spot bags under his eyes.
"I'll take care of it, boss," said Happy, rising.
"I thought he was smaller," he replied, head rolling.  He couldn't tell anymore if they were talking in English or Russian or something else; he groped for Karpov, wanting to plead for mercy.  He hadn't realized the blond would be so strong.
Thumps weren't uncommon from Steve and Tony's bedroom, but some sense of intuition told Tiberius that this wasn't a regular thump.
"Gross.  I like it," said Tony.  He looked over at Steve, whose ears were pink.  He could feel Steve's tension and he felt a pang of desire for his poor, sweet omega.  "...I..." He dropped his voice, trying to be discreet. "Listen, Clint, I'd be a shit dad.  I had such a shit dad myself, and--"
"He's right," said Pepper.  "Tony,
idea what a huge liability this is for the team?  If your brain thinks it's connected to the Winter Soldier?"
"The serum can't pick glass out of your hand Steve," she pointed out. "Besides," she gestured to Tony in his suit. "you might not have much of a choice in the matter. Also never try and fight a war machine in
, Rogers?  Are you serious?  ...what'd you write?"  He strained to see what was on the pad of paper in Steve's lap.
"Try?"
Steve sighed quietly as Tony pulled him closer, his legs loosely wrapping around the other's hips as he felt Tony's own arousal press up against him. His vision was a little blurry and his eyes were wet as he looked up at Tony. His cheeks were wet too. Had he been... crying? Huh.
Inspiration!
"Stand back," instructed Steve, his voice hard, and before Tony could stop him, he was smashing open the first of the five doors.
Wait, was he shit-talking Howard?  Howard, who had helped make him Captain America in the first place? ...huh. Turned out he was. But in all honesty Steve had never especially liked him. At least, not the way he looked at him.  Like a piece of meat.  The same way he looked at women.  Howard had been a very dominant Alpha and Steve had generally tried to steer clear of him.
Steve's question registered and Tony blinked.  "It-- it tasted fine." He nosed Steve's neck again, baffled.  "You smell... normal. It... it felt completely normal this time."  He looked down at Steve's neck, hopeful.
He looked around and spotted Malick, who was chatting with a tall, dark-haired woman.  There was a blond by his side. Tony blinked; the blond looked remarkably like Steve, if Steve weren't all 'roided up.  That only made the hackle situation worse. Tony wished he'd gelled down his neck; every time the hair rose, the collar pushed it into his neck, giving him an itchy, prickly sensation that was thoroughly unpleasant.  In retrospect, they probably should have tried wearing collars before this, as a test-run; Tony was pretty sure he was going to end up with a rash by the end of the weekend.
"Yes, you are rather interrupting," said Phil.  He pointed to the stairs. "Tony went up."
Tony waved a hand wearily at her and dropped into the seat she had vacated.
A few people around them started clapping and whooping as Tony got onto his knees. No doubt many of them recognised him too. Steve felt oddly breathless. The band looked strange on his hand. Strange, but good. Definitely good. He'd admittedly never expected or predicted this. Marriage felt unnecessary for people who had bonds but this... this was a lovely gesture.
They climbed out of the car on a lower level and the honk of the horn indicating that the car was locked echoed.  Happy flanked them toward the elevators; a young blond Alpha was waiting for them. The pretty nurse who had once lived down the wall from Steve.  Beside her was Agent Maria Hill.  She looked pissed.
Dr. McCloud got that a lot.  There was no malice in Tony's voice, just surprise; it was an unusual position for an omega to hold.
Tony's tongue was hot and intruding in his mouth. Steve whimpered as Tony kissed him and licked into his mouth. He was willing and pliant, just like he should be. The growl the Alpha let out trembled over Steve's skin and the omega moaned in response.
Vanko roared in frustration and Steve took the opportunity. He ran at him again with the shield and smacked it across the helmet's face. Then again. Vanko hissed, the sound muffled from the suit, and reached out to catch Steve's jaw. Steve ducked out of the way and rolled back.
He took Tony's arm and they moved onto the dance floor, slipping through the couples as a new song started. Steve let Tony lead, curling one hand over his shoulder.
Pepper shot Aria a concerned look over her shoulder.
"...Christ, do you ever turn it off?  They're just pretty flowers.  The only people who are being oppressed by them right now are my gardeners."
Tony laughed suddenly, kissing Steve's throat and pulling away.  "Now, where's my coffee?  I wasn't kidding around with Fury, I really do need coffee- I'm like Garfield.  I hate mornings.  ...no, wait.  Mondays.  He hated Mondays.  Never mind.  Do you even know who Garfield is?  The cat that eats lasagna?  Not the president... never mind, Steve.  It's for the best.  Those comics aren't even funny.  So.  Coffee."  He gave Steve an encouraging slap on the ass.
you could do for me, literally the very least, is give me some sort of explanation--"
"Sort of-- no," admitted Trickshot grouchily.  Then, with a touch of pride, he added, "I got shot.  In the back."
Tony's eyes lit up.  "Yeah! That's me!"
He took a quick shower and then dressed in jeans, tee, and a hoodie. Steve couldn't do much to hide one of the bite marks higher up on his neck, but aside from that, the evidence of their previous activities was gone. He pulled the duvet back over Tony before he headed downstairs to find the 'head shrinks.'
Steve wasn't entirely sure who was being made fun of: Sean or him. Either way, he didn't like it. Natasha was right; they should go.
He had rolled off Steve during the night.  He wearily, automatically clambered back on top of him, protectively, nosing his neck affectionately.  "...'mega..." His voice was thick with sleep. Steve winced a little and Tony realized there was a heavy bruise on his neck.  Steve was fair, and bruised easily. Tony nosed him again, gently, an apology for hurting him. Sleep was already dragging him back down.  "They sedated me, huh?" he mumbled, hugging Steve to him. "...love you... sorry, Stevie... gotta sleep... no more fights, 'k? ...I can't always be comin' up from the docks to save you... "  He mumbled something else, in Russian, and then he was out again.
"You should see the other guy," he said to Tony while his omega took a selfie with Steve.
Bucky had a lot of questions.  About their bonding mark and what had happened to it.  About his arm and what had happened to it.  None of them were questions that were easy to answer, but Steve had to at least try.
Steve went quiet again and then said, "I think you're right. I think me and Tricky would have gotten well. He sounds very brave.  Do you wanna sleep on the sofa?" he asked.  He didn't really think he felt like talking with DeSoto anymore. Steve clearly wasn't going to get anywhere and DeSoto clearly thought that Steve was a 'bad' omega, whatever that meant.
political," warned Brent.
Everyone was watching him like he was going to break. It was... weird.
This, Tony was aware, was exactly the sort of scandalous thing that would cause a media frenzy.  This was the sort of thing that was just between them, that couldn't be shared with anyone because it was too intimate.  Steve couldn't be seen like this, as a subservient little omega; he was Captain America, national treasure, living legend.  Something about knowing that, though, made it feel even more intimate to Tony.  He had exclusive access to something no one else ever would.
"I'm not perfect, and I never could be. But that fact doesn't having anything to do with our Alphas treating us with respect.  You know that, right?"
He was dressed in his shirt and boxers now, but that was all. "Hey," Steve murmured as he sat down next to him, placing a hand on Tony's shoulder. "Time to wake up. I got dinner."
Steve looked up at the last thing Tony said, eyes narrowing...although not out of disapproval, more curiosity than anything else. And there was no criticism in his voice either when he asked: "Wait.  You...you
"...how many drinks did you have?" demanded Beth.
Maybe it was the heat but his bond felt all wrong, like an optical illusion where the brain is struggling to see two images.  He was disoriented and dizzy; the lack of food had no doubt caused his blood sugar to crash; if he had had anything to throw up, he certainly would have.
"Is SNL the funny one? I forget their names."
"He was probably drunk," said Maria with annoyance.
"...what about this morning?" asked Tony, lost.
Assuming it got tough, that is.  Hey, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.  Tony was pretty confident he'd compartmentalized the worst of it.  Maybe it wouldn't come out at all.
"...I'll handle him," he reassured Steve, patting his chest.
"No one likes you," hissed Tony to himself while the phone rang.
He felt immediate revulsion, anger, confusion, disorientation.  It was the feeling of running up a flight of dark stairs and thinking there's an extra step and feeling his foot falling through the empty darkness... it was unsettling, horrifying, and staring at it, he felt like he'd just witnessed some great tragedy.
She waved, standing in the doorway until they got into their taxi and the doors were shut. Steve's heart panged in his chest. He was annoyed at Fury for manipulating the whole situation but he was also eternally grateful that he could still see Peggy again in this century.
"...I mean, cars are really just two-dimensional suits on wheels, if you think about it," Tony was explaining on the television.  "Hey, did you know that
Aria kept giving him thumbs-up from behind the scenes, pleased with the quotes they were pulling out of him.
He smiled, hesitantly, and Bucky returned his smile immediately.  Bucky felt more like, well,
"...can I see the thing in your chest?"
"...I... sorta... I do that.  Before... y'know."
"Don't try to find me."  It beeped.
"Please put down a towel," said Pepper hastily as they ducked out of the room.
Steve could feel something was wrong but he didn't question it. He kept their fingers threaded lightly together, leading the way out of the museum for Tony. They said polite goodbyes and exchanged thank yous with the reception on the way out.
thought Tony as he closed one eye and lined up the sight... this wasn't how he'd envisioned spending his anniversary...
Tony felt nothing but relief when Steve stopped and actually listened.  He began swaying in Tony's arms and Tony nuzzled his chest encouragingly.  He hadn't done ecstasy in years and he'd forgotten the incredible rush. Steve's body was warm and solid against his, his smell familiar and amazing.  He touched Steve's cheeks, his arms, his neck, smelling him, tasting him, kissing him. Steve melted beneath the touch and the two of them were soon making out like teenagers.
It was grim but it was the truth. This wasn't personal to Steve, at least...it wasn't mostly. Steve had gotten a lot of omegas in trouble. That was a fact. ...but it still hurt that they were all having a 'slumber party' without him... goddammit. Steve wasn't
Eyes turned to watch Steve making his way across the room.  The auctionees clearly had mixed feelings.; some of them got wide eyes and looked worried, but others broke into grins and giggles.  Of course; they were kids and Steve was the legendary Captain America.
"Mhm. Feels good," Steve hummed and arced up, pressing into touch and seeking out friction. He let out needy little sounds, his hands bunching up in the pillows around his head.
Tony flexed slightly under Steve's hand.  "You have a lot of Alpha friends," he observed.  He looked over Steve's body.  "...I know they're just friends," he added suddenly.  He
Alpha and
MRIs, he'd learned, were loud.
me you were bonded.  You think I wouldn't maybe want to know that before I took you?  You don't think maybe that's the sort of thing your mate's entitled to know?"
"Do you... do you know what year it is?" asked Steve tenatively, wondering how aware Bucky actually was of his surroundings. "Because it's--"
"I'm not in a triad. Next question."
He grabbed Steve's hand and kissed it.  He wondered how aware Steve was of his instinctual drive to nurture.  He wondered if Steve read Dr. Frond's books, if he would start noticing it and fight against it.  Tony liked being pampered. He didn't want Steve to stop. But he also didn't want Steve to turn into some mindless zombie like DeSoto.  He liked Steve being a person, with agency, even though that person woke up obnoxiously early every morning and did yoga and shit.
"We're not wrong.  He's a HYDRA plant.  Let me at him," growled Tony.
biology.  I'm not going to let you go again.  I was stupid to do it in the first place.  ...okay?"
Those were the two worst words he could have imagined hearing.  He kept his gaze steady as he explained what had happened.  There was no way to sugar-coat it.  He was incapable of lying.  The conclusion was simple: he had failed.
"Excellent question! The best position is probably the omega on his or her side and the Alpha behind them. I know it can get uncomfortable but it's important to hold it for as long as you can, even over night! This especially helps with male omegas who struggle with conception more generally. Staying together over night boosts your average chances from around 3% to 15%!"
"Last year I hear some guy lost one point two
Their attention turned back to the range.  Tony looked very much like a civilian; he had thrown on a suit jacket but was wearing a t-shirt underneath and his shoes, clearly worn for comfort, mismatched his slacks.  He took a semi-automatic delicately from one of the sergeants, checked it over, and then fired off a round with surprising ease.
Steve looked back out across the field, watching Natasha duck away from one of Cooper's snowballs. "That's fair," he whispered. "I just, I--"
"No, what?  No!  You're doing great, you're the best.  Isn't she the best, Steve? ...you know I'm honeymooning right now, right?  I don't want to diversify my portfolio or whatever."
"F-Feels so good," Steve stuttered, sweet and breathless as he rode him, his blue eyes darkened with lust and something more. His fingertips were definitely leaving cracks in the wooden headboard (that was no doubt very expensive) but Steve didn't care. This was about Tony and making Tony feel good. That was all that mattered.
"Don't worry," the make up artist winked. "I'll cover that up for you."
"It's sweet," Steve said, his eyes flicking up to Malick's face, his tone completely sincere. "That you think I'm pretty."
"We're okay," Steve said, speech a little slurred still. "Donner's having his baby t-though."
At least it seemed it would be.  Until December rolled around.
Tony studied him carefully.  It was rare indeed that he'd wake up before Steve.  Steve's face was young and unlined and pure and peaceful in sleep.  Practically cherubic. Naked except for the heavy, jeweled collar, he was a living work of art, and Tony felt something not dissimilar to arousal, a sense of fierce pride and possessiveness.  He put his hand over Steve's on his chest, admiring his omega and the quiet stillness of the moment. If Tony were artistically inclined, like Steve, he might have liked to try to draw Steve. But Tony wasn't and anyway, he had a good memory.  He was content to lie there with Steve curled into him, on arm around him protectively, basking in their pair-bond.
The goggles gave them the edge once they were inside. All Steve and Natasha had to do was avoid the occasional flashlight to avoid being spotted. It almost too easy. But Steve knew they didn't have long; some of the guards were almost certainly Alphas and if he lingered too long they would smell him. "Moving into position by the staircase," Steve told Sam softly through the comms. He shared a look with Natasha and a short nod. "Ready when you are Wilson."
"Barnes's stats in cryo went haywire this morning and he's waking up.  That's how we knew we had to come find you. The WSC wants you off the street and under supervision ASAP.  Now come on..."
"...that's great, Steve," said Natasha with a small smile, even though her eyes still looked concerned.  She clearly wanted to ask about the neck situation but didn't feel comfortable. Particularly since she was an Alpha and there were two small children at the table.
think sent them?" Natasha asked, tone cool and composed and calm.
Natasha and Sam pushed him back down.
It seemed like an obvious choice, actually, for the two of them to be on a show with such a rich history.  There was probably a bunch more of it in the file Pepper had dumped on his desk but Tony felt like, having seen the show, he didn't have much to brush up on.
" 'mega," said Tony adoringly, tracing along the rim of Steve's ear before reaching behind it.
Tony couldn't finish.  He crammed his face back into Steve's chest.  He wanted to apologize and ask for forgiveness.  Was this level of guilt normal? It couldn't be... this couldn't be
With that, she hung up.  The room was quiet.  Tony, Steve had already learned, bounced between periods of excessive sleep and periods of no sleep at all.  Currently, with his life running smoothly, he'd crashed, his body trying to make up for the damage of stress it had accumulated over the several months.  Not to mention the palladium poisoning.  The rash around Tony's arc reactor was fading away; soon there would be no trace of it.  It occurred to Steve that he and the other Avengers were the only ones who had ever known that Tony was dying.
"So what are you trying to say?" Steve demanded, hair on the back of his neck prickling up.
Pepper was still holding the folder in front of her eyes.  "You're getting water all over the floor and you're naked.  That's what I think."
"They were," Steve agreed and it felt good to have another omega point it out first. "Also, super boring."
. He let the pad of his thumb brush over Tony's bottom lip. He shivered. "I love you, too." They felt so easy to say, so automatic. But their meaning weighed heavy in the air and a new kind of tension settled over them, but not a bad kind.
. He wasn't sure about anything-- what was he even doing with his life?  He'd spent the morning trying on collars, which had made him feel dirty and disgusting, and now he was wandering alone, trapped between two Alphas.  Some role model he was, so easily knocked down by his mate.  Some "independent omega" he was modeling.  He didn't even have a job anymore.  He was no longer in the army.  He was no longer a SHIELD agent.  And Project 84?  Ha.  Like Project 84 could even work...he was an idiot.
She walked into the living room.  Phil poked his head out. His short hair was as messy as short hair could get, and there were dark circles under his eyes.  He hesitated. "I... not yet. Thanks, Virginia. I'll pull it down later today, maybe." A look of worry crossed his face, and then he said, "...maybe tomorrow.  I'm sorry, I--"
Tony thought it was actually a little funny.  Steve was so against Tony getting drunk or high, and yet he practically had a "pure ecstasy" button planted right on his body.
can change Tony's mind?"
The crowd were insane and they soon recognised who Steve was.
"...Steve's got jealousy issues.  He'd go crazy if I bought an omega in front of him.  I'm looking for someone who maybe, uh... could provide omega services, discreetly."
!  Talk about making the understatement of the century."  He heaved a sigh, looked up, seemed to realize something, and suddenly the mask was back up.
Bucky threw back his shot without any indication that he could taste the cheap vodka.
choice.
come up with that terrible title, you can blame the event coordinator for that one.  I wanted to call it Sex with Rex-- Rex here's my omega, say hi, Rex--" A chipper-looking omega standing behind him waved.  "--but they vetoed that right out the window, so here we are. Is everyone in the right place? If you don't want to hear about sex, you're definitely in the wrong place..."
"I love you, too," Steve murmured after a beat of quiet, nosing against Tony's shoulder as he let his own eyes slip shut for a brief moment. He hummed contently. This is what he'd always imagined a happy pair bond was like- maybe now he actually had it.
"I want a drink," Natasha said dryly and pulled back towards the kitchen area. Phil followed on as the Alpha female moved to raid through a drinks cabinet with a worrying level of comfortableness as she popped open a bottle of dark coloured rum and found some glasses.
likely to happen to you if you walk out of here right now and don't go stand up on that stage in a few hours!  I refused to be sold and I went to college; I took out loans, I worked my ass off, and I bonded to an Alpha I actually
Steve sat next to him, their hands entwined, Tony rubbing his thumb against the back of Steve's hand soothingly.  Steve was avoiding looking at Tony.
"That would be very confrontational," Phil pointed out.
"Scenting?"
Steve gasped.
"So, about Alpha ferality--" began Louis.
When they arrived, the house was already lit up.  Pepper, Aria, Banksy, Tiberius, and Donner were in the living room; Donner was sitting beside Banksy, a blanket over his shoulders, holding a cup of hot chocolate.  Tiberius, as usual, was sitting off to the side. George wasn't present; he had already texted Steve to let him know he didn't expect to be back before midnight and he wouldn't see them until the morning.
Sam tucked his arms in, slipping through the dense foliage of the forest; Tony followed.  They landed with a soft crunch of leaves. There was a discreet electrical box sitting in a chain cage.
"Nothing you'd be willing to do, Captain, I assure you," said Gideon.
"...I'm glad," said Tony quietly.  "...that it means something to you."  He watched Steve tracing the arc reactor, wondering if Steve appreciated that, for Tony, letting anyone touch his chest like this meant a hell of a lot more than sex did.  For Tony, this was the epitome of intimacy. "...I hope you don't regret it. Us bonding. I'm... kind of a jerk, yeah. I mean, devastatingly handsome and staggeringly intelligent, not to mention quick-witted and insanely good in bed... but also a jerk."  He reached up to hold Steve's hand on his chest. "...I think you make me a better person, though."
"How was your meeting?" asked Pepper pleasantly, sitting down in one of the leather seats near the bar.
"I'm not really concerned with the rest of the world right now," Steve murmured quietly.
The moment he said it, he realized what a ridiculous statement it was and he started laughing.  He couldn't help it.  He'd already bitten Steve; he'd left a huge mark on him.  He struggled to stop but the more he thought about what he'd said, the funnier it seemed, the alcohol in his system amping up the hilarity even more.  In seconds, he was laughing so hard he was crying, clinging to his ribs and giggling maniacally.
He tried to instead engage Pepper with a conversation about Wakandan customs.  Pepper showed unbridled enthusiasm for Tony's apparently taking an interest in actually learning something cultural and talked their ear off the entire drive north.
"I guess so."
"Steve is no longer employed by SHIELD and is giving this press release as a show of goodwill and gratitude to you for helping him downplay the Yemen incident.  But Steve doesn't owe you anything as a civilian," said Pepper sharply. "And neither does Tony. This is a favor they're doing as a thanks for your pardon. I doubt the camera's resolution is even strong enough to make out a half-inch pin."
. Shit, he should really go to him. The bond was back, full force, which meant that they were out of the simulation; Steve could feel Tony's anxiety and unease rolling off of him in waves.
bedroom.
"Watch on your phone.  C'mon. Let's get a cappuccino and some fries into you before you pass out."  (Pepper had, after years of dealing with Tony, figured out exactly the right items to cram into him when he was half-drunk to keep him fueled.)
He was so fucking stupid.
He made lunch, set some aside for Tony, and then went through the files that Pepper had left. Steve managed not to wake Tony when he fetched them. He signed and checked everything he was supposed to, then went to go swim in the pool. After that, Steve drew in his room-- filling up a space on one of the walls with another charcoal sketch of Peggy, this time her real, older self. It felt good to acknowledge the lines in her features now. She might be older, but she was just as fierce, perhaps even fiercer.
"You ready?" Steve asked, moving to nudge the bag of gadgetry under a dumpster so they could fetch it later.
"We're great.  I got a sprained ankle, Steve got a couple bruises... but we've got each other.  So we're fine," said Tony, nuzzling his lips against Steve's neck.
Tony forced a smile back.  Gene reminded him slightly of Justin, the way he oozed charm, the way he acted so smooth.  The difference between him and Justin was that Justin
"Yes, but if you want children--"
Tony obeyed, wincing a little when he felt her tap the vein.  He didn't hate needles but he wasn't fond of them, either.
Tony barked out a laugh, nuzzling against Steve's shoulder.  The two of them were both a total mess and they were knotted in a way that meant separation was damned near impossible.
"They don't treat us like dogs," Seven protested.
"For buying a used Alpha!  For tracking down Trickshot!"
"I could do something like that, I think," Steve said.  “An ad campaign sounds swell.” Working
Tony went at his food in his usual manner: scientifically.  Tony's eating habits had long been a source of grief for Pepper.  A decade ago, she had thought Tony's diet was only to annoy her. It was not uncommon for him to call her up at 1 in the morning and demand a tamale, or to suddenly decide to eat nothing but ramen for a week for no reason whatsoever.  Aside from having very specific demands and a very bizarre schedule (or lack of a schedule), Tony had a habit of pulling apart his food. Every omelette, layer cake, and sandwich was subject to inspection, as if he were in a prison cell and desperately hoping someone might slip him a shiv.  On top of that, Tony occasionally went through various healthfood crazes. Every one of his bad eating habits had gotten worse after Afghanistan. The fact that he was neither thin nor fat was nothing short of a miracle.
brilliant!"
"And I'll be right there behind you," said Tony.
"And what's the suit, exactly?"
Maybe she knew that, because Steve had literally never seen her so submissive.  She wasn't even making eye contact with either of them. "Please. Give me the shield.  I can get us out of here."
"I wouldn't be about to tell you, Mr. Stark."
"The trick is to knot them in heat," said Eric wisely.
, Steve thought,
He turned when he finally heard the door opening.  Three people walked in. Rhodey was taken back. He had been told about Donner, yes, but he was still unprepared.  From the neck up, Donner looked
Occasionally, Steve thought about the other agents, the ones who were still active: namely, Clint, a fellow omega.  He went to spend time with Clint and his family in the early spring. And when he came back home to Tony he instantly felt bad for lying. He tried to bring up telling Tony once, with Clint, but he obviously didn't want to. And Steve couldn't make him.
Everyone's attention was on Tony now.
"...Где Steve? Где моя омега?" he demanded.
"Okay," said Tony, staring moodily out the window.  After a moment, he reached over to turn on the radio.  Track one: War Pigs.
"Well then all you have to do is get him to show his true colours. Show Donner what a sleaze-bag Gideon really is," Sam said. It was a good thought but Steve wasn't sure if it would be that simple.
"I don't trust SHIELD anymore."
"Oh my God. Tony, do you even have underpants-- oh!" Steve became distracted when Tiberius handed him the pen and paper. Steve immediately began scribbling something.
The serum had had that effect on people. No one had noticed Steve before - no one except Bucky. He wanted to mother and care for him, sure, but he never
"Hey JARVIS!" he called as he settled down at his work bench, adjusting the desk lamp.  "Can you..."  He hesitated for a split second, then said, "...can you call Barton?  I wanna ask him some quick questions about omegas.  Also, Steve's birthday is coming up, can you look up how much a bald eagle costs?"
"So about this... fundraiser," said Tony, loudly, trying to redirect everyone's attention.
"Tony... Stan is going through his heat," she said gently. "Stan. Your PA, remember? Your employee. You're his boss and you can't do what you want to right now. I know it's hard. I know you're hurting, and so is Stan. But you have to step back and
Someone had said that to him.
"...I asked if you had a pen for the coordinates, Steve," repeated Natasha.  "...are you okay to pilot a plane? I know I've already said this a couple of times, but these coordinates are top-secret, okay?  SHIELD doesn't have them and we'd like to keep it that way. And don't share them with Tony. Literally only a handful of people know this place exists... well, you'll understand when you get here."
"Lots of buddy-buddy photo ops," confirmed Pepper.  "--page three, a list of media coverage, highlighted in
to ask for attention. Jiminy Christmas, Tony. Our relationship isn't a game. Brooke never even would have hit on me in the first place if
Tony glared at Pepper, sucking noisily on the straw and lapsing into silence.  He wanted to argue with Steve about Barnes being his Alpha. Being connected as they were, Tony knew perfectly well that Barnes had loved him, and Steve had loved him, and at least their first bond had been consensual.  Jury was out on the renewed bond.  Steve's constant insistence that Barnes wasn't his Alpha was, in Tony's mind, sour grapes about Barnes's refusal to consummate the bond. But as an Alpha himself, Tony begrudgingly understood where Barnes was coming from.  If he thought banging Steve would hurt him, he'd never be able to do it.
Tony was nowhere to be found.
They got back to the hotel quite late. The suitcase from the night before was tucked under the bed for safe keeping, out of sight.
He leaned forward to kiss Tony firmly but briefly then sat up. "Come on. Let's get going; I bet the others are desperate to get off of this plane, too.  And we really need to book Aria and Pepper that holiday...if we pay for it, then they'll
Tony looked from Steve to Natasha, lost.
The two of them fell asleep together, arms around one another.
"Pietro!" yelled Wanda.
"Sure, I like blackjack," said Tony weakly.  Jameson's mannerism was incredibly disarming.  He fell into step with the other Alpha; Joan and Maria both grabbed onto Steve's arms, beaming.
suit," corrected Rhodey, who knew all too well what Tony was thinking.
He was sitting on a bench in Venice Beach.  Women in bikinis skated past and men on longboards rolled by.  No one paid attention to him.
"Oh, please, you spit most of it out," said Tony.
He had seen what his weapons could do.
One of the consequences of Tony's manic drive was piles of materials strewn all over the place, including on his jet.  One corner, once used as a board room, had been rededicated as an ad-hoc workshop.  It was messy to a degree that an uneducated person might have mistaken the room as a trash heap maintained by a hoarder.  Sheets of metal, hinges, plastic tubing, wires, tools... everything was everywhere and Tony refused to let anyone touch it because he knew exactly where things were and hated when they went missing.
Steve didn't like bullies.
He walked back over to the model and put it back where it had come from, closed one eye, then opened it.  Then closed it.  He brought up his hand, made a circle, and looked through it.
"You'll be whatever you are," said Natasha.  "Eat your breakfast. So, Steve. I heard you met with some bigwig from the World Security Council."
Steve pulled back a fraction, blue eyes mischievous. He almost looked proud of himself. "So yeah. That's how it is for me."
we'll fight," he said, desperately wanting to appeal to the omega.  "Let me take care of you, and
He let out a desperate whine at the thought and squirmed under Happy.
"Look, can you drive?  I want to stay with Steve," said Tony, who remaining flattened over Steve, clinging to him desperately and unwilling to be more than an arm's length away from him.
"I know," Steve breathed. "But
All in all this was turning out to be an excellent day.
"I'm due on the twentieth but it would be fun to have a Christmas baby, I think."
"So we have an hour," Steve reiterated and sighed quietly when Tony pulled his robe down, letting it pool around his right shoulder. The soft drag of Tony's lips was accompanied by the slight scrape of stubble too. Steve hummed softly in approval and let his eyes slip shut.
He threw back one last shot before pushing through the crowd to find Steve entertaining the press.
"Tony, she's a doctor, she just wants to talk to him," said Maria, who had Tony's arms pinned behind his back and was wrestling to keep him under control.
"I already sent it over, remember? You just never check your emails." Steve's voice was quiet, growing distant. Maybe he was wrong- maybe he read it wrong. Maybe him kneeling for Tony didn't mean as much as he'd thought it had.  Tony was so sloppy drunk that Steve doubted he'd remember much of this conversation, or his suggestion that they might be scent-mates.
"Tony," Steve appeared at his side, curling a hand onto his shoulder. James politely backed away. Steve ran his free hand over Tony's gently. Tony's gaze eventually moved to the omega's face but still felt like he wasn't really
it. Please." He was half hard himself already, party due to Tony and partly due to the serum.
"It's tradition," said Rhodes, setting the white orchid next to another one with faint red streaks.  "I thought they told you not to stand on that foot?  I came over to see how you and Steve were doing."
"...JARVIS... scan this model.  Scan it, I need... I need a digital render.  ...Steve.  Steve, look at it.  He made it for me.  Look.  Not the Expo.  The
"You know he's not alive, right?" asked Rhodey.
"He's on his honeymoon with his other mate," snarled Tony acerbically.
Pepper was reading a review aloud: "...
But he was hoping to hold off the cloud of depression for a while yet.
"You called her Aunt Peggy?" Steve asked, his voice a sleepy murmur but the smile was still evident in his tone. "I didn't realise you were that... close. She mentioned you a few times. But I never realised she was an auntie." Steve didn't sound annoyed at being kept out of the loop, rather, pleasantly surprised. "Mhm. A proper England trip would be nice, too... and I already have your birthday present. And no, you can't have it early," he said even before the other could attempt to ask.
"You meant point
"I don't need him to trust me," said Fury in reply, expression hard.  "This team is a last-resort measure for threats to humanity as we know it.  Not a popularity contest."
They both ripped open an envelope together.
The two lapsed into silence again for a moment.
Upstairs, Aria was tearing through Tony's closet like it was a clearance rack.  Steve owned few ties; it didn't matter.  Aria was helping herself to Tony's.
"Fine, fine, fine."
"Fuck!" growled Tony, aiming a kick at the cylinder.
The day had been emotionally draining as it was. A few hours break before dinner might do them good and Steve knew the collar was making Tony uncomfortable; the other kept tugging at it without realising. Steve felt bad. He was kind of the one who put it there.
"Oh fuck- Tony, Tony please...
"You're going to reach
can fucking sleep at night, selling out to the war profiteers like that."
Tony tried to force a smile; he wanted to say something nice, but instead, he blurted, "It's like a real-life horror story, Steve.  ...Eighty-four camp with twenty omegas apiece, that's 1,680 kids 'enrolled' in these programs, being treated worse than animals. And-- and it could've been you.  It could've been
"I kept running away," Trickshot said, sounding rightfully proud.
Tony let his muscles relax a little, still on top of Steve, oblivious to the sweat and semen covering them.  "G'night," he said quietly, resting his head on Steve's chest to listen to his heartbeat.
Steve's hands were shaking as he read the newspaper article. His throat was welling up and his eyes were watering. Fuck. He sniffed and rubbed a hand over his face. He didn't deserve this. They were so good to him. Jesus, he just thought he'd fucked over his entire image as an independent and strong omega. But here they societies were...working together and for him. Something warmed in Steve's chest and he felt incredibly emotional. He looked over to Tony who was still asleep and there was a ghost of a smile on his lips. Maybe...maybe it would be okay.
"W-what?  B-but I'm on a delivery shift, I mean, I can't just-- just--"  The delivery driver faltered. Tony waited impatiently.
Blunt but very true. Even Jane didn't manage to hide her smile.
"How's everyone doing?" Steve asked, glancing around them. He was taller than every single one of them. He shook One's hand when it was offered. "Really? That's sweet." He wondered how One's dad felt now his status was out in the open. If he was still a fan, then kudos to him.
He stared out the window, brooding, on the ride home.  Bucky had loved Steve, despite Steve's insistence he didn't.  Tony wanted to tell him but also didn't.  He was conflicted.  Doing nothing was still making a choice.  But every time he began to reassure Steve, he stopped.  What was the point in trying to validate a relationship that had ended seventy years ago?  Maybe it was better than telling Steve the truth.  Steve didn't need reminded of his old life, the one where he was weak and short and sick and an omega in a world that saw his kind as barely human.
Steve's grip tightened in his hair. "Fine. Then why did you try and take me?"
The voice that snapped him out of it was authoritative.  Tony's eyes snapped up and he met a pair of green ones.  It was Pepper. Pepper in omega form. Pepper in a white doctor's coat.
He held Natasha's gaze briefly and they shared a moment of understanding.
"Wait, wait.  The Winter Soldier sent you tulips?"
"I can crack an egg," protested Tony indignantly.  "...lemme just go get the suit."
"Hey? Did you just 'hey' me, Rogers?" Natasha did not sound impressed. "Are the reports true?"
"Merry Christmas," echoed the soldier vaguely, turning the pack of cigarettes over in his hands.  "...Pietro?"
Tony made a noise of approval as Steve wiggled his hips down; he responded the way he knew Steve wanted, working his fingers into him, interrupting Steve's gasp of pleasure with more kisses.  The two of them found each other's rhythm quickly, automatically syncing up their bodies' movements.
sorry this is happening to you."
Pepper had of course been with him since the day he got back, and the closest they ever got to talking about it was when, after a three-month dry spell after his return, Tony finally got the HIV test results in the mail: negative.  He'd broken down and cried with relief and she had shushed him on the couch, hugging him while he sobbed all over her most recent Saks Fifth Avenue acquisition. It had been a pale yellow with small black dots. For some reason, he remembered that detail vividly.
"Okay, okay, Jesus!"
"...I don't know... probably hundreds, maybe even a thousand.  It's a big event," said Tony, unimpressed with the hotel. "Come on, I think those guys in front of us were heading toward registration.  We can just follow them."
He trailed off.
"Trickshot?!" asked Tony eagerly, pointing to the man.
"No, because your glands aren't ennervated like omegas' are."
be? Steve let out a slow, long breath. He kept his gaze fixed on the window, barely aware of Tony's touch until he kissed his neck.
"Yes, answer, speak, put it on speaker!" he yelled to the phone, which was across the room.
"I-- I told you, I'm eighteen."
"Sure, why not?" said Tony as she pulled out her phone.  "Oh, good, a selfie, I love selfies... say world peace..."
"Oh. And Malick sent Tony this," Aria said and chucked an envelope across the table. It was personalized stationery. "Well, he sent it to
Aria was positively fuming, her hands curled up tightly in her lap. Whilst she was a beta, she understood in her own way. She'd been adopted by two omega women when she was just a toddler. She'd gotten a lot of shit for having two omega mothers at school and her parents had suffered even worse at work.
He went to bed, curling up in the sheets in Tony's robe still. It was strange...going to sleep by himself for a change. The bed was a little cold. But Steve had been up since six and soon sleep was tugging at his bones.
"I got shot," Steve said. Gleason blinked.
Tony's mouth was hot and wet against his neck. Fortunately no 'flash backs' came to mind. There was no hazy memory trying to push its way through. It was just him and Tony. They were alone. Steve was here for him.
"I want to get back to work on the MARK VII, the non-gantry armor," said Tony.  "Can you pull up the specs and throw me a 3D render of what I had so far, Jarv?"
Steve had no idea what Tony was talking about with the girl, he was just glad it was stopping her from trying to seduce them. He was very weirded out by the whole experience. He was expecting to see miserable omegas, who were desperate to leave. But she had been confident, almost peachy. She had seemed, well, very much for it.  Then again, who knew what she'd been through.  If HYDRA could brainwash Bucky the way they had, why couldn't Athena be brainwashed, too?
"Hey Fletch.  He can't walk either anymore," said Vim to Tony.
"...fine," said Tony quickly. "Replaced the palladium cores with a badassium one and everything's good now.  Don't worry about it.  It's none of your business.  ...lemme go get a towel."
"I lied about who I was," Steve said quietly.
He sighed, throwing back his whiskey and ordering a second before wandered off toward the central area of the lobby.
"None taken."
Tony closed his eyes, enjoying the soft trace of Steve's fingers on his goatee and jaw.  "I dunno.. mushy stuff.  Share a malt, drive Dad's jalopy up to Make-Out Point... you know... mushy stuff."  He laughed.  "Steve, we can do anything we want.  I'm Tony fucking Stark, beloved billionaire, and you're Captain America, national treasure and civil rights leader.  Seriously, the entire world is our playground.  Pick whatever date you want and we can make it happen.  My only rule is nothing with horses.  I played polo once, and dear God, never again.  Whoever thought it was smart to get on top of a two thousand pound animal and try to boss it around must have had a head injury.  ...they probably got kicked in the head by a horse."
Clint cleared his throat.  He finally managed to put Lila down on the floor; she wobbled off quickly to hug the dog, who was stalking after Cooper in the clear hope that there was more food on the plates.
"Look at him!  Look at him, he's obviously guilty!" said Tony, slamming a fist against the glass hard enough to produce a bang that caused Jasper to jump in his seat.
"I think...I think..." Steve whispered, frowning.  He suddenly felt imminently about to pass out.  He felt sick but sleepy, overwhelmingly so.  And it was not a natural seepiness.
He didn't know what Steve was about to say but he could guess and it turned his stomach.  Bucky, that fucking specter in their life. The one that Steve loved and also wanted to kill... Tony remembered, vaguely, promising Steve to kill him during Steve's heat.  Now he didn't know. Bucky sounded like a very broken individual. Worse, Tony was bonded to him by proxy, and worse still, Tony knew he loved Steve and that, deep down, Steve loved him back.  Or at least, loved whatever was left of him, which didn't sound like much.
He reached between them to stroke Steve's erection, nuzzling his neck, trying to give him some comfort even though he knew Steve only wanted one thing.
"I only got shot once--"
"The note that follows soh," explained Tony.
Tony nodded.
"Linda Trinity;
"...the first part," clarified Tony awkwardly.  "...but I swear," he added hastily, "I'm like, completely aware of how fucked up that is and you know I think of us as equals and I would never degrade you like that.  I'm behind you all the way with this whole omega rights thing. It was just a... you know, a weird fluke, I don't know, it just sort of... reminded me about... you know, my childhood, I mean, when I went through puberty, there were still lots of collared omegas and... and you know... but obviously it wasn't, like, a conscious choice to be turned on by that and I'm not going to think about it any more.   I'm sorry, Steve. I seriously feel like more of an asshole than usual for that. Sometimes my brain just goes weird places. Especially when I'm horny." The last part was perfectly true. When you're a billionaire, you get to try out a lot of avant-garde sexual past times, and Tony had had his fair share of kinky sex, especially in the nineties, when he dabbled in coke. Looking back on it, Tony was surprised at how mellow his life had become, even
"It's nice to meet you too... Mr. Rogers.  I mean, Capt--"
"There were auctions everywhere in the forties but I never would have ended up on one. I wasn't the kind of guy you would bet over," Steve said. "That's the thing- Alphas can sleep with whoever they want before they get to us. Why does it matter if an omega's had an alpha before? It shouldn't. Your Alpha got to move onto you. It's not right that Trickshot couldn't make nice, just you like he has now."
"I'm not hump-- oh, I'll be damned, I am."
"Hello," he greeted her, sitting down at a table in the brightly lit coffee shop.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Tony.  I told Natasha because she's my friend.  And she knew anyway because it was in my files.  And I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed, because I- I was scared you wouldn't want me.  I thought he was dead.  I thought it was
"...well that's... that's not how you'd name a sandwich," he said awkwardly, certain Pepper had once explained this to him.  "It would be a
Tony felt weird, being the responsible one, lecturing Steve.  The truth was, neither of them was especially responsible. Sure, Steve worked out and ate healthy and stuff... but he also was more likely than Tony to get into brawls.  Steve was a soldier and he often reacted physically without thinking. Without Pepper or Aria, both of them were, in their own way, loose cannons.
Banksy sat rigidly, leaning forward, hands clasped as if in prayer.
he thought grouchily.
"Yeah, I watched
"Oh, no, not
"Careful," Wendy said to Steve. "Assholes like will try and get a photo of your neck."
Upstairs, Tony rolled into a warm spot in the bed, an indent left by Steve.  He took a deep breath of the sheets, basking in Steve; he opened his eyes groggily.
"Stone was just telling us about the conversion camps," Phil said to Happy patiently. "About how they're still an issue. And incredibly un-humanitarian."
Tony felt a stab of panic.  The dreaded "c" word- commitment.  God, he hoped that word didn't come up in an interview.  He forced his worries out of his mind.  They could deal with those tricky questions in the future; their bond was still so new and shiny.  Tony didn't
Steve leaned down to kiss his forehead, knowing Tony would sleep best without Steve there wake him. "Sleep well Tony," he murmured against him before he pulled up and away. He got dressed before heading downstairs to find his... therapist. Did she just let herself in?
Donner's eyes widened.  "
"You ever want kids, Clint?" asked Tony suddenly.  He knew Clint and Natasha had bonded in unusual circumstances, one not dissimilar to his and Steve's.  They were scent-mates, compatible on an instinctual level, but biologically infertile. It was nearly impossible for omega men to impregnate Alpha women, and, of course, Alpha females had no way of breeding an omega for whelps.
"Oh Jesus," muttered Aria as she crossed the wide, open living room (still covered in orchids) and peered into the kitchen.
"Steve hasn't even gotten a drink yet," said Arcadia, pulling Steve's arm.
Tony looked over at Steve, accusingly.  "Tell her. Tell her. Show her your neck."  Tony was
"Let it out, Donnie!" said Banksy, gripping his other hand.  He cringed. "Oh-- oh, shit, Donnie, that's a hell of a grip."
"Shut
"Did something trigger it?" Sitwell asked curiously.
Tony didn't stop even after he came, still enjoying the sensation, still wanting more, Steve's pheromones hijacking his body.  Anyways, he might as well keep going; they were knotted, Steve's body hot and tight around him. He wasn't going anywhere for at least thirty--
was too serious but
!  What about your
"Carter," she corrected.
?  Worse, it was embarrassing to know that Phil knew and, by extension, probably a dozen SHIELD agents.  In Steve's time, heats had been a private thing.  He was at least grateful for the privacy of the small cabin in the back of the plane.  Pepper had agreed to distract Tony.
.  The idea of being Steve's dirty little secret hurt him.  Tony wanted
"Oh... Steve..." moaned Tony, reached out to his his hands on his hips.  He looked up, heavy-lidded, at his omega, and smiled.  "Ride it?" he suggested hopefully, writhing under Steve.  He could feel the strain of his knot against Steve's body, and the wetness of his body; his muscles were all taut with sexual tension.
Tony's expression, one of bewilderment, changed to one of devastation, followed rapidly by determined annoyance.  "Well, I don't give a fuck, Steve doesn't need a fuckin' handler anyway." He settled back into the lounge chair, pouting.
Steve pursed his lips.  "And please, don't describe a ten hour car drive as 'hanging out'. Do you know what it's like to not pee for over ten hours? It's horrible.  And...and I don't expect you to be cool with it. The whole shit situation is massively shitty. I'm not trying to rub your nose in anything. But it
A beta woman appeared, trailed by a little girl in pigtails.  "Clint! Why didn't you tell me Steve had arrived? I've been in the kitchen for the last hour making French toast... how long has he been here?  Hi, Steve." She pulled him into a hug, apparently not noticing his shock. "It's so good to finally meet you." The little girl grabbed her leg and pressed her face into her mother's jeans, suddenly shy in the presence of a stranger.
, that meant his Alpha wasn't going anywhere, right?
Tony threw back the rest of his whiskey.  "May I have this dance, Rogers?" he asked, still grinning.  Wait, who the hell was supposed to lead? Tony was shorter but also an Alpha, but Steve was Captain America and... oh, hell.
He settled with jeans, a blue shirt and a black sweater. Smart but casual.
Sam looked at Steve.  "He doesn't know?"
Aria and Mackenzie both looked surprised at this information.
Tony put up his hands, too.  He didn't hear Rhodey's words, just saw the hands go up, a small, glowing RT node in each palm.  Two repulsors.  Each with the power of a small jet engine.
"Who's picking us up?" asked Tony, pulling off the covers and stretching himself out.  He ruffled Steve's hair before realizing Steve was already in uniform. He looked over it critically and felt a little better.  Kevlar, Nomex... Tony was familiar with these materials and he was glad Steve was wearing them. If he got shot at, he wouldn't die.  Knowing Steve, probably wouldn't even bruise much. For some reason, he'd pictured Steve in jeans and a plain white t-shirt... maybe because that's how Steve dressed, that's how he'd burst into the White House.  Tony had forgotten all about the Captain America get-up. It was reassuring to see him in something appropriate for fighting.
it affected our relationship?"
"I made Tequila sunrises," said Banksy, pointing to a drink on the table.  From the looks of things, he'd already had a couple himself. Banksy was still absolutely stunning, but he looked like he was a bit worse for the wear after talking to Donner all night.
ma was single. I always wanted to go to art college but I could never have afforded to; I got in for a year and that was it. Omegas would have never got scholarships back in my day," Steve smiled a little. He moved back to look at Tony, who looked marginally better.  "They didn't even let us in to most colleges.  The one I went to was... well... it wasn't really a good school.  Not like Julliard."
"...Steve?"
"Is DeSoto okay?"
"Now, I don't want to talk about Howard, or SHIELD. They're the reasons why we met and why we're here, sure. But that's where it ends," Steve said, words careful as he dropped a tea bag into his mug. "I'm Captain America, but that's not... that's not all I am, you know?"
Tony leaned his elbows on the counter, watching Steve move around the kitchen.  Again, the dichotomy.  Steve was huge, muscular, powerful... But barefoot in the kitchen, wearing only a loose t-shirt, making Tony breakfast, he seemed like such a normal, archetypal omega.  Tony sipped his coffee, black, studying Steve's movements admiringly.
Steve abruptly sat up and Pepper yelled in surprise.
"Snowboarding," corrected Steve.
Steve listened to the radio quietly and leaned his head against the window. He watched the scenery pass by and sighed, his eyes slipping shut for a brief moment. "I...I think it's time for a second interview," he whispered and something akin to nerves coiled up in his gut.
"Hey!" barked the bartender.  "You sit your ass down! You wanna fight, you take it outside."
Tony rolled over and vomited, suddenly aware that he was breathing fast and shallow.  He was having a panic attack. It had come on suddenly and he suddenly had a very good answer to Steve's question about why he'd gotten drunk, but Steve had already left, and Tony was feeling too weak and shaky to go find him.  He rolled off the cot (happily on the opposite side of the one he'd vomited on) and then slithered under the cot, curling into the dirt. He could handle dirt. But the cot, no. He cot reminded him too much of the one he'd sat on in Jalalabad in a medical tent, straining to breathe through sore, cracked ribs, his emotions a confused mess of mourning and jubilation.  He had made it. He was alive. But Yinsen wasn't. And who knew how long his arc reactor would hold for. And who knew if he'd ended up with AIDS or something. And besides, destroying one little outpost in the middle of nowhere didn't fix that his weapons were probably distributed far and wide, in hundreds or even thousands of other caves, ones that might as well have been run by him personally, because they had his name stamped all over the place: STARK.  STARK. STARK.
.  Haven't you ever seen a charity auction where you get a date with someone?"
Maria remained small, hands clasped non-threateningly on the countertop.
Rhodey stood over him for a pregnant moment.  "When you get your head screwed on straight, call me."  With that, Rhodes turned and with a few heavy, clunking steps, stumbled out of a shattered window into the night.  The crowd in the driveway parted for him.  There was the loud roar of an engine and then a streak of light across the sky.  The jets on the suit moved north-east, a shooting star in the velvet-dark sky.
Steve nodded at the kind sentiment with a small smile. "Thank you. I appreciate that."
"Then why the hell would I put myself back in there?" Steve asked, sounding impatient again as he raised a brow.
The door to the lounge was plain, heavy wood.  Tony grabbed it and yanked but it rattled.
"How are you doing?" Pepper asked softly.
Steve kept popping grapes between Tony's lips before he finally reached for an apple and a knife and started to slice that too.
a home anymore," Steve murmured. Not like that anyway. Did he have a home with Tony? Right now it didn't feel like it. He thought back to his room full of drawings, his own private space, his studio... that should have been evidence that Tony's mansion was his home.  But then there were all those sketchbooks in his drawers where he had to hide all his pictures of Bucky. Because if Tony had seen them he would have freaked.  Was it really his home if he was keeping secrets in it like that?
He texted Aria.

The witch smiled at the doubters muttering behind her and clicked her fingers in front of Steve's eyes. There was a whisp of red that fluttered in the air. It glittered. It was almost pretty.  But dangerous.  Like a flame.

He turned around; Sam was nudging one of the guards.  "I think you killed him."
"...my knot," mumbled Tony with a vague gesture.  Then, with renewed confidence, stated, "...it's basically hamburger meat at this point."
Fury looked unfazed, but he pushed off the counter.  Tony could feel himself getting defensive, his muscles tensing.  His earlier desire to beat someone up to demonstrate his strength to Steve was coming to the surface again.
"Until I say so," said Fury.

"I'm going for a
"...I'm sure you would," said Malick bitingly.
Tony cast a helpless look at Steve.
"Even with your metabolism, we could keep you going without any food for weeks, I'm sure."
"Tell him I'm sorta busy working on my Nobel Prize."
Tony dropped the letter into the growing pile in front of him.
Tony grabbed the phone and went to the bar and grabbed Steve a bottle of water, too, offering it to him.
"Steve Rogers! Hi! I was wondering if I could ask a few questions."
The asset listened to him ramble, feeling utterly lost.
.   Steve caught himself.
"I always thought you were an Alpha, though," Nate said a little uselessly.
"Do you either of you have any idea what you're looking for?" Lydia said, "or have you come in with an open mind?"
"How are you two feeling?"
"Well, I'm not," he said, clearly annoyed.  "Sera and I are s'posed to be honeymooning."
"I don't think he really feels fear like we do," said Pietro quietly.  "Don't take it personally. He doesn't know what's going on."
"You know...I'm technically only five years older than her, in my head." Steve pointed out, smiling at Tony's almost hysterical amusement. He didn't think about it much... but really he was only 26 in his head. And yet it was strange waking up in an era that had moved on without him. He didn't feel like the 'youth,' that was for sure. No, Steve's head was left in a state of confusion. He felt too old and too young for everything simultaneously. It was like feeling lost.
Awkwardly, they eventually managed to peel away the pair from each other. Maria made sure not to get too close to Tony as she followed him back out into the kitchen. Steve offered his mate a weak smile when he seemed reluctant to leave. When they were finally alone, Phil let out a long exhale.
He caught a random series of buses before he got off to find a hotel nearby. He chose another dingy sort of place, kept it cheap. The woman at the desk eyed Steve warily. He rubbed at the back of his neck. It itched. It felt strange… Steve didn't know why.
"...no thank you."
"They'll be here in twenty minutes," Pepper said, checking her phone. "Rhodey said he's agreed to come."
"It is appreciated," said T'Chaka.  "I wished to see you, in person, to tell you that I do not hold you accountable... I know that your weapons were never sold to our troubled neighbors, and that you have, in recent years, stopped their development and production."
"I have your singer lined up for tomorrow. They're arriving at nine," Aria said, walking into the kitchen, her eyes bright. "You should be excited. She's

caught the edge of the roof. He scrabbled for purchase, his hands slippery with snow. He didn't need to look down to know how far the drop went. "Fuck. Oh my God. Come on. Come on! Goddammit!" he grunted as he pulled himself up onto the roof, his ankle throbbing. Fuck. He was fucked. Steve had under estimated this; he didn't think they would send the witch. Why didn't he goddamn think?!
"You read that piece of garbage?" asked Aria.
Enjoy this chapter, with more smut than ever, plus the answers to such questions as, "How long can Steve hold his breath?" and "Is Steve circumcised?" and "What does Tony think about #stony?"
"C'mon... sit down, we'll talk this over when you're less freaked out..." said Tony.  He led Steve over to the couch and sat him down.
Outside the conference room, faintly, an alarm began to sound.  Bucky cocked his head, listening. A breach?
He put his head in his hands, too tired to go on.  "I'm going to nap now," he said in a small voice. "Can I stay here, Steve?  Do you mind if I keep sitting with you? ...you don't have to take me back, I'm a terrible Alpha, I just... you have no idea, I'm so glad you're alive."
The tech heaved a world-weary sigh and made toward the door to the observation room.
Steve could have kissed the stupid program.  "Yeah!  ...yeah.  Read the report out loud to him.  Tony, this is what I wrote after two weeks of observation--"
Steve's smell was all wrong and his words weren't exactly reassuring.  What fight were they winning, exactly?  What was Steve talking about, letting people get to them?  Everyone loved them.  Their bond was a national sensation.  Iron Man and Captain America, two beloved, not to mention good-looking heroes... maybe this was just Steve's weird omega paranoia.  Growing up in the forties, he sometimes said things that reminded Tony of just how differently omegas were treated.
"I'm-- I'm going to die," he announced, shaking uncontrollably.  His chest was searing with pain.  "I'm going to die!" he repeated, voice higher.  "Oh God, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, oh God--"  His panic was making the pain worse.  It was excruciating; he wanted to vomit; there was the smell of something burning, something meaty, something that made his mouth water.  Tony realized it was coming from him and his stomach flipped; he squeezed his eyes shut tighter, shuddering, wrapped around the car battery, the one whose wires disappeared into the stained bandage around his chest.
Steve swatted them off, practically wading toward the exit.
, he wrote.
On the other hand, heats were already terrible. Remembering to take all the meds and dealing with the risk of pregnancy wasn't fun... especially considering the fact that Steve almost definitely couldn't cope with the emotional side of an abortion.
When he arrived at Tony's mansion, however, Tony himself was nowhere to be found, and according to JARVIS, he was in his shop and did not want to be bothered, not even if the house was on fire.
His hand sought Steve's and he found it, gripping him.
Happy grinned a little.
"He is when he's just with me. Or... right enough. He thinks it's the forties, that the war has just ended." His voice caught a little as he spoke. Steve was trying to hold it together in front of these people but it wasn't easy. Phil came to stand next to him. Their elbows brushed.
Tony groaned softly and pulled the blankets over his head.  The room reeked like sex and sweat. He made no motion to get up.
"I know.  I got an assault charge today.  Is Lowenstein on it?"
Pepper, Aria, and Jeanette walked over.  Despite being betas, all three could immediately sense the tension in the air.
"Oh, God, if we can just let Tony and Chloe and Arcadia to have a chat and kill Tony's faux pas from earlier, I would be in heaven," said Pepper.  "Steve. Drink some water, we need your voice in perfect working order. Tony. Come over here, get out of the way--"
"Is this good?" he asked.  "...where are we going? Steve?"  He bounced a little on the balls of his feet, having already thrown on socks and a pair of worn Pumas.
, squirming a little at the touch as his breath hitched. He moaned quietly and it was a longing, almost sweet sound.
Silence fell again, thick, oppressing.
"Try to drink some water," offered Pietro.
"I've been trying to get your attention for like a minute.  Did you get lost in there?" asked Morgan, pointing to his head.
?" Steve asked with a playful smile hinting on his lips, his French accent far superior to his Russian one.
"Yes," Nick said plainly. "You did. I'll be going now, Captain.  Please try to behave."
His mood improved noticeably when they got to the hotel, though.  The Langham had been a good choice; the building was old, had probably been around in Steve's time, but the interior was thoroughly modern, with sleek white-and-black minimalism, as if Tony himself had designed it.  They'd barely gotten out of the car, a tinted-window SUV, when the concierge rushed over to meet them and take their bags and ask about their flight.
The omegas were all staring at Steve with huge eyes.  Except for Lola, who was watching Steph and Hal. "...I think you just got Hal kicked out," she reported.
"No," he assured him. "I don't mind."
He didn't like Bucky, not a bit.  But Tony understood they'd done something terrible to him.  And that, however much he considered Bucky a rival, Bucky still hadn't deserved that.
Tony stared at her, not knowing how to respond.  After a moment, he said, uncomfortable, "Yeah, well... I am."
Tony noted, with interest, one bottle was intact.  He wrestled with the top of it, not caring what kind of liquor it was, as long as it would keep him numb, keep his world rocking, keep his misery at an arm's length.
, then you should have done something.
A woman walked in to the room, a short, heavy, dark-haired omega who was polishing a silver candlestick.  "Yes, Mr. Stark?"
There was many more that all continued on with the same sort of tone.
When Steve woke up again it was about two in the afternoon. He got out of bed, devoured half of a fruit bowl, then went to go shower. He took his time and used peach scented shower gel that was almost
"Aww... sorry everyone, sorry... Stan's right, the party's over... all good things must come to an end..." said Tony in the mic, as the crowd protested.  "No, I'm sorry, he's right, this party's over... I've been over it for like, an hour..."  He flashed a grin.  "...but the
That shut him up. Steve wrapped a sheet around Trickshot's shoulders and then lifted him up in his arms.
Tony shoved the bottle of pills at him.  "Take one," he managed. He wanted to feel panic but it was impossible to feel anything except for the desire to mate.  There were no other Alphas, no threats, and Tony's aggression was being channeled into lust, a desire to mate Steve, to

to be nervous," Aria told him, fixing his hair. She was wearing dark red eyeliner today that made her hazel eyes pop.
Once they got the press off their backs, Tony wanted to slip back into their domestic routine.  Work in the shop, on his suit and his cars, safe in his isolation.  He was glad he had a home gym; he didn't want Steve leaving again.  He knew he was being paranoid, but his paranoia was perfectly reasonable, in his opinion.  The thought that Steve had left the house and that Tony might have never seen him again made his blood curdle.  He needed to get back to the safety of their day-to-day life.  And even though he knew that Steve was very likely itching to go do field work for SHIELD, he was willing to bet that SHIELD wasn't planning on sending him anywhere anytime soon... not after seeing how badly HYDRA wanted him.
When Tony began licking at him, mouthing at where he was stretched over the toy, Steve cried out, his whole body going tense as he trembled with a sweet kind of pleasure. "Fuck. Tony. O-oh my God.  Fuck, yes, fuck--"  When Tony pressed the knot in, too, Steve practically wailed, his cock hard and leaking against his abdomen. He whimpered loudly, his blue eyes glazed over and focused on nothing. Steve rocked back on the toy with small undulations of his hips. "A-alpha...please..."
It was a collection of picture frames made out of pieces of wood, all of them entwined together to create five separate frames. Each held a drawing Steve had done. The sketches were light and happy, not weighed down with heavy shading and thick lines. You had to look closely to see the details. You had to really
"Anything, Tony?"
"JARVIS?" he asked, a crack of uneasiness in his house.
Speaking of fetishes...
Donner shook his head, not speaking.
The dog was adorable. And Steve reached out to scratch between his ears before the dog was lured away by more toast. When Clint said they were practically family Steve's head shot up and Clint caught his gaze, offering him a small smile.
"There was red mist in the air around her. Her eyes glowed. She was the one who did it. They kept calling her a witch. And she had the same eyes as the fast one we found in the HYDRA base before. From the reports."
"Steve--" Sharon put a hand on his arm.
"Yeah, thought I would give myself a break.  You know omegas, always being all helpful and everything," said Tony sarcastically.
It was the same look she gave him when Steve walked back from the camp with an arm slung around Bucky, the man half dead from whatever Zola had done to him, but still breathing.
Steve looked lost.
of normal sex.  ...and a lot of abnormal sex.  But that.  That was insane.  Maybe because of the serum...?"
"I'll get it.  I have a gift card my sister gave me.  No biggie." Cece got him a coffee. Bucky sipped it gratefully, still shivering.  "So," said Cece, stirring her coffee. "Why did you ask me out?"
Donner didn't raise his eyes, but added to Hal's comment: "They don't have any Alphas to get mad at them, yet."
"Tony," Steve said, voice low as his hands fisted in the sheets. "I want you to fuck me."
"Please stop calling it a visit," Steve mumbled. He visited Peggy. He visited Natasha and Clint. He didn't visit people and then put people into cryo cells.

?" repeated Tony, face splitting into a grin.  "...your nickname for Clint is
was wearing a collar, just for him, his knot throbbed again.  He was beginning to think that they were going to be stuck for longer than a half-hour, this time.
Okay, yes.  Tony had seen that.  In fact, he'd participated in them before.  The whole raffling or auctioning off a date with an eligible bachelor or bachelorette was, technically, legal.
Steve
. Tony knew he was going stir crazy inside the house as it was. The only thing getting him out at the moment was interviews and jogging; it was September and the only thing he had to look forward to was the stupid talk show interview in
"Sorry. I didn't mean to stop you," Ty said and side stepped towards the breakfast bar but kept to the opposite side of Gleason.
"But-- but we haven't--"  Tony couldn't remember what they were supposed to do.  "--haven't-- completed the objective, we hadn't found Clint, and Nat
Steve let out a ragged breath.
She glared at him.  "Are you

"Oh God... oh,
progress, will occur then.  And I will be revered as the man who made it happen."
"Steve, please... please..."  Tony rutted the toy into Steve; Steve whimpered, then coughed, probably due to the pill in his throat.
"Do you want to shower together or separately?" Steve asked, not sure if Tony wanted the space.
For a moment everyone was silent and it was unclear whether Tony was even in there or whether this was merely a drone.
No.  Had to be a coincidence.  Surely there were other Leos from California.
"I was reading about the conference," continued Steve.  "I couldn't find much. I'm kinda confused about they actually
Steve hated the fact that they had cameras on them. He wanted to tell Bucky everything but he also didn't want HYDRA to know what they had no right to know. How much Steve had loved him, how much it hurt to watch him fall. Steve couldn't express these things without feeling exposed to his very enemies. It was a test of his conviction.
Everyone seemed to heave a collective sigh.
"Yep," said Tony.
He heard something.  He looked over; Aria had apparently come in, but stopped dead in the doorway when she realized what they were doing.  A hand flew up to shield her eyes. "Oh my God, I'm so sorry."
made Steve feel angry.
Steve blinked. There. He'd said it. Why had that been so hard?
"Relax," he advised, scooting down between Steve's legs.
"Thought you like codenames,
"How's it going Steve? The pictures look great, right? Have you seen the ones with you and Trace out on the pool? Stunning!" Alexis beamed, patting Steve on the arm. He was a lot less touchy-feely kind of guy.
"Er, guys...I think Steve is...drawing something." Sam pointed down at the floor.
"Absolutely," said Tony, still coughing lightly.  "I'm making a ton of progress down there! Go do yoga, go be stretchy.  I love stretchiness. You can show me what you learned later." He wiggled his eyebrows.
"No one," blurted Tony, looking guilty.
Rogers," said Gideon, voice dripping with sarcasm, "that kidnapping and illegal detention is as much a felony as tampering with national databases."
...everyone he knew was dead.
Steve wondered if Sam and Rhodey were friends after New Year's Eve. Whilst he'd been cut off Tony he'd been cut off from everyone else too. He realized he had no idea how any of his friends were, or if they were okay. Steve had been a shit friend. He'd ignored them for two months and then dragged them into
And he couldn't explain to to the crowd, but it hadn't been a random attack from a feral Alpha.  It had been
"Just because you're a bad omega doesn't mean you  have to be mean to me," he said. Steve rolled his eyes and turned to look at him over his shoulder.
Karpov eyed Steve with interest; he was visibly shaking and looking flushed.
"Yeah...yeah. Like in the next few weeks. Don't really know when. My metabolism makes it hard to predict."
Enjoy the fluff while it lasts.  You guys KNOW our boys are in for some angst...
He scooted closer to Steve, pressing their bodies together, and put an arm around his shoulders.  He leaned in to nose his neck gently.
.  But it didn't work that way.  Steve's body had pledged its allegiance to the other Alpha and nothing sort of death would change that.
, Sam's blocky, efficient scrawl (
"Ah! That's classified!" Sitwell butted in and Pepper rolled her eyes.
Steve shivered as Tony sucked and bit at his ear, trembling beneath as he slowly rocked into his hand. He moaned, pushing his hips up into Tony too and encouraging him to move. "I know it's not a secret that we have sex. But that doesn't mean I should have to try and have a sane conversation with anyone while your dick is up my ass."
is!  I thought I told you to stop believing these stupid tabloids!"  He didn't add that Union Jack was indeed an omega.
"Steve," whispered Bucky.
When they realized they had the attention of Natasha, Sam, and Steve, they all began yelling at them.
"...political?" Steve echoed, finally processing what Tony was saying. He dragged his gaze away from the box to look up at the Alpha.  "That doesn't even make sense," he said eventually, a frown knotting into his brow. "Why would I....
"Ice?" offered Tony.
Steve met Fury's gaze with the upmost contempt possible, blue eyes fiery. Steve might have been scared and confused, but he would never back down from a fight and God help him if he was going to let Fury feel like he was winning here. Steve thought about the things he'd seen, things he'd felt and smelled. Bucky smelled like the ashes of fire, an inviting type of heat. It was
"Sure thing," Mac said, appearing out of the crowd that had taken Pietro and Wanda away. "Where do you want him?"
"Don't make me come over there and kick your ass again, Anthony!"
Steve let out a long breath. "I found your brother."
"You can't afford to let it bother you, you know," said Joey over his shoulder at Tony.  "It's a bit messy and all, but you know, the information on that drive... it might save lives later down the road.  You have to look at the big picture."
--ackles!"
Tony let out a sigh of satisfaction, rutting into Steve with short, sharp, quick thrusts.  "Yeah... oh, yeah..." he moaned, looking down at Steve longingly. Steve was bucking up into him, massaging the knot, tugging at Tony with his body, and it was incredibly satisfying to see Steve-- no,
Donner smiled and flopped back onto the pillow, looking over at Tony and Steve.  He reached for Steve's hand again and his eyes softened. "I'm sorry, Steve. I'm sorry for what he did.  It's my fault. He did that because of me, because I left him and--"
"Hey, Nick, I'm just gonna put you on loud speake-r-"
"My omega," replied Tony.  The words dropped out of his mouth before he was aware of them.
"They never said the serum would affect things sexually," Steve said carefully. Maybe it had? It was possible, after all. Sure, it meant Steve had a shorter refractory period (don't ask how he knows that) but that was about it. And sure, his body could cope with heats but now he wasn't half dying all the time that was hardly surprising.
Come to think of it, it wasn't that surprising.  When Howard had died at the age of 70, he'd looked like he was in his fifties.  And that was taking into account that, at the end, he'd been drinking almost continuously.
He looked over at Steve.  Fuck.  Steve was in a t-shirt and his neck had two large bruises on it.
Pepper blinked.  "...ice cream? Sure.  Fine. What kind?"
Tony shoved his father's paper's aside and went to work on his suit instead.  There was no chance of finding old photos in the suit so it was, at least emotionally, a much safer project to dedicate his time to.
.  What the hell was Steve talking about?
There was nothing on the other side of the equal sign, after all.
Steve shouldn't have been surprised when he was woke up the next morning, not by the alarm, but by both the phone ringing and a pounding on his door.
"And then
But bonds didn't break.  Pairs almost never separated unless a partner died and, even then, they rarely rebonded; just look at how Jarvis had withered away after Howard's death.  That was the whole point of a pair-bond.  It was a lifelong commitment, almost sacred in its seriousness.  Omegas could never distance or sever bonds; once bitten, they were linked forever to their Alphas.  (Alphas could distance or sever bonds, but doing so was rare and frowned upon except in extreme circumstances.)
, it was great."  Tony caught Steve's blank look.  "...never mind, don't worry about it, Banner's probably dead.  Real shame.  The guy was supposed to be a real renaissance man."  A shadow passed over Tony's face.  "...it was probably my guns that took him down."  A pause.  "Anywho.  JARVIS!  Need a new index!  Project Thor!"  He turned to Steve.  "Obviously they're speaking in code.  Probably because of me.  I bet Fury knew I'd get in.   It's good to know he's not underestimating my brilliance.  I mean, you really can't, I'm
Already his phone had begun pinging with various well wishes from his contacts.  He ignored it, focused on Steve and the bacon. "How you feeling? Better?" he asked.  Steve was still musky with post-heat but he looked a lot better than he had earlier. Tony felt a pang of affection.  "...you want me to give you a bath later?" he offered, sipping his coffee.
"Shut up. Get this thing off me- y
"Threesomes sound stressful. Someone's always going to be left out."
Steve paused at the bottom, gaze dragging over the ocean of flowers in the living room. Before he knew what he was doing he was pushing aside some of the orchids to pick up the tulips. He gently turned the flowers over in his hands; he smelt them and closed his eyes. They'd made Tony so uneasy but to Steve they were the least imposing - far more affordable and far less pretentious than the orchids. They were flowers that he recognised from the fields and roadsides of muddy, war-trodden France. He sighed softly and set them back down.
, he thought, fondly.  Love, longing, a desire to nurture and protect and provide for.  Bucky felt whole again; he felt a range of emotions he hadn't in probably seventy years.  There were no words but none were needed. Their bond, like most, was one of feeling, of emotions.
"...what, you don't like it?" murmured Tony as Steve accused him of being bossy.  He wrapped his arms around Steve.  "...you're a good boy," he whispered, softly.  "So obedient.  So good."
Steve was so confused when DeSoto appeared in front of him. Why did his stepping out of the omega 'pen' cause such a raucous? He turned out to see everyone staring at him, his eyes wide. Steve wanted to laugh. They all looked like they were afraid of him. A grim part of himself thought they
He was fumbling.  Steve wasn't even saying anything but his disappointment was so strong he might as well have been.
Tony clung to Steve the whole ride over.  By the time he spotted the Pacific, it was just past noon and he was starving.  Sitting on the bench of the chopper with Steve curled in his lap, he passed the time by playing pong with JARVIS inside of his helmet.
, he just... she was amazing. She was everything an omega could be; she was proof that they were worth it. She was exactly the kind of role model Steve just wished he could have had growing up.
It wasn't easy hearing a doctor say that Tony was hurting himself, but Steve was in no place to criticism him. He was equally reckless; he'd literally been throwing himself against a mechanized military war machine a day before, in
"I'm going to recommend a brief leave of absence.  Just a week," said Dr. Brazinski, beginning to type on the computer.  "I want you to understand this isn't because I doubt your competency.  Quite the opposite.  However, undergoing traumatic psychological tests during your honeymoon phase is probably complicating the bonding situation.  I'm going to put off Tony's evaluation as well.  The two of you should be spending time together, solidifying your relationship... is one week okay?  It's a bit short, but considering the situation in New Mexico, Fury probably will fight even seven days..."
Not tell Natasha.  Sure.  That was probably for the best.  Why would they possibly tell Steve's friends?
Tony groaned in reply.  He knew Steve had left not because he'd made any sound, but because his smell disappeared.  Steve smelled... excited. Not happy, exactly. But energized. The way Tony felt when he finally cracked a tough problem.
Someone brushed the hair out of his eyes.  He appreciated the gesture; he couldn't move his arms to tuck it behind his ears and it had really been starting to annoy him.  He felt a small, fierce bit of pride that he had, apparently, completed his objective, though he didn't really understand what they meant.  He had a vague recollection of a man, a man who was familiar, a man with white hair.  That had been part of the objective, he was sure of it.  And he could swear he'd seen that guy before, somewhere.  He remembered being mad that he'd been drinking.  But the two memories didn't seem to fit; they were like two pieces to a puzzle that didn't actually click with each other and he gave up trying to figure it out.  It wasn't his place to understand; it was his place to obey.
