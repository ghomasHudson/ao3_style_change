Steve took a deep breathe. “Yes. It was really hard and it really opened our eyes a bit. They had suggested that Tony just created TJ out of boredom and experimentation, just to see if he could. It wasn’t the case, at all. Tony was ready to just take Tommy and leave the country, but I convinced him to stay and fight, to prove that we wanted a child together, that had our DNA, and we won.” Steve said. “Tony spent two years researching and getting everything right. He didn’t even attempt until he knew for sure it would work, and we weren’t going to try the cloning process more than once, if it hadn’t worked the first time, we were going to adopt.”
“We have to regroup.” James repeated again. “Once we have everyone together we will go from there. We have some water that you can have and we will be on our way again.”
“At the moment. I just have to focus. I had my cry.” Kielar said. “There are people that need me though, and I have to make sure that they are okay. I’ll find Karla, and we’ll get Steve and Tony out. We’ll bring people here to safety.” Kielar said. “We can do this.”
“Good. They might be heading over to you. I called from a secure line, and I know you have top security.”
“Why would Kielar not be okay? He’s with us, of course he’s fine.” Tony snapped and then stopped as Steve put a hand on his arm. “Sorry. Yes. Kielar is fine. Is Karla?”
“Freeze!” a voice commanded from across the room.Steve quickly moved to block the boys behind him as they remained still. “We have orders to take in the mutant Kielar Storm.” Tommy looked at Kielar, who was shaking next to him. He took his friends hand and gave him a slight nod as he slipped a device into his hand.
“Classified information that we weren’t even supposed to know.” Azari nodded. “I am going to contact my father and get an update on what will happen. We can narrow down a timeline. I will also inform him that we will have an extra person.”
“You were tracking my phone weren’t you?” He asked her as the two sat down at a table together. “I know your ways Desiree, and I know you knew what today was.”
“Anna Marie Darkholme, you are to be moved to a mutant encampment under the new law in place by President Trask.”
“I know. I know sweetie. But we need to make sure you get out of here. So we can find your brother and sister.” Vivienne tried getting through to her. “Mr. Drake wanted you to get away. He wanted you to survive. Please come with us.”
“These are the best ever. You can’t have ANY.” Blaine told his brother, snatching the bag back. “You should invite her back. If she makes cookies like this…”
“You know they say the same about you, Flit.” Mara said, watching her brother rush out of the safe house. “Are you following.”
The only thing that ever threw Francis off, was the bitter custody battle that his parents had.Bobbi had made it completely clear that she wanted full custody of the boy, then 8 years old. However, Clint, wanted to make sure that his son was happy and if he only got weekends and some holidays, he was fine with that. The man had seen the way the divorce was affecting the young boy. That was the first time he had ever taken Francis to the archery range. It was how he had learned to let out his anger and frustration.
“We gotta get ya’ll outa here.” Lapin told all of them, bursting through the doors. “Dey have Tony Stark and Steve Rogers in custody, Dey ain’t gonna wait to come after ya’ll, its public knowledge dat us LeBeau’s fought against dis law.”
“Get her to the jet. I think we have almost everyone, get ready to leave.” James instructed him and Izzy gave him a nod before blending in with the escaping mutants. “Daken! Whats the status?”
“Jade Summers. Red over there with the bad attitude wanting to blame people here for what happened. Her abilities are to put a person's greatest fear into their mind and live it in a loop until she decides enough is enough. You are Vivienne Worthington, Your parents are Angel and Psylocke, both of who have left the X-men. You have Psionic wings and can use them to take flight, defense or even weapons. A twin brother and a little sister. Jett Wisdon, he’s not actually a Wsidom, his father is Peter Quill but he took his step dads name...he is a shadow…”
The moment the world had been introduced to the new Captain America and  Iron Man, he knew his son was part of the pair. There was a pride inside him that he wished he could have expressed to him, but their relationship had already been rocky by then. He had screwed up and let his past feelings get in the way. Now that Kielar was older, he didn’t see the boy as a future Pietro Maximoff, he saw him as his own person, and he only wished he could have tried harder to do that much earlier.
“This is new, you never said anything about this before.” Clint spoke. “I mean you know I don’t care right? Besides, James is a good kid, I’m sure he’d go out with you if you asked him.”
“I think the kids should learn how to cook” Steve continued, and all three boys looked at him in shock. “That’s an idea we can pass around. There will be so many of them there, no reason for us to order out or for us to do all the work, and if they refuse to, we’ll send Natasha in there.”
“Wanna see what my Mara give me?” Keegan asked, his little face lighting up, as he said the girls name. Bucky only nodded before the boy brandished a knife from.
“Yet the X-men were not made aware?” Vivienne Worthington asked. “We have people, families who escaped to England, France, and even Australia, when they could have come here. We are all separated, but who I see in this room are a bunch of non powered Avengers and some misfits that left Xavier’s, lead by an ex-villian.”
Azari had noticed how the red headed boy had remained close to the blond stark boy. How both of them kept the silver haired one in their eye sights. He had quickly picked up on the fact that the brunette girl and the sleeping boy had a very close relationship. How the redhead girl picked at the blond boy and he would just let it roll off, or even retaliate. Though the two seemed serious with each other, there was never any heat behind their words. The twin boys were very hesitant in trusting any of them. Azari had also noted that they did not like S.H.I.E.L.D. at all. One thing he needed to do was learn everyone’s name, it would be helpful for when they worked together in the future.
“He did. They were being held until last night. They are laying low and going to try and get here as soon as possible, but they don’t want to raise suspicion by leaving immediately. They are most likely being watched closely. Pepper got them out and is staying with them.” Reed paused as the elevator opened and they stepped out. He stopped Johnny from continuing. “We don’t know where half of the Avengers are. There are few here but like with Steve and Tony they could have been taken in. All these kids are on edge so we need to try and keep the peace.”
“I mean, we knew this was coming right?” Azari asked. “We knew, and we have trained and we have prepared. My mom, those kids…” his hand covers his mouth to keep calm as he shuts his eyes and takes several breaths. James gently touches his arm, Francis steps closer and puts his hand on his shoulder. “I’m not leaving any of you. If the choice comes for me to stay and fight with you or go home to Wakanda, I am not leaving. You three will come with me, or I will remain here, they will not have a choice.”
“Remember what we spoke about your work habits and how they influence Tommy? He uses them against us all the time. It’s getting harder to argue with him.” Steve told him. “Now let’s go to bed. All of this will still be here in the morning and you know that both TJ and Kielar will be more than happy to help you.”
“Before we go in.” Reed said as the elevator door shut. “Most of the X-men did not make it to this location, some of their children did.”
“Well, yes.” Dakota said. “And, if you followed closely then you would know what their next target was. They’re making some sort of announcement from…”
New York was far from a quiet city, even in the late hours of night. Most people who lived in the city could hear people outside, or cars driving by. There were those lucky enough though to have buildings high enough above the streets to avoid the chaos below. The ninety-three story building on Broadway, Stark Tower, was one of many. Like most nights, the tower was black, except for the ninety-second floor, the residential area.
When Tommy finally reached the busier part of the city, he was more relieved. Now it was just a matter of getting to his destination. The trek had been long, very long. This achievement was something for him to brag about too, because he was far from being athletic, not like his brother. He would rather drive, or use his suit, then walk as much as he had. Now he was just a few more miles from where the tracker said James was, he could do this.
“No, no, listen. Karla has cut her link off before. When we argue. We do that to each other but this, this is different. When she cut the link before I could still feel her. I can’t now though, she isn’t here, I can’t…” Kielar broke off as he became more upset. “I can’t feel her. It hurts.” Tommy moved to sit next to Kielar and put his arm around him. “I can’t feel her TJ. It hurts.”
“What? No, of course not. I came a…” he was cut off as a hand collided with the back of his head. “What the hell James!”
Bucky stood, unmoving for several moments before shaking his head. “I can see why he picked you.” he said simply. “Let’s make the food and I’ll find the shoes that were made for speedsters, I know they’re somewhere around here.”
“I can tell you right now Blaine will not be a part of anything remotely related to S.H.I.E.L.D.” Bruce immediately stated. “And if Blaine won't have a part of it Devon will turn it down in a less polite way.” The scientist ran his hand through his hair.
“It’s good to see you again. Will all of you have your usual?” She asked, going back behind the counter.
“Jade, get goin’!” she heard from above her and someone dropped down from above her, swinging their bo-staff around. “We got dis, focus and get outa here sugah.”
Kielar moved and sat up a little straighter before he leaned forward and looked at Tony and Steve. The young man had been through a lot that year already, and the two Avengers had saved his life. He felt like he owed them for everything they had done, Tommy as well. “I’ll give California a try.” he said. “I trust you.”
“There is way more to it than that, but we don’t know Kielar very well, he said his sister was in the Baxter building didn’t he? Johnny had twins, and then there is Franklin and Micah that are also around.” Jett explained.
“I take offense to that Laura.” Johnny said after appearing through the trees. “Nice middle of nowhere place you have.”
That one man became the most powerful person in the United States, and that one man made promises that people wanted kept. The older generation spoke volumes, remembering the times when they dealt with the mutant crisis decades before. They blamed others for the lax laws toward them, demanding to reintroduce the registration act.
As he spoke on the phone, he could only smile as his mother encouraged him to go forward as he had planned to do. She wanted him to do what was best for him, she always had. Being a hero had not been on the top of the list for the Prince of Wakanda, he knew it would potentially happen. His father had sent him to New York, to meet with the Avengers so he himself could get a better idea, T’Challa had made it very clear that whatever it was, it would be his decision and nobody else’s. Having that support from the two of them, was something he appreciated more than anything. He was able to make his own choices, and it allowed him to make mistakes growing up as well. It had taught him a different way to consider things in life.
“James, I need to speak to you.” Daken said and moved toward the jet.His younger brother kissed the top of Desiree’s head and stood up following the older man. Daken had his back turned toward the girl as he spoke again. “Bucky said that they just got reports that the LeBeau place is gone.”
“Because Steve, all three of them are passed out.” Natasha motioned. “I swear they can sleep anywhere.”
“So..um..sorry not meaning to be rude or anything but, why are you here? Talking to me?” Kielar asked her, confusion written on his face.
“Probably because nobody wanted him there around the children,” Clint said. “But you know what Cap, I'll trust your judgment until he does something to screw up.”
The two men immediately raced toward their son's room and opening it found Tommy physically restraining his friend. “He wouldn’t slow down! I didn’t know what else to do.” The teenager called out to his dads as they came in. “He keeps screaming about Karla. I don’t know what is going on.”
“Secrets aren’t good among teammates.” Heather said from behind Daken. “I know you two have taken charge but we would like to know what is happening.”
“We don’t even know,” A new voice spoke up coming from around the corner and Kielar spun around to see Johnny. “Hey kid.” Kielar stared at the man in silence. “I’m glad you made it here safe.
“I am sure that is part of it.” Steve told his youngest, giving him a warning look. “The Avengers in this room will be training all of you. We are also bringing in Bucky, and Daken.” Steve paused a moment, waiting to see if he would be interrupted. “We will not force any of you to go, but we want to encourage you to give this a chance. We know all of you have some form of training, and that you have already put it to use in one way or another. You are our absolute first choice in this project they have asked us to do. There will be others joining you, and not everyone will be on the same page at first, it will take a lot of work, patience and trust”
“Have you ever heard of him?” Renee asked. “Because he seems really familiar, but I can’t quite pin why.”
“There has to be something. People can’t just disappear like that.” Kielar said. “I mean, I guess they really could but, I don’t think any of the LeBeau’s could pull that trick off.”
I have actually had most of this written for awhile, but its been sitting here. I just finished tonight but good news the next chapter is completely done. Let me know what you think!
Thank you so much for reading! Let me know what ya'll think so far. I absolutely love feedback and kudos!
“Oh, shut the fuck up!” Tommy suddenly yelled. He knew it was a mistake as soon as the words left his mouth. Everyone turned toward him. “These people, and yes, I said people, because they are, and they have friends and  they have families. What happened last night in New York was against everything we as a nation stand for! This man that you are idolizing is splitting this nation apart because of your fears. You mentioned Kielar Storm, how he could take you out in a split second, but has he? No, because unlike most of you standing here, he has fucking morals. He is in the right state of mind and HE wouldn’t harm you. Obviously you do not understand that you have been living, working and befriending mutants for decades now, possibly centuries. Your meager little minds just can’t grasp it now because you are being fed lies and hatred. I bet you didn’t even know that the President's own father was a mutant! That family for three generations has had it out for mutants. So you can take your little tirade about Kielar fucking Storm and shove it up your ass because he has done more to HELP this country than your pathetic ass ever will.” Tommy turned to walk away as people started murmuring
“Hey! You came dance huh?” Francis asked, grinding against him, “You should move to the music, you do know how to dance right?”
As they got older, the twins had shown such polar opposite personalities it was hard to keep up with. Karla was a social butterfly, and Kielar loved being around people to a point, but it had to be of his choosing. Karla always knew what she liked and told people exactly how she wanted something and never held back. Her brother, however, would change his interests and not stick to just one thing. It happened so often that Johnny stopped putting him into extra activities because of the boy changing his mind after just a week, becoming bored with it. This had disheartened Kielar, but he never complained, and started finding other ways to entertain himself, which led to Johnny doting on his daughter more.
“Wow, I didn’t even realize how much time he spent beforehand. Mom always said I should talk to you about all of this.”
“I seem to remember that not being the case before Keegan was born. I’m glad you're here too though, and that you brought back up, coming alone would have been stupid.” Laura told him.
Renee Drake looked at the other two teens, tears in her eyes as she contemplated going with them. Her heart hurt. All she wanted was for her father to be okay, for the entire night to be a dream. Her hands returned to normal color and she quickly wiped her eyes. “Okay. Okay. Let’s..fine...we can go. David got Michelle out. Dad came back for me, I had been in the library.” her voice was shaky and unsure as she spoke. “I’m not going to hold back. They deserve what is coming...where did the bodies go?” She asked suddenly.
Kielar turned to Vivienne. “Okay, so the easiest way for me to carry you is bridal style. Will you be okay with that?” He asked.
“Kid, I’m not the leader of the team that rescued some of the taken mutants.” Daken laughed. “That was all them, I just helped where I could.”
“Nothing.” She answered and hurried away, grabbing Francis and dragging him away, shoving food into his mouth to shut him up.
I honestly love writing Francis, because there really isn't too much known of him and what you do know is from a different universe where he doesn't have his parents. It is just a lot of fun.
It took a moment for it to click in Johnny’s mind what had just been said before he looked back and forth between the two. “Wait.” he said, putting up his hands. “The two of you? Really?”  he asked . “Huh, I would have never guessed. Especially after we…”
“What the hell is going on with the goddamn country! Taking kids from their homes now, they haven’t done anything wrong.” the man snapped.
“Daddy!” a small voice called, darting past James and Desiree, followed by Bucky Barnes. The small boy launched himself into Daken’s arms and hugged him tight. As the boy was settled on the man’s hip, the two switched to sign language. Vivienne and Jade looked at each other and then back at them.
“I’ll tell you later. It’s a great story.” Dakota smiled. Kielar and Steve walked in a moment later and the younger boy sat down in his spot next to Tommy again. “So, with Mara already having said yes earlier, that means we are all going?”
“With the way they talk about you, you might as well be.” Bucky laughed, shaking his head as he grabbed several items from the refrigerator. Kielar remained quiet while they made the sandwiches. “I know this is probably not the right thing to ask, but are you okay?”
“It’s a process Ko Ko. It just takes time.” He said as kielar brought his suitcase in. “You’re done already Kie?”
“I have already told you dad, Mara and I are only friends. There are no feelings beyond that.” Francis said. “Besides, her brother is a bit more my type.” Clint turned to Francis and stood quietly. “What?”
“It was really easy.” Tommy said said. “The lights that shine as big as his ego. Yeah, that gave it away immediately. I actually forgot it was happening.Can we watch the movie.”
“Originally, but Tony made you a couple of pairs too. They knew you would end up here. This place was built with you in mind. Tony doesn’t have many mutant kids he needs to hide you know.”
“Daken..As in Dark Wolverine, as in Logan's son...as in...” Clint started. “As in the guy who tried to blow up all of the team bases?”
“KARLA!” Kielar suddenly sat up, causing all three of them to jump. Steve put a hand on the boy's shoulder. “Something happened, I can’t feel her. I can’t feel her. She’s usually in my head, she’s not. I can’t..” he looked at Steve, his eyes wide. “I don’t think my sister is alive.”
“I contacted someone. As soon as we are cleared from here, everything will be taken care of. He won’t be left here long, I promise.” Kielar insisted. “We take care of our own.”
Especially Eliza, who had become Blaine's favorite person. None of them knew if it was because he liked her personality, or because everytime they walked in, she had a bag of homemade chocolate chip cookies for him. The first time that had happened, they all wondered when the development had taken place, only to find out that Blaine would leave on his own to visit her. It was a good development though for the rather recluse boy, he needed more than just a few people to socialize with.
“He’s the current Captain America. I wasn’t sure at first, but when he started talking to us about what we needed to do, I met him before. He also said that he had been at Stark Tower.”  Jett responded. “He’s good at what he does. I wasn’t aware he had super speed, it isn’t something he displays when he’s in uniform. I guess that is good considering it helps with his secret identity.”
“We’re family. There was no question about me being there for you, if you need anything just let me know. I’ll be there.”  James said.
“Last minute arrangement.” She said, “We are ready when you are, but we might have a stop to make. We received something on the shortwave radio. Henri LeBeau.”
“I don’t want to be compared to my parents?” James admitted. “I get asked a lot if I’m going to take up the shield one day, and I don’t really think it’s for me.” he told them. “I want to go to California, meet the others that were chosen and find my own place. I know I want to be a hero, I just don’t want to follow in the exact footsteps.” The teenagers all found a spot and took a seat as Tony tended to Kielar, a small bracelet place around his wrist. The other adults had filed in when the kids had started opening up to each other.
The girls watched as he walked away and Vivienne looked at her friend before letting out the breath she had been holding. “That was intense.”
Jade stepped forward with her arms crossed. “First thing I want to know is why nobody knew about this place except the speedster.”
“No, that’s when he sits there and asks us all those questions about our childhood, right now he is is doing a behavioral study.” Blaine explained to his brother. “They’re different but he does both and I don’t think he realizes it. You do it to him too, I only know that because you start talking about all his quirks.” He finished as he shoved a cookie in his mouth.
“Figure I’ll let them sweat a little longer, no need to get them riled up this early in the morning.” Tony yawned. Steve laughed and leaned over giving him a kiss. “You still think this whole thing is a good idea?”
“Last night, they harmed our men and women only following orders! They hospitalized half of those who came into their home. They hid Kielar Storm, who is still somewhere out there! This mutant who at any time could take one of us out in the blink of an eye.” Tommy’s eyes narrowed as he listened to the guy go on about his friend. His fist clenched up. “The president has the right idea! It should have been done years ago.”
“Are we really back on that?” James asked her. “Because I don’t know if you saw or heard right, maybe even imagining things.”
Kielar stayed with them after a disagreement with his own father, Johnny Storm, after learning that he had adopted him and his sister Karla. Johnny and Kielar had always argued, especially when the teenage years hit. The boy had developed powers similar to his biological fathers, Pietro Maximoff. With that, he had to learn a lot about control, and where Johnny tried to help, it always failed and a fight would end up happening. The latest disagreement had brought Kielar over for the weekend.
“It does make a little more sense. I was curious to know why Pietro and Wanda were not at the meeting, it must have been discussed beforehand.” Azari said looking up. “You and your friend really did research. I am glad you have shared this with me. I do hope you decide to go. I have made my decision already and would like to be able to fight with you at my side.”
“She is my sister and a good person. You do not know her so I would suggest you stop speaking” Azari said said, moving off the couch. “You see her on that television. But you do not know her story. We would be lucky to have her with us. She is a very loyal person and if what I say does not convince you, I assure you that my mother will speak on her behalf.”
“Oh, Wolverine's oldest son, right? Yeah, I think we learned a bit about him. Didn’t he like, threaten to blow up some buildings or something? I’m on this superhero kid message board and rumor has it he’s with Bucky Barnes now or something. He apparently has a child too. Mohawk guy, right? Yeah, everyone thinks it's super adorable when he carries this tiny kid on his shoulders.”
“Wait!” Johnny called. “You can’t just rush out of here alone.” he continued as he followed the man, Bucky silently followed the two out of the room. James continued to hold Desiree.
The day had begun dark for many on the morning of November 4th 2036. They declared the night before a new president. One that declared change for many who lived in the United States of America. The ones who were safe, celebrated the victory, took to the streets with joy, promoting their new president who promised them safety and happiness. He had taken the people's fear that had grown over decades and swore that the change would take place if they elected him. And he was.
Johnny Storm had not left his daughter's side since he arrived, and in doing so, his son had avoided the medical area as much as possible. There had been a few moments where he would see Kielar looking into the room from the door, or he had been woken up by soft singing at Karla's bedside, and then the moment he realized Johnny was awake, he disappeared. The man had no idea how he should approach the situation, especially after seeing his face when they met in the hangar.
“I know what I heard Red.” She told him standing up. “I think you said something about a movie, yes?”
All four of them stopped at the news they had just received. Nicole immediately stepped away from the group and pulled out a phone she didn’t often use. Ryan did the same, though he pressed a communicator to try and get a hold of the rest of their team to make sure they were okay. “Blaine is going to be high on the threat list.” Devon said out loud, making everyone pause in their movements. “Which means we do not have time to make calls or clean, we need to move now.”
Barbara “Bobbi” Morse was not a bad mother by any means. She just didn’t quite get the hint that Francis preferred his father’s presence. She hovered, her son preferred distance at times. He was a fighter, like both his parents, and many times went out on his own to be the hero in situations that he probably should have never put himself into, but that was just simply who he was. Bobbi had wanted her son to follow in her footsteps and become a S.H.I.E.L.D agent, and while she had custody of him, she would often take him to the Helicarrier. Francis showed zero interest in being a part of the agency, but much to Bobbi’s disdain, had picked up on his father’s skill.
“Got it mate” Hades responded and moved to the door. As they flew over the scene they had just left, the street lit up in flames and the explosions heard in the distance as the door closed and everyone settled in for the ride. It was silent for a while, The rescued mutants coming down from the adrenaline of every event that happened that night. Daken’s team sat in the back, finally able to rest for even a moment.
Tommy slowly lessened his grip on Kielar as his friend became still. “Kielar.” Tony said, trying to get his attention. The teen held a blank stare and remained unresponsive. “He wasn’t hurt, was he?”
Rumors spread of gated communities being set up for mutants, watched over by the newly resurrected Sentinel program. Tests being distributed for the gene, hoping to expose those denying they were different.  Mutants went into hiding, some went underground, where the Morlocks took them in and helped them adjust to an alternative life. Xavier’s School for the Gifted remained untouched, because attacking a school was not okay. Inside the Baxter building and Stark Tower rumors of mutants being hidden stirred, some questioning where the other heroes stood.
Before he could stop another group of soldiers moved into view. The childish girl on his back dropped to the ground by staying behind him, holding onto the back of her shirt. “Jett, what are we going to do.” she asked.
The LeBeau family has see what has happened in other states, they know their daughter is out there fighting. Its just a waiting game now.
“Hmm, okay. Not as bad as I thought. Now, is there a way to activate the tracker that I snuck onto James’ communicator?” Tommy asked the computer.
“I never want to hear you speak like that. How can you be so closed minded with the world we live in Jonathan? That is Kielar’s best friend, and you know what Steve and Tony went through after the government found out about Tommy.”
“We need to see if there are any others. We want to clear the mansion before we leave, and make sure nobody gets left behind.” Vivienne said. “Are you with us Renee?”
“You can’t just run off like that and tell people to watch out for Keegan, he needs you as much as the others do.” James yelled at Daken, who turned away rolling his eyes, which was apparently the wrong move because his brother grabbed him and punched him. “I’m talking to you!”
“No thank you, I will be eating with Francis tonight.” She informed him. “Are we staying here all night and going home tomorrow?” Mara questioned, grabbing her overnight bag and placing it on the bed. “We always pack one just in case, but I wasn’t sure what we were doing.”
“That bitch is the reason why you weren’t taken to a camp and still have a collar on so tone down on the attitude.” Daken snapped. Johnny remained silent as the exchange took place, but moved into the room further with Reed, and toward where Ben stood. “We were there because the tech they used gave the location of where they were headed, intercepting was all we could do. We maybe could have handled the Baxter building, possibly Stark Tower, but you think the five of us could have taken down Xavier’s? We would not have stood a chance and there would have been even more casualties. We had to go with what we knew we could handle. Everyone had the exact same warning, which was nothing. These kids have been putting everything into trying to keep this from happening.”
Devon sat in his room, a suitcase opened up on his bed and a few articles of clothing were thrown inside. Blaine had his open just outside the walk in closet, where he stood going through his array of clothes. The two sat in silence as they somewhat packed until Blaine walked out and sat next to his brother. “I have a dilemma.” He announced, holding a large box on his lap.
“Whoa, wait, you are not going out there and getting yourself killed.” He told him, grabbing his arm. “And Keegan and not growing up without you. You’re going off about family and seem to forget you have a brother and son here at this place right now that look up to you and count on you for answers.” he paused. “ And you have me.” Bucky added.
Laura turned to the two men but remained silent as she eyed them. “Thank you.” she said simply before turning and walking inside to help the rest of her family. Bucky and Johnny looked at each other and shrugged before going to help them.
“Oh I know, but at least it’ll be later. Maybe she’ll leave a voice message and we can just delete it.” Francis said as he leaned back in his seat and grabbed a hat clint kept in the back seat and covered his eyes. “But that will be later, at least we don’t have to deal with it now.”
“Yes.” He said just as Kitty pulled him into a hug. He wrapped his arms around his mom, hugging her closely. “I love you mom.”
Dakota rubbed her eyes as she leaned back in her chair, still staring at the computer in front of her. She had finally received a brief message from one set of the West coast avengers, who had been in different locations at the time of the raid of their compound. They were holed up in a friend's home, a friend who had a sister working with a member of their covert team. It was one less trip that they would have to make and that helped Dakota a lot. The video of Tommy versus the protestors helped pinpoint the area they were in. She had been able to pinpoint a location they could hide out in. Dakota had been relieved to find out that Clint Barton had an apartment in the area. Now the hard part came in getting the two groups back to Canada discreetly.
“Hank and Janet are not Joining us either, though they said they would speak to their son Henry about it.” Tony added.
The building that once held the Avengers before many of them retired, was now home to Tony Stark, his husband Steve Rogers and their son Tommy. In recent times another also occupied it, Kielar Storm, or Maximoff, as he preferred these days. Steve and Tony had not minded taking in the teenagers, he was their son’s best friend. They had known him since he was a small child and knew of his existence even before then.
“It’s okay. Blaine told me a bit about what happened in his past. I’m glad he has friends like you.” Eliza smiled, handing him his order. “Here’s Devon’s as well.”
“She wouldn’t tell me over the radio.” He told him. “Shouldn’t be long though, quinjet is pretty fast. Is everyone strapped in?”
Steve hurried to Tommy’s room and opened the door, both boys dressed and with a bag each. “Let’s go.” he ordered and led them toward the lab. “Stay behind me.”
“I would be dead too!” Azari yelled. “I would have been with my mother and considering they shot down her plane, I would have been dead.” he felt Francis take his hand, and James put his hand on his shoulder. “My mother was dedicated to the X-men. She fought for them most of her life and for you to accuse me of not caring? That is a terrible thing to say. I had the chance to return home, to make sure that my team was safe, they were the directions my mother left me, it is what my father wanted me to do. But I am here, I am here because what happened was not right. It was wrong and we need to fight for our freedom again. We are here so that you do not have to fight alone, but if you keep this up, you will end up that way.”
“It was decided a while back that we wouldn’t immediately end up at the same location. It was better if we split up so if one of us was followed.” Kielat explained. “We had a feeling Steve and Tony wouldn’t get out scot free, they never go down without a fight.”
“I...I want to thank you for getting Karla from the truck. If you hadn’t, I wouldn’t have gotten to talk to her before..”
“I like them. I’m sorry I can’t be all ripped jeans and leather. You are a walking stereotype Devon.”
Tommy, Kielar and James remained where they were watching the LeBeau reunion. “You see where she get’s it from now don’t you?” a voice said from behind. The three spun around to see Steve and Tony standing there. “We were going to wait, but had the opportunity to leave and took it.” Steve explained. “I hear you three had quite the adventures.”
“Is this what you do in your free time?”  Johnny asked as he ate, Reed and Sue both laughed. “Superhero gossip is really a thing for you kids?” he continued.
“We are keeping that information under wraps as of right now,” Bucky began, “Until we have more solid information nothing is to be said of the LeBeau’s and what happened, is that clear.” He told them, leaving no room for argument. “Vivienne, show the to their rooms, lunch is in an hour.”
“Well, I hope you are right. We are about to have to start the process of getting Steve and Tony out of custody, which means also dropping the charges on Tommy.” Dakota explained. “So he needs to stay out of trouble until then.” she paused. “Why wouldn’t he just come here?”
“I already tried to once, I was locked in a closet and not let out until Mara came back” James shrugged. “Would rather not do that again.”
“I’ve only seen a few students and led them to Ms. Pryde.” She answered quickly. “More trained students stayed above ground to help get the younger ones to safety. I have seen none of the Drakes or Howlett’s. We aren’t too worried about the Howlett’s but we need ways to communicate with all the groups, we are ending up split. The Blackbird will fill up.”
“Ah do understand ya have ya orders, but ah will not be complyin’ wit’ dim today sugah. See, dat law goes against meh raght as a human, and ah ain’t goin’ nowhere.” In a swift moment a book flew across the room toward the soldiers and exploded as she jumped over the back of the couch and knelt down. Anna had not been with the X-men since her children were young, she had not used her abilities for some time now. But she looked down at her hand, that was glowing, and knew that she had a piece of her husband with her as she fought. As she moved from her hiding spot, gunshots all around her, she used a man as a shield as as he fell grabbed his gun.
“When dey attacked meh, oui, dat was a pretty crazy tahme.” She said leaning back. “Da south ain’t a very good place to be sometimes. Ah got kinda a love hate relationship with it.”
“I would stop if I were you.” Francis Barton warned as he stepped next to Azari. “I’m not as nice with my words and you aren’t going to speak to my boyfriend like that.” he set his coffee cup down. “Hopefully you will reword what you were going to say, so by all means, continue.”
“Please explain to me how Captain America’s son is a destructive influence.” Sue challenged her brother. “There are so many worse people out there Johnny, you need to let this go.
“Because I followed everything you did when you found out you were adopted by Johnny. You aren’t bad, but you left a trail I could follow. Now, less talk and more work.”
“We were actually rescued by a speedster. He brought us here.” Vivienne informed her. “Are you hurt?”
It took half an hour to gather everyone together, and another to get everyone on the plane.The six hour plane ride seemed to take forever for the group, though many had fallen asleep for at least half of the trip. When they finally landed in California, a line of cars were already waiting for them. When they finally arrived and stepped into the new facility, the lights lit up. Friday greeted them.
“The younger ones are top priority Viv, you even said it, we are more trained, we need to get Cass to my mom and then we can stick together and help get others out.” he told her. “Between our abilities we can find a way out.”
Three days had passed quickly for the families, and on the last night they filled Stark Tower and all the rooms it had. There was a person at every turn, and it had been sometime since the tower had been this busy. Many of the kids hid themselves in the room they were given, it wasn’t that none of them wanted to actually be around each other, it was just that the ones who already did know one another tended to migrate toward each other. Small talk had happened at dinner, but as soon as it was over, they all scattered.
“Thank you Friday.” Tony said taking a deep breathe. “You knew about this and didn’t tell us Dakota?”
“Oh, goody.” Karla rolled her eyes. “Daddy!” She called out. “Could you get me a glass of orange juice, please?” Sue and Johnny turned toward the table where they saw the smiling teenager, and Reed, who tried not to laugh.
“Of course they are. Alright, send the information to my phone and I will start the GPS, let's get to walking.”
“He ain’t my James, and I can almost guarantee that if Akihiro is gonna be there, so will he. They got close recently.”
“Where did you get those?” Devon questioned and snatched the bag from him. “They aren’t that blonde kids are they?”
“They aren’t stopping at mutants.” Dakota said, looking up from her computer. “Steve and Tony may have gotten out, but they were also publicly taken.” She paused and looked at Francis and Mara. “They have Clint and Natasha.”
“I think we can forgive him this time seeing that we traveled by speedster.” Renee said with a small hint of a smile. “Speaking of speedster…” She said looking around her. “Where did Kielar go?” She paused as she spotted him. “Is that Bucky Barnes? He wasn’t lying when he said that the Avengers had this place prepared.”
He had met Annie over twenty years ago. Their relationship was something that would have lasted, if it had not been for the fact that Bruce was away so much with the Avengers. There had been no ill will toward either party either. A mutual decision that had ended up harder because after she had already moved back home, she had found out she was pregnant. That was the story he had been told, in the courthouse. They hadn’t been Banner’s yet but their step-father insisted they get their names changed as soon as possible, neither one of the boys made an argument.
“No Francis, we just started” Clint said. “If you hadn’t been up all night you wouldn’t be this tired.”
“We are getting off track. I have a facility in California. We can test this theory they have out. If it works, then it works. If not we’ll go back home.” Tony offered to all of them.
“I want an honest answer, who from the Fantastic four are they considering?” Tommy asked. “I have to prepare him ahead of time.”
Kielar sat next to his sister holding her hand as he sang softly to her. “You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are gray…” His voice broke, “You’ll never know, dear  how much I love you, please don’t take...my sunshine...away” he whispered the word and wiped tears away from his face. “I know we haven't been the closest lately Kar, and I know that is partially my fault. I pull away when things are bothering me. I hide. I should have talked to you about stuff, you know? I’m sorry, and I really want you to wake up so we can fix this. You missed it today. Dad defended me. I think he inadvertently told me he was proud of me too. I wish you could have heard it.” Kie pulled away from her for a moment and looked toward the door.  “I have one more idea.” he shut his eyes and focussed for a moment before his body dropped forward.
“I’m pretty sure I know who it was.” Dakota told him. “But I won’t reveal it unless you are willing to.”
“Shut up. You need to shut up, Tommy. Now follow me.” The older boy ordered and led them quickly through back alleyways until they were further from the park. He turned around when he knew it was safe and shoved his younger brother. “What were you thinking Tommy! I know we all have protocols set in place if something like this were to occur. You and Kielar were to get the hell out of New York and to Safety.”
“It’s been awhile, you think they’ll remember us kid?” Clint asked, and Francis rolled his eyes. “Yeah yeah I know. We’re pretty unforgettable.” The two fell into another silence as they walked into the building to check in, The man behind the counter gave them a wave and giving them access to the range immediately. “So. California. You sure about this?”
So when they ventured out for the night, none were surprised when they ended up at the ice cream shop. Blaine hurried in first, a large smile on his face, having seen that Eliza was working through the window. She quickly came out from behind the counter and hugged Blaine, who kissed her cheek. Nicole and Ryan both glanced at Devon who just shrugged and went to their normal seat as his brother chatted with the girl.
“I’m not sure. There is a group that brought a few here early on. I didn’t speak to them too much. It’s been a whirlwind of a night really. I still don’t know what exactly happened. I was told to run so I ran. “
Kitty hesitated for a moment before pulling out her communicator and placing it in her son's hand. “As soon as you are safe, you are to contact me. If I haven't heard from you in two days. I will come find you. As soon as you are out, get as far from large cities as you can. Do you understand me, Jett?”
“Wait, wait just a second.” Karla said. “Are you telling me? Daddy, tell Kie, you don’t know how terrified he is that you will reject him because of this. It would be such a tremendous thing. And after all this fighting since he tested his DNA, you guys need something to like bond over. You both are so stubborn. This could go on for ages.”
“Hey,” Tommy said, sprinting toward the other boy. “Look, you are speaking a million miles a minute and I can’t understand you. I need you to slow down.” Kielar grabbed his head, still moving at a super speed as he dashed around the room. “Jarvis.” Tommy spoke to the AI. “Call Dad and Pops in here please, something is going on with Kie.
“I saw that news report, you really hurt Johnny’s ego taking him down in front of all those people Cap.” Clint said trying to lighten the room a bit. “Probably one of your better moments.”
The new character that is introduced in this will be revealed more in the next series about the mutants invited to be apart of the Legacy Initiative. I also wrote this in one go and tried my best to check for inconsistencies in her accent. I know there are probably a few, I tried to tone it back a bit from the way I have written it in previous writing.
“Mom,” Jett started and looked at her. “Take Cass, I will stay with Vivienne and make sure we get everyone. We’ll get out.”
“We lost again because our new quarterback doesn't know any of the plays and Kielar is still being stubborn.” Karla grumbled as she sat next to her uncle. “What are they arguing about now?”
It wasn’t long before Devon came barging in when he found out his brother had been released. For years he had been trying to get him out of S.H.I.E.L.D custody, despite their step-father putting him there. Needless to say the older twin was not on good terms with that part of his family. They had yet to meet Bruce either. Once Devon was there, he refused to leave unless his brother went with him as well.
“He was initially grouped with them, so they only have two now. Micah Folds and Karla Storm.” Tony said,”We already have a plan in place to talk to him about it, especially the Karla aspect.”
“You could at least learn the basics. You need something.” Devon told his brother, relaxing a bit after hearing that he would be okay going. He didn’t want to make anything a big ordeal. Blaine stared at his brother for a few moments. “You have to learn to defend yourself B. I am not going to always be there to fight your battles.”
“Nope, I think he just threatened to withhold sex if I did anything stupid, and I will not test that.” Francis shrugged. “But we still have this and can keep an eye on things.”
“We are not here to discuss this. Maybe another time.” He told her, and received a shrug in response. “I am however very happy you gave me the information before I went in there. “
“We wouldn’t send you there sweetheart, we have trained you in using your abilities “ Sue reassured her. “Though it would have done you some good to have other kids around you with abilities.”
“Then they need help. I can get them out if they need it. I can bring them here right? I can bring whoever is left here and they can be safe.” Kielar said appearing in front of Bucky before he could blink.
“You were just complaining the other night that Tommy completely changed the formula you wrote and that Kielar altered a machine you were working on, and both turned out better.” Steve cut off. “Let’s go, bed now.”
“Papa!” she screamed, and Remy LeBeau turned when he heard his daughter's voice. She ran to him and he enveloped her into a hug as she broke down. He whispered and comforted her as he kept his arms holding her tightly.
“Dad, look, we both know that it’s going to happen one day. And hey, we’re here at the range so we might as well talk about it right?”
“That’s the thing though, we aren’t them.” Dakota says. “And we shouldn’t have to me, it’s why I decided to go, because they let us have that choice. I could have said no, but the thought of being left behind, I don’t like it. Besides, I wasn’t lying when I said Tommy can’t stay out of trouble. If we end up going public as a team, someone has to be there to help clean up his messes.”
“He needs to stop telling you those stories.” Steve said just as they heard a small explosion from the other room. The two took off toward the kitchen only to see Tony, Tommy, and Kielar hiding behind the counter while the microwave was smoking. “What happened?”
Jean Luc LeBeau always knew life would not be easy after taking Remy in as his son. He knew it would be hard when he had to banish his son on his own wedding day. He knew when his son became an X-men that life would still not get any easier for them, but at least his boy had found a place in life where he fit, where he truly belonged. When he came home with a wife, and expecting their first child, he knew things would continue to be difficult, but he also knew that his son was happy, and he would support him in a way that he didn't when he was younger.
For James, this was calm. They weren’t getting into trouble as long as Francis remained with Azari, but they weren’t the only members of the team there. Unfortunately, that meant trouble would most likely brew soon. It was as though his sister, Mara Romanov, had read his mind at that moment, as she sauntered over to his partners, leading Francis into the crowd. Azari crossed his arms and huffed, but made his way back to James a few seconds after.
Bruce Banner was the last to enter the room where the others were meeting. Having dropped of his son’s in the room below them where all the other teenagers had been left.	 As he walked in, all eyes went to the scientist who let out a sigh. “Sorry, Devon wasn't very cooperative,” he told them. “You know it is really tense down there with all those kids. Did anyone give them an explanation at all?”
“That would be an understatement. A problem? That would be something that could easily be solved. But no, that organization unlawfully imprisoned my brother for 2 years. We were 14 when they took him. Do you understand this Cap?” Devon asked. “Do you understand that this organization took my brother because of the word of a filthy, corrupt, abusive, politician? I know you have all the files on what they were told, but I can guarantee you that man lied to get my brother taken away, for the simple fact that we were not his by blood.Something we didn’t even know until…”
“Fast asleep. Didn’t even know anyone else was here. Still wanted to see you before bed. I don’t know why you left him here with me. You should be with him.”
“Maybe he should get a better friend.” Johnny said, rubbing his head. “He’s an instigator, and Kielar isn’t even here; he's over at the Starks, again.”
“Des.” James said, trying to get her attention. She looked at him, tears pouring down her face. The room was silent, shock taking over the all.
“My friend wants to know if you are single James” Mara said to her brother. “Not entirely sure what he sees in you, but he asked me to ask you.”
“But you’re planning on going alone, that's too dangerous. What if you get caught? You have a son now, what will happen with him?” Johnny questioned.
Last chapter! I hope you have all enjoyed this as much as I have enjoyed writing it. It has been 12 years since I have really written and this felt amazing to put on here. So, enjoy!
“Alright Sarah, what are you specifically looking for tonight?” She asked as she brought up a hologram from her watch showing her all of the intruders activities.
“Azari, my sister has no interest in Francis other than as a friend. Francis..” he paused and started again. “Has stripped,”
“Well, if Tommy is going, I obviously have to go.” Dakota said. “There is no telling what kind of trouble he would get into if left on his own in California. Kielar just goes along with whatever the idiot has planned.”
She walked back out and to the kitchen. After making her tea she took a seat at the table.It had become a routine to do this before bed. The tea helped her relax and she was able to sleep after having a cup. Dakota looked back towards the hall where the light was bright from Tommy’s room, and she could hear laughing from the two friends. She knew she had made the right choice to go with them. She looked down at her watch as it started beeping, alerting her that someone was in the system of Stark Tower. “Just in time, Happy, let them see the files for Today, September 15, 2038.” She said and waited for the AI to respond.
Tony nodded as he glanced around the room and tossed down a few other files. “We are not going to go directly through the X-men. There are several students who have been kicked out recently or are looking for alternative training that have been sent out invitations.” Tony said. “We have Desiree LeBeau, Sarah  Ross, Isaac Allerdyce, James Howlett Jr., Charmaine, Kestral, and Jayson Kinney-Guthrie, Heather and Eliza.” he said. “We are also bringing in two additional teachers, Bucky Barnes and Daken.”
The eighteen year old stopped just outside a small coffee shop. “I have to go now Mother. It was very nice speaking to you, maybe we can get lunch before I leave for California,” he suggested and stopped to listen to her. “Of Course, that sounds lovely. I love you as well.” He ended the call and walked into the coffee shop, stopping at the door and giving it a quick glance before spotting the person he was looking for. The girl had her hair in a ponytail, with her bangs framing her face and a pair of dark sunglasses. She would have looked like any other teenager in there if her bangs hadn’t been pure white against her brunette hair. “Desiree.” He greeted as he approached her.
The Barton's go and talk a bout the decision Francis already made. Also, learn a bit about Francis and Mara's beginnings.
“I think the coach is well aware of Kielar leaving the team Sue, maybe not the cheerleaders. He made that decision at the beginning of the year though. He tried to play through but you know how he is, if he doesn't want to do it he won’t.” Reed told her.
“It was a mission, I didn’t think you would want me to just drop what I was doing and take a nap” Francis looked at everyone. “So what is exactly happening..”
“Careful kid.”  Bucky called out shaking his head, only speaking to air as Kielar disappeared back into the night. “They’re going to kill me if they find out.” he said to himself before going inside. He sat at a desk with a communicator in his hand and leaned back. “Daken, keep an eye out for the speedster okay? He’s heading back into the city and will be approaching Xavier’s.”
“Tony. believe it or not a guy and a girl can be just friends.” Natasha said. “Francis is a very good friend to Mara. He knows he would lose a hand if he touched her, and being an archer he requires both of them in tact. Clint had this conversation with him already.”
“Ah will.” She shut the steel door and covered it back up before leaning against the wall and shutting her eyes. “Ah love ya’ll more than ah ever thought ah would.” she told herself before taking a deep breath and heading upstairs. As she moved into the living room she heard movement around the back of the house, and saw lights shining in through the windows. She sat on the couch, waiting for them to barge in. As the soldiers filed in with their guns pointed at her. “Ain’t it a lil late for ya’ll to stop by? Ah ain't got no refreshments for ya’ll” A flashlight shone in her face as she stood up.
“You could have left, you could have taken your little team and left, you have diplomatic immunity.” Jade said. “So you can take your…”
“I think you’re losing your touch old man.” Francis laughed as they walked back to the car. “At Least you know who I was taught by, if it were from anyone but you, you would be offended, but I really did learn from the best.” He told his dad, as he bumped shoulders with him.
The young man known as Azari stepped out of stark tower with his phone pressed against his ear. As soon as he had left, he called his mother, Ororo, who resided at Xavier’s School for the Gifted as a long time teacher and a leader to the X-men. It had been some time since he had gone to the school, usually it had just been visits for a few weeks during the summer and of course on holidays. Most of his time growing up had been spent in Wakanda, even after his parents divorce. He had been lucky, though his parents were separated, they were still very civil with each other and it had definitely made things easier for him as a boy. The distance had been hard, he had always been close to his mother, but he loved Wakanda too much to leave it permanently.
“That would be because nobody knows about him at Xavier’s.” Daken told them. He paused and took a deep breath as he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked over at Bucky who just gave him a small nod before Daken turned and left with his son.
“We can at least take our kids to the new facility and invite others to join us.” Natasha offered. “Get a head start on their training.”
“We appreciate you bringing Karla back to us.” He said and left down the hall, hoping to catch Johnny before he potentially left. Ben followed.
“One more truck, assist Rebel. She's over exerting herself and we need her to stay with us.” his brother called to him. James looked around for the girl before catching sight of a glowing vehicle and Desiree moving back from it. James moved to her and touched her arm, she swirled around ready to fight.
“His name is Josh Foley, he’s a healer and they are sending him as our doctor for the facility. I”m not entirely sure when they will be there, Daken said he would be picking each kid up that accepted the invitation, he wouldn’t say how he intended to do that.”
“I swear to you, if those are your bow ties and you are calling it an issue, I’m going to burn them. All of them.” Devon said, not looking up from his phone until he heard a gasp from his brother, to which he gave him a glance and rolled his eyes at the offended look on the other boys face. “I can’t believe you even wear those.”
“What about her? The face of mutants, the one who put up such a damn fight to give all of us so much attention?” Jade asked pointing to Desiree who was sitting against a tree.
“Go two streets over and load onto the jet.” He ordered, “Lead the others and get them to safety. We have your back.” He assured her as he grabbed the next person as the girl jumped down. She looked around her at the fire and bodies in the street, the reality of the night hitting her hard, Jade Summers reached up and touched the collar around her neck. As she pulled herself from her own daze she caught sight of a soldier coming toward her.
“They turn black when they are on. Your Uncle James helped fund a place in Canada with the help of Stark industries, we’ll be safe there. Your sister can get the help she needs and we…”
Looking down at the surface in front of her she picked up a piece of cloth, and a knife, carefully wiping it down. Mara stared at it for a moment before sighing and placing the knife back down and rolling the entire pack up, slipping it into her bag. She looked up as she heard a knock on the door and opened it. “Yes?” She questioned seeing her brother, James standing there.
“Us LeBeau’s don’ go down wit’out a fight” Luc said joining the hug. “An’ we sure as hell don’ let nobody hurt our family.”
“How exactly are we supposed to get the X-men to agree to this?”Natasha asked. “And we are missing a few members of our own team, where are Thor, Pietro and Wanda?”
“You try saying no to a kid with that much determination. I don’t see you telling your brother to back the fuck up.” Bucky countered. “And you have more kids with you. Can’t say no to them?” he paused. “I know you just rolled your fucking eyes at me Daken.”
So he ran. He ran as fast as he could, his shoes not lasting very long at the velocity he was going. The route they told him to take was one that would throw anybody off, but in a matter of minutes he was at a compound in Canada. As he slid to a stop, he fell back, and made no movement to stand up again. He remained in the same spot until he felt someone stand over him. “You okay kid?” the voice asked. Kielar knew that voice, it was so recognizable, but he just didn’t have the energy to move, or speak now. “You're safe. We knew this would happen sooner or later. Let’s get you inside Kielar.” the man said as he lifted the teen up with ease.
A moment later Johnny’s vision blurred and he went down without warning. When he opened his eyes again, Reed held Sue’s unconscious body in his arms as he sat up. “Where is she? Where is Karla?”
“The president. At 11:59 tonight Martial law was declared in the state of New York. Get Kielar out of there as soon as possible. They are taking mutants from their homes.”
“I told him not to take it out. It is just for emergencies.” Mara said, speaking up as she walked into the room. “Hello Papa.”
“Thats impossible my dad had that…” Jade said started. “They knew about the blade. They…” she trailed off.
“I don’t know what you are talking about Aunt Nat. everything we do is perfectly legal and we would never put ourselves in harm's way.” Francis told her.
“Okay, so I am finding this to be the greatest thing ever. They didn’t even want me around. S.H.I.E.L.D literally tried to stop my creation and now they want me to be on a team THEY create. What kind of bullshit is this?” Tommy asked. “And they are not going anywhere near Kielar. And if that bastard Johnny Storm tries to sign anything requiring Kie to go, well, they’re going to really wish they had…”
Dakota Potts worked endlessly to make sure those coming in were as comfortable as possible. She finally had a moment to sit behind her computer, she pulled up the West Coast Avengers Compound and watched the feed of it being raided earlier. She leaned back in her chair and let out a sigh of relief seeing that it was empty. Dakota wasn’t sure if it was because they had warning, or they had all just gone out for the night, but she was relieved. “Where are you?” She whispered to herself before she hacked into surveillance cameras throughout L.A. “Got you.” she said, continuing to talk to herself as she erased the footage of her friends from any of the cameras. When she got to the last one and saw where they were she smiled. “You better contact me as soon as you can Mara.”
“Ah ain’t gone Rogue in a long tahme, and as nahce as dat has been Remy...ah have to also protect meh family, ya’ll are what ah live for.” She smiled as she turned to her son. “Luc, y’ take care of all them until ah get back.” She put her hand on his cheek. “And ah will be back with ya’ll...so go...Jean Luc, Henri, don’t let meh boys do nothin’ stupid.”
“His name is Tommy.” Bruce sighed. “And no, I’m pretty sure he just stole those off the counter. I met up with Logan not long ago and he had a girl with him, about your age. She had baked a lot of extra so she left some behind.”
Now in their family room there were four of them. Ben Grimm had opted out of tonight's dinner and instead remained at his own home with his family. Sue smiled seeing Reed walk into view. “Well, I guess I will let this slide since we haven’t sat down to eat yet. Karla is still in her room. The game ran longer than usual, and apparently Kielar skipped out on the game again.” his wife informed him.
“We could have used your help at Xavier’s you know” Jade spoke up after the silence had taken over. “Most of this could have been prevented if you all had shown up there.”
The door opened to a small two bedroom apartment. It was nothing fancy, just a very comfortable home.Bruce walked in, followed by his son’s. Sometimes it still felt weird that he was a father, it wasn’t a concept that he could just grasp at times, but here he was. He had never questioned it, though Tony had immediately done a DNA test on them, which had come back with the results he had been expecting. What he hadn’t expected was for the courts to order them to live with him. Their mother had tried to fight that, he had expected no less from Anastasia. She was a good woman that loved them both, it was a rough situation all around.
“Ah have t try really hard.” She started, “Ah’m an empath, it's why ah wasn’t in da meeting. Ah feed off of da emotions around me and raght now dere are a lot of strong ones. It's why ah stick around Izzy and Jimmy so much. Ah was briefly around Jade when we saved those from the trucks, and ah could feel da anger pourin’ off of her, so ah thought it best ah don’t stir dat pot no more din it needed to be. Ah was watchin and listenin’ though, she made a few people kinda twitchy. She’s always had dat effect though.”
“Funny, mos’ people mistake meh f’r da devil, not Jesus.” Desiree gave a small smile. “Meh names Desiree, ah know we ain’t officially met.”
“Here is your shield.” Francis smiled, quickly covering up what he was about to say. “I always keep them on hand when we are away from home. Be careful, don’t let him get you into too much trouble.” he handed James a miniature shield that James immediately enlarged to the correct size.
The two stood up and hugged each other, remaining for a moment. “I will see you again soon. Behave. I do not want to hear of another riot.” Azari smiled as he started walking toward the door.
“I had a feeling they would target your team and I wanted to be here in case that happened okay? They already took Dad and Pops, and Kielar had to run, I just...I ...I needed to make sure you were okay.” Tommy mumbled the last part, and James let out a small sigh, his shoulders relaxing. ‘That thing in the park wasn’t planned okay? I just, they started saying shit about Kielar and I am not okay with that. It, it’s just been a long night.”
Laura walked out of the cabin on the defense as she heard sounds coming toward them. Aislin was at her side while she had Kestrel and Jayson stay with Charmaine. Her claws came out of her hands as she crouched down. Aislin brought out her own claws and moved to a similar position. It only took a moment before Laura stood up rolling her eyes. “It's only Akihiro and his boy toys.”
“Well, I’m not against you, and we’ll have more of a chance if we stick together. Power in numbers right?” she asked. “I still won’t hold back.”
“Oh don’t even start when you have history with that boy scout.” Daken rolled his eyes. “And I really don’t have time for this. Yes Johnny and I slept together about...25 years ago. It was what it was,.”
There were very few lights left on in the tower when it struck midnight. Steve had been in bed reading until he realized the time and went to get his husband from the lab. As he walked down the stairs, he heard the music playing as Tony worked.  Steve walked in and cut the music off, immediately catching the other man’s attention. “It’s midnight, you aren’t staying in here all night Tony.” Steve said.
It had taken a while to get used to seeing Johnny as a father. When Crystal had come to him to care for the twins, she had been very open about the reason, and that she was trusting Johnny. In retrospect, Pietro Maximoff had screwed up and Crystal no longer trusted him with raising children. It still blew Reeds mind that she had gone back to her ex husband. Though, it had been a blessing for Johnny. He had grown up and taken responsibility for two humans that weren’t biologically his. It had made both Sue and Reed proud.
“I’m already planning on packing when I get back to Xavier’s and wait for the phone call back in Louisiana. I am gonna assume they will be sendin’ letters to each parent, considerin’ I’m under age, Papa is gonna need to be asked.”
“Ah’m sorry f’r ya’s as well M’sieur Richards.” Desiree said, lifting her head for a moment. “Ah appreciate ya coming here, and helping us, even after everything.”
As Tony cleaned his lab for the night, the teenagers were both sound asleep in their beds. For a while Kielar tossed and turned, this mind racing while he tried to sleep.  Suddenly the boy shot straight up in his bed. “KARLA!” he called out for his sister in a panic. “No, no, no…” he repeated as his body picked up speed in his sudden terror. Moving quicker than he expected, he moved through the wall and into his friend's room. The sudden appearance and cross into the dresser made Tommy jump up.
“I’m irreplaceable Pops, besides I like being an older brother. Even if he is breakable.” James said. Steve laughed and rolled his eyes. “Look I heard stories from Uncle Bucky about you with no muscle trying to take on everyone.”
“I can get us there pretty quick. But it’ll have to be one at a time. My guardian told me exactly where to go. I will also have to eat something after the second trip because it will take a lot out of me to run that much.” Kielar explained to them.
“No, I  just grabbed him and lowered him, I  pinned him down to keep him from moving anymore, he came in through the wall, something spooked him.” Tommy told them. “He hasn’t lost control like that in years.”
“We have a medical set up to check you for any injuries, please move to the right and wait for any assistance.” Vivienne told those moving off the jet. Being one of the first to arrive, she had settled in and offered to help in any way that she could. She kept her eyes peeled for anyone she may know from Xavier’s, and when a familiar red head stepped off, she let out a relieved sigh. “Jade!” She called out, and the other girl immediately went to her, the two embracing.
“You told me to stop you if I thought you were going to hurt yourself. We have them, they’re going to be safe and we are going back to the compound. We can get you isolated so you can get your emotions in check.” James told her. “No more fighting.” The two remained silent for a moment as six more mutants moved past them, and Daken followed them. “When we are in the air, we can have Hades get rid of the trucks, if you do anything else you will be compromised.”
“I did, now where are those shoes?” Kielar asked. It didn’t take long to find where Tony had stored the items Kielar needed. Dressed in a new pair of shoes, sweats and a hoodie, he turned to the only other person he had at the moment and gave him a nod. “I’ll see you soon.”
Second to last chapter everyone! I hope you have enjoyed reading everything. This is the first in a series introducing the characters. This set was the Avengers and their kids, I have many more to write.
“Don’t be so cocky.” Kestrel rolled her eyes at her uncle before looking over at Bucky and Johnny. “Really, two of ‘em?”
As the armored glove disappeared, the helmet surrounded his head. “Hey Jarvis, just so I am no longer talking to myself, you have any idea where I am?” he questioned
“I mean its speculated, they are always together. You didn’t know?” She asked him. “It’s the big gossip at school right now since the picture circulated. Kielar hasn’t really spoken to me much since then.” Karla admitted.
The nightclub was loud, lights flashing as the music blared through the speakers. People were on the dance floor moving and having a good time. Amongst the crowd was James Rogers, the son of Captain America and Black Widow, also the only sober one amongst his team. It had been their night off, so for him it wasn’t an issue, it wasn’t like he could get drunk, anyway. He watched his partners out on the dance floor, one of them amused by the other's antics. Azari Evan glanced over at James shaking his head, but had a smile on his face, before the young Wakandan prince turned back to Francis Barton, who was clearly not ashamed of letting loose for the night.
He knew the Avengers. He had known them his entire life, and while he wasn’t particularly close to the other teenagers, they weren’t going to expect him to be the best,or maybe he just hoped they wouldn’t. He loved his dad, he really did but it was a lot to live up to, and it just wasn’t for him. James knew that the world would one day expect him to be the new Captain America, probably even other young heros.
“I don’t dance Azari, I told you this before we came here. I am here to supervise.” the redhead told him, leaning over and giving him a quick kiss. “But you just like to get your way, Prince.”
Their history with each other drew them close, much like the other four team members were. Their connections to S.H.I.E.L.D was something common, but their friendships were built on much more than that. Which was why they had forced Blaine out of his lab to get ice cream. Of all things that could get the eighteen year old out of the lab, it was anything sweet. That was how they ended up at Danny’s Ice cream shop weekly. That is also how most of the workers knew them by name.
The young adult had just found out that Phil Coulson was not her biological father and had stepped back from S.H.I.E.L.D rather easily. They had tried to convince her to stay, but to no avail. It was something she had been determined to do. Since she left, she was on better terms with Agent Coulson, but still refused all attempts at getting her to return. She had grown up wanting to be an agent and now wanted to step away and be her own person.
“I’m glad that is how I am coming off. I don’t need people to know that I am not okay right now.” He said. “But, I am better than I was. Bucky got work from this team he knows and they were able to rescue some of those taken, Karla was one of them. I know she’s alive but, I still can’t…” he taps the side of his head. “The link isn’t there and it hurts. It's like a part of me is gone. I really need to see her and make sure she’s really okay.”
“I...you’re welcome Blaine” Tony said before looking at his friend who was no help to him and shrugged.
“I’m going to make S.H.I.E.L.D do what they said they would do. They said that this team was protected, that our parents were protected, and if they want me on their side, they better hold their end of the goddamn deal.”
That had been another shock, he had known that Daken had changed over the years, especially since he had connected with Fantastic 4 all those years ago. Seeing him again, brought back more memories than he knew he had, having shoved them to the back. Seeing him with a young boy, brought back memories of his own kids being young, and brought forward regrets. He heard some of the kids from Xavier’s School talking about how a speedster saved them. He heard the West Coast Avengers talking when they got there, called Kiela their captain America, even though he operated on the east coast with Tommy Stark.
“They’re harmless, they literally climb buildings and eat.” Dakota shrugged. “I really don’t see a threat.” she paused, “oh look they’re live!  I’m going to hook it to the T.V.”
“So what are we going to do, if they are publicly executing the X-men…” Mara Romanoff asked. “We can’t just sit back and let it keep happening. Those two are big names, they're trying to make an example out of them.”
“You know Dev, one day, I’m going to find someone in this world that finds me absolutely adorable, and you are going to wish you chose to dress as fashionably as I do.” Blaine smiled. “Now, help me out, which bow ties am I taking with me. “
“That made you sound like a pompous jerk.” Dakota shook her head. “But luckily I actually know you, and know that you didn’t mean it like that.”
He was a proud man, Jean Luc, and everyone knew it. When his grandson was born, and he was named after him, he cried, just a little. He was so proud of how far his son had come in life. When the second child came, Desiree, he knew that she was going to be the one to test them, from the moment she learned the word “No” and that her father would do anything for her.
“Mara, I just want to make sure everyone is safe, and Francis is shirtless,” He told his sister as he motioned to the mentioned. “Francis come take a break.” he called up to him, but was seemingly ignored. Mara smiled, crossing her arms and offering him no help, so he climbed up on stage. “Francis, let’s take a..” he paused again as Francis started dancing with him, a huge grin on his face.
A gush of wind blew past them and Kielar stood before the two once more. “Alright she is safe. I had her all set up and introduced to the ones that were already there. Renee? your next.”
“No. Listen to me. You have not done anything wrong. They are not in the right here and we are not handing you over to these people. We’ve talked about this, and you know exactly what to do. You were trained and you are good. Steve would not have handed you his shield if he didn’t believe in you. So, no matter what happens, you run, you go to the location I had you memorize and you stay there. They can’t touch you there and they won’t. “
“Because we didn’t know this would happen.” Dakota Potts stepped in. “We knew that it could potentially happen and Tony wanted to make sure that there was a place for Kielar to go so he could be safe. We don't have many mutants within the Avengers but..”
“:I don’t like Flit being out there without me.” She said immediately. “I don’t like all the discourse here. That girl was lucky I didn’t throw a knife at her idiotic face.”
Kielar sat in the meeting room with a large pair of headphones on, lost in the loud music he didn’t notice Desiree LeBeau take a seat next to him. She waited a moment and tried to get his attention before she tapped him on the shoulder. He jumped, nearly falling out of his chair and ripped the headphones off. “Jesus you scared me.”
Everyone scattered to prepare for their departure. Jean Luc moved with his boys to get the necessities they needed for the trek through the tunnels that would lead them outside the city. As he held the bag, Henri and Remy filled it with flashlights and batteries, while a second bag was filled with medical supplies. “Ya boys get the family out..”
“The Fantastic four can be left out for all I care,” Steve said. “After what happened with Kielar I highly doubt that they will want any part of what we do.” he crossed his arms, obviously angry with what had taken place between him and the other team.
“I did that because we do not know what is safe anymore. Do you not realize the kind of shit happening right now?” Dakota asked them holding up her tablet. “This is footage of the Baxter Building.” She said before going to the next video. “This is Stark Tower, The Avengers compound in upstate New York. Drone footage from the Guthrie farm in Kentucky.” She continued. “And that is just a few places. West coast facilities have been hit as well. This place won’t hold everyone.”
“Can go fight. I ain’t runnin’ from this Mama.” Jayson told her getting up. “We gotta get this taken care of before more people get hurt, Aislin and Kestrel agree. Charmaine is a bit of a pacifist but I’m sure she would agree too.”
Daken made his way down the hall toward the hangar after the meeting. The last thig he needed to worry about was Laura and her kids being out there when the government had the murasama blade in their hands. It was one thing to lose Logan, but it would be another if he lost his sister, nieces and nephew. He heard two sets of footsteps behind him and knew exactly who they were, but he kept moving. There was no time for him to stop when all hell was breaking loose in the states.
“Three if you count Mara.” Azari motioned to her as she began dancing again. “Let loose, it's our only night out.”
“Meeting dismissed, we have 3 days before any of us leave. Dakota, your mom is already at the new facility so if you choose to go you will be going with us.” Tony said.
“Not without ya’ll” Remy said standing up. Ain’t having ya’ll arrested for protecting us, we all go, nobody is bein’ left behind. “Luc’ ya grab a backpack, Seb ya do da same, Papa, Henri, we should gather some necessities.”
"Is it the same way you found out about this entire thing?”  Azari only received a nod from her. “Than I will not ask anything else.” he stopped speaking while he glanced over the files, seeing each of the photos. He paused at the red headed boy for a moment. Desiree watched him with a smile. “Don’t you dare.”
“We should see what they have to say at least, the organization has changed over the years.” Natasha spoke up. “I think it should be completely up to the children.”
“I’m in.” James told them. “Look, I don’t like that S.H.I.E.L.D is heading this operation. But I think it’s a good idea for us to know the heroes that we may join up with in the future. I’ve known about Barton because of Mara, but I don’t know much about him, I know the people in this room, and I don’t think it’s enough. We all read about the events that have happened in the past, maybe working with these groups will be better. We don’t need any repeats. I for one have heard about the kids kicked out of Xavier’s. Pretty sure one punched Scott Summers in the face.”
James then did something that neither brother did very often and pulled Tommy into a hug. He didn’t say anything, and when he felt the smaller boy's arms wrap around him, all the anger and frustration he had felt left. “Let’s get you back to the safe house.” he said quietly. When he didn’t receive a response and realized Tommy's arms had fallen to his side, he let out a light laugh, realizing his brother had fallen asleep. He lifted him up and headed toward the safe house.
“I am not leaving you behind.” Kitty told him firmly. “There is no way I am leaving you here, you know exactly where they will take you if you get caught and I will not have that happen.”
“Wait, they went there too!?” Renee asked wide eyed. “I never thought they would try and tough the Fantastic four or the Avengers.”
True to his word, they were loading a short time later, and as they were exiting, Reed pulled Johnny aside. It wasn’t a second later before Reed had his arms around Johnny as the man broke down. Daken stopped in his tracks and looked over at them, frozen in place. “What happened?” Bucky asked him.
“I’m just finishing up.” Tony replied and went back to his work. The soldier moved toward the scientist and put his hand on top of his.
Bucky was at his wits end, he did not sign up to deal with over emotional teenagers when Steve came to him about taking a shift at the Canadian compound they created. He didn’t say no, of course he didn’t, and they knew he wouldn’t if Steve asked him. Then, everything happened. Now four of the kids, yes kids because he was old, had run off to yell at S.H.I.E.L.D, a few had locked themselves in their rooms, which he didn’t blame them at all for, it was what Bucky wanted to do himself.
“We’re practically family Kielar. And that is what family does.” Dakota smiled. “So, why don’t you sit down and try to locate the other half of the Avengers in California. I found James, Azari, Francis and Mara. We are still going to have to find Blaine, Devon, Nicole and Ryan. Their photos are right here if you need them. They were not at the compound when it was raided so we need to trace their footsteps and remove anything caught on camera, because we won’t be the only ones looking for them.”
Everything happened so fast, and usually when Tommy Stark described things like that it was an exaggeration. From the moment he was woken up by his friend, to the moment he disappeared, he was moving, still half asleep. When the gunfire had begun, it woke him up as Steve shielded him from any bullets. Then he had heard the command, one that he could never disobey. He was being told to leave, to leave his dads. He listened to Kielar try to argue; he watched him disappear, and then Tony slapped a bracelet on Tommy's wrist and activated one of the iron man suits.
“I don’t think you want to do that.” She said, hands up as she continued to hold the shield. “Now, you are going to explain exactly what you are doing, invading MY home!” Sue yelled.
“I’m always ready to get back to your child, he’s a lot more pleasant to be around than you.” she snorted. “Everyone’s had water and we can get this trip over with. You need a shower” Heath smiled at him before turning around, her tail swishing back and forth as she headed to the jet.
It didn’t take long for the group to get back on the jet and settled. Daken sat down in the pilot seat and put on the headset. “Whoa, slow down. Okay, Dakota. Slow down. We are on our way back now. Okay. We should be there soon, we aren’t far from the border. We have to pick others up but we have someone who is injured. Yes, Johnny will be with us. Okay.”
“They have a message board.” Dakota said. “They talk so much crap about some of those teachers on there. You should have seen Ben Worthington after LeBeau and Ross got a hold of him.”
“Isn’t it obvious, Azari gave it to them, he’s the only one who would have any access.” Jade told them. “You think just because you are a Prince..”
“We’re ordering chinese before your Mom or Tony attempts to cook for everyone. You want your usual?” He asked. “Are you okay?”
“I can contact someone so that the ones who passed can be buried properly. But we need to go. I know where there is a station set up for us to go into hiding for…”
“That is the thing, it will not just be our children. They want us to mix with the next generation of X-men, Defenders and Fantastic 4” Tony told them.
Anna rushed into the room. “Go now!” She called to them as she shut the doors and followed them all into the basement. “Dey ain’t here to hold back Rem.” She told her husband as they reached the hidden tunnel in the basement. “Ah need ya t’ get everyone t safety. Ya look after our boy and ya find our girl.”
“They overreacted.” Francis laughed. “We just needed proof, they caught me on the way out. Made sure Mara got out of there though.”
“What happened to Natash, Steve and Tony? They were arrested? Why...they wouldn’t hand Kielar over, and Tommy got away. Okay. What about Nat? No word from her, has dad...no, I haven’t. Okay. just, be safe. Bye.”
“No, it's not but we had a sizable number of people there. Do you know how many were killed? Taken? You didn't have to see them die. You…” her voice broke as she spoke. “They didn’t all get out. I don’t even know what happened to my mom and dad.”
“Hi.” A new voice said from behind them. “My name's Dakota Potts, Kielar would have shown you around but something came up so he asked me to do the tour.” The redhead girl stated before she could be questioned. “I arrived with some of the other Avengers kids, you three came from Xavier’s right? We have some of the others over here. So when your friend is done puking I can take you to them.”
Daken waited for the tires to blow on the vehicle before motioning for the team to move in. The sound of the metal hitting the concrete made him wince and saw his brother do the same. As the soldiers climbed out of the vehicles, he watched as his team went into fight mode. He moved to the back of the trucks and popped his claws before cutting open the side of the vehicle to let the captured mutants out. He reached his hand in and felt someone grab hold of him, as he pulled the person out he realized they had found the mutants taken from Xavier’s School for the gifted. The red head looked at him with wide eyes as she was pulled out.
“If we had known about this place we wouldn’t be so scattered in the first place.” Jade snapped. “And you can’t tell me none of you knew this wasn’t going to happen because you knew exactly where to find us. I want to know why we weren’t told of this so that we could save people.”
“They will also try to alter what I am doing. They do it every time, and they team up against me.” Tony argued.
Mutants. Since the discovery of their existence we have regarded them with fear, suspicion and often hatred. With time there had been improvement. The fear of some, turned to understanding, discussion brought to light alternative views, and it was time that brought many together. But it only takes one to bring that fear back. Inciting fear to the mass majority, causing panic to spread. Neighbors would turn to each other, and hate crimes once again rising. Children being cast out of their families, their friends turning on them. It only took one man.
“Language.” Kielar suddenly said, before he remembered that other people were in the room. Tony, Tommy and James all laughed while Steve sighed and shook his head.
The words made Tommy freeze for a moment. He looked down at the time on his phone, reading the time as 10 a.m. Letting out a groan, in realizing how early it still was, and that this guy would not shut up, he moved across the street to get a better look. The crowd was definitely larger than he expected it to be, but still wasn’t very impressive. He stayed in the back, leaning against a tree as the man spewed more out.
This was why, instead of Germany, he was in L.A, looking for his older brother James. He was tired, that was a fact, and he needed to conceal his identity. Luckily for him, when people saw Tommy, he was usually in high fashion, with makeup and nails done, not sweats and an old baggy t-shirt, with his hair tousled in every direction. Kielar would not be happy with him, but he could take Kielar’s wrath, he could never stay angry at him long. He would have to focus on that later, he would see Kielar later and they could hash everything out. It would be fine.
“So what now?” a deeper voice spoke up from the back. David Drake stood up and crossed his arms. “Because I can tell you right now there is now way I am going to sit back and watch the American government take mutants. I don’t know where my parents or sisters are, but I know what I am going to do.”
“So we are taking a break and will let you know as soon as we get settled in next month” Francis told them. “This is Bow ,”
“But the X-men won’t go down without a fight right? They know how to take care of this kind of thing...they..” Kielar started, worry dripping as he spoke.
“I don’t want them to hurt you Tony. If you don’t let them take me they could hurt you.” Kielar said, emotion pouring out as he spoke. Tony pulled him into a hug.
“Well be prepared to make fifty of them Kie. Because we will all want one if Mom is the cook.” James laughed.
“No , No, I’m fine. Did you say a speedster? We don’t have a speedster? And since when do they let LeBeau out on the streets to handle things, I thought all of that was a publicity stunt?”
“Me neither, I’m just worried it might be too soon for some of them, but some of the Xavier students have already contacted Pepper, and that might be helpful for a few of our kids.” Tony told him. “Do you know when Bucky, Daken and the other guy they added are going to
Tony sat in his living room with Tommy, Kielar, James, Dakota and Mara. While most of them had left, these five lived under his roof, more or less. Steve and Natasha walked in and sat next to Tony as the kids waited for the discussion they knew was coming. Kielar slouched down into the couch and leaned his head back, closing his eyes during the wait. Tommy had taken his hand and rubbed the back of it with his thumb.
“Ah wouldn’t say it was convenient sugah, someone had to be alongside dat wild child of deres, he’s too chaotic t’ be out in da world on his own, if ya have down than think of it that they had an opportunity to have a babysitter for Iron Lad.” She said. Kielar let out a laugh which made Desiree laugh as well. The two then fell into a comfortable silence with each other.
“Rini!” she suddenly heard Vivienne call from an entryway. “Over here, you’ll freeze if you stay outside.” The younger girl ran over to the other and she stepped inside rubbing her arms. “This place is incredible. I don’t know how we didn't know about it.”
“You are jealous.” Sue told him. “Tony has done so much for Kielar, so has Steve. You should be a little more grateful for the two of them. Your son has a place he can go after your fights with him. You know it isn’t his fault he looks like Pietro, or that he has similar powers. You knew the moment you took the twins in that it was a possibility. I don’t know why you want to fight now, when they are almost out of high school.”
“I knew about the meeting before it happened.” Azari admitted and everyone turned to the eighteen year old standing off to the side. “I was suggested that it might be about a new initiative that was brought to the Avengers table.”
“I know you’re there” Tommy called out from somewhere in the room. “I have a motion detector near the door that let’s me know when someone approaches.”
Daken and James sat on the floor silently, listening to their sister scold them like children. James leaned over to his brother. “This is why she was always his favorite.” he told him and Daken nodded in confirmation.
“It wasn’t without trying.” Daken mumbled and moved toward the cabin. Before he could open the door Kestrel walked out and hugged him immediately. “Hey kid.”
“Yes.” Kielar responded quickly. “Sorry about that.” He told the others. “We’re just working on a few things before tomorrow.” the boy tried to explain.
“As long as you promise to never broadcast Stark Tower on your blog again.” Tony answered, and the two froze. “And make sure you give that access card back to your dad.”
“I really do hate when she does that.” Azari said, taking the drink that James held out for him. “I mean, I get that they are best friends, but I was dancing with him.”
“You know, if this were any other family, I would be concerned.” James said standing next to Steve with his arms crossed. “I don’t know how you do it everyday, I’m just here when I want to be.”
“They want us to train the next generation.”Steve started speaking again. “What we have read, and spoken about, we believe that everyone in this room would be a good contribution to any future team. They want there to be an alliance between the Avengers, Defenders, Fantastic 4, X-men and S.H.I.E.L.D. In the past these teams have not always seen eye to eye and they believe that bringing everyone together early on, might help forge bonds and help shape a more..”
“Only a few knew about da muramasa blade.” Remy told them as he approached with the rest of the family. “And I t’ink it would be safe t’ assume dat its a mutant dat dey have workin’ wit’ dim.”
Dakota let out an exaggerated sigh. “Could we PLEASE just tell them what we decide so we can go about our business. Some of us have actual things to do other than gossiping about boys.”
James moved through the crowd with Azari close behind him. They reached the small stage that the two had been standing on and Mara smiled down to them. “Hello bratan!” She jumped off the stage. “Have you come to join the fun, or continue to be a stick in the mud.”
“I’ll try to contact the others, get them up to speed on what is happening and make sure they know not to go back.” James said. “Azari?”
Tony had bonded with Kielar in the same way that he had with his own son, and the three were often in the lab together. What had surprised the former Iron-Man, though, was the bond that Kielar shared with Steve. It should not have surprised him though, Kielar was one of those kids that seemed to get along with most adults. While Tony could help keep Kielar’s mind busy with lab work and mechanical building, the training Steve gave him had helped even more. Kielar was after all only half human. His other half was Inhuman, his mother being Crystalia Amaquelin, the Princess of the Inhumans of Attlian. They were still learning what the effect of this would have on him. They knew of the twins older sister Luna, and for so long they had believed that her genetic markers cancelled each other out, making her a normal human. That had been false
There was no such thing as an early night for most New Yorkers. This included the occupants living in the Baxter Building. Long after the sun had gone down, Reed Richards remained in his lab. The living quarters were just a few stories below him where his wife, brother-in-law and niece were. They had agreed to a late dinner, Friday nights were football nights for Karla, so she came home after nine p.m. Kielar had gone to the Starks for the weekend after an argument with Johnny, something that had been escalating for some time. Reed had noted how much time the boy had spent with the other family, but remained silent, hoping that Johnny would attempt to fix things with him. Looking around, he quickly realized he was running late, and Sue would never let him hear the end of that.
“Don’t you have a warrant out for your arrest?” another asked. “they arrested your father last night for harboring and protecting a mutant.”
So today was going to be a serious chat between the two. One that wasn’t nearly as bad as previous visits to the range. No, Francis had already made his decision, and it was based on the fact that he knew his father was going. They just had to talk about the arrangements and rules that were going into place, as well as the S.H.I.E.L.D aspect of it all. Clint parked the car and hit his hand on Francis’ leg to get his attention before the both got out of the car and went to the trunk to grab their weaponry.
Maybe not with a certain red-head, though. Tommy stopped in his tracks as he thought about his pseudo sister. She was going to be the one to worry about. Dakota hated when Tommy pulled stunts like this. The blond made a note to contact her as soon as he could. “Alright TJ focus, don’t worry about Kota, and just...where would James be, stick in the mud James would probably have stayed home on his night off. But he has Francis who is a partier and actually fun. Then Azari, who has a good middle ground between them to be sensible. Mara probably stuck with Francis because he attracts trouble. If news got out about what happened in New York, they would have found a safe place. Come on Tommy you are the smart one in the family, where the fuck would they go.” he whispered to himself as he looked around at his surroundings. “Where the fuck am I exactly?”
Fourteen years have passed since Tony and Steve fought to keep their son. Eleven years since the last time they went on a mission with the Avengers, retiring from the hero life to raise a family. Now, after all that time S.H.I.E.L.D had contacted them with a new mission, one that they almost threw out, and if Pepper had not stopped them, it would have never seen the light of day. The Avengers gathered at Stark tower for the first time since then. Not all of the Avengers had given up the hero life after having children, but when Tony and Steve had left that world, the Avengers moved their base to another location. To them, entering the Tower was something that they knew would happen again one day, but why, that had always been up in the air.
“I would rather not say at this time, just know that it was not malicious in nature.” Azari told them. “The person just likes to be well informed, and is cautious around new people.”
“I am a mutant.” He announced to the room. “I’m not a mutate like the Fantastic 4, in fact, the only connection to them that I have is the fact that Johnny adopted me. I know a few of you knew that..but..” Kielar said, obviously nervous.
“That joke just confirmed what I have been thinking for awhile, too much time with Tommy.” Dakota laughed. “Which means you need to spend more time with me to earn your credits back.” Tommy rolled his eyes.
There were many promises that held their loved one's close to them, worried for their children and what it would mean for them, for their future. Many of them were getting ready to graduate from High school and move forward into the world. They had dreams they wanted to follow. With the news circulating about plans to destroy what they had built, everything would change.
“Going back to the states uncoordinated isn’t going to be a solution. We can’t make any of ya work together. You need to do that.” Ben added.
“Is he a good idea to have around? He’s a loose cannon Steve. I know we agreed to it, but I’m second guessing it.” Tony admitted.
“Vehicle heading north on 42nd Street.” a masculine voice came over the communicators. “Team Alpha is pursuing. Team Beta, continue to watch Xavier’s, and team Omega, try to locate whatever the gust of wind was, we may have a speedster that left Stark Tower.”
“Well we did learn that they were not real bombs. And he has been on the X-men team since that has happened.”Steve said with a sigh. “Look, he will be with us under a probationary period. The X-men offered to give him to us as one of the trainers.”
The other teenagers in the room had peaked his interest. They had a curious way about them and it drew Azari toward them. He loved to watch people, it was a good way of learning about them. He had seen the walls some of them had built up, he had noticed the anxiety that some held, and how relaxed some were. It was an interesting mix and when he looked at them he saw only individuals, not so much a team. He could tell all the siblings would be difficult to work with, they were all very protective of each other in one way or another, some were even very subtle about it.
“I’m not. I don’t dislike the idea, but its another place to be. As long as my family is there I will be fine. There will just be a lot of people I do not know as well, and not knowing them is unnerving.” She admitted.
The silence overtook again as the group fell deep into thought. James moved over to Desiree and sat down next to her, a phone pressed to her ear, “Hey Mama, Papa, Its Des! Ah hope ya’ll are okay, ah know its late but ah just...ah wanted t’ hear ya’lls voices. Ah’m okay. We made it home safe and our friends are wit’ us. Ah love ya’ll.” she said, trying to make her voice more peppy than she felt at that moment. As she hung up her phone she leaned her head against James’ shoulder and shut her eyes. “Ah wish ah coulda done more” she told him tiredly.
“That’s Remy’s brother.” Laura said. “They reported the LeBeau manor gone, but they made it out. They made it out…” she said, relieved. “We need to send a message on the same wave.”
He looked up at a billboard and rolled his eyes seeing the current president's face plastered on it. “Kevin, fucking Kevin Trask, just decides to turn this world upside down. Decides to be SELFISH!” Tommy suddenly yelled. “FUCK YOU KEVIN TRASK!” Tommy dropped down onto the ground, still glaring up at the billboard. “I am in the middle of nowhere because of you. You know, what? I don’t even understand this. Your own father was a mutant, Larry, man you two have boring names. It took three generations for your family to do this. Why couldn’t you have learned from your dad and grandfather's mistakes? You won’t win this you dick. You are just going to piss off the wrong people.” He fired his repulsor ray from his hand, right into the billboard. “Pretty sure you already have.”
“I won’t leave you here.” Blaine told her. “We can leave together. It will be safer. Right?” He asked looking at his friends. Nicole looked at Ryan, as if having a silent conversation with him, a habit they had picked up when they were agents together. “I won’t leave her.” he said firmly.
“Next order of business is to find out who the government has on their side.” Steve said as he crossed his arms.
Vivienne looked around her to see the hallways cleared. “I took care of it. Even if they were alive, nobody will see them again. Rini, this is war now. They made their move, we’re making our stand. They think we will go down without a fight but they’re wrong.” Jett said. “We’re in this together. We aren’t kids anymore. Our parents trained us for this. They knew it could happen, that’s why I stayed behind, and I’m not leaving either of you.”
“I am NOT jealous.” Azari declared. “They just do everything together and this was one night that we could actually dance and be together, not that you would get out there.”
“Because that is where we have friends. Aaron and Dominick. He doesn’t trust a lot of people, but we have known them for some time. They’ll look out for him until he can safely get to us. They’re both mutants, good people and very trustworthy.”
“I...I have worn the uniform quite a few times. Steve and Tony are a big part of my life and their son is training to take over for Iron Man, so it just made sense.”
Slipping his lab coat off, the scientist set it down on his chair before heading to the elevator. Once he arrived on the floor and stepped out, he smiled seeing his family. It had been difficult for a while. Franklin was away more regularly, and they rarely saw Mica. While the home seemed more empty, it remained lively. Karla always expressed herself animatedly, and her stories from her school life entertained them greatly.
The West coast Avengers are not the original team from the comics! I have modified it for the story as it takes place in the future.
“Thank you.” She said allowing him to lift her up in his arms. Within seconds they disappeared  “Once from the mansion’s kitchen once more speeding through New York. Renee tucked her face into Kielar’s chest and wrapped her arms around his neck as they ran. When she looked up, she realized they had stopped outside a large home. “Where, where are we?”
“Wait, as in Desiree? I haven't seen her since she left Xavier’s, She was one of them rescuing taken mutants? I thought she was down in the south, I just heard a rumor around here that the LeBeau’s were compromised and nobody knows where they are, I thought that included…” Vivienne suddenly stopped talking as someone grabbed her arm “Hey!.”
Mara walked back in the room. “Is it okay if Flit finishes the movie with us?” she asked motioning toward her friend.
“Alright Mama.” He responded, not removing his hat from over his eyes as he spoke. “We got Char the medicine ya told us to give her. She went back to sleep so I think the pain is more manageable. Her stitches her holdin’ too. She was talkin’ for a few minutes.”
“I know. Mara will be there though. We stick together. I had a feeling she would have said yes anyway, so I just went ahead and did it. I’m not letting her attend a school without me. You know that is what this pretty much is right? A school for training heroes. We don’t know what kind of people will be showing up and I have to be there for Mar.” he shrugged. “Besides, you’ll be there.”
Over time, the girl's face faded from the media, but her voice was still out there for those who needed it. She never stopped fighting the war that was raging, even though she lost her personal battle. They wanted her to give up. She pushed back in a way they had not expected. Not with violence, but with words. They wanted her to incite fear, but what she gave was hope. They wanted her to divide the mutants and unknowingly brought them together by trying to use the child.
“We asked Pietro and Wanda not to come,” Steve said. “As for Thor, he will not be joining us, and Torrun has already decided that she will not be a part of this.”
“A few years ago I gave Laura  these stud earrings and she wears them all the time. There are trackers in them with the understanding that I wouldn’t constantly check in on her. They would only be used for emergencies, and this is an emergency, besides I am almost positive I know where they would go.” Daken told them both. “So both of you stop.”
“When Desiree went out there with that team sugah, the one thing she asked was that we stay safe so that she could worry less about us. She’s a big girl, and she’s always been a fighter, she’s got a good team with her too.” Anna said, reassuring her son and nephew. She glanced over at her husband who had been quiet. “Remy?”
“I’ll contact your parents as soon as I can, and I’ll keep Shae close to me. You two work together, remember everything we taught you. Don’t underestimate them.” Kitty reminded the two older teens. Cassie quickly moved to her brother and hugged him before she disappeared through the floor, gripping her mother's hand.
“It was fine, how was yours?” Johnny smiled, sitting across from her as Sue sat across from Reed. “These late dinners give Reed an excuse to work later you know, he might not do so well when football season is over.”
James fell face first onto his bed. He was still in Stark tower and probably would be for the next couple of nights. He didn’t detest the idea of going to California, no that part was fine. He wanted to be able to explore different options of training, and with Steve and Tony going as well, he would get that. Growing up he had received self defense at a young age from Steve, and when he was older Natasha took over his training, his dad had been officially retired, though they did spar from time to time. It wasn’t the training or the people, not it was one thing in particular.
For a few moments it was quiet. Everyone just taking in what information they had heard, which really wasn’t a lot. A few of them were calming down from being a bit riled up to begin with. Tommy sat back with his arms crossed as Dakota leaned over and whispered something in his ear to make him roll his eyes, but he also seemed to relax a bit more.
Jett ran over to feel for a pulse, little hope that he would find one, and he didn’t. “Fuck.” he cursed as he stood back up. “They either got the rest of the family or they got away.” He said just before they heard screaming from another corridor. The two teens took off running toward the sound just in time to see ice impale three soldier’s abdomens.
“We can. I’ll call the others in. If you are bringing more people here, we’re going to need some help.” Bucky said with a small smile. “You know, Steve chose the right person. He knew exactly what he was doing when he picked you.” he paused. “Did you really eat all of those already though?”
“Well I guess everything has been decided.” Steve said, “Start packing, we leave in 3 days. We will take care of everything with your schools.”
“Johnny?” Reed’s voice pulled him from his thoughts and he turned to face the man that stood in the doorway. “We’re headed to the meeting room, almost everyone has arrived so we are going to give an update on what is happening.”
A year into his presidency. They hospitalized an adolescent girl about the age of fourteen after being brutally attacked in New Orleans, Louisiana. Reports of the girl being bullied for years surfaced. Her red on black eyes. The media called her the daughter of the devil. The President made accusations that she had provoked the boys, all of them seventeen and eighteen years old. They said she threatened them. They said she used her abilities on them.
“Kielar wants nothing to do with me, and Karla…” he paused. “Kielar needs time with his sister, he won’t go see her with me there. Besides, if you know where they might be, then it should be a quick trip right?”
“I have the facility ready and Pepper is there making sure everything is working and our security is up to standards. I have been in direct contact with her and any upgrades needed will be done before we get there. We have three days to pack.” Tony informed them.
“It’s something that I took upon myself to learn. When I found out Pete wasn’t my biological father, I started making a family tree. I felt that it was pretty important to know the history. When I got done with my own, I started branching out to others. It’s a jumbled mess honestly. Especially when you bring in the clones and alternate timelines.”
As he turned each page, he recognized several of the photos he passed. “They picked very talented students, unique choices as well.” he commented. “Were you aware that James’ older brother was offered a position as a trainer?”
She remained in a coma for two months, unable to defend herself. Her family fought for her. Her family stood up for the girl they knew she was. They fought for her when she couldn’t fight for herself. That family did everything they could. When she woke up, her father was at her side. When she woke up, she had a lot to say.
“That is fine. Thank you for asking instead of surprising me with that.” She said with a small smile. Kielar scooped her up and looked at the other two giving them a nod and then disappearing with a gust of wind.
Kielar’s body jerked awake as he was pushed out of Karla’s head. “No..no no no no. Kar!” He yelled out as she flatlined. “Karla! Kar wake up, no.” He cried. “Someone help! I need help here.”
Here is Chapter 3! I was having a bit of a difficult time ending the chapter which is what really took so long. but here it is! Please let me know what you think of it.
"Well, someone has to keep Francis in line. He never thinks before he acts” Mara said rolling her eyes. “I have also seen his bucket list, I will have to keep him safe on his endeavors.”
“Her name is Karla Storm, she doesn’t have any allergies to medication. Have you started an IV or…” Kielar started rambling off information before Izzy stopped him.
“They’re fine. Tommy got out, Steve and Tony have been arrested though. Pepper is working on getting everything taken care of.” Bucky said, quickly trying to reassure him in the end. The older man had dreaded the night that this would happen. The Avengers had known it was coming, the X-men had as well. Each night at least one hero would stay at the facility just in case. Nobody had wanted Kielar to arrive there to an empty building, knowing that it would not have been a good night for anyone. “Nobody is hurt, except a few of the soldiers who invaded the tower.”
“Well, they picked a great person. Not everyone would have done what you did tonight, they would have just gone to safety and not worried about others.” Renee told him. “We would have never known to come here.”
Sebastian stood up and glared at his older cousin, second cousin to be exact, and Luc wasn’t far behind him. “I ain’t gonna back down from a fight, dey wanna take us dey gonna have a hell of a time doin’ it.”
The girl sparked protests around the world. She used her voice to bring justice to the boys who had hurt her. It failed. They tried to anger her. To prove she was a loose cannon. They failed. They tried to turn her into an evil representation of mutants. Showing the world that she was why people feared mutants.  They wanted people to see her as aggressive, angry, and unpredictable.
“Ya’ll watchin’ the world news, but y’ ain’ lookin’ at da local news.” He said turning the channel. All eyes moved to the television. “Dats happenin’, ya’ll need to grab a bag and go.”
“Akihiro?” She asked. “That will be good for him. He ain’t very happy at Xavier’s.” she told him. “Jimmy will like it too, we gonna have to figure that out by the way, two James’ in the same facinity is gonna get confusin’”
Then came into place her sons abilities. He was able to accurately hit his target with objects, and it included firing a gun. Knives had always been his specialty but she knew that would not be an immediate option. As the guns stopped, she looked at the men and women on the ground around her and dropped the gun in her hand, she knew they would not be the last ones. Then, she heard the answering machine click on.
“I didn’t do anything, however, TOMMY is in L.A and just did a whole lot of talking, and we know how much trouble he gets in when he starts talking. “ Francis said.
“Johnny is just a friend.” Daken told her. “No let's get your sister ready to leave.” He said as they both moved inside.
“I know, I know.” Vivienne whispered. “I haven’t seen very many from the school. I don’t know where they could have gone. We’ve already been informed we can’t use any outside form of contact unless it is cleared. They don’t want anyone using an unsecured radio wave.”
“If it means gettin’ ya’ll out din ah will stay, but ah;ll go as long as ya’ll can make it. Ya promise ya put my grandkids before me, I’ve lived meh life. Ya’ll have more to do.” Jean Luc said. Henri and Remy looked at eachother and let out a sigh. They knew where the two of them got their own stubbornness from, even if one of them wasn’t blood related. The two nodded before going back to packing, the 3 working in silence until Sebastian and Luc came in.
Sliding her chair over to a set of screens on the wall she looked at them. “Now where the hell are you Thomas? It's not like you to be this quiet for so long. Why aren’t you being the loud ass troublemaker that you always are?” she questioned. “You always make sure you are the center of attention, so where would you go hide?”
“He’s doing a lot better.” Natasha commented with a smile. “I was worried earlier because of the way he looked.”
James laughed as his eyes followed Azari’s to where Mara and Francis now danced. “I think you are just jealous because he is not dancing on you like that, Kitten.”
“Clone not son. He has more of Tony Stark in him than Steve Rogers, anyway. Failed clone if you ask me.” Johnny said before Sue smacked on the back of the head. “What the hell.”
Kielar and Karla Storm(Or Maximoff) were a perfect example of this. Kielar showed signs of having more common Inhuman attributes than his twin. He could lift more, his skin was harder to pierce. His speed abilities already gave him a quicker reaction time, speed and endurance greater than other humans. His sister had shown similar signs, but not at the height of her brothers. One thing that had surprised all of them though, was the twins psychic link to each other. They had learned that they could not only speak to each other but also feel the other's emotions and physical pain.
“Got it mate! Team Beta is in location Ookami.” a fresh voice, a male with an Australian accent replied.
Azari gave her a nod. “Then I will call him that as well when I meet him.” he told her. He turned the next divider over. “These are the ones we were not told about, though, they did not seem happy with the Fantastic 4 from what I could tell. This young man,” Azari pointed to a younger photo of Kielar that had him with black hair. “Is the same one that is listed with the Avengers, so this may have been put together before his move, this one is his sister.” he explained.
“I can go.” Blaine Banner piped up. “I don’t like them but they might be more inclined to help if I’m standing there, so it couldn’t hurt. But Devon has to stay here. No arguments. And it should just be us four so that we aren’t bombarding them with a huge group. I’m pretty good with words when I need to be, but Francis is a hot head and someone needs to be the voice of reason.”
Kielar poked his head into the room pulling her from her focus. “A jet just landed. Almost everyone has been given a room, so the new arrivals can be the main focus, we can…”
“Whoa whoa, kiddo.” You have to be careful with that.” Bucky  told him, immediately taking the knife from him.
“No, I want you three to remain here. Mara and Azari are both mutants, and they are prime targets. If you leave, they  will just follow. I’ll be fine. I just need to get my so-called genius brother to safety.”
So yes, the expectations people had of him was the worst thing about it. He was dreading that conversation with Steve. Who was going to take over the name? Tommy? Just the thought made James laugh to himself. He loved his brother but he was too much of a tech head to really take over for Steve, hell, James didn’t even feel bad laughing at the thought because Tommy would have been laughing too if it was even suggested.
“I’m technically a clone.” Tommy piped up as he walked over to Kielar. “Most of you were as young as I was when it went to trial so you probably don’t remember anything about it. But yeah, government tried to have me removed from my home. They said that I was nothing but an experiment that happened to work. S.H.I.E.L.D was the one who informed them about my existence and how ”
“Coming here alone was even stupider, and you decided to engage in a protest? The morning after everything went down?” James sighed. “I know you are smarter than this. They got you on video Tommy, so now they know where you are. Why would you come here? I know you have better places.” Tommy crossed his arms, remaining silent as his brother scolded him. “You need to try and get out of the country before they find you. Pops and Tony were arrested, they are working on getting them out. You need to go somewhere safe though, do you have…”
“We can’t do that. We can’t look at we have accomplished as failures. You might not have saved some people, but you did save others. You know, you said that people look at me as a leader, but there are so many people that admire you. I honestly don’t know how you did any of what you accomplished over the past few years. There are murals of you all over New York. I might be someone who people listen to, but you are the one who shows them that they have a voice and if they use it, they will be heard. I think together we make things work. You bring people together, we can bring this group of ragtag teams.”
“Aislin said she wants to go after ‘em, and I agree. Nobody hurts my sister like that and gets away with it.” He told his mom, finally sitting up. “I know ya wanna go too.”
“I’m sure that wasn’t helpful Clint.” Natasha said appearing next to him. Tony let out an exaggerated sigh and Steve laughed. “Look, it’s your own fault for bringing us here this early Stark, and you left me with all of them. I think your son is at the starbucks demanding them to
Ryan O’Hare had joined S.H.I.E.L.D at a young age. They had recruited him with several others, but joined the West Coast Avengers team in the end,  because of one Francis Barton. He had been awestruck when he met the other boy, a fan of Clint Barton, and the reason he took up using a bow and arrow as his preferred weapon. Francis didn’t ask questions about his past like most people, he just questioned the future. When they hit it off, he started inviting him on missions with him, one's outside of S.H.I.E.L.D. They had notably pissed off several higher ups when they did this, but it was after the mission with the original Hawkeye, then the decision had been made for him to step back from the agency, at least for a time. He couldn’t just leave, he had to bring his closest friends. Nicole Coulson.
Laura took a breath. “And you James. You are supposed to be the level headed one of the family. Not starting fights with him. You were raised away from all this chaos and the fighting, the only reason you know anything is because of our dumb ass big brother. The only reason you are even in America and ever gave Xavier’s a chance is because of Akihiro. The only reason you were able to build this safe haven, is because you built connections with people. You both think Logan didn’t know that you two had teamed up. You think he didn’t know about some of the things you two did together out in the field, but he did and he has been proud. And yes, if those executions were real, he’s gone.” She stepped away from them. “But you know the three of us won’t let them keep his body, and I know that it has already run through your heads that we’re going to get them back, We will get the ones they took from us, and we won’t stop until we do.”
“Yes, Sir.” The AI responded. As Steve and Tony turned the lights off in the lab and started up the stairs, Jarvis spoke again. “Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers, Tommy has requested your help in his room, Kielar seems to be having an episode with his speed.”
“It’s my job to take care of you kid, not the other way around. Tommy is leaving too. We will meet up. I’m not letting these bastards take anyone.” Tony said. “So fucking run Kielar. Now.”
“Francis?” Clint said. “Don’t even think about it.” he told him, and his son started laughing. “I’m serious kid.”
Dakota moved away from her computer with her hands covering her mouth. “Oh no.” she said in shock, Kielar turned to her. “The LeBeau’s estate is gone.” she told him. Kielar’s eyes widened as he turned back around and started typing furiously for any other report. “I’m looking for anything to indicate they got out.”
“Wow.” Devon said, his eyes wide in surprise.He glanced at him brother. “So I guess S.H.I.E.L.D is the center of a lot of our problems…” he commented. “They kept my brother for two years. They wouldn’t let me near him.”
“Keegan. What are you doing out here?” Bucky asked as the boy crawled out and up onto his lap. Keegan looked over toward the door that led to Daken’s room. “Is he sleeping?”
Tommy stood up and started clapping. “Now I really get it. Why you always are the one to make the speeches. That was great, almost like it was out experience, with some regret tossed in there. I mean it hit me...right here pops...right here in my heart” he said tapping his chest. A small laugh was heard in the back of the room, and a few eyes moved to Kielar, but nobody said anything. Instead steve picked up a pillow and threw it at Tommy.
“Its the covert team coming from New York. Go see them.” Dakota told him. “I will take care of getting everything into the computer, I can go through Daken.”
“They sent a message out on a shortwave radio, which signaled the Howlett's that were still around. But they weren’t the only ones to heard.”
“Akihiro.” his brother said from across the hangar. “Too much.” The girls next to the man could barely hear what James said, but Daken let go of Vivienne.
Francis and Mara were lounging on the couch watching YouTube   when they received an alert. The archer clicked it immediately and his mouth dropped open as he saw an all too familiar face appear. “That…” Francis began.
“We’ll go with you, we have clearance.” Nicole said. “Ryan and I have clearance, we can get you in so they don’t see you as a threat immediately.”
“Well, it's not you Aunt Nat, no offense but we’re really hoping that you and Dad will finally get together.” Francis said and Mara let out a loud sigh. “What?” he asked sitting next to the open spot next to James. “C’mon Snow, there’s room for you.” he paused and turned to James. “Francis Barton, nice to officially meet you.”
“Obviously they failed!” Jade yelled, her eyes having filled with tears into her eyes. “You didn’t see what we saw! You didn’t see the fear in their eyes, you didn’t see the death. They didn’t even try to just take us, they went in to kill us. Children. Children that some of our parents died trying to save.”
“It’s midnight, what the hell is going on?” Johnny asked. “Karla go..” He started before yanking her from her chair and pulling her behind him as the military came out of the elevator. Johnny stayed between them and his daughter, observing as they filed into the room.
“Canada.” Kielar said simply. “It is an Avengers base that was built a few years ago. The U.S government is not aware of it. Tony Stark teamed up with Yashida Industries when the rumors started about the President elect and his feelings on mutants, and his plans to ‘take care of the problem’” Kielar quoted. “Once he was in the office, they began their contingency project.”
“My job is to minimize the damage he causes, not completely stop it Dakota.” Kielar told her with a small smile. A light beeping noise goes off and Kielar gets up. “I’ll be right back, Steve?” he looked at the man who nodded in response and the two left the room.
“I think so. Dakota told me to head down there.” he told them. They slowed down before entering the area, and Desiree pushed past the group of boys, a sob escaping her.
“Papa.” a small voice said from under the table next to him, and Bucky leaned over to see the dark haired child underneath. He didn’t speak much, so anything he said would be special. Keggan had started calling him Papa a year earlier, after he had been introduced to Mara, who not everyone knew as his daughter yet.
“You had to be moving pretty fast to hit the wall and leave a mark like that. You have powers?” Francis asked him. Kielar glanced at Tony, who gave him a slight nod to encourage him.
“I know. Look. Sue was hurt in the fight with them. I’m trying to keep Johnny at a good level and it isn’t going well, his sister is hurt and they took his daughter. Just make sure they don’t get Kielar.”
“Hey man, it’s cool. Thanks for being honest with us. We didn’t really get a booklet about everyone so, that’s real cool you share that.” Francis said. “I was supposed to join S.H.I.E.L.D on my eighteenth birthday, obviously ditched that idea.”
“We’re here to talk about you not me and the non existent relationship between Nat and I.” Clint said to him as he shot an arrow.
“I’m bi-sexual, and I just got out of a relationship with Torrun. I don’t think I need to jump into anything else just yet, you know? And yeah, I know you are cool with it. I just never had interest anyone worth mentioning.”
“Pretty sure you deserved that one, we’re letting it slide TJ.” Tony told him as he sipped his coffee. “Now for the subject at hand.” he paused and looked at Mara “Wait. Your boyfriend is checking out your brother? I am hearing this correctly?”
“Any luck on Tommy?” Dakota asked quietly, her mind going a mile a minute from the previous news still.
“Whoa, whoa, young lady.” Johnny said. “Don’t turn your anger onto him just because another talked you down. I have sat here and listened to you berate everyone here, and there has not been a single thank you given to those who got you out of the government's custody.” he told her. “And my son, because that is who you are currently addressing, did exactly what he was supposed to. I’m pretty sure Steve and Tony would have told him not to be a hero for once in his life and to stay put, but from what Bucky told me, he went back out there and helped. I am not going to let you sit there and belittle him in front of all these people.” Kielar and Tommy looked at each, both surprised by the man's defensive outburst.  “None of you know what each other went through, and none of you will understand what everyone is feeling in this room. We all went through something and we are all coping, and we do that differently. But turning on each other is not the answer.”
Everyone in the room grew silent and then a moment later their attention was turned toward the door when it opened. Desiree stood there. “Dey just killed her.” She said. “Dey killed meh Mama. Publicly..dey..” She trailed off as Izzy Allerdyce and James Howlett moved to her. “She wouldn’t give nobody up.” she whispered. “Dey killed her.” she repeated.
“Akihiro, wait a second okay?” He heard Bucky next and he stopped in his tracks and took a breath before turning around. “I know you are upset. It is a lot to take in but you need to think about what you are going to do.”
“You weren’t the only one who he wasn’t there for. I had every right to stay away from him! He didn’t protect my mom! So yes I was angry for a very long time, because he should have been there, he should have protected her but he didn’t! I should have been with him but I refused to go and now look what happened!” James shoved Daken. “I didn’t go with him and now he is dead.”
“Stay here okay, Steve and I will find out what is happening. Just in case, get your shoes on and grab a small bag. I want you ready to go.” Tony instructed. “You know where to go when something happens.” Kielar nodded to him. “If I tell you to run, then you are to run and not look back. You are not to go to the Baxter building, here or any other place someone might connect you to.”  He paused and stood up. “I’m going to make a few phone calls.” As the older man stepped out of the room he took a deep breath running his hand through his hair. “Fuck.” he cursed to himself.
“You’re a telepath.” Kielar stated. “I felt you inside my head and that's how I knew someone was here. I wasn’t sure if you were who I felt. Have you ever had someone in your head going through pure agony? Have you ever had someone in your head, through all the good and bad times, through the struggle, and then, they just say goodbye, and you no longer feel them?” he asked. “Because that is what I went through tonight, as they murdered my twin sister.” The three went silent, looking down at the floor. “So no, I don’t know what you went through tonight. But I know what I went through and I at least have an understanding.”
“Neither one of ‘em are actually related to a person in the Fantastic 4, that was another file we got.” She said and pulled out a small folder. “They’re twins. There birth Papa is Pietro Maximoff, there Mama is the Inhuman Crystal, they have an older sister named Luna,” Desiree revealed. “Not only that, but there is a possible other sibling. We can’t confirm that yet.”
Bucky picked Keegan up and motioned to Mara to go toward and exit as the fight began to escalate. As they exited, James launched himself at his brother and the two started fist fighting, Laura on the sideline debating whether to intervene. Giving it a few minutes she rolled her eyes and walked over, kicking Daken in the head to get his attention and yanking James back by his shirt. “You two dumb asses are more like Logan than either of you will ever admit. Fuck.” she shoved James away. “How am I the goddamn voice of reason in this family? Logan was going to do whatever the hell he wanted whether or not someone joined him, and if you think you feel guilty now, what if you had been there? You do realize if it was a choice between you being taken and him, he would have protected you. Because that is what everyone is this stupid family does.” Laura yelled at them. “You think James didn’t care that you ran off to come get me and my kids? You are an idiot Akihiro and I will keep kicking your ass if you think that. You were there more for James than anyone else in the family, even when the Yashida’s tried to remove you from the picture. You pulled him from that house and protected him, even though your big bad reputation could have been ruined because you showed even an ounce of empathy toward someone. You practically raised James, why the hell do you think he stays so close to you all the time, because I can assure you that it isn’t your attitude.”
“Kielar?” Bucky questioned from the doorway. “I’m glad you’re awake. Brought you some food, it's just a sandwich and some chips, but it will help you feel better. You ran a lot tonight and wore yourself down.”
“We both know if I don’t want to do something, I won’t. We also know that I will do things I’m not supposed to do.” The teen shrugged. “I do what I want, it just happens to be connected to people I care about. I mean who else is going to get you and Nat to hook up?”
So this was different to write because not only is it an OC but it isn't one of mine. I absolutely adore Dakota though and I am so happy to have permission to use her in this story.
“My sister is down there already and Benjamin is in London with our mother, my father is not here either, so I have no issue clearing the property.”
“What do you mean?” Kielar asked, now eating the food he had been brought. Bucky raised an eyebrow watching the kid eat.
“Thomas Stark?” She asked immediately. He looked at her incredulously. “I don’ like not knowin’ things Zar, y’ know this.” Desiree leaned down and pulled out a small binder. “I know all of ‘em.”
“I agree wit’ him Papa.” Henri spoke up. “And y’ know dat don’t happen often. Y’ stuck in da fight dis long. Y’ ain’t bein’ left behind. We don’ know what dey will do t’ y’. Y’ adopted a mutant, y’ protectin’ mutants. Dey know all of dis. Y’ comin’ wit’ us.”
He ordered a coffee. Nothing more though, knowing he only had limited cash on him and using the credit card was not a current option. The teen was a Stark though and powering through being tired was something that he had inherited. As he looked down at his phone, he wished he knew that it was a secure line. Calling someone at this point would be so much easier. So instead, he leaned back and watched videos as he sipped his drink, ordering a second, and then a third. Tommy had been thankful that even though the phone was cracked, it was the newest Stark phone, and the battery lasted.
“I’ll move him into the bed “Steve told the other two before lifting Kielar up and laying him on Tommy’s bed.
“The many Adventures of Bow and Ho” Natasha told them, and suddenly, Tommy and Dakota both started choking on their popcorn. “I take it you follow them?”
That was why he wasn’t surprised to see her on the television rescuing people after midnight. He had heard of what was happening in New York city, and then there were reports in California, but so far nothing else had been reported, so for just a moment, Jean Luc believed his family was safe. They were all there, in the living room, minus Desiree. Remy had his arm around Anna, his wife, and Luc sat on the floor in front of them. Henri was on the arm of the couch and Sebastian sat directly next to his grandfather. Their silence spoke volumes.
Devon, who would just sit and listen, sometimes for hours. Blaine also loved science. Bruce didn’t discover this until after the third week of the twins being with him. They had gone to Stark Tower in order for Bruce and Tony to work on a new project. They had been so engrossed in what they were doing that they hadn’t seen Blaine wander down. It had been simple tinkering, something had not been working, he had simply made it work. Once he started telling them about what he did, there was no stopping the kid.
“Cute ain’t they. Both single too.” Desiree said before sipping her drink , a small smile playing at her lips. He looked at her with a slight glare, which only made her smile more. “Just sayin’, y’ could use a love life, it's pretty non existent.”
“Princess, I need you to step back.” he instructed. Karla slowly took a few steps back before her father lit up in flames. It had been awhile since she had seen him use his abilities. Most of the Fantastic Four had stepped down in their roles as superheros. “Come through me first.” he said before shooting flames toward the soldiers. The soldier's moved forward, only to hit an invisible forefield. Johnny remained on fire, but now his sister stood between him and the others.
“You can’t blame that on them.” Azari said. “What happened at Xavier’s is a tragedy that should have never occurred. You have every right to be upset, but you have no right to be upset with those here trying to help. We are just as devastated as you are, but we also understand that what we experienced is not the same as what you did that night. We were lucky.”
“No.” Devon cut her off. “My brother has already been imprisoned before. You may have met him after the fact but you weren't there when he was forced to leave his home, and I will NEVER let that happen again. S.H.I.E.L.D has all the information regarding Blaine and you two, we don’t know if they are involved, we don’t know if they will hand that information over to the government. We don’t know what the fuck is going on, so we are leaving now. If you don’t want to leave with us, I will take my damn brother and get him to safety myself!” Devon said, his voice rising the more he spoke.
“Doesn’t solve anything by fighting with each other when we should be working together.” Mara told him, and as if on cue the Howletts could be heard approaching the area.
“Pretty sure the real reason is because he likes…” Dakota started to say, but two hands slapped over her mouth before she could finish.
As they approached the door it opened and immediately the yelling was heard. Reed and Johnny looked at eachother and before either of them could say anything an unlikely person took charge. “Shut the hell up! All of you!” Daken yelled over them and slammed his hands down on the table that separated most of them from getting into physical fights.”Some of us have fucking sensitive ears, so how about we not yell.” Johnny was surprised at how level his voice was, he had definitely changed since he last saw him.
Tommy ran into the room before they could continue their conversation. “Hey! Another group just arrived, I think my dads are with them.” Kielar jumped up and went to the door. “They might have some news, you should come too…” he said pointing to Desiree. “Sorry I don’t know your..”
“You will kid, I promise, it was just an update I needed to give him so he can handle something personally. Are you ready to get back to Pup?”
“So, who is the poor soul informing the kids of this?” Clint asked as he looked around the room. “Any volunteers? No?”
“They killed him. They killed my dad. They murdered him right in front of me. I will kill all of them.” She said. “Every last one of them Vivienne, they deserve what is coming to them, we did nothing wrong!”
“You are just looking for someone to blame Jade, we are all upset, we are all tired. “James tossed out. “We did everything we could..I know that doesn’t seem like enough, but we were five people out there and we didn’t get to any building in time to stop anyone from being hurt, taken or arrested. We did get all of you out though. We got to you before you ended up in that damn camp with those collars on for who knows how long.”
The buildings in the lead given to them were the most known and recognizable, the Baxter Building, Stark Tower and Xavier’s School for the Gifted. All three rumored to be hiding mutant individuals. They watched and waited. They stood on guard. They felt the gush of wind move past them as the lights came on in Stark Tower and as vehicles left the Baxter building.
“It comes from ya heart Kielar.” She said, “Ya come from a place of honesty. Ah see it, da others see it. Steve Rogers saw it.”
“Wow, how easy it is for you to fall in love if they make cookies, but all those people falling at your feet before.” Devon laughed. “If they only knew.”
“We’ll get out of this, Cass. I’m not letting anything happen to you.” he told her. “Don’t be afraid of the shadows. They won’t hurt you. Just stay close to me.” The boy, Jett told her. As he did this his eyes turned black and creatures formed out of the shadows, swallowing the soldier as the room darkened. When the lights came back on the two of them were left. Without Hesitation he grabbed her hand.
“That’s enough.” This time James Rogers spoke up and the red head moved next to Azaris other side. “You need to stop using the fact that he's a prince against him.”
“We aren’t going to just hide, we need to fight. We have lost people and we are going to continue to lose them if we don’t do something about it. You can’t come in here and just tell us what we need to do.” Renee snapped at him.
“Henri, this is Laura Kinney, I am a friend of your brother. We have help coming our way. When they get here I will send you another message so we can come pick you and your family up.” Laura ended the message. “Now we just wait.”
There were only a few others in the medwing of the compound. Most of the injuries were superficial and were being healed as fast as Josh Foley could handle it. Johnny had been surprised that they had snagged the healer for the facility so quickly, but apparently Daken has more connections than even Johnny knew about.
“Our name is fine dad, Mara and I decided it together, it fits us. You wouldn’t even know it was our account if you hadn’t caught us uploading the episode a couple months ago.”
Bruce moved to Blaine quickly and took the remaining cookies. “I’ll get you new ones Blaine.” He watched as his son pouted a bit, and as Steve moved to Tommy to scold his own son.
“Mhm. Nikki realized I liked cookies, and would sneak them to me when she could. I like them. Ryan has this BIG admiration for Hawkeye, he talked a lot about him.” Blaine explained. “If they are the two that will be there, I would be okay with going. It’s the older agents that I don’t like, Agent Coulson was the exception. But I also don’t like fighting.” He added.
“They taught me to be a lady, I don’t have vulgar habits.” Vivienne retorted, Jett let out a laugh, his friend quickly silenced with a  punch  in the arm. “Let’s go.” She instructed.
Clint threw his arm around his son’s shoulders and nodded a bit as they walked toward the car. “You know, you aren’t bad at all. Though, you really need to work on your Vlog name”
“Why are we flying commercially? We have a private jet.” He asked. “You know I don’t do well in coach.”
“Now ain’t da tahme. Get goin. We ain’t gonna let nobody get ya again.” Desiree spoke as James motioned for some of the others to follow. Jade noted the ones who had been rescued, she didn’t know all of them. It made her wonder just how many were taken from their homes.
“Yes we can Viv! They didn’t have a school full of mutants, they didn’t see their friends, their..their parents get..” Jade started and Vivi pulled the girl into her arms as a gust of wind came past them and toward the jet. “What…” The two looked over and saw a girl on a stretcher, and Kielar stopping next to it. “I’m guessing that’s the speedster.”
“Two streets over you will see a blue leopard, her name is Spot, she will get all of you onto the jet. When its full we will radio in and get you to safety.” James informed her. “Hurry.”
Tommy turned to run, only to be grabbed by yet another person, and this time the grip was too strong for him to fight. “Fucking let me go asshole! I’ll sue you for assault!”
The two checked the third floor, making sure that they cleared the dorm rooms completely. As they finished, Jett grabbed Vivienne's hand, and the two moved down to the second floor jumping through shadows. As they appeared, the two froze in shock at the carnage before them. Vivienne covered her mouth as tears sprung to her eyes seeing one of their mentors on the ground sprayed with bullets. The mutant Bobby Drake had been one of the victims of the night.
“Thanks Bucky.” Kielar mumbled before losing unconsciousness.He didn’t know how long he was out for, but there was no sunshine. There was no soft bed, and he wasn’t in Stark Tower with his friends' family. Kielar immediately jumped up and looked around wildly as he tried to take in the surroundings. He knew he wasn’t home, and he knew he wasn’t with the Starks. The memories of what had happened over the course of the night came back to him. He leaned forward, bringing his knees up and resting his head on them as he started to cry. All the emotion he had been feeling since he had woken up was coming out, and he couldn’t stop.
“I was put in the middle of it the moment they killed Uncle Sam and Aunt Paige. The moment they threatened grandma. No, they came to our home Mama, and that ain't okay. Nobody there hurt anybody.”
“No.” Kielar said, and Johnny could see everybodies attention turn to the boy. “He teamed up with Yashida Enterprise to create a safe haven if it was needed. Yes the original thought was about me, but he knew that more people would need it.”
“Then we will have to get her back.” Johnny hissed as he looked at Sue, rage filled him. “They messed with the wrong family.”
“They have a Vlog that they do, challenges they set for themselves and hope that they don’t get arrested. It’s really better if you don’t know.” Natasha said. “Clint and I found it on accident.”
“I enjoy living a normal life though. If I went there everyone would know, I prefer just being me.” Karla smiled. “I like the school I attend and…” She suddenly stopped and covered her ears as the security alarms blared all around her.
“We monitor it. Since we discovered the channel we have been keeping a close eye on everything, obviously we missed the last video or we would have known they were coming here. They tend to only give hints though.” Nat
“Especially after they tried to take Tommy from you and Tony huh?” James asked. “I don’t remember a whole lot of that time, but I remember the two of you being really upset.”
Kielar took a step back, keeping his eyes on Tony, and then glancing at Steve, who gave him a nod.  Next, he looked at his friend, who seemed as terrified as he was. Kielar then nodded. “Okay. OKay.” he said before running past Steve and into the bedrooms, not stopping as he phased right through the walls of the building before running down the side. “Don’t stop. Just run. Just run. Tony said to run” he whispered to himself.
The three Xavier students looked around at the others that filled the room. A majority of them they recognized from the Avengers roster, those training to take position as the older members retired. There were however a few from Xavier’s. Too few, and it hurt to see that not many of their friends had made it to the same location as them. They could only hope that they would arrive later, that they had survived.
“Ookami! Oy found the Storm girl!” James heard his teammate yell. He turned and hurried toward them as he watched Izzy Allerdyce jump down into the truck. “She’s unconscious, but she is alive…” he told him as he lifted her up. James held the girl in his arms as Izzy pulled himself back out of the truck.
The school was in chaos. Screams. Crying. Panic. Pain. Death. It was all over. The government had finally made their decision on what to do with the mutants, and this was their answer. It didn’t matter that they were young. It didn’t matter that they were innocent. Nothing mattered to them. They still feared what they didn’t understand after all these years. It took one man to call for the roundup of those born with abilities, and that was all that mattered. He didn’t care that these children were watching their parents die protecting them. It didn't matter that after tonight, these children would be captured or murdered.
“But you’re so good at it.” Blaine replied back with a grin. Devon grabbed a pillow and hit Blaine in the face with it, causing the boy to yell out. Bruce shook his head and laughed as the two wrestled. He never really worried about them breaking anything, they always avoided things in there way. Bruce didn’t know how, but they did.
“Maybe you are the one that needs to come to terms with it.” Daken snapped. “You hid yourself away from the man most of your life and didn’t even tell people you were a Howlett until your mid teens! You decided you would just be a Yashida. So don’t come after me like this when you need to deal with your own bullshit!”
“I’m sure that would have been frowned upon,” Bucky laughed. “But I understand, you just have to remember that they are dealing with things that have never happened to them before. They’re learning how to cope, and they do that differently.”
Now, though, he could only hope he wouldn’t get recognized. It was why he wasn’t using the suit of armor unless he absolutely had to. The walk had taken hours, but he was now at least in the city limits. He walked into a small diner and slipped into a booth, finally feeling like he could breathe. He was in the middle of nowhere at almost two in the morning. Exhaustion took over his entire body as he sat down, and when the server came over to him, Tommy knew that it was noticeable.
Devon  was a lot more confrontational than his brother was for instance. Hist reaction to situations, especially that involved Blaine, were more hostile. This didn’t happen so much at the apartment, but when they were out, it was something Bruce had to watch for closely. The boy always seemed to be on edge. He took care of Blaine, and Bruce sometimes thought that it may have been out of guilt, because he hadn’t been there to protect the other boy when S.H.I.E.L.D took him into custody. That late arrival had been something that ate at Devon, and he could tell.
“Bucky is a good father to him.” Daken said and turned back around. Bucky looked at his partner incredulously.
“They were the ones who would visit me. They brought me books and when I was too out of it to read on my own Nikki would read to me, or Ryan would tell me stories. They were the ones who talked them into letting me out.”
“Pretty sure it was the Barton kid Jim, I think I heard him make a comment about America’s ass being hereditary.” Tommy piped up and raised an eyebrow at James. “He isn’t very discreet about anything, I don’t know how you didn’t notice.”
“I know. I know. We heard. Dey told us y’ saw da telecast. But we’re here now, da family is here and y’ don’ gotta hold all of it on y’ shoulders no more.” He said and pulled her back into a hug.
“They are looking over everything but we have only seen Anna outside the home before it blew up. There is no evidence that the others were in or out. Bucky is almost positive they got her. We just don’t know where the rest of the family is.”  Daken told him.
“I love you too mom. Goodnight.” She said and ended the call. She let out a sigh as she leaned back in the chair and shut her eyes for a moment. “Alright,” Dakota started to tell herself. “Get a cup of tea and head to bed, we can call it a night.” She got up and started down the hallway but paused at Tommy’s door that had been left cracked open. When she peered inside she saw the mess that was in his room. It was like a hurricane had his it.
“We realized it and it was too late.” Tommy answered, not really giving an answer. “I mean, dad did it.”
“Renee!” Vivienne called running toward the girl. The other girl turned toward them before spinning around and throwing more ice at soldiers. “Renee, you aren’t alone. We’re going to get out of here together.”
“Hopefully they will arrive soon then. I am pretty sure I know the team Bucky has been in contact with.” She told him. “And they’re good at what they do. “
“Actually, both dad and pops were. I’m done here, all of you are pathetic.” he turned to walk away again, only to be grabbed by another person. “You have about two seconds to let go of me, and that will be the only warning you get.” True to his word, Tommy used his other arm and punched the person in the face. As soon as he was freed, he ran.
“Nobody is expecting you to.” Jett said as he moved into a room. A Few moments later he moved out and shut the door. “Three dead.” he said softly. “Let’s keep going.” The girls looked at each other and gave a small nod before continuing on, keeping a count in their heads as they found bodies.
“Team exercise.” Reed told them. “There is a facility to train in the sub basement. We will begin in the morning.” He moved toward the door and paused at James and Desiree. “I’m sorry for your loss Desiree, nobody should have to see that.”
“Which means Clint and I will be bailing you two out as usual.” Natasha teased. “And that doesn't mean you can join them James.”
“Maybe if you had more conversations with him, you would have known.” Reed shrugged. “You know how it is, you said nothing to us, it just came out on its own.”
“TJ? Johnny just told a room full of people that he was proud of me. I mean he said it without actually saying it but…” Kielar looked at him. “I’m not at all okay right now. I am not handling any of this, but if Steve and Tony are olding up, and Vivienne and Jade and Desiree and Renee, who didn’t say anything today...if they are, then I’m going to be. I am going to fight. I am not going to crumble. At Least not yet.”
Before he knew it, the sun was coming up, and he had to get to his feet to continue on. Finishing the last cup of coffee, he threw down the money he owed before heading out of the diner. With the sun coming up, it was warming up just enough that he was more comfortable. November weather in California was always like that.
