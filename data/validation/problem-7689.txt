Yu frowns and crosses his arm over his chest. "You talk like you know something we don't, Colonel," he says.
“I believe San Marino is an enclaved microstate—“
“So, what happened to you?” Tony goes, changing the subject.
A soulmate.
“Nowhere specifically. We got some leads on the Ten Rings and now that we’ve proven War Machine is ready for action with mutual agreement, we think we might have the upper hand,” Rhodey explains.
"This means you'll move in?" Tony had asked.
Almost like he’s whimpering.
They try to drown him at least four times a day, for a whole week, and each time Tony gives them the same answer.
He lets his muscles work and tighten and drip with sweat and it feels regular, safe. Like nothing has changed.
Note before heading into this one:
"Let's hope," Clint turns to say to them and opens the door. "Laura? I'm home," Clint says, calling for someone.
It’s like no time has passed really.
Rhodey just sighs. "Yeah, it just started itching, I don't know wh—" Rhodey begins saying before he looks down at his wrist and notices.
“Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?” Tony jokes, looking at his watch.
"Steve Rogers," Steve replies, pulling the guy up.
"So, thoughts, complaints, any ideas?" Tony asks as Steve stares from the railings; they're in one of the quinjet garages.
"It's a good way not to die, though," she retorts, not looking at him.
The man pauses, tilts his head to the side, and concludes: “Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it?”
He stops just by the border and looks into the huge hole the cage left behind, where Thor supposedly disappeared to, vanishing with nearly all hope of them ever succeeding.
“No. All this came from that,” Pepper repeats, pointing at his arc reactor.
“I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense,” Tony tells him and Bruce looks at him like he’s not sure what he’s got to do with anything. “We can only do it while we have the scepter here. That's three days. Give me three days,” he adds.
Tony shakes his head. "Howard didn't think so," he says, suddenly. "Every time we came over to DC, we'd have to have one of these pizzas. Every time," Tony shares.
Howard puts his hands in his pockets, about to take the bait, when his mother goes: “Be nice, dear, he’s been studying abroad,” reminding him that their son is not home all the time because he’s trying to get a summa cum laude degree on Mechanical Engineering at MIT and not because he absolutely dreads being in the same space as his father.
Tony turns to him. "Really? That's it? You just roll over, show your belly every time somebody snarls?"
Maria places a hand on her son’s cheek and rubs her thumb on it. “How’s my big boy?” she asks and Tony gives her a smile. “How’s school? You’re not failing much, are you?” she jokes, going back to her task.
Tony gives him a look, all-too knowing, then closes his eyes. “Rhodey, I didn’t mean—”
Then he caresses Natasha's face before he presses one of his beam light arrowheads in front of her face and snaps her out of it.
“I don’t think he wants Steve to see
“No, but you know my mom would have my head if I miss another family holiday. She still hasn’t forgiven me for last year,” Rhodey says and Tony waves a hand Rhodey can’t see.
"I know," Tony replies, licking his fingers.
“Well, Colonel, not everyone sees Stark with the same eyes that you do,” he replies.
“That way you can have privacy but also that view for, well, just about anything you wanna do in here,” Tony explains, just as he’s stepping away from a table he was covering.
Steve's just pissed and helpless, so he rips a log in half with his hands in frustration and Tony stands silent.
“Hey,” Steve says, quietly coming in. He’s holding a tablet in his hands. “Anything interesting?” he asks, lifting his chin at the Scepter being scanned.
They eat in comfortable silence until the credit rolls.
The Captain puts on a vicious smile. “Yeah, big man in a suit of armor,” he begins, walking around him like a cheetah around its pray. “Take that off, what are you?”
Rhodey arrives just two days later to read on a report that Nick Fury's died and HYDRA's infiltrated SHIELD all these years and they were fact of immediately disbanded as a government organization.
"That's a tough way to live," Steve says, looking at her for a long second.
“Happy was concerned,” Tony says.
“Yeah, I think Howard might disagree with you on that—”
If this is the last chapter I post before we all see Endgame, I find it a little poetic that it ends at the beginning of everything.
But Pepper runs towards him and uses his propped knee to jump higher and punch through one the armors. She falls to the ground with the suit and rips its gauntlet, then kicks one of the portable bombs and shoots whatever remained of Aldrich Killian.
He shakes that voice away and tackles him to the ground. "You're my mission," he says at his face, holding onto what's left of the world he knew.
Steve almost smiles at that. Guess some things never change, then. “You here with a mission, sir?” he asks.
He knows it’s the wrong question the next second because somebody’s at the door, speaking in a language he can’t understand, and the man changes completely from his otherwise calmed stance.
Pepper takes a step down, taking a deep breath as Tony’s eyes got shiny.
Tony raises his head and swallows, as much as he’d like letting Fury take all the blame, he knows he could’ve —should’ve done— something. Not letting Loki in, for starters.
His worries leave him for a fleeting second.
“Yeah, I could have my own name on my wrist,” he jokes, a devilish grin on his face. All he hears is an exasperated ‘
"You okay, Rhodes?" Yu asks when Rhodey goes awfully quiet.
"No, those are tattoos, this is a brand," Thor says, going through the photo.
“Curve ball, high and outside for ball one. So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4. And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat, this fellow's capable of making it a brand-new game again. Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field,” the voice echoes in the room and he moves his head just enough to catch the rest of the room.
?” Tony calls, over Cap’s side. “J, where is she?” he asks JARVIS.
"Yep. It was a great night," Tony comments but Maya makes a funny gesture.
Steve just shrugs in reply. "I just don't want you to feel like you can't talk to me about it. Honestly," Steve says. "If all, you're the one who tries to soften the blow," he adds.
He plainly ignores her and goes for his right wrist. “Fuck!” Tony yells, shaking it, once he notices Steve fucking Rogers is still on his wrist.
Rhodey had fallen asleep at four a.m. looking at a picture of Barnes in Camp McCoy, young and full of life, wondering how someone with those dimples could turn into a breathing killing-machine.
But Tony won’t burden him with it. All he needs is to fix this and fix it quick. All he needs is for Earth and everyone he loves in it to be safe.
"Not everything," Steve thinks. Then they go get some of SHIELD's old archives that they been saving up from every base they raided.
“Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you,” Nick tells him, after Steve flips through the files. “He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs,” Nick explains.
Tony opens his arms in despair. “So, what is it?”
Steve looks at him in the eyes and swallows. “It’s not just that, I—I've been thinking and I just realized—" Steve says, then wets his lower lip. "Tony, most of the time I forget really just how little time has passed. For me," he says.
Eventually, Rhodey —who is now a Major—becomes a liaison between the military and Stark Industries and starts working on the Weapons Development department of Edwards, giving test-runs to most of Tony’s tech and approving most of the Air Force weapons purchasing.
was another way of seeing it.
“Okay, let me stop you there,” Tony cuts in, Steve falls quiet and gets even more nervous. “I feel I know where this is going and I think it’s safe to say that, you know, we weren’t ourselves there. So—yeah, we’re both sorry, right?” he goes, his eyebrows narrowing but his lips curve into a soft smile.
The cold air around him is all too familiar.
“Holy shit!” Rhodey blurts out.
Steve wants to roll his eyes at him, but it won't do any good. "Well, let's just say you haven't seen it yet," Steve says.
“Hell, yeah,” Allen agrees.
“Is he, you know, weird?” Davis tries, lingering on the adjective.
They make it back to Washington by the morning. "We can't go any-fucking-where, Rogers," Natasha had said earlier, but Steve had already a place in mind.
Nothing again. The hammer is one with the living room table.
Tony goes to the darts board and starts throwing some.
Tony leaves the barn to find all the wood has been chopped and there's not much to do anymore so he figures a good night sleep is overdue, so he asks Clint where to go and then enters the room to find Steve folding what seemed to be the shirt he was wearing earlier, now wearing what's definitely one of Clint's shirts that's far too small for him.
Rhodey chuckles a breath and rubs the back of his head. “It’s been great. I did it, Tones,” he says, his heart feeling huge with the memory. Tony doesn’t need to know he lost his mark for some godforsaken reason; he only needs the good stuff. “I was up there, in the sky.”
“What…” he whispers, running his fingers through it. That wasn’t there before.
“Three hours—” Rhodey says.
“Rhodey,” Natasha’s the first to come to meet him, giving him a kiss on the cheek.
"I know you're hiding more than files," Tony says, turning away from the computer. This was the last HYDRA Research base they knew of. This was the X on the map, the jackpot. "Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick," Tony asks.
Pepper takes a few more steps towards Tony before she reaches him and puts her hands on his head, taking the special headwear off and putting it on the table next to him.
He breathes evenly and sits, dwells on the memories of whatever he was before, whoever he was before.
"You're giving all of them new toys, huh?" Rhodey asks, crossing his arms. Tony's that kind of friend.
“Ah, shit,” Tony curses under his breath.
"How could you?" Steve chokes in his tears and sees the 'Anthony Stark' on his wrist fading away.
After they leave him in the quietness of the apartment, he can’t even bring himself to cry. He really thought dying in the cold arctic ocean was the worst result he could get from crashing that plane.
How will he stay in touch though? “He doesn’t have my number,” he mutters to himself, getting the keys to his bike out of his jacket pocket. ‘How is he gonna contact me if he doesn’t have my number or my address?’ Steve thinks again, but he starts the engine of his bike and rides it through the –for now—peaceful streets of New York.
"I just wanna know if you're sorry," Steve says, shrugging, and looks at him attentively.
It takes Tony a second before he blinks in realization of whatever Pepper means. “Oh, really?” he asks.
“What if he comes looking for you?” Rhodey shoots back.
"No, it's never come up," Rhodey answers, sarcastically.
"Well, it's not a
This chapter isn't beta'd but I downloaded Grammarly & I'm pretty confident it doesn't look as bad as it could've if I had just been left to my own devices. Still, beta readers are much welcome if anyone's up for it, but in the meantime, it's me and this funky, little app against the world. Apologies ahead.
"Did something happen?" Rhodey wonders.
“Yeah—about that…we can’t,” Rhodey tells him, looking quickly at Steve, still talking to Thor. Tony gives him a confused look and Rhodey sighs. “Barnes doesn’t want him to know.”
"Well, these people are all horrible," Bruce mutters, reading over a few files. Tony spots a familiar face.
They land on a pretty little farm-house that's surrounded by green and quietness.
“That's the whole story?” Thor wonders.
Next, to him, the old man is panicking. “Do you understand me? Do as I do,” he repeats.
Tony sighs. "Look, we both know the guy has anger issues, which, not to point a finger—"
“Both.”
Steve rolls up the sleeves of his shirt and gets in position, then he pulls. The hammer makes a noise as if it's being dragged through the glass of the table but it's just a slight, minimal movement.
Tony makes a little pout as he nods. "Fine. Yes. Bye.
Pepper chuckles at someone using her real name. She can't even remember the last time that happened. "Call me Pepper," she offers instead, blushing a little when Maya smiles and nods silently.
And the stupid mark on his wrist.
If he cries a little on her shoulder, she understands.
Hulk had taken off in a quinjet after the battle was over and they hadn’t heard from him. They all thought it was weird, but Tony said something like “maybe the guy needed a few days to himself in the wild. Let’s give him time”.
He’s just standing there, looking at bright, green vegetables.
Rhodey’s too tired to keep pushing on being a proper leader figure; he’ll save that for the officer leadership test.
“Where am I?” he asks.
Tony stops her, putting his hands on her wrist. “No, Pep— that's, that’s personal, you don't have t—”
"Yeah—"
Tony lets out a breath, still averting his eyes from hers. “Maybe,” he replies.
In the dark screen he sees his own reflection and recognizes every bit of his face, unchanged, untouched, frozen in time. Just like he is.
“How did you notice? Why is he
Tony drops the bags on the couch and bends down to give his mother a tight hug. “Hi, Mom,” he says.
"Would you?" Hill asks right back. Her eyes curious but she's smirking.
Rhodey considers the thought a little longer. “So, brainwashing…”
I wanna apologize for missing for so long but I decided to work on a tiny monster fic in May of this year and it took away my attention off this one. I promise I won't take up another work until at least two more chapters heh
“So, yeah, no. I’ve been working on something else. Bigger, even, if you ask me,” Tony adds.
“No, it was just — one second it was there, the next it was gone. It felt numb, like, like he fell asleep or something,” Rhodey says and misses the point when Tony gives him a devilish grin.
called James,” Tony tries to joke but Rhodey’s not in the mood.
“Your father decided to take your mother on a holiday trip. They should be leaving tomorrow afternoon,” Jarvis explains, trying not to let his voice sound sad for Tony’s benefit.
"You know I wouldn't mock you, Tones. I'm just really proud of you," Rhodey says, then he puts his arm around Tony's shoulder and gives him a little hug. "You did it. Both you and Pepper," Rhodey adds, smiling down at the floor.
"But you said— Aunt Peggy..."
He moves his chin slightly up and goes: “Uhm— likewise,” Steve says, softly.
“Security breach,” Tony mutters, his hand on his head as he’s coming back from the bump. When Tony draws his eyes up, he sees the strange turning. “—Steve,” he blurts.
"I've known about Barnes since I talked to Natasha after the attack. She let it slide. When I went to see Steve, he didn't say a word," Tony says. "I gave him space since he was still coming off from that fight. But nothing, he hasn't said anything about Barnes being alive or trying to kill him. Nada," he adds, almost whining.
Steve just blinks at that, doesn’t know what to reply other than a stuttered: “S—Sure.”
"Three slugs, no rifling. Completely untraceable," Maria answers, unshaken.
Day and night, they are.
"One sec. One sec, I got this," Tony says.
“No, wait,” Tony says, standing up, driven by his embarrassment. “You know what? You got the job,” he announces, and Rhodey’s mouth falls open just slightly. “I was just telling Rhodey how I think it’s impressive that you—” he snaps his fingers at Rhodey to give him something.
role in our relationship,” he says, gesturing at Tony’s face as Tony sticks his tongue out. “Captain,” Rhodes addresses Steve with an extended hand that Steve takes firmly. “Sorry you had to hear him take a shit on me and everything I’ve worked for in my entire life,” he adds, with a fake smile.
Steve's hard and nearly leaking and he wanted this since Tony's second night in his apartment in Washington but he's completely at loss at how to react when Tony takes him all inside in one go.
“Want a lozenge?” He asks, jokingly and they leave them.
No more tricks.
"Pretty awesome, to be honest," he declares, finally. Rhodey chuckles at him.
“What I mean to say is that I can have something arranged for you. If that’ll get you to stop frowning so much—”
Peggy stares into his eyes and he can see her in her youth as he knew her in the deep of her brown eyes.
"Be it ever so humble," Steve mutters, getting a little lost in the lights.
He takes in another breath and takes his time. The room reeks of bleach and body sweat, and paper-money.
“Well, last time it was a Tower so…what? You got us the whole castle now?” Clint asks from the back of the couch they’re sitting on.
Rhodey frowns at him and Tony blinks slowly. "I— don't really wanna talk about that right now," Tony says.
Like this means the world to her.
spy. His secrets have secrets,” Tony replies. “It's bugging him too, isn't it?” he asks, pointing to Banner with his open hand.
When Tony sees the sun again, his knees go weak, and Rhodey has to put himself behind him to catch him in midair. After that, Tony doesn’t object to using the wheelchair while he gains his composure back.
Steve throws his head back and just smiles. "Mmm, you are the genius for a reason," he whispers.
"Yes, this is normal!"
“No,” Tony replies quickly.
“Hey, uh—” Tony addresses Sam and he stands up to shake his hand.
Yu blinks at him and stands from his desk, taking a few steps to stand at Rhodey's feet. "Is there something you want to say to me, Colonel?" he says, almost at his face. "Because I will have to remind you that not only am I your superior officer but that my wife is Jewish, so you think long and hard before you pull that card on me," he warns.
Steve knows what this all means.
“Yeah, well, last time was a little different…”
Zola informs him but he can barely understand the words.
Thor is taking steps towards him again. "This could have been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand—"
"There's no way I'm having sex in Clint's kid's bedroom," Tony says, serious and Steve shakes in laughs. "Nope, just no. That bunny's gonna stare at me the whole night," he says, looking at a blue-greyish bunny teddy sitting on top of the shelf.
Rhodey – who’s been the first person to know — is looking down and failing at acting like he’s shocked. At the end of the room, Pepper is shaking her head slowly. Ok, why the long faces? They’re friends with Iron Man; they should feel awesome right now.
After all, it’s Steve the one who’s been saving him from dying in his dreams lately.
"Alright, just tell me this, I need to know," Tony says, his palm open at him. "Did you sleep with him?"
Tony just turns to him frowning. "Ok. Do I ever ask you about your relationship with Natasha? Or what about this whole suspicious scenario, that you say Laura's your sister in law but what about your sibling then? You know, the one she's married to?"
read Tony’s mind.
“Have I ever told you how much I love you, Jimmy boy?” Tony asks, a heartbeat after putting the telephone against his ear.
“Tony—”
“Yeah, sorry about all this,” Rhodey says, tapping him on the shoulder.
“That’s because you’re moving slow!” Allen says.
"I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden— he's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is," Killian says, in a faked humor. "Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day," he says, at last.
Then she tsks his tongue and looks out the window. "'Cause— soulmates...it's a private thing," she answers and Steve pretends he hasn't known 'Clint Barton' is written on her wrist since the first day he met her.
“You know I did some digging in our little cases and we're part of a 12% statistics of people who have no name on their wrists. Apparently, there are big support groups and communities,” Tony shares staring at the ceiling, Rhodey takes a big sip and burps quietly. “You think we should try to join any?” he asks and Rhodey shakes his head.
“I’m just telling you, I’m willing to listen if you’re willing to talk. I’m not saying you have to,” Tony says, sighing.
Natasha looks down, she knows that self-doubt, too. “Thor, report on the Hulk,” she asks.
He steps in the boots and rolls his sleeve up just enough to see his wrist once more. Still empty.
"What?" Bruce mutters, walking towards it in the middle of the room. "This is insane," he whispers.
“The Stark Industries will have now a new face,” the headline reads, a picture of Tony posing with Stane behind him, his hands on his shoulders. “At the age of 22 — just shy of 23, Tony Stark just became the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company in all of history after his father, Howard Stark, died in a car accident last year. Tony graduated top of his class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is set to inherit the sixth biggest fortune in America’s history,” the article read.
He feels heavy on his chest. Unrested. Anxious, like he's being watched.
“I don't have a girlfriend,” Clint says and Tony doesn’t miss when he looks back to Natasha with a serious face and she replies by just putting a straw in her mouth and saying nothing.
Tony's tired of people making the assumption that he'd willingly want a genocidal robot to exist.
Tony takes a couple of steps back, away from the hole, before he answers: “For taking on Loki alone.”
“Alright,
“They said they just crashed into some fucking tree on the road, man. They were supposed to go on a stupid trip,” Tony tells him, eyelashes shining wet. They’re now sitting on the couch of the big room they’re in. “The police have been coming and going asking questions as if nearly every communist country didn’t want Howard dead but the final statement is that it was just some stupid accident,” he adds.
"SHUT UP!" he screams and throws another weak punch. Weak like he is. Powerless.
Tony shrugs. “Well, I’ve been a pioneer before. I’m not gonna start cowering from being one again, now,” he says, smiling.
Yu sighs and goes back to his chair. "I'm going to give you a week to gather as much intel on Barnes as you can," he says, sitting. "I'm sure once you know how terrible he is, you'll be comfortable with this mission," he says, gathering all the open files and placing them on a pile and handing them over for Rhodey to grab.
, it’s not the same thing,” Rhodey says.
“Funny things are,” Tony replies, just as sarcastically.
“The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside, something powerful,” JARVIS says.
Suddenly, he hears someone crack a laugh and Tony’s pulled hard back from his trance, too caught up in the heat of his inner rage.
Tony lowers his head, defeated, as it clicks in Steve’s brain. Now, he sees it: boxes all over the lab, some packed and sealed, some open and getting filled.
“Busy?”
"Avenging is your world. And your world is crazy," Sam says a beat later, as they look from the railing at the rest of the party unfolding.
But the man is unflinching. “You’re not gonna do anything, Barnes,” he says, his last name rolling softly on his tongue.
A few things before heading into this one:
"Yes. Yes, it would— Rhodey, he tried to kill his best friend," Tony says, pressing on the latter.
“Like it's thinking,” the doctor says quickly. “I mean, this could be— It's not a human mind. I mean, look at this— they're like neurons firing,” Bruce says.
"All right, I have a question for you," Natasha says then, after sitting right on her spot. "Which you do not have to answer," she adds, her finger raised. Steve gives her a look, waiting for her to shoot. "I feel like, if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know—"
Tony turns to him and waits, his hands still stuffed deep in his pockets.
Tony, who had been resting his back against the bar table and watched silently as they exchange occurred, goes: “It’s his birthday.”
That game can be played by two.
"It's not all just like that. The truth is a matter of circumstance," she says. "It's not all things to all people, all the time. Neither am I," Natasha adds.
“I’m sorry,” he says out loud, and puts his face into his palms and cracks, his back rolling down the door until he falls on the floor, his legs open, bent to support his elbows as he cries into his hands.
Tony tries to give a shrug in the suit but he fears he fails. “Bad things die hard,” he says and decidedly avoids turning his face towards
“Really, what? Making sure the world knows you’re tackier than anyone could ever imagine?” Pepper jokes.
Love.
What a shitty way of spending one’s 18
He gives her a look and smiles. It had been an eternity for her, but she still knew him, could still read him like an open book. "I really, really missed you," Steve says, grabbing her hand again, the golden ring shining on her finger.
“Promise,” Tony says but he’s ready to break that promise if it means keeping him alive.
“Like Christmas, but with more...me,” Tony replies.
Tony only lets out a soft chuckle.
“It’s Clint,” he corrects, doing a little peace sign, Rhodey just smiles.
Tony chuckles before he goes a bit serious. "I have to take care of something for a bit," he says.
“What do you mean?”
Tony just shakes his head. "I'm not asking like that— I'm asking as a teammate," he says.
Tony grabs it but then he holds it there, with Rhodey’s finger under his palm and eyes him suspiciously. "Ok. I have my amazing, out-worldly sex with my super-soldier, what about you? What are you so perky about?" Tony asks, his eyes squinting at him a little.
"So what happened with Ultron?"
Tony walks around the big table and catches up to the doctor. “Finally, someone who speaks English,” he says, smiling at the doctor.
So he makes up to go and decidedly not talk to him for several hours when Steve tries to grab him. "Tony—"
“Sure, Mister Jarvis,” he agrees. “Come on, man, I’ll help you and we’ll be done sooner,” he suggests and Tony sighs, defeated.
It actually makes him feel like he needs to talk. Like, fast.
"I don't understand—" Dr. Cho lets out from where she stands. They all turn to her. "You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us?" she asks Tony point-blank.
Steve lets his head fall on Tony's shoulder and sighs. "I'm quickly regretting not doing this in your room," he mutters.
"He's been out of cryo for just too long," a doctor says.
"Bucky?" the man says to him and his shoulder stings.
"Tony," Steve says, pressing, his Cap voice.
“Relax, Rhodes, we just wanna make sure we’re all the same here,” Davis tries. “You sure he’s clear?”
“Who are you?” he asks.
“The cell was just—”
“Well, the rules have changed,” Steve comments.
‘Anthony Stark’ is permanently written on his skin.
“Take care of yourself, Colonel Obnoxious,” Tony says softly, after letting go of him.
But the guy ducks under his arms and gets inside. “Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut,” Tony mutters.
“Thanks,” Tony replies. “Tell her to prep everything. Barton's gonna need the full treatment,” he commands JARVIS later.
"Parties unknown," Fury answers.
’s legs tangled with his own, and sighs.
"Oh, really? You don't wanna stay? We got spare rooms," Steve offers, they start walking towards the elevator door.
Pepper's eyebrows form a straight line before she gives up and shrugs.
At that Steve lets out a light chuckle. “This is really nice of you,” he tells Tony, almost too softly.
Steve looks at him and clicks his tongue. "He didn't love me. He loved Captain America, it's different," he explains. Tony turns back to him with a frown on his face. "Cap is the best side of me—  if only a little over-glorified sometimes. But I'm not always that guy, Tony," he adds.
“Why are you?” Rhodey shoots back. “I thought you trusted my decisions,” he adds.
“Wow, and they say I’m the one with a huge ego,” Tony mocks.
“Curve ball, high and outside for ball one. So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4. And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat, this fellow's capable of making it a brand-new game again. Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field,” the voice echoes in the room and he moves his head just enough to catch the rest of the room.
“Close it,” Steve utters, his heart sinking.
Next day, David makes good on his promise and does a good job at double-team training. They don’t come on top because Wagner and Davis are tight and vicious and also cousins on their mother’s side, but it’s good. Rhodey knows when to let his competitive side die down a little.
I'M BACK AGAIN! I know. I keep taking longer every time I leave. I'm sorry. Hope this makes it up.
"Like they don't want him to be found?"
“Yep. It seems like I’ll be making you and your boys new toys, honeybear,” Tony comments and Rhodey breathes out a laugh.
When they sit, Steve hands Tony his coffee and looks out the window. Tony sips his drink and lets caffeine do its wonders to his sleep-deprived body.
He looks at Tony expressionless and decides against following the instincts he's been following for his entire career. He looks at Tony – his platonic soulmate and confident in most things Rhodey would never admit having ever done — and decides to go down a different road. The right one.
So, maybe he forgets Steve’s been throwing him off lately.
The woman, tall with her high-heels and long neck, stands there for a couple of seconds but then she sighs. “This isn’t gonna work—”
The sound is deafening.
“You don’t understand as much as you think you do,” Steve mutters, utterly sad.
And then he’s panicking. He just kissed another man, and in public, in front of — “Hey, where did everybody go?” Rhodey wonders out loud, coming out of his yet-to-start panicking.
“Their abilities?” Steve asks.
Like they have been ever since stupid SHIELD fell to pieces.
-THE FIC IS TURNING ANOTHER LEAF. (Tomorrow, May 7) So, I just wanna thank you all again for joining me in this fun ride!
“No, I mean, I’ve caught up on the world and I’m sure you have your perfectly justified reasons to hate our government but I’m just saying,” Steve shrugs. “Rhodes seems like a good man and like he knows what he’s doing, otherwise he wouldn’t be in the position he is.”
Something in the back of his head tells him he should sit this down, step away, better leave it alone but there’s something stronger pulling him towards the dark spots. The parts of his mind that bathe in hate towards this spangled
But Tony can't be bothered, and under no circumstances can he leave. All there is now, like it has been lately, is work to do.
Rhodey waits while Tony gets ready for about thirty minutes, sitting in the empty living room. He rolls up the sleeve of his red shirt and looks at his empty wrist; he has to find a time to tell Tony as soon as he can or he’ll be pissed Rhodey didn’t say anything. Rhodey shakes his head and then rolls the sleeve back down.
“Right, the nice man. It’s— Rhodey, right?” she recalls, pointing at him, and Rhodey nods though he’s not used to the nickname anymore; it’s been a while since anyone’s called him that. “Please, come on in,” she says, opening the door for him.
"Right there's fine," Tony says, his finger up. "You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?" he says, his faceplate up.
Pepper smiles fondly at him and then twists her wrist for him to read. In deep black, thin lines, ‘Maya Hansen’ is written.
, Rhodey heard vaguely in one of his JROTC training in high school, years ago. That one rang louder than the thousand mean comments he heard in the hallways and on the court on his neighborhood, or the judgmental and plain scarring things the pastor would say in Sunday Service.
Rhodey almost lets out a whine as he goes over to one of the bar’s stools and sits. “I fell asleep at four AM trying to gather as much information on this guy as I could and nothing about him made any of this make sense,” he says, a little helpless.
He hears someone let out a soft laugh behind his back and turns to find Steve standing there, looking at the floor.
“What's the word on Strucker?” Steve asks Hill.
“So, d’you get it?” Jeanette asks, batting her eyelashes, trying to read his letter.
“Woah, woah, relax,” Rhodey says, opening his palms at him, but Tony's too busy growling at his arm. “Ok, what's wrong? Use your words,” he asks.
: anxietty attacks and nightmares as Tony experiences them in Iron Man 3, along with a brief mention of Happy's accident.
Steve makes his way to the Avengers Tower pretty quickly, considering the jammed streets of New York City. He uses his key to call the private elevator down to the ground floor.
But he can understand why Tony would be mad at the guy. After all, he tried to kill his soulmate.
“I know what I’m getting you for Christmas, then,” Tony says and Rhodey rolls his eyes.
“That’s not why I called—”
"So, this mission?" Rhodey asks again.
into the whole thing, which meant, pretty likely, that if Tony went anywhere near the action chances of running into
"Well, I'm sorry you've come under these circumstances but – we're leaving," Pepper speaks, then directly addresses Tony.
Some forty minutes later, they’re leaving the medical room. “There’s a room where you can get cleaned up; there’s a shower and—”
“Maybe it’s just a sign you’re meant to love yourself. Like, a lot,” he says. “Hey—why didn’t I get my own name?”
“Mister Jarvis,” Rhodey greets, offering a hand for him to shake because he isn’t sure they’re at the hugging stage just yet.
“They are,” Steve replies before the doors close.
Tony turns from his spot and then back to the blender. “Nah. JARVIS thinks he’s playing with a Rubik’s Cube,” he says, then smiles at Steve.
Tony sighs. "Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier," Tony answers.
Then Sam's knocking on the wall. "I made breakfast. If you guys eat that sort of thing," he offers.
Tony takes his wallet out his jean back pockets and drops a hundred bill on the table. "You should," he says, his eyes turning somewhat soft.
Jim gets out of the bathroom with a tug on his heart and he’s not even sure why, it’s not like he spent much time obsessing over this simple, biological human event. But feeling left out most of his childhood and teenage years, Jim expected his early-adulthood to be ordinary, relatable.
“You mean you?” Pepper cut in, her finger pointing at him.
He takes a breath slowly, relaxed. The words are still ringing in his ears but he feels nothing.
Only to find Tony doing lifts on bar with some special headwear.
Steve chuckles. “Maybe. But maybe I just think your mind is rushing, like a thousand miles per hour and – we just need to walk a little.”
“Tony Stark,” he replies and Sam lets out a chuckle.
The woman then takes a few more steps towards him. "Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent," she says.
Tony moves his head around and taps himself on the helmet. “Uh, uh-oh. No can do. This won’t open. Maybe I can try to just slide the pizza through the—facial slit,” he goes and Pepper just rolls her eyes, amused.
“You’ve gotta be kidding me—
Tony stands in the front door, next to Jarvis, waving his parents goodbye until the Cadillac rides off into the sunset.
Hill hands him her tablet. “Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed their apartment building,” she tells him. “Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special, but it's on the way to everywhere special,” she says as they make their way inside.
“Could use a few more. Where’s Clint?” Steve asks. He woke up this morning to see Clint’s new gifted motorcycle gone and Tony mentioned something about him wanting a jetpack before he took off.
Tony swallows and he lets out a soft smile but it's somewhat shaky. "Well, I'm not opposed to that at all— we, we got time. Tomorrow, after the dinner party—" Tony's saying but then Steve frowns and he stops. "What?"
“Sure thing. I’ll protect your ass, Rhodes. No harm will come to it,” Álvarez adds, totally inappropriately.
"I'm sorry, I was asleep," the suit interrupts, and Tony's had this nightmare a hundred times, years ago. "Or I was a-dream," the suit adds.
"Sorry for barging in on you," Steve says.
a man with his eyes and a mustache says, offering his hand for a high five.
"Saving the world should feel ecstatic," Clint says, throwing the bow on the floor and falling into the couch. "But I'm dead," he yawns.
Tony opens his eyes in surprise. “Is that a thing people actually do?” Steve moves his eyebrows in positive reply. “I hate this world,” Tony mutters.
“Cap? You’re with us?” Rhodey says, trying to bring him back. Steve blinks in response and nods at him, smiling.
It’s only when he’s drying himself that he notices it.
Son of a bitch.
"Tell me about the shooter," Natasha asks and Steve plays the moment in his head.
Rhodey just frowns. "Ok, so, I find this guy, I catch him and what? You think Russia or whatever former Soviet country is gonna hand him over? Just extradite him back to us?" he asks the two men around him.
Rhodey’s got him. He is safe.
"Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that," Fury says.
“I do. Besides this one,” Thor pats Tony on the chest, “There's nothing that can't be explained”.
"I know exactly what you want from me, General. I'm not naive," Rhodey says, biting his tongue not to say a different word.
Bruce’s mouth falls slightly open, at loss of words, and then closes it and smiles in disbelief. “Well, this is odd,” he mutters.
But it doesn't matter: at 1:03 a.m., Nick Fury died.
“I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I can shut the portal down,” Agent Romanoff says on their comms at one point, and he smells victory.
Steve takes a breath. "It was good but it's nothing like New York's," he says, shrugging a little.
"Yeah," Maria complies.
“I’ve missed you, Jarvis,” he says, genuinely. Nobody makes a cookies and cream milkshake as mean as his family’s butler does.
Leaving absolutely no trace behind, his wrist is now empty, clear, James-less. He repeats the same process he did months ago, when he got it: threw the towel to the ground and searched in every corner of his body.
“She'll take both. One to throw away and one to— not call,” Tony says and ignores Maya’s offer of one of the cards.
"Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby," Cap says.
“What happened? You got cheated on and couldn’t get drunk to forget it?” Tony asked, trying to be funny.
“Rhodes!” comes Tony’s voice. Rhodey finishes entering and his faceplate lifts up; he’s gotta see this with his own eyes.
“I wouldn’t miss this little Hollywood party for the world,” Sam adds, joking and pointing over his shoulder at Thor talking to a few other of the guys from the vet group.
Tony's about to be done with his last burger when Steve notices he's been staring at his work. Steve draws his eyes up and smiles as Tony almost flinches nervously, cleaning his mouth with a napkin.
He feels a special kind of fulfillment.
Then is Steve the one who understands: Tony wasn't looking at his drawing but at his wrist.
He just was intrigued by how long it would take him.
Of all the guys on Earth, it had to be
"Oh, c'mon, you're not gonna tell me you're actually afraid of him," Allen says, trying for humor but there's a question in his eyes.
"Look at your face! Oh, my goodness," Clint says, giving the girl a kiss.
“So you're saying that the Hulk— the other guy, saved my life?” Bruce asks him. “That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?” he adds, a little too defensively.
“Uhh, don’t—” Rhodey groans.
“Tony,” Obadiah greets on the screen, shirtless and in bed.
“Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places,” the Doctor instructs, taking off his jacket, and Nick nods. “Do you have somewhere for me to work?” he asks.
“Captain Rogers, wait!” the woman yells in the back but he just starts running his way out, any way possible. “All agents, code 13! I repeat. All agents, code 13!” her voice sounds through the place.
“I do. It looks less grim. You can see through the windows again. I take it that’s a good sign?” Rhodey says, after taking another look around.
Steve tries to smile but it comes as a doubtful gimmick.
So he calls for a gauntlet of the suit and he grabs it.
Pepper is just looking at her hands, going less orange by the second. "You know, I think I understand why you don't wanna give up your suits. What am I going to complain about now?"
“That’s better, Tony,” he says.
“He is honored,” the old man explains.
“Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?” Fury does a full-shift back to him.
Allen's eyes widen as he grabs the file and reads over the document. "'Bring in for questioning and trial'," Allen reads the order. Rhodey drinks from his cup once more as Allen continues to read over the brief. "Well, that makes sense," he concludes.
"Nukes?" Natasha says instead. "He said he wanted us dead."
The man nods at him, letting out a quiet breath.
"At least not by someone who's not them," Sam says.
Tony turns back again to see a car battery at the other end of the wires on his covered chest. The fuck. With shaking fingers, he starts to rip the bandage off his aching chest until it’s exposed. A magnet right between his ribs.
The doors open at the same time and Rhodey stops on his way, his hand on his hip in case he needs to pull out his gun.
Rhodey's wrist itches out of impulse. "Then, I'll act as I should," he replies with a smile and turns back on his heels to leave.
"Wow, less than 24 hours," the man in the expensive suit —Pierce, his mind quickly provides— says, looking at his watch as he stands in front of him and finishes giving him his mission report. "Impressive," he adds, looking back to him.
"'Earth's mightiest heroes'," Steve says, sarcastically. "Pulled us apart like cotton candy," he says, shaking his head.
There are seventeen more pages but Tony’s eyelids are giving up. He’ll get some more info tomorrow before he calls Rhodey to give him the hopefully good news.
"No one is going to torture him," Rhodey's quick to say.
Steve, however, is no longer amused, and just stares at him, his eyebrows forming a straight line.
Bruce scoffs a laugh behind him, focused on his screen. “Guy's not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us,” he says.
“Yeah, and I'll read all about it,” Bruce replies.
“That’s bullshit. Friends should go to therapy together, too. Call it frierapy,” he says.
“I don’t need your help to get into Harvard, jerk-face,” Jeannette mocks and Tony opens his mouth like he’s offended but then he starts poking her in the gut, trying to tickle her. “Stop it, you idiot,” she says, with a smile as she pushes Tony away. “Congratulations, morons,” she tells them, tenderly.
Rhodey also can see that. “It makes sense. Barnes was experimented on in 1943,” Rhodey shares.
Tony’s brown eyes linger on him with some kind of warmth when someone enters the room unannounced, breaking their little moment.
“I’ll be right there, Pep,” he says before he kills the line.
"You know I'd be dead without JARVIS. Isn't that right, J?" Tony asks with a smile.
“Listen, about before…” Tony trails off and Steve raises his head quickly.
“I—I meant—” Captain starts stuttering and Tony shakes his head to stop him, seeing Steve’s ears are starting to turn pink.
"Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me," Rhodey curses, his happy, fuzzy feeling flying out of the car.
So he pulls him by the collar, a few inches down, and kisses him messy on the lips. Álvarez smells like coffee and cologne and his scotch; it takes Rhodey all good of three seconds to gather that before he lets go.
"Nothing! We had
Pepper pulls him to sit on one of the couches of a little living room she has on the side of this big office and smiles again. “I didn’t think you’d get here this soon. I actually still have a few meetings scheduled this week,” she says.
Steve doesn't have it in his heart to say no; a huge part of him wanted to. But he knew what seeing Peggy would do to him, and her.
Rhodey goes downstairs slowly, still sipping on his coffee. Tony — being a kind soul he is — turns the volume of the loud Nickleback playing down and Rhodey's headache thanks him wholeheartedly.
Rhodey gives him a playful shove. They take a couple of more steps before Rhodey remembers. "They opened a section for him at the Smithsonian, you know?"
So Rhodey got to come back home with a few physical scars and far more physiological ones, got the rank of Captain on his shoulders for his services and the promise of going back to fight more fights in the name of America.
Tony swallows and averts his eyes from Steve, smiling down at his lap. With his head bowed, Tony looks smaller than he is, fragile.
Rhodey turns to give him a look with a smirk on his face.
“My people want nothing but peace with your planet,” Thor says.
Steve closes and opens his mouth again. “You know,” he points out and Tony doesn’t know what to make of his tone.
"In his language database," Tony retorts. "He was supposed to learn slang, not go insane," he mutters.
“You should have left it in the ocean.”
“Oh, and, no, I did not miss you,” Natasha tells him, just as she’s walking between them and back into the jet.
But it can't be. Because that's not his purpose. That's not his mission. No, this isn't what he thinks it is. It's the opposite.
In the reflection of the mirror, he sees Natasha, drying her hair with a towel and staring at nothingness.
Bruce is shifting next to Steve. "Tony, maybe this might not be the time..." he mutters.
Rhodey gets promoted to First Lieutenant before getting deployed to the UN’s mission in Somalia not long after, as part of a special operation squadron tasked with interdiction, reconnaissance, and psychological warfare missions against clan leader Mohammed Farah Aideed of the Habr Gidr subclan, who headed the Somali National Alliance.
Like him.
“What?” Tony replies, faking non-chalance.
Tony just stares at him and pouts. "Hill told me I was one of the first few million targets," Tony tells him like he's already aware, but Steve looks surprised. "Yeah, for Insight. I had just been chillin' at the Tower, just fucking choosing new paint colors for the walls."
He was getting self-conscious.
“No,” Tony replies. “There was a— cellist, I think,” he adds.
Rhodey does a full awed sigh, no shame in it, not anymore. “Fucking good.”
He sends the punching bag flying across the room and lets out a deep breath, it’s the fourth one this week. He moves around and grabs another bag, puts it up just as he hears someone come in.
“—And ever since she left, it’s your family I have had to call as my own,” Jarvis adds. “
Tony tilts his head, does one shake. "She's not really," he says.
“Hey. Uhm, did you clear this out with security?” Happy asks, a serious look on his face.
“Jim,” Allen cuts in, annoyed. “Why are you being impossible?”
"I've never done this," Steve lets out, looking at the carpet beneath his feet.
Maybe she can be his temporary assistant.
"Hey," she says into his shoulder.
“See? I told you, being my friend will get you some benefits with time—”
“Shit, honeybear,” Tony breathes. “That’s awesome.”
On one of the couches, Clint had his legs resting on Natasha’s lap as she went through a ‘Women in Power’ magazine with Dr. Elizabeth Ross as the cover. In the other one, Tony was resting against Steve’s shoulder as Steve had all his arm laid on the back of the couch, gently rubbing Tony’s arm.
Memories of Jarvis picking him up and taking care of his wounds after he fell some thirteen times over trying to learn how to ride a bike all by himself. Memories of him drying Tony’s tears off his cheeks after Howard’s yelled at him too loudly, too harshly. Memories of Jarvis telling him scary stories that made him giggle instead of scaring him right before bedtime. Memories of him teaching him the rules of rugby and soccer and why it was better than “any other American sport”.
“Fair point,” Rhodey concedes.
. Maybe we should go to couple’s counseling,” Tony mutters, after giving him an ugly look.
He sits the dead man back on his seat, placing his head on the steering wheel. “Howard!” a woman shouts weakly.
He was going to make his sacrifice worth it.
Tony gets up with a frown and then sits next to Rhodey. “Hey, there, pretty,” he greets her.
Tony takes it and turns around. “Oh, I finally met a man called Ho,” he comments and grabs Maya’s hand again.
"What do you know about the Winter Soldier?"
“I went to get this, but I didn’t wanna wake you. You looked like you really needed those extra minutes,” Steve says, handing Tony the goodies as Tony stands up.
The 'playboy' label was as big of a part of Tony as the rest.
“Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet, who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, out gunned,” Fury explains.
"HYDRA should be our focus. They should be the target. If I go after Barnes, I'll take out one head, sure, but..." he trails for Allen to follow.
But Rhodey can still hear Thor go: “But Jane's better.”
"Okay. Night-night," the woman says and he hears her footsteps fading quickly.
“You almost bought it, didn't you?” he says, chuckling. But then Maya’s wearing his glasses and smiling widely at him and he can’t remember the last time he felt this drawn to a simple hookup. He takes a breath and stares at her more before they start to lean in for a kiss.
Steve only frowns in return. “The what?” Steve asks and Nick takes a step closer to him, still looking down.
“It’s the only reasonable explanation,” Rhodey provides.
"I'm sorry," Steve breathes and he moves his head to kiss Tony. He can taste himself off him.
again who helped me beta half of this even though they had their hands a little full. You're still a sweetheart :3
Rhodey shuts the door close after shouting a "Stay here!" to Allen as he approaches the suspicious car.
Rhodey feels empathetic. What a terrible way of saying goodbye to your parents, with the whole world watching.
“You know what I mean,” Sam says, shrugging. “Wanna play?” he says, a beat later, and offers Steve a cue.
“You know, coffee has sorta the same effect as alcohol—it doesn’t really do much to me but I love the smell,” Steve says, handing Tony his mug. “It reminds me of my mother. She was always running on the coffee she got at work, so she’d always smell like it.”
Tony shrugs but he looks uneasy. "Of course I know. He almost killed Steve. I had to know who the fuck he was and what the hell he wanted," he explains.
“Honey-boo, your best friend is filthy rich, you know? I can just get you a first-class plane ticket,” Tony says and he doesn’t have to see his friend to know he’s rolling his eyes back to Saturn.
Steve feels Tony tighten around him and that alone almost makes him come but it wasn't until he caught sight of Tony in his expression of utter pleasure, seeing him seek out his orgasm, that he pretty much pulled Steve's out of him as well. Steve pulls Tony down, wrapping his arms around him and moving along with him, and they come like that, folded around each other so tightly that neither of them could say where one ended and the other began.
"Bucky," the man calls again and the name rings in his ears, it dries his bleeding mouth. "You've known me your whole life," he says.
Tony's name on his wrist was the one thing he kept going back to when everything else was deceitful and confusing.
“I promise you I will be the best teammate and fellow airmen you’ve ever had,” Álvarez pleads with his shiny olive-brown eyes.
“Like you controlled the Cube?” the Captain asks sarcastically.
Tony steps out from under the brand new and updated version of War Machine just after he’s done doing the final adjustment. “Alright, J, run the simulation and let me know how long ‘til Rhodey gets here so I can give him the good news,” he says, sipping from his water bottle.
She hands him the pen again and this time he does grab it. “Well, welcome back,” she adds with a smile, before leaving into the store.
“Harvard?” he asks.
Steve sees Tony swallow as the images flash and the Colonel crosses his arms as they watch the footage Steve saw on the news channel before. Once it’s done, Rhodes reaches for his jacket pocket.
It doesn't matter. He doesn't need to know him to kill him.
Cap lets out a breath but Tony can picture there's a slight grin on his face. "That's not going away any time soon," he mutters, but Tony can still hear him.
“And then shawarma after,” Tony repeats.
“It’s an early Christmas, it seems. Hey, gorgeous,” he greets her, after standing from the chair and offering Pepper his open arms for a hug.
Pepper holds back a little chuckle. “I’ll email you the schedule. There’s a couple of board meetings this week,” she says, getting up, and looking at her watch. “Oh, and they asked me to remind you, as I’m sure you must’ve forgotten with all the mess: MIT needs you to confirm your assistance to the alumni honors lecture next month,” she tells him, moving her bangs a little.
“Hello,” he greets everyone, holding onto his champagne bottle.
Tony shrugs. It was half doing what’s right for the innocent people of Manhattan, half to spite a certain assessment
He puts his flying suit, with his brand new Second Lieutenant insignia, in his bag. And with a big smile on his face, he takes the flight to Pueblo, Colorado.
Pepper just shakes her head once but her lips break into a grin, before she sobers up again. “No, but this isn't like that. They’ve been talking about the Avengers and regulations and... It reminds me of the time the government was trying to take your armor,” she says.
'Peace' is written in blood on the wall. "That's kind of a mixed message," he says.
Tony sighs and looks out the big window of the kitchen; in the front yard, Howard’s bright beige Cadillac Brougham is parked. “So, where is he, my old man?” he asks.
“Please, stop,” Rhodey mutters, turning back to rest his elbows on the bar’s table and rub his eyes.
Steve bends his knees in front of him sitting on the couch, and runs a hand across his face.
He finds himself in a building with wide, bright windows and people walking around in nice suits, takes a whole second to take it all in before they notice him and he has to go running again.
On his wrist, right above his veins, five years late, a name appears.
Tony moves his head to the side and goes, casually: “Unless you wanna do something else,” without blinking.
At least there’s enough on both of their plates for it not to be too awful or too awkward — Jim silently thanks the Lord for that, he still has a few more years to spare here.
It was more than just polls this time, it was the whole damn government.
"Ok, so, if that's the theory then how do you explain
Tony’s walking close behind her. “Except, there’s been a—radiation leak!” he yells, behind her.
“You’re a civilian—”
He'd been wandering around in the city, successfully hiding in plain sight like he was trained to, before he found something remotely useful.
Rhodey takes the folders slowly, with a stern face, but he feels like a child who doesn't want to eat his vegetables.
“Or maybe it’s just trouble getting into you,” Rhodey says, his tongue rolling lazily inside his mouth. Consumed by the power of the 0.02% of alcohol on his system, he tilts his head and smiles far too fondly at his former roommate.
Álvarez does his best not to stare back and blinks. “Can I ask a personal question?” he goes, Rhodey does his best not to roll his eyes.
Pepper smiles a faint but satisfied smile. “Tears of joy. I hate job hunting,” she jokes back.
Tony just glares at him and Steve drops his grip to go shake Fury's hand amicably. "If we had, it would've been your fault anyway," Tony says and Clints pretends to be offended.
Steve flat-out laughs this time and Tony opens his eyes just so he can see that, and smiles once he does.
Tony bites his lower lip, the corner of his mouth drawn up, and nods. “But go ahead, talk to him, he’s fun,” he asks, his hands doing a little offering motion.
The uniform had always been tight but this time it’s proving to be a real problem.
"Worthy..." Tony hears echo in the apartment, as he looks at his control panel.
“Nobody roped me into anything—”
“So you're starting with plants?” Tony asks, sitting on the bed.
“Yeah, right. This is a team—”
," Tony says, after shaking his head a little. "Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy," he adds, with a hand on his chest. "The end of the path I started us on."
Tony closed his eyes, in a dramatic, pained expression. “Oh, right. Shit, that must really suck.”
“Put on the suit, let's find out,” Rogers says, his jaw tightened.
Tony settles on the couch, laying his arm on the back and pointing to Steve with the hand that’s holding his glass to sit on the couch in front of him. “Yeah, I’m not ready for her to whup my ass for trying to save the city,” he says, smiling, his glass to his lips again.
“It's right here,” Rhodey says, showing Tony the little statue.
“Well, you won’t get anything more from those fragments than we already got. And I’ve gotta move—see if I can lend a hand with that ‘situation in New York’,” he tells his superior officer.
“So it doesn't count,” Steve says in an asking tone.
The feeling in his gut had been right.
Almost seven feet tall, what Steve guesses is Tony’s new suit hangs from the ceiling, attached to chains and cables as it’s brought to its final completion.
“I feel you,” Tony says, but he hasn’t really believed in God since December of 1991.
"No, no. Pep's my friend. Like, one of the longest ones. I tried to make a move on her but she threatened to sue me— it was funny," Tony babbles, jokingly. Half-ish. Steve's eyebrows just rise. "Anyways, no. I haven't had food," he finishes.
"Sir—"
“Assuming the arc reactor takes over and actually works?” Pepper retorts.
Thor smiles sarcastically. “Yeah, yeah— I’ll ask Heimdall to keep an eye on you. Just let him know then,” he explains.
“Steve. It’s fine. I’m not pissed, I get it. I just wish I hadn’t missed all that fun. Hey,” Tony says, grabbing Steve’s hand again, just to get his attention.
"Yeah. I got her before she could voodoo my ass," Clint says, and he puts Natasha on a chair. Her eyes look completely void. "Whatever she did to them, it's not good," Clint says.
She’s only taken a few steps in when she goes: “There’s a giant bunny outside,” Pepper declares, her thumb over her shoulder. “Oh, what?” she says as she notices the Iron Man armor lying on the couch, just chilling.
“I was thinking the first time I kissed you, you had just come off from your mission with the Mandarin,” Steve comments, looking up at Tony for a change.
“She moved back to Portland,” Phil says.
Steve's about to start considering dragging him back up when Tony buries his face in his crotch, without further ado.
Rhodey gets to the Stark mansion in Manhattan with some help from the butler – who Tony has to thank for what remains of his sanity– on the phone.
Maya shoots daggers with her eyes. "If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?" she asks, taking a few steps back from them.
Kate smiles at him, teasing. "Not as good as yours, apparently," she says. Kate draws her finger up in the direction where Tony just disappeared. "That your boyfriend?" she asks.
“You don’t ruin anything, honey,” she says.
"Uh—I'm sorry. What party?" Tony interrupts, his index finger up between them making heart eyes at each other.
“Hey, I’ve been sending you letters—”
“Wait, I don’t get it,” Banner says, blinking.
“We’re waiting on you now,” Tony says, passing by his side and into the plane, Happy behind him with the bags.
If his handlers could see him right now, they’d be ashamed.
‘Kinda like you’, Tony’s less side of him wants to say. “Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow,” he says out loud, because his better side is still no good at all. If the Captain’s already uncomfortable, Tony might as well make him more so. “What's your thing? Pilates?” Tony asks, facing him for the first time.
He says goodbye to Tony just shy after 1 AM and then he's landing back to California, settling in his spare room at Edwards. In a few hours, Tony will get to present his new baby to Rhodey’s new superior, General Gabriel, and it could land him on a sooner promotion.
They’ve been working on the special weapon for three months when their captors start to get doubtful until one day someone different comes to the cave. He’s bald and looks far more in charge than the man with the beard.
“Well, and how are you now? You’ve made peace with the fact that you’ve returned to the land of the marginalized, mate-less souls?” Tony asks, starting to walk into the building.
Still quiet, Steve just stares at him, his eyes getting a little softer as he takes a few steps towards Tony.
Pierce turns from the fridge and spots him, stops on his tracks a little.
Steve laughs and bites his lower lip, Tony does everything in his power to pretend he didn't see that. "I mean
Right. That thing they had been fighting over for the past four hours. "Okay, we've been through this, nope," Tony says.
"Just give it to him, I— I don't like being handed things," Tony says with a polite smile to the Churro guy.
"It's the world internet hub in Oslo," Bruce answers. "Every byte of data flows through there. Fastest access on Earth," he explains.
“Rhodes?” someone calls behind him at the bar they’re at.
“I really like my floor at the Tower,” Steve says, flipping the button for the machine to start making coffee.
“I’ll be back as soon as I have a free window, alright?” he says at Steve’s face.
“Flat them out and look,” he says before he does it himself. Showing the special, metal suit weapon that can quite possibly help them escape.
with his finger. “Are you above or below angry bees?” he adds, his eyes narrowing.
His only question is why are they going after Barnes in the first place.
,” Rhodey says, but he sounds amused enough. “No, Tones, I mean I got a name, a mark,” he explains, pressing on the last word.
He’s not James, but it doesn't feel wrong this time.
“Learn your military hierarchy,
Steve smiles a little too big at that. "Right. I'm glad you feel that way," he says.
“I know. Just, tell him that after some time has passed. I’m sure Steve will open up once he’s healed enough,” Rhodey says.
“Funny, mos’ people mistake meh f’r da devil, not Jesus.” Desiree gave a small smile. “Meh names Desiree, ah know we ain’t officially met.”
“You know they say the same about you, Flit.” Mara said, watching her brother rush out of the safe house. “Are you following.”
“Nosy, this is between us.” Tony glared at him.
“I still have to contact the rest of the team.” Ryan said.
“We got everyone.” James assured her as they started moving toward the location of the jet. The sirens in the city were in all directions and getting louder as they grew closer. As the two entered the jet, Desiree moved to the front. “Lift the ramp and take off, keep the door open, Hades I need you to finish off the trucks, we don’t need them repairing them, the less they have the better.”
“I’m irreplaceable Pops, besides I like being an older brother. Even if he is breakable.” James said. Steve laughed and rolled his eyes. “Look I heard stories from Uncle Bucky about you with no muscle trying to take on everyone.”
“I think that is the most I have heard him speak, ever.” Tommy said, breaking the silence in the room. “So we have four heading the S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters, Daken is going to find his sister, and I’m guessing Johnny and Bucky are going with him. What are the rest of us doing.”
Canadian Compound- Medwing
“Wait, as in Desiree? I haven't seen her since she left Xavier’s, She was one of them rescuing taken mutants? I thought she was down in the south, I just heard a rumor around here that the LeBeau’s were compromised and nobody knows where they are, I thought that included…” Vivienne suddenly stopped talking as someone grabbed her arm “Hey!.”
“Obviously they failed!” Jade yelled, her eyes having filled with tears into her eyes. “You didn’t see what we saw! You didn’t see the fear in their eyes, you didn’t see the death. They didn’t even try to just take us, they went in to kill us. Children. Children that some of our parents died trying to save.”
“The many Adventures of Bow and Ho” Natasha told them, and suddenly, Tommy and Dakota both started choking on their popcorn. “I take it you follow them?”
“I know. Look. Sue was hurt in the fight with them. I’m trying to keep Johnny at a good level and it isn’t going well, his sister is hurt and they took his daughter. Just make sure they don’t get Kielar.”
“Why would Kielar not be okay? He’s with us, of course he’s fine.” Tony snapped and then stopped as Steve put a hand on his arm. “Sorry. Yes. Kielar is fine. Is Karla?”
"Is it the same way you found out about this entire thing?”  Azari only received a nod from her. “Than I will not ask anything else.” he stopped speaking while he glanced over the files, seeing each of the photos. He paused at the red headed boy for a moment. Desiree watched him with a smile. “Don’t you dare.”
Tony had bonded with Kielar in the same way that he had with his own son, and the three were often in the lab together. What had surprised the former Iron-Man, though, was the bond that Kielar shared with Steve. It should not have surprised him though, Kielar was one of those kids that seemed to get along with most adults. While Tony could help keep Kielar’s mind busy with lab work and mechanical building, the training Steve gave him had helped even more. Kielar was after all only half human. His other half was Inhuman, his mother being Crystalia Amaquelin, the Princess of the Inhumans of Attlian. They were still learning what the effect of this would have on him. They knew of the twins older sister Luna, and for so long they had believed that her genetic markers cancelled each other out, making her a normal human. That had been false
“I won’t leave you here.” Blaine told her. “We can leave together. It will be safer. Right?” He asked looking at his friends. Nicole looked at Ryan, as if having a silent conversation with him, a habit they had picked up when they were agents together. “I won’t leave her.” he said firmly.
“I know that it's the safest place for him, and I know you won’t let anything happen to him.” Daken said. “I have to clear up the line, you make sure everything stays calm on your end and I’ll take care of things out here. Your speedster will be fine. I don’t think there is much left at Xavier’s, I have a team coming in dropping off a plane full of mutants we got from the vans. Remember, only this line to contact. It’s secure. Everyone is to be checked before they enter the building for tracking devices.”
Everything happened so fast, and usually when Tommy Stark described things like that it was an exaggeration. From the moment he was woken up by his friend, to the moment he disappeared, he was moving, still half asleep. When the gunfire had begun, it woke him up as Steve shielded him from any bullets. Then he had heard the command, one that he could never disobey. He was being told to leave, to leave his dads. He listened to Kielar try to argue; he watched him disappear, and then Tony slapped a bracelet on Tommy's wrist and activated one of the iron man suits.
The three Xavier students looked around at the others that filled the room. A majority of them they recognized from the Avengers roster, those training to take position as the older members retired. There were however a few from Xavier’s. Too few, and it hurt to see that not many of their friends had made it to the same location as them. They could only hope that they would arrive later, that they had survived.
Francis and Mara were lounging on the couch watching YouTube   when they received an alert. The archer clicked it immediately and his mouth dropped open as he saw an all too familiar face appear. “That…” Francis began.
"Unsure at the moment. We need more information.”
As they approached the door it opened and immediately the yelling was heard. Reed and Johnny looked at eachother and before either of them could say anything an unlikely person took charge. “Shut the hell up! All of you!” Daken yelled over them and slammed his hands down on the table that separated most of them from getting into physical fights.”Some of us have fucking sensitive ears, so how about we not yell.” Johnny was surprised at how level his voice was, he had definitely changed since he last saw him.
“Contrary to what you might believe, kid,” Daken began, without turning around. “Xavier’s is not the only place in the world where mutants exist.”
“I don’t want to talk about Sue right now Daken.” Johnny told him sternly.
“I didn’ say nuthin.”
James moved through the crowd with Azari close behind him. They reached the small stage that the two had been standing on and Mara smiled down to them. “Hello bratan!” She jumped off the stage. “Have you come to join the fun, or continue to be a stick in the mud.”
“Bucky is a good father to him.” Daken said and turned back around. Bucky looked at his partner incredulously.
“We are going to try to contact them as soon as possible.” James assured her. “We aren’t sure who made it out and who didn’t. We can start figuring that out once we get to safety. You all are our top priority right now. We need to focus on getting those collars off of you so you aren’t able to be tracked. Once we are over the border we will touch down and check injuries as well.” He told them, trying to bring the situation to a calmer level. His eyes every so often moved toward the back where Desiree sat with her eyes shut tight and hands over her ears. “We know that the Baxter building, Stark Tower and Xavier’s have been hit, we aren’t sure about the west coast Avengers but we have people trying to get into contact with them. We also know that they raided the Guthrie farm. We do not have the number of casualties but we are doing our best”
“Then we are…”
Karla laughed. “It was good actually. We learned a new cheer, and I passed my English test today. I can’t wait until I graduate though, the second semester will be such a rush. I can’t wait for Prom. I think Kielar and Tommy will end up going together, I’m hoping Benjamin Worthington asks me, he would be a fantastic date.”
“I agree wit’ him Papa.” Henri spoke up. “And y’ know dat don’t happen often. Y’ stuck in da fight dis long. Y’ ain’t bein’ left behind. We don’ know what dey will do t’ y’. Y’ adopted a mutant, y’ protectin’ mutants. Dey know all of dis. Y’ comin’ wit’ us.”
“Coming here alone was even stupider, and you decided to engage in a protest? The morning after everything went down?” James sighed. “I know you are smarter than this. They got you on video Tommy, so now they know where you are. Why would you come here? I know you have better places.” Tommy crossed his arms, remaining silent as his brother scolded him. “You need to try and get out of the country before they find you. Pops and Tony were arrested, they are working on getting them out. You need to go somewhere safe though, do you have…”
“I’m technically a clone.” Tommy piped up as he walked over to Kielar. “Most of you were as young as I was when it went to trial so you probably don’t remember anything about it. But yeah, government tried to have me removed from my home. They said that I was nothing but an experiment that happened to work. S.H.I.E.L.D was the one who informed them about my existence and how ”
Azari gave her a nod. “Then I will call him that as well when I meet him.” he told her. He turned the next divider over. “These are the ones we were not told about, though, they did not seem happy with the Fantastic 4 from what I could tell. This young man,” Azari pointed to a younger photo of Kielar that had him with black hair. “Is the same one that is listed with the Avengers, so this may have been put together before his move, this one is his sister.” he explained.
“Tommy, you have six pairs of  skinny jeans on the bed and three tops.”
“But you’re so good at it.” Blaine replied back with a grin. Devon grabbed a pillow and hit Blaine in the face with it, causing the boy to yell out. Bruce shook his head and laughed as the two wrestled. He never really worried about them breaking anything, they always avoided things in there way. Bruce didn’t know how, but they did.
The eighteen year old stopped just outside a small coffee shop. “I have to go now Mother. It was very nice speaking to you, maybe we can get lunch before I leave for California,” he suggested and stopped to listen to her. “Of Course, that sounds lovely. I love you as well.” He ended the call and walked into the coffee shop, stopping at the door and giving it a quick glance before spotting the person he was looking for. The girl had her hair in a ponytail, with her bangs framing her face and a pair of dark sunglasses. She would have looked like any other teenager in there if her bangs hadn’t been pure white against her brunette hair. “Desiree.” He greeted as he approached her.
“Thats good, thank you.” She told him.
“She is my sister and a good person. You do not know her so I would suggest you stop speaking” Azari said said, moving off the couch. “You see her on that television. But you do not know her story. We would be lucky to have her with us. She is a very loyal person and if what I say does not convince you, I assure you that my mother will speak on her behalf.”
“I did that because we do not know what is safe anymore. Do you not realize the kind of shit happening right now?” Dakota asked them holding up her tablet. “This is footage of the Baxter Building.” She said before going to the next video. “This is Stark Tower, The Avengers compound in upstate New York. Drone footage from the Guthrie farm in Kentucky.” She continued. “And that is just a few places. West coast facilities have been hit as well. This place won’t hold everyone.”
“That makes sense.” Renee said as she looked around the area. “How many people are here?”
“They didn’t. This place was a very well kept secret from a lot of people, including those at the Xavier Institute. Relations between the Avengers and X-men have been rocky at times, but Tony, Mr. Stark wanted to make sure there was always a safe place for Kielar. In turn it became a safe haven for other super powered beings on the new Avengers team. That being said, they were never going to turn away people, as long as there is room. “
“Francis?” Clint said. “Don’t even think about it.” he told him, and his son started laughing. “I’m serious kid.”
“Its the covert team coming from New York. Go see them.” Dakota told him. “I will take care of getting everything into the computer, I can go through Daken.”
Dakota Potts worked endlessly to make sure those coming in were as comfortable as possible. She finally had a moment to sit behind her computer, she pulled up the West Coast Avengers Compound and watched the feed of it being raided earlier. She leaned back in her chair and let out a sigh of relief seeing that it was empty. Dakota wasn’t sure if it was because they had warning, or they had all just gone out for the night, but she was relieved. “Where are you?” She whispered to herself before she hacked into surveillance cameras throughout L.A. “Got you.” she said, continuing to talk to herself as she erased the footage of her friends from any of the cameras. When she got to the last one and saw where they were she smiled. “You better contact me as soon as you can Mara.”
Now, though, he could only hope he wouldn’t get recognized. It was why he wasn’t using the suit of armor unless he absolutely had to. The walk had taken hours, but he was now at least in the city limits. He walked into a small diner and slipped into a booth, finally feeling like he could breathe. He was in the middle of nowhere at almost two in the morning. Exhaustion took over his entire body as he sat down, and when the server came over to him, Tommy knew that it was noticeable.
“Sometimes I forget that you four are part Howlett.” She smiled a bit. “We can’t go anywhere, our ride will be here by tomorrow morning if anything.”
“I won’t get caught, you trained me. I’ve been training for years for something like this. You need to be there for Cassie and I need to know you both are as safe as possible.” Jett paused. “Mom please. Trust me. I can do this.”
“I would like that.”
“We could have used your help at Xavier’s you know” Jade spoke up after the silence had taken over. “Most of this could have been prevented if you all had shown up there.”
She walked back out and to the kitchen. After making her tea she took a seat at the table.It had become a routine to do this before bed. The tea helped her relax and she was able to sleep after having a cup. Dakota looked back towards the hall where the light was bright from Tommy’s room, and she could hear laughing from the two friends. She knew she had made the right choice to go with them. She looked down at her watch as it started beeping, alerting her that someone was in the system of Stark Tower. “Just in time, Happy, let them see the files for Today, September 15, 2038.” She said and waited for the AI to respond.
“Thank TJ”
New York was far from a quiet city, even in the late hours of night. Most people who lived in the city could hear people outside, or cars driving by. There were those lucky enough though to have buildings high enough above the streets to avoid the chaos below. The ninety-three story building on Broadway, Stark Tower, was one of many. Like most nights, the tower was black, except for the ninety-second floor, the residential area.
“Good. They might be heading over to you. I called from a secure line, and I know you have top security.”
“Wait, wait just a second.” Karla said. “Are you telling me? Daddy, tell Kie, you don’t know how terrified he is that you will reject him because of this. It would be such a tremendous thing. And after all this fighting since he tested his DNA, you guys need something to like bond over. You both are so stubborn. This could go on for ages.”
So he ran. He ran as fast as he could, his shoes not lasting very long at the velocity he was going. The route they told him to take was one that would throw anybody off, but in a matter of minutes he was at a compound in Canada. As he slid to a stop, he fell back, and made no movement to stand up again. He remained in the same spot until he felt someone stand over him. “You okay kid?” the voice asked. Kielar knew that voice, it was so recognizable, but he just didn’t have the energy to move, or speak now. “You're safe. We knew this would happen sooner or later. Let’s get you inside Kielar.” the man said as he lifted the teen up with ease.
“California.”
“Wow, I didn’t even realize how much time he spent beforehand. Mom always said I should talk to you about all of this.”
“But the X-men won’t go down without a fight right? They know how to take care of this kind of thing...they..” Kielar started, worry dripping as he spoke.
“Unknown.”
“It was a rough night,” Tony responded. “He still has them but they’re becoming more rare.”
“I am NOT jealous.” Azari declared. “They just do everything together and this was one night that we could actually dance and be together, not that you would get out there.”
“Do you have their names?” Blaine asked, trying not to sound interested.
This was why, instead of Germany, he was in L.A, looking for his older brother James. He was tired, that was a fact, and he needed to conceal his identity. Luckily for him, when people saw Tommy, he was usually in high fashion, with makeup and nails done, not sweats and an old baggy t-shirt, with his hair tousled in every direction. Kielar would not be happy with him, but he could take Kielar’s wrath, he could never stay angry at him long. He would have to focus on that later, he would see Kielar later and they could hash everything out. It would be fine.
Chapter 5: Tommy Stark
“Oh I know, but at least it’ll be later. Maybe she’ll leave a voice message and we can just delete it.” Francis said as he leaned back in his seat and grabbed a hat clint kept in the back seat and covered his eyes. “But that will be later, at least we don’t have to deal with it now.”
The buildings in the lead given to them were the most known and recognizable, the Baxter Building, Stark Tower and Xavier’s School for the Gifted. All three rumored to be hiding mutant individuals. They watched and waited. They stood on guard. They felt the gush of wind move past them as the lights came on in Stark Tower and as vehicles left the Baxter building.
“I really hate dealing with that bastard.” Tony grumbled. “Jarvis.”
The room fell silent as all the kids were left alone with their own thoughts. Kielar’s mind raced from his father’s words still, and as he looked around the room at those who remained he took a deep breath. “They’re right. We trained for this. We’re the ones who are going to have to do this. If you want to join the fight, basement level 3 is where training will take place. If you don;t think you can handle it, nobody will judge you. But we need to do something, and to start, we need to learn more about each other and what we are able to provide to the team. So you have until tomorrow morning to make the voice on whether you will fight or not.” he said and made a beeline for the door, Tommy right at his side. Once they reached the elevator and stood inside, Tommy looked at his friend.
The young adult had just found out that Phil Coulson was not her biological father and had stepped back from S.H.I.E.L.D rather easily. They had tried to convince her to stay, but to no avail. It was something she had been determined to do. Since she left, she was on better terms with Agent Coulson, but still refused all attempts at getting her to return. She had grown up wanting to be an agent and now wanted to step away and be her own person.
“He’s psychoanalyzing us again B.” Devon said not turning around.
“Got it mate” Hades responded and moved to the door. As they flew over the scene they had just left, the street lit up in flames and the explosions heard in the distance as the door closed and everyone settled in for the ride. It was silent for a while, The rescued mutants coming down from the adrenaline of every event that happened that night. Daken’s team sat in the back, finally able to rest for even a moment.
“I’m glad that is how I am coming off. I don’t need people to know that I am not okay right now.” He said. “But, I am better than I was. Bucky got work from this team he knows and they were able to rescue some of those taken, Karla was one of them. I know she’s alive but, I still can’t…” he taps the side of his head. “The link isn’t there and it hurts. It's like a part of me is gone. I really need to see her and make sure she’s really okay.”
*****************
In the living room there was a loud crash, which brought quite a few of the teeangers out, more out of curiosity than anything. Kielar was leaning against a wall, which now had a hole in it. Tony kneeled down next to the boy checking him over before helping him up. Keilar froze as soon as he knew they had an audience. Tony turned to where Kielar was looking. “You okay kid?”
“Bet you twenty if I called Nat mom she would answer.”
“Originally, but Tony made you a couple of pairs too. They knew you would end up here. This place was built with you in mind. Tony doesn’t have many mutant kids he needs to hide you know.”
“I don’t know, I’m not very good at stuff like that. I just say what I know…”
“No, it's not but we had a sizable number of people there. Do you know how many were killed? Taken? You didn't have to see them die. You…” her voice broke as she spoke. “They didn’t all get out. I don’t even know what happened to my mom and dad.”
“You and James stay here, I’ll be fine, my mom is there and she won’t let anything happen to me.” Francis said, “I need to do this though. I’ve sat here and heard exactly what the government is doing and it needs to stop. Someone needs to step in before it goes any further, and S.H.I.E.L.D has a voice that has been heard in the past. They need to help.”
“That is not a wise choice.”
“They’re fine. Tommy got out, Steve and Tony have been arrested though. Pepper is working on getting everything taken care of.” Bucky said, quickly trying to reassure him in the end. The older man had dreaded the night that this would happen. The Avengers had known it was coming, the X-men had as well. Each night at least one hero would stay at the facility just in case. Nobody had wanted Kielar to arrive there to an empty building, knowing that it would not have been a good night for anyone. “Nobody is hurt, except a few of the soldiers who invaded the tower.”
“No no. Daddy and Jimmy yell loud.”
The years continued to pass, and the laws tightened for mutants. The year 2040 came, and the Mutant Registration Act passed, the last thing signed by the president before his re-election. When he won again, the panic began.
“Of course not, but there is a time and place flit, and you have awful timing.” Mara told him.
“And we will be returning to Wakanda.” T’Challa approached. “There are not enough resources for those who are here. It would be wise to have some return with us. We can train those who would like to, and allow those who need it to just have a safe place to be. We will remain for the night, as we have contacted Stephen Strange to help with the transport.”
“You are jealous.” Sue told him. “Tony has done so much for Kielar, so has Steve. You should be a little more grateful for the two of them. Your son has a place he can go after your fights with him. You know it isn’t his fault he looks like Pietro, or that he has similar powers. You knew the moment you took the twins in that it was a possibility. I don’t know why you want to fight now, when they are almost out of high school.”
“That...that is fair, but also I was very sleep deprived.” Tommy defended himself.
“Wait!” Tommy yelled. “We’re going to work with mutants?” he asked. “Please tell me it will not include the LeBeau girl.”
Laura turned to the two men but remained silent as she eyed them. “Thank you.” she said simply before turning and walking inside to help the rest of her family. Bucky and Johnny looked at each other and shrugged before going to help them.
“No, that’s when he sits there and asks us all those questions about our childhood, right now he is is doing a behavioral study.” Blaine explained to his brother. “They’re different but he does both and I don’t think he realizes it. You do it to him too, I only know that because you start talking about all his quirks.” He finished as he shoved a cookie in his mouth.
Tony nodded as he glanced around the room and tossed down a few other files. “We are not going to go directly through the X-men. There are several students who have been kicked out recently or are looking for alternative training that have been sent out invitations.” Tony said. “We have Desiree LeBeau, Sarah  Ross, Isaac Allerdyce, James Howlett Jr., Charmaine, Kestral, and Jayson Kinney-Guthrie, Heather and Eliza.” he said. “We are also bringing in two additional teachers, Bucky Barnes and Daken.”
Vivienne Worthington and Jett Wisdom had known each other since they were children. Their training had begun at around the same time and they were familiar with how the other moved. Vivienne knew that Jett never hesitated to move through the shadows, but he did when he created creatures from them, because once the creature swallowed someone, that person would no longer be alive. Jett knew his friend used her telepathy with ease, but flying was something she opted to avoid as much as possible. Their hand to hand combat styles were similar, having the same teachers, but often rotating out. They had been sparring partners since they were twelve.
“What do you mean?” Devon answered as he tossed his empty container in the trash.
“All of you worry too much. It’s going to be fine. If I heard right when I wasn’t eavesdropping, it’ll be like having Logan around, just more murdery and less old.”
“You know Dev, one day, I’m going to find someone in this world that finds me absolutely adorable, and you are going to wish you chose to dress as fashionably as I do.” Blaine smiled. “Now, help me out, which bow ties am I taking with me. “
Azari went to the end of the first tab that was filled with all the teenagers he had just seen at Stark Tower. The second tab was labeled X-men, and had a bit less information given to him. He looked at Desiree questioningly. “Mos’ of the Avengers are very public, that information ain’t anythin’ not known already. I can’t care details about mutants aroun’. If that were to end up in the wrong hands…” she trailed off.
“Fast asleep. Didn’t even know anyone else was here. Still wanted to see you before bed. I don’t know why you left him here with me. You should be with him.”
“Pretty sure that’s why Pops isn’t with her anymore.” James told his brother.
“You will kid, I promise, it was just an update I needed to give him so he can handle something personally. Are you ready to get back to Pup?”
“There has to be something. People can’t just disappear like that.” Kielar said. “I mean, I guess they really could but, I don’t think any of the LeBeau’s could pull that trick off.”
As the four sat and ate their ice cream several customers came in and out as it neared closing time. As the last ones left, several pings went off in the back room, making Eliza rush back. When she returned, her face was pale, and she looked terrified. “Blaine. You guys have to go. Something has happened and it isn’t safe.”
The common area was at least quieter than usual where the man could regroup himself. It was getting later into the night and he knew a lot of them would be heading to bed, there was training in the morning for those who wanted it. Bucky was still trying to deal with seeing Johnny’s face when he found out about his daughter passing. The look on Kielar’s when he saw him. He absolutely hated those looks.
“Hmm, okay. Not as bad as I thought. Now, is there a way to activate the tracker that I snuck onto James’ communicator?” Tommy asked the computer.
“Thats impossible my dad had that…” Jade said started. “They knew about the blade. They…” she trailed off.
Natasha let out a long exasperated sigh and refused to look at any other person in the room. “I know.”
“No. Listen to me. You have not done anything wrong. They are not in the right here and we are not handing you over to these people. We’ve talked about this, and you know exactly what to do. You were trained and you are good. Steve would not have handed you his shield if he didn’t believe in you. So, no matter what happens, you run, you go to the location I had you memorize and you stay there. They can’t touch you there and they won’t. “
“And what about you and Mara?”
“The Fantastic four can be left out for all I care,” Steve said. “After what happened with Kielar I highly doubt that they will want any part of what we do.” he crossed his arms, obviously angry with what had taken place between him and the other team.
“Second guessing what?” Clint asked leaning over the back of the chair.
“I...you’re welcome Blaine” Tony said before looking at his friend who was no help to him and shrugged.
“Okay....” Francis said. “Just so you know, seeing you flustered like this is new, and..”
The girl sparked protests around the world. She used her voice to bring justice to the boys who had hurt her. It failed. They tried to anger her. To prove she was a loose cannon. They failed. They tried to turn her into an evil representation of mutants. Showing the world that she was why people feared mutants.  They wanted people to see her as aggressive, angry, and unpredictable.
“Then they need help. I can get them out if they need it. I can bring them here right? I can bring whoever is left here and they can be safe.” Kielar said appearing in front of Bucky before he could blink.
“Grand Hope Park, I think.” Francis answered. “Do you need us to go with you?”
“We’re ordering chinese. You want anything?” He asked.

“Because they have requested a more neutral location. You all will not be the only ones attending.” Tony finally spoke up again, and now he had everyone's attention, except the sleeping Barton. ”They want to bring in some former students of Xavier’s…”
“Ah have t try really hard.” She started, “Ah’m an empath, it's why ah wasn’t in da meeting. Ah feed off of da emotions around me and raght now dere are a lot of strong ones. It's why ah stick around Izzy and Jimmy so much. Ah was briefly around Jade when we saved those from the trucks, and ah could feel da anger pourin’ off of her, so ah thought it best ah don’t stir dat pot no more din it needed to be. Ah was watchin and listenin’ though, she made a few people kinda twitchy. She’s always had dat effect though.”
Second to last chapter everyone! I hope you have enjoyed reading everything. This is the first in a series introducing the characters. This set was the Avengers and their kids, I have many more to write.
“Henri, this is Laura Kinney, I am a friend of your brother. We have help coming our way. When they get here I will send you another message so we can come pick you and your family up.” Laura ended the message. “Now we just wait.”
Secret Compound- Canada
“Ah’ll stay on look out.” Anna told them. “Ah can get to ya’ll faster if they show up.”
“Alright Mama.” He responded, not removing his hat from over his eyes as he spoke. “We got Char the medicine ya told us to give her. She went back to sleep so I think the pain is more manageable. Her stitches her holdin’ too. She was talkin’ for a few minutes.”
“Who is Rebel exactly?” Kielar questioned the older man.
Dakota Potts belongs to Adictedtobadguys
“Is my mom involved?”
“Remember what we spoke about your work habits and how they influence Tommy? He uses them against us all the time. It’s getting harder to argue with him.” Steve told him. “Now let’s go to bed. All of this will still be here in the morning and you know that both TJ and Kielar will be more than happy to help you.”
Bucky stood, unmoving for several moments before shaking his head. “I can see why he picked you.” he said simply. “Let’s make the food and I’ll find the shoes that were made for speedsters, I know they’re somewhere around here.”
“We can’t tell her until we get to the compound. She’s going to lose it and she’s already high strung. She needs to sleep and be away from people for a few hours. I can tell her myself. We can make sure Izzy is around too, he’s able to keep her calm. He’s going to keep looking for more evidence right?”
__________________________________________________________________
“Thank you Friday.” Tony said taking a deep breathe. “You knew about this and didn’t tell us Dakota?”
“So moving on from Tommy putting pot into cookies,” Dakota said. “Why can’t we just train here? You already have a facility and we are already here.”
He ordered a coffee. Nothing more though, knowing he only had limited cash on him and using the credit card was not a current option. The teen was a Stark though and powering through being tired was something that he had inherited. As he looked down at his phone, he wished he knew that it was a secure line. Calling someone at this point would be so much easier. So instead, he leaned back and watched videos as he sipped his drink, ordering a second, and then a third. Tommy had been thankful that even though the phone was cracked, it was the newest Stark phone, and the battery lasted.
“We wouldn’t send you there sweetheart, we have trained you in using your abilities “ Sue reassured her. “Though it would have done you some good to have other kids around you with abilities.”

“He needs to stop telling you those stories.” Steve said just as they heard a small explosion from the other room. The two took off toward the kitchen only to see Tony, Tommy, and Kielar hiding behind the counter while the microwave was smoking. “What happened?”
“She...she wasn’t alone. Dey...dey had Logan.” Daken moved closer. “He was executed. Dey had da Muramasa blade.”
They failed.
“We’re going to pay for that later.” Clint groaned.
“Us LeBeau’s don’ go down wit’out a fight” Luc said joining the hug. “An’ we sure as hell don’ let nobody hurt our family.”
Here is Chapter 3! I was having a bit of a difficult time ending the chapter which is what really took so long. but here it is! Please let me know what you think of it.
“We need to see if there are any others. We want to clear the mansion before we leave, and make sure nobody gets left behind.” Vivienne said. “Are you with us Renee?”
“I think the kids should learn how to cook” Steve continued, and all three boys looked at him in shock. “That’s an idea we can pass around. There will be so many of them there, no reason for us to order out or for us to do all the work, and if they refuse to, we’ll send Natasha in there.”
Chapter 10-
“KARLA!” Kielar suddenly sat up, causing all three of them to jump. Steve put a hand on the boy's shoulder. “Something happened, I can’t feel her. I can’t feel her. She’s usually in my head, she’s not. I can’t..” he looked at Steve, his eyes wide. “I don’t think my sister is alive.”
“My dad has a list. I could probably get files on all of them by the end of the night if you want to know anything.”James told her with a smile. “But sometimes it’s better to get to know people in person and not through sheets of paper.”
“We for or against this?” Francis asked her.
explained.
“Some of us have actual things to do..oh my god” Tommy mocked Dakota, then he was smacked upside the head. “Hey, that isn’t nice. There is a no hitting rule in this house.” he declared.
Before he knew it, the sun was coming up, and he had to get to his feet to continue on. Finishing the last cup of coffee, he threw down the money he owed before heading out of the diner. With the sun coming up, it was warming up just enough that he was more comfortable. November weather in California was always like that.
“Totally in..you in Mar?”
The training Steve had done with Kielar over the years was good for the kid. He could focus on slowing down, often wearing a power inhibitor so he didn’t accidentally use his speed abilities. When Steve retired, he offered the role as Captain America to Kielar, who took it and swore to hold the title with honor.
“We needed to speak first Bruce” Tony said from him to sit. “As you know, S.H.I.E.L.D has instructed that a new team be trained as a replacement for the Avengers. Most of us are no longer active and it has been shown that heroes are necessary. They bring a sort of hope to people.” Tony dropped a file onto the table labeled 'The Legacy Initiative'.
“Neither one of ‘em are actually related to a person in the Fantastic 4, that was another file we got.” She said and pulled out a small folder. “They’re twins. There birth Papa is Pietro Maximoff, there Mama is the Inhuman Crystal, they have an older sister named Luna,” Desiree revealed. “Not only that, but there is a possible other sibling. We can’t confirm that yet.”
“Any luck on Tommy?” Dakota asked quietly, her mind going a mile a minute from the previous news still.
Three days had passed quickly for the families, and on the last night they filled Stark Tower and all the rooms it had. There was a person at every turn, and it had been sometime since the tower had been this busy. Many of the kids hid themselves in the room they were given, it wasn’t that none of them wanted to actually be around each other, it was just that the ones who already did know one another tended to migrate toward each other. Small talk had happened at dinner, but as soon as it was over, they all scattered.
An hour passed, the soldier's had cleared out or been taken down, but there was silence throughout the school. As they reached the kitchen Vivienne froze midstep. “Someone is here. I feel their mind, but it’s too fast for me to read.” she said before a gush of wind hit the three of them. A boy their age stood on the other side of the room with windblown silver hair. He looked liked he had been woken up from a deep sleep, wearing just sweatpants and a muscle shirt. “Who are you.” she asked. He remained silent as he watched the three of them carefully. Renee’s hand slowly iced up, ready to fight if needed, and the Shadows behind Jett surrounded the stranger.
“Figure I’ll let them sweat a little longer, no need to get them riled up this early in the morning.” Tony yawned. Steve laughed and leaned over giving him a kiss. “You still think this whole thing is a good idea?”
“I’ll leave you two. Good luck Kie.”
“We can. I’ll call the others in. If you are bringing more people here, we’re going to need some help.” Bucky said with a small smile. “You know, Steve chose the right person. He knew exactly what he was doing when he picked you.” he paused. “Did you really eat all of those already though?”
“Where do you get your information?” Tommy asked.
Kielar and Tommy going out into the city as Captain America and Iron-Man had become a staple in their lives. As much as they had tried to keep Tommy out of the life they had chosen, Steve and Tony didn’t deny their son the chance to step into the role he wanted to be in, but made sure he was ready. Having Kielar out there, well trained and sure of himself, had added to the idea.
“No, I didn’t know.” Johnny said. “How did I not know that my son is gay?”
"Well, someone has to keep Francis in line. He never thinks before he acts” Mara said rolling her eyes. “I have also seen his bucket list, I will have to keep him safe on his endeavors.”
“I can go.” Blaine Banner piped up. “I don’t like them but they might be more inclined to help if I’m standing there, so it couldn’t hurt. But Devon has to stay here. No arguments. And it should just be us four so that we aren’t bombarding them with a huge group. I’m pretty good with words when I need to be, but Francis is a hot head and someone needs to be the voice of reason.”
“Papa?”
“Last night, they harmed our men and women only following orders! They hospitalized half of those who came into their home. They hid Kielar Storm, who is still somewhere out there! This mutant who at any time could take one of us out in the blink of an eye.” Tommy’s eyes narrowed as he listened to the guy go on about his friend. His fist clenched up. “The president has the right idea! It should have been done years ago.”
“I’m always ready to get back to your child, he’s a lot more pleasant to be around than you.” she snorted. “Everyone’s had water and we can get this trip over with. You need a shower” Heath smiled at him before turning around, her tail swishing back and forth as she headed to the jet.
So when they ventured out for the night, none were surprised when they ended up at the ice cream shop. Blaine hurried in first, a large smile on his face, having seen that Eliza was working through the window. She quickly came out from behind the counter and hugged Blaine, who kissed her cheek. Nicole and Ryan both glanced at Devon who just shrugged and went to their normal seat as his brother chatted with the girl.
“Yes, however, my source also showed files of others that were to be invited. They did not only focus on this group.”
“They began their raid about an hour ago, we don’t know the exact number but there are casualties.”
“Daken!?” she asked in shock. “You're..”
“I’ll move him into the bed “Steve told the other two before lifting Kielar up and laying him on Tommy’s bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Laura Kinney walked back toward the cabin with a stack of wood. They had arrived the day before and she had immediately handled any of the wounds on the kids, though most of them had healed. She worried for Kestrel though, not having the same healing ability her siblings had made her more susceptible to being injured. Luckily for them, there were three others who had healing abilities. Charmaine was in the roughest shape, Laura was glad they had found the truck before they could make it out of Kentucky, it had just been too late, they had removed Charmaine's wings. They knew that Jayson and Charmaines wings were connected to their healing abilities, while she was healing, it was slower than usual. So her daughter was in bed for the time being and it was driving Laura crazy, she hated any of her children being harmed, especially after having lost Joshua a few years earlier.
“Obviously she isn’t aware of your habits.”
“I already tried to once, I was locked in a closet and not let out until Mara came back” James shrugged. “Would rather not do that again.”
Chapter 1:
“What do you mean falling at my feet? Nobody liked me.” Blained asked, confused.
“I think the coach is well aware of Kielar leaving the team Sue, maybe not the cheerleaders. He made that decision at the beginning of the year though. He tried to play through but you know how he is, if he doesn't want to do it he won’t.” Reed told her.
As she made it closer to the cabin she saw her son in the hammock closest to their temporary home. She shook her head at the sight, knowing that he was dealing with everything he felt on his own, it was how she handled things, and avoiding family was the number one way to do that. Laura had briefly spoken to him in one of the stolen cars they had used to get across the midwest while his sister slept in the back. He blamed himself for a lot of the things that happened at the farm, the people he couldn’t save, and it broke her heart to hear her sixteen year old son tell her that he would have switched places with any of them if he could.
“These are the best ever. You can’t have ANY.” Blaine told his brother, snatching the bag back. “You should invite her back. If she makes cookies like this…”
“I’m going too, you might need more than close range attacks.”
“One more truck, assist Rebel. She's over exerting herself and we need her to stay with us.” his brother called to him. James looked around for the girl before catching sight of a glowing vehicle and Desiree moving back from it. James moved to her and touched her arm, she swirled around ready to fight.
One Hour later
“Okay, how do you know I can do this?”
The nightclub was loud, lights flashing as the music blared through the speakers. People were on the dance floor moving and having a good time. Amongst the crowd was James Rogers, the son of Captain America and Black Widow, also the only sober one amongst his team. It had been their night off, so for him it wasn’t an issue, it wasn’t like he could get drunk, anyway. He watched his partners out on the dance floor, one of them amused by the other's antics. Azari Evan glanced over at James shaking his head, but had a smile on his face, before the young Wakandan prince turned back to Francis Barton, who was clearly not ashamed of letting loose for the night.
“They were the ones who would visit me. They brought me books and when I was too out of it to read on my own Nikki would read to me, or Ryan would tell me stories. They were the ones who talked them into letting me out.”
The other teenagers in the room had peaked his interest. They had a curious way about them and it drew Azari toward them. He loved to watch people, it was a good way of learning about them. He had seen the walls some of them had built up, he had noticed the anxiety that some held, and how relaxed some were. It was an interesting mix and when he looked at them he saw only individuals, not so much a team. He could tell all the siblings would be difficult to work with, they were all very protective of each other in one way or another, some were even very subtle about it.
“No, I  just grabbed him and lowered him, I  pinned him down to keep him from moving anymore, he came in through the wall, something spooked him.” Tommy told them. “He hasn’t lost control like that in years.”
“I didn’t know you were so worried about me.”
“We gotta get ya’ll outa here.” Lapin told all of them, bursting through the doors. “Dey have Tony Stark and Steve Rogers in custody, Dey ain’t gonna wait to come after ya’ll, its public knowledge dat us LeBeau’s fought against dis law.”
They tried to silence her.
“How did you guys get here anyways? How did you get the LeBeau’s here?” Kielar asked.
“You're mutants.” the boy stated. “Maybe you can tell me what the fuck is going on.”
“I like them. I’m sorry I can’t be all ripped jeans and leather. You are a walking stereotype Devon.”
There was no such thing as an early night for most New Yorkers. This included the occupants living in the Baxter Building. Long after the sun had gone down, Reed Richards remained in his lab. The living quarters were just a few stories below him where his wife, brother-in-law and niece were. They had agreed to a late dinner, Friday nights were football nights for Karla, so she came home after nine p.m. Kielar had gone to the Starks for the weekend after an argument with Johnny, something that had been escalating for some time. Reed had noted how much time the boy had spent with the other family, but remained silent, hoping that Johnny would attempt to fix things with him. Looking around, he quickly realized he was running late, and Sue would never let him hear the end of that.
“That bitch knew, you know she knew because she tries to know everything!” Jade exclaimed.
“Actually,” Vivienne started. “Ms. Pryde gave Jett a communicator. “ As the words left her mouth Jett appeared next to them before he ran to the nearest trash can. “Still gets motion sickness I see.”
“That joke just confirmed what I have been thinking for awhile, too much time with Tommy.” Dakota laughed. “Which means you need to spend more time with me to earn your credits back.” Tommy rolled his eyes.
“Aren’t you that Stark kid? The clone boy?” someone asked.
“When dey attacked meh, oui, dat was a pretty crazy tahme.” She said leaning back. “Da south ain’t a very good place to be sometimes. Ah got kinda a love hate relationship with it.”
“Ah’ll get da passage ready. We can get out of da city dat way” Lapin told them.
“Do not be so smug young sir, the device has been there almost a year and I do not believe you have gathered any evidence against your brother.”
Chapter Three-
“Actually, both dad and pops were. I’m done here, all of you are pathetic.” he turned to walk away again, only to be grabbed by another person. “You have about two seconds to let go of me, and that will be the only warning you get.” True to his word, Tommy used his other arm and punched the person in the face. As soon as he was freed, he ran.
“Regrettably.” Tony mumbled.
“Yes they are, bow ties are very cool.”
He was a proud man, Jean Luc, and everyone knew it. When his grandson was born, and he was named after him, he cried, just a little. He was so proud of how far his son had come in life. When the second child came, Desiree, he knew that she was going to be the one to test them, from the moment she learned the word “No” and that her father would do anything for her.
“Well, it's not you Aunt Nat, no offense but we’re really hoping that you and Dad will finally get together.” Francis said and Mara let out a loud sigh. “What?” he asked sitting next to the open spot next to James. “C’mon Snow, there’s room for you.” he paused and turned to James. “Francis Barton, nice to officially meet you.”
There were very few lights left on in the tower when it struck midnight. Steve had been in bed reading until he realized the time and went to get his husband from the lab. As he walked down the stairs, he heard the music playing as Tony worked.  Steve walked in and cut the music off, immediately catching the other man’s attention. “It’s midnight, you aren’t staying in here all night Tony.” Steve said.
“My sister had her wings removed, she’s recoverin’ but very slowly.” Aislin told him. “The triplets are inside, I’ll let ‘em know ya’ll are here.” She said, “Akhiro? Thank ya for coming to get us.”
_________________________________
“We are getting off track. I have a facility in California. We can test this theory they have out. If it works, then it works. If not we’ll go back home.” Tony offered to all of them.
“I’m not. I don’t dislike the idea, but its another place to be. As long as my family is there I will be fine. There will just be a lot of people I do not know as well, and not knowing them is unnerving.” She admitted.
“Really, Flit?’” Mara asked.
“Tony. It’s Reed. Is Kielar okay?”
“Yes Princess, I’ll bring it to you.” Johnny replied.
“You don’t even know where they are.”
“How bad is it? Was anyone taken?” he asked as they ran down the next hall.
“Karla.” Kielar repeated. “Tommy, something's wrong. Something happened.”
“James, I need to speak to you.” Daken said and moved toward the jet.His younger brother kissed the top of Desiree’s head and stood up following the older man. Daken had his back turned toward the girl as he spoke again. “Bucky said that they just got reports that the LeBeau place is gone.”
“Going back to the states uncoordinated isn’t going to be a solution. We can’t make any of ya work together. You need to do that.” Ben added.
True to his word, they were loading a short time later, and as they were exiting, Reed pulled Johnny aside. It wasn’t a second later before Reed had his arms around Johnny as the man broke down. Daken stopped in his tracks and looked over at them, frozen in place. “What happened?” Bucky asked him.
“Des.” James said, trying to get her attention. She looked at him, tears pouring down her face. The room was silent, shock taking over the all.
“Ah ain’t gone Rogue in a long tahme, and as nahce as dat has been Remy...ah have to also protect meh family, ya’ll are what ah live for.” She smiled as she turned to her son. “Luc, y’ take care of all them until ah get back.” She put her hand on his cheek. “And ah will be back with ya’ll...so go...Jean Luc, Henri, don’t let meh boys do nothin’ stupid.”
Jade stepped forward with her arms crossed. “First thing I want to know is why nobody knew about this place except the speedster.”
Dakota Potts- 17
“We need a new microwave, I’ve already ordered one.” Tony assured them.
“Desi…” Jade started before she was nudged forward.
“I would be dead too!” Azari yelled. “I would have been with my mother and considering they shot down her plane, I would have been dead.” he felt Francis take his hand, and James put his hand on his shoulder. “My mother was dedicated to the X-men. She fought for them most of her life and for you to accuse me of not caring? That is a terrible thing to say. I had the chance to return home, to make sure that my team was safe, they were the directions my mother left me, it is what my father wanted me to do. But I am here, I am here because what happened was not right. It was wrong and we need to fight for our freedom again. We are here so that you do not have to fight alone, but if you keep this up, you will end up that way.”
So, after orders from both his parents, he left. There had been a plan, one that he and Kielar had come up with despite Steve and Tony telling them to not switch anything up. Not having any special abilities, Tommy knew he was in less danger than his best friend, but with him being in the public eye, and knowing his parents wouldn’t turn Kielar in, he knew he would still be targeted.
They watched as Azari spoke animatedly with T’challa, trying not to show his panicked state. “Yes sir.” He said before hanging up and turning to the others. “He’s going to send others for us, we need to find a location and send it to him. Somewhere discrete.”
“What did I miss, where is James?” Azari asked, walking out of the bathroom in a towel. “What did you do tweety?”
Azari T'Challa- 18
“You need to rest.” Bucky tried.
“Then we will have to get her back.” Johnny hissed as he looked at Sue, rage filled him. “They messed with the wrong family.”
“It is, she’s using Gambits abilities.” Bucky informed her. “That means she is the reason the estate exploded. We have the solders going in, being dragged out by Rogue, and then the cameras going out, but nobody else?”
“What hurts?” Tommy asked him quietly.
“Papa I already told y’, we ain’t goin wit’out everyone.” Remy told him.
“My mother, in New York, but she rarely sends me anything this late.” he said as he pressed the button to play the message.
“We have to regroup.” Kielar said, remaining calm. “After we regroup we can plan. We will work better with one.”
“They turn black when they are on. Your Uncle James helped fund a place in Canada with the help of Stark industries, we’ll be safe there. Your sister can get the help she needs and we…”
“Yeah, me neither” Kielar said  and everyone looked at him, making him turn red. “Sorry, bad joke.”
“I’m going with you as backup.” Bucky said. “Besides with those kids leaving for S.H.I.E.L.D you can’t take the larger jet in case of an emergency. “I have the smaller Quinjet, we can take that. It can hold seven or eight people.”
“You can’t blame that on them.” Azari said. “What happened at Xavier’s is a tragedy that should have never occurred. You have every right to be upset, but you have no right to be upset with those here trying to help. We are just as devastated as you are, but we also understand that what we experienced is not the same as what you did that night. We were lucky.”
“You can’t do that to yourself Desiree. We did what we could, if we had done more there would have been even more death and destruction. Daken is on the phone with Bucky now getting an update, the last one he said that some staff and students from Xavier's arrived, and that Kielar Storm was there. A lot of people got out. You can’t beat yourself up that we didn’t get everyone. We can do another rescue mission when we aren’t going twenty four hours without sleep.”
He also hated packing.
Steve took a deep breathe. “Yes. It was really hard and it really opened our eyes a bit. They had suggested that Tony just created TJ out of boredom and experimentation, just to see if he could. It wasn’t the case, at all. Tony was ready to just take Tommy and leave the country, but I convinced him to stay and fight, to prove that we wanted a child together, that had our DNA, and we won.” Steve said. “Tony spent two years researching and getting everything right. He didn’t even attempt until he knew for sure it would work, and we weren’t going to try the cloning process more than once, if it hadn’t worked the first time, we were going to adopt.”
Tony sat in his living room with Tommy, Kielar, James, Dakota and Mara. While most of them had left, these five lived under his roof, more or less. Steve and Natasha walked in and sat next to Tony as the kids waited for the discussion they knew was coming. Kielar slouched down into the couch and leaned his head back, closing his eyes during the wait. Tommy had taken his hand and rubbed the back of it with his thumb.
“It’s fine really, you didn’t miss much if I’m being honest. It went as you would expect it to. We also sat down after and spoke about a few things, Kielar, me, Tommy, James and Mara. Steve, Tony and Natasha wanted to make sure we knew what was happening and that they would support us with whatever decision we made.” Dakota told her as she braided her hair. “So I will be out there in three days with the others, if that wasn’t clear.”
“Have you ever heard of him?” Renee asked. “Because he seems really familiar, but I can’t quite pin why.”
“Freeze!” a voice commanded from across the room.Steve quickly moved to block the boys behind him as they remained still. “We have orders to take in the mutant Kielar Storm.” Tommy looked at Kielar, who was shaking next to him. He took his friends hand and gave him a slight nod as he slipped a device into his hand.
“But they can only do so much.” Bucky said.
Kielar and Karla Storm(Or Maximoff) were a perfect example of this. Kielar showed signs of having more common Inhuman attributes than his twin. He could lift more, his skin was harder to pierce. His speed abilities already gave him a quicker reaction time, speed and endurance greater than other humans. His sister had shown similar signs, but not at the height of her brothers. One thing that had surprised all of them though, was the twins psychic link to each other. They had learned that they could not only speak to each other but also feel the other's emotions and physical pain.
“Okay.” A very soft reply came from the little boy.
But in a split second, Steve saw Tony’s grin vanish.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve couldn’t sleep well. He kept tossing and turning on the spare bed. As if that was not enough, at 1am, the 3 babies woke each other up by crying. A zombie-like Kayla came down to prepare milk for them. Steve decided to help her. Tony woke up to the sound of the floorboard creaking. He joined Steve after a few minutes of disorientation.
“He did tell me about what your dad said and did, and about Peggy,” Steve said.
“I know,” Steve muttered. He went to the side of the bed.
“Tony!” Steve was grinning, running towards him holding two cones of ice cream.
Steve felt his knees go weak. Thor held him, stopping him from crashing onto the ground. Natasha tried to locate Tony’s GPS. She let out a sigh and waited. Bruce and Clint were just standing there. They already knew the fun was over even though it was just 4pm. Bruce looked at the polaroid photo he was holding. The six of them had taken it just now, right after lunch. They all were making crazy faces in it. It was taken in a booth, one of the stalls,  and all of them have one copy to keep as a memory.
“What the hell?” Tony frowned.
It was 11pm. The kids were fast asleep. Sam had taken the master bedroom while Linda slept with the kids. Kayla and Steve were seated on the couch below. Both were drinking hot chocolate under the dimmed hall lights.
Both of them ran across the Rainbow Bridge. “Heimdall, Bifrost!” Thor shouted. “Be safe. And unite the Avengers.
“Mrs. Stark is doing just fine. She can’t wait to meet you and your friends.”
After 10 minutes, Tony placed her onto her cot, following Steve’s orders. Natasha slept well.

“And that time when Natasha drove the convertible to the strawberry stall?” Clint asked, his eyes wide.
“Don’t push and shove!” Tony shouted at the top of his lungs. He could feel himself wanting to black out, but not now. Not when all these people’s lives were in danger.
“We are ready to go boys.” Natasha walked in with Clint, Wanda and Bucky.
“Hey, hey,” Steve said softly, smiling. “I’m not angry at you, Tony. We needed you to stop. That’s why I had to raise my voice. Come here.” He ruffled Tony’s hair.
In fact, she was trying when the Frost Giant raised his hand to give that little boy a slap.
“What do we do now?” Steve asked.
“What is he talking about?” Doctor Strange asked. He created a shield for Reed and proceeded to push another Frost Giant back.
“What?” the others asked in unison.
“Boy, are you okay?” the strawberry seller waved at him with a grin. “Buy a box, strawberries can help.”
The remaining Avengers, who haven't de-aged yet, try to bury the stone. Plus it's Tony's birthday and they celebrate it. And Steve's face-to-face apology to Tony, like finally.
“No,” Tony drawled with a smile. “I’ll get something from one of the eateries right here. You don’t have to worry, Pep, I got it all covered here.”
“We fought,” Clint cleared his throat. He was so bad at this. “And it's been a week plus since we spoke.”
“Little annoying brat!” the other man shouted. He took out a gun and tried to fire at Tony, who was running towards him. Tony had to take the stairs, to tell the Avengers about men dressed in ugly yellow suits.
“Guys,” Tony started to laugh. “Ana can prepare more. We don’t need this little brawl.”
Thor immediately figured out something was wrong. He rummaged through his study table and found his Avengers ID card. He activated the Assemble button, and that was how every single Avenger, except Tony, found themselves communicating from their rooms to Thor, using their cards.
The words made Tommy freeze for a moment. He looked down at the time on his phone, reading the time as 10 a.m. Letting out a groan, in realizing how early it still was, and that this guy would not shut up, he moved across the street to get a better look. The crowd was definitely larger than he expected it to be, but still wasn’t very impressive. He stayed in the back, leaning against a tree as the man spewed more out.
“You are the one who gave them access to the lab, Tony,” Steve laughed. “It’s not my fault they challenge your intelligence.”
The expectations.
“James?” Steve asked standing in the doorway.
“Dammit Kielar! Do not sneak up on me like that!” She yelled at him. “Why the hell would I check Germany?”
“Well, yes.” Dakota said. “And, if you followed closely then you would know what their next target was. They’re making some sort of announcement from…”
“That’s the thing though, we aren’t them.” Dakota says. “And we shouldn’t have to me, it’s why I decided to go, because they let us have that choice. I could have said no, but the thought of being left behind, I don’t like it. Besides, I wasn’t lying when I said Tommy can’t stay out of trouble. If we end up going public as a team, someone has to be there to help clean up his messes.”
“I will be fine, thank you for checking on me.”
“Mom,” Jett started and looked at her. “Take Cass, I will stay with Vivienne and make sure we get everyone. We’ll get out.”
Before he could stop another group of soldiers moved into view. The childish girl on his back dropped to the ground by staying behind him, holding onto the back of her shirt. “Jett, what are we going to do.” she asked.
---------
“That’s enough.” This time James Rogers spoke up and the red head moved next to Azaris other side. “You need to stop using the fact that he's a prince against him.”
“Cool.” Francis said with a grin on his face.

Tommy, Kielar and James remained where they were watching the LeBeau reunion. “You see where she get’s it from now don’t you?” a voice said from behind. The three spun around to see Steve and Tony standing there. “We were going to wait, but had the opportunity to leave and took it.” Steve explained. “I hear you three had quite the adventures.”
Clint threw his arm around his son’s shoulders and nodded a bit as they walked toward the car. “You know, you aren’t bad at all. Though, you really need to work on your Vlog name”
“Are we really back on that?” James asked her. “Because I don’t know if you saw or heard right, maybe even imagining things.”
“You know it won’t be all fun and games right? We will be there to train and work with the others.” Clint told him.
“Isn’t it obvious, Azari gave it to them, he’s the only one who would have any access.” Jade told them. “You think just because you are a Prince..”
“We are here to collect Kielar and Karla Storm and take her into custody by order of the president.” One man stated.
“Because ya a leader. Meh friends told me about some of the stuff ya said in the meeting dat was held. Ah get da feeling people would follow ya.”
“We are keeping that information under wraps as of right now,” Bucky began, “Until we have more solid information nothing is to be said of the LeBeau’s and what happened, is that clear.” He told them, leaving no room for argument. “Vivienne, show the to their rooms, lunch is in an hour.”
“His names Kielar, that must be..”
“It was a mission, I didn’t think you would want me to just drop what I was doing and take a nap” Francis looked at everyone. “So what is exactly happening..”
Hope you enjoyed! let me know what you think!
When Tommy finally reached the busier part of the city, he was more relieved. Now it was just a matter of getting to his destination. The trek had been long, very long. This achievement was something for him to brag about too, because he was far from being athletic, not like his brother. He would rather drive, or use his suit, then walk as much as he had. Now he was just a few more miles from where the tracker said James was, he could do this.
“So..um..sorry not meaning to be rude or anything but, why are you here? Talking to me?” Kielar asked her, confusion written on his face.
“Then do it while we move, because if we don’t go now it may be too late.”
“I mean its speculated, they are always together. You didn’t know?” She asked him. “It’s the big gossip at school right now since the picture circulated. Kielar hasn’t really spoken to me much since then.” Karla admitted.

“I had a feeling they would target your team and I wanted to be here in case that happened okay? They already took Dad and Pops, and Kielar had to run, I just...I ...I needed to make sure you were okay.” Tommy mumbled the last part, and James let out a small sigh, his shoulders relaxing. ‘That thing in the park wasn’t planned okay? I just, they started saying shit about Kielar and I am not okay with that. It, it’s just been a long night.”
“Thanks Mar”
“A few years ago I gave Laura  these stud earrings and she wears them all the time. There are trackers in them with the understanding that I wouldn’t constantly check in on her. They would only be used for emergencies, and this is an emergency, besides I am almost positive I know where they would go.” Daken told them both. “So both of you stop.”
“Sir, there has been a security breach.” Jarvis spoke.
Jett held out his fist to his friend. “So. We will take them down Viv?”
Tommy stopped, rolling his eyes as he turned around. “What gave me away, dickwad?”
They tried.
“Alright Sarah, what are you specifically looking for tonight?” She asked as she brought up a hologram from her watch showing her all of the intruders activities.
One two more chapters after this! Hope ya'll are enjoying this!
“We can’t just..” Nicole started.
“When Desiree went out there with that team sugah, the one thing she asked was that we stay safe so that she could worry less about us. She’s a big girl, and she’s always been a fighter, she’s got a good team with her too.” Anna said, reassuring her son and nephew. She glanced over at her husband who had been quiet. “Remy?”
Kitty hesitated for a moment before pulling out her communicator and placing it in her son's hand. “As soon as you are safe, you are to contact me. If I haven't heard from you in two days. I will come find you. As soon as you are out, get as far from large cities as you can. Do you understand me, Jett?”
“For Pietro right?” Kielar asked.
“Don’t you have a warrant out for your arrest?” another asked. “they arrested your father last night for harboring and protecting a mutant.”
“Why don’t we all call it a night, we have to be at the airport early tomorrow.” Tony suggested to the group. Tommy glared at him. “What TJ?”
Francis Barton propped his feet up on the dashboard as his father drove them toward the archery range. It had been the custom for them to go there since he was a kid when something serious needed to be said. It had been some time since they had gone there and the eighteen year old knew that they would be having that kind of conversation tonight. Luckily this didn’t exactly have to go back to his mother. He dreaded even thinking about that. The silence in the car was a comfortable one. The two never had to really say much when they were together. Their bond as father and son was a strong one, that had gone through many trials in the past, literal trials.
Out of the shadows a boy appeared with a youthful girl and he looked around in a panic as soldiers came toward him from both sides. He knelt down quickly and the young girl climbed on his back before he ran to the right and dropped into the shadows of the soldiers and reappeared near a window where there was another of a tree. The shadow jumper smirked to himself before turning and running down another hallway.
“Alright. Also, I go by Akihiro off the field, Daken is my codename only.” he explained.  Johnny nodded and continued to follow the two. “I still think you should stay here with your kids.”
As he turned each page, he recognized several of the photos he passed. “They picked very talented students, unique choices as well.” he commented. “Were you aware that James’ older brother was offered a position as a trainer?”
“Well, they picked a great person. Not everyone would have done what you did tonight, they would have just gone to safety and not worried about others.” Renee told him. “We would have never known to come here.”
Especially not Bucky at the moment.
“I don’t understand what possessed you two to have a midnight snack on the top of the White House Francis, that could have ended horribly.” Clint scolded a bit. The boy looked at him with a grin. “I’ve watched every episode, I know you scaled the Empire State Building, I saw the photos of the two of you sitting on the outside of the torch on the Statue of Liberty, and I picked you up from jail when you tried to get to the Pentagon.”
“Well, you boys are older now. I retired to help raise you. Going on on all those missions and missing everything, I couldn’t do it anymore.”
“You weren’t the only one who he wasn’t there for. I had every right to stay away from him! He didn’t protect my mom! So yes I was angry for a very long time, because he should have been there, he should have protected her but he didn’t! I should have been with him but I refused to go and now look what happened!” James shoved Daken. “I didn’t go with him and now he is dead.”
“I hope you aren’t talking about about your vlog you do by going places that could get you arrested.” Natasha spoke up for the first time since entering the room.
Reed sat at the table, letting the siblings argue. Looking up, he saw Karla walking out of the room and smiled. “Karla, how was the game?”
“Good,” Ookami said. “Team Alpha is moving in, we are going silent. Keep the comms free. Report to Hades until Alpha is back online.”
“If you finish that sentence Barton you will pay for it later.”
“Let's fight.” Kielar responded by bumping his fist against it.
The message ended, and the four stood there in shock. “That sounded like an attack on the Xavier school.” Francis said, taking water from James and drinking it. “Dad is on a mission, but I can call mom and see what she knows.” For Francis Barton to offer calling his mother, Bobbi Morse, was a big deal. The two of them were not on the greatest terms after the divorce that took place during his early teen years. If Clint Barton had been an option, he would have taken that. “We will figure out what happened Kitten, we can get you and Mara safe.”
“It’s his real name, what Daken translates to, it ain’t nothin’ but garbage and nobody should be called that.” Desiree told him.
