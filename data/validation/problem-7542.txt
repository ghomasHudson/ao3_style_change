“I can go,” Steve offers, knowing an out when he sees one and pulling himself together. He reaches out a hand, ready to snag his phone, the pad of his finger hovering just above the end icon. “I’ve gotten enough to work with.”
“Do you think - ”
“Worst comes to worst, I’ll drive you back to Brooklyn,” Tony says unconcernedly, hands slashing through the air.
So he nestles in, head tucked right under Steve’s chin, and happily resigns himself to basking in the afterglow.
A little slip of the tongue, Steve can handle no problem. Tony can run his along Steve’s bottom lip and press inside and Steve just lets him, keeps his hands nice and gentle. The moment he snags Steve with his teeth though, just a razor-thin drag, Steve goes taut. Tony is close enough to hear how Steve’s entire body freezes, can practically see the infinitesimal tightening of fingertips on the back of his neck, and greedily digs in deeper.
That’s an easy one. “Didn’t want to hear that I was wrong.” He pauses, and it’s almost liberating to have the truth out there. It boosts him up, the two of them level on a platform high above everyone else, and he knows that even when he leaves for lower ground, he won’t have ceded anything for the first time in a long time. “Didn’t want to hear that you regretted it.”
“Denise thinks she can do this on her own,” Josie says with a raised eyebrow as she steals a couple of Beth’s Cheetos, ignoring the whiny protest for her trouble. “We had a good thing going. A schedule, a rhythm worked out. Then you guys did whatever you did.”
“Easy to say that now. That’s what he said to me when I went to see him, you know. I told him that I wouldn’t have gotten mad at you for not telling me about my parents, and he told me I could only say that because you already had.”
Steve frowns.
Steve accepts the flute readily. He doesn’t take a sip, even as Tony does; it’s in his best interest to stay stone-cold sober tonight, considering what had happened - or didn’t happen - the last time he got drunk in his presence. The risk of appearing rude is worth it, in this case.
“It’s been keeping me busy,” Pepper says with the kind of good-natured grimace most people reserve for acquaintances and coworkers. “And you know how Tony is. Even without him at the helm, he still manages to find ways to order me around.”
Steve parses through everything that is to come, knowing that there is so much he could choose to divulge. It might be best to do so while Tony is like this, while there’s a chance he might not press Steve, while he might not even remember it. There’s no guarantee though, and he can’t risk it.
“We don’t have to go,” Steve says, and his eyes are so blue, even in the dim lighting. “I want to try. Just...be patient with me. And next time, maybe let me choose where we go.”
It’s not difficult, Steve thinks, concentrating on lifting the inky-black of night. He delivers the most spectacular sunrise above the lake, painstakingly coloring patches of clouds and ensuring the light shoots between the branches of the trees on the other side of the water. There are so many shades he’s never gotten the chance to experiment with that he takes his time with, and he eases them into an artificial daytime.
“Well, now that nothing can live up to the big surprise of ‘I’m trying to build you a new shield….’”
“You need me to send you one?”
“I did tell you I was going to show you a good time, didn’t I?” Tony says expectantly, tapping at an ashtray that has seemingly materialized out of nowhere.
Life had been a whirlwind for a while, and that was all without factoring in the emotional rollercoaster he’d been set on upon news of Tony’s rescue. Tony, who’s now got some fancy suit of armor further separating him from the mere mortals of the world, and any delusions Steve may have once held about the single night spent in each other’s company has long since mellowed into a kind of warped respect for the man who upended his life and nearly ruined his company all in the name of doing the right thing.
“I’m here,” Josie says, and she’s got her eyebrows raised so Steve raises his right back. Serena’s grip loosens so he lets her go, and she heads back to the family room. “We expecting any other visitors?”
me, and said some bullshit about not wanting anyone else to ever wear it.”
“Tony is worried you won’t make it back here,” Rogers says, leaning forward to balance his elbows on his knees as he looks above them, at the sky that’s threatening to open up at any moment. “He doesn’t want to tell you, but he’s not sure what kind of strain that travel will inflict on your body.”
“I was actually going to offer to share with the tree,” Tony says, and she rolls her eyes before departing with one of her tiny secret smiles.
Chickening out is better than yelling.
“I love you, too,” he says truthfully.
, Steve thinks incredulously.
“I’d like that very much,” Steve says seriously, with so much direct eye contact that Tony is immobilized by it. “If you’re okay with it.”
Steve is bothered, but mostly, he’s just done. He doesn’t have the energy left to be upset, not when up close, Tony is just a person who isn’t capable of giving Steve much of anything at all. Without asking, Steve can vouch for the great personal strides in personal development Tony’s made over the years while still knowing that it’s not enough to want to stick around and deal with. He deserves more than that, and for once, he’s going to walk away knowing that he’ll be okay if they never see each other again.
He could stay in New York. Help with the relief efforts. There are so many people that need to be reintegrated into society: jobs have since been filled, entire buildings condemned, and he could be good at that. Steve has always been good at directing others, at coming up with a plan and pulling it off. The task is daunting, and it would fill something inside of him. It would give him a purpose, after feeling so helpless and defeated.
- yeah, Steve doesn’t know if he can do that. He’s always been a silent coward when it comes to Tony.
It’s darkly deprecating, a grim shouldering of responsibility that’s more revelatory than anything else he’s said.
Rogers doesn’t speak, just holds the bundle of flowers in his hands.
“Why’d you ask me to do the interview?”
“Shut up and show me how to do this,” Steve tells him.
Steve chokes out a laugh that rubs up roughly against his sandpaper-lined throat and feels his palms prickle with sweat. “Jesus, tell me I didn’t.”
“Pull over,” he says, and the car is too small for the both of them.
A few days later, there’s a donation. It’s obscenely large, credited to a Howard Potts, and Steve itches with questions. He wants to know why, and how, but there isn’t a number to dial and he just curls up with Serena in his lap and holds on a little too tight as she lets herself be rocked back to sleep.
Steve is a master of redirection though, and he keeps things slower than syrup and twice as cloying until Tony’s cock is commanding more attention than can be spared.
“Oh,” Tony says, face doing something like he doesn’t know what to do. “That’s - this isn’t Coachella, Cap.”
Josie throws the calculator across the room.
“Yeah.” Tony shrugs and lets go. Steve wishes he hadn’t touched him to begin with. “Come on, they don’t bite.”
And yet, in this particular instance, they do.
Tony flips on the soundtrack, and Steve is beginning to recognize the melodies. When they’re almost to the house, he props his own elbow on the console and aligns his arm with Tony’s, the backs of their hands loosely pressed together.
“I’m surprised you accepted.”
“Let the kid take care of himself,” Steve says.
Steve pulls a face. “Girls, don’t repeat that, okay? I’m sorry. Christina, keep still, otherwise it won’t stick right.”
“Thanks for the wine,” Steve says, and then he’s kissing Pepper’s cheek, and it feels awkward as Tony follows Morgan out the door. “And thank you.”
It’s like looking into a funhouse mirror. Everything is wrong and distorted and all the more horrifying for how familiar and real it is. His reflection is hard and angry, carved from stone, and Steve knew this would happen.
“Absolutely not,” he says, gradually raising himself up so he can look into Steve’s earnest eyes. “That is absolutely
He grabs it as the two girls debate Ariel and Mulan, and thinks that it’s probably Josie, who’s out with the younger boys. She’d whisked them away after school to do some shopping, since they’re all out of laundry detergent and Ben and Jackson had needed to release some pent-up energy in the aisles of their local Target.
But then the seamless glass melts out of existence and Tony appears, smiling so big and genuine that his eyes nearly disappear.
“No.” Steve shakes his head. “It’s not.”
And Tony backtracks until he’s standing next to Steve, looking like he’s been caught in the act.
Steve smiles at him fondly, and Tony wants to know where the hell his Steve went, because this man in front of him, lifting a hand to skim over his jaw and skate cool fingertips up and along the edge there, sliding back to tuck imaginary strands of hair behind his ear -
Tony doesn't know; he just signs the checks and shows up in a tux.
he simultaneously feels things he hasn’t felt in years and things he’ll swear he’s never felt before, but yeah,
Never before has he considered himself a coward, but the problem is, if he’d asked, he’s fairly certain he knows what Tony would’ve said. Tony would’ve given him the truth, and that would’ve meant no more living in the dark about what it really means to be in love with a billionaire he’s now met a grand total of three and a half times.
“You’re not on a plane yet?”
“I’m sending you a cell phone,” Tony’s voice comes, and Steve can hear noise in the background.
But Steve’s expression doesn’t falter, even as he gives in and lets Tony grab something that promises to nourish and renew the skin. It goes like that up and down the aisles, including the clothes section where Steve spends an inordinate amount of time comparing packs of underwear.
Tony appropriates Steve’s mug with a tilted expression, careful not to let their fingers make contact as he does. “Quid pro quo? What, you want to touch my face?”
“Okay, no,” he says, gently but firmly shifting her as far away as he can manage with his body suddenly too small for his compressed lungs.
“Okay,” Steve says.
“I’m not that easy,” Steve says, clinging to the vestiges of his sanity and almost weary with how Tony makes unraveling him feel like child’s play. If he didn’t know that Tony’s always had a reputation for being delightfully manipulative, he’d be offended and seriously wounded on his own behalf.
“So you think it’s on you to save the world?” Steve questions. “Some people might respect the large amount of accountability you’ve assigned yourself since the kidnapping.”
He’s got his legs around Steve’s waist, a desperate grip on his shoulders, and Steve is barely even holding him there. There’s the barest sensation of pressure under his left thigh, Steve’s other hand braced against the door, and Tony’s
Steve is out of easy words, but he’s also done being a selfish coward.
“I love you,” he tells Tony, and if he were still mortal his heart would be racing.
“Compared to everyone else - ”
And he can see the faint wisps of red slipping out from her palms, and really, he shouldn’t be surprised.
“D’you really think that’d be a good idea?” Steve asks, and now he’s tripping over consonants and blanking on vowels like he’s never spoken English before. “Considering what happened last time?”
“Because it doesn’t work as well as I thought it did,” Steve says. “Turns out, when you leave something up to someone else, neither of you end up getting what you really wanted.”
Steve is hissing, and before he knows it Tony is being bodily hauled to his feet, coffee and all.
“You seem very cavalier about all of this,” Fury notes. “Something big is going to happen, I assume, otherwise I wouldn’t be allowed here in your house. And yet you don’t seem to care."
They haven’t just chatted in years. Steve tugs on his hair, and begins cleaning up the wrappers strewn across the counter.
(Because he’s not about to forget where he’s coming from that quickly.)
Steve rescues her from whatever tangled web her imagination has been weaving all day.
“I want the good creamer,” Steve tells him as he gets comfortable. “Not the weird natural kind. I don’t care if it’s loaded up with chemicals, none of the low-fat sugar-free - ”
“You can come,” Tony insists. “I know you like your garden, Rogers told me. We can put in a greenhouse. Get Peggy set up with whatever she needs, the finest care available, world-class.”
“He needed to hear that,” Tony says after several moments, hand withdrawing and shifting into his previous position. He clears his throat. “What happened after that?”
“This is Steve Rogers,” Tony says, gesturing cheerfully. “Esteemed journalist, talented Craps player, and happens to look particularly ravishing underneath all that unfortunately poorly-tailored clothing, if I’m remembering correctly.”
Steve feels something inside him grow light, feels it lessen, and nothing has ever felt like such sweet success.
Tony lets out a snort. “How much have you had to drink?”
Eventually, they peel themselves off the twisted, sweaty sheets. Tony makes a comment about having to upgrade his shower to super-soldier standards, but Steve just grips his backside tight and kisses him against the glass partition while the water heats. His eyes are bright as Steve nudges them under the pressured spray, delivering wet kisses behind his ear, along his forehead, down the back of his neck until hands wander and they’re both sprouting goosebumps even as steams gathers around them, slipping in the infinitesimal space between them.
Serena clings to Tony once the movie ends, and Steve tries not to be jealous. Tony lifts her up and Steve can see the strain it requires of him, until she’s leaning against his chest and petting his face.
“Think you proved that with the article,” Tony says, before twisting to the side with a, “Happy, give me a minute, can’t a billionaire get a minute around here? Who cares about a fine, I’ll just pay it, you - ”
“I know that you’ve got a box in the closet you won’t talk about,” Sam says calmly, and no, Steve won’t let himself go down that road, so he opens his mouth and weighs all other options.
Tony enters the coordinates and helps him up the stairs while Rogers lingers, fingers white-tight around the rim of the shield. It’s as easy as can be, which perhaps isn’t saying much, but Tony jokes and Steve is leaving this world intact, which is really all he’d ever meant to do.
It’s unfortunately true, he knows from experience that she’s like a dog with a bone when she wants to be, so he gives in to the massive sigh and reaches for the box precariously teetering on the edge of his desk. It’s not particularly heavy by his standards, and he fumbles with the bow for a few moments before managing to locate the ends and untie it properly.
Tony peers into him, giving Steve that odd sensation of peeling off a scab to reveal shiny, barely healed skin underneath. “I’m an engineer. I’ve kind of made a career out of getting things to work the way I want them to.”
It’s not an answer, but it is a continuation of the conversation.
“What happened to the one from the Malibu house? Did he go down in the bombing?”
“I can show you to your room if you want,” Wanda offers. “Or we can do the full tour.”
“No,” Steve says, and he shakes his head even though Tony can’t see. “Look, I really appreciate what you’ve done. It means a lot to all of us here. But I don’t need you to do...whatever this is.”
“Steve,” Peter says, and it’s really quite comical how self-aware he looks then. “I can call you that, right? Mr. Stark told me I could.”
“Never, then?” Steve prompts. “Or just - not now?”
“Keep still,” Tony reminds him, and he can’t help but nudge his own cock up against the junction of Steve’s ass and thigh, the friction just barely enough to whet his own desire for the moment. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
Steve switches to his contacts list. He scrolls, scrolls, scrolls far down until he reaches a name that he’d never confirmed was attached to the number that had called him once upon a time. The tiny black font blurs the longer he stares at it, and he stares for so long that he starts to zone out. The words coming through the soundbar on the entertainment center filter through in pieces, each of them peeling back bits of the carefully constructed demeanor he’d spent several heartbroken months perfecting.
Bucky and Sam and Wanda look good, if tired. They eat in a diner, and Bucky demolishes several burgers while Sam complains about his table manners.
“He parties too much,” Peggy tuts as they grocery shop, Tony’s face smeared on the front of multiple tabloids at the register.
They’re too close, Steve knows, and sucks in a chlorinated breath in an attempt to steady himself. It doesn’t work, his legs wobbly with the effort of keeping upright and staying away. There’s only a handful of feet between them, then three, two, and then Tony is so close that Steve can see the soaked clumps of inky-black eyelashes, can trace the razor-sharp edge of his facial hair, can feel the heat rising between them and the flood of arousal throbbing from deep inside out to the involuntary curl of his toes. He knows he should look away, but physically cannot.
The glint in his eyes absolutely says he's full of it.
“She wanted to wait,” Howard says, like that makes it okay. “You’ve seen her. No way she was letting a kid get in the way before she got this whole operation up and running smoothly.”
Rather, he preoccupies himself by flagging down a bartender as politely as possible. In the short window of time during which the bartender serves at least three other people - who, while not exactly worth cornering for a quote, do rank far above Steve in a place like this - he waits patiently and considers one more cycle through the festivities before calling it a night. Some of the more prominent guests are leaving for less official after parties, anyway, and he doesn’t want to linger unfashionably.
“As long as you don’t get mushrooms, fine by me,” Tony says. “Now come on, let me show you how to talk to FRIDAY, this is the perfect opportunity. FRIDAY? Yeah, I know, I think he’s afraid of the future or something, try not to hold that against him.”
Steve doesn’t sleep much that night, and wants to cry when he realizes he can’t remember the last time Serena woke up in the middle of the night and needed him to hold her. Instead, he holds a pillow to his chest and forces himself to breathe.
Whatever is it about that boy.
“You got a complex or something?”
He can live in this fantasy world for just a second, just this once.
“Damn Barnes,” Tony says as he turns it over in his hands. “No matter how many times I try to turn him onto repulsor technology, he’s so old school. Hey, you’ll talk to him, yeah? Try to get him to accept this middle-ground?”
Between Tony’s instructions (“You can talk to her like she’s a normal person, she’s not fucking
Tony would swear his heart skips a beat, and not for the first time he wonders if anyone else has ever had a friendship like this. He wonders if Steve is this dedicated to Sam or Bucky, or even Natasha, except he knows that he isn’t, otherwise he’d have a reason to stay with them.
Rogers looks at him.
“She’s got no reason to remember,” Steve says, forcing himself not to hide.
They press closer together, Tony wiggling in until he’s tucked against Steve’s throat. Steve doesn’t dare take more than he’s given, no matter how badly he wants to curve a hand around the back of Tony’s neck and never let him go, so he merely lets himself grow heavy-lidded with relaxation. Always one to fidget though, Tony adjusts to sling both wrists around Steve’s shoulders, fingers looping together to keep him there, so Steve bows his head to make it easier on Tony’s slumped stature.
“No, JARVIS didn’t die in the ocean,” Tony says with a muffled snicker. “You’re funny, though. He was an AI, there was no physical form to speak of. I, ah - okay, this bit is kind of classified.”
“Sorry,” Steve says neutrally, bowing his head as he stands up and brushes his palms on the front of his thighs. “Just - just was thinking about something. I’m glad you’re alright.” He looks at Tony properly then, earnest in a way that takes some getting used to because it comes out so infrequently. “It would be a shame if you had to sit out the next mission with a serious injury.”
Tony sighs.
For whatever reason, Tony appears delighted at being called out.
“I know my name,” he says, and he lifts Christina off the counter with one hand, setting her down on the ground easily. “You two go change out of your school clothes because Josie won’t be happy if you get ketchup all over those shirts, okay? Then come back down and we can go.”
“Yeah.” A self-deprecating chuckle rings against his eardrums. “I’m an idiot, I know.”
“Yeah,” he agrees. “You finally went to see him, didn’t you?”
Rogers makes a sound like he’s annoyed.
Now is the first time Tony’s ever really stepped down to proclaim that he might be worth as much as the rest of them - no, maybe he’s brought the rest of them higher; yes, that’s it - and Steve’s running out of excuses. Because if he sees Tony as a higher power and Tony doesn’t even believe in one, then there’s nothing left but a manageable distance that only requires Steve to put one foot in front of the other.
“It is,” Tony says. “It is that simple. You don’t trust me?”
“Parker?” she asks, another glass already in hand. “You’re at least eighteen, aren’t you?”
“I can do it,” he offers. “I can open myself up. I can show you, or we can do that another time. As I said, it’s been a while, so it’s not the worst idea for me to do it myself.”
With Steve at the helm once more, they set off on their next great adventure. Tony knows he’s being obnoxious, tossing things in the cart based on whether or not they catch his eye for more than a split second, and Steve remains impressively stoic as he snags Tony’s elbow before he can even pull the fifth consecutive bottle of shower gel off the shelf.
and they’ve been together for a while, long enough that Steve’d feel like an asshole for taking anything Tony is saying as anything more than professional kindness muddled with leftover playboy charm - but his face is still warm and his stomach still feels weird, and pushing all that aside requires more brainpower than he’s accustomed to using before the start of his workday. So really, it’s not his fault for blushing even hotter while mumbling out, “Yeah, of course,” the words coming out in an unsophisticated tangle that, unreasonably, makes Tony grin even
So he busies himself.
“You could’ve told me that we’d hitchhiked from Nevada, or that we’d rode unicorns to the moon and back, and I would've believed you,” Steve says, the confession more significant than intended. “Because I do trust you. I do believe you when you tell me I didn’t get sick, and I believe that you chose me to break your retirement news for a reason. So can I trust you to tell me what really happened?”
Tony’s expression goes sad. “I wish that were true.”
When he pulls the phone away from his ear to check the time, it reads 6:54.
“Yeah,” Steve says, and he’s vibrating with tension, like this entire meeting has been a tightrope act for him, a balance between doing what is right and what is easy.
“I said no, because I didn’t need you to show off for me.” Steven’s mouth quivers despite his best efforts, a victim to the frigid atmosphere surrounding them, and it’s like speaking through nervous marbles. “I enjoyed spending time with you as you were. I didn’t need to watch some priceless suit of iron in action to appreciate your company.” Bravery tastes bold and round. He rocks back on his heels, caught on the precipice as Tony looks into him in that manner that no one else can manage.
His fantasies had always been hot and rushed, passionate with lots of tongue and frantic fumbling. He’d been unable to resist wanting to tear Steve’s clothes off within mere seconds, the two of them consumed with infinite amounts of burning desire. It’s been a handful of years of thinking like that, of getting lost in inappropriate daydreams and envisioning scenarios where Tony would attack and Steve would respond with equal fervor.
“Right here,” Steve says certainly, taking Tony’s mouth with his own without hesitation.
There’s a lot more sighing than Tony thinks is necessary, but Steve graciously steps out of the way and snaps a single blurry picture (okay, so he’s not always great with technology) that Tony promptly sends off. Hopefully the vibrations of the incoming text won’t wake Pepper.
“That’s what you wanted to say?” Tony asks skeptically.
“What?”
“Let’s try not to make any more ill-advised first impressions, okay?”
Steve grabs his hand, squeezing.
“What were you going to say earlier?” Steve asks, and in the low lighting Tony can see him wet his lips with the tip of his tongue.
“I had a daughter,” Tony says, his tongue somehow both dry and syrupy in his mouth, eyes locked on the bottle’s label unseeingly. “Who the hell let me have a daughter?”
“I know you like how it feels,” he says, because he has a vague recollection of how fulfilling it can be, and doesn’t need the experience to know how amplified it would be with someone it meant something with. “But it’s going to get really gross before you know it, and I know we agreed that it’s not weird to be doing this in this bed, but it might be nice to preserve some semblance of dignity here.”
“He gave me a bit of a heart attack at the time, so yeah, I think I remember the voice from the ceiling who ever-so-politely informed me that I wasn’t in Vegas anymore.”
“I’m sorry,” he tells Pepper profusely, trying to be conscious of whatever she’s thinking about him.
It’s why they work so well, because they communicate when they need to and trust each other unquestionably.
“I’m beat, honestly,” Tony admits.
“They’re going to have a boy,” he says, so quietly that he isn’t sure Peggy hears.
were, that time. You’d been drinking, Christ, you’d just been sick in the bathroom.”
this is something that might be here to stay, something he never anticipated being gifted. It’s more than his wildest dreams and he doesn’t know what to do with it as his mind quickly assembles every event that has led him here. There’s a mental highlight reel, some things in duplicate, another him and another Tony, and being so close yet so far, and this might be the real shock to the system.
“What I think isn’t important,” Steve repeats for what feels like the millionth time. “What’s important is that the world is torn between admiration and condemnation, and - ”
Just as Steve is about to resign himself to never knowing the truth, to accept that putting himself out there may not prove as fruitful as he’d always imagined and maybe Tony isn’t the sort of person to give him honesty -
“It’s just Christmas,” Hank says. “These kids have had a lot less these past few years. Anything we can give them will make a difference.”
Steve just gives Denise his best smile, the one that calms all the kids and charms all the donors and never seemed to work on the people who had mattered the most.
“He’s head of security now,” Tony continues. “I mean, he’s still recovering from everything. Got a long road ahead of him. But he doesn’t drive me around anymore.”
Tony is quiet, again.
He looks at Tony pointedly, but Tony is too busy wrestling the mug away and swallowing without regard for quality.
“Think that what’s weird?”
“I should go,” he manages to say. “It’s getting late, and the snow...”
“You sure?” Steve asks, going adorably pink as he does sometimes, and Tony nods emphatically. “I don’t know, I was just gonna say, I hope you know I wouldn’t let that happen to us. Not after everything we’ve been through.”
For a moment, it looks like Tony is about to hug him.
“Yes,” Steve agrees. “Let us say our goodbyes.”
The touch on the back of his neck disappears and Tony’s head swivels instinctively to see Steve looking mildly sheepish, now rubbing the back of
“Nothing,” Tony muses, all heavy-lidded with a cheeky smile. God, he looks good, enough that Steve wants to press their fronts together with a low growl and devour him. “Just - I’ve been noticing things about you too.”
“I haven’t made that woman happy a day in her life,” Tony says definitively, incredulously. “And I doubt she’d stoop so low as to marry me, much less have a kid with me. What the hell was your Pepper smoking?”
Steve considers Tony, the way his eyes look tired and a little wired, like it’s driving him crazy not to have all the answers, but he’s holding back as much as he can for Steve’s sake.
At four forty-five, he pulls his phone out of his desk drawer and thumbs around the touchscreen. Absently clicking in and out of apps, he avoids one in particular until he ends up locking the screen and shoving the phone back in the drawer. He emails his editor to let her know he’s staying late and will have his portion for the feature finalized by the time he heads home. The box stares at him from the corner of his eye and his phone is nearly burning a hole through the wooden drawer front, so Steve pushes back from his desk to stretch his legs for a bit.
Halfway through editing the thing and trying to decide whether or not it would be weird to include the part where Tony ribs him for almost getting sick on the plane all those years prior, his phone vibrates. He glances at the screen automatically, the notification only registering once his eyes have drifted back to the sea of words on his work desktop.
“I could put in a good word for you,” he offers, and Tony pouts for as long as it takes them to finish eating. Then he’s forced to stop, mesmerized by the way Steve licks his fingers sparkling clean.
“Then you understand.” Tony tips his head in Steve’s direction. “I wasn’t a good enough man to stop myself back then, but at least I have the sense to regret it.”
He only knows how to hold the kids who wake up from nightmares, hold them and tell them they’re safe and it’s okay to sleep. He only knows how to coordinate fundraisers and fill out applications for grants and scholarships. He only knows how to draw heroic battle scenes, a reimagined version of the events at the compound where he fights alongside Sam and Natasha and someone who isn’t Tony wears the gauntlet and his shield isn’t pulverized by the end of it.
“Fucking Spanx,” Tony says, and Steve nods in agreement as he gets to his feet and slots the mug back in place. It’s handpainted, from Clint’s kids with smudged glazed fingerprints forming caterpillars and butterflies and flowers with smiley faces and stems. A Christmas present circa 2015, if Laura’s lettering by the handle is anything to go by. “That was a good time.”
“What - ”
“There’s more?” Tony asks, looking up from his knees.
Then he’ll opt out of sharing Natasha’s takeout, eyeing fragrant curries and oxtail with rice-and-peas as though he has yet to decide whether they’re a threat to his well-being or not.
He’d known what he’d said back then, back when he was high on adrenaline and infatuated beyond belief. He’d made promises he couldn’t keep, taken actions he’d come to regret, and had generally made a clusterfuck of things ever since.
I need for you to be afraid to die, and to find something you will live for, no matter the cost.”
you.”
There’s a pregnant pause in which Steve thinks Tony is figuring out how to let him down easy, which verges on hysterical because Tony has never been the type to let anyone down easy.
Actually, there’s one more thing he needs.
, he’s too kind and Tony has always wanted things he can’t have, and this is no exception.
“Come on,” Tony mutters, gripping Steve probably too tight and it’s unrefined, unable to keep a perfect rhythm as he feels himself slipping on the fringes of coordination. “Come on, I’m right here, you’ve got this - ”
Tony obliges when Steve demands he slick up his hand, and then grasps Tony with such painstaking care that he ends up panting hotly into Steve’s mouth.
“Maybe if you’d add a little more ammunition to your suit, you’d be able to compete with me.”
“You barely needed me,” Wanda dismisses. “And I missed Morgan’s weekend with Stark. You owe me for that.”
“Hey.” There’re icy points of faint pressure on his cheek, skimming down the side of his neck. “Hey, calm down. It’s just an offer, you don’t have to - ”
“What?”
“I can’t change the channel if you don’t ask me to,” Sam says, just a hair too close to antagonistic, and Steve knows he’s right. He sighs in response, leaving his phone on his thigh and raking fingers through his hair.
“We bought a multipack,” Steve says after a moment, thrown by the question. “There’s vanilla and coconut-lime. I think Crystal picked it out.”
Tony sighs and turns off the main highway. The road narrows, but the palms are just as tall and skinny. “Sometimes I think all that history was what held us together at the end. There's a lot of love there - don’t get me wrong. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned in life, it’s that love isn’t necessarily a deciding factor. Neither of us wanted to be alone for a while there. The last time we were apart - well, it didn’t go so hot.”
In the early afternoon, he drinks over-creamed coffee and gnaws his way through a hastily-assembled sandwich while he listens to the interview - again.
“I’m older now,” Steve says, which Tony laughs at because it’s ridiculous. “I know what I want.”
Wanda looks so peaceful that Steve doesn’t even recognize her as the girl he met in Sokovia. She clasps their hands together and Steve trusts her, and when he pulls away with harmless red emanating from between them, she’s smiling.
“Because that was up for debate,” she quips. “You come to steal our favorite house dad?”
and bows his head enough to speak directly into Steve’s ear, teeth catching on fragile cartilage as he snaps his hips at the angle that keeps getting Steve to make that glorious face.
“Try me. I’m not going to be mad.”
“As long as I don’t end up with food poisoning, I think we’re in the clear,” Steve teases, and there’s something in there that’s somehow, wonderfully, far past friendly.
“You will come, won’t you?” Tony asks through the death of his chuckle, more of a murmur than anything. “To the party?”
If he closes his eyes and tries, Steve can hear the repulsors firing.
“Let me buy your coffee,” Steve blurts out, reaching forward to gently catch her elbow. “It’s the least I can do.”
Stronger than ever comes the urge to ask Tony for the truth. Steve doesn’t even have a good reason not to anymore, only that he doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to look Tony in the eye again if he has to confess that he doesn’t know what happened that one night. Which is worse: discovering that they’d been together and he’d been drunk enough to forget it, or being wrong and inadvertently revealing his years-long unreciprocated crush in the process? Tony wouldn’t ridicule him or make him feel shitty for it, Steve’s confident enough in that, but still. He doesn’t know that he can withstand the humiliation he’ll feel regardless of Tony’s reaction, but he does know that it’s no longer fair to either of them to let it go unconfirmed.
Steve had merely shaken his head. “I don’t need it anymore. And he lost his. He lost everything, back in that universe. It’s the least I could do. I couldn’t give him anything else he wanted, but I could give him back his shield.”
He sidles up carefully, coffee cradled in his arms, looking to try and see what’s gotten Steve’s attention. “Do you want a rotisserie chicken for dinner?”
“I will push you in the pool,” he calls after him, which is a bit of an empty threat seeing how many times Rhodes has jumped in already, but it earns a round of laughter that has Tony looking pleased as punch while dipping his fingers into the waist of Steve’s swim shorts.
“I didn’t want to risk it,” Steve murmurs, eyes falling shut as his head tips back. “If anything had happened…”
“This is for young Parker here,” Tony says, and he just barely avoids Steve’s outstretched arm to hand the wooden stick to Peter. “You’re a grown man, you can get your own dessert.”
It’s better than being asked to pose for a picture for social media, but as he’s waiting at the curb with his cap pulled low over his brow, he realizes that he doesn’t hate that concept as much as he had six months prior.
“It’s going to be a new era,” Steve says, so perfectly still he could pass for asleep. “Are you still thinking about taking a break?”
Tony nods, more to himself than anything as he leans against the frame of the car and strokes his jaw with his thumb and forefinger.
Steve takes the cigarette and holds on for too long, because buried underneath mental images of Tony’s surprisingly muscled upper half and the desire to run his hands through the slowly drying ringlets smeared across the tops of his ears, shifting them out of the way so he can run the edge of his teeth along the delicate cartilage shell, he does remember some of what he’s there for. It’s a tactic, perhaps one of the easiest in the book: waiting for the interviewee to fill the silence.
“Fucking
Steve smiles into his shoulder, shaking his head.
“This is private property,” Tony returns. “Any neighbors peeping through their front windows will just add to the 1950s charm of the place.”
“Oh yeah, you can say that because you missed the hard part,” he scoffs, elbowing Bucky away from his fries.
Rogers looks down at where he’s about to fit nearly half an egg in his mouth in one go and lowers his fork with a sheepish, stilted half-smile.
“She’s not even tall enough,” Tony says, scrubbing a hand over his face after she leaves the room, slamming her bedroom door above them. “I’m not building the kid stilts so she can fly out of a harness and die, all in the name of the world’s weakest adrenaline rush.”
A very strong part of him wants to find the words, to ask
“Of course she knows,” Tony says, and he goes to pinch Steve’s exposed arm but Steve neatly steps just out of reach just in time. “She knows everything.”
The realization dawns, sickeningly raising the foreboding hairs on the back of his neck.
“And you don’t want to be an Avenger without me,” Tony says, carefully watching Steve for a reaction. He stays frustratingly unruffled though, hands settling on his hips as he licks his lips before speaking.
“It’s nothing,” Steve shrugs.
“A miserly token of my appreciation for putting up with me all over the years.”
Steve doesn’t falter, not even for a millisecond. “Walking keeps you humble. Keep up,” he advises, like he hasn’t heard a single thing Tony has said.
“It was a good article. No wonder he doesn’t hate you.” Steve forces himself to meet Rhodes’ eyes dead-on. “He really does hate all journalists. I guess you’re the exception.”
“It hurts,” she says, on the verge of crying again, and Serena holds her other hand diligently.
“How do I know you?” Tony asks, but it feels like a question he’s asking himself. “You...and Peggy. You knew my father.”
and Tony looks wild and lost and found all at the same time, and it’s so much that Steve doesn’t understand how they aren’t both plastered all over the walls already.
“The compound’s been rebuilt,” Sam says, once Bucky has passed off the phone. He hadn’t said much beyond a greeting, telling Steve that it was good to hear his voice and he hoped he was doing well. “It’s not the same, but it’s something. We’ve got Wanda, and Rhodes spends a lot of time here. Scott came by a couple of weeks ago to consult on something, brought Hope. That was one hell of a time. You could drop in.”
“I didn’t tell you anything I didn’t want you to know,” Steve tells him before leaning forward to rap his knuckles on the desk once,
Steve calls Fury, tells him to call Carol, and this time, Fury gets to laugh him off the phone.
When he pulls away, Steve misses him instantly. He doesn’t chase the feel of him, though, settling for raising an eyebrow.
Steve just rolls up his sleeves and offers to help, and before Rhodes can finish asking him to scoop avocados for guacamole, Carol is pushing a pitcher into his chest.
“Who else is there to talk about?” Steve says, raising an eyebrow as Christine dips her head in concession. “He’s been one slip of the hand away from being escorted off the premises all night.”
And that’s all the introduction he gets.
“What if I wasn’t willing to talk it out?” Tony asks, just to be contrary. “What if we couldn’t find a way to compromise?”
Tony smothers a spread palm over his face, sheltering his eyes from the darkness of the night around them. The windows are heavily tinted, shielding them from the bright lights of the city.
“Right. This was supposed to be about you,” Steve reminds, belatedly recognizing his use of the past tense, admitting that they’ve long since traversed into murky waters
And it’s definitely got nothing to do with the fact that he never expected to be here, privileged with drinking in Tony Stark’s secondhand smoke while buried under the sparkling vanilla-strawberry scented grit of Sin City. What even is his life, Steve thinks with a silent choked laugh, opting for another swig of beer as Tony opens his eyes. They land on Steve without any sort of detour, and Steve hopes he hasn’t been caught staring.
“Come here,” he says, kissing the furrow away and taking the whipped cream and chocolate sauce out of Steve’s hands. “I’ll show you what to do with these.”
“Hey, don’t go copying me now.”
“Is there anyone that’ll be looking for you?” Steve asks, determined to stick around only as long as it takes to ensure Tony’s continued safety, and not a moment longer.
“For waking me up after like, three hours of sleep.”
“Do you think we’re ready for whatever’s coming?”
“That wasn’t exactly my area of expertise,” Steve says, and Tony looks disappointed but not discouraged. “A bit above my pay grade, I'm afraid. The other you figured it out, though. I’m sure you’ll get there before long.”
“I don’t have to be there, if that’s the problem.”
“Just leave it,” Tony dismisses. “Someone will come around to clean up, I doubt I’ll be here much longer.”
He doesn’t, though. He just sits next to Steve and listens to the crooning from the hidden speakers - which means Sam has won for the time being, he thinks with a
His voice rises to a near shout by the end there, and Steve’s heart is abruptly clawed to shreds.
“Well, fuck,” Tony says as a chuckle threatens to bubble up out of him, never good at letting a silence sit. “That’s not fair.”
He’s distracted as he lowers his hand, examining it closely.
Steve gets in the pool with her, swimming laps until she clings to his back, all high-pitched squeals and giggles in his ear as he drags her around. Tony watches from a lounger, working away on a tablet even as Morgan splashes him.
Tony isn’t sure who kisses who; all he knows is that Steve is willing and pliant under him, surprisingly good at taking direction since conceding temporary leadership. Tony relishes the ability to direct the scene, loves how Steve doesn’t question it and does his best not to let thoughts of how the culmination of years of work and trust and friendship has given them this privilege overwhelm him.
“Cap started it.”
“Alone,” Tony supplies, because even though he’d had Peggy up until relatively recently, the old Steve had never quite shed whatever sadness and loneliness he’d allowed to accumulate in his other timeline.
Steve doesn’t want to talk about the hard stuff.
“Talk about a man with one hell of a plan,” Tony says, his chuckle coming out overly breathy. “Yeah, yeah. You don’t have to ask me twice.”
“Right…” Tony says, not quite following.
bruising Steve’s feelings in the process. “You really, really care about me!” He picks up his pace again, pretending to swoon like an old movie star with his hand pressed to his breastbone and everything.
“You laugh,” Steve says, doing his best to hold back a chuckle of his own, “but look who stole the last of it.”
“You’re ready to go,” he tells her, and she imitates him by patting his thighs before skipping off to meet her mother.
and tell me that you don’t want to go over there and see which one of us he winds up propositioning first?”
The ‘Rogers’ cuts deeper than it should, but it’s not entirely foreign at this point. Four years later, and he’s almost finally mastered how to not let a single word from Tony Stark ruin his life. He wants to laugh about it until he cries, but just flicks the tab on the can and winces when it pings painfully against the side of his thumbnail.
It’s not that Steve doesn’t know why it’s awkward, because he does.
He had been tired, and knew that he couldn’t take care of his team if he didn’t take care of himself, so he passed on a pile of blankets on a too-short couch. Tony had stretched out in the bed obnoxiously, complaining about Steve’s long limbs until they were bickering like children. It wasn’t until Steve brought down the metaphorical hammer that they shut up and closed their eyes, knowing that they had a rough road ahead of them if they were going to defeat Ultron.
Do they want the story behind the mask, or about the man behind the mask?
“Well, thank you,” he says as he realizes that Pepper must have opted for walking with him over immediately getting in the car after getting her coffee. “What you did, it did a lot for me. Without you, I’d still be stealing coffee from the office instead of treating myself to five-dollar lattes every now and then.”
So he doesn’t waste any time. He reaches for his rusty Japanese to ensure them some time alone, reaches to pull Steve’s chopsticks out of his hand, and then holds the clammy appendage between his.
“I need another drink,” Tony says, a faraway look turning his eyes unfocused as he scans the room, the thrum of a heavy bassline vibrating through the sticky floor and up along the center pole. “What do you think?”
It’s the longest day Steve has ever had.
“You might not like it,” Steve says, not a warning, but close. “In fact, I’m pretty sure you won’t like it.”
“I do,” he admits. “I wasn’t sure. I was afraid it wouldn’t happen.”
“We really should get to sleep,” he says. “Unless you’re willing to reschedule training tomorrow.”
His heart beats a restful sinus rhythm and he measures his breathing while reminding himself that this is his job. He’s good at his job. He can do this.
“That’s not really relevant to the article,” Steve deflects.
(Here’s the thing: Tony is beautiful.
“Here,” Steve murmurs, and easily works Tony’s shirt up and off, and Tony immediately draws them together from shoulder to hip, cursing under his breath and burying his face in Steve’s neck.
So Steve does, as the rain pours down outside.
And Tony does have him, because he comes long and pulsing as he collapses down onto Steve who clenches around him till Tony is certain he loses his grasp on all his senses. It takes several moments before he can gather himself, and he braces himself to move out of Steve before there’s an aggressive slap to his ass.
Steve paces in the dry earth, hands pulling at his hair.
“No, you asked about my relationship with my dad and didn’t take me up on any opportunity to talk about yourself, and it wasn’t because you had anything to hide or wanted to flatter me. You cared, and genuinely didn’t believe that I could want to know anything about you, and I can’t tell you the last time in my life that someone came along where the only thing that they wanted from me was for me to just…be me.”
“Don’t listen to him,” Natasha says, and Steve curves his shoulders inwards. “He’s just being obnoxious because he’s pissed he got food poisoning and missed out on the opportunity to - ”
The band holds him in its vice-like grip for months, multiplying until there are so many that it’s a miracle they don’t ruin him.
“Is there someone I can get for you?” Steve asks carefully. “Someone I can call? I don’t want to leave you alone.”
Steve jostles their hands and rolls his eyes.
“And you’re already teaching her money management,” Steve says seriously, knocking Tony’s bottle with his. “Very important stuff at that age.”
Caustic, but not directed at Steve.
Steve is so tired of crying, of denying it. He could be mad at himself for not knowing before, only he is too old to hold himself to the standards he used to. There had been so much that they’d gotten caught up in, and it’s taken him the better part of both lives to figure it out, but now he can be sure.
“I didn’t say anything,” he says, keeping his eyes forward so he doesn’t expose himself. Justin Theroux is attempting to extract Tony from whatever mess he’s in the middle of creating, and Steve grimaces into his glass before tipping back the last of it.
Steve folds the book closed, index finger marking his page.
“It’s never
They find themselves in some strip club a short limousine ride away - a ride full of Tony artfully dodging questions about his company’s weapons contracts and his rather colorful dating history in between turning the attention back on Steve until he’s fighting a rising blush and almost forgetting that Happy the bodyguard is just a couple of feet away in the driver’s seat, respectably ignoring every word exchanged as the radio plays on low.
Howard lights another cigarette. Steve crushes his under the toe of his shoe, stares out around them, and reminds himself of why he’s here.
Steve unfolds his long limbs until he’s on his side, half over Tony and taking the lube back. He doesn’t do anything with it, just holding it as he props his head up in his hand.
“I think I’d like to suggest a third option,” Steve says slowly, leaning back to rest an elbow on the porch about them, shifting on his side. Laid out like the main course of an extravagant dinner, Tony can’t take his eyes off of him: the curved fullness of his lips, the lines of his outstretched body, the white-pale of the tops of his feet as they cross at the ankle.
“That Bucky killed my parents,” Tony says bluntly, never one to mince words. “That he didn’t want to tell me, but an old man made him.”
It occurs to him, looking at Tony, that he's younger than Steve remembers.
“This isn’t your fault,” she says firmly, but it’s been another month of trying, and nothing is happening, and Steve doesn’t understand. He doesn’t understand how Peggy can be so patient, so understanding, so resilient. “Howard says he knows of a doctor at Columbia that might have some answers.”
“Yes, I’m still here. No, I’m not sneaking a picture. He looks just like he does on tv. This is what you get for going to live in stupid Dallas, you know.”
“Okay,” Steve says on an exhale, relief etched into every bit of his expression. “
“Hey,” Steve says one afternoon. They’re enjoying the sun on the balcony, sprawled out and at ease with a bowl of cherries that they’ve been feeding each other.
“What?” Steve asks dumbly, blinking slowly. “He - he’s missing.”
That’s okay, he thinks, lying back down in the grass, eyes drifting shut again. He deserves to rest.
Annoyed by Tony’s snickers, Steve seals his mouth shut.
“About?”
“Just like Bruce,” Tony says, and Steve’s heart stutters before the moment passes and he can laugh along.
“Maybe you’re onto something,” he says, eyes flickering around. “A break doesn’t sound half bad.”
“What about you?” Steve asks, without thinking, because he’s dumb like that sometimes.
Steve had pretended not to be half in love with it, and failed miserably halfway through his third draft of the piece. Now, back at work Friday morning after spending most of his Thursday night hammering the article into something somewhat presentable, he’s itching to figure out whether or not the lines he’s crossed are that obvious to a third party.
Tony gets up long enough to get the coffee going again, because Carol was cruel enough to leave the pot on the opposite end of the counter, and then sits back at the counter and whines until everyone is seated with a plate and Steve pulls out the barstool next to him.
“Was he like this in your world?”
Morgan sighs, frustrated and exhausted from the sunshine. “Please?”
A wounded noise inadvertently makes its way out of Tony’s throat and he reels Steve in as much as he can, aware that he’s semi-hard and pressed against a concrete stomach but genuinely unable to care.
“You look good in blue, you know.”
Steve merely grins wisely, and Tony wastes no time in pulling out a chair.
“Oh, totally,” Tony agrees. “I definitely don’t remember that recent mission where you told Wanda to do whatever it took to get those wannabe HYDRA goons crying for their mothers. That was so very well thought out.”
Steve rolls his eyes and gets out from behind the desk to pick up the mess Tony created. It’s a small but notable blessing that he doesn’t demand Tony clean it up.
He makes himself wait. He makes him wait while he fetches his garden shears and cuts off the last of the year’s cosmos, still vibrant as he ties them with twine. His other self looks at them uncertainly.
So he just smiles placidly, watching as Rogers’ eyes find Tony again, the two of them maintaining eye contact for a beat too long before glancing away.
“I don’t know about you, sunshine, but I’m thinking that’s exactly the kind of first impression we should be making,” Tony tells him, heading to the kitchen to get more caffeine. He gets stopped before he can open the fridge though, Steve wrapping around him from behind and smelling like grass and fresh soil and manual labor as he pulls the cup from his hand and sets it on the counter.
Steve had exhaled in one long craggy breath, slumping forward until their foreheads found each other.
“Do I get to know what this is about?” Tony asks, when it’s getting late, even for those who aren’t senior citizens. Steve can feel himself getting hungry, but he’s been trying to recall something in particular, identify why Tony’s holograms don’t look quite right.
He’s not wrong. The lighting directed at the stage is enough that the burst from the flame doesn’t make a lick of difference, but Steve still pays attention to how Tony looks swathed in artificial blues and purples, spotlights on a man who’s lived his entire life under them. Tony takes a few long moments to savor the first couple of drags, dried lashes fanned out and casting shadows over the tops of his cheekbones, and Steve takes advantage of the opportunity to stare.
“We?”
Ah, Monaco. How could anyone forget what a spectacle that had been?
“And probably not that elite of a club,” Clint concedes, and Steve scoops the pen cap off the floor to nail Clint in the forehead with it. He goes to leave again, this time for good, but only after he’s reassured them that yes, he’ll be there at the usual time and place, ready to ritualistically unwind from a long week at work.
Steve doesn’t even bother to hold back the groan, and Sam grins.
And then, he’ll deal with whatever choice he makes.
“This universe has you,” Steve says plainly. “Maybe it took me a while and a phenomenal wife and the risk of living in a world without any version of you and then dying - but this one? With you? It’s my favorite. No question.”
Steve ushers them inside, pink-cheeked and adorably flustered as the woman continues to stare with eyes the size of dinner plates.
“I can’t finish the piece,” he says, forging onward before his momentum can slow.
So he keeps his story neutral, refuses to take a side. He speaks like the most unbiased of historians, telling Tony of how he’d left his shield and Tony behind without the gory details, and manages to keep the emotion out of his voice. It’s not an easy task, but it’s an important one.
“I told you why.”
So he wraps his jacket tighter around him in the whipping winter wind to head up the drive to what is hopefully the main entrance, and spends the entire walk giving himself a pep talk on how to
“I think the house was built in the seventies,” Steve says, forcing himself to frown, but he can’t hide the entertained sparkle in his eyes.
“We both know you’re not in the habit of dropping thousands of dollars on clothing for yourself,” she says slyly, nodding in the direction of the box. “So, who’s the sugar daddy?”
(Tony had promised him something, too.
“Tony,” he says, stubborn but sounding so content that for a second, Tony forgets why he ever wanted to move. “Just shut the hell up and let us enjoy this.”
“Tony,” he tries again.
“JARVIS says I’m clear,” Tony says, and it’s useless to fight Steve as he hitches the fabric higher and higher, a clear frown on his face. “And there’s nothing we can do for bruising, you know that.”
Tony’s brow furrows minutely before he’s chuckling along. “You came awfully close.” When he looks up at Steve, his head tilts. “You don’t remember?”
“Unless you have more questions, or are ready to head out,” Tony offers. His neck cranes to look at the time. “It isn’t that late, and you’re not terrible company when you’re not acting so self-righteous and trying to force your opinions on me, but I can get FRIDAY to order us a pizza so I can pick your mind and bare top-secret secrets without risking you dying of hunger.”
“I don’t know how to cook,” Steve explains, and when he looks at Tony, he doesn’t appear bothered. It’s like he’s merely making observations.
He should have gotten more, he realizes. More about the imminent retirement, facts and details. Instead of doing his job properly, he was too busy demanding to know what he was doing there because he’s never been able to see past his own nose wherever Tony has been concerned.
“It doesn’t look that bad,” Steve defends. “Does it?”
“I need...something to drink.” Tony looks down at the toilet, the edge of a grimace visible from Steve’s vantage point.
“Absolutely,” Tony agrees. “I have complete and total faith in you.”
And Steve’s laugh is nice, comfortable and sweet as he holds Tony’s hands in his. He presses a kiss to them, his nervously bitten pink lips cool and dry as they skim over the peaks and valleys of his knuckles.
“More like, it’s freezing outside and I’m not really up to you offering me yet another ride-along with Iron Man,” Steve says, just in case Tony offers up yet another extravagant form of transportation.
Fury curses violently, but there’s no animosity there, and eventually he laughs.
For a moment Steve thinks it’s going to be terrifying, that he’s going to lose the ability to breathe and he’ll freeze up inappropriately and reveal himself as the worst kind of person in the entire world. But that doesn’t happen, and he just leans back a little to look at the kid in his arms, and smiles at her wobbly smile and slightly watery eyes.
“Shit,” Steve says, and the back and forth is pushing Tony beyond his limits now.
It’s like a piece of the puzzle slotting into place.
“Peggy?” he tries, worried until she looks up at him.
When he doesn’t answer, Tony stuffs a fist against his mouth, presses it there hard. They don’t look at each other, two men who don’t know each other, not really, and yet have intimate knowledge of each other’s framework and blueprints much more than can ever be sufficiently illustrated for anyone else to see.
“I’d be willing to take you up on that bet,” Tony says, steely. And then something clicks, and Tony narrows his eyes automatically. “What does he have to do with my parents’ death? Or did you just happen to walk in here today with two Earth-shattering but entirely unrelated revelations that you just so happened to be willing to share with the class?”
Because he needs for nothing to have happened. He needs to believe that he hadn’t been so incredibly
Sam catches the throw pillow handily and sets it next to him.
Later that day, as the last of the sun clings to the silhouettes of the palm trees, Tony wordlessly offers Steve a beer and presses against the balcony with him. Tony’s house is warmer than Pepper’s, modern but different with all the wood and dark coloring, and Steve likes it just as much as he does the tang of salt in his nose. Morgan is on the other end of the deck, splashing around in the pool even as the evening chill arrives.
Pepper’s house is elegantly bare and white, with bright splashes of art on the walls and clean angles everywhere. Steve thinks that in another universe, he would have detested modern art a little less and learned to appreciate it with Pepper. As it is, in this universe, they’ve never had much to say to each other besides the usual polite niceties.
“I think you were attempting to convince me that you needed both hair gel and wax at the time,” Steve supplies helpfully.
“I don't know that we have much of a system left to shock,'' she says, and then offers him a hand. “Let’s go for a walk.”
“What?” he asks, impatient.
“It’s okay,” Tony says without needing to think, because he can only imagine what kind of onslaught Steve is experiencing right now. “You’re doing great. Here, do you need me to touch you?”
Steve lets out a strangled sort of sound.
“It attracts viewers,” Steve says with a shrug that doesn’t communicate even a fraction of the outrage simmering deep inside. “You’re watching, aren’t you?”
“I mean it Rogers, order whatever you want, whenever you want,” Tony tells him. “Even at this time of night, places are always open.”
Steve thinks that he’s the one who got lucky.
“I’m sorry,” Steve manages to push out through partially crystallized lungs. “It’s just been a long day, a lot going on - ”
“Is that okay?” Steve asks.
“I just don’t think it’s fair,” Sam says, arms crossed and looking at Wanda accusingly. “There’s no proof she isn’t manipulating the water, and - ”
“I don’t,” Steve says. “Do you need something to sleep in?”
Daily, he holds her hand and feeds her lunch. He brushes her hair and loves her as best as he can, not nearly as much as she deserves.
“Really, you should be thanking Joe,” Tony says curtly.
A litany of curse words flits through Steve’s brain when he wakes up, jolted into consciousness with a flurry of disorientation.
There is no threat looming over them, no Accords, no gathering of the world’s leaders left vulnerable to attack. There will be no death, no meeting with T’Challa.
“I suppose it’s a lucky thing you didn’t spend all that time putting your own rooms together,” she says, scratching at the short bristly hairs on Steve’s nape while Tony huffs and reclaims Steve’s hand for himself. “Unless you saw this coming.”
“Sorry,” Steve says, not sounding sorry at all, before snarling, “Don’t you dare pull out.”
“So what about them?” Tony asks, willing to suspend some serious disbelief and buy into Steve’s giddy optimism if it feels this heavenly, like early morning gold and liquid sunshine pouring over them. “If we’re always in love, what happened to them?”
It verges on frantic, really. Tony knows he’s full of pent-up desire and he’s just praying Steve can handle it, handle how Tony hooks his wrists behind his neck and pulls them further into each other. Before long, the kiss turns wet and Steve lets Tony attack the velvet of his bottom lip with his teeth, biting and pulling harder and harder until he’s surprised he’s not drawing blood. Steve takes it though, takes it all and squirms underneath and he’s solid and insistent against the curve of Tony’s ass, a gift that he can’t wait to begin to unwrap.
“I did not take this out of the medicine cabinet.”
They all know Tony isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.
He settles Peggy back home where she sleeps heavily and often, and he keeps the news on until the fateful day finally comes and Fury calls him, tells him that he’s got his best agent on it.
“That’s the plan so far,” Steve says, and he snags the Oreo shake before Beth can suck up the rest of it.
He only realizes that his eyes are closed when Tony doesn’t respond and he has to open them to look over at where Tony is sitting in silence, as unmoving as marble as he rests a loose fist on one thigh crossed over the over. His other hand sits on the ledge of the car door interior, and he gazes off into the distance. As the real world beyond Tony Stark begins to rudely break into Steve’s processing center, it becomes apparent that the car is parked.
Steve wonders where everyone else is, because Denise is out with Crystal and Charlie, but otherwise everyone is supposed to be home.
Hyperaware, Steve pauses the recording and opens up a different app on his phone.
He keeps waiting for Tony to stop him, but he doesn’t. Tony lets Steve continue till he threads his fingers into surprisingly lush locks, tiny snowflakes almost melting upon contact. The white sprinkles only serve to add to the mature aura Tony’s been radiating since meeting Steve back inside, and it’s dangerous, because this Tony -
“You think I don’t have it all arranged?” Steve croaks out, unable to smile so soon after, but terrifyingly close.
“So you just wanted to right the universe,” Tony says, his expression unreadable and not because of the relative darkness. “Wanted to avoid giving one afterlife a skewed body count. You had no idea that you’d end up here.”
Tony peers at him closely, focusing, and Steve is brought back to the first and last time he saw the boy.
Steve had tried to reason him through that, but Tony had been resolute.
“Alright,” Tony says, looking out at the home in front of him and wondering about the last time it had seen happiness within its walls. “I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for the talk.”
Steve stares at his coffee. He definitely put too much milk in.
neck, and Tony pointedly meets Steve’s eyes with his own, challenging him.
Steve lets a beat pass, like he isn’t sure he believes Tony, and a bit of guilt flickers through him.
“You kind of made an announcement on live television,” Steve reminds. “And you haven’t been seen with him since.”
“We do okay,” Steve says, shaking his head. “It’s not about the money.”
“We’ve got your back,” Clint says, and Natasha nods. “You’re doing the right thing.”
“Tony,” Steve says, shoving his hands in his pockets. “I’m not - I’m not looking to be Captain America again.”
“Then trust me,” Tony says, and he soothes the pinched skin with a sweep of his thumb. “Besides. I’ll be offended if you don’t like this.”
“Sweetheart,” Pepper says, sipping her wine as she watches her daughter pull a yogurt smoothie off a shelf. “Do you remember Steve?”
Over the last seventy-plus years, Steve has learned that the blame lies with everyone, and to dwell on it is to everyone’s detriment.
“More like, what are the chances Tony lets Parker look at a margarita?”
“Maybe there’s nothing to know,” he says, fighting to keep the words even, even as he sits stiffly and drums his fingers on the arm of his desk chair. He doesn’t have to track Christine’s gaze to know that she’s spotted him fidgeting, but she possesses enough social grace to know when to respectfully bow out. After all, he’s a coworker, not actually someone she’d like to write an exposé on.
“Tony.” Pepper half-snaps half-groans, but Tony pays her no mind as Steve feels his tongue swipe over his lips. “Please. It’s too early to be sued for sexual harassment, and we’ve got a meeting to get to.”
Steve’s got that self-conscious look to him again. “I just thought - everyone else who knew him is dead. It’s up to us now.”
“They weren’t supposed to be back till later,” he says thoughtfully. When Steve feels his expression wrinkling with a lack of understanding, Tony clarifies. “I sent them on a training exercise. Didn’t want any distractions around for this.”
“No,” Steve sighs, content to bury his face in Tony’s hair. “Just want to be here with you.”
“That an open invite? We might be tied up for a while. Thinking about calling Wanda out for backup.”
Tony really, really hates when other people are right.
“So what?” Tony demands, the effect lost as Steve bucks his hips up and groans through gritted teeth, hands clenching from their relatively chaste positioning on his waist. “You dragged me here to tell me that other you was in love with other me, and hoped that would set the mood?”
Tony’s eyes narrow just a touch.
“You just told me why,” Rogers says, looking at him directly.
He figures it’s okay to ascribe to the Tony Stark philosophy, in which the day only really ends once you go to sleep. There’s no instinct for it, and Steve wants to sit on the wooden steps forever, uninterrupted.
“I grew up, Tony,” Steve says, unexpected bitterness smacking him dead-on. He clears his throat and averts his gaze from Tony’s dramatic wide-eyed offense. “That was four years ago. I’ve got a job I’d like to keep. I’m not some green reporter who doesn’t know better, not anymore. I’m not going to any afterparties.”
“Helped,” Tony scoffs. “Yeah, I
She’s magnanimous about it, looking up as she finishes talking with her thumbs hovering over the screen, and Tony is frowning at her. Pepper pulls a face at him, and Tony’s mouth does some weird sort of squiggly thing before Pepper’s eyebrows draw together in response. Happy’s the one to burst their little bubble, coughing loudly and clamping a hand down over the frame of the open door, and the two snap to attention. Pepper shoots Steve a no-frills kind of smile while Tony pastes on some poor facsimile of the grin he’d been wearing not fifteen seconds before.
Rogers doesn’t visit.
Tony turns thoughtful, then his eyes go wide.
When Tony can’t sleep one night, he heads down to the kitchen in the hopes that a snack will curb the racing thoughts in his head. What he finds is Steve Rogers sat at the counter, tucking into what looks suspiciously like a microwave baked potato.
For a brief moment, Steve thinks of that fight on the side of the highway. He’d called Tony out for never letting Steve do anything for him, and while part of that dynamic remains, he’s doing what he can to achieve equilibrium between them.
“Why?”
He expects Steve to open his mouth; whether to defend or lambast his from-another-timeline counterpart, Tony can’t decide, it’s a fifty-fifty shot. Steve’s mouth goes thin, holding back anything he might have to say in a relatively rare display of restraint, and there’s something decidedly melancholic about the sudden change in his expression as he scuffs the toe of his boot against the driveway.
Tony must overbalance, because as he’s angling his face to avoid smacking Steve’s face head-on (which Steve kind of wishes he would, and
“So if I wanted to be somewhere else - ”
“Did you put our rooms on the same floor on purpose?” he wonders.
It slots into place far more easily than any single revelation should. It explains the loneliness despite Peggy, why he’d sat back and orchestrated the things he did the way he had. It even explains why he’d stayed away from Tony his whole life, and he thinks of the conversation they’d had in the kitchen years prior in an entirely new light.
“I’ve never done this before,” he says plainly, and Tony feels a rush of such overwhelming fondness.
“Alexa,” Denise says sharply. “Charlie. That’s what you get for fighting. Let Steve have a donut.”
“Didn’t originally plan on staying the night. But I didn’t plan on arguing with you, either.”
“You wouldn’t.”
“You trying to get him to leave?” Denise asks with a snort. “After all the good he’s done us?”
“I made out with Tony Stark in the back of his car after the party,” he says, hoarse. “And then he took someone else home, bought the tux they’d loaned me,
“I love you,” he tells Peggy, her beautiful face blurry with his unshed tears.
The girls scramble towards the stairs, laughter trailing behind them, and Steve listens for a moment.
“I miss her,” Steve says, and his eyes are wet. “I miss her so much.”
But the sting of unmistakable rejection has Steve shaking his head, and he’s on his feet before he means to get up.
Ton gapes at him, and Steve burns with the desire to tell him everything.
(“You said it yourself, so many places don’t have the infrastructure to repair what’s been - ”
Until now.
, his thighs are burning. “Can you hold on a second?”
But later he sees him with a slider in each hand, and pats himself on the back for such a good deed.
“Does he make you call him ‘Mr. Stark?’” he wonders aloud, lifting his shaker to his mouth.
“If it makes a difference, I’m kind of a professional when it comes to getting things past you,” Steve says, and the corner of his mouth quirks up. “Let’s not forget that time with the force field.”
“Not from Mr. Stark, I hope,” she says, with an uptick of the corner of her mouth that’s just self-deprecating enough without being pitiful.
“Where’re we going, then?” Steve asks through a too-tight throat, and Tony just laughs, something ephemeral that’s easily lost to the cacophony of the Las Vegas strip before them. He swims to the far edge, long strokes that speak to lessons in his privileged youth, and Steve follows along with far less elegance, shaking his head at himself for doubting Tony’s talents.
“Never,” Steve says, shaking his head. “I’d never do that. Not when I’ve got what I do.”
“Sure thing,” Steve agrees, and then Tony’s clicking off the call, a dissonant buzzing noise taking his place, and it takes a beat longer than it should for Steve to set the handset in its place. For several long moments he just sits there, rubbing a hand over his mouth and staring out into space, acid prickling on the back of his tongue and a gradual sense of finality and foreboding settling in.
He may have prevented one war, but he is determined to prevent a second before he goes.
So she hurriedly packs their overnight bags and Steve checks the car, and she strokes the back of his hand as he drives into the night.
“We did,” Steve says, and he watches the fist that isn’t clenched around a bottle stiffen.
“But you said I got dumped on your doorstep,” he says, and they’re cutting deeper into the small forest, the dirt floor sloping every which way, but his footing never slips and neither does hers. “How did that happen?”
“It’s...something,” Natasha says, and Steve frowns at the lack of characteristic blunt honesty.
“And we can hammer out the details along the way, and nothing has to be set in stone. But I thought that somewhere down the line, you could figure out how you want to split your time, and spend some of it at the compound helping train up future Avengers.”
“So everything is what we want it to be,” he says, and the path suddenly descends steeply, the decline just barely navigable. “How does that...work?”
“I’m pretty sure we met in Vegas,” Steve says, caught between embarrassment and the desire to wrap a hand around Tony’s hip, if only to get him to stop bobbing around maniacally. “February, two-thousand and nine.”
“Cap.” Tony doesn’t know what to say to that, feels helpless.
“But Pepper deserves another shot,” Tony says. “She deserves more than being tied to me for the rest of her life.”
“Can you do Iron Man?” a middle school aged boy asks. He’s got freckles and ginger hair and the tops of his cheeks are starting to burn as he extends a strawberry colored piece of chalk. “I miss seeing him fly on the tv.”
When they dig him out of the ice, Steve refuses to have anything to do with it. Fury pays him a visit, lets him know that things aren’t going so well and they’ve set Rogers up in a private rehabilitation cabin.
It’s so startlingly simple. It’s exactly what Tony had meant when Steve asked if it was real, and Steve gets it instantly.
