Tony gapes at Steve before letting out a small huff of laughter. “You’re such a smartass, how does nobody know this?”
“This...isn't somethin’ I'm comfortable discussing right now. So get some sleep, okay? Your daddy and mommy will call you in the morning to talk to you.”
Meeting Howard’s kid, now a grown man, was something Steve had both looked forward to and dreaded. Would Anthony be anything like his father? Steve wasn’t sure what would be worse ー if the son was everything like the man or nothing. Looking back now, Steve can see that he was foolish to ever hope that having Howard as a point of commonality would be enough to forge a connection with Anthony…
Steve can’t help it, – he bursts into laughter at the complete innocence in Peter’s voice. Once he’s calmed down and explained to the disgruntled four-year-old that he isn’t laughing at him, Steve offers a banana as a snack, and a sketchbook and set of coloured pencils as entertainment. Thankfully, this is enough to keep Peter occupied; the drawing that fills the page is surprisingly detailed for coming from such young hands. Steve gives praise and asks the youngster about the picture, and Peter rewards him with a brilliant smile and an explanation of everything.
. He watches her go, her white-purple nails flashing through the air with each step, until she's gone. Rhodey sits on the stool she's just vacated and stares at Tony.
No one seems to notice, really, when the newlyweds, Tony, and Steve disappear from the reception; Phil and Steve stay a couple steps behind the parents as they head toward the suites Tony is paying for as yet another wedding gift to Pepper and Phil. Steve rests his shoulder against the doorframe of Peter’s room and watches as Pepper brushes a stray curl from her son’s face. Peter stirs a bit, his eyes fluttering open. Steve’s heart clenches tightly in his chest, a pleasant warmth spreading outwards, at the small smile that makes its way onto the kid’s face.
“So everybody here knows that Steve and I have been trying to have a baby, right? Good, because in about, oh, seven-ish months, we’ll have the cutest Avenger possible on our roster. So… yay!”
lets out an undignified squeak, nearly tumbling off the chaise. “Damn it, Romanov, why do you insist on giving me a heart attack?”
“I was – at first. I mean, Loki and magic? Not exactly my favourite things, especially since you’re still a bit...troubled by what happened. But Steve’s involved, and I knew you’d do anything for him, and you’re such a smooth talker that you could easily convince an ice queen that her kingdom needs more ice, let alone convincing yourself that what Steve wants is more important and you’d somehow be failing him if you didn’t go along with this.” She sighs, watching Steve laugh and Chat with Coulson. “I’m glad I was wrong, though. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you this happy about anything. I am so proud of you.”
Natasha steps off the elevator, looking as unsure as Steve has ever seen her. She’s changed into a pair of cotton shorts and a tank; her hair is wet, and her face is bare of any makeup. She pads barefoot across the floor, comes to a stop at Steve’s knee.
Steve turns his head to kiss the corner of Tony's mouth before he slumps over until his head hits his pillow; Tony follows immediately after, and Steve pulls him in closer. Tony rests his chin on Steve's chest and stares up at the blond.
“Hey, oh my God, I’m so sorry. I just now got out of the office. I was going to go to the hospital to visit someone, but that can wait until tomorrow. I’m on my way home now.”
Of course, as is his luck, once one part becomes less complicated, another has to become infinitely harder. And it’s all Sam’s fault.
Steve has no time to respond, as the edges of the hole shift, distort, and a figure steps through. It's anticlimactic, really, the way the portal snaps closed with an echoing
Steve sits on the curb, gazes out at the night. Loneliness creeps slowly into his bones when no other voice is there to keep him company. After a long few minutes, he sighs, pushes himself unsteadily to his feet, and heads inside. Sam and Natasha are both asleep on one of the beds; Steve watches their chests rising and falling with their breathing. He then makes his way to the unoccupied bed. It’s nearing midnight, and it’s been so long since he’s had uninterrupted sleep. He stretches out on top of the blanket, resting his hands under the back of his head, and stares at the shadows on the ceiling under his eyes finally close.
Tony ends the conversation by sliding a hand along Steve’s abs, swallowing the sighing moan as it passes through Steve’s lips. Though he can feel the panic already starting to rise, he pushes it aside to focus solely on Steve and making the next few hours pass in much more pleasant ways than warring with his self-doubt.
“Yeah,” sighs Steve as he puts his fork on the table, his appetite suddenly lost. Except it's not sudden at all. It's been a consistent thing over the last couple of months. “We figured out we had that control when we were about...twenty, I think. But… we've never gone this long. Something's wrong, Buck, Tony's never gone this long without showing up.”
Tony stays still, eyes locked on Steve’s, and Steve forces a small smile. Finally, his partner backs up; Loki advances until he’s less than a foot away.
“And if it fails? What then? We’ll just pretend nothing ever happened, and you’ll continue babysitting Peter like we’d never kissed or dated or fucked?”
Tony waves a hand dismissively. “Eh, he’ll learn to leave it alone eventually. Maybe. Well, at least it’s entertaining.”
Tony's breath escapes shakily, and he slowly faces Steve. His gaze remains on their connected hands, but Steve can still see the slight smile amidst all the confusion and apprehension.
, y’know? Create, create, fuck up, create some more to make up for the fuck up, defend my creations against the board, and so on.”
“It’s okay – all right,” Tony concedes, holding his hands up in surrender at the three-fold glare he receives. “Maybe ‘okay’ is a bad word, but as I was saying, Bruce and I can try to figure out something that
Steve is sitting on the couch in the penthouse staring blankly at the television. Some redheaded woman is baking some homey comfort food on the screen, but judging by Steve’s expression, he’s not taking in any of the show. Tony watches his partner, watches the way his breathing is intentionally slow and steady, watches the way he blinks far too often to be natural. He wants nothing more than to hold Steve tightly; he knows that the action is far from advisable at the moment. He shoves his hands into his pockets and clears his throat. Steve reaches forward, grabs the remote, and turns off the TV. He doesn’t look toward Tony at all, so Tony decides to take the initiative.
“And what time didja get to sleep?” asks Bucky with a not-so-subtle wink, voice laden with implication.
Smut abounds in this chapter, just a warning. If you'd rather not read it, then skip ahead a few paragraphs to
“Yeah.” Tony shrugs and stares at the deep navy sky, and Steve knows him well enough to know when Tony is trying to avoid looking at him, seeing something in Steve’s face that Steve isn’t aware he’s even expressing, something that could hurt Tony though he’d never admit it. “I mean, I know you said that Peter’s mentioned it, but after we all agreed we wouldn’t talk about it in front of him, you never brought it up again. And I don’t blame you, it’s awkward as Hell to have that kind of conversation, especially in front of your partner’s ex and her new partner, so the fact you never said anything else didn’t really raise any alarms, then Peter asked again tonight, and…” He trails off, his words fade into the dark like wisps of smoke that disappear on the slightest breeze.
Tony stares down at Steve’s hand but makes no move to take the cash. He blinks owlishly up at Steve. “I’m really not seeing the problem here, Steven.”
. If anyone’s gonna screw this kid up, it’s absolutely going to be me. I’m going to fail, and this child is going to hate me.”
, of all people. Tony’d meant to extend an olive branch by inviting the Star-Spangled Ass to live in the tower, which was just a smart idea for two reasons: One, less of a delay of action in case of an emergency, and two, it wouldn’t hurt to have Captain America on your side. But spending time with the epitome of perfection turned into spending time with Steve Rogers which turned into less fighting and more getting along, and somewhere between the first time Steve met the bots and their first real conversation that wasn’t full of mindless small talk, Tony had leaped over the line separating ‘platonic’ and, well…
Thor picks up Mjølnir from the floor, placing the hammer on the shelf. “I was unaware that Clint and Natasha would be here. I did not want to presume that arriving outside of the floor that you and Tony share would be acceptable. We were attempting to make our way down to the workshop, but unfortunately, our arrival did not go unnoticed.”
“Of course he was. He takes after his mom like that.” Tony glances away from his son's face, his teeth biting down on his lower lip in an effort to stifle a laugh. “Mm, kid drool, it's the latest fashion.”
A knock sounds on Steve's door later that evening, once Bucky is in his section of the rooms, locked down and away from others; the rest of the team is watching movies, celebrating the win by being together. Steve sets his charcoal down, brushes his hands on a scrap piece of cloth, and crosses the room. Tony stands on the other side of the door.
Tony smiles at the end of the rushed announcement, bearing the air of a man who has just won a multi-trillion-dollar lottery – proud and overjoyed, like nothing could ever take away the happiness he’s feeling. Silence falls, but in true Avenger fashion, it doesn’t last long. Sam nearly knocks over his chair in his haste to hug Steve tightly. Bruce, quiet though he normally is, lets out a startled cheer; Eira embraces Steve gently, murmuring about how happy she is for Tony and him. Clint shouts “They’re pregnant!” at a bemused Thor, and the puzzlement immediately clears from Thor’s face, replaced by a radiant smile; he stands, claps a heavy hand onto Tony’s shoulder, and wraps an arm around Steve, his voice loud and booming as he congratulates them. Steve makes a mental note to remind Tony to talk slower, especially with important announcements. Thor isn’t dumb – not by a long shot – but sometimes, Tony speaks like he’s the Energizer bunny after drinking three gallons of coffee, and even Pepper has, on occasion, had troubles understanding him or following the thread of conversation. Havardr is just as exuberant in his congratulations as Thor and Sam. Loki raises his water glass in Steve’s direction. Steve grins and dips his chin. Nat’s head lands on his shoulder; he glances down to see that her eyes are sparkling, and a light smile dances at the corner of her lips. Coulson stares at Steve speculatively, eyes cataloguing everything about Steve’s appearance. When finished, he shrugs and stands to shake Tony’s, then Steve’s, hand. Pepper is crying as she hugs Tony tightly, tight enough that he’s beginning to wince.
The person swears loudly as the back of their head slams into the edge of the fridge; Steve winces at the sight ー there’s no way that doesn’t hurt. He can feel heat rushing into his cheeks when the person turns around. Tony raises a brow and pops a cube of cheddar into his mouth, chewing slowly.
Nine o’clock catches him sitting alone in the living room of the penthouse, staring staring at the city nighttime skyline in all of its lit-up glory. There have been no calls or messages from Tony, one text from Pepper to apologise for her brusque manner earlier in the day, and still no straightforward answers from JARVIS. When the silence and loneliness build up to the point of being overwhelming, he heads down to the gym to release the tension.
of the suit taking off through the glassless windows. Natasha is suddenly by Steve's side, her suit jacket already off and wadded up. Another man crawls nearer through the wreckage ー T’Challa, the prince.  Steve makes sure that the situation is handled then takes off running for the exit. Sam and Clint are close behind. His phone rings in his pocket; he doesn't bother barking out a greeting.
“I’d be delighted to, sir, but I feel a request of this magnitude will be better received if it came directly from you.”
“I know, Steve, I know,” Tony whispers soothingly as he lets Steve hold tight and scream against the overwhelming surge of pain, and Steve doesn't mention that Tony's voice is thick and rough with his own hurt. “I wish she was still here, too, she would be so proud of you. I wish I could bring her back. I'd give my life if I could bring her back to you.”
“Internet, man. Hard not to know when it’s all anybody can talk about.” Sam shrugs, taking a bite of his apple. "They think it 'cause out of nowhere, you two disappear from the public eye for months, and when you come back, there's suddenly this new person who's there each and every time."
“Did you expect me to throw a fit about it?” Steve rolls his eyes good-naturedly, his voice flat when he says, “No, don’t leave, I don’t know how I’ll survive without you.”
Steve sighs, scrubbing a hand across his face. “My neighbour. Before Friday, all I’d ever see of him was him coming home late every night or when he was dumping trash into his recycle bin, which was always full of empty liquor bottles. Hell, we never talked until Friday, when he just showed up, told me to watch his kid and not kill him, and left. What kind of idiot trusts a complete stranger to watch his four-year-old?”
Clint is the first to laugh at Bruce's words, and the others join in. Their laughter is slightly hysterical, but Steve can't blame any of them for it. The show on the television plays on, ignored as the group gradually lets go of the tension.
JARVIS doesn’t say anything else, just gets the elevator rising. Tony’s fingers taps an unsteady beat against his thigh as the lift makes its way up, up, up; he nearly steps off when it stops until he sees that he’s only on the gym level and Natasha is standing just beyond the doors.
Steve looks up to see the nurse standing in the doorway to the room, her dark eyes gentle and full of compassion, and he can't let go. His fingers won't release Ma's hand. He can't. He hasn't held her hand in nearly thirteen years, not since he was ten, and he can't remember why he ever stopped. He can't recall when her hand started feeling so small in his, so frail and breakable, and he hates that he's let so many years go by without taking comfort in the feeling of her hand wrapping around his.
, for this opportunity to begin to making amends. I know nothing will ever repair what he has done, but… This may just be the start.”
“There’s no ‘special rule’. Just make sure the water’s not too hot – kids have more sensitive skin. Test the temperature with your wrist. Regular shampoo is fine for this one time, but if he’s going to be there a lot, ask his father for his own shampoo and body wash. Oh, and make sure you stay with him. You don’t want him to drown.”
Barely fifteen minutes have passed before he’s beckoned out into the centre of attention. He leans against the podium, staring at the faces of dozens of reporters and journalists, cameramen and security; a few of the ones who accosted Steve outside the tower yesterday are sitting amongst the rest, looking for all the world like they’ve done nothing wrong. Tony struggles against the urge to walk over and punch them in their damn faces. He doesn’t actually do it – yay for maturity and self-control! – but gods, does he want to. Instead, he waits patiently until the crowd is quiet before speaking.
Tony watches Steve’s shoulders slump under the redhead’s hand. She leans into his side, rests her head against his bicep.
“I’m sorry, but – Okay, let me explain before your head goes ahead and explodes, okay? When Barton brought Steve up to me yesterday, I… I’d never seen him that shaken. He was so pale and looked absolutely
“I wasn’t thinking clearly, obviously. Besides, I think J took over halfway through, maybe sooner. I know, it was stupid and reckless, and I’m swearing to you now that it’ll never happen again. I will never endanger my life like that unless I have to.” Tony shrugs. “Can’t promise I won’t do something crazy while saving the world, but outside of that, I won’t.”
Clint is perched on the island, watching Natasha cook (and most likely pestering her) when Steve enters the kitchen. Tony’s already left for SI, and Sam is finishing off a bowl of oatmeal. Bruce and Jane are at a convention of sorts – between the two of them excitedly rambling nonstop about it, Steve had gotten confused rather quickly, especially since neither of them were ever inclined to actually finish a sentence before starting a new one. Thor, Havardr, and Loki argue quietly in the living room.
“Please don't. I promise I will, eventually, but… I don't want her to worry about me, more than she already does, I mean, and I know if she finds out I'm Spiderman, she's going to freak out even more, and I kinda don't wanna have to deal with that unless it's absolutely necessary, I mean, she's going to ground me or something, and then I can't be Spiderman, and, oh god, I can't tell May!”
There's no response, which, that's not unexpected. Rhodey knows Tony, knows that Tony will deflect and the best way to stop that is to hang up without giving him a chance to actually argue the point. Tony lets his phone fall to the seat beside him and rest his head on the back of the couch.
Surprisingly, Clint was fantastic at being supportive the first time a pregnancy test came up negative. For as much as he complains about being uncomfortable with serious conversations or anything involving feelings, he was easily one of the first people to assure Steve that conception would happen, it was only the first try. So when the next test wasn't positive, Clint was the second to know; Natasha had waited in the penthouse bedroom while Steve stared at the stick, impatient for results, and she'd called for the archer once Steve emerged from the bathroom. The pair held him tightly until he'd stopped crying, reiterated that it would take time, and passed a message through JARVIS to Tony, requesting he come home immediately.
Another hours passes with more arguing, until Tony’s phone vibrates in his pocket. He ignores it in favour of attempting to sway the overseer’s decision, but he’s cut off by another bout of vibrating. He pulls his phone out and immediately feels his heart drop.
“At first. Use condoms at first. Wait until after your first menstrual cycle, then you can ditch them. Nobody’s sure how this magic thing works, so it’s best to be safe rather than sorry.”
At Tony’s gesture, his eyes amused, Steve launches into the story of the time he and Bucky had been in Melissa Wolmack’s apartment, ostensibly studying, but the only thing Bucky was studying was the taste of her mouth. Steve, though, he’d been trying so hard to prepare for the finals coming up the next week even through the weird moaning and heavy breathing not even three feet away. Then her parents had suddenly come home, her dad disappeared down the hall and came back with a baseball bat, and Steve hadn’t hesitated, just shoved his books haphazardly into his bag, gritted his teeth, and slipped through the window. Bucky, having followed closely behind in order to not have his head become the latest style of baseball, had landed on a pile of garbage bags, while Steve hadn’t had the same luck: He hit the lid of the dumpster then tumbled to the ground. The adrenaline had prevented him from noticing the excruciating pain emanating up his leg until they were at least three blocks away and his throat was nearly completely closed. Ma had been, quite understandably, furious as she drove him to the hospital once he’d used his inhaler and could breathe again. Steve hadn’t had a verbal tongue-lashing like that in a long time. He only regretted ever letting Bucky convince him that Melissa Wolmack was worth the risk of an overprotective former-Marine of a father; she really wasn’t.
“But why don't you wanna marry my daddy? Don't you love him? A'cuz I saw you and Daddy kissin’ last time I was here, and Mommy says if you kiss someone, that means you love 'em.”
Steve’s eyes snap open at the clatter of surgical equipment, and Mal gasps. The blade drops to the floor and goes unnoticed as she gapes in shock.
Tony slips out of bed slowly, gingerly. Between the pregnancy and yesterday’s events, Steve skipped dinner and fell asleep within minutes of lying down last night. Tony still hasn’t gotten a collect call from the local jail requesting bail money, so he’s made the decision to execute Plan B.
At Tony’s words, the bot whines and rolls away rapidly. Steve chuckles – and hearing his own laughter in a higher pitch is never going to be easier. A knock against the darkened glass walls of the workshop pulls everyone’s attention away from Dum-E.
he’s done, he’s nicked himself five times and left a couple small patches of hair. She asks if he wants to shave or trim the pubic hair; he choose trim, simply because he can’t fathom dealing with slicing the sensitive skin of his labia. It’s...uncomfortable, having Natasha’s face so close to his vagina, as she drags an electric trimmer across the coarse hairs. She talks quietly, explains the best way to do this, gives tips on how to get every crevice, recommends moisturisers. She doesn’t take long, moving away the second she’s finished, and Steve reaches down to feel the results. There are no stray curls where she’s trimmed or shaved him, just smooth skin.
Steve jerks backward and stares, blinking stupidly at DUM-E; he hadn’t known Tony had given the bot a speaking protocol. He turns rapidly when someone clears their throat from across the workshop. Tony stands there, looking like he’s fighting back laughter with his arms crossed over his chest. Steve can feel his cheeks burning hotly, and he studiously avoids Tony’s gaze, staring down at DUM-E’s support strut instead.
have me, okay? I'm not saying I'm gonna stop this, whatever this is, but my life outside of these dreams, when I'm awake? It's not… It's not what you deserve, trust me. I still can't believe you haven't recognised me yet,” adds Tony with a grimace. “You deserve a happy life without drama and trauma and the bullshit I deal with every day. My life isn't calm, it's a fucking circus on the best of days, and I want to keep you safe from that. Believe me.
Natasha is the first to notice the trio when they step out onto the back patio of Sam’s house. She hands her beer off to Clint before making her way across the yard; Peter's grip tightens on Steve's hand the closer she gets, and Steve squeezes back gently, smiling down at the child. Natasha crouches down until she's at his height.
He sits there in the deafening silence, holding onto Dum-E and staring around the workshop. Half-finished projects lay in piles of organised chaos on the tables, but all the tools are in their proper places, waiting to be used. A large pencil drawing is the only actual decoration; it’s one of Steve’s works, done shortly before he began dating Tony. It was a birthday present for the man who has nearly everything and can buy whatever he doesn’t. In the drawing, Tony and his bots are at the forefront, the centre of attention, working on an Iron Man suit. Natasha is to the left, sharpening knives with a small smile on her face while Sam reads
The kiss was mainly to shut Tony up, but like usual, Tony was able to take it in stride, able to quickly gain the advantage. He pushed against Steve's shoulder until Steve let himself fall backward onto the bed. It wasn't long before Tony pulled away to undress clumsily and light the candle (laughing so hard, he had difficulty keeping a match lit long enough to catch the wick). They shared an awkward kiss; both Steve and Tony kept stealing glances at the candle as it sat atop the dresser, flame trembling merrily. Steve blushed once more, and thankfully, Tony knew what to do to distract him from overthinking. Steve gasped and moaned and pleaded until Tony finally fitted himself between Steve's legs and pushed forward in one easy slide. Steve was too busy being overwhelmed by sensations to notice the awkward rhythm that Tony was keeping, but nothing could keep him from noticing when his partner stopped moving, fell forward onto his elbows, and laughed into the skin of Steve's neck.
The armour sets down gently on the landing pad, and Tony sighs blissfully as he steps out of it. The wind is brisk, but thankfully it’s a short walk into the penthouse. It’s been a long, boring,
. Steve smiles to himself, begins preparing the pancakes Clint loves so much. By the time the last one has been flipped onto an oven-safe dish to warm, the archer has surprisingly stumbled his way into the kitchen, poured himself a mug of coffee, and gulped it down; Steve is still impressed by Clint’s lack of wincing, even though his mouth and throat are more than likely scalded.
Natasha has freaked out since the other night; spending a couple of hours the next day, putting childproof locks on everything on the communal floor, helped alleviate her anxiety. She even sat in the workshop with Tony researching anything relevant to raising a baby. Steve and Sam had been shocked when she’d declined joining them for their weekly brunch, even more surprised when she’d followed Tony to the ’shop.
“If you’re talking about the panic attack that you are currently experiencing, then I suggest naming three things that you see. Captain?” JARVIS prompts when Steve hasn’t responded in a long moment.
He exhales unsteadily. They pass the vodka back and forth, not speaking as they dwell on their own fears. When the bottle is empty, Natasha pulls a new one from behind her. Tony doesn’t ask for the bottle, but she hands it back after every three swigs.
Steve damn near throws his phone at the wall when it beeps at 10:20 and Tony's name appears on the screen. Without his permission, his thumb swipes to unlock the device, and the message thread opens.
“He?” She paused just long enough that Steve starts to wonder if his ma has hung up. “Stevie, do you have a date with your neighbour?”
Steve glances up to see Tony leaning against the doorframe, and smiles softly. “Yeah, just give me a second.”
Tony's lips twitch, but he releases Steve's hand and pushes open his door. Steve follows suit, staying close to Tony as they cross the parking lot. His heart is racing in his chest, and he knows his palms are clammy, but he doesn't slow down. He's never been one to back away from any sort of challenge, and meeting his partner's ex who is also the mother of said partner's child? Definitely a challenge, even if no one says it is. If Pepper doesn't approve of Steve, she can always tell Tony, ask Tony to leave Steve or keep Steve away from Peter. Hell, she can always keep Peter away from his dad, if Tony decides he doesn't want to break up with Steve. He's not sure that she actually would, but the possibility is still there, and Steve can't stand the thought of not having Tony or Peter in his life any more.
Once the boots are on his feet, he steps back into his bedroom to shoo his friends out of his apartment before Tony shows up. Steve loves his friends, he really does, but he is well aware of their proclivity to be overwhelming. Thankfully, Natasha understands that he’s stressed and nervous, so she ushers the other three through the door and down the stairs. Steve knows that her mercy isn’t going to last long ー she’ll be the first to pounce on him in the morning for details, even before Bucky.
The notebook is laying right where it was in the dream, and this time, Steve doesn't thumb through it. He pockets it, heads to the floorboard he knows is hollow, and yanks up the covering. He's just gotten the backpack out and slid his arm through the strap when the sound of a shuffling footstep sounds behind him. He turns.
“I – Look, Steve, I needed an unbiased opinion. You’re dead-set on following through with this, and I, I get it. I get
“I’m so proud of you,” she whispers, her voice cracking, and he pulls back a bit to see she’s crying.
He gets fifteen minutes of relative quiet, punctuated with the sound of his footsteps on the floor, before a sharp knock sounds. Steve takes a steadying breath and crosses the room. It isn’t Tony, unfortunately, just 3C asking if he’s seen Nala around. Steve merely shakes his head, shrugs apologetically, and closes the door again. He checks the clock on his phone with every circuit of the room that he makes, watching the minutes tick upward, wishing time would go faster. Finally, he can hear the familiar sound of Tony’s shoes against the worn wood of the staircase. His phone vibrates in his hand, and he glances down at the device to see the screen lighting up with a text from Tony.
Bucky crows with laughter, doubling over as he loses his breath. Finally, he straightens and manages to say through his chuckles, “Was it worth it? 'Cause you know Coulson and everybody's gonna ask questions.”
appears at the bottom of the message box, disappearing and reappearing and disappearing again. Then, finally, Tony’s response comes through.
Loki sits back, drops his hands to his lap. Evidently, the cursory examination is complete. “Thor, do me a favour, and shut that oafish mouth of yours. How do you feel, Captain Rogers?”
And Steve knows they're only teenagers, but this is more real than any other friendship he's ever had, and he desperately wants more. He wants to be there with Tony, outside of shared dreams, he wants more than what they have right now. Ma’s always called him a dreamer, always says he falls headlong into any plan he sets his mind to, and damn the consequences. He hasn't had experience in life, not the kind kids on TV do: He's never drank, smoked, hasn't even had a first kiss yet. But he knows, with everything in him, that no matter who comes into his life while he's awake, they'll never hold a candle to Tony.
“You ask that a lot,” murmurs Steve, stretching slightly to catch Tony's mouth once more, their tongues dancing and tangling almost immediately. “Do you have to go?”
Steve is still here, off to the side, talking to… someone. Someone important, Tony guesses, judging by the way he's maintaining eye contact and hasn't taken a sip of champagne in over a minute. Natasha taught Steve that method ー take a sip of his drink anytime his conversation partner smiles or laughs, and they'll start to associate the happy feeling with Steve and they're more likely to give over money or do what Steve is asking of them. It's a simple con, but one that's worked for as long as humanity has had the desire to con for what they want. But the discussion Steve is having now is serious, and he's not going to try to diminish that seriousness with neuro-linguistic tricks.
“And… You’re okay with the insanity that is my life? Because you say that now, but you don’t see it firsthand, you don’t know exactly what you’re getting yourself into, and I won’t blame you if you want to back out and pretend this never happened.”
“They have made use of the guest quarters near my own. At the risk of being too forward, I allowed them passage the moment Clint drew his bow.”
“Yeah? Hopefully all good, except it's me, so it probably isn't all good, I'm not all good or, ya know, worthy of being called all good, so anyway, hope he hasn't said too much embarrassing stuff about me.”
“You just missed Tony,” interjects Steve, because the mischievous, manic grin on Clint’s face, quite frankly, scares him. “I could have JARVIS alert you whenever he gets back.”
will make you pay. Stop letting your issues and lack of self-confidence get in your way of good sense. You have a child to think about now.”
The boy ー Tony, he’d told Steve after the third time he’d appeared in Steve’s dreams, shyly and with more tears than Steve figured telling someone your name would require ー had shown up nearly every night after that. Sometimes, Tony would be sleepy, even in the dreams, and would request that Steve take them somewhere quiet so he could rest. And Steve didn’t question it. He never really questioned Tony. Other times, it had taken all of Steve’s stamina to keep up with Tony. Thankfully, in dreams, Steve didn’t have the breathing issues like he did when he was awake. He could run and jump and play without having to reach for his inhaler, though there were a few times he woke abruptly because his physical body was having an asthma attack thanks to the excitement of  his dreams. Those were the worst nights, followed by awkwardness when Tony would scoff at Steve and say
Beyond the surgeon-turned-sorcerer, Tony isn’t sure there’s anyone else, and he wouldn’t trust them if there is. Science itself, in all its incarnations, has very strict rules (until someone sets out to break the rules, but that’s irrelevant), but magic… Magic has no discernible patterns, and that’s what irritates Tony the most. Sure, he may use engineering to make life easier, better, and to cut back on the amount of actions needed to accomplish a task, but using magic just seems less than cheap, worthless.
The address listed is only a few blocks away from SHIELD. He idly wonders if Tony knows where he works before he dismisses that thought. Steve's never mentioned his job around Tony, so, unless Tony's done a background check on him, the location for lunch has to just be a coincidence. He taps his pen against his sketchpad as he thinks. Going to lunch with Tony would mean a chance to talk without the risk of someone shouting and making a scene, but it also means having to see the object of his anger in close quarters.
the suit,” Tony mutters; he vividly remembers Pepper’s reaction to the armour he built specifically for her.
“I don’t know, do I look like his damn babysitter?” A sigh, then: “Let’s just hurry up and do this already. You know she’s gonna be noticed missing soon if she hasn’t already.”
Tony bites down on Steve’s breasts, releasing once he’s sure a mark will form. It doesn’t matter that the mark will disappear before they’re done, he doesn’t care; it’ll last long enough. Steve shudders under Tony as his breath ghosts over bared skin. Tony shifts until he can move one hand. Steve’s breath comes in sharper pants as Tony slides a finger under the band of the thong. The texture of trimmed curls brings a smile to Tony’s face, and he stares up at Steve.
he’d set his DVR to record while he was out. He’d just started fleshing out the newest character in his latest comic when he had been interrupted by a frantic pounding on the door. He hadn’t expected to see the man from across the hall standing on the other side. It was even more of a surprise to see a little boy clinging to his hand.
“Obviously.” Steve sighs, sits on the couch. “Where is the rest of, of your mother’s court or whatever?”
There’s little fanfare when JARVIS announces the arrival or Thor in the conference room and requests that Steve makes his way there. It sounds so normal that he thinks nothing of it. It’s a common enough occurrence that he has absolutely no expectations of what he’s about to walk into. But even with the bar set to absolute zero, there’s no way he’d ever have anticipated the scene that greets him when he steps through the door:
The next month and a half passes much the same: At least once a week, Steve, Loki, and Tony share a meal in public, all sticking to the same script. The routine gets easier, less awkward, the more they follow it. Loki proves to be a great conversationalist, especially when it’s less
Peter barely turns his head enough to peer at Steve. Steve kneels down beside the couch and runs a hand over Peter’s curls, and the child’s eyelashes flutter at the contact. The clock on the wall ticks away the seconds in the silence of the room, but Steve doesn’t push Peter to talk. He’s learned over the last year that Peter will talk when he’s ready. Thankfully, he’s proven right when Peter takes a shuddering breath.
The circle of bright white-blue embedded in his chest nearly blinds Steve, but he keeps staring. It's beautiful, he tells Tony so. Tony explains that it's an electromagnet, an arc reactor, keeping shrapnel from the bomb out of his heart, keeping him alive.
“Of course he will. He loves you very much and would never, ever leave you behind. So… I have to ask. Who’s this super-cool pig you got here?”
“Tony, I know. Okay? I know Peter is always going to be your first priority, no matter what. I’ve been watching him for almost five months, and so I’m used to him being around. Not just in my life, but in yours, as well. I won’t ever resent you for your child coming before me. He needs his father. But, please, don’t say ‘no’ just because of that, because of him needing you and you needing to be there for him. If you’re not interested, that’s fine, I won’t push it. But you deserve to be happy, and I, I’d like to think I can make you happy.”
Steve turns away from the photograph he’s examining, away from the smiling faces of dad and son sharing a bowl of ice cream; he smiles slightly. “I’ll admit, I was a bit overwhelmed. Called my ma to freak out, and she laughed at me. But Peter and I, we figured it out. Like I said, he was good, just watched TV and drew until he fell asleep.”
“We’ll stay near, Steve.” Natasha glances at T'Challa. “You sure you can be here? I know Ross is desperate for everyone to believe Barnes did this, and if he finds out you're here on a rescue mission instead of for vengeance…”
“Easiest choice I’ve ever had to make. Sure, the process up to making the decision wasn’t so easy, but hey, whatever works.” Tony’s shoulder tightens, and a soft tapping noise fills the air. “Howard was pissed. When he saw my mark, I mean. I knew it had something to do with you ー I mean, how could I not, when I had a fucking shield on my wrist when everyone was aware of Captain America and his sacrifice ー but we knew you were dead, so it was just another way I’d somehow managed to fuck up without even trying. And lemme tell you, Howard made sure I was aware of how royally messed up I was. It was his favourite phrase: ‘You’re such a screw-up, fate let your soulmate die just so he’d never be stuck with you.’ Get in trouble at school or with the law, which was… far too often, I admit? I heard it. When he was drunk or in a foul mood because of some bullshit with the company or my existence? I heard it. And believe me, he was drunk a lot. It was the only way he could tolerate me, I guess. So yeah, I heard it a lot. And after a while, you start believing that shit. And…”
Steve hesitates, unsure of what he can say without making the situation worse. He’s shocked to hear his voice is steady when he speaks again: “If you don’t want children, that’s fine. But can we talk about why?”
work. But then Peter came along, and we both realised that we were less of a couple and more of...friends who happened to have a child together. We hadn’t had sex in nearly a year, since a couple weeks after we found out she was pregnant, and it just wasn’t working, but we tried so hard to pretend it was fine, that it wasn’t falling to pieces around us, and I don’t want to do that to you, Steve, I
Coulson sighs, dragging a hand over his face. He opens his mouth as if to say something, seems to think better of it, and simply walks away; Natasha follows. Steve waits until they’re gone before he faces Clint; Sam leans back in his chair, looking unruffled by the morning’s events.
“Oh, my God.” All thoughts of exhaustion gone, Tony sits up, keeping his hand firmly against the curve of Steve’s stomach. “She… Isn’t it too early for that, though? The baby books said you probably wouldn’t feel anything for a few weeks still.”
“I-I don’t know. I mean, I would be upset at the loss of possibility, but it wouldn’t make me love him less. It’s not something that would make me resent him or leave him. Just a couple days ago, we were on the same page. Neither of us were looking to get married - he has some ridiculous idea that me marrying him would be my worst mistake, and I’m not gonna push him into getting married if it’s not something he wants without being pressured. We’ve never discussed kids, and I’ve never really thought of them before because this job… It’s dangerous for
“I hate remembering it,” whispers Steve after ten minutes of quiet. “I hate knowing that he’s dead because I wasn’t fast enough. I should’ve worried more about him, should’ve reached out for him sooner.”
When Steve emerges from the bedroom, he’s changed into his pyjamas; he doesn’t look at Tony as he passes by him to the door.
“You can handle this. ‘S’easier than all those fights you got into as a child. Or, at the very least, less painful.”
pregnant even though it’s scientifically and medically impossible because hello, he doesn’t have any of the parts required to be a human incubator, so he thought we could – or rather,
“Because,” Peter drawls as he stares at Steve like he's dumb, “if you marry Daddy, you'll be my daddy, too, and I want you to be my daddy just like Daddy's my daddy, and if Mommy marries Mr Phil, then I'll have
“I didn’t know Pepper called you until after I came home. I remember standing in my office and feeling like I’d forgotten something important. JARVIS told me I’d missed the sonogram, and I kinda… zoned out, I guess, so he might’ve told me you’d been informed of the disaster, but I didn’t hear him. I originally intended on having only a couple drinks, just enough to calm down, then coming home and groveling until you forgave me. But the more I drank, the more I convinced myself you were going to break up with me, move out, and only allow me to see the baby on the weekends. Then I didn’t want to come home drunk, so I slept it off at Pepper’s.”
Steve hesitates then raises his free hand to brush away a stray lock of hair from Tony's eyes. Tony finally meets his gaze straight on. Steve tries to let Tony make the first move, but he can't, he's too impatient, so he leans in, slower than he'd have liked, telegraphing his movements in case Tony wants to stop this. But Tony's chin is tilting up, his head is cocking, and their lips are meeting in the middle, just a gentle brush, another, then harder, more insistent. Something in Steve's chest settles, grips tight and effuses warmth, and it isn't long before he's released Tony's hand to wrap one arm around the other man's waist. Tony tastes like coffee, wine, and some tropical fruit, and Steve chases that taste as his tongue presses against the seam of Tony's lips, dips into Tony's mouth. Tony gives just as good as he gets, his fingers twisting into Steve's hair as he pushes closer. Steve would usually be able to keep himself upright, but he finds his body has plans of its own; he lets himself fall backwards until the arm of the couch is digging mercilessly into his shoulders, Tony following close behind. The arm around Tony's waist tightens, holds him closer still, and he groans softly when Tony settles his thighs against Steve's waist. Steve drags a hand along Tony's side, his back, before it wraps around the back of Tony's neck, squeezes gently. Tony gasps into his mouth, hips jerking wildly, and Steve somehow manages to file that observation away somewhere in the back of his mind as he loses himself in the taste, the feel, of Tony.
“Seems to me like you’ve been payin’ attention, ‘s’all. Anway, why exactly did you not take his money? I mean, it’s what you do when you provide a service – you get paid. That’s kinda the whole point.”
“Of course.” Steve pauses. “Petey-bug, ya gotta get off me if you want me to get your berry cereal.”
“Have a dream that everything got fucked up, we all chose sides and fought against each other, and you and Barnes left me for dead in, where was it, Siberia or some place equally as frozen over?”
In the kitchen on the communal level are Natasha and Steve. He stands at the sink, washing dishes, and Nat is doing some sort of yoga pose on the island countertop. Tony watches as she folds herself nearly in half – he may have landed the epitome of perfection that is Captain America mixed with the stubborn, beautiful Brooklyn boy named Steve Rogers, but he can still appreciate such flexibility in another human being. Steve’s shoulders are shaking from obvious laughter. Tony calls out for audio.
When he finishes (and Natasha has eaten half of what was on his plate, so no one realised how little he
“Wonderful! My mother wished not to intrude, so she has asked me inquire as to whether you and Tony have come to decision.”
Without waiting for a reply, Steve turns and heads back down the hall. Peter instinctively curls into his chest once Steve has him cradled in his arms; Tony makes a weird little noise in the back of his throat, and Steve tears his gaze away from the sleeping child’s face to raise an eyebrow at the other man. Though his cheeks are tinged pink, Tony doesn’t say anything, just easily scoops up his son’s backpack and shoes, and exits the apartment. Steve follows closely behind, holding Peter just a little tighter so the overhead light in the hall doesn’t shine directly in his face. He places Peter in his bed a moment later, just like he did on Friday night, and lets Tony finish the routine. He leaves the Parkers’ apartment without saying goodnight.
“They’re clearing her nose and mouth now. See, she’s fine.” Tony glances away, staring at their now-screaming daughter. “Oh, darling, she’s beautiful. You did so well.”
It’s been a month since the news was broken, and Tony can’t go a day without hearing at least five things baby– or pregnancy-related. Natasha and Steve have gone shopping a handful of times, but she’s refused to give Tony any clue as to what they’ve bought. Tony doesn’t really mind – Steve’s over the moon, Nat’s not threatening to kill anyone (who doesn’t deserve it), and Tony’s been able to focus on work a little easier, so it’s all a win in his eyes.
Pepper smiles, a soft curl to her scarlet lips. “Well, whatever you’re doing with him, keep it up. He talks about you all the time. He absolutely loves you.”
Bucky just smiles knowingly the next morning when Steve finally gets to the office. Thankfully, he doesn't mention the fact that Steve is the last to arrive at nearly eight o'clock. He just hands over a mug of coffee, cuffs Steve gently on the shoulder, and ambles to the photography section. Steve knows he's blushing, he can feel how hot his cheeks are, and he studiously ignores everyone else in the room. It isn't so easy to do when his phone vibrates on his desk and he sees the screen lighting up with a text from Tony.
Once Tony stopped pacing the office, clutching his hair and alternating between panicking and being overjoyed at the news, Steve managed to sit him down so they could make a plan for what was to happen next. Tony had JARVIS hold his calls while they researched the most highly-recommended obstetricians; thirty-five minutes were spent arguing over which doctor was better – Carpenter, David, or Cavendish. Steve put an end to the discussion by kissing Tony goodbye and leaving before he lost control over his laughter. Thankfully, he and Tony are on the same page in regards to at least
? And I could just see, so clearly, him putting a stop to squabbles between a mini-him and a little blonde girl with pigtails. And I
Steve nods, because he understands. He may not have been by Tony’s side for as long as Pepper or Rhodey has, and he certainly wasn’t there during the Afghanistan ordeal, but he’s well-versed in the pitfalls of dating a genius who owns and creates world-changing products for one of the largest multinational companies on Earth. Tony has a mind that rarely stops; even in the middle of mind-blowing, toe-curling sex, Steve runs the risk of overhearing his partner mumbling random equations to himself. More than one dinner has been postponed due to an emergency at work or Tony having a breakthrough on a problematic design, and that’s not even counting the times the alarm went off and they had to suit up. Explaining to Fury why they were later than the rest of the Avengers the one and only time it happened had been awkward and embarrassing, and it was even worse hearing
, Steve growls ー and his hand burns with the need to touch Tony. He whimpers when the other man actually pulls away, but the sound cuts off with a strangled garble when Tony doesn’t waste time, just yanks off his T-shirt and then shoves his jeans to his ankles in one swift motion, leaving all of him on display. Steve takes in the sight before him hungrily, reaching for Tony when it becomes evident that looking isn’t going to be enough.
Steve fills two glasses with water from the tap and wonders how this became his life. He never expected, when he moved in, that his neighbour would be Tony Stark or that said neighbour would just let himself into Steve's apartment without permission. But Steve can't be too upset, not really, not when he's had the same feeling of the flat being too quiet without the presence of Peter. The paper pinned to the fridge catches his eye, and he stares silently at the red and blue stick figure ー SPIDERMAN written underneath in Peter's scrawling handwriting, the “R” and “N” backwards. A black blob with eight legs takes up residence in the corner. Peter had drawn it the last time he was over; he'd even come up with a backstory for the character, magnanimously giving Steve permission to display the drawing ー and even to use the character in any future comics. Steve's already gotten the issue nearly panelled out, set to be Peter's birthday gift.
Tony double-checks that the board members are paying attention to Pepper (or at least, pretending to pay attention) and types back a response.
Steve can feel his cheeks burning, but he focuses more on locating a pair of shoes that aren't nearly falling apart from wearing them constantly. He manages to find black hiking boots in the back of the guest room closet that have very little scuffs. He’d bought them last summer when everyone had made plans to go camping and hiking but never had; instead, he’s only worn them a couple of times, one of which was a photoshoot that Coulson had asked him to participate in and he’d needed something to take his mind off of his latest breakup. He can’t even remember now who that person had been, the relationship had meant so little in the end, but at the time, it’d hurt like Hell.
Furniture lines the walls, leaving a large empty space in the middle of the room. A thick blanket covers the carpeting; a couple of throw pillows rest on the floor next to the blanket. Dozens of candles flicker merrily on holoscreens that float in the air, not nearly as brightly-lit as usual, and Steve stares at the sight in front of him. Tony taps his fingers against the arc reactor casing, shrugs with an embarrassed flush to his cheeks.
Steve jolts, knocking over the jar of water he uses to clean the brushes, and curses as he turns to face his visitor. “Knock, next time!”
going to be able to do this?” She continues quietly, almost like she’s speaking to herself, “I have no idea how to do this. How am I going to juggle the schedules?” She stares at Tony with wide eyes. “I have to make sure you’re not gone too much, but there are a lot of important duties that you absolutely can
“Oh, well done! Well done, all of you. I was afraid that you would do nothing that needed to be done, but you
Tony catches Steve’s nipple between his teeth; the lace is nearly nonexistent, provides just enough roughness that he knows it feels good to Steve. “Yeah? What’d she teach you?”
Peter is at Steve’s side immediately, bouncing on his toes as he waits anxiously for his aunt to let them in. Thankfully, she does so as soon as Peter is ready; Steve ushers Peter in first then follows suit, coming to an abrupt stop at the sight of Pepper standing across the room as she checks her reflection in the full-length mirror. Tony is beside her and staring at her like he’s never seen anyone more radiant, and if Steve is being honest, he’s hard-pressed to come up with even one person who has ever looked as gorgeous and flawless as Peter’s mother does right now. The pink-gold colour of the dress complements her skin, accents the redness of her hair which has been pulled back into an elegant bun with locks of hair curled to frame her face; she runs her hands over the lace-covered bodice, smooths out the hem where lace meets chiffon.
Steve’s stomach churns. He’s seen enough movies and news coverage since he came out of the ice to know what’s going on. He’s barely made the decision to speak up when his shirt is pushed up, exposing his belly to the warm air, and cold gel is squirted onto his skin. The sound of a rapid heartbeat echoes in the otherwise quiet room, and he forces himself not to panic.
Dazedly, Tony waves a hand, and the screen disappears. He manages to sit unsteadily on his workbench, mind racing. Steve wants
“Shut up,” Steve snaps, voice cracking with tears. “I’ll worry if I damn well want to. You’re not funny, you know.”
“You know what I mean. How are things with you and Steve? I’m going to guess they’re going well if that goofy smile is any indication.”
Steve nods, wiping stray tears from his cheeks, rolling over to curl into Tony. “Thank you. I love you.”
The staircase creaks ominously as Steve makes his way up; a door opens to his left on the second floor, and a little girl stares at him, eyes wide and frightened. He smiles but doesn't stop. When he finally gets to the apartment on the top floor, it's empty. Newspaper covers the windows, blocking out any potential sightlines, and the wood under his feet is warped and sagging slightly.
Coulson stands, and that signals the end of the impromptu meeting. Ms Potts follows the SHIELD agent out of the kitchen, Clint and Natasha close behind. Wanda forces a smile before disappearing down the hall, the lingering, faint glimmer of pinkish-red sparks the only evidence that she'd even been there. Steve drops his head to his hands and closes his eyes.
Thor sighs, closes his eyes. Three deep breaths, and the clouds are breaking up, disappearing before their eyes. The slow roll of distant thunder still sounds, but Steve can't expect perfection. So he squeezes Thor's shoulder comfortingly and turns to face the others.
“Because I didn't want to admit that I was fucking jealous, okay? I didn't want to get my hopes up about anything, because guess what, it never really works for me, ever. I got my hopes up about Pepper, and look what happened. She walked out. I got my hopes up about the green energy initiative, and oh, I damn near died for it. I… I couldn't get my hopes up about you because it would kill me to have to lose whatever of you that I can get.” Tony swipes a hand across the surface of his workbench, sending tablets and mugs and various odds and ends to their demise on the floor; the sight of broken porcelain and glass and bits of metal isn't a comforting one, it's too close to symbolism for the way he's feeling, maelstrom of overwhelming emotions that he can't make sense of. “I didn't want you to see, to really look and see exactly what a mess I am, because I can't even be happy that you're in a relationship with someone who is actually good for you, because I am so damn far from that, it's way past 'not funny’ and now somewhere in the 'wow, this is fucked up how not funny this is’ territory.”
happy to see the man, but… he wishes it was Tony instead. Happy grins, as much as he ever had in the time Steve has known him.
“Were you guys planning on locking yourselves inside the entire time Steve’s pregnant? Because if you go out on a date with Steve any time in the next year, without a plan in place, you’ll cause the tabloids to go insane. The headlines will read ‘Iron Man Steps Out on Captain America’, and it will be big news for the foreseeable and unforeseeable future. And that’s not even including the arrival of the baby.” Pepper shrugs. “We have to think of a plan, a cover story, for the sudden appearance of a strange woman in your life.”
sorry, ya know,” whispers Tony, closing his eyes, and Steve reaches for his hand; the callouses and rough palms are achingly familiar.
He looks away to give her some semblance of privacy as she swipes at her eyes. The smile she gives him is small and watery, but it’s
“That’s good. I’m glad to hear it.” She lets her gaze drift from the charcoal sketch of Peggy. “We’re about to watch a movie. You in?”
Natasha leads him into the kitchen, getting to work immediately on filling a kettle with water and putting it on the stove. Steve sits in one of the chairs, stays silent while she works. Once the tea is ready, she places a cup in front of him, sets out a jar of jam, and lowers herself into the remaining seat.
“Steve,” whispers Tony; he swallows and lets himself fall into his chair. “How-how did you find me?”
It isn’t a question, not really, but Natasha nods solemnly and averts her gaze back to the HYDRA base. They stand together, silently surveying the destruction that Bucky left behind. Steve has a suspicion that catching up to Bucky won’t be as difficult as he previously thought ー it’ll be much harder. After a couple more minutes, Redwing exits the building among another small cloud of smoke, and Sam joins them. There’s nothing else they can do.
He offered her his arm, helped her to sit on a plush pillow at the head of table. He then poured her a cup of fragrant tea and handed her a china plate bearing a flaky pastry; even in the dim light of a dozen flickering candles, Steve can see it's clearly the most beautiful of the treats, perfectly golden and fluffy. Once everyone had a pastry and cup of tea, the group ate in silence, only speaking to ask for something to be passed. Eira cleared away the dishes, and Havardr placed the pork in the centre of the table and handed Steve a carving knife. Thankfully, Tony wrapped his hand over Steve’s around the handle and helped him to cut off a decent-sized chunk of meat. Frigga dipped her head in appreciation when the plate is set in front of her. Steve barely tasted what he ate, too nervous about the impending events.
The drive back home is quiet, but comfortably so. Steve still has a tight ball of tension in his gut that tells him he’s making the wrong decision; he ignores it in favour of making Natasha and Sam’s lives easier. Sam gets out of the car in front of his house in DC and pokes his head in through the open passenger window, giving Steve a reassuring smile.
“Five… bucks…?” Tony repeats in a disbelieving tone, blinking slowly, as if he isn’t sure he’s heard Steve correctly.
Steve stares down at the letter a moment longer before turning his gaze to the contents of the package. “1” is a navy blue dildo, thick and long and realistic; he forces himself to look away. The second is a vibrator with a cylindrical tip attached to the body with a piece of flexible rubber. An electrical cord is wrapped around the length of the wand. The last item is another dildo that is a vivid pink and slightly smaller than the first; this one has a suction-cup base. He’s terrified to even question it, but there’s a note beside it with clinical instructions written in Pepper’s neat hand, followed by Natasha’s “
He explains what he wants then spends the next five minutes convincing, begging, and bribing her not to tell Pepper. She isn’t too happy about it but gives in anyway with grace. He hangs up as soon as she’s promised – again – to keep it between the two of them; his shower is rushed, and he manages to shave in five minutes. He dresses quickly then checks on Steve. The blond is still sleeping, so Tony presses a soft kiss to his hair and quietly leaves the room. After recording a message for Steve to be played when he wakes up, Tony heads to the garage, gets in one of the more nondescript cars, and drives to the location had instructed him to. A staff member leads him through the halls into a large room where everything has already been set up. Tony makes a mental note to give his PR manager a raise for her efficiency.
The penthouse is silent and dark when Steve goes to bed that night. Tony is, according to JARVIS, on a conference call with a higher-up at an SI plant overseas and will be for some time. Steve brushes his teeth, changes into a pair of Iron Man pyjama pants (surprisingly a gift from Ms Potts for his birthday) and a T-shirt, and climbs into the large bed. With a sigh in the face of what’s looking like another night of sleeping alone, he reaches toward the nightstand and pulls out a thick, leather-bound notebook he’d seen in the window of a rundown bookstore last month. He flips to a clean page, puts pen to paper.
Once he's paid and has the bag of food in his hand, Steve walks back home quickly. Drops of rain have started falling sporadically by the time he turns the corner of his street, coming down more quickly as he reaches the door to the apartment building. He sets the food on the kitchen counter, goes to the bathroom to run a towel over his hair, and changes swiftly into a pair of worn-in sweats and a t-shirt stained with paint splatters. He grabs his sketchbook off the dresser, opens it to a blank page, getting to work.
“I'll, uh, I'll call you tomorrow, okay? I promise it won't be ages before we do the whole date thing.”
“You haven’t had a drop of alcohol in nearly a year. And you’ve stopped spending weeks at a time in the workshop. You keep slightly more regular hours, sleep at least four hours a night, and spend an average of three evenings a week with the team and five with me. Yes, there are times that I have to pull you from Engineering Land, but I knew that would be an occurrence getting into this relationship, and it happens a lot less frequently than I thought. I don’t mind having to do it. I love watching you work, interacting with the bots. You’re more
Steve starts, glancing around at the other diners; nobody pays any attention to them. “Uh, yeah, he did.”
Steve meets Tony in the middle of the hallway, pulling him off to the side so that Peter doesn’t see them, and kisses him gently. “Hi. I’ve missed you.”
Over the next two weeks, Peter becomes a regular fixture in Steve's apartment. Steve finds his shelves filling quickly with kids’ movies and books, his TV consistently set to cartoons (he learned quickly which channels play Peter's favourite shows), and his cupboards and fridge stocked with healthy snacks and drinks. It doesn't feel as weird as he expected it to. There are still a few nights that Peter falls asleep on the couch, but Steve has gotten better at making sure the kid is in his own bed before it happens most of the time. The first night he'd tucked Peter into bed, the child had stared up at him expectantly, leaving Steve floundering to figure out what he wanted.
Thor exits the workshop after a few minutes, leaving Tony with the promise of searching for an answer, and the genius stares at a circuit board without actually seeing it. He feels like a weight has been halved, but now that he’s sent the god back to his realm to find a way of making Steve’s dream of being pregnant a reality, it sinks in heavily that this could really be happening.
Thing change even more a couple of weeks after that conversation in the diner. It’s just after ten a.m., and Steve is engrossed in the art for his newest comic
“Well, it's not that hard when you have a few hours to kill, and when the person you're trying to find has a direct sightline to the Baxter Building. This place is the only one tall enough, on this side anyway, to see that much of the building. So, I looked at Google satellite to see what buildings were in a two-mile radius and were taller than the average building. Yours was the only one that fit both criteria.”
“Oh. Okay. I'm so sorry,” he says to Happy, his cheeks suddenly hot. “I just… Oh, god, I'm so, so, so sorry.”
Steve sighs, scrubs a hand over his face. “Yeah, they did. Clint damn near shot him in the face, and I thought Nat would stab him if Thor hadn’t been there.”
Once the roles are handed out, Clint and Natasha slip from the room almost immediately, and Thor strides heavily toward the elevator to get to the landing pad. A lightning strike flashes, thunder cracks, and he's gone, leaving behind the fading brilliance of a rainbow. Bruce silently leaves, most likely heading for his lab. Tony gives Steve a tight-lipped smile and tugs Rhodes through the doorway. Sam raises an eyebrow.
, jesus, kid, what the Hell is wrong with you.” Tony breathes deeply, scrubbing a hand over his face. “No, no one is getting killed, Steve, help me please, I don't know how to even…”
. Steve has never heard Tony’s voice so cold, even tinny as it is. He manages to fight the drugs enough to turn his head, and he stares at the gleaming suit of armour. Tony has both hands up, repulsors aimed at each of Steve’s captors. Loud bootsteps echo down the stairwell as a large group of black-clad agents storm into the room. Natasha’s first to appear; she looks absolutely murderous, and her guns are steady in her hands. She lets the SHIELD agents pass her to snap cuffs around Don and Mal’s wrists. Once they’re taken away, Nat rushes to Steve’s side. Her fingers tremble as she places them against his neck. Steve can feel the sedative wearing off, replaced by a tightening in his belly. He gasps and reaches for her hand. Clint enters the basement and grimaces.
She laughs then, gathering up her files. “I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about. But speaking of faces, I’m sure I can figure out the reason for yours.”
“I don't think so, but I've also known them for years, and I regret every single interaction I have with 'em.”
“No– nothing is wrong with him, he's fine. He's asleep right now, well, he’s sick, but I promise he's fine.”
of her heels is familiar; he can’t help but smile. He quickly hides the grin before she appears in the doorway. She’s carrying a stack of folders and a tablet in one hand, her phone and a dry-cleaning bag in the other. They do the hand-off of items just like they used to, and she reaches up to press the button on her bluetooth device. He kisses her cheek gently, waits for her to speak.
Now, after hours of trying to figure out what to do with Rhodey as a sounding board, Tony is still as confused as before. His best friend had been no help (“I don’t like the fact this requires that psychotic asshole, but Tones, you wanna make Steve happy more than anything, which means nothing I say is gonna make a damn bit of difference”); sure, he should talk to Steve about this, as Rhodey was so kind to point out, but when Steve is involved, Tony isn’t logical. Pepper may be right: Tony tends to fixate on the object of his desires. She claims that, with all of his abandonment and daddy issues, he’s a therapist’s wet dream. He knows the description is accurate – for the most part.
Tony stares from across the room, the edge of the bar digging into his side; he watches the way the woman's hand slips lower on Steve's back, brushing against the perfect swell of his ass, as he raises the champagne flute in response to whatever the Army general is saying. Laughs are shared, and the woman's hand presses tighter into Steve's skin. Her rings glimmer under the fancy lighting, stones large enough to do some damage if she were to throw a punch. Not that Tony really expects her to. This is a high-profile, expensive charity gala for ー well, for whatever organisation the Maria Stark Foundation decided on. Tony isn't necessarily sure, but he can't find it in him to care. Not when Steve isn't blushing a bright red at the woman's touches. Not when Tony's entire brain is focused on that small hand on a broad back, only mere inches from the most perfect ass Tony has ever seen, and
method. This is mine, and this is your only warning: If you feel the need to verbally attack or harass anyone in my life - be it my employees, my friends, or my family - you will
Steve snorts and buries his face against Tony’s shoulder. “Oh, yes, gotta marry for that excellent dental.”
Thirty seconds later, his phone vibrates and Tony's smile fills the screen. Steve swipes to answer the call, pressing the phone to his ear.
Nobody bothers to dignify that with a response. Instead, Bucky gets to his feet with one last gentle squeeze to Clint's ankle, and Steve follows behind as they make their way to his bedroom. Natasha slips past Steve, heading straight for his closet. Steve barely resists sighing at the clatter of hangers on the rod; he knows not to question her actions or methods ー she usually has his best interests in his mind. So he stands back, lets her do what she’s going to do. When she emerges from the closet, she has a pair of dark jeans and a maroon Henley, one he knows is tighter than it really needs to be, in hand. He takes it from her, grabs a pair of boxer-briefs and a white a-shirt from the dresser, and makes his way back to the bathroom to dress quickly. Clint lets out a low whistle upon Steve’s exit.
Steve sighs and rubs a hand over his belly. The baby has been much more active lately; he’s even felt a few kicks to his ribs. Doctor Cavendish had only smiled and warned him to get used to it, as it would become more and more difficult for the baby to move as freely over the next twelve weeks. Eira sits to his right, crocheting happily. Havardr is in the lab with Bruce, and the rest of the mismatched family that Steve loves is at a charity event.
The cityscape gives way to long roads lined with trees and fields, and the air that comes in through the open window changes, becomes fresher. He pulls over to the side of the road and puts on his hazard lights, inhales deeply. His lower back aches from driving for so long, but the crispness underlying the heat in the air, promising an early start to autumn, helps take his mind off of it. He steps out of the vehicle and stretches out his bunched-up muscles as he wades through the kneehigh grass; it's only been a handful of hours since he left the tower, but he's certain no one is coming after him. He sighs and lets his fingers drag over the tips of the grass, listens to the birds singing and the buzzing drone of cicadas in their trees. He keeps walking, getting further from the truck. This feels...right. Unfamiliar, but right. It reminds him a lot of the trip he took after the encounter with the Chitauri, though then, he hadn't made unscheduled stops along the side of the road: he'd travelled for hours during the day, stopped only as night was falling, and rose early every morning to get on the road again before traffic picked up.
Tony closes his eyes, his face twisting into a pained expression. When he turns to fully face Steve, it’s to glare at the blond and mouth “Get out.” Steve does so, gladly, but he makes sure to drop the money onto the table by the door first. It takes a lot of willpower to not slam the door on his way out, but he manages it; he doesn’t want to upset Peter any further. Bucky is leaning against the fridge by the time Steve gets back to his own apartment.
Natasha pulls open her door before Steve can even knock. She gestures him inside; he follows her through the living room and into her bedroom. The large bed is covered in shopping bags and clothing boxes; a tall mirror leans against the wall by the closet door. She gives him a mischievous smile before ordering him to strip. When he balks at the command, Natasha rolls her eyes, reminding him that they now have the same body parts. This doesn’t assure him as much as he thinks she’s hoping, but he doesn’t say anything, just does as instructed. She rifles through the bags, and Steve takes advantage of her distraction and checks out his reflection in the mirror.
A week later, Steve went down to the workshop to suggest upgrades for his suit and saw the picture hanging on the wall. He didn’t ask, and Tony didn’t tell, but Steve still hasn’t forgotten the rush of pride that came with seeing his art hanging on the workshop’s empty walls.
“Loki is a rather skilled fighter. My mother’s court may have some training in physical combat, enough to allow them the chance for survival against a foe, but it is nowhere near the level Loki has received as a prince. He learns quickly and, once he focuses, he is quite a proficient tactician. With training, he shall improve enough that our adversaries will not know that you are not the one on the battlefield.”
Pepper kisses Steve's cheek, wipes away the lipstick print, and murmurs, “Thank you for taking care of my boys. And Steve? Make sure you keep reminding Tony that you love him. He tends to believe he's unlovable no matter how much we say otherwise.”
“Neither can I. We'll all figure something out, Steve, don't worry.” He hesitates. “I better get back. Skye should be done with the makeup by now, but, uh, make sure you check your mail today.”
Steve laughs and swipes at Tony; the gesture is meant to be playful, but it changes as soon as his fingers brush across the bare skin of Tony's arm, warm and solid under the touch. “You don't need coffee, Tony, you're wired up enough as it is.”
I wanted kids, I would be the worst person to have them with.” Tony keeps his gaze on the ceiling, even as he continues dashing Steve’s hopes. “I’m not interested in having children. I don’t have the time or inclination to do so. Sorry.”
“I’m sure JARVIS can arrange that. Seriously, though, you guys are gonna be fine. Nat, you’re an expert at adapting to new situations and making the appropriate choices, and
Clint puts on an innocent expression, turns wide eyes in Phil’s direction. “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about, Sir.”
Nobody speaks as they walk off the Quinjet and into the penthouse living room. Coulson and Ms Potts are already there, sitting on the couch and staring at something on the table in front of them.
just a tool used by someone else. A tool has no emotions, no preferences, no thoughts of their own. A tool wouldn’t have been able to walk away from all they’d known. But you did. You’re not the spy assassin for them any more. You’re a damn good spy for SHIELD, a badass Avenger, and the best aunt an unborn baby could ever dream of having.”
Tony scoffs, rolls his eyes. “Calm down, we know. We wanted to have a face-to-face with you, get your opinion about joining the Avengers.”
“I know. I…I tried calling you, but JARVIS told me you were unavailable, and when I asked what had you so busy, he wouldn’t tell me. Guess it never occurred to me that it was actual business, not you drinking to drown your regret.”
“I shall belay the order until you two have come to an agreement as to whether I should or should not.”
"It has come to my attention that some of your fellows decided to camp out in front of my residence, wait in the blistering cold for possibly hours, and pretty much assault three women who are very dear to me. A couple of you are even in this room right now! Yes, Jack, I'm talking about you and Leon, and you, too, Price. Now, normally, I'd kick assholes like you out, but this is something you definitely need to hear.
“Petey here got a little throw-up on himself earlier, so we changed his clothes. He's kept down a little bit of water, which is good. He should be able to take another sip by the time he gets home. If you go to the main office, you can sign him out there.” She kneels down to be on Peter's level. “Hope you feel better, kiddo. Remember, plenty of rest and cuddles with Piggly will help you, okay?”
Peter nods slowly, tucking his head tighter under Steve's chin. They sit in silence for a while. Finally, the child pushes away and goes to grab his schoolbag; Steve watches as he dumps out his workbooks and shoves a sketchbook, paperback reading book, and his box of colouring supplies into the bag before heading to the door to pull his shoes on.
“And mighty dishevelled,” adds Natasha from where she's sitting on the edge of Steve's desk. “Bucky said you were getting a ride to work. Didn't know he meant a ride
. If anything, it was probably the biggest cause of their immediate rift.  Steve doesn’t find out until much later what kind of father Howard turned out to be, but it doesn’t matter. The damage is done. Tony hates him, and Steve… Steve accepts it. After all, he’s lost a helluva lot more than one man’s approval.
The visits come less often now. Steve has noticed that, as they grow older, they have more control over when they meet, where they meet, and for how long. Instead of coming together every night once they’re asleep, Tony starts showing up every other night, and he leaves far sooner than Steve wants him to. He wants to beg Tony to stay, but he knows that Tony has a life outside of their dreams, so he keeps his words behind his teeth and tries to enjoy the little time they have.
It’s a stretch of deep navy, almost black, speckled with stars toward the top. A big moon hovers above the fourteen Disney-style people – every member of their family from the Avengers to Pepper, Rhodey and Coulson, Eira and Havardr, Frigga and even Loki; a blank space glares from its place between the art versions of Steve and Loki, and he doesn’t even need to read the word
“I think I'm gonna have fun with you,” he whispers before pressing a soft kiss to the corner of Steve's mouth.
funny – there are a lot of people who agree with the anti-LGBT+ stance – but it never fails to amuse him when his past antics are used as a weapon against him. He’s had far too many years to accept the mistakes he made in his personal life and the consequences caused, and besides, all the parties, booze and cocaine, random one-night stands… They all led to him being in the best relationship of his entire life, with a baby on the way. So he can’t find it in himself to regret those years too much.
Steve listens as Tony explains about the medical technology he’s trying to advance, tools that can be used for search-and-rescue missions, and various other devices to make life easier for so many people. Steve points to one of the screens.
“This isn’t working,” he announces after the trio has eaten and are preparing to head out. Natasha gives him a long, measuring look, and Sam glances at Steve, down at his bag, and back at Steve. Steve sighs. “We’re always ten steps behind, and you two don’t deserve to be dragged all over the continent like this.”
“I will. I really don't wanna go. Home tonight, I mean, but if I stay, there's no way I'd be able to get up in the morning.”
Steve isn’t sure what he had been expecting, but there is very little fanfare as they come to an agreement of acting like couples in front of Peter. Phil is the one who comes up with the stipulation that during one parent’s time with Peter, significant others cannot spend the night. His reasoning makes sense: That’s far too much to be lumping on the child, especially immediately after informing him of the relationship changes. Pepper smiles at the three men sitting at the table.
“Evidently, there are some kids who are teasing him for having three dads. So is it okay if I let him stay home today, and then we can go in tomorrow to talk to the principal?”
Thor’s brows drew together at Tony’s words, and he exchanged a look with Loki. “It could possibly mean that the problem lies within the bodies, not the magic. That is why our mother should be involved. She will be able to discern the reason and find a way to fix whatever may be wrong.”
Tony shakes his head vehemently. “No, no, just...wasn't expecting you, that's all. Here, I mean. Wasn't expecting you here. How'd you get here? We've never had this place before.”
“So far, there haven’t been any leads, no eyewitnesses. But you, ma’am, are the last person he was in contact with, who would have had any reason to attack him. Can you tell us where you were between midnight and one o’clock this morning?”
Peter makes a face but silently swallows the cherry-flavoured syrup when Steve wakes him up ten minutes later. He swallows down a small mouthful of water, immediately plopping back down on the couch. Steve brushes a hand over his hair, reaches for the remote. The theme song for
“I still say you could walk into a meeting in a trash bag and still be able to scare the shit out of the idiots on the board,” remarks Tony, causing both Pepper and Steve to startle. “And you, my beautiful blond love, look fantastic. What’s the occasion?”
Steve sits gently beside Peter. “Well, if your daddy had an emergency, it means he probably didn’t have time to call your mommy. He put together your bag really fast, right? Which means he was in a rush. I’m closer, so he brought you here because he had to take care of the emergency and couldn’t wait until your mom got here to do so.”
Three nights later, Tony emerges from the workshop after a very unproductive couple of hours. A hand latches onto his arm the moment he steps into the corridor; Natasha smiles wickedly at him, and he sighs, resigning himself to be pulled into whatever scheme he’s planning. Refusing to follow along with what she wants always ends poorly.
, because where you are is, it's home for me. I ain't got much, not since Ma died, but I thought I had you.”
“Babysitting the kid again. His school called me 'cause he was sick, which is why I stole your car yesterday, and then a family friend picked him up around six-thirty or so, but I kept wakin’ up last night, thinkin’ he was still there and freakin’ out 'cause I couldn't hear him.”
Tony gives the room another long look then turns away from the dim shadows. When the elevator stops, he hesitates, just a breath’s length, but steps off the lift anyway. He stops in the doorway to the gym, watches as Steve pummels a heavy bag over and over. His shirt clings to his skin, emphasising the ripples of his muscles as he jabs, crosses, right hooks. The sound of fists meeting canvas echoes eerily in the large space; the slick shine to his skin is the only sign that he’s exerting any amount of energy. Tony stays silent, leans against the wall, and waits.
"You..." Tony bursts into laughter, his head dropping into his hands. "You are so ridiculous. Oh, my God, I included the tip when I paid, wow, I wasn't expecting that. Okay, I'm sorry. I really did not expect the secret to be a damn tip."
“Of course you can. You’re still you inside, where it counts. The packaging’s just different, is all. Don’t worry. Tony knows it’s you, he’ll love no matter what form you’re in.”
“So it’s been an hour, and, really, I should be commended for the fact that I haven’t blown up your phone in my panic, because Steve? I’m panicking really fucking bad right now. Just… please call me? I really, really don’t want to have fucked this all up. Please tell me this isn’t over.”
“Uh, actually, Peter did. He drew me a picture when I was watching him, and it was Spiderman, and he said I could use it for my comics, which is why Spiderman’s other identity is Peter Parker.”
“I’m sure they’re glad it’s over, too. I mean, they’re married now, and they get to go on a vacation and just be by themselves for an entire two weeks. No Pepper having to put out your fires, no Pepper having to wrangle you into a board meeting, no ー”
His fingers shaking, Steve slides the lock out of its place, pulls the door open slowly, and hesitatingly glances at the device. Tony's face is on the screen, tired and pinched with tension, but his eyes hold a glimmer of humour.
Pepper sighs, thumbs pressing circles into her forehead. “I can’t argue with your reasoning, but please explain why you didn’t give me a heads up?”
“As long as we have Big and Blond over there, we’ll be fine. Hell, you can still help with strategy alongside Coulson. You may not be fighting with us, but you’ll still be useful.”
“Nothing. What was I gonna do, leave Peter without someone to watch over him? It’s not a problem, I promise.”
Steve heads to his bedroom without another word. It takes less than thirty seconds to find and grab what he’s looking for. Back out in the living room, he crouches down next to the crouch and holds out the navy blue stuffed dog, ratty with age and decades of love. Peter’s eyes light up, and he runs a finger delicately over the line of stitches where the dog’s ear used to be.
He rarely sleeps. His nights are constantly interrupted by haunting memories and phantasms of his past. Too many times, Steve startles out of nightmares of being back in the ice, but this time, he is able to watch from afar as life passes him by once more, the faces of those he’s let down digging their fingers into his skin and blaming him for their deaths, of witnessing Red Skull tearing his flesh from his own face and revealing bone the colour of blood and rage and fire. He wakes each time shivering, curled into a tight ball, as his heart races in his chest; the blankets he covers up with do little in the way of making him actually
Steve breathes out a sigh of relief. “Yeah, neither did I. Funny what only having one thing in common can do to a couple of people.”
Tony freezes with a strand of Steve’s hair twirled around his finger. His dark eyes are wide, flick over Steve’s face. “You’re sure?”
Tony’s cock is already hard, drooling precome onto the bed, but Steve begging has always pushed him so close to the edge, and the fact that Steve’s voice is higher in pitch does nothing to change that. Without another word, he sets to work, licking and sucking at Steve’s slick folds through the lace, soaking the thong with spit and juices. Steve cries out; his fingers twist in Tony’s hair, pulling his face even nearer. The thong starts getting in his way, so he pulls back far enough to yank it down Steve’s legs. The moment it’s on the floor, he buries his face against the dripping cunt and thrusts his tongue inside. Steve’s gasps turn into rough moans as Tony nips gently at his folds, sucking Steve’s clit between his teeth, tugging just enough to draw a fragile yelp from Steve. He focuses his attention on the nub, pushes one finger, then two, into Steve’s tight channel. It isn’t long before Steve starts grinding down against Tony’s mouth, onto Tony’s fingers; the blond is damn near sobbing as his thighs tremble around Tony’s head, hips jerking in time with the flexes of the digits buried inside of him. With a high, near-wailing sound, Steve orgasms, and Tony swallows all the fluids he can catch with his tongue. His lover whimpers and tries to twist away; Tony removes his fingers from Steve, sucking the sweet wetness from them. He gives one last slow lick to Steve’s spasming pussy, causing his lover to whine, and crawls up the bed to share a sloppy kiss with him.
They have just rounded the corner, the last turn before reaching the tower, when Pepper abruptly stops.
He tries to write letters to Tony ー either to say he regrets how their first interactions went or to tell the man how utterly lost he is now, seventy years out of his time, Steve isn’t really sure, but each word ends up drenched in pain and heartbreak, and his wastebasket is overflowing with crumpled balls of paper before he gives up.
The CEO picks up on the second ring, but Tony stays silent. It’s as if the ability to speak is suddenly beyond his capabilities.
“Thanks, J,” Tony responds, smiling, as he undoes his cufflinks with a flick of deft fingers. “Any problems while Daddy was gone?”
“Youーyou weren't supposed to call, Sourpatch, texting is fine, it's what all the kids are doing these days, why are you calling?”
“Because even if this isn't a date, you two need to eat something, and chicken soup should be easy enough on his belly. Plus… I'm a selfish guy who wanted to spend time with you. Both of you.”
He falls asleep on Bucky's sofa after a night out at the bar with friends. He knows he probably shouldn't, is aware that Tony won't be there like he's not been there for too long, but he can't help it. He finds that room, the one he'd held Tony in as the other cried when they were kids, and he waits. He sprawls across the bed, still as large and empty as it had been back then even with two kids in it, and prays desperately for Tony to arrive.
“We’ve been trying to find a way of making it possible. He wasn’t really happy that I even wanted a…it with him, but he’s come around to the idea. So we’ve spent a lot of free time looking for answers.”
His eyelids flutter open; he blinks a couple of times, and his vision slowly clears. Loki is closest, his hands now running along Steve’s arms, pale eyes tight in concentration. Immediately behind the dark-haired demigod are Tony and the members of Frigga’s court. Thor stands at the back of the group with his arms crossed over his broad chest. When his gaze meets Steve’s, he grins widely.
Peter smiles brightly and continues petting Blue. The obvious adoration in his eyes makes Steve’s next decision an easy one. He tucks Blue in next to Piggly and grins at the young child.
“How am I supposed to know your reasons? I’m not Pepper or Rhodey or JARVIS. Maybe it’s because you suddenly changed your mind about having a child!”
“Your boy is such a cutie,” the lady behind the melons says, smiling brightly up at Peter. “You havin’ fun up there, buddy?”
He doesn’t reply to Tony, instead rolling over and climbing off the bed. His legs tremble slightly but are steady enough to carry him to the bathroom where he wets a washcloth. Tony hasn’t moved except to throw an arm over his eyes by the time Steve comes back. He wipes Tony’s abdomen and groin clean of drying come. Not bothering to waste more energy, he tosses the rag onto the nightstand and curls around Tony’s body.
Steve dips his chin and stretches out a hand, watches as his fingers slowly stop shaking of their own accord and move with his permission. His chest feels slightly less tight with each movement, and he eventually gasps one last time, drags in a deep, unsteady breath. Only the chirping of insects breaks up the silence as Steve feels his heart rate slowing and his muscles loosening. He scrubs a hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears, and he lets out a heavy exhale, tremulous and harsh.
Tony sighs, nods, and slumps back down. Steve resumes the soft stroking against Tony’s back without speaking. He’s just gotten what he wants, but the victory is bittersweet, dampened by the knowledge that Tony Stark, the greatest genius this world will ever know, doubts that he’s good enough to be in a relationship with Steve, let alone be a dad.
He barely sees when Tony holds the door open, beckons him inside, or when the maître d’ greets them. It's only because of Tony's hand on his lower back that Steve even moves in the right direction; the warm pressure through his shirts is reassuring, comforting, and his breathing slowly becomes less restricted. Steve smiles at Tony, a small thing, but Tony understands, his fingers pressing slightly harder in response. Steve turns back toward the table that they're guided to and immediately bursts out into surprised laughter.
“Ste-Steve. Things were fine, hell, they were great, then last night, I dunno, I just want to punch him in his perfect teeth.”
“Today has been incredibly long,” announces Tony with a long, low groan. “I love Pepper, I really do, and Hell, I even like Phil, but I am so glad that it’s over.”
Monday drags on. The music and humming that usually can be heard under the layers of voices, doesn't sound for most of the day. Steve loses the thread of conversations easily, often saying the same thing once or twice or asking someone to repeat what they've already said. He can't focus on
Steve winces as another kick lands solidly against his ribs. Sam pats his shoulder sympathetically and guides him to sit in a chair. With a promise to be quick, he hurries inside the cafe, leaving Steve to soak up the sun alone.
Steve's thirty-one and still unattached to anyone in his waking life, because Tony is it for him, he's known that since he was ten, but that doesn't stop Bucky and Sam from trying to set him up with other people. Sharon was wonderful, funny and damn brilliant, and if he wasn't so hung  up on Tony, he could see something happening with her, but there was nothing there, not on Steve's end. She deserves more than what Steve could give her, anyway.
But Tony’s already hung up. Steve huffs out a laugh, drops his phone to his desk. It beeps seconds later; the message has only a name and address. He has less than an hour before school lets out. Gathering up the little work he’s done, he tucks the papers into their folder, sliding it into his bag; he shuts down his computer, drapes the bag’s strap over his shoulder, and heads toward the exit. He can already hear the others whispering to each other as he pulls the door closed behind him.
“You tried paying me a thousand dollars for two nights. That’s, that’s too much, Tony. I’ll accept payment, I guess, but not a grand.”
can afford all of this in one go is Pepper freaking Potts and Tony freaking Stark. You. Are friends. With Tony Stark.”
“So, who's Bucky? I know you've known him since childhood, I get that, having friends for that long is great, but…”
Don stabs Steve’s arm with the needle, depresses the plunger, and Steve inhales sharply as the effects of the medication rush through his body. His vision blurs, and his body suddenly feels too heavy. Mal rushes to tear a new scalpel from its packaging. Steve screams but no sound comes out; the scalpel drags across his skin, leaving a trail of fire in its wake, and tears slip from the corners of his eyes.
The dream ends too abruptly. Steve bites back a scream of frustration when he realises it's because he's woken up. Tony had been there, Tony was within reach, and Steve's excitement and relief had been strong enough to jerk him awake. He scrubs a hand over his face, rolls onto his side, and tries desperately to get back to Tony. But Tony's gone again, nowhere to be found in any of their shared spaces.
Natasha shrugs at Eira’s vehement statement. “I agree, but… It’s bad enough that I lost my temper like that on national television. If I’d allowed myself to do worse, I’d be in the Raft by now.”
“It’s… It’s okay, Tony. I understand. I mean, it sucks, because I miss you, but this is your job. You can’t just walk away from it.”
The entire communal living room has been redecorated: A long buffet table is pushed against one wall, and the couches and chairs have been arranged into a large square. The bar is dotted with buckets, bottles tucked into beds of ice. An enormous banner hangs from the ceiling;
, and he pulls the door open. The wall directly across the entry is plastered with dozens of drawings; he gives them a cursory look before turning toward the office. A slim brunette sits behind the large desk, and Steve feels like he’s getting an X-ray as she looks him over. His smile in response is shaky, but he still steps up to the desk.
Steve can feel the pressure of Nat’s fingers on his arm, but he’s too busy fighting off the nausea as more and more questions are shouted; a camera is pushed in his face, and he ducks his head to avoid being filmed with tears in his eyes. He follows Natasha blindly, only the tight grasp and tugging keeping him upright. Pepper’s voice is cold, hard, as she says something Steve can’t make out over the ringing in his ears. The sound of the reporters fades, becomes muffled, but Steve can still hear them. Natasha’s delicate hand disappears from his arm only to be replaced by a solid weight along his shoulders.
He's just stepping out of the shower when he hears the front door bang shut. He recognises the footsteps across the floor, rolling his eyes but infinitely thankful that Bucky knows Steve is a wreck right now. He's less thankful when he walks out of the bathroom with only a towel around his waist to see Bucky and Sam sprawled on the sofa together, Clint perched on the arm with his feet in Bucky's lap, and Natasha rummaging through the fridge. She backs away with a bag of grapes in hand, and Steve sighs and makes a mental note to buy more in case Peter comes over any time soon.
“Hey, babe.” Tony rounds the desk to kiss Steve, sweet and chaste and full of love. “Not that I’m not glad to see you, because I really am, especially since you’re wearing one of my shirts – you look amazing in it, by the way – but I have a meeting.
“I have half a mind to get in the suit and punch you anyway!” Tony shouts, his hands flying up into the air, before he visibly gets control of himself. “I want to punch you, with or without the damn suit, but Pep and Rhodey have assured me that that’s not how mature adults resolve conflict, though Rhodey did say he’d look the other way if I punched you
“Yeah, kiddo, the wedding is over, and it’s time for a little pipsqueak to get some sleep.” Tony leans down to kiss Peter’s forehead. “Sweet dreams, Pete. I love you.”
Steve laughs softly. “As tempting as that is, I’m gonna have to veto that option. Just – just finish up there, then come home. Any idea how long it’ll take?”
“You didn’t do that thing where he says sorry and you automatically forgive him whether he means it or not, did you?” Natasha asks in a light voice, her eyes never straying from the menu in her hands; Steve sighs, brushing a strand of hair out of his face.
Steve stares at Tony, uncomprehending for a long moment, but then he understands; his heart breaks as he wonders how many people fucked Tony then left immediately after without regards to his feelings. He wraps a hand around Tony’s hip, drags him closer; Tony squeaks when Steve seals their mouths together in a kiss that he hopes will convey everything. Even if the kiss doesn’t, the soulmark might, now that they’ve completed the connection.
“A lullaby?” At Peter's nod, Steve swallowed and scrubbed a hand over his face. “Okay, a lullaby. I can do this. What does he usually sing?”
Peter finally looks up, just a quick flick of his eyes from his stuffed animal to Steve’s face. “I’m Peter. I’m five in three months.”
“He's my best friend,” Steve replies, saving Tony from any more floundering. “Always been friends, hopefully always will be. He's saved my ass so many times.”
“Ms Potts is currently in the jet on her way from Malibu. She will be arriving in roughly half an hour.”
Tony looks up from the wings he’s repairing; when nothing else is said, he spits the screwdriver out from between his teeth and cocks his head to the side. “A, even if we were, there’s nothing wrong with that. Therapy is a wonderful tool if you need it. B, why are they thinking that, and how do
Steve absorbs the information, nods when he’s ready. Natasha’s right: Shaving his legs is very different than shaving his face. By the time he
But more nights of the week are spent waiting for Tony to appear, laughing an apology for being late or storming in with a twisted expression on his face and refusing to talk, than are actually spent
“Exactly.” Sam pulls his buzzing phone from his pocket, grimacing at whatever's on the screen. “Shit, man, I gotta go. Emergency with a patient.”
“He’s four, Steve. I’m lucky if he even likes the same colour for more than a day.” Tony sighs, and there’s a short burst of static, like something has bumped against the phone. “Sorry, long day. Honestly, though, you’ll have to ask him.”
Ms Potts stares at him without speaking for a few minutes. When she clears her throat, she's smiling tentatively. “You're Steve, then.”
Instead of answering, Tony grabs Steve's keys from his hand and unlocks the door, heading straight for the bedroom. Steve drops his mail onto the coffee table, follows close behind. His bed is already covered in clothes even though Tony's not been in the room for more than three minutes. Steve stays silent as Tony holds up pants and shirts, discards one or the other, and repeats the pattern with different clothing items. Finally, Tony seems to be done; he passes over a pair of charcoal-grey trousers, a white button-down that Steve forgot he even owns, and a long-sleeved navy cable knit sweater.  Steve waits, but Tony continues to stand there, so with a mental shrug, he peels off the t-shirt he wore to work, leaving the A-line tank top, and slips the button-down shirt on. Tony's fingers are deft, methodical, as he unbuttons Steve's pants and yanks them down. The look of abject concentration on his face makes it clear that he isn't thinking about anything sexual, which makes it easier for Steve to keep his mind off of the fact that Tony is so close, so close, and effectively stripping him. He stumbles as he lifts one foot and slides it into the leg of the slacks, even as he tugs the sweater over his head.
“That would be the sun, sir. I am incapable of controlling the brightness of that particular ‘light’, though I know it must be bothersome to you at the moment.
Things have gotten slightly easier when Clint shows up at his door one rainy morning. Steve isn’t really in the mood for company, but he’s been alone for so long, he can’t take the constant silence any more. So he steps aside and lets Clint in. Clint stays by the door until Steve comes back from the bathroom with a towel. He busies himself with grabbing two glasses from the cupboard and filling them with water while his visitor dries off. If Clint has a negative opinion of the sparse decoration, lack of television, or limited amount of secondhand furniture, he doesn’t voice it, just perches carefully on the couch in what appears to be an attempt to lessen any water damage to the fabric. Steve listens without speaking as Clint tells him about the missions he’s been on for SHIELD, making sure to keep things vague so as not to violate the confidentiality clause in his contract.
Steve sighs, willing the burning flush in his cheeks to recede, and leans against the counter. The spacious room is much too quiet without Tony, without his soft gasps and whispered encouragements, his choked-off moans as his thighs trembled and his fingers twisted in the blond locks. With a steadying exhale, Steve pushes the latest memory aside and busies himself with making breakfast.
“Yeah,” says Tony after a lengthy pause during which he gazes at Steve without blinking. “Yeah, I can understand that. Probably wouldn’t have gotten much sleep tonight, either.”
Pepper presses the power button, and the outrage speaker disappears from the screen. Tony stares blankly at the television for a moment before bursting into laughter. He knows it isn’t
Pepper cocks her head, staring between the two men across from her. To her credit, she doesn’t act on the curiosity in her eyes, instead steering the conversation back to Peter. “What did you tell him?”
Steve nods without hesitation, and Tony presses a kiss to his forehead before sitting back on his heels. The position affords Steve the opportunity to stare openly at the man, the sharp lines of his body smoothed out by muscle and some fat, the brilliance of the arc reactor illuminating the angles of his jaw. Steve can’t believe he’s this lucky; he stretches out an arm to drag a finger along the side of Tony’s thigh, the skin smooth and hair soft under his touch. Tony glances over at him, smiles, and resumes digging through the basket. He comes up with a bottle and a square packet. When he’s done, he turns to Steve and holds out a throw pillow.
And holy mother of everything perfect in this world, that's Steve's mouth on his, warm and gentle and breathtaking in its simplicity. Tony freezes, his brain going fuzzy with shock and seemingly stuck on an endless loop of
“I know.” Tony sighs. “I don’t know. Pete’s… I don’t want to say he’s a secret, but he kind of is. You know? I’ve done everything I can to keep him out of the spotlight, make sure he’s not on anyone’s radar. And, I trust you, and I even trust Bucky, since Peter’s face isn’t plastered all over the gossip rags even after almost six months of us knowing each other, and I know you tell him everything, but…”
to do incredibly fast. Plus, you’ve got each other and the rest of the team to keep you from screwing up too badly. You’ll be okay.”
without a doubt that it isn't for those reasons. Tony's much more than his name, his company, his fortune, his legacy, and Steve wants to know more about who Tony is at his core. So he sits there and waits for any response, though he's hoping for a certain one.
as Tony, he’d accepted that she would never be able to wrap her mind around the odd relationship that her son had with someone she assumed was a figment of his imagination.
They fall silent again, breathing each other's air and exchanging languid kisses, until finally, Tony pushes himself to a full sitting position. Steve moans at the movement; the sudden, delicious pressure is too much, and his head falls back, thumping against the armrest as he wills his erection to go away. It doesn't happen, though, not with Tony looking as wrecked as he does, with the weight of Tony over and around him. His hands clench into fists at his sides, and he fights the urge to lift his hips, to press closer to Tony, to rut wildly against Tony until he gets release. The only thing that stops him is the thought of his actions causing Tony to disappoint Peter. With a sigh, he lifts his hands to grip Tony's waist.
“So, Pep let me come home early today, which was unexpected, but then she told me she wanted us to go to dinner
to. Just thought I'd suggest it so the birth of your child isn't surrounded by the drama of everyone questioning whether the whole parenthood thing is a last-ditch attempt at salvaging your fizzling relationship."
“Yeah,” he says and clears his throat when the word comes out scratchy and congested. “Yeah, I’m fine. I’ll be right out.”
Pepper limps away down the hall, and Tony watches her go, feeling a lot like a bug stuck in a wad of chewed bubblegum stuck to the bottom of a four-inch heel. Clint drags him to his feet, waits until Tony’s stopped gagging, then guides him rather forcefully to the front door. His grip tightens on Tony’s arm when the genius makes a move toward the armour.
The sun shines directly in his eyes by the time Steve wakes up. He fumbles for the clock, panic settling in when he sees it’s past ten a.m. In his attempt to get out of bed, he manages to trip over the edge of the comforter, stub his toe on the bed-frame, and slam his forehead against the wall while trying to regain his balance. He hurries through a cold shower, not giving the water time to warm up, and eats the last apple on his jog to work.
It's been years since he heard the story last, but he still remembers every word ー how they'd met shortly after Ma immigrated from Ireland, how Pop had saved her from falling off the pier as she was rushing down the boardwalk in search of a job, how he'd taken one look at her brilliant blue eyes and long blonde curls and asked her on a date right then and there. She knew instantly, she'd always said, that he was the man for her, and she never regretted moving away to a foreign country, away from her family and friends, because Joseph was her family now, too, and then along came Steve, and they were ecstatic that they were growing from two to three. His father started working longer hours, more jobs, to be able to afford their home and the cost of having a family, but “He never once neglected to spend time with us, no matter how late it was or how soon he had to flit off to his next shift, he loved you so very much, and it killed him to be away so many hours.”
Tony laughs as Pepper finally takes a breath. “You’ll get the signatures before you leave, promise. I’ll talk to the manager and let him know you’re the best hope for any serious answers. Steve’s showering right now, but J can ask if he’s decent for you. Now shoo, I’ve got a business to run.”
“More what? More annoying? Definitely. More exhausting? Depends on what we’re doing, because believe me, you can
Seeing Tony in person, after twenty-seven years, is… Well, it's honestly overwhelming. Steve stands in the doorway and stares at the other man. To his credit, Tony seems to be taking the surprise better than Steve; he's still talking to Ms Potts about some board, the deadlines he's going to reach but it's a very unhappy concession and she should appreciate him bending over backwards to comply with her demands, telling her to buy out some shoe store but go away. Ms Potts only grins in response, her heels clicking against the floor as she passes Steve and exits the office. Finally, Tony falls silent, and he shoves his hands into the pockets of his pants. Steve clears his throat, raises a hand to wave sheepishly.
“Well, damn, I was hoping I'd catch some sort of glimpse.” Tony smirks, but it quickly settles into a smile that's less lascivious, more fond. “How are you feeling? Looked like you got hit pretty hard.”
Two o'clock finds him staring at a half-finished page; his pen is poised above the panel, but Steve makes no move to actually put ink to paper. He glances at the clock again, sighs, and lets the pen clatter to his desk. He can feel Pietro's questioning gaze from where the younger man is sitting on top of his own work-table. Everyone has asked Steve if he’s okay multiple times during the day; at lunch, he overheard Kate and Clint talking in the breakroom, wondering amongst themselves if Brock has made a reappearance in Steve’s life. It’s been years, but Steve is still surprised at the lack of post-breakup pain at the mention of his ex-boyfriend.
Steve gets to the door in time to see the streaks of blue-tinged white speeding away. He stares at the night sky long after Tony’s disappeared. His mind is a jumbled mess. He feels like most of the issues that they have with each other have yet to be resolved, that they’re going to loom ever more present when ー
have done that, not even when I knew him. He was loyal to only one thing, and that was discovering new ways to test science’s limits. You, though, you don’t trust easily – which is understandable – but when you do? You trust implicitly, and you love fiercely.”
Steve spends the next couple of hours working in a fury-fuelled frenzy. He's aware that a lot of his anger is irrational – any normal, sane person would expect to be paid for watching someone else's kid, just like any normal, sane person would expect to have to pay someone for watching their kid – but he can't figure out how to let it go. He ignores everyone around, even when they come up to his desk, and even Natasha slapping him on the back of the head doesn't force him out of his own thoughts.
“For being drunk all the time. For being gone so much. For ever fucking up your life by crashing into your dreams.”
Tony wants to go over, mostly just to put himself between Steve and that damn woman, the one who's still touching him, but he decides not to. Tony can be mature. He can. So he merely heads for the door; he doesn't even stop by the bar for one last drink, which is…that's progress. Pausing by the door to send a quick message to Happy, he stares through the archway at the crowd gathered inside the ballroom, dancing and talking and drinking their fancy little drinks. No one seems to have noticed he's gone, and he isn't sure whether that hurts or not. His phone vibrates once in his hand, and he glances down to see Happy’s one-word message:
Steve laughs quietly, “Oh, yeah. He’d’a been over the moon about it. He’d spoiled her rotten, teach her all sortsa bad things. Yeah, he woulda been so excited.”
Tony lets a finger brush over the skin of Steve's hand. A bee drifts lazily closer, and Steve watches as it hovers near his face before bumbling away to a bunch of wildflowers. A warm hand wraps around his; Steve smiles slightly. Tony has never initiated the hand-holding. He rarely shies away from the touching, except for when he's in those dark moods, but he's always waited for Steve to make the first move. Steve flips his hand over so that their palms are pressed together, interlacing their fingers. Tony's lips quirk in a small grin before he presses a kiss, tender and quick, to the back of Steve's hand.
Steve plucks the card from her hand. “Keep it down, okay? I don't really wanna deal with Clint or Pietro hearing this.”
It’s over then. The Accords have been ratified, and one problem from the collective vision has been handled. Steve turns to face his team, lips twitching as he tries to stifle a smile. Clint doesn’t even bother attempting to hide the fact that he’s pleased with the outcome; even Natasha's mouth is slightly curved, her eyes sparkling as sidesteps the embrace that Thor is trying to bestow upon her. The man doesn't let her refusal slow him down ー he merely turns toward Sam, sweeping him up in a hug tight enough that Steve worries for Sam’s continued health.
“I'm here to keep you from becoming a science experiment and prisoner for the government. You're not under arrest, not by me.”
The room is wrong. The nurse’s hair is wrong, and while Steve may not have had a whole lotta luck with the dames, he has no doubt that her brassiere is wrong, as well. His shock at being alive blinks out of existence at the swell of anger that someone is trying to placate him by
“Bucky, I know this looks bad, but I don't have a whole lotta time to explain right now. Just know we gotta get outta here.” Steve bites back a sigh. “You remember me?”
At Natasha's voice, the others fall silent and turn to stare at him. Steve flounders a bit. What the hell would he know about planning for something like this? This is completely out of his repertoire of knowledge. But looking around at them, knowing they're relying on some sort of leadership in this, he realises he can't shy away from the responsibility.
The little boy’s dark eyes are wide as he stands right outside the door, staring up at Steve. Steve stares back.
“Tony and I have, quite surprisingly, bonded over… certain similarities, so we come here and talk when we can’t sleep.”
“So, Steve,” says Pepper once Darcy has bounced away to the kitchen area, “Peter behaved well for you?”
“I swear, if you say 'penis-shaped candle' one more time, the only thing you'll be fucking for a while is your hand," Steve groaned, head dropping to rest in his hands.
Peter nods, leaning heavily against Steve's thigh. Now that he's really looking, he can see that Peter isn't in the shirt he was wearing this morning, and the poor kid looks exhausted. His face is still pale except for the bright red splotches on his cheeks, and his lashes rest against dark purple half-moons under his eyes. Steve doesn't hesitate, just stretches out his arms and hefts Peter up so he can curl into his chest. Peter lets out a soft sigh, rests his head under Steve's chin. Steve smiles politely, says goodbye, and heads back to the main office. After writing down Peter's name, the reason why Peter is leaving, and signing his own name, Steve tucks the child closer and makes his way out of the building.
Steve lets out a shaky breath, lowers himself into one of the seats. Tony stays on his feet; a gauntleted hand rests on Steve's shoulder, the weight and pressure oddly reassuring, grounding.
“That, my dear Cap, is an unhackable, un-fuck-with-able voting poll so we don’t end up stuck with someone grossly unqualified and narcissistically malignant as President in the future.”
He's just pulled on a fresh change of clothes when a knock sounds at the door. Steve peeks through the peephole and sees a familiar head of dark hair. He pulls the door open and steps back, letting Tony enter.
“This is his last known place of residence,” announces Thor, handing over a slip of paper. “I can be there swiftly, Steve, just say the word and I will go.”
He barely gets the words out for JARVIS to initiate a privacy lockdown before he’s reaching for the bottle of scotch he keeps on hand for celebratory purposes (though lately, it’s been mostly decorative).
