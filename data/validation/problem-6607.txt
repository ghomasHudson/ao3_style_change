“What?” Steve could see Tony’s eyes light up, his eyebrows raise slightly as a thought churned in his head.
“I’ll clean up after lunch. Do you think you can help set the AI up?” Banner asked, stepping away from the controls and over to his bags.
Steve rummaged through the drawers, finding a pair of boxers, a pair of soft, unicorn-patterned pants, and a taco-saurus t-shirt. He returned to the bathroom to find Tony hunched over the toilet, spilling his guts out into the bowl.
“Yeah?” Tony didn’t know why he was pressing Steve for a response, it was more desperation than curiosity.
“I could, maybe, help,” Wanda offered, her Russian accent cutting through the living room. “If he does not wake up soon, that is.”
“Hey, Tony.” A hand on his shoulder made him spin around. Steve stood there, his face serious. “Can I talk to you?”
Tony thought it useful to befriend the electricians first, seeming as he was probably going to be with them the most. He left his room, gently shutting the door behind him.
She snickered and patted his shoulder a few more times before exiting to the hall. Wanda was leaning against the couch and chatting with Vision, small red sparkles playing at her fingertips. Steve noticed they pent more time together, and Vision looked relaxed and was smiling. Steve felt a little warm feeling in his heart as he watched them.
He just gave a little smile before going over to check on Bucky. Stark pulled up his sleeve to check on Bucky’s healing.
Two guards gripped Steve by his arm, another two grabbed Bucky, dragging them forward to display to the new arrivals.
The jeep in front of them exploded upwards, leaving fire in its wake. The driver slammed on the brakes and grabbed her gun.
“Sir, I’m seeing a few reports on a “Red Hulk” in multiple Army databases. Would you like me to access them?”
“Three attempts since Pepper’s death.” Steve pulled up some video tapes from Tennessee and some vitals.
Steve’s blood wasn’t boiling, in fact, it was the complete opposite. Tony looked just like Steve before the serum. Coughing, struggling for air, scrambling for his inhaler.
Clint threw a grape, hitting Pietro square in the forehead. Pietro picked up a banana, ready to throw it at him. Steve intervened before it got out of hand.
You know Clint wasn't going to leave that place standing after he saw Tony in such a state! I made him a bit more of the quiet type, but he'll still have his humor, dont worry.
“I thought, I mean, I wanted to be a surprise...” Peter fumbled over his words. “I’m gonna go drop this off.” He took his stuff and dashed to his room, shutting the door behind him.
“Shh, hey, hey! It’s me!” Steve showed some teeth in his grin. This seemed to get to Bucky, who immediately relaxed and gave him a smile in return.
Tony began to rip off the bandages that laced his chest. Panic rose as he felt the metal. Tony groaned as he tore through layer after layer. The contraption was finally revealed, and Tony gasped.
“How was what, school?” Rhodey snorted. “Chill, I guess. What did you think of Mrs. Hernandez, Happy?”
Steve loved spending time with Tony. The way he smiled at Steve’s “back in my day” jokes, and Tony teasing him about his lack of technological intelligence. The way Tony hummed as he worked, and the way he cared for his robots, treating them like his kids. How Tony had made Steve his own little space in his lab, just for Steve.
Tony heard the scraping sounds coming from a man a bit away. A man was shaving his face in a dirty mirror. Tony moved to try to leave the bed only to be stopped by a wire.
Tony ran, stumbling backwards as the bomb detonated. Shrapnel penetrated his chest, and the force of the explosion sent him flying backwards. He pulled open his button-up to see that the shards had gone through the special armor Dad had made for him. The pain hit him like a wave, making him gasp for breath. Tony’s world slowly sank into blackness as he felt himself being dragged away.
Tony grabbed a broom from a tiny storage room and began to sweep up the dust and dirt that settled on the floor.
“Do not damage the merchandise!” one growled with a German accent. Steve tried to shoot Bucky a worried look, but Bucky was too busy struggling against the guards.
Clint passed him his shield, a smirk on his face. "Thought you'd want this back." Steve gave a smug grin, and moved to the front of the group.
Steve traced his fingers along the little dip in Tony’s chest. The surgery to remove the arc reactor had left Tony’s chest sore and lighter, the change in weight making it hard to get used to at first. Steve didn’t have any scars himself, his healing properties making it impossible to leave a lasting impression.
Swallowing, Steve went to bathroom, slowly opening the door. Tony was lounged in the bath, his head rolled back.
A loud whistle blew, and the two who were fighting quickly ceased. They wiped the sweat away from their foreheads, unwrapping bandages they wore on their hands.
Steve’s eyes slowly drifted closed, and before he knew it, it was morning, the sun shining brightly outside. Tony was gone, a little, bunched up blanket in his place.
Tony went up to Steve. There were different footages and documents showing on the table. One was of Tony’s fall to earth after the Chitari attack, a document showed different symptoms of PTSD. Another video showed his time in Tennessee, as well as his different anxiety attacks.
He sought a room that said “Thor,” and waited patiently outside. Tony had been flipping through the team’s files while he was unpacking to see if there was anything he should check up on later. After a few moments he knocked on the door.
I’m taking a lot of stuff from IM1, instead of making it my own, unlike chapter 1-2. It is gonna be vaguely different at parts, but I’m going to stick to generally the same plot line. I hoped you liked the Bruce addition!
The man began to speak again, “Alssarukh aldhy earadah waliduk , 'uriduk 'an tusnaeah li. sarukh 'ariha aldhy nasif safh aljabl.”
“That’s a bad word. D’you hear that Friday?” Steve tolled his eyes, scraping out the last bit of egg.
He stood warily outside the glass of the room, looking in at the operation. There was a scanner around Bruce, and Bruce was lying there, sweat dripping off of him, a cloth draped over his bare body. There was a doctor keeping his head from thrashing about, gentle hands keeping his head in place.
“What I did?” He chuckled. He pulled out a jacket and handed it to Tony, who put it on.“What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could. There’s a lot left, and it’s headed into your atrial septum. Here, wanna see?”
“You have one of the longest and most depressing resumes in this crew. I just want you to know I trust you, and I trust you with the safety of this crew. This will be nothing like your last ship, okay?”
There was a small, “Hello? Who is it?” before the door swung open. “Oh my god!” the lady said, flabbergasted as she saw Tony standing outside her door. She had long brown hair and tanned skin, a small amount of sweat dotted around her face.
Tony let out a sigh. He would have to make do with what he had. Nothing natural would work. So he would have to invent something. A type of tech that could self-repair and withstand hundreds of thousands of Newtons. It would need to withstand a lot of external forces, friction, and bugs.
Tony sat the photo aside as he curled up the seat, sobbing a wild, ugly sob. He ran a finger along the scar that dipped into his chest. He had taken the arc reactor out for her. Everything he does is just a painful memory.
“Friday. Tell me why Tony has a gun.” Steve made sure to use his army voice as if he would intimidate the AI.
Tony drew in a shaky breath, noticing how his hands trembled. His heart was beating out of his chest. Tony stumbled away from the suit as his mind spun into panic mode. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t call for help. He could only sit there, utterly useless as his body and mind betrayed him.
“So, umm.” Tony stuffed his hands in his jeans pockets. He had buttoned back up his shirt and ran his fingers through his hair one too many times. Tony rocked back and forth on his feet, looking more embarrassed than he ever had in his entire life.
Bucky shot Steve an excited smile before sitting on a little stool. The gown restricting his movements as he tried to swing his legs back and forth.
“Well, I’m Thor. I’m sure you know that already. My help is Pietro. Rowdy kid. He’s here with his sister, Wanda. They’re practically inseparable!” Thor spoke fondly of Pietro. Tony noted Thor’s friendliness and gentle attitude despite his brutish appearance.
“Ah… yes.” Steve let out a chuckle, rubbing his thumb along his lips. “You’re right Clint. Don’t make me keep ya.” He scooted to the side, waving to the door. “Keep the ship running. Get to know each other. I’ll see you for lunch.”
Clint was upside down on a couch reading a thick chapter book, Wanda sat next to him with her back propped up against the arm, a small ball floating in front of her. Pietro and Sam were fighting over some cookies that Rhodes had baked while Rhodes ate a brownie, shaking his head in amusement.
Steve rubbed the bridge of his nose. The last time he was in the lab with Tony it hadn’t exactly turned out like he expected it to. They hadn’t had sex, no, but it was intimate enough to make a lasting impression on their relationship. What the hell was he supposed to do?
Stark clapped his hands, a wide smile on his face. “Aren’t they perfect? Just a bit of training and they’re ready!”
It wasn’t as if Steve hadn’t seen a man naked before. He had to help his drunk army buddies all the time back in the day. But something about Tony made him stutter and flush as if he were a little kid with a crush. He had no idea why, and he wasn’t sure if it was a good thing or not.
“Assuming that Ross is Red Hulk, and that Red Hulk is mostly similar to Hulk, he should be pissed all the time, right?” Tony talked to himself.
Even if Steve hadn’t said it, Natasha was always in charge. She was able to get anyone to stop misbehaving with a twitch of a finger.
Tony looked through the food, testing to make sure each was well-seasoned and fully cooked. He checked the drink dispensers, seeing if they were fully stocked and clean. Once he was satisfied that everything was up to code, he put on a small apron and walked behind the counter.
“Yeah, sure. But I’m just a computer geek,” he waved to his Star Treck memorabilia and to his little chemistry set he had on one side of his desk. “If I couldn’t play football six months ago, why should I be able to play it now?”
They got tired of waiting for Clint and Natasha, but there was nothing they could do. They drank their last drops of water, pangs of hunger stabbing then in the gut.
“Hey.” Tony smiled. It was good to talk to his friends again. The summer was too busy, with Tony helping his dad in the workshop on the newest project.
“There are more like you,” he announced, checking in with security. One door audibly unlocked, slowly creaking open from the inside.
Tony remembered Ross’ pestering over rules and regulations, trying to lock up Wanda and force the rest of the Avengers into a strict code of do’s and don’t’s. Tony and Steve had fought over it before Steve eventually agreed to sign, but made extreme changes afterwards, practically freeing them of the accords entirely. The entire process had left Tony mentally and physically exhausted, country after country, nation after nation calling to yell and protest and wave off the Avengers as if they were pieces of meat. Tony hid how much scrutiny they were all under, taking blow after blow. He nearly didn’t survive the process since Pepper wasn’t there.
That took a while to write. I’m pretty bad at writing steamy scenes, so I left it up to the imagination. Tell me what you want to see next!
“What’s going on?” Tony shouted. Gunfire rang all around them. The soldiers started shouting things at each other that he couldn’t make out.
“Mr. Stark, there appears to be a very large figure coming straight for the Compound. Would you like me to set off the alarm?”
After grimacing a moment, he began to look for the Hulk’s route to the Compound. Tony first looked for how he got to the United States. He could worry about where he crashed later.
The tall man in the green uniform let out a grunt, supposedly of approval, before spinning on his heels and exiting the room. The short man in the suit flashed Stark a fake smile before guiding the rest of the party out of the door.
He looked over the Stark Industries paperwork. It was a blur of signing, calling, yelling, and fussing. He took out the brownies as the timer went off and sat back, waiting for them to cool.
Tony slowly crept into the living room, his breath quite. He left the hall, seeing Dad sitting in his chair and Mom in the kitchen.
Tony brushed off his clothes and sat down, slightly nervous. Sam gave him a hard slap on the back, laughing.
They both got comfortable, the new warmth making then sleepy. Tony's head slowly fell onto Steve's chest, and he fell asleep. He soon snored as he had the first good sleep in days.
The duos began to buddy up and gather onto the elevator. Tony touched a finger to his temple, his eyes flickering slightly as he sent a message to his employers.
“This is your team now, Steve,” Stark told him. “Get to know them. Because if you don’t and we need you to fight, it could kill you and every one of them.
“Nun, uh. Me first.” He pulled out his phone, tapping it a few times. A video of Spider-man swinging across the screen, pulling a thief’s foot out from under him. “This- this is you, isn’t it?” Another video had Peter pulling a gun from a robber’s hand as the latter attempted to rob a little store.
Tony found himself inching closer, Steve soon found himself doing the same. Until they were both only a couple inches away from touching.
“Easy there. I come in peace.” Tony let his eyes wander around the room. A small desk had different, old computer parts strewn about it. There was a twin bed with simple light blue sheets, and a variety of science-y posters and pamphlets were taped up on the wall. His dresser had different Star Trek action figures and a photo of Peter with a few classmates who were all dressed in a yellow jacket.
Steve helped Tony into his room, flicking on the light. Sitting Tony down, he let out a huff as if he had accomplished a great task.
Steve huffed and forced his leg to stop shaking. He started to panic a little. How was he supposed to tell Natasha about his love life? His best friend and kick-ass assassin partner, Natasha.
While tinkering with a new upgrade for his suit, Tony once again thought about his drunken night. Tony kept having to shake it away, yet it pressed at the corners of his mind. Making suits was pretty much muscle memory by now, so his mind always wandered freely.
Tony stopped by the door that had his name on it. Inside was a simple twin-sized bed, a desk, dresser, and a closet. A laptop sat on the desk, as well as a lamp and a pencil sharpener. He opened the closet to find it no wider than the door, two feet deep, and a single pole running from one side to the other. A little bit away from the closet stood the bed. It’s cover was blue-gray, and less than knee high.
“Hey, moron. I’m going to clean your face, so don’t attack me, mkay?” Steve took the rag and tapped the edges of Tony’s lips.
Tony and Steve are trapped in the enemy camp, no escape in sight. They only have each other for who knows how long, slowly starving.
“Hey, Friday. Pull up that Spider-Kid again.” Tony had a pencil and notebook, a blank page ready to sketch out a new design.
Rhodey pulled a granola bar out of his inside jacket pocket. “Shh,” he said, sliding it into Tony’s hoodie. Happy snickered as they entered class.
He let out an exasperated sigh. He flicked through different news stationed and, finding none that interested him, switched it back off again.
Steve always checked up on him. Tony had come to find his visits to the garage comforting, eager to have somebody to talk to about his latest design. Bruce was no longer around, so Tony struggled to find anyone who understood him. Steve was useful when Tony needed something held up or a screw needed tightened.
Steve finished, making sure his eyes didn’t wander. He helped Tony and dried him off. He helped him into his clothes, Tony laughing at the choice of attire.
Steve escaped the bathroom, and immediately his eyes locked onto the gun on the table. This mystery would need solving first.
Steve let Tony drink first, his tiny frame causing him to worry. The water felt good on Tony's parched tongue.
Tony summoned the others to the main, large-spaced living room that was mainly used for movie nights. They took their seats and waited anxiously for the news.
Stark let out a frustrated breath before turning to Bucky and Steve. “Okay, I need to prep you two.” Stark rubbed the bridge of his nose, one hand resting on his hip.
“Yes. He has shown great intelligence that can be incredibly useful for Stark Industries. If he agrees I’d like to set up something with you two.”
“Of course, we’ll have to start in the morning,” Steve jokes, trying to lighten the mood. “Do you, ugh, want me to write it down?”
He took the faced-down photograph that sat on the nightstand. It was of him and Pepper at one of the many conventions they went to. In this one, she was smile, leaning on Tony as he laughed, his face red as a tomato. Tony started at the picture, his body numb as his mind spun.
Tony ran down to his lab to grab a suit while Steve grabbed his shield from beside the door. They ran outside, their eyes darting every which way to find the approaching danger.
Tony quickly sized up each of his fellow crewmates. There was an extremely muscular blond-haired man next to a skinny, silver haired kid. Then a tall, black man next to a short blond in a ridiculously purple shirt. Next to them was a brown-haired woman, with a redhead and a skinny black haired man. After them were a big blond, and finally a shaggy, brown haired man.
"Everybody else was busy," Steve explained, ducking away from a right hook. "Besides, you needed to get out the lab."
“My father always talked about you, ya know.” Tony played with the little bubbles. “You were my bedtime stories.”
He set off down the corridors down to Tony’s room, readying himself for whatever was to come. He knocked on the door before letting himself in.
“What time is it?” Steve asked, setting the mugs down on the coffee table, crumbling the burger wrappers from the previous night and throwing them away.
“Organic webs filtered through mechanical shooters.” Peter tugged his arm free of Tony’s grasp. “Do have to eat the webs again like real spiders?”
He was teleported onto the deck, from Earth to where the ship was docked in space. Tony was set up with a duffle of mechanical tools and clothes.
Tony looked down at his feet. He took a deep breath before responding. “So you wanna stick up for the little guy? Help where others can’t.”
“I’m Sam. Navigation.” Sam reached out to shake Tony’s hand. He took it, flashing a quick smile before retreating to his quarters.
He took out the clip. Empty. Tony Stark has an empty, never fired before gun tucked between his couch cushions without any ammunition in sight, for protection? Even then, Friday usually gave some sort of explanation for everything.
look to Rogers but Rogers nodded again. ‘Come on, Tic Tac,’ said Sam to Scott, ‘Let’s get outta here.’
Life with Tony was always going to be a roller coaster but they eventually got married in front of their family, the Avengers and pretty much adopted Peter as their son. As the years went, they both grew older and handed the reins to the next generation of Avengers.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Still the shield continued to reflect Tony’s face. He could see his gaunt reflection in it. In the weapon built by his father. This mere shield was brought to life by the person who wielded it for good, to protect others and Tony asked
Everyone nodded in agreement. Scott and Bruce changed their bets to Loki. Sam also to Loki “Sorry Cap.” They managed to get in some last minute bets from Wanda and Vision who just came back from their honeymoon where they both bet on Steve.
Steve rushed out and pushed away Tony in time for the shot to miss. Knowing failure, the alien assassin sent a group of extraterrestrial looking mercenaries after Tony. Tony suiting up his Iron Man armor and Steve in combat stance quickly defended one another. “Who
He thought about Tony and his life with Pepper and Morgan. Despite what happened between them, Steve had always wished the best for Tony and he was glad that he finally found happiness with them. Peggy was someone Steve treasured and a missed opportunity but with Tony he knew he found happiness. He just had to go mess it all up. A pain still permanently seared in his heart when he heard Tony’s words “So Was I.” “Liar.”
Steve looked back up at Tony. Tony never called him Steve. ‘Yes. I promise you Tony. Bucky is not in a position to harm anyone else,’ said Steve. ‘I’m sorry for what I have done. I should never have kept the truth from you,’ he paused ‘if you want retribution, go ahead. Take me in. Shoot me if you want. But don’t let the rest pay for my mistakes.’ He proceeded to put down the semi-automatic he was holding. It felt weird to Tony not seeing Steve with his shield. It pained him at the same time.
The team just shrugged and mumbled at the same time various reasons for attending. To Tony’s surprise, the meeting went normally. There were no questions on his personal life, everything briefed were strictly business. Off course, that was a different story when the meeting ended.
Peter looked nervous. “What’s up kid?” asked Tony innocently. The other three stayed in the room with him pretending to be discuss other matters.
to give it up. Tony took a few deep breaths. He decided that getting anywhere away from that red, blue and white of a Frisbee is better, so he wandered aimlessly around the Avengers’ living quarters.
Tony Stark stared at the blinking light of his telephone for a good five minutes before answering a very pissed off General Ross on the other end. He immediately knew The Raft had been breached. He didn’t need Ross to tell him it was Cap. Rogers. Steve.
Steve snorted a little and gave Tony a small smile. ‘Definitely harder when both the bad guys and the authorities want us dead.’ His smile faded. ‘Are you here to bring us in again?’
Tony Stark felt everything. He knew he was on the brink of collapse but he had to stay awake. Him and Blue Meanie were saved. One last miracle. He thought he would never see them again. He already lost the kid. Tony wondered if Pepper was...or if
Once Thor was done, the three kittens wrestled for a bit, but before too long all three of them let out little kitty yawns and a few moments later Steve and Tony had their laps full of cat. Tasha settled on Tony and Clint had chosen Steve, while Thor tried to snuggle in between them. It really was a tiny loveseat, though, so there wasn't any space between the two men. As Tony was more than a little aware.
It stabbed Steve right in the gut. Tony had a beautiful voice. He vaguely remembered this from a few nights ago when they'd been discussing this event, but it hadn't been like this. Not with these words, this song.
“It’s not like that! They’re not friends. They’re vultures, Steve. Vultures who flock to see if the Stark heir is showing any signs of weakness this year that they can exploit. I’ll be paying for your dress robes because you’ll be doing me a favor by attending. You’ll be my moral support. And I promise I’ll have your back. I won’t leave you alone with disapproving matriarchs who don’t want you to look at their daughters with your lack of pedigree.”
When he finally starts noticing the frigid tiles under his bare ass, he belatedly pulls up his pants. It's the beginning of the end of the storm and a few minutes later he hiccups to a halt. Wiping away fresh wells of tears for a few minutes more. He's exhausted. He feels hollow.
Shooting up into the air over his own gates it looked indeed like the local king had showed up with a small army. Tony had expected this, of course. He wouldn't have let a demon move into his back yard either. There were about a dozen men on horses and four or five times as many on foot. They all wore chain mail and had different variations of sharp metal sticks, and a few were holding banners. Whatever order they had arrived in went out the window as soon as they spotted Tony coming over the castle walls. A few horses reared, men were stumbling back away from the panicked beasts and what looked like a twelve year old boy tripped over his pike and managed to take three men down with him. Seizing the opening his appearance had given him, Tony shot a few repulsor blasts over their heads, adding to the chaos. Several footmen in the back made a run for it, despite their king's bellowed order to stand fast. Tony drowned him out by turning up AC/DC's Hell's Bells over the speakers. Then he did loop de loops over their heads, ripped a few lances out of shaking hands and tossed them aside and then he fried some vegetation on their outer perimeter. More people ran, dropping their weapons, including a few of the knights on horseback, but the king still held steady. So Tony plucked up the adolescent boy next to him from his saddle and by the look on the king's face he had guessed right. The boy was likely his son and dear to him. The panicked boy was kicking wildly and Tony had to tighten his grip lest he drop him; the boy promptly lost control over his bladder, but at least he went still. Tony felt like a big, mean bully, but it had to be done.
the statement with 'you people', not start it. Sorry for confusing you. Even so, your statement is still flawed. My best estimate is that you have used the phrase 'my wife' at least two dozen times in the past hour, while I have used 'my husband'.... " Tony paused, pretending to count on Steve's fingers. "Half a dozen times, tops. So objectively this entire conversation has been about your lifestyle, not ours."
“Was confined to the suit. No suit, no JARVIS.” Tony swallowed hard and Steve let go of his respectful stance and wrapped an arm around his shoulder. He thought he was reading the situation correctly, but it still surprised him when Tony didn't pull away instantly.
Tony stared at him, wide eyed, then grinned and pointed at his stash. Steve grinned back and helped himself. Then he rolled onto his side and propped up one leg and Tony rolled with him, watching in fascination as Steve coated two fingers with lube and started circling his hole. He ran his hand up and down Steve’s hip as he watched, not being able to keep from touching. As the two fingers finally disappeared into Steve, first one, then the other, he moved to softly bite the inside of Steve’s thigh. Steve moaned in response and, encouraged, Tony moved up to lick a stripe up Steve’s leaking cock. Before he could reach the top and close his lips over the head, Steve pushed him back down, though. Following his guidance, he nuzzled Steve’s balls, and apparently that was more welcome, because Steve let out a long breath and relaxed back down. After a while, Tony pulled back again to watch and trailed a curious finger around Steve’s rim.
getting out of this?" Abdel cringed. Tony thought he might be blushing too, but it was hard to tell with his skin tone and the lack of light. Yet he seemed a little gleeful in his cringing.
"Shows how much you know, Stark." Clint dove into the fridge and pulled out another bottle, condensation running down its side. "Tripel Ale is best with gingerbread. Belgian White Beer with sugar cookies. But white beer is better in summer. Which is not now." He slapped Tony's hand, which had been reaching for one of the still warm gingerbread men. "You get one cookie for every ten you decorate." He jerked his thumb over his shoulder towards the kitchen table, where Tony spotted Steve and Natasha hard at work. Steve had the tip of his tongue stuck out in concentration. Tony gritted his teeth and looked determinedly away.
Tony didn't say anything for a long time. That was alright, Steve hadn't expected an answer and he wasn't going to push it. He did another couple of branches. When Tony finally spoke it startled him.
Natasha smirked. "It'd be the charitable thing to do, don't you think? Then maybe they won't end up miserable failures."
The next morning Steve wakes up with anger simmering under his skin. It's better than panic, but it's still uncomfortable. Steve hasn't really been angry in years. But now he's pissed off. At Tony. At himself. At all the freaky feelings he doesn't want to feel, but that just keep coming. He wants the wall back, but he knows at the same time that he shouldn't want that. Now that it's cracked, he knows the wall is bad. No matter how much safer is seems to be with the wall between himself and his feelings, it's not living. It's existing, but not living. He does his breathing exercises while he stares at the ceiling and the anger recedes a little. Gwenna puts her head on his hip and he unclenches his hand to scratch behind her ears. He's still on edge though when he gets out of the shower.
Once he caught himself petting the fabric of Steve's suit and proceeded to work 72 hours with no sleep to try to burn that out of his brain, but it didn't work. He still dreamed of Steve. The dreams were wonderful and horrible at the same time.
The reassembled Iron Man armor was laid out on the table and Tony was standing next to it. Sunlight slanted in through the window and made dust particles dance around the two of them. The expression on Tony's face made the scene eerily reminiscent of a wake, the only thing missing being the coffin. After a moment, Steve realized that a wake was exactly what it was. He made his way over silently and stood in parade rest shoulder to shoulder with Tony. The silence stretched for a while.
The first thing that happened was that Tony turned twenty-one. It wasn’t as big a deal in this country where the drinking age was sixteen and the driving age eighteen, but he had a good time going out bar hopping with his roommates and a few friends. It was a May evening that felt like summer already, and he’d barely thought about Steve at all.
"LET THIS WOMAN GO, OR THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE DIRE." He fired a repulsor shot into the air to underline his words. This drew a gasp from the crowd, but if anything they looked more determined. The men with the torches shuffled forward. Another rock or two came sailing Tony's way. He fired a shot that hit the earth in front of the feet of the man in the middle. The man jumped back, but was pushed forward again by the surging crowd. Tony hesitated. Killing people would immediately cement his reputation as a demon, but he wasn't sure what kind of time travel he was experiencing. If this was fixed time line, then anything he did would have happened anyway and he could do whatever he wanted with nothing more to fear than Steve's intense disapproval when they met again, which was enough to hold his fire. Just the idea of explaining to Steve that several dozen people were dead to make it easier for Tony to find him, made him wince. And if he was in a dynamic time line or, god forbid, a multi-verse, then killing a potential ancestor would guarantee he'd never go back home. He'd either wink out of existence (and/or get stuck in a time loop) or come back to a different universe than the one he'd left. Bad choices all. He'd have to aim to be more of a flash bang type of demon. Despite the fact that these people were really pissing him off.
"That's no basis for a system of government!" crowed Tony, bumping his shoulder into Steve with enough force to make him stumble. "O my God, Steve, you have no idea what a tragedy it has been that absolutely no one has been getting my Monty Python references! It was, like, worse than the lack of coffee. Almost! Man, I could kiss you right now!"
Tony expected Rogers to just salute and go sacrifice his lovely hair and his miles of creamy skin for Freedom and the American Way, but the man spoke as he stood up.
“Yeah, I am. When I have the others. But in the meantime, you know, one of them kept pouncing on my head and the other got really snippy with my ankles and it just seemed appropriate?”
"You'd be surprised how little time I actually spend at the parties, which are mostly charity events, by the way, and I barely date. I know both type of events get lots of press, but I really spend about 95% of my non-Avengin' time in my workshop. I am not saying I couldn't be more enthused about my commitment, because I probably could and Fury annoys the hell out of me, so that doesn't help. But I like to think that I am there when they need me." Steve nodded silently, looking down at his hands. He looked a little lost. Tony felt for him. Apparently he hadn't been kidding about the empty heart. Tony placed his hands on Steve's and felt the fingers uncurl under his own. "You know, if you wanted to, once your enlistment is over, you could always apply as a SHIELD agent. If you feel like battling doombots is more of your thing than the Taliban."
"I... don't know, Sir." The alarm ramped up. "I can't sense any satellites overhead. I don't think my sensors are blocked, we seem to be out in the open. There just don't seem to be any." That was insane. There was no place on Earth that was out of reach of all satellites. You could get a satellite signal in the Mongolian steppes, for chrissakes.
"For what it's worth, I'm Buddhist," said Bruce, "But I don't mind doing the Christmas thing with all of you. As long as we keep it low key on the religious side."
“Let’s go home and eat and sleep and shower and I am sure by that time we can convince him to stall for a couple of months.”
And it was also swell that the virginity he didn't particularly want or need made him eligible to find the Grail, except that he didn't
“Uh, no.” William would be here soon enough, though. “I am here to... test the mettle of the knights of Albion. To challenge them and see if they would fight a demon. See if they are as worthy as the Frankish bards proclaim.” Tony paused.
“NI” said Tony and flew off to deposit the boy on a hill a few miles away. The king and what was left of the army followed them.
It was a fortunate pick, because there turned out to be a village at the edge of the lake in that direction. It looked quaint. Very, very quaint, in fact. Maybe it was one of those hippie towns where New Age nuts gathered in stone circles, like the one behind him, to participate in fake rituals that involved dreadful music. He could see from afar that there was some sort of market going on on the main square. That seemed like a good place to pick up some coffee, breakfast and information, in that order. He just hoped it wasn't like a craft fair or anything, because he wasn't in the mood for crystal beads and hemp clothing and all that shit.
It had been, yet Steve found himself wiping sweaty hands on his robes while trying not to gape at the fancy house across the lawn. He was spared the need to answer by three smartly dressed house elves apparating in front of them.
"You didn't jump on that? That sounded right up your alley. Us against evil, Superheroes of the world unite! Saving the universe and all that jazz?"
Tony was silent. He hugged his knees and looked out the window, wondering how the hell they had gone from last night to ending up here.
“Then you know it isn’t that simple. Maybe I would have considered the long term ramifications a bit more carefully if I hadn’t been dying?”
"Oh, that's probably due to deformation of the cornea, caused by cryogenic pressure. It should pass when your temperature has normalized."
“Neither am I,” admitted Tony. Pepper could attest to that. And a few other people. “But you're welcome to stay and practice to your heart's content. Let me get Elayne. She'll know which rooms you can use.”
There were going to be four people in his tower at Christmas? Tony must have looked a little poleaxed, because suddenly Steve turned to him. "Oh. That is, of course, if it is alright with you that we do Christmas here, Tony. I guess we should have asked first, maybe." Steve really was a decent guy. Old fashioned manners and all that.
The actual driver, whom Tony dismissed on the spot, threw his helmet on the ground as he stomped off and Tony suspected there would be a lengthy apology and a parting with enough money to smoothe ruffled feathers in the future. Whatever. Maybe he'd be dead before that happened anyway. The engine of the Formula 1 racecar rumbled pleasantly under his ass and when the flag came down for the start of the race and the kick of adrenalin hit his system, he cackled in glee. It turned out he wasn't even that bad at racing. It was different than flying the armor of course, JARVIS wasn't his copilot in this, but the insane pull of the car as he rounded the corners was exhilarating.
"Not for lack of trying," answered Steve. He was still a little pissed about the stunt with the repulsor, but it was hard to be angry with someone who was this miserable.
"So the problem is," Clint muttered, "That as soon as I shoot the first one, they can have enough of them run this way that not even I can shoot them all before they reach us. It's a narrow hallway."
“You want it pushed back in?” Tony asks and for one mortifying second Steve has no idea what he is talking about as his mind goes places where he had decided it shouldn't go. Then he realizes Tony means the TV and yes, that definitely has to go back against the wall. It's... wrong this way. Wrong enough to kill the blush threatening to spill over his face.
the entire thing. But that didn't make sense, until Tony spotted the serpent's tail in the water on the other side of the ship and then he realized it wasn't trying to go over the ship, it was trying to wrap itself
Steve looked over at Bors plodding along beside him, his arms filled with dead branches. "Does Sir Percival truly not know that bees sting? Is he... a simpleton?" Bors shrugged, hampered by his own load. His default scowl was firmly in place.
He set them down gently on the springy grass next to a tree. Steve tossed his shield on the grass and hopped off Tony's boot. He stood there for a few seconds, hands on his hips, looking away into the distance. Scanning for enemies, maybe. Or taking in the view of the mountains, and wow, those were close. They must have gone further than he thought, since he was pretty sure he was looking at the Matterhorn there in the distance. He made the helmet retract to get a better look. Yup. Matterhorn. Pretty. They didn't really have time for pretty, though.
Steve held it out to him silently. His mouth had gone dry the second he had spotted Tony's naked torso next to him, water cascading down the rippling muscles. Now he tried to swallow as Tony rose further out of the water to receive the soap. He couldn't make his throat work. The water surface was so low on Tony's hips that Steve had a front seat view of the magnificent V of his hip bones and his water logged happy trail. A passing eddy dipped the water even lower and for a couple of seconds Steve could see the top his pubic hair. He almost groaned. Of course Tony had decided to skinny dip, the man had no modesty at all.
Tony sucked in a tiny breath and next to him he felt Steve tense up. Fury couldn't know, could he? Steve was sporting a neatly trimmed beard, his hair was slicked back and he wore sunglasses everywhere. Even if Fury had somehow figured out that Tony had found America's Supersoldier, the man currently guarding Tony's back looked very different from the old pictures of the clean shaven, all American poster boy for sleeping with your hands above the blankets. Of course, Tony would still pay half his fortune for thirty minutes under said blankets, but that was neither here nor there.
Steve's mouth went dry. Did Tony... occasionally... with men? The fantasies he had been manfully trying to suppress the last few days came roaring back. Kissing Tony, touching him, touching skin. Tony looking at him, with laughter in his eyes. With want. Drawing him in, drawing him close and pulling him on top, fitting Steve between the expanse of his legs. He blushed at how he wanted to bury his face in Tony's neck and suck on his skin and how Tony would push his hips up and... He forcefully wrenched his attention back to the conversation at hand, praying that Tony hadn't noticed his distraction.
“What’s going on?” Steve cut in, as he was walking backwards into the living room, so Tony and his visitor could enter. He had three tiny kittens hanging from his jeans, who were mewling pathetically at all the unwanted movement. Tony had refused to name Stevie’s brood, he knew what happened when you named cats and he wasn’t making that mistake again. But Steve had ignored him and dubbed them Huey, Dewey and Louie.
As much fun as he'd been having up till then, it'd been awesome to see the armor envelope Tony and watch him become Iron Man before his eyes. The way he'd shot past Steve with Clint in his arms was impressive. And that kind of bled into the hope that he could make Tony understand. Eventually.
“I…” Was he sure? It vaguely seemed that sometime, somewhere far away this might not be the best of ideas, too fast and stuff, but, really, right here, right now, it was virtually impossible to even allocate any brain power to contemplating that scenario. Because right here, right now, he had his hands on a massively attractive man who was willing to interact with Tony’s dick and that was really all that was important.
The man raised his arms and proclaimed dramatically: "Go, adventurous Grail knights, to the Castle of Maidens and there do away with the wicked customs!" Then he turned on his heel and stalked back into the forest. Steve blinked. That had been decidedly weird.
Steve sat back on his haunches and watched Tony's labored breathing. The arc reactor was barely giving off any light and it seemed to dim a bit with every exhale. He wracked his brain about what else he could do to make sure Tony would survive, to make sure he would wake up tomorrow morning ready to bitch at Steve about the accommodations or some other inane issue. But there was nothing else he could think of doing right now and it scared the shit out of him that it might not be enough, that Tony might
Steve pulls his hands away slowly as Tony releases his grip and holds them up in plain sight. Tony is wary, irritated. With Steve? With himself?  But then he smirks and maybe it's a little forced, but then he squeezes his ass muscles and Steve's dick is instantly back in the game. He wraps his hands behind his head to stop them from reaching out again, as Tony starts fucking himself on Steve. Maybe it's a good thing, the added awkwardness, as Steve alternately looks down at Tony jacking himself as he comes down on Steve again and again and up at the ceiling in desperation, needing to last longer. Needing to last because it feels so fucking good to be inside Tony. It feels phenomenal and he is pretty sure he is going to be disappointingly quick about it. He grits his teeth, biting back a groan, trying not to be consumed by the way his hips are rolling up, pressing him deeper into Tony's heat as the man slams himself down. Tony's breathing is getting loud and ragged and its fuel on the fire that is building in Steve. Too rapidly, too soon, but he can't. He can't make it last much longer.
"Ssshhhh," hushed Steve, while putting his own hat on. Tony was about to gripe at him for being shushed, when Steve leaned forward and kissed him on the nose. His lips were surprisingly warm, given how cold it was, and they were a little dry and they took the wind right out of Tony's sails. He snapped his mouth shut as his stomach gave an odd little lurch that was very disconcerting. It was over almost before it began, but Tony was at a loss for words for several interminable seconds. When he managed to lift his eyes to Steve's, Steve was smiling down at him and Tony's stomach repeated the offensive maneuver.
“.... need to get to the public internet access, so for now, just stay close to me, try to saunter more than march in your own private parade. If you can manage a swish.... No, scratch that. Bad idea. Don't get swishy. I don't want to see your attempts at swishy. Just focus on me... Jesus fuck, are these abs for real? ...I mean, just look at me like I am the most fascinating person on this ship.” If Steve had met anyone more fascinating since he woke up from the ice he couldn't remember it now, especially since Stark was still petting his abs, not even anywhere near the wrinkled part of his shirt. He also felt a weird sense of pride that his abs were indeed for real, and that was strange because he could not remember ever feeling anything in particular about his abs before, one way or another.
"Should be here in thirty minutes or so. Excuse me while I go take another shower." And then he made his escape, pretending he couldn't feel Steve's eyes on his back. This was done. This had to be done, for both their sakes.
She and Jarvis apparated away, while Tony cooed at his bike some more and gave Happy detailed instructions how to care for it. Her.
“Yeah,” sighed Steve. “Me too. I like you, Tony. I really do. You’re a good guy.” Then he smiled, and it was so incongruous that Tony almost missed what he said next.
"Jesus fuck, Stark, I thought I'd find you desperate to get out of this freak show, but I see you managed to find some entertainment."
“Couple of bales. They’re heirlooms of a sort. Bit unpractical as far as heirlooms go, though, size-wise , so most of it was sold off a few centuries ago. Louis the 14th apparently loved that shit. Used it in his stables.”
"You're picking this up quick," Tony said. Another side effect of the super serum, Steve supposed. Which he couldn't say, so he settled for another 'uhuh'.
“Right. You want to do the honors?” Tony handed him the processor that was by now somehow infused with Steve’s personality. He took it with a little trepidation. It didn’t feel like it was a part of him or anything, but then again, apparently his own magic neutralized this thing. He wondered how sentient it was and how he’d be able to tell. Tony had made a few upgrades to the bike as well. It stood there, with an air of still anticipation, it’s lines sleek and attractive. With Tony’s help he slotted the jagged piece into the receptacle on the bike. A little shudder went through the frame and the eye in the headlight snapped open. It was an iridescent blue that was a few shades lighter than the midnight hue of the body.
"You're welcome," said Steve, pained. "That is wonderful, but please, I need it first." He said down heavily on a chair, unable to hold himself up any longer, Tony cradled in his arms. "Please, milady, he's dying." His voice broke on the last word.
Tony assured her he had never shed a tear for Jesus, but he was on board with the not fucking. At least these 'dates' would be bearable.
After the dead and dreary landscape he had traveled through for the last two days the opulence of the chamber in front of him hit him like a hammer. The room was so warm the rich tapestries on the walls and the golden candlesticks on the table shimmered in the heat, the smell of roast meat made his mouth water and someone, somewhere was playing a lute. It was like he'd stepped into a different world. It took him a moment to realize that he was being hailed by the two men sitting at the table. Percival was waving a pheasant leg at him and Bors was jumping up exclaiming his disbelief about them having survived. But Steve paid them no attention. Because on the other side of the hall a small procession of veiled women was about to leave the room. One was carrying a candelabra, one a broken sword and one was carrying a lance that looked like it was bleeding. The one in back, though, was holding something that glowed a pulsing blue.
"The stairs are bumpy and I don't want to accidentally touch the dead babies!" The boy gestured at the holes excavated in the walls on either side.
Steve freed up some of the lances Percival's horse carried. He left his shield, because he didn't think it was that suitable for this job and he didn't want to lose it in the waves and have to go diving for it. Tony would look after it for him. Then he loped down the narrow pathway that zig-zagged down the face of the rock.
“And how come your house elves wear clothes?” As far as Steve had understood, they weren’t allowed to, in general. Because then you lost them, or something.
“You still wanna... ?” A little bit of the tension seeped out of him and he looked a little less spooked. “Yeah, okay, in a few days.”
"That won't matter to their fathers and brothers." Bors mumbled it under his breath, but Steve heard him anyway.
By the time they reached the gate Josh was able to walk again, even if he said his head still hurt. "You should probably have it checked," Tony offered. "Sounds like a fun way to spend an afternoon in Rome for your family. Wonder what Italian ERs are like?" Josh and Dane grumbled and wanted to turn towards the exit.
"Maybe I can find an apartment and a simple job in Brooklyn and just lay low for a while,” he continued. “There has got to be something I can do to earn some money, things can't have changed that much. What do you think?" He looked back at Tony.
"Don't worry about me, " Steve interjected, "They haven't caught on yet, by the looks of it. I'll be near the helipad when you get back. Maybe I can scope it out." Tony didn't answer, although the silence sounded disapproving all by itself, so he added: "Confirm, Stark. Or I am going to have to assume your communicator is busted, or out of range, or, you know, underground. And we wouldn't want that again, now would we?"
"It's okay, man. That didn't look like sweet dreams to me." Steve was silent, so Tony barreled on. "My nightmares are about being trapped in a cave in the desert with a hole in my chest and a fuckton of people that want me dead. You?" Steve was quiet so long Tony didn't think he was going to answer when he whispered: "My plane going down into the ocean and then freezing to death." That explained the shivering then.
"But, Sire, I..." Galahad trailed off in sobs. Soft as they were, they pierced the silence. Many of the knights looked uncomfortable.
Wherever the hell that was. He dragged her to the map, but she wasn't too sure about how it worked and the dimensions of it and Tony got really frustrated trying to make her see it. It didn't help that he had used a modern map and the castle they were currently in was located a couple of miles off the coast of East Anglia, under water, which was kind of hard to explain. Eventually, they figured that Caerleon was most likely located in Wales, all the way across the country. If that was were Steve was, Tony was going to have words with him about wandering off in the completely opposite direction of where Tony had gone.
"I have Twitter, Stark. SHIELD has a social media department. You were getting along just peachy with Captain America. Didn't seem like much of a hardship for you to stick around and get cozier."
“It’s okay, Stevie,” he heard the other man whisper, “It’s over. It’s all over, now. We can start new.”
Steve looked at him in disbelief. "You don't have anyone who calls the shots at the scene? Seriously? What about you? Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye? I can see why the Hulk is out, but you all seem competent to lead."
"Does my soul have any value? I would think it would be completely ruined by all the deaths I am responsible for. With all the blood I have on my hands, surely, my soul is a shoo in for you. Why haven't you taken it yet?" He watched the demon ponder his words. He thought there might be a little airflow coming from a shadowy place behind him. Avoiding showing any interest in that, he stepped back a bit to make sure he wasn't mistaken. He needed to keep the demon engaged, though.
“JARVIS, how much ground have we covered, you reckon?” Tony was pacing in his sad and pathetic excuse for a workshop. They'd been here for weeks and Tony had chased off dozens of knights, but Steve had yet to show. He studied the crude map of Great Britain he'd sketched on the far wall. JARVIS had projected it and Tony had traced it (with charcoal of all things). He looked at all the places they'd marked as done.
Steve looked at Clint and then Tony. "Too many. This could turn into a blood bath with a lot of civilian victims, Tony. I think we should get out of here with Hawkeye."
Tony snorted. Such a tragedy nobody would get that reference. Steve would have, Monty Python and the Holy Grail had featured one Avengers' movie night. But Steve wasn't here, that was the whole problem. Tony sighed. Steve also wouldn't have run away from Tony's demon. Actually, Tony best chance might be hoping that Steve would come running to some villagers' rescue once he'd heard about the 'demon', noble idiot that he was.
"And, once you show a personal interest in this trial, someone, somewhere, is going to link those pictures from last spring to Captain Rogers and blast your relationship all over the internet. Interest in Captain America will be frenzied at that point anyway and then it wouldn't even have to be true, but since it
"Then you'd better make it work, Stark. For starters, you will attend all the team meetings and debriefings, and -"
"Take off your pants." Tony's gaze never left Steve's face and he wouldn't move his head, so Steve worried blindly at his button, his fingers trembling and clumsy. It seemed to take an eternity for the button slip through the hole, but the zipper was easier. Tony batted his hands away and started to ease the pants down Steve's hips.
"Steve?" Tony hoisted himself on to their tiny kitchen counter and thoughtlessly drummed his heels against the cabinet. Natasha glared at him and he stopped.
Where was the fucking coffee? Tony looked up to see Steve standing nearby patiently holding out a cup, waiting for him to notice. He grabbed it eagerly and downed it as fast as he could. Strong enough to strip paint, just how he liked it. There was amusement in Steve's expression when Tony looked back up.
"Thor is here to sing to my orchards?" Tony asked flatly. He wondered what the hell had happened to his relatively uneventful life of three weeks ago. "Do I even have orchards?"
"That one is going to be mine already, little man. You are too weak to carry him out of here. I can sense it. So he will die and be mine."
true it was. Tony would burn the world down for less than a handful of people, but Steve was definitely on that list. He wasn't going to lose that man.
Steve's attention was fully absorbed by the stories from the guide, the shocking degree of exposure of her cleavage, and his elderly companion, who was still holding on to his arm and talking about how she was taking her grandchildren on this tour so their parents could have a romantic day in Rome. He had a hard time keeping part of his attention on Tony, who now seemed to be discussing robot dogs with the kid a little ways away and on making sure no one was lurking in the shadows all around them.
“Tony.....” Steve sounded strangled, but he tilted his head for better access and that gesture went straight to Tony's dick.
He looked around at the sea of faces. They were focused on Tony, kind of, but not really. He wondered if Pepper had let it be known that Steve would be here. They looked at him as if he was just the appetizer, pleasing enough, but they were saving their hunger for the main course. It wouldn’t matter what he said, how he told them, they were going to want to hear it from the horse’s mouth. So he told them a nice sanitary version of how he’d acquired Steve, and didn’t even bother embellishing anything. Then, before the questioning could begin, Pepper introduced Steve and everybody forgot Tony was even there. Hell, even Tony forgot where he was for a moment.
Steve rested his elbows on his knees and scratched the back of his neck. He looked straight at the ducks when he replied.
He's too restless to read, now, and doesn't know what to do, but in the end he grabs his sketchbook. He doodles for a bit, just random curves and lines, until he finds himself sketching Tony with tiny screwdrivers sticking out of his mouth and little furrows between his brows as he stares into the innards of Steve's mom's TV. It's actually not a bad drawing. It'd be better if he could put more detail in the eyes, though, he'd have to do a close up. He remembers the smile earlier this evening in his kitchen and wonders, but he doesn't believe he could capture that.
“That's my AI.... Good, it's done.” Stark quickly put the terminal back together, while Steve wondered what an AI was. Tony stood up and fished two stubby things with loops out of his pocket and handed one to Steve. He watched Tony put the loop around his ear so that the stubby thing was sitting snug against it and moved to copy him.
"Do you have a way to get into contact with your commanding officers? Have they said anything, these last few days?"
"That was me being Iron Man. You know this. I went and subdued some terrorists. What's your problem?"
"It's part of the game, Steve. You can have me, but do not come. Can you do that for me?" Steve looked unsure. "I swear to God, Steve, I will never fuck you again if you come before I tell you to.” He paused, then added: “I'll make it up to you later, I promise, babe. Just don't come yet."
Tony decided to go with sarcasm rather than outrage. “Gentlemen! Welcome to my humble abode! To what do I owe this pleasure?”
Rhodey flung an arm around Tony's shoulders. "Not for you, no. But from where I am standing, my man, there is a whole lot of 'welcome to the human race' and 'fucking finally' going on. Tony Stark, brought down by love. Ah, the poetic justice of it!" His other hand grabbed Tony by the face and turned it towards him. Suddenly he looked deadly serious. Tony had been wrong, Rhodey had a poker face worth for shit.
a blow job and desperately he wrapped the hand he wasn't using for fisting the base of Steve's cock, around his own. He came embarrassingly quickly, even before Steve did and the resulting moan around Steve's dick was rewarded by Steve's knees buckling and flooding Tony's mouth with come. His own dick manfully pulsed one more time at the sensation.
Tony snorted and leaned back on his elbow, turning to look at Steve finally. Oddly, there was amusement on his face.
He talks to the young kid at the reception desk that looks too young to have seen active duty, but knows the Military likes them young. The kid tells him Sam is still doing the group, but his schedule is changed. He's left already because he’s doing another group later today in Martinez. Steve turns away, wondering if he should... but it feels like it'd be too much. Like he doesn't have the right to go to a different center, to a different group, to chase after Sam like that. All his nervous energy deserts him in an uncomfortable rush. He'll just go home. He'll try another day. But he knows he may not have the courage again for months. He starts walking to the door.
“Check up on Happy for me, would ya?” Tony buried his face in his hands as he let out trembling breaths.
Tony went “oh” as it clicked what comic Steve was talking about. He had read a lot of those as a kid, even dressed up as the Flash for Halloween one year.
He cleared out what was left of the food, sticking it in the public fridge in case anyone wanted to heat it up for a snack. He shoved the dishes in the dish disposal, where the drones washed, dried, and put them away.
“Still are.” Tony looked up at him. “Though it was kind of annoying, though, having to live up to the great Steve Rogers.”
Clint and Sam were the two navigators. Their previous teams compared their eyes to those of birds, never missing a thing onboard. They once caught a spy creeping through the vents through the ancient cameras that they had at the time.
Tony was almost immediately greeted with Thor’s looming form. He looked at Tony with curiosity before breaking out into a wide smile and giving Tony a bear hug.
Today everybody stayed at the table, Tony being the only absence which is usual for him. He’s the only one with his own kitchen, so maybe he planned it.
Soft, blue eyes and warm, pink lips filled his head. Orange-red hair and a sharp tongue. Oh, Pepper.
Natasha was there with a comforting grin on her face. “You okay?” She asked in a quieter voice, “You get the whole Tony thing sorted out?”
He sat in the wide chair and set his little drawing book at the desk and just stared at it. His fingers itches to draw something, but when he tried to put any thought into it, his mind went blank. He let out a growl of frustration.
He pondered over what could’ve happened to get him in this state. It was always rough once Bruce returned from his Hulk form, stretch marks covering his body, sweat leaking from him like a faucet, his bones jutting out of him like knives, and colder than the arctic. This time he had all the symptoms, but doubled. He was red all over, covering him from head to toe. He was nearly too slick to hold down, making Steve ready to intervene if he was needed. Bruce was shivering so much that he looked as if he were having a seizure, his lips an alarming shade of blue.
Natasha took notice of his certain type of jitteriness and the constant lick of his lips as if recalling an event. No way! she thought.
Tony led them out of the cafeteria and to the medicine bay to the right. They walked in, 4 beds lined up on either wall, little hooks by each one to hold IV bags. At the far end of the room there was a circular pad, probably a scan, as well as a test area in the wall. In the scan you could see someone’s blood type, height, age, weight, etc. the test area was used for research in case there was no immediate or well-known cure. They could inspect a problem, and work as quickly to fix it.
Tony turned to rush outside, but he felt a force hit him from behind. His suit was downloading the files. Shit. Another bang and Tony's world went black.
“I can tell.” Steve moved his arm from Tony’s chest and moved his hand to Tony’s scar. Tony had unbuttoned his shirt and hadn’t removed it completely just to prevent himself from stripping entirely.
“Well, ugh,” Steve stammered. “Well, um. I helped you to bed. I’m sure the details will come to you later.” He gave an awkward smile and left. Tony could’ve swore he saw the imprint of a gun in his waistband.
“He wants you to build the missile. The Jericho missile that your father demonstrated.” One of the men with the guns handed Tony’s fellow prisoner a tiny picture. He showed it to Tony. “This one.”
“I guess you could call it that...” Stark trailed off, placing his hands on his hips. “Look, just roll with it, kid. There isn’t much else I can do. It isn’t up to me.”
Thor liked to ramble, but Tony didn’t mind. More information wasn’t unpleasant if it was about his team.
She waved him in and hurried back to the kitchen where she frantically pulled out a pan from the oven. There were a few beeps before she joined Tony in the living room.
“I don’t have the kind of cash or resources you do. I mean, I was lucky to find the parts to this thing-“ Peter tapped his old, home-built computer “-so being able to make that suit and help people is actually super big for me.”
Bruce’s lips were horribly chapped, the skin peeling and sore. The redness of stretch marks had begun to heal, and he was no longer in a cold sweat.
The man at the front of the group was chubby, and had a small beard on his face. He was clad in green shirts, as well as the men around him.
The computer was similar to one Stark used in his classroom. It looked like a big white block, keys making a weird click as he assaulted them with his fingers. No other teacher had a computer, but they all hated it, preferring a simple chalkboard.
“You just gonna stand there staring at me? Or are you going to yell at me some more?” Tony said, wobbling to his feet.
Steve looked down, and quickly pulling away and settling against the wall. Tony felt a twinge of disappointment, but quickly pushed it down.
Tony shut down the screens, a wave of sorrow crashing over him. He felt Steve’s hand run down his arm, coaxing him closer. Steve pulled him into a hug, rubbing Tony’s back. They comforted each other, resting their heads on each other’s shoulders.
“So, Spider-kid? Spider-boy?” Tony hid the grin that was threatening to expose itself. Peter was leaning against the wall, looking down at the ground.
“Tap this twice, and you got web shooters on the go.” Tony tapped the face of the watch twice, and a little device attached itself to Peter’s organic web shooters. Tony moved Peter’s other wrist to the watch, and another web shooter attached to the other arm.
They began their ride back to the base, Dad chatting with the soldiers escorting them. Tony felt an uneasy feeling hit his stomach.
Tony carefully sat his duffle bag on the desk, pulling out each set of tools and arranging them carefully. He took his pocket set and shoved them into his coat. Throwing the empty duffle bag into his closet, he took off his backpack and began to hang up the sets of clothes. They all had similar shades of blues and blacks, and he also had black socks and two pairs of work shoes. He had a small cap to keep oil out of his hair, as well as a pair of glasses.
Tony found himself drifting off while Steve dared not to shift as to not disturb him. Soon, Steve could hear Tony’s breath, warm and sleepy. Steve had a warm, fuzzy feeling in his chest as Tony’s sleep deepened.
Tony shifted his back against the wall. Steve took his arm, examining his wrists. There were a few scratches that had blood swelling at the edges.
Steve watched Tony fumble with his tools. He chuckled as DUM-E whirred at Tony, with Tony telling them to be quiet.
Steve rushes to the table and pulled up different feeds for Tony’s living room. He turned them off all the time, everybody turned theirs off, but hopefully Tony forgot this one time. Just this once.
Tony sighed and entered the school, taking a right turn to go to the gym. Tightening his grip around his Thermos, he entered the loud gym.
Tony hit the daylights out of his dummy, thoughts running wild, getting angrier and hotter the more he went. One of the only people could relate to just ups and flies away, leaving him to be the brains.
Tony dug through everything he could and turned up empty. Growling with anger and stress, Tony shut down the table with two claps. He stood and walked around a bit.
Steve held Bucky’s shoulders, pinning him down to the cot. He smiled into Bucky’s wild eyes, trying his best to soothe him without words.
“I know. But it wasn’t of too much inconvenience.” Tony dumped the mess into a small chute next to the lab and quietly left.
“He’s already out stopping bank robberies,” Tony started. “We won’t have him do anything too big until he’s ready. We can tell him we’re interested and he can keep doing what he’s been doing.”
Tony became more aware of how close they were. Steve seemed to notice, too. They could feel each other's breath, and their noses almost brushed.
A drunken night wound up with Tony needing Steve to pick out his clothes. And Steve uncovering a hidden truth about Tony’s mental state.
“I’ve seen many wounds like that in my village,” the man stated. “Call them the walking dead. Cause it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.”
The man finished shaving and knelt down by a fire. He fished out a pan and dumped some gruel inside, setting it close to the flames. He politely handed Tony a square cut of a mirror so he could further examine the device lodged in his chest.
!” came a booming voice, followed by a thundering boom as the figure landed on the earth. They spun, eyes widening at the familiar shape lumbering towards them.
“You know, this isn’t how I imagined you taking me to bed,” Tony said as Steve sat in a little arm chair.
“We’re finding more and more ways to better help the environment. I’m hoping that Peter can give insight while also helping with production.” Tony gave her a little smile. “I sent him an email, so I’m sure he knows about the offer.”
“I’ll call you when I need you. Expect mail.” And with that, Tony left the room, leaving an excited and thankful Peter Parker to play with his new toy.
Bucky’s eyes then furrowed as he looked at his missing arm. His mouth started to form a question but no words came. His hand tentatively touched the empty arm under his shoulder. Bucky’s eyes widened in realization before being quickly replaced with anguish.
He scribbled his thoughts into a book so he didn’t forget it. He needed to work out a lot of formulas and would need to do multitudes of research. But he could get it done.
Tony leaned against a table, shock and confusion coursing through him, as well as despair. Did Steve think he was faking it? He thought the kiss had made it pretty clear.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck and fought down the urge to give Tony the biggest hug he’s ever had in his entire life. To talk to him about the most random shit like they usually did. Goof off and insult each other and laugh at each other. When did all of this even start? When had Steve Rogers fallen in love with THE Tony Stark?
Tony turned around in his cot and saw what was restricting his movements. The wires connected him to a small battery laying on a tiny round table right next to him. His breath quickened as he followed the wires to his chest, where a large metal rim protruded out his sternum.
of wielding Mjolnir? Wasn’t I worthy enough to save everyone, to take on the burden, so that Tony wouldn’t have to?”
Months later, General “Hulk-Hater” Ross showed up at the Avengers’ doorstep. Judging from the look on Ross’ face, Tony surmised that it had to do with Rogers.
But this is Steve asking. He had not met Steve since five years ago. He had something good going with Pepper and Morgan. They were the love of his life now. This Tony was an idiot. He had so many ups and downs, only nearing death that he realized he truly loved Pepper Potts. There was never any future with Steve. He made that very clear when he chose Bucky over him.
Steve Rogers travelled through the branches of alternate realities. He was careful not to disturb the other timelines, only observing. He was not sure on what he was doing. In many realities, Tony had a Steve Rogers in existence. In some, Tony was married to Pepper. In others, Tony was dating and eventually married Steve. There was even a few where Tony was with neither and ended up dating Stephen Strange. Steve did not wanted to jump into any of those realities and ruin their happiness.
“I think it could be Steve,” said Bruce who walked in. “I saw him sneaking off in the night. Maybe he didn’t want anyone to know they got back together yet.” He passed another 20 dollar bill to Nat.
So many words left unsaid. He still believe in the freedom to choose, not to follow any one organization's will. He did that once with SHIELD, and it almost cost everyone.
They retired in a cottage in the woods, away from the public eye, where Tony still spent his days in the workshop working the latest invention with Steve helping him out. When he’s not in the workshop, Tony would help Steve cook and clean. After that, they would sit by the couch leaning into each other, watching the telly. Other times, Steve and Tony took turns to surprise one another, whether is an outing, a dance or coming home to giant teddy bear, they made it work. Steve was no longer the man out of time. He had lived a full and happy life with Tony. Once Tony had eventually passed, he knew it was time to return back to his own timeline.
They held each other in their arms, swaying to the rhythm. Steve was still not a good dancer but it was the best dance he ever had.
The news showing on tv reported Steve’s sighting with the others taking down the a bunch of enhanced villains with snake DNA who called themselves the Serpent Society. Everyone escaped unscathed from their last encounter. Tony and Vision never talked about it but he had a suspicion Wanda had a role in convincing Vision to let them go. While still suspicious of Tony, Ross continued to chase Steve’s team but they had no chance of successfully bringing down any of them.
“Righttt. How does Shawarma sound? Tonight, I know a place. I actually don’t know what it is but I wanna try it.”
Tony cleared his throat. It was then Vision broke off from his momentary trance state to face Tony. ‘Oh, Tony. I…did not expect to find you here.’
“Okay, so two more left. Both Steve and Stephen are very special to me. One is the co-leader of the Avengers while the other protects the world through magic. They could not be anymore different from one another. Steve is an optimist who believes the best in people while Stephen’s snark and wit gives me a run for my money,” said Tony. Both Steve and Stephen nodded with a shrug.
Peter quickly signaled the others. “Quick! He’s done with his call! He’s turning around! Hide the board!”
The bullets stopped coming. Tony reopened his visor. ‘Thank you Tony. And...if  you need me, us, you know how to reach me,’ said Steve.
Peggy opened the door and stared at him. It was not often that Peggy Carter was speechless. “It’s me,” Steve said. She teared up and hugged him tightly.
Loki smirked and immediately swung opened the door wide with the Avengers all outside the door froze, caught in the act.
Clint eyed Tony as he walked out of the room to take a call. Tony had been doing that quite frequently, going out of meetings at times.
General Ross briefed Tony on their latest sighting in Moscow. Ross made it sound as if his team were sufficient to bring down Team Cap, and that he was only extending the invite to Tony and the others to serve as backup for the capture. But both Ross and Tony knew that the Avengers were the only ones qualified to bring them in. Tony went along.
Despite the fact that he hated Cap for not telling him about the nature of his parents’ murder, Tony still let the Star Spangled man break out his team from The Raft because he knew it was the right thing to do. While he still believed signing on the Accords was still the best path, it just wasn’t right to see his team mates,
‘But you do,’ Steve pointed out. ‘That’s why you’re here alone. That’s why you haven’t killed me yet.’
“Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange. This one really came out of nowhere but I suppose love comes to find you when you least expect it. When we started out, the level of snark between us -”
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Peter took a deep breath. “I wanted to ask, who is your new boyfriend? Cause...see...we know you’re seeing someone, but we just don’t know who it is.”
Tony never expected for his invention to work. But it did. He could navigate through the Quantum Realm and time travel.
There was only once where Steve intervened where an alien assassin was aiming at Tony from behind. Tony did not see it and was helmetless. This reality did not have a Steve Rogers. Tony was the only leader of the Avengers.
Tony still maintained eye contact with Steve’s bright blue eyes. He was still so pissed at Steve for what he had done. But looking at Steve now, Tony hoped that he would find it in himself someday to forgive Steve. ‘Okay, Stars and Stripes, I need you to pick up that pig stick of a weapon and fire it at me once I’m fully suited up.’
“Did someone say betting?” said Scott who walked in. “Count me in for double.” Giving Nat a piece of 20.
‘I miss her,’ stated Vision. Tony stopped on his tracks. He couldn’t face Vision. Instead, he replied ‘I know’ and walked out.
“Yea and I was all about ‘We don’t trade lives’. Look at Nat, and Tony. I was supposed to protect him, I couldn’t give him the happiness he deserved but at least he would be alive, living with Pepper, seeing Morgan grow up. What is even the
“You did not. You tried. Everyone did. We won and the universe is saved...just that there’s a cost to pay”
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A firm grip held him tight, supporting him. He turned to see Steve Rogers’ blue eyes staring right back at his. He can’t think about him now, not after what happened. He needs to find Pepper.
“Bunch of tired old wheels. I got nothing for you, Cap. I’ve got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero, zip, nada. No trust,
Tony let out his breath that he had been holding in. ‘To be honest, I don’t know what I want. I thought I had found something as close to a family with the Avengers. And then, you had to lie to me. Time and time again you chose your metal arm friend over me. Speaking of him, where is he? Where is
“Home of one Doctor Strange,” grinned Peter. “I know that place cause I have been hanging out there recently. He has a lot of cool stuff and I’m trying to do magic.”
“The Ben and Jerry’s ice cream? What is he doing with pizza and ice cream? Another date with Cap?” wondered Scott.
This is so inappropriate. Well, he had gotten used to it when Tony used to flirt with him on comms during the mission. He used to blush at Tony’s comments and his teammates would laugh. “Urghh. Get a room already you two.” He couldn’t suppress a smile forming on his face.
He stood up, went to turn on the music record, and extended his hand to Peggy. “But for now, Peggy, would you care to have this dance with me?”
“Is it bad to say I like them both?” said Thor. Everyone was silent. “What? I’ve had a lot of time on my hands ok? I
Everyone in the room went silent, they went through the first hour or so justifying who is Tony’s Boyfriend. Granted there was no way of knowing for sure as each candidate had their strong points. The only way was to ask Tony himself. That lead to another hour of cold feet with some of them wanting to jump ship and change their bets.
Seeing there was nowhere to run, they decided to make their stand against Tony. He landed and opened his visor, seeing them eye to eye.
“No do overs.” They failed their shot at getting the Tesseract. Tony said he knew where they could get another shot at the stone and get more Pym Particles. Immediately, he understood what Tony meant. 1970. The old SHIELD base. Scott was not convinced it would work. If it failed, both of them would be stuck in that timeline forever.
“By the twist of fate, Loki and I have shockingly become good friends. He, a Prince, and I, Playboy Billionaire, have bonded through lost, betrayal and what not. We’re divas who know morally grey decisions very well and he is one of the rare few I’m comfortable talking about it. We have chemistry but ultimately because we tend to be self destructive, we’re bad for one another,” explained Tony.
Nat gave Thor an impressed look. “Astute observation, Thor. That would’ve been my initial guess too. But I’m thinking it’s the Doctor.”
The Star Spangled team had split up, leaving Vision and Ross’ men to chase Clint, Nat and Wanda down. Rhodey was still in recovery. Tony and the other half of Ross’ team was left to pursue Rogers, Sam and Scott. In flight, Tony quickly ditched Ross’ goons as he pursued the trio to an abandoned warehouse.
“Guess we’ll have to,” shrugged Clint as he fired an arrow to the roof, only for the arrow to bounce off. “Guess not. It’s warded.”
Steve came out to think. Their experiment with time travel courtesy of Bruce and Scott had failed. Tony was right.
“We spy on Tony,” said Nat. “We have three possible candidates, we just need to take turns to covertly observe who is Tony Stark’s new boyfriend.”
“Well, all three of them will be back from that mission by tomorrow morning so we’ll begin tomorrow,” said Rhodey.
A couple of more months down, Tony spent his time supporting Rhodey on his journey to recovery. He had to admit that his good friend was coping well, all things considered. He could now walk slowly without support which was fantastic seeing as the doctors were initially not optimistic that he could walk again.
Peter climbed through a window on the side. That was his usual hidey hole when he snuck up here to spend more time studying magic than Doctor Strange would normally allow.
“And I’m a tech genius. In theory, we could’ve been worlds apart but somehow we were brought together,” said Tony. Stephen did not care what anyone thought anymore. Right now all he wanted to do was kiss his boyfriend, Anthony Edward Stark, and he did.
voice echoed in Tony’s head. Tony eye-rolled to himself and deliberately tried to brush it aside. He looked up and saw Cap’s shield staring back at him. The shield looked to be in pretty good shape except for the three deep cat claw marks courtesy of T’Challa. As mysterious as the nation itself, the Black Panther slipped back to its Wakandian civilisation. Tony wished he could have had a longer chat with King T’Challa.
“It doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t mean anything,” Scott repeated like a mantra.
He crept up where he could hear laughter and chatter. He hid himself by the stairs, out of Mr. Stark and Doctor Strange’s sight.
The quarters was mostly silent these days. Most of them were on the run. Nat went into hiding, presumably she met up with her buddy Clint and the rest of Star Spangled Club. Rhodey spent most of his time in rehab training to walk again. That left the Vision.
Sam looked stunned as he turned to Bucky who gave him a nod of approval. It was never Bucky’s intention to take over for Steve. Bucky had lived his life in war and chaos. Now, he wants to live out the rest of his life in peace. The White Wolf will come when called but it was never the life Bucky had wanted.
“Oh, that reminds me…” said Steve as he took out his shield from the wrapper and handed it to Sam. “Try it on.”
Steve could not fulfill the vow he took on to protect Tony. He tried. It took everything in him to charge towards Thanos. To get Tony out of the way. He could not make it. Tony took the stones. His last words “I am Iron Man” and snapped all of Thanos’ forces into dust. An eye for an eye. He saw Peter go up to a dying Tony who couldn’t say anything. It shattered Steve’s last resolve. Pepper touched her forehand tenderly towards Tony. “Tony. Look at me. We’re going to be okay. You can rest now.”
A sports car was heading towards the Base at top speed. He finds himself smiling already. There he is. Smug bastard already accurately guessing they could not fix the Doidge proposition.
Despite the public display of affection, the Avengers were happy for Tony who finally found love in his life. After all that he had sacrificed for the universe, it’s the least the universe could do. That, and the rolls of cash that was discreetly going through an exchange in hands to those who had won the bet.
The next day, Peter, Scott and Clint were on TBF duty. “Why are we even still on this?” said Scott. “I mean it is pretty obvious who’s Tony’s boyfriend is from yesterday.”
Sam stood and observed while Bucky had a knowing smile. “Sooo...did something go wrong? Or did something go right?”
He tells Pepper about it. If only Pepper told him to stop and forget about this whole thing, he would. But Pepper isn’t selfish, she knows how important this is. And he knows he is the team’s best chance of success. Otherwise, if they don’t take care of the Doidge proposition he may just end up looking after a bunch of Avenger babies. Literally.
“Well, thank you, Steve Rogers. For saving me today. Hey, you wanna grab a meal with me? As a thank you, I mean.”
Tony, Scott, Bruce and himself were travelling back to the Battle of New York, where all three Infinity Stones were in existence. Bruce goes off to collect the Time Stone. Steve himself has to retrieve the Mind Stone from then Loki’s scepter. That left Tony and Scott in charge of the Space Stone Tesseract.
“The movie or the tv series?” asked Scott “Cause I’ve watched both and I gotta say I like the movie a little more.”
Steve could spend hours talking to Peggy. He wanted to know what happened in her life and she wanted him to tell her all of about his. He could stay here. Live his life with Peggy like he had always wanted. As he told Peggy about his post-frozen adventures, he realized that a lot of the moments he remembered and treasured mostly revolved around
’ Cap’s words continued to haunt Tony. Rhodey almost died. Hell, anyone could have just as easily died.
Steve broke his eye contact and looked away from Tony the moment he mentioned Bucky. ‘He’s...somewhere where he can’t harm anyone. You have my word.’
Tony continued to stare at the news screen. There was so much on his mind now. Thor came back momentarily to warn them of the impending arrival of Thanos, the supposed force behind the manipulation of the Infinity Stones. He had seen the destruction from just one stone. He didn’t want to think what six of them would do.
Tony had been effectively dodging his calls and efforts to apprehend Rogers and his team. If Tony had put his mind to it, there was no way that Rogers and the others would have evaded capture for so long.
Tony folded his arms. “Really? That roach better be the size of Tremors for the Avengers to freak out. Anyways since everyone is out, and I suppose nobody wants to go back in. Meeting is postponed till tomorrow.”
Tony feigned innocence. “That is a very sudden and private question to ask, kid. And what do you mean by ‘we’?”
Steve added “And after what we’ve been through, I only want what’s best for Tony. Someone who fully accepts Tony, appreciate and love him for who he is.”
Despite all odds, they made it back with the Tesseract. After experiencing what they’ve been through, Steve vowed that he’d do whatever it takes to protect Tony so that he could have his happy ending.
Steve question him? He would’ve told them if the big Purple Nutsack said anything. They didn’t even lose. They were flat out beaten.
“Well, after I put the stones back, I thought, maybe I’ll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.”
“Because we agreed to three days and three days it is,” said Clint. “Though I am looking forward to the payout,” he added. Scott high fived Clint.
“We’re betting on who’s Tony’s new boyfriend. You see him over there talking and all smiley? Nat says he has a new boyfriend. I’m betting that he got back together with Steve,” said Clint.
“We know about the bet. We saw the board and we were onto you from the very beginning,” said Stephen. The dawn of realization spread across all of their faces.
Steve stayed silent while Rhodey tried to hush Tony to sit back in his wheelchair. Tony had not even realized he had stood up. He barely registered the comment he made to Carol.
Steve felt nostalgic being back at the base after so long, in this timeline no less. Tony went to obtain the Tesseract in the vault while Steve was tasked with getting the Pym Particles. While Hank was distracted, he took enough for both of them to get home.
“You can’t save everyone. Thor couldn’t and he’s a god. Thanos pretty much thought he was a god and he wasn’t omnipotent. Some day, Steve, you have to find it in yourself to forgive yourself.”
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
‘Well, as much as I’m tempted to join your underground rave band, someone has to stay behind to keep an eye on Ross and to be the official face of the Avengers. Can’t exactly tell him that I let you guys go now, can I? Okay, come on, let’s make it real.’
“Okay.” Pete went back outside and sat on the step once more beside Hank. Claire led them to her office where a sheet of paper was already waiting on her desk. Turning the page around she explained that it was a permission form that Steve and Tony had to sign accepting responsibility for Pete and his actions and safety for the weekend. Once they were done, they went back outside to collect Pete from Hank.
Tony and Steve had also bought a nightlight that projected stars onto the ceiling, as well as a bookshelf full of books. Steve had stopped them at that, not wanting to overwhelm Pete with too many new things at once.
“I think we should do all that we can to assist this child,” Thor said. “I will help whenever I am on Midgard and at the tower. It may not be often, but I will help turn this child into a true warrior.”
“Alrighty, then off we go,” Tony said, slinging a small backpack over his shoulder and handing the suitcase to Steve.
“Oh Pete, that’s… very sweet,” Steve said weakly, saddened that Pete wasn’t sure they would want him. “We want you very much, Pete. That’s why we’re all here today, okay?”
“I believe he’s speaking at a University today,” Natasha said, craning her neck so that she could see the giant electronic chart on the wall.
Banner was startled from his work. “I see you got it running.” Addressing Friday, he said, “My name is Dr. Bruce Banner. Is everything running okay?”
“Bruce...” Steve felt a twinge of guilt, for he hadn’t thought about the scientist for a while. “We did the best we could,” Steve was convincing himself as well as Tony. “He’s spent years in hiding. If he wanted to be found he would’ve let us get him.”
Tony ran happily into the house as Rosa pulled up, throwing open the door and tossing his bag in his room.
Steve smiled at the memory, making his feat a million times more difficult. He looked towards the door to the hallway and his heart dropped. He had to do this.
Tony sat in the lab, staring at his phone as if he were expecting someone to call. He had unbuttoned his shirt, leaving it flowing, and a pancake still sat on one table, stale and cold.
“Hey! I might have a new recruit!” Tony sat aside his book and pulled out his little high-tech hologram phone and showed a few images of the Spider-Man.
Steve had left for the meeting, dressed in his sharpest suit, Natasha sporting a comfy red shirt and a leather jacket. Tony waved them off before escaping to his room.
Tony let out a sigh as a familiar song began to play. He couldn’t remember the name, but it made him nostalgic.
“You can’t stop love, Tones,” Rhodey said with a soft smile. “It just leaves you hurt worse in the end.”
If only he had his own little stash of vibranium. Then he could get his team tip-top gear and the world would be safer. But he knew what would happen, what always happens. He would make something intended to help, but instead somebody would use it for their own twisted purposes.
One of the drones accidentally bumped into him, making a little worried whir as if it were trying to apologize. Tony set his hand under it, allowing it to rest on his palm. He smiled, giving it a little pat. Tony sat the drone- who gave a cheerful buzz- down on the counter, which prompted it to finish its tasks.
Tony always waited for Bruce’s return, even though the others have lost hope. He has Friday constantly check for possible signs of him, weather it be Bruce in needy villages, or Hulk desperate to keep himself from harming others.
There was some chatter outside before the door was violently swung open, revealing burly guards and several men in green uniforms, and some in formal suits.
“This will be a bit cold at first. Don’t flinch away,” Richards instructed, pulling the patches off the fake arm and gently setting it against Bucky’s bare skin.
Blood splattered onto Tony’s face, and he sat there in horror. His Mom and Dad were dead. Anywhere he went he could die. Outside seemed safer than inside, despite the pressing gunfire.
Steve had his arm wrapped around Tony’s chest, his other hand petting Tony’s hair. His legs were propped up on the coffee table, burger wrappers and napkins littered at his feet. Tony’s legs were stretched across the couch and over the arm.
Tony unbuckled himself from the seat against the wall and stretched out his limbs. The others did the same, ten seats against two adjacent walls. The floor was a solid metal, yet warm to the touch. Faded yellow lines crisscrossed the whole floor, a small set of steps leading down to the large, industrial-sized elevator on the other side of the room.
“They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That’s how I’ve done it, that’s how America does it, and it’s worked out pretty well so far.”
Nat started to help Steve, but he forced her to help Tony first. She got the chains off them, supporting Tony with one of his arms across her shoulders and holding him up with another hand under his armpit.
Steve opened the door and nearly fell back in shock. Tony had a fist raised, poised to knock, a look of nervousness on his face. Tony looked equally surprised to see Steve.
Steve looked up again and locked eyes with Tony. He licked his chapped lips, rubbing his hands as this- this feeling- filled the room. He wasn’t sure if he was supposed to act on it, or if he was supposed to ignore it until it passed.
The mountainside erupted as they made contact. Large explosions set off, sending a cascade of dirt and rock shooting up into the air. Dust billowed closer until a wave hit them, making Dad step forward to regain his balance, and made Tony’s hat fly off his head.
Steve twiddled his thumbs, his leg bouncing wildly as Natasha zoomed down the interstate. Rock music was blasting over the radio and Nat jammed out to the different songs.
Tony caught the skidding bottle. He looked to Steve, who let him take the first sip. Tony was careful to leave enough for Steve, and Steve left enough to last them for the next day.
“It’s not a onesie,” he defended himself. “And it’s nothing you need to be worried about.” He pushed himself off the wall, and went to sit at his desk chair.
Tony slid against Steve's side. He was much softer than Tony expected. Steve wrapped his arm around Tony's torso, pulling him closer.
Steve started a rough sketch. It was of Tony with a finger tapping his chest and another holding a book. It was a 3/4 perspective. Tony sitting in a skinny chair like the ones in his room. He started with the anatomy. The legs were crossed at the ankles, forearms resting on the arms of the little chair he sat in. His black brows furrowed in concentration, his lips slightly pursed. The drawing was darker in tone, more shadows around the eyes and nose.
Tony’s grip on Steve’s shirt slowly loosened and he shifted it to Steve’s hip. Steve deepened the kiss, lifting Tony slightly off the ground as he lost control of his emotions.
Steve gave a smirk as Tony started eating. He washed his plate and fork, putting them away. He started to the door when Tony stopped him.
Apparently, Bucky had lost his arm in a shipping accident, when a cargo crate landed on the shoulder joint. It was replaced soon after with a strong, bionic arm.
“Imma fix you right up. The mean people hurt you, hmm,” Tony spoke to the plumage. He let out a grunt as the wrench finally got it loose. Fixing up the pipes, he muttered little words of comfort.
“Well, Tony. Care to walk with me to the medical bay? I need to set up there before lunch.” Banner grabbed two large backpacks, as well as toating a small duffle over his shoulder.
Tony blew a raspberry at Friday as Steve half-carried half-dragged him to the bathroom. He sat Tony down on the toilet seat and went to fetch some clothes.
“To show off the Jericho missile! We’ve worked hard for this,” Dad said. He rose to his feet to stand beside Tony. “If you didn’t get that repulsor system up and running that thing would have never been able to work.”
“Alright, don’t get your panties in a twist.” Tony put the eye goggles to his face, finding it darker than any pair of sunglasses he’s ever owned. “How do you see through these.”
Pietro and Wanda were poking and laughing at each other. Clint and Natasha were talking quietly amongst themselves, looking to be deep in conversation. Pietro looked over at Tony and seemed to look confused.
There was a thud as Tony was yanked back to the ground. Tony let out a growl of frustration as he began to tug at the shackles, clawing his skin in the prosses.
Tony let out his pent-up anger on his training dummy that he had set up in his lab. Using his different techniques, and slapping the hell out of it.
Tony jabbed the button for the Work floor. Banner swayed a little on his feet as he waited for the doors to open. When they did, Banner and Tony were greeted by Steve and Bucky, who were happily chatting away.
He filled a little bag with ice, bandaging his hand, securing the ice on his knuckles. Tony winced at the sudden cold and sting on his damaged fist.
Tony set to work. His mind powered down as he let himself bake. Doing this was the only kind of a break he got. The beep of the oven rang out and Tony slipped the pan of brownies in. He sat at his table to wait.
“Hey, hey!” interrupted the man in the purple shirt. “Impressive resumes, right? Kinda done this before.”
Tony let out a sigh. “Let me put my suit away first.” Steve tried, and failed, to keep the smile off his face.
Steve was snapped out of his daze by the loud noise of the bath water running. Steve sat the gun on the table and threw away the last bottle before grabbing Tony a glass of cold water.
"Exactly," Sam beamed. "Like all the normal people do. Remember it's important to make an effort to do the normal things that normal people do, Steve. Fitting back in, my man, can't slack off on the fitting in."
. And which you don't now! When you need to know what I think, you need to fucking talk to me, not decide what is best for me all by yourself. I hate it when people think they know what is best for me." Tony paused for breath, then barreled on. "If this relationship is to work you have to stop retreating into your own head."
"Well, Sir Stephen is guaranteed to find it, so I am sure God will not lead him astray no matter which way we go." Percival's voice interrupted Tony's thoughts.
Four beers later though, when both military dudes had relented and relaxed and were trading war stories like old pals, he leaned close to Steve's ear and whispered just loud enough: "Permission to suck you,
When they were completely naked, they paused and looked at each other. Then Steve wrapped himself completely around Tony and buried his face in the crook of Tony's neck. Tony hid his face in Steve's, reveling in all the skin on skin contact that went a long way toward making up for the months of separation. He felt his throat constrict and his eyes brimmed suspiciously. He angrily rubbed them on Steve's neck until Steve lifted his chin and forced him to meet his eyes. Seeing the same tremulous emotion there, he forced himself to stop trying to hide his own. Then Steve smiled at him, that big warm smile that had short circuited Tony's defenses from day one. Day two at the latest. It should have scared the beejezus out of him, the realization that his defenses were down, that Steve could reach in and rip his heart out if he wanted. But the flash of panic he'd expected didn't manifest. Instead of feeling weak and scarily vulnerable, he felt like he could take on the world, exposed heart and all.
“Oh, for chrissakes, Steve. I already know your demon dreams were about me. I don't care! I mean, shit, I care... but -”
"I am trying to decide," Tony suddenly croaked by his ear, "if you think I am so out of it that I am not going to remember anything you said or if you are going claim I must have been delirious if I ever dare to refer to what you've been telling me."
They stopped for a gelato on the way back and Tony badgered him to try anything but vanilla, so Steve rolled his eyes at him and consented to try the peach gelato and wow, was that an awesome choice. Tony had had more espresso than was strictly advisable, ducking into coffee bars for 30 seconds at a time, which was apparently enough to complete that transaction, and he was almost vibrating next to Steve as they made their way to an electronics shop JARVIS had found for them.
“Tried that,” Tony said with the faraway voice of someone distracted by other thoughts, “Didn’t work. It’s like I cancel out my own magic. Don’t know why, you’d think it’d be squared if there was any reaction at all, but it really does nullify itself. Gotta figure that out someday. My processor is over there.” He waved over towards an alcove that Steve hadn’t even noticed yet. Admittedly, things had been a bit chaotic. “I was hoping Bruce could use it, but it doesn’t like Bruce much, apparently.”
Actually, she wasn't half bad. The guy though, he was no Kenny Rogers. Tony wished for the eleven hundredth time that he and 'Del' weren't almost last on the billet. Or that Hydra would just fucking show and distract him from the urge to crawl into Steve's lap.
By the time the movie ended it was just the two of them. Still with the two inches between them as if neither of them had noticed they now had space to spread out.
"I needed to get away. I needed to stop feeling manipulated." It wasn't an answer, but in a way it was.
He still flinches when Tony barges in again with a toolbox that is admittedly far fancier than Steve's mom's. Tony eyes him oddly, but says nothing.
There was a whole lot of nothing. The walls were made of irregularly shaped rocks and the floor of irregularly shaped slate paving stones. The ceiling beams were unadorned wood. There was no sign that his building had ever functioned as a chapel, or anything else, really. Finally, in the far corner, he noticed one of the pavers wasn't actually a paving stone, but a dark metal manhole cover. He knelt next to it to explore it from closer up.
Tony planted his feet on the coffee table and enjoyed watching Steve delightedly explore them all, while the man kept one eye on the big screen and Tony was glad he'd found another multi tasker to watch a movie with, because honestly, how anybody ever expected him to just sit there for two hours and passively take in a story at a pace that was inevitably too fucking slow, was beyond him.
“Did you tell him you’re the savior of the wizarding world and I’ll hex his feet off if he doesn’t stop?” Draco stage whispered.
He pointedly doesn't go looking for Tony, even though he can hear the hammer ring very faintly in the distance when he drinks his coffee outside, looking at the quietly chewing goats that are still behind his house. He curses at every little traffic snarl on his way to school, even though it isn't even worth the word 'traffic' in this little town. His students are looking at him wide eyed all day, they've never seen him like this, restless, distracted and irritable.
"I dunno, Nat." Clint spoke up and nothing good had ever come of that. "It sounds to me like they are breaking up."
Steve felt old, all of a sudden. Young people, always so convinced they knew right from wrong. Then, with a stab of shame, he remembered himself telling Tony how self centered he was, hours before the man flew a nuke through a portal into outer space to save everyone in New York City. Okay, so maybe not so young people could be righteous asses too.
"That's not what I asked. Do they send a report of findings? Coordinates searched? Ultrasound logs?"
“Excuse you? You should be flattered Gryffindor has stooped to putting up your defenseless sleeping ass.”
"Fine, fine. I'll behave. I'll have you know I could have come up with at least 20 more minutes of chaps related jokes and innuendo, though. You're missing out. Okay, bring me the chaps, Captain Underpants."
From his vantage point Steve could see the small tailor immediately stiffen up and draw himself up to into a silent bristle. Then Tony sailed into his line of sight with a man in tow who was tall and slender and had floppy green hair. This was obviously a sign of trying too hard, in Steve’s opinion. This guy went rigid too, puffing up his chest a little.
Before Percival could answer a white boat came sailing up out of nowhere, with a white hermit on board who hailed them.
Tony obediently turned his head and spit into Steve’s palm. Steve smiled at him as if he had done something remarkable, and, man, they were a pair of besotted idiots. Then Steve lifted his hips up to make some space and brought his hand down to slick up Tony’s cock with spit. Oh god, that felt
Tony gently pushed Tasha aside, after she had come running to attack his shoelaces. Clint was staring at him from his perch on the loft bed and Thor was asleep on the radiator, of course. He went back out the door. Steve followed him in the robe in two minutes flat and Tony led him through the kitchen where Clint was chopping petulantly and Natasha was pouring milk in a small pot, and down the hall to the shared bathroom. They had a shower stall and two sinks and an old washing machine in the room. Thor was unloading his load of laundry when they came in. He showed Steve the shower and told him to use anything that was marked with TS in sharpie (and under no circumstances to touch any bottles that were labeled NR, on the pain of death) and then waited until the robe and towel were flung over the door and the water turned on. He was about to leave when Thor spoke.
Steve forced himself to grab Tony by the hair and pull him off. Tony whined in protest. He looked dazed, his mouth a wreck, swollen and bruised. And Steve wanted him so badly he felt completely lost.
Pepper smiled her sweetest smile. “Somewhere all those noble urges to save people are much appreciated. Oh, wait. That's Steve, not you. You will have a much more difficult time, I'm afraid. It's really not a good place for you.”
“Why the hell is he using a SHIELD phone and not the StarkPhone I gave him? And J, what the fuck? You can’t just call Steve, it’s-” A shot glanced the armor’s shoulder. “Fuck! This is not the time, people!”
He felt drained and uninterested in research at the moment. And also like he should go back to the US, and either take an interest in Stark Industries or untangle himself altogether. Not that he wanted to, particularly, but it was like an anchor weighing him down, until he’d either hoist it up or cut the chain. His life in Delft, that had rooted him so firmly not even half a year ago, felt like it was shedding clumps of dirt as it was slowly being pulled from the soil.
Steve flushed a little and quickly looked away.Tony tried to rein in his reeling head and refocus on the conversation, but Steve’s hand wrapped around his under the table and just like that Tony lost all semblance of coherent thought. Steve’s hand was warm and a little rough and it possessed the ability to make several thousand of Tony’s nerve endings sing at once. When Steve’s thumb rubbed a little circle on the back of his hand he thought he might spontaneously combust. His mind was spinning in circles. What did this mean? Was it the same as when they held hands the other night? It didn’t
“Just so you know,” he panted, tearing his mouth away from Steve momentarily, “I'm calling dibs on your virginity.”
“I guess,” Tony wondered where their mother was. If they still had one. “I guess I better get something to clean them up with, and something we can use as a litter box.” He left Steve with the kittens and went back to the the kitchen. Bruce had left and it was empty. He got some paper towels and then decided on confiscating the plastic tub they had in the sink for washing the dishes. It was pretty beat up anyway and he’d be able to get a new one for a couple of guilders at Blokker on Monday. Then he checked his pantry shelf. He had the half loaf he’d purchased this morning to get him through the weekend. It wouldn’t last if he shared, but he still had some bread that was a couple of days old. He could always toast that.
Jarvis shot a quick glance a Steve, who clutched his blanket a little closer in a faint attempt at modesty.
Twenty minutes later his hunch proved to be correct. Just when they were about to start the rumba, their potential contact entered the ballroom together with a pretty woman in a stylishly embroidered tunic and a headscarf. They asked and were granted permission to join in the class, but it was obvious they weren't there just for the dancing. Every time Steve looked their way, they were staring back at them. It was a little unnerving and trying to learn the Rumba at the same time was a challenge, to say the least.
“Winter Solstice. Gotta go do a thing, tonight.” He hoisted himself up on his elbows and that didn’t feel so good on Steve’s shins. He jostled Tony to get him off.
With considerably less enthusiasm he made his way to the table. It was going to be a long, lonely three weeks.
“Alright. If that is all, you'd best get on your way. We'll send the files with you so you can read them while your hair dye is setting and we'll meet in the morning before your flight.”
“Shush, you. He doesn’t need to know that. Steve, why are you still standing here? The vultures are circling.” Several men and women did seem to be on a glacial drift towards Tony’s corner.
The next thing Tony noticed was that he was being divested from his shirt. He obediently lifted his arms and was rewarded by Steve’s hands roaming up and down his torso, goosebumps trailing in their wake. He tugged at Steve’s shirt again, feeling impatient, but having lost the coordination to effectively do anything about it. Thankfully, Steve took pity on him and reached behind his back with one hand and pulled the shirt off in one fluid motion. Wow. That would never not be sexy. Same for Steve’s torso. His lack of body fat sharply delineated every single muscle, and Tony felt a little inadequate in comparison. Not that Steve agreed, by the way he touched Tony almost reverently.
"I don't know the particulars, " said Tony, "But you're obviously dying to make a grand statement starting with the words 'you people' and I was about to expire from the anticipation, so I thought I'd help you get started."
His landing in the Malibu workshop was sloppy and Steve stumbled across the floor with an ungainly stagger that made it overtly clear his muscles were barely functional from the cold. Good thing they weren't doing this in front of the paparazzi; speculations about drunken debauchery would be everywhere. Tony lifted his face plate and glared at Steve, as he struggled upright after picking up the shield he had dropped.
"My lawyers should be here in a minute. Then we'll talk. In the meantime let me show you the helicarrier upgrades I've been working on. How do you feel about tasers....?"
"I am trying not to. But I do wonder why you'd want to spend so much time going to parties and dating supermodels when you could be a full time member of the Avengers." Steve uncrossed his arms and put his forearms on the table, interlocking his fingers. He leaned towards Tony. There was something very close to wistful in his eyes. "I would think being an Avenger would be worthy of more of your attention and, yes, commitment." Tony relaxed a bit. This wasn't about him so much, apparently, as it was about Steve, who was.... almost jealous, it seemed. He leaned forward too. Another couple started in on
He made himself go through tactical exercises in head, while he stubbornly kept his gaze on the candle on the table. He was annoyed with himself at how often his mind wandered to the man sleeping on his shoulder even when he wasn't looking at him and as he got more sleepy he had wrench himself away from the that kissing fantasy a couple of times. But he didn't push Tony off.
Three days it had taken, McGonagall had said. Steve couldn’t even imagine doing this after something like that.
"You can be whoever you want to be in your Oz, Tony, although really, you're much more of a Glinda than a Wicked Witch of the West. In
“And yet, Pepper is arguably more your creation than you are Howard's. Tony, the man donated a sperm cell, he didn't
He could see Tony gather the shreds of his dignity together as if it were an expensive cloak. He shot Steve another dirty look while he did so. Then he sighed.
Tony eventually learned not to react to the things Steve was saying when he blew up and also not to try and convince him of the insignificance of the transgression, but to soothe the anxiety that was buried under the anger. That helped diffuse the situations much better and the angry episodes became much more manageable after that. Steve eventually stopped trying to pack his stuff and leave after every outburst, when he’d finally accepted that Tony was having none of that.
He resigned himself to being supremely uncomfortable for however many hours it would take to get back home.
“JARVIS, can you run this guy through the database? Do we know him?” There was a moment of silence, because JARVIS was a little slow on the ship.
They camped on top of a small tor which provided them a good view of the surroundings. Steve had second watch and positioned himself with the camp fire at his back so as not to spoil his night vision. He stared at the undulating landscape, oppressive in its blackness, with the fingernail moon hiding behind the clouds and not a light in sight. No orange glow from cities over the horizon, no cars with headlights, no streetlights. His sense of displacement often hit hardest on nights like this when there was nothing else to distract him. In the light of day, he could not escape the fact either that he was currently living in the Middle Ages, but at least there was little room for agonizing when he was hunting boar or doing sword drills or any of the other tasks that were required of the knights. As often as he told himself that he'd essentially done this time travel thing before, so he should be used to it, it didn't help with reconciling himself to the situation. He had just started to understand the difference between Apple and Android, and now he was having to learn to keep a calendar by memorizing saints' names. As a result he wasn't quite sure how long he'd been here, but it had been more than a year, judging by the passing of the seasons.
He wrote and edited non-stop for a month. Then he and Yinsen picked a date for his defense in October and sent out the thesis manuscripts to the committee. And then he was done. There was nothing left to do but wait until the manuscript came back from the committee members, and then he’d have to send it to a printer. It was like swimming underwater the whole length of the pool and coming up to find everyone had left, him hanging off the edge of the pool, breathing hard, while staring out over the empty expanse of concrete. He didn’t know what to do with himself now that the project was finished. He considered traveling, or even gardening. He thought he’d probably ought to start a new project, but he was almost sure he wouldn’t take the postdoc position.
Steve pulled him a little closer and Tony let him. Steve resisted the urge to kiss his temple. God, this had to stop. And soon.
The casserole still needs another fifteen minutes or so and Steve is searching a little desperately for something else to do that requires him to stay out of the living room. His eyes fall on the fairly wrinkly remains of some apples in his fruit bowl (Steve does the weekly shopping on Mondays after school and by Sunday the selection is a little pathetic). Before he has made a conscious decision, he is peeling and chopping apples and mixing them with raisins, lemon juice and cinnamon. Flour, oats, brown sugar and melted butter make a quick crumble topping and the dish is ready to go in the oven before the pasta is even done.
woken him up from that nasty nightmare later. But it was nice to have the upper hand for a change, and the man was kind of adorable when he bitched and moaned. Steve suspected finding Tony adorable was something that should not be mentioned to the man in question, and given that it wasn't a very manly sentiment to start with, he resolved to keep that to himself for the foreseeable future.
Tony barely stopped himself from growling "Moved him where?" Because of course that is what Loki was setting them up for, the childish prick.
“It's just Bruce and me here now. Sciencing in peace. Together. Well, with a thick wall between us, because he doesn't appreciate the subtleties of Death Metal and I hate sitars.”
come over and help out! I’m on a family vacation, for Merlin’s sake. I am on a cruise ship in a Norwegian Fjord on my way to see the Northern lights. My parents would kill me if I left, even if I knew how to get off this ship. And, no, I don’t want to get off this ship!”
It was all wrong. The blow job giver was supposed to be the one in control, the one that could remain detached while the other guy went down the rabbit hole, but Tony didn't feel in control at all. He felt shaky and fragile and he had no words while Steve looked at him with those earnest blue eyes. And when Steve kissed him, open mouthed, but oh so gently, Tony felt like he was falling. As if the floor under his knees had opened up and he would never hit the ground.
"Exactly!" Tony grinned. "Now let's find another taxi, some decent food, and then we can take the afternoon off. As long as we're back on the boat by 8 pm, we're good. JARVIS!"
Two hours later he is still watching the goats. They have lazily meandered first to one corner of their enclosure, then to another, never giving the impression that they are moving as a group, yet they all seem to choose to stay within some unspecified distance from each other. None of them wander off alone for too long, and if one does, the whole group will eventually gravitate that way. Steve feels calm in a way he can't remember feeling in forever. It is different from the inertia, this feels almost meditative. When hunger finally drives him back inside, he is surprised to find himself smiling.
touch him? He tried to remind himself of the reasons this was a bad idea, but he drew a total blank. It could not have been as important as getting Tony's mouth on his own right the hell
"But what if they told me to do something.... wouldn't you....I mean, you'd really have to trust that they would not hurt you or make you do...."
many?" He handwaved at the dozens of cards stuck to the charging station. Pepper slid off the workbench and walked over with her heels clicking on the concrete floor to where Tony was still staring at the cards, as if trying to unearth the deeper meaning of a card depicting Old Faithful geyser. She tapped a manicured nail on the only one that had the message facing outward, a little cartoon of Tony that had masterfully captured the look of intense concentration he tended to get when absorbed in a project.
“I see what you did there, Tony. Good. Bit of social suicide, possibly, but definitely making a statement there.”
"Maybe a shirt?" Steve hedged. Tony grabbed a dark red Henley from the couch and pulled it over his head. He held out his arms to silently request Steve's judgment.
It was late afternoon when he crested a hill and could see another sea at the horizon. They had crossed the Isle of Man more or less diagonally, it appeared. In the distance he could see a small village and right off the coast was a small island, with a castle on it. That had to be it. Please, God, it
Steve grinned. His lips were swollen and his hair was sticking up and Tony had given him beard burn. Yet he was still the most beautiful man Tony had ever laid eyes on. He was so caught up in staring at him, that he he didn’t notice straight away that Steve was on one elbow now, using his other hand to flick the button on Tony’s pants. He noticed when the back of Steve’s hand brushed his dick, though.
“Fine. Whatever. Lord knows I can't help you with that particular crisis, because it's a stupid crisis.” Tony strode off to go roll out his bedroll, to Steve's immense relief. He took a deep breath and let it go slowly. Was he really having a stupid crisis? Images from his dreams flashed through his mind's eye and he had to clamp down on them hard, because they still shocked him.
be sick. He looks pale enough. And he could be gay, too, I could see it. Maybe his conservative family kicked him out?"
Steve kissed him softly. There was nothing of their earlier fire in the kiss and Tony didn't press it either. Yet it touched Steve even deeper than the one before. Gentle as it was, -and they were barely moving their lips- it soothed the panic he'd felt for days and filled him with something more warm and hopeful instead. He pulled back before the kiss could turn needy and change the mood. They laid there for a minute, their breaths mingling.
Steve watched with a smidgen of pride as his team sprung into action, Natasha vaulting over the back of the couch and the other men taking off running. He cradled Tony closer, willing him to keep breathing while they rushed to save him. Looking at the room he was in and the familiar things he'd thought he'd never see again, he thought he held it all together pretty good. Until Sam kneeled next to him and placed a hand on his shoulder.
Steve tries real hard not to move his hips, he knows that isn't done, he remembers that. But Tony grabs his other hand and guides it this head too and now both his hands are winding through the strands of hair and cupping Tony's head and it's perfect for guiding the pace, for drawing Tony into his crotch. When Tony starts pulling his hips forward, though, he can't help it any longer. He starts fucking Tony's face, his own incredible need driving him towards the inevitable. It's like a vision, Tony's head cradled in his hands, Tony's lips tight around his cock and he himself driving himself down Tony's throat. His panting breaths are loud in his ears and it isn't long before he can start feeling the orgasm building at the bottom of his spine. Tony's hands are on Steve's ass, cupping and gripping and it's so, so good.
"Because Tony couldn't do it. Or wouldn't do it. That's unclear. And because I saw his face in the quinjet, and I've been watching him get worse ever since. He's not taking this well."
“Steve is Muggleborn, I’m afraid,” Tony would announce with a little relish, and the eyebrows would climb a fraction higher. One or two couldn’t or wouldn’t hide an actual sneer. Tony
But deep down, in the place where Tony occasionally didn't lie to himself, he hired her because he could easily flirt with her instead of giving in to his need to get all up in Steve. And
"The woman says 'we had a deal....,'" he said to Tony, "The man says he's aware of that. But he thinks it is too early to approach the men.... The woman says 'we'll have to move quick, the cruise is only a few more days. Making the proposal now will give us time for negotiations. And if they turn it down, there is still time for alternate options....' Now the man says 'what if the blond one gets violent when we make the proposal?' and the woman says.... 'don't be an idiot, the blond one will do what the older man tells him to do, he's the one in charge.' And the man goes 'why don't you do it?' and the woman says 'it is part of what you need to do, we've been over this! If you don't there will be consequences.' Now the man says it's fine, it's fine, he'll make the arrangements for the dinner seating right now, and do the negotiations after....”
“What?” Steve looked ragged and confused. A quick glance told Tony that Rhodes was leaning back in his chair, with his legs crossed and his fingers steepled thoughtfully against his lips.
Steve looked stricken. "Oh. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to co-opt the holidays. Um. What should we do for Hanukkah?"
Tony held his gaze through the last lines, concern written on his face. And Steve was reminded of how in a few days Tony would be gone too. He'd join the hordes of people that were no longer part of Steve's life. Steve was fairly sure that this loss would feel sharp and raw for a long, long time to come. He imagined the months ahead without Tony's acerbic running commentary, his flashes of brilliance, the soft look on his face when he thought Steve wasn't looking, and he came up empty and hollow. A couple of tears slid down Steve's cheeks just as the song ended.
That was the moment JARVIS piped up in their earpieces: “I have found the gentleman in question, sir. His name is Abdel Bajjah and he has three unpaid parking tickets in Villeurbanne, near Lyon.”
“I didn't always look like this,” Steve interrupted, “I was really small and sickly before my.... growth spurt and after that I was continuously deployed. There was a war on.”
Steve looked horrified. Why was Steve horrified? The man had no living relatives, why was he horrified at the idea of Tony spending Christmas alone? He'd done it for decades. It wasn't a big deal.
"Captain Rogers. It's an honor, sir." Rhodey was even doing the military voice thing. Tony scratched his beard and peeked at Steve, who was looking a bit uncomfortable. He'd dropped his hand and drawn up straight, with a slight blush covering his cheeks. Belatedly, he returned the salute.
“It's Corbin, doll, stay in character,” he breathed into Steve's ear, delighted with the shudder that caused. He felt a tiny little bit guilty about taking advantage of the situation. Steve couldn't elbow him in the ribs right here in the open and not cause a scene, but he seemed disinclined to do so anyway. He kind of hoped that Steve would be too embarrassed to tell anyone about this or Pepper was bound to send him to one of those 'don't touch people and keep your mouth shut, you pervert' trainings again. But even that prospect wasn't a strong enough incentive to stop him mouthing along Steve's jaw. He was getting close to Steve's mouth and he knew he wasn't going to stop. He was going to kiss him and it would be glorious. Excitement ran like an electric current along his spine. For a moment it seemed that Steve was turning toward the inevitable kiss, that he wanted Tony's mouth on his as much as Tony wanted it, and Tony wanted it
“Yes. C’mon!” Bucky clapped his hands, urging everyone to their feet. Tony collected the plates and sat them in the dish disposal. Walking over to the food stand, he pressed a button on the side. It started to sink into the ground, the floor closing back to make flat ground again.
“Well, Happy’s name is Harold, but he’s always Happy, y’know?” Rhodey explained, Happy nodding seriously.
“Do you need any help?” Tony asked, moving out of the way so Banner could fit through the door. Banner gave a small “No,” making his way back to the elevator.
The door swung open, revealing a man clad in a black uniform, a red hydra symbol sown onto the sleeve.
"Fine." There was a dull ache into he back of his head. Tony felt the shackles around his wrists and ankles for the first time. They were sitting against a wall, and chains connected to each other and to the wall.
Now his nightmare had returned, attacking family, turning them into a worse state than Tony could ever imagine. Tony pulled up the med bay’s security cams once again, analyzing the scene before him.
Tony forced himself to take deeper breaths, and allowed his heart to settle. He hid his face in his hand, shielding himself from shame and guilt. He felt something slide gently his free hand. Tony turned to look.
Tony looked up from his scribbling and into Steve’s eyes. They were so focused and attentive, even though Tony was sure he had little idea what Tony was talking about. Tony saw how a small smile made Steve’s lips curve slightly upwards, his brows lifted.
Tony was gripping his chest, gasping and spluttering. Panic was in full set as he was unable to say anything except grasp anything in an attempt to stand.
“Hello, everyone, to The Skeld. I’m your Captain, Steve, and my co-pilot, James.” Steve gestures to the shaggy, brown haired man. James stepped up next to Steve, revealing his bionic arm, mostly covered by a black jacket. James took a beanie from his pocket and pulled it over his head.
Steve agreed to this and sat on the arm of his chair. They both sat there, staring at each other. A small tug pulled at their hearts.
He went to the kitchen and poured some coffee. He also scrambled some eggs, enough for him and Steve, as well as some toast.
“Just some political stuff we need straightened out.” Steve looked down at his hands. He, too, knew what the feeling was. Though he’s only felt it towards two people in his life.
A few hours of trial and error finally gave Tony his results. Banner hitched a ride on a cargo ship to get over to the Americas. He then went off the grid, which was impressive seeming as even Tony couldn’t find him. Then suddenly, a month later, he resurfaced, popping up on top-secret government watchlists, mainly under a man named... Ross. General Ross? THE General Ross?
“Oh my god he gave birth!” Tony nearly doubled over laughing at his own joke. He whiped away his tears, his exhaustion making everything funnier than it actually was.
Tony felt himself falling, eyes shutting and breath ragged. His mind was back in New York. Falling, falling. His body shutting down and the world a blur as the ground rose to meet him.
“Lemme start with the strength. You got the most of the dosage. If you hadn’t gotten it, you would’ve died. Bucky would’ve lived, but with unbearable pain. The doctors said it was impossible for you to pull through, so they passed you off to me and my crew.” Stark led him to a set of thick, steel double doors.
“Now, now gentlemen. I think they’re good,” Stark said as he moved out from behind a tall man in a green uniform. He gave the guards a pointed nod, and they reluctantly let go of Bucky and Steve’s arms.
Pietro and Clint were the first ones to appear in the elevator. Their eyes were wide with hunger and they raced each other to the food.
Steve let out a sigh, sliding his hand down his face. There was a small pat on his shoulder, making Steve look up.
“Yes.” Tony pulled up the AI database. The ship was a bit older, so it would take him a bit longer than usual to set it up. “Give me a few minutes and it should be up and running.”
Tony noticed Steve’s glances towards him and his frantic scribbles. He hid his smile as to not alert Steve of his knowledge. Instead, he looked down at his list of fabrics and weaves. He could ask Shuri about her choice, but he wouldn’t want to disturb her from her work.
Dad started running for some rocks. Tony watched, time slowing as a rain of bullets fired down on Dad, piercing the side windows. Mom was sobbing now, but soon stopped when a sniper got her in the head.
"Super soldier my ass," Tony retorted. "You dont think I can go a few days without food?" Tony was tired and cranky. He hadn't slept in days, and the cold of the white room was getting to him. And the floors were incredibly uncomfertable.
Steve had managed to shove his lunch into his backpack as they rode. As they waited at the crosswalk, Bucky turned to him, a giant smile on his face.
Tony went over to shake May’s hand once again. “I’ll call you if we need Peter to come up to SI. He can work from home until he graduates.”
“I know what it’s like, Tony. You’re not alone.” He petted Tony’s head, letting him rest against Steve.
Tony stiffened a little under Steve’s hand. Steve began to panic inwardly, afraid that Tony might freak out or yell at him.
“I love you, too,” Steve croaked. Tears began to stream from his eyes and fall onto Tony’s shirt. Tony gently closed the door with his foot, careful not to disturb Steve.
“What do you mean? This isn’t the 40s anymore.” Tony steppes closer to Steve, but he backed away from him.
“So, um. That meeting. What’s it about.” Tony stood to busy himself. He knew the feeling in his chest, he’s felt it a few times before.
"You can't keep it from him forever." The voice was achingly familiar. "Sooner or later, he'll figure out how bad it is."
Steve was awake at 6:00 sharp. He liked to keep a few routines from his military days. He quickly changed and rushed to the kitchen.
Tony stepped closer, Steve not backing away. Tony noticed he was still wearing his suit and tie, slightly crumpled. Tony felt a little smile tug at his lips. He gently smoothed our Steve’s tie, looking up into his eyes.
Steve hurried to help, grabbing the mugs full of steaming coffee. He gave Tony a wide smile, recalling the sleepy events of last night.
“When were you going to tell us?!” Steve growled. “Ask for help? This isn’t just one of those problems you can just get over by yourself!” Steve paced the room. Tony’s never seen him this distraught. “I mean, you nearly tore your arms open trying to get out of that room. It’s obvious you’ve been having trouble with-with something since New York! But this has gotten so much worse.”
The soldier began shooting, but a shot was soon fired, hitting the man in the head and cracking the front windshield. Dad started to open his door when Mom yelled at him.
“I’ve noticed your work. Chemistry and mechanics are looking... prosperous.” He gave Peter a knowing smile. “I sent you an email, I’m sure.”
Tony summoned his suit to him. Stve was close behind them, Clint shooting the soldiers who got close. Steve noticed how Tony was acting different, more confident, more like his normal self.
“Tony! What’s this about a Spider-man? I can’t be juggling all your projects. I’m already having to move everything from this Tower, be the head of security at
Tony stared blankly at the cave wall, his body chilled. His breath billowed out of his mouth as a mist, and his nose was turning a shade of pink. His chest was sore and bruised, and Tony could feel it as he breathed.
When he came to, a medical cord was shoved up his nose, and Tony grabbed it, pulling it out. He felt it move inside of him until he finally got the whole pipe out. Tony flexed his numb fingers and grabbed at a few trays on the table, which swiped to the floor.
“That’s my que,” Tony chuckled. He went over to help the clumsy drone that fell into the water. He pulled it out of the water and began to take it apart to dry it out.
“You’re a scientific breakthrough!” he exclaimed. “Of course people are going ta wanna buy you. If I’ll give them to ya is another thing entirely.”
Tony felt heat rise to his cheeks and his heart fluttered. He scratched his neck nervously, his chains clincking as he moved. Steve waited patiently, smirking slightly.
“Just a few pirates,” Steve replied. “She got a good hit, but her success didn’t last long.” Steve went into a captivating story of how pirates jumped on board his small ship, threatening the crew with imprisonment.
They were both tired and their butts ached. The chains on their arms were too short to let them stand, also restricted them from lying too comfortably when they wanted to sleep.
Bucky frowned, focusing on moving his finger. Soon he was able to move it, and then all his fingers, and then twist his wrist and bend his elbow. You might’ve thought he’d never had an arm by the way he was acting.
Tony could occasionally feel the hands inside of him, poking him, before he woke up. Panic welled as his hands flew to his chest. Tony ripped away the bandages to feel cold metal lodged into his sternum.
Steve left the room, switching off the light and lightly closing the door. He picked up the empty gun and stared at it. Sleeping could wait.
“And you weren’t right, okay! I’m just not the one! I can’t be. I... I'm just some guy from Brooklyn.” Steve crossed his arms again, looking down at the ground.
The teachers blew the whistle to dismiss them. They chatted on the way to the first block. Tony walked with Rhodey Happy to math class. Rhodey pulled out two Pop-Tarts and handed one to Happy, quickly biting into the other.
Tony forced himself to calm down, so that his panicked gasps would slow into normal breathing. He slowly sat up, gripping the side of the cot until his hands stopped trembling.
Tony spun on his heels and walked back to the cafeteria to help set up the food. He saw the small service drones already setting the tables, and the small food stand being revealed in the corner.
Tony went over to the Doctor’s room, where he found it to be already open. He waited patiently outside for Banner to notice him.
Bucky gave a little nod, signalling he was ready. Richards hit a button, and a few panels moved at the part of the arm right above Bucky’s skin. Without hesitation, the little panels unfolded hidden spear-like shapes and impaled itself into Bucky’s arm. He let out a yelp, gritting his teeth as the spears dug in deeper.
Steve gave him a blank look. Stark gave an huff, dropping a couple of earbuds on Bucky’s cot, not caring if they got crushed.
Tony joined the others on the elevator, Steve entering last. There was plenty of room, and a very quick trip down to the Living floor.
He took a gun from a mantle on the wall, it’s barrel taking up half of the weapon, the other half thick with gun machinery that Steve didn’t have the faintest clue of how it worked. Stark was about to hand it to Steve before looking at Bucky and scrunching his face.
“What.” Steve’s mind was turning. What was this gun for? Clearly not protection, he has millions of suits. Why would he need it for peace of mind, he is surrounded by literal superheroes.
A row of YouTube videos of crazy conspiracies and Hulk-related news flew by Tony’s head. He plucked out a few of them, tossing them into a holographic trashcan at one corner of the projection.
Steve forced a little smile. Natasha immediately pulled into the gas station they had nearly passed.
Tony shivered at the frigid temperature, drastically different from earlier. The images flashed into his head, and he slapped his hand to his face to try and block them out.
Sl’qefort (sel-key-fo) is my own little species I’ve created. Here are the little notes I made for the people.
Natasha was in charge of feeding Tony, as she has had to go a while without food during missions. She set him on a strict diet of bananas and dates for the first few days. Then Nat slowly let him eat more and more calories.
“Kid named Harley. One mention of New York and you run off, vitals through the roof. At the coffee shop with Rhodey week or so before, you run out of the shop after some kid whispers in your ear. Do I need to go on?”
“I had thought about it, but it still wouldn’t be able to withstand the Mach 10 that Pietro can run at.”
All of Steve’s pent up emotions spilled out as he pulled Tony in. No kiss, just a hug. His arms wrapped around Tony and squeezed tight, as if afraid he would lose him there and then.
“Speak.” She had parked and positioned herself, feet up on the seer and ankles crossed, her back resting against the door and her arms propped up on her knees.
“Then you should start dating,” she said simply. She started the car and sped back down the interstate.
Tony tried to grasp at the hands only to find he couldn’t move. Agonizing pain overwhelmed him, making him cry. A rag was placed over his mouth, and he breathed in. The world slowly faded until it was gone.
Math went by quickly, the only thing they did was an About You sheet and introductions. The three split up afterwards, Tony going to Biology, while Happy and Rhodey went to English.
“I met you and your dad once, you know,” the man changed the topic. “At a technical conference in Berlin.”
The big blond stood up, walking to the center of the crowd. He was dressed in black pants and a simple flannel.
“Yeah! Totally,” Dad said. The soldier pulled out a small camera and took a selfie, throwing up some peace signs.
Tony beamed at the praise. Dad rarely compliments him like that. Tony had, after months of research, finally been able to get the repulsor system functioning. It’s one of the main parts of the missile, and one of the newest parts.
items on board. I was able to take out a straggler with a quick hit to the throat. I stole their sword and ran for the weapons to grab some guns. But when I got there… I was attacked! Three pirates stood in my way. There was nothing I could do but fight. I was able to take out the brute first- his movements were sluggish and he couldn’t maneuver well in the small space.
Steve dragged himself out of bed and past his living room. It didn’t help the process when he saw the different photos of him and Tony. One photo was during a party at the Avengers’ Tower. Tony’s cheeks were slightly blushed from alcohol and he looked like he was about to burst into a fit of laughter. Steve was nearly holding him up with a hand on his hip. He was struggling to hold in his laugh- Steve remembered, Rhodes had told one of his many well-timed jokes- as he leaned into Tony’s arm that was strewn across Steve’s shoulders. Of course he had that stupid photo framed.
Tony gave a small smile. Sam was on one side, Steve on the other, with Tony slightly squished in the middle.
He showed him the YouTube videos people have published and the different abilities he has been shown to have.
“Come on, stand up. Stand up!” the man hissed. He ushered Tony to his feet and faced the door. He placed his hands behind his head. “Just do as I do!”
He looked up at Rhodey, his eyes unfocused and cloudy. “She’s gone, Rhodey. She’s gone, and it’s all my fault. Now I’m going off kissing someone else while she’s still dead.”
Everybody was heartbroken after Rhodes announced Pepper’s death. He wouldn’t give specifics, and they didn’t ask. Tony didn’t leave the garage for about a month, Rhodes being the only one allowed in or out, with Steve only allowed in on “good” days. Steve knew how long the grieving process was, he’s been through it himself. So he knew around what time...
“How about I get you some water?” Steve gently suggested. Tony gave a thumbs up as he threw up again.
“So we’re your trigger men? Really! We’re thirteen.” There was a dance on Friday, Steve wanted to say, but decided to keep quiet. I’m thirteen and you want me to fight in a war we already won. Steve clenched his fists, blood boiling. He looked over at Bucky who was still sound asleep.
They sat in silence as the gruel warmed. The man whistled as he scraped the food around in the bowl. The light front he fire shined off the little pair of glasses perched on his nose.
“C’mon, Tony,” Steve pleaded, his hand falling from Tony’s chest and down to his side. “I’d like you to be there.”
He curled his fingers around Steve’s neck, pulling him close while another hand tugged at his shirt. Their lips landed together. Steve didn’t do anything at first, shocked at what was happening. Then he embraced Tony, his hands resting on Tony’s hips.
They had to cycle about 3 miles to get to school. Their parents were fine with it, as long as they stuck together. They were about halfway through their trip when they took a little break at a busy intersection.
Steve watched Tony work, interlacing his own interpretations with real life. A small twinkle in his eye, the signature fuzz that runs along his jaw.
He sat down, sliding his backpack down to make the least amount of noise possible. Tony looked over at the kid, seeing that he was watching the teacher. He was tapping his pencil against his fingers, making a light tapping sound.
Tony was finally able to take a deep breath, coughing at the sudden intake of air. The mask left once he was able to breathe normally again. Dr. Cho was there with Steve and Clint behind.
Time seemed to slow. Did he? Did Tony Stark- billionaire, playboy, philanthropist- love Steve Rogers?
“Just finished calibrations.” Steve peaked around Stark to see a tall man with an excited smile on his face, a shiny, metallic arm resting on a stand. Different patches and wires were stuck along the arm, strung to a computer, one finger flexing at a time. Unnerved, Steve took a step back.
The group laughed through lunch, Bruce swiftly integrating with the group. He sat with them at Physics, and, thankfully, they all had the same Advisory class.
“That… is an electromagnet.” The man addressed the metal in Tony’s sternum. “Hooked up to a car battery, and it is keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. Mm?”
“You know those videos are fake right? I mean, they’re just CGI.” Peter attempted to use CGI as an excuse.
Once he was finished, he finalized the reset. The AI whirred to life, immediately running diagnostics on the med bay functions.
“So, from what all the other test subjects experienced, your senses should be heightened.” Stark pulled a small sack from under the cot. He dug around for a few moments before pulling out some circular devices, much like a compact version of hearing aids. Except there was no strap to hold the battery, only the earpiece.
“Oh, hey...” Steve looked at his watch. “9:00.” He gave a wide yawn, pulling his hands down his face.
Tony could feel his heart quicken, and scratched at his chest in a subtle attempt to ease it. His cheeks began to warm up and a small lump started to form in his throat.
Steve collapsed in his room, worn out from his meetings and restless sleep the night before. He pulled out his phone to see if he got any texts, disappointed to find none. He looked at the clock, seeing that it was 4:00.
"Tony! Tony calm down." Steve shuffled closer. He laid a hand on Tony's shoulder which Tony promptly swatted away.
“How’s this place running? Everything operational? Everybody eating enough?” Tony questioned Friday, rubbing his neck to relieve the tension there.
“All done!” Richards clapped his hands, a smile plastered on his face. “Move your index finger for me.”
“You fucking idiot...” Steve let out the breath he realized he was holding. The ice in his blood melted and he was filled with anxious nervousness. As if he were a mother bear that just watched her cub get hurt and not be able to do anything about it.
"These guys are pretty well armed," Tony said after weapon blueprints popped up. Quite advanced, and they didn't have Tony helping out.
Steve had been a Captain for 10 years now, working on board a wide variety of ships, from cargo to military. He’s worked with Banner only once before, but with Natasha and Bucky countless times before. He held a pretty impressive record. He once saved the entire ship from a pirate attack single-handedly.
Pietro had already left, getting upset at Wanda ignoring him. Steve, himself, eventually left the living room and to the med bay.
“I’ve got Physics and Biology,” Tony said. He pulled out his schedule to check it over again. “Yeup. At least most of us are in the same class together.” Tony looked over at Pepper with a frown. “Sorry, Pep.”
Tony woke up to an unbearable pain in his chest. He blinked, trying to clear his vision. He cringed as he felt hands inside his chest, prodding at his heart and organs.
“I'm afraid Mr. Stark is quite drunk and needs some assistance,” she explained. “You were the only one awake.”
He saw the different YouTube videos of the “Amazing Spider-Man”. One video he was retrieving a stolen purse, another he was stopping a car from hitting a bus. Another one showed him stopping a robbery.
Tony grabbed Peter by the wrist, looking him in the eye as he pulled up the sleeve of Peter’s jacket.
“I picked this team out specifically. Your resumes are unlike anything I’ve seen before, and perfect for this ship,” Steve said, making sure to make eye-contact with everyone. “You will be here for three months, and then you will be paid and sent home. The contents of the cargo are confidential, and, let me tell you, extremely boring.” The crew let out a little chuckle.
“Organic technology that can react and respond to the needs of the wearer.” Since Tony didn’t have vibranium at his disposal, he could make something incredibly similar, but less effective.
“Shh! Alright class!” the teacher began. “I’m Dr. Johnson.” He wrote his name in messy handwriting across the board. “Be quiet so I can call role.”
Steve shook his head to clear the thought. No, it was cruel and it was selfish. He shouldn’t had taken advantage of Tony like that.
Steve realized he was already half-way done with the drawing. He looked at a clock and almost an hour had passed. Tony was still in his chair, in the same position for an hour.
James spoke up next. “Hiya, if I may. You can call me Bucky. I’m the second in command if Steve is too busy. And Doctor Banner- come up here- he’s third in charge. And he’s the doctor, obviously.” The skinny black haired man timidly stepped up beside “Bucky,” looking even smaller in comparison. He gave a small wave while Bucky wrapped his arm around Banner’s shoulders.
"Tony, please!" Steve pulled Tony's arms behind him. Tony tried desperately to get away, but Steve was able to wrap his legs around him.
Tony rebooted the AI and cleaned out some parts of the system. He saw a classified file embedded in the AI. Tony checked to see if Banner was looking, and since he wasn’t, put his finger to one of the slots on the computer and began to download the file. His finger morphed to the slot, and the download was quick.
Together, it took about 20 minutes for everything to cook. Everybody was rising from their rooms, looking like the dead. They sat around the very large table in the huge dining room. They didn’t always stay there, moving to their rooms with food if they wanted some more time alone.
“So, weapons. I have amazing choices.” Stark led them down a row of tables, different crates and prototypes scattered about them. “Do you guys have anything you’re good at?”
The missiles moved up and over, directing towards the mountains. They pointed more and more to the sky before one suddenly jet off.
Steve gave him a frown. Tony averted his eyes, knowing that that frown could make him change his mind in an instant.
“And that’s why I’m here.” Peter sat on his bed, twiddling with his thumbs as Tony spoke. Tony sat in Peter’s desk chair and gave Peter a comforting smile.
One night, Steve had a rough time sleeping and decided to take it out on a punching bag. He was taking a break, munching on a pizza, when Friday’s voice come over the speakers.
Tony and Steve had settled on Steve’s couch, a movie playing on the television. Tony had his head resting against Steve’s chest, and they were smiling at their newfound closeness.
“Hey Steve!” he greeted Steve cheerily. He sat up from his bed, looking around in wonder at the room.
“Well I can certainly get hurt. As far as emotions go, I do kind of feel emotions. I just don’t feel it the same way.” Tony found a way to phrase it. Thor and Bruce looked at him with interest. “Say you have anxiety. Usually people feel it in their heart, but all my emotions I feel in my head. My hardware is different. So if I’m scared, instead of a fight or flight, I just freeze up until I can process what happened.”
Everybody else came at once in the elevator, except Bruce from the medbay. They were laughing and joking around, pointing at the food with glee. Tony served each dish, every choice different from the last.
"Well, well, well." The hydra agent said. "What have we here? Two Avengers throwing themselves at my doorstep. Whatever will we do?"
Rich. Steve instantly knew. If he wasn’t a respectable young man whose mother raised him well, his eyes would be rolling out of his head.
“Nearly 8.” Tony sat down the food and they began to eat, chatting lightly in between. Steve began to clean up when Friday’s voice came from the ceiling.
“Bruce, what happened? Are you okay?” Steve asked, running up to help. Tony had retracted his helmet, staring wide-eyed at Bruce, who was clinging desperately to Tony.
“I have to help! I’m no use in here!” He ran out of the car before she could respond. Mom’s breathing was frantic and her hold on Tony tightened even further.
Steve woke coughing and sputtering, looking around wildly. He was expecting to be in the crash still, but instead he was in a cot in a bright-white and blindingly well lit room. A man was by his side in an instant, an excited grin on his face.
Nothing much happened in the days that passed. No substantial new threats, nothing the rookies couldn’t handle.
“Welp,” Tony clapped his hands together, “I’m gonna go to the lab. Call Steve if ya need me.” And with that, he took off.
When Tony thought, he either tapped his pen to his lips or to his chest. If he was really concentrated he would talk to DUM-E or U, spouting his ideas so he could remember them better.
