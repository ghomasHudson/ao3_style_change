giving a full-body massage after this. I mean, once he runs out and brings me back half the menu from Mama Lucita's. Fuck, is it normal to be this hungry? I could eat a fucking horse."
?" he said, floored that it had worked. That shouldn't have worked. Why had that worked? Was Steve feeling OK?
Steve's jaw did that grinding little twitch it did whenever he heard upsetting news, and Hill gave her most disappointed shake of the head. Barton sat there, his face gone slightly ashen, and he blinked a few times but said, "Yeah, I said that, but it wasn't about— It wasn't about
Barnes stood there a moment, gun still at the ready, and Tony lowered his hands to show he wasn't a threat and said, "You're good. You're OK."
"What else is new?" Rhodey said and sat down next to him while Bruce sat down on the other side of him. "So, you're really doing this? You're really getting married?"
Tony nodded and followed Bruce through the door, Steve joining them a moment later, and just as the doctor began to lead them down another hallway, Tony said, "Uh, you mind if I use the bathroom first? Bruce made me drink a lot of water and, not to be too blunt, but I've got to piss like a racehorse."
OK, that was not the look of someone in the know. He definitely hadn't figured out that Tony had already helped himself to the junk, and as far as Tony was concerned, he was never going to figure it out.
Maybe he just wanted to know he was still loved or appreciated or something stupid like that. Maybe #JabbatheSlut hurt a little more than he wanted to admit to even himself. Maybe he
Tony just 'hmm'ed at that but said nothing, and instead, he picked up a small piece of what looked like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and said, "Livvy, baby, come here and eat something halfway decent."
Stark choked out a desperate sound at that, his face scrunching some in need and want, and Steve kept hold of his chin as he used his other hand to unbutton and unzip his uniform pants, and he reached in to free his—
"So," he said, "what's the story here? Because from everything I've seen, you, ma'am, are not Tony Stark."
Tony yawned and nestled against Steve, but he seemed to remember pretty quickly that he wasn't where he was used to waking up, and he sat up a little and met Steve's eyes, confusion turning into realization rather quickly. He blinked and looked around the room, and Steve swallowed and took a breath and waited for it, waited for the hammer to fall.
Oh, and also the person that he maybe did harbor an eensy, weensy bit of jealousy toward. Oh, yeah, and also the person that had, not under his own volition, killed his parents.
She grimaced a little like she'd fucked something up, but Tony still shook her hand anyway and said, "Yeah, I get that a lot," before he turned to the other man also named 'Tony,' as it turned out, and not really 'JediEngineer770.'
Thor's concern for him turned a little sad, and he reached out and clapped a hand to his shoulder and said, "Are you all right, my friend?"
Tony grimaced and finally admitted, "I want to lock up behind you. I need to make sure it's locked when you go."
"Well, that's convenient," someone muttered from the group. It earned him the Stare of Disapproval, but he didn't shrink away from it. If anything, it seemed to embolden him.
Tony snuffled again and said, "I don't know if I should be thrilled or horrified that my boyfriend just threatened to beat up my dead father."
"Because I'm an old man, Steve! Because I'm an old, middle-aged man, and I look like an old middle-aged man."
Bruce made some sort of horrible sound like he was choking on something, and Tony sat back a bit, startled, as he watched Bruce choke on…air? Saliva? There weren't any food or drinks around them, he realized as he did quick scan of the table.
"What troubles you? You have your bonded. You have a child born of that bond. You want for nothing. What troubles you?"
him," Tony pointed out and then looked at Hill and Natasha, who were just standing around, drinks in-hand, watching the shit-show. "Are you just going to stand around and let this happen?"
the sort of thinking he wanted to succumb to at that moment in time. God almighty, sometimes he wished he could turn his brain
Tony huffed a little and rolled his eyes but couldn't deny the asshole had a point. Of course there'd be photographs, and of course there'd be unflattering ones, and of
Steve quieted his laughs and kissed Tony's shoulder. "Nah, you'll be a dad, too. You can't stay like this forever, right?"
Rhodey was out of town, dispatched somewhere by the government that still, for some reason, owned his soul, and Wilson was too busy trying to
that he was still alive. Turns out it's probably just a stupid hormone to keep me from abandoning my newborn to…wolves or…crocodiles or something."
Steve shrugged but couldn't really think of anything to say to defend himself. Instead, he focused on the tray Tony had set down and nodded his head at it.
"You cannot possibly conceive of it," she said simply, and Steve nodded as he tried to understand what she was telling him.
Steve just put his hands up and said, "Clearly, you're her actual biological father. Not me." Tony just stared at him a moment but didn't say anything.
FYI: some D/s talk in this one by people that don't really have experience in it. Also maybe a little NSFW for a 'self-love' scene with Steve. Huh. I write him doing that a lot for some reason...
He pointed over to an area where a red hat with a blue stars-and-stripes band hung from the ceiling.
"Kind of has it in that big, blonde head of his that you don't really like him anymore," he continued after he finished thinking about getting his hands on his husband's ass.
that I think there's anything wrong with that. I trust Captain America more than I trust most of those other assclowns."
Sam didn't seem too pleased by the digression, turning to Bucky and saying an unimpressed, "Really?"
about things, but I'm never not— Look, I'm gonna stick by you, OK? For better or worse. I just hate…"
"It's amazing how much information is out there nowadays. Back in my day, you had to find this stuff out on the street, and even then, I mean,
He bent down and pressed a kiss against the crown of Steve's head, and Steve buried his face in his hands and muttered, "I can't believe you told them that."
He huffed and rolled his eyes before he squared his shoulders and stormed off the car and onto the floor. "I mean it," he muttered as he brushed roughly past Steve. "I swear to god if you call me that again, you're sleeping on the couch."
Suspicion clouded Steve's face, his eyes narrowing and his lips pursing into a frown. "What's wrong?"
Steve laughed just a little, and he nodded his head and tightened his arms just the slightest and said, "All right," before sealing the deal with a soft and warm kiss against Tony's mouth.
"Well, as a matter of fact—" Tony started to say, but Steve shook his head and folded his arms, cutting off his words with that damned 'Cap' voice of his.
"To what?" she asked. "Take a break? Retire? Do something else? My dear Captain, no one is enslaving you. You're not required to do this — to be this...Captain...if you don't want to be."
He pulled away from the baby and went back over to the counter to grind up some beans for coffee. This time, he focused only on his task, and he was able to grind the beans and set the coffeemaker to brew in less time than it had taken him to grind the beans the last time.
Steve stood in the middle of the living room, the lighted evergreen partially obscuring his view of the kitchen from where he stood, and so he went over and took a good look at it for the first time since they'd put it up a couple weeks back, only now noticing the chintzy plastic Avengers ornaments that dotted the branches. There was a green Hulk and a mighty Thor and a suave- looking Hawkeye and a cool-as-a-cucumber Black Widow.
Steve gave a little nod of understanding. "When I accidentally called you. There was a…little voice chirping in the background. You said it was the TV."
She sniffled and rubbed her nose again, and when she glanced to the side, her eyes went wide. "Unca Bruce! When'd you get here?"
He breathed out Steve's name in desperate want, and without prodding, he reached up and again began to fondle his breasts before moving his fingertips lightly over the sensitive skin of his abdomen, hitching at the barely-contained pleasure that thrummed inside of him.
"Now you're quoting Carly Simon songs?" Wilson asked as he filled another balloon with helium. Steve watched him do this and sighed a little.
The text came when Steve was crossing the threshold to his small apartment after suffering through his Thursday afternoon art history class, the one filled with bored seniors looking for an easy elective.
"Who the hell is Vision?" Tony cried, unable to help himself because, seriously, did this kid just literally appear out of nowhere?
He stopped short and ran his flesh hand through his hair like he was trying to figure out exactly what he wanted to say.
Steve just pulled his sleep shirt off and grabbed one of the compression shirts he wore for running.
"Hmm?" Tony asked and rubbed his belly. "No. Just never did anything with this room, and the white was just so clinical and bland. No, maybe I'll start taking my role as head of R&D more seriously. You don't want to use this for your studio, so, I'll use this for my office. Put a desk there—" he pointed against one wall, "—maybe a filing cabinet there—" he pointed to an adjacent wall, "—drafting table there maybe," he added and pointed to the wall opposite where he had said he would put the desk.
Barton had already moved to the front to take the controls, so Tony sat down to the side and huffed a bit, switching between eyeing his downed suit with disdain and eyeing Steve with annoyance. No, it wasn't the suit's fault it had failed him, and he thought back to the fall and how hard he'd hit the ground, and he glanced down at his abdomen and said without thinking, "Either you're still OK or that witch was full of shit." And then he realized what he was doing, and he rolled his eyes and shook his head and folded his arm—
Without a thought, he went to pull up the hem of his shirt, and it wasn't until he saw pecs instead of breasts that he remembered.
Tony just 'humphed' a little as he tried to get the bottom of the gown situated so that it would cover him. OK, yeah, sure, he'd had his share of sexcapades, some of which had even been caught on camera, but somehow that was…different. That was his own choice, and yeah, OK, looking back maybe he wasn't
So, there were the Avengers, whose ranks grew slowly but surely with the additions of Sam and Jim Rhodes and now Bucky with Maria Hill as their liaison and Sharon Carter as a very tough sell that appreciated the offer to join the ranks but felt she was of better use elsewhere. At least with her they had a CIA connection, though, if they ever needed it.
Tony enjoyed fine dining like everyone else. He enjoyed expensive wines (or he did) and upscale restaurants and exclusive lists as he'd become accustomed to after forty years of living the life of a pampered prince and then, once he got older, as one of the wealthiest men in the world.
Tony just blinked, and he took the helmet off so he could look Steve in the eye, but not before he exchanged a perplexed look with Barton and said, "Steve, if I hadn't, you would have stayed there until that goddamned building collapsed on top of both of you."
He…kind of just thought of himself as 'Tony.' As a person. As a human. As a being that had been given the chance to create life with his own body. He saw himself as both, and he saw himself as neither. It…wasn't really all that easy to explain to himself, and he couldn't possibly figure any way of explaining it to someone else. It wasn't words, necessarily, it was just a feeling, an emotion, a sense of knowing.
He grumbled something under his breath and bit halfway into the egg roll, chewing and muttering as he did so. Tony had to bite his lips to keep from smiling too much.
"On the seventh night, sprinkle this onto the food of the King and his Chancellor. One pinch for the Chancellor, and three pinches for the King."
Steve rolled his eyes and shook his head, and Sam laughed and said, "Yeah, man, it's cool. You got my twenty bucks?"
"Uh," he said and cuddled the baby a little closer to him, she still with her hand stuck in her mouth and body turned so that 'Future MIT Grad' was proudly on display, "we kind of actually asked Pepper and Happy if they would...be her godparents."
it. Here." He made a fist and held it against his sternum right above his heart. "I— I don't know how to explain it, and I know it sounds…
"Thank you," he murmured to him, and though he didn't really care if anyone else in the room heard it, he still really wanted it to be something just between him and Rhodey. Rhodey's approval meant a lot to him, and not that he thought he would have
Steve still hadn't come upstairs by the time he finished, and he sat on the bed and towel-dried his hair. He tried to listen in for Steve and Sam's conversation, but he couldn't hear anything — not even the general noise that Steve could somehow make just lounging around and reading stuff on his tablet — and so he got up and went over to the door and thought maybe being closer to the living room would help him.
Tony pushed the food around on his plate a moment before he felt a hand take his, and he glanced over to see Steve eyeing him then giving a nod in the opposite direction away from the table.
"After we clean it," Tony said just as a half-track barreled in from out of nowhere and began to make the journey away from the bunker. He swore under his breath and began to follow it away from the camp. "We don't need this shit falling into anyone else's hands."
"OK," she said and closed her eyes, and the Cap shot one more look in Tony's direction — a warm smile that almost said Tony had no idea what was in store for him—
"When you get pregnant with a super soldier's spawn that has the appetite of that fucking super soldier, then we'll talk about weight gain, all right?" he asked, scraping up the last of the chocolate on Steve's plate.
Rhodey leaned against the table and folded his arms. "So, that's it? She looks like you and she believes what she's saying, so she must be your future daughter from another dimension?"
"Hmm?" Tony said and shook crystals onto a candy cane. "Age, I guess. Got a little older. The wound...healed over. Didn't disappear just...healed over, I guess. Rhodey invited me to spend Christmas with him a few times. And then, well, Pep. And then you with your fucking old- fashioned ways."
this for ourselves. I hate that it was forced on us, and I hate that you bear the brunt of everything for it while all I can do is sit back and watch and tell you how amazing you are and how proud I am of you. But whatever it takes, we are going to get through this, all right? I know it's not the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone, and I know it's not even the worst thing that's ever happened to
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Bruce go contemplative and say, "Hey, Tony, you don't think this is actually how—"
"Nope," Tony said and shook his head. "Don't give me that. Stop playing proud little boy from the Depression. I have the money, Steve. This did not put a dent into my fortune, and yes, you deserve it. You deserve everything. If you're not careful, I'm going to buy you a gallery."
"What am I supposed to do with that?" he muttered just as Bruce said, "Say, Olivia? Your Daddy and your Papa— Do they kiss each other?"
"No," he said, resting a forearm on the table, "but I don't burn as many calories just sitting here as—"
going to someplace like that by myself! Are you kidding? No, the only reason I agreed to this stupid thing was because Steve said he would go with me. If Steve's not going with me, I'm not going. Period."
Tony nodded toward the table, and Steve went over and picked up the leather strap, and he fastened it to the hook on the collar and said, "Ordinarily, in a situation like this, I'd make you crawl up the steps—"
"What? That Captain America owns Stark Industries? Hell, if he'd been defrosted back before Howard had died, he probably would have turned the company over to him instead of me."
Tony watched as he went over to the bathroom and rummaged around in the small storage closet beside the linen cupboard, and he called out to him, "This is one of those old people 'I'm poor as dirt but I have too much pride not to look my best in public' things, isn't it?"
The others turned to each other in consideration, but Barnes just frowned and said, "I'm confused. Are we actually not welcome here?"
She thought about this a moment then nodded, and Tony led her into the bathroom. He found a spare toothbrush and helped her brush her teeth — she did most of the work, thankfully — and he led her back into the bedroom and pulled down the covers on the bed.
But the Cap just shoved his hands in his pockets, and he smiled lazily and said, "Call me 'Steve.' Unless you'd like me to start calling you 'Mr. Stark'?"
Tony heaved out a breath and looked up at the ceiling — at the sheetrock and spackle that hadn't yet been covered and the very dim recessed lighting that he was pretty sure had been picked out by Pepper.
Steve then leaned forward and ducked his head to take a bite of the slice of bacon Tony didn't even realize he had to guard, and as he crunched on it, Tony glared at him and said, "Really?"
"I'm sorry," Steve said again as he settled into a chair across from him. "How come you're down here anyway?"
to have his old body back, no pun intended, and he'd not only grown used to the idea of having an outwardly female body but had actually gotten to the point of
He heard Natasha and Pepper Potts greet each other, and then Natasha was introducing Pepper to both Bucky and Sam. Tony still hadn't said a word, and maybe he wasn't actually there because he himself hadn't actually
"Oh, come on!" Darcy cried. "He's probably the luckiest person in the world. I mean, I'm never going to know what it's like to jerk off. I mean, not
But Jim shook his head and cut him off before he could try to explain himself. "No, man, I get it. I understand. I'd trust my kid with Pep before I trusted them with any of those idiots, too."
Tony saw big, dark eyes lined with feathery lashes asking him for 'shield waffles' and if they could watch that episode of the 'vengers cartoon where Daddy and Papa had to be the bad guys.
up because even Hill showed up that afternoon and with a punchbowl and the ingredients for a brew of some kind. Hill ventured into the penthouse every so often, but it was for business only and never for pleasure.
"What? I've heard Cap say that word a thousand times before," Barton said, and when Wilson and Natasha voiced their agreement — and even Barnes seemed to indicate Steve's knowledge and use of that word went back farther than any of them could have imagined — Tony said, "Steve does not like me to say that we
"Kinda," he muttered and glanced down. "I should be contributing...something. I shouldn't just be living off of Tony."
Tony stayed suspiciously quiet at that, and Steve leaned his head back against the seat and turned to watch his profile — the slope of his nose, the cut of his jaw, the neatly-groomed hairs of his chin, those feathery, black eyelashes. Tony was a handsome man; there were no two ways about it. He was intelligent and strong and funny and easy to rile up as well, but he was still a good- looking man, and it still seemed so…odd that he could luck into a time and place where admitting this or accepting this was OK, wasn't going to get him into trouble, wasn't going to get him thrown out of the service or beat up or worse. He could be with a man, they could have a family together, and no one would blink an eyelash at it.
"Yeah, on stupid shit. Furniture — 'cause maybe it was OK for people back in your day, but we're not letting our kid sleep in a fucking dresser drawer — is usually kind of excluded from that."
Steve gave a long, slow nod, his hand resting on Tony's knee, and he gave it a squeeze in comfort and support as Barnes asked, "What's
"That's great, Tony," he said and Tony heard the hesitance in his voice, "but I remember what happened the last time you sent that out—"
He crumpled up the note, scowled angrily at the coffeemaker, then opened up the warm oven and saw a plate of scrambled eggs with bacon and toast. He grabbed a dishtowel from off the kitchen island and pulled the plate out, and he set it down and hit the door with his hip to close it. There was another yellow sticky attached to the fridge, and we went over and read it.
on TV (and the scene, of course, where the wife grew old while the Highlander himself stayed young — Steve...maybe almost cracked the remote at that but wouldn't let himself think about why), he found his way down to the gym. It was quiet down there — no one save for him — and he took that opportunity to run through some stuff he didn't need a partner for. He wrapped his hands and spent some time with the heavy bags and did some calisthenics after that. He thought about running one of the simulations Tony had written for them, but a check of the time showed it was nearing lunchtime, which meant Olivia was awake again, and he figured he could play with her until it was naptime again.
"Look, I don't know about you guys," Tony said, turning his attention back to the table, "but we all saw what that one that was in Loki's scepter was able to do to Barton — and I don't mean making him even more annoying than usual. I'm willing to give the guy the benefit of the doubt."
Tony stared down at himself a moment more, long, dark hair falling in his face, and he looked up at Steve and said like he wasn't quite sure of the words coming out of his mouth, "I'm a woman."
He took a gulp of his juice, and Barton just shrugged. "I'm telling you. You've got all the signs of it being a girl."
" before going on to explain — angrily — that Santa Claus rode a red sleigh pulled by eight tiny reindeer,
Steve was shaking with laughter, his face pressed into Tony's shoulder, arms tight around him and dick, which he still hadn't pulled out, twitching inside of him. He squeezed him again and lifted his head to press a hard, sloppy kiss to Tony's cheek and said, "Goddamn it, I love you so much."
"He still could have done it," she replied then waved them off. "It's all in the past now, and look! You have a
He swallowed, and he watched Steve give in to DUM-E and toss the ball for him one last time, and he thought…maybe…just maybe…
"Hey!" Steve said quickly, sharp and commanding. "She'll get used to it. You didn't have to stay that way just so she had a meal."
He leaned in some and, almost on instinct, put a hand to Tony's hip. "Yeah," he said, his mouth by Tony's ear, and Steve heard his rather audible gasp of breath, "it is."
Tony groaned and sat away from Steve, leaning over to the plate and spearing the other half of the sausage link. "How much will it take for you to forget how to read?"
Tony scowled and moved to sit on the couch where Natasha had moved over to offer him a spot. "Nothing," he muttered but didn't look at anyone. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Hill and Natasha exchange looks, and he then felt Natasha put a gentle hand on his back and give it a few soothing strokes.
" someone called out, and Tony paused a moment and stared in the direction of the shout, understanding it to be exactly what it was: a slight against how large he'd gotten.
"Jesus, I'm going to break an ankle wearing these things. I don't care how great they make my ass look."
" he whined, forgetting himself for a moment. Wasn't Steve trying to play as a 'Roger' for this stupid exercise?
"Goddess," Steve muttered. He didn't care what she'd been able to do to Tony. She wasn't a goddamned goddess. "Swell. I don't see how she can help."
He stayed down there a little while longer before he figured he should venture out in search of, well, he told himself it was food but a part of him wanted to see where Steve had gone no matter how pissed he still was at him. He went up to the penthouse and padded through the living room, finding no sign of Steve. He went into the kitchen and glanced around, but again, no sign of Steve.
Thor frowned a bit. "Perhaps they did favor one of us over the other, and Loki did feel himself to be slighted in affections from both Father and Mother."
He reached up and patted Steve's chest, and Steve pulled a hand away from Tony's arm to cover the hand that was resting against him. He reached out and kissed Tony's forehead and said, "Happy Birthday."
to be a parent, so I've taken his piss-poor example and run the exact opposite way with it. My father never once told me he loved me, and no matter what that patch-wearing super-sleuth says, the happiest day of his life
"You're just figuring that out now?" Steve said and side-eyed him from the where he lay on the bed reading something on his tablet.
He left the bathroom, and Tony was sitting on the bed staring down at some small, black, rectangular thing in his hand.
Tony glanced down and saw the brat was looking up at the ceiling with a look of intrigue and irritation, and she pursed her small mouth and said, "I like Friday better. Papa, why can't it be Friday?"
"Don't judge," he snapped at the hipster barista, who had looked askance at the slight bulge of Tony's abdomen and had evidently concluded that it wasn't merely from weight gain.
Tony looked up from the book. He frowned a little and then closed up the comic and set it aside. "Well, if you want to count the other Avengers as your family—"
"Yeah? Swell. Get your goddamned hands off of me," he said and shoved against the guy one more time.
He pushed his body against Steve's so that they were flush from chest to hip, and Steve took slow, even breaths to counter the accelerated heart rate being so close and so intimate provided. He just hoped no other parts of him would get the wrong idea about this — especially being so close to Tony. He'd hate for Tony to think — all right
"Hang on! Hold on! Well, that's not right. What if something, god forbid, happened to you? How are we supposed to explain you getting fried by a Hydra laser?"
Pepper just stared at him a moment before she went over and sat down on the couch. "I… I don't know what to say."
Tony turned to him, and he flattened his mouth a little as he reached out and patted Steve's firm chest.
Anthony had been enamored of the handsome young knight from an early age. Ten years separated them, with Steven as the elder, though as far as the Council was concerned, the knight had not shown any interest in the young heir until after the death of the King. Perhaps knowing that he had forever lost any right, title, or claim to the lands that Howard had promised him, he sought to take them by other means — seducing a naïve, young king whose carnal urges overrode his better angels. He had secured himself a position on the King's Council, and, in almost no time, had secured for himself the position of High Chancellor, the King's closest advisor, and the one person King Anthony would listen to above all others.
Tony was busy puttering around, humming to himself as he set up a plate of bagels and some small containers that, well, Steve didn't know what they were. As Tony turned and reached into a cabinet, Steve craned his neck to check out the goods and saw something about 'cream cheese' printed over the foil cover of the container. He shrugged as Tony turned back around, two mugs in hand, and said, "Can never have enough coffee," then set them on the counter and went over to another counter where some apparatus was…brewing coffee, maybe? It didn't look like a vacuum pot nor one of those French press things he'd seen, but the scent was unmistakable.
Steve moved his hand some to brush his thumb against Tony's bottom lip and Tony, the fast- moving bastard, took the pad of Steve's thumb in between his lips and kissed it, suckling at it just the slightest before he let it go. It sent a shot of something straight down to Steve's groin, and Tony's husky response to that didn't do much to help matters.
Steve grinned, trying for the boyish charm that had disarmed Tony in the car. "Come on! Not even a little hint?"
"No," Tony said, fury in his eyes and jaw hardened. He folded his arms and added, "No, I want to know. What made you think I wanted to break up with you?"
Steve dumped the cooked eggs into a serving bowl and set it on the table, pressing a kiss to the top of Tony's head as he did so.
Barnes opened his mouth to no doubt snap something right back, but Steve got there first with a disappointed, "Hey! Watch your language," which made both Barnes and Wilson turn on him in surprise and confusion.
was taking that from him — forced to contain himself to the Iron Man armor and use the voice modulator lest anyone notice that there was something…odd about Tony Stark. But that was the only time he saw the outside world. He didn't think there was actually anything keeping him from venturing outside into the daylight, and in fact, it would probably be better for him this way. No one knew him in this body, and so he could walk the streets unencumbered. But he had little desire to leave the building except for Avenging because… Because…
But Bucky had eventually confided in him — after Tony had already told him — that there was some more cleanup that had to be done; namely, additional Winter Soldiers that Steve was sure even SHIELD didn't know about and a book that held the sequence of words needed to trigger the Winter Soldier. Much as he trusted James Buchanan Barnes with his life — and, more importantly, with the lives of his husband and daughter — he knew he wouldn't rest easy until that book was in his hands and he was lighting the match to burn it out of existence.
"New crayons?" she asked, excitement coloring her voice. "Eh," he said and hit the button for the elevator, "close enough."
Oh, there was the usual media blather about it and whether it was true or not and what this meant for everything including the price of milk, and yes, now all sorts of people were coming out of the woodwork to say that they, too, had been 'experimented on by aliens,' but it didn't affect the Avengers to the degree that Tony thought it might. Except for the usual blowhards (and, now that he thought about it, all ones that happened to be employed by Ty fucking Stone's empire), no one was calling for a Senate investigation, no one was calling for them to be locked up (even David Welch had given up banging that particular drum — even if he questioned everything to their validity to their heroism to their style choices on a given day), and only the most reactionary of cable news networks was pushing hard on the 'Is Tony Stark really a
"We could what?" Tony asked, innocent enough, but there was enough of a leading tone in his voice that Steve knew he knew exactly what Steve wanted but wanted to hear Steve say it himself.
Tony scratched the back of his head, his fingertips hitting the mass of bobby pins that were keeping his dark hair up in the French twist Natasha had done for him. "Because, honestly, we —
He shrugged and looked back down at the baby feeding from him, meeting her dark eyes as he took her tiny wrist between his thumb and forefinger, her tiny hand splayed over the flesh of his breast.
Tony blinked at him. "Is this you getting me back for earlier with that stupid 'How to talk to your baby bump' bullshit?"
"Meaning?" Tony asked, and Thor smiled at him. Tony would say it was equal parts uneasy and delighted.
Steve frowned and took the thing from him. It was black and shiny on one side like it was plated with glass. There were openings in it that looked like they might have been for different plugs — one look like a miniature telephone jack — and small buttons in various places, and he looked up at Tony and said, "What's a Starkphone?"
"I'm just a kid from Brooklyn that wanted to do the right thing. That's all. You ask anyone that knew me then, before all this—" he motioned over himself; Tony presumed he meant the very fit body, "—they'd tell you I was a snot-nosed punk that didn't know when to back down from a fight, that I had something to prove. I'm not a saint. Far from it."
Or, at least, that version of Tony and Pepper were OK. No telling whether or not this version would be. If they were even different versions, anyway.
"Really?" Steve asked like he wanted to make absolutely certain Tony had meant exactly what he'd said, and Tony ran his fingers through his hair and said, "Uh, yeah. So, I mean, I wasn't
"No," Steve said with a curt shake of his head. "There's no discussion. They don't touch either of you. They don't get to either of you."
a kid from an alternate universe. No way in hell were his culinary skills anything that could ever be considered remotely…good.
"Yeah, well, he hears my voice every day," Tony said and shoved the other half of the sausage link in his mouth.
"No, this is the table we we've been at for at least half-an-hour now," Pepper said. "You got lost, didn't you?"
Tony seemed to relax at that, letting out an exhale and smiling some as he nodded. "You're welcome," he said then puckered his lips and went up on his toes to give Steve a kiss. Steve reciprocated, puckering his lips and meeting Tony's mouth in a chaste peck of the lips, and when Olivia let out her first whine of the morning, Tony broke the kiss and said, "Yeah, OK, time for your nap, baby girl."
The reaction of the room appeared to be somewhere between 'What?' and 'About time,' and Tony shushed them and said, "Look, we convinced the clerk to give us a license, but we have to wait a fucking day to use it, but he said he'll marry us personally if we get our asses there by 3:45 tomorrow, so—" He pointed to all of them. "No fucking around. I am getting married tomorrow come hell or high water. End of story." He then produced a small blue Tiffany's bag. "I have a ring and everything that Steve practically embarrassed the shit out of me to get because he thinks 'douchebag hipster' is an appealing shade on him."
"He can't be," Bruce said. "His body won't be able to handle it. He has heart problems, a slightly reduced lung capacity, liver damage from years of alcohol abuse not to mention residual effects from palladium poisoning—"
"Are you kidding?" Tony muttered as he looked at the study in contrasts. There was Steve, tall and handsome and young and fit and ripped and possessing a shoulder-to-waist ratio to die for, ninety-six-years-old and not the hint of a wrinkle or gray hair.
"No," he murmured and gave the bump some consideration. He ran a hand over it, inquisitive and yet protective, the flash of his diamond and sapphire wedding band catching in the light, and turned to Steve. "I just can't believe— I mean, this is really happening."
"Try me, big fella," he said with a lusty growl that…he totally didn't intend to sound so wickedly depraved.
He carried the baby upstairs and into her room, and he sighed out a groan and said, "OK, kiddo, I don't like this any more than you do."
"I understand what the term means on Midgard. It may not seem to be so, but it is a blessing bestowed upon you by life herself. It is a gift, and a sacred one at that. I know it does not seem as such, but you should be honored that the Goddess Esmeralda felt your bond with the Captain deserved to be solidified and celebrated in such a manner."
— and you'd just plunge right into me, hard and fast like you're trying to teach me a lesson, like you're trying to fuck me into submission.
He set his coffee down on the table and went over to scoop her up. She squealed in delight and babbled something, and Tony cuddled her close and blew a raspberry against her cheek and said, "OK, kiddo, time for a nap."
Steve chuckled a little but put his arm around Tony's waist and led him out of the bedroom. He helped him down the stairs, and Tony was about to head in the direction of the elevator to take them to the communal floor when he heard light talking coming from the kitchen, and he and Steve stopped in the middle of the living area. Steve grinned and nodded at the kitchen and said, "Family kitchen."
There were sirens in the distance and the sounds of creaking steel not too far away and the usual chatter of fight communication chirping in his ear, but for that moment, all Steve saw — all Steve heard — was Tony, lying in front of him, looking like he was about two seconds away from a full-blown panic attack.
He was very, very tempted to scrawl out 'got knocked up by a super soldier,' but he didn't think Steve would approve of that and, plus, as
"Yeah?" He tugged him a little closer. "Well, you're stuck with me, so you'd better learn to live with it. Just like you'd better learn to live with my 'sucky' cooking and my 'lazy ass' that can't be bothered to run a dishwasher."
"I never drank Postum!" he said like Tony had just uttered the most vicious lie about him. He went quiet a moment then added a little reluctantly, "My ma made me drink it a few times— but I never did it willingly! Some people used it as a coffee substitute during the war because coffee was rationed."
"Hmm?" he asked and set the clippers aside before he reached into the cupboard for a mug. "Yeah, I know. Ninety-six-years-old and you still don't know how to not put your foot in your mouth when you're talking to people."
"Jesus Christ," Tony muttered and rolled his eyes again, and he felt Steve squeeze his hand as Steve said, "So, what do we do?"
Her eyes went wide. "Anna Tasha?" she asked, almost unable to contain the excitement and glee in her voice.
, I could probably get you through the rest of this, but I don't want to, Tony. I don't want to do it. I don't want to be responsible for that. I don't want to deal with that. You know what I want? I want you to go to someone that deals with this on a regular basis. I want you to go to someone that knows what to look for. I want you to go to an
Tony continued to sob as Natasha led him out of the kitchen, and he sucked in an uneasy breath — breathing had become more difficult, too, the bigger he'd gotten — and said a pathetic, "I don't know why."
Well, sort of. That future Steve had looked pretty bruised and bloody, and there was clearly some sort of chaos on the other side of that portal. But he and Steve were evidently still together and still happy, so he counted it as a win.
"Merry Christmas, honey," he murmured in return, turning his head slightly to brush a kiss to Tony's forehead.
"How?" Pepper asked. She reached out to the table and picked up what Tony suspected were the remnants of her drink. "Because he paid to get in.
much got broken, and Darcy was too busy trying to chug wine coolers on a dare to bother Tony with questions about orgasms or masturbation, and overall people seemed to have a good time — even Steve, who looked like he secretly was appreciating the hell out of the attention and the 'Happy Birthday!'s that kept being thrown his way. He was a good sport about the presents, most of which seemed to be gag gifts centering on him being both 'Captain America' and having his birthday on Independence Day. And as for the cake—
"No," Wilson. "No, no, that's— That's totally—" He looked between Steve and Tony. "I demand a recount."
"Just…" He swallowed yet again. At least he could swallow. He couldn't breathe, but he could swallow. "Give me some time, OK?" he asked, and Steve held his gaze a moment before he nodded his understanding, and Tony turned and stepped onto the already-opened elevator, Barton presumably having taken the stairs.
"Because you're afraid to let yourself hope for even one second that it might be true. Because if you let yourself think it's true and then it turns out it's not, you're afraid it'll hurt that much. You'd rather not feel anything than put yourself in a position to get hurt."
"You think maybe it's some sort of extortion scheme from one of your conquests over the years?" Rhodey called out to him. He whirled around and made a sour face at him.
He pulled it out, closed the door with his elbow, and took it over to the counter. He unwrapped it, the scents of processed deli meats and cheeses along with lettuce, tomato, onion, bread, and dressing creating a delicious symphony of smells that made his mouth water and his stomach grumble with desire. Or was that this fucking child looking for another free handout?
"Not your fault," Tony said and pulled some toilet paper off the roll, wiping his eyes with it before he blew his nose, loud and honking, then tossed the used tissue at an adjacent wastebasket. Steve frowned at that, looking like he wanted to reach out and comfort but thought maybe the touch would be unwelcome.
Tony snorted a laugh and grabbed what he presumed was a pot of coffee from the counter appliance. "Avenger-shit is insanely popular. I think we're up there with Star Wars and Frozen."
"I know you got what they call 'delusions of grandeur,'" Wilson said, but Barton just waved him off, and Thor smiled a little in what Tony was calling 'bemused perplexity.'
"Tony, I know you can be Iron Man," Steve said and moved to follow him as he went back over to the suit. "But I can't trust that you won't get hurt—"
Steve and Sam exchanged 'hellos' with her after the happy couple had finished their greeting, and once they had, Sam asked, "What do you mean he does?"
"Hmm…" she said with a predatory smile, "I'm going to do something special for you tonight." She reached down into the tight, hot gap between their legs and made like she was stroking him.
As Rosemary made her way down the hallway, knife at the ready, Tony looked down at his belly, and he swallowed and rubbed his hand over the swell some more and said, "
"Don't mention it. Just remember that I expect the same from you. Not that there's a chance that anything like that could happen, but— Wait, what am I talking about? Is your best friend being turned into a Soviet assassin any more far-fetched than me being turned into a woman?"
Tony couldn't tell if Steve was joking or not when he very seriously asked if it was possible to buy the internet.
Natasha raised an eyebrow, and that was when Steve, naked as the day he was born, came in from the bedroom, saying, "Have you seen my—"
He made like he was going to get up, and Barnes just looked at him like he couldn't honestly tell if he was joking or not, but Barton said, "You really want him to murder you in your sleep, don't you?"
"Free country, J," he said and swung the car into the basement garage for the Tower. He pulled through the gate then waited for it to close behind him before he pulled around and parked the car back in its appointed space. He shut the car off and leaned back in the seat, head hitting against the headrest, and he groaned and rubbed his eyes and struggled with the thought of having to get out of the car. He'd been cooped up like that for over three hours, and his muscles were screaming with ache and with exhaustion, but he just didn't want to move. Not yet.
"You know," Tony said, getting off-topic for a second, "I'm sure JARVIS recorded the footage if you wanted to see… What? What's that—?
"Boiling the flavor out of everything?" Steve said and went over to where Olivia lay in the carrier. He gently and carefully picked her up, making sure not to jostle her too much, then cradled her against his broad chest, one hand supporting her head while the other supported her tiny bottom. Tony watched a moment as he swayed a little with her, murmuring something to her before he bowed his head to brush his lips against the crown of her own small head, and Tony smiled as he watched her little eyes finally flutter shut as she relaxed in the secure embrace of her daddy.
Steve hummed then said, "Yeah, you do," and moved his arms to wrap them around Tony. Tony went with it, finding safety, security, and pleasure in being wrapped up in Steve's arms.
How come? Oh, well, hold on, he had to jump in his DeLorean and talk to his future, alternate universe self a moment.
"Not exactly," Tony said, tilting his head back and forth like he was weighing his response. "She, uh, she kind of has it in her head that Steve and I are 'soul mates—'" he used finger quotes on the phrase, "—and she thinks that, as 'soul mates,' Steve and I are supposed to be fruitful and multiply or some shit like that.
The door to the workshop opened, and Bruce slouched through looking sad and a little humbled. He rolled his eyes and moved away from the suit and over to the station where he kept the first aid supplies.
Thor just smiled a little. "For all the advancements that have been wrought on Midgard, there is still much your fellow man has yet to advance to."
, "—and all of a sudden this yellowish-orangeish portal opens up and she comes tumbling through, and she immediately starts calling me 'Papa' and Brucie 'Uncle Bruce' and generally acts like she knows us and knows the place."
But she waved him off and said, "Yes, I know. The Captain explained it to me already. But you wish me to get rid of the child that grows in his womb, and I cannot do that."
So, he forced himself to ignore those thoughts and instead closed his eyes and listened to some noisy, jangly thing that must have been called 'Step into Christmas' and enjoyed the feel of warmth and security.
Steve looked like Tony had just ripped his guts out from him, face fallen, eyes pained. "I really wish you wouldn't."
DUM-E beeped like he was acknowledging, and as he picked up the magnifying glass, Barnes said, "This is a joke, right? You're joking. You've got me on camera, don't you?"
"I told you. I can offer your bonded immortality to match yours, or I can offer you mortality to match his."
"—Yeah, that's—" He shook his head. "That's not what a best friend does. I think you should demote him."
Steve and Tony exchanged looks once again before Tony nodded and said, "That's about the long and short of it."
Tony jumped up and moved away from him. "Yeah, no, if you're just going to pull that shit again, no, there's nothing to listen to. You are
Tony followed, quietly, surprisingly, and once they'd gotten to the top, Steve let go of Tony's hand right by the door to their room and said, "Go on. I'll be in in a sec. I just need to put this little sleepyhead down."
—" He stopped talking and shook his head. "I know it was Hydra. I know it was Hydra that brainwashed him and turned him into a mindless assassin. You're right. I can't hold that against him any more than I can hold what Barton did while he was Loki's pawn against him. I don't know if the international community will see it the same way that I do, but I'm willing to… You don't have to do it alone. You don't have to bring him back from the brink alone. It doesn't have to all be on your shoulders. You think you failed him the first time? Fine. I can't stop you from believing that. But you don't have to do it alone now. It doesn't only have to be you helping him now. And I honestly get the feeling that Nat knows him more than she's letting on."
But Steve just swallowed once more and shrugged. "Wouldn't be the first time it happened to me. But now, I… There's just so much more to it now that I don't know if I could…"
A complete lie, of course. He totally would have asked Pepper to marry him someday if that little brat hadn't ruined it for him. Not that Bruce needed to know this.
me! You don't get to do that. Not when half your blood is currently soaked into your pants. Nope, you lost all right to lecture me about my choices when you chose to do shit like this."
Tony let out a breath once the door had closed and Bruce was gone toward the elevator, and he looked down at the newborn suckling him and said without fanfare, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry your father is dead, and I'm sorry that I'm always going to compare you to a daughter that was never mine to begin with. I'm sorry you're stuck with me. I'm sorry you're in this crazy, messed-up world where aliens open up wormholes over the city and your own government actively hunts you down and crazy space goddesses can turn you from one sex to the other. I'm sorry that there's a part of me that's honestly thinking about whether or not it would be better for both of us if I were just to give you up right here and now, and I'm sorry that there's an even bigger part of me that's so fucking selfish that even though I know it would be better for both of us for me to do that — to give you to someone that could give you all the love and affection and protection that I can't — I'm not going to let you go. Because you're Steve's. If they're right, and I'm wrong, you're all I have left of Steve, and if that's the case, then I'm sorry that you're the second Stark child in a row that will be forced to listen to tales of the great Captain America, and you'll probably spend your adolescence wondering if, given the choice, I would rather have him here than you."
Wilson ignored him and said to Sharon, "Seriously, do not say anything bad about Cap's princess unless you want him to give you that guilt-inducing Stare of Disappointment."
"Have they said much about us today?" he asked as he put the sound down low and just read the chyron at the bottom of the screen.
"Well," he said and dropped the towel on the table to go back to the stove, "maybe Daddy needs to take some pointers from you."
at some point, and that… Yeah, no, not thinking about that. Not going in that direction. Nope. Nope. Nope.
"Not sure what the answer was for all the other times it happened," Happy said, and Pepper smirked and rolled her eyes while Tony frowned and said, "Did you two kidnap me just to abuse me and hurt my feelings?"
He pursed his lips and looked over at Steve laying flat on the table, and he sighed and got up again and went over to the bastard. There were no chairs beside the table, so Tony settled for leaning against it, and he put his hand to Steve's forehead and ran light fingers through his hair and said, "Goddamn it, Steve. What the hell am I going to do with you?"
Esmeralda nodded and pulled up another chair to sit down in front of him, facing him. "I have a suspicion."
Yes, he was allowed to use the word 'mansplain' now. Had he used it in the right context? Honestly, he really didn't care at the moment. He was on a table, in his lab, his legs spread wide as he attempted to push a ten-pound sack of potatoes out from between them, probably splitting himself in half in the process. Using a word in its correct context was completely irrelevant to him at the moment.
He took the photos back as Bruce handed them over, and Bruce said, "That's…really amazing, Tony. Crazy, but— How did you come in contact with this guy, again?"
Steve opened his mouth to say something corny and earnest, but he thought that might make Tony even more concerned, so he swallowed down the cheese and instead said a sly, "Well, there's always Madripoor to escape to when that happens."
Steve grinned, and he reached up and toyed with the blonde hair of the wig Tony had on his head. "I think Antonia Natasha is more of a brunette than a blonde, though."
Tony took in Barnes's words, parsing them as much as he could with the fog that had enveloped his brain during this last trimester of the pregnancy, and he wondered if Wilson was doing this on purpose — treating Barnes this way on purpose. Not entirely — there was probably some element of jealousy involved because the new best bro was afraid of getting discarded for the old, returned best bro — but maybe Wilson had seen that what Barnes needed was not to be reminded of the good, old days or to be handled with kid gloves but to be treated as a human being with agency and free will, and maybe a pissing match was the best way he knew of to do something like that.
"How else should I say it? I got a bun in the oven? The rabbit died? Up the duff? Or how about 'in the family way'? That one at least sounds somewhat classy."
, and just admit that my way sounds better and even forms better with the mouth. It's the 'S' at the end of your name and the beginning of mine. That's what fucks it up for you. It just sounds better for it to be 'Stark-Rogers.'"
"Yeah, look, Tones," Rhodey said, and Tony turned his attention to him next, "if he hurt you, I will totally kick his ass. You know that. But he does love you, and he does think the world of you. The guy's too damned earnest about that sort of thing to lie about it. Even if you kind of have to translate what he's saying into English."
To be...perfectly honest...he actually...well... There was a part of him that had wondered if he could even have children. Not just because of the serum. No, this was something that had needled him from the back of his mind — a thought to taunt him every time he so much as even considered a future where some dame (back when that had really been his only choice) had taken enough pity on him to settle down with him and raise a family with him. Always that little thought would crop up, taunting him, making him wonder if he even possessed that most base of biological functions. Oh, he definitely had that part of it — he could, well, get it up.
"A special kind of bleach you pour in your ears to clear disgusting images out of your mind," Wilson said in complete seriousness. "Wanna try it? I'll go get some."
He bit off another large chunk of his slice, and Tony watched him a moment then said, "Are you saying this because you really don't want it or you don't think you deserve it?"
Steve must have sensed he had gone too far, as he dropped Tony's wrist like it had burned him, a look of surprise on his face, and Tony glared at him, narrowing his eyes, and said, "You don't like bullies, Steve? Take a fucking look in the mirror."
"Yeah, well, look, it was your first romance, and who knows what they're doing at that age, you know? It's fine. Water under the bridge. No big deal."
He got to the top of the stairs and headed over toward the bedroom, and he was just about to step inside to use the adjoining bathroom when something compelled him to glance to the side, and his gaze caught upon the door of the room next door.
"What? Why?" Steve stopped and turned to him, concern etched over his face. "Are you OK? Are you feeling sick? Do you need—"
This was definitely the kind of behavior that could get him demoted from the supervisory position he held on the night shift. Thankfully, his boss was only ever there two nights a month, and this wasn't one of his scheduled nights to appear.
Steve took a gentle hold of his arm and turned him toward him. Their gazes met, and Tony saw there concern and, if he was being honest with himself, a little bit of sorrow.
Steve led Tony into the hotel, up the stairs and through the ornate lobby on the way to the grand ballroom, several people pausing their conversations to watch the couple pass by, and Tony snorted a laugh and said, "Fuck, I feel like Eliza Doolittle at the ball."
," Bruce murmured, and Tony made a gabbing motion with his hand and then waved him off in annoyance. Whatever this brat had to say he neither cared nor was buying it.
"Oh, well— Steven, if you would be so kind as to procure that delicious tomato condiment you Midgardians enjoy so much?"
"No," Bruce said with a curt shake of his head. "There's no discussion here. Until that drug gets mostly metabolized by your body, I don't want you feeding her."
walking. It was actually kind of nice walking with Steve, but it was the principle of the thing. There was just something unsettling about the fact that they were alone and so far removed from civilization that, were anything to happen, no one would hear their screams, and neither one of them had anything on them to defend themselves with outside of their wits and whatever hand-to-hand training they had. Actually, Steve had pretty good hand-to-hand training, and Tony wasn't so bad if he said so himself—
He slapped a hand over his face and fell back against the couch, hoping to god Cap hadn't heard that or, if he had, actually believed it was something from the TV.
"You cannot be serious," Wilson said, and that was when Tony realized they were both sharing space on the love seat, Natasha sitting on the arm of it right next to Barnes.
"The actual you putting your dick in me and filling me with a metric ton of come? No, that's all on you, babe."
Tony laughed a little. "He sort of stopped what he was doing, looked at me like he wasn't quite sure whether to believe me or not, glanced down at my crotch like he was trying to see if he could see it, so I said, 'It's called 'tucking,'' then asked him if he wanted to be in the middle. I think his brain short-circuited after that because he kind of just stood there before he stuttered out some bullshit excuse about how he had an early day tomorrow and he had some big-ass project to do, and he ran away after that."
"I'm getting distinct shades of a power-play fantasy here. And I hate to break it to you, but Cap strikes me as the type that likes to be in charge
FYI, there is sex in this chapter. Very badly-written sex. The stuff before it is safe (as in not badly-written sex).
out," and brought his mug of coffee to his mouth. He took a sip then added, "I thought you'd be happy. You're always threatening to change the locks to keep them out anyway."
"Well, I know how skittish you are about it. I don't want to offend your delicate sensibilities." "Give birth, Steve," he said and rolled his eyes. "The moment I give birth to your rather sizeable child. Seriously, if this kid isn't, at the least, ten pounds, I will be shocked."
"Sadly, I do believe it would have been a benefit to you. Pregnancy is scary enough when it's something you've wanted and looked forward to for years, never mind something that's been thrust upon you without your consent."
But the Red Witch just smiled, and she set her pen down and said, "I know why you are here. The King has not yet sired an heir, and you wish to know if there is anything I can do about that."
Steve sat back, winded by Tony's little speech. It wasn't that it floored him, and it wasn't that he believed him; it was just a
"So, this is the way it usually starts out. Doesn't have to stay that way, but we'll get to that later. And probably, you'll be standing a little closer to each other than we are—"
"Fine," Tony said, "but only 'cause I have the lights down, and if I'm not careful, DUM-E will try pouring motor oil over my ice cream again because he thought it looked like caramel sauce, and I can't see it well enough to judge it before eating it."
Barnes set the bassinette down beside the gurney, and Tony realized it wasn't exactly what he'd picked out.
He held Tony's gaze for a moment, brown and blue interlocking like they had so many times in the past, and for that moment, Steve was able to forget that the past several years had ever happened. He was able to forget the mistakes and the tears shed on both sides and the constant pain of 'what if' and imagine it was that night all those years ago when they'd gone to the Stark Foundation gala — the night he'd determined it was in both their interests to say 'goodbye.' For that moment, he was able to imagine that he'd caught himself in time, that he'd stopped himself, that he hadn't spent an evening romancing his sort-of fiancé before casting him to the wind. It was just him and Tony, just they two, together against the world like they'd always talked about.
Barnes stood there, arms folded and glower on his face. "You're not dyin', not when you got Steve's kid to take care of. Steve's kid's in the same position he was. Already lost a father. Can't afford to lose a…mother…too." Barnes gave him a funny look. "Is that what we're calling you?"
"Power's coming back on in the city in spurts," she said and sat down on the chair adjacent to him. "Which is good because I think we're in violation of our maximum occupancy."
"Yeah, yeah," he muttered with a breezy wave of his hand and made to climb into the driver's seat but was stopped by Steve's hands on his arms. He cleared his throat and arched an eyebrow and said from behind rose-tinted sunglasses, "
And who in the hell wore and off-the-rack suit-and-sweater combo to a several-thousand-dollar-a- plate gala fundraiser? Bruce didn't count. He wasn't wearing a sweater.
Tony exhaled a breath through his nose. "Dead in a ditch, for all I care," he muttered and turned on his heel to go upstairs.
Bucky nodded and made a 'there you go' motion at Steve. Steve just shook his head. "What's the point of all this?"
He had a goddamned job to do. He was a fucking Avenger, no matter what he'd done a little over a day ago. And hell, didn't pioneer women drop a kid in the morning and go back to working the land in the afternoon? If the pioneer women of old could do it, then fuck it, so could he.
"Nope. Always this color. Er, without the grays. I mean, she's definitely your daughter, too, I just don't know how I, uh…"
"Tony, we have a problem," she said while he went over to his workstation and brought up his computer.
He stared at her, slightly open-mouthed, and he blinked a couple times before she reached out and touched a finger beneath his chin and gently pushed his mouth closed. She pulled her hand back and shook her head a little.
"Fingerprints," Steve suggested suddenly, like he hadn't been listening to the past few minutes of conversation.
Steve made a face of contemplation, and Tony said, "You're thinking about it, aren't you? Wondering what it's like."
He tilted Tony's head up just the slightest and brought his mouth down to Tony's, hard, fast, possessive, like he was a man drowning and kissing Tony was the only way he could get air. Tony startled a bit and tried to pull back, but he was sick of arguing, and he was sick of fighting, and he just wanted to be
He blinked, tears that had collected in his eyes wetting his lashes, and congratulated himself for having the foresight to wear a pair of dark, over-sized sunglasses. Christ, he was an emotional mess sometimes.
"Well, it's something to consider," Steve said and cut off another piece of his waffle. "I'd like to pull Buck in, too, but we have to get this Winter Soldier business squared away first."
"How do you want it?" Steve asked after he'd finished sucking Tony's fingers, and Tony swallowed and thought back to that dream for only a second before he said, "I want you to make love to me."
"Huh?" Steve asked, but Tony nudged him and said, "I think she means the sonogram—" he turned his attention to Hill, "—and since when do
Steve just smiled at him and brought his hands up to his mouth and pressed a kiss against his left set of knuckles and then his right, and Tony rolled his eyes at the gesture (that he did not secretly think was the sweetest thing ever) as Steve frowned and looked at the bruising on his right wrist — the bruising that had gone green and yellow. His face hardened a little, his jaw tense and his lips pursed, and he stared at the bruises a moment before he murmured a slightly self-hating, "Whoever did this to you should have his ass kicked."
"You people have abysmal taste in television viewing, but glad you mentioned 'wedding,'" Tony said and grabbed Steve's hand to pull him beside him. "Clear your schedules for tomorrow, guys and dolls. Steve and I are getting married."
He dragged Steve down to the lab over his protests that he really had to go get changed and get on the 'jet, but Tony just pulled him over to his worktable and picked up the virtual interface he'd been playing with for a while and slid it over his head.
He just nodded, trying to find comfort and acceptance in her words, which only lasted until another painful contraction hit, and he took a breath and squeezed his eyes shut and gritted his teeth together. It wasn't until he felt a comforting counter-pressure that he realized he was squeezing Natasha's hand as hard as he could, almost doubling over as he worked his way through the contraction.
Tony nodded and went into the kitchen, and Steve went over to the bottom of the stairs, Olivia’s continued cries sending a sharp pain right into his heart.
your explanations. I want to know what you're doing sticking your dick into someone else behind Tony's back.
"Why would I be? It's natural, isn't it? All the stuff I've read says it's the best thing for both of you."
He stared right into Steve's unwavering steadfastness, and he adjusted himself on the table and said, "Fine," and threw his legs up and over into the stirrups. He slid down a bit to better position himself, and he threw a look back at Steve and said, "I bet that's a sentence you never would have thought you'd ever say to me back in Stuttgart."
"True believers," Steve replied and dodged gunfire before he tossed his shield at the target. "They'll fight for it until their dying breath," he said and caught the shield as it came back to him.
"Uh… What happened here?" Tony asked and motioned to the mess of pots and pans and dishes and… Was that
"No, you don't understand," he said, and Steve set the tablet on the nightstand and folded his hands behind his head to gaze up at Tony. "I… For a long time, I was a bringer of death. I made weapons that killed people. I thought I was doing it for the right reasons. I was a military contractor. I built things that I thought were protecting our guys out there doing the fighting — fighting I couldn't be bothered with. I thought it was someone else's responsibility. But I thought I was doing the right thing. I didn't realize… I saw men and women killed by the very weapons I had designed to protect them. I have so much blood on my hands, and I thought…if I got out of the weapons business, it would be enough. Then I thought if I went out as Iron Man for a while, it would be enough. Then I thought if I was an Avenger, it would be enough. I'm never going to make up for all that blood. Nothing I do can ever bring those people back to life."
"Mmm...yes, but you are also a husband and a father — and a good one at that. You bear those responsibilities as well."
Something awoke Tony in the middle of the night. He didn't know what, but he didn't question it, either.
"How?" Steve asked, utterly perplexed. He hadn't owned a car since his old jalopy back in college, but he was pretty sure all cars came with remote keyless entry nowadays.
Both their eyes went wide as they realized they'd been caught, and they quickly averted, both looking in different directions. Tony shook his head and went back to his phone, which buzzed with a new message.
The clerk put his hands up like he thought Tony was going to continue to name names, but honestly, Tony had hit the end of his list. No one else knew about his…predicament — no one that could be of any use to them, anyway.
Tony was about to say something when Steve's phone made a noise, and he watched as Steve pulled his phone from his pocket and made a slight face at what he found there.
Steve nodded his approval, and Tony went to the fridge and pulled out the half-empty jar of organic blueberry preserves. "Steve, I swear to god, if you were double-dipping in this jar—"
He was quiet a moment, staring down at the fidgety newborn in his arm, his other hand still firm at Tony's back, until he said, "I know you actually went with 'Olivia,' but she's not—?"
do this together. Because when Captain America said something, it was the absolute truth, and there was no use arguing against the truth.
Barton fumbled for purchase with his thoughts before he said, "Look, it— It was a private conversation, all right?"
"How would you even know that?" Tony snapped as Steve pulled away from him and began to look something up on his phone.
"I know," he said, Steve's hands splayed over his back as he rubbed in gentle circles. "You're absolute shit at saying it, but I know."
Bruce and Steve brought up the rear, finally, and Barton called from the pilot's seat, "Hey, Cap, you might want to do a head count. You know, make sure we're all here — everyone that's supposed to be."
mean nothing to Tony because Tony would have offered to do this with anyone. Tony pretended to be a heartless bastard, but he was anything but. Tony knew he felt adrift in this new world, and so he was helping to ground him in any way he knew how. Someone — probably Natasha — had told him about Steve never having learned how to dance, and knowing it was something Steve wanted, Tony had taken it upon himself to teach him. Because that's what Tony did. He gave because it was in his nature to give to the people he loved most. Steve just happened to be one of those people.
He led Tony out of the ballroom, and by the time they got to the elevator bank, they were blissfully alone. Steve hit the 'up' button, and as they stood there and waited, Tony pushed closer to Steve and nestled his head against his shoulder, closing his eyes as he forced himself to forget about the very real horrors that might await them at some further time.
He cringed at the word usage, but DUM-E just sped off to the blender station, and Tony called out to him, "Motor oil goes in cars, not in humans!"
"Asked if I needed to get my ears checked 'cause I was getting old." He stopped mid-stir and looked point-blank at Rhodey. "Seriously, the brass balls on that little brat!"
"Hmm…" Tony murmured, considering this as he glanced over a contract Pepper had sent over prior to the call. "They believe the attempted suicide story?"
Thor just picked up his coffee. "She is very amenable to those that wish to speak with her. Plus, I suspect she'll wish to know that her work has produced its desired outcome."
" he cried, all but begging one of them to tell him what was going on. He had a dark and sneaking suspicion what their words and actions implied, but he wouldn't dare let himself formalize those words lest they turn out to be—
He made it across the club with no sign of the table or the other three, and he rolled his eyes and glanced around. What the hell? Wasn't it back this way? The lights were down, so it was kind of hard to see, and the thumping music was so loud as to be distracting.
"Yeah, well," Steve said with a shrug, fidgety and nervous like Tony was wasting precious time they didn't have. Judging by the suddenly noticeable bulge in Steve's pants, maybe they didn't.
good," he said, clicking buttons every so often, pushing the wand over Tony's belly some more for some tortuous reason.
"Hmm?" Tony went over to the driver's side door and wrenched it open. "Doing what I should have done at that warehouse. Getting the fuck out and letting you chase after your little pal. It's what you want, isn't it?"
But he bypassed the guy and made it a few steps before some weird sixth sense came over him, and he realized there was someone following him. He turned back around to see the Long Island Lothario following about two steps behind. He grinned at him and said, "Well, I guess we're going the same direction."
Romanoff just shrugged like it was par for the course and she'd attend out of her obligation to the team. Thor was most delighted and wished to know if he would be able to bring his fairest Jane.
"And we're gonna have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap danced with Danny-fucking-Kaye, right, Tones?" Jim said, but the tone and the excitement in his voice made it sound like he was quoting something rather than coming up with it on his own.
Look, I know it probably comes off a little biased, but seriously, Steve, we are probably the most attractive couple in existence."
The next thing he knew, it was pitch black outside, and Steve was pulling the car up some secluded and partially-overgrown driveway.
Steve only now saw that Tony wore what looked like a pair of blue ones with…Steve's shield on them? Was he seeing that right? They looked worn, as though they'd been washed several times over, as did the pair Steve held in his hands. He eyed them carefully, wondering if there was something— Was this some sort of signal? But Tony was going on about the joke was on someone named Barton because his gag gift was the 'awesomest' thing he could have done for them and '
Tony couldn't help the licentious smirk that spread over his lips. "And he knows how to use that size to his advantage, too."
job Steve had done with the suitcases. Jesus Christ, didn't anyone ever teach this man not to just ball clothes up and shove them in something?
"What? That I have a responsibility to take care of her? To provide for her? To protect her? To make sure she's OK? Come on, you really think we have the technology to send her back to where she comes from? We're years away from that! Barring something falling right into our laps, she's here for the duration, and what am I supposed to do? Abandon her? Put her up for adoption? Throw her into the system? She... She loves me, Jim. She trusts me. She looks up to me. This isn't the way I looked at my father. She's not desperately looking for any way to make me pay attention to her, to get me to say,
Cap's face softened, and his lips twitched a little as he seemingly contemplated his response. "Yeah," he said, his tone annoyingly enigmatic. "She is."
"Wait, I'm a little confused. Are these good things or bad things? Because you started out with good things, but your tone is telling me these aren't."
Olivia nodded. "Good," she said, firm and proud. "And then I can do to them what Anna Tasha showed me to do. Wanna see?"
"All right, well, again, talking about this later. Uh—" He motioned to the downed agent on the floor beside them. "Would he or whoever he's with have any knowledge of—"
"About what?" Bruce asked as he gathered the samples together and made to carry them over to another part of the lab.
Barton tore open an individual portion of strawberry cream cheese and glanced between the others. "I thought this was the communal floor?"
"I don't mean them," he said. "They call me 'princess,' for god's sake. I'm sure they'll call me 'mom' until the end of time."
He frowned as he poured a large mug of coffee. "Guess it's different when you're on this side of it — the one staying behind. Usually, I'm right in the middle of it with him. Kinda miss that, if I'm being honest, but somebody's got to take care of you, and right now, I don't trust anybody but me to do it. Yeah, even your father I'm still a
He made a face as he tried to figure which drawer held the flatware, and he opened three before he found the correct one. He pulled out a small salad fork for her because he thought the dinner forks were just too big for her hand, and when he handed it to her, she just looked at him and said, "Ketchup, pwease."
"Thank you, JARVIS," Steve said and pulled open the cabinet door to find precisely what he was looking for. He pulled out the container and set it on the counter and said, "You know, sometimes I don't understand your papa," as he closed the door and went to grab a clean bottle. "Personally, I think the premade stuff would be so much easier for everyone, but he doesn't trust it. I don't think he really trusts this, either, and if he had more time on his hands, I think he'd either try to create his own formula or...well...try to produce it himself again."
The guy just stood there a moment, staring like he was trying to make sense of what had just happened, and he blinked a few times before he narrowed his eyes, his mouth formed into a scowl
Pushing through his misery, he downed five more agents — taking out his pain on the sons-of-bitches that would dare try anything at his tower, or, god forbid, dare try anything on his baby — and had just gotten confirmation from Natasha that the first fifty floors were secure when he crashed headfirst into one agent that had somehow evaded them.
Thor, not seeming to realize he'd said something he shouldn't have, pulled out the pile of deli meats and cheese and condiments he'd found and dropped them all onto the counter. He turned to Tony and beamed.
She chuckled a little and said, "Well, what I mean to ask is have they ever determined that the serum is present in bodily fluids? Saliva? Blood? Semen?"
Steve took the container of gelato and put it in the freezer, and Tony scraped at what remained in the bowl. "You know, we never finished our conversation."
"No, I'm making fun of you," he said, but Steve realized Tony still had a hold of his hands and was brushing his thumbs over Steve's clasped fingers. "To answer your question
"That's rude," he said put got up and carried the forms back to the window. He handed the clipboard over, and the girl at the desk said, "OK, Ms. Carbonell, they'll call you back when they're ready."
He just blinked at her and tilted his head some as he considered what to say. He didn't want to lie to her, but he didn't want to lead her on to think that nothing bad would ever happen. So long as there was breath in his body, nothing bad would happen to her, but him and the Cap... That one was going to be a bit tougher to navigate. Because Tony would be totally cool with playing make believe — at least for a little while, and
But Tony just set perplexed eyes on him as though the words Steve had just spoken didn't make any sense, his face suppler and more youthful looking, his chin smooth, his lips plump and red—
He curled up on his side, his hair damp even after being towel-dried by Steve, and squeezed his eyes shut tight, willing himself to fall asleep. Maybe this was all a dream. Maybe it was all just a horrible nightmare, and if he fell asleep, then he'd immediate wake up back in the normal, real world where this thing he had gotten himself into (with Steve's help — can't forget Steve's help) was completely impossible.
She nodded, and without a word, she moved over to an elegantly-arranged shelf filled with small glass vials and bottles filled with colorful liquids. She chose one of the smallest ones and took that into her grasp, and she picked up a small sachet tied with a ribbon. She carried them back over, and with a smile dancing on her lips, she said a very knowing, "I knew you would." She held up the small vial that was filled with an amber liquid. "Two drops of this into the King's wine every night for seven nights."
He felt a little pang hit him in his sternum, like he'd lost something he'd never really had, and as Steve laughed and continued to pet DUM-E and told him that no, he wasn't tossing the ball any more until Tony got his lab cleaned up, Tony thought back once more to that soft smile he'd never seen before and that hot, searing kiss that had left him weak in the knees.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Ketchup, Goldilocks. The word you want is 'ketchup.'" Steve just grabbed the bottle from the fridge, and Thor continued.
Tony shook his head and pushed further into the room, and he rolled his eyes at the way Steve just so carelessly tossed his used bath towel onto the bed after he'd grabbed a pair of black boxer-briefs from the drawer. He reached out to grab the towel from the bed, having every intention of going into the bathroom to hang it back up again, but then he caught sight of Steve's chiseled ass cheeks of perfection, and he stood there, head tilted as he watched the muscles ripple and flex as Steve stepped into the small, snug pair of underwear.
got you — there was no way he could just sit back and let the less-than-handful of others that remained fight. He had to do his part, too, as literally painful for him as it
It had been a while since Tony had done the club thing, so he was a little out of practice, and he'd forgotten how deplorable the whole thing could be when you were single and desperate for a hook-up. He tried to be polite as could be as he stumbled his way through the crowd to get to the bathrooms — fuck, he'd never had to pee so much in his life as he had the past couple of months — and he gritted his teeth as someone bumped into him and splashed their drink on him.
Tony nodded and hugged his arms around himself some more, rocking himself gently in some odd means of trying to self-soothe. "Don't think we have a choice."
"I don't think that can happen," Steve murmured and made a sour face at pedestrians taking their time as he tried to make a right onto another street.
"It's…" He shrugged and began to undress, folding his clothes and setting them on a chair set in the corner of the room. "I don't know. It's the principle of the thing, I guess."
Though evidently his alternate-universe self had felt comfortable enough to take a chance with the Cap. So far, it seemed to be working out for him.
"Because," he said, the voice conveying pure authority as he stood there with his arms folded, "we were trying to keep this quiet so Tony could go through this without the media shining a spotlight on him." He shrugged a little and added, "Doesn't really matter now. Tony's not going back to being as he was — not by her, anyway — so the sooner we get all this out in the open, the better."
The music, which had moved onto another song by this point, cut out, and all that remained was silence outside of the very faint flicker of flames.
that day or something?" Tony muttered like Barton's lack of attendance was some sort of personal affront.
But then one day Steve had brought a sketch pad and asked if Tony minded if he tried his hand at sketching one of the Iron Man suits. Tony had shrugged and said to knock himself out, and so Steve had planted himself on a chair and begun drawing. At first, Tony felt the need to make nervous conversation, but Steve had just smiled in that soft and warm way that he had and told him he didn't have to entertain him. He could go back to working on his projects if he wanted. To be honest, Tony hadn't been sure how to take that. Was he being rejected? Dismissed? Put down? It had happened not long after…that weird thing had happened to him after New York, and so he was a little sensitive to Steve and his behavior toward him.
"Not my wish, J," he said and began to search for something that resembled a waffle iron. "That's what Olivia wants you to call her, so that's what you're going to call her." He stood straight and frowned, hands on hips. "Hey, you know offhand if we've got a waffle iron in this joint?"
because they wouldn't let us see each other until we got married. It was actually kind of nice not having to share the bed with a blanket hog."
"They don't have to know the exact circumstances, you know. Physically, you are not a man, Tony. I know this is scary for you, but
"He insisted," Tony said with a shrug. "I felt bad. He wants to help. He's a menace and he's terrible and I'm probably going to have to re-clean everything he's done, but he means well."
When they finally broke apart, Steve's lips were red and wet, and his eyes were just a smidge glazed, and he watched as Steve licked his lips and swallowed, Steve's eyes skirting all over his face as he said, "So, um, is it OK?"
"Eh, it kind of does. That's not me being egotistical. It… We've seen things. It always comes down to the two of us."
When the last of the soap was washed away, Steve shut the water off and guided him back out of the shower, and he wrapped him up in a big, fluffy towel and dried him off, rubbing the towel over his skin in so soothing a way that Tony began to feel almost boneless in his grasp.
"Plus, 'princess' is ridiculously patronizing," Tony explained. "Like, oh, you're just a spoiled little pampered princess that always gets her way and people practically bow down before you and kiss your ass on a regular basis whether you deserve it or not."
Steve just let out an annoyed exhale and shook his head somewhat. "You shouldn't even have to go through this—"
at this moment, she did grow inside of me for nine months, and I did literally push her out of my body. Technically, that
Steve just folded his arms on the table and shrugged, but he smiled so that Tony hopefully knew that yes, he was, and yes, it was intentional.
Now, that was probably a sight to see. Maybe, if he ever got to meet his alternate-universe self, he could ask him for pictures. He had to have one on standby, right? Tony would if he was in that situation.
"OK, you know what—" He moaned as she worked her thumbs into a particularly nasty knot in his back. "
"Not your problem to fix," he said then kissed her cheek and got out of the car. He went over to the elevator for the personal floors and pressed the button, and he saw that Happy was waiting there, presumably to make sure he got onto the elevator OK, but Tony…really needed to lock those garage doors before he could go anywhere, and he motioned for Happy to leave. Happy put down the window and called out, "Just wanna make sure you get on OK, ex-boss."
"Did you bet him you would pay him fifteen thousand dollars if it turned out you were having a girl?"  Rhodey asked.
Tony's lips twitched as he tried oh-so-hard not to smile. He didn't want her to think he was laughing at her.
He slid his hands beneath the negligée and began to caress him outright, large hands splayed over the bump as he rubbed it, equal parts erotic and possessive.
"Yeah!" she chirped and sat up on her knees. "They have the star in the middle and then the circles that go around it—" She drew this out on the tabletop with her index fingers. "I want those waffles."
his jobs. His eyes were shielded by a pair of tinted glasses, wire frames and rose-colored lenses. The van dyke he was fond of sporting now was clipped and trimmed and so perfectly sculpted it was as though he had drawn it on. He was smiling — downright grinning — a hand in the air as he waved at a camera (but not the one that had taken this photograph) and the elegant and gorgeous Pepper Potts adorned in a stunning royal blue dress standing right by his side.
He figured if he told himself that enough times, he'd start to believe it. So far as Bruce and Rhodey knew, it was the god's honest truth. As for himself…
But Bucky was long-gone, and the thoughts were still there. And not just there but beating out a thrumming, passionate rhythm that was almost impossible to contain whenever he so much as set his sights on Tony Stark. He was a gorgeous man, lean and lithe, a bit shorter than Steve (well, if one wanted to call a good five inches 'a bit') with thick, wavy dark brown hair and feathery black eyelashes framing sharp, dark eyes and strong, calloused hands derived from a lifetime of working with them. His voice — somewhat deep and somewhat gravelly — sent shivers down his spine, especially when he'd set those dark, sharp eyes on him as he spoke them. He itched to brush the pads of his fingers against that neatly-groomed van dyke, run his thumbs over his cheekbones, comb his fingers through that dark, wavy hair that curled just the slightest in the back when it got too long…
He woke up right after that, filled with that confused feeling a person got when first pulled out of a dream and unable decipher what was real and what wasn't, and after reacquainting himself with his surroundings, he moved over to Tony's side and curled up beside him, carefully slotting himself next to his husband and putting an arm around him so that he didn't wake him up.
"Trust me. That was… That was rough. Anyway—" He grabbed Olivia off Steve's lap and settled her onto his own. "All right, baby girl. What say you go take another nap while Daddy and I clean up this ridiculous mess you made?"
He looked over the form once more to make sure he'd answered what he was comfortable answering then said, "OK, I'm done."
But then he thought of a little ball of fire with big, dark eyes and long, blonde hair and an outsized attitude for such a small body. He hadn't thought of her in so long — hadn't let himself think of her in so long, a brief snippet of a thought at the doctor's office the other day aside — that little girl that had come into his life for a handful of time and had changed him, for better or for worse. The little girl that had looked at him like the sun rose and set with him, like he was her entire world, like he could do no wrong. Papa. Her
She laughed, light and merry. "Oh, no, Captain. That's not the reason. That's not the reason at all." She exhaled a light, happy breath. "But that you must learn on your own."
"Would you like that?" he asked after a few minutes of working Tony open, watching as Tony lay back, eyes closed, bliss and relaxation and desperate want playing out over his face.
"Yeah? Well, what about when the Cap comes back? When this chatterbox little four-year-old runs at him and calls him 'Daddy' and doesn't understand why you two aren't kissing even though she thinks it's gross? She's used to a certain…
"We just opened another facility not that far from here. Some of them are in the city — Bruce, I think, is there at the moment working on one of this pet projects. The others are breaking in the new place. And evidently raiding the petty cash as we speak."
"Mmm…I'm not making fun of you, honest. That's all on me. You just deposit this metric ton of come inside of me—"
"If I turn into a fucking hippy because of this…" he muttered and pulled a bowl out of the cabinet and a spoon from the drawer. He poured a generous serving of the product he'd always thought would be better called 'crunchy granola crap' and then went over to the fridge to get the milk.
, but he spent more of his life as an assassin than he ever did as some schmuck from Brooklyn. And did I mention that he
him. How could I—? But I don't want to constantly talk about shit that happened eighty years ago that doesn't mean anything anymore. And I get the feeling that Steve…that he thinks that if we try to talk about anything else we won't have anything to talk about. I'm not the same guy I was then. Neither's he. Maybe we're too different? I don't know. I kinda want to know how the son-of-a-bitch ended up
"Like Steve?" Tony suggested, and he and Barnes finally met each other's eyes again, and they held each other's gazes a moment before Tony shrugged and added, "First of all, I don't have to forgive
Wilson breathed out a laugh then said, "Nah, honestly, you two—" He cut himself off a moment and glanced to the side like he was trying to think of exactly what he wanted to say. "
"—and sure, yeah, OK, maybe get more people talking about Captain America being seen out and about with someone that is, what they think, not Tony Stark because, you know, it's not like I have a
He sat up and glanced around the club and, trying to see through the neon and flashing lights, said, "Uh, they have a bathroom around here?"
Steve opened his eyes once more, and though his mind was very much for the idea of going another round, his dick felt otherwise. Still, he leaned over Tony and, beginning just below his navel, began to lap up the spilled come, the action earning him a breathy exhale and a, "Jesus fuck, I didn't think you'd actually do it!"
"Steve, you pull that helmet off again in the middle of a fight, I'm going to staple it to your head," Tony said, but he was too far away in the field for his words to have much weight, and Steve ignored them and instead kept up his pleading with Barnes.
He whined a little and said, "Come on, Steve! At least let me wear it for a little while. It's the least you owe me after that douche-bro shit you pulled."
And then he started making a fake snoring sound, and Tony rolled his eyes and shoved another spoonful of gelato in his mouth.
Olivia nodded. "Yeah. She's two. She's quieter 'n me. Papa says she's more like him and I'm more like Daddy. Unca Hawky says I'm fulla piss'n vinegar."
"What? No! I don't want you to carry me! I just want you to slow your ass down! Jesus fuck, Steve, we're not that far away from the cabin! I'm not going to change my mind if we don't get there in the next five minutes."
"She's been pretty fair to you guys," Barton said and shoved another spoonful of cereal in his mouth. "Not like the
There was sure to be another pervtacular comment from Barton coming his way before the end of the night.
But not content to keep that just between them, Steve made sure each and every one of their comrades knew and understood there were to be no parties nor showers nor gifts under any circumstances prior to the birth. Strangely…everyone seemed to be oddly OK with that, accepting Steve's position on the matter and agreeing with him with nary a word of protest.
"I want to be yours, Steve," he said, his voice wrecked and needy and just a shade breathless. "I want to be yours."
She frowned and tilted her head, and she kept Thor's gaze for only a moment before she directed her attention to the men standing beside him, seeming to actually
He narrowed his eyes and fought very, very hard from reaching up with the gauntlet and wrapping metal fingers around Steve's neck.
a lie because no one had actually told him to his face that it was a boy. "Like most first-time parents, we decided not to find out. But, I mean, I'd be lying if I didn't admit we're both hoping for a boy."
He never knew if Tony heard him, which was probably for the best as he'd pretty much broken that promise a little over a year later when he'd broken things off with him for good.
. You're someone to love and protect and yell at and talk to and get into trouble with. Steve looked lost — really lost and alone — when he first came out of the ice. There were times I thought he might try to take out another iceberg. I haven't seen him look that way since you and he got your heads out of your asses." She shrugged. "But again, it's a blessing and a curse."
Steve hummed, considering his options. “I don’t know. If I give you what you want, it’s not really teaching you any valuable lessons, is it?”
noticeable. Tony, towels in hand, stopped short and let his gaze dart down to Steve's lap, and Steve watched as Tony tried very hard not to smile, biting his lips, and then sobered enough to meet Steve's gaze.
Tony grinned at him, and Bruce grimaced and groaned once he realized what he'd said. "Tony, no, I'm not giving you a checkup," he said, purposely trying to work past the awkwardness of his insinuation.
Tony smiled, but there was a good deal of sadness underlining it. "Yeah, well, unless you do something completely stupid and I can't figure out a way to bring you back to life, I think we know which one of us that's going to be."
"What sort of people do we let you hang out with?" he muttered to himself and shook his head a little, and he watched as she scowled at him and sat back in her chair, arms folded.
Without waiting for a response from Steve, he turned and began to make his way to the door, and Steve grimaced a little and said, "Tony, I really don't think they're going to take it well if they think I'm seeing another woman behind your back."
"Nothing?" the man said, disappointment evident in his voice. "No patented 'Stare of Disapproval'? Nothing about Barton wasting perfectly good ammunition? Nothing about all the hard work I put into those arrows and he goes and blows through them in five minutes? Nothing about threatening to bench him to teach him a lesson? Come on, Steve, I know Christmas makes a sap out of you, but you're slipping here."
Tony, the perspective as though Steve was kneeling before him, his left hand brought out like it was being held and an 'are you kidding me?' smirk on his face.
He turned around in Steve's arms, and he looked up and said, "Positive. Make love to me. Like we used to. Before this whole crazy thing started. Take me out of my head. I want you inside me in the way that cannot possibly get me pregnant again."
, he was built, wasn't he? He kind of just wanted to…bite…Steve's stomach — sink his teeth into that hard, firm muscle and lave it with his tongue all the way down—
Tony scowled because, honestly, the more Steve questioned him, the more ridiculous he sounded and the more his defense deflated.
"And then you spend all night playing with the Cap," Bruce said then pointed at the waffle. "Is this vegan and gluten-free?"
"I don't know how he fell in with you guys, but I'm glad he did. You're good people. You like him. You bring his ego down when he needs it. I'm glad he has you. I just…hope the idiot realizes what he's got."
Tony nodded, and he took a sip of coffee and stared at Olivia's mouth, and after he'd swallowed the sip, he said, "I think she's got one that's going to start coming through pretty soon."
. Who in their right mind would willingly do this fucking thing ever again? OK, in the days before reliable contraception, there wasn't really a choice, but
"Merry Christmas," Steve replied with a smile, and he raised his glass a little, Tony matching him before they clinked the flutes together and pulled back to each take a sip. Well, Tony took a sip. Steve downed his in one gulp.
"No, man, just, no. Look, I get that you two have some sort of weird bond going on and everything, and I get that you don't want to be separated from each other or whatever, but dude, you really think it's safe?"
Steve closed his eyes, squeezing them tight as though to talk himself out of protesting. "Fine," he said and opened his eyes again to meet Tony's gaze. "If that's what you want, then that's what we do."
?" Tony said in slight alarm and looked to him for clarification. Or to quell the oncoming panic attack. One or the other. Because if Barton was implying what he thought he was implying… "I'm starting to get a picture here, and I'm not liking what I'm seeing."
Then again, Barnes was under no real pressure with Tony, the whole killing-his-parents-as-a- brainwashed-assassin thing aside. Tony really expected nothing of him. Steve was expecting, in Barnes's mind, the Barnes from seventy years ago, and that was just something he didn't think he could give him. As much as Tony hated to say it — for Steve's sake — maybe talking to Tony, opening up to Tony, was just...easier for Barnes?
"There's only the one bedroom," Steve explained and pulled away from Tony to put his arm around Barnes's shoulders, "but you could probably stay on the couch— If you wanted to stay, I mean. You don't have to stay. You don't have to do anything you don't want."
"Tidy," Steve replied then waited a beat and added, "In the old-man version, I'm definitely the neater of the two of us."
So, after all this time, Rhodey remembered, too? At least Rhodey hadn't been a dick and needled him about it, though. Rhodey, at the least, remembered that it was something they were never to talk about.
, if what he was saying was true, and there was a part of him, a very small part, that wanted to believe—
"I think you feed more than most babies," he told her as she drank. "Clearly, that's your father's fault. You have his appetite."
It was only a few blocks difference between the Tower and the hotel the Foundation was holding the gala at, but the traffic in Midtown was especially busy that evening, and hitting the right cross streets to make the turn onto Park took almost half-an-hour in and of itself. Not that Tony minded. It was less time he had under the watchful gaze of prying eyes and more time to spend with Steve, who was a little too fast-and-easy with the preset switch on the steering wheel for the radio. He perked up a little when he hit on the '40s station, switching up the volume as Tony read the screen on the dashboard and saw it was Artie Shaw's version of 'All the Things You Are.' Steve tapped out the rhythm on the steering wheel and hummed out the tune, and he glanced over at Tony, and once Tony had met his eye, he winked at him before he turned his attention back to the road and crept through an intersection, the light above them burning green as the taillights ahead of them glowed red.
He snuffled some and wiped away the tears that had begun to collect — fucking hormones — and he stepped into the warm shower and let the water run over his body. He closed his eyes and willed himself to forget about the outside world for a moment and focus on nothing but the way the water felt cascading down his body, the warmth, the comfort, the security it provided him.
had been keeping tabs on them, and he lost his balance as the distance between him and Steve extended beyond what his arm could reach, stumbling a bit before he gained his bearings and was able to counterbalance Steve's weight to keep them from going any further.
He made a brave attempt at going back into the kitchen where he saw Tony was making precise cuts into cookie dough with a candy cane shaped cutter, and he slipped in and took a seat at the island opposite Tony, who glanced up for only a second before he went back to his job.
But Steve just glanced between them and said, "And what would you say if an older gentleman did that to either one of you?"
Against his better judgment, he padded over to the couch and stood next to Steve. Before he could get a word out Steve broke his concentration on the tablet and looked up at him.
He tried to say 'Esmeralda,' but for some reason, he couldn't get the name out. The only thing he could seem to say was, "What if she's working with them? What if this is some crazy plot for them to get their hands on their very own super soldier?"
"We're married, Brucie. There's no mystery left. You'll understand if you ever find someone to make an honest man out of you."
(Except Peggy's, but Peggy was...not a path he wanted to travel down at this moment — not when he could still remember how her lips felt on his and the hopeful promise of a date that was never to be. He wondered briefly if she went anyway, even if just to have a drink in his memory. He couldn't even go and do as much — toast to a what-might-have-been. The club wasn't there anymore. He'd checked.)
She picked up the phone and dialed an extension, and as she murmured to somebody about something, Tony looked to Steve and said, "Wait, whoa,
; he was just who he was. Bucky had always been concerned that he was setting himself up for a lifetime of misery, thinking that these perverse inclinations of his were something he could control. But he knew Bucky couldn't understand because Bucky liked the girls, and the girls liked Bucky. Bucky's fantasies had always been about soft, supple curves and light, purring voices; but Steve…well, sure, he'd had those fantasize a couple times, but he'd also fantasized about lean muscle and lithe bodies and deep, rumbling voices growling with lust.
She huffed. "Is that 'cuz you gots Jarbus instead of Friday? Friday makes sure we gots food. What happened to Friday? Can we have Friday back?"
could settle down for an afternoon nap, too). There was more to it than just him anymore, and it mattered how this conference played it. It mattered for the team and how effectively they could do their jobs, and it mattered for him and Steve and how much slander and libel would come from it and how much privacy they'd be entitled to from here on out.
Unfortunately, Natasha seemed to sense something about his words or his tone as well, as the look she gave him was equal parts bland and soft — which meant she was concerned but was trying not to show it. Tony ignored her and instead reached out to grab a slice of toast but frowned when he saw it was plain with neither jelly nor butter to show for it.
Esmeralda hummed in thought then said, "Well, if he asked to remain, I would have let him, of course. But he wishes to be changed back to his former form, and he
"I take it," Thor said, drawing Steve's attention away from Tony, "this is a time-honored tradition with you that even goes back to your youth?"
"More than I ever wanted to know about what goes on behind the bedroom door of our esteemed leaders," Barton muttered while Romanoff nodded her agreement.
"I love you, old man. And you're not useless without me. I can't lead that mixed bag of nuts we call the Avengers. I mean, I
Tony shifted his gaze over to him, and remembering that shit he'd pulled back when he'd taken blood — when he'd forced Tony to contemplate the idea that it
Wilson started to say something, but Tony cut in, "Yeah, we need to have a talk about that." He could feel the air in the jet change, tension suddenly seeping in where there had been none.
Thor frowned and turned to Hill. "I am sorry to hear of the passing of your loved one. I am certain that the heralds of—"
Tony rolled his eyes again and said, "You are so close to sleeping on the couch you don't even know."
She checked her phone. "So far, so good." She turned to them and said, "Why don't you go back upstairs and let us deal with this?"
She shrugged. "Suit yourself," she said and nodded at Maria that they'd be in presently. Hill nodded her understanding and went back into the room, leaving the door ajar, and Natasha went over and said, "Point of no return."
Welch motioned around him. "Supporting the cause. I've been a fixture at these Foundation galas for years—" He shot a look at Tony. "Isn't that right, Stark?"
"They confirmed they lost communication with him when it went down," Natasha said, trying to keep her composure, but Tony saw the way she swallowed.
"What bargain?" Steve asked, but there was a charge of energy in the air and then, in a flash of amber and lavender light, she was gone, and Steve and Tony were alone.
"No, Tony, I'm not, uh… It's fine. I'm fine. I'm just going to go brush my teeth. Stop being so paranoid."
was fucking dead as a doornail — or so everyone thought — and Steve had been pushing forward with his life.
The others all shrugged their agreement with him, and Tony turned to Steve and said with a petulant whine, "
Maybe he'd been a nuisance to Howard, but not to his mother. His mother had loved him, had wanted him, had taught him so many wonderful things in her soft, gentle way, had had to play the buffer between him and Howard for so long, had been the patient, reasonable one. He might have been a pain-in-the-ass and a burden to Howard, but to his mother…
"Yeah, well, jury's still out," Tony said and grabbed a breadstick. He caught Steve's eye then began to mouth the breadstick rather suggestively, dragging the tip of his tongue from one end to the other before swirling his tongue over the end and then taking it halfway into his mouth.
before there's even been a wedding. It— It just feels like tempting fate to me. Look, I'm not saying we can't eat someone else's rejected wedding cake tomorrow after the ceremony, just…" He made a face and scratched his forehead. "I just don't think we should do it tonight," he finished, a little weak, like he wasn't comfortable with sharing what was probably some sort of old-fashioned and outdated rationale for not wanting to eat the rejected cake.
for sex. Not because he needed it so desperately. He'd gotten Pepper that needy and desperate once, but he had to admit that her voice had never sounded as wrecked as he knew his own voice had just a second ago when he'd almost choked on the words.
He pulled out most of the way, allowing Tony to mouth the tip and swirl his tongue over it, dipping the tip of his tongue into the slit, and Steve stroked his hair some more then tipped his head back slightly and said, "Take a deep breath."
Honestly, he wasn't sure where the 'Natasha' name had come from. He didn't think it was from their Natasha, but maybe it was. Something had just compelled him to use that name, and he'd almost given the name 'Stark' as well until he'd caught himself right at the last moment and used his mother's maiden name instead. He knew Steve knew his mother's name, so he wouldn't find the last name questionable, but yeah, OK, maybe using 'Natasha' for the first name was a bit… leading.
"You're lucky I love you. Come on, I'll take you home, and then I'll see if I can find a grocery store that's still open."
One lone flash went off while the assembled crowd looked at each other again, and Tony huffed a little and rolled his eyes.
He blew out a breath and thought about how best to explain it. "It's a tough kind of life," he finally settled on. "A lot easier to just find yourself a dame and settle down with her."
"Oh!" the woman said in an attempt to be helpful. She pointed to a little alcove beside them and added, "Through there."
Tony just scratched 'microfiber' from the list and didn't dignify Steve's statement with a response, and Steve was quiet a moment before he cleared his throat and said, "So, uh, Natasha said something about this charity ball thing we have to go to?"
He startled a bit and looked at the door. Yes, that was definitely a little man figure on the door, and he glanced down at his rather visible cleavage — and so did the stock broker — and said, "Oh, yeah, right."
"It's you," he said before he could stop himself, and Cap turned his attention back from the woman to Tony. "You... It's your expression that I kept seeing on her face. How...? How is that possible? She's my daughter, isn't she?"
"Hmm…I'd love to, but see, I'm used to sleeping next to a big, strong furnace, and you took my big, strong furnace away from me, so I'm not really sure I'm going to be
Tony shrugged, making sure not to jostle the baby. "I guess. He's not so bad—" He frowned as he watched Steve just swallow and nod then glance away, and Tony cocked his head to the side a moment and said, "Wait, is this— Are you
"Suck," he ordered, and Tony took the digits in Steve's mouth and began to suck, his jaw still a little sore from earlier but nothing he couldn't work around.
"Well, look," Tony said, "she's not just some crackpot that snuck in off the street. Whoever sent her here intentionally sent her here."
That seemed to be more than enough explanation for Steve. "Oh," he said after a pause and looked down at the baby in his arms. "Oh, then he probably—" He looked up at Tony. "Did you ever explain it to him — what had happened or what was going on with you?"
Tony nodded and pulled at his tie, loosening it before he pulled it over his head, and he dropped it on the floor and began the walk down to the bathroom, dropping his clothes on the floor along the way.
have to go through something like this — telling him what he already knew like some sort of mansplaining pain-in-the-ass.
Thor opened his mouth to protest, but Barton said before he could, "Yeah, I'm sure Frigga and the All-Father were just spectacular parents to you, but I'm guessing your crazy brother didn't get the same encouragement?"
Steve met his gaze, and Tony held it, boring into him almost like he was trying to force his will on Steve, until Steve finally relented and said, "Yeah, OK."
"Cuppa days. Papa says he'll be gone for a few weeks." She frowned up at Bruce and said, "Unca Bruce, how long is a few weeks?"
of the Chancellor, you will be doing the kingdom much more harm than you can imagine," she said, her voice dark and low, and another odd chill overcame the men. "I would not even entertain such thoughts."
Steve shrugged and swallowed his bite before he said, "Seriously, Tony, don't— Whatever you're planning,
"Yeah? Well, whose fault is it that I'm even in this predicament in the first place? Shouldn't you be the one to fix what you fucked up?"
a line at the ladies' room? — but he was eventually able to get in, do his business, and get out without having to hear about how much some random woman wanted his husband to knock her up.
"Merry Christmas to you, too, snickerdoodle," Tony said, his back to him as he continued to sort the presents into piles. "Help yourself to some coffee and cookies."
Steve recognized the makings of a Tony Stark pout when he saw one, and the water dripping down his forehead and into his eyes, he went over and took a gentle hold of Tony's arm.
, which I didn't think was supposed to happen until everything was said and done, but whatever. Oh, and it's not just my tits that leak,
Tony picked his own glass up. "Here's mud in your eye," he said and held his glass out. "Haven't heard that one in a long time," Steve said and clinked his glass with Tony's. "See? Don't say I don't make an effort to understand your antiquated ways."
Pepper had pursed her lips into a flat line, and she shook her head a little and stared at him, almost like she was disappointed in his attempt to rationalize with himself.
But Bruce ignored him and said, "Your Daddy and your Papa— Do they tell each other they love each other?"
There was a small, hysterical part of him that didn't even actually believe what was happening to him, that tried to play it off, that assured him this was all some long, drawn-out, drug-fueled, crazy, protracted dream. Many times he was tempted to give into that frenzied part of himself because that part of himself sure as shit sounded much more rational and sane than the part that was trying to convince him that he really
"That's why they gots married. Like you 'n' Daddy did. But I wasn't there when you 'n' Daddy got married, was I?"
"Yeah, we may have run into some of our buddies while on the lookout for Cap's pal," Barton said. "You have that prototype you've been working on? We're headed right back out."
Barton rolled his eyes. "Look, trust me. It had nothing to do with either of you or any of this. It was a
Tony hummed a little bit and looked up from his phone, pressing a button on the side to shut it off as he did so. "Well, hindsight is 20/20, so they say. I'm not really interested in dwelling over the past, anyway. I'm much more interested in what's to come."
Steve hooked a right onto Twelfth Avenue and floored it up the roadway, humming along with the song and tapping the beat out on the steering wheel, and Tony watched in slightly bemused amazement as this relic from the '40s rocked out to 'Free Bird' of all songs.
Steve just swallowed and nodded, pursing his lips and blinking as he did so. Then he shrugged a little and added a simple and factual, "Who was me."
"Really? That's catching on?" Tony muttered, drumming his fingers on his abdomen and getting what felt like a foot shoved back at him for his efforts.
Steve inhaled a sharp breath through his nose, and he set his jaw and glanced up to make the acquaintance of the gray-haired man standing above them, a glass of champagne in his hand and an air of pretension stinking up the place. He had a sort of professorial look about him, educated but somehow having learned the wrong lessons from it or cynical enough to exploit the wrong things to the detriment of others from it.
"What words?" Natasha asked, gaze focused on the screen, her finger hovering over something on a tablet.
Wilson shrugged like it was an idea that couldn't hurt while Tony snorted out a laugh and said, "Are you kidding? He won't listen. 'Til the day he dies, he will remain steadfastly convinced he's too old for me."
Tony faked another gasp and continued to rub his belly. "Steven! How could you? Here I am, trapped in this rather well-designed and energy efficient tower—"
Barnes was quiet a moment before he said, "Wait, was this the one you rescued from the bottom of the ocean or something?"
Steve just shot a sidelong smile at him and dunked the strip of bacon in the egg yolk before he shoved it in his mouth.
"Esmeralda, you are meant to bless couples, not burden them with issue they cannot handle," Thor said.
Granted, an exhibit opening at a gallery wasn't exactly much to get people excited about, and not only was it not Tony's preferred way to spend an evening (foot rubs and gelato were where it was at as of late), but it was doubtful that Tony's appearance there would even get picked up by anyone outside of the 'art crowd.' Still, Tony wanted to go to the gallery with Steve, who, knowing Tony's overall opinion of anything that constituted 'art,' just looked at him like he'd suddenly grown two more heads and said, "Are you sure?"
Bucky sat back and shook his head. "I told you, I am fine where I am. Unruly five-year-olds on a school trip and asshole teenagers looking for a place to make out are about as stressful a level as I'm willing to handle."
"Don't even pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about," he said. "It is an American classic, and you've all seen it."
But Tony was having none of it and said, "Yeah, and her nails grow like nothing I've ever seen. Now, close your eyes, you big wuss," as he took Olivia's tiny little pinky between his fingers and positioned the clippers.
The doors opened, and they stepped onto the elevator. Bruce hit the button for the penthouse. "What? Wait, hold on! I don't want to—"
— was the same, that of 'Iron Man,' but the Iron Man of that other world, so far as he had been told, wasn't just an 'Avenger' (it
hadn't changed any — personality-wise, at least. He was still the same Tony that he was. So, if Steve could have a 'Tony' in spirit and an…oh, hell,
Steve heaved out a breath as he stood there, arms folded with hands tucked into his armpits. "At the moment, there's not much we can do about it. Thor is very much of the opinion that Esmeralda means exactly what she says about the fetus's life being tied up with Tony's. Tony lets it grow and develop, he'll be OK. He tries to terminate it in any way, he'll kill himself, and that's not happening."
"Here, Tony, do you want to feel?" Bruce asked him after he'd told him to let up on pushing for a second, and Tony panted, sweat dripping down his face and the hair that had come loose from his ponytail hanging limp as he glared at him, wondering what in his right mind had even possessed him to ask such a ridiculous question. He stared at the well-meaning idiot a moment, panting, then said, "Yeah, I'm good."
Thor cleared his throat, still toying with Mjolnir as he said, "The Goddess Esmeralda's hexes are unbreachable. I do remember now that she places protection upon each conception that she blesses. It is to prevent it from being undone. The health of the mother is most important to these spells. So long as the mother remains healthy, so, too, shall the child that grows in her womb."
"Well, don't say it too loudly or she'll be back to wreak havoc on our lives once again. I think one of us getting ourselves in trouble is more than enough."
, as I'm sure you both know him, and you may be successful in getting him cleared of all the charges of those heinous crimes, but you'll never wash the blood off his hands."
"Thought you didn't?" Rhodey said around a mouthful of pizza. "Thought she's from an alternate universe?"
Steve frowned at him. "Tony, please," he said, the words taking on a rather pleading tone. "Go to bed. You're exhausted. You're over-tired."
Tony heaved out a breath but didn't move his hand from Steve's thigh. "Yeah, and twenty-five of those years were spent in a glacier."
Tony popped the lid on the iron and pulled the waffle out onto a plate. "Any chance Hydra shot their load on this one, and they'll just crawl back to whatever demonic hole they came from and never be heard again?"
Barnes, to his credit, seemed as uncomfortable with the whole endeavor as Tony was, and Tony scratched the back of his head then motioned to the chair he'd set up beside the worktable.
important…Nope, not interrupting anything at all…Huh? No, but I'm thinking I may have to separate all of you…It's called being a 'responsible adult'…Probably not until at least tomorrow…Yeah, well, you'd better all be on your best behavior when I get back…If that's what it takes…I'm not— Fine, yep. Talk to you later."
Pepper groaned, and Tony tried to remember the last train of thought he'd been on. OK, the last one before the memory of what he and Steve had done last night. Fuck, was it warm in here?
"Kind of. I mean, not that I want to stay this way forever, but…" He made a face again, flattening his mouth and continuing to avoid Steve's gaze as he folded his arms, resting them over the decorative little ribbon of material that sat just under his breasts. "I don't know," he muttered. "I'm not going to stay this way
"I wish you wouldn't say it like that. And I know you, and I know you weren't about to ask Bruce if you could help it."
"Um, security breach," he said as Bruce succeeded in pulling her away, which evidently raised DUM-E's concern, as he beeped a little and raised his arm like he was looking out for his
Tony dropped his head so that his chin touched the top of his breastbone, and he took a breath through his nose and let it out before he looked up at her and said, "I know, honey, but how 'bout you leave the heroics up to Daddy and Papa and the other Avengers until you get a little older, OK?"
He put a hand to his belly, protective, like he dared anyone to get through him. Weird. He wasn't sure he'd ever actually felt
"Look, sweetie, I love you, and that's very thoughtful of you," he said, dropping the instruction booklet onto the table as he watched Steve set the parts on the floor and reach in for what was left. "But one of us is more mechanically-inclined than the other. Besides, we don't even need that yet."
looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there, and Tony didn't even stop himself from wishing Barnes had gone out while Steve had stayed back. Fuck, let Barnes do his penance by being Captain America for a while. Steve could stay home and do the much more important job of tending to Tony's every whim and desire.
Steve sighed and sat back in his chair and rubbed a hand over his face. "That doesn't make any of what he said untrue," he said, and Tony took that as a good sign that he was done asking about Ty because Tony was totally done thinking about him.
Deciding Steve had shifted back into a better mood, he reached out and switched the radio back on. He put it on low so as it was more white noise than anything else, tuning the station back to that '70s one because it came the closest to splitting the difference between them. He settled back into his seat, nestling his head against the headrest again.
"His pal Barnes just died," Tony told the man, a weird and almost knowing tone to his voice. Wilson nodded his understanding, and Steve narrowed his eyes at the exchange. There was something funny about it — it meant something, but he couldn't figure out what.
Steve stared at him a moment — like he was debating whether or not to fight Barnes on what he'd said — before he took a breath and squared his shoulders and nodded his understanding.
Barton just motioned to them. "Girl. And, my favorite— Cap, what does your little princess over there threaten to send you out into the cold, dark streets of New York at three o'clock in the morning to retrieve?"
Outside of being in the Iron Man suit and a horrendous evening at a club that I'm half-tempted to buy and bulldoze, I haven't been outside of this joint in
He rolled his eyes. "Steve had to be restrained from strangling her, and once he found out the truth of how this whole thing works, he went all…
Steve swallowed and wouldn't look at him. "That...when you get turned… When you go back to… If you wanted to wear something like this, I wouldn't be against it."
Steve could put up with a lot and had learned to accept a lot in his short time as a father, but trimming his tiny little girl's nails was something he...hadn't been able to handle just yet. There was nothing actually disgusting or disturbing about it save for the worst-case scenario Steve could draw up in his head, which was Olivia jerking her hand in some way just as Tony was about to clip her nail and—
and… I'm old, Steve. I know we like to play this game where you insist you're a thousand years older than I am, but you're not, and even if you technically are, you've got that nice little serum running through your veins that has stunted your aging. Not only am I aging at a normal pace, but I probably put a few thousand more miles on my body than I should have back in my younger days because how the hell was I supposed to know that I was going to end up married to the world's foremost specimen of physical perfection and I'd feel like a fucking useless old man in comparison by the time I met him?"
Jeez, Steve was more far gone than he thought if he was under the belief that there was an actual exchange of words going on between him and Barnes and not just Steve talking constantly to fill up any and all awkward silences.
references, J. Open the damned doors. There are literally three Avengers, one formerly-brainwashed Hydra agent, and an ex-SHIELD agent on-site. How many potential Hydra-lites do we have here?"
Some of the fight went out of Steve at that to be replaced by slight embarrassment, but he still held his ground and said, "Maybe it is. I just think it's bad luck to do anything like that before he's here. Once he's here, we can splurge on all the necessities — within reason, obviously — but I don't— Not before then. Not anything before then."
Bucky shrugged. "Didn't seem important. You'd already made your mind up about what was best for the two of you. He moved on, you moved on, thought it would be the end of the story."
needed Steve, damn it! He had more claim to him than any of those other sons-of-bitches, and he needed Steve to stay there and get him through this insanity.
Tony huffed out a breath. "That once you get past the firm, tight flesh that you just want to…sink your teeth into…the real Steve Rogers is still underneath and—"
This piqued Steve's interest, and he raised an eyebrow and sat a little straighter and said, "Something wrong?"
Because Tony was both rich as well as a genius, he decided that too much television was no good for his little Nobel Prize winner — or whatever she chose to do with her life; he wasn't going to push her down a path she didn't want to go, and even if she wanted to be an exotic dancer… OK, that would be something they'd have to talk about — and according to Bruce, she'd mentioned her enjoyment of drawing. Tony didn't have anything in the penthouse or in the workshop that would suffice, but he knew Cap had some art supplies on hand — he'd bought them for the man himself, and because he was rich, he would totally pay to replace whatever he and Olivia used — so he scooped Olivia up into his arms and said, "Come on, kiddo. We're going to go find you some paper and some crayons."
She settled back into her chair and began the process of picking up what was still an admittedly large slice for such small and fumbling hands. Still, she must have eaten pizza in the past, as she knew enough to fold it in half — though she went about it in a stupid and strange way, using her palms to press the two sides of the pizza together — in order to eat it, and she took her first bite and began to chew with her mouth open.
"Thanks," Steve said and sat back from the table, and Tony peeled away the unused scraps of dough. "I think."
Steve tried to picture what Tony was explaining to him, but he was having a hard time with it, and so Tony pushed at the surface like he was typing something out. After a moment, he turned the cellphone to Steve, and Steve saw himself in full color, that shorter haircut, and dressed in ridiculously casual clothes, especially considering that he appeared to be sitting for an interview with some woman that was asking him questions about his personal life. He watched as this identical stranger smiled at the woman — and he recognized that smile as his 'polite' smile that he gave when he really wanted to pick a fight — and explained in answer to the question of 'Is Captain America gay?'—
He hummed a little in intrigue and said, "Believe it, babe," before he slid his hands around Steve's shoulders and leaned down a little further to nuzzle at his neck.
He looked at the baby slumbering in her highchair, the pacifier having fallen out as she lay there with her head tilted and her mouth dropped open.
"Yeah, but it was 'cool' to do. I don't know, man. I don't pretend to understand what people did in the past."
He hung up the towels and wiped down the mirrors and straightened up what little he'd messed then crossed back into the bedroom and said, "We got anything good to eat here, J, or did my little wards eat it all?"
Steve exhaled a heavy breath and looked at Tony. "I don't think we have much of a choice. The public deserves to know, and you deserve to not have to hide in the shadows anymore."
Whatever. It didn't mean anything. Bruce was grasping at straws. He was an outsider in all this. Tony was the one actually
Bucky nodded his agreement, and Tony hummed again and said, "You're right. It is a very tight ass. Deliciously tight. Bounce-a-quarter-off-it tight. Want-to-sink-your-teeth-in-it—"
But it was fucking terrifying, and the only thing that made it not as terrifying as it could be was the fact that it was Steve's. He loved Steve, he'd loved him for a long time, but he'd never, ever once thought about what it would be like to carry his child. Ever. OK, sure, he'd thought about what it would be like to combine their DNA, and he'd even, in the privacy of his own mind, toyed with the idea of it in a lab setting, but even then he knew he'd need a donor egg and a surrogate in order to pull it off,
Cap shot a glance back at the portal before he looked over and met Tony's eyes. Tony braced himself for the usual dour seriousness, but instead, Cap broke out into a smile and said, "It's not so bad, is it?"
"Put those on," Tony continued as though Steve wasn't lost in his own thoughts. "They want to see pictures of this? We're going to put them in a diabetic coma. Put that ribbon back on your head. That's the icing on the cake."
Somehow, Steve knew not to encourage Tony's utterances, but it was hard not to at least crack a smile at the annoyance. Some of it was genuine, he was sure, but he was also certain that a lot of it was for show. Whether it was a general appearance Tony was accustomed to putting on for everyone or it was a special performance just for him, he couldn't say. The only thing he could say for absolute certain was that Tony was just…something else, something wonderful, something he never wanted to give up.
"Yeah? Well, you got out of there in record time is what I'm saying, scatters of dirty dishes in your wake."
He blinked and considered this. "No," he said, a little distant and a little contemplative, "I don't." He shook his head. "But, no, she was talking about people we'd never heard of like Sam—"
His eyes still on the road, he pulled one hand from a leather-wrapped steering wheel and pulled at a strap going across his chest. "Your seat belt. It's on the side between the seat and the door. Like strapping yourself into a harness except you're strapping yourself into a car. Safety first."
"How's that info on Strucker coming?" Steve asked Barton in lieu of telling him to go stuff it, for some reason.
He faked a gasp. "That's hurtful, big green. For the record, I am ridiculously delightful, and Steve worships the very ground I walk on."
"I don't know," Steve said with a slight shake of his head. He cut off another bite of steak, and he paused before he took the bite and glanced at Tony. "You know, we might not have a choice."
much easier, especially getting into small, tight spaces that require a lot of finesse. That…is actually, like, the one thing I'll miss when this whole thing is over."
He turned when the door to the workshop opened, and Steve strolled in followed by a hesitant Barnes, who scoped out the room with curious eyes almost hidden behind straw-like hair. Steve shot a nervous smile at him as he led Barnes over, and he stopped just on the other side of Tony's worktable and motioned around.
"Do you need me to kick his ass?" Rhodey asked. "Say the word, Tones, and I will kick his ass. I don't care if he is Captain America. He's not above reproach."
He finished cleaning up and shut the water off, and he stepped out of the shower, wrapping a towel around his body before he twisted his hair up in one, and he padded into the bedroom and began to search through drawers for something to wear. A glance outside showed a late-spring sunset, the dark amber of dying sunshine glinting off the glass of the buildings surrounding the tower, and he frowned and wondered if it was too early for pajamas. It was a Friday night, and a quick glance at the small digital clock on the table next to Steve's side of the bed showed a time of 7:24.
Natasha shrugged. "I'm not sure I can say. I wasn't there. I never even met her. But from what you've said and what Steve has said and what Thor's said and even what Bruce has said… I think there's a reason she chose you two. I think she saw something in you both. I don't think she was trying to torture you or hurt you. I think she honestly thought she was doing something good for you. You and Steve are soul mates. She thinks this is what all soul mates want."
Holy shit, they'd look at it that way, wouldn't they? Not that Tony Stark's 'family' had accepted this mysterious woman so clearly she couldn't be all bad but—
They couldn't get the machine until the next day, which did nothing for Tony's nerves — or Bruce's, for that matter — and when it was finally delivered, Tony ripped off the tape and protective bubble wrap it had been sent over in like a child opening presents on Christmas.
She shrugged. "Papa usu'lly fixes it," she said and shoveled some more mac and cheese into her mouth.
," while Barnes, still wearing that stupid party hat, looked at him and said, "How old are you, anyway?"
Steve smiled a little and met his gaze. "In 1944, I would have said you were being paranoid and reading too much into things. In 2014? I think you're onto something."
But there was a strange look in Steve's eye, hungry and desperate, and he met Tony's gaze and said in a dark and low voice, "Touch yourself."
"Yeah, well, sorry for taking the easy route. But see, I'm kind of tired and bloated and constipated and suffering from indigestion, like, constantly now. I have a gigantic, twenty-pound watermelon strapped to my gut that, for whatever reason, feels that the prime time to become active is when I'm trying to relax. I can't think straight. I tried to attach an eggbeater to one of my drills because I couldn't find the hand mixer the other day. I tried to sneak some coffee earlier because, yes, I have a box of those horrible Folgers single-serve packs shoved in my desk, but instead of adding cream like I meant to, I grabbed the orange juice —
Previous pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages, stillbirths, live births, and living children. OK, this was starting to get a little weird.
Steve scratched the back of his head. "That was…kind of a dead end," he said with a slight grimace. "Turns out there are some very interesting, uh…
Bucky made another 'there you go' motion at him and added, "What we're saying is you're reckless, Stevie. You're reckless with your body, and you're reckless with your emotions."
Tony sat back in his chair, folding his arms and nestling them beneath his breasts, grimacing slightly at how tender they were. "So," he said, "you guys just decided to start having these little group-meets but not invite me and Steve to them —
Once the Council had been served, 'Viz' sat in a chair in the corner and worked at whittling something from a piece of wood while the Red Witch turned to them and got down to business.
She was a girl, Tony figured, blonde hair pulled into a ponytail, wearing a pair of blue jeans with colorful flowers etched onto the pockets, and as Tony came around to get a look at her, Bruce joining him at his side, he saw her screen-printed purple t-shirt featured what looked to be cartoon versions of the Avengers (OK, the stylized 'Avengers' at the bottom of the picture kind of gave it away). The child groaned a bit, and Tony heard what sounded like a high-pitched whine emanating from her — like she was ready to burst into tears.
But he hadn't been fair to Steve about it, even if Steve hadn't handled the situation any better. Sometimes he didn't understand how he and Steve were supposed to be 'soul mates.' They bickered, argued, and talked past each other more than most. Shouldn't true soul mates agree on almost everything and never once raise their voices to one another? Being with Steve was sometimes a contest to see which one of them could shout louder than the other. It was fun, but it was loud.
In principle, this was kind of stupid only because he could afford to buy the entirety of whatever baby store chain was
"Damned right it counts for something," he muttered and reached into the cabinet for a mug. He turned toward Steve and puckered his lips for a kiss, and Steve obliged, murmuring, "Hello, again," to him in parting. Tony just hummed at him in contentment and brushed the tip of his nose against Steve's jaw then turned his full attention to the coffeemaker.
, don't put expectations on him that he can't meet. He doesn't want to disappoint you, but I think he's afraid that he can't be exactly what you want him to be."
Tony hummed a little in thought and moved his hand from Steve's abs to the hand Steve still had atop his belly. "I thought you didn't even want this one in the tower of misfit superheroes?"
The baby began to drift off, her mouth still latched to his nipple, her tiny body relaxing in his arms.
"Don't worry about it," Rhodey said in reply. "Not every day your daughter from the future shows up in your workshop."
"Uh, actually, I was just about to see about lunch," he replied. When he'd just come out of the ice, he might have put off his wants to spend time with Thor — afraid of saying no and not really having anything better to do. But he'd worked off some of his excess energy, and it was time to go see his family again, and even Captain America wasn't crazy about working in any way on Christmas Eve.
Tony fell against the worktable chair, but Bruce, to his credit, didn't falter. "OK, and how old are you, Olivia?"
"Then how do you know it's gonna be the end of the world if someone gets all these 'magic stones' together?" Bucky asked, the first words he'd spoken in some time.
picky when it comes to sexual satisfaction, so saying Steve is so good at sex he's able to please someone like me is probably the best compliment you've ever given to him."
Barnes sobered a little and shook his head. "No, absolutely not, and do not tell Steve I laughed at you."
Barnes hedged, and Tony was certain he was about to turn tail and run again until he said, "A little while?"
The little girl slouched in her hair, shoulders down, bottom lip pushed out, the makings of tears in her eyes. "I miss Daddy."
"I don't know," he replied and didn't open his eyes. "Just preparing to be violated again, I guess."
" he said, more emphatically than he should have, especially judging by Cap's surprised wince away from him. "No," he said, calmer now, "it's just… Miss Potts and I are no longer…"
Tony nodded his acquiescence. "So long as you promise to post it to every gossip blog within the hour."
"I'm sorry, and I know you probably don't want to do this, but there is this cute little old lady that claims to have met you backstage at Radio City in 1943, and it would absolutely make her day—"
"This," he said as he sat back down and held the thing out to him, "is a next-generation Starkphone. Not even on the market yet. Still a prototype."
Steve re-folded his arms so his hands were tucked into his armpits, and he exhaled a heavy breath as he stared at the screen and said, "Well, Con-Ed's gonna have to deal with that. We can't put the power back on, but we can stop the others from going out."
Barnes watched as DUM-E rolled over to his other side and sat just behind his left arm, and Tony pointed to the magnifying glass lying on the table.
Tony dozed for all of ten minutes before he realized Steve had left the room, and his eyes shot open as sorrow and dread flooded his veins. The lights were off both in the bedroom and the bathroom, and Steve was nowhere in the vicinity. Which wasn't really surprising given that he was completely disgusted by Tony. By something he'd done to Tony, but that was beside the point. Tony was a freak, and there was no easy way out of this latest predicament he'd gotten himself into.
"I know," Steve said and cradled him close. He brushed his lips against Tony's head. "I'm proud of you, Tony. I'm so proud of you. And amazed by you. I couldn't do it, and just the fact that you are — and how well you are — that's nothing short of amazing."
Tony patted his arm. "Monty Python. Americans love it. Clearly the idiots we live with are the rule and not the exception. You probably picked it up through osmosis. So," he said and pushed closer to the island, "Hydra's in the business of taking down the electrical grid now."
. She takes for granted that I'm there for her, that I care about her, that I love her. I can't… I can't lose that. I don't want to lose that."
Barton rolled his eyes like he couldn't be bothered with the information while Wilson said, "Oh, hey, I remember that commercial! They used to show it when I was a kid."
He shook his head. "No, not— It wasn't that. That was… I still can't believe I said those words. I'm not sure I do believe it. It's just… It's nothing."
happen. And I know he says that he understands that, but I'm not entirely sure that he does. So, yeah, maybe I've been a little short with him lately or something, but I don't fucking
it," Steve said, his jaw tensing the way it did when he was annoyed at something or someone. "It's not a tall tale or a myth. It's something that's actually happened to us — something we have to live with, and something we have to deal with. You can think we're lying all you want. Doesn't matter to me. We can't make you believe it. We can only state what we know to be the absolute truth. Whether you choose to believe it or not is up to you."
The elevator doors opened, and Tony stepped out into a dream. There were sprays of flowers decorating the room and candles of various sizes and shapes giving light to the darkness. Over by one of the floor-to-ceiling plate windows was a small table set for two, and beside it stood a nervous super soldier in a well-fitted navy blue suit, who was clearly trying to exude an aura of confidence and calm but had that look on his face like he wasn't quite sure he had done right.
home," he said and shot a wicked look in Steve's direction. Steve just smiled in return and relaxed into the seat.
"You know," Wilson said, "you could just use one for the first name and one for the middle name." He winced in a little bit of unease and surprise as Tony and Steve turned to glare at him. "Or not."
Once the films were done, Tony said it was time for dinner, and so they went upstairs to get showered and changed. Steve dressed in a pair of black trousers and a dark blue dress shirt while Tony went for a dark gray suit with a red tie, and Steve would be lying to himself if he didn't admit some very tawdry thoughts came to mind regarding Tony and that tie. Steve pulled a lighter gray sweater over his head and combed his hair while Tony laced up a pair of shoes, and when Tony brushed past him to grab a comb off the dresser, he realized that, well—
