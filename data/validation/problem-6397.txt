Before Steve can think of a retort, Rhodey takes the dishes from him. “I can grab these. Why don’t you call it a night, yeah?”
As far as Tony can remember, the last time he saw his favorite honeybear make anything more complicated than a simple pasta dish for dinner, they were still sharing an apartment in Boston before Rhodey’s first deployment. After an exhausting week filled with midterms, group projects, and lab reports, he had almost burned down their kitchen while trying to make a roast chicken. Luckily, DUM-E was there to save the day with his trusty fire extinguisher, Tony managed to reset the smoke alarm before the fire department could be alerted, and they ended the night by adding two more empty boxes to the growing pile they named the Leaning Tower of Pizza. Rhodey had vowed then and there to never use the oven again and DUM-E in turn made sure to always be prepared in case of any fire-related emergencies.
“Hey now, Buckaroo, you can admit you’re getting sick of being around me. I mean, I sure as hell am tired of looking at your ugly mug all day.” Tony laughs and dodges as Bucky reaches out to shove at his shoulder. “You’re right though. We’re really lucky. To have them as our best friends.”
“You should have thought of that before you agreed to the terms of the bet,” Bruce says unapologetically.
“Oh! That was my idea. Honestly, I was just telling Jim that I wanted to surprise you and he decided to tag along to show Bucky some support.”
A moment later, Tony returns with the coffee pot and three mugs. He pours each person a cup and sits down next to Rhodey, barely even sparing Steve another glance.
“Well you know. There are always these couples that like to match their outfits and stuff whenever they go out? They’re always color-coordinated, or they wear the shirts in the same style but different colors. Matching accessories, stuff like that?”
He steers clear from his workshop because he just can’t handle looking at his suits again just yet. He feels a little terrible when FRIDAY tells him that DUM-E and U are looking for him, but so he tells her to send them up and join him where he’s retreated into the library. Tony spends his days curled up on the sofa, staring blankly at the unlit fireplace, and doesn’t leave until Rhodey comes in to drag him out for lunch and dinner.
. Tony probably would have found the whole situation amusing if he hadn’t been so baffled by the sight of
But Steve decides that it’s time for it all to go. He told Tony that only grew out his hair and beard because he was on the run before (and, he quietly admitted, he was moping around too much back then to care too much about grooming). Now that he’s no longer a fugitive and finally reunited with Tony, Steve believes that it’s only right that he makes an effort to shave the beard off, cut his hair and in general stop looking like such a sad mess.
Tony stays silent for a while, trying his best to process everything he’s just heard. His instinct tells him to crack a snarky joke, but the words won’t come out. Instead, he says, “You really mean that, Captain?” His voice cracks on the last syllable. He knows he sounds weak, and needy, but Tony can’t bring himself to care.
A little while later, he hears Tony and Rhodey’s voices filtering in from the hallway and braces himself for what he’s sure to be a whole boatload of judgment.
Back before Steve and Tony got together, Rhodey had unfortunately been on the receiving end of Tony’s constant whining about Steve being annoyingly perfect and too good to ever see Tony as anything more than a teammate. At the time, Tony had worried that maybe he was subconsciously turning Rhodey against Steve with his baseless complaints, but he had also been too emotionally stunted to stop actually ranting at Rhodey. During those days, his friend would throw out comments about beating some sense into Steve, but Tony sees now that they had always been empty threats—ultimately good-natured and nothing more than a joke. If anything, those were just hints for Tony to man up and finally do something about his stupid crush. Rhodey had always been a fan of Captain America, after all.
It’s date night and Steve wants to get cleaned up before heading out to dinner. Tony, wanting to see the beard for as long as he can, hops up on the bathroom counter to keep Steve company as he shaves.
got along. In fact, they hit it off pretty quickly right after Tony officially introduced the two of them.
Tony marches over to the bathroom counter and grabs his straight razor. He turns around to Steve and flips the blade open.
A long and heavy sigh escapes from Steve’s lips as Bruce drops a heavy stack of clothes on the table. “You know, Tony’s not going to talk to me all week.”
“We’re doing okay, I guess.” He turns to Tony fully. “But every time I walk into that room and talk to the team, I get this nagging feeling that something’s missing. Someone. Is missing.”
“No, I’m gonna,” Tony insists. He crosses his arms in front of his chest. He knows he’s acting like a petulant child and Steve shouldn’t have to deal with his tantrum, but he can’t help it.
“He wanted me to teach him how to make Bucky’s ma’s meatloaf and a couple other of his favorite dishes,” Steve explains. “Apparently just giving him the recipes wasn’t good enough and he screwed it up when he tried making them himself, so he asked for a cooking lesson.”
Finally, Steve gets to remove the comfortable but forbidden Harvard hoodie, kick those sweatpants off, and put on his own clothes for the first time in seven days.
Rhodey rolls his eyes. “You only say that because you like it with lumps. They’re not supposed to have lumps, Tony.”
“I didn’t think it would get this far,” Steve says. “I just wanted to fuck with you for a bit. Mess around and have some fun. I didn’t think you’d
Steve hesitantly places a hand on Tony’s shoulder before finishing quietly, “The thing is... I’m not half as good at anything, as I am when I’m doing it next to you. And that’s the truth. So now that we’re back here, now that we’re fighting on the same side again, I know that we can figure things out and win this fight. Together. I refuse to believe in anything else.”
“Uh, yeah, sure. Just one thing.” Steve takes a deep breath before he turns around, gesturing down at his outfit. “Can you let me explain before you throw me out the door?”
Tony lets out a sigh and swings his legs off the couch to sit upright and reach for the phone. He picks it up and taps it awake, eyebrows raising at the notifications on the screen.
“Absolutely. Why don’t you send him a message now, let him know that you can help too? I’m sure he’d appreciate it.”
good. He’s wearing gray dress pants, with a matching vest over a crisp light blue shirt. In his hands he’s holding up two ties for Tony to choose. “Red or navy?”
So it’s just odd, is all, witnessing Rhodey walk back on that promise he made himself. To cook dinner with Steve, of all people.
I wasn’t ignoring you. I thought those blurry pics you sent were just the bots messing around with your phone
“We need to head back to the SI booth and stay on the show floor to answer questions for a few hours,” Tony tells them. “Then we promised the R&D team a round of drinks at Caesar’s on us. Why don’t you join us? And we can head out to dinner together afterwards?”
After the plates are clear, Steve helps bring the dishes to the sink. As he walks the short distance from the kitchen table to the counter, a butter knife slips off a plate, but Rhodey manages to catch it.
And honestly, for the most part, Tony is thrilled that his two favorite people are starting to become each other’s favorite people as well. It’s just that this is really new, and it’s taking Tony a while to adjust to them being such good buddies. He’s not bitter or jealous at all, nor is he worried about either of them falling head over heels in love with each other and leaving him in the dust. Really, he isn’t. But…
“I don’t think his cooking is going to be a regular occurrence, no.” Steve says. “But he is working through something right now, and he’s asked me to help him out.”
) while Steve adds generous helpings of chocolate chunks and macadamia nuts into the batter of cookie dough at the counter behind him.
Tony turns to find Steve standing at the door instead of Rhodey, holding a tray filled with plates of pasta and chocolate cake. It smells delicious, but Tony hasn’t had an appetite since before...
“Good morning,” Steve croaks, then clears his throat and tries again. “This all looks delicious. Thank you guys.”
They head back into the compound. For the first time in what feels like years, Tony’s chest feels lighter.
Tony picks up his own phone that’s fallen to the floor at some point during his and Steve’s makeout session. He quickly taps out a few messages, to which Rhodey answers almost immediately.
Tony frowns. “Sweetheart, if you want me to wear skin tight workout shirts with you then that’s not happening. That’s your thing, not mine.”
Ten minutes later, they’re both staring in shock at the mirror, where Tony’s clean-shaven face is reflected back at them. He looks ten years younger, and he also kind of wants to cry.
“Honey, why is Rhodey spamming you with texts when he hasn’t responded to any of my messages for at least a day?”
Steve seems to find humor in his little rant, like Tony’s missing out on some joke. With his eyes twinkling and smile radiant, Steve shuffles closer to wrap himself around his boyfriend.
“Thank you, honey,” Tony says as he takes a step back from Steve’s arms to quickly give Rhodey a hug. He flicks at the event pass hanging from a lanyard around Steve’s neck. “I didn’t realize you guys were coming, otherwise I would’ve asked for the Deluxe Conference Pass for you.”
“That’s what I’m saying! So is this something I need to worry about? I’m thinking of getting Rhodey down in the shop with me to work on building a kitchen bot if his whole cooking schtick isn’t just a phase.”
“I know what you’re thinking. I know you think this is your fault. That this...decimation of the universe is because you didn’t do enough.” Steve looks Tony dead in the eye. “It’s not. You shouldn’t bear the burden of what happened. And if you insist on doing it anyway, then let me share the load with you.
Tony makes good on his promise not to speak to Steve the whole time he has to fulfil this bet. When Steve asks a question, instead of responding directly, Tony texts his reply. Sometimes, he even tells JARVIS to relay a message back to Steve. Even when Steve is sitting right there, next to Tony, in the same room.
“I hate that you think so low of yourself.” Steve takes a deep breath, and Tony can feel the Big Inspirational Speech coming. “I know I haven’t been a good friend to you. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would have changed how I acted towards you. You deserved better.”
Steve smiles. “I think I’m gonna keep it for a while.” With that, he brushes past Tony and heads back into their bedroom and to their walk-in closet.
On days like this, they like to take their time with each other. For all that they enjoy running their hands all over each other and littering marks scattered throughout one another’s body, they also simply love kissing. So this lazy Sunday, where they don’t have anything or anyone to answer to, finds them curled towards each other on their oversized couch, spending minutes—maybe even hours, who’s counting at this point—just leisurely making out, with no intention to take it any further until perhaps much later.
“Thanks, honey. It’s kind of weird though, isn’t it?” Tony sighs. “I think I’m gonna avoid going out in public for a while. Wait a couple weeks for this baby to grow back in.”
Tony doesn’t listen and instead turns back to the mirror and starts lathering shaving cream all over his own face.
Steve quickly reads through a couple comments and smiles. “They like it. They’re saying I look great with the goatee and we look amazing together. I told you! Power couple!”
“Awesome, we’ll see you later, then.” Tony gives his boyfriend a chaste kiss goodbye while Bucky fistbumps Rhodey, then they turn to leave for their exhibition space at the Venetian Expo.
Steve gets up from his spot on the couch and Tony figures Steve has just asked himself the exact same question and is going to leave to find his actual friends. Instead, Steve asks, “Want to take a walk with me?”
“What.” Tony’s brain grinds to a halt. This was the last thing he was expecting Steve to tell him. In all honesty, he thought Rhodey was just going through some sort of post-retirement identity crisis and needed someone else with a military background to relate to. “Wait, you mean like…”
Now that his internal turmoil has settled, Tony goes through a mental checklist of things he’ll have to take care of in the near future: lunch with Rhodey tomorrow so he can make fun of him for his little crush; upgrades for Sam’s wings and Nat’s batons for their next training session; a shovel talk for Bucky once Rhodey finally asks him out, you know, just for appearances; and a shopping trip to find a present for Pepper’s birthday.
It’s not what Tony wants Steve to do; he genuinely thinks Steve looks hot as fuck with the beard, and he enjoys tugging on the longer hair. But he accepts this. He loves Steve’s clean-shaven look as well. It’s
“When you guys were cooking the other day…” That meal had turned out pretty fantastic. The meatloaf Rhodey pulled out of the over was perfectly tender. The mashed potatoes had just the right amount of lumps. And the cookies were only slightly too crunchy, but still completely delicious.
Steve looks away and Tony can see a single tear tracking its way down his cheek. Steve roughly wipes it away before going on.
Tony loves Steve’s new look. He loves the longer hair, how he can tug at the locks when they’re kissing and it always sends a shiver down Steve’s spine. Tony loves the beard, the way it feels on his skin as Steve trails his lips down Tony’s body. He just really loves the new look and he wouldn’t mind if Steve decides to keep it.
“Hmm?” Steve sits up too, snaking his arms around Tony’s waist and resting his head on his shoulder from behind. “What’s he saying?”
With that, Tony and Rhodey launch into a tune together, holding their coffee up high and practically shouting the words out:
Later that night, as they’re getting ready for bed together—because that’s a thing they do now, they’re comfortable and sappy and basically already married—Tony brings up his concerns with Steve.
He must have rambled on out loud instead of just keeping his thoughts to himself because next thing he knows, Steve has laid a placating hand on his shoulder, trying to calm him down while simultaneously stifling his own laughter.
He bursts into the bathroom just as Steve is toweling off and shoves his phone at Steve’s chest. “Look at this! Look what people are saying!”
“That’s not what I mean.” Steve takes a deep breath. “Listen, Tony. This feeling isn’t new.” He looks down, seemingly uncertain how to continue.
“I was showing him around all the spots in Brooklyn that were important to Bucky before the neighborhood was gentrified.”
Clearly taken aback, Steve asks, slightly offended, “What? Why’s he a little shit for wanting to date Bucky?”
The worst is when the press takes notice of Steve’s tie and cufflinks and start hounding him with questions on why he’s chosen to wear these accessories to the event. Is he going to be a guest lecturer at Harvard soon? Did he make a recent donation to the school? How does his MIT alumni husband feel about this? His MIT alumni husband, who poses for pictures with him while flashing his shiny class ring for the press.
He must have passed out at some point because next thing he knows, he’s waking up in a bed with soft sheets, with machines beeping around him and a slight tug on his right hand where he must be connected to an IV drip. He opens his eyes and takes a look around.
Tomorrow, Tony decides, he’s going to ask Rhodey to work on a fun new project in the lab with him. Maybe if Rhodey insists on learning to cook more, they can work on designing a new kitchen assistant, build another bot son just like they did back in the day at MIT.
It looks like Steve’s grin can’t get any wider, but somehow he manages. “Okay, here goes.” He pauses for dramatic effect, and Tony leans forward in anticipation. “Jim likes Bucky.”
Tony doesn’t look at Steve, addressing Rhodey instead as he continues to speak. “More of a cheer. Actually, a song.”
“So not only is Tony not going to talk to me, but he probably will make me sleep on the couch all week too.” Steve glares at the flannel pants. “He won’t let me into bed if I’m going to wear
But first, he needs to get back to spending the rest of the day making out with the handsome man he’s lucky enough to call the love of his life.
Aside from the slow fire sizzling behind him, the kitchen falls into a dead silence. No one moves for a solid minute, and Steve can feel the disgust at his clothes pouring out in waves from the two men in front of him.
Tony’s heart feels full to bursting knowing that Steve and Rhodey had flown across the country to cheer them on in person, and he instantly feels his media-ready smile slip into something more genuine. He nudges Bucky to hurry off the stage and together they make their way towards their friends.
“So remember last week when you were getting super jealous of all the time Jim was spending with me and worrying about me stealing your best friend from you?”
“Babe, you can pull off literally anything. But please shave that thing off. Please. I’m begging you. Don’t do this.”
At the sound of Tony’s voice, Steve abandons his post to join him in the doorway. He places his hands at Tony’s waist and leans down for a long, lingering kiss—one that Tony desperately needed after an exhausting day of explaining the value of social good to greedy capitalists. He hums into the kiss with contentment, feeling the tension in his body slowly start to melt away. Even though they’re not alone right now, he wants this moment to last forever.
“Yeah, don’t worry about it,” Rhodey adds. “Pepper had offered to get us those upgraded passes when we asked her to help get us in here, but we’re really only here for you.” He turns to Bucky. “We want to take you guys out for celebratory dinner and drinks, though, after you’re finished here for the day.”
Tony turns around and flings his arms around Steve’s neck. “Oh thank god. That was brutal. Do you know how hard it was to not talk to you all week?”
Steve closes the distance between them and pulls Tony back into his chest. “You still look amazing though.”
Tony quickly lets go of the jealousy comment, more intrigued by the fact that he can finally find out what the hell is going on with his friend.
“We are taking those clothes up to the roof and we’re gonna have a bonfire. But first.” Tony leans in and presses a long, lingering kiss on Steve’s lips before pulling back. “We’re going to go back to our room. We’re gonna get naked, and get you into the shower to wash off that Harvard stench. And you’re going to pucker up your rosy lips and kiss this beaver’s ass.”
“I’m going to tell you a secret, platypus. Almost everyone likes mashed potatoes with lumps.” He starts counting off their friends. “Steve likes the lumps. So does Bruce. Natasha claims not to but she’s a lying liar who lies. Thor loves it–”
Tony’s prepared to die out in the vast emptiness of space, surrounded by the cosmos. If he’s gonna go, at least he’ll get some beautiful scenery to go with it.
It takes a few days before he’s back on his feet. In the time since half the population turned into dust and Tony went missing, the Rogue Avengers --- what’s left of them, at least --- have returned to New York to work out plans to undo the havoc that Thanos’ snap had caused. Tony hangs back and lets them do their thing, not wanting to interfere with anything. He’s too tired. Too exhausted. He doesn’t want to think about everything he experienced in the last month. Getting stabbed. Losing the kid. Almost starving to death. He wishes he could forget.
had just told you the truth and been a better friend --- then maybe we could have had a fighting chance against Thanos. Maybe we would have won.”
“Sounds good. You guys do your thing and text us later so we know when to head over. In the meantime Steve and I are gonna go check out some of the sports tech.”
As Steve lathers the shaving cream on his face, Tony notices that his eyes keep sliding over to Tony and the corner of Steve’s mouth twitches up constantly. He knows, immediately, that Steve’s up to something and asks, “What? Why are you looking at me like that?”
“Definitely. And I’m happy they’re spending more time together and keeping each other company while we’ve been busy working on this. You know, last week, apparently they went grocery shopping together. Cute, huh?”
“Hey! I was not jealous and I didn’t say anything about you stealing Rhodey!” Tony denies indignantly. “I’m not a
Weaving through the crowds on their way back to the SI booth, Bucky says, “That was really sweet of them, surprising us like this. Not that I’d complain about having dinner with just you for another night, but I’m excited to celebrate with them. You know, the people who have always believed in us.”
It’s still strange that after decades of surviving on simple meals and takeout, Rhodey’s suddenly interested in cooking again. Tony wonders if it’s just that Rhodey is trying to find things to fill his time now that he’s officially been honorably discharged from the Air Force, or if there’s something else going on with him.
Tony gasps theatrically. “He’s withholding cookies! That has to count as cruel and unusual punishment.”
“Funny you should say that.” He nuzzles under Tony’s ear and places a tender kiss there. “You’ll find out soon enough. But that kitchen bot is a great idea anyway.”
As soon as they’re close enough, Steve pulls Tony into a warm embrace, placing gentle kisses in his hair and whispering to Tony how proud he is of him, how much he loves him. Out of the corner of his eye, Tony sees Rhodey clapping Bucky on the shoulder and giving his own congratulations.
“Portion out the dough and drop it on the sheet,” Steve instructs. “Leave a few inches between each scoop so the cookies have space to expand as they bake.”
They’re just about to leave the stage after their keynote presentation when Tony spots Steve at the back of the audience, smiling from ear to ear and applauding with the rest of the crowd. Rhodey’s standing next to him with a proud glimmer in his eyes, giving them two thumbs up—his signature seal of approval.
“Well, for starters,” Steve says, “how about matching goatees?” He gently wipes his face with a towel and turns from the mirror to Tony with a giant shit-eating grin. A giant shit-eating grin that’s now framed by a perfectly trimmed goatee.
up to something. There's no doubt about it because, well, Steve just loves being a little shit sometimes.
Tony nods and quiets down, thinking back on the last few weeks now that he finally has the context. He guesses it does make a certain amount of sense, for Rhodey to spend more time with Steve than usual to learn more about his best friend. If anything, it’s definitely a smart move. There’s no one else in a better position to dole out advice for this particular situation.
They while away the time on Sunday by lazing around the penthouse together, locking down their floor so their friends can’t come barging in unannounced like they’re wont to do. They’d both been so busy lately that it’s been rare for them to just bask in each other’s company like this, and Tony’s really enjoying it. He can’t wait for the promotional campaign for the SI prosthetics launch to simmer down a bit, so he can spend more time at home with Steve and the team instead of his office fifteen floors below. Not that he doesn’t like working with the bright minds of his R&D team on innovating for the future, but there’s nothing quite like being with family.
Steve makes a show of looking at his watch and says, “Hmm. Sorry, doesn’t look like we have time for that.” He shrugs and shoots a cheeky smile Tony’s way. “You better start getting dressed too otherwise we’ll be late for our dinner reservations.”
He’d brought Bucky with him as his R&D partner and sort of the live demonstration of what they have in store for the future of prosthetics. Truth be told, if Bucky hadn’t fought tooth and nail to escape from Hydra and come back into Steve’s life with a malfunctioning arm and damaged nerves, Tony never would have ventured into this area to begin with. As far as he’s concerned, Bucky deserves all the recognition for his own work and sacrifices, for overcoming decades of trauma and brainwashing, and helping to build a brighter future for the world.
Not to mention, he absolutely would have loved to have the opportunity to give Rhodey a bit of a hard time now that he has his own super crush on a supersoldier. It’s what he deserves, after all the grief he gave Tony back when he was still harboring what he thought were unrequited feelings for Steve.
If it’s the latter, he just hopes Rhodey knows that Tony will always be there for him. He understands that Steve isn’t as busy and is easiest to talk to out of everyone on the team, but Tony also wants to do what he can to make his friend happy.
Okay, so that sounded a little more passive aggressive than Tony meant it to be. But in his defense, the scene in front of him is the last thing he expected to see when he arrived home from his investors meeting. Who can blame him for being caught off guard at seeing Rhodey in his kitchen with oven mitts on, sliding a fully loaded casserole dish into what he’d always called the devil’s contraption (
“No! That’s not the issue! I just can’t believe he kept this a secret from me!” And to that Rhodey was always the person that Tony would reach out to whenever he needed to figure out his own feelings and relationships. It’s definitely a little upsetting to think that his best friend didn’t come to him to talk about this when the tables were turned. He knows Bucky pretty well too, after having worked so extensively with him on his arm and the SI prosthetics line. Tony could’ve helped too!
So it’s a bit awkward, having to attend the charity gala for their favourite animal shelter together, but not talking to each other at all. Well, Steve talks, and Tony hums. Nods and reacts, but never with actual words.
The next day, Steve wakes up to the sound of plates being set down on the coffee table in front of him. He opens his eyes to see that Tony and Rhodey have apparently made breakfast for all three of them, and are bringing the dishes out to eat in the living room. The two of them are wearing matching MIT shirts, which isn’t generally out of the norm, but judging by their shit eating grins, they’re doing it mostly to fuck with Steve this particular morning.
It’s just that… well, usually, Steve and Rhodey only ever hang out when Tony is also around. But lately, they seem to be spending an awful lot of time together, just the two of them, when they rarely ever did so before.
, Steve. They may be saying this now, but how long before we become that cringe-worthy couple that’s always got to be matchy-matchy, huh? How long before we stop being cute and start being a
He loves Steve. He’s lucky to have him as a partner not just on the field but also in life. He’s grateful that Steve has accepted and welcomed all aspects of who Tony is, embracing his circle of friends as his own, and keeping Rhodey company while he figures out this new stage of his life. But the petty side of Tony can’t help but feel like his boyfriend is hogging all of his BFF’s time.
They walk in silence for a while before stopping near the helipad. There, Steve shuffles his feet a bit, as if he’s contemplating what he wants to say to Tony next. Tony can feel the tension between them building up and his eyes start darting around as he tries to form an escape plan.
The first time Tony notices this budding friendship between Steve and Rhodey, he’s in Las Vegas at CES, showcasing Stark Industries’ latest innovations in prosthetic technology.
, Steve! I’m shaving my goatee! There’s only room for one person in this relationship to have a goatee, and if you insist on keeping yours then I’m getting rid of mine.” With that, Tony swipes the razor across his jaw and for the first time in over twenty years, he sees his bare chin.
“Is that why he’s been spending less time with me and more time with you?” Steve nods. “Then help him figure it out faster and give me back my Rhodey! You have your own James,” Tony grumbles.
i can’t believe you kept your crush a secret from me btw i thought you were leaving me for steve >:(
Tony glances over Steve’s shoulder at his friend, who’s now muttering to himself angrily while mashing a bowl of potatoes with unnecessary force, as if they offended him personally.
By the time Bruce is done, Steve can feel a few stray tears prickling at his eyes. He’s not going to survive this week.
“Before you say anything else, I just want you to know, I’m so sorry.” Steve looks pleadingly at Tony, then at Rhodey. “I lost a bet. When you were away in Aspen for that tech conference a couple months ago, Bruce and I got into a drinking contest. I don’t even remember how it happened, but it did, and he bet me that I wouldn’t be able to outdrink him. And of course I agreed to the bet. I thought I’d win! But I didn’t, and his term was that I needed to wear Harvard gear for every outfit, for a whole week, if I lost. So here we are.”
Rhodey pours himself a glass of water as he waves back. “It was alright. Mostly slept the whole way through. There was a bit of turbulence, which is always awful, but it's nothing I’m not used to anyway.”
“Hm. That’s too bad.” Bruce folds the clothes back up neatly and hands them to Steve. “Oh, by the way.”
“Is something going on with Rhodey?” Tony asks, leaning against his side of the double sink in their ensuite. He’s on the last step of his skincare routine, applying anti-fatigue serum onto his face and wrapping it all up with a few dabs of eye cream. “Because, I’m not kidding, he swore on DUM-E’s code that he’d never touch an oven again so you understand why his behavior today is weird to me?”
Steve is softly nibbling a path up the line of Tony’s jaw when three short bursts of buzzing sounds from one of their phones on the coffee table. They pause for a second, keen to ignore it and get back to kissing, when the phone starts up again, vibrating five more times to indicate a total of eight messages that someone’s decided to send so urgently.
“Good, you should. You guys will have fun,” Steve responds softly, already beginning to drift off to sleep. “G’night, love.”
Steve steps in and sets the tray down on the coffee table in front of them before taking a seat on the other end of the sofa.
“Well, you didn’t.” Bruce smiles serenely, and Steve can see the glint of mischief in his eyes as he continues, pointing out each item as he goes. “Anyway, I got you everything you’ll need for the week. A hoodie you can wear in public, a few t-shirts for everyday wear, sweatpants you can wear at home, flannel pants for sleep, shorts and joggers for working out. Here’s a cap if you want to keep a low profile when you go out. A water bottle, because you should stay hydrated. And of course, a tie and cufflinks for that event you and Tony need to attend on Thursday night.”
The next weekend, both Steve and Tony are miraculously free. No project deadlines to meet, no debrief reports to write, and no dumbass villains to fight. They make the most of their time together, spending almost all of Saturday away from Avengers Tower with a picnic in the park followed by a candle making class then a few impromptu rounds of bowling. For someone who regularly throws an oversized frisbee at bad guys with unbelievable accuracy, Steve is hilariously bad at tossing a ball in a straight line to knock down a bunch of pins.
Because, really, who wouldn’t want that? It was everything Tony had wished for when he and Steve first started dating a year and a half ago, after they finally got their shit together and realized that their initial misunderstandings and antagonistic behavior towards each other had simply been the result of unresolved sexual tension.
Tony shrugged, and Peter nodded, his eyes couldn’t stop wandering around the hall. Peter took a sip of the beer and tried not to screw up his face at the taste. His Dad had already halved his beer. Peter listened to his Uncle Rhodey and Tony discussed DUM-EE actions and his behaviours for today as Peter slowly worked his way through the beer.
“Yeah, pretty much but mine is a secret. Cause you know I’m 17 and your son so it’s just asking for people to come hurt us. You don’t always like it, but I help the average people where as Captain America saves the world, you know?” Peter rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, a worried look on his face.
“I know you know more than you are letting on about the kid, something isn’t right with him. My instincts are wrong like this. I can tell something went down during your meeting with Carter and those science dorks at the Upstate Compound.  I’m going to find out more.” Natasha had sat forward, uncrossed her legs and leaned her elbows on her knees to clasp her hands together.
The trio made their way through to the dining room, Howard already sitting at the head of the grand polished table, if he had any hesitation about letting the Jarvis’ sit with him, he never said anything once Maria entered the room, taking her place next to Howard. Tony sat at the other end of the table across from Howard, Peter nervously sat next to Maria and the Jarvis family sat across from them.
Steve boot kicked the apartment door open, shield at the ready in front of his upper body. Natasha’s two pistols point round the outside of the shield, her arms outstretched in front of her. Tactical plan, infiltrate through the front door, scout the rooms, assess the current position of the target and determine the assassin’s target. Steve made his way through the empty apartment, shoulder pushing his way into the main bedroom. One bed, sheets covered in a thin layer of dust, A desk with one desktop computer. Recently used, the power was still on. Steve checked the bathroom, blood in the sink. No Shooter.
“We are trying to help Peter, we would like to get you home as soon as possible, I will be up front with you, we took Tony’s sample of your blood and ran a background check on it.” Peter turned to Tony in anger, “You took my blood!? After I specifically explained why I can’t give you it!?”  Tony looked guilty, “I know it doesn’t help but it was literally just after you arrived, I just had to check it was true!” Tony looked at his feet, hands held behind his back.
Tony's not sure what Friday decides to put on, but it's loud enough to drown out his thoughts before they can drown him and that's all Tony really wants.
That doesn’t matter right now. What matters is the fact that Tony is going to hole himself away in his lab for the next twelve hours and not come out until it’s time for dinner with the rest of the team. It’s not all just about Steve, though – Tony has a ton of stuff to work on for SI, things he’s been slacking on and things that he really should get started on doing.
Peter took in the sight of his parents talking between themselves, Steve’s suit now covered in the dust from the air vents and Tony’s jumper pretty much ruined. When Steve and Tony noticed the dust, they attempted to remove it from each other. Peggy watched the two idiots try to act normal around each other after months apart. Peggy decided it was time for everyone to go home for the day.
This morning his parents had been fine! Flirted even! It was nice to see his parents on track to fall in love, however, this seemed like another spanner in the works. Steve saluted the director and turned with a mock salute to Peter. With Tony, Steve hesitated, Tony launched himself into a hug, Steve couldn’t help but notice that the motion was the same as Peter’s earlier. He gripped Tony’s back tightly, he leans down to whisper between them, “I’ll be back soon, I promise T, you won’t even miss me, I’ll find this guy ok? You know how to reach me.”
“You are beyond happy, sickly sweet in fact, no threats of divorce or unhappiness with this family!” Peter reshuffled himself on the chair, “I’m assuming your date went well then?” Tony stayed silent, staring off into the distance. Peter rolled his eyes at his dramatic father. He could see Tony’s eyes wander around the room, settling on Peter’s watch. That had reminded to check the time, to make sure he wasn’t holding Tony back from any of his classes. Tony’s face had settled into a frown, eyes locked on to the watch, Peter waved his arm to try and break Tony out of his stare.
It took the pair a couple of hours until they could get themselves alone. The campsite had to be swept for any listening devices before Clint felt even remotely safe to open the package. He sat in their make shift tent for an hour, before he was confident enough to tell Steve the news. He had to triple check his work, the news was shocking, the instructions were unclear however. Steve paced outside the tent, his boots caked in mud, the red barely visible. He had to distracted himself, he inspects himself in the portable mirror. A shave was in order. He took the blade in his hand, holding his head to one side, he carefully ran it over the side of his head, army short. Uneven and rough but it would do. He gave himself a little more time on the other side. It wasn’t much better. Scissors roughly cut at the top portion.
Steve felt the truck slowly pull away from the guard post. He released an involuntary sigh of relief that he was leaving the compound in one piece. At best they had a couple of hours before they would be reported missing, Steve felt the truck hit a slow rough patch on the ground then come to a stop. Steve whipped the tarp off his body and using his upper body strength, jumped over the edge of the truck and walked into the passenger seat. The cab of the truck was a mess, papers strewn all over the floor and old soda drinks lingering in every available cup holder. Clint pulled off toward the main round out of the forest once Steve buckled in. “Ok, what’s the plan Cap?”
caught it, whispering, “It’s just me, you’re alright.” Peter frantically whipped his head round, “Pops.” He let out with a sigh, relaxing into his father’s side. “It’s ok Peter, we’re almost home,” gesturing out the window. Peter scrambled over to look out the window to the compound ahead, With a wistful look on his face Peter whispered, “Home.”
Natasha turned on her shoulder and made her way through the cabin’s sitting room towards the kitchen, tapping out a message on her responder watch to Clint. She couldn’t wait to see Steve’s, well 91’ Steve’s reaction to himself, they weren’t opposites per-say but Steve Stark was something else, he carries himself with an air of confidence that her Steve could never have possessed, they way he leads Peter towards the cabin, the tight grip on his sons hand, shoulders back, head held high. Steve Stark even had a hint of cheekiness to him, the glint of joy and the ability to tease his son, something Steve Rogers hesitated at, he only shared those moments with Tony, but maybe Peter was the spark for him.
Tony drew in a breath. Peggy nodded, turning back to Tony, “Anthony, head to my office and, we’ll all meet you there ok?” Tony quickly nodded pulling on the grey hoodie before grabbing walking past Coulson and heading towards the stairs. Coulson turned back to Director Carter, “Mr Stark, is waiting in the atrium for his family to arrive. He declined to wait in his room.” Peggy rolled her eyes, “Of course he would, come on let's head down stairs.”
Peter gripped his nose in pain. She took a deep breath and let out the tension of her muscles. “Better, not great. You are certainly more impressive off of the ground but hand to hand is definitely not your style.” Peter let out a howl of pain, “Did you have to break my nose though?!” Natasha smiled again. “Lesson learned for today! Besides, it’ll heal in like twenty minutes.” Patting Peter on the shoulder she turned around and made her back towards the cabin, she gestured her hand as a come hither motion, “Come on, let’s get some ice for that nose.”
“Then why didn’t you just call? Just a heads up that you are ok, instead of begging aunt Peggy an update?” Tony leaned his head back on the fridge looking up at Steve who towered over him. A gently giant in Tony’s eyes. Tony’s hands played with the various magnets attached to the fridge. His favour being from the day at the Museum of Fine Arts.
“I don’t know a Stane or Robertson but I can tell you that it’s just me at the moment brother and sister wise. It’s just me, my dad’s and my bazillion aunts and uncles who are wicked, they take care of me, they’ve taught me a lot!” Peter hadn’t realized his mistake until it was too late.
Steve wrapped his arms around Peter’s shoulder and chest, pulling him into his own. Peter couldn’t look up at his pop’s, he just stared down at the suit, arms by his side, the few possessions he had collected on his travels here. A few hoodies, a pair of boots, some bus tickets, a few hundred dollars and a collection of photos from Tony’s room of his parents. Peter finally looked up to his Pops, who was squeezing him tighter in a hug. “I … you .” He leaned down to press a quick kiss into Peter’s head. “I’m sorry that it's been like this. For you. Let’s get you home fresh clothes and a bath.” Steve sighed. “I’m so proud of you,” Peter laughed at his Pops. He leant forward and picked up the collection of photos. “I’m not going to lie, it’s really threw me when I got here that you and dad were just friends. It's so weird.” Steve laughed inspecting the photos of himself and a very young Tony over Peter’s shoulder. “Yeah? Believe it or not I was my own person before I met your dad. Him and I we were really oblivious around each other for a long time.”
He pulled off his helmet, dropping it to the ground. Gently placing the shield down next to it. He took in a large breath. Clint had already started, starting with the papers already on the floor. Quickly shuffling through the sheets in his hand, Clint turned to Steve, “He definitely went through these, they are all about Stark properties around the world.” Clint let out a whistle, “Stark has private island
“Director Carter, Pierce. To what do I owe the pleasure.” Steve nodded towards Wilson, who nodded back. Peggy couldn’t even make eye contacted with him.
“Anthony, my boy come here and give me a hug,” Tony ran straight into his aunt’s arms, fully engulfing her in his hug. “You are looking well, are you keeping up with your studies?” A gently smile as she checks Tony over for any harm that he may have caused himself. “I’m fine Aunt Peggy, I’m just working on my final lab experiments and then it will just be the library to finalise the report.” Tony just stood with his arms beside himself and let his Aunt Peggy inspect him over. She used her perfectly manicured hand to tilt his head left and right, “you need to shave my boy.” Tony let out a laugh as well as Peter who quickly covered his mouth with his hand.
“Yeah I think we covered that one buddy.” Tony tucked his face into his friend’s neck, muffling his voice. The pair lay on the floor of Peggy’s office for a moment, Steve’s mind was running laps, Tony was alive, he was here, waiting for him to get back, but, but…
“I never finished my art college because it was far too expensive for me to do, I was practically homeless, our family landlord was just very kid. Only when I became a Captain, that I could actually afford to buy the flat.” Steve wiggled his toes in his boots, stretching out his arms and shoulders above his head, “Art school was well and truly forgotten when the war started, I’d only been going for a year when I had to stop. Starting back up had been nice but incredibly…”
Peggy’s computer binged. She sat up in her chair, accepting the message, “P. Stark spotted 2 miles outside of a town in North Carolina. Will follow up with detail.” Opening the file, Peggy found the very blurred photos of a person walking down a town main street. When she found out Tony had thrown Peter out the house, she wanted to scream, she knew she shouldn’t have left Peter with him but when she went to collect Peter from Agent Coulson’s hide out. Peter had managed to slip past the pair at some point and ran. They hadn’t seen him since.
Howard began to slowly walk around Steve, taking in the face of pure rage before him, “Why are you even mad! It’s true, you think you need to come in here and ‘save’ him! He’s useless Ste! Can’t even face me like a man should, like a Stark should.” Howard stopped beside Steve who was staring at an art deco print on the wall to calm his nerves before he did something he really shouldn’t.
Natasha harrumphed. “Fine.” She chucked the file report on the Winter Solider in Steve’s lap. “Read this.” She was left to her own thoughts for the rest of the journey. Peter was Stark’s kid. But he was also Steve’s. It was so fucking obvious now. The kid got flustered every time Steve was around. The file literally opened up on the screen, when she was at the office (that she broke into...) of Peter basic information that they knew.
Peter looked up to his Uncle, giving a false smile. “Yep.” Thor’s eyes glazed over, lost in the conversation of the future, “Peter, your Dad implores you to head back to the Stark estates, once you are there, I can come back and talk to young Tony. Use my negotiation skills to make sure he doesn’t hurt you again.” Peter sighed, pulling his legs up to his chest he slides his freshly sock covered toes under the coarse blankets and turned over on his shoulder, “He blames me Uncle Thor, I didn’t tell him about his parents’ deaths, it’s my fault!” The tears slowly fell from his eyes. Thor knelt beside his nephew’s bed for the night, he raised his hand, wishing he could smooth down Peter’s hair and care for his godson’s dire situation. “Oh nephew, I wish I could take you home tonight, you have suffered more than my enemies have during battle.” Peter gave a wet chuckle at his Uncle’s analogy. “Miss you too T-hammer.”
“Ok. I won’t tell him but… uh, my Steve, I mean! Steve from just now is on his way to the cabin just now. They’re on the run just now. So how am I explaining this?” Natasha coughed to cover up her mistake, she can’t ever be seen to be going soft. Imagine she actually believed what this Steve was implying, that she… of all people… had a family.
Or anything just, didn’t realise you guys were like that.” Steve pushed past Clint and threw his shield at two approaching guards, knocking them off the catwalk. “We weren’t… not like that, I want to.. I wish i’d… but its too late. We..” Steve retrieved his shield, “ I ignored his last call, just I wouldn’t have said anything to him but … I miss him.” Clint rested his out stretched hand on Steve’s shoulder and gently squeezed.
Peter watched with a soft smile on his face. Only startling when the car door next to him opened. He stepped out and thanked Robert for his service, Peter walked round the back of the car shuffling slowly up to Jarvis and Tony. Peter tried not to let the nerves get to him, he was meeting
The group collectively watch as the Asgardian took off. That must have been the moment that Thor decided to ask about those Asgardian Widows and their time travel phone thing. “Well, we need you back and a contractor to fix the hole now. But most important thing first.” Natasha said with a sly wink to the camera, Peter let out an involuntary laugh, a wide grin on his face.
He’s got to admit that he obviously misses home, but the lack of press was nice, they didn’t even hang around Tony that much during this time, they really just focused on Howard, who was too busy running the ever-growing Shield to be found at his own company meetings. Maybe it was Shield’s doing, Peter thought to himself, all the peace and quiet, hiding away, he’d spotted Agent Coulson once, he was dressed as a police officer, standing by his coffee shop. Only once, he gave him a nodded and never saw him after that. Peter knew Tony’s schedule, he was in his advanced mechanics workshops. Maybe he should stop by with lunch. Peter stood in line at his work, choosing two rolls, an extra shot coffee, one hot chocolate for himself and a shared salad. Margaret refused to let him pay for the lunches. Patting him on the head and shooing him out the door.
Steve remains frozen for a few moments, but Tony can feel the way he relaxes, and his hand in his hair starts moving again, the hand on his back rubbing slow cirlces through Tony's shirt. "Okay," he agrees, his voice quiet.
But Tony guesses that's what he signed up for when he got attached to Rhodey. Curse him and his need for affection and relationships with people.
Tony gets running for necessity. He runs for his life all the time, or what seems like it. If a bad guy is chasing you down, or if something explodes in your vicinity, you’re going to run – it’s human nature. And Tony
Tony makes a happy humming sound in the back of his throat, and he’s seriously considering staying here, like this, and never leaving. His legs are wrapped around Steve’s back and his arms hang over Steve’s broad shoulders and Tony could work like this, just direct Jarvis to do things for him, or he could look over Steve’s shoulder and work like that. This position is the greatest position Tony has ever been in, and it’s not even mildly sexual. Well. It could be, Tony guesses, if one tried hard enough.
He goes out. He goes out and he makes appearances at public events, and he donates to charities, and awards multiple internships at Stark Industries, and gives out scholarships to exemplary high school seniors. He does everything he did before, except. It's different now. It
The bathroom door opens and closes again and Tony forces his eyes to open. Its opening and closing the first time is exactly why Tony is awake at whatever God-awful time Steve goes on his runs (which is at 5 in the morning
And that, that want right there, is the reason why Tony climbs out of bed, walks over to his dresser, and picks up the card that's sitting on top of it.
the sun. That makes Tony the moon, though, but Tony finds that he doesn't really have a problem with that.
(Just the thought of it has a ball of negative emotion rising in Tony's chest, and maybe he pushes into Steve's hand just a little bit harder.)
"Thoughts aren't loud," Tony grumbles, putting his head against Steve's chest so he can feel the laugh that rumbles there. "You can't hear them."
. Tony thinks he can hear a content sound leave his mouth, which is answered by Steve's nails lightly scratching against Tony's scalp and a small huff of laughter, but Tony really can't be bothered with that right now.
for anyone, and it hurts because one of his worst fears is finally being confirmed true. And two, it only backs up his claim that he is undeserving of love and everything that comes with it, and that will never change.
Most of the time, Tony loves the fact that Steve knows so much about him, but sometimes it gets on his nerves.
Running is a practice sent to Earth by the devil him-fucking-self, and Tony loathes it with every last cell in his body.
When Tony tells Happy, he, the good man that he is, doesn't do anything besides grunt. That might be because he wanted to be in charge of the move from the Tower to the Compound, a move that, for some reason, Tony's not all that sure about going through with. It's whatever – Tony knows that, deep down, Happy is (hopefully) proud, too.
And Tony knows that, he swears he does, but he gets a little unreasonable and irrational and overly emotional when he’s awake at ungodly hours in the morning, so it’s not his fault that all he does is squeeze harder, shaking his head again, and say, “No,” the pout on his lips audible in his voice. If it’s anyone’s fault, it’s Steve’s, because Steve is just so -
FRIDAY turns the heaters on, and the warmth provides a small amount of relief. He knows the heater will fail eventually, he can already feel his face going numb, and he needs to get some sort of signal out. Rhodey is incapacitated, so is the young Peter Parker, he doesn't trust Natasha, not anymore – if he ever did – Thor and Bruce aren't here, the rest of the team is God knows where, and it'll take anyone else far too long to reach Tony before he succumbs to either his physical injuries, injuries given to him by Steve, or hypothermia.
. He's clingy, and he gets attached too easily, and he works too much, and for too long, and he can't properly take care of himself because he forgets to eat or sleep, and he's an emotionally constipated piece of shit that doesn't deserve love and affection and his recent relationship failure with Steve just proves that.
also, there's gonna be a third and fourth chapter because reasons, i'm sorry. this was only supposed to be two chapters at the most, but it got longer than i wanted and i didn't want the chapter lengths to be disproportionate like that, so. four chapters, yay :)
Tony, admittedly, is tempted. Just a bit, but tempted nonetheless. But, no. He wants to stay with Steve
"In her words," Friday starts, the amusement clear in her voice, "if she catches you out of bed before six o'clock she will get Rhodey to throw you out the nearest window."
Therapy would probably help with that, but Tony's pride is too big. And he's also kind of scared. What if all therapy does for him is reaffirm the fact that he's a messed up human being and there's no way to fix that?
Tony loves Friday. She's not Jarvis, no one could ever be Jarvis – the human one or the AI – but she doesn't have to be. He doesn't
His mother used to sing him to sleep sometimes, on the nights when she wasn't high and when Howard wasn't drunk and angry. Those nights are probably the best parts of Tony's childhood where his parents are concerned. He misses it, in a way, misses his mother's voice and the feel of her hand against his cheek.
The words come off Tony's tongue as an insult, but Steve, God bless him, hears them for what they really are and just hums again. "If anything," he tells Tony, voice casual but words packed with meaning, "I'm the one that doesn't deserve you."
Regardless of Tony’s sleeping habits, he goes back to sleep and wakes up to Steve sliding into bed next to him.
To be honest, Tony doesn’t have that much of a problem with running at all. Sure, it goes against practically everything he stands for, and, sure, he’d never do it himself, but, when it comes to Steve, at least, he doesn’t mind. Steve puts such care into maintaining his body, that much is obvious to Tony, it was at the beginning of their relationship, and Steve needs the rush of endorphins that running provides him with. Tony guesses that Steve also finds running relaxing; Tony doesn’t get that last reason, because in what world anyone would find
"Are you okay, Boss?" Friday asks as Tony rubs his hands through his hair and then over his eyes. "Would you like me to call someone?"
Her voice sounds sad and vulnerable, and Tony wishes he could lie to her. But, out of all the people he's lied to, he can't lie to FRIDAY. She's probably the only other person besides Steve that knows him best, that loves him, and he can't lie to her.
– and hurt Tony in the process – after he promised he wouldn't, and Tony will never admit how much that keeps him awake most nights.
He misses Jarvis, he does, and he hasn't quite accepted that he's gone – if the way he calls out a question and is surprised when he hears a female voice instead of the male one he was expecting tells him anything – but he loves Friday and he's glad she's here with him.
Hill hesitates. She narrows her eyes suspciously at Steve and then at them all, her gaze sweeping around the conference table while she rubs a finger over her lips.
As she speaks, she pulls a box of tissues from a desk drawer and holds them out to Steve. “Take the box, Captain. They’re company property. You need them more than I do, right now.”
“It’s possible,” Tony says. “I don’t know if Osborne can do it yet, but it’s definitely possible. He, uh... he stole the tech from me.”
“So,” she says at last, turning back to her nails and the quiet flickering light of the television screen. “What did you find?”
Tony shakes his head, then rolls his eyes. “What, I’m not allowed to enquire after the health of people now?”
to happen, or possibly to explode, so he’s not surprised when the rectangle lights up at the press of his hand: beneath his thumb, a picture of his shield rendered in those familiar bright, blue lines of light; in the main body of the rectangle, three rows of tiny pictograms set out like the dial of a modern phone. Steve examines them carefully, then looks up at Tony.
Together, they move the other Tony onto the bed, where he lies quiet and still. Tony has a headache; Tony, who has been drinking since one pm, has the beginnings of a hangover and his fingers feel numb. The other Tony looks dead.
“No, I – you’re the most futuristic person I’ve ever seen, but back home I thought the twenty-first century would have robots like people. Flying cars, monorails, space colonies. Everyone living in glass domes and wearing space suits.”
Rhodey heaves the last bolt of fabric onto the desk and, lifting his faceplate says, “This had better be good. I’m a pilot, not a courier.”
“Tangy,” he declares, before his expression turns serious. He looks down at the gun and then up at Steve, his gaze dark. “This is new. I don’t know what it is... I mean, I don’t know what it’s made of, and I – you know I discovered my own element once, right? Well, rediscovered. Resynthesised. It was kinda a big deal, anyway. I should know what this is and I – don’t.”
,” Tony snaps, yanking his arm away. “I’m not a superhero. I’m not some covert vigilante. I tried it once and I sucked at it. It was a total fucking disaster. When I was a superhero, people died. You understand? Because of me, people died.”
Tony scoffs. “So that’s it? Fury’s grand scheme? I don’t know about you and nineteen-forty winks here, but I don’t plan on sitting by the phone twiddling my thumbs until Fury’s ready to invite me to the planetary crisis prom.”
Despite the noise growing next door, everyone is quiet. Only Thor, in his shiniest armour with a ceremonial helmet tucked under his arm, looks excited; it’ll be another Midgardian experience to write home to his parents about, Tony figures. Bruce is fidgeting nervously in the corner while Romanoff, wearing something that looks like it came from Natalie Rushman’s wardrobe, murmurs reassurances. Even Barton looks on edge. Only Steve is an oasis of calm, carefully combing his hair, with his jaw set as if he’s preparing for battle. He’s wearing a shirt that looks brand new, white and crisp and too cheap for Tony’s tastes; it stretches too tightly across his shoulders, pulling taut with every movement of his arms. Tony reminds himself to give him the number for Tony’s tailor and he lifts his cell to take a picture for Rhodey.
Tony waves a hand. “It’s fine, I have a man on the military inside. And the NYPD have a collective crush on you, Cap; you can sweet talk ‘em. The rest, I’ll consult with legal. And we’ll need a publicist. Maybe we could register as a non-profit...”
He snaps his fingers and points at Steve, until Steve sits up straighter in his seat and clears his throat and says, slowly, “I guess the colours are a little... vivid.”
“Tony...” Rhodey begins, so Tony hangs up. He glances sideways at Steve, sliding his cell back into his pocket.
“What I am,” Tony says, answering the questions before Steve can voice them, “is  a complex blend of organic and genetically coded synthetic fibres plus technological enhancements. I’ve upgraded.”
“It’s some kind of bizarre-o survival reflex,” Tony says as he twists the last coil of wire together. He thinks of Yinsen’s steady hands. “Fight or flight, et cetera. I figure my body chose flight without consulting the rest of me.”
Tony, the real Tony, standing at a podium before a crowd. It’s a funeral, Steve somehow knows. Tony’s lips are moving and Steve is straining to listen, but someone behind him keeps firing a gun. Sound roaring in his ears. The gun fires again and this time Steve feels it. Hands against his stomach, blood slick. He can see Sharon in the distance, disappearing into the crowd.
“Fine.” Steve turns, heading back to his cot. “But Tony, I swear to God, if you don’t let me out of this cave soon, I will snap and kill you next time you rope me into your home surgery.”
Huffing out a breath of laughter, Tony rubs the back of his neck, his fingers still twisted in the cord.
“Your team,” she says firmly, unpicking the knot. She smoothes the two loose ends of his tie down over his chest and then, her eyes fixed on the silk, she crosses the ends over and begins to tie the knot again. She steps back to admire her handiwork and, taking a deep breath, she smiles at him.
Tony smiles up at him, swift and jokey, all teeth. It drops off his face as he spreads his fingers across the edge of the bar and stares, intently, down at his knuckles. The degree to which Steve feels out of his depth is almost comforting; nobody, from what Fury told him, can hold a straight conversation with Tony Stark. In this moment, at least, Steve is no different from anyone else in the twenty-first century.
He drifts off again. Natasha looks at him with such incredible, open fondness Steve has to look away. It feels too intimate to watch.
Tony goes still at last, and his expression shutters down, his chin lifts up. “Like you wouldn’t have jumped right into that mineshaft solo if HYDRA and the Nazis had been playing Twister at the bottom.”
Fury rolls his eye, standing up straight and folding his arms. He clears his throat in a way that says
Outside, the street is quieter than a street in New York City has any right to be. It’s three am in an alien universe where the streets are quiet and the people are scared, and Steve can deal with that. He jogs down Fifth Avenue towards the nearest park entrance, holding the image on the monitors in his mind. He knows the shape of those trees; if he focuses and mentally breaks the park down into a grid, he should be able to place them before he even reaches the path.
“Implanted, ingested... It’s a brave new world, right?” Tony shrugs. “Post alien invasion. Hey, maybe HYDRA’s been funding nanotechnology when it hasn’t been busy cramming portals into ugly toy guns.”
Whatever Tony was waiting for, that wasn’t it. But he shrugs and smiles almost pleasantly, for him, and says, “Sure. You know me, businesses to run, marvels to create, breakthroughs to... break through. Stop by whenever, mi casa es su casa. Mi - what’s the Spanish for the tower? Mi tower, mi... uh, JARVIS?”
“Mr Stark’s favoured approach is to leave them on the floor to be picked up by someone else. However, if you are feeling adventurous, Captain, there is a little-used laundry chute at the end of this corridor.”
“Angry,” Bruce says. He wipes his hands vaguely on his bare legs. “And sticky. Mainly sticky, I guess.”
Flexing his freshly resurrected fingers, Tony smooths the loose flap of skin back into place with his other hand. It all seems to knit back together, edges disappearing into one smooth, solid plane of skin. Steve can just make out the hole where the screw goes, before Tony screws it back in and that, too, disappears.
Steve frowns across at Tony – Tony, who is leaning back with his elbows on the handrail, his ankles crossed, his shades on the end of his nose, holding his ice cream cone up high to lick melted ice cream from the juncture between finger and thumb. He’s so casual you could almost forget he’s wearing a red and gold robot suit.
He has to lift the other Tony up when they reach the stairs, a sweeping expanse of mahogany that had never been practical in a house with a child in it. The other wraps his arms around Tony’s neck automatically, clinging on tightly and sniffing and mumbling, at last, “That one creaks,” right before Tony almost puts his foot down on the wrong step.
second chance, right? Everything else was just... just practice runs, 1.5 chances. Nothing seems – What do I do? How do you move on from your own freaking self-sacrificial death?”
He makes a couple more notes. Then, with a dragging motion, he lifts his glowing pen up away from the computer panel and-
Steve takes the proffered metal, hefts in his hands. “It’s close.” So close that he can feel his body responding to it, his blood pressure rising and his muscles unwinding in preparation for battle.
“I’m the genius whose tower you’re living in,” Tony says. “And I’ve got a supercomputer that’s trained to kill, so watch yourself.”
Smiling wryly, Tony drums his fingers on the handrail. He flexes his fingers, curling and uncurling each joint individually. The suit whirrs with every small movement, barely audible unless you know what to listen for.
He trails off, dragging his hands down his face. Nobody else says anything after that. Tony tips his head back and stares up at the ceiling until his eyes start to water, and then he closes his eyes. He wonders if Pepper is still in that meeting. He wonders if this is the mother of all midlife crises or just a psychotic break. Press conference, he thinks. Press conference, publicist, call Rhodey, call legal, and then – what? If Bruce’s tests don’t work, if HYDRA stays in hiding, if aliens don’t invade the planet again, then
Clint jogs over to the communicator and picks it up, turning it over and over in his hands and then lifting it up to the light and studying it some more.
Steve picks his shield up off the foot of the bed. It warms something inside of him, to hold it again, to tilt it into the light to check for scratches and find it pristine. Steve rubs the face of the shield gently with his sleeve, then he flips it over to check the strength of the straps. He lowers it down onto the floor next to his bag.
Tony rolls his eyes, but then, rolling his shoulders back and lowering his arms to his sides, he closes his eyes. He lets out a breath. Flexing his fingers, he thinks of the beach at Breezy Point. The sand in his shoes, the sun in his eyes. He wonders if it will feel new or familiar, or if it will work, or if it will hurt –
Tony raises an eyebrow at him. “Obviously. No more stupid questions, pay attention – this bit’s important. New feature.”
Steve is the one to pull away, taking a quick step back and looking around. He lowers his hand in one moment, then lifts it back up again in the next, to comb his fingers shakily through his hair. Tony is staring at him, frozen where Steve left him, with his mouth open and his shirt so rumpled.
Down in the lobby, he finds Pepper standing by the reception desk, deep in the middle of two conversations at once, one on her cell and one with Sofia. She looks harried and tired and her hair is slipping out of what was once an impeccably neat bun. Easing his way through the lingering crowd of SHIELD agents and hotel security, curious guests and staff attempting to clear the lobby, Tony calls her name. Her head whips around in his direction and she passes her cell to Sofia, who picks up the thread of the phone conversation without missing a beat. She grabs his arm and draws him aside to the edge of the room.
Steve jumps, slotting the mic guiltly back into place in the console. Tony’s hand flexes against the panel, fingers brushing over buttons as if he’s petting it.
“Fastforward 15%,” Tony mutters, leaning back to watch the workshop zip by while Butterfingers move into position at the far end. The camera swings around to face Steve and the other Tony, the two of them moving back and forth in the middle of the workshop, mouths moving too fast to understand.
JARVIS would sigh, Tony knows, if he could. But he obliges, and Tony leans back in his chair and watches. His eyes are aching, his head is throbbing, and there is something on the other side of that blue-white light. Of course there is, it’s a portal, they already knew that. But –
Drumming his fingers on the arm of his chair, he hears Steve groan and mutter and shift around so his sheets rustle.
,” the voice is saying, and the other  light screen flickers into life, filled with the view of a table and some half-shut blinds. It tilts, shifts, revealing a young woman squinting down at them suspiciously.
Tony glances up at him but Steve is staring down at Tony’s wrists. Tony takes a deep breath. Nineteen twenty-four. He presses the button on the side of his watch. He closes his eyes.
“On Friday, yeah, yeah. They only nag me because they’re embarrassed, you know. The board. When we stopped making weapons they were all weeping in the showers, defecting to Hammer, preparing for ritual suicide. Obviously we’re more successful than ever now. I think I’ve given them all complexes.”
Tony taps the shield and says, “Ta-da,” his voice coming from the phone in Steve’s hand almost faster than it comes from Tony’s mouth.
He doesn’t look back to check the next set of doors will open in time for him – and they do, of course, open in time for him. Tony walks backwards into darkness, his eyes on Steve all the while.
“We should go to Iceland sometime,” Tony says suddenly, as he presses his thumb against the identification pad. The door slides open and he strides into the antechamber, spinning around on his heel and walking backwards so he can keep talking to – looking at – Steve without missing a beat.
Down on the street corner, Steve stops to chafe his hands together. The chill doesn’t really bother him, but he’s still aware of it and he’s used to feeling the cold, especially with arms bare and a thin t-shirt. Rubbing his hands together, he turns around and looks up at the tower at the other end of the street. As the sun is going down and stars are slowly, faintly coming out, the tower’s becoming a curve of light, that big A at the top like the star on a Christmas tree. Steve’s still not a fan of the tower in daylight, but he can’t deny it’s beautiful at night.
Bruce shakes his head again in disbelief, with a rueful smile. He scribbles a few notes onto his clipboard and slides his glasses back off nose, slipping them back into his shirt pocket to nestle among pens and pocket protector.
“Ms Potts is currently in a meeting, reviewing the budget with heads of department,” JARVIS says. “I’m sure you would be welcome to join her until your meeting with Colonel Fury.”
“He’s out on the balcony,” Barton says, still sniggering. He jabs a thumb back over his shoulder toward the balcony door, and crosses his ankles on the coffee table with a contented sigh.
engineer, but he’s got a whole fleet of great engineers. One or two of them might even be better than me. And they all clubbed together – or were held at gunpoint together, I don’t know – and built a really clever computer.”
His hand creeps back up Tony’s chest and down his arm, tracing where the veins are – where the wires used to be – until he reaches Tony’s wrists. His fingers, where they touch Tony’s skin, are warmer than the cufflinks could ever be.
Tony, lips curling up at the corners, lowers his head again. “You know I’ve essentially got a teeny, tiny nuclear reactor in my chest, right? Just saying. Pretty dangerous. Anyway, I damage this tower on such a regular basis I put the builders on speed dial.”
Tony smirks across at him. Then, lowering his gaze, he quickly finishes buttoning his shirt and he smoothes a palm down the shirtfront. Steve can see the corners of his mouth still curling up.
“That’s weird, right? HYDRA weren’t known for being the shy and retiring, flee at a hint of trouble types, right?”
Daddy looks around. When he sees Tony, his face goes pale and his eyes go wide and he swears louder than Tony has ever heard him swear before. He lets go of the boy’s arms and reaches out for Tony.
“No no no no no,” Tony is hissing. “Don’t watch, don’t, stop--” and then he grabs Steve by the arm and twists him away. Steve stumbles, startled. He has to catch himself on Tony’s shoulders; Tony’s shoulders that are trembling, and there is Tony’s pale, panicked face staring up at him.
He ends up sitting at Tony’s work station, squinting in the harsh light of a surgical lamp. Tony is somewhere behind it, but the light is too bright to make him out – he’s just a darker shape moving in the darkness, pacing back and forth as his voice drifts out of the air.
Tony has his faceplate up and he slides his newly acquired shades down his nose to peer at Steve. He traded them from a fan by the ice cream stand, in exchange for a picture of the fan kicking Iron Man between the legs.
Tony snaps his fingers and points at Steve. “Yeah, yeah, a romantic getaway. Nothing says I love you quite like a glorious quest for science, right, Cap?”
“Got it in one.” Tony knocks his bare feet into Steve’s. He leaves them there, resting against Steve’s ankles. “I keep building these dumb little robots and, yeah, the clean energy breakthroughs we’re making are terrific and there’s a deal coming up with Wakanda that’s going to be great, but I’m bored. It’s boring. None of it feels like what I’m meant to be doing with my afterlife.”
Obie smiles down at him. He puts the arc reactor, and its extractor, back into his case and snaps it shut.
Tony leans around Steve’s shoulders and presses his thumb to the panel. When he lifts his hand away, Steve catches sight of a bright blue thumbprint which quickly fades away and morphs into a number pad. Tony types in a code, the lock releases with a click and a hiss and he lifts the lid. Inside the box is six rectangular pieces of what looks to Steve like shiny black plastic, packed in two rows of black foam. Tony pulls out the first two and hands one to Steve; it’s heavier than it looks, which doesn’t say a lot, and about twice as thick as his credit card.
Steve sits. As Tony bustles about around him, he spreads his hands over the countertop and can’t help but wonder what anyone does with a kitchen so big.
I’m just saying, maybe he was always a hardass and you just never saw it, because you’re – you. Being perfect is part of your whole shtick, isn’t it?” Tony shrugs again. He’s still making a show of staring at his work, but his back is very straight, and he’s holding himself very still.
Tony pats Ms Potts on the head, and then pats Steve on the head, ruffling his hair, and then – Steve cranes his neck to watch – reaches out a hand half-heartedly towards Natasha. She smiles widely up at him.
He hums Memphis Minnie during the ride up in the elevator and something catchy he heard on the wireless as the doors slide open and he steps out into the familiar sight of the living room. The place seems empty at first glance, but when Steve walks further inside he spots Ms Potts sitting in the corner, at a desk covered in paperwork. She looks tired, and as she lifts her head to look at him without enthusiasm, Steve feels the spring fall out of his step.
Tony listens to the sound of Steve’s footsteps coming closer. The workshop is cool and dark and he listens, too, for the sound of the rain before he remembers that was the time he left behind. He lifts his head.
Steve sighs, climbing to his fest. He pulls the straw and umbrella out and downs the remainder of his drink in three gulps that he barely tastes, and then holds the glass out until Tony, startled, takes it.
“I’ll get right on that,” Tony says, leaning forwards into his microphone. Their audience laughs and Tony twists in his seat just enough that he can catch Steve’s eye; but Steve isn’t looking at him. Instead, he’s frowning past Tony at Thor, who is sitting up very straight in his seat.
“It’s all buildings and trees in there.” Tony waves his hand at Steve’s sketchpad without looking up from his paper.  Lowering his hand, he begins to write and he adds, slowly, “Except for Widow.”
He twists his head to glare up at Tony, until Tony laughs softly. He lets go of Steve’s chin and pats the side of Steve’s neck, before pulling his hand away. Sighing, Steve closes his eye again.
“Okay,” Steve says, turning away. He claps his hands together. “Where are the cops? Didn’t anyone call the cops?”
With a flick of his wrist, Tony tosses the paper frisbee across the room. It glides high and steady for a few brief seconds, until it bumps into a light fitting and the segments come apart, raining down to the floor.
“No,” Tony says, from behind the camera. “He wants to extract it from you. He’s – we think he’s the one orchestrating the latest rise in meta-hate. Relations were never great after what happened with the Avengers, but now? Nobody’s going to kick up a fuss if someone comes and takes a super-powered kid away, because they figure that kid was probably born evil anyway. And the kids – they’re not strong enough to fight back.”
As he starts to walk, he glances back over his shoulder. Clint catches his eye and nods, and past Clint – the man with the highly conspicuous bow and arrow – there’s the giant green man carrying a car, and past that the crowd of people who want to find out how the day’s excitement ends. They’re still holding up traffic, because now drivers keep slowing down to stare and stare at the procession passing by. People, pointing at him.
“I don’t know,” Steve says. He leans against the wall next to Tony. “Apparently you’ve got magic in your heart.”
Steve has to think about it. He closes his eyes and when he opens them again, Tony is still looking across at him, fingers curled motionless in his shirt, still only half buttoned. It leaves framed a glimpse of his stomach, rising and falling with every slow breath Steve watches him take.
Down on the floor, Bruce coughs violently and buries his face in his hands and Barton lets out a great cackle of laughter, throwing his head back and slapping his knee. Romanoff blinks at them both as if she has no idea what the problem is. Patting Bruce on the back, Steve covers his mouth with his other hand. He closes his eyes. Tony can’t tell if he’s laughing or disapproving, only that the tips of his ears are pink.
“Smartass,” Tony says. He pauses, reaching around the other Tony to tidy up the wiring. “Does Pepper... know?”
“There’s a traffic jam the size of Texas down there and – oh, would you look at that? I spy with my little eye something beginning with ‘H’.”
Steve squeezes his eyes shut. When he opens them again he can still see the after-images of the bright light floating in his vision, overlaid on Tony’s panicked face as he stumbles into the clearing. Tony turns around, squinting at the fallen soldier and then Billy and Teddy before his gaze lands on Steve at last.
She touches his knee. Tony looks up from the bottom of his whiskey glass and covers her hand with his own. “I’m
He holds out his hand, opening and closing his fingers impatiently while Clint jogs back with the communicator. Clint throws it at him, but Tony catches it. He runs his fingers over the crack.
“Sure you do. Look at that pretty little face. It’s an enigma rolled in a boy band.” Downing the remainder of his whiskey, Tony turns to face him fully. “Drink?”
The communicator fills up with a view of their feet from ground level as the robot rolls almost silently across the floor. Tony drags his finger back and forth across the screen and the view moves with his motions, spinning the full 360 degrees as promised, and when he taps a spot on the screen the robot turns and heads in that direction.
He stares expectantly until Steve swings his feet over the side of the bed, standing up and picking his discarded bag up from the floor in one smooth motion. He carries it over to the desk as he speaks over his shoulder, hearing Tony bound after him.
Chest heaving, Steve grabs hold of his injured hand and hisses. The pain is sharp and bright, but it won’t stay. He’ll wake up in the morning and it’ll be gone again.
“Atta boy,” Tony says. “The code’s practically the same. Navigation, basic decision making, programming it to seek out whole humans instead of distinguishing between body parts was practically a downgrade. 360 degree cameras, smoke bombs in the rim – teaching it to recognise threats was a fun weekend, let me tell you, you really missed out on that one.”
“Hey babe,” Tony greets as he walks through the door. “Smells amazing in here. Hope you don’t mind that I invited Rhodeybear over for dinner? He’s had a long flight, so I figure you wouldn’t mind if we kept him company.”
“Of course that’s okay,” Steve replies. He looks over his shoulder and gives the colonel a quick wave. “Hey Jim. Hope the flight wasn’t too rough.”
Steve dodges all the questions and changes the subject every time it comes up. It’s exhausting, but he gets through the night, then the rest of the week.
Soft music from the indie pop playlist that Steve recently put together sounds in the background and Tony basks in the simplicity of their unhurried kisses. He revels in being completely surrounded by Steve, who occasionally pulls away to whisper endearments in his ear and peck his nose, his forehead, his cheek. He can’t get enough of the way sometimes their kisses can barely even be called kisses, because they’re both smiling too much for their lips to meet properly.
“I was just so sure I’d win,” Steve lets out an undignified whine. “I can’t get drunk! Of course I thought I’d win a drinking challenge!”
“Careful, Cap. Wouldn’t want to accidentally stab yourself with this.” Rhodey pauses, then smirks. “Though the blood would blend beautifully into that crimson shirt you have on.”
Several mornings now, Tony had gone into the kitchen to see the two of them making breakfast smoothies after apparently going on a run together. One time, just as he was about to leave the office, he’d texted Steve to see if he was free for dinner only to find out that he and Rhodey had gone out for happy hour somewhere. And just a few days ago, Rhodey had canceled lunch with Tony and Pepper at the last minute because he had been caught up running some errands with Steve in Brooklyn and had lost track of time.
Tony whips his head back around to stare at Steve. He’s bewildered. Never in his wildest dreams did he think he would hear those words come out of Steve Rogers’ mouth.
They work in companionable silence after that, and while Tony helps Steve mix up a new batch of cookie dough, he notices the stiff lines of Rhodey’s shoulders start to loosen as he gets into the rhythm of the work. He occasionally sneaks glances at the oven, likely nervous to see how the food he placed inside earlier will turn out. But with Steve around to guide things along, Tony’s sure that Rhodey will be pleasantly surprised at how great this dinner will taste.
"It's nice to know you have such faith in my abilities to cope," Tony says, voice sarcastic as he searches for any amount of humor he can find in this situation.
Tony blinks, swallows, and then blinks again. Okay. He can do this. It's all fine. He doesn't have to say too much, just enough so she knows he's
He lets out a huff and closes his eyes, almost complying with the unspoken order from Natasha to stay on the couch that was clear as day in her voice. But then he realizes that Steve is not the boss of him and that Steve can’t stop him from doing anything.
When he opened his eyes again, Howard was eyeing him up. A permanent frown on his face. Ana and Jarvis helped clear the table for dessert, Peter was about to get up when Tony stomped his foot on top of Peter’s, under the table, Peter turned to look at Tony, who very subtly shaking his head. Peter relaxed back in chair, trying to give Ana an apologetic look. She just smiled back lifting the heavy ceramic plates off to the kitchen.
Tony curled round and turned in Steve’s arm. “Steve, don’t talk like that, you’re the world’s hero, my dad was right in some respects, I got angry when you left but I was really acting…like a kid and I’m sorry for throwing the….” Tony trailed off, Steve chucked, “It was the hair dryer.” Tony nodded and winced a bit at remembering his reaction to the news that Steve was shipping off. “Yeah, I’m sorry for throwing the hairdryer at you, but that’s what I mean, you should be out there with Barton, not ‘babysitting’ me.”
Steve lost his thought as he turned back to Bucky, who had woken up, rolled over and managed to punch Clint directly in his face. Throwing Clint off balance enough to have him clinging to the side of the truck as he fell over the edge, Steve scrambled over Buck to grab the front of Clint’s tactical vest. Buck kicked Steve in the ribs, and with the pain Steve knew immediately that at least one was broken or cracked. Steve turned over on his side to make eye contact with Bucky, They were silent for a moment until Bucky rolled out the back of the truck to hit the tarmac. Steve watched as he rolled to a stop and stood up. Blood running down his arm but alive. Bucky watched the truck for a moment, eyes solely on Steve, he scrambled into the forest and that was James Buchanan Barnes out of his life again.
Making his way up the stairs, through the main living area, Tony stopped to pick up a laundry basket that had been left on the kitchen island, loosening his tie off as he made his way down the hall to Peter’s room. He stopped just outside of his son’s room, rubbing his hand along along the door handle, taking the layer of dust with it. He wiped the dust off on the seam of his trousers, taking the handle again he opened the door.
Peter hated it already. He’d just walked in the door after barely being looked at by a bouncer, the invisible wall of noise hit him first, he was going to get a headache for sure. As soon as they walked up two steps, he could hear the thumping beat through the walls. Tony lead the way to a large hall which was filled with at least a couple of dozen people, the night hadn’t really start, or at least that was Peter’s guess. Tony spotted Rhodey at a booth in the corner of the hall, already set out with 3 pints of beer.
“I’m guessing you aren’t freaking out about the suit and the powers because Tony has told you?” Steve looked at Peter face with curious eyes. “Sort off, most roommates don’t have war propaganda with their face on it. I have a weird family anyway, it isn’t a bit deal for me… can I see it?” Steve furrowed his eyebrows until he quickly understood what Peter was referring to. “Give me 5 mins, I need to go collect my stuff from the Shield van outside, then I’ll give you a go at it kid.” Steve turned towards the door and as he was heading out, he heard Peter call from up the stairs, “Can you tell Un…Agent Barton to leave or take a break, nothing is happening up here, Tony’s not making a bomb or anything.” Steve was racking his brain as he headed down the stairs as to how Peter knew Barton.
“I’m Peter, I … am I awake, this isn’t real, I can’t believe this.” Peter stared wide eye directly into Tony’s. Tony held a soft smirk, he sat with his leg bend with the other crossed over on top, there was something familiar about this kid.
“Tony, come on, bed time it’s three am.” Rhodey was already standing in the hallway towards the bedrooms. “I’ll stay in Peter’s room, come one you need your bed.” Rhodey walked back and took Tony’s arm and pulled him along the hallway into Tony’s room. Tony stood as Rhodey pulled the covers off his bed and gestured for Tony to climb in. He pulled off his shoes and waist coat, pulling off and folding his trousers, the shirt sat well below his hips but he kept it on. Rhodey looked away as Tony climbed in his bed, but once Tony settled in bed, Rhodey quickly jogged over and gave Tony a tight hug. “I don’t know what has been happening but don’t shut me out again buddy. I’m here for you.” Tony nodded into Rhodey’s shoulder. “Thanks Honey-bear.” Rhodey got up to leave, before he turned off the light he turned back to Tony, “Oh and T. Don’t ever call me James again. It’s weird coming from you.” The pair chuckled together. Tony rolled over and Rhodey turned off the lights.
Peter smiled back, this was as close as he was going to get to his dad, maybe he could help him figure out a way home. Worth a shot. Peter offered to help unload the bags of food, even though the kitchen was a mess anyway.
