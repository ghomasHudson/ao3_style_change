Giorelli was a big man, and he sat on a chair like it was a throne. He followed the buyer’s hand, considering Nat, Sam and Steve as he puffed at his cigar. Though the buyer was a wild card, Steve knew that it was Giorelli who was the bigger enemy. He was cunning, and never went anywhere without his legion of massive bodyguards. Sure enough, men who looked like they survived on only red meat and chewed steroids for breakfast circled Steve’s team, who responded by shifting closer, pressing against each other’s backs. “I don’t know these people, Stella,” replied Giorelli. “Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it and then you can be along your merry way.” Giorelli flicked his hands and the men stepped closer, some of them cracking their knuckles.
Steve heard the shot before he felt it, but with his attention on Batroc, he didn’t have time to dodge before a bullet found its mark in his right shoulder. Steve grunted in pain, his shoulder rocking back from the force of the impact. He tried to scan the floor for the shooter, but Batroc had already leaped back to his feet, forcing Steve’s attention back to him.
There’s metal around his hands. Why is there metal? Is this Tony’s work? Steve struggled between trying to rip the strange spikes off his hands and the need to clench them even closer because what if Tony had made these? In the end, they retracted on their own, sinking into who knows where on his person. Steve missed them instantly. They reminded him of Tony, of his genius, his wit, his personality that seemed to light up the whole room.
Natasha huffed angrily. “I just…you’re never here during missions, mentally or physically. I’ve had to pull you out of harm’s way more times in the last month than I’ve had to over our whole career in the Avengers.” Steve’s jaw clenched when she mentioned the team, his hands fisting under the table. “You’re a liability right now, Steve. I would’ve expected this from someone like Tony, but you? I’ve never seen your emotions get the best of you like this. I can’t-” Her voice broke, and Steve looked up to find Nat’s face in her hands, blonde hair shielding her from his view.
“We’ll talk about this later,” she said, not an order, but certainly not a question either. Her blonde hair hung beside her tense eyes, and Steve’s heart clenched when he realized that he was pushing his family away just as far as Tony was.
Peter grinned, and he took off, his mouth moving a mile a minute. As they worked on Peter’s suit, the boy talked enthusiastically about everything from the best Lego sets to the benefits and drawbacks of different lightsabers, interrupting himself to plead, “Please, oh please, Mister Stark, could we make one”. Tony mostly listened, giving his input here and there. He was truly amazed by the brains of this kid and how he could talk so much without passing out from lack of oxygen.
They didn’t talk about anything important, not really; both of them staying far from anything having to do with Siberia. Their first texts had been the only exception, and since then, their conversations had been strictly small talk. Steve had tried to bring it up, once, but it hadn’t ended very well. Tony had ignored him for five days, during which Steve had snuck furtive glances at the phone between missions. When Steve finally got a reply back, it’d been about which colour tie Tony should wear to his next board meeting. Suffice it to say, he learned his lesson after that.
He moodily took a bite out of his bacon, not quite appreciating her meddling. “I’m not fragile, Pep. I can handle a shareholder’s meeting or two without spontaneously combusting.”
He deleted that instantaneously. Did he seriously think that was a good line? Tony mentally kicked himself. Chewing on the inside of his cheek, he started a new message. Typing on a flip phone was proving to be much harder than he expected.
They took turns cooking while they were stationed in safe houses, and tonight it was Natasha’s turn. She’d made a stew that looks like the kind of meal that Steve’s ma would have happily approved of. It had meat, potatoes, carrots and a few other things he couldn’t quite place but would eat anyway. They ate in silence, Steve at the head of the table with Nat and Sam on either side.
The first time they were deployed to the north, Steve had a full blown panic attack. One minute he was standing at the ready, the next his whole world was caving in on him. His senses seemed to dial up to one hundred, which made everything so much worse considering how freezing Northern Canada is no matter the season. His breath came in short pants that fogged in front of him and his fingers and toes went numb. He leaned against the concrete wall behind him, sliding to the floor when he felt like his legs couldn’t support him anymore.
The fight was a blur of blood and fists, and Steve lost count how many near fatal blows he delivered, wary of his strength even as he cut down soldier after soldier. Sam and Natasha were on the ground with him, taking care of the buyer’s weaker backup. Steve’s chest heaved as he pounded his shields into the massive lackeys, spinning frequently to avoid blows to the back. That wasn’t to say they didn’t get any hits in. Steve had the breath knocked out of him once or twice, and he could feel a bruise blooming on his chest. But it took a lot to fell a super soldier, and the pile of tree size men at his feet was growing rapidly.
The first thing Steve noticed was how loud it was. He wasn’t quite sure where he was, but the loud clanging was distantly familiar. There was another sound, but this one was more difficult to place. It was a high pitched whine that came and went, like the sound of something building charge.
With a sigh, Steve flopped onto his mattress, letting his bag slip out of his hand and onto the carpeted floor. The duvet smelled nice, like laundry detergent. His mind slipped back to his bed at the Tower, with its stupid lavender scented pillows and silky sheets. What he would give to wake up in that bed and pad down to the kitchen. Tony would be emerging from his lab, bleary eyed and exhausted, on the hunt for coffee and Clint would be burning eggs on the stove. Bruce would be sipping tea or some other herbal concoction that smelled like it’d’ve sent Steve into a coughing fit, way back when. Thor-well, Thor would probably be on Asgard or off with Jane. Natasha would watch him walk in, watch the way he smiled softly at Tony and know everything. She always knew everything.
He finished before them, rising to refill his bowl at the old gas stove. Pinnacle of modernity, this house was not. It was comforting and saddening at the same time. Steve slid back to the table, his socks shuffling on the cold, wood floor.
Her face shifted after a few seconds, eyes widening. “Wait!” cried the woman, pounding on the car window. “Stop!” The truck slowed.
A cool breeze hit his face. Was he on a roof? A quick look down into the blinding lights of the city confirmed his suspicions. How’d he get up here? Tony wanted to take in a deep breath of the sweet summery air, but he couldn’t. Panic, his worst nemesis, still held a vice-like grip on his throat.
Later that night, after being forced to use the cream and go to bed by Pepper and Rhodey, Tony lay flat on his back, staring at the ceiling, hands knotted together atop his stomach. It had been a good day. There was no doubt about it, the kid was like a ray of sunshine, lifting his spirits enough for Tony to continue on with the day rather than crawl back into bed with a bottle to keep him warm. He’d spent the rest of the afternoon tinkering in the workshop, then had baked (and burned) a disgustingly sweet cake with Pepper, capping off the evening with a movie with Rhodey. There had been no anxiety attacks or cruel, taunting voices in his head. Most importantly, he had only thought of Steve once.
They slid out, walking through the unkempt grass to the back of the building, where ivy climbed the old brick. Natasha set a device at the base of the wall, and a ladder unfurled itself, reaching all the way up to the roof. “After you,” she offered, gesturing towards it.
Tony pulled him in, forearms cruel. “I loved you, once. All you had to do was be honest, but no,” he whispered. “Now look what you’ve done.”
Steve’s cheeks twitched upward, his face pulling into a vicious grin. He shook his hands, calling his shields. “Who’s next?”
Tony’s world spun and no amount of liquor that he downed could stop the panic that had an iron grip around his throat. Air seemed scarce and the tightness in his chest refused to subside, the panic making him force out a rattling sob.
“Jesus Christ, do you ever give up?” the woman snapped, pausing to level her gun at Steve. He dodged the first shot, but the second and third hit him in his stomach and leg, respectively. Steve grunted, stumbling.
“What colour?” he asked, unclenching his teeth. He reached for the shakers on the table and peppered his soup, if only to bother Natasha, who took cooking very seriously and would never underseason her food. True enough, she swatted at him as he shook the flakes into his stew.
Metal fingers gripped his shoulder, and Steve spun to find the Iron Man suit looking at him, its inhuman eyes cold. His eyes drew down to the flickering light in its chest, a long, jagged cut bisecting the reactor. The suit’s fingers clenched tighter, transforming the ache in his shoulder into a shrieking burn. Steve tried to pry them off, but the joints held tight.
He wanted to break something. He wanted this to stop. He hated Steve. He wanted Steve. This constant tug of war within him and the mix of dread, fright and sorrowful love that welled up inside him at the thought of Steve made him feel like he was going to burn from the inside out. If this was what Hell felt like, then he may have to start rethinking all of his martyr ways. Tony gasped, choking. He wanted- no, he needed-air. Tony wheezed, stumbling towards a door.
Sam and Bucky exchanged a look. “We’re on it”, Sam said, nodding to Bucky, “We’ll check the other bathrooms, meet us back at the entrance”.
“Luckily for me, my faithful contacts have just given me some good news”, Stane said, pocketing him phone once more and turning back to the engineer, “Which means your services are no longer necessary”.
The restaurant, as it turned out, was on the sixty-fourth floor of one of the most beautiful buildings in New York. Tony had been there before, once with his parents and twice with one of his ex-boyfriends. He felt a pang of sorrow strike his chest like a knife. This, all of this, was a reminder of a life he had left behind, a life that had hurt him and left him broken on the ground. His thoughts were taking a dark turn and his face must’ve been showing it because Steve’s smiled disappeared the minute he turned to look at Tony.
“What is happening here?” a voice suddenly came from Peter’s right side, causing him to yelp loudly and drop the pizza he was holding on the floor.
Tony turned his head and looked at the kitchen, where he could hear Peter’s laugh and Rhodey and Bucky’s loud voices. He smiled and turned back to Steve, pulling his head down until their foreheads touched one another.
“Hey, P… Uh, Eldrin! Tell the goat to hoard the goblins over there, I’ve got an idea!”, Harley shouted at Peter, using his sword to swiftly cut a goblins throat.
“I’m just saying, man. It’s been three months. There is no way a civilian survives three months in the hands of some fucked up terrorists. The guy is dead. Better accept it now and be done with it”.
“Hi. You look incredible”, Steve whispered before pulling his boyfriend in for a long kiss. They were suddenly interrupted by a loud sniff.
Steve had a date! For the first time in years, he actually had a date! He had a date with Tony! Tony, who was his boss’ godson. Tony, the target he was supposed to shadow
“Look, I’m telling you, he’s looking over here. And he won’t stop looking. You think he recognized us?”
“And I’m telling you, we don’t need to do that because I have watched this movie a thousand times and I know for a fact that you’re wrong, so shut up and just accept defeat”.
“What about the accident?” Tony asked, confused, looking at Natasha. He quickly looked around when she didn’t answer him and noticed that everyone seemed to have gone eerily silent. They were looking at each other as if they knew a secret.
He pressed send and left his phone on the nightstand before closing his eyes and drifting off to sleep.
“Awesome. I’m starving…”, Tony replied, abandoning his keyboard and going straight for the bag. He opened it and looked inside, “So, did you bring Thai agaHOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK”.
He hung up the phone with a smile. Pepper would definitely make things much easier. He was about to turn and go to the kitchen, so he could check if Steve had arrived with their food, when suddenly his body went stiff. There was a loud, continuous ringing in his ears that seemed to travel through his whole body. He started to fall backwards, his legs giving out, when someone caught him, lowering him into the nearby couch. He frantically moved his eyes – the only thing he
“You said I was annoying and clingy. That you wished you saw less of me. I can’t help but wonder if you always felt that way and just… pretended for my sake”.
“Go for the heads, Tony!” Clint screamed, and the engineer did as he was told, blasting the animated corpses with amazing agility.
“So… I’m guessing we’re going down. And not in the fun way”, Tony said, stepping inside the pristine looking elevator.
That made Tony get up, and he would’ve hit his head right on Natasha’s forehead if she hadn’t been quick enough, “WAIT, ‘pen guy’ is Bucky?”
“I… I have a bad history with rich people”, Tony replied in a whisper and then laughed bitterly, “I went out with this guy. His name was Tiberius and he was kind of a dick. And it’s not even just him, it’s… Every rich person I know only cares about one thing: money. And you seem like a nice guy, Steve, but so did they and I’m just… not sure what to think about this”.
made it pretty clear that Stark senior had had some involvement with the Vanko family before his death. Years before, if the date on the file was to be believed.
The agent nodded, "Dude just came back from sea, right? Too much time out there can really mess with your head".
He could feel something moving through the skin and into him, going around, searching for something. Then, the feeling disappeared and he heard a soft
“Go now, brave adventurers, and good luck. But fear not, we shall meet again”, and with another loud thunder echoing through the clearing, Strange disappeared in a cloud of smoke.
Tony turned then and looked at Steve with a sheepish look while big mechanical arms took apart what seemed to be… armor. Tony was wearing fucking armor.
“Ah, she awakes”, the small, weak looking man directly in front of her said, hands behind his back in a very nonchalant manner, “I must confess, I expected more from the great Black Widow”.
As the weeks passed, they grew even closer and, slowly, Tony started to share more and more of his previous life with his boyfriend.
“But then you had to go ahead and start talking about being CEO and about Stark Industries and how you wanted to change things. Don’t get me wrong, my boy, I knew you could do it. I knew you could completely change the company and still bring the money to my pockets, but, you see… I had some really faithful clients that I knew wouldn’t like this whole revamping the company very much. So I had to get you out of the game, Tony, for your own good, your own safety”.
It took them a good few minutes to finally arrive at the last room, at the end of the long corridor. This room, unlike the others, was much more spacious and less destroyed. There were bodies scattered around, much like everywhere else they’ve been, with their eyes wide and unseeing, making for a very unsettling scene. Steve and Tony walked in, side by side, looking around, trying to find anything of importance.
Their friendship continued through high school and college. When Tony was accepted at MIT, Natasha chose to go to Harvard to stay close to her friend. They shared a cozy, but very expensive apartment, courtesy of their filthy rich parents, and did everything together, which was probably why so many people thought they were dating. After all, how could two very attractive people like them NOT be together? And that was exactly what Bucky and Steve wholeheartedly believed.
Natasha took a deep breath, and Steve braced himself. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d found himself on the receiving end of her fury, but he’d certainly witnessed it a handful of times when Tony or Clint did something stupid in battle. And sure enough, the fire she lobbed at him was anything but pleasant.
The safehouse was unassuming, a small house on the bad side of town. Steve wished they’d been able to spring for something in the suburbs, but he knew that between gossipy PTA mothers and keen-eyed children, their covers would have blown before they could’ve stepped onto the porch. The place was nice enough, for a safehouse. He didn’t know why or how T’Challa owned it, but he was much too tired and much too grateful to question anything that man did for him.
The woman pulled something from her pocket and brought it up to her face, staring at it longingly. She heaved a sigh, before pressing a button on the device. “What a waste of good product,” the buyer mused, tossing it towards Steve. “Book it!” she cried, and the truck sped off, her twisted laughter echoing behind them.
And then, from deep in the folds of his duffel bag, beneath clothes and the hyper sophisticated, off the grid phone T’Challa had given him before he’d left, Steve’s flip phone buzzed.
Natasha gave him a look as he packed up his duffel, but Steve steadfastly ignored her. She probably knew exactly what’s going on in his head, possibly even better than he did, but she was waiting for him to tell her. Which wasn’t going to happen. Not unless pigs took to the sky.
HI SO SORRY FOR LEAVING YOU HIGH AND DRY (and on a cliffhanger no less) FOR LIKE 6 MONTHS. More on our mysterious absence in the end notes since we don't want to keep you from reading this next chapter any longer.
Winding up his arm, Steve launched the bomb as far as he could away from the building, watching it fly away from him. It wouldn’t be enough, but it might spare Nat and Sam. “Bombs always were my weakness,” he replied, trying for a light tone. His heart pulled, and Steve choked in a breath. “Tell Tony to save me a dance,” he gasped, gritting his teeth against the pain.
Also, he doubted anyone would recognize him with black hair and a beard. Even Tony. Especially Tony. Not that Steve thought he was looking.
Tony heard Rhodey chuckle. He must have said that last bit aloud. Tony managed to take in a shuddering breath. Then another. Then another, until finally, his shoulders relaxed a bit and he was fully able to lean into the comfort and warmth of his best friend. His best friend, who felt like a poor stand in for Steve, despite all that he’d done.
The light was almost too bright to bear, but the repulsors demanded attention, burning bright against his shield. Steve kicked and punched Tony like he was a bully in a back alley rather than the man he’d loved since they’d locked eyes on the helicarrier. His fingers were so cold he was surprised they were still attached to his body by the time he was gripping his shield, arms lifted above his head. He could only watch himself drive it down into Tony’s chest, the arc reactor sputtering.
“You know, this is all very inconvenient for me,” the woman ranted. “I go through all this trouble to get to Giorelli and you and your merry band of vigilantes swoop in out of absolutely nowhere to try and stop me. It’s…well, it’s rude, quite honestly! All that hard work for nothing. Do you realize how difficult it is to get a meeting with Giorelli?”
Steve’s body flew through the air, fire and smoke cocooning him. The cold finally melted away, and Steve greeted death with a smile.
“Put your weapons down and come quietly,” Steve commanded, squaring his shoulders. He surveyed the room, counting the goons on either side of the transaction. The buyer looked to be female, her face covered by a mask. Though he couldn’t see her face, she looked tense, her fingers obviously twitching for her weapon at her side. Behind her, nearly a dozen men and women dressed in tac vests had risen to their feet. They looked like your typical SHIELD agent, meaning that they looked to be quick on their feet and better at hand to hand then most would guess at first glance.
Steve rose to his feet, ducking Batroc’s blow before barreling into him. He drew out his shields, pressing them to Batroc’s throat. Batroc smirked, blood dripping down his forehead. “
The days seemed to mix together in an achingly tiresome blend of colours. Staying awake felt like a never-ending battle, but falling asleep was completely out of question. It had been four months, and yet no amount of coffee, tinkering or loud music, all things that used to take the edge off of a particularly hard day, could banish the thoughts from his head.
With a final count, Steve shook out his shields and took the plunge, dropping silently into the fray. He landed on his toes, absorbing the blow, and soon Natasha and Sam were right behind him, weapons at the ready.
Steve’s face was taken between two warm palms, his head turned to face a woman with a stern expression and worried eyes. His brain rushed to place her, and he frowned. “It’s September 29, 2016. You’re in a safehouse with Natasha and Sam. We’re your teammates. We will not hurt you. Sam tried to wake you because we have a mission at 0600, and we need to brief and pack. Do you understand?”
Sam took the bait, scaling the ladder with Natasha on his heels. Steve went up last, and soon they were all three standing on the empty roof. Natasha collected the ladder as Steve scanned their surroundings, hands on his hips. They were in the middle of nowhere, with only farmlands as far as Steve could see. A red barn at least 3 miles away was the only other building, a tall wheat silo standing proud beside it.
Peter’s words faded out, and Tony’s fingers stilled on the keyboard. His heart rate picked up as he remembered late nights in the lab with Steve curled up on the slightly singed couch stuffed in the corner, the sound of charcoal sketching on coarse paper mingling with the hum of the machines in the lab.
“Would you stop that?” Nat stopped, swatting his hands away. Her voice was sharp, her nerves obviously on edge. “You’re stressing me out just looking at you.”
She shrugged. “No reason. Just wondering.” Steve knew that wasn’t all, so he ate cautiously, waiting for whatever she’d eventually decide to spring on him. He tried to catch Sam’s eye to no avail.
When FRIDAY alerted them of the time, it certainly dampened Peter’s mood. “Thanks, Mister Stark. I had a really great time today!” he said, collecting his book bag from the floor.
After a while, Steve blinked, taking in a deep breath. The sun had long since set, and he sat alone in darkness. Silently, Steve left his chair and headed into his bedroom, going through the motions as he got ready for bed. He rinsed his toothbrush under the tap water, squirting toothpaste on the bristles. He shut the tap off, glancing up at the mirror.
Steve huffed, shoving meat into his mouth in an effort to avoid the conversation. “Not my fault,” he muttered around his spoon.
Peter laughed. “Okay, okay. Bye, Mister Stark!” he called, jogging through the glass exit and heading towards the subway.
Giorelli tapped his cigar into an ashtray, considering Steve. “You come into my place of work, try and order me to stop business and you expect me to just walk out nicely?” Giorelli chuckled. “I don’t think so. Joey? On with this, please. We have guests.”
T’Challa sighed. “I know, Romanov. But this man needs to face justice, not just the barrel of your gun.” Something exploded behind T’Challa, and he startled, turning around to shout at a cackling Shuri. “I have to go,” he said, rising from his spot in front of the camera. “Best of luck.”
Peter shot him a hesitant smile before walking into the lab to set camp beside Tony. He dropped his bag on the floor by the worktable. “So,” began Tony, opening up a holographic screen in front of the both of them, scrolling through to Peter’s file. “How was school?” he asked, cringing inwardly at the domesticity of it all.
He closed his eyes and could barely breathe as the truth sunk in for the millionth time: Natasha had chosen to follow
“Alright, alright. Jesus,” Tony said, exasperated. There was silence as the two stared each other down. Tony was the first to break, fighting against the smile creeping onto his face. “Motherhood does not suit you.”
Under Rhodey’s almost hawk-like stare, Tony downed his medication with a mug of lukewarm coffee. Looking pleased with himself, Rhodey returned to his newspaper and Tony couldn’t help but roll his eyes at his old man habits. Pepper walked into the kitchen, the sound of her heels clicking against the hardwood floor. She didn’t look up from her StarkPad, snatching a bagel from Rhodey’s plate before walking up to Tony.
The mirror gave easily under his fist, and Steve let the blood run down his fingers. It’d be healed by the morning anyway.
Steve favoured his left side as he fought Batroc, growing frustrated at how much dodging he had to do without the full use of his right arm. Batroc sunk low as Steve roundhoused kicked the space where he’d been. Batroc grabbed Steve’s leg, flipping him to the ground. Steve fell onto his injured shoulder, and he gasped as his vision darkened from the pain.
The elevator dinged and its doors closed. Tony deflated, rubbing at his chest to try to ease the pain his scars were causing him. He turned towards the churning coffee machine, waiting for a fresh pot. Rhodey gently set his newspaper down on the kitchen counter, his eyes following Tony’s every move.
Steve had tensed his shoulders without realising, and made an effort to relax them when he caught Natasha watching him. He forced a smile at T’Challa. “Thank you. That’s good to hear.”
, despite everything he had done to Tony. Tony took another long swig of his drink, welcoming the borderline painful burning sensation as it slid not quite smoothly down his throat. Subconsciously, his hand rubbed his chest, the absence of his arc reactor and the bumps of the scarred skin beneath his worn-out grey shirt sending his thoughts spiralling dangerously. His clutch on the bottle tightened as the sounds of the shield against the arc reactor echoed around the empty house; each rhythmic clank sending bone-chilling dread down his spine. The physical pain God’s Righteous Man had inflicted on him was nothing to the gut-wrenching sense of betrayal he had felt when Steve had just left him there. It has been four difficult and gruelling months, and yet it was funny how it only seemed like yesterday where Steve had broken his heart and thrown its pieces into the cold Siberian wind.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “What’s your huge problem with this? It’ll grow back in no time; your hair grows at, like, triple the rate a normal human’s.” She flicked Steve’s bangs, which were starting to flop into his face. He’d started growing out his hair at Natasha’s request when they went on the run in an effort to distance himself from the world’s perception of Steve Rogers, war hero and legend. He’d also gotten a little bit attached in the process and would be a little annoyed if Natasha’s decided he had to spend the next four months with black hair.
Tony faced Rhodey, and the disappointment directed at him made his stomach knot. “Come on, Rhodes. What’s it been, twenty years we’ve known each other? You know I never listen,” he replied with as much sass he could muster, smirking half-heartedly.
“Yeah, kid. You worry too much for your own good,” Tony replied lightheartedly. He brought his hand up to Peter’s head without thinking. By the time he realized what he was doing, it was too awkward to retract his hand, so he patted Peter, ruffling his hair. Peter’s eyes were wide with mild surprise and he looked like he was trying his hardest to keep a giddy smile off his face.
The buyer glanced at the wall, noticing at the same time as Steve that large cracks had begun to form in the mortar. “Looks like my ride’s here,” she smirked, backing up at a jog to stand behind a stack of shipping crates. Steve braced for impact, unable to move due to the gun still trained on his forehead.
Steve heard Natasha rise from the bed, and stared at the wall as she walked in front of him. A few seconds of silence later, he dragged his eyes down to meet hers. “Mind on the mission, Rogers,” she reminded him, sending a small flare of anger shooting through him. He’d been nothing but focused ever since she’d reprimanded him that night after the museum, only letting himself break down in the privacy of his own room.
Steve groaned and Sam snorted a little into his stew. “What?” Natasha balked, raising her hands. “Goldilocks over here tends to draw a lot of looks.”
“Batroc,” he said, surprised. Keeping his shields tucked away, he raised a fist, taunting the man. “
The cold fist around his heart squeezed, reminding Steve why Sam and Natasha were best kept at arm’s length. As he looked at Natasha, the clanging filled his ears, screaming at him that the only people he could hurt were those that thought he cared. Steve squared his shoulders, shifting the weight on his back. “Sure,” he lied, tongue heavy with fibbs and half-truths.
Natasha slipped away after giving him one last long look, closing the door behind her, and Steve sunk onto the bed. It was much too soft, much too reminiscent of his old home, but he gave himself a second to ignore everything and just piece himself back together into this strange amalgamation of parts.
Tony stood beside him, smiling happily as he rubbed his hand along Steve’s cheek. He laughed, the sound reverberating off the tiled floor. Steve could only watch, helpless, as Tony’s ghost winked at him in his reflection, as if everything was alright.
Grabbing the strawberry from Rhodey’s plate and popping it in his mouth, he made his way to the elevator, not missing the little snort of laughter Rhodey tried to disguise as a cough.
When Natasha gave him the signal, Steve jumped into action, racing through the abandoned building to greet their target. If Nat or Sam noticed he doesn’t use his shields, even when they’re ambushed by the target’s goons, they don’t say anything.
Steve picked himself off the ground, walking down the dimly lit corridor. Water dripped from somewhere, falling to the ground in sync to his footsteps. He emerged into a tall, cylindrical room, the ceiling a gaping hole, leading into nothing. Steve walked to the middle of the floor, looking up, his gaze travelling past all the broken railings and falling metal plates. He squinted, confused. Was that...space?
His chest twisted with the familiar feelings of guilt, sadness and despair at the reminder of the sister he’d lost without ever really having in the first place, despite his best efforts. He swallowed thickly, teeth clenched, grip tight on the vodka before pressing it up to his lips to try and stave off the confusion and hurt that often set in on days like these.
He stared at the message he had typed up. He couldn’t send that. His thumb hovered over the “ENTER” button for a while, the idea mulling over in his mind. Finally, he shook his head. This was a terrible idea.
One final blow sent the bricks flying, and Steve grunted as one hit him on the temple, another smacking him painfully in the chest. Steve fell to the ground, coughing as dust flooded the space. The woman cackled, and Steve’s head throbbed at the sudden noise. He blinked blood out of his eyes, wiping it away with his left hand. Steve hurried to his feet, pulling out his shields to chase after the buyer. His ribs ached, and he already knew they were bruised, if not broken. He pushed through the pain, sprinting after the woman to intercept her before she could hop onto the massive, armoured truck.
Steve sat in the kitchen long after she’d left, the words replaying over and over again in his head. If Sam returned at some point, Steve didn’t notice, his perfect memory too busy inking Nat’s words into his brain. She was right. He’d been sloppy, endangering both the mission and his teammates, making mistakes that should’ve been drilled out of him back in Basic. He felt a wave of shame wash over him, accompanied as always by a cool rush that numbed him from the crown of his head down to his toes.
“Sounds like Giorelli’s meeting with the buyer now. We’ll wait two minutes for the money to change hands, and then we strike before either of them can leave the building,” he whispered. They nodded soberly and Steve continued to listen, easily distinguishing between Giorelli’s thick accent and the buyer’s monotone, electronic timber.
Steve’s shields retracted in preparation as the biggest goon stepped forward. Joey threw a punch at Steve which he easily caught, much to his surprise. Steve twisted Joey’s fist back, listening for the sick crunch before delivering an uppercut to the goon’s jaw with his knee. One final blow to his head and Joey was down for the count, eyes glassy on the floor.
Steve gasped for air, hand flying up to bat the intruder off of him. It was dark, but quiet except for the person’s wheeze of pain as Steve’s arm connected with a hard chest.
Tony felt his breath even out and didn’t even have the energy to fight off the tug of sleep as he slipped off into blissful oblivion.
“Wakanda is excellent as always,” T’Challa said, smirking a little. “Barnes is still in cryo while our doctors conduct more research, but other than that, we are prosperous as always.”
He delivered one final blow to the man in front of him, kicking the unconscious body to the floor. His eyes landed on Giorelli, still seated in his chair. His eyes were narrowed, and as Steve strode purposefully towards him, wiping blood from his mouth, they flickered with fear. Steve shucked his shields, picking up the man by his collar and tugging him up to his face. He pulled a thin file drive from his pocket, waving it in front of Giorelli’s face. “Think you could do something for me?” he asked, grin crooked and a little crazed.
“What the hell are you talking about? You’re a wizard! This is a simple amnesia case, it’s not like we’re asking you to kill freaking Voldemort here”.
“I gotta say, it’s nice to finally meet the guy who had my friend by the balls after just one date”, Bucky said, throwing his arm on Natasha’s shoulder. He looked relaxed, too relaxed.
There were too many goblins. Even with the bear’s help, it was still a difficult battle. They fought as if they’d been using swords their whole lives, which was weird but still very awesome. The gang killed the goblins that came at them with ease. Apparently, it was much easier, morally speaking, to kill people when you knew they were just illusions created by the God of Mischief. While they fought, Peter continued his work, liberating more and more animals, including a huge goat that Ned was pretty sure was actually a horse in disguise.
“We’re playing Dungeons and Dragons”, MJ replied, taking a big bite out of her pizza, staring at Loki with an unimpressed look.
Tony felt himself fall to the floor, slowly, back against the working bench. He knew he was crying because he could feel the tears sliding down his face. He felt nothing. It was like the pain was so severe his mind decided to turn itself off. He hugged his legs, pulling them closer to his chest, and let himself go. He had been so stupid to think he could have this. That he could ever deserve someone like Steve. Fate had once again showed that the monster Tony Stark was not good enough to have a happy ending. He didn’t deserve one.
When Dr. Cho came out of the surgical room much later, they were all standing there, holding each other as they waited for news. And when she smiled, it was like the world had exploded in color once again. Tony felt light, free, like he’d been carrying the entire world on his back for a century and, suddenly, the weight had been lifted.
And at that moment, feeling Steve’s mouth on his, feeling his soft touches on his body, Tony couldn’t help but think of all the things they had faced so far, and all the things they would most likely face in the future. And for the first time in a very long time he wasn’t afraid. Because they would face everything together, just like Steve had always said.
“No, dumbass, I mean it’s weird that this random guy you met at the supermarket is sending you pictures of a baby that hasn’t even been born yet”, Bucky countered, rolling his eyes and sitting next to Steve, passing him a beer.
“Mr. Stane. I don’t usually make house calls, but I was nearby so it was no trouble”, he said, shaking the man’s hand, “I
Steve stopped for a second with a fake pensive look, “I think I actually prefer to be Catwoman in this scenario”. There was silence, and then, “You’re picturing me in a Catwoman suit, aren’t you?”
“You… You’ve been cheating on me?” Tony asked quietly, his big, brown eyes filled with pain and confusion.
. He was getting ready to get up and go straight to the workshop when the elevator doors opened and the rest of the Avengers stepped out, all smiling.
“Turns out I really was the Merchant of Death”, he said with a huff, “But now… Now I finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it’s right. And I can’t turn back. I can’t be the person that I was before. I need to do this”.
On the other side of the line, Special Agent Coulson waited patiently for the Widow to be finished, completely unworried with the clear sounds of a fight coming from the other end. After a few moments, someone picked up the phone again.
The woman looked to both sides and, seeming satisfied that no one was near enough to hear their conversation, started talking in whispers.
“We told him you two might want some privacy to celebrate, but he couldn’t be stopped”, Natasha explained, sitting down on the couch, “So, where’s your other half?”
Tony turned and looked to where Rhodey was pointing. Indeed, the corridor was full of posters with phrases and little drawings. He started walking, slowly, stopping at every single one.
“Good choice. We’ll share the fries, thanks”, he told the girl who was taking their order. His hand slid down from Steve’s arm to his hand, intertwining their fingers as he pulled the taller man to a nearby wooden table. By the time they sat down, Steve was already very uncomfortable, trying to get his very unexpected hard-on under control.
“Oh, my mistake, then”, T’Challa said, unworried, “I did not know that, thank you for warning me, my friend”.
Bucky and Sam were laughing their asses off, holding their stomachs and desperately trying to breathe. Clint stood in front them, his mouth wide open, moving his hands back and forth in front of his mouth. Steve narrowed his eyes.
“Thanks”, Steve replied, feeling his face grow hot, “I always loved to draw. I used to spend whole days drawing when I was kid”.
. He was just about to try and convince the other man that they could just forget the whole thing when two strong arms circled his waist and pulled him closer. He ended up on Steve’s lap, with a loud yelp of surprise, one leg on each side, and didn’t even have enough time to truly understand what was happening before Steve smashed their mouths together, his hands grabbing at Tony’s hair, moaning as he explored every inch of his mouth.
Steve came out of the bathroom a few minutes later wearing a Star Wars t-shirt (“I would make a Star Wars pun but I don’t want to
It could have been just a fling. They could have parted ways the next morning with a very sore ass ― in Tony’s case ― and a wonderful memory to cherish. But Tony woke up to the smell of coffee and freshly baked bagels and went to the kitchen, only to find a very naked Steve wearing a Captain America apron. Needless to say, breakfast was forgotten as Tony sucked Steve’s cock right there on the floor and the blond moaned his name until he came in Tony’s throat.
“Uh, yeah”, Steve replied, trying to get his brain to work again, “I was sick a lot when I was a kid so I’d miss a lot of school. I’d just stay at home, looking out my window, drawing everything I saw, you know?”
He couldn’t leave. Not when Natasha was probably still there. Had he found her? Had he shot her? Cursing under his breath, Tony looked over the desk, but saw nothing. Wherever the man was, he was too far away to be seen. He couldn’t leave. He couldn’t. And so, with a courage that he’d never felt before in his life, Tony got up and ran towards the noise.
“Don’t worry about it”, Tony interrupted Steve with a smile, “I’m an eccentric billionaire, it’s what we do. Now, why don’t we have the wedding here? The place is absolutely beautiful, my PA got married here. I’m sure she would love to organize the whole thing for you”.
“Stevie, you monumental bag of potatoes, why the hell didn’t you say something? You could’ve just told him it was a joke and asked him out”.
“I’m sure it was a very mighty watch, nevertheless, my friend”, Thor spoke, slapping Steve in the back in solidarity.
Bucky, now having everyone’s undivided attention, showed them the chain with the dog tags and the ring.
There were many types of “drunk” in the world. The depressed drunks, like Bruce; the loose all my inhibitions drunk, like Thor ― which was how Bruce and Thor got together in the first place, when the latter decided to drink an entire bottle of vodka and recited a Scandinavian love poem to the scientist, who wept during the entire thing thinking Thor was professing his love to someone else. There were the happy drunks, like Sam and Clint who transformed any party into a karaoke party after a few drinks, and the “you can’t even tell I’m drunk” type, like Natasha. Then, there was the worst kind of drunk: the “let’s do something stupid that sounds really funny and ingenious now that we’re super drunk but will definitely come bite us in the ass later” kind of drunk, which was precisely the type of drunk Steve and Bucky were.
“YOU MADE OUT WITH HIM?” Clint exclaimed from the back seat and then promptly laughed out loud, “Holy shit, dude, did you get to second base?”
Life's been a bit chaotic, but I finally managed to finish this chapter! I had a lot of work these past weeks, which is awesome because that means I might have a bit of extra cash to get myself a birthday present this month, YAY!
Steve glared at his boyfriend, “Good job, Tony”, then, turning to the little girl, “That’s a bad word, sweetheart, we can’t say that”.
, he thought to himself as he got in the car, slamming the door with a little bit more force than planned,
“The plan is for the infiltrated agent at SI to use the device to get the proof we need. That’s it. I don’t have another plan, Steve”, he explained, shaking his head with yet another sigh, “This isn’t me hiding some fucked up plan from you, okay? This is just me thinking about the fact that I let Stane fool me for years. I believed him. I… Damn, I’d go as far as to say that I loved him. He was family, you know? He stopped my dad from beating me up; he backed me up when I told my dad I wanted to be an engineer instead of getting a business degree. Now I keep thinking about all these situations, all these things he’s done for me, and I keep wondering… Why? He stopped my dad because he wanted me to trust him? He backed me up because if I had gone to business school I’d have taken his place at the company? I keep imagining all these reasons why and it’s fucking up with my head”, he finished, frustrated.
Steve almost killed himself in that moment. He put his cup on the nearby coffee table, trying desperately to get some air into his lungs while simultaneously trying
She turned around and looked over the other side of the room. There was a big glass box right in front of the TV. She walked slowly towards it and almost yelped when she finally saw what was inside. The box was in fact an airtight container and, inside, was the dead body of an older Anton Vanko. Jessica raised her camera and quickly took some pictures of the barely decomposed body, trying very hard not to vomit.
“Over here”, Tony called them, touching the wall in front of him with interest before taking a step back. He raised his hand, emitting a red light that slowly covered the wall before disappearing again.
Tony read every single one of them with a small smile on his face, completely ignoring everyone else who just stood there, watching him. He finally got to the last one.
Steve didn’t quite know how to respond to that. Sensing this, Tony sighed and turned back to him while struggling to fix his tie.
DUM-E beeped loudly and happily, running over to Tony while its claw head like a kid. He stopped right in front of the mechanic, beeping away as if he was trying to talk. Tony touched him softly, making the machine beep even more, and then hugged him awkwardly. The mechanic had tears in his eyes. He looked up to see Steve on the door to their bedroom, a small smile on his face.
Steve and Clint had told Bucky everything. Well, Steve had told Bucky everything. Clint had tried, but he was laughing too hard and couldn’t finish his sentences.
And Tony had to admit. That hurt him worse than a kick in the balls. He had heard about Bucky, of course, he was in every single one of Steve’s stories. But it was obvious that Bucky had never heard of him.
“Thanks, but I should finish these”, then, she lowered her voice and got a bit closer to the other woman, who stepped forward, as if ready to hear a dirty secret, “the boss’ being a bit impatient lately”.
“I must speak with you, Mr. Stark. Do you have a moment?” He said, looking to the sides as if checking if anyone was listening. He seemed nervous.
“So”, Bucky said, taking one of the menus on the table, “What are we ordering? I think the lasagna sounds pretty good”.
“Well, we could pretend that the pressure of the wedding became too much and fight in front of him and then break up”.
Bucky quickly put the little girl down and grabbed her hand, “Come on, let’s leave your daddies alone for a minute!”
Natasha and Bucky were standing next to them with a very irate Italian man screaming right behind them. Natasha had her blouse almost entirely open, with only one button done. Bucky stood right beside her, holding his pants on his arms and looking very pleased with himself. They didn’t have time to discuss this turn of events, however, because the owner quickly kicked them out on the street, barely giving Tony enough time to pay for their food. They stood outside, in the cold air, just staring at each other.
It took his driver twenty five minutes to get to the car shop, which was great because it gave Steve some time to get to know Tony. Apparently, the brunette wasn’t just a mechanic, but also a recently graduated MIT engineer. He had opened the shop not too long ago with the help of a friend. Paying rent wasn’t easy these days, he said, but business was getting better so he had high hopes for the future.
“Would you like to hold him?” Maria asked in greeting as soon as her tired eyes landed on Margaret, carefully lifting the small, blue bundle in her arms in the brunette’s direction. She accepted the baby, cradling his head as she raised him closer to her own face.
Tony looked up and smiled. Steve was wearing nothing but a pair of black boxers, holding a steaming cup of coffee.
with Director Carter, mainly because Steve was going to meet Tony, but also because he was pretty sure his friend would tell Clint all about said meeting, in excruciating detail, and he didn’t feel like being made fun of at the moment. Of course, he didn’t count on Tony almost passing out from laughing after he told him what happened. He did find a way to shut him up, however, and he had to admit, it was a very pleasurable one. Their passion was something Steve had never experienced before in his life. Being with Tony was like burning from the inside out; he needed Tony like a thirsty man in the middle of the desert needed water. The raw need was so strong, so powerful, sometimes he could barely contain it. It was unlike anything he’d ever felt before and he loved every minute of it.
“Hello, Captain Rogers. I’m Virginia Potts, Mr. Stane’s personal assistant. Please follow me, he’s in the workshop waiting for you”.
“Sweetheart, you don’t have to worry, okay? Santa has magic! Even if we didn’t have JARVIS to show him the secret passage, he would just use his magic to get inside!”, he kissed his son’s head, “I promise you he’s coming tonight and he’s going to leave you lots of presents, okay?”
“We’re on our way”, he replied, taking a turn just as he hung up the phone, "It was Natasha. We’re supposed to meet the Director now”.
Morgan agreed and let herself be led out of the room by her uncle, both being closely followed by Sam. As soon as the door closed, Tony pulled Steve closer by the tie and kissed him deeply.
Tony stayed the next three days at home. Fooling Jarvis was rather easy. He only had to tell the butler he felt really sick and with his red eyes and runny nose (from all the crying) it was an easy sell. Jarvis did look a bit suspicious, but said nothing, and let Tony stay at home for as long as he needed.
“I see. Well, Mr. Rogers, I believe I may have a solution to your troubles. Tell me, are you afraid of needles?”
“Because if we tell him, he’ll feel obligated to be with me”, Tony explained in an angry tone, “You know how he is. He’ll think that because we were together before this happened, he’s obligated now to be my… partner. I don’t want that. He doesn’t know me, I’m a complete stranger. We’ll tell him the basics and that’s it”.
They all met at Natasha’s floor as soon as Bucky made the call. Thor was out there somewhere with Dr. Strange, most likely looking for a way to revert Loki’s spell, but Vision and Wanda were back, which was good. They would need all the help they could get.
Ross squeezed the radio in his hand, almost breaking it. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He didn’t want to admit it, but the doctor was right.
Steve opened his eyes slowly, blinking, trying to get them used to the light. He hadn’t had that bad a headache since before Project Rebirth and he very much hadn’t missed feeling like this. He felt nauseous, like he would throw up at any moment, and his head was a swirl of thoughts and memories and names and faces. It was all very confusing and he felt very
“Yeah”, Tony nodded and turned around, opening the door and walking in with Steve right behind him, “Okay. So, you wanna watch 007?”
“You feed her pancakes and hot chocolate, trust me, she likes you”, he replied, “Just… Trying talking to her, babies can hear our voices and they recognize it”.
“Wow. Hi, handsome. You waiting for someone?”, he heard a voice from behind him and turned around, smiling.
A loud buzzing sound interrupted the conversation. Steve took his phone out of his pocket and cursed loudly.
Later that night, she and Howard talked. She shouted at him, her anger getting the best of her, even going as far as threatening to take Anthony away from them. And that was when everything changed. Howard stood up from his chair, a cold expression in his face as he informed Margaret that, should she try such thing, he would have no problem exposing her
“Trust me, Peg, you’ll change your mind once the sun comes up and you see the beautiful view of the beach. There’s nothing like it”, Howard replied, giving her a kiss on the cheek with a smile that could light up an entire room.
They were at a fancy bakery in Manhattan, surrounded by couples who were, much like them, deciding on flavors and designs for their wedding cakes. Steve was looking down at his own table, staring at the cupcakes and pieces of cake neatly aligned in front of him, the fancy glass of sparkling water on his right and the three tiny cups filled with different toppings for him to sample. The whole experience was surreal. He didn’t know how to act. Bucky, however, was not having such a problem.
“I don’t actually need the wheelchair, by the way”, he complained, pouting, “But they won’t let me walk. It’s bullshit”.
, “and I wanted to keep it safe from the wrong people. My guardian found out and he wanted the code. He came after me, tried to drag me home. I refused. According to my father’s will, though, I
“It is possible, yes. From what Mr. Stark has told us, we could file for undue influence or we could claim that the signature on the will was forged. According to the dates you’ve provided, Mr. Stark senior changed his will only days before his untimely death, which brings a lot of suspicion on its own, and, of course, there’s also the fact that Mr. Stark senior publicly claimed, many times, that legacy was of the utmost importance to him and expressed his desires to see his son take his place when the time was right. Which brings the question, why would a man who worked tirelessly to make sure his son would be a perfect heir to his empire suddenly decide said son was no longer fit for the job, passing everything, including his son’s intellectual property, to a partner? It raises questions and, right now, that’s exactly what we need”.
The team, however, didn’t give up. They invited Steve out for various activities, like going to the movies, or grabbing something to eat, or jogging through Central Park, etc., and talked about Tony.
"Fortunately, no one was killed during the attack, but the FBI confirms Hammer will be investigated and, if found guilty, prosecuted for treason. Meanwhile, Tony Stark and new CEO of Stark Industries, Virginia Potts, are trying to salvage what's left of the expo. Mr. Stark's spokesperson reached out to Channel 9 this afternoon, confirming that the Maria Stark Foundation will be covering all medical bills from those who were present at the expo at the time of the attack".
“He’s amazing, actually”, Steve replied, unable to keep himself from smiling. He looked up and frowned when he noticed the serious look on his best friend’s face, “what?”
“Tony”, Steve said, relief dripping from his voice. He engulfed Tony in his arms, burying his face in his neck.
“I don’t…” he shook his head, trying to get his focus back, “Why do you want Bucky to fuck you? You’re pregnant!”
“You’re so funny. No, really, I’m laughing on the inside”, Tony deadpanned right back, going straight for his soon to be husband, “You’re really bad at this, aren’t you?”
The gift shop was on three floors down. Still, Steve decided to use the stairs instead of the elevator. He figured the exercise might help with his anxiety. It didn’t. Even as he jogged down to the first floor, his mind wandered. He was worried about Tony and the baby, of course he was, but if he was being honest, there was another issue plaguing his thoughts: what if Tony didn’t need him anymore? Well, it wasn’t like he had needed him before, in all honesty, but he’d been lonely and, frankly, quite sad about being traded by a younger, non-pregnant model, as he liked to call it. But now, Tony had a baby girl to take care of and fuss over and to just be the center of his attention from now on. It was only expected for Steve to fade into the background, become a funny story that Tony would tell his daughter years from now.
, “I put a code on it, something not even the best hacker in the world could crack. It was important and expensive”,
That night, he got fifteen calls from Steve, three voicemails and a dozen texts. He ignored all of them. He didn’t want to talk to anyone, least of all Steve. He was deeply hurt and had never felt so stupid in his entire life. Of course they weren’t dating. Tony should have seen it coming. He laid there on his bed and remembered every single moment he spent with Steve out in the open. They never held hands when they were in public. They never hugged, never kissed, shit, even when they went to those restaurants, Steve never even sat close to him. He always kept his distance, and at first Tony thought he was just one of those guys who didn’t like PDAs, but now he knew better.  Steve just didn’t want anyone to know he was fucking Tony. He didn’t want people to figure out he was involved with someone like Tony. And honestly, who could blame him? Tony was aware of who he was. Howard had never let him forget it. Lazy, good for nothing, never got anything right. And his last two boyfriends, Justin and Ty, had both agreed wholeheartedly with Howard’s opinion on his son. So why would Steve be any different? He should have known. It was stupid of him to think anyone would want him for anything more than just sex. And so Tony spent the whole night hating himself.
“I’m Calypso, the human rogue pirate”, Cassie introduced herself with an exaggerated flourish of her hand.
Suddenly, his phone rang, taking his mind away from Jarvis and his younger years. He took it from the coffee table and immediately smiled upon seeing the name on the screen.
Steve stood in the middle of the sidewalk, feeling horribly confused. He stared at the store on the other side of the street and then at the small piece of paper in his hands. He’d confirmed the address a thousand times already and he was definitely at the right place. He’d been expecting some sort of hospital or fancy lab. He definitely hadn’t expected an antiques store. Still feeling slightly confused, Steve crossed the street.
She also taught him how to stand up for himself and, of course, how to throw a proper punch, a lesson that had gotten both of them in a lot of trouble when Tony came back from school with a purple eye and a proud smile and an exasperated Jarvis right behind him, waving a paper in which she could swear she read the word
So Steve pulled the nearest chair closer and sat down, his hands still touching Tony’s stomach as he began to sing the very same song his mother used to sing to him when he was a baby. As he sang, his mind started to wonder… He pictured Tony and himself lying down in a big bed, a beautiful little girl asleep between them. He could picture her curly brown hair covering the white sheets and her chocolate brown eyes, so similar to Tony’s, slowly closing as they sang to her, together.
“The one who ran like he just ate three burritos with extra spices and suddenly found himself in desperate need of a bathroom due to some explosive diarrhea”.
The hospital didn’t keep Steve for much longer. He stayed one more night in “observation” and left the next morning. The former Captain of the Howling Commandos was very happy to be returning home and acted as if nothing had happened. It bothered Bucky that his best friend seemed completely unaffected by the terrible situation they were in, but he tried to reason with himself. Steve had no reason to feel bad about it. He remembered his entire life. Everything and everyone, except for Tony. How could he miss something he didn’t remember? And why would he suffer over such a tiny detail that made no difference in his life?
First of all, it is a CRIME that Jessica Jones got cancelled. Second of all, I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter. Story is coming to an end soon, and I have a few things planned, I hope you'll all like it! <3 Remember to leave a comment!!
“And if that Harry Potter knockoff is wrong, well then, we’ll probably be dead or mind controlled. Both are equally bad in my book”, Clint replied with a shudder.
Everyone turned to glare at him before turning their attention back to the clanking noise ahead. The sounds were somewhat weird, like a big old rusty machine, the gang thought as they inched closer to its origin. Suddenly, they saw a clearing a few feet down from where they were, much like the one they had found themselves earlier upon waking up in this strange world. Down there, scattered on the grass, were big cages with all sorts of animals inside, with goblins patrolling the place, carrying small swords and bows.
“I have some work to get done. Otherwise Pepper is going to have my head”, Tony said with a humorless laugh.
“Tony”, Steve said firmly, holding the smaller man by the shoulders, “If you want to run, I won’t stop you. We’ll run together. We’ll go to London, Paris, even freaking Siberia if that’s what it takes. But I need you to listen to me… You don’t have to run anymore, Tony, because I’ll protect you. I’ll fight whoever I need to, I promise you, and I’ll rip them apart if I have to. I will never let him hurt you again, Tony. I
“Come on, punk, we’re not gonna do that, okay? I promise. Nat and I will be on our best behavior”, he promised, crossing his heart, “So will Sam, Clint and Coulson”, he whispered right after.
” written in bright yellow letters) and a pair of dark blue jeans. He noticed the way Tony looked at him and smiled to himself.
“I know it’s too much to ask and you’ve already stayed here pretty much the whole day, but will you stay with us?” Tony asked in a shy, low tone.
Steve had agreed with a nod and shared a look with Bucky, who had clearly noticed the omission of information and decided to trust that the blonde knew exactly what he was doing. They were almost home when Steve’s phone rang.
By the time Steve finally arrived at SHIELD, it was almost lunch time since the promised half hour and shower had somehow turned into three hours of pure bliss for both parties. Hill was waiting for him by the door, looking ready to murder someone. He looked at her sheepishly.
Tony turned around and almost slammed into a small, blond man. He was definitely standing out, with his old looking shirt and pants and glasses so big they covered half his face.
Tony was eleven years old when he was kidnapped for the first time. He’d been waiting for Jarvis right outside school. The butler was late, which was very unusual. When the car finally arrived, the boy got in without a second thought, throwing his Superman backpack on the car seat. He was about to ask Jarvis why he was late when he finally noticed the driver was not, in fact, his butler. By then, it was already too late. Hands suddenly grabbed and pulled him to the side, just as the door closed, and his nose and mouth were quickly covered. He tried to scream, to set himself free, but he knew it was in vain. No one could hear him. He felt a prick on his neck and soon his eyes were too heavy to be open any longer and he fell unconscious. He spent ten days in captivity. Those were the worst days of his life. He was kept in a small, dark room, with a barred window that barely allowed any sunlight inside. They’d bring him food (usually a piece of bread) and water occasionally.
He turned and walked as fast as he could to the elevator. He heard Clint and Natasha calling for him, but he ignored them. As soon as he got inside the elevator, FRIDAY ― thank God for his beautiful, amazing AI ―  closed the doors. But not before he saw Steve’s face, full of regret.
The little man laughed. “Solohob? A bagman. A front. Your outdated information betrays you. Now, you will tell Lermentov that we will no longer require his services and… Well”, he said, taking a pair of pliers from the table nearby, “you might have to write it down”.
partner ― sometime, but right now the wound was still bleeding. He needed time. He would get over Steve, of course he would, but not now. Not right now. He was distracted by his thoughts that he yelped in surprise when he felt a hand on his waist, pulling in into a strong chest.
“She doesn’t want to hurt us. We didn’t know. So we just need to stay here until it’s over”, a man said, sitting back down and turning his eyes back to the front of the room.
I hope you like this chapter, let me know what you think!! More comments means I'm more determined to get on writing the next chapter sooner!!
“I… I know I hurt you. Bad. And I’m so sorry. I’ll never forgive myself for causing you so much pain, Tony, really. You were right. The problem was me. Deep down, I knew my ma wouldn’t care if I was gay. And I know Bucky and the others wouldn’t care either. I just… I don’t know, I had this idea in my head that it was different with me, you know. That it was okay for Clint to be gay, but if they found out I was? They would hate me. I don’t know why I thought that, but I did”.
Tony smiled again. “I guess we’ll see about that. You ever come here, or anywhere near me, again and I’ll have you arrested for harassment. Have a good day, Obie… You know, while you can”.
“Ok, I’m out, you deal with his, bye”, Bucky said in a hurry, taking his water bottle, his jacket and his backpack and literally running as far away as he could from the fountain where Steve and he had been sitting.
. It was a lesson the man had learned the hard way, after using his key and walking in on a very naked Steve fucking Tony against the couch. Needless to say, Bucky refused to eat in the living room any longer.
“There was a very good chance you’d never remember. I just wanted you to be happy”, Tony explained, his eyes filling with tears, “Even if it wasn’t with me”.
“And now Steve is in a hospital bed after passing out in the middle of said party and we have no idea what happened to him?”
“Tony, let me explain to you how this family works”, Bucky started to say, earning some very surprised looks from everyone else, Tony included, “We don’t do the ‘every man for himself’ kind of thing. We’re more of a ‘three musketeers’ kind of gang. So when I say we’re gonna help you, what I actually mean is ‘we’re not only going to protect your ass with our lives, but we’re also gonna kill anyone and anything that tries to hurt you’. You got that?”
Some things will be explained in the next chapters, at least I hope so lol Comments make me happy, so leave me some so I'll know people are still reading this and let me know what you think!!
“Figures not even a traumatic experience would shut you up, Tones”, Rhodey joked before kissing his best friend’s forehead and lying his own head on top of Tony’s, “Don’t ever do that to me again, okay?”
A hologram suddenly appeared in front of them. A picture. The man had blond hair and big glasses covering half his face. Tony felt all the air leave his lungs at once, as it became harder to breathe.
“It’s not that. It’s just… my old life, the one I ran from. It’s too complicated and I don’t want to drag Steve into it”.
“I believe that you believe that you saw her walking”, he replied, smiling at the little girl when she held his face with both hands, babbling something intelligible.
She checked her phone, opening the digital file Romanov had sent her a few days before. Obadiah Stane: an excellent chess player, top of his class, Business major. Father was a degenerate gambler, accidentally shot himself in front of his son while playing Russian roulette. Some people might say the trauma of watching his father get his head blown off made Stane the vile, cruel man he was today. Jessica thought that was bullshit. Trauma changes people, sure, she was living proof of that. But she was goddamn tired of these assholes using that to justify their shitty behavior.
“Fine, have brunch with him, but if you kiss my boyfriend, Rogers, I promise you I’ll rip off your balls”.
Inside, there was a man. He had his head on his hands and didn't look up, not even when Natasha sat in front of him. She remained silent, merely watching him with no expression.
Steve hadn’t lived here in quite a while, a year to be exact, but for some reason Bucky couldn’t fathom the place looked well lived in. There were portraits everywhere ― Steve and Bucky at the METs game; Natasha, Steve and Sam playing videogames; Steve and Thor singing karaoke ―, not to mention the plates drying beside the sink and the pillows on the floor in the middle of the leaving room.
Steve fought the urge to smile and tried not to turn his head to follow Tony’s figure disappearing through the main door. It wouldn’t do for Director Carter to catch him checking her godson’s ass out, no matter how good an ass it was. He liked living too much to risk it.
“It’s Walmart”, Steve said calmly, shrugging, “I just saw a woman wearing her panties on the outside”.
I'm guessing I won't get my computer back and working any time soon so I'm using my tablet and a shitty tiny keyboard to write, which means smaller chapters. I hope you guys don't mind.
“Yeah, you’re going to need a lot more to convince me this was a good plan”, Tony replied, rolling his eyes.
The Oxventure is the D&D adventure the channels Outside Xbox and Outside Xtra have with the guiding of their DM, Johnny! It's super funny and you should definitely watch it!!
“I’m pretty sure it’s from the 70s. It belongs to a friend of mine, he’s traveling so he asked me to take it back to my house. You know, keep it safe”.
Strong arms engulfed him all of a sudden and he let himself melt, closing his eyes and just enjoying the heat that seemed to emanate from Steve.
“No, but it’s perfect. Steve is very possessive. When he was sweet on Peggy Carter, he heard Howard mention
Steve whimpered and moved his torso forward, both hands going for the edge of the counter, holding it as if his life depended on it. He had his eyes closed and his mouth was slightly open as he tried to breath. Tony smirked when he heard his lover’s whimpers and continued to work, taking Steve’s hard cock until it almost hit the back of his throat before pulling back slowly, sucking and circling the head with his tongue. He did it again and again and again, moaning once in a while, knowing the vibrations drove his lover even more crazy than normal. He felt Steve’s hand on his hair and knew the man was about to come; with a final moan, he took all of Steve’s length as he came hard into his mouth. He swallowed all of it and let his now flaccid cock go, giving it a long lick before getting up. Steve quickly pulled him closer, kissing him, tasting his own come in Tony’s tongue.
He smiled as he watched his husband and son laughing. Steve had Peter in his arms and was throwing him up only to catch him right after, making him scream in delight.
“Jerk”, Steve replied softly under his breath, turning all his concentration back to the papers in front of him and trying not to lose himself on thoughts of Tony. Friday night couldn’t come fast enough.
Tony rolled his eyes and followed Steve to the kitchen, sitting down on the tall stool. He watched the other man taking pans and cups from the cabinets as if he’d been living there for years, completely comfortable in Tony’s kitchen. The loud noise of yet another thunder filled the room once more, making the engineer wince.
“Hey”, Jessica called, transferring the files to her cell phone just as the waitress came closer, “Can you put all of this in a bag or something?”
“So, they joined this crazy experiment, died because of it and Ross lied to their families and friends about what happened?” Steve asked in an angry tone.
“Quit messing with your shit, it looks fine”, Bucky complained, slapping Steve’s hand away for the third time.
“I know that”, Tony replied with a sigh, sitting down next to Steve, “I know that. But it won’t matter because people like that, people with money, with power, they don’t give a fuck about that, Steve. They want to keep the status quo and they will do anything to keep themselves in power. Trust me, I grew up in this world, I know what I’m talking about”.
“Yes. It’s just a dumb robot. We’ve tried shutting it down or dismantling it for parts, but it gets aggressive every time someone gets close”, Stane explained, taking a sip from his glass, “I’m actually surprised he’s letting you touch him”.
Steve snorted and then, unable to hold himself any longer, he threw his head back, holding his stomach as he laughed out loud.
“The company would’ve reported them”, Tony completed, turning his eyes back at the photos in his hand.
“Knock knock”, a soft voice came from the door. Steve recognized the voice immediately. He knew he was behaving like a child, ignoring Bucky like that, but he couldn’t help it. He was just too angry to have a proper conversation with his best friend.
But he never finished. Tony winced when he heard the shot, thinking maybe Obadiah had finally grown tired of the whole conversation and decided to kill him right there and then, but then he remembered… He hadn’t seen a gun on his hand before. Obie took a step back and looked confused, raising his hand and putting it on his chest, where the blood began to stain his white shirt. He fell to his knees and took one last look at Tony before crumbling down on the floor. Tony watched, horrified, as he coughed and gasped for air. The shooter still had his gun pointed at Stane. He walked slowly towards him and Tony with a determined expression on his face.
“Oh, no, I’ll kill you either way. If you don’t give me the code, I’ll make a quick call to my guy, same one who killed your parents for me, and have him shoot your precious little boyfriend right between the eyes”, Stane said calmly.
Suddenly, all Steve’s blood seemed to go south in a hurry. He adjusted his legs to hide his half hard dick while trying not to picture Tony… Tony in his big bed, lying down, naked, slowly stroking himself…
, he thought to himself, his tongue tracing his on lips as if to savor the taste of Steve’s mouth on his,
“Yeah, no problem. I mean, you did have ice cream…” Steve joked, but suddenly stopped when he noticed Tony wince in pain, “Is something wrong?”
There were some good restaurants around, and she did have the money ― an exorbitant amount, in fact ― that Romanov had deposited on her bank account. Still, she ended up on a small, almost empty diner, doing research on Ivan Vanko over some waffles and bacon. A quick Google search told her some things about her new target: born in Russia, immigrated to the US when he was five years old and… a smart cookie too, graduated top of his class, a skilled physicist.
Natasha just threw him an unimpressed look before returning her attention to the phone, “Look, you can’t pull us out from this right now”.
“Trust me, Jessica can hold one hell of a grudge. Tell her I sent you her way”, he replied, closing his suitcase, “Best of all, you can trust her”.
Tony was sitting on his sofa, fully dressed and ready for his date. He was staring at the big bouquet of flowers and the box of Swiss chocolate, which cost more than his rent and he knew that because he had googled it and had almost fallen from his chair when he saw the price. But they were good. God, they were really good. He’d had one right after the very grumpy driver had delivered them and they simply melted in his mouth, the perfect combination of sweet and bitter. He’d eaten half the box already.
“Good. Romanoff is an excellent spy and I have a job that she would perfect for. You three, however, will have a different mission. I believe that whoever made an attempt on my godson’s life will most likely try again. He must be watched carefully. However, knowing Anthony as I do, he will outright refuse a bodyguard”, she explained, and then smiled at the Captain, “Tell me, Rogers, have you ever gone to college?”
“We need to get married. Coulson can say he’s ordained and he can marry us and it will be all fake so it’s no problem and we pretend were married for a few months and then break up”.
Tony had paid for Nat, Bucky, Sam, Clint and Steve to stay at the hotel that night, so they wouldn’t have to go back home only to return some hours later for the actual wedding. They were all in Steve’s room, drinking and chatting, when the blonde finally walked in, looking more terrified than he ever had before.
They turned around and saw Steve, Coulson, Pepper and a bunch of agents running towards them. Tony felt Natasha taking the gun from his hands as he stood there, staring at his boyfriend. He wanted to move, to run to Steve, but he found that he couldn’t move.
“Steve, I was kidnapped by a terrorist organization, waterboarded, tortured, starved… And I lived. I shouldn’t be alive unless it was for a reason. I didn’t always know what to do, you know. All I ever knew is that I’m good at creating things, making things, and I thought I could use that to make a better world. And even when my dad made me design weapons, I thought I was doing some good, you know? Saving some people, protecting people like Rhodey”.
Sometimes, during his downward spiral, he had brief moments of lucidity when his brain would actually function properly.
The old lady nodded, seeming satisfied enough. She walked to the counter and stood there for a second. She must have pressed a button or something, because Steve immediately heard a buzzing noise. The blond looked around, confused, until the lady gestured to the door behind her. Steve walked shyly through it and found himself in a smaller room filled with a huge bookcase. He looked around, confused as to what he was supposed to do, when the bookcase simply opened like a door, revealing a huge space that looked an awful lot like an army base.
“Ok, let’s get this party started, people!”, Harley said, watching the bear chase the goblins from a distance, before sliding down the small hill towards the mess. Ned and Cassie soon followed, while Michele, emitting a very faint red glow, floated down after them.
“This is not very sexy”, he said in a sad tone, throwing his head back, “It’s like trying to fuck Moby Dick”.
“Let’s move to the next building. Whatever happened, we need to neutralize the target before anyone else gets hurt”.
DUM-E started to turn around on himself, searching for the source of the voice, unaware that the voice was coming from his own sound box.
“I’m on my way, my dear. I’ll be there as soon as possible, you hear me? You stay in your room, alright?”
"I'm going to the cafeteria. Don't eat my Harry Potter beans", she warned, using said card to open the door.
Everyone – except Tony and Steve, who were still gazing longingly into each other’s eyes – turned to glare at Barton, who looked affronted.
“Yes, Clint, we heard, we’re right here”, Natasha replied, rolling her eyes. She turned to Steve, “How are you going to do it?”
“Yeah, well, so is creating a new identity, so I guess we’re even”, Bucky replied and immediately shook his head, regretting his words, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I’m just defensive. I really am sorry about the whole FBI thing. But I had to make sure you weren’t just trying to hurt Stevie”.
“Oh, no, wasn’t in the lab, cap”, Clint replied with a knowing smile, “It’s just, you know, some problems are just
He looked at her with a disbelieving look on his face. “And who’s going to put me in front of a judge, Miss Jones? You?”
The two men exchanged a quick look of disbelief before turning their attentions back to the animated corpse in front of them. There was a
Tony, on the other hand, was anything but calm. In fact, he was terrified. He couldn’t tell them the truth because, if he did, he’d have to explain a lot of things from his past that he was definitely not comfortable talking yet. Or, even worse, they could turn on him and tell Obie where he was, which would be a complete disaster. He took a deep breath, trying to come up with a plausible lie.
from Howard himself. Margaret, however, heard none of it, too enthralled by the baby in her arms to pay attention to anything else.
She came across a room right across what she assumed was Vanko’s bedroom.  Jessica walked inside, flashing light everywhere. There were books scattered around on the floor and pieces of machinery everywhere, including on a big table by the corner that seemed to be a makeshift workshop. She looked around for a while and sighed when she found nothing of interest. It’s not like she was expecting to find some damning evidence right away, but a clue would be appreciated. She checked his bedroom next, where the only weird thing she noticed was the suspicious lack of clothes in the wardrobe; the bathroom, nothing but a few cockroaches and a very unsanitary towel on the floor; the living room, a mess of pizza boxes and Chinese food containers, but absolutely nothing of interest. Her last hope was the basement.
Tony stood right outside the front door of his family’s mansion. He opened it slowly and watched, almost hypnotized, as the door softly bounced at the wall. The noise echoed throughout the empty room and it seemed to get louder and louder inside Tony’s head. He was very aware that Steve and Bucky were right behind him, patiently waiting for him to move. With a deep sigh, he finally managed to summon up enough courage to step inside the place that had given him so many nightmares.
“That’s flattering. But, yeah, I wasn’t always like this. I met someone on my twenties and she was my first love. We didn’t work out and after her I just never really cared much about dating”.
They watched, confused and horrified, as the soldiers, one by one, started killing themselves. A knife through the eye, a bullet in the head. Some turned their own guns against themselves, others simply dropped their weapons and started hitting their heads on the walls as hard as they could.
“They’re probably finishing practice”, Nat replied, slapping the blonde’s hand away and licking her own cake, as if to ensure no one would try to take it. Sharon pouted. “Bucky said Coach Phillips is really working them to the ground”.
Natasha turned off the computer screen, paying no mind to the indigant shout coming from Clint's direction.
“Just not much for drinking in general, Mr. Stane”, he replied, trying very hard to sound polite, “Now, the purpose of this meeting?”
Tony scooted over so Steve would have more room. He happily took the place offered, getting even closer to the other man.
“Oh, I wouldn’t miss it for the world, you clueless, stupid giant”, he said with a  smirk, “what’s his girl’s name?”
The next morning came and there was still no message from Tony. Steve tried to respect his obvious wishes to be left alone, but when lunch time was approaching and there was still no text or call, he started to get antsy. Clint assured him that everything was fine, that Tony hadn’t left his house nor anyone had come over since yesterday, but still… He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Finally, he decided that enough was enough and called Clint, saying he was on his way to relieve him for the day.
talk, or something along these lines, so the sudden accusation that he was an imposter felt like a punch to the stomach. Because it was true. He was, technically, an imposter. He was lying about his name and hiding a whole lot of other things from Steve. And, at that moment, it was like his brain lit up.
―, and he took a relieved breath when all the man took out of the bag were small pieces of paper. Photos, as he discovered when Dr. Beesly gave them to him.
“Shit. Okay. Please, don’t tell Stevie I’m telling you this because this is something you two should talk about yourselves later, but I’m gonna give you the short version”, he said with a sigh, sitting down on a stool nearby, “Stevie started the company after we came back. We started small and then suddenly we were the biggest thing in the security business. That’s when he met Ophelia. She was beautiful, charismatic and supposedly super in love with Stevie. She was the perfect woman. She fooled all of us. Turns out she was a spy for HYDRA Corp. Stevie spent months giving her everything she wanted, clothes, perfumes, even a goddamn car, and she was tricking him the entire time. Nearly broke him when he found out. So yeah, you could say I’m a little overprotective”.
Steve leaned in, putting his ear into the open space. He could hear voices down below, and concentrated to pick them up. After a minute of listening, he looked up at Sam and Natasha.
The cold refused to leave him. It followed him down to Ottawa, where they interrupted an attack on the Prime Minister. It snuck up on him in Prague, after they’ve hacked their way through a terror cell. It held on for dear life in Milan, forcing him into hoodies and long sleeve shirts that definitely didn’t blend well in the city’s fashionable streets.
Well, there was one thing, though it only worked half the time. After a moment’s hesitation, Tony decided to roll the dice and stumbled into the kitchen. He hesitantly opened one of the cabinets, eyes flickering over each bottle until he found the one he had been looking for. His eyes darkened at the sticky note covered in Natasha’s illegible handwriting that was tacked to the bottle. He grabbed the alcohol with unneeded force, aggressively crumbling the note. Nat had made her choice, and if she wasn’t here for him to yell at, in hopes of soothing the fiery need for revenge in his chest, stealing her expensive, blacklisted in the USA, 48% alcohol content vodka would have to do.
They pulled up to a nondescript building a few minutes later, the car gliding to a stop and parking itself. Steve pulled his helmet out of his bag, slipping the black reinforced fabric over his head. It was different from his Cap helmet, this one designed more for stealth than protection. It had a chin strap and a mask, as well as lenses that blocked out Steve’s eyes and enhanced his sight even further with a blink. Natasha tied her hair back, elbowing Sam to wake him up. He rose with a start, clearing his throat and getting ready himself.
Steve’s spine straightened, and he stared blankly at the wall in front of him. A soft hand fell on his shoulder, and his entire body flinched away from it.
“Man, you really are just a giant puppy. One good scratch and you’re melting into the floor,” said Sam, laughing in earnest this time.
Panting, Steve looked down at the object at his feet. A blinking red light told Steve all he needed to know.
“You really don’t want to do that,” Steve warned them, a strange rush flooding his blood. Sure, he got adrenaline rushes before battle, they all did, but this was different. Any trace of fear vanished, a cruel brutality taking its place. “We can handle this peacefully.”
Twenty minutes later, Sam, Natasha and Steve rode in silence in one of Shuri’s self driving cars, the only noise the purr of the car’s motor. Natasha sat in the driver’s seat, hands gripping the steering wheel to mimic driving, with Steve beside her, duffel bag pressed to his chest. Sam had griped about being put in the back, but after discovering how to convert the backseats into a semi-comfortable bed, he’d shut up and passed out.
“Stop glaring at your zharkoe, you overgrown retriever.” Rising from the table, she took Steve’s head in her hands, pulling his face from where it had been hunched over his bowl. He grunted, and Sam stifled a laugh, earning him a glare from Steve. She ran her hands through his hair, tossing it this way and that in inspection. “I was thinking brown. A medium brown or chocolate would distract from the All American shtick, but still work with your colouring,” she hummed, scratching his scalp with her fingernails. Steve melted a little, tension easing from his shoulders. His whole body shuddered, warmth washing over him from head to toe.
“Extraction in five,” crackled his comm. Natasha’s voice snapped him back to the present, and the rush of awareness was almost painful. Shuri had made his shields after he’d left his old one in the bunker and he hadn't seen Tony in...well. Probably best not to think of that now.
He screwed his eyes shut, picturing Steve’s large, pastel covered hands affectionately cupping Tony’s cheek. Hands that had once been gentle and caring…hands that had curled into a fist and shattered his heart.
Steve was getting eaten alive with worry about Tony. Although his texts seemed playful and teasing, they were superficial. His worry increased even more at any mention of alcohol, recalling the man’s past troubles with substance abuse. Knowing that he was most definitely the cause of the relapse felt like a blow to the gut. Steve had hurt Tony, and he wanted to apologize, but he just didn’t know how without making things worse or remembering the look of complete betrayal on Tony’s face.
“Hey, Steve? We’re about to have dinner, if you’re hungry,” said Sam, his hand posed on the doorway.
Rhodey gave him a look that clearly said he wasn’t buying it, and Tony had to turn around to avoid his best friend’s insistent gaze, insides squirming with guilt.
“Sorry. I just forgot,” he mumbled, finally pouring himself a cup of coffee. “I won’t forget anymore.”
That night, Steve fell asleep to the sounds of Sam’s soft snoring from the room beside his, the phone pressed tightly to his chest and tears drying on his cheeks.
“There’s no time,” Steve replied, running as fast he could towards the forest a few kilometers from the building, his leg screaming with every step he took. “It’s one of Giorelli’s.”
Steve kicked him in the shin, smiling when he heard Sam double over, cursing. He opened his eyes when Natasha’s fingers left his hair and watched as he swatted at him. “Quit teasing him,” she ordered. “He’s been through a lot,” she continued, a bit quieter this time.
Steve’s chest felt hollow, and he rubbed her knuckles across his sternum absently, hunching over slightly. He knew he should get up and help. He should listen to...Natasha, yes that was it. Years of army training screamed at him to get moving, but he felt encased in ice, unable to move.
Ok so as I mentioned, if you're keeping up to date with this story as it's being published, you'll notice that our last update was oh...in May. We're so sorry about this, and we're going to try our very hardest to give you the conclusion we've planned ASAP. Thank you all so much for sticking through; I can't begin to tell you how much we appreciate all the kudos and the comments. Feel free to subscribe or bookmark this fic so you don't miss the last two chapters when they finally come out. Peace and love!
“Yes,” Natasha confirmed. “We’re on our way to the base now. I’ve got the bug Shuri sent, so you’ll get the info you need for a conviction. Why, is there anything else we need to know?”
“Jesus Mary and Joseph, remind me to never do that again. You pack a punch, Steve, holy hell. Wouldn’t want to be on the receiving-”
His face felt wet. Whether it was from tears or blood from the blow to his head back in the bunker, he couldn’t say, nor did he particularly care at that moment because everything HURT. Tony threw the bottle away from him, the glass ricocheting off the wall, letting out a splintering noise that did nothing to appease his racing heart. He clawed at his throat, feeling as trapped as he had all those years ago in the middle of space.
“On it,” came the reply. Steve kicked Giorelli’s kneecaps, leaving the man to wriggle in pain on the floor. He turned to survey the fight behind him, but was met instead with a familiar face.
He glared half-heartedly at Pepper, cursing under his breath, which she resolutely ignored. Pepper grabbed her bag, sliding the StarkPad inside, and looked back up at Tony and Rhodey.
Steve fiddled with his thumbs, trying not to flinch under Nat’s piercing gaze. Sam had left the two alone, claiming that he was going out to go get some air. Natasha hadn’t stopped Sam to caution him about the dangers of getting caught, which told Steve that he was in
Steve shoved the duffle bag as far under his seat as it would go. He looked at it for a few seconds, collecting himself with his head between his knees. When he rose again, Sam was fiddling his gloves and Natasha was plucking short blonde hairs from her pants, but obviously trying not to look at him.
“My men will be in contact soon,” replied the buyer. Steve gestured to Sam and Natasha, who had hooked themselves to harnesses so that they could safely drop down and ambush their targets. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw Natasha eyeing his lack of harness pointedly, but he ignored her. He’d jumped down from higher spots without breaking anything. It’d be fine.
“I’m gonna have to stop you right there, spiderling,” Tony replied, raising a hand in protest. “You’ve got nothing to be sorry about. I just had one too many cups of coffee and not enough sleep.” With a sigh, Tony gave Peter a smile, making shooing motions with his hands. “Run along now, or your ridiculously hot, somewhat scary aunt is gonna kill me for keeping you here too long.”
“Captain Rogers. Agent Romanov. I hope you’re both doing well,” he greeted. Steve nodded, and Natasha gave the king a small smile.
With a sigh, he walked back into his bedroom, falling onto his bed. He buried his face in his pillow, hoping that sleep would come easily tonight. His prayers were answered for once, and Steve felt himself drifting off peacefully, no thoughts of Tony or Siberia to be found.
Tony woke up abruptly, tear tracks drying uncomfortably on his face. He sat up in his bed, eyes doing their best to adjust to the darkness around him. He could still feel the ghost of Steve’s warm hands on his cheeks. His eyes burned with fresh tears and his throat felt dry, his heart pounding in his chest. Shifting slightly, he reached beneath his pillow and grabbed the small device that hid there. With a deep breath, Tony turned on the phone, his face lighting up from the blue-white glow of the screen. His fingers shook and he wiped his sweaty palms on his covers before gathering up his courage.
with you, Steve?” she exclaimed. “Where was your head today? You almost let a handful of guards get a decent shot on you, then you zoned out during the interrogation, and if Sam hadn’t stopped him, Dukowitz, the man we’ve spent the last two weeks tracking down, would’ve swallowed an arsenic pill before we could get any information out of him. And it’s not just today! It was the museum, the parking lot...hell, even at dinner you’re somewhere else!” Steve risked a glance, and his muscles clenched at the look of fury in Nat’s eyes.
“Nat!” Steve cried, stumbling towards the first cropping of trees. Pine needles brushed his shoulders, and the beeping sped up, growing more and more urgent. “Please, you need to get as far as you can.”
Funny how it seemed like yesterday that it had been Steve holding him on the roof, swaying to the beating of their two hearts as the music of the night enveloped them, the whispers of empty promises taking to the wind.
And before he knew it, Tony was laughing hysterically, pain and alcohol making his brain all fuzzy. He craved Steve like an addict craved a substance. Despite all the bad and all the hurt Steve had inflicted, Tony needed the blue-eyed Avenger. Tony missed his calloused hands, with fingertips always smeared in some sort of charcoal or paint. He missed those same fingers in his hair during team movie nights. His heart ached to hear the gentle playfulness in Steve’s tone and see the soft pink tinge that would colour his cheeks when Tony said something mildly immature. He wanted to see Steve light up the whole room with his smile, see the way Steve’s blue eyes glowed with passion and righteousness.
He wasn’t whole anymore, and he knew that. Steve hadn’t been whole since he’d watched Bucky fall from the train, all those years ago. But then Tony had come along, sanding down his rough edges and filling the chinks in his armour that Steve had kept hidden for so long with love and joy. But now, with Tony gone, he felt worse than ever before. He felt like he was still trapped under the ice, conscious enough to watch his world crumble around him. He felt like he had nothing left to live for.
“Well. They certainly didn’t advertise that on your posters,” he said, and when his eyes met Steve’s, they were just as lifeless as the suit’s. They were unforgiving. “You should have told me.”
Without warning, Steve’s eyes darkened into the inscrutable look Steve had worn on his face as he’d sunk his shield one last time into Tony’s chest. And so Tony laughed (or perhaps he was crying, he wasn’t quite sure) whilst Rhodey held him on the roof.
Two warm arms folded themselves around him, tugging him to the ground. It felt so nice. It had been a while since he was last held. The sudden embrace was a bit startling, and in the back of his mind, Tony knew he should be worried about security threats or something. Were they going to hurt him? Tony didn’t know whether to push away or lean in. His foggy brain sighed, throwing in the towel and embracing the hold.
She gestured angrily with the gun as she spoke, and Steve eyed her movements, searching for an opening. “Not to mention how much money you just cost me. It was bad enough that you just carted off the best weapons dealer on this side of the continent, but then your friends had to go and plow through my bodyguards like that. Good help is hard to find, you know!” she exclaimed, pressing her palm against the forehead of her smooth mask.
