Clint sits in the common area with the rest of the team, listening to Dylan's past. He's been texting Laura, his ex-wife, constantly since he found out that Dylan was their daughter.
"We are gathered here today," Thor starts, "to join Steven Grant Rogers and Anthony Edward Stark in holy matrimony."
I nod putting the gun down, "What about Bucky," I whisper back grabbing his shirt off of the floor beside me pulling it on before I get out of bed.
“Avery, what are you doing here,” Tony asks as he steps out of the car, “Happy, you gotta watch where you put things.”
I ended up in London to get away from everything and to try and forget the man I thought I saw in New York. I was living there for a year when Thor showed up fighting the Dark Elves, when the fight was over I looked for him and found him with Dr. Foster.
Bucky is taking care of Laura, while Dylan is gone. This is the longest he's been with Laura since he found out she is his daughter.
"Well, you'll be joining us at the new Avengers headquarter. Hopefully, you'll be able to join our medical staff, if not it'll be a safe place for you and your daughter," Tony said as he typed something into his phone.
"No," I say and open the door walking out of the cell and going back upstairs to the living quarters.
“Or she could just come and work here for us,” Tony says, “that way she can stay in a safe place and train to fight better.”
"Whatever happened hurt you didn't it," he asks, I nod in reply, "Then why bring him back, if it hurts that much, why bring him back?"
Before I can answer, Pietro is back and out of breath. I sit him down and wait for him to gather his thoughts and tell us what he found.
She watches as Loki removes a dagger from a hidden spot on his person and lunge at her father, falling onto the ground when he passes through the holographic figure.
"Y-you want to thank me," he asks confused as I start to aim and shoot, "why? I mean, what I did was horrible."
"Okay, it might take a minute for me to find it," she says moving the censor around. We sit there quietly waiting for the heartbeat, until,
"It's going to be a long flight," Steve says taking the pilot seat, "Loki and Wanda I need you two to rest as it will be a long day when we get there."
"He's worse then Pietro," Bucky says from our spot on the couch, causing the whole room to burst out laughing expect for Pietro and Dad.
“I can’t help you if I don’t see your injuries,” she says, “your secret is safe with me. I’ll tell you one of mine first it that helps.”
Until tonight. A cold winter night Avery and her new partner were walking to her small apartment in Queens after a double date with Steve and Tony. They were consumed by how enjoyable the evening was they didn’t sense the pair of eyes following them from when they turned onto her street until they reached the steps leading up to her building.
"Clint, calm done," Pietro says from his seat on our bed, "She did this because of love, I know you would do the same thing if that was me on that table."
“I know,” he says, “but you have to start getting over him, I mean look how long it took me to get over your father and then when I finally start to feel happy in a new relationship he shows up very much alive. I mean it’s better to find happiness sooner rather than later Andrea out on so much.”
“I’m going to stay here for a bit, help out in whatever way I can,” she says, “then probably Berlin.”
"Lila of Asgard, first born twin to an Asgardian thus fulfilling the prophecy passed down to us by the first beings in the universe," Lily says, "now move!"
I smile at my daughter who's still in my arms as Pietro lets go of me and walks away slowly as Bucky walks up.
Lily takes the tablet and reads the message, writing down the translation of it almost instantaneously. She hands back the tablet and the translation.
"It was either hand it over or watch our people die," Loki says, "but that's not what we're talking about right now. Right now, we're talking about why Lila won't tell these mortals about the Soul Stone that's keeping her alive!"
"Yes, yes I am. Most people don't notice them right away. I'm 80% deaf," he says turning to face me again.
I turn towards him, realizing that Clint just discovered something about himself. I grin slightly seeing the look of relief on his face that I felt many times on my own when I was holding Laura.
We stand there in silence for a while. Pietro paces while holding Ras with a worried look on his face. I see Laura trying to calm herself to keep control of her powers. I collapse to the floor thinking of what my last conversation was with my Dad, with Wanda, with Bucky. I'm about to speak up when an alarm goes off on the jet.
I look around my cell, it's been weeks since Jiaying sold me to Hydra for information about her daughter. I wait patiently for instructions, or a mission, or anything really. As stand to walk around and stretch my legs when the door unlocks. I stand there staring at this man as the door closes and locks behind him.
"Well it's a long story that I don't want to explain," Lily says, "and it has a lot of different branches."
“Avery, you’re the only person I trust left in the city,” he says, “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t absolutely need you.”
"Fine," she says, begrudgingly, "it's not like there's some mercenary on the loose looking for Infinity Stones or anything."
I stand there and watch Pietro wrap his arms around my Dads waist, the love in their eyes at this very moment.
"Baby girl, is that yo-AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH," I fall onto the floor next to her as the pain in my head grows into the worst it's been ever.
I watch as he stands up and turns to Clint. I notice the look on his face, it's the same one Momma had when we got kidnapped.
"If I come in promise me you will stop calling me stupid," Dylan says from the doorway. I nod and she walks in.
We follow behind walking towards a row of jeeps. Wanda, Loki, and myself climb into one, I hold Ras on my lap as we start to drive towards the facility. I look everywhere but towards Loki, once we park everyone exits their jeeps and walk into the building.
"Honestly Buck, I hate how easy it is for you to read me," Steve replies, "Okay, well since there is so much talk of babies and children, I thought it might be a good time to tell everyone that Tony and I are adopting a little boy tomorrow."
"Normally, you hear Tony ask Jarvis to make the room sound proof," Natasha says after we all sit down, "That's when you know they're about to get it on, today he didn't."
"She is in love with that man and you force her to marry you to save him," Thor speaks softly now, "I know you care for the girl, I know how often you asked Heimdall to keep an eye on her but she does not share the same affection."
"I'm not wanted here," I say coldly as I feel tears forming in the corner of my eyes, "I don't want to stay some place I'm not wanted."
Clint comes back from his day with Dylan and Laura with some new information. He's gay and all Pietro can talk about.
"No, it's not nothing," I say turning his seat around so he's facing me, "I meant what I said, I do love you. I just shouldn't have said in that moment, I wanted the right moment to say it because you mean that much to me and I wanted the moment to match that."
“Hey, it’s me, Avery. I was just calling to say that I saw your shadow tonight and needed to hear your voice and feel like I am talking to you,” Avery says, as she paces through her apartment.
"Dylan, it's fine," he says smiling down at me, "You're this way because we lost our daughter at my hands and because you're around a month pregnant but now we have a chance to raise this baby," placing his hands on my stomach, "together. This time I will take a bullet for them before I'd let anyone hurt our baby."
"Fine, if you must go," Odin says, "then you must have a guard escort you. You are about to become my daughter."
“But that apartment is my home, it’s where we had our first date,” she says, “it’s where we spent our first night together, it has so many memories and milestones of our relationship and you just want me to up and move?”
I walk into the kitchen looking for Pietro, he's not here. I've looked everywhere, I really need some advice and just don't know who else to talk too.
"I have an Infinity Stone keeping me alive," Lily says, "I want your help in creating an energy source that can take its place if it comes to that."
"Go ahead," Ross says from the doorway of the lab, causing everyone to jump at his voice, "I'd particularly like to know everything myself too."
"I know," Pietro says, "But right now, what she needs is a supportive parent, one that will help with Laura and be there when she needs them."
“Yeah, it’s weird. I still can’t believe my dad wants me to be closer to him,” she says filling out a chart.
Seconds after I put her down she pulls my head down and kisses me. I pause for a moment not knowing what to do, I relax and kiss her back. We stand there in the doorway of the cell kissing for a few minutes until Pietro and Clint start to laugh.
"We're planning a large reception, I've already told Tony who to invite and to go nuts, for this weekend," Dad says, "But we want the ceremony to be private."
"Nat, let him up. Iron Legion, hold onto him," I say walking towards Loki. Everyone one does what I asked.
Tony, who is clearly taken aback by Steve, walks over to him. His eyes full of hurt, anger, and something unreadable. He stands in front of him looking up into his blue eyes, every angry fibre in him relaxing, finally feeling calm and safe. Steve looks down into his Tony's eyes, his own giving away all the love and admiration he feels towards the smaller man. Tony recognizes the look in Steve's eyes and reaches out a hand, as his suit opens around his hand, and places it on Steve's bearded cheek; sliding it back into his hair, Tony pulls Steve forward and kisses him, passionately.
It's been three years since Bucky and I got married. We decided that after the wedding it was a good idea for us to retire, move away from the base to raise Ras, and start a normal life.
Dad sits there chuckling at that, he turns to face me and smiles. I smile back at lean into the base of the tree behind me.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the words leave his mouth he’s gone. She looks over at Steve and he’s chuckling at her confused look.
Clint is pacing around his room talking to Pietro trying to figure out how to act around Dylan and Bucky now, knowing all about her past.
I sit on the bed looking around the room trying to calm myself down. For the past three weeks I've been having nightmares but this is the first one about the rape I've had in years. I start crying involuntarily allowing myself to let it all out.
"I was going to offer a drink if you could teach me your ways of getting out of mandatory work functions," he says, smiling at me.
"I won't go back with him," I say looking at my hands, "I'll marry you. Just please help him like you promised."
"Okay, one, you are a God," I say reaching my hand out and taking his, "and two, he doesn't have a say in my life, if he did I wouldn't have Ras."
I look over at Bucky who's sitting on the other side of Laura and try to think of what to say to make last night not awkward. After dinner is finished a few people get up and make some toasts to the happy couple, then the music starts for the dance.
She arrives into the city in under an hour and parks near Central Park. Once out of the car she breaks into a quick jog and arrives at a tree near the bridge that crosses over the Pond, making quick work she climbs up into the branches and hides within the foliage waiting for her lead to show up.
"Groot is a Floral Colossus," Lily says, "and Rocket looks like a Racoon, but will murder you if you point that out."
"Sweetheart, baby girl," Dad says wrapping his arm around my shoulders, "I'm not going anywhere. Pietro, me, and Bucky are your family on this base. You can't loose us that easily."
"Okay," he replies, more hurt then when I got mad at him after I left, "I won't tell anyone else about our son."
"You're Clint," I whip around spiting at him, "You're not my dad, biologically yes, but emotionally you are not my dad."
I storm out of the room racing downstairs to the shoot range and locking myself in there. I fall onto the floor crying because I just lost all of my family in the run of a month. I hear a faint knocking at the door and go to open it.
The door opens and three armed guards walk in. I smirk as one charges towards me. I quickly avoid his punch and grab his arm, engulfing him in flame. I slowly move towards the other two, hands still on fire. They both charge at me and I quickly throw them to the ground burning them in the process.
"Thor is quite the handful," he says, chuckling, "he will be a great king someday but an even better warrior. Loki is still not sleeping through the night, he will be our little trouble maker.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He sits down next to me pulling me into a hug. Start crying into his chest, I feel him rub small circles into my back.
The tower starts to crumble around them, giant pieces’ start falling towards the people below. She feels a hand grab her waist throwing her back away from the edge as it starts to fall. She turns to see the spot where Happy is standing fall away from the building and plummet for the ground below. Running to the edge she tries to reach her hand for him but he’s too far away, leaning towards him she feels the building starting to give way, making her start to fall. Before she can accept it, she feels a hand grab onto mine, looking up she see the other hand, the metal hand, buried deep into the building.
"I take it the talk with Dad didn't go well," I say pressing the emergency stop button, "Tell me what happened."
"I know how this feels," he says looking out the window, "I have to be haunted with the image of me shooting our daughter and now I can't even talk to my team, my family, about our son."
The rest of the team walks onto the jet at this point. I stand outside, waiting to calm myself before getting on that flight back to the base.
"Please, Dylan," Clint says, "I'm your dad and I'm not letting you leave because Cooper is throwing a fit."
“It’s fine,” she says, “it’s easier than trying to find him in the water. Where’s his shield anyway? He had it with him in New York so shouldn’t it be with him now?”
"She's an Asgardian," Thor says walking into the kitchen, "she's one of the strongest people I know. Even more so now that she knows how to control the power from the Infinity Stone within her."
Tony walks into the kitchen seeing Bucky curled up on the floor surrounded by broke plates, glasses, and cupboards. He walks up to the man seeing a look he recognizes from his mirror.
"You fucking sick perverted freak," I spit to the camera in Russian, "I'll make your death slow and painful, while your base watches me make a statement out of you."
I look around and see that the room is still a disaster, hearing a knock at the door. I crawl out of the bed and walk over to the door.
"No, Steve, I'm sorry," I say pulling him into a hug, "I'm sorry that you and Tony are fighting and barely talking. I'm sorry that you had to choose sides between your husband and your best friend. I'm sorry I wasn't able to help."
"So when we land, no one will be there," Steve said as we were flying to the facility, "we picked this day because Agent Romanov is off picking up another one of our agents moving in today, and the rest of the team is off on a simple mission."
"Laying in a hospital bed, talking about my headaches," I answer squirming in his hold, "What does it look like?"
"She's at her apartment unpacking," I say looking around at the room, "I''m going to be staying there, I haven't had a code green since Sokovia and don't plan on it anytime soon."
"Okay, another jet is on it's way to this location," Steve says as Pietro hugs Wanda, "Once it gets here we'll head out to the facility that is holding Bucky. Wanda and Loki will work together to make sure all traces, and this time we do mean all, of Hydra are gone so he can get back to his family."
"What if you had someone else from the team there? I mean two sets of eyes on one mobile person is better then one," Clint says picking up Nathaniel so he can put the bowl in the sink, "I mean if you don't mind someone tagging along."
She listens to what she has to say, and before anything else can be done or said she’s one the ground sobbing, screaming out no sound. She tries to fight off the arms trying to wrap around her, to comfort her, but is unsuccessful. Together they sit there on what’s left of the roof unable to control their voices, their tears, their broken hearts.
Bucky leads the team into Malicks Hydra base in Crimea. He'll do anything for his daughter, even going into the belly of the beast.
"I'm sorry, James, but there wasn't any hope of this thing between us surviving," I say coldly, "It's better this way."
"I want to thank you," I say again, lowering my hand, "As terrible as an event that was, you saved me. I was able to get away from Hydra and now I'm going to be on a team stand up against them."
"We have bigger problems," Eric says, "Vision left the base two nights ago and hasn't been seen since."
"How did you know about her," I ask him, "How long were you watching over her? When did you fall in love with her?"
Before I can reply Pietro is already up the rest of the stairs, I get off on the next floor and take the elevator up to our living quarters.
I sit there nodding taking in everything. It's crazy to believe that we're finally safe, that we don't have to run anymore. I've finally filled the promise to Laura that I'd keep her safe and we'd get a normal life soon.
"That is Laura, the baby in her arms is Rasputin also known as Ras, that is Pietro, and I'm Dylan," I reply.
"You're alive," Eric asks looking between Loki and Lily, "and you didn't think to warn us that he was on the ship?"
"That's not fair, I'm in more control when I top, I haven't topped in weeks," Pietro says defensively from his seat.
I jump out of bed ripping off the wires attached to me and racing down to the morgue. I throw open the doors and walk over to her body, seeing it twitch as Tony told me.
"Momma, she didn't answer me," Laura says tears running down her face, "Every night since she left I would always use our connection to say goodnight and normally she would answer, but she didn't and I'm scared."
We stand in the entry way hearing this argument happening upstairs. I turn and walk out of the house closely followed by Pietro and Bucky.
Before anyone can answer an arrow is shot between Loki and myself causing an electric shock knocking us both on our asses.
"I could just make you tell me, I do have the power to make people tell the truth," I say putting my dishes in the dishwasher.
"You care for this man that I will be working on don't you," Loki says, noticing the break in my voice, "I swear to you I won't let anything bad happen to him in this process."
We sit there as the screen flickers on show a news report about an accident just a mile down the road,
"For Ras, I don't want him to grow up and not know his father," I reply involuntarily, "Laura didn't know her father for most of her life and I don't want Ras to go through that as well."
She hangs up the phone and walks out the door locking her apartment. Hopping into her car she drives off towards the hospital, pulling into her usual spot she gets out of the car and walks into the lobby.
"You see here," he says pointing to part of the artifact, "it actually says 'all men, have they stained skin or new skin, be equals to each other.' Which shows that this civilization is more advanced than our own."
"Dylan," he says pleading, "I came to check on Laura and couldn't get the door open. Please lower the gun and help me see our daughter."
"Sorry," Bucky says holstering his gun, "I should have offered, but seeing him lock you in that cell again just pissed me off."
"I'm not sure. Last thing I remember is being in my closet and now I'm here fully grown," the familiar voice replies. I walk over to her pulling her into a hug now that I am able to see.
"Yeah, I know. Just not yet," I whisper to myself as he walks out and leads me to my old room to start packing.
With that Pietro is gone in a flash, I sit on the couch not taking my eyes off of the man I once knew. I notice that his cheeks are still wet from tears and I feel bad that I caused someone to cry.
"Okay, so when I was seven I was on the bus home from school one day," Dylan starts telling us about her past, "and when the bus stopped at my usual stop I got off and started to walk home, when people grabbed me. They were speaking Russian, I know that now, and they injected me with something knocking me out.
"You can tell him about Laura," I say to him in Russian, earning concerned looks from Pietro and Wanda, "We'll make up how I got pregnant though."
I'm pulled into a massive hug by Mom and Dad after saying that, I feel Bucky and the rest of the team join.
“I don’t know if what I saw was just a shadow that looks like you or if it was actually you, but I need you to know,” she continues, tears gathering at the corner of her eyes, “that I waited and I wanted to wait forever for you to come back. I don’t think anyone will ever hold the same place in my heart as you did.
Quiet. Slowly she steps down from the toilet and make her way out of the bathroom. Walking through the terminal she sees a pair of people sitting in one of the windows. She’s about to go and talk to them when they start running, being followed by a man crawling on the windows. What happens next is a blur, things are being thrown around at each person only to stop when the person dressed in a blue and red suit is thrown out the window.
I walk into the bathroom and and sit in the shower as the cool water runs down my back as I start to cry.
"Our second person in charge says that this planet speaks English," Korg replies, "I just need to bring someone to them or they're going to send out this guy that can see everything and he kind of freaks me out."
"I know, Dylan, and I'm going to be here with you throughout this all," Dad says walking into the room.
The doctor quickly says something to the nurse, I start crying harder as the pain washes over me. I can't hear what my Dad is saying but I am able to hear sounds coming from his general direction. I feel the pain getting worse the more often I get contractions. I feel the doctor tap on my knee trying to get my focus back.
"Hey, old man," Pietro says from his seat, "I'm not letting you die until we're married, and then you'll be here every week for check ups. I love you and can't live without you."
"No, I mean what are you doing to make Laura's body move," he asks again releasing my head, "The doctors are down there prepping her for the funeral and out of now where her body starts twitching."
We get to the car and there's a piece of paper under the whipper, Clint grabs it and quickly reads it. He then hands it to Pops, who starts yelling in Russian.
I want to thank everyone that read this fic, it's my first time writing something like this and I never imagined such a great response to it. I will be writing a squeal to this picking up right where this left off, I really hope the people that have read this will be there when I start the next one.
"I've been here before," I whisper in Russian, "This is the base, actually the exact cell, where I-the other guy raped her."
He races away from me before I'm able to say anything else. I stand there looking in the direction that he ran zoning out that I don't notice that my Dad place his hand on my shoulder until he says something.
I sit there a few moments longer waiting to make sure that they're gone. I stand up and start walking to the nearest bus stop, this will not be the first time they look for us.
"Anytime today, they stopped in at the farm to see Cooper and Lila and they'll be here after that," I say.
"Okay, last question," Steve says bringing me back to reality, "Are there any traces of Hydra orders left?"
"James, I'm not going to let you beat yourself up about this," I move around him so I'm between him and the counter as I say this, "We have to work through this together but you are not going to beat yourself up. I love you and I won't less this weaken you."
“You really want me to move in? You know I snore and am a slob and take way to long in the morning,” he says as she unlocks her door, “you’d never get a break from tha-”
She walks towards the edge of the roof, looking down at the mess below, she watches as Tony’s suits look through the rubble searching for any sign of anyone. Standing there she senses the presence of Steve and Tony just behind her.
"Not science, but I have successfully done this with magic," Loki says, "Wanda has done this before, she will make sure I don't cross any critical lines."
She walks into the elevator and makes her way to the nurses' station she always works from, stepping onto the floor she is cut off by Sean.
I nod and continue to follow Wanda as we exit the base and walk into the woods just past the training area. I stand there calming myself before I speak.
"Let's head to the base," I say turning to Pietro and the rest of the team, "Let's just hope Dylan hasn't left yet."
"Of course, you'll just have to bring us back our Asset," he says pausing, "once you've been cleared and brought up to our new standard."
I walk into the living room with the rest of the team. Looking around I see that Bucky isn't with everyone.
"The End," I finish the story, standing up and tucking her in, "Good night pumpkin," I lean in and kiss her on her forehead.
“Surgery,” Clint says from where he’s standing, eyes not moving from the doors they took Pietro through, “and it’s because of me. Just like Phil.”
Unwillingly, she leaves the hospital and makes her way towards her car, the whole time feeling a set of eyes follow her every move. She quickens her pace and gets to her car unlocking it and jumping in, bumping her rear-view mirror as she does so. She repositions her mirror to see a pair of empty tires eyes in her back seat, slowly she starts to turn to face the anonymous eyes but is stopped short but the pressure of a gun held to her side.
I stand there looking at my feet not knowing what to do next. Before I can look up Laura is hugging me.
"It's going to, oh hi there sweetheart," Tony stops mind thought noticing Laura on the couch between her grandparents.
"Well I wouldn't have butted in if you didn't feel the need to be the smartest man in the room," she replies, "but my job at this museum is to translate all the artifacts brought in, so, I think I know what I'm talking about."
"So you two are Barton's family then, well and your sister too then," Loki says looking back at me, "And you're the spoke person when Captain Rogers isn't around, aren't you? That child, well both of them look an awful lot like you, how much do I want to bet that the girl is your twin and the boy is your son."
"He couldn't have survived this," Pietro whispers to me in Russian as Dad talks our way into the area.
"I was, but I don't think tonight is a good night," I say walking into my room, Bucky following behind, "I mean I was going to suggest tonight but I'm really tired now."
“You’re letting him leave right,” she says, sitting in the kitchen leaning into Happy’s side as Tony pours them drinks.
As soon as the hair is out of his eyes, I'm engulfed into a hug by him. I stand there tense feeling the cool metal through my shirt bringing up terrible flashes of that night. Without hesitation I grab his shoulders, my hands engulfed in flame, and throw him into the wall beside us. I fall to my knees gasping for air feeling the wet trails of tears running down my face. Seconds after I fall I feel a small hand rest on my shoulder.
"Well, how about a coffee tomorrow," she says, "that way I can tell you how a party at Avengers tower equals a full day of work."
"We could ask Tony," Natasha whispers in Russian, "See if he can find her, or if the connection is broken."
"Lila," he says, stopping the pair in front of the steps to the library they spent most of their childhood together in, "I must confess, this gift is a little selfish."
"Okay," I say, "Thank you for helping us, I know this isn't really your cup of tea but it's greatly appreciated."
"Slow down, Mom, or else you're going to make yourself sick," Laura says as she enters the kitchen with Wanda and Natasha.
We're sitting in silence on the quinjet flying to dad's old farmhouse. I look over to Laura, who is on the left of me, as she draws a picture. I stand up from my seat and walk towards Pietro and Wanda.
Valkyrie is about to say more as a ship starts to land next to the Saakarian ship. Lily walks over to the ship and opens the door, once it lands, and steps inside. The group still standing on the ground look between each other, Lily steps off the ship and walks toward the group.
"Bucky finally popped the question," Tony yells, "It's about damn time, I mean how many kids do you guys need to have together before you get married?"
"Shh, it's okay. You'll be okay, I'm here to help. I'm Dylan, please don't hurt me I have a daughter. I'm trying to keep her safe and to do that I have to bring you back to life," I say to the man as his eyes flutter open.
"You said you don't go back on your word," Loki says to me with a hurt expression on his face, "Why are you doing this?"
I hear the door close and look around the room, Dylan's not laying next to me. I reach up grabbing a piece of paper on her pillow and read it quickly. I get dressed, grab the bag I packed earlier that day. I hop onto Steve's motorcycle and race away from the base, hoping to leave the memory of this night and my feelings for Dylan behind. I loose control of the bike and fly over the side of a cliff.
I hand Laura over to Dad, knowing that she needs to be in the arms of family when she hears this again.
“I called Tony,” Happy says once they’re alone on the sidewalk, “he sent the suit. It’s bringing Steve to him.”
I walk up crouching beside him a place my hand lightly on his shoulder. He lifts his head sightly and I'm able to see his face. I've seen this look many times, mostly when looking into my own mirror.
I storm out the room racing back to my room. I lock the door and trash everything I had in the room, I find a picture of Laura, Bucky and me and smash it onto the ground. I collapse into the pile of glass loosing control and sobbing onto the floor. I ignore everyone that tries to come see me. I lay down on the flipped over mattress and fall asleep.
"Hey, Sparky, it's fine," he says helping me up, "It'll get better, tomorrow I'll let you go full crazy in the shooting range."
That causes Laura to laugh, I smile just as Lila and Cooper race down the stairs. I step away from Laura just in time to catch Lila who jumps up into my arms.
"Loki, my love, you have been skeptical of a lot of people," Lila says, "but your father would not have him escort me if he was not trustworthy."
"She's moved past it, Clint," Pietro says walking towards me, "I wanted to kill him too. When she ran out of the hanger the first night she was here and told me that her rapist was on this team, I wanted to kill everyone that I knew it wasn't."
"No, we don't," I reply, "I don't have a connection with this baby, and want to be surprised for once with my baby. How about you guys, Dad?"
"There will be a titan named Thanos in the worlds we want to make," he says, "he will hunt down these stones and harness their power to destroy all that we have created."
I sit on the bed and start crying, letting all this pent-up emotion out, "I don't know what to do anymore."
"No, I got a headache," I say looking back at him, "It wasn't because of what you said, I've been having these headaches since Laura died. I've only had two panic attacks today, for the past three weeks I had five a day, now that I'm with you; now that I can look into your eyes and know that you're him, you're really the guy I fell in love with, I feel safer. I'm at home with you and I don't want to go back to that room ever again. I can't go back into the room I trashed that night, I need to be with you because we have a chance to start over as a real family."
"Stay safe," Lily and Shuri say to each other as Lily leaves with the group, the pair smiling at one another at their concern for the other's safety.
“You can’t,” Happy says, looking down at her, “if Loki is coming for you I want to be there to fight beside you. I know I don’t have to fight for you, but I can fight with you.”
"She left," I say walking over to the freezer pulling out a bag of frozen peas wrapping it around my hand, "Tony picked her up and took them all back to the base."
"And Drax, well, he's odd, and will murder you if you point that out," Lily says, "the only normal, and I use that term loosely, is Peter and that's because he's half Terrian."
"I have a right to kill him," I say stopping and turning to face him, "She's my daughter and he violated her."
"I don't know, celebrating," I say putting the heels I'm suppose to wear tonight on the coffee table.
“You weren’t coming when I asked nicely so,” he says grabbing her upper arm pulling her up from her seat, “Happy, I suggest you don’t get up and don’t think about following us.”
He nods pulling on the shirt quickly buttoning it up, I look over at Dad and Bruce who are wearing the same ties and smile.
We all stand there for a minute in silence. I look up at Steve and he nods, I walk out of the kitchen and head back towards my room. Once in my room, I turn on the shower, step in, sitting on the floor and start crying as I let the water wash over me.
"You're not on your own anymore," he says as he cautiously puts a hand on my shoulder, "you're surrounded by family too."
"Well, why don't we go sit down somewhere and you tell us everything," Bruce says, resting his hand lightly on her shoulder.
“Thanks, I should get going, though. I’ll see you when I get back,” she says hugging Fury and then Steve.
“No, I’ve broken up with them right on the spot,” she says, “but you, you’re different. I know what you do is dangerous and you haven’t died from that so it’s unlikely that you’ll died from us agreeing to live together.”
“Hey. I’m at work, there was an alien invasion today. Where are you? I’ll be out in a moment, what’s so important anyway? Why can’t you tell me over the phone? Fine, give me a couple of minutes,” she finishes the conversation hanging up the phone.
"Yes, Dylan and I got very close when she was healing me," he answers, with a broken look on his face, "I know a lot about her past."
She shakes her head and walks over to the opening with the guard. Turning back, she smiles at Loki as the passage opens and they disappear to Midgard.
Steve leaves the room leaving me and Bucky alone with Malick. The sneer grows on Malicks face, he's about to say something when I hear the loud bang of a gun. I look back to Malick and see his head go limp as the blood trickles down his chest.
"Hey, Sparky, why so pissed off looking," Tony says tossing Dad a beer from the fridge, "Metal Arm not letting you top?"
"I'm just overwhelmed," I say lifting my head from my hands, still staring at them, "I haven't seen Dylan since she was seven and now she has her own daughter. I just feel like I missed so much with my first child and now I want to make it up to her by being that overprotective parent."
"No, I didn't," I say as I stop stuffing clothes into my back, "Pietro, I didn't mean it like that. I'm just dealing with a lot of shit right now and I ne-"
"Well, I should get going, Betty will be worried," I say as I stand up from the couch, "It was great seeing you all again, I'll bring Betty by at some point so she can meet all of you."
"Another communication from Thanos came in," he says, as they fall into step heading towards Lily's office, "we've spent all afternoon trying to translate it. We got one word."
"Bucky is worried about you," Steve says walking out of the kitchen, "Us and the ones at the weddings are supposed to be the only ones that know, but I think you should go tell Buck where you were."
"Be careful with that," Lily says, snatching it from his hands, "this is the only thing that will keep me alive when Thanos comes to collect this stone. One of the three he's missing thanks to you."
"No I got this, you stay with them," Pietro says as Laura climbs onto his back, "You called them mom and dad, you wouldn't have been allowed to leave anyway," He whispers to me in Russian earning a grin from Bucky.
She takes in all of Steve, or what’s left of him that is. His face and body are thin, like he hasn’t eaten in months, the eyes that are usually so full of life are as empty and lost as the ones she saw in her review mirror in Washington.
I walk out of the jet with Laura and Bucky. I tense up at the familiar looking house, seconds after I start freaking out I feel Pietro and Bucky wrap their arms around my shoulder and waist.
"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you for the first time," Thor booms over the crowd, "Mr. and Mr. Rogers-Stark."
"Yes, he did do bad things," Dylan continues, "but I also saw that he fell in love with me, he kept watch over me. I don't know how long he knew about me but I had a guardian that learned how to love."
These beings were in control of creating everything. There was one with a different affinity for each power used to create the universe. Five of these beings create a stone to harness their power, these are the five Infinity Stones know to us. The last being saw into the future they were trying to create and knew of the danger that was to come.
"You'll stand with him yes," she asks, "I assume Nat is standing with Clint, and with just how similar your relationship is with Pietro to theirs, I think you should stand with him."
“Changed the rules,” she says back calmly as Tony, Sam, Natasha, Wanda, Clint, Pietro, and Bucky join them on the roof, “my father’s been dead for years because of you and now you’re going to pa-”
"I do care about her. I've never cared about someone as much as I care about her," Loki screams towards Dad, "I can't stand to see her with someone that causes her so much pain that she can't even talk about what happened."
"Thank you," she says, pulling him into a hug, "you don't know how helpful this could be. It might even give us a leg up on Thanos!"
“He needs an OR, there’s no exit hole on his back,” she says, “we have to get that out before we can stitch him up. Follow me.”
“Yea, I mean you practically live here anyway,” she blurts out, “Tony is shocked when you stay upstate so it just makes sense.”
"You're already so much more," he says in his groggy sleep voice, "I'm sorry I asked you to change."
Before he can answer, the colour in his face drains and he is on the floor passed out. A nurse comes in and moves him to another room.
"I don't want a big wedding, I had that before with your mother," Dad says looking exhausted from this conversation already, "Pietro wants something as fancy as Steve's and Tony's wedding and I just don't know if I can do it. I can't even mention, scratch that, think the word elope without getting the death-glare from Wanda."
"I pushed his hair out of his face," I say continuing in Russian, " and he pulled me into a hug. I had a panic attack and protected myself."
"No," Everett says, as his date chuckles at my translation, "I believe my translation is correct, and you should really mind your own business."
I stand turn slowly and am nearly knocked over by by a quick kick to the shin. I look up and see a brown haired boy run back into the house.
I pull him up from the floor and we walk out of the lab towards Clint's room to get ready. I knock on the door before entering and am engulfed in a hug by Pietro.
"Of course," Shuri replies, "and you won't lose anything. You'll still have the same energy surges that can be used in a fight, and you will still be able to read, write, speak, hear, and understand any language you face."
Once he is sitting up he wraps his hands around my waist pulling me closer to him, "Don't change, ever," he whispers against my lips before kissing them.
"Wow," I say sarcastically, while clapping, "Aren't you just a smart ass, but you're half wrong, Laura is my daughter and Ras is my son. Biologically Laura is 12, but let's just say the two of us went through hell for a couple of hours and now she's an adult. Why does Steve think you can help us?"
"He's telling the truth though," Thor says, giving Lily a confused look, "you should know what he's talking about Lila."
I get off of Bucky and walk towards the hallway, Bucky right behind me. I open the door and see everyone else making there way away from Tony's and Steve's room, Bucky adn I join the team and walk towards the common area.
"Yes, do you not understand what that means," Loki says, "We are meant to be together, you aren't supposed to be with him, you're supposed to be with me."
"Sorry about the base being really tense these past couple of days," Clint says as we watch Laura open her notepad and start to draw different flowers around us, "Bucky had a flashback and won't talk to anyone."
The last thing I remember before falling into a deep sleep was Clint quickly kissing my forehead and saying, "I'm not leaving your side, kid."
"I'll try, I make no promises but I'll try," Dad says as he turns back to the wheel, "And for your mother and siblings, they're just excited to meet you and your daughter. They don't care about how you got pregnant."
"He said I have no right to marry you and if I tried he'd kill me," he replies, still looking at his hands.
"Let's get you back to the base," I say wrapping my arm around him, "Tony will check you out and give to go ahead to join us training again."
"Hello," Steve answers the phone, "Wait, Tony slow down," he pauses listening to the other line, "Really," he pauses again starting to cry, "We can come back, I can come home?" He hangs up the phone and faces everyone.
I just started to feel safe, I just started to trust most of this team, and now, I have to start running away. I have to uproot my daughter, and take her away the people that treat us like family. I have to loose my father. Again.
It's been a week since I asked Tony to plan the wedding, but the day is finally here, hopefully it goes off exactly as it's planned. I stand in a room with Dad, Laura, Wanda and Pietro.
"How are you feeling, has a nurse seen you, have they paged Bruce," Dad asks while moving to stand up.
"Long story short, that means I'm still betrothed to Loki," she says, "Thor is now the King and he's who I have to convince to release me from this."
"True again, I mean we aren't even engaged. So it's not their business on when we get engaged either," he says as we continue up in the elevator.
"No, no I haven't," he answers, looking around the playground quickly, "she probably forgot something in the car and went to get it."
"Okay, let the girl breathe some, Roadrunner," Clint says before taking me into a small and softer hug, "Where's Laura?"
"Lily could translate anything you need translated," Ross says, receiving a glare in response from Lily.
“Last time I had a date my father answered the door with some untested weapon,” she says, “I was 17.”
"I ran into Bucky and he asked me to ask you if you could just forget about the fight as tonight is an important night for your Dad and my brother," she says looking at me trying to understand the whole thing.
Lila jumps up from her perch and pulls Loki back out to the beautiful Asgardian day. She takes a hold of his hand and they walk through the packed streets, enjoying the presence of each other and the silence they can comfortably have together.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Wait, Hydra knew about all of this," Steve asks motioning between me and Laura, "They knew that she was able to do more, and your connection could do more?"
"My brother will be showing up tomorrow as well," she says, "so there will be another ship showing up here. No need to pop out and see what's up with that ship."
"Laura, go help Clint with Nathaniel," I wait until she leaves the room, "If we bring Pietro that's another person that could be taken by Hydra. We're risking it bad enough by both of us going, but I'm not taking this away from our daughter."
She looks over at the buzzer mounted in the wall and see a bullet hole straight through the speaker, turning she give Bucky a what the hell look.
Dad is about to lunge at him but is knocked to the ground by Pietro. I see Steve and Wanda walk out of the woods together seeing the very dysfunctional scene before them.
"Come on, Roadrunner, we have a trip to plan," after I say that I'm picked up and carried, quite quickly, to the hanger and we start to plan our flight to my old farm house.
Enskauja paused for a moment, trying to decide if she should be honest with him or not. Looking over at him she could see the hope in his eyes at her being the eldest.
“We’re the closest to Stark tower, start moving patients into rooms together, three four tops. Call down to the ER and have everyone in there moved to a different hospital. Page the OR and clear out any noncritical surgeries,” she starts barking out orders, “Sarah, let’s go down to the ER and start prepping the space.”
"I'm probably going to take the kids in and put them to bed," Mom says just as the music starts, "Cooper, Lila, and myself have to get up early tomorrow to fly back to the farm."
"I do know," she says taking a step closer to me, "I just don't know if you really want to know this."
“He tried to take you as a hostage and you want to talk to him,” Tony says, walking through his lab.
“You’re not safe if you stay here. There have been talks through the criminal message boards that dangerous things are wait for you and your family,” he says, “but I know that they’re misinformed, they keep talking of your father.”
"He's fine, healthy as can be for being premature," Bucky says, "He has abilities just like you and Laura, his are more dangerous. He's the reason why you're still here, he's able to coat himself in blades, that's how he got out and that's why you had his so early."
"See how nice I am to the rest of the team," Tony says, "All rooms can be soundproof, just ask Jarvis before you start and no one has to hear your screaming," he says hitting Pietro on the leg, causing everyone in the room to burst out laughing.
She feels a set of arms, ones that don’t belong to Steve, lift her off the ground and carry her into the tower. She’s too consumed by her grief that she can’t hear the words coming out of anyone’s mouth until she hears the familiar voice of her father. Rushing toward him she breaks down even more than she has as she feel the familiarity of his arms holding her.
Natasha walks to my side and starts asking her questions again, Malick answers this time as blue smoke is twisting around him. I feel the team staring at me as this is the first time that I'm using my truth ability. After Natasha has gathered the information the team needed, I see her walk out of the room followed by everyone but Steve, Bucky and myself.
I storm out of the room before he can say anything. I walk into the common area and see Dylan sitting there talking and laughing with most of the Avengers. I slowly make my way to an open seat and sit down picking up a book from the table in the process. After everyone start to loosen up around me sitting there they get back into their conversation.
"It's because he cares about me that he went under," I reply, "We went through a lot in the past 5 months, he ki-actually, I'd prefer not to talk about it. It's very hard to talk about."
We continue up the stairs in silence. Once at the top of the stairs Pietro urges me to go to my room and rest but I refuse. We walk towards the common area where the most of the team is.
"The hospital, and that beeping is the machine helping our son breathe," Bucky answers still rubbing my hand, "You went into labour about two months ago, he's been on that machine since then. You've been in a coma, at first it was due to the amount of pain you were in, then the past couple of weeks it was a medically induced coma because we need you to focus on healing yourself."
"Yes, they ran test on me when I was younger and realized that once I was old enough I would gain immortality, to a point, after dying and our connection could help read others minds," Laura says walking to my side, "I'm now only able to die at the hands of her fire, and if one of us is making eye contact with someone and the other engages in physical contact we are both able to read someone's mind."
"Clint, get him out of here," I hear Pietro say to Clint who just showed up in the doorway. I know that he's talking about Bucky and I try to stop him but am unable to speak.
I slowly unlock the door and pull it open, her head lifts up from her hands. I see as her eyes lighten up at the sight of us. She runs towards me pulling me into her arms, engulfing me into a giant hug. I hug back picking her up, not realizing that I'm crying until she wipes away a tear as she looks into my eyes.
I walk into the kitchen and see Steve and Tony looking pissed at Bucky, Clint sitting on a bar stool with his arms wrapped around Pietro.
Steve waits with Dylan behind Bucky as Natasha starts walking down the aisle. He watches as Bucky starts walking, he quickly looks down at Dylan who gives him a reassuring look. He looks up and see Tony standing at the end of the aisle looking up at Steve as they make their way towards him. Dylan and Steve reach the end of the aisle and she smiles at both of them before taking her seat next to Laura and her family.
"Before anyone else can say anything embarassing about me," Lily says, "we should get going. I have a lot of work that is waiting for me."
"I'm sorry, James," I say when I stop crying, "I just don't know whats going on with me right now. I'm emotional, hormonal, and nausea."
"No, I'm not letting you see her," I say not lowering the gun, "This isn't you, you're being this way because of them."
"You have to stop running away, each time you do the more torture we put her through," Strucker said, motioning to Laura.
I charge into the room, feeling the sharp pain I felt when Laura was shot. I'm being held back by Steve.
"Well he did save an entire race of people," she says, "twice. So, I don't understand why you're so mad at him."
"Of course," he answers in his think accent, shifting into a seated position, "how was your day with Dylan and Laura?"
"Yes, I was ordered to kill her," Bucky says looking up at me from behind hurt eyes, "It was supposed to have you join Hydra."
"Loki, from you I almost expect it at this point in our lives," she says smiling up at the raven-haired man.
I stand there realizing that he's right, I've never called him by his name until this moment. Until this moment when he realizes that he has a family, he's not that monster that Hydra made him be, well to some extent, considering that he became a father through rape.
“It wasn’t me,” he says walking into the kitchen, “and Tony’s been upstate since Thursday so that only leaves you or Bucky.”
I wake up to the small of coffee brewing in the kitchen. I crawl out of bed, still wearing Bucky's dress shirt and make my way down the hall.
"Pietro ran back to the house," Bucky says looking at his hands, "I asked him to get Laura for you, so when Tony lands the two of you can leave right away."
"The next thing I remember is waking up in this room, I was freaking out. After a couple of minutes this woman walked in and told me that I was in the Red room in Russia and that I was there because my father flipped their best assassin."
"I don't know, sweetheart. You know how dangerous it is for me out there and with all those people around I wouldn't be able to focus on anything but you," I reply.
"So, um, I don't mean to be rude, or pushy, Clint, but are you wearing hearing aids?" I ask the man sitting across from me as smaller conversations break out around the room.
When back in New York I got a job at one of the museums helping translate artifacts. I was attending one of the Gala's we put on when I met Ross. He was showing one of the artifacts that I translated to his date and was acting all smug about how the translation was incorrect.
"What? I didn't ask about Clint knowing," Steve says caught off guard, "Weren't you having twins though?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“This is my father,” she says, “I have thought this through, when he told me about the Avengers initiative I knew this was a possibility.”
"I wanted to talk to you about the kiss earlier," I say looking at my hands, "I want to apologize for it. I was overemotional with being rescued and shouldn't have done that. It won't hap-"
We stand there in silence waiting for Clint to answer but he never does. I stand there looking around the room and anywhere but at Clint and Pietro. It's not until Bucky nudges me making me look up at Clint that I realize that he's signing at me.
"Oww, that fucking hurts," I scream at him, he doesn't seem to register so I try again in Russian; he looks at me but doesn't let go. He just pulls me closer to him, "Let me go! You're fucking hurting me!"
"I'm not answering," I scream to the closed door, "for a reason, just go away," I rip open the door and see Bucky standing there.
I walk out of the hospital room with Ras in my arms. Pietro and Laura are walking back with me, it's been three weeks since I woke up. Bucky and Dad have been missing since I woke up. I walk into the common area and see Vision sitting there on the couch with Tony and Rhodey.
Lily walks out of the base towards the ship from Saakar the next morning, followed closely by Happy and Eric. The door opens and out walks Loki, Valkyrie, and Heimdall.
I stand there still looking at my hands, "I just don't think that anything can happen between us. We have to focus on Laura, and now with Clint knowing that he's my dad," I trail off at that part looking up at Bucky and seeing the hurt in his eyes.
"I'm not a mortal, bitch," I yell, as flames start to engulf my hands, "I'm an inhuman and you tortured my father!"
He moves his head far enough back so he can look into my eyes. I smile at him before kissing him, he kisses back softly at first but changes into a passionate lust filled kiss. I start walking backwards towards the bed pulling him with me, he follows running his hand up under my shirt smiling into the kiss. We reach the bed and fall backwards Bucky landing lightly on top of me, I wrap my legs around his waist as his tongue brushes against my lips. I open my mouth allowing him to explore my mouth as I explore his, I roll him over so that I'm laying on top of him. He pulls his head back just enough to say something.
I wake up in a private room, hooked up to three different machines, looking around I notice that my Dad and Bucky are both asleep in hospital chairs on either side of me. I find the button that will call a nurse and press it.
We walk down the cliff that Bucky went over carefully, I see the area where the wreck of the bike still is and look around there for a sign of him. I'm about to continue down the hill when I see a trail of blood going left of the wreck.
I feel Bucky's chest moving with his laughter and smile to myself. I push myself up off of his chest and walk over to Laura, who's fast asleep now.
"Don't be upset but Pietro told us about your healing power. That's why we're offering you a spot on our medical staff," Steve spoke up, "You don't have to take it but we will protect you either way."
"I am, where else would I go," I reply, "My daughter is an Avenger, the father of my children is an Avenger, my home is at the base."
"You did have a pretty pissed off reaction when you found out Loki handed over the Tesseract to Thanos," Happy says, "and mentioned your father being an ally until he handed over the wrong daughter. What did you mean by that?"
"Sorry, I'm just pissed at Tony because he fired the decorators the night before our wedding," Steve says slumping into the counter beside Tony.
Lily and Ross walk back into Shuri's lab a couple of hours later to see her smiling and holding something very small.
Dylan is stuck translating Steve and Tony's argument with Bucky to Clint. She starts to see who he really is.
I push Laura in the closet locking the door and her room door as I race behind Steve towards Tony's lab. He grabs his shield as I unhook the condensed bow from my waist band and notch an arrow as I slowly creep behind him. We walk into the lab and see the wreckage left of the lab.
She nods and continues on towards the throne room. She walks into the room seeing Thor running around and hearing the cry of an unhappy baby.
"Well, let's go eat some dinner," Steve says motioning towards the dining room. The whole group gets up and follows behind, chatting, laughing and joking like a big happy family.
“Sorry about that, my uncle has something he has to tell me,” she says, “I’ll send Sarah in to do all the discharges. Thank you by the way”
"I'M GOING TO KILL YOU JUST LIKE YOU KILLED OUR DAUGHTER IN COLD BLOOD," I scream at him feeling Steve trying to pull me away from him, "I NEVER WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN! YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME OR OUR KID AGAIN."
Lily pulls out her personal phone from her jacket pocket and looks at the notification. She turns off the screen and puts it back in her pocket.
It’s been five years since Happy died and Avery has dated four men in this time, the first three she left when they mentioned moving in together. The forth didn’t dare bring it up.
"She can meet us quickly this afternoon," Ross says as he walks back into the office, "they're sending a ride for us."
Next thing I see is a blue flash rushing into that house. I kneel down in front of Laura to try and calm myself.
"You're really piss aren't you," I ask hoping up onto the island counter diagonally across from him.
"Shhh, sweetheart, Mommy's got you. You have to be quiet, they'll find us baby," I whispered to the baby strapped to my chest.
“Steve, I can’t,” she says, “you don’t know how much even having you here could cost me. You’re a wanted felon and I work for the government.”
"We have to stay here for the night," he says, "the flower shop opens in the morning, we will go and get the flowers then return home. That will give us enough time to change for Thor's coronation."
"Oh, not much," I say reaching my hand out to take his in it, "We'll hear the heartbeat, it's been six weeks."
"Why don't you all come in for some food," Laura senior says wrapping her arm around me as we walk into the house I once called home.
"James, I'm just over emotional," I say to him, "I want to talk to you about our baby boy but it's really hard."
We walk up through the woods, finding a police cruiser to give us a lift back to the base. We sit in silence the whole drive home. We get back to the base and walk into the elevator heading up to the living quarters.
"What happens if we leave? What happens if we go looking for them and join their fight," Laura asks.
"Colonizer," Lily chuckles at the nickname Shuri uses for Ross, "you know if Tony hears that name he won't call you anything else."
"It's fine, Clint will be there so we won't be easy targets," I whisper to him in Russian as I brush Laura's hair into pigtails.
"Yes, I am that Dylan," I say as we start to walk towards the quinjet, "The Red Room kidnapped me after Clint brought you to SHIELD."
"Dylan, he blackmailed you into marrying him," Bucky pleads with me, "I can't just sit by and watch this happen."
“He’s 100 years old,” she says, “my dad was his biggest fan and I grew up with a fascination with him. When I met him after New York I just clicked with him and especially after I heard wind of my dad, Steve was the only connection to him left after Clint stopped answering my calls.”
"If you're going to be like this, I'm just going to take my hearing aids out and shut my eyes," Clint says as he sits on Pietro's lap.
"James, why don't you take Pietro and go get Nathaniel ready for the picnic," I ask Bucky as Pietro walks out of the bathroom, he nods and they both walk out of the room.
"I need to know which shirt looks good with the tie Steve picked out for us," he asks holding up two shirts, a nice clean white one and a light grey one with a white collar.
"Dylan needs her parents, and you need Laura's help with Dylan," Natasha answers, "So I made a decision to bri-"
“Well I’ve been doing this all day so I’m just doing this from muscle memory at this point,” she says, as her phone continues to ring from her pocket.
"You are about to fulfil a prophecy," he says, "we must protect your first-born, they will have so much power and responsibility on their shoulders."
Avery is standing at the top of the steps unlocking the door to her building when she senses a pair of eyes on her. Stopping she turns and sees Tony standing in the mouth of an alleyway talking to someone further in. Avery looks past the suit and sees the shadow outline of the man she believes to be dead. Slowly she raises her hand and gives a little wave before slipping into the building, finally saying goodbye to the ghost from her past.
"Your getting married," Pietro exclaims, "You're not getting married before us and we're marrying in summer."
"I'm sorry, I'm still jumpy around people touching me," I pause looking towards Bucky, "old habit from when Laura and I were on the run."
"Okay, so you guys know what to do right," I ask going over our plan one last time, "Tony and Steve are sitting with Bucky right?"
I see Steve stiffen at the voice, I slowly turn around to face the man behind us. His raven black hair and green eyes look faintly familiar. Before anyone can say anything else, there is a flash of blue and this god-like man in flat on his back being pinned down by Pietro.
“How,” he asks looking between Avery and her father, “I heard Thor tell the story watching his brother stab him in the chest.”
"I don't want to hear about your sex life with my father," I say turning deep red, "I think those are words someone should never actually have to verbalize, they should just be known."
Lily sits on the edge of her bed pulling on a pair of boots Tony gave her to go with the suit she's currently wearing. She stands, putting the blades she kept from Asgard into the slots on her thighs.
"Ready," Tony asks take a spot next to me. I nod, slowly letting blue smoke trickle out of my hands wrapping around Bucky.
"To fight as a team and keep Lily safe," Steve says, walking into the area followed by Sam, Natasha, T'Challa, Shuri, Okoye, and Bucky.
"I've been rewired twice and still manage to get back to the same person I was before I fell off that train," he spits back at me.
I race over to Pietro and take Ras in my arms holding him tightly to my chest while buckled into a seat next to Laura. Steve tries to keep control of the jet as much as he can but looses it when we hit the tip of a tree. The jet starts spinning out of control plummeting towards the ground, I feel Laura's arms wrap around my shoulders pulling me closer to her chest. We hit the ground hard, causing the jet to flip multiple times until we crash into another tree. Steve slowly gets up from the pilot seat and walks towards us helping everyone out of the jet.
I walk into the kitchen and see Laura sitting on the bar stool talking to Clint as he feeds Nathaniel, who's sitting on the counter in front of them.
He turns around slowly at the last two words, I am able to see the confusion, sorrow, and hurt in his eyes. I walk over to the gun rack and pick up a practice set of arrows and the matching bow and head over to the open range beside him.
"Dad," I ask walking over to him, "why are you here? Please don't tell me it involved Pietro in some way."
I feel the blush raising on the back of my neck. I have to tell him now. I mean I could try and lie but I just know that the blush now raising faster will give me away.
"James, when we land," I say, ignoring the small confused look from him, "I'm pretty sure they're going to be happy to see us. I mean in reality you saved me. Dad doesn't seem to understand that, but I'll make sure that everyone on that farm will."
