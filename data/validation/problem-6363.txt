Steve’s look turned coy.  God, he could flip that on and off like a switch.  It made Tony a little dizzy sometimes.  He never knew what he was going to get when it came to Steve.  He loved that.  It was infuriating sometimes, but he loved it.
Steve nodded. His hands rested on Tony’s thighs and slid along them, the denim smooth under his palms. “I know, Tony. Me too.”
He couldn’t write “I love you”.  He wanted to, but he had no illusions about what would happen to this note, and he couldn’t stand to think of those words being balled up like so much trash.
staring. He couldn’t help it. He stared a lot. Whenever Tony was in the room, he couldn’t help but stare.
“Well, yeah, actually,” Steve said, surprising both Natasha and Tony. Surprising himself a little, too. “I mean, it’s simple. Effective. Smart.” He shrugged, his face coloring again under their combined scrutiny. “I’m impressed.”
“Speaking of dragging people to things they probably didn’t want to see in the first place,” Tony said. “Are you sure you can’t go with me tomorrow? I don’t want to go alone.”
“There’s nothing to talk about, Tony,” Steve insisted. “Nothing’s changed. Everything’s okay, so there’s nothing to talk about.” He felt Tony’s muscles tense. Felt him getting frustrated. But Steve didn’t want to talk about anything hard right now. He didn’t. He just wanted this quiet for a little while. He just wanted what Tony had promised him--a day to run away. From everything. He wanted it. “Please?” he said quietly. “Tony, please? Can we talk about it later?”
“Right,” Steve said lightly. “And besides, I can’t really reward you for bad behavior, can I? How will you ever learn if I do that?"
Tony smiled.  Balance was restored.  He took his wallet out of his pocket.  “Here, kid,” he said, pawing through it.
His hands tried to move to grasp Tony’s, but he resisted. He couldn’t touch him. If he did, this would be over. He’d give in. He’d do whatever Tony wanted, and the second that happened, he would be lost. And so would Tony. Steve would drag him down with him instead of letting him fly, and he couldn’t do that. He wouldn’t. “I don’t want us to make any promises,” he said. “If we don’t make any promises, then neither of us can break one.”
“There was...talk,” Steve said.  “You know how stuff gets around.  Somebody heard from somebody else.  You know.  Like that.”
“What happened?” Steve asked, his eyes flitting around the room.  “Where are…” He stopped, and Tony saw everything come back to him.  His eyes cleared, and he clutched Tony’s arms with strong fingers.  “Wanda.  Where’s Wanda?”
Steve kissed him again, then started to stand. Tony pulled him back down, wrapped him up in his arms again. He kissed his mouth, then his cheek. “Take care of yourself over there,” he whispered.
Tony threw his head back and rolled his eyes with all the flair of a silent-age actress in a penny-dreadful.  “You’re killing me, Steve.  Seriously.  Stop being so insecure about this chair.  I don’t even see it.”
Steve hit the wall where Tony had been, and Tony lashed out with his feet again, planting both in Steve’s side.  He felt a rib break under his heel, and Steve collapsed onto his left side, the razor still held tight in his fist.
So, they touched more, they laughed more, they fucked more, they fought more, they did everything they could to distill
The car went fast--as fast as the 'Cuda--and Steve liked to drive it as fast as it would go.  With the top down, it was almost like flying. He didn't tell Tony that. Didn't tell him how often he punched the gas pedal to the floor, and just let it ride at the highest speeds, on the loneliest roads, just feeling the wind on his face, whipping through his hair, the motor loud and comforting, the good scent of sun-warm leather and burning leaves, or apple blossoms, or coming rain surrounding him, but he did it a lot.
you dress up for me, I’m taking thousands. Literally thousands. I’m gonna have Jarvis clear out data-banks for all the pictures I’m going to take.”
“Um,” he said, fidgeting a little with the frayed cuff of his denim jacket. “Um, you know, you really don’t need to do this. It’s okay.” He ducked his head, trying to get away from the watchful look on Tony’s face. “I don’t really need that much help anyway. Sam’s just a...well, kind of a mother-hen sometimes.” He took a couple steps back toward the door. “I’m just gonna go. Thanks, you know, for the offer, but, I’m just-”
Tony's hand was wrapped around his own cock, stroking it, but not too fast.  He wanted this to go on for awhile. For as long as they could both hold out.  His eyes were closed, his teeth were closed as well, biting into his lower lip.  He was concentrating only on this, only on the mounting pleasure, the mounting heat between them.
Sick anger rolled over him, making Tony weak in the knees.  If he hadn’t been leaning so fully against his guy, he would have collapsed.  “Are you telling me they kept you drugged for an entire
Tony ordered steaks through the butcher in town.  1 ½ inches thick, Kobe Wagyu rib eyes.  He read that in Japan, they rubbed the cows with sake or something.  Whatever the reason, he paid out the ass for them.  He hoped they were worth it.
The half-smile shot an arrow through Tony’s heart, lodging it deep.  Tony only barely kept the wince of pain off his face.
Steve drew in a breath.  So.  That’s how it was.  He’d known it would come to this.  He’d told Tony.
“Yeah, I do.  Because if I’m with her then that means I don’t get you, and frankly, that’s not an option for me.  And that other stuff?”  He shrugged.  “It’s a fair trade.”
Clint nudged him again. “Word of advice?” he said. “Stop thinking. Start doing.” He ate another chip and called, “Cap! Tony’s hungry.”
Steve and Tony did the dishes, and when they were done, Tony picked Morgan up and hugged Sarah good-bye one-handed.
“Goodnight, baby,” he whispered almost without realizing it, then turned over, away from the side that was not Steve’s and closed his eyes.
“I said Howard would be disgusted by your behavior.  He never agreed with your life-choices, but this is beyond anything he ever even considered.”
“Report!” he shouted, barely hearing himself through the ringing and that shrieking, organic sound that wouldn’t stop, but seemed to cycle up and down, as if something or someone was pausing just long enough to take a breath. But that couldn’t be. Christ, he hoped that couldn’t be. “Barnes! Manelli! Report!”
When he was done--when they were all done--they went back down to the church and watched Bucky and Nat climb into their waiting car. The reception hall wasn’t far. Steve walked. He didn’t have a car. He had finally gotten a license, but he still didn’t see the point in driving. Not here, anyway.
Finally, after what seemed like a very long time, Howard leaned forward again. He picked up his pen and one of the papers. “If that’s the way you want it,” he said.
“No,” Steve said, and leaned back against the bar. He flicked his gaze to Josh, then back to Tony. “You go. I’ll just watch you.” Tony’s hand was still on his arm. Steve had not touched him, had not even made an attempt other than the prematurely-terminated hug, but now he let his thumb graze along the smooth, delicate skin on the underside of Tony’s arm. Tony drew in a sharp breath at the touch, but he didn’t move away. “I’ll be here when you’re done.”
Tony shifted a bit, responding even in his sleep, his fingers moving to brush along Steve’s muscled forearm. He hummed as he pressed closer into Steve’s chest.
Steve looked at him, those eyes so dangerous, so innocent, the juxtaposition between the two making him dizzy with mad desire and a wild need to protect him.
Tony pulled him down, kissing his mouth.  “I know.  Trust me, I know.  But I want to.  Don’t you want to?”
When he wasn’t at the Compound or sitting in on one of the survivor’s meetings, he took long rides on his motorcycle.  He looped through the streets or out through the countryside, the engine roaring in his ears.  He tried not to think during these rides, so, just like before, he thought the entire time.  What to do about Thanos.  How to get their people back.  Who they could trust.  He thought of all these things, going over them obsessively, fitting them together like pieces of a puzzle, trying to make them fit into a picture he could understand, trying to turn them into a plan.  They were close to one.  Scott and Bruce had ideas and theories, but it had not solidified yet.  They were close, but close wasn’t a plan.  There could be no victory without a plan.
It lay in Tony’s arms, green eyes glaring at Steve, its ears flat.  FRIDAY could say what she wanted, but those eyes were filled with hatred.  Oh, it was coming off him in waves.  Steve glared back.  The feeling was mutual.
“Hey,” he whispered into Steve’s ear. He kissed his temple, dragged his nails gently over his back. “Are you okay?” Steve nodded against him, his arms still holding him tight. Tony kissed his temple again. “You’re shaking.”
Tony shook his head again, but this time, he paired it with a horrified face that would have made the pickiest of five-year-olds proud. “
Ross held it out, butt-first, and she took it gingerly, a look of disgust on her face.  She didn’t like guns.  Tony could relate.
turned, and then there was just the quiet of the apartment. The city noise barely bled through, and why should it? This was a quiet street. Even at ten o’clock on a Saturday night, it was a quiet street. That was part of the reason why they lived here. So Bucky could have some quiet. He liked the quiet after what had happened. Tony wondered if Steve liked the quiet too, then realized what a stupid question that was. Of course, he liked the quiet. He always had. Even before living in a combat zone for so many years.
Tony jumped into the ‘Cuda, keyed the engine, and sped toward home.  He was supposed to bring pizza, but this was a small town and it was a Tuesday night.  Even the most die-hard place closed at ten.  He felt bad, but he was sure it would be fine.  Steve would understand.
. He just couldn’t seem to help himself. He’d been in New York for six months. Morgan came at Christmas and was staying through the rest of the school year. That was what they’d decided, he and Pepper. School years with Tony in New York, summers with Pep in L.A. Every other weekend and alternating holidays--Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter--and video calls whenever Morgan wanted. It seemed like the best situation, and Tony was ecstatic that he was getting the better end of the deal since he got her for more months out of the year.
Steve started toward them then, moving easily, hair glinting in the sun, skin smooth and pale. Tony sucked in a breath, and Clint squeezed his shoulder again. “Ask him,” he said, and then he walked away, leaving Tony standing there, waiting. As he passed Steve, Clint said, “All yours, hot stuff,” and casually smacked Steve’s ass. Steve jumped a little, shaking his head and laughing under his breath. His cheeks pinked alarmingly fast.
She smiled at him. Just a natural, friendly smile, and it put him at ease for the first time since walking through the door. “You probably want R and D,” she said. “That’s where Mr. Stark spends most of his time.” She typed something on her computer. “I’m not sure if he’s here today,” she went on. “He usually works out of the L.A. office.”
he? But he was too tired. His heart too sore. “You’re unbelievable, do you know that?” he asked. “This whole ‘dear-old-dad’ routine you’ve got going on here? It’s bullshit. Right? Why would you think I’d be at all interested in that? Carol’s a secret softie, but Rhodey’s the one who’s got it right here, Howard. We’ve got nothing to say to each other. You should just go. Okay? Just go.”
He leaned in to kiss him, sucking Steve’s bruised bottom lip into his own mouth, then sat up.  One hand still touched his chest, ghosting lightly, so, so lightly over the skin, the other stroked Steve’s cheek until he opened his eyes.  His pupils were huge, eating up nearly all the blue, turning them into black pools that were almost too deep to look into.  It seemed dangerous, like one glance into them would make a man fall.  Fall and drown.
Steve looked at each of them in turn, beginning and ending with Tony.  “Why do we need private?” he asked, and Tony slid closer, as close as he could get.  His thumb caressed Steve’s with one hand, the other cupped the back of Steve’s neck.
Steve folded Tony’s fingers into his own, removing them from the frame, and held them against his chest. Tony could feel his heart beating. Pounding beneath his hand. “I don’t want to talk about that,” Steve said quietly. “Not right now.”
Righteous anger bloomed in Tony’s chest.  “Don’t you dare talk to me about unethical.  You people are using a fucking parlor trick as treatment, and when you don’t have him performing like a show pony for all your doctor pals, you’re keeping him chained up like a goddamn rabid pit-bull.”
Steve fidgeted, barely keeping his thumb from his mouth.  He’d been doing better.  The nail, while still brutally short, had started to grow back and Steve tried to keep it neat.  Tony didn’t say anything about it, didn’t want to draw attention to the face that he’d even noticed.  Steve’s pride was a delicate thing, sometimes.  Tony didn’t want to accidentally hurt it.
“Oh my god,” Tony sighed, sinking further into the chair, giggling. And when was the last time he had giggled? Had he ever giggled? “Does he know?”
“Yes,” she said simply.  “We don’t talk about it.  It’s just there.”  She sighed.  “He loves me too, you know.  Maybe not in the same way, but just as much.  He’d die for me.”
But he could get through it. It would be fine. He could get out of this. He could put any impure thoughts about the kid to the side. It would be easy. He just had to focus. Focus on the rules, the guidelines, the policies that dealt with things like this. It shouldn’t be a problem. And if it
“It’s Colonel Rhodes, Mr. Stark.”  The tentativeness was gone.  She was relieved.  Purely, painfully relieved.  “That’s nice, isn’t it?” she asked.  “He’s here to see you.”
“And that’s what you would have kept telling yourself,” Steve said placidly. “No matter how many people you met at your school, or at Stark Industries, or at the parties and stuff you’d go to for work. No matter that they were all smart like you. And you had way more in common with them. And they fit in with your life better than I ever could. You’d still tell yourself, ‘But I love him. I can’t leave him. I love him.’”
“Well, let’s just-” he began, and then moved to hug him. At the same time, Steve put his hand out to shake. They both stopped, laughed a little, then Steve went for a hug the exact same time Tony tried to shake hands.
Wanda took the man’s cap and laid it gently over his eyes.  He looked like a kid all tuckered out from a day at the beach.  “All I saw was a young boy and a woman sharing a cookie at a kitchen table,” she said.  “It was probably his mother.”
“I’ll get it, Mom,” he called back, softly so he didn’t wake Sam. He touched Morgan’s hair. “Be right back, okay? Then we’ll color?”
He stopped talking and slumped against the door. Tony followed him, keeping his hold on his waist, not lifting his head from Steve’s chest. Steve raised one hand tentatively and put it on Tony’s hip. “Okay,” he breathed, as if admitting a great sin. “That’s a lie. I haven’t tried. I haven’t tried at all.”
He moved closer, and now he could see the hard, stubborn look in Steve’s eyes, and he braced himself because he’d seen it before.  More than once.  “I know that look,” he said.  “Tell me what’s on your mind.”
Steve laughed, his thumb began to move, slipping across his hip in soft, small arcs.  “Same old Tony,” he said.  “You’ll never change, will you?”
Steve went to the door. He assumed it was Bucky and Nat. Everybody else he knew was already here. At least everybody who would show up at his mother’s door at almost ten o’clock on a Saturday night. But it wasn’t.
eight.  And Steve knew he wouldn't even get that long.  He knew how he was feeling. He could feel the weakness creeping in.  The ache in his knee--and now his hands too--he used to get only on cold mornings, was now a low constant.  He could see a new line on his face occasionally. A new gray hair.
“It doesn’t matter,” Steve said, and while his voice was not hard, it was final. “I’ve made it so it doesn’t matter. I just don't get close to anybody. If I don't get close, then it will never matter.”
Tony turned to look at him. Steve’s voice had been light, easy, sounding just like always. He looked just like always now too. Maybe a little flushed, and the tail of his t-shirt was pulled out, covering the bulge in his jeans, but he was smiling that little lopsided smile that meant everything was fine. Everything was fine, and nothing was wrong, and there were rainbows outside and maybe unicorns were real after all.
He sat his glass down and started down the bar. Nat grabbed his hand and pulled him back. “Better let it be, Steve,” she said. “No harm done.”
His breath caught in his throat, but he closed his eyes and worked through it. Quickly. Efficiently. When he could breathe again, he smiled and kissed her cheek one more time. “See you soon.”
The room filled up with people as the time passed.  Steve knew some of them--Bruce and Natasha. Peter, May, and Happy, a couple people from Stark Industries he had met over the years.  But there were a lot he didn't know, too. A lot who were strangers to him, but seemed to know Rhodey or Pepper. They went to them and embraced them, kissed them, held them.  Pepper let them cry on her shoulder. Rhodey shook a lot of hands, accepted a lot of pats on the arm or shoulder.
Tony pressed closer, and Steve wondered just where the hell this had come from. What the hell was going on. He didn’t date. He’d
They were standing so close, the heat between them a palpable thing.  Tony felt it too this time, there was no denying it.  It was in his eyes, a simmering look like molten lava, and in his skin.  The muscles trembled under Steve’s grasp.  Steve swallowed.  “Okay, Tony,” he said.  “Anything you want.”
He closed his eyes, letting the wall hold him up, waiting for his shakes to subside. When they finally did, he gulped his coffee in three large swallows. It helped. Helped ease his mind a little. And when he remembered to breathe, it came out steady. That helped too.
under his breath when he saw a dog’s face two inches from his own. He might be having a dream. Tony thought that was entirely possible. He closed his eyes again. Or maybe that was part of the dream. Maybe he dream-opened them in the first place, and they had been closed all along. The fact that there was a
Tony sat in a bright bar of sunshine, sunglasses on even indoors, a cup of coffee and a Danish by his hand.  The diner was low-key and mellow most of the time, and now in the three o’clock lull between lunch and dinner, it was deserted.
“Yes, sir,” he said with absolutely no trace of sarcasm.  As if he were addressing a superior officer.  Tony supposed he was.
“You. Are. Not. Crazy,” Tony said firmly. “Do I think you should talk to somebody? Yeah. I do. Are we going to talk about making you an appointment first thing Monday morning? Hell yes. But there is no way I’m going to let you go just because of
Suddenly, Steve was very angry at himself. There was something wrong. That was obvious. Something was wrong, and Steve had just left him alone. Had given up after two texts and two phone calls.  What kind of person was he? What kind of friend? Selfish. Thad
“Baby,” he moaned, latching onto his neck, sucking at it, biting with little nips that stung just the right amount. “I want...I want to…
Tony giggled, clasping his knees tight around Steve’s slim hips. The drag against his cock was almost unbearable. “She might be. I might have to work up to her.”
“I also had to keep him sedated for part of the time.  Especially at night.  His nightmares were extraordinarily pronounced.”
He stopped in Morgan’s room first. Her night light was on, and she lay in a sprawl on the bed, pink lips parted, covers kicked off again. Steve shook his head, smiling a little. She must get that from Pepper. Tony slept either huddled against Steve’s side or curled into a tight ball, blankets locked securely--sometimes too securely. He was a blanket-thief--around himself.
“But, if we do this,” she said, her voice small, “how can he come back to us?  How can he come home?”
The thought gave him a little jolt because since the party on the fifteenth, he had been up to the pool exactly zero times. He knew Clint had used it. Nat too, probably, but he himself had not used it at all. In fact, he had kind of forgotten it was there. But now, sitting here in his hot office, wearing his hot--in more ways than one, thank you, Dolce & Gabbana--suit, the pool was pretty much
“No,” Tony said, and went to him.  “No, baby.  No.  I’m sorry.  This is all me.”  He put his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed his cheek.  Steve sat still, not moving, a troubled look on his face.  Tony kissed him again.  “I’m sorry.”  Again.  “Forgive me, ‘kay?”  Again.  Again.  “Please, baby?  Please forgive me?” He kissed him again and again, covering his face and necks with kisses until Steve finally smiled.
“I’m not shy,” Tony protested.  His mouth was dry.  He was hard.  His face flamed.  “I’m just not sure I want to get off in front of a whole room full of people.  Even
“And I know you,” Tony went on, holding his hand tighter. “We haven’t talked in a while, but I know you. You always put everybody ahead of yourself. Everybody. Your mom. Sam. Me. Fucking
“Tony? Do you think, since it’s just for today, that we could...pretend everything’s okay? Between us, I mean? Do you think we could pretend that nothing’s changed?”
Tony sighed and smiled sadly.  “I’m really not.  You know, I get that you don’t want to feel like you’re one of my ‘causes’,” he said, looking into the sea-blue depths of Steve’s eyes, “but the thing is, baby, I kind of like being one of yours.”
Steve sighed, and when he did, his face softened, that frown that had strained his features all night long, finally eased. When it did, he looked young again at last. Tony couldn’t help but grin at that, and Steve smiled back, rolling his eyes a little. “When are you ever just gonna give up on me, huh?”
“Really. I probably won’t...talk, ’cause it’s still hard for me to do that. Even in the closed meetings, it’s still hard for me. I’ve had a lot of ups and downs with this. More than I like to admit to. I’m getting better, but it’s still hard for me.” Tony put his hand on the back of Steve’s neck. His cool, soothing hand. “So, yeah. I might not talk, but I’d love it if you went with me. I’d love having you on my side.”
Pietro sighed and came to where Steve stood by the door, keys in his hand. “Honey,” he said in a slow, firm voice, “I can’t. I’m sorry, but your mom will be okay. She was just a neighbor.”
He turned down both sides and went into the kitchen for a glass of water.  It was strange for him to be so nervous.  Ordinarily, he’d just go leap into the bed, right in the middle, and let Steve roll him to whichever side he wanted, but that wouldn’t work here.
It was easy to get used to. He usually preferred to sleep in dark silence, but he got to where he strained to hear the sounds through the wall. He could never tell what they were saying, or even if there was one, or two, or even three different voices, but it got to be almost a comfort to him. Almost something he looked forward to.
They found them in the lobby coffee shop.  Both had cups of tea.  A plate with four muffins sat untouched in the middle of the table.  Bruce tapped away on his tablet.  Steve sat hunched inside his jacket, studying his hands.  He looked up as Tony came near.
Tony opened the door, and pointed down the hallway. Steve carried Morgan to her bedroom. It was a happy room. All yellow and red and pictures she’d colored tacked to the wall. It made Steve feel good just being in here.
Steve ran a hand through his hair.  He sighed harshly. Why was his stomach so upset?  He knew the answers. He had studied really hard. Tony had helped him, going over character lists, quizzing him on quotations and definitions. He'd made him cup after cup of espresso--that Steve dutifully drank even though he didn't want to--then, when Steve started getting tired and irritable, took him by the hand and led him into the bedroom.  He laid him down on the bed, told him not to move--that he wasn't
Tony laughed again.  “Wow.  I’d be mad at you if this wasn’t so adorable.”  He squeezed Steve’s waist, then took his hand.  “Okay.  I can’t believe I’m saying this, but you two need to make up.”  He pulled Steve to the table where Sir Purr sat.  “Pet him.”
Tony stalked forward.  His mind was a whirlwind.  If anyone had ever told him he’d be having this conversation, he would have laughed in their face.  “No.  I’m not telling you that.  But I am telling you I was smart enough to stop.”
“Tease!” Tony called up the stairs, then went into the bedroom.  He didn’t slam the door behind him, but it was a very near thing.
desperate. “Yes, you can, Steve,” he said. “You can. I need it.” He kissed him again. And again, and again, speaking between kisses. “And you told me you’d love me forever. Remember? Remember that? I need to hear it again, baby. I need to know if you were telling the truth.”
He heard himself stammering. The fact that he himself had been planning on doing the very thing he was pretty sure Steve had just said he was doing was not lost on him. “I-I-wh-Excuse me,
Here's the last of it.  Sorry it's a little late. I rewrote it 4 times.  Still not sure I'm 100% happy, but I will never be completely happy, so here it is!
Tony laughed darkly. “I’m sure,” he said, and slid his hands across Steve’s stomach to edge under his shirt, finally--
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, and stood up. He picked up the ticket their server had laid on the table after refilling their coffee. “Yeah. Let’s go.”
However, neither Morgan nor the dog had those issues. She grabbed Tony’s hand and tugged on it. “Daddy,” she said again. “I want to pet the dog. Can I pet the dog?”
Tony surged forward and kissed him long and hard. Steve kissed back, but he couldn’t help the way he smiled through the whole thing, keeping it from growing too heated, but making that feeling--that
“You could take one of us back to the dumpsters,” Steve said.  “I’m sure somebody will come and pick
Tony didn’t notice. His thoughts were still on Steve. “It’s not for me,” he said, eyes still roving over the watches in the case. It was hard, because everything was beautiful. Everything was pristine. Everything in the shop was something that he might have chosen for himself, but nothing was right for Steve.
“I can’t believe that piece of shit Ross, calling them back.  They were supposed to be on leave until the tenth.”
Tony raised his free hand to Steve’s cheek. He rested his palm against it, ran his thumb across his cheekbone. Steve’s eyes fell closed, and beneath the hand still resting on his chest, Tony felt his heart speed up even more. “Okay,” Tony said. “We don’t have to, baby. We don’t have to talk about anything you don’t want to talk about.”
Tony stood up.  He hadn’t said anything in a long time, and his face was dark, his brow furrowed, mouth turned down as he studied Steve with an intensity that almost made him uncomfortable.
Steve looked at him sharply.  Tony shrugged.  Natasha had told him of their relationship, and the more he saw them together, the more true it became, but Steve was looking at him in a way that suggested he had never thought of it that way.  Or, at least, had never dared to hope he
He didn’t realize he had been waiting for Natasha until she padded into the kitchen.  She was still wearing his t-shirt, khaki-green with US ARMY across the front, but she had slipped on a pair of pants at some point during the morning.  Her face was innocent of make-up, but her nails were still the dark red they had been the night before.  Her feet were bare.
That alert feeling intensified, and Steve would not have been surprised to discover he was now standing at attention. His eyes dark, mouth firm, jaw clenching rhythmically. “What do you mean? He’s here. He has to be someone’s cargo.”
Steve turned the volume down, then sat back, uncertainty speeding up his heart.  He should wake Tony up and send him to bed.  FRIDAY could keep watch and let Steve know that he’d gotten to his room alright.  There’d be no need to stand him up and put an arm around him and help him down the hall himself.  No need to lay him back then kneel and untie his shoes and toss them into a dark corner.  No need to slip him between cool sheets, and certainly no need to slip between them himself.  The fact that every inch of him cried out for him to do all of those things did not make them necessary.
The kid hitched in a breath, held it, then let it out. “Okay. But this really has to be the last one.”
Even though Steve had been very much on his mind--almost overwhelmingly so--during this whole encounter, Tony realized it was the first time either of them had mentioned him.  He wondered how much
“Buck,” he said, putting his hand on the side of Bucky’s face. He put it on the right side, avoiding the blistered skin on the left. “Bucky, listen to me. Listen. You’re gonna be okay. Okay? I’m gonna take care of you. Listen to me, soldier, you’re gonna be okay.” He spoke loudly but gently, his other hand digging through his pack by touch alone, searching for a tourniquet.
Tony clung to him and nodded. His tears were hot, dark, and so very painful. “Yeah, baby,” he said, ignoring how much it sounded like a sob. “Yeah. One more night. One more night for both of us. Okay?”
“They’ll be fine.  They’re all just taking a little nap.  They’ll all wake up in the morning fresh as daisies, right, sweetie?”
Steve laughed, and put his arms around Tony’s waist and held him tightly. He closed his eyes and just held him, breathing him in. He hummed a little as Tony slipped his hands through his hair, still brushing his lips along his neck.
Steve bowed his head, breathing deeply. Tony waited, letting him think, letting him decide for sure what it was he wanted. He knew what
“No,” Steve said.  It seemed very loud in the quiet lab.  Tony looked at him, surprised.  Steve looked back.  “No, FRIDAY, don’t,” he went on.  “Please.  Keep it as Tony.”
She swept out of the room, leaving the door open.  Ross watched her go, his mouth twisted into a knowing smile.  “Well,” he said, “you can certainly tell who she spent time with, can’t you, Stark?”
“No, no, no, baby,” Tony soothed, touching those vertical worry lines between Steve’s brows.  “You died.  You’re off the hook.”
match. And when he was gone,” Steve felt her shrug against him, “I didn’t want to be with somebody just to
He didn’t think that was why he’d started having nightmares again though. There was no rhyme or reason to those. They just showed up, stayed for a few days, then went on their way like an unwelcome house-guest. But unfortunately, this time, it seemed like they’d decided to move in and bar the door behind them.
about it. Fought, talked, whatever. It all came down to the same thing--Pietro didn’t want to deal with him being in the army anymore.
“Whoa,” Tony said, holding up a hand. And he thought his head was reeling before. That was a quiet little merry-go-round in a kiddie play-park compared to the tornado that was raging now. “What?”
Tony plucked at the sleeve of his t-shirt.  “Come over here,” he said.  “I think I owe you one or two goodnight kisses.”
Not that it mattered. “We cater to the discerning, style-minded gentleman here” the salesman sniffed, proving to Tony exactly who the elitist dick in the room really was. “We don’t carry ‘utilitarian’.”
He turned on his heel and started down toward the parking lot. He didn’t have a car, but the bus stop was only a few blocks away. He didn’t mind riding the bus. It was okay. Even though they were loud and cramped and usually smelled like piss and unwashed socks, he didn’t mind. It gave him time to think on his way home. Time to put the day away before he got home to his mother. She needed him. Ever since his dad died, his mother had needed him. He didn’t mind that, either. He knew he was different from most of the people in his class. Knew that his priorities were different, but that was okay. He’d always been a little different. Never quite fit in. With anybody. He was too poor for the rich kids, not smart enough for the smart kids, not aggressive enough for the athletes, and not high enough for the “cool” kids. The only person he’d ever fit in with was Tony. And it was pretty obvious where that left him now.
Steve ducked his head.  He could feel a red blush creeping out of the collar of his shirt.  He got the juice back out of the fridge.  He didn’t really want any more, but he needed something to do with his hands.  He could feel Tony pointedly not looking at him as he poured his own cup of coffee.  An awkwardness had crept into the room when Tony entered and his first instinct was to get away from it, but he straightened his spine.  He could do this.  It was just Tony.
Steve pushed the elevator button.  It opened and he stepped inside.  “L” for Lobby.  It was blue, that button.  He pushed it.
August, after all--but that didn’t make it any easier to take. He thought, on some level, that the heat shouldn’t bother him anymore. Not after so long in the desert, but it did. In fact, since coming back to America, he thought he suffered more from the heat than he ever had before, even while he lived in Afghanistan.
Then they all laughed, even Steve, although his face stayed brilliantly red, especially when Tony caught his eye, winked, then hooked his ankle around Steve’s underneath the table.
Tony lay in bed for a minute, listening hard for any indication of where Steve was, but heard nothing.
When Mrs. Perkins was gone, Steve told Sarah how sorry he was. How sorry he was that he hadn’t told her what he had done. That he was sorry he hadn’t asked her what she thought.
“Come here,” he said, and pulled Tony closer.  He kissed his forehead, his cheekbone, then his lips, lingering just a moment before pulling away.
Steve turned the chair around and Tony gripped the handles.  Steve sighed, and Tony dropped a kiss on top of his head.
And it was a long morning. A long morning making pancakes and Denver omelettes and frying bacon by the truckful. His eyes kept straying to the clock, watching the hands move from seven o’clock, to eight, to eight-fifty, and then staring hard at the door, waiting for Mr. Stark, wondering just what it was he wanted to talk about, but when the door opened, and the man walked in, Steve felt all his questions fall away. Instead of feeling anxious and nervous when he saw him, all he felt was peace. Because Tony loved him. And Howard smiled when he met his eyes. And Steve had more important things to worry about than what Howard Stark wanted or needed anyway, but he’d still go talk to him.
“Stay and sleep for a little while,” Steve said softly, brushing Tony’s hair back behind his ear. “Mom will be home at eight. She’d like to see you.”
He was turned away, but he’d know those shoulders anywhere, the line of the back, the dark-blond hair just long enough to touch the collar of his jacket.  This guy was standing--
And there was no denying that, Tony found.  No defense against him.  He didn’t reply, just stepped around the chair and pulled himself up onto the vanity.  He settled one foot up, bending the knee and resting his elbow on it.  His other leg hung from the counter, foot not quite touching the floor.
He stopped, breathing a little hard.  Steve still hadn’t said anything, and the nerves were turning into a low-grade panic.  “Steve?”
“It doesn’t matter anymore, Mom,” he said tiredly, and hung his head. “It’s done.” And the finality with which he spoke seemed to zipper her lips together. She had no argument for that, it seemed. She tried, but her mind--grieving her own loss, screaming its pain like a caged jungle cat inside her--simply would not let anything else out. No words of comfort. Or admonition. Or anything else except “Good-night” when he stood, kissed the top of her head, and walked away from her, closing the door to his bedroom gently behind him.
Nat put her hand flat on his chest, stopping him in his tracks.  It was all he could do to not lift her bodily and toss her aside.  He tensed.  She could feel it but kept her hand where it was.
“And nothing,” Bruce said.  “He wouldn’t say anything.  At all, Tony.  He just sat there like a wax figure until they finally woke him up.”
Steve bit his lip. Sergeant Rogers had retreated back into his place inside Steve’s head, leaving Steve to deal with this himself.
“You’re not supposed to be up here,” Tony said. He kept his voice reasonable. Dodger seemed like a reasonable enough dog. Tony was sure if he explained the situation again--that no one of the four-legged variety was allowed on the furniture--that he would hop down and walk away. “I specifically said no dogs on the beds. Remember? You were there. You heard me.”
Steve grabbed the remote control and turned the music off. He looked flustered suddenly, that intense concentration gone. He shoved his brush into a cup of water. “Tony,” he said. “Hey. Umm. You’re home early.”
His hands shook a little as he tried to apply the flame from his lighter to the end of his smoke. He chased it and finally made it, the little ember it made, an orange dot in the darkness. He inhaled and sucked that good, harsh smoke down into his lungs. He held it for a moment, then blew it back out, and through the plume of smoke, he saw Tony come out the door of the bar. Saw him come toward him. He wasn’t wearing a jacket, just his t-shirt with a thin flannel thrown over it. He must have been cold, but he didn’t look cold. Just cool. Just like he always did.
“For as long as I can,” he answered. “Then my mom and dad will. I already talked to them. It’s okay. Don’t worry about that.”
Steve frowned at him, that concentration growing impossibly deeper, boring into Tony’s eyes now instead of the world of his painting. “What do you mean?”
Steve could feel how sunny--sappy--the smile that surfaced on his own face was, but he couldn’t help it. Didn’t really want to help it. “Go team,” he said, and Tony laughed, making everything so much better. So much lighter.
Steve didn’t know about that though. He just liked listening to them talk. Especially like they were doing now. This trash-talk about baseball, and who was the greatest player ever. He liked how passionate they were about it. He liked hearing them play off each other. It reminded him a little of how he and Sam were. And how Tony was. With anybody. With everybody.
mean the most to me, but that one felt like the biggest one. The one I forced myself to get. During that first year, I’d tell myself, ‘Just get to one year. It doesn’t matter what happens after that. Just get to one year’.” He looked down at the coin sitting in Tony’s open palm, then back up at his face. “I don’t feel that way anymore,” he said.
“Yes,” she breathed.  “Thor and Carol and Tony, they brought down lightning and repulsor blasts, and whatever it is that Carol has.  Steve channeled it with the axe and aimed it at
Steve finally looked at the bed.  It was the same.  Tony hadn’t changed that.  Or any of this room.  He still felt it was sacred space.  Their own private sanctuary.
of drinks--and sun, and sand, and Gina in a bikini that was really nothing more than a wisp of fabric barely covering the good parts.
And now, walking up to Mr. Barker’s office, it seemed ironic to him just how right that assessment had been.
“Shh,” Tony said, and cupped Steve’s chin, tilting his head to kiss him. The angle was a bit awkward, but Tony’s tongue was warm, his breath soft on Steve’s mouth. “Everything’s good, baby. Every little thing is just right.”
Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this story. It has meant a lot to me. Your comments have been the highlight of my days since starting this thing, and I am so glad you were all here with me during the writing of this story. I love you all so much! Thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you all!!
Tony shrugged, but his eyes were still very bright. Still very solemn. And that made Steve feel a little better. He liked that Tony was serious right now. He didn’t want to feel like this was a joke. It wasn’t for him. He was glad it wasn’t for Tony either.
Tony smoothed his hand over Steve’s shoulder.  “Still in the jet.  Remember?  I came to pick you up.”
But that would mean he’d have to dislodge his tongue from that other guy’s throat, and that didn’t look like it was going to happen any time soon.
“Fuck those ‘other people’,” Tony flared. “They’re not even real. They’re hypothetical. You’re making them up.”
She opened her mouth to answer, but the sound of a quiet knock on the door stopped her. She looked at Steve. He looked back.
Tony shot Steve a victorious look. Steve rolled his eyes. “We’ll see,” Tony said. “Let’s go get you in your pjs. Say good-night.”
Tony let his fingers wander back up Steve’s chest to touch the knot at his throat again. “Guess you better go.”
Howard Stark from Stark Industries--was sitting on the chair behind Mr. Barker’s cluttered desk. He smiled at Steve. “Come in,” he invited.
Tony laughed, his breath a puff of sweet air against Steve’s palm, and pursed his lips to put a soft kiss there, his eyes never leaving Steve’s. They were lit with an impish light that made Steve’s stomach turn over again and again in a string of somersaults.
Tony put his arms around Steve’s neck and lay pressed up against his back.  “‘Kay.  ‘Kay, I’ll tell you what to write.”
Natasha put her hand on his cheek and turned his face toward hers.  Her eyes were dark and serious as she pulled him closer and pressed her lips against his.  The feel of her mouth was friendly, but it wasn’t exactly the kiss of a friend.  It made him wonder if this morning would have gone a bit differently if she had still been in his bed when he woke up.  It also made him wonder if that was the reason why she had left.
Howard held his hand tightly, cocked his head a little. “You know, someday I’m going to ask you to call me Howard.”
They’d driven around for awhile after leaving the cafe on Saturday afternoon, just listening to music and talking, catching up on some of the years in between eleven and seventeen, then said an awkward, shy, hopeful good-bye when Tony dropped him off in front of his building. They hadn’t talked to each other since, and Steve had spent the rest of the weekend nervous about what would happen on Monday when they inevitably encountered each other at school. He had been afraid they would just go on as they had before, that Tony wouldn’t really want to talk to him in school. Wouldn’t really want to hang around with him where his friends could see. But here he was, looking beautiful and golden in the noon sun coming through the high windows of the building.
“I thought...I thought before you left, you might…” He shrugged. “And then every time I wrote you, I hoped the next letter I got would have them inside.”
“It is,” Steve agreed. “They’re real nice.” He blushed a little, making Tony smile. “The ladies, though...they like to flirt.”
“You’re right,” Tony said, coming up next to Clint.  “It is a public space.  But if you come near my friend again, I’ll call in some favors and find something on you.  Now, I’m sure you upstanding young men don’t have anything serious on your records, but all I really need is an unpaid parking ticket.  Just something to get you detained.”
Steve frowned when it went to voicemail. “Hey,” he said quietly. “Sorry I keep bothering you, I just...It’s okay. Nevermind. I’m sorry. Talk to you later.”
Steve reached back with his other hand, groping in the air, and Tony took it.  Steve squeezed it hard twice, and Tony didn’t have to be a rogue to figure out what it meant.
The back of Tony’s neck prickled with pride and pleasure at being included in a “we” with Jeff.  It was a feeling he hadn’t had in a long time.  Not since Jarvis was alive.
An almost insurmountable need to see her washed over him, but he fought it off.  Clint’s entire family was gone.  Nat was all he had left in this world.  Even if it hurt him, Steve understood.  His own loneliness was nothing new anyway.  It was like his shadow, dark, insubstantial, and constant.  He’d learned to live with it long ago.
Steve propped his chin on Tony’s chest so he could look into his eyes. “What did you mean, then?” he asked. “Who hates us?”
Steve dipped his head and placed a few strategic kisses against Tony’s collarbone before turning his eyes back to Tony. “Which couples? What are you talking about?”
Steve leaned down and kissed him again. It was soft, but long, as if he was imprinting it into his memory. Tony hoped that was what he was doing. He knew that’s what
Steve opened his eyes.  His hand stole out and touched a hole in Tony’s shirt.  Black Sabbath, this time.  Steve hadn’t even tried listening to them, but the shirt he remembered very well.
Tony looked up, feeling guilty. Like he’d been caught red-handed doing something downright dirty. “Yeah?”
“I always meant it,” he said through the light haze of tears he hadn’t even realized was there. “I did a lot of stupid stuff when we were kids. I made a lot of mistakes. And when we got older, I just kept making them.”
For several long moments, there was nothing.  Nothing but their breathing.  Tony began to feel disappointment.  It wasn’t working.  Why wasn’t it working?  He remembered all too well the images Wanda had implanted in his head years ago, why could she not do this now?  Sure, Steve had gotten steadily more stubborn as the years wore on, but Wanda still should have been able to breach his defenses.  Especially since he wasn’t supposed to be defending himself at all.  He was offering himself up, not as a sacrifice, but as a willing participant.  Shouldn’t she have done it by now?  Christ, she was powerful enough to crack an Infinity Stone, but not one grouchy ex-soldier who--
He put his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed him long and hard. His right hand clenched in Steve’s shirt, the left moved restlessly up through his hair, to his neck, his shoulder blade. He licked along the seam of Steve’s lips, and they opened for him, letting him in, his tongue delving deep into his mouth, moving hungrily against Steve’s own.
Steve saw him for the first time out his living room window. He pulled up in a red sports car. An Audi, Steve learned later, although he didn’t know the difference between an Audi, an Astin Martin, and an Acura. It wasn’t his area of expertise. They all just looked like cars to him. Sure, some were flashier than others, but they all had four wheels and some doors, and that’s really all he knew about them, or, frankly, cared to know. The kid, though, probably knew all the differences.
He wiped his eyes then reached down and touched her cheek.  Her eyes opened, and the lights from the city outside the window were just bright enough for them to see each other.
“Since we found all this stuff on Baxter’s computer, she said.  “Tony and I had a bet.  He said there was no
Steve sat back in his seat. The frown stayed on his face. Of all the things that he had expected to come out of Howard Stark’s mouth during this little chat, this had not even cracked the top one hundred. “Um. Okay,” he said. And that was all. His mouth would not cooperate with his brain. He remembered the feeling. He’d had it before, his brain and his body being incommunicado, and here it was again.
Steve must have been satisfied with it too, because he’d signed it.  He’d written a note at the bottom, and it was that note that was the last straw.
Tony’s head snapped toward him.  One tear fell and he scrubbed it away.  “What--” he began then stopped as Natasha appeared in the doorway.  She looked between the two of them, her face carefully neutral as she took in the scene.
He glanced at him now, and saw the way Steve’s eyes moved from place to place. The lake. The flowers. The cabin itself. He saw the way Steve’s lips twitched into a small, pleased smile. Saw how happy he was. And god, if that’s all it took to make Steve happy, Tony was even luckier than he thought he was.
Steve jerked awake.  He winced at the twinge in his lower back.  He was lying half on a bed, half on a chair.  His hands clutched great handfuls of fabric--cheap, lightweight hospital blankets.  Light years from the cloud-like 1000 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets Tony insisted on having in their bed.  From the heavy, warm cocoon of the hand-made quilt that lay over-top those sheets. But it was there, it was
Steve looked away, giving them their moment, and looked up at Tony again.  Tony gazed steadily back, grounding him in this whirlwind of emotion he was lost in.  Giving him something solid to hold onto, and Steve had never loved him more than he did in that moment.  Tony must have felt it, because he drew in a deep breath, blew it out, and cocked his eyebrow at Steve.  Steve grinned at him, utterly lost in his love for him, for Natasha, for Bruce, and Clint, and everyone else around them.  His family.
The place was busy, but not packed.  People wanting a quick bite before Christmas dinner, or picking up trays of cold-cuts and cheese to serve as appetizers for their guests.  One or two lonely souls who were obviously taking their sandwiches back to their apartments to eat a solitary meal in lieu of a family gathering.
, in fact, that he would.  Not because Steve had anything to prove, but because he wanted the challenge, wanted the fight.  And he knew he’d win.  Because, of course he would.  He would accept nothing less.  Nothing less than perfection on his part and complete surrender on his opponent’s.
Actually, he had committed it all to memory the second time through. He could pilot the damn thing if he needed to, let alone know where the armory was.  But Tony didn't need to know that.
the familiar, intoxicating scent of him--the same cheap aftershave.  Tony hadn’t even realized they still made it until he and Steve moved into the cabin and it showed up on Steve’s side of the vanity.  Skin Bracer.  Tony remembered the commercials from his childhood, couldn’t help the way the tag-line sang through his head every time he saw the bottle:  Byyy
, he belonged there. Tony had always known it. It was what he had always wanted. Always hoped for. And after all this time, Steve was there.
Steve watched him go, then reached across the table and took a pinch of the spilled salt in his fingers.  He tossed it over his shoulder.  They’d need all the luck they could get.
“You were,” Tony insisted.  “If I’d been around back in the day, I would have scooped you up like that,” he said, snapping his fingers.  It was the first time he’d done that since Thanos.  He was glad he’d done it here, lying secure in Steve’s arms.  It didn’t hurt as much as it could have if he’d done it anywhere else.
.  And every time I think something might--”  He yanked his arm out of Tony’s grip and shook his head.  “But I was wrong then, and I’m wrong now.  It doesn’t matter.  Forget it.”
A not-quite-comfortable silence fell between them as Jerry readied the jet for take-off.  The sound of the engine cycled louder, and they began to move.  They’d been in a lot of aircraft together, and Tony’s eyes fell to Steve’s hands as they took off.  They dug into the armrests, just like they always did.  Tony wasn’t sure why it happened.  Whether it was a reflex, or a fear, or even a pre-orgasmic throe, all he knew was that it always happened.  Maybe everything
“Yes.”  Hunt reached over to his desk and picked up a framed photo.  He handed it to Steve.  It showed three young girls, all cute little brunettes, probably seven, nine, and twelve, if Steve guessed correctly.  “These are my daughters,” Hunt said.  “They were all taken from me during The Incident.”  Steve looked up quickly, catching Hunt’s damp eyes.  “You brought them back to me, Captain.”
“He’s got a free ride to NYU, but there’s always extras the scholarship won’t cover,” May said, squeezing Peter.  “Thank you.”
“Sorry, honey. I was talking to Steve.” Tony flicked his hand back and forth between them. “Steve, Josh. Josh, Steve.”
But after three months, the cars were done.  The speed boats stopped appearing on the lake.  The City Council and The Lions only met once per month.  The bed felt too big with just him in it, and there were never very many dishes to wash.  He still enjoyed the bowling, but sometimes the guys brought their wives or their girlfriends to watch.  It was hard being the only guy without somebody on the team.  Hard being the only guy without somebody, period.
Tony carried her away, and Dodger got to his feet and followed, leaving Steve alone in the living room. He folded the blanket Tony had tossed over Morgan halfway through the movie and laid it across the back of the couch, then reached out to toy with the bottles of nail polish, his fingers sorting them automatically by color. While he did, he thought about the evening they’d had, the three of them together. How it had felt from the first moment when Morgan had hugged him at the door. How that feeling had just gotten bigger and bigger, filling in the empty places inside him, lighting him up, almost taking him over. He hadn’t had a name for it at first, but now, sitting here in this quiet room, he thought he knew what it was.
A flicker of something--disagreement? disapproval?--moved over Steve’s face, then he was still.  “To be fair, I didn’t make it easy to like me,” Tony said, watching Steve closely.  “I did a lot of stupid things.  I hung out with a lot of stupid people.  I thought I was smarter than he was, and I shoved it in his face every chance I got.”  Tony sighed.  “I was a real dick.”
He straightened further, his spine stiffening, his chin tilting up. “I’m not a novelty act, Mr. Stark,” Sergeant Rogers said. “I’m not here to entertain you.”
“It’s okay,” Nat said.  “Let them have this.”  Bucky nodded mutely, and she folded his hand into hers.
“Because of whatever I did,” Steve said. “Did I say something? I didn’t mean to make you sad. Or mad. Or-”
He ordered a glass of whiskey, and sipped it slowly, savoring the burn of it in his throat. He’d started drinking a little more lately, and he liked the burn. He liked to feel that slow heat as it slid down his throat and bloomed in his stomach. It felt good. And sitting there, quiet in his little world, he felt something else too.
“They kept it up,” Steve said, his voice pained.  “When I went to The Raft.  They just dosed me more.  Every day.  Except when Doctor Strange was coming, then they stopped.  After he left, they’d start again.”
Steve closed his eyes, a pained expression on his face.  “Fucking Clint,” he muttered, and Tony laughed.
He nodded at Gina, his smile only faltering a little, then he left, using his cane, but walking upright, his shoulders up and back, spine straight, head up.
Sam sat back in the booth, quiet for a moment.  Tony had the feeling he was gearing up for something, and he waited.  He wanted to hear what he had to say.  Not only because of the way he looked when he spoke, either.  When Sam spoke, it was for a reason.  He wasn’t a bullshit type of guy.  He was like Steve that way.  Tony admired it.  Envied it a little.  He, himself,
He went down to the shop around one. Fury wanted schematics, Pepper wanted mock-ups, and expense reports, and run-downs on the Asian markets, and blahblahblah. Just another day. He made another pot of coffee. Steve wouldn’t like it--he didn’t mind the morning cup, but after that he frowned strenuously on coffee--but it would be mostly gone before Steve ever even knew about it. Tony didn’t think of it as
again. Steve held his hand tighter, squeezing it brutally, grinding the bones together. Tony wouldn’t have had it any other way. And a moment later, when Steve cried out with the force of his orgasm, Tony’s own barreled through him. He went rigid, muscles electric with euphoria, then dropped limply onto Steve’s back, panting.
Tony shifted against him, screwing up his nerve.  “So, you’re sure you never fooled around a little?”
Steve readjusted Morgan’s grip on his hand--she didn’t let go, but allowed him to twist his wrist just enough to hold it comfortably--and led them inside.
He stepped into the garage, the familiar scent of motor oil enveloping him.  It was tinged with the faintest hint of leather and the earthy odor of horses.  This had been a stable once, a long time ago, but no horse had been inside for twenty years.
“You-you look good, too,” Steve stammered.  “Better.  You know.  Than you did.”  He sighed, frustrated with himself.
He wasn’t their leader anymore.  If anyone was, it was Rhodey.  He was a good tactician and had a strong will.  He was the epitome of what Steve was supposed to be: a soldier with a good heart.  Steve admired him, and he would follow him into war with no questions asked.  But was Steve worthy of entrance here?  Could he enter this familial circle or was he still that fugitive rogue who had left then stayed away too long, allowing for the destruction of billions?
He did a lot. He always did. No one had ever been able to bring Tony up over the edge with more skill and passion as Steve could. He left him a sweaty, sated, quivering puddle every single time.
“He’s alive,” she said, slipping unconsciously into Russian.  He knelt beside Steve and took the hand Natasha was not holding.
They were silent for a moment, just looking at each other, Steve lying prone on the bed, Tony sitting overtop him, legs intertwined. Tony was acutely aware he was still wearing his suit pants--his cock was letting itself be known, pressing uncomfortably against its fabric prison--and even more aware that Steve was not wearing anything, except…
Old, familiar anger flared inside him.  He’d had the same thought before.  Dr. Wilkes had brought it up in session once, too.  It may have even been partly true.
“You outrank me, sir,” he said smartly, eyes forward, chin high and firm.  “It’s protocol for me to address a higher-ranking officer as ‘sir’, sir.”
let happen.”  He wiped his face with his hand in a weary gesture.  “And I let it happen.  And now he’s gone.  And I deactivated his access code.  And I cleared out his room.  And I had Happy arrange all the storage stuff because I don’t want to know where it is.  And when I sleep, I sleep alone.  And when I go to the movies, I go alone.  And when I order dinner, I eat it alone.”  He shrugged, smiled again.  “And that’s okay.  It really is okay.”
The hallway outside his mother’s room was empty, so he slipped through the door. She was still asleep, but her cheeks seemed pink, her breathing easy. He went to her and kissed her. She stirred, but didn’t wake. In the chair by the bed, Sam rubbed his eyes. He opened them and saw Steve.
Steve smiled and looked down at his hand.  “It’s lonely in here.  At least in the...other one there was no prospect of seeing anyone.  I was alone.  I knew it.  That was part of the deal I made and I was able to prepare myself for that.  But here.”
“Good,” Tony said, but instead of letting him go, he held him tighter, and even though he was going to be late, and Mr. Stark was coming to see him at nine, and he had a lot of stuff he had to get done before tomorrow, Steve stayed where he was, letting Tony hold onto him, kissed the side of his neck.
Tony was on his feet and across the room in two seconds flat. He had just enough time to see Steve’s exhausted face light up before he was throwing himself into his arms and kissing him forcefully.
I’m tired of glacial, Steve. I don’t want to do glacial anymore. I want...what’s the opposite of glacial?”
a problem, he’d bow out. No one would think less of him for it. Not this time, anyway. Not after the shit show that had been his last assignment. It would be fine. Even with the kid--Tony--here, it would be fine.
Steve smiled, remembered he was trying to be mad, and deliberately scowled.  The whole thing had a dizzying effect on Tony.  Although, admittedly, that was nothing new.  Everything Steve did seemed to affect him in that way.  Since they’d moved into the bedroom a week ago--since they’d made love for the first time--Tony had been existing in a state of low-grade agitation that never let up.  Every sense and feeling he had felt heightened.  Everything from happiness, to anger, to plain old tiredness seemed exponentially
“Yeah. Yeah, that’s what we talked about.” And Steve heard the words, heard the voice, but it was barely recognizable as his own from the breathless, eager tone of it.
Tony smiled and laughed a confused little laugh. He tightened his grip on Steve’s knee. “Okay, you guys are either talking about something else, or you are
When the jet touched down, he made Nick's office his first stop. The debrief was short. Mission accomplished. Ninety-eight percent accuracy. One casualty. Hutchins. Killed in action.
Nat bit her lip to keep from smiling.  “Nothing,” she said.  “Just you and Strange have some stuff in common, that’s all.”
, you should have.”  He was sitting at the table, books, and notebooks, and pencils surrounding him.  The old, battered laptop he refused to give up sat open.  It looked like he’d been typing an essay.
He sat the clothes down on the floor, and went into the kitchen, trying to give Steve a little space. He loosened his tie, and called in to the office. He told them he wouldn’t be in, and his assistant just said, “Sure, Tony, no problem. See you Monday.”
Tony shifted into second, then third.  He glanced at Steve, the way he was curled into himself, and smiled a little.  That wasn’t defeat in Steve’s posture.  Had not been defeat in his words.  He was playing along.  Still thinking he had the upper hand while giving the impression of surrender.  The fact that they both knew what was going on was part of the game too.  That’s what made it work.  That’s what made it fun.
“So, you drew the short straw, huh?”  Tony said.  He was smiling a little, wondering how this was going to go.  In a way, he felt bad for Bruce.  If socially-awkward had a poster-child, it would be him.  But he was a good guy, sweet and innately kind, in spite of his big, green counterpart, and Tony tried to be gentle with him.  He just wished teasing him wasn’t so much fun.
Tony shifted, moving until he was lying partly on top of Steve, his legs on either side of Steve’s right thigh, Tony’s own within easy distance of Steve’s center.   If he just bent his knee a little… “You broke in here,” he pointed out, experimentally rolling his hips.  Pleasure burst through him at the contact.  “That makes us even.”
“713-B, huh?” Steve said.  He suddenly felt very light, as if even a puff of breeze could blow him away.
He couldn’t help it. It was startled out of his stomach and rolled along his tongue and out through his mouth. There was humor in it, and relief, but also a tinge of wariness. Of caution. But once again, Howard didn’t seem to notice.
Tony laughed, and Steve thought he was still at least mostly asleep. “No, honey. I'm never going to leave you.”
Tony ignored him and came back to Steve. He took his hand, and even though his heart was breaking, Steve held it tightly. Tony chased his eyes, and Steve finally let them be caught again. Tony smiled at him, and Steve tried to smile back.
Tony melted at the sight of it.  “God, you were really going to do it, weren’t you?  I half-thought you were just saying it to placate me.”
He set the cruise at 52 miles per hour, three under the speed limit, and relaxed into the seat, munching his egg roll.  He’d light a fire when he got home.  Wine, fire, rain outside the window, Steve on the couch, ready and willing.  It sounded too good to be true, but it wasn’t.  This was his life now, and barring an occasional lapse on Steve’s part, it was perfect.  It was everything he had never dared to hope for.  He’d had something like it with Pepper, but this, this with Steve so far outshined that, it hurt Tony’s head just thinking about it.
Steve had been to all of them but two, and Sam had taken her to those. She always said she could go alone, but Steve would just laugh into the phone and ask what time he should be there in the morning. She always huffed a little, but Steve knew she was glad. Glad for the support, and glad for the company--even if it was from the waiting room outside. Sometimes though, when there was an empty seat, the nurses would let him come into the treatment room. When that happened, he’d curl up in one of the recliners next to his mom while she sat for her treatment. Sometimes he’d read to her quietly until she fell asleep. Sometimes, they’d watch the television bolted to the wall. Sometimes, he would fall asleep too, his hand clasped loosely in hers, knees drawn up until he was secured in the lap of the chair, sleeping deeply, dreaming things he couldn’t remember when he woke up. Or just blocked out. That could be.
Tony was looking at him, though. He could feel it. Feel those deep, dark, bad eyes boring into him. “What do you mean ‘I’ll be okay’?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, and squeezed Tony tightly in his arms. He kissed his shoulder, his neck, his cheek, then squeezed him again. “What were you thinking about?”
Steve nodded. “Okay,” he said, and smiled when Pietro kissed him again. “But really come over when you’re done. This is important too.”
Fury’s blazing eye softened.  Just a little, and he put a hand on the back of Steve’s neck.  Steve smiled his half-smile.  Fury turned back to Ross.
“We have to take this slow, Tony,” he said finally, and Tony felt the ground beneath him disappear. Yup. His heart
“Steven? Hello. It’s Howard. Howard Stark. I wonder if I could meet with you tomorrow morning? Tony said you work at a diner downtown. Would it be alright if I came and spoke with you? I won’t take up much of your time. I could be there at nine. Let me know if that doesn’t work for you...or if you would rather not. There’s no pressure, son. Call me at this number if there’s an issue, otherwise, I’ll see you at nine. Have a good night.”
take her out, though.  Take her out and push the gas and really let her show her stuff.  But not tonight.
“You hurt your hands,” Tony said, and ran one finger over the knuckles of Steve’s right hand.  “They didn’t really need a bandage, but I kinda just wanted to touch you.  I never really had before, and I was curious.”
“Come on, Doc, don’t be that way.”  He cocked his head, thinking of Natasha.  “We’re all on the same side here.”
“He went through a phase of painting refracted light,” Sam said, and they all fell naturally into step again. Steve in the middle, Sam and Tony to either side. “Those are my favorites.”
He had a dimple. Just one, on his right cheek. Steve wasn’t sure what to think about it, but the guy was pretty determined to show it off--he kept smiling at Steve like he really did think he was funny. Or something. He smelled kind of good too. Not like Tony. Nobody smelled as good as Tony. But good. Like citrus and sandalwood, and when he leaned closer, Steve breathed it in, unable to help himself.
“Alright, smartass,” Sarah warned, and Steve laughed again. He felt good. God, he felt so good. Sam, and now his Mom. And Dodger--all on his side. They were always on his side, and all of a sudden, he couldn’t wait to get home. Get home and call Tony.
Tony tried hanging on to his irritation, but just couldn’t.  Adorable-Bruce was too much.  He grabbed him and squeezed him tight instead.  “You’re forgiven.  I can’t stay mad at you.  Especially not today.”
Tony let out a short, shocked breath. His eyes crawled over Steve’s face, drinking him in. “Damn,” he said under his breath. “I didn’t even notice at first.” He closed the distance between them, then reached out a hand to touch Steve’s cheek. It was tentative, that hand. Almost shy. “My god,” he breathed. “You look just like when we were kids.”
Steve was getting used to it, but it broke his heart a little every time he jotted a name or a date into that pristine white margin.
“It is to me.  Saying all that bad stuff about yourself.  If you were anybody else, I’d punch you in the face for smack-talking my man.”
There were two lamps, one on each side, and Tony snapped his on before slapping the overhead off.  He adjusted the pillows, doubling one up, then got into bed.  He lay on his back and pulled the blanket up to his chest, his arms free, then watched Steve surreptitiously from the corner of his eye.
“I know what happened last time, baby,” Tony pressed, “but it won’t be the same.  Doctor Strange is here to make sure everything stays healthy, and she’s just going to be looking, okay, she’s not going to
Tony blinked rapidly. He kept his hand clenched over the dog-tags inside. “Do, um...do you know how often I thought about you giving me these?” he asked. He smiled, but it was small, difficult, like the thought gave him as much pain as pleasure. Steve supposed it probably did. “After that night. That first night, when you came home and we saw each other at that bar? Remember?”
Steve let out a reluctant breath.  “There was this one guy,” he said carefully.  “A nice kid.  Blake, I think.  Or maybe Black.  He was from Nevada.  I remember that.  He had a keychain with some dice on it.  He said he’d gotten it in Las Vegas, and he carried it to remind him of home.”
Steve felt his face go red and his hands resumed their pre-battle clench. Yes, there would be some time spent in the gym tonight. He let out a frustrated breath.
Tony shook his head. He was tired. Flustered now, too, Steve’s disappointment, and the fact that he hadn’t slept in over thirty hours finally catching up with him. “I don’t even know what time it is,” he said.
But that was the past now.  That was another life, and here in this one, there were other things that he needed to think about, and other things they needed to discuss.  But, oh, he didn’t want to do that either.  All he really wanted was to stand here with his head on Tony’s shoulder while Tony scratched lightly up and down the back of his sweater.  But he so rarely got what he truly wanted.
His eyes opened but they were cloudy, unfocused, all the strength in them slipping away.  “Nat?  Where are you?”
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and squeezed once before releasing him.  “Don’t be too hard on her,” he said.  “If it wasn’t for her, you’d be sulking in the lab right now.”
There was a pause, and Tony was afraid he would say no.  Afraid he would lose his chance.  He was ready now.  It had to be now.  If he didn’t take this opportunity right now, he never would.  He would let it go by, and they would maybe live together for a little longer, but soon, Steve would leave.  He’d just leave.  Tony would wake up one morning, and that old ruck-sack would be gone from its place next to the door, his leather jacket would be gone from the back of the couch where he always left it, and he would be gone.  He might not even leave a note this time.
, Mom,” Steve said quietly, grasping her wrist where it lay on the tabletop. “Tony...he doesn’t really get it. I tried to tell him, but he didn’t understand.”
guy. Some other younger guy who probably didn’t have a failed marriage and threads of gray showing up in his beard now. Gray. Christ. Thanks a fuckload, Howard. Tony would be lucky if he wasn’t completely gray by the time he was forty.
On his lap, Billy squawked his name.  Tony pressed the cut-off button, silencing him, never taking his eyes off the sketch.
“Too bad,” she said.  “You should have come out with me.  My nights are only rough when I want them to be.”  She smiled at him, the curve of her lips as suggestive as the words she said.
It wasn’t often that a Stark, especially Tony Stark, was rendered speechless--Pepper used to threaten him with a roll of duct tape she swore she carried in her purse--but he was speechless now, the only thought in his head, a less-than-articulate
Tony leaned in and pressed his mouth to Steve’s.  A tiny jolt of electricity seared his lips.  Tony kissed him harder.  “Me too,” he said when he pulled away.
There was the sound of clicking nails that he recognized from the other morning on his own hardwood floors, then a soft whine directly through the door.
At Tony’s urging, Steve slid back to lay his head on the pillows. He’d lain here often over the past two months, drifting off to sleep with the sounds of Tony’s heartbeat in his ears, Tony’s scent surrounding him, the silky-smooth feeling of the sheets against his skin, but now, with his eyes bound shut, all of those sounds and sensations seemed heightened. His senses were already off the charts thanks to Dr. Erskine’s serum, but without sight, the others seemed even more intense.
to be Steve’s, anyway. He flicked his hand at the frames sitting there, then folded his arms again. “Take the photos.”
“You ever burn down one of those buildings with your ‘kid stuff’?  Do I need to jack up the insurance on this place?”
Tony rubbed his face with his hand.  It was a tired gesture, one he was pretty sure he had picked up from Steve, but he couldn’t help it.  “He shouldn’t have done that,” he muttered, and finished off his beer.
The leader took a step forward.  He had a pleasant face, blue-eyed, blond.  Though not nearly as tall or broad as Steve, they had a similar look, like distant cousins, maybe.  He looked at Tony,
Tony spread his legs a bit and hooked one over Josh’s calf. They were being pretty brazen with this little make-out session, but it was okay. Tony didn’t mind being looked at. He wouldn’t mind if everyone in the place pulled up a chair and took notes. But, of course, the one person who
Steve shrugged.  His eyes were still closed, and Tony could tell he was tired.  Exhausted, maybe.  He’d let him sleep.  After this.
Tony thought he’d seen earlier, more apparent than ever in the deep blue of his eyes. He didn’t say anything, but Tony didn’t need him to.
. Tony slipped his free hand up around Steve’s neck. “That wasn’t really a pun,” he said. “But I do kind of like the idea.”
Tony turned the stereo up and drove home with the top down.  Steve was glad he didn’t have to talk.  He couldn’t stop thinking about where Tony fit into that equation.
They waited for him to answer, and then Sam took pity on him. He put a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Art. It’s his best class.”
Steve’s own hands settled on Tony’s waist, and stayed there, not moving, not pushing him away, just holding, just existing there as if that was where they belonged, where they always belonged.  He kept his head lowered, not meeting Tony’s eyes, as Tony stroked the back of his neck, anchoring him in the shadows.
She ducked her head, taking a breath just as Steve did the same.  She put her hand on his chest, feeling the slow beat of his heart, taking strength from him, courage from him one last time.  When she looked up, it was with all the kindness she could muster.  Because it was what Steve would want of her.  What he would do himself.
rocked just a fraction of an inch when he tensed his muscles to pull.  He thought it had, but then Ultron had come in and everything went to hell.  He’d stuffed it away in the back of his mind, never taking it out to examine it except in the occasional dream where he wielded it in battle against some nameless foe.
?” Tony whispered, and his eyes shot to Steve’s face.  He didn’t meet Tony’s eyes.  His own had dropped to his hands, loosely clasped between his knees.  “Steve?” Tony said.  “What is this?”
Steve’s tongue touched his bottom lip, just like it did last night on the roof. Tony’s stomach flipped over, and he felt his cock stir. “How do I do that?” Steve asked, and his voice sounded innocent, but his eyes were suddenly anything but. Suddenly, they looked almost predatory. Tony’s cock stirred again.
Tony came to him and took his hand, interlacing their fingers together easily and expertly. He put his other arm around Steve’s neck and drew him down until he could press a kiss to his forehead, then guided Steve’s head down onto his shoulder where it fit best. Steve exhaled with undeniable relief, and slipped his free arm around Tony’s waist. Oh. That felt good.
that, that’s totally fine. I’ll understand. I will. But I want you to come home first. Even if it’s just to tell me you’re okay. Will you do that? For me?”
to talk to. Someone he’d missed talking to. It upset him that it had taken a bottle of whiskey to bring him out, but he was
Steve laughed in his ear. Tony’s favorite one. The low, soft one that came from the back of his throat. “That doesn’t happen much.”
Steve rubbed the back of his neck with one hand. He could feel how red his face was, how flushed, but he wasn’t embarrassed. He was happy. Extremely happy. Happier than he could remember being for a very long time. “Well, don’t get too excited yet,” he said, knowing full well that not only was
just met somewhere?  What if they'd bumped into each other in line for the movies or at the grocery store?  They called it a "meet cute". Yeah, Steve knew what that was. Clint and Bruce both had a fondness for romantic comedies, so Steve knew all about it.
“Of course, I do.  You would have dug your heels right in and kept at it until he couldn’t help but like you.”
He let himself into his mother’s apartment around eleven o’clock. Dodger met him at the door. He didn’t bark, but his entire body wiggled with happiness, his bottom half going one way, his top half going the other way.
Steve swallowed. “She’s sick.” His lip started to tremble, and when he looked at Tony at last, large tears over-spilled his lashes. “Tony,” he whispered miserably. “Tony, she’s sick.”
He’d designed the layout of it, of course. Made sure there was a private workout space, plenty of big windows to let in the air and the natural light, an office where Captain America could work on his star-spangled plans. Or whatever it was that old song used to say. Beyond that, Tony hadn’t thought much about these rooms. He had assigned an interior designer to be at Steve’s disposal to make sure it was exactly what he wanted and needed, and had assumed it turned out okay because when he asked Steve how everything was, he had just smiled and said,
Realization dawned, and Steve’s face scrunched into a guilty little smile that Tony found utterly adorable. But, of course, he didn’t say that. “Oh,” Steve said. “Huh.”
He flashed those eyes at Natasha, the full force of his still-considerable will commanding her silently.  “I promise,” she wept.
“You don’t-” Her eyes snapped to the photo on the wall. The one of a baby Morgan in her red dress. Steve looked at it too. Remembered how upset and hurt he’d been by that picture when it had first caught his eye. How different it seemed now. Almost like an omen of things to come. Like a promise.
. About his own mini break-down, so he erred on the side of caution. "Better," he added, and left it at that.
Tony groaned and put his head against Steve’s chest again.  “Please tell me he’s not going to be slaughtering a fatted calf in our living room.”
“Okay, good.  Thank you.”  Steve picked up his pen and held it poised over the paper.  “Fire away, boss.”
“Mm,” Strange grunted, then leaned forward over the desk.  “It’s none of my business,” he said, “and part of me is dreading the answer, but my professional curiosity is forcing me to ask.”
After showering, Thad had changed into a pair of pajama pants and a robe. Steve hadn’t showered yet. He didn’t always. Thad liked to see him lying in his bed covered in his come. He’d told Steve more than once, that if he had his way, Steve would never move at all. He would just keep him there on his bed forever. The first couple times he said it, Steve had felt flattered. To think someone like Thad Ross could want him so much. But he hadn’t felt as flattered lately. In fact, when Thad said it lately, Steve had started to feel a little sick.
Steve blushed, nodding, and Wanda went to where Sam sat asleep in the chair by the window. She slid into his lap and soothed him with kisses when he stirred. Morgan followed and knelt back by the coffee table. She picked up a crayon and started to color. Steve looked after her, troubled. She hadn’t said anything to him at all.
Steve pulled back just a little, just enough to take a breath, then laughed it softly out. “Wow. Guess that’s okay, then?”
tip Howard out onto the ground. It would never dare let anyone so important look so undignified. “I withdrew my objections to the two of you spending time together,” he went on. “I told him I would pay for his college education. His room and board. His car. His allowance would stay intact.” He gestured with one manicured hand. “Whatever else he needs. Or wants. Within reason. Just as I have always done.”
--had stepped on a pressure plate buried in a bit of sand and snow and triggered it. He could see where the lower half of his body had been practically vaporized. He could also see that he was not moving. That he would never move again. At least not on his own.
Morgan seemed to think that was good enough. She didn’t seem to worry that he didn’t have those words. That he couldn’t make a promise, no matter how much he might want to. She didn’t know that the fear was still there. The fear that once he made a promise, he might someday have to break it, and he couldn’t do that. Especially not to a Stark.
, himself, was doing. “I can’t say it,” Steve whispered, his mouth still on Tony’s, their lips brushing together as he spoke, “but you know I do, right? You know I always will?”
“If she let you in, she’s not really my friend,” Tony said. But there was no venom in it. He was too tired for venom. Too sad.
team in town thought that was bullshit.  Tony had already spoken to Jack about this issue.  He didn’t tell Billy about that, though.
"Me? Jealous? Of a younger, prettier version who got to have birthday-sex with you before I did? Noooo. Never."
He held her, burying his face in her hair.  Sleep was coming again, and he welcomed it, but that knowledge was still there inside him, a little flame of truth.
A special thanks to those of you who stuck with me from the beginning, those who commented on almost every chapter/story. I kept going for you, almost as much as I kept going for me.  This may not have ended how any of us wanted, but I am a little in love with you all for being here with me through it. You're beautiful, wonderful, and lovely, and if I could hug you all, I would!
“You don’t go to MIT,” Josh said, his voice rising just a bit, trying to break the spell that was being woven between Tony and Steve. “Where
He closed his eyes, willing his body to cooperate and calm down.  If only he could get Steve to do the same.  “No,” he said evenly.  “That’s
At last, it was just Steve and Clint left.  Clint fiddled with the saltshaker, spilling a few grains onto the table.  He traced a finger through them.
Steve kissed him again very slowly. He kept it soft, just as Tony had done, not even letting his tongue tease Tony’s. Not yet. Maybe later, but not quite yet. He felt like they still had a little talking to do first. “Do you think Morgan liked it?” he asked, curling his arm tighter around Tony.
Steve struggled toward consciousness, shedding the nightmare like a snake shedding a skin, forcing his way up from those writhing, ebony depths.  Baby? Had he
He went up the elevator, trying to keep his mind blank.  He kept it blank as he got off and walked down the hallway.  The conference room door stood open.  Steve stepped inside, all confidence and empty mind, then stopped in his tracks as his head exploded with Tony’s name.
“Yeah,” Tony called back.  “I said…” His mind whirled like a dervish, trying witty answers and discarding them like a Las Vegas dealer shuffling a poker deck.  “Double-fuck.”
After a while, the city was gone, left behind, and fields of fresh-turned earth and tender shoots of alfalfa took its place. Tony flipped the radio off and the silence pressed in, more quiet than Steve had ever heard in his entire life. He and his mother had planned a trip to the Grand Canyon after graduation. They’d been saving for it for years. Steve wondered if this was what it was going to be like. This silence. This peace.
He finally turned down the long driveway and coasted to a stop in front of the cabin. He had called the caretaker while Steve was getting dressed and offered him two hundred dollars to run down and make sure everything was clean and there were no dead mice or something in the bed. He was pretty sure he was being silly--Howard still owned the place, still had the guy check on it every couple of weeks just in case--but he wanted this to be perfect. For Steve.
This was going to be much, much darker. There was going to be pain, and death, and way more sad, but i really must be going through something, because I can't seem to make it that dark. There's still going to be some drama, but it's not going to be anywhere near what I had originally planned. I'm thinking three more chapters. Pretty sure it will be three. Maybe two, but probably three.
“I hope you like pot roast,” Steve was saying, oblivious to Tony’s inner turmoil. “It’s kind of old-fashioned, I know, but my mom used to make it sometimes. I thought you might like it.”

send other letters...for a while. But as the weeks went by, it got harder to come up with things to write. Tony’s were so full of hope, of optimism, of happiness, and what did Steve have to write about? Being tired all the time. Moon Dust everywhere. Waking up to the sound of distant gunfire. Or screams. Being cursed at and spit on. Getting friendly with a couple of the locals only to discover them suddenly missing one day, their shops boarded up or simply abandoned. Finding a dying dog on the side of the road and wanting to take him home. Wanting to take care of him, nurse him back to health, keep him, and train him, and love him, and take pictures with him to send home to his mom. He didn’t do those things though. He couldn’t. He squatted down and pet its head, feeling sick as its big, brown, trusting eyes rolled up to look at him even as the blood pooled beneath its open mouth. He said, “It’s okay, big guy. It’s okay. I’ll take care of you, ‘kay? Don’t worry.” And the dog thumped its tail weakly against the ground even as Steve put a bullet in its head.
Tears welled in Wanda’s eyes and when Steve sighed in sheer gladness and pulled her to him, they broke free.
Tony nodded.  “Me too.  Plus I can tell you about the time Steve got caught in that revolving door.”
Steve’s face softened.  “Me too.”  His eyes flicked to the bathroom door, then back to Tony’s face.  “I was gonna...but let’s just go to bed.”
Steve ran water in the sink and dumped the dishes in.  “Besides,” he said, raising his voice so Tony could hear him, “there’s always somebody hanging around the Tower.  Either that, or we all go out together.  Not much chance for alone-time.”
A storm of emotion passed through him. Memories swirling like driving snow. As many times as they’d been in his car together, Tony had only asked him that one other time. Steve nodded. “Yeah,” he said quietly. “I do.”
Tony laughed.  “No.  Jeff...he’s not my...anything.  Well, I mean, he’s my friend.  He’s on my bowling team.”
Steve had to tell some people, though. He met Sam at a bar on the outskirts of town. They played a few rounds of pool, and then while they sat drinking Cokes and eating bar-nuts, he spilled the news that Tony was back in town, and they were seeing each other.
“Always,” Steve said quietly. “You always come first. You’re the only things that matter to me, Tony. Nothing else means anything. Just you. Just you guys. I don’t care about anything else.”
Tony reached Steve just in time.  He put a steadying hand on Steve’s chest.  His heart was pounding like a racehorse.  His skin, deathly pale.
“I know that,” Tony said, and Steve could still hear the smile in his voice. He was glad. So very glad. “But we can just sleep,” Tony went on. “If that’s all you want to do, that’s fine with me, baby. Just don’t leave me, okay? Don’t leave me alone?”
“Well, maybe not as much as when I was twenty, but I still do okay,” he said and put plates on the table.  “Lucky for you.”
That little smile again.  There and gone.  It reminded him achingly of Steve’s, and Tony thought of how the two of them mirrored each other’s habits now.  Steve and Bucky must have done the same.  He wondered which one that little half-smile had originally come from.
“You have no idea,” Tony whispered, and Steve circled his arms around Tony’s waist, crushing him against his chest and kissed him intently, deeply, like that first night, the first time back at the Tower.
Tony’s fist shot out again.  Steve leaned back, dodging it.  “Probably not,” he said.  “But you said ‘anything I want’.  You did say that, right?  I could have sworn you did.”
Silence.  No one spoke.  No one moved.  They just watched helplessly as he struggled, trying so hard to remember the name of the man who had been with him in either body, mind, spirit, or all three for over a century.  Trying to remember the name of his best friend.
Steve kissed him again. His hair was hanging over his brow, his eyes filled with a complication of emotions--desire, humor, love. Mostly love. “Think you’re still in good enough shape to get on top?” he asked. “Or are you gonna make me do all the work?”
He let him have the good seat next to the window in home-room because he heard there was a dog running around out in the parking lot and he hoped that Tony would see it.
Tony ducked his head. “My father,” he mumbled. “I think we’re going back to California when school gets out.”
Steve sat up straight, pulling away from Tony.  He missed Steve’s warmth and closeness already.  “I mean should we be getting married.”
Howard tipped his head in a way achingly like Tony. “No. I have a private room.” He gestured vaguely at his midsection. “Colon,” he said. “They caught it during an exam. Surgery, now chemotherapy.” He smiled, just a tilt of his lip. “It seems as though your mother and I have something in common after all.”
It was fast, there and gone in the blink of an eye, but it had happened, Tony was positive of that.  Tony looked at Wanda.  Her brow was furrowed now, the delicate skin around her eyes creased.  Her tongue stole out and touched her lips.  It was a fretful gesture.  The mirror-image to what Steve sometimes did.  Her breathing had quickened, and Steve’s had too.  His chest moved faster, rising and falling with each intake and exhale.
“Tony,” he began, then cleared his throat. His eyes were downcast, almost shy. “Tony, will you stay?”
He tried not to think about that dream when he visited her. When she was lucid, and knew all the years that stood between them, he almost succeeded. But when she quieted and her eyes clouded, it was more difficult. When she blinked and those eyes, those dark, dark eyes, filled with terrible hope and the tears began to fall, it was more than difficult--it was impossible. He stayed with her then, his large unblemished fingers reaching to swallow up her small wrinkled ones. He laid his head on the pillow next to hers and whispered, “I’m here. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere,” until she stilled again. When she was asleep, he pulled his hands from hers--gently, oh so gently--and walked out the door. He tried not to think of that dream as he walked down the street, cap pulled low on his brow, shoulders hunched inside his jacket. He tried not to think about it and thought about it the whole way home.
Tony stood and helped Steve to his feet. Steve didn’t let go of his hand as Tony opened the door and led him inside the apartment.
That made it through too. His self-preservation was starting to kick in. The part of him that made sure he ate something other than gummy bears and blueberries. The part that made sure when he finally collapsed from exhaustion, it was usually onto his bed, or at least the sofa down in the lab instead of just onto the floor near his work-station. That part of him was finally bustling into his brain, eyeing up the situation, figuring out the best way to get his body back on track.
Protectiveness swelled in Tony’s heart as he ducked his head, trying to catch Steve’s eye. They skittered away, afraid, refusing to be caught.  Tony let it go.  He wouldn’t force him.  Wouldn’t push him.  But it was cold out, so cold, and it had been a year since Steve had been in the elements.  His immune system was probably low, even with the serum.  He had to get him inside.  Get him warm.  Get him
Steve tightened his grip on Tony, and put his forehead against his shoulder. “I usually go to closed meetings-” he began.
Steve. Sitting so peaceful there in the sun. Tony smiled a little. “Yeah. It would be,” he said gently.
--and steering him toward the door, “are going to be late for Fury. And we can’t have that because the sooner you go, the sooner you come home.”
“I have tried.  I bought it toys, and treats, and I feed it every morning, and when it scratches on the window at four-thirty in the damn morning, I get up and let it in--”
Steve didn’t see those aspects of himself when he looked through Tony’s eyes.  All he could see was the liar.  The condescender.  Through Tony’s eyes, he was weak.  He was a coward.  Through Tony’s eyes, he had been judged, and found wanting. Part of him knew it was wrong, that he was using Tony in some bitter, masochistic way, but he could no more stop it now than stop the Earth from spinning.
“Yes,” she agreed, still holding the arrow.  It trembled in her hand, an echo of Clint’s quivering muscles.  “But that’s not you.  Not anymore.”
“I dropped him at Clint’s,” Nat answered, and smacked his arm again. “You’re just lucky he was home or you would have been driving home alone with Mr. Grumpy-pants here,” she said, and then reached up through the seat and kissed Steve’s cheek. “Isn’t that right, Grumpy?”
Tony gave her a smile, glancing at the mirror himself. He’d been right. The girl was no longer occupying her own chair. She’d taken up residence in her boyfriend’s lap. “The food was fine,” he said, then gave Bruce a nudge. He looked at him, startled. “The in-flight entertainment was even better, right, Bruce?”
“What?” Tony asked. “I mean, you’ve got the rah-rah part down, obviously.” Steve snorted. Affectionately. “Now you just need to look the part.” He touched Steve’s cheekbone. “A little sparkle here,” he said. “A pom-pom there…”
When he got to the car, he slid behind the wheel, then looked at his phone.  Three missed calls.  One from Pepper, two from Steve, and one voice-mail.
Out of the corner of his eye, Tony saw Natasha sitting on a hard wooden bench. Sam went to her and she stood up. Sam hung his head. She put her hands on her hips, eyeing him for a moment, then sighed and touched his cheek. Tony saw her lips form the words
“Did I interrupt you?” Tony nodded at Steve’s pocket where he’d stowed his phone. “That wasn’t your girlfriend, was it?”
Tears filled Tony’s own eyes, but he didn’t let them fall.  He smiled.  “Steve,” he said.  “Hey.  Hi.”
He wondered now how much her objection to Tony being part of the Avengers had to do with the danger, and how much had to do with
Rhodey went to the kitchen and rumbled through the fridge.  “Fury diverted a bunch of us down there.  Sam went.  Clint.  Strange.”
Tony ran his hand through Steve’s hair again.  The tears were there, a flood of them, a fucking torrent, but he would not let them fall.  He grinned instead, a wicked little gleam in his eye.  “Guess there’s only one way to know,” he said.  “Ask me now, soldier.”
Steve leaned forward and picked up one of the bottles of nail polish. It was a deep, dark red, the color of Bordeaux poured into a crystal glass. He rolled it between his hands like his mother did before she painted her nails, then opened the little bottle. “How’s that going, anyway?” he asked, as he adjusted Tony’s hand on his thigh to a better angle, and swept the color onto the nail of his index finger. It shone in the soft lamp-light. “Working with your father? Is it okay?”
“That ship has sailed, baby,” Tony said. “Or pretty close, anyway. She asked me if I didn’t want her to just ‘trim it a little’ three days ago.”
“I want you,” Tony said.  “I love you.  I think I’ve always loved you.  And it’s not easy.  It’s never been easy.  But I don’t want to change it.  I don’t want to change anything about it.  It makes me a better man.  And I am well aware of how sappy that sounds, so you’d better believe it.  My ego might be able to take one hit, but it definitely can’t take two.”
“It won’t be,” Tony assured him, tracing the straight line of his jaw. “I might not look it, but I’m pretty tough.”
“Let it be enough for you to know that he’s reading your letters to him.  Right now, that’s more important.”
I know it's been rough, guys, but stick with me!  The good thing about a roller coaster is that even though it goes down (way WAY down) it usually comes back up!  See you in a couple days!  I hope. :)
They stopped outside an office door, and the guard rapped on it twice.  People milled around them, their hands full of papers or curled around phones or bottles of water.  One man at a desk a few feet away was eating his lunch.  Steve stared.  It looked like a cobb salad.  Chicken.  Bacon.  The feta cheese smelled sharp and enticing.  Steve’s mouth watered.  He had never wanted anything as badly as he wanted to go over and stuff that entire tray of lettuce and cucumber and dressing into his mouth.  Even from here, he could see the bacon was crisp and peppery.
“Oh,” Steve said, smiling himself now, shyly.  “Umm,” he ran a hand through his hair, “yeah, at least I think so.”
Steve kissed him deeply, his hand gripping him, moving faster, the heat between them scorching.  “Do it, then, Tony,” he said raggedly.  “Do it.  Let go.”
Steve held onto him long after he’d fallen asleep.  Sometimes his lips would stray over his skin in soft kisses.  A few times, he spoke, saying, “I’m sorry, Tony.”  “Please understand, Tony.”  “I love you, Tony.”
When Tony fell silent, Howard nodded his head. “I understand why you feel that way, kiddo,” he said. “Christ knows, you’re entitled to it. And I will go.” He put his hand into his pocket and brought something out. Something small. A little coin-shaped thing. He held it clasped in his hand. “I’d like to give you something first, though. If that’s alright?”
Talking to Nat had been one of the worst parts. Colonel Phillips had spoken to Jonathon’s mother, but Steve had requested to speak to Natasha. “She’s a friend,” he said, standing at attention in Phillips’s office area. “I’d like to do it, sir. If that’s okay.”
“Give up?” she asked, and her voice was as polite as if she were asking for more wine at a dinner party.
A soft, lady-like snort.  Why did she and Steve have to be so much alike?  And why was he just noticing this now?
Steve didn’t touch him. Didn’t come near enough to touch him. He skirted around the other end of the couch and stopped at the entrance to the tiny kitchen. “Do you want a drink?” he asked, and gestured toward the cupboards with the glass already in his hand.
Ross’ eyes flew open, and his hand reached, snake-like, under his pillow.  It was instinct, innate, and if Tony had not been one thousand percent sure it was going to happen, Ross might have killed him then and there.
Steve drifted sleepily, lost in contentment. He had never had the opportunity to indulge in his sensual side, but these last few weeks with Tony had found him drowning in it. It was a heady feeling, dark and seductive, almost like he imagined being high must feel like. And if that was the case, he finally understood why so many people spent their lives trying to achieve that state. He just hoped this wasn’t as dangerous. Sometimes it
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said, turning away, turning back into the shadows. He picked up her glass of champagne and threw it back, coughing at the bubbles tickling his nose and throat. He retreated further into the corner. It was dark here. Safe. he closed his eyes.
Steve shrugged self-consciously.  “It’s a big bed,” he said, and looked down at his hands.  He picked at one short nail, then glanced up at Tony with a shy, fragile smile.  “If you want.”
“Yeah, well, maybe your father knows more than I gave him credit for. Maybe he was right about everything all along.”
She touched his cheek, searching his face. She ran a finger beneath his eye. The skin there looked bruised, like exhaustion had physically socked him in the face. “You look so tired,” she said, and he laughed quietly.
Tony heard the music as soon as he stepped out of the elevator. He blinked a little, surprised, and smiled. Steve had eclectic taste in music. Jazz, 80’s New Wave, Seattle grunge, old country/western stuff Tony hadn’t heard in thirty years. He reminded Tony of a bird sometimes. When he heard something he liked--a particular guitar-riff or scrap of lyric--he picked it up. He didn’t care what it was. Like a crow with something shiny, if he liked it, he brought it home to feather his nest. Tony liked that. And hearing it now, some old pre-war song with a lot of trumpet and moody vocals, he thought again how lucky he was. How it felt like Steve was feathering
Steve leaned up and kissed Tony’s mouth softly.  “Thank you for saying that,” he said.  “But I still don’t want it.  I just want to forget it.  Please, Tony?  Just...Just get rid of it.”
Steve ducked his head, blushing as Mr. Fury, the principal, stalked by on his way from somewhere to somewhere else, not pausing, just giving Steve a hard look as he passed.
Tony licked his lips, eyes on Steve. He looked flustered, his face pink. He ran a hand through his hair. “We’ll come watch them again. Right, Steve?”
Steve nodded, glanced down, then looked back up, trying his goddamndest to smile in a way that would show Tony he really was okay. That Tony didn’t need to worry about him, or even think about him. “How are you?”
“Yeah, but why?  Wanda didn’t just stir up all the Ross stuff, Tony.  I saw all the rest, too.  How ungrateful I was.  How...cold.  How hard I was on you all the time.”  He sighed.  “Why did you stay?”
Steve nodded. “Be right there,” he said, and Tony noticed the change in his voice. When he’d spoken to Tony himself, his voice had been like dark honey, dripping sweetness. With Sam, it was calm. Collected. Friendly, but with nothing like that hint of sensuality that pervaded it when he spoke to Tony. It almost sounded like he was another man. Thinking about it, Tony realized it had always been like that, and he liked it. Liked that he got something that no one else did. A version of Steve that was just his.
Steve's eyes darted around the room, then he went to Tony’s side.  “Oh, yeah?  What were you thinking?”
He shook his head. “No,” he said. “I’m not distracted. I’m...clear. I think. For the first time in a long time. I think I’m clear.”
A wave of happiness rolled over him, and he wanted to say yes. He wanted to take her with him, and walk around the block with her, holding her hand while Dodger walked ahead of them. Wanted to listen to her laugh and chatter. Wanted to stop and buy her a hot chocolate on the way back home, and bring a cup of coffee for Tony, and take it to him in bed, but...no. No. He shouldn’t do that. He knew he shouldn’t. Not yet, anyway. “Um. I’m not sure if Tony would like it if I took you outside so early in the morning,” he said. “Especially in your pjs.”
He could call him now. It was eight o’clock. That was a decent time to start calling someone, but he thought he’d get to the office first. Give Steve a chance to get up and get moving. He didn’t work on Fridays. Tony thought he could let him sleep in. A little, anyway.
Steve came toward him.  He was limping.  He had almost shaken the limp, but it was back now.  With avengence, so to speak.  His right arm was in a cast to the elbow, held close against his body in a sling to keep it from moving and disturbing the bone as it healed.  A gash ran up the side of his face and reached into his hairline.  Ugly black stitches held the wound together.
kid, and Tony thought that was pretty much the same thing anyway. That was his own personal approach to parenting too. Of course, he was lucky enough to have the best kid in the universe, so it worked out perfectly for him.
Steve drew the cord between his fingers again. He’d donated most of Mrs. Perkins’s things when he moved into the apartment, but he’d kept some stuff. Practical stuff that he needed and didn’t really have. Plates and silverware. The dining table. A desk and bookcases. Some lamps. And the phone. He’d kept the phone on the bedside table, and he wondered with a small smile what she’d think right now if she knew he was using it to talk to his boyfriend at twelve-thirty a.m. while the beginnings of an erection began to stir.
Tony laughed a little. If it had been anyone else, he thought he might have gotten a little offended by the question. But not here. Not with Steve. “Is that a deal-breaker, Steven?” he asked, and Steve blushed prettily.
Steve shifted a little as Tony slid down the headboard next to him.  Shifted more when Tony nudged him awake enough to open his arms and let Tony in.
He didn’t stop on his own floor, he just pushed the button for the penthouse, and rode the elevator up as high as it would go. He got out when it stopped, and stood in front of Tony’s door. He had been here many times. Even before they’d started seeing each other, he’d come up here for one reason or other. Or for no reason at all. No reason other than just wanting to see Tony. Talk to him. Spend time with him. He smiled a little at that because nothing really changed, did it? That’s exactly what he wanted now. Just to see him. Talk to him. Spend time with him.
“But you still love me, though, right?” Tony teased.  “Come on, Steve, let’s hear one of those rousing speeches about how much you love me.”
He cracked an eye. “Mom?” Sarah was standing beside the bed, and now she leaned over and ran a hand through his hair. She had woken him that way hundreds of times over the course of his life. Why did it seem so ominous now? “Mom, what’s going on?”
Steve watched him now as he walked across the parking lot. He moved with an easy, unconscious grace that was a long way from the awkward pre-teen kid he’d been when Steve had known him before. In fact, if Steve had not been so positive of who he was looking at, he might have thought this was someone else, some other Stark son who had descended from on high to mingle with the commoners for a few hours before climbing back into his car and disappearing into the clouds once more.
He didn’t know why Steve’s kisses always surprised him.  He was an extremely confident kisser, both bold and sweet.  Maybe Tony had assumed Steve would be timid.  He was, after all, very prim and proper in his day-to-day activities.  He had a 1940’s sensibility still when it came to what was appropriate and what was not, especially when it came to things like sexuality.  He said very little, but he had no patience for people who made light of love and sex.  Nevertheless, he did not judge.  He’d been in the modern world long enough to realize his ideals were not shared by all these days, and he staunchly defended the human rights of any-and everyone, including the sexual ones.
Tony sighed, slumping against the deck railing.  “I was kind of shocked it happened at all.  You know Steve, he’s...proper.  I didn’t think with you guys in the house…”
Steve was silent for a minute. Still. Tony held onto him. Just held on, waiting. Waiting to see what Steve would do. He’d said it was Tony’s decision, and he had made it. He wasn’t letting him go. Now, he was waiting to see if Steve would accept that or not. And finally he felt Steve’s arms creep around his middle. “Really?” he asked timidly.
"I've got you now."  He pulled away and looked at Tony.  His eyes were troubled, the blue almost gray this time, like a stormy sea crashing onto treacherous shores.   "Don't I?"
Natasha put her hand on his chest, feeling the racing tattoo of his heart beneath her palm.  His eyes were hard, his mouth a trembling bow.  She hadn’t seen him like this in a long time.  Not since Thanos and Japan.
Steve swallowed past a little blockage in his throat. His mother would have said he had a frog in his throat. But he didn’t really want to think about his mother right now. Not now while Tony’s eyes were bright and dazed on him, and he was feeling all tingly and kind of...weak? Yeah. Weak. Like all the strength had left his body and he was just a dumb rag doll sitting on the stump next to Tony.
“Secretary Ross,” Strange began, “Captain Rogers has been making exceptional strides here under the care--”
“No,” Howard said. “It’s not. In fact, that doesn’t matter to me, at all. I’ve known for a very long time about Tony’s sexuality. In California he had a lot of girlfriends. And he had a lot of boyfriends. He didn’t think I knew about any of them, but I knew about them all.”
When Steve finally pulled back, Tony scrubbed a hand over his face.  Steve’s fingers went to his jacket, crushing the leather.  “What are you doing here?” he asked.  “Do the doctors know you’re here?  What time is it?”
He poured himself a glass and leaned against the counter to drink it.  He should go out on his run, but he decided to let it go for the day.  He was already late, and this morning it didn’t seem as necessary as it usually did.
Steve moved in his seat, his hand reaching out to unconsciously touch the leather dashboard, caressing it.  “No,” he said, uncertainly.  “No, not tonight.  It’s late and I haven’t talked to him in, well, a year.”  His hand moved over the dash.  “I don’t really want to answer any questions.  I don’t...want to talk.”  He sighed.  “Maybe just a motel tonight?  Anywhere’s fine.  I just want to shower and go to bed.”
Tony leaned into him, put his hand on his thigh. There was nothing sexy about it. It was just a comfortable touch. “I would change this plan too,” he said, “except it’s kind of a work-thing. Howard’s been planning it for a long time, and it would be kind of a dick-move to uproot it.” He moved his thumb against Steve’s jeans. “I’d much rather blow it off and hang out with you alone all night.”
Tony slid along the railing until he was directly in front of Steve.  He put one foot on either side of Steve’s, bookending them.  He folded his arms over his chest and leaned forward a bit, getting into Steve’s space but not enough to frighten him.  As big as he was, as tough, he could be as skittish as a newborn colt.  Tony gauged his boundaries and erred on just the right side of too close.  He was good at it.  He should be, he’d been doing it for the last decade of his life.
Steve cried his name loudly as Tony slid back inside him, stroking his cock in time with the movements of his tongue.
Steve nodded, turned his head to nuzzle into Tony’s palm. “Okay,” he said. “If that’s the way it is, then that’s the way it is."
Jarvis, is dead. ‘ JARVIS’ is dead.  Vision, too.  I drove Pepper away a dozen times, and I finally managed to make one stick.  I have failed at every single relationship I’ve ever had.”  Tony looked down at his hands.  Those clever, brilliant hands.  “A year ago today, the love of my life--the one I thought would last forever--tried to kill me, then slit his own throat while I stood there and watched.  Then they carted him away to an asylum.  Exactly like he told me they would do.  The one thing that I promised him I would
Steve shook his head.  “I don’t know, Tony,” he said, his voice unsure, not quite concealing the laughter in his eyes..  “That seems like a lot to ask.  I don’t know if I can promise that.”
He picked up a pennant from a Yankee game he’d went to with Tony.  Steve had been nervous to go because he’d thought somehow it would be different from before when he’d gone with his mom or Bucky.  Tony talked him into it.  He said he had to go because Tony didn’t want to go by himself and both Pepper and Rhodey were busy.
He picked up Steve’s letter to Ross and read it through again.  His heart filled with tender love thinking of all the hours Steve had spent agonizing over this little one-paragraph, carefully-worded, impeccably-formatted letter.  He wished he could see Ross’ face when he read it.  Wished he could spit
He laughed and squeezed her again before letting her go.  “No.  She’s spending Christmas Eve with her parents on Long Island.  We’re having lunch tomorrow.”
Tony just cocked an eyebrow. He didn’t speak. He didn’t really think he needed to, and the answering smile Steve gave him told him he was right.
They’d lie there, side-by-side, and maybe after a while, he’d feel the brush of Steve’s fingers against his own, and he’d lace them together. God, they’d go together so easily. So perfectly. And they’d lie there in that shifting rainbow of shadow, holding hands, quiet in their corner, the lights of the city like the stars at their feet, and it would feel like heaven. Just like heaven.
Tony huffed out a quiet laugh and lifted the cigarette up to Steve’s mouth. They locked eyes as Steve took it from his fingers with his lips. “That would be interesting to see,” Tony said softly.
"Do you?  'Cause some of the things I say…" he paused, shook his head without lifting it, "I'm a real dick sometimes."
body that displaced the air around him, and not just some regular guy. He knew what it felt like when he came near. That snap and hum of electricity that hadn’t dimmed after all. That scent, like shadows on a moonlit street corner. That footstep. That aura. He knew what it felt like. It felt like Tony.
Steve let out a breath and took his foot off the gas pedal.  He'd had her at 120. He'd been sure. So fucking sure…
. The fucking lunch-date guy that Tony hadn’t wanted to meet with in the first place. He was late, and that screwed up the entire day.
Tony stepped closer and gave her a short tight hug.  “Fair enough.  But I insist you tell me when something gets serious.  I am paying you, after all.”
The warning bell rang. Steve looked up slightly, a bit surprised that lunch had flown by so fast. But that seemed to be the way it went whenever Tony was around. Time went by quickly--too quickly--and then it was over. That’s the way it had been before, too. School days went by in the blink of an eye. In fact, it was funny that he remembered anything about those days at all. The entire year had been over in a week’s time.
to be in prison,” Ross said silkily.  “One little thing.  Two words.  And you’re gone.  The hero is gone.  And what’s left?  An experiment gone wrong.  A monster.”
Eyes still on Steve’s, Sam said, “We were just talking about how fast Superman would have to fly to reverse the Earth’s rotation.”
“You’re paying them on salary, son,” he’d said, pouring another drink. “Get everything you can out of them. I can guarantee they’re stealing from you. This is where you get it back from them.”
He thought, six years ago, as he watched that long black car pull away from the curb and out into the street with Tony inside, that he was gone from his life forever.
Relief coursed through him and he leaned forward, capturing Steve’s mouth with a kiss.  “No,” he said.  “I want you in there.  With me.”
Steve shook his head, smiling the fakest smile Tony had ever seen. Well, almost ever. The one he’d flashed him at Nat and Bucky’s wedding still held that top honor. “We’ve kept you too long. It was nice seeing you though.” He reached out and touched Tony’s arm with a light touch. Just the lightest, softest touch. “You should go see Mom,” he said. “She’d love to see you.” He glanced at Morgan. She smiled up at him. “Meet your little girl. Your...wife.” He nodded. “Yeah. She’d like that.”
Suddenly he was angry. Angrier. The ice didn’t stand a chance against the full force of lava-hot hurt that suddenly boiled through him. “Come on, Steve,” he snapped. “You’ve been pissed at me since your birthday. And I get it. I do. I acted like a complete asshole, and I deserve it, but at last have the decency to yell at me or something and quit avoiding-”
He let them have their moment, sipping his tea--lemon and honey, Tony liked honey--then said, “Don’t kill me, Nat, but Bruce does have a point.”
this 26 ¾ inches are yours.  This 26 ¾ inches are mine.  I’ll keep mine the way I want, and you keep yours the way you want.”
people too.  Other people or other priorities, something that would keep them from his side while he lay dying.  It was okay.  He understood.  But it still hurt.  The being alone part.
Tony closed his eyes.  He was sure there was a world spinning outside of this booth, and people living lives that had nothing to do with this, but right now, he was having a difficult time believing it.
Tony didn't agree, but he slid into the front seat anyway. Steve didn't look at him. Didn't speak to him. Didn't acknowledge him, at all. His hand was on the gear shift, and he gripped it tight in his fist.
He closed his eyes and clenched his fists.  His breath was slow, methodical, and when he looked at her, his eyes were haunted.  “Nothing ever really changes,” he said hollowly.
Steve bent and put his mouth against Tony’s ear.  His breath tickled, and Tony shuddered against his chest.  “I know how it works, Tony,” he said.
Steve forgot his nerves as he helped guide Natasha down that short walkway.  He saw Tony standing next to Bruce, and suddenly, there were no nerves.  Tony winked at him, just a quick, subtle, drop of an eyelid, but it was for Steve, and he caught it.  Caught it and held it near his heart, and after that, it was easy.
Tony threw him a distraught look and put one hand over the cat’s ear, pressing the other softly against his chest.  “Steve,
a bullshit type of guy, and it was always interesting to listen to someone who wasn’t.  Also, the looks didn’t hurt.
"Yeah," he said, not even really remembering what Steve had said, just agreeing to agree with him. Saying yes just to please him.  Saying yes so he could get used to it.  He planned on saying yes a lot.  And the look in Steve's eye said that had been the right choice.
Tony switched the cat from one shoulder to the other.  The cat allowed the manhandling with no fuss, just letting Tony maneuver it any way he wanted, all the while gazing into his face with enraptured green eyes.
Steve picked up the pace, jerking himself faster, imagining Tony’s hand instead of his own. Those hands. Those beautiful, rough,
Tony nodded again, and Steve carried Morgan down to her bedroom. He sent her to the bathroom to change and brush her teeth, turning down her bed while he waited, and when she came back out, he lifted her up and tucked her in.
Steve drew in a breath and crossed the threshold.  Nat smiled up at him and Clint did the same.  Bruce shook his hand.  Thor hugged him, and the room felt warmer, the sun brighter, his heart lighter.  There was trust here, and friendship, and acceptance.  Things he was sure were lost, he found here again in this room.
Tony thought about the deal they’d made.  The deal that got Steve out of prison with all charges dropped.  His record expunged.  He thought of the restitution money that Ross had agreed to pay.  Five million dollars, put into an account in Steve’s name.  He thought of the complete overhaul of the Accords that was going to be put into motion.  At least three Avengers had to be present at every meeting held, and the only items put into the new version of the Accords had to be unanimously agreed upon before becoming a part of them.  It would take a long time, but it would be worth the effort, in the end.
“I’m still having trouble with my left leg.  I’m doing all the exercises, but it doesn’t feel like it’s helping.”
“Hey,” Steve said, and his eyes were still bright. Even though he was pale, and they were still hollowed and smudged with tired shadows underneath, they were bright when they fell on Tony. “I was just about to come drag you out of bed.”
She looked up at him then, her dark eyes serious and solemn, a little crease to her brow, and for some reason, he thought of Steve. Those little frown lines he had between his brows. At least the ones that had been there the last time Tony had seen him...but that had been forever ago now. A lifetime. There was no point in thinking about that now. Last he’d heard about Steve, he was living with some guy over in Queens. Nat had tried to bring him up a few times since Tony had moved back, but he shut her down quick. He didn’t want to know. Didn’t want to hear how happy and in love Steve was with some other guy. Some other
Tony put his arm around him and squeezed his shoulder when Steve leaned into him.  They both missed the sly, knowing look that passed between Bruce and Clint.
“Yeah,” he answered.  “Yeah, Tony.  I always do.  You were still mostly asleep, but yeah, of course, I did.”
to be home soon, right?--but for some reason, it didn’t feel like he’d ever be home. He’d been gone for three weeks, but it felt more like three years.
“She would never, Bruce,” Natasha said flatly.  “Steve is like a father to her.  She would never do that.”
“I don’t know,” Steve mumbled. “You came here feeling...sad. And I just-” he began, then hid his face against the side of Tony’s neck, “-I don’t want you to feel...later, you know...like I took advantage of the situation. Of you.”
Steve knew just how to calm him though. With soft eyes and softer words, and kisses and long, soothing strokes to his skin. Then when he was relaxed, lying so peacefully on the bed, Steve would either make his way down his body and take his cock into his mouth, or turn him over, get him on his knees, and slide into him. Sometimes Tony would tell him in words what he wanted, but usually, he just let Steve take charge. Just let him do what he wanted and trust that Steve knew how to take care of him. He always got it right. Always gave him exactly what he needed most.
Steve knew it was bait, but he didn’t take it. He just shrugged instead. “It’s been a long time,” he said, then smiled a little at Tony. “Maybe he forgot me.”
Tony lay on the ground, eyes sightlessly staring up at the rain.  The burning in his gut was immense.  It was the world.  His whole world, right now.
They lapsed into a comfortable silence, Tony sliding his hand through Steve’s hair, Steve stroking Tony’s back, both thinking they had gotten the better end of the deal.  Sleep was finally coming closer, finally ready to take him for the night.  Before it could, he opened his eyes.  Steve had stilled beside him, but he had to say this.
Strange paused.  Sighed.  “I don’t want to believe it.  But Baxter has been thoroughly checked out.  And what would be his motivation for lying?"
Deep down, he was glad Steve had said that.  Deep down, he didn’t want that either.  He beckoned him forward.  “Come on.”
The simplicity of those words were like a heavy boot crushing Tony’s heart into dust.  He looked around at the other inmates.  They wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Steve Rogers.  After Thanos, half of them were gone.  Which ones were dust a couple years ago?  Which of the wives?  Which
The three of them laughed some more, beer flowing as one or another of them called for another round, while they tried to one-up each other with outlandish money-making schemes.
Tony crossed the floor to where Steve squatted and reached down.  He touched his hair lightly with just his fingertips.  Steve didn’t tell him to stop.  So, he did it again.
Tony looked at them longingly, wishing to Christ he could just do that. That it could be that easy for him. And the bitch of it was,
“I asked FRIDAY,” Steve answered.  “She said you were here, and that you were alone.”  He turned his head a little, not meeting Tony’s eye.  That pale light outlined the smooth plane of his cheek.  “She’s pretty, by the way.  Seems nice.”
Tony sighed and pulled him even closer.  “Fortunately, I do,” he said, and pressed his mouth against Steve’s.
Tony kissed him again.  “You’re welcome, baby,” he said, then slid off Steve’s lap, punched his pillows into shape, and sunk down onto them.  He pulled on Steve’s arm until he was lying next to him, then curled up against him.  When Steve didn’t immediately put his arm around him, Tony poked him in the side and said, “Hey, cuddle me, Steve, what the hell?”
Steve bent and kissed her waiting mouth, and she held him there for a long moment, cherishing the feeling of this last kiss between them before she gave another piece of her heart irrevocably away.  When she pulled away, her tears had spilled free and dampened her pink cheeks.  He wiped them away with the balls of his thumbs, and she clasped his hands in hers and kissed his knuckles.
They stayed until afternoon, walking the beach, talking like nothing was wrong. Tony found the key hung on a hook high in the eaves, and they went inside the cabin. It was small but clean. Howard had a guy come in and check on it every week, and someone else come in and dust and vacuum once a month. Tony had never been sure why he did it--it wasn’t like they came up on any father-son fishing trips or anything--but he was glad. He led Steve in by the hand and tossed the key down on the little table by the door. Steve looked around the room, his lips curving into a tiny smile.
Tony shook his head, his eyes glinting with an impish inner light. He stroked his own cock languidly. “I didn’t hear any complaining," he said.
“No, Tony.”  He stopped, and Tony heard him swallow, heard his ragged inhale, felt the hitch in his chest beneath their linked hands.
Tony sucked on it, making needy little whimpering sounds that might have been embarrassing if he gave even one single fuck, but he didn’t. He didn’t. All he cared about was touching every inch of Steve’s body that he could. All he cared about was tasting him, sucking on him, scratching, biting anywhere and everywhere that was available to him.
I just wanted to say that even though you guys are pretty upset at this story, I looooove your comments so much! I can't tell you how much it means to have you as passionate about this as you are. I hate making you sad, but I am in love with you all right now for being so amazing! I wish I could just gather you all up and hug you!
Tony jumped to his feet and ran to the door.  “Hey Pepper.  Pepper.  Pep,” he chanted, tugging her arm.
Steve looked up, startled. Sam was standing there, looking at him with a curious, worried eye. Steve shook himself. He shoved his books into his locker and slammed it closed. “What?” He knew he sounded pissed off. He didn’t mean to. Sam was a good friend--his best friend.
He chuckled and the slight rift between them mended seamlessly. He found himself leaning a little closer to her side. Tony and Pepper were dancing now, and being with Nat soothed whatever pang of what?--jealousy? hurt?--that he felt almost completely.
Nat ignored him and read more.  A hard copy was printing away in the corner, and she was downloading everything onto a tiny zip drive, but her amber eyes ate up the screen in front of her.
Steve pulled back a little, his eyes still closed, his hand still knotted in the leather of Tony’s jacket.  “You shouldn’t have to touch me while I’m in this thing,” he murmured.  “I’m sorry.”
Tony stood up and crossed to where he stood.  Steve flinched back as he touched his cheek.  “I know that,” Tony said, running his fingers over his face, then back into his hair.  It was familiar, the feel of his skin, the smooth silkiness of his hair.  Tony squeezed his hand into a gentle fist, knotting it into those same old golden strands.
I'm a little late, but here's to the moms out there! And by "moms" I mean anyone who cares for and about the people, pets, plants, etc in our lives. I like to think we've all got a little "mom" in us❤❤❤
At four a.m., Steve slipped out of the bed.  Tony stirred, then was still again.  Steve limped into the bathroom, the clothing Tony had helped him shed held in his arms.  He turned the shower on and washed his hair, washed his hands, washed the residue of their release off his stomach, then just stood under that familiar spray.  He’d stood in here a thousand times while he’d lived here.  Once, twice, sometimes, when he was sad, up to five times a day, just standing there with the lights off, letting the warm wetness wash over him.  It was safe in here.  Calming.  At the time, it had been the safest place in the world.
On the grass, Steve murmured something into Bucky’s ear.  He nodded and sat up, scrubbing his arm across his eyes.  Steve let him go and Bucky stood up.
It wasn’t cold--thank god for summer in the city--but it was very wet. Steve, Sam, and Sarah got out of the cab she had hired. Sam held an umbrella while Steve got his bag out of the trunk of the car. Sarah clutched Sam tightly. She had held onto Steve’s hand for the entire car ride from home, but when he got out of the car, she held Sam’s instead. She had to. She needed a tether. She was afraid of what would happen if she didn’t have it. Sam didn’t mind. He held her back just as tightly. He was not shipping out for a couple more months--his birthday wasn’t until September--so he was saying good-bye too. His heart was breaking almost as much as Sarah’s. He felt like he was losing his best friend.
There was a desk against the wall.  A low, leather-topped thing made of heavy, solid maple.  An Eames chair was slid into the knee-hole.  Tony pulled it out and sat down.  It was comfortable and exquisite.  It was something Howard would have bought.  Something he, himself, would buy.  Why did he have to have so much in common with the men he truly disliked?
“I’m not going to kill you, Stark,” he said, then glanced around and shrugged.  “But, I thought if you still wanted to kill me...this wouldn’t be such a bad place to go.”
“Hey,” Tony said, standing in front of him.  He was frowning, worried, his dark eyes even darker.  “Hey, what’s going on?  Why are you upset?”
“Welcome,” Tony said, and squeezed his leg before turning back to the lump currently taking up half the couch. It was too big to be Steve, but the mish-mash of limbs might know where he was. Tony wasn’t sure where to touch--master spies and assassins were notoriously grouchy about being woken up--so he just poked at something he thought was a shoulder.
Steve shrugged. “Don’t know. My plane leaves at eight, but I told Bucky I’d be at the airport at five. Just to be sure.”
Steve ducked his head. He was blushing. Crazily. The feel of Tony’s hand in his, a near revelatory experience. “Stark,” he said quietly. “
Tony picked up a wrench and tapped it against the table.  She was right.  Steve liked the squirrel.  He thought it was funny.  “Probably not.”  He paused, still tapping the wrench restlessly.  “Where is Steve, FRI?  What’s he up to?”
Tony drank his coffee, then shook his own head.  “That’s not true,” he scoffed.  “I hated you when we first met.”
“Christ, Steve,” Tony muttered, and pulled him to him. Steve came gratefully, allowing Tony to wrap him in his arms one last time. Letting his tears fall against Tony’s shoulder, letting his hands clutch him extra-tight.
Steve cast his mind back, trying to remember what he could have said or done that would leave Tony with the impression that he would not call. That he didn’t want to see him. “‘Cause I didn’t promise?” he asked anxiously. “Is that why?” He shook his head. “I’m sorry. I just-I have...trouble with that. You know I do. But that’s no excuse. It’s not. I’m sorry. I really will get better.”
“It’d save time if they just checked us together, I guess,” Steve said, hooking a finger through Tony’s belt loop.  It was an easy gesture, one filled with a quiet possessiveness that sent a shockwave through Tony’s entire body.
Steve nodded.  “Wanda was right,Tony.  He wanted to break me.”  He looked into Tony’s eyes.  There was fear there, and anger, and a steely indomitability that made Tony weak in the knees for a whole host of other reasons.  Pride.  Respect.  Love.  “But, I didn’t break, Tony,” Steve said.  “I didn’t.  Not again.  Not like--”
"No, I'm not."  He held onto Steve's arm when he tried to pull away.  "They're here. They're right here. Oh my god."
Steve came to him and took his hand, but instead of sitting beside him on the bed, he sank to his knees in front of him. Tony’s brain and body both tried to disconnect from reality when that happened, but he forced them back. Forced them to come back to the here and now by sheer force of his tremendous will.
“I don’t.”  Tony shrugged, relishing the sweet warmth of Steve’s mouth against the palm of his hand, relishing how personal it felt.  How intimate.  “I don’t need that.  I know who we are, baby.  I don’t need a government seal of approval.”
Steve scratched down the words Tony had said, then looked expectantly back over his shoulder at him.
Steve tucked his debit card back into its slot, then folded his wallet. He shoved it in his pocket. Tony reached for him as he passed, but Steve brushed by him without a glance. “I’ll be in the car,” he said to Nat, and then he was gone.
Beneath his hands, Steve moved.  He tilted his head, drew in a deep breath.  “Hey,” Tony coaxed.  “Wake up, Steve.  Come on.  Please.”
Tony got dressed.  He put on a suit.  Armani, gray, impeccable, and black wing-tips that might have looked old-fashioned on someone else, but on him, looked amazing, if he did say so himself.  He knotted his tie in a double-windsor, and left.  He hated himself a little for dressing up, but if he was going to grovel, he might as well do it with style.
“So, your sexiness quotient wasn’t high enough already? You have to smoke now too?” Tony asked, eyeing his cigarette. “You really have changed.”
On Wednesday, he was stocking shelves when his boss came over to him. Steve was kneeling on the floor. He wasn’t stocking tomatoes this time--it was boxes of cereal--but he was still reminded of the day months ago when Tony had come and stood over him just the way his boss was doing now.
He opened his eyes. Tony’s were there. Big and bright and deep. And he was smiling. Just a little, but he was smiling. Steve thought he had never felt happier in his whole life. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, I’m okay.” He nudged Tony with his shoulder. “Are you okay?”
He’d moved back up here in November.  It was as easy working from here as it was from the Tower, with the added bonus that if Ross ever wanted to see him, he’d have to travel a lot more out of his way.  That would cut his visits by a lot.  That had been on Tony’s Christmas wish-list, and as they always say, Santa helped those who helped themselves.  Or something like that.
“Scary?” Tony asked bitterly. “I froze. She was just lying there, and I froze. I could see she wasn’t moving. Her chest wasn’t moving, like she couldn’t
Steve sat in the corner.  He didn't watch what was happening around him, but he was aware of it.  Natasha and Bruce sat with him, one on either side, bookending him, propping him up between them.  He chewed his nail. He fidgeted. He refused every attempt at conversation. His mind was blank. Carefully,
every time they were together and didn’t think about at all when they weren’t. And later, when they were in bed, and Steve was holding him down by the neck and fucking him into the mattress just the way Pietro liked, and Pietro was saying his name over and over, Steve tried so hard to convince himself--again--that the next ten years were as important as the last ten. That he had something to look forward to that equaled his reasons for looking back. Telling himself that the reality of Pietro was as important to him as the memory of Tony.
been a comfort to me. Adelle and I used to light a candle for you every week. First when you were sick as a little boy, and then when you got older, and… Then when you were overseas. Every week.”
Tony’s eyes shot to the door.  The lake community didn’t have a police officer, but the County Sheriff’s Department took turns tooling through every few hours, busting up teenage drinking parties and catching out-of-town speeders.  This was probably the same one Tony had passed on his way home.  Back when all he had to worry about was getting home before the food got too cold.
have looked up. He was here with Natasha and a few of her other friends, celebrating Nat’s birthday. They were drinking, and laughing, and dancing, all of them having fun. Tony was sitting at their table, sipping his drink. His boyfriend, Josh, was curled around him, whispering in his ear. Beneath the table, Josh’s hand was resting high up on his thigh, massaging it a little, and Tony was feeling pretty good. Calm. Comfortable. Not hard, but feeling pretty confident that he could get there whenever he and Josh finally decided to leave. They had a suite at a hotel downtown. They’d already defiled the bed and the shower. He thought the sofa--and maybe the balcony, in spite of the chilly night air--might be on tonight’s itinerary.
Steve laughed, his breath heady against Tony’s throat, his tongue a revelation against his skin. “He’s a pretty needy dog.”
Tony shook his head.  “Adorable,” he murmured, and Steve laughed.  He felt better.  Even if the cat--
“See?” Steve said. “That’s what I mean. The best thing in the whole world. And you never would have broken up with me, would you?”
Instead of answering, Steve turned to Wanda.  He took her face in his hands, framing it, and gazed at her for a long time before drawing her close and kissing her cheek.  “I’m glad I got to see you.  I’m sorry you came all this way for nothing.”
Steve laughed again, quiet and dark.  “Don’t be too hard on me.  It’s only my second one in what?  Eighty years, or so?”
There weren’t many dogs here, and the ones who were here, were being hurried through their afternoon walks by harried-looking owners who didn’t even let them off their leashes. Tony smiled a little, watching them. He understood. If he hadn’t been going so stir-crazy in his own apartment, he wouldn’t be out here either.
Part of him had assumed Natasha would be the one to handle Steve.  But she slipped out of the room leaving the door cracked.  Wanda turned expectantly to Tony.
Steve bowed his head. Tony couldn’t be sure--because he could not be sure of anything at the moment--but he thought maybe Steve had smiled. Maybe he ducked his head to hide it.
“Just make sure you show him every day,” he said, never quavering at all. “Tell him every day. You’d fucking better.”
Tony grunted and held on stubbornly tight. “Not yet,” he said. “I think I need this for a few more minutes first.”
“I told you I”m not going to watch that, Tony,” Steve warned.  “It glorifies mafia violence.  I saw enough of that in the neighborhood when I was a kid.”
Tony shook his head against Steve’s chest. His hair brushed the underside of Steve’s chin. “It’s stupid,” he said, and laughed a jagged, bitter little laugh. “My dad and I got into a fight.” He clenched his fist into the back of Steve’s t-shirt, holding him tight. “I didn’t want to stay there, so I just. You know. Came here.”
Tony laughed softly. “You don’t have to, though. He just needs to cool down. So do I. Then it’ll be fine.”
“Our little insurrectionist pals over there. FRIDAY clocked them when they came in and alerted me.” He leaned into her hand a bit, taking the bait without even realizing it. “I had it all under control until I saw you two over-achievers getting ready to go all Colonel Sanders on their asses.”
“Steve,” Sarah said, and Steve stood up and dropped into her arms. She held him close, rubbed his back. “I love you, honey,” she said.
So, he rode, his mind worrying the problem, looking for a solution that never came.  When it didn’t, when there was nothing else, it retreated to another place, another time, another puzzle that he could never figure out.  It retreated to Tony Stark.
“That’s okay,” the kid said. “But you should start thinking right now of how you’re going to make it up to me.” He raised an eyebrow and made a show of cocking his head at just the right angle to look at Steve’s left hand. “Or is he married and just doesn’t like to wear a ring?”
. Those words that meant everything, but still didn’t seem like quite enough when it came to Steve Rogers who carried his own words with him. Words that Tony blocked out before they could find their way over, or around, or through his hastily-constructed heart-walls.
“If I was going to blow you, I would have asked for longer than a minute,” Steve said.  “You know I like to take my time.”
His hand was still clutching Steve’s. Steve turned it, lifted it to his lips and kissed it. “That’s a first.”
Tony swallowed past a lump that had suddenly lodged itself in his throat. “I-I’ll bet it’s great, baby.”
Finally, Steve looked at him, and Tony drew in a sharp breath. He’d forgotten what that felt like. To have Steve Rogers’s undivided attention. How it felt to have those eyes boring into his own, the blue dark and intense. It made his knees buckle.
“I know,” Steve said, ducking his head.  His thumb came up to his mouth and he chewed the already-ragged nail.  “It just...reminds me of before.”
Steve led him into the bedroom. It was bigger than Steve’s bedroom upstairs, and the bed was larger--a king, Tony saw, making him smile--but it was still painfully neat, the bed made up with another white comforter and white sheets. It looked soft, almost cloud-like, and Tony could not wait to sink down onto it with Steve above him. Thank Christ, the wait was over. They were here. Finally. Together.
He called Steve, but no one answered. He left a message on his machine, vowing again to get him a cell-phone for Christmas. Or his birthday. His birthday was right around the corner. A cell-phone would be a very nice gift. And then he thought about his
Steve held out his hand, and Tony came to him and took it, gripping it tightly. “What do you want to do?” Steve asked, his thumb caressing Tony’s knuckles.
Tony let go of him and dropped to his knees.  He licked his lips, then took Steve into his mouth and sucked him down hard.  Steve’s hand came to his hair and fisted there, tugging just this side of too hard.  Tony’s vision blurred as he looked up at Steve’s face.  He was beauty personified.  Michelangelo’s
Tony touched his cheek, urged him over so he could kiss his lips. “Do you really have to go?” he whispered, stroking his cheek.
“No,” Tony said, matching his tone.  “No, don’t.”  He reached out, laid his hand against Steve’s chest.  It was as firm as ever.
, stewing over it, going over and over it in his head.  Lying in an anonymous motel bed with a neon sign outside the window or bunking down in some shifty-eyed acquaintance’s attic, sometimes it was
Steve plucked the tablet out of Tony’s resisting fingers, ignoring the instant pout and grabby-hands of his partner, and sat it on his own bedside table.  “No,” he said firmly.  “No more.  You’re gonna freak these poor people out.”
The image of Peter sitting on the old leather sofa talking about sugarplums was half-formed in the back of his mind when he saw someone there, standing at the window, hands shoved deep in his pockets, looking down at the city.
“Start with ‘hello’ and see where it goes from there.”  She squeezed his hands.  “You’ve carried that torch for a long time, Steve.  Maybe you need to put it down and just try being his friend again.”
the drink. He didn't think he'd ever not want it, but he was finding ways to go without it. And that was good. It felt good. Like a win.
But he wasn’t alone now.  He had friends.  He had family.  He had Steve.  He didn’t worry about being alone when he died.  Or after he died.  Not anymore.  They’d all be there with him, and Steve would be there after.  He’d promised.  It had been part of their marriage vows.
Steve glanced at his watch. 5:55. He looked at the bus. The other soldiers hugging and kissing their loved ones. Saying good-bye. “I gotta go,” he said, and Morgan started to cry, clutching him extra-tight.
McDonald’s now,” he said innocently. “I’m sure we can still go to the others, but I think that one’s off-limits. At least...according to the manager.”
“Don’t be,” Bruce said, fiddling with his tie.  “I’ll be right up there with you.”  He pulled on the ends of the gray silk, then sighed, frustrated.  “Will you do this?  I can’t ever get it right.”
“I don’t make the news, baby, I just report it.  It’s noisy and smoggy and people throw their trash on the ground and piss on the subway.”
Tony thought Steve laughed a little.  There was certainly a note of humor in his tone when he said, “I’ll crush you.”
Steve smiled.  “Good,” he said, then went back to dinner.  He put the garlic bread in the oven, and took the salad out of the fridge.
Steve gave Sam a warning look, flashing pleading eyes at him. “Nothing,” he said lightly. “Just dumb stuff.”
Steve looked at Nick and Strange.  They were powerful men.  Arguably, two of the most powerful men in the world--maybe in the galaxy--and they were on his side.  He shrugged, turning back to Ross.  “I don’t know,” he said.  “It kinda feels like I might be.”
“How do you come back from that?” he asked.  His eyes were downcast, far away.  He was back in that bunker, the shield in his hands, ready to deliver the final crushing blow.  She could almost see him there.  “Is is even possible?”
Tony’s routine was familiar too.  All work, some play, never a dull boy.  Avengers stuff came first, just as it always had, but after people saw the Charger he’d given Jeff and the Hemi Cuda he himself drove around now, he’d found himself with a healthy little side-business of fixing and upgrading cars.  He didn’t charge much--just the cost of parts--and would have happily done it for free, but these were country people.  They wanted to pay their own way.  Tony respected that and charged them a little.  He donated whatever they paid to the town’s organizations, so it was all okay in his mind.  After work, he’d join Steve for dinner and a movie or a couple hours of TV before they’d each retire to their own living quarters--Tony in their old bedroom, Steve in the loft--where they would spend the night thinking about each other.
“God, leave it to you to actually have an amazing reason.  Maybe I should buy out every shop in the city for her.”
crowded, and Steve didn’t really like crowds that much anymore. He was getting better--he felt like he was getting a little better, anyway--but he still didn’t like crowds.
Tony stood where he was.  The bottle dangled from his hand.  His robe flapped open in the breeze, and if the cool air around his privates meant anything, he wasn’t wearing any pants.  “Hey,” he said.  “Hey, you mad?”  He stumbled a step toward Rhodey.  His foot came down on the tie to his robe, and he tripped and fell.
Tony could hear movement in the bathroom now.  The water in the sink turning on and off.  The soft scrub of Steve’s toothbrush against his teeth.  The water again.  After that, it was quiet for a long time.  Tony thought he was probably shaving.  The police had taken his old straight razor as evidence that night so long ago now, and all that was in there was a disposable Bic he had picked up at the pharmacy during that all-too-brief month he had spent here between The Raft and the prison.  Tony had wondered if he would buy another straight razor.  He was better with it.  He’d used one for his whole life, but he’d made no attempt to get one in spite of the nicks he always ended up with when using the Bic.
The lights in the cabin popped on, banishing the shadows and throwing the whole, bloody scene into sharp relief.
“Don’t do that,” Tony said. He put his forehead against Steve’s hard chest, fingers digging into his sides. “You can’t put that on me. Not if we’re not- It’s not fair.”
Tony bit his lip to keep from smiling.  It didn’t work.  “Steve,” he said, “don’t make me spell it out for you.”
‘just tired’.” She rubbed Nick’s back and shot Tony a meaningful look. “And if Sam or Steve asks, that’s what you tell them. If there’s more to tell later on, I’ll do it then. Okay?”
“Unless and until he does something that warrants my attention,” Ross said, “he’s no longer my concern.”
to home, but not home, and the departure time at the airport. The ticket price was astronomical, but he didn’t care. He had plenty of money now. At least for his needs. He had set up an allotment for his mother when he first joined the army, but didn’t actually use much of his own paycheck beyond the basics.
One traitorous tear fell from his eye as she pulled away.  She touched it with her fingertip.  “I’ll come back if I can.”
Tony slid into the booth next to him.  Clint scooted in on Bruce’s side.  “What are you sorry for?” he asked and snagged a muffin.  “Blueberry?”
Sarah scrutinized him, her eyes flashing over his face. “Don’t bottle it in, Steve,” she said softly. “If there
He ran his hand down Steve’s neck and planted it in the middle of his chest.  He felt the wild thunder of his heart under the pads of his fingers and pushed him back.  It broke the kiss, and Steve looked at him with lust-laced eyes, breathing heavily.
Natasha stopped.  Her building was right there.  Their window on the sixth floor was open.  Looking up, Tony saw the curtains belling gracefully out.  The cat, an orange thing with a white bib, lay on the sill.  It didn’t have a name.  Nor, Nat insisted, did it actually live there.  It just came and went.  That seemed to be a family trait, too.
He recognized the near-insanity of his thoughts as he drove back the way he'd come, retracing his route back to the hospital and Tony, and as he neared that place, that shadowy, golden place on the road, that hair-pin turn, he took his phone out and called Natasha.
--to ignore the sounds that had suddenly taken over the corner table. Tony was right there with him. He was trying too, but by
Small seeds of anger began to take root in Steve’s stomach.  “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
When they were lit--or as lit as possible--they all sang “Happy Birthday”. Except Tony. He stayed in the shadows while they did. He felt like shit. Especially when he saw how happy Steve looked. How comfortable he was with everybody else. Why didn’t Steve look over here? Why didn’t he look for Tony like he always did?
The back lawn was set up with rows of chairs creating the aisle down the middle.  There was none of the traditional splitting into “sides” though.  That was laughable.  Everybody coming was family, and this was casual.  No separation needed.  Or wanted.
He opened the door and held it while Steve rolled past.  “Maybe next you’ll finally tell me what a pangolin is.”
Steve tugged at his tie.  They’d decided, after much debate, to forgo tuxes for the event.  Tuxedos, while traditional and “James Bond-y”--Tony’s words--were also a little too “flashy”--Steve’s words--for a Saturday afternoon, lake-side affair.
known, and the gauntlet was already in his face before Ross could pull his own weapon out of its hiding place.
His tone, all tired and hurt rather than venomous, slipped like a knife into Steve’s heart.  He hated this, hated that he had to do this, but it was something that couldn’t be put off.  The end was drawing near.  Soon, someone would come and tell them it was time and then it would be too late.  Steve couldn’t afford 'too late'.  Not when the stakes were this high.
Tony reached out and took the cigarette out of Steve’s fingers. He looked at Steve as he brought it to his own lips, took a drag, then let it out. “Even if it’s just a cigarette?” he said.
Howard swallowed the rest of his coffee and stood up. He held out his hand. “Thank you again for letting me come here.”
He made a quick butter and lemon pan sauce, then threw together a salad.  It was a simple meal.  Nothing fancy, but he still felt proud of it nonetheless.  He wondered what his mom would think if she could see this.  If she could see her only son puttering around the kitchen making dinner, and washing up as he went, and setting the table, and getting out candles because it had been a while since they’d had a candlelit dinner, and even though it was just a Wednesday, and it was just chicken cutlets and salad, Steve still wanted it to be nice.  Especially tonight.  Especially after two weeks of being hated.  He wondered if she would be proud of what she saw.  He knew she would be proud of what he’d
“I don’t think so either,” she said. “You’re crazy about him, and he worships you. It’s obvious. It was obvious before, but I had to reserve judgement. You know I did.”
Anger and distress flared in Steve’s chest, but he tamped them both down. “Are you okay?” he asked gently. “He didn’t hurt you?”
And it was hard. Harder than he would have ever thought possible. His breath came in shallow little gasps as Tony continued to touch him, continued to let his finger travel over his body. He never would have thought that not being able to watch what Tony was doing would have such an effect on him, but it did. His nerves felt frayed, his muscles tense to the trembling point under Tony’s light touch. He tried to control that too, but he couldn’t quite do it, and maybe that was okay. Maybe Tony needed to know that as hard as Steve tried, he was still affected.
, after all--and let him kiss him senseless. Let him do other things too. Let him do whatever he wanted, and damn the fact that the librarian could come along at any second to see just what the fuck those strange noises were coming from the self-help section.
Steve walked them toward the bed, still kissing him, limping on his bad left leg, until the backs of Tony’s knees hit the mattress.
He couldn’t call Tony. He’d already decided that would never work, but he knew where the Stark Industries offices were. Sure, he did. He passed by it sometimes. When he did, he never looked at it. He just kept walking with his head down, his hands shoved into his pockets, trying to look like a man who didn’t know anything about anyone in that building. That it meant nothing to him.
Steve shook his head. "That's not the point, Tony. I don't care if he presses charges. I don't care if-"
“It’s not that, Tony,” Steve said, and just as Tony had feared, there was a coldness to his voice, like a shot of ice water in his veins. “I’m not just some mindless drone.”
Steve put his hand on Tony’s waist, his thumb edging under his shirt to touch his skin.  He bent down and kissed Tony’s mouth.  It was short and sweet, just a two-second press of his lips, but Tony wouldn’t change it for anything.  “Okay.”
Steve smiled. “Don’t tell anyone,” he said, leaning in close like he was telling Tony a grave secret, “but I already scooped a bunch out into another bowl for you. I snuck it down to the fridge in the lab.”
Steve looked at them, then held them up for Doctor Strange to see.  They’d stitched them just to be on the safe side.  The sedatives they dumped into him every night slowed the serum down too.  He still healed extraordinarily fast, but it wasn’t instantaneous.  And he had bitten deeply.  Down to the bone.
“You keep saying that,” Steve said.  “I keep doing things, and you keep saying that.  When’s it going to stop being okay?”
They slept then, both slipping away, secure in each other’s arms.  A few hours later, Steve threw the blanket away, huffing in his sleep.  Tony woke up, shaking his head even as he still drowsed.  He didn’t sleep, though, not fully, and when Steve shivered against him thirty minutes later, Tony was there to pull the blanket back up over him.
“I’m fine,” Steve said, and rubbed his cheek into Tony’s palm.  “I’m just tired.  Finals and-and stuff.”
Tony waved a hand and filled two cups with coffee. He dumped sugar into his own and handed Steve his undoctored. “It’s close enough,” he said. “Morgan will be up soon anyway.”
“Hi,” he breathed, cupping Steve’s cheek to tip his head back, gaining him fuller access to his mouth.
Beside them, Dodger shifted from foot to foot. He looked up at Steve and whined, his brown eyes almost seeming to look worried. And when that happened, Steve’s cleared. That sharp edge to his gaze softened, and it was Steve again. Just Steve. He reached down and patted Dodger’s flank. “It’s okay, Dodge,” he whispered. “I’m okay.”
Tony exhaled as if Ross had punched him in the gut.  “What did you just say?” he gasped, and a mean, diaphanous thought sailed through his head--
He went to the lab when he got home. Steve was working and wouldn’t be home until the wee hours. Everyone else was gone too. Even Clint, who had become the near-constant snarky devil on his shoulder lately, was nowhere to be found. It was okay. There was always something down in the lab he could work on to pass the time, and he headed down there without even going up to the penthouse first.
“Do you have everything?” Sarah asked, and Steve smiled a little indulgently. It was the fourth or fifth time she had asked.
“Are you going to take my clothes off this time?” Tony asked. “I miss that. You taking all my clothes off.”
The man had straightened and shook himself visibly. He took his glasses back off and rubbed his eyes before holding out his hand for Steve to shake. “Interesting, Mr. Rogers,” he had said. “Very interesting. I think we’ll be in touch with you soon.”
“She doesn’t mean it that way,” Bruce said, putting a consoling hand on Tony’s arm while simultaneously shooting a distraught look at Natasha.
Tony got to his feet and walked to where Bruce and Sam stood, watching the two on the porch.  No one spoke, not even a bird cried, as if knowing this moment was sacred.  It was peace, love, friendship defined, and even when Natasha rose up higher on her knees and kissed him, Tony did not feel jealous.  Instead, he felt uplifted, honored to be here to witness this coming together of two people he loved so much.
A hot, devilish little gleam appeared in Steve’s eye.  With that smile, the look was nearly more than Tony could take.  “Did you wanna punish him, Tony?” he asked darkly.  “Give him a good spanking?”
He glanced at Morgan’s picture again, thought of the way she’d felt all curled up in his arms as he’d carried her into her bedroom. The happy sound of her voice babbling in the back seat of Tony’s car. How good that had felt. How sweet. Thought of Tony in his arms just a bit later. How good that had felt too. He looked back at his mother, then nodded toward the photo, smiling a tiny smile.
A razor-sharp sliver of hate slipped into Tony’s heart. He gripped Steve’s arm tighter. “Did he hurt you?”
“Yay,” Tony said, and Steve could hear the smile in his voice.  Tony snuggled closer.  “I want a black one.”
“It wasn’t your fault, Steve,” Tony said, leaning forward himself, putting his elbows on his knees. “What happened. It wasn’t your fault.”
Steve stood up slowly. He put the last box of Lucky Charms on the shelf. Straightened it so it was in line with the others. “Um. It might be.”
Fury dropped his hand and walked away, his back turned.  Strange stood and joined him.  They whispered to each other tensely.
The lines were back, uncertainty painted in broad, dark strokes across his face.  “Are you sure?  I mean, I thought that was...I shouldn’t have just assumed...”
you just getting home?”Tony asked. “Have you and Wilson been out painting the town red this whole time?”
Howard nodded, like it was just as he had expected. “Yes,” he said. “She’s very lucky to have you boys to be with her.”
She took the lapels of his jacket in her hand and looked him squarely in the eye.  “No,” she said.  “I don’t hear from him, but I know where he is.  If you want me to tell you--”
He’d taken a walk down to the dock with Bruce, giving the three former rogues some time to themselves, and when they came back, twenty minutes later, Steve had grinned up at him and taken his hand.
Tony crawled over him to get to his side of the bed and flopped down beside him. “I’m not going to work,” he said. “I already called in. What kind of example would I be setting if I said one thing then did the exact opposite?”
Steve wordlessly drew their still-clasped hands nearer, curling them close enough to kiss Tony’s knuckles.
, I might be able to swing it, but-” he threw a hand out in Howard’s direction, gesturing at him sarcastically, “-well, I mean, come on. Look at you.”
likes Dodger,” she said, emphasizing it heavily, as if in a warning, and he nodded, thinking how smart she really was. How clever. Behind them, he could feel old Dodger lying down again, the No-Dogs-On-The-Bed rule forgotten, like
Steve said nothing, just looked at her, tears brimming in his eyes, making them shine all the brighter.  He reached out and touched the soft fall of her hair.
Steve stopped walking and turned to him. He was dressed very simply tonight. Just a white t-shirt and faded denim, but Tony thought he was absolutely stunning. Maybe even better than this morning. It reminded him a little of that night on the roof when he’d caught him skinny-dipping, and if he hadn’t been so upset, he might have tried to jump him right there, but he
Steve nodded, and his hand crept out and touched the cuff of Tony’s pants. “Yeah,” he said. “A lot. And not just tonight, Tony. Before. When we weren’t talking much. I missed you then, too.”
