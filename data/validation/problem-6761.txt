“Over a thousand dollars for a phone?!”  Christ, he’s never going to get used to inflation.  Still, even adjusting for his antiquated conception of money, that still seems a ridiculously high amount to pay for a cell phone, no matter what it can do.
There.  That sounded appropriately aromantic, right?  Just two friends, enjoying each other’s company and fending off society vultures.  No ulterior motive at all.
coming from somewhere on Natasha’s end of the line, and he briefly bites back a pang of jealousy.  He can’t help but feel that boredom is relative.
Somehow, Steve doubts that would go across well. He’s starting to get the impression that Stark has a bit of an attitude problem.
It’s over before Steph really has a chance to appreciate the experience.  New York’s really not that big of a city and the suit is fast, so the trip doesn’t last all that long.  Still, that night when she’s thinking back through events of the day, she can still feel a lingering arm around her waist and the surprisingly warm press of metal against her cheek.
She’s died once — or as good as —  and she has absolutely no intention of repeating the experience.  The serum’s great, but she doubts that it can reconstitute ashes, so that means she going to have to jump.  She’s not really looking forward to the experience, but she’ll make it out okay.  Probably.  At any rate, it’s her best option.
“You seem to have a pretty good grasp of humor and sarcasm.”  Steve has learned his lesson; after his first, extremely misguided comparison of JARVIS to Dum-E, he’s grasped the value of a well-timed compliment.  Despite being a compilation of code and circuit board, JARVIS is acutely prone to flattery.
“Actually, I work for SHIELD.  I just liaise with you.”  Tony glares at him, and Steve’s not sure he appreciates the distinction.  Steve regroups.  “Are you still going to work on the Helicarrier designs after you finish your hospital battery?”
“Are you sure?  You seem a bit...off.”  Steve tries to keep his voice nonjudgmental, afraid that he’s overstepped his bounds.
After a few moments of a blank screen, Steve determines that their conversation is over for now.  He moves to close the app, when a pop-up catches his eye:  “Would you like to save this contact?”
When JARVIS has first suggested the MET, he’d laughed his ass off.  He can mentally recall, in excruciating detail, every single time he’s been forced to go to some sort of fundraiser inside of the museum where he’s been forced to look at a single dot and relate it to the existential quandary of the human existence.  So deep.  So moving.
“Actually,” he rejoins, “U’s over there,” Tony responds, gesturing toward the fabrication corner of the lab.  “U and Butterfingers.”
And Steve is responding more enthusiastically than he ever could have wished for.  His hands have curled around Tony’s back, pulling him tight to his chest as if he’s never going to let him go.  Everywhere their bodies touch feels like it’s on fire, each point of contact a tiny flame that builds the longer they maintain contact.
“Can’t we just blow it off and apologize later?”  His voice may or may not resemble a whine at this point.  Slightly.  He’s really not up for speaking to…whomever he’s supposed to speak to, and Jimmy Choo’s are a great way to say I’m sorry.
“Exactly.”  When he doesn’t respond right away, Nat keeps on talking.  “Steve, Tony Stark is the chief stockholder and lead developer for a Fortune 500 company, not to mention the exclusive mind behind the Iron Man armor.  It’s nearly impossible to make a dent in his schedule.  He’s thrown out each and every SHIELD agent that Fury has tried to send him over the years, yet you get pretty much unfettered access to him on a daily basis and, for all intents and purposes, have somehow managed to insinuate yourself into his personal life.”
Of course, he’s not going to admit any that to Fury. Instead, he tries to explain himself as best he can without sounding like he’s unhinged.
He can see Steve slowly coming back into himself, leaving whatever horrific place his mind had taken him to and rejoining the present.  Tony slowly lifts his hands to where Steve can see them, and after a moment’s hesitation, he places one of them on Steve’s knees.  The strongly muscled thigh feels tense under his palm, but he gently moves his hand back and forth over the muscle, all the while murmuring reassuring nonsense words.
“Tony,” he admonishes, trying to sound as authoritative as possible.  He thinks he at least partially succeeded, because Tony’s breaks his stare.
for him.  Maybe the awkwardness is just him projecting?  Whatever the case, it’s nice to get some external confirmation that he’s not crazy.
When he lets go, Tony seems dazed and the slightest bit confused, but at least his confusion has stemmed from a more positive source this time around.  Steve takes advantage of Tony’s disorientation and snakes his arm around the back of the couch.  His hand is currently dangling a couple of inches beyond Tony’s right shoulder, but, if he’s lucky, he should be able to inch it closer over the course of the movie.  Slowly, though.  He’s pretty much used up his quota of luck for the night, and he doesn’t want to risk anything.
She smiles and the movement transforms her face. He wonders just how many smiles that he’s been an unknowing witness to, how many grins and smirks and laughs have been hidden behind a faceplate. Dozens? Hundreds? It doesn’t matter. He just knows he wants to see that smile again and, with luck and effort, inspire a few.
“Look, I know you're sort of out of touch with the modern world, but pick up any tabloid from the last ten years or so and you’ll figure out exactly why the thought of me as some sort of superhero is laughable at best.  I don’t have the temperament.  People would never trust Tony Stark to be the one to fly into danger and make the hard choices.  The man inside that suit, he’s everything that I can never be.  He’s the guy you want next to you when the sky starts falling in, not me.  I’m just the bankroll.”
“I’ll meet them on the landing pad,” Steve answers as he sprints to the stairwell, not trusting the elevators to get him there faster. With any luck, he can be waiting for them when they land.
“Aside from Dum-E.”  The robot in question offers a series of offended sounding beeps from his charging station across the lab, and Tony offers him one sardonic eyebrow in response.  Steve allows himself a brief moment of amusement, before rubbing the sleep crust out of his eyes.  “I thought you weren’t due back until tomorrow.”
“Be my guest,” Tony bit off sharply and stormed his way into the lab.  It was only he after he’d gone back inside that he finally stopped to realize the significance of Rogers’ lunchbox.  Glaring out through the darkened glass, he’d turn to see just exactly what else Rogers brought with him.  He couldn’t make out much, as the other man’s massive bulk was still blocking his view, but after a moment the agent turned and sat down against the wall, and Tony caught a glimpse of Rogers’ provisions: a frighteningly large lunchbox, a lumpy messenger bag, and some sort of notepad lay propped along the wall.  The implications of those objects were irritating, particularly when Rogers pulled a book out of his bag and slouched against the wall like he belonged there.
Well it just sounds bad when you say it like that.  “Yes,” he responds, though his answer sounds more like a question than a statement.
” he says, voice rising.  “I’m pretty sure that’s the literal definition of an Act of God.  So by all means, go ahead.  I’d love to see Fury try to argue breach of contract.  Plus, it’s not exactly the best idea to piss off the guy you’re asking to build your engines.”
“Since when do you take Steve’s side on everything?” he asks, somewhat disgruntled at his AI’s extreme unhelpfulness.
Not the verbal fighting, that is.  Those spats leave her angry and wondering if the fragment of the serum that lets Bruce hulk out made has somehow been lying dormant in her bloodstream all this time.  (To be fair, those have tapered off lately.)  Combat, though, combat is where they shine.  Whenever someone points them at an enemy and says
“That’s the thing about Stark,” she says, sitting down and passing him a bottle.  “He’ll talk right over you if you give him half a chance, and he’s lightning fast with his comebacks, especially when he’s defensive.  It’s only later that you realize what you
“You mean – ”  Steve nods toward the display of armors along the far wall, and Tony braces himself.  They’ve never really talked about the red and gold elephants in the room, but now, if ever, is the time.
“Ummm, type it into the search bar?”  Tony asks slowly.  “I mean, the article originally came out in the late 80s, but I’m pretty sure it’s been digitized by now.”
“On the most basic level, but that’s a ridiculously narrow attitude to take toward a phone.”  Tony reaches out and grabs both of Steve’s shoulders, trying to ignore just how high of a reach that it is.  “Steve,” he starts, “if Windows Vista and Samsung had a sleazy one night stand, that phone is their torrid love child. And it’s not a pretty child either, Steve.  That phone is the kid that sits on the edge of the playground eating dirt while its parents wait on the farthest bench and pretend it doesn’t belong to them.  Seriously, if I ever see that flip phone again, we can’t be friends.”
“I just don’t see the point in all of this.”  She barely resists gesturing towards Tasha, but the other woman seems to get the unspoken point.
“ – but it’s painfully clear you need to be brought up to speed.  So I figure the best way to do that is to set a baseline for what you do and don’t know.”
“Every waking second.” Steve wishes she was being sarcastic, but the tone of her voice has him thinking that she’s being deadly sincere.
“Yes, I did,” Fury replies extending his hand for a handshake. The two men shake hands, and Fury gestures to one of the visitor’s chairs, stating, “Sit down Captain.”
“They were able to extract the bullet fairly cleanly. Nothing vital was hit, so you make a full recovery with time and rest.”
On second thought, he is the tiniest bit groggy, and, as much as he hates to admit it, JARVIS kind of has a point.  He’s going to be of no use tonight if he crashes right in the middle of their date, and, considering their lousy track record, that’s probably a distinct possibility.  And that couch looks really comfy…
The ultimate irony is, there’s nothing remotely interesting about the situation.  It’s an apartment fire; a cold front prompts a slew of heater-usage and one loose coil sets a high-rise ablaze.  When she sees the smoke rising, she speeds towards the plume, trusting that someone on the street will call 911 and dispatch the proper authorities.  The elevator shafts won’t be safe, so she heads towards the stairwell, cautiously elbowing through the sea of people heading the other way.  The air gets thicker as she climbs, and she can hear the building creaking at the seams.  If she’s going to do something’s she needs to do it fast.
“Tony, it’s eight in the morning,” he responds with a shake of his head.  Someone is clearly not in the right time zone.  His assumption is immediately confirmed when Tony’s eyes shift down and to the right, in what Steve has come to know as his “thinking face.”
Tony stops his rant with a sigh.  “Later.  Looks like it’s time for both of us to suit up.”  He turns his head toward the balcony, but then he abruptly pivots back to Steve.  “Do you even have – ”  He immediately gets what Tony’s driving at.  “I’ve taken to carrying it around with me ever since Central Park.”  He moves toward his bag, eager to fetch the suit that’s tightly bundled at the bottom.
“It’s wonderful!” Steve gushes, eager to steer away from the topic of windows that shouldn’t be breakable.  “I found that newspaper article you told me about, and I was able to read the whole thing, and after I finished, the computer started recommending other articles I might like to read.  It really is great.”
The internet completely solves that problem.  All he has to do is click on the icon Ana highlighted during her “Welcome” tour, type a question into the gray box, and all the information he could ever want magically appears at his fingertips.  Better yet, anything underlined in blue pulls up
Even Pepper has to stop and think about that one.  “It’s...unusual, I’ll admit.  But for being part-time superheroes, the two of you are surprisingly domestic.”
“JARVIS, transfer several grand into the discretionary fund.  I have a feeling I’m going to need it.”
Except for the times when it’s not.  Because living with the woman means that Steph is privy to a lot of things that she would be a lot better off not knowing, thank you very much.  Like how despite her tiny size, Tasha has a surprisingly high tolerance for alcohol.  Or that she survives on a minimal amount of sleep.  Or that apparently she’s comfortable with dating both men and women because she’s
“Indeed,” JARVIS’ voice announces from speakers in the ceiling, “I am more than capable of responding to any inquiries you direct my way.”
(and, oh, there’s a story there).  Ergo, she’d claimed, the government could not curtail the actions of a private citizen, nor could they lay claim to the Iron Woman technology, which was private intellectual property.  If she chooses to distribute privately owned footage of an event that happened in a very public venue in the interest of transparency, well that was her business now, wasn't it?  She also manages to insinuate, mid-rant, that she’d been very nice about not disclosing the origins of the missile strike, because the public might be interested to know that a subset of the United Nations had fired on New York City.
“Not everything’s that clear-cut.  I think they’re going to try to restore the ones that aren’t in pieces and then seek donations for the empty pedestals.  I thoroughly expect the mayor’s office to come knocking any day now.”  Because clearly, he doesn’t have enough things to pay for.
He snakes one hand around Natasha’s waist, not willing to spend one more second any farther apart than he has to, but the moment he draws her in, the soft moans she’d been issuing against his lips break off into a cry of pain. He backs away as quickly as his reflexes will allow, because
Her lips curve in several false starts as if she’s battling back a whole range of responses and can’t resolve on a single response and instead have tried to shape all of them at once. Strangely enough, Steve’s seen video coverage that captures a reaction very similar to this one, but on that occasion, Natasha had lit into a reporter who’d spoken disparagingly of Bruce. The fact that that vitriol might be directed at him sends a chill down his spine, which is confirmed when Natasha inhales deeply and starts speaking in a deathly low voice.
tomorrow,” Tony intercedes.  “We’re definitely sleeping in.”  He accompanies the last bit with a possessive leer at the Captain, and…yep, he’s definitely missed a lot.
“I just didn’t know…” he stops himself, unsure of how to phrase the question. “Are we talking a Darth Vader situation or can you live without the helmet?”
Steve still looks dazed, but he attempts a sentence.  “The ship – the water – the ship was going down, and I just…I couldn’t watch it sink.”
“It is a rather bizarre film.”  The projection shifts to display an image of a man in a feathered hat with a longbow who’s balancing four, five,
They stumble into an odd equilibrium once Tasha gets back.  Steph never brings up their text conversation and Tasha doesn’t either, but it’s nestled between them all the same, the shared confidence fostering an intimacy.  It’s not perfect, and they still gripe at each other on occasion, but it’s something.
“I have indeed drawn my own conclusions based on your interactions with Sir.  I’m just perplexed as to why would want to hear it.”
He starts slowly, but the words begin to tumble out as he gets going.  “It started out as a means to an end.  There was a cave, I needed out of the cave, and I had a fixed amount of time to figure something out.  The thing is, the problems didn’t stop when I landed; if anything they got clearer.  Tony Stark had spent his whole life profiting off the world’s vice, but Iron Man...Iron Man could actually make a difference.  So when I got back I went into mechanic mode – upgraded the suit,  streamlined the systems, and, well, you know the rest.  I found someone foolish enough to pilot the suit, and the rest is history.”
Here it goes.  He’s been waiting for the moment when he needed to put his cover story into place, but now that it’s finally come he can’t help but feel a bit nervous now that it’s time to go through with it.  The lie itches, like a burr nestled under his skin, and he can’t help but shy away from what he’s about to do.  As luck would have it, though, his cover story justifies his implicit shame and reticence to talk.  He just has to lay out the facts and hope that Tony will leave well enough alone.  Maybe.  Possibly.  Probably not.
“We can reschedule if you want.” Steve is committed to making sure that he gets along with Shellhead’s girlfriend, but he’s not exactly sure if he is at the point where he can do that without an intermediary.
“Wait, are you just now figuring this out?” Natasha adds, looking at her partner with skepticism plastered over her face.
He doesn’t look too thrilled about it, though.  The residual stress from today’s events and the leftover maybe-we-shouldn’t-do-this vibes still have Tony looking relatively downcast.  More than that, Tony seems
The next few minutes are blurs of red, white, blue, and bronze, as he desperately tries to find a way to best subdue three large, metal assailants that are equipped with unnatural strength and foot-long claws.  It takes him far too long to incapacitate all three figures, but he eventually picks his way out of the bronzed bear carcases and starts working back to the team.
Steve pulls the cowl over his head and steps out in full uniform.  “When you say move, what exactly do you mean?”
Now he just has to resolve on the where the when and the how, but that’s quite a bit more difficult than it sounds. Putting that plan into action is going to be difficult at best and disastrous at worst.
Steve's voice resonates in the back of his head, a whisper that nevertheless cuts through the tempest in his mind.
“Is everything alright?”  Usually, the artificial voice radiates with a crisp, quasi-human personality, but JARVIS is...off somehow.
She’s being remarkably gracious, both about his rather clumsy stumble this morning and about everything in general, and twenty-four hours ago, Steve would have taken her claims at face value. Now he’s not so sure.
Steve smiles.  “Sure.”  Then to Tony’s ultimate surprise, Steve inches closer and lets the tip of his index finger brush against Tony’s own in an obvious invitation.  He wraps his fingers around Steve’s, trying desperately not to freak out about
Of course, there was no way they were going to be allowed to rest for more than a minute.  Just as Steve begins to get his breathing under control, he catches sight of the enchantress at the top of the terrace stairs.  Her eyes scan the plaza, lingering over the piles of rubble before turning with fury to the Avengers.
Pepper’s been his friend for a really long time.  She’s stuck with him through the good, the bad, the ugly, and even that brief attempt at dating that ended with them both agreeing they were better off keeping things platonic.  Aside from Rhodey, she’s probably been in his life longer than anyone, and she’s always called him on his shit.  More to the point, she’s one of very few people on the planet who can interpret that ‘yes’ for what it really means.
Definitely the second choice. It took him a couple of days to get around to visiting the library, but he’s been trying his best to catch up on the decades of history he’s missed. Some of it’s amazing – civil rights, the space program, computers – but other things leave him breathless and mildly sick. The day he read about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he slammed his book shut and spent the night running through New York streets that he no longer recognizes.
“He’s a menace,” Tony replies, not willing to let Dum-E get away with being a complete and total brat.  “He rarely does what he’s told, and he frequently breaks my things.”  The bot shrinks a little at that and draws even closer to Steve.  “Great!” Tony exclaims, gesturing toward his cowering bot.  “And now he’s a traitor.”
Admittedly, it wasn’t his best line. But so long as the content comes across clearly, he’ll eventually forgive himself for it. “You don't have to you know. Pine.”
Still, even with Tony gone, the empty lab space is still more personable than his lackluster SHIELD apartment.  Tony’d given him permission to ‘couch surf’ while he was gone, with the strict instructions that he was to mind the bots and water the ficus.  He assumes that he was being facetious about that last part, but he’d seemed genuine about the first.  At least, he’d decided the offer was genuine. For one, the amenities here are much nicer – he’s gotten a bit spoiled by having JARVIS on call and the WIFI speed is fantastic.  More to the point, it’s still the place where he feels the most comfortable.  He’s got sketchpads and books and that weird brand of protein bars that he actually likes all neatly arranged in his own little section of the room.  Even without Tony’s white noise sounding in the background, he’d much rather be somewhere he finds the slightest bit homey.
Every other time he’s been down here, the large swaths of space and the bizarre futuristic technology hadn’t intimidated him at all.  Even if the machines and blips and holographic screens were far beyond his comprehension, Tony was always
“What?  No!”  That just sounds wrong.  Although it is Steve, so...nope, still wrong.  “We haven’t even…”  Oh, crap, he did not mean to say that out loud.
Steve supposes it’s only natural that two people who spend so much time together might be drawn to one another. They’re both smart, driven workaholics who care deeply about the Avengers and the values the group upholds. Their relationship makes sense, which makes Steve’s visceral opposition to their being together romantically so bizarre.
His head snaps up ready to murder whoever’s dared to touch them, but, surprisingly, everyone else has maintained the proper perimeter.  He has no idea what to make of that, until an all-to-familiar voice slices through his thoughts.
Steve can only think of one person who could possibly mean to send him that message, and he’s currently buried in the depths of a Manhattan skyscraper.  Steve slides his finger across the screen to unlock his phone and begins to compose his very first text.
“I think I must have crashed last night,” he starts somewhat guiltily, rubbing his eyes and taking stock of his surroundings.
“Yes and no.  It’s primarily modeled off the arc reactor that powers the Iron Man armor,” Stark answers, his head nodding toward the line of suits in the corner.  “But those things run off of vibranium, and it’s just too rare of a metal for me to go around using it commercially.”
The Avengers was just a group of misfits trying to find their place in the world. Tony understood that more than anyone. He himself felt like an outcast 9 times out of 10. His fame and fortune didn’t mean a damn thing if at the end of the day he still felt like a loser, like nobody.
Tony laughs and moves back to give Dodger a chance to jump off the couch, but he never does and instead he stays nestled up beside Steve.
“Oh. Congratulations. Again, I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help. I have a meeting in five minutes so…”
“You know that’s the second time someone’s told me that,” Tony tells her. “I’m just here for the kid.”
Steve chuckles softly and leans in to close the bit of space between them. Tony kisses back, smiling against Steve’s lips when he feels his husband physically relax. Then the previous tension returns and Steve is pulling away.
He stops running to catch his breath. The cool temperature brings relief to his heated skin and if he’d have it his way he’d spend the rest of the morning outside, but that was just an excuse to avoid his husband a little longer.
“You ready?” Steve asks as he opens the small bag of chocolate chips. Peter nods his head excitedly and tries to take the bag. “Wait a minute. Let me help you.”
Bucky switches and makes a fist with his metal hand, then he digs it into the spot Steve was complaining about the most. Steve lets out another pleasurable moan. It paid to have a friend with a metal arm.
It’s Sam who gives him the strength and encouragement to finally speak. And all he needed to do was place a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
The ride up is excruciatingly painful. No conversation of any kind is created; they remain silent and distanced from each other. Unable to take the awkwardness anymore, Peter clears his throat and glances at the large man.
It’s a little after 7 by the time the front door opens and her papa returns from his run. Morgan is ready to point out his tardiness, but the words get lost in her throat when she notices he’s not alone. Peter was with him.
“I’m fat!” Peter cries and throws his head back. Tears prickle the corners of his eyes and he quickly shuts them to block the tears from escaping. “Nothing fits, Papa! I’ve tried all of my jeans!”
Steve keeps his face buried in Tony’s neck, inhaling the scent of his mate. He smiles at that thought. He finally had a mate. He finally had a good alpha to love him.
“I’m sorry,” Bucky mutters after he’s calmed down. He glances at where his hands are placed on the edge of the sink, cursing when he finds the dent he’s created by accident.
Between the combination of witnessing Tony coming undone and feeling it was all Steve needed to reach his own release. He cums with a grunt, hips stuttering as he unloads himself deep inside Tony.
“I also heard about...my dad.” Peter winces, waiting for the yelling to start. There’s only silence. It’s worse than yelling.
Pepper places a hand on his shoulder and rubs the spot soothingly. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I wish I knew what to say to make it better.”
An incoming call interrupts his meditation and Steve’s eyes snap open, immediately landing on the little screen when his husband’s name appears.
“I won’t hurt him. I already caused enough harm. I’m moving forward and changing for him. He’s all I care about.”
“Tony!” Steve doesn’t mean to cry out the name, but the contraction has worsened, along with the pressure deep in his pelvis. He feels the baby drop and he groans. “Tony, where are you?”
Steve wasn’t sure what to expect when he comes face to face with his abuser. It had been months since they had been in the same room together. Steve had believed they would never see each other again. He’d give anything to go back to that night and go through with his original plan. Alexander Pierce would be dead right now.
“How could we?” Tony reaches out to ruffle his son’s hair. “You’re the reason why we’re back together.”
They are forced to break apart when the elevator comes to a stop and the doors slide open. Tony takes Steve by the hand and leads him out and toward their private quarters.
“You’re not gonna do anything stupid. You have a kid now...by the way you need to catch me up to speed on that.”
“Don’t worry about him, Pete,” Steve assures and he takes his original spot at the table. “He’s just busy.”
Tony stands and makes his way over to the suit, placing his hand over the black spider in the center. It was exactly the way Steve had designed it. Tony added his own special touches, things he figured his son would appreciate, but the credit should go to Steve. It had been his idea in the first place.
A comforting hand lays over his back, rubbing soothing circles as Peter vomits. Finally, Peter is able to pull away and he’s immediately handed some toilet paper to clean his mouth.
Tony’s knot eventually softens and he pulls out. They curl up against each other, scenting the other and sharing loving kisses. It’s not until Peter’s cries from down the hall interrupt and Steve is forced to get out of bed. He quickly slips on his sweats and purposely steals Tony’s t-shirt.
“Not at first,” Peter replies. “I honestly didn’t think he knew how. I mean when I was older I wondered about my dad, but he was enough, you know? I was just lucky to have him.”
He knows he should have let Steve talk instead of running away. Everything would be different now. Steve might still be alive and they’d be raising their son together. Maybe they would have ended up together at the end, get married and have a few more kids. Tony would still consider himself an Avenger and working alongside Steve and their team.
“You,” Steve doesn’t even hesitate to respond. “I want you. You’re my mate, my alpha. But...please go slow.”
The nesting phase was just around the corner. Steve knew what to expect when the urge came, and he was grateful that this time would be different compared to the others. For one he had a safe place to build his nest, and he had a mate to share it with.
Steve lies back and sets Peter down, watching as his son crawls around and over him, little giggles leaving his lips when Steve starts up a game of peekaboo. Peter makes his way to Steve’s face, sitting himself comfortably on his papa’s chest and reaching out with tiny hands to cover Steve’s eyes.
“One day I’ll claim you and you’ll be mine forever,” Alpha murmurs against the bonding gland. He kisses the spot again. “You’ll be my omega,” he continues and trails a hand between their bodies, pressing his palm flat against the spot where the newest pup was growing. “I’ll put another pup here.”
Steve scoffs and glances back down at their son’s peaceful face. “This isn’t comfort. This is torture.”
“Is she awake?” Natasha asks, coming over to join Tony on the sofa. She smiles at her niece when she finds her stirring. “Aww, baby girl what’s wrong?” Natasha coos, stretching out one finger to stroke along Morgan’s face.
“This one is Peter,” Steve replies, gesturing to the sleeping baby in Tony’s arms. “And I’m holding Harley.”
They still need a name for their baby...of course you guys already know what it’s going to be haha. And they need to figure out how to be parents and the feelings they obviously still have for each other. But the team gets to meet the baby soon!
Peter doesn’t even answer right away, using his lunch as a distraction. He picks at the sandwich, not finding the ham and cheese delectable like he used to. The morning sickness was awful, constantly plaguing him no matter what time of day it was. Whoever came up with the name morning sickness was an idiot.
“Let me try.” Bucky stretches out his arms and Steve passes Peter to him. Peter is not having any of it and continues to fuss, tears streaming down his cheeks and face turning red. Steve winces when the sounds Peter makes get louder. “Hey, Shh it’s okay,” Bucky soothes. “You’re okay, right? I don’t know what you’re crying for.”
He’s forced to let the beta do his job, cutting the cord and separating Steve from his daughter. The beta stretches a hand out for the pup, only for Steve to growl and bring her closer and out of reach.
Tony wasn’t that person. Maybe at one point he had been, but the old him was gone. Or maybe there never was an old or new version of himself. Perhaps he’s always been this dark and twisted.
Clint had brought his whole family with him, which gave Steve a glimpse into his near future. He didn’t understand how Clint could have two children and another on the way. Steve was glad he was only having the one, but it was still scary. A baby was life-changing.
There was no denying that Tony’s penthouse was nice. It was extravagant and furnished with the best money can buy, but it didn’t feel like home. Living at the Avengers Compound was huge and made him feel small at times, but it was the people inside it that made it home.
The little pup’s cries begin to diminish until they’re fading into soft whimpers. Steve doesn’t let him go, not even once Peter has fully calmed down. The dream had felt so real. Steve needed to hold his son for reassurance.
The conversation dies there. And just in time too. Peter is running up the stairs, his face bright and evident with excitement. Tony and Bruce rise to their feet when Natasha, Clint and Thor follow behind Peter. Bruce sends Tony a reassuring smile and pats him on the back.
Tony is up bright and early. It’s no surprise considering that he hasn’t gotten much sleep since the whole ordeal with Pierce started. He’s constantly thinking about him and wishing Steve would open up more, fill him in. But Steve is still hesitant.
I know a lot of you guys are disappointed in Tony( me included) but I don’t hate him. I’m not against him. He’s one of my favorite characters. As I writer I wanted to challenge myself and write Stony a little different. They’re not always going to get a happy ending unfortunately.
He can’t tear his gaze away from the little boy in his arms. It still hasn’t him yet that he had just given birth. The experience was something he was never going to forget. And though it had been difficult and the most painful thing he’s ever suffered from, he’d do it all again if he had to.
She hates how harsh she is beginning to sound when it comes to her brother. She loved him, but sometimes she couldn’t help but feel jealous that he was taking up all of their parents time. Harley wasn’t innocent either, but she felt he got a pass because he was young.
“I guess Steve was strict huh?” Tony immediately regrets those words too but it’s too late to take them back.
Two alphas have him pinned, one on each side. Steve pays them no mind, his attention only on his son and the alpha going up the stairs. Steve struggles against his attackers, and he manages to slip one arm free and issue a punch to the man on his left, filling the room with a sickening crack. The man cries out and grips his bruised jaw, giving Steve an opportunity to wrestle with the other alpha.
Tony pulls his fingers free and takes the bottle of lube, adding more to his fingers and smearing it around his cock. Steve spreads his legs a little wider, hands gripping the back of his knees and pulling them up, exposing himself. Tony doesn’t hesitate and leads his cock to Steve’s entrance, pressing the head against the rim and watching as it pops inside.
“Honey, wake up. Steve, it’s me.” Tony continues to shake Steve until his eyes are shooting open, wide and terrified. “Darling, look at me. It’s me. It’s me.”
The doors to the elevator open and Tony leads Steve out and toward their private quarters. As soon as they’re inside, Tony pulls Steve into his arms and crashes their lips together. Steve gasps against Tony’s lips.
“The best. He did everything he could to give me a good life. Sometimes I wish he would’ve done more,” Peter sighs sadly.
There’s Steve with their upset son in his arms, his own face streaked with tears. It’s a difficult scene to take in. Tony has never seen Steve so upset before.
The next time their friends stop by for a visit, the group only consists of Sam, Natasha, and Bucky. It’s Natasha and Bucky who coax Steve out of the bedroom and into the living room. He breaks down immediately, clutching onto Bucky and sobs.
“Never.” Peter pulls back slightly so their eyes can meet. Steve doesn’t miss how shiny they appear. “You’ll come back, right?”
“It’s fine. I promised I’d help, didn’t I? Plus, being in your private jet beats regular airfare. So...the pup is yours. That was what you were hoping for, right?”
“Yeah.” Steve frowns down at the slice of his barely touched pizza, no longer finding the food interesting. He sets it back on the plate and leans back into the couch.
Steve’s heart is thumping so hard against his chest he expects it to burst right through. Peter is luckily fast asleep, the swaying of the car seat lulling him back to sleep. Different scenarios play through Steve’s mind, each one worse than the other. He doesn’t want to jump ahead of himself and fear the worst, but he can’t help but worry. FRIDAY’s alert was worrisome.
Tony gives Thor and Clint one last look before pushing past them and making his way toward the kitchen, thanking his lucky stars for Peter’s rescue.
him still plays through Steve’s mind. He had thought he had escaped the abuse and would never have to endure it again. He had thought he’d be a free omega and get the chance to live his life, to be a mother.
Tony comes back over and Steve scoots over. There was no reason for him to make room when the bed was large enough to hold them comfortably, but Steve can’t help but move so that Tony could be comfortable. Alpha’s always came first.
“Better start planning then. We need better decorations and costumes and-” Tony’s rambling is silenced with a kiss and he smiles against Steve’s lips.
Steve takes a moment to compose himself then he takes a step forward, only to turn around when he hears someone call out for him. Peter is rushing toward him.
He hasn’t shut everyone out. He talks to Pepper and Rhodey from time to time. Even Jarvis is still up and running, though some days Tony wants to pull the plug on him just to avoid another lecture. But he never does. He takes the scolding and promises to do better. It’s what he’s been doing since Peter walked into his life.
He can’t imagine losing anyone else close to him. He had already lost the most important person in his life, and now it seemed like it was going to happen again. His family meant the world to him. They had always been there for him. He couldn’t lose his uncle. The whole team would suffer without him, and Peter would crumble for sure.
“You messed everything up! I told you not to go on that stupid mission! But you didn’t listen to me! You never listen to me. It’s all your fault!”
“Relax,” Tony says and reaches out to pat Steve on the shoulder in an attempt to calm him. The omega relaxes slightly and continues to pick at his food. It doesn’t go unnoticed. “Hey,” Tony tries again and Steve peers up at him. “It’s okay. You don’t have to be scared.”
“I think that’s enough,” Nick interrupts. He too notices how uncomfortable the omega has gotten. He rises to his feet and Maria joins him. “You’re free to go. I’m sure your pups need you.”
It took him a while to realize that he wasn’t at fault for their loss, and during that time he made the decision to stop trying. He didn’t want to lose another and deal with the pain he still struggled with. It was a pain he couldn’t describe even if he wanted to. He wished it on no one. Not even his greatest enemies.
Bruce sets the remote down on the desk, his eyes landing on the woman sitting behind it. Pepper remains still, her own eyes glued to the screen, almost as if she’s waiting for it to turn back on and show her good news, not the same story that's been on a loop since it was discovered her ex boss was dead.
Steve whimpers, announcing the start of another contraction. His body tenses and his usually sweet scent turns sour. Tony senses his omega’s discomfort and he pulls Steve even closer, offering his neck for Steve to smell.
“Tony,” he quickly rises to his feet and steps forward, only to pause when Tony holds a hand out to stop him.
Peter falls asleep soon after, the movie forgotten. Bucky scoops him up and carries him to his bed, not wanting to leave his nephew to sleep alone tonight. Peter curls up with his favorite bear and Bucky kisses him goodnight.
“Never,” Steve says and hugs her a little bit tighter until she’s demanding he stop. “Sorry,” he apologizes with a sheepish grin. “Go put your suitcase away. I think you’re needed down in the lab.”
Tears prickle at the corners of his eyes. He was tired of hurting and feeling the anguish. Of feeling the guilt. But it would never truly go away. It would always be there, always haunting him. It was his curse.
“Trust me we’ll live. The choice is yours remember? And if you want to jump back and forth then that’s okay too.”
Tony is lying back against the pillows, his legs spread wide and fingers twisting the sheets beneath him. He’s breathing hard and his eyes are squeezed shut.
Anyway…I have a confession. I was thinking of doing an alternate ending 🤔 I have something planned so this story won’t be marked as complete just yet 😉
“Usually no. They don’t have a pattern like true labor, but if that changes or there’s any spotting don’t hesitate to take him in.”
Not much is said between them after that. They both dress in silence, then Tony walks Steve out. There’s some awkwardness, and Steve can’t help but feel like this was how a breakup was supposed to go.
Peter quiets down instantly and slumps in his seat, his cheeks red with embarrassment. “Sometimes. Papa would always laugh at me.”
“Forget it,” Tony rubs at his head, hoping to rid himself from the ache their conversation has brought on. “We can talk more later. I’m sure you want to rest, maybe take a shower. Happy should be back soon with some clothes.”
Tony sits down, making sure there’s enough space between them. He doesn’t want to corner the omega and scare him off.
“Fine.” Steve steals a glance at his shoulder, wincing when he brushes it with his fingers. The blood is flowing, but it’s not enough to send him into a panic. “I’ll live. Where are you now? I’m coming-”
Maybe Tony would get lucky and the pregnancy would fail. It was a miracle they were pregnant in the first place. Tony thought for sure that the serum would intervene and make conceiving difficult for them. But it turns out Steve was the lucky one. He was getting what he wanted.
It’s not until Sam and Peter make their way home does Sam decide to ask his nephew about the decision to give up the shield.
Tony doesn’t reply and with his drink in hand, makes his way to the sofa and lowers himself down a few seats away. He takes a drink, enjoying the familiar burn as it travels down his throat.
Tony shrugs nonchalantly and leans back in his seat. He sighs and rubs at his forehead. “Honestly, I don’t even know if it’s mine.”
Steve loved everything about his boyfriend. Tony was snarky, didn’t believe in sleep and consumed more coffee than any human being should, but Steve loved him regardless. They didn’t always see eye to eye on things, but it didn’t matter when the love they had for each other was strong. Steve didn’t know how he had gotten so lucky.
A small groan escapes him when his belly tightens again. The pain is getting worse. The omega gasps, eyes shooting open in surprise when his pants grow wet. His pup would be here soon.
Flash shakes his head and quickly looks behind him to make sure they’re still alone before turning back to Peter. “You’re lying, right? You’re not really? I mean, how would that even happen? I swear I used-”
“You can.” Bruce smiles and wraps the pup in a towel, then he places the newborn on his mother’s chest. “He’s your pup.”
The alpha laps hungrily at the slick. With his tongue he follows the trail that coats the inside of Steve’s thigh, and then back up again to the source of the sweetness. He works a finger in along with his tongue, thrusting in roughly, searching for that spot that will bring Steve over the edge.
“Okay,” Peter agrees and he rises to his feet. He grabs his backpack and adjusts the strap to sit comfortably over his shoulder. “I have school so…”
Morgan waits for the yelling and scolding to start when her parents rush into the room, but what greets her instead is a big hug from her papa.
James still doesn’t appear convinced. He doesn’t move away when Steve comes closer and this time allows Steve to reach out and touch him.
“You’re wondering why we’re not together even though we have a kid. Am I right? I’m right, I know I am. I don’t know. It’s complicated.”
“I think I’m having second thoughts,” Tony admits as he finishes packing his bags. He probably shouldn’t have waited for the day of the trip to actually pack, but lately his mind had been elsewhere. Luckily he had Steve to help him and remind him to pack essential items. “Is this a bad idea?”
There’s still no response from Steve; it’s concerning. Tony tries not to think too much about it. He knew Steve was probably preparing dinner or caring for their daughter.
At just five years old he was climbing the walls and sticking to surfaces. It had scared the hell out of Steve when he couldn’t find his son during a game of hide and seek, only to discover that Peter had decided the kitchen ceiling was the best hiding spot.
“What I had to do. If we had that baby...can you imagine the hell that poor kid would’ve gone through? To have me as a father? I had to save them.”
“Fuck,” he says in a breathy tone. Steve takes him in his hand, stroking the heated flesh and smearing the precum at the tip. Tony moans and kisses Steve again, this time with more urgency. “Steve, honey, you’re gonna make me-oh fuck-”
His dad’s absence doesn’t go unnoticed. Peter wishes that he’d see his dad’s face among the crowd of people. He’s left to imagine his dad sitting with his family and reminiscing about old times. Peter wants more than just to imagine his dad. He wants the real thing.
Natasha lets out a heavy sigh and sets her glass down on the coffee table. Tony waits for her to yell at him or maybe even through the glass at his face. He deserved whatever she had planned for him. He hurt her and the rest of his friends. He hurt his son. He hurt Steve.
He makes a special trip to Brooklyn, lying to Pepper and claiming it was for a visit to a possible location to expand his company.
Morgan keeps nursing from the bottle, completely unaware of the words being spoken to her. She’s calm, though, something Tony is thankful for. He doesn’t want to interrupt Steve again.
Tony had wanted to keep their date simple. He chose one of their favorite restaurants and reserved a table on the rooftop. Everyone knew who he was, so it was easy to get the upper half of the restaurant to themselves.
“Me either. It hurts, da-Mr. Stark. It hurts so bad. I just want someone to...to erase it all you know? I don’t want to feel like this anymore.”
Steve’s jolted awake, gasping at the realization of dozing off with his son still in his arms. Once glance down shows Peter still curled up in his arms and fast asleep, his tiny mouth barely hanging onto Steve’s nipple.
Well, this story is finally over. I had a lot of fun writing it, even though it was hard not having Steve 😭
“We don’t have to do this now,” Sam says, his voice shaky from the tears he’s trying to hold back. “This can wait. If you want you can grab some of your things and then we can go okay?”
“Your daddy has a shield, remember?” Peter says, getting a nod in response. He adjusts his cousin on his hip, grunting softly. “Dude, you’re getting heavy.”
Peter clenches his fist until he’s sure he’s drawn blood from hard he’s digging his nails into the flesh. He glares up at the stone face of his father.
The tears don’t stop streaming down his face. His nose is stuffed and his eyes are beginning to swell from the tears he can’t conceal. He can’t remember a time when he’s cried this hard before. Usually he kept his emotions to himself. And technically he was still doing that now.
Steve waits until she’s gone before finally letting his guard down. The tears that roll down his face are a mixture of happy and scared. He’s happy to have his best friend back and on his side again, and though that news should be exciting, Steve can’t fully devote himself to that emotion. He might have his best friend back, but he was still having a baby. Alone.
“So needy, huh, baby?” Tony croons and Steve whimpers in response. “I got you, sweetheart. I’ll make it up to you.”
Pepper inhales sharply. “I miss not having such a large workload. Did you even respond to those emails I sent you?”
Steve’s stomach churns at that thought. Any parent was going to consider their child perfect, but Steve didn’t want to. He didn’t want to believe that there was a chance of an alpha being perfect, especially if that alpha turned out to be his own pup. Hydra would win.
Steve glances up at Tony and leans closer to place a kiss to his cheek. “Thank you,” he says softly.
She loved her older brother. Peter was only a few years older than her, but they still clashed from time to time. It was normal sibling stuff.
“On the bed,” the alpha orders and Steve complies. He lies back on the bed, eyes trained on the ceiling above him. The bed dips when Alpha joins him. Steve’s trapped between the bed and the man above him.
Bruce arrives and they gather downstairs in Tony’s lab. A portion of it has been blocked off for the exam. Eventually Tony was going to need a different space for Bruce’s monthly visits. He could easily renovate an upstairs room. He had the time and funds to do it.
Tony is obviously not worried about any of that because the sounds he makes rise in volume and he doesn’t stop begging Steve to fuck him. Steve increases the pace, searching for that spot that he knows will make Tony scream.
His face heats up being this exposed to her, but she doesn’t even bat an eye. She was just another omega helping another. A friend helping a friend.
Unable to form any words, Steve is only able to nod his head. The alpha growls when his knot gets too big and he shoves it inside. Steve moans loudly against Tony’s neck when he’s stretched from the large knot. Tony’s hips stutter for a moment until his body grows taut and his cock spills deep inside his mate. Steve follows soon after, his own cock spurting against his belly.
Just thinking about the kid he needed to raise brings more fear and anxiousness. There’s guilt there too, and that would probably always remain with him. Peter was 15 now and Tony missed a huge chunk of his life. But it wasn’t too late. He could still salvage what he did have and be a father.
They do exactly that. Peter abandons his room, deciding to help out in the living room and sort through the items left behind. It’s difficult at first, but no one said it was going to be easy. He’s just grateful he’s not alone to do this hard task.
It still hasn’t sunk in that he was a father. He didn’t know what the hell he was supposed to do. Raising a kid-no scratch that. He didn’t raise Peter. Steve did it all. And it only makes Tony feel worse about himself.
“Thanks,” Peter mumbles and searches for his math book. He finds what he’s looking for and shuts the door, his eyes locking with Ned’s. “I’m fine,” Peter is quick to assure. “Just...tired.”
Steve stops to think it over. New York was home and he never imagined leaving Brooklyn during his time there. But the plans to stay in his childhood home were destroyed when Hydra took control of his life. He was at least grateful that Alpha kept him in New York.
He slips out, watching as his release spills and creates a mess on the sheets. Steve is still panting, his eyes closed and a look of pure satisfaction written on his face.
“I got it,” Tony says before Steve can attend to their oldest son. He goes inside and takes James by the hand, leading him back upstairs.
“Sorry. I’m just confused here,” Happy rubs at his forehead. “How did this even happen? Even when you do sleep around you’re always careful. Do you even know who this guy is?”
Steve rolls his eyes and quickly ushers his son’s to finish eating. Once their plates are empty, both boys are rushing upstairs to brush their teeth. Steve knows he’ll have to help them otherwise toothpaste will end up on the sink and not their mouths.
“I know.” Tony nods and takes his original spot beside his husband. He takes Steve’s hand and with his own, brushes away the tears that don’t stop falling. “But you’re so strong and I, and everyone else, knows that you can get through this. It’s not going to be easy and honestly, this sucks. I hate you being here while Morgan and are forced to pretend that everything’s okay. But you can’t give up. You promised that, remember?”
Tony blows out a breath and forces himself to ignore the nervous behavior. It was too late to call for anyone else. Peter would have to do it.
“Happy’s gonna pick you up a few things. I know you must be uncomfortable,” Tony says, eyes trailing over the worn out clothes Steve was currently in. It’s not just his attire that Tony is bothered by. He didn’t like the bruises decorating Steve’s face.
Peter’s face heats up at those words. Ned was always going to be the person Peter was most excited to see, but lately he had been wanting to be near Flash more than usual.
He slowly removes the envelope, but his curiosity wins over and he opens it up to reveal the images inside. He glances up quickly when Steve shifts, then once Steve is still again Tony takes the pictures out to look at them.
“Night, Pete,” Tony says and leans down to kiss his son’s head. Peter smiles and cuddles with his favorite bear.
“No. Steve, you didn’t know about him. I’d be the biggest asshole in the world if I pointed the finger at you.”
Peter’s decided he’s had enough of the scary hologram and goes back into the living room to check out the rest of the decorations. He’s not afraid of the hanging skeletons or the life size one sitting casually on the couch; he thinks it’s funny. The spiders and webs are his favorite part. It makes sense. He is their little spiderling.
There’s still a part of Steve that’s unsure about Tony’s absence, but then he reminds himself of the security guard keeping watch until Tony’s return. A few days would pass with ease. Steve had enough to occupy his time and mind until his alpha returned.
Taking control of a super soldier is a lot easier than Tony thought it was going to be. He has Steve laying flat on his back with his blue button up shirt already open and revealing the white undershirt he wore underneath. Thor’s mead was legit.
“Yeah,” Tony nods and types away with one hand on the keyboard while the other keeps his son secure in his lap. “What color, Har?”
It’s bittersweet. He’s gathered with his friends to celebrate the birth of his son, but without Tony by his side, Steve’s mood dampens. Tony should be here for it all. He had missed the first appointment, the gender reveal, and now the baby shower. Though time was running out until Steve welcomed his son, he held onto hope that Tony would come back and they’d be together when their baby entered the world.
“We can talk for hours about...everything! There’s so much I want to know. How did you guys meet? How did you become an Avenger? Are you still Iron Man? Do you really like cheeseburgers?”
“Steve’s gone okay?” Sam says. “But we’re still here. We’re all that kid has left and if we’re going to act like this, then you know damn well he’ll go somewhere else. And I don’t know about all of you but I’m not losing that kid. I lost Steve, I lost my own child-”
Tony nods. They fall into an uncomfortable silence. Leaving would save them both from the awkwardness, but Tony can’t bring himself to leave.
He’s snapped from his thoughts when he hears Steve enter the apartment. Tony quickly diverts his gaze from the nearly empty bottle of pills and continues to pour himself a cup of coffee.
“I promise I’ll be a good father. I’ll do anything to keep you and mommy safe. You both mean the world to me. No one and I mean no one will ever hurt you.”
“Papa!” Peter cries and jumps out of Tony’s lap to get to Steve. He giggles when he’s lifted up and wrapped in a big hug. “Papa, you get lots and lots of kisses too!”
Peter was his. He’d never do anything to bring his son harm, and anyone who tried would have to go through him first. The promises Steve had made to his other pups had never been fulfilled. He won’t make that mistake again. He’d keep Peter safe.
“Oh.” Natasha’s brows furrow slightly and she glances at the targets she had been shooting. “I guess I lost track of time. How was school?” She’s back to staring at him and Peter can’t help but shift under her gaze.
Happy still doesn’t appear convinced, but he drops it. “Okay. Let me know if it gets worse. I said I’d protect Tony, but that includes you and your son too.”
And Tony gave all of that up. He had walked away from the people that he considered family and home. The guilt would never truly leave him, and he’s accepted that. It would be a curse to forever haunt him in this lifetime. He can only hope there’s peace after this. Steve believed there was.
Back and forth, that’s all they’ve been doing and have yet to meet in the middle. It’s no surprise, really. Finding common ground has always been a struggle for them.
“Oh...okay...um there are tissues.” Natasha leans over to grab a tissue from the box sitting on the coffee table. She hands one to him and Steve wipes at his nose and eyes. “Better?”
Steve glances up at Tony, a mischievous glint in his eye. He tugs Tony’s jeans and underwear down his legs, exposing his hard, leaking cock. Steve leans in and licks along the head, then runs his tongue along the length.
Peter sends Ned a reassuring look. Ned gets the hint and sighs before heading in the opposite direction, making sure to give them one last look before rounding the corner.
She’s sobbing now, the sound painful to Peter’s ears. He leans against the doorframe, his own tears running down his face. The guilt that washes over him is difficult to ignore. They were grieving too and Peter somehow managed to make it about himself. That wasn’t his intention, but from where he’s standing, he can’t help but feel that way. He lost his father, but they lost their best friend. It wasn’t just about him. It was about all of them.
Tony learns that Steve not only stayed with Bucky, but disappeared one night with him. Only a note addressed to Tony was left behind.
He grows bored of this and throws the blankets off. He smoothes out the wrinkles in his clothes, frowning to himself when he realizes he’d be going to school and back home in the same outfit he had worn yesterday. Maybe no one would notice or care. The sleepover was last minute after all.
Pepper peers up at him. Steve wonders if Tony’s told her about him and the superhuman strength he had. He wonders if she knew everything about him and his past. If she does, she doesn’t show it and she sends him another warm smile.
Steve nods and takes another drink from his glass. “And you? What was Tony Stark like as a kid? You weren’t a snotty brat, were you?”
Tony complies and begins thrusting roughly, punching out pleasured gasps from Steve’s lips. Steve brings Tony closer, wrapping his legs around his waist and burying his nose in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the musky scent.
“Fuck.” Tony curses and scrubs a hand over his face. He reads over the line ‘maybe one day we can be a family’ and that’s when he starts kicking himself. He feels like the world’s biggest idiot. For years Steve had been trying to tell him something important, and Tony had ignored it all. The last night they saw each other replays in his head and Tony curses himself again for being so stupid. It had never been Barnes.
Tony smiles and rises to his feet, opening his arms for Steve to pass him their son. Peter jerks once he’s moved, both parents holding their breath as they prepare for more crying. But Peter remains asleep, yawning once and curling up against Tony’s chest, enjoying the warmth he provides.
“I know.” Tony nods and takes a sip from his mug, sighing softly when his body gets a dose of caffeine. “We’ll eventually get her on a schedule,” he says.
The silence that follows is awkward. Tony clears his throat and moves toward the bar, itching for a drink in hopes of easing his discomfort.
Bucky’s eyes fill with tears and he turns away to hide them. “Shit,” he mutters and wipes quickly at his eyes. “Damn hormones.”
“Sarah,” Steve whispers. She’s too little to understand, but the sound of his voice has her lifting her head and settling her blue eyes on his face. He smiles and moves toward the bed. This time James doesn’t protest.
As cheesy as it sounds, Steve’s eyes appear brighter in the candle light. Tony rememberers thinking the same thing back when he first brought Steve to this establishment.
“I want to train him,” Steve repeats, making sure his tone is cool and collected. Nick leans forward in his seat, letting out a heavy sigh. “Sir, I know he’s still young but he has potential.”
Now he’s regretting coming so early. He feels awkward lingering around the hallway as he waits for the room currently filled with other omegas to clear out. Apparently Sam taught multiple sessions, and Steve had just caught the end of one.
Steve scoffs and shakes his head. One hand falls to his belly, and a frown appears over his face. “Not really.”
One hand finds its way to his belly, cupping the small bump that’s beginning to grow. There’s a sense of joy coursing through him at the thought of his baby. But there’s also fear. He didn’t know what the future held and if he was really safe from Hydra. He was their property; he belonged to them and only them.
Steve’s eyes land on the teenagers’ connected hands, a small smile forming over his face. “Dinner will be ready soon. You’re welcome to stay, Flash.”
When they return back to the tower and inside the elevator, Tony pulls Steve close and crashes their lips together. Steve gasps in surprise but welcomes the kiss, moving his lips with Tony’s and wrapping his arms around his neck.
He had decided a long time ago that he was never going to find a bond mate and have a family. He didn’t have the best childhood growing up, and he couldn’t imagine himself as a father. His own made sure to put him down and make him feel like a mistake every chance he got. The only good thing about him was his alpha status.
“If it was too much I wouldn’t have put that ring on your finger. I told you I love those kids and nothing is ever going to change that. I am a little tired, sure but…it’s worth it.”
“Hey, come here.” Tony opens his arms, smiling softly when Peter accepts the embrace and allows Tony to pick him up. Tony takes him back into the room and gently lowers himself down on the bed. Peter keeps his arms wrapped around Tony’s neck and rests his head on his shoulder.
Tony’s hand comes up to rest on Steve’s. “Sweetheart, I’m much worse. What kind of father murders their own children?”
“I really am sorry. I didn’t know they would do that. I mean…I kinda did but hoped they wouldn’t. My dad isn’t that scary.”
But he doesn’t get home until close to dinner. She hears him come in and is ready to rush down the stairs to greet him, but then she hears the argument between her parents and decides now wasn’t the time.
Tony nods and leans down to kiss Peter on the head, then he turns and leaves. Steve finishes up with Peter, burps him and makes sure he is comfortable before putting him down for the night. He takes a moment to prepare himself before entering Tony’s room.
Finally got around to this one. I promised to work on all my WIPS and it's harder than I thought it was going to be. Anyway, here is the next chapter! Thank you so much for being so patient with me!
He’s starting to come to, the realization of what he's just done dawning on him. Tony’s eyes shoot open and he jumps away.
“I know, but it could just be something small. I’m trying to not be afraid anymore and I think it’s working and I don’t know maybe a party would...sorry I’m rambling.”
The current fight with his mate puts Steve in a sour mood all day. He tries to force a smile and make himself appear happy, but he knows his scent is giving him away. He’s caught members of his group wrinkling their nose when they get a whiff of him, or sending him sympathetic looks.
Steve huffs and runs a hand over the black material, guessing it cost way too damn much. The tie Tony had placed with it catches Steve’s eye and he takes it into his hand, enjoying the silky texture. It’s red; Tony’s favorite color.
“Uh good. Auntie Nat said I’ll train with her later,” Peter replies. His eyes travel to the other person in the room, growing more and more uncomfortable under the steel blue gaze. “Am I...in trouble?”
But he wasn’t going to hide anymore. He did it for 15 years and enough was enough. He needed to pull himself together and get his life back on track. If not for himself then for his son.
They exchange numbers and then they’re both walking outside the private exit. This time Tony gives his son a hug. It’s awkward and not at all how he envisioned, but he felt it was something that he needed to do. It was long overdue.
“I’ll tell you once we get on the jet,” Tony says and he moves across the room to get to the closet. He can hear Steve get out of bed and follow him. Tony ignores him and grabs one of his carry on bags and begins stuffing it with clothes.
Steve holds Tony by his hips and he slips one hand free to trail it up and down Tony’s back. “Just breathe, Tones. In and out, remember?”
This chapter is sad. Poor Steve 😔 I’m starting to get more into his history and what Hydra did to him. He has a long road to recovery.
When his latest session is over and the room has cleared out, Steve works quickly to organize the space and get back home. He hasn’t heard a single thing from his mate, something that never happens. Tony was usually sending Steve updates or cute photos of the kids. Not hearing from Tony only makes Steve feel worse.
“I know, but honestly I hate seeing you like this. If you want a baby then we’re gonna have one. And if this doesn’t work then we can always adopt. Or I make us a cute little robot baby.”
Tony takes a shaky breath and gulps down more of his coffee, ignoring the burning down his throat. He wants a different kind of burn.
“You will.” Tony smiles and leans over their daughter’s sleeping form to peck Steve on the lips. “Get some sleep, honey. Pete will probably be up soon.”
Much to Peter’s relief, his parents aren’t home when he arrives at the tower. He can’t help but feel that this would have been the perfect opportunity for him and Flash to properly talk without being interrupted or pummeled by concerned parents. But Flash had decided that he didn’t want to talk. Maybe eventually they could sit down and be mature about their current predicament, but as for right now, Peter was left alone to figure out how to handle the situation.
Tony watches them for a moment. He doesn’t miss the way Steve’s body relaxes and that infectious smile of his appears. Steve seemed at ease around Sam, something Tony wishes the soldier would show around him. Steve had only worked with Sam once, and yet they appeared as if they had been friends for years.
And Ned was there for him. He was one of the first smiling faces Peter sees when he gets to school. Peter doesn’t even force a smile; the one that appears is genuine.
He moves quietly until he’s standing near them and he reaches down to adjust the blanket that has slipped off around them. His eyes immediately travel to his husband’s protruding middle and his smile grows brighter.
“I’m just wondering. I hadn’t heard from you and I thought maybe I screwed up somehow and drove you away. I tend to do that.”
Tony scoots closer to his son and lays on a hand over his shoulder. “I’m sorry, kid. I know...I know how you feel. I lost my parents too.”
“What’s going on?” Natasha asks and hands her niece a steaming cup of hot cocoa. It was perfect for this chilly day, and it never failed to lift Morgan’s spirits.
“Come on, Steve who are we kidding? There’s a reason you’re the one carrying the baby. I’m too old for this and maybe-”
“Tony?” Steve’s questioning tone is what snaps Tony from his thoughts, and he directs his gaze on Steve. “Talk to me. What’s wrong?”
“I do look pretty good, huh? And look at you! I swear you’re just like a mini me. Do you think you can step in for me Monday morning? They won’t be able to tell the difference.”
The agent nods and sends Steve another smile before leaving the room and closing the door behind him.
Tony takes the picture and studies it. He wouldn’t be surprised if his son hated him, but judging by their interaction today, his son seemed like he wanted to get to know him. Maybe Tony had a chance to fix what he broke.
“I don’t know!” Steve continues to sob. “We were fine and now...now he’s like this and I don’t know what to do. Tony, help me!”
He decides to give her a little backstory, making sure to only mention the pup he lost and not the ones he birthed and had ripped away.
Tony frowns and takes his hand off Steve’s shoulder. “Let me know if you do. I can follow directions.”
Steve whimpers when a kiss is placed to his forehead. The alpha eventually pulls out and tucks himself back into his slacks. Steve grimaces at the feel of their mixed fluids between his legs, and one glance down shows his thighs stained with the mixture and a bit of blood.
Morgan curls up closer to him, wanting to bask in his warmth a little longer. Tony smiles and wraps an arm around her.
“I know. Believe me I know.” Tony gestures to the bruise on his cheek. “I’m sorry tonight didn’t go as planned.”
Steve lets Natasha take full control of the shower. It was her idea. She knew he was stressed and not himself these days, and decided a baby shower would do him some good. Turns out she was right, and a baby shower was just the type of distraction Steve needed.
The team was well aware of the fact that their leaders were trying to start a family. They had offered their support from the beginning, especially when news broke out that Steve was unable to conceive. He can recall long nights talking with Natasha about the issue; it was something they unfortunately could relate to. Maybe they had shared more life experience than he used to think.
The woman says something Tony doesn’t quite catch, then she repeats herself and he realizes she’s speaking Russian.
Just the mention of his name has Tony struggling for air, and he loosens the tie around his neck, ruining Pepper’s effort to make him look nice.
The kiss doesn’t stay soft and gentle for long. Steve rolls onto his back and Tony follows, positioning himself between the omega’s spread legs.
Now it’s Steve’s turn to frown. Tony can’t help but grin. Of course he loved Steve. Even if he was an idiot.
“I love you,” Tony whispers. His eyes are full of tears again and now that he’s alone, he lets them fall freely and roll down his face. He reminds himself that Steve was alive, but seeing him lying motionless in a hospital bed is still difficult to witness. This never should’ve happened. “I’m so sorry. Steve, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
Steve chuckles and brings the spoon to his mouth, humming in delight when the sweetness touches his tongue. “Pete’s gonna be up all night. The kid loves sugar.”
Up close he can properly scent her. He gets a whiff of vanilla and lavender. She was an omega, but her scent was off. It wasn’t very sweet.
“I guess this is it,” Steve says. He reaches up with one hand to wipe away the tear that rolls down his face. “I’m going to miss you.”
“Come on.” Tony doesn’t even wait for Happy to get the door for him. He unbuckles himself and climbs out of the car. Happy immediately follows. “Don’t say it,” Tony tells him when he rounds the car to get to Steve.
Bruce, like always, is gentle. From day one he had always been a better doctor than the ones Steve had dealt with. But he still can’t help the uneasy feeling that flows through him. He had been assured that this pup was fine, but in the back of his mind, he fears the worst.
Tony doesn’t tear his eyes away from Flash. “Door stays open. And if I hear anything inappropriate-”
Bruce is the one who leads Tony over to the sofas and does his best to make sure he’s comfortable. Tony can’t help but feel like their roles should be switched. He was the one who abandoned everyone. The least he could do now that he’s returned was make sure they were okay. Financially he supported them, but he wonders if they even knew that.
“That’s beside the point. I’m gonna tell him, and I’m gonna apologize profusely for even doing it. I just had to make sure the baby was mine. I was ready to kick him out…”
He knew it was a mistake letting Steve go on a mission. He didn’t care if it was important or if the team needed him; it was all excuses for Steve to go. The team would have been just fine without him and no mission was more important than Steve.
“She’s going to miss you like crazy,” Tony says, coming over to take the spot beside Steve. He tests out the comfort of the bed, frowning when it doesn’t even compete with the bed back home. The bed he now has to fall asleep in alone every night.
“Steve, it’s okay. I am their dad.” Tony beams and slowly makes his way over to properly greet his kids. “Hey, kiddos.”
Steve whimpers and throws his head back. He focuses on his breathing. In and out. In and out. In and-
“Yeah. I thought we could break up and everything would be okay. But I was wrong. I missed you during our time apart. I still do, Tony. I’m sorry. I’m trying to move on.”
“Hold on, Stevie. Look,” Peter points forward and the toddler turns his head, wiggling again to get down and run toward the monument. Peter sets him down and takes his hand, then together they make their way toward the grave.
There's still more to learn about Steve and Tony will remember some stuff. These two have a long road ahead of them.
If he could have it his way, he wouldn’t participate in anymore missions. His son was his main priority now. The missions, being Iron man. None of it mattered anymore. Peter came first.
The voice of reason decides to speak up now. Tony ignores it. He can’t tell Steve about the horrible things he’s done. Steve would never forgive him. Steve would probably leave and never come back.
“-but you’re changing and working at becoming a better person. Peter recognizes your efforts and the rest of the team will too.”
A small smile appears over Steve’s face. Tony’s encouragement never failed to brighten his mood in the past, and now was no different. He felt better about himself, more confident whenever Tony gave him encouraging words. And now he needed those words more than ever.
Sarah nods and turns to enter the living room to watch tv with her brothers. She sits next to James and lays her head on his shoulder. Steve can’t help but smile at the scene. Sarah always found comfort in her older brother. It had been James caring for her during their captivity with Hydra.
Perhaps to Tony this was how breakups were supposed to go. Given his reputation for having a lot of relationships, this must be how he always ends them. But to Steve… sleeping together didn’t seem right.
Tony smiles and rubs his thumb over Steve’s knuckles. “Yeah. I think so. We always could in the past. Are you suggesting we…”
It’s strange being down in his lab without having Dodger sharing the space with him. Lately, he had been extremely clingy with Steve and no matter how many times Tony tried pulling the dog away to give Steve some space, Dodger refused to leave Steve’s side.
Steve winces again from the pain in his middle and the pressure deep in his pelvis. Something was wrong. He wishes now that he had taken his health more seriously, that he had taken everyone’s advice and received medical care. He should have let Jarvis scan him. He shouldn’t have ignored what his body was trying to tell him.
And even though his friends want to make this day special and celebrate it the way they know he would want them to, they can’t help but feel that it’s too soon to have a party. It wouldn’t be the same without Steve’s smiling face.
It was Tony’s fears of screwing up something good that made him talk Steve into being the one to get pregnant. The last thing Tony wanted was for his body to reject their baby. He couldn’t imagine if that had happened. But luck was on their side and Tony was getting closer to his due date.
With his mind elsewhere and not on the project he was hoping he’d have completed by now, Tony takes a break and abandons his work. He doesn’t go to the bar, knowing damn well that there isn’t anything stocked to help him. He’s been drinking more coffee to fill the void. It doesn’t give him the same effect, but it was better than nothing.
But there was hope of a future. There was a promise of a life without abuse and hurt. He would finally be free from Hydra’s cold hands. There would be no more days locked away while he wondered what was going to be done to him. That cruel alpha was gone now and in his place arose one that made Steve feel safe, cared for. Maybe even loved.
“Hi.” Tony returns the greeting, shifting awkwardly in the entryway of the kitchen. His eyes flicker in the direction of the counter where Steve’s leaning, taking notice of the two mugs set out. The familiar aroma of roasted Colombian beans fills the air. “You made coffee?”
Steve pulls back just enough so that their eyes can meet. He cups Tony’s face and brings him closer, connecting their lips. Tony responds instantly, moving his lips along with Steve’s, swiping his tongue along Steve’s bottom lip and begging for access.
His belly tightens, forcing a groan past Steve’s lips. He breathes through the contraction, bearing down when he needs to. It only takes a few pushes to pass the after birth. He ignores the mess between his legs, too engrossed in his daughter’s presence to pay it any mind.
The elevator reaches its destination and the doors open, revealing an empty hallway. Steve breathes a sigh of relief and keeps moving, sniffing Pierce out.
And one bite to Steve’s neck...Tony shudders at the thought of claiming the omega as his own. They would be properly bonded.
“No,” Tony shakes his head. “I needed to go. I couldn’t imagine sending you into that mess and you coming back like this or worse. Not when Pete needs you the most.”
“Yeah,” Peter murmurs and tries to adjust his hoodie when it bunches in the front and creates a small curve. Pretty soon his own belly would be doing that.
“What did you expect? I can afford the best and I hate to say it but this place is it. I’d do anything for you....even this I guess.”
Their baby was growing. It wasn’t just the pictures littering the refrigerator that was proof of that, Tony’s belly had grown since the first few appointments. The bump that had formed was small and barely noticeable under Tony’s clothes, but they knew it was there. Steve couldn’t get enough of it. His hands were attracted to the bump, his fingers itching to get a feel of it whenever Tony let him.
Tony whines low in his throat, the sound foreign to his own ears. The strong, warning growls he normally made couldn’t be repeated. He was broken.
Natasha smiles for a moment before it’s faltering and her face changes again to a more serious expression. “Steve, just know we’re all here for you.”
The contractions start one early morning after breakfast. Tony had made sure the pills were crushed and sprinkled into Steve’s oatmeal. He wonders if the contractions are because of his most recent poisoning, or if Steve’s body has finally had enough. Whatever the reason, Tony can breathe out a sigh of relief.
There was no way in hell he’d be getting any sleep. It would be pointless to even try, so he returns back to his lab to finish his latest project.
“Uncle Steve!” The toddler points excitedly at the statue towering over him. Peter smiles and scoops his cousin up, bringing him closer so that he can reach out and touch the shield. “Oooh. Shield!”
Tony sighs and glances down at their hands. He smooths his thumb over Steve’s fingers, making sure to go over Steve’s ring finger a few times when a thought crosses his mind. He shouldn’t be thinking about marriage when they just agreed to taking their relationship slow, but he can’t help but picture a ring on Steve’s finger. Maybe they’d move away, settle down somewhere quiet and enjoy their new domestic life.
Steve sneaks out of the apartment before Tony even wakes. The sun is hidden behind the clouds, making everything around him gloomy and gray. It was fitting.
Steve tries to call out to him, only for another contraction to take away his ability to speak. The pain is at its worst and he can’t hold off any longer. He quickly slides his sweatpants down to his ankles and spreads his legs, curling forward and pushing as hard as he can. The burning is unlike anything he’s ever experienced. He could usually tolerate a great deal of pain, but this was unbearable.
Natasha nods and takes the car seat. She takes a seat in one of the empty chairs outside of the room and sets the car seat down near her feet. Steve stays near the door, contemplating if he should barge in or wait.
Anyway, he loved Halloween. The dressing up, the parties, the delicious goodies. All of it was what made the holiday so exciting.
Luck had been on their side; they’re pregnant again and so far this pregnancy had been going smoothly. The nausea reared its ugly head and the fatigue didn’t hesitate to make itself known, but that was the norm and didn’t raise any questions.
“Oh.” Tony frowns. This was the first time he’s hearing this. “I didn’t know you were still going to go back out there.”
Sam sighs as he thinks it’s over. “I think we will. Just because he wants to live with Tony right now doesn’t mean he’s gone from our lives forever. And we were here first.”
Upon arriving home, he’s greeted with a quiet apartment. Evidence of dinner remains on the stove, filling the apartment with delectable aroma. It goes ignored.
“I hate them.” James whimpers and tries to pull the blanket over his head, but Tony stops him and lowers it down.
“You never gave me that distraction I wanted,” Bucky murmurs against Sam’s lips. He slides his tongue along Sam’s bottom lip, begging for access.
Why did Peter get to go and not her? Why was he so special? Because he had powers? Because he could save the world? Morgan always thought the powers didn’t make the person. At least that’s what she had been told.
He was terrified of what their reactions were going to be. They would be upset and disappointed and probably angry as hell. He was too young to have a baby. Of course they had been young and unprepared too when they had him, but Peter felt it would be different this time. They didn’t want this for him.
“Psst.” Peter lifts his head at the sound, finding his Uncle Bucky smiling at him. His uncle gestures toward the book and a crayon. Peter nods and rips out a page from his book, eyes going wide when the Director glances in his direction. He waits until it’s safe again before passing the paper and a blue crayon to his uncle.
“You’re not wrong about that.” Bucky leans back and reaches for the remote to channel surf for a while. He’s bored in just a matter of minutes. “You hungry?”
Pepper rolls her eyes again. “I had to learn from JARVIS that you wanted me to cancel the meeting with the interns and the conference call, which by the way, really upset the board members. And then you ignored me.”
Steve follows Dr. Strange’s advice and joins a group therapy. Apparently there were a few to choose from, but the one his doctor recommended leaned more toward omegas  and any trauma they’ve sustained under the hands of aggressive alphas or even abuse from betas and other omegas.
His confession is heartbreaking. Tony never did learn how many pups there had been in total. He’s almost afraid to know. But his curiosity gets the best of him.
“I get that. We all have a lot to unpack. Hell, my life story is insane. Trust me I get it. Is there anyone I can call for you? Surely you have someone here that you know.”
Tony smiles and leans in to connect their lips again. The kiss is short and sweet, but it’s enough to remind Steve that Tony truly loved him. It didn’t matter what the mirror showed. Tony didn’t care about any of that. Tony loved him.
It’s comforting to be back home, but that ache for his son is still present and only worsens when Steve is greeted with a large order of baby items. He had forgotten that Tony asked FRIDAY to place one for essentials.
“It’s after 4. I always get home at this time,” Morgan says and plops down in the chair beside her father.
It’s more difficult than usual to remove Steve’s suit. He cries out and flinches when Tony helps him slide out of it. Tony’s eyes are immediately drawn to bruises decorating his husband’s chest. He glances lower, remembering that Steve had been complaining of his stomach. Much to Tony’s relief there’s no bruises.
Steve giggles and snuggles up against his daughter. Tony tries to stretch his arm around her to get to Steve, but after a few failed attempts, he huffs and gives up.
Peter stares at himself in the mirror, brown eyes going wide and welling with tears. He didn’t look like his daddy at all. What was supposed to be hair on his face just like his daddy’s was instead brown scribbles. Peter panics and picks up the marker to fix his mistakes, but it gets worse.
Steve smiles and pulls Tony back in for another kiss. Tony takes control of the kiss again. He’s not as rough this time around, deciding to take his time and map out Steve’s warm mouth. They’ve kissed in an array of styles, but kissing Steve like this, soft and slow, is one of Tony’s favorites.
“Are you ready for the test? I hear the second half is pretty bad,” Ned says, completely oblivious to Peter’s strange behavior. Good. Peter doesn’t need him noticing yet.
The new sensation only adds to his already growing concern. He tries to ignore it like he has been, but even that is becoming difficult. When the pain passes, he’s able to compose himself and scrub himself clean.
Steve reaches out, slapping Tony’s hand away to replace it with his own. Tony’s eyes dart down to watch Steve jerk him off, and he has to bite back the moan that tries to escape. Steve quickened his pace, intending to make Tony cum.
“You okay?” Steve asks, deciding the clothes can wait. He moves toward Tony, eyes darting down toward the pile of dark pieces that still needed to be attached.
At least that’s what Tony had been trying to tell himself since he first set eyes on the super soldier. His plan was to play it cool and not allow himself to entertain the idea of him and Steve. For the most part it worked.
“Unfortunately that information is classified. We’re here to help find out where he’s located and bring him in. If you have any information then please come forward.”
Their eyes meet from across the room and Tony raises his glass. Steve smiles softly and turns away. Tony sighs and brings the glass up to his lips, chugging down the remainder of his Dirty Martini.
Tony drops down to one knee so that he’s at eye level with the bump. He places both hands over Steve’s belly, feeling his son squirming within.
But then new symptoms were beginning to make themselves known. The burst of energy was nice and not puking his guts out was even better, but he’d do without the random dizzy spells and leg cramps. And don’t get him started on the constipation.
Poor Steve! At least Tony was there to comfort him. I’ll get into more details about the other pups...
“Me? I was far from it. Getting into fights all the time with alphas twice my size. Yeah, perfect kid.”
He keeps his eyes fixated on the ceiling as the doctor works between his legs, checking for any damage. She must not find anything wrong and she sits back in her stool, straightening her back and removing the gloves.
Peter takes a moment to compose himself. He hadn’t talked about that night with anyone. Even Ned barely knew the details. It was too hard. But Peter knew he had to talk about it. He wanted to heal and be stronger. Just like Papa told him to be.
“Nothing. I mean not nothing but...can we talk later?” Tony asks when he catches sight of the worried look on Steve’s face.
They still had a long and bumpy road ahead of them. The healing wasn’t over yet, and whatever awaited them, no matter how difficult the struggle may be, they’d overcome it. Together.
Another gunshot rings out and this time Steve gasps, pain erupting in his side. He glances down to investigate, finding a bloody spot spreading across his dirtied shirt. He slumps off the alpha and holds his side, his teeth gritted tight.
It takes a moment for them to recover, then they’re switching roles. Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t nervous. It’s been a while since he found himself on all fours with his ass presented.
Tony moves toward him and leans back against the island, folding his arms over his chest, the envelope getting tucked under his arms. “I’m sorry about the other night. I didn’t mean to...it’s just hard talking about them.”
Peter’s eyes flutter for a moment, then they’re falling shut. He continues to nurse from the bottle until he’s had enough and lets the nipple slip from his lips. Tony takes the bottle and places it to the side. He knows what comes next and he hates that he has to disturb his son. Peter doesn’t fight while he’s burped, keeping his eyes closed while Tony gently pats his back.
The way Steve smiles and giggles from the dog’s affection almost makes Tony change his mind. He’s never seen his boyfriend so happy…well, happy like the way he was now. And Steve’s happiness was always going to come before his own.
Steve is grinning at the news and tears of joy are streaming down his face. He was never allowed to learn the gender of any of his children until they were out of his womb and into the world. But now he was able to learn the gender and prepare for his son’s arrival.
“Hi. Wow, I don’t think I’ve seen you this tired.” Pepper teases. Tony can’t help but roll his eyes. “It’s hard, isn’t it?”
Steve sighs in defeat. They don’t make it very far. He’s crying out and doubling over, both arms wrapping around his middle. The doctor and her staff gather around him. Questions are being thrown at him, but he can’t find his voice to answer any of them. The pain is too much.
“Then you never would’ve met me. We wouldn’t have mated and-” Tony winces again from the pain in his side and grits his teeth. “-fell in love, had a baby. Damn I wish I had done more. You and Pete would be safe. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
Steve smiles. “Yeah. He’s my brother. Just like Harley is yours. You need to be nicer to him, Pete,” Steve says then he turns to his oldest. “And you mister need to do the same. I know it was you who broke his LEGO set.”
“Steve, wait!” Tony quickly grips Steve’s wrist to prevent him from leaving. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. I’ll go.”
“Sorry,” Tony apologizes and shuts the door behind him. He makes sure to greet the older pups before coming over to take Sarah into his arms. “I almost have J up and running. What did I miss?”
“Oh shit.” Tony winces. He had forgotten that Steve’s caffeine intake was limited now. “I’ll still trade you.”
The lock on the door clicks and Steve snaps his head up in its direction. It opens, the sound of the metal scraping along the concrete floor makes him sick to his stomach. He backs himself further into a corner when two alphas enter the room. The warning growl he gives them does nothing to keep them away.
He gets scared again. He wasn’t prepared for his son’s arrival and he only had a few more weeks until Peter would be blessing them with his presence.
Steve is fast asleep when Tony goes to check on him a few hours later. He’s careful when he crawls on the bed to lie beside him. Steve must sense his presence because he moves toward him and curls up with him.
“Uncle Sam asked if I wanted to take your place. I...I don’t think I can. I’m not you. You said I was better but…” Peter trails off with a sad sigh and pulls his hand off the monument.
A plan begins to form. Tony has to stop himself, hating the idea that his brain conjures up. He’s had a lot of terrible ideas, but none were as dark and twisted as the one he has now.
“Yeah.” Steve nods and examines his slightly bruised wrists. He’s not concerned, knowing the serum will heal them in a few hours. “You?”
“Uh,” Peter takes a moment to think about it. He leans against the workbench and bites down on his bottom lip.
His world had come crashing down after the loss of his mother and then again when he lost Bucky. They had been the two people he looked up to most. They encouraged him and built him up, provided a sense of confidence he felt he never would’ve gained if not for them. He had been lost without them.
When Peter nods his head, Tony sighs sadly and puts the picture back in the journal. He pulls his son close again.
Tony allows Steve to lead him toward their bedroom. He’s reminded of their daughter that needed to be picked up, but Natasha had assured them to take as long as they wanted. She had meant their lunch date but Tony wasn’t about to pass up this opportunity. There was no telling when he’d get Steve like this again.
Harley and Sarah move toward Tony, crowding around him and sniffing the new person. Tony chuckles and helps Sarah sit down beside him so that she can continue to touch and giggle at her baby brother.
“It’s good. Just sensitive,” Steve explains, smiling down at the alpha, encouraging him to keep going. Tony complies and sucks the pink nub, a little harsher than before. Steve moans and tips his head back, his eyes falling shut. His body responds from the arousal; he’s already growing wet.
“It’s better! We’re having a baby!” Tony exclaims, pulling Steve close to connect their lips. He completely forgets that Dodger is squished between them until he’s barking and wiggling free.
Tony holds Steve, gently running his hands down his back. “Don’t pull a stunt like that again,” he says softly.
“I know! I’m doing everything I can to make sure both he and that pup are safe! I can’t just call anyone okay? All I have is you.”
They settle in their new home when Peter is around five. The large, secluded property is the perfect place to raise a family. With a lake and vast landscape, it was easy for Peter and Dodger to spend hours playing.
This time Tony does cringe and he takes another drink, chugging down the rest of the alcohol. He didn’t understand how this poor kid could look up to him. He wasn’t anything special. He was the world’s biggest screw up.
Hi! I know this one is getting the most updates but it’s been the only one I have the most ideas for. I’ll work on the rest when I’m off.
“I don’t know.” Tony shrugs and steps away from the counter to grab the jar of sauce he left on the island. “You’re giving me orders like one. Oh wait! What about...spangles? You fought for this country, right?”
“Steve,” Tony says softly and comes closer until he’s close enough to his husband to properly comfort him. He drops down on one knee in front of Steve and places a hand over his thigh, rubbing the area soothingly. “You’re going to be enough. She knows how much you love her. You wouldn’t have left if you didn’t care about her.”
Steve moves into the room, the soft sound of his feet padding against the new rug capturing Tony’s attention. He looks up from his project, his brows knitting in the center when he frowns.
“True. I couldn’t help it. Those sounds you were making,” Steve hums and leans in to connect their lips.
But he would help Steve. He’d do anything to get him back, to make him happy again. He’d give Steve hope.
The compound felt lonely. Well, lonelier than what it has been. Peter was used to having his family around him all the time. If he wasn’t spending time with his papa, then he was watching his aunt and Uncle Bucky spar in the training room. Sometimes he’d hang out in the lab and watch his uncle Bruce work. Or he’d watch his Uncle Sam practice new flight patterns around the vast property.
They continue to reminisce old memories that they’ve made over the years. There’s a few pictures that bring tears to their eyes and others that bring smiles and laughter. Peter enjoys it all.
Peter is screaming, his face red and scrunched up in discomfort. Steve is just as frustrated, if not more. He’s exhausted. He wonders how he’s even able to care for his son with his body so run down.
“Shh, it’s okay. Pete will be here soon and then it will all be over. We’ll get to meet him and hold him,” Tony whispers soothingly.
“You don’t have a fever, but you don’t look so good. Do you want to stay home? One day won’t kill you.”
The bed is neatly made; it hasn’t been touched in weeks. Tony had trouble sleeping in his own bed, but lately he couldn’t bring himself to enter the large space. Other memories haunted this room.
Tony greets the rest of his friends, then he moves toward the grave to lay the flowers down. Peter stands beside him and smiles.
Thunder booms again, and then the rain starts. Peter doesn’t care if he’s getting drenched in the cold rain.
“Don’t worry about it.” Steve rises to his feet, swaying slightly. Tony is quick to catch him, and tries to help him back into the chair, only for Steve to protest. “I’m fine. I just got up too quickly.”
“Not your fault. Well, maybe it is. You know we can order all of this stuff online right? Jarvis can do it for us,” Tony says, finally turning toward Steve.
“I didn’t know Tony had...company,” she says and she steps further into the room. “I shouldn’t be surprised. This happens a lot.”
They’re both lounging on the sofa in Tony’s lab, stuffed from pizza and soda and no energy to continue any more projects.
The nurse makes sure both of them are comfortable before excusing herself from the room. Now that he’s left alone, that fear comes rushing back. He doesn’t know what he’s supposed to be doing.
He doesn’t understand where they went wrong. They promised and assured each other that they could remain friends following the end of their relationship, but that proved to be easier said than done. Tony wasn’t helping the situation by distancing himself and Steve’s bitterness toward him was only making it worse.
Tony rolls his eyes and takes his usual spot beside Steve, and with a huff, leans back in the chair. “What I miss?” He asks. “Anything exciting?”
“Fuck,” Tony releases an animalistic growl and forces Steve’s legs open to expose his wet hole. He inhales deeply.
By the time the argument has simmered down, the whole family gathers around the table to eat. The tension is still high between her parents. Peter and her show a knowing look; she shrugs in response and turns back to her dinner.
Tony ignores his pleas, eyes burning with tears when he realizes that he’s hurting the one person he never wanted to hurt. But he didn’t have a choice. Morgan needed to be somewhere else right now.
Tony nods. That’s all he wants too. He doesn’t want Steve to suffer like this anymore. He’s been down this same road and it was hell. Steve was the one who saved him. Now it was his turn to save Steve.
“She’s okay,” he eventually says with a small shrug. “She misses you and it’s hurting her really really bad. But I think Uncle Bucky is in worse shape. You guys were best friends so...I mean, I’d be a mess too if I lost Ned. Uncle Sam is taking care of him. He’s...struggling too, though. He’s trying to keep everyone from falling apart and I think it’s taking a toll on him. He doing his best.
The doctor sighs. “Steve,” he says, his voice calm. Nothing at all like the alphas Steve has had address him before. “There’s nothing for you to apologize for. Whatever happened in your past wasn’t your fault. You had no control.”
“I know.” Tony rises to his feet and moves closer to his husband, taking his hands. “But you want this.”
“I know things aren’t easy right now. I’m sorry you’re having to make these tough decisions, but we’re all here for you okay? If you want to try school then great. And if you want to wait a little longer than that’s okay too. I just want you to be happy.”
He takes small, cautious steps toward the omega. He doesn’t reach out for him, deciding physical contact wasn’t something they needed right now.
He turns around in his chair and sets his eyes on his newest invention. For months he and Peter had planned and designed his suit. They never did get to finish it. Tony’s the one who finished it, hoping that maybe, just maybe, this would bring his son back to him.
“He does, doesn’t he? Fine. Send an invite to Pepper and Happy. Oh and Bruce. I’m sure he’d want to come.”
Steve collapses back down on the couch with a sigh. Tears are running down his face and he wipes at them angrily. Tony finds himself moving closer, no longer caring about the distance he knows needs to be between them. His alpha side urges him to be near the omega.
Thank you all so much for taking the time to read, comment, and leave kudos. It means so much to me and never fails to put a smile on my face. You guys are amazing! ❤️❤️❤️
He pulls off of Steve’s lips, smiling at the blissed out look plastered on his husband’s face. Steve’s eyes are closed and his lips are parted, soft breaths slipping past them.
WARNING! This chapter contains descriptions of suicidal thoughts. If it is triggering in any way please don't read it. I'd rather you back out now and go watch cute cat videos or something. It was hard for me to write since I struggled with postpartum depression for a while and had similar thoughts. And if you are struggling please reach out and get help. You are loved and you matter!
“Oh there will definitely be some changes around here.” Pepper glances around the large office, imagining how the space would look once she gets control of it. But it wasn’t just this room that needed a makeover. The whole company needed one inside and out.
“Look, it’s just better if I go,” Tony says. “Besides, what do I even contribute here? Just the stuff,” he waves his hands around the room. “This place?”
Tony turns his head in Steve’s direction and they share a smile. Steve presses his lips to Tony’s temple. “Thank you,” he whispers.
“Well, it was,” Tony answers. “But then someone else liked it a little more and the rest is history.”
He’s pretty sure he’s covered from head to toe in dust and possible bruising, but he can’t bring himself to care. At least he was alive.
Tony stays by Steve’s side, holding his hand and softly rubbing his thumb along his knuckles. Steve hasn’t shown any signs of waking up, but at least he was still alive. He was given another chance, another opportunity to keep fighting.
For ten minutes Peter and Tony were going back and forth asking each other questions. It was a fun little way for them to really get to know each other. So far Peter’s only learned a few facts about his dad. It was progress.
Tony leans forward until he’s hunched over the omega. The angle is perfect, hitting that spot inside that makes the omega scream. Tony continues to hit that spot, wanting to hear more of those amazing sounds.
Happy peers through the rear view mirror and their eyes meet. “Don’t worry, kid. Your secret’s safe with me.”
Tony glances up, frowning for a moment before looking back down again and continuing to softly play with Peter’s hair. “I’m trying. I’m not...entirely sure what I’m doing here.”
“You have to fight, remember?” Bucky reminds him. “You never back down. Come on, Steve, you have to keep fighting.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, snapping Tony from his thoughts. Their eyes meet. “I didn’t mean for this to happen. I didn’t know if I was ever going to find you. You’re not obligated to help me with this. I can raise this pup on my own.”
“You okay there, bud?” Steve asks and Peter turns toward him. “You zoned out. Bruce asked how you’re doing.”
“I know you’re worried.” Steve’s voice is so soft Tony would’ve missed it if his ears weren’t already straining for another familiar sound.
“Stevie, wait!” Peter calls out and rushes after his cousin. Behind him he can hear his uncles doing the same.
“Yeah well when you’re hiding from a fucking lunatic-” Tony’s kicked again and he grunts in pain. “Guess I deserved that.”
Steve complies easily until his son is cheering from being up so high. Steve brings him back down and hugs him close, then he kisses his son on the head.
The call is from Pepper. She has the paperwork and is ready for him to sign. Tony finishes up with the crib, then heads to his office to meet her.
“Hey.” It’s Tony’s turn to take Steve’s face in his hands and brush away the tears that fall. “I know. I don’t blame you. I’m sorry I couldn’t do more.”
“Oh shit! Uh...I mean. I have to go!” Peter rushes for the front door, ready to run out of the apartment.
His aunt rushes toward him, brushing his tears away. “Sweetie, no. You’re not making this difficult for anyone. It’s...it’s hard, yes, but not because of you. This isn’t your fault.”
Morgan refuses to acknowledge the behavior and goes in search of her parents. It’s easy to find one of them and she assumes the other is still at work.
I wrote this chapter and it came out kinda long so I split it up. Double update! Yay! I promise the smut is in the next chapter, but here is some cute moments between Steve and Tony!
“He’s there. The old Steve is still there. I know it doesn’t seem like he’s ever coming back, believe me I wonder about it sometimes myself, but he’s there. Hey, look at me,” Tony urges when Steve tries to turn away. Tony cups Steve’s face in his hands, forcing their eyes to lock again. He gently brushes away the tears that don’t stop falling. “It’s okay. You’re going to get out of this. I don’t care how long it takes, but I’ll do whatever I have to. I’m not going to lose you. I need you. Morgan needs you.”
For a moment Peter believes Flash will call him a name or maybe hit him. But instead he walks by, and purposely bumps into Peter.
Peter nods and quickly rushes after Happy. They step into the elevator and ride it quietly up to the top floor. Peter contemplates on starting up another conversation, but he decides against it. He had the feeling that his dad’s bodyguard/chauffeur didn’t like him very much.
But Steve would assure him that Tony wasn’t going to end up like his father. Tony would be a good dad. Peter would love him no matter what.
Harley’s blue eyes roam over the color pallet Tony has brought up on the screen. Then he points at red.
“Wait, James-” Natasha tries to say but Bucky isn’t listening. He makes his way toward Tony, anger flashing in his eyes and metal fist clenched.
It wasn’t a complete lie. Peter’s kicks and punches had been growing stronger everyday. The poor pup was running out of room to properly stretch. Steve didn’t blame him, but he would like for the kicks to not be so harsh.
He disappears into the elevator and the room is left in a heavy silence. Tony can feel the eyes of his teammates on him, and turning toward them he’s greeted with worried and confused faces.
Tony plops down in his chair, hating how uncomfortable it feels now. Being back behind the desk should bring some kind of feeling, but there’s nothing. He hates being back. He wishes he could hide away and drown in his sorrows. It was pathetic but it’s all he knows now.
Tony takes a shaky breath and quickly wipes at his eyes, but the tears keep falling. He gives up on the piece he’s trying to upgrade. His focus is gone.
Tony doesn’t respond. He honestly doesn’t know if he believes Steve’s words. He can’t see everything being fine when Steve wasn’t here.
“Don’t scare this one away,” Tony points a threatening finger at Happy and waves Peter in with his other hand.
They’re both dressed and drinking their morning coffee. His dad is talking about an issue in the R&D department; Peter doesn’t miss how irritated he sounds. It makes him nervous.
“I don’t want to do this,” Bucky admits. The tears in his eyes have escaped and a few roll down his face. He takes a shaky breath to calm himself, but he’s struggling. “I can’t.”
Peter’s diaper is wet, but it’s nothing Steve can’t handle. He feeds him again, settling down in the rocking chair to nurse him. Once Peter gets his fill and is burped, he’s falling back to sleep and Steve places him back in the crib.
“Nope,” Steve quickly gathers his son, ignoring the whining and kicking. “Peter Benjamin, we do not get on the counter.”
Tony smiles softly down at his mate. Two years ago those words would never have been said by Steve. For the longest time he had refrained from using that title. It had been tainted, and only reminding him of the alpha that forced him to use it. Steve has grown significantly since then. The title no longer terrifies him.
Peter was quiet. It wasn’t unusual to find the boy so reserved; he was naturally shy and only came out of his shell once he was comfortable. Bucky had expected his nephew to be talking his ear off about
Peter nods and makes his way over to the bed, running a hand over the duvet. He peers up at his dad and smiles. “Thanks.”
Steve scoffs and peers down at his son when Peter squirms. He calms him down again, running his finger soothingly along his face. “We tried,” Steve says. “It didn’t work. It never works.”
As a kid he often dreamed of following in his father’s footsteps. The shield was a symbol to everyone, but it was the person behind the shield that Peter looked up to the most. He didn’t want to be Captain America, he wanted to be like Steve.
Steve gasps and his gaze falls on his husband. They share a smile. “She’s...wow she’s already rolling over,” Steve says. There's a bit of hurt in his tone.
Babies got into everything. Pretty soon Peter would be walking and exploring every inch of their home. Steve had to admit lake house was a lot safer than the compound...to a certain extent. The body of water outside was worrisome.
“You let him mark you!” The alpha snarls and he slaps Steve again. His fingers twist painfully into Steve’s hair and he yanks the omega’s head back to expose the mark again. His other hand comes up to trace the indentations on Steve’s neck. “How dare you,” the alpha seethes. “You belong to me!”
That urge wasn’t going to go away any time soon, probably not ever. The alpha in him wants nothing more than to protect the omega and his pup. And that’s exactly what he’s going to do.
“Hmm,” Alexander frowns and he leans back in his seat and crosses his arms over his chest. “I can only recall one incident. I’m sorry, Mr. Stark, but I wasn’t watching you all night. I did have other guests.”
The date goes better than Steve thought it would. He didn’t let his insecurities get in the way and they were able to enjoy the evening. Being alone with Tony again was something Steve never imagined. They were supposed to have broken up and moved on with their lives, but they had already proved time and time again that they could never be apart. That love between them never died.
He decides to keep what he’s learned to himself. It won’t be easy and it would probably drive him insane, but it was too risky to share. There were some things that were better left unsaid. Peter wished he had been spared.
Steve pulls away so that their eyes can meet. “I don’t want to lose you. For the first time I’m starting to feel like myself. You’ve given me hope. He’s not worth losing all of this over.”
Sam can’t help but glance at the spot where his friend used to sit, silently asking for his guidance. He wonders what Steve would do in their current situation. Steve would probably call a meeting the same way Sam has, willing to listen to everyone’s opinions and work on a solution. Sam wasn’t Steve, and he never will be, but he was going to be a good leader. Just like Steve knew he could be.
Steve stiffens at those words. He watches as Tony takes Peter over to the crib and lays him down for the night. Steve knew one day they’d have to use the crib. The moment Peter was born he had been sleeping in the bassinet set up in the master bedroom. Steve liked having his son close by.
Steve’s fingers tighten around the wheel until his knuckles are turning white. He takes his eyes off the road to glance at Peter again, hating the hurt and angered look he finds on his features.
“Okay.” Tony agrees and he reaches out to brush away the tears still falling from Steve’s face. “Come sleep with me.”
Peter sighs sadly and continues sorting through the movies, only to pause when he comes across his papa’s favorite Disney film. He picks up the dvd of
Steve sighs and rises to his feet. He moves toward Tony and reaches out for him, taking his hand and forcing him to stop. Tony sighs heavily and lets Steve take his hand.
“I’m only suggesting that you promote him. Make him head of security. You know he’s the perfect person for it,” Pepper says.
Steve takes a moment to compose himself and he runs a hand through his hair. The shaky intake of air he takes and the tears that roll down his face only urges Tony to comfort him even more.
Steve pushes harder, using every bit of strength he has to bring his son into the world. His efforts pay off, and with a pained yell, Peter is sliding from his body and into the doctor’s awaiting arms.
“You’ll never feel it.” Tears are streaming down Steve’s face. He keeps his fingers wrapped tight around the front of his husband’s suit jacket. His husband. That word didn’t feel right anymore. Tony wasn’t his husband. He was a- “You’re a monster. A killer.”
“I can’t, Tony.” Steve backs away to put some distance between them. The look on Tony’s face breaks Steve’s heart. It only makes him feel worse. “I’m sorry,” he whispers.
Steve searches for the little screen that was going to give him a glimpse of his baby, only to discover that there wasn’t one. He gasps when the image of the pup appears above him, floating in the air. Steve stretches his fingers out to touch it, pulling back when his hand goes through the projected picture.
“Please, Pete?” Steve turns to begging his son, even though he knows his words have no effect on him. “I don’t know what to do.”
Steve nods and Tony grins. Tony leans closer, his warm breath ghosting over Steve’s lips. Steve’s breath hitches in his throat when Tony kisses him. The kiss is slow and soft, but he knows that pace won’t be kept up for long.
The welcome Tony gets doesn’t feel warm, or at least like the ones he used to get from the Avengers. The two people genuinely happy to see him are of course Peter and then Bruce. At least Tony felt safe in knowing if shit were to go down, he’d have the green guy on his side.
Tony learns about Peter’s love for science, his best friend Ned, and even a little bit about the girl he’s been crushing on.
“Thanks,” Tony mutters and accepts the tissue. He wipes along his mouth. “Gross,” he grimaces at the soiled tissue before tossing in the toilet.
Steve’s face heats up and he pushes Tony’s hand away. “A little yeah. But it’s nothing. I already told you.”
“I know.” Pepper rubs his shoulder again before turning and walking away to mingle with more of the guests.
And even if there was the slightest chance of them becoming mates Steve was sure he had already ruined it. He hadn’t meant to lose his temper in front of the alpha. If it had been anyone else Steve would have been reprimanded in a heartbeat. Disrespecting an alpha was a punishable crime. At least that’s what he had been trained to believe.
“I love it when you beg.” Tony doesn’t let up and he picks up the pace, fucking Steve hard and fast with his fingers. Steve responds with a moan and his walls tighten around Tony’s fingers.
Peter fiddles nervously with his fingers. “There was a party...I don’t know. He didn’t tell me all the details because that would be weird. I definitely don’t need to know how you two...fondued.”
“You’re still here?” A familiar voice fills Steve’s ears and he glances up, finding Sam stepping into the room. The alpha immediately begins helping Steve clean up.
“Yes,” Bruce smiles and he moves the transducer around to get a clear image. “I’d say you’re about twelve weeks.”
Steve huffs and glances down at the costume he’s been forced to wear. When Tony had said he’d make the costume, Steve had assumed it would be more adult friendly. Instead Tony had recreated their son’s onesie. It’s red and blue with spiderwebs and a large black spider on the chest.
But he stays, making sure he doesn’t interact for long. He sits down on one of the sofas, the world around him blurring. If only the pain would do the same.
Pepper pulls away and gestures for another tissue, then she tries to clean up the black smudges her mascara left behind. “And now I have to talk to the police and...and…” she pauses to take a deep, shaky breath. “This is all wrong. It doesn’t make any sense!”
“Hey, Stark,” Flash calls out to him. Peter doesn’t look at him at first. It’s not until Flash calls his name again does Peter finally meet his gaze.
“Get out of there, Steve,” Natasha's voice comes through. “There’s flames where I’m located. This place isn’t going to be standing much longer.”
“It wasn’t!” Rhodey yells back. For a moment they’re left standing in silence. Rhodey sighs and says, “Tony, I’m sorry. I’m sorry that...that all this shit happened.”
But that was the point. He needed to be here and talk. He needed others to listen and help him regain his confidence.
“Hey,” Tony greets lamely. He doesn’t get a response in return. “Um I just wanted to check up on you, make sure you were okay.”
“Yeah.” Steve rises to his feet, deciding he’s had enough of the conversation. God knows they’ll only be having another one just like it tomorrow. “I’m going to lie down for a bit.”
“I’m just saying. You and Steve are practically married. Or at least you act like a married couple.”
Tony reaches out to pat him on the shoulder, then he turns and heads toward the door. He has one hand on the knob when Steve speaks to him.
“At least let me help,” Happy says, a little calmer this time. “Something isn’t right. It’s my job to take care of you, remember?”
Steve clears his throat, his face burning when he catches the lingering stares from his teammates. He hated arguing with Tony in front of the team.
“I know, I know.” Tony takes Steve’s hand and offers him a smile, hoping to shift his husband’s attitude. “I’m proud of you, honey. This was the first step and you did it.”
He rushes through the rest of his shower. He doesn’t notice the way the water near his feet is tinged a pale pink.
Bruce takes both a urine and blood sample, then leaves the room to get the samples he’s collected to the lab.
That smile on Steve’s face returns. It’s not as vibrant as the one before it and it’s obvious there’s not much joy behind it, but it’s better than seeing Steve upset.
“There will be no next time,” Pepper frowns. “Not after this. I don’t know what kind of trouble you got into and I don’t want to know.”
“Pete, you need to relax,” Steve leans forward in his chair to pat Peter’s thigh. “Everything is going to be fine.”
Steve silences him with a kiss. They break apart and Steve leans forward to rest their foreheads together. “I promise. No more missions. I’ll hang up the shield.”
Peter steps out of the room and makes his way back into the living room, finding his uncles trying to console his upset aunt. They all glance up when they hear him approach.
“Morning.” Steve grins and works on finishing scrambling the eggs. “You took forever getting ready.”
“No. Let’s just go. Sorry about the car.” Steve winces at the thought of getting into the car in his current state.
It starts off normal enough for Tony. He has a nine o’clock conference call in twenty minutes, followed by a meeting with the new group of interns. Same old same old. Nothing new.
Tony makes a face. “Don’t remind me. It’s fine. And if it doesn’t go away by tomorrow then I’ll take a test.”
“That’s it?” Tony points again at the blob in the center. He’s sure he’s said those two words at least five times now, but he couldn’t wrap his mind around the thought of his grandchild only being a blob. Or maybe he just couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that he was staring at a picture of his grandchild.
“I think I’m ready for bed,” Steve says and he makes an attempt to get up. Tony rises to his feet to help him.
Tony rarely did any of the cooking, and there was a good reason for that. Steve’s lost count of how many times their kitchen was almost burned down. The alpha was getting better in the cooking department. He still hasn't mastered how to keep flour from getting everywhere, but at least the kitchen wasn’t filling up with smoke.
“You don’t have to. Look, I’m gonna say this. You don’t have to tell me anything if it makes you uncomfortable.”
Steve's eyes fill with tears, a few escaping and rolling down his face. “I love you too. I want us to go back to how we used to be. Everything was...normal. We were happy.”
He takes a seat in one of the black, leathered arm chairs. Another drink is offered and he takes it without hesitation. If he was going to get through this night then he needed a little buzz.
“Did she wake up early?” Tony asks instead. The dark circles under Steve’s eyes have yet to fade, and it seems every day they’re getting more prominent.
Before Steve can even reply to the question, Natasha is joining. “I mean if he chooses not to, at least you still have us.”
Tony sighs and sets his tablet aside, then he quickly grabs the pacifier Steve loved to claim was Peter’s favorite, and offers it to his son. Peter accepts it immediately and soon the room is filled with the soft suckling he makes and the hum of the swing’s motor.
“I’m sorry. I don’t want to promise I won’t do it again because I don’t know. Tony, I’m a mess. I don’t know if I can-”
“Yes,” he says through gritted teeth. “My rut is starting and I need to be away from him. What part don’t you get?”
With a sob he drops to his knees, unable to stand anymore. He doesn’t care that the rain is pouring harder now, drenching his suit, a shiver running through him and bones aching from the cold. None of it mattered.
Sam comes over next, stopping by the foot of the bed and tying the small bunch of balloons to the bedpost. “They’re not as cuddly as a bear but..”
Steve snaps his head up, eyes locking with cold, blue ones. Alexander has the gun, a satisfied smirk on his lips. Rumlow is beside him, ready to comply with any order he’s given.
“We can take this to go.” Tony suggests and he waves over the waiter to ask for both a box and the check.
“Pete,” comes the sound of his papa’s voice from the other side of the door. Another knock follows. “Come on, bud, let me in. I just want to talk.”
It may not seem like a lot, but Steve’s agreement for them to talk is a big deal. In the past, talking was one of things they failed to get right. They had tried, but somehow their conversations always shifted and turned into a fight. Battling it out with each other was easier.
Losing Captain America had been hard on not just the world, but the team that followed him. Captain Rogers was more than just a patriotic symbol, he was a friend and a father first. His loss caused severe pain, especially to those closest to him. Nick himself even felt the grief hit hard. It was then that he knew he needed to find a way to bring Steve Rogers back.
When he opens his eyes, he’s met with soft dark ones. Peter is staring at him, his eyes bright and smile even brighter. He giggles and places both hands on Steve’s face, cupping his cheeks and playfully slapping them. It doesn’t hurt, but it does the trick at waking Steve up fully.
Clint promised to teach their son how to shoot and to not be surprised if they got a bow and arrow for the baby shower. Bruce was happy, more so that both the baby and Tony were doing fine.
“You can blame me,” Sam says. “I never should have let you go on that mission, Cap. I knew something was wrong-”
He remembers the Iron Man and Avenger days vividly. Something bad always happened; there was barely a moment's peace. The look on Peter’s face takes him back to the days when bad things were happening all around him.
Tony swallows hard and reaches up to place his hand over the one on his shoulder. Their eyes meet and a small, sad smile is shared between them.
It became even more so when he had his son. He knew he couldn't trick or treat anymore-he stopped a long time ago and his husband made sure to remind him that he was all grown up-but now that he had his son, trick or treating was back on. And maybe he was using his son as an excuse to dress up and get free candy, but who was judging? Steve. Steve was judging.
“Flash!” Peter calls out. Flash turns around at the sound of his name, then he purposely ignores Peter and keeps walking. That doesn’t stop Peter and he rushes after him, panting heavily once he’s caught up to him. “Wait. We need to talk.”
Steve’s nervous to be in the spotlight. For years he had been locked away. Anyone who ever did know him believed he had died in a plane crash.
“I don’t talk about him much,” Tony continues their conversation. “I don’t talk about either of them. They died when I was seventeen.”
Tony ignores the ache in his back to attend to his mate. He brings Steve close, making room for him on the bed so that Steve could properly curl up beside him. He comforts Steve by scenting him and pressing kisses wherever his lips can reach.
Happy shakes his head, but a hint of a grin still appears over his face. “Glad to have you back, Tony.”
Peter doesn’t rush to Stark Tower after the meeting with his uncles. He wishes he didn’t have to bail on his aunt, but he needed to see his dad and tell him the good news.
The alpha smirks smugly and applies more pressure, searching for that spot that he knows will have Steve coming in seconds. He finds it on the next thrust, the tip of his finger brushing against the bundle of nerves and provoking a loud moan past Steve’s lips. The omega’s back arches and his hands grip the sheets, twisting the cotton tightly.
“Let’s try one more time. And if it doesn’t work then…” Tony trails off. He takes a second to reply, almost as if he’s unsure about his response. “Then I’ll do it. I’ll carry the baby.”
“If you want I can show you around,” Peter offers, shifting awkwardly from foot to foot. “I mean if you want.”
Since having Morgan his life turned upside down and not for the reason he thought it would. He loved her more than anything, and yet a part of him wondered why he bothered having her if he was only going to hurt her.
Bucky continues to sob. “I should’ve done more. He’s gone because of me. Both of them are gone because of me.”
The other part of his brain intervenes, completely taking full control and making Tony forget about the situation he’s found himself in. Omega. That’s the only thing that’s on his mind.
Steve lifts his head to glare at his friend, then with an annoyed huff, he throws his head back against the pillow. “Not even close.”
Steve glances at the tray, his stomach rumbling in response at the sight of french toast, eggs, bacon, and orange juice. Steve huffs out a laugh and peers up at Tony. “This is it, right? There won’t be a surprise party waiting for me downstairs?”
“Then pay attention. If you want to go out there and fight then your guard always has to be-” Steve is cut off when something sticky wraps around his legs and he’s yanked down to the mat. He lands on his back with an ‘oof’.
For years he’s been trying to escape Hydra’s clutches. The abuse and tormenting they put him through was something he could no longer endure. He had been willing to accept it at one point, but then they made their agenda clear, and he wasn’t going to let them hurt anymore of his pups.
Peter nods. “I do. I just...I guess I never thought I’d ever hear it. I didn’t know if I was ever going to meet you. My papa wanted us to meet but the rest of my family...well, you know how it is.”
“Dad?” Morgan decides to speak up. She pauses for a moment, waiting for one of her brothers to interrupt. When they don’t, she continues. “My project isn’t too complicated. I thought we could create a-”
Steve knows he’s pregnant before even taking a test. He’s been pregnant three times and knows his body well enough-
Judging by the surprised expression that appears over Bruce’s face Tony assumes Peter hadn’t told anyone what he’s been doing. Makes sense. Tony would be nervous too.
His friends are with him through all the highs and lows. They cheer him up when his emotions overpower him and he cries at everything. When he’s craving ice cream at two in the morning, it’s Sam who makes a late trip to the grocery store. They’re there for everything, and Steve couldn’t be more blessed to have them.
“I don’t care.” Steve smiles and pecks a quick kiss to Tony’s lips. “But maybe brush your teeth before we go.”
But the party, surrounded by friends and loved ones, was the exciting part. All of his family was in the same room together. His uncle Thor was able to escape his duties from Asgard and even his uncle Clint and aunt Laura came with his cousins. Peter enjoyed being around them, and could already picture his new cousin joining the clan.
Sam looks like he wants to question him again, but instead he drops it and together they enter the jet.
“I’m sorry,” Steve apologizes and sits up. He runs a hand through his hair and lets out a deep breath. “I didn’t mean to interrupt you.”
It’s just another excuse he likes to tell himself whenever Steve starts hinting. First, Steve suggested they move out of the city and find a little place out in the country. Tony had brushed it off. He loved the city. It was home.
Natasha rolls her eyes and climbs off him, and Peter gulps down the air his body desperately needs. She frowns down at him and shakes her head.
He doesn’t want to get out of bed, but something is telling him to search for his husband. It’s easy to find him. There’s a sliver of light peeking out from Morgan’s room, but it’s the mixture of his daughter's cries and soft sniffs that leads Tony to where Steve is.
Steve complies quickly and lies on his back. Tony spreads his legs, exposing the omega to his greedy gaze. Tony lies between Steve’s legs, grinding down and emitting a soft moan from the omega.
Happy nods and turns away. He He rises to his feet to gather his empty plate, then he gestures to Steve’s. “You want more?”
He missed everything about his old life. He missed his best friend; he missed the trouble they would get into. It was always Steve getting into the trouble, but it had been Bucky coming to his rescue. It had always been Bucky.
It was a mess. A mess Steve had wanted to avoid. When he left Alpha and Hydra behind, he didn’t anticipate running into the alpha that sired his pup. His main goal was to get as far away from his enemies as he can. Bumping into Tony was an accident.
There had been one person missing from the cheering crowd. It hurt to know that his papa wasn’t there to witness his graduation. It was a big day for him, a day he would never forget. He’s reminded of the people he still had with him, and that was enough to keep his spirits high.
Clint scoffs. “So you’re telling me that you couldn’t even flip on the news? Your son needed you on the worst day of his life-”
I’ll probably show a little bit of Steve’s life with Peter and then do a time skip. Just gonna be honest but some of those tags are coming into play soon....sorry 😞
“Where to?” Happy asks, his eyes peering through the mirror and in the omega’s direction. When he doesn’t get a response, Tony steps in.
With both his aunt and uncle distracted, Peter decides to go back to his room and tidy it up and sort through his belongings.
Becoming a dad was the last thing Tony ever expected. Sure he thought about it a few times, but that idea of starting a family was squashed the day he and Steve broke up. He never told Steve that he had pictured one day having children with him. It was too big of an idea to throw at Steve, especially when it was just a fantasy.
Tony has to fight the urge to roll his eyes. He’s lost count of how many times he’s heard that response. It was obvious Steve was more than just tired.
The lock on the door clicks, startling Steve and sending a wave of fear through him. He sits up, readying himself to comply. The door opens and two alphas step inside. Steve can’t help but growl at the sight of them.
They were going to be disappointed, mad even. His papa might be more understanding but his dad would see red and probably yell.
Peter doesn’t even make an attempt to get back up. The mat was comfortable and he was able to catch his breath from the floor. His eyes shoot open when he senses someone nearby and he glances up, connecting them with green.
The tears keep streaming down his face and he has to fight the urge not to scream at the sight of the casket. He shuts his eyes, praying to wake up, to be saved from this torment.
“Once you go Stark you never go back,” he answers.  On reflection, that statement sounded slightly less pervy in his head.  Moving on.
He glances back at the woman that fate and effort have allowed him to love and thanks the stars that despite the near impossibility of their respective lives, they managed to make this work.
Because he has the world’s most inconvenient and conspicuous fashion accessory embedded in his chest.  If Steve gets one look at that thing or even leans into his chest too firmly, the whole jig is up.  There’s really no way to justify it.
Clint immediately starts running across the street, Tony and Thor take to the sky, and he and Natasha head toward the specified building.  He feels a brief pang of conscience when he shatters the lock on the door with his shield, but he’ll be supremely thankful if that’s the most damage that gets done tonight.  He and Natasha have just located the staircase when panic breaks out over the com link.
“Like what?” Steve repeats.  “You said you’re working on something important.  I'm just wondering what’s so critical that you’re postponing government contracts.”
Turns out, traveling via Iron Man is the most efficient way to travel.  They make the jaunt from Manhattan to Chinatown in a matter of minutes, although they mostly have to rely on Tony’s helmet display for navigation.  He can just barely make on the familiar landmarks in the fading sunlight; New York has never come closer to looking like a ghost town.
Oh.  Okay.  So that’s a no.  Steve can feel his face going red, and he tries to balance his energy between keeping his face from flushing and ignoring the sinking feeling at the bottom of his stomach.  He needs to get out of here.  Now, before the situation gets any worse.  “If you’re not interested, that’s fine – ” he stands, desperately willing himself not to use super-speed to leave the room.  He’s almost taken the first step when Tony reaches out and grabs his forearm.
However, that doesn’t mean he can’t royally butter Steve up first.  If he’s going to drop that massive truth bomb on Steve, then he’s going to make sure it comes at the end of a night that makes him want to stick around.  All he has to do is…
The robot bobs up and down on his hinges, indicating Lord knows what, before turning his pincer toward Steve.  As if summoned, the SHIELD agent approaches Dum-E and squats down, which is also stupid since the bot doesn’t have eyes either.
Clint’s voice resonates from somewhere high, and Steve looks up.  The archer is perched on top of the lavish gold sculpture of General Sherman, but his eyes are focused on something far in the distance.
“I thought that’s what you said, but I could have sworn I heard you wrong.”  The inventor pinched the hologram he was working on into nonexistence to turn his full attention to Steve.  “You do know what that is, right?  And everything it entails?”
“Oh come on,” Tasha retorts.  “You can’t tell me you didn’t enjoy letting loose on some Doombots.  This has gotta be some sort of stress relief for you.  You don’t exactly strike me as the yoga type.”
The director inclines his head toward the elevator, and the doors, as if they sense his gesture, part seamlessly.  Within moments, a cool British voice resonates from the speakers in the ceiling.
thinking about Steve with wind-tossed hair and bagels in hand like the world’s most attractive secret agent/delivery boy.  There, see?  Gone.  Not thinking about it.  At all.
.”  Clint snaps his fingers on the final word and looks remarkably pleased with himself.  “Convenient that your name’s Steve.  That works really well.”  After a moment, his face shifts into a look of confusion.  “Why is Stark texting you gifs from children’s movies?”
“Okay, how about this?  I solemnly swear that if I don’t meet Mount Sinai’s construction deadline, I’ll start working on those Helicarriers.”
distracting as the woman can be in person, Steph finds that her absence is just as problematic.  After two months of living with her, the mansion seems unnervingly empty when Tasha’s not filling it with her overly-loud comings and goings.  How one tiny woman manages to take up so much space is something Steph will never quite understand.  Still, the silence she leaves behind is deafening.
Tony starts pointing at his bots, calling out their names as his finger circulates.  “U.  Butterfingers.  JARVIS is my eye in the sky.  And Dum-E…Dum-E, where are you?”  He looks around the lab and tries to find his problem child.  Dum-E knows he’s supposed to stay on his charging station when he doesn’t have a job to do, but there’s no telling what happens when he decides to go walkabout.  The last time Dum-E had gone into hiding, he’d broken the blender and hidden the shattered pieces behind the 3D printer.  It had taken him three days to locate the smell of rotting bananas.
“You said I’d have to suck it up and bear it because pining after a guy in a suit is tough luck,” he repeats. She doesn’t even both to deny it, so he presses his luck another inch. “I wear a suit.”
The noise prompts the figure to turn his way.  A pair of solid black eyes regard him with a nasty expression, and the creature raises one of its arms.  Steve barely has time to see the faint crackles of energy before a strong arm pushes him to the ground.
“JARVIS,” he yells, “force release,” and, to his ever-lasting relief, the leaden figure falls from his hands.
Steve sighs, and begins to strategize.  “Okay, our main objective is containment.  Things are nonviolent at the moment, and let’s aim to keep it that way, but just in case have the police form a line of blast shields along 5th Avenue between 72nd and 79th.  Tell them to be as inconspicuous as possible and to refrain from using weapons, but get them ready in case things turn sour.  We should go in from the south and the east to keep her from getting any further into the park.  Hawkeye, I want you up high, while Widow and I go in from the ground.  Tony was calling Iron Man as I left the Tower, so hopefully we’ll have eyes in the sky sometime soon.”
“Okay, I’m going in.  Let’s keep this calm, and hopefully we’ll get out of here without things escalating.  Widow, you copy?”
“Well it was, until you vandalized my front door.”  Surprisingly, Stark’s voice doesn’t sound accusatory.  If anything, Steve would call it amused.
“I’m not exactly shocked by the idea of things I can’t understand,” he starts. “I accepted a long time ago that there are certain things in the world that are far beyond my ability to comprehend. The only thing I can control is how I react to what’s put in front of me. So yes, I’m adjusting, at least as much as I know how.”
"How many fake dates have you been on, then?” he replies.  He aims for a light tone, but he’s pretty sure the delivery falls somewhere closer to rueful.
But it never happened.  Rogers had simply asked, “Is now a more convenient time to talk?” in a ridiculously calm voice, and Tony was left wondering just who the hell this guy actually was and if he had a couple of screws loose.  He’d managed a
In the almost two months since the Battle of New York; he’s tried to find some way to bring himself to terms with being displaced almost seventy years in time. In some sense, the Chitauri invasion helped. It’s utterly horrible that an alien army invaded New York (and some days he still has a hard time believing it actually happened), but the attack gave him purpose and a reason to wake up in the morning. Yet as dramatic as the whole invasion was, the entire confrontation played out in over a course of three days.  The Avengers, who admittedly functioned well under pressure, disbanded after seeing Loki off to Asgard, under the impression that they would assemble “when they were needed.”  Fortunately, nothing has yet come up that requires them to reunite.
