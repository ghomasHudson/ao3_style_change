Tony feels bereft of the man’s touch, but he has no recourse to complain. It’s what he asked for after all. Still–
“…I’m not buying you a villa,” Antony declares. “Hadrianus would have a fit, and as amusing as that would be–”
“You can’t go to the Arctic this year,” he tells him. His approach is sheepish, a touch unsure. His hands are clammy around his stack of collated and clipped papers.
“You will not be banker. It is Jim’s turn fair and square,” James states flatly, having sussed out the larger man’s game.
Steve sits heavily on the bed, buries his face in his hands, and weeps.
To Antony’s surprise, Tiberius can be downright pleasant (when he wanted to be). Antony can see why he is so well-liked. Tiberius is charismatic, friendly, and funny, everything that Antony strived to become. It also didn’t hurt that he is athletic in build and handsome.
“You’re not even a real Jedi yet?”
“Isn’t that sweet?” Purple Man murmurs. “You heard him. He wants it.”
“You know Stevie. Stiff upper lip.”
Antony makes no move for the oil, so he prompts him again, his voice containing an underlying wobble, “The oil?” It’s a final bid for mercy, but when Antony still remains between his legs, Stefanus squeezes his eyes shut, accepting his fate.
“That’s what I’m afraid of.”
“Wait. Back up. You brought a pet?” Tony looks back at the goat, terror in his gaze. “Steve. You know what’s going to happen to it, right? You shouldn’t think it being someone’s pet will stop him. I once snuck this stray cat into my room, and when I came home from school, Scruffles was gone, and in his place was a terrified ED specialist, there for an intervention over my obvious closet eating. Dad said I shouldn’t feel the need to hide snacks in my room.” Tony squirms in his seat. “I was eight and just wanted a pet!”
“It was a long time ago.”
A man can’t claim to have had sex in all fifty states without Alaska, and where’s the glory in stopping at 49?
That is a clear falsehood with how much his presence had affected Antony, even before the man so much as gave voice to the first insult. Stefanus may not be Roman; he may not understand all the intricacies of their class system and social networks, but it was clear from their brief conversation that this Servilius fellow is not only an ex-lover of Antony’s, but their relationship had ended on acrimonious terms.
Steve ponders his next move. “If I may intrude on your kindness once again… is there a way I could perhaps earn their return to their original human forms as they were before we so rudely stumbled into your path?” he tries again.
“I have my ways.”
“It won’t change anything!”
Steve is immediately apologetic. “Tony–”
“I said fuck him already.” He injects so much persuasive force into his voice, Stark nearly shivers with the assault on his senses, but he complies, removing his fingers and sliding his dick inside in one firm stroke. Rogers nearly shouts at the sudden intrusion, his body going taut, his face pinched. Stark whimpers, the hands on Rogers’s hips shake as he thrusts in rhythmically though much too fast, much too rough to be pleasurable for his partner. Rogers grunts painfully and palms the edge of his desk so hard, Purple Man wonders if he’s going to split the wood. Which would be a shame. It is high-quality mahogany after all.
“Stefanus!” Erasmus calls out to him, causing him to turn and witness the truth of Bacchus’s words himself, for beside his doctores stood Antony and a woman he had never seen before dressed in a bright yellow toga. He beckons him over then motions for another secutor to take his place opposite Bacchus. “Crispus, you’re up.”
Steve doesn’t want the second disagreement to come to blows so he volunteers, “I’ll collect more wood for the fire if you find the flint to light it, yeah?” He doesn’t even wait for them to confirm the plan before he sets out down a well-trodden path into the forest.
“I am simply–”  Master Erskine stops, his head turned to peer down a side street. “Do you feel that?”
“Not for a long time.”
Purple Man cants his head. “This is about the captain, isn’t it?” A flicker of guilt, of regret, flashes across Stark’s face. Purple Man can only chuckle at how small-minded, how human this so-called ‘futurist’ had turned out to be. “Is that why you rebelled? Because you couldn’t stomach what you had done?”
Probably more than a quick fuck in the secutors’ barracks, no matter how much he desperately desires the distraction.
He gives himself a mental shake at the errant thought. Tony is on a date with Captain America of all people, and he desperately wants to make a good impression. Though they had never discussed their sexual histories, Steve is old-fashioned and likely has only had a couple partners, if any. By contrast, Tony has lodged so many notches in his hypothetical bedpost to have threatened its structural integrity altogether. He’s not ashamed of his past, but he is concerned he may be too “well-traveled” for someone like Steve.
The title means “Bread and circuses.” It is a Roman figure of speech meaning superficial appeasement. In politics, it means becoming popular not through service or policy but through entertainment, distraction, and satisfying the base requirements of the people (by offering food and/or entertainment).
into consideration. Now, I’ve got work to do, and not a lot of time for chit chat.” He pointedly turns around and grabs his soldering gun, pulling a portion of the chest piece closer.
It’s going to be at least a week before Rhodey can tow their ship. In the aftermath of Order 66, the Galactic Republic has restricted citizen movement and commandeered ships to ferry supplies and clone soldiers between outposts as they hunt down and weed out the Jedi threat. Steve had felt it before, the dread heavy like an ache in his gut, from the moment he and Master Phillips had been attacked, but he had attributed the bereft feeling to adrenaline and then to Master Phillips’s passing. The ache had ebbed and flowed but when it failed to abate even days later, he finally identifies the source: it is the feeling of Jedi falling one by one across the galaxy.
Steve is quick to add. “We’ll both get tested.”
There’s something bugging him, something Steve has been meaning to ask. “You say Mandalorians are not prohibited from having partners or families, right?” He disengages the lightsaber, having finished his katas. He looks over at Stark expectantly.
He punches in a frequency from memory. “Rhodey? Rhodey, come in. It’s Tony.”
“We are.”
“Limited visibility inside, though the garden and sign on the roof indicate there may be survivors–”
“Just know if you hurt him–”
If Antony notices the difference in sentiment, Antony doesn’t say it, and his face barely darkens at Stefanus’s hesitation as he repeats, “Would you like it if I bought you? The villa would be your home; you will not have to fight, and the possibility of death will be but a distant specter. We could have a more formalized relationship if you’d like, as my concubinus. Nothing will change between us, and even Hadrianus will be hard-pressed to deny the suitability of such an arrangement, not without alienating many in his base.”
“But–”
“I’ll give you sixty cred for the lot,” Master Phillips haggles with the essential mineral merchant. Minerals are one of Pax’s few exports, its mudflats rich with kaolinite and bentonite for pottery as well as magnesium and potassium for the body among other things necessary for the Initiates of the Jedi Academy he ran.
Steve thins his eyes at the insult. “Are you saying you’re too good for me?”
“Like I said: if you want my permission, consider it given. She’s all yours, winghead.”
“The piece-de-resistance, the leader of the whole shebang… his name is Iron Man. He’s a billionaire and a genius – no one is smarter than him – and he designs and builds all the Avengers’ tech and pays for everything and makes everyone look cooler. But he has a bad heart, which he fixed by becoming part cyborg.” Iron Man is his personal favorite, the very first superhero he had designed for his team. He has always been there for Tony, even when precious few others had been.
“If I were to purchase you from Priscus, would you like that?” he asks.
“I’m here for a 1:00 appointment with um… with Dr. Ferguson, please.”
“Sorry!” Steve shuts off the lights and slams the door shut.
He says as much only for Stark to grumble about how much trouble Steve has already proven to be and how it is possible that he might even lose money on this mission. He should have asked for more up front.
“Don’t go, Steve.”
“Perhaps… still I wish my lot did not include having to babysit the lanista’s new pet.”
Tony is momentarily shocked.
of failure?”
“I think I will survive the experience.”
Chapter title is from actual ancient Roman graffiti from Pompeii “Secundus felator rarus” which means “Secundus is a fellator of rare ability.” Oral sex was common but also particularly humiliating in Roman society. It was not something a husband would have expected from his wife and was usually performed by slaves. Accusing a man of cunnilingus was bad enough and often made the man an object of mockery, but accusing a man of performing fellatio on another man was one of the worst insults in Ancient Rome. While fellatio was seen as a laughable preference for men with performance issues, forced fellatio (irrumatio) was proof of virility and something to boast about.
Tony thinks frantically. He pushes back against the wall, trying to buck off Steve, but when that doesn’t work, he starts to cough around the fingers still in his mouth.
Tony makes a face. “How about I order pizza instead?”
They grow young so fast. It’s enough to inspire tears of pride in one’s eye.
Tony supposes he can understand that. Still–
“Still, you have to admit, it’s inconvenient for seemingly no reason. I don’t see how that’s any different than what the Order demands,” he reasons. “Except the Jedi have a reason to abstain.” No families, no attachments to distract from the meditative life and pure purpose of the Jedi, or at least that’s what the masters have always told them.
“You know when Roosevelt said ‘speak softly and carry a big stick,’ I don’t think he meant in your ass.”
But considering what Steve knows now… maybe it had been about him, but perhaps instead of the punishment he thought it was, Master Phillips had taken him off-world to protect him.
“Yeah. I was just wondering… are you coming home for Thanksgiving in a couple weeks?”
The door swings open to reveal Steve dressed to the nines in the tuxedo Tony had made for him for the event, his shirt pressed and starched and hair neatly combed and parted on the right. The man cleans up nice…
Tony steps away, outside the range of his pawing hands. “I think I’m good.”
Strike. Block.
“Are you lost, kid?” another freshman on his floor asks him when he moves into his single dorm.
“Suibne.”
But more than that, Tony wants Steve to be happy.
“Back in my day, a man was careful with his words. Using language like that is what’s tearing apart the moral fabric of this country.” Then again, getting a quickie marriage followed shortly after by an annulment isn’t exactly peak morality either, and yet here they are.
“Tony,” Steve says softly from the doorway. He’s still wearing his black suit, his hair neatly styled for the occasion as he crosses the room to stand near Tony as a warm presence at his elbow.
Steve steps into the dimly-lit warehouse, the others falling in step behind him with Bucky and Sam covering the rear position. It’s not long before they find the original inhabitants: Half a dozen long-dead corpses – men and women – strung up by extension cords attached to higher metal shelves on one end and looped around their necks, each of them with their legs buckled under them. They could have stood if they had wanted to live…
“We’re fine, Pepper!” Tony shouts back,” but we can use a little assistance with the exit.”
“It’s still me. It’s just… a different part of me. A different face I’m showing.”
“What? It’s not an insult; it’s envy,” Clint clarifies. “Anyway, six weeks thereabouts? Twenty bucks says it’s Channing Tatum. That kid is going to come out with a cocky glower, working class face, and dreamboat eyes, just you wait.”
“It’s not pity,” Tony tells him. Steve owns a mirror; he knows what he looks like. “I’ve always found you attractive. It’s just–”
“For all I know, you do look like me, but no one will ever have the opportunity to see it.”
Antony watches how Stefanus moves, the clench and strain of his muscles, the grit in his handsome face. “Do you know which ludus provided the entertainment for today?” he inquires. “I believe I just found my next bodyguard.”
There is one small snag, one tiny detail that Steve had obviously not considered. “Nazis are from like forty years ago,” Tony points out, unimpressed with Steve’s clumsy integration into his carefully-constructed, realistically-gritty superhero universe populated by random Lego minifigures stolen from various sets. Backstory is key after all.
“Okay, Steve.”
Here we go:
but Tony can’t help himself. “I was wondering… if you are interested, then I would be interested in providing the experience.”
Bucky comes to Steve’s defense. “Lay off him, okay? Stevie can not-kiss anybody he wants.”
as a full-fledged citizen. Anyone possessing even a passing familiarity with your earlier indiscretion can tell.”
“If we are to be family, we must learn to trust each other, Steven. So, until further notice, I will trust you not to harm my son, and as long as you can manage that task, nothing… untoward will befall you,” Dracula insinuates before making his threat more explicit. “Make him happy or else.”
“It does not. I am at your service.”
“Only two rooms available so two of you will be sharing,” he replies, eyeing Steve and Pepper behind Tony, “but one of them is the suite you requested. It was the best we could do, considering the last-minute booking.” He holds out the keys. “We can also accommodate you on the freighter shipping out next week, if you can wait.”
Master Phillips massages his temple as if to stave off a headache. “Right. And what about his size?”
“Don’t answer that,” Stark says, pressing the power button to cut off the transmission. “You think you and your friend are the only ones that know intergalactic standard? That could be anyone on the other side.”
“You’re mine Stark. Forever. No matter how hard you resist, you’ll never be free.”
on occasion, his dick encouraging him with a very soft
Rhodey had only sighed and pointed out the obvious, “I’m retired. You’re retired.”
“…And what of it? He is a slave–”
“What’s so funny?”
Uncle Obie handles a lot in the aftermath.
Steve takes a big sip of his friend’s Sprite in retaliation.
“Afghanistan?” she guesses before giving him a quick once-over. “You look a bit young to be a Gulf War vet.”
“But the sunglasses…”
“Tell me, Tiberius. Have your balls managed to drop again since last we met? It would be a shame if your future wife had to resort to sleeping with your concubinus to produce an heir,” Antony needles the man. “In fact, I suggest you find a concubinus who resembles you. Not only will no one question the paternity of your children, but you will be fulfilling your ultimate destiny to
Yeah, he will, because Steve is not leaving Tony alone to suffer Dr. Pym’s predatory clutches again.
Steve pulls them back out and holds Tony at arm’s length as he clutches his forearms. “Tony, stop. You don’t know what you’re do–”
Antony is generous to a fault, almost as if to compensate for the moral failing that is his obscene wealth. As he spends more time with the man, Stefanus begins to feel that Antony isn’t doing it to impress others so much as it is a compulsion, like it is the only way he believes he can please the people around him.
The implication is there, plain as day: If a dominus wouldn’t free his own son, if he would sell him to the ludus to be prostituted, to fight and die…
“We usually split chores.” Steve sits on the floral couch across from Dracula. “I wish to speak with you.”
“I’m your assistant. I’m supposed to assist you,” Steve had said before pointing out the obvious, “Plus, Finley actually speaks Arabic. If there’s a cave-in, which one of us is more likely to alert the proper authorities and send help?”
“I’m just saying this is a one-time thing.”
“You are most kind to allow me the opportunity. May I ask your terms?” Steve inquires carefully.
“…I can fix this,” Hadrianus says. “I can fix you.”
If Antony were to own him, Stefanus would never be free; perhaps he would even cease to want to be, content to be the envy of the villa, serving as nothing but a hard cock to please his Dominus and any he may deem to share him with. What if Antony grew weary of him? He doubts he would cast him aside, but it will always be a possibility so long as he remained subservient to him. Would he ever free Stefanus if doing so meant the end of their public relationship? Would he be a liability to Antony’s reputation and standing in the community then?
out of your system.”
“That’s because she knows I’m going to be the fun Dad. She’s smart like that.” She’s going to be trouble, Tony can already tell.
Already at the end of his patience with Steve’s many
“Guys, it’s really none of our business,” Cap declares, crossing his arms. “We shouldn’t speculate about the identity of the father.”
Antony cuts his hair, grows out what little facial hair he can, and returns to eating full meals. And when Tiberius takes up with another boy soon after – one he had expressly told Antony was just a friend in the waning days of their relationship – Antony tries not to care, but the rejection, the heartache still stings.
Instead of pushing him off entirely, the guy grabs his shoulders and holds him at arm’s length. “In high school?”
Steve’s reply is squirrelly, though Tony is too annoyed to notice. “What do you mean? Of course I like girls. Who doesn’t?”
Though he hadn’t actively sought an explanation, Stefanus does receive one in the form of a patrician, Tiberius Servilius Priscus Structus.
“What?”
“Word is he doesn’t want his bodyguard to split alliances between himself and Hadrianus’s rivals,” Bacchus had told him once he heard. “But Dominus thinks you must have bewitched him with your fine ass.”
Later, Tony tells himself it’s a fluke. They’d both been a little tipsy – Steve moreso than him, he thinks with a pang – but Steve didn’t seem to regret it come morning, and to his own surprise, neither did Tony.
“What you made us do.”
It’s as good an explanation as any.
immune– “But I’d feel better if we used protection.”
…But at least Tony finally understands the appeal of girls after they all sneak into
to be reassuring in the slightest.”
“What?”
“Language,” he says without skipping a beat.
Steve would offer to have the Jedi High Council reimburse Stark, but he’s not too sure how widespread the events of today are. Master Erskine had worried that there had been a snake in the Republic, possibly reaching high enough places to order him assassinated with Master Phillips marked for death next. Who’s to say other masters haven’t similarly been targeted at the same time? So instead he says, “I’ll get you your money, even if I have to pay it myself when I get my Knight’s commission.”
Steve buries his face in his hands, takes a deep breath, and pulls down, stretching out his face with a sigh. “Did you at least try talking to them?”
That’s not what his father says. Tony is a Stark after all, and as such, excellence runs in his veins. With his potential and pedigree, anything less than perfection is practically a moral failing.
He couldn’t, of course. For one, it would tank Stark Industries’ stock price, and however will his shareholders afford their private islands then? They may have to downsize their yachts to last year’s model, and wouldn’t that be a travesty? And two…
“Howard can suck eggs,” Tony says with more than a little heat. “I’ve already finished my bachelors, and I’ve only got a year left before I graduate my master’s program, while most people our age are still deciding between MIT and Harvard.”
Tony reclines back in his leather chair, tugs at the black tie still dangling from his neck and unfastens the top two buttons underneath. He then lifts his heavy tumbler, eyeing the half-inch of amber liquid still sloshing clumsily from side to side. It’s the very last of Howard’s scotch, his special stash Tony had never been allowed to touch or so much as look at…
Maybe then, Steve will find peace and a sense of belonging.
“Wine?” Priscus offers, holding out a small amphora, from which he pours out two cups, passing one to Antony on his side table. When Antony takes a sip, he continues, “I have many courting me for my endorsement. Did you attend the munera Barbatus commissioned yesterday? It was quite the show; very popular among your constituency. Many a politician have reserved my stable for their games as a… gift to the populace.” He settles back in his chair.
“Oh here we go,” he mumbles under his breath.
Cap tries to get the meeting back on track. “Right. So, if we could move on from the topic of Stark’s sex life…”
And with that, Hadrianus leaves, exiting the peristylium into the tablinum to sort out his affairs for the day.
Stark rises from his seat to stand behind Rogers. He strokes the man’s back, trying to calm the slight tremble reverberating through his body. “It’s going to be alright, Cap. It… It’s– just remember to breathe, okay?” He unbuckles his belt and pulls his half-hard dick out from the confines of his underwear as if he is simply using a public urinal. But there is a certain unspoken social etiquette to such situations, and so he looks over his shoulder to glare at Purple Man. “Are you going to watch the entire time?”
And so he resolutely crosses the hallway to the opposing wall and (while directly staring into Dr. Pym’s eyes) pulls the fire alarm. He then folds his arms and leans against the adjacent lockers to await his inevitable punishment.
And Steve hasn’t had a vacation in decades while Tony had just gotten back from a month-long sabbatical to his private chateau not five months prior.
He rolls his eyes. “No, about being free.”
“A: I have not been in love with him for years. Shut up. And B: I can like more than one guy at a time,” he spells out, digging into a particularly large reservoir of hot fudge. “So this guy, he’s been off limits because… um. Because…”
“Long live the King.”
Steve blinks, confusion clear on his face. “You don’t have to. I was serious. You wouldn’t have owed me anything even if I was right, and you definitely don’t owe me anything now when you’re not actually in danger.”
“I’ll be happy to get back to civilization. Maybe we can even get the laundry working on the ship,” Steve replies, itching at his robes, containing the musk and wet heat of several days. He had feared washing his clothing in the stream, afraid they’d never air dry in this humidity. Sweat was preferable to mildew after all. At least Rhodey is bringing an extra change of clothes. With Order 66 in place, Steve can’t go around wearing his robes anyway.
“Hey. You don’t make it big in weapons manufacturing without collecting a couple enemies along the way.” Tony had a certain reputation to uphold. There are limits to the level of infamy the Stark name could bear, and though it may seem petty, Tony drew the line at pizza. He has
“That is probably lodged

Open to all men who dare apply: Black, Irish, Chinese, etc. ALL-COMERS WELCOME.
Tony is devastated by his parents’ deaths. He spirals out of control, indulging in drugs, alcohol, and casual sex, and pushing his friends away even as Steve and Jarvis try to hold him together on the home front. It all comes to a head when Tony brings home a male one-night-stand, and Steve seems out of sorts about the development. Itching for a fight, Tony challenges Steve on his blatant homophobia, but that’s not it.
No. Steve is their only viable option, regardless of whatever Doc had to say in her final assessment. Depression. Insomnia. PTSD. Symptoms of maladjustment disorder, and whatever bullshit she could cook up to bench him. Steve is fine, perfectly peachy. And if he wasn’t… well, who wouldn’t be a little rattled in his position? But he’s no pansy. He’ll just walk it off like always, even if it was taking a little longer than ideal. After everything that happened with Jan, with Clint’s family and Loki and Natasha, he could use a–
Steve doesn’t drop his weapon. “You are a Mandalorian, a bounty hunter. How stupid do you think I am?”
He doesn’t miss the fear of failure, his anxiety over his own incompetence that Howard had long instilled in him. As an adult, Tony could compartmentalize and manage these feelings just fine, but they proved overwhelming for his smaller frame, so much so that he had to share the burden of them with
“Hmmm… how about a wager if you prove so eager?” The first orb nearly vibrates in excitement at the thought.
He thanks his best friend at the first opportunity.
“You’re looking at him,” Tony says, his affect flat. “Though Rhodey may have been having a little fun with the classifieds. He can be quite the jokester.”
“But when I’m older, what do you say?” he persists. “Do you use a pick-up line or is there some combination of–”
And now Steve pinks and sputters as Stark just laughs.
A pause.
Also, in regards to the prostitute, Julia: Prostitution was legal in Ancient Rome, but adultery was not. Most prostitutes were slaves or freedwomen (former slaves); however, some prominent women chose to register themselves as prostitutes to avoid being prosecuted for adultery. Julia has been married several times and no longer desires to be, and she registers as a prostitute (specifically a meretrix or high-class call girl as opposed to a lower-class prostitute, the price of the latter being about the same as a loaf of bread on the low end) to have control over her own life. Some prostitutes became very wealthy, but most were destitute and desperate. During the late Roman Republic/early Imperial time, meretices cross-dressed, wearing togas (outfit of a Roman free male) in bright colors as opposed to the stola of respectable free women. Prostitutes also often wore breast bands, even during sex.
But then Steve clamps his hand over his mouth. “You caught us. We were having sex.”
Tony has to give credit where credit is due. “Good call on leaving Pepper behind.”
Tony wonders if his luck will run out, but he has to know.
“That’s the spirit.” Steve’s face brightens as he claps Tony’s shoulders on either side. “Now, Thor has insta-roasted an entire side of beef for dinner, or flash-fried… whatever you consider cooking with lightning to be. It’s a little blackened and crispy on the outside and raw in the middle but not as bad as the pterodactyl from the victory feast. Less leathery.”
one weekend.
Steve couldn’t agree more.
He curses when two of his gunners are taken out in the effort, leaving him with one remaining and three opponents.
“No…” Steve lies.
Bacchus is not one to skirt the issue at hand. “What troubles you so?” he asks, digging into his own bowl.
“Sorry. Habit.”
It wasn’t until he was twelve that he realized Hadrianus was simply uncertain about whether he would lose Antony too, unwilling to emotionally invest in his son until he survived early childhood. But by then, it was far too late; Antony had built up his emotional walls until both he and his father were closed off to each other. Their relationship remained strained, tense, almost cold, and Antony liked to stress his father’s patience on many an occasion. It was one of the few ways he could hope to garner his attention if not his love.
He doesn’t want to be the father.
However, one of the few times Antony could reliably be counted on to behave was Parentalia when he and Hadrianus tolerated each other’s presence long enough to pay their respects to his dearly departed mother.
“Do you think me a newborn babe? I am not so gullible as to–”
Steve is about to take the opening to connect with Dracula under the guise of common interests when the vampire makes a sound of disgust. “A game for children. Grown men should not have a vested interest in such matters.”
Brave last words for someone within striking distance of Antony’s knees.
But no such luck.
Once the other retiarius is out of ear shot, Bacchus huddles closer. “You could have purchased a night’s worth of company instead,” he states, his voice low.
Pepper averts her eyes as well to glare at Tony who has since shut the door and made his way to his trunk, to pull out his outfit for the day.
Tony relaxes. “Really? That’s all you have to say?” He rolls his eyes, immediately annoyed. “Why do you always have to be like that?”
(1) Bruce is a man whose alter ego could theoretically go toe-to-toe with Cap himself, making him the best male option next to Thor, who had returned to Asgard and is thus unavailable.
Tony fidgets with the knot of his robe, trying to keep it together, to occupy himself as Rhodey approaches. His fuck-ups and general neediness has already driven away one friend; he can’t afford to lose another.
Steve doesn’t seem amused. “Yeah. About that. Why didn’t you tell anyone?”
“There is a lot he can do, Anthony,” Jarvis says, deadly serious. “What he
“If you are here to collect my head, then you won’t find me an easy target,” Steve proclaims, not dropping his guard. Clearly, the Mandalorian only meant to eliminate the competition, so he can collect his bounty in relative peace.
“Wow. I really don’t get how you used to have so many issues in the romance department back in the forties,” Tony deadpans. “Such a charmer.”
“Just a thought,” Tony says quickly, his hands up, palms out. “You can say no, and I’ll never breathe a word of this.” Like a man would want news of his rejections spread around, especially with Clint waiting in the eaves, ready to drop a joke at the slightest hint of embarrassing circumstance.
“I don’t need space.”
“Well yes, but you think me pretty.”
“Stay safe, Tones.”
“Great. Well, now is the time to put those to use. Use your Jedi powers or whatever to find us a water supply.”
“In the tombs of the builders of the pyramids,” Tony corrects him, “and it’s not real anyway. Just some words to deter people from grave-robbing back in the old days. Didn’t always work, and a lot of the thieves were acting on their successors’ behalf anyway.”
Steve resists the urge to roll his eyes at how pedantic his friend is being. “
The guy had just stared at him, his eyes traveling from Tony’s baby face to the beer in his hand. “…Not that it’s any of my business, but are you here for a campus visit? Where’s your host?” He surveys the party, trying to find the person responsible for Tony’s presence. “I know not everyone here is 21, but there are limits, man.”
Steve’s eyes narrow. “Master Phillips and I were assigned to this outpost.”
Nat pauses, then: “…I’ll take that action.”
“Too scared are you?” Dum Dum challenges him. “Lady Luck favors young Gabriel of late, and I would like to pit her goodwill for the man against her ire for Steve.”
Steve frowns. “You surely know how to make a man feel wanted.”
“Do you have any condoms?” he murmurs against his lips, his own length thrusting against Tony’s thigh as he moans. Tony had practically packed an entire pharmacy for their trip and had tried to encourage Steve to open their fake marriage. It wasn’t outside the realm of possibility he came prepared had Steve been amenable to the arrangement, though neither expected to use them
Steve would like to go back for Master Phillips just in case… in case what exactly? He knows he has passed in all likelihood, and his late master would be pissed if Steve risked his life for a corpse.
“No no no… it sounds like you’re in love with the guy,” Rhodey clarifies. He begins to giggle softly to himself at the idea.
But the stranger isn’t having it as he quickly frog-marches Tony towards the back fence. “Quiet.”
But then his thumb tips downward to the vocal displeasure of the crowd.
Oops; he must have said that part out loud.
Tony is frowning, his expression thoroughly annoyed. He doesn’t mince words. “No offense, Director Fury, but this might be your most harebrained scheme yet. I may have a brain tumor, but no one’s going to believe I’d be crazy enough to abscond with a random blond I just met.”
“And I think it’s past time we honor her.”
“Because once you say it, you can’t put the cat back in the bag, got it?” Rhodey says. “You tell him, and it’s out there, and you can’t take it back.”
Tony comes down an hour later, well after he assumes Cynthia has left the premises, only to find the woman in question in the breakfast nook, a third of an omelet growing cold in front of her while she talks animatedly to Steve.
“And horny,” Steve adds, further reasoning, “You don’t gotta play coy with me. The ad asked for a male assistant, and you routed any applicants through your man in Paris ‘stead of using your own name local. Far as I can tell, you’re not sick; you don’t actually need a caretaker, so I can only think of one reason why you’d ask for a male companion so discreetly.” The insinuation is clear as day. “And then fixin’ the sleepin’ arrangements so we’d end up in the same suite? Not ‘xactly subtle, you know.”
Suddenly, there’s another set of knocks from an adjacent wall, from the hallway where the instructors regularly patrolled. G-O / T-O / S-L-E-E-P / D-E-T-E-N-T-I-O-N / R-O-G-E-R-S
“Yes; he needs to mind his head and avoid Aemilius’s trident if he is to live,” his friend replies, betraying only a cursory interest in the development.
“…Alright.”
Steve doesn’t quite look at him when he says, “Speaking of, I was thinking… if you wanted, maybe it was time we did head home, you know? I know what you’re trying to do, and I appreciate the thought, but I don’t really take stock in running from my problems,” he hesitates for a beat before collecting himself. “So, uh… I think it might be time we head back.”
“What’s going on in Stark-tropolis?”
“I mean… Could you give me a little something to work with here?”
“…Let me put Tony to bed, and then we can discuss it.”
Tony shushes him. “It’s okay, honey. Come when you want,” he whispers, his tongue returning to his hole with broad licks over his entrance. He speeds up as well, until he dances at the edge of his own orgasm.
“As a matter of fact:
“May I have this dance?” Tony asks, holding out his hand to Steve after dinner on the fifth day, when the band has started to play some soft, warbling tune neither of them recognize.
“…What?” That made no sense. Ms. Sarah was much younger than Tony’s parents even; she couldn’t have been much more than forty.
“He’s talented.”
And so Stefanus offers, “Do you desire my ass tonight, Dominus?”
a child.”
“You will walk away and clear this ship for launch,” he repeats.
Can’t Cap see Tony is doing this for his own good? He’s trying to be noble, damn it. This is the one thing he can do for Steve to ease his burden, and here the man is trying to ruin it with good intentions.
There’s a beat of silence, and now his voice is cautious. “Tony, is that you?”
“It wasn’t worth it,” Stark insists. “You stripped us – all of us – of our free will, so we were nothing more than puppets.”
Steve looks away while rubbing the back of his neck. “Well, you see…”
“You do?”
His mother dies on a Tuesday when Tony is ten, six months after he had tried (and failed) to procure his father’s help. Towards the end, every breath had been a struggle as she wheezed and heaved and weakly coughed up entire daffodil blossoms, until one day, she couldn’t breathe at all and suffocated on the bloody bouquet sprouting from her lungs.
“That’s… What? That’s insane. I would never–”
Steve looks over first his right shoulder than his left. “You asking me?”
control issues?”
Tony isn’t selfish enough to actually out his friend, no matter how desperately he needs advice. “Anyways, I always thought nothing would ever come of it, because he’s… taken, you know? By a friend. But now my friend has moved on, and… and this guy may actually… like me back, but he thought I was straight and that I’m not really in the headspace right now to be making these decisions anyway,” he rambles on. “So. What should I do?”
Tony relents, his hips slowing, the grip on Steve’s neck going slack then sliding up to stroke his hair in apology. He dips forward, being sure to curl his chest inward and away as he kisses the man’s upper back and reaches around to pump his erection until both are spent.
“I’m not leaving you behind,” Steve insists, stubborn to the end.
“I don’t like who I am around you,” he says instead. And with that, he’s gone, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts.
“I don’t know, Tones. Even with the clothes, he’s not exactly inconspicuous,” he says when Steve exits the ship wearing the brightly colored pants and contrasting long shirt of the locals. Being on the outskirts of the Republic, this planet hadn’t experienced the explosion and thorough integration of migrants from other worlds that more-centrally located planets had, and someone as fair as Steve simply stuck out as an outsider, which to the locals usually meant a representative or ensign of the Republic. “He looks like a stormtrooper who lost his shell.”
Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.
Tony had made his excuses. “I just… I got a lot on my mind.” It wasn’t exactly a lie.
“What are you?”
“And the Saxons wished to not be impaled upon stakes while I dined below them,” he replies coolly. “Tell me, Steven. From where do your people hail?”
Tony holds out his arms. “Let me try.”
Two weeks to end war, to end famine, to crush any opposition to their all-consuming power. They provide free energy, security, and are working down the list towards social equality. Everyone is happy; everyone is safe in a purple haze of contentment and unquestioning loyalty to Emperor Stark and his right hand man, the power behind the throne.
This isn’t how Steve had wanted his first marriage to go. It’s already a farce, a cruel parody of what he could have had (like the rest of his life in this cursed future), but Director Fury had insisted the paperwork had to be real. Once their mission is over, Tony and he can get an annulment at the very least. That was the bright side of current social mores: Everything is disposable.
“No can do, Private First Class Dum Dum,” Tony says brightly. He waves at a gaggle of girls passing by. One of them, a striking redhead named Sunset, is younger than most, but at twenty, the graduate student is still two years his senior. They had had a passing flirtation Tony’s sophomore year until she realized just how young he was and told him to look her up when he turned eighteen. Tony had planned to, but by the time his birthday rolled around, he had heard disturbing rumors about how she had suckered that rube Justin Hammer out of some early prototypes. None of what she stole had been functional of course, but it was the thought that counted.
“Still didn’t touch it.”
Tony hasn’t contacted him since the failed booty-call a few months prior. Every time he thinks about it, he rubs the one-month sobriety chip in his pocket, stares hard at the phone, and runs all possible simulations of the outcome in his head. Steve had said to call him when he’s sober, but what if Steve is still angry? What if he never actually expected Tony to call?
He had wrinkled his nose around Steve even after he had washed up and was newly fitted with a uniform supplied by the Academy. “Ugh,” he had stage-whispered to another boy during their recreational hour in the open-air courtyard. “You can’t wash off the smell of failure. It just seeps out of him.”
Tony Stark, omega slut extraordinaire. Well, it stung a little.
He tosses the phone back to Tony, promptly turns around, and speed-walks back to their room, completely inured to the eyes and whispers of strangers, unable to so much as acknowledge them through the white noise in his own brain. Captain America was all he had left, and now, he’s not so sure he has that anymore. When it gets back to S.H.I.E.L.D. what he is, that he
“And yet here we are.” Tony closes his eyes, savoring the moment. “You love me.”
“The goat isn’t a pet. He’s just ethically raised.” Steve parks near the quaint two-story Victorian farmhouse, wipes his sweaty hands on his dark trousers, then allows himself a generous twenty seconds to collect himself before exiting the vehicle and walking to the other side to open Tony’s door. “Are you ready to have dinner with your father, sweetheart?”
“You’re drunk.”
Now that’s just lazy and most importantly, “It doesn’t fit into the Avengers universe at all!” Tony complains, utterly frustrated. He takes a deep breath, summoning the combined knowledge of eleven years of pre-K programming and after-school specials. Based on everything he’s ever seen on the topic, friendship is about compromise, and so he suggests, “Okay, how about this: He was frozen in a block of ice for like forty years, and the Avengers defrosted him and invited him to join the team. He agreed because he’s too
“Is that…”
“What do you think of this amphora?” Antony asks Stefanus at a stand selling antique décor the following week. The figures of a nude man and youth in the color of the original terracotta clay, presumably Zeus and his lover Ganymede, stand stark against a painted black background. “Is it not a fine example of old-world Greek pottery? And the subject matter…” Antony gives him a heated look.
Chase. Block. Strike.
Tony’s brow crinkles. “…What’s baloney?”
“Like…” He rolls his wrist, trying to think of the right word and settling on “Sweet. Jesus, Cap. If I wanted sweet, if I wanted conscientious and attentive, I would be fucking Pepper, but I’m not. So stop being such a pansy and pretending this is anything other than us letting off a little steam. Just be a man, and fuck me without all that lovey-dovey crap.”
“Because you’re one of us: a hero. Always have been,” Steve reiterates, “but that doesn’t mean you have to do it all alone or that you’ll never doubt yourself. We’re only human, and it happens to the best of us, but being a team means we can rely on each other to help pull us through.”
“Seventy-two degrees, J.” Tony orders the AI as he peeks out of his makeshift swaddle.
Hadrianus’s arm drops, and the match begins.
“It’s Antony.”
Steve doesn’t quite look at the other man as he admits, “No, of course not,” but in such a way that Tony immediately knows he’s hiding something.
Steve knows his boyfriend is nervous for tonight – he is too – but it’s starting to border on ridiculous. An outside observer would think Tony himself is the one meeting Steve’s parents instead of vice versa.
Thor nods his head in agreement. “Then I shall make sure his cup never runneth empty. He
“It has to be you, Stark,” Director Fury interjects. “You’re the bait, the brain behind the weapons they want; Captain Rogers is the muscle we’re sending to keep you safe and out of their hands. Need I remind you: we don’t need a repeat of Guatemala.” Tony’s face darkens at that but the man continues, “Besides, you’re no stranger to controversy. The press has already documented your many…
The situation isn’t ideal – Steve had had it all planned out; he had wanted to take Tony to Paris or maybe even the white villas of Santorini to pop the question – but he isn’t sure he’ll live that long. He has to know. “Tony–”
Sabina felas no belle fasces = Sabina you are sucking it, but not well.
A ludus purchases Stefanus from the flesh trade, training him to become a gladiator alongside fellow slave Bacchus.
Steven?”
“No, but it’s what you got, and we both have to work with the hand we were dealt.” Tony stands, heading towards the door. “I’m going on a booze cruise then to the Full Moon Party on the beach. You’re free to join me or mope in the room.”
“It’s an open invitation,” the man rages, looking down his nose at Tony after a spectacularly bad debrief. They’re alone in the conference room at Avengers’ Tower, and Tony is already counting all the furniture in the general vicinity as a loss. Pepper isn’t going to be happy. “Put on the suit; let’s go a few rounds. You and me.”
“It’s a good habit to cultivate. Wouldn’t want to slip up and call you ‘Cap.’ People will think there’s trouble in paradise.” Tony puts a finger to his chin, tapping his goatee in consideration. “Or maybe they’ll think that’s what I call you in bed.”
Priscus stands and extends his right hand for a shake. “Staius, it has been too long. I believe you were but a boy last I saw you.” His hand hovers around chest level. “Perhaps around this tall, and now look at you. How is Hadrianus? I hope he is well.”
“There isn’t much to tell,” Antony says, swirling the wine in his cup. “I tinker I suppose. My father is a senator – politics, you know – and I believe he wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but I find diplomacy exhausting. Give me stone and concrete over making love to the public any day of the week.”
Tony rolls with it. “In public? Where people can see us? You spoil me, Cap.”
The man has a point, though Tony is loath to admit it. “Okay, fine. I’ll take your
“Mamma?” Tony inquires as he peaks around the door of the master bathroom. “Mamma, are you okay?”
Steve looks dubious, but he doesn’t call Tony out on his transparent lie. “Oh-kay… so, um… what’s there to do around here?”
“Shhh…” he breathes, lips and tongue dancing along his tense back, his strong arms tightly locked over Steve’s chest. “Let me take care of you. You trust me to take care of you, don’t you?”
“What’s
And so he picks up Thor, imbuing him the deepest, most-authoritative voice he can manage, “Stop the engines, Iron Man! There is someone out there!”
“Yes. Now come on, say something.”
“There’s no way a hunk of gold can cure anything but poverty.”
“Rise and Shine. We’ve got an itinerary,” Steve says, turning on the room lights as Tony groans. “We need to maximize our time outside the villa so you can be approached by arms dealers. First up for today is…” He checks his notes. “Yoga and meditation.” So, some new age crap. Tony should like that.
his mother’s voice whispers.
And now Antony sounds deflated. “You hate it, don’t you?” He reaches out to take back the offending gift. “I’ll get you something else, something–”
“I cannot believe you,” Hadrianus fumes, his hand tight on Antony’s forearm to the point of bruising. “The crowd clearly desired the retiarius’s death, and you reprieve him instead. What have I told you about shirking popular opinion?”
Reminder that this story takes place from 1981 through roughly 1992, during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. People were terrified of catching HIV to the point where they avoided even casual contact with HIV-positive or potentially positive (e.g. gay male) individuals.
It is not the first time Steve misses Master Erskine. Master Erskine had been kind and (in retrospect) patient with Steve. He had believed in Steve’s potential and encouraged his growth and mental discipline over the years, ever since Steve had passed the Initiate Trials and was promptly selected by Master Erskine as his padawan.
“A gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell.” Steve mostly stuck to women. Though he was physically attracted to and had sex with both, he exclusively dated the fairer sex. They were soft in ways men often weren’t, seemingly more vulnerable even when tough as nails. Tony is like that in a way, though Steve suspected saying so out loud was one surefire way to simultaneously earn a black eye and quickly put an end to whatever this was developing between them.
Tony stops, his demeanor hurt, suddenly angry. “Oh, I get it. Yer too good to fuck Tony, is that it?”
It is a lovely service.
As the students mill between them all heading for the door, Dr. Pym approaches Steve.
“But…”
“My dick doesn’t have a helmet,” Stark states flatly.
Besides, with four to six weeks left to live and Steve in DC for most of the week, there are only so many opportunities for Tony to see the man before the inevitable comes to pass. There’s only so much time to make sure his death – the death of a friend perhaps – won’t affect Steve so much. He’ll mourn, but he’ll move on; that’s all Tony wants for him.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“It’s good for him. Can you imagine going through all that and being evicted on top of everything? At least he has a home.”
“Uh huh. Yeah, I do, and that wasn’t a promise.”
“He shouldn’t have asked about Natasha.”
But Steve just waves off his concern. “So he time-traveled or something. It’s not important. He’s the new hero in town, ready to punch bad guys, some of which are totally Nazis.”
Romulus snorts. “And you think that will fool Hadrianus?”
“I know; I know.”
“I’m just surprised you followed orders. For once,” Tony states flippantly. “I thought the strain would make you break out in hives.”
Disaster strikes two days later.
“Alright,” Antony agrees, his hand over Tiberius's. “I’ll do it.”
is a fairy, they’ll probably send him packing on a blue ticket. “Don’t ask; don’t tell,” and now that everyone knows…
For his part, Tony can’t stop thinking about it. Had Steve ever had anyone do that for him? Probably. War is hell, and men will do just about anything for a respite. Plus, Steve is uniquely attractive. Even given that, he likely has gone without for at least sixty-seven years. Tony has never seen him bring anyone home, and the only time he doesn’t sleep at the Tower is when he is on assignment for S.H.I.E.L.D. so that precluded overnight dates.
“You sit there and say you have nothing, when you have a chance to change, to adjust, to
Steve chews his bottom lip. “Well, if one or both of us die tomorrow, I don’t want to be left wondering what it would have been like.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve pauses. “Is that a challenge?”
“Coincidence and an overactive imagination. Humanity often sees patterns where there are none.”
Steve follows Tony out the front, stopping him just outside the main building. “Hey Stark… Tony! Wait up!”
“That would be a waste of a good outfit.”
They reach the garden center, a vulnerable fenced in area to the right of the building. It’s a touch rusted, but the fence has held. Inside are rows of dead plants, split bags of potting soil spilled over cracked cement and covered in weeds, as well as faded signs advertising sales, some hanging by one end on broken chains. The draped netting and plastic serving as a roof is ragged and torn, large swaths of it having fallen in to cover the rotted wooden pallets. The entrance into the building proper is similarly boarded up from the inside. Steve supposes that in the early days, the survivors foraged what they could from the garden center to build what he had scoped out on the rooftop, before they had to seal it off entirely to prevent being overrun by undead hordes.
Stefanus waits in the hypogeum, glancing every so often at Bacchus opposite him. The venationes featuring lions and panthers, bears and crocodiles, and other such exotic beasts had already made short work of the noxii, criminals sentenced to die in the games that very morning. Stefanus wonders if their fate is better or worse than those that went after during the ludi meridian, where the condemned may be dressed in the guise of Greek heroes in mythical re-enactments to deadly consequences. They had supped together the night before – the gladiators and noxii both – during what will be the last meal for many. If there is no honor in the gladiatorial matches themselves, there is less so in being ordered to set fire to a bound, unarmed man wearing a pitch-smeared tunica molesta in a facsimile of the immolation of Hercules. He knew many of his fellow gladiators agreed, at least on that front; a fair fight required skill, otherwise it was little more than callow murder.
Tony might have even been embarrassed had he still been capable of shame.
He reaches for the silicone-based lube in their shower caddy.
“Yeah. Yeah, I do. I can’t sit back and watch you destroy yourself. That doesn’t work for me, and I– I’m just no good for you either, okay? This arrangement isn’t helping either of us.” He reaches into his sock drawer.
That’s odd. It’s not like Steve knows many people from out of town. Come to think of it, even Sam stayed at the Tower last time he came up from DC.
Tony can’t quite put his finger on why he is so upset. Perhaps it’s disappointment that Steve is the same as any other boy, that maybe there’s something broken in Tony that he can’t muster up the same enthusiasm at the prospect of kissing girls. It just didn’t seem hygienic is all.
Stefanus is on high alert when Antony’s back stills and straightens, the hair on his arms standing on end, as if he has been struck by lightning, but he tries for casual. “Servilius.”
“Your hair is so lovely; you should grow it out.”
“I’m only in town for a few days, and I’d love to catch up this weekend. Maybe over dessert?”
she had said.
His father bristles. “Any brutish caveman can wave a cudgel.”
“Obviously,” Steve repeats, hooking his arm around a clone to swing and take him down while sweeping another one off his feet and stabbing him through. He rolls onto his feet back into a fighting stance, his lightsaber drawn as he arcs it in a figure-8 to block more enemy fire.
Tony can practically see the gears turning in the man’s head as Cap does the math and his face goes from angry to… Tony doesn’t even know the word for that expression. Surprised? Nervous?
For approximately fifteen seconds.
“So… you think you can make it back to the City this weekend?” he finishes.
Antony rents him again a few days later, ostensibly to be his bodyguard at yet another party where he hobnobs with the elite set, his cup languidly held up for more wine as he talks to other members of his class. He doesn’t acknowledge the slave girl refreshing his drink nor the boy at his arm as he regales his friends with some implausibly bawdy tale of a man and a well-endowed mule, but he glances at Stefanus from time to time with a hunger that cannot be sated by the plentiful spread of food before him.
“I’ll fix up the engine, and you…” Stark sorts through the pile of debris Rhodey had collected for him using the list he had transmitted the week prior. He pulls out a twin pair of rounded flat-bottom plastic, flipping it right side up. “You can add on the cupholders.”
“Tony! Tony, stay with me!” Steve is freaking out, trying to drag Tony into the bathroom. Tony is burning up and his breathing is shallow, his putrid sick staining his favorite shirt. Tony tries to re-orient, but he’s uncertain why he can’t make the room stop spinning.
“That’s my man.”
And so, Master Erskine appraises the child, noting his sickly countenance and sunken cheeks as well as the sharp shoulders sticking out from under his scratchy burlap shift. Steven fidgets under the attention, until Master Erskine finally breaks the ice. “I saw you earlier… outside. Why did you attack your friend?” he inquires bluntly, getting straight to the point.
“Dad!”
“My apologies, great ones. I sincerely regret my actions and those of my compatriots here; it was grave folly and our own ignorance what brought us here.”
Stark sucks in a halting breath and starts to sweat, but he stays silent.
“You are not team leader. Director Fury barely let you join up as it is,” he points out. “What was it again? Compulsive behavior. Prone to self-destructive tendencies. Textbook narcissism. It goes a long way towards explaining your insubordination.”
“That’s not right.”
“No. It’s not.”
Tony’s expression is unreadable before it shifts to a sort of glibness that seemed to be his default whenever Steve was trying to be serious. “Well darling, have you packed your footlocker with the essentials for the honeymoon or should I have a barrel of lube delivered directly to our suite? I assume we can forgo the condoms now that we’re hitched.”
Still, this was a mistake. Tony had already been down this route with his last assistant Gialetta, and see how well that had turned out. She had even used Tony’s trust, their intimacy, to deduce his secret condition and had exploited her knowledge of his damaged heart…
But the man drones on. “You know, Finley was a good choice. She’s gorgeous – a good misdirect as any I’ve seen to date – but there’s no way her roommate Julie is just her roommate. I mean… they live together, but…” He gives a one-shoulder shrug before he reaches forward, his fingers fumbling for Tony’s button fly. “Need help gettin’ out’a those?”
Suibne sighs, cradles his bowl in one arm and hooks a thumb at himself. “Suibne.”
“And if you are to die, then die with honor as Aemilius did.”
Steve tears a cupholder from the dislodged table – it comes off cleanly, having not been bolted on very well or competently – and jams it into the seam between the man’s helmet and chest plate for an effective throat punch. He then springs onto his haunches, grabs his lightsaber from below, and slices it across the stormtrooper as Stark blasts another and then the third near the door.
Steve doesn’t see it that way. “There are so many people who care about you, who rely on you, and you’re not even going to try? Really?” he’s flabbergasted, borderline horrified. “For all you know, they feel the same way. You don’t have to literally die of embarrassment!”
Steve considers it. He knew not how to sew, but he did have experience with stinging nettles during a few unfortunate encounters in childhood. “Will the shirts not wilt before they can be finished?”
Steve frowns, his brow knitting together. “Why? You need to bum a couple pills off me?”
“Understood.”
Steve sighs. “You could at least try it.”
“You’re just scared you’ll like it.”
Stefanus does grow. Whether due to hearty food, exercise, or simply by virtue of a late growth spurt or some combination of the above, he lengthens and fills out until Fidelis decides he is large enough and strong enough to train as a full-fledged retiarius wearing the loincloth, galerus, and manica of his brethren. His enhanced musculature has other advantages as well. Priscus loses sexual interest in him once he outgrows his boyish proportions with the toga praetexta looking all the more ridiculous on his adult frame. That doesn’t stop his dominus from prostituting him out for more discreet liaisons with men of less socially-acceptable taste. Though it is Stefanus’s understanding that a healthy Roman man does not lust after other adult men, his clientele doesn’t decrease as he matures past his youthful prime though the interested parties do change. Most prefer his mouth, but his ass remains fairly popular despite his undesirable body hair.
“Pleased to make your acquaintance, miss,” Tony says, but from behind his sunglasses, his eyes flit around her to catch a glimpse of Steven.
“But effective,” Steve counters, leaning closer to his opponent as Tony looks between the two.
“I’m giving you space.”
“You take care of a lot of people?”
And so by the time Jarvis picks them up to return home, Tony is short with Steve, giving him one- or two-word answers to every avenue of conversation Steve attempts, and the minute Jarvis parks, he stomps through the front doors and up to his room to sulk, rudely ignoring Ms. Sarah’s “Did you boys have fun?” and leaving a bewildered Steve behind.
They hear the roar of the crowd, the shouts and stomping in the stands signifying the end of yet another fight.
“I would like to sleep alone tonight, my friend.”
Bucky gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder, letting the contact linger a touch longer than necessary. “The thing is, you don’t have to. I’m with you to the end of the line, pal.”
“You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that’s true, you’ll be a great man some day.”
Steve’s fingers hook at the corner of his mouth, stretching his jaw as he drapes himself over Tony’s back, pushing him harder against the wall. His hips move erratically, nearly unbalancing Tony with his desperate thrusts. He’s close; Tony can tell, and when he finally comes, he spills deep inside Tony, his body becoming rigid and motions stilling as he mouths at the back of Tony’s neck. Tony’s hand slows as well, his dick still heavy and unsatisfied.
,” Steve announces as he stands.
“Yeah.” Steve sits on the chair closest to his bed, his fingers interlacing with Tony’s, careful of his IV.
“My father.”
“…I guess that checks out,” Jacques concedes. “Giselle
“Cap–”
Pusio: “Boy” or “Lad” with a sexually demeaning connotation.
Steve holds up his paper. “It makes him faster. He’s super strong and super fast and can heal real well because he’s invulnerable, you see, and–”
“What are you talking about? Sam is right there.” Steve hooks a thumb back to where Natasha, Clint, and the man in question lie in wait. What is Sam then? Chopped liver?
Take two:
Stefanus doesn’t take the bait. “I don’t understand the question.” It’s a trap; it has to be. He must know Stefanus has other clients, but men are good at telling themselves lies, at constructing little fantasies where they are your one and only, the best you’ve ever had. Antony must be upset at that the shattering of that illusion.
Steve sighs. It can’t get more humiliating than this.
“It is, just for a very specific type of guest.”
Aemilius is dead, and Stefanus isn’t.
“No, uh… Gabe, he’s um… he’s African American.”
“What’s the status, J?” Tony says, the gantry still whirring about removing his armor. He stands still for the scan, holding his breath for the AI’s verdict. He should have seen the hit coming. He should have protected his core. He should have–
Well, one thing’s for sure. It’s definitely not Black Widow. Tony had been flirting with Nat since the start of the school year, and she always turned him down. If anything had happened, Tony would be floating on cloud nine for weeks, Steve can admit to himself with a small pang of jealousy.
Tony doesn’t even flinch. “I told you it’s easier than the VCR. It will find and automatically record ‘Days of Our Lives’ at its new time slot,” he points out. “You won’t even need to record over your old tape. It’s so old that the tracking has deteriorated anyway.”
Steve covers his face in both hands, too embarrassed to say anything further.
“The photo’s real, isn’t it?”
“Bucky!”
“What
Tony places a hand over Steve’s and drops his voice low, his tone almost sultry. “I can think of a different arrangement.”
“Yeah, man. Why’d you think I came over? She was giving me ‘help me’ eyes, and I thought I’d run interference.”
“Depends; you finally dropping that boy scout routine? I know you have it in you. You don’t make it through a war like that unscathed.” Tony scratches his blunted nails across Cap’s flawless skin. “You don’t have scars – I’ve seen every inch of you to know that – but not all wounds are skin-deep, and I like to pick at scabs.”
Steve meets the vampire’s eye. “Blunt force trama.”
“That sounds like a challenge.”
“You don’t get better for him. You do it for yourself, and if he happens to be standing there at the end of it all, then you figure that part out later.” Rhodey slips him a folded sheet of paper where he had handwritten a list of names and phone numbers. “I think one of these people can really help you. They’re good, you know. Professionals.”
“Listen here, Tony. I–” he stops, the scene before him giving him pause, because there is Tony, keeled over and hugging the white porcelain of the toilet, heaving into the basin.
Steve is ill at ease. There is something wrong here; he can feel it deep in his bones, though he is uncertain of the source. The woods are darker in the underbrush, the canopy becoming thick enough to blot out the sun.
Tony isn’t sure why. Carol sounds great. An ambitious ace pilot with a bright future in the Air Force; what more can Rhodey’s parents ask for? “I’m sure they’ll love her–”
“What?”
So Tony tries again. “Come with me if you want to live?”
Antony leans in close, his breath a whisper against Stefanus’s lips, “It would be my pleasure.”
In this story, Howard’s name is Marcus Staius Hadrianus, but he is popularly addressed as Hadrianus. Antonius Staius (Antony) is his only child. In real life, the Staia gens were a plebian (commoner) family in Ancient Rome. After the Conflict of Orders, the power of the patricians (aristocrats) declined, allowing plebians into government. Plebian senators were just as rich as their patrician counterparts (or sometimes more so) but were of a lower class, and there was no way for a plebian to rise to the level of a patrician, but in the later Roman period, they could marry into the patrician class and their children would become patricians. Essentially, Howard is extremely wealthy and has a seat in the Senate, but he’s new money, and he really wants Tony to marry up. Tony is not having that.
Stefanus’s breath is short and erratic, his heart pounding, exacerbated by a sense of heightened alertness coursing through his veins and the sun baking him inside a shell of heavy linen and scaled metal. He can feel the aching strain of his muscles, smell the musky sweat and blood of other men and beasts that had fought and died before them on these very sands.
Steve breathes out slow, then: “Let’s just go to dinner.”
When he believes he has collected enough dry wood, Steve traces his footsteps back to their campsite, but upon entering the clearing, he finds nothing but their bundled belongings and a smoking fire pit, still warm from earlier.
“What you always wanted to do,” he corrects him. “Why lie to yourself? It was a team effort. The desire was in you. I just facilitated it. You’re welcome, by the by.”
Steve isn’t blind. He can see Tony is an attractive (if utterly annoying) man, but sometimes… Sometimes he wondered if Tony’s company wouldn’t be more pleasant if he couldn’t talk around Steve’s dick stuffed in his mouth. And if Steve had gotten off to the fantasy early that morning after a fifteen-minute catnap due to Tony’s frequent tossing, well… He isn’t proud of it – it crossed all sorts of professional and moral lines – but it is what it is. He needs
After a short conversation with the director of the group home during which he had expressed interest in adopting the troublesome child, Master Erskine sits down for a meet and greet with the prospective pupil. The boy sits across from him, still out of sorts and a touch surly, rubbing at his reddened ear. He looks resigned, as if he knows he will not be selected for adoption but is still required to go through the motions.
There is something wrong with them, with each clone having been compromised at exactly the same moment to turn on Steve and Master Phillips.
Steve lifts a brow. “This only happens if we cannot find a Jedi enclave on Tython,” he reminds him.
The shield Tony gifts Steve is based on the Wandsworth Shield, a round Celtic bronze shield from the Iron Age. Yes, it might have been part of a larger oblong shield, but let’s pretend it’s not, okay?
Steve rolls his eyes. “Come on. Get up.”
“What? If you want to survive your first bout, then you’ve got to learn.”
Tony feels Steve’s large hand on his head, stroking his hair, teasing out locks here and there as he chants Tony’s name, tells him how good he is, how much he’d like to return the favor someday, if Tony would teach him. Tony starts to stroke his own erection, spreading his pre-cum over himself to make the glide easier, as he listens to the breathy praise. He breaks away, blowing on Steve’s quivering hole before licking his taint and softly brushing his facial hair against Steve’s thigh.
His disbelief is rather satisfying to Tony’s ear.
They dine under a canopy with white gauzy curtains draped over the crossbeams and a walkway lit by ground-level torches lighting the way. The water is serene and reflecting the last remnants of sunset, pink and orange over a deep blue. The entire scene is intimate, romantic…
“What if I can’t next time?”
“Damn it.”
“You ever…” but Tony stops. He’s not sure he wants to know if Steve has broken it in yet in the carnal sense, if he has moved on after all.
Or maybe the simpler explanation is that Steve is simply a decent guy trying to take the sting out of rejection.
“Fucking vultures… I can’t believe they’d go this far,” Tony is saying, even as Steve’s whole world crashes down.
“Hey Cap… why the long face?”
And so by the time Steve knocks and enters Tony’s room bearing the traditional hangover cure of orange and ginger, his mystery visitor is long gone, and Tony breathes easier feeling secure in the knowledge that his secret is safe.
And now it’s too late. Talk about being the world’s leading authority on waiting too damn long.
“Of course I’ve forgiven you. I’ve always…” there’s another sigh over the line. “I’ll always care about you, Tony. You’d have to do a hell of a lot more than that to push me away.”
Tony peaks his head out from the open door of his dorm, his eyes bleary and hair wild. He’d been up for days putting the finishing touches on his robotics final: a low-cost device to detect and neutralize noxious fumes for use in coal mines and other tight, airless spaces, but the little guy had been beside himself over piles of dirty laundry and half-eaten boxes of rotting Chinese takeout, circling ground zero and attempting to remove the biohazard to a relatively-safe distance in the far corner.
“You seemed close.”
man would have saved Mom,” he elaborates, his tone venomous, emboldened by the liquor.
“Is that what girls looks like under… you know?” Jimmy whispers, reverently.
“They would have sabotaged our ship in the hangar, obviously.” Master Phillips cuts down another two and telekinetically throws a third into a stone column.
“You have two minutes.”
“This might surprise you, but I do not think of you much at all if I can help it.”
Steve turns to face Tony, almost grief-stricken that one of his best friends turned out to be a filthy degenerate. “I just want you to be safe.”
Stefanus braces himself against the feather-stuffed mattress, his hands fisted in the fine woolen bedsheets, as the man hovering over him thrusts roughly into him from behind, either unaware of uncaring of his partner’s pleasure (or lack thereof). He leans over, his slight paunch squished against Stefanus’s ass, as he kisses the base of his neck and reaches around to paw at his chest, squeezing much too hard for it to be pleasurable. Stefanus winces; he grunts but doesn’t say anything. After all, the man isn’t paying him (or rather his dominus) to talk.
And so it is that by the third day, Steve has had it. Between the traveling and Tony’s nightly wriggling, he hasn’t had a good quality sleep in days. He’s cranky, tired, and Tony continues to tax his limited patience while offering no respite from his presence. Steve’s normal avenue of stress relief – he looks a touch too hard at a gaggle of sun-kissed tourists – is unavailable to him. He’s
“It will be but a moment.” Antony retrieves a large soft leather case before passing it to Stefanus. “I had Proserpina acquire it from a merchant specializing in unusual imports from the north.”
“You don’t have to humor me.”
“Didn’t take you for a smoker,” she comments as she lays back and taps the end of her cigarette into an ashtray on the nearest nightstand.
“What?” They all reply in unison.
He’s sitting in the game room, quietly playing with his Avengers’ Lego set. Captain America and Iron Man had had a fight – an ideological disagreement leading to a Civil War of sorts that had split the Avengers into two camps – and Tony didn’t know how to resolve it, how to bring them back together.
“You don’t have to go, Cap, and this?” he points between the two of them. “This here can stay between us. The one-eyed wonder doesn’t have to know everything.” It’s an unexpected – if not exactly unwanted – development, and Tony would like to see where this goes, if the man is similarly open to the notion.
Like a little danger has
Neither of them had wanted to step down from the survey team, and as the de facto leader of the so-called Avengers, Steve hadn’t forced the issue. Not that he would have had a leg to stand on, having approved Tony’s recruitment to their group shortly after they became an item. He still drew the line at Bruce and Laura, though; there are limits after all. Sam and Bucky had long proven they can take care of themselves, but those two would be liabilities on the road.
“So?”
“Still can’t believe with a face like that, you’ve never been with anyone,” Stark is saying once again as reclines against a tree trunk, watching Steve practice his forms. “Never even been tempted, huh?”
He straps on the shield, sliding into a defensive stance. “J.A.R.V.I.S.? Resume the training session.”
“It’s a date.”
Should he have rented a cape, or would that have been patronizing?
“Dad! Really?” Tony’s eyes are large as saucers.
“We’re just friends. And is this really appropriate conversation right now?” Tony asks, eyes not-so-subtly flitting to Steve who is sitting right there, clearly visible and in his father’s line of sight.
He shifts uncomfortably in his chains, the manacles large over his skinny wrists as his hands try to cover his manhood out of what little sense of modesty remained since his capture. His fair hair, the color of wheat, had grown long and slightly wavy during the journey to this place and is now flattened under a cap, the only stitch of clothing he is allowed. He had earned it when he had attacked a slaver, nearly gouging an eye out when the man had tried…
Steve is hit from behind, but the blow barely stuns him as he recovers, flips over, and charges towards his assailants, taking out the first one with a well-placed one-two punch then the second with a sharp elbow to the face. Another tries to jump on his back while a fourth places a vibranium cuff on one wrist, only for Steve to use the loose end to bash him across the nose, breaking it in a gush of blood before kicking him across the sand. He then reaches for the one on his back, flipping him over in front of him and placing him in a headlock. The man kicks out, trying to claw at his grip and free himself as Steve turns to where the woman had been sitting, only to find she had disappeared.
“Okay well… have a good night,” Tony says, giving Steve a small wave. It was worth a shot anyway.
So, he wasn’t going to win any popularity contests. And dating? Well, he could forget all about that. If no one wanted to be friends with the child prodigy, fewer still wanted to date him. It didn’t help his case that it is also illegal, at least until he turned sixteen the following May.
It’s Tony’s ninth birthday, and that means his father is leaving soon for his annual summer sojourn to the Arctic on a quest to recover an American icon.
Steve’s hand darts out, grabbing the phone to end the call before Pepper can pick up.
to the state instead of sucking at its teat of tax breaks and subsidies.” And with that, they both walk off in the direction of the Staius villa.
“See? Teamwork! Never fails.”
Steve helps where he can, mostly smaller projects on the interior that have nothing to do with essential systems for survival or basic functionality. It would be a shame to exit the atmosphere only to find out that their radiation shielding is insufficient or that he had inadvertently punched a hole in the hull allowing air to escape as signaled by a deadly, high-pitched whistle.
…He really should have at least glanced at Stefanus’s cock.
Stark is still shaking his head, his blood now flooding over his beskar chest plate and pooling on the ground behind.
“Name?”
Bacchus seems to have come to the same conclusion. “Staius likes you. He likes you a lot. For now. If he offers… if you have a chance to escape Priscus’s servitude, you should take it. Life in a villa, especially one so well outfitted, isn’t so bad, and a concubinus’s station is quite envious amongst that lot. At least until Staius marries, and then what happens after… it’s a few years out of the ludus anyway. You could learn a trade in the meantime and become indispensable to the household or be sold to the state to record taxes paid or whatnot.”
“And what?” Steve asks. “What does it say?”
“…How about you not?”
Perhaps Tony is a hypocrite after all because he lies through his teeth. “I… I– um, I have.”
Steve lifts a brow. “No offense, but how do I know you won’t try to off me in my sleep?”
