“Steve? Why are the lights off? Are you doing some strange art thi-” Tony cut off as he came into the kitchen, seeing Steve standing there holding the chair out for him.

“After reviewing all your departments closely these last 5 days, James and I have come up with plans for each of your departments on where to make these slashes,” Tony says as Rhodes hands out a file to every department head. “We know that it seems harsh, but it is necessary to keep your town afloat. If you have any comments to make about our master plan, you can schedule a meeting with James and I,” Tony says before he and Rhodes leave.

Now it’s been a few years and they were adults, with their own adult apartment, working at their adult jobs but God help him if he still didn’t feel like that 19 year old who stumbled over his own words when that tiny 18 year old had looked up at him and beamed.
Steve stops having his nightmares after Tony buys him a new bed sheet set, simply waking up and forgetting whatever his subconscious cooked up.
Tony is drinking the last dregs of wine in his glass so Steve gives the server a small nod. He watches her disappear through the door, swinging closed behind her but not before Steve sees all the staff huddling around the chef.
Tony grins at them from where he’s leaning against the doorframe.
Steve turns, a sheepish smile on his face as he stretches out his hand, “Apologies Mr. Rhodes, I just uh, got a little excited and wanted to pitch an idea.”
A day where nothing bad

“You asked me what I was still doing here last night! And since you can’t wait for me to get out of town I thought I might as well get to it ASAP,” Tony says, voice rising causing Steve to wince.
But today is definitely not the day to ask so they continue to watch/argue and in the morning before Tony wakes up, he cleans up the rose petals from the table and floor.

“I wanna hear what they have to say,” Steve says, watching the newscaster show a montage of the battle yesterday.
“S-Steve? Ohmygod, Steve!” He yells, jumping up to crash into him and they nearly go skidding off the roof.
Yeah, Steve knows he’s grinning right now, but really — who could blame him?
Tony makes it up to him by licking up all the frosting though.
“Well, when you figure out how to do that, why don’t you let me know so we can all go plant flowers in the parks and read to the woodland creatures,” Tony says, voice mocking before starting to walk off.

Rhodes steps out into the hallway, on his way to the meeting with the City Planning Department, information that has been awarded because Steve had called specifically to ask whether Rhodes would be available at this time and was told no, he would not to which Steve then asked if Tony would be around and was told yes, he would be.

The price of the ring was absolutely ridiculous and the black velvet box it came in seemed so plain considering what it was carrying which might as well be Steve’s whole future, but it was perfect.
One of the boxes tumbles over and papers go flying out.
He points towards a door behind Rhodes’ desk. “That room there? That’s where all the files from all the departments are kept, filled with expenditures from the last 5 years as well as proposed projects. There are 7 entire boxes stacked with files from your department alone, with Rogers as the head of every proposal we’ve read through so far.”
“Now who am I to argue with signs like that?” Steve says, pulling the covers over them, their conversation drifting off with the waning moon.
Carol sees him coming and beams, the both of them immediately engaging in an animated conversation.
Steve winces and thinks,
there are canvases all over, only a few blank - the others are filled with gorgeous landscapes and Steve clearly has a partiality for the sunsets, though Tony does spot some glaciers and meadows around.
“Like I said, nothing is ruined. Look over there huh,” Steve points over to where Natasha, Clint and Bruce are.
“How did you and Sam meet?” is what Tony asks.
but still necessary. “So you must find his sunset videos extremely satisfying,” Tony says, pointing to all the canvases lining the wall.
“I know,” he sighs, staring out the window at the setting sun in Oslo. “Just a few more months.”
in his voice, in every step he takes as he shows Steve around his favourite places he’d visit in the summers with his mother.
“Our investigation has shown us that things here in SHIELD are far worse than we were led to believe,” Rhodes says before gesturing at Tony to continue.
Bruce is swaying heavily against Thor and he looks a little green in the face but he’s hissing, “I’m gonna smash Steve into tiny pieces! How can he hurt Tony who is so small and must be protected and- baby, babe,” he says turning to Thor, “you’ll help me smash Steve right? You’ll protect me?”
Steve can’t even think of anything to say to that because he’s watching Tony’s feet swing slightly because they’re nowhere near the ground and before he can stop it, “God, you're tiny.”

Steve grins back at him before placing Morgan onto his shoulders and yelling, “Alright, let’s see who can hug Dad the fastest!”
He squints at the camera against the morning sun shining through the courtyard, “I’m not that worried. Everyone here in the parks department is an important member of the team and absolutely needed.”
Bucky shrugs, “I’ve had my time to deal with. Sam helps a lot. Stevie too. Plus I’ve got this kickass metal arm so it could be worse. Don’t cry over it gorgeous, I’m happy as I can be. Scouts honor.”
Steve and Tony both separate to talk to all the different vendors and offer their help if needed.
Steve looks around at them, this group of chaos he gets to call family - albeit, with a missing piece,- smiles softly to himself before dusting off the sand clinging to his jeans and heads to the shoreline.
Tony throws it on then settles onto Steve’s lap before stamping his face with kisses.
Tony isn’t sure how much quiet Bruce gets whenever Thor is in there with him, but he’s never kicked him out.
“Nope, we all know it wasn’t you Rogers. You don’t even drink coffee,” Natasha says.
By Steve’s last count, Bucky’s changed his recipe 3 times to appeal to Tony’s taste but Tony is

Tony drops the pen onto his desk and pinches the bridge of his nose. “I really need a cup of coffee to get through this conversation right now,” he sighs. “Look, I can’t fire you either. Your rigidity over expenses shows the balance you bring to your department, especially over Rogers’ many many proposals over the years.”
“And why are you exempt from this Barton? As an absolute disaster of a person, it’s highly likely you broke it,” Natasha says.
“Thor, I know,” Steve cuts in, hoping he doesn’t sound as bitter as he feels.
He just watches and laughs at Tony antics as they enter the diner and wishes he could hold Tony’s hand as they walk.
“Of course I made it,” Tony says, punching Steve lightly on the arm. “I wasn’t about to miss your birthday, old man!”
Holy fuck, Steve’s really an idiot.
“You’re being dumb,” Sam says. “Just talk to him man. What’s the worst that could happen?”

“I’m still eating that tiramisu but you better wipe down that ring before putting it on my finger,” Tony tells him, and Steve dutifully wipes the ring down with the cloth the jeweller provided him with.
“Hey, baby,” Steve says, picking up his keys. “Didn’t see you there.”
“I didn’t, but thank you for confirming my suspicions.”

- when the door opens at 10.28pm and the argument that had been brewing on the tip of his tongue dies.
Tony turned over reluctantly, eyeing Steve warily. Steve gave him a small, grateful smile. "Tony, the team and I were wrong." Tony's eyes widened in shock. Steve continued, "I know you think this is your fault but it's really ours. We didn't care enough to worry about your feelings and that was wrong. Tony, tell me the truth. Weren't you ever a little angry at how we treated you?"
After the movie, Tony quickly fled to his bedroom, feeling lost and confused. The team had appreciated his presence there, it was pretty obvious, what he didn't know was why. He was worthless, pathetic, and didn't deserve the trust or respect of his teammates so why did they keep looking at him as if they cared?
Everyone stood, shocked at what Bruce had just revealed. But, Tony was the most surprised. Bruce cared about him? Tony self-consciously tugged on the long sleeves of his black shirt, feeling nervous. He didn't know what to say. And it scared him.
Jarvis stayed silent. Tony sighed and walked out of the bathroom. He strolled over to his desk and fiddled with a screwdriver. He began to think of an excuse for everything that had happened in the past few days. He didn't want the others to treat him differently. He wouldn't know how to handle it. Before he could continue pondering, Jarvis said, "Sir, Mr. Rogers is requesting access."
Tony shook his head and laughed harshly. "No. No, you're not. Look, what do you guys want? New suit upgrades? Bigger rooms? M-money?"
"I am programmed to-"
"He only self-harms right? Nothing else to be worried about?" Clint asked slowly.
He helped Clint out of the Quinjet and then he told Natasha, " Take Clint to medical, I'm gonna go find Tony."
Steve's smile widened and he whispered, "Of course."
Clint eye's widened. "No way... Tony? No way! He... He... why would he do something like that?"
Natasha sighed. "Suit yourself."
Tony gave a salute and flew back to the sidewalk, trying to spot the villain. He was no where to be found. Jarvis was frantically yelling at Tony to turn his coms on and when Tony did, all hell broke loose.
Natasha nodded, and went back to watching the movie, but Tony knew she was keeping her eye on him. He grabbed a small slice, and started to dizzy as he held the slice in his hand. It was so greasy but smelled so good... He slowly took a bite and chewed, and the next thing he knew, the slice was gone in a minute. He grabbed another one, and then another one, and then he grabbed so many that his stomach could no longer take anymore. The hunger that he had been feeling for a few days was satisfied, so why did he feel so dirty?
Natasha only shook her head, and muttered something to herself in Russian. Tony glanced at Bruce, who had been silent the whole time. He definitely missed his science bro, but he was afraid of confronting him, sure that Bruce thought of him differently now. In fact, that's how he felt about the whole team. Sure, it was annoying that they never seemed to care if he was dead or alive, but he never wanted them to get to see past his masks. He didn't want them to know so much about him. Now, they knew just how much of a fuck-up he was. Steve, seeming to hear his self-deprecating thoughts, told him softly, "Tony we're so sorry. We really misjudged you."
in his head. He glared down at the table and quickly stood up, walking into the bathroom.
Tony had turned to them when they walked in, and was frozen, his sleeves pulled up and a razor touching his skin, ready to impale the surface. Steve noticed that he already has some scars on his arm, showing that he had come too late. On Tony's face was a look of pure shame. His cheeks were flushed, and his eyes were wet. His shaking hands dropped the razor into the sink and Steve ran over, grabbing Tony into a hug. He whispered, "Why, Tony..."
Bruce nodded to show he agreed too. Steve stared at all of them, amazed. Although they often didn't show it, they truly cared for Tony. Then he looked at the man in the bed. Tony still hadn't moved, but to Steve's relief his eyes were closed and his chest was moving up and down, showing that he was just asleep.
Steve nodded, and set off for the lab. Upon arrival, he noticed that the blinds event closed and he could see that inside had been trashed. Papers were a over the floor and empty alcohol bottles were everywhere. He growled. So Tony was drinking? He really did only care about himself.
"I never wanted you guys to see me like that," Tony said only a little louder, mindful of the others in the room.
Steve was practically on the verge of tears. Tony had an eating disorder too? They had really misunderstood the poor man. Before anyone could respond to Helen, they heard a groan from the bed. Tony was waking up. Helen quickly rushed over, and whispered to Tony as he opened his eyes, "Easy..."
Steve sighed. "You know how he is."
He shouldn't have eaten that pizza.
Tony wandered down the halls into the kitchen so he could get a snack. He was surprised to see Steve there, eating a bowl of oatmeal.
Bruce, who was walking the opposite way saw Steve running with a panicked look on his face and stopped immediately. Steve didn't stop running however, only turned to him and shouted, "Tony need help!"
Everyone watched nervously as Tony blinked a few times. "W-where am I?" The billionaire asked hoarsely.
"Oh my Gosh..." Natasha whispered, running over.
Steve, taking this as an opportunity, slowly walked up to Tony. He was glad when he saw that Tony didn't move back, but was gripping his sleeves tightly. Steve exhaled and started, "Tony, I don't... I don't even know where to start. I've wronged you in so many ways. But I just want to say that I'm sorry for misunderstanding you. I thought you were just some rich playboy who would flaunt his wealth in our faces at any chance he got. But you're not. You're so much more than that. You're kind, you're caring, you're considerate, even when you don't think so. You're always thinking about the team, thinking about you can improve our gear. I used to think you would disobey and ignore my orders in missions because you were selfish, but I know now that it's because you truly care about others. You just want to save innocent lives. But Tony... you do it without caring about your own. You forget that... you're so important and that we would all-" Steve stopped, closing his eyes, and reminding himself that Tony was still alive, that Tony was still
He groaned. Yet another problem he needed to fix. But nothing a little diet and exercise couldn't do. And as he finally closed his eyes, letting sleep take over, a small part of him realized that he hadn't locked the doors the lab, and that anyone could come in at any time if they wanted to. But what did it matter, anyway? He was too tired to care.
In the middle of the movie, Clint grumpily exclaimed that he was hungry. Thor agreed and so Steve ordered pizza. Now normally Tony would be excited when someone mentioned pizza but, now he just felt nauseous. But the team seemed excited so he made sure to smile and laugh along with them. As time went on, Tony's nauseous only increased, and by the time the pizza arrived, he was sure he would puke on the spot. But he kept his face neutral and watched as everyone grabbed a slice. When he hadn't grabbed one himself, Natasha stared at him and then said slowly, "Aren't you going to grab one too, Tony?"
“Hm, very nice Steven. But do people know that you draw them without knowing about it?” Steve flew forward to grab it, but Rumlow grabbed him in a tight grip and held him back from grabbing Schmidt. And Schmidt was just smirking as he turned the sketchbook around to show him a drawing of the cheerleaders at practice.
“Damn, you’re right. Fuck!”
“That thing! It’s probably how you steer the ship, with that! Pull on it!” Tony was tugging on the joystick in every direction possible and his eyes flickered over from the asteroid right outside the window and then back to the stick.
“Well no, I was thinking of something else, actually. I mean, school will be over soon and your friends will be going away for a few weeks, aren’t they?” He leaned in a little closer. “If you want I could help keeping you
“Hm, perhaps it is here we can locate the means to leave this room?” He mumbled to himself and sat down in one of the chairs, scanning over the buttons and levers, but Natasha smacked his hand before he could press anything.
In other words, she was a Queen in the making and he was nothing but a nobody from the working class.
“I have a driver’s permit but no license yet.” She rolled her eyes.
Steve chuckled. "Thanks Tony, love you." The curry was good, but he barely tasted it as he ate because was eating so fast and finishing it so quickly that by the time he was done he barely remembered the taste. But hey, he wasn't hungry anymore and there was more so maybe he would remember better if ate some tomorrow.
Tony smiled reassuringly, if a bit cockily, and stroke his hair out of his eyes again. He folded his arms over his chest, leaning on his leg and looking into his big blue eyes.
Natasha’s lip quirked slightly and she got up from the bed and sat down beside Clint, wrapping her arm around his shoulders. “Hey Clint, I know it’s not what any of us wanted, but at least no one there will know who we are, right? You might make some friends there who won’t constantly call you a circus freak or whatever.” He looked at her, his eyebrow raised and head tilted.
Bruce swallowed loudly and walked closer to the window, placing his hand on the glass and his eyes locked on the green and blue planet on the outside. He stared at it for what felt like an eternity before turning back to the others with big, wide eyes and his face suddenly very pale.
But before anyone could hear any of sounds from the buttons or say anything, the ship’s lights suddenly started to flicker over by the control panel, loud alarms blared out from speakers and a slightly louder robotic voice spoke from the computer.
Once he had managed to get Tony ready for bed, helping him remove his makeup and get out of his tight suit, while Tony managed to wake up enough to brush his teeth and get into his pajamas, they found themselves together in bed and wrapped up in each other’s arms. Tony was out like a light less than a minute after lying down, with his head resting on Steve’s chest. Steve had his arms wrapped tightly around Tony’s waist, keeping him in place and pressed a few kisses to Tony’s cheek, nose and head before settling down to sleep as well.
It had happened so many times at this point that it was almost like they followed a script, like the words needed to be said, if only because they always said them, but they weren’t needed anymore. Whether it be when Tony woke up beside him while he was crying, or came in with a tray of food for him while he was listening to Sinatra, or when he was pounding the stuffing out of his punching bag in the gym with a snack and some water, Tony always seemed to know when Steve would want him to stay or go, but he always asked, regardless if he knew what the answer would be.
Toni almost stumbled back and she swallowed her, a lump forming in her throat.
“No idea, but the guy has been throwing dirty glances at us for the whole day. Maybe he’s just mad his BFFL isn’t here and is taking it out on us.” Tony rolled his eyes and shook his head slightly.
Clint rolled his eyes and gagged behind them. “Ugh, come on guys, if you’re gonna be all gross like that can you at least go to the bedroom?” Tony just flipped him off without looking away from Steve, pressing a kiss to his nose.
She never said anything about these things, because if she ever did plan of revealing these things she wanted to make it hurt. She’d like to have all her cards sorted out and make sure the people would suffer as she revealed it. Or it was just nice to know these things without them knowing about it. It made it a little more bearable, she supposed.
Natasha and Steve in particular had become really close. Natasha still had moments of acting cold, to all of them besides Clint really, but they both found things to bond over, as they both felt a little isolated in the world due to their pasts, and while she obviously knew more about the 21
“Oh fuck off, Rogers, no one asked for your opinion.” Rogers? Rogers… Bruce had heard that before, but was the full name… oh yeah, Steve Rogers! They had math together, but he was probably a bigger introvert than Bruce because he was sure the guy never actually spoke or hung out with anyone. At least not that Bruce knew.
Steve glared at him, arms still folded over his chest and his eyebrows were furrowed. “Oh come on, Stark, she was just going to look for phone service, it can’t take too long. I give her an hour or so, an hour and a half at most.” Tony just shook his head and leaned back against a tree.
Steve just sighed, moonily and just a tad dopily as he rested one arm on the counter and his head in his hand, staring out the windows after her. “She said yes, Sam. She actually said yes! And she kissed me! She kissed me on the cheek!” Sam nodded and flipped a page in his textbook.
He looked about as close to a Hercules as you could probably get. Well, a Hercules with blonde hair and looking very All-American, but still.
It was painfully clear that Steve didn't do 'friends with benefits' and that both unnerved her and intrigued her.
“Sure. Anything special you’re hungry for tonight?” Steve smiled and leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to his fiancé’s nose before gently letting go and running his hand through his very ruffled hair.
Natasha turned to him, her face softening slightly and she looked him over, before grabbing the backpack he had dropped on the floor when he fell. “Sometimes I think you like pissing off these guys until they pound you into the ground. What if one day I’m not here to save your ass?” Clint rolled his eyes and dusted off his jeans and t-shirt.
Tony sighed in contentment as he sat down on the couch with a cup of coffee and placed his laptop on his lap. Finally a day off and he had taken care of everything he needed to do. The laundry was taken care of, he had cleaned the apartment, and now all that was left was paying the bills for the month before he could kick back and relax.
fight, and this time not even for defending anyone from bullies but not just losing his temper when an asshole taunted him.
“I believe I have found a manual of sorts! Perhaps the answers on how to steer the ship can be found in here!” Clint glared over him and almost slapped the book out of his hands.
your bullshit and
Steve had no idea if any of those rumors were true, but both Natasha and Clint were very good at gymnastics, and he was scary good at archery and she was an expert at martial arts. So the idea that Clint might have had a past with some kind of circus, and Natasha might have been trained since very young to do these things, since she had this dangerous air about her, which made most people stay away from her while still gawking at her beauty. But Steve had never been one to listen too much to rumors so he didn’t really believe it. Well, not much anyway.
“Maybe you should ask her about that?”
But Clint just smirked at him tilting his head at Steve. “Oh, so you wanted to go here? Tell me, what made you jump at the chance to go to Camp Delight for the summer?” Steve flushed a bright red and looked down at his sketchbook.
Tony had gone to his and Steve’s room first, to change out of his suit and into his comfortable jeans and t-shirt before heading into the kitchen to see what was on the menu for the evening. But only seconds after having exited the elevator and before he could head towards the kitchen, he was greeted by Steve, who smiled widely when he saw him and immediately welcomed him home with a soft kiss.
“JARVIS, lower the music!” His yelling wasn’t loud enough to be heard over the music, but Jarvis still lowered the music enough for Steve to relax again. Tony jerked up from his work on in his armor and glared at him.
“I just hope you’re hungry, babe, ‘cause there’s a lot of food tonight.”
Toni sighed again and gripped Janet's hand back. "I don't know if I can. I’m not like you Jan, nice guys don't exist for me, you know that. They always act like they are at first, only to stab me in the back when they’ve gotten what they want. It always happens. I can't put myself through that again, especially not after-" Her voice broke and she had clear and blink hard to keep back the tears. "After Ty."
“Ugh, okay, so here’s what we’re gonna do. I’m gonna go back the way we came and see if I get any signal and if I can call for help. In the meantime you kids stay here and wait for me to come back.” Clint narrowed his eyes at her and walked away from what he and Thor had been doing.
“Hi puppy. Hi buddy, hi.” Tony smiled and placed the dog down on Steve’s lap, and it immediately got up in Steve’s face and licked him in the face, the neck and everywhere it could reach, with the bushy tail wagging back and forth, making it almost look like a propeller.
And that was what really drew Steve in. Sure, she was beautiful, there was no denying that, but now that he had gotten to know her he had fallen for her hook line and sinker. She was scary smart; a genius in the making and Steve had no doubt she was going to change the world with her brilliant mind and amazing creations. She was witty and funny and always had a good response to everything, either making people laugh or taking apart any argument people were having with her. She was confident, owned every room she walked in to and even when she said weird or nonsensical things she could make you believe it wasn't.
“So… we’re actually in space? Like, actually for real, we’re in outer fucking space?” Up till this moment no one had heard Bruce swear, which somehow made the situation feel more real. As if everything wasn’t just a practical joke from some TV Show or something.
“What’s not gonna work, honey?” He looked up at Tony, all big innocent puppy-dog eyes, while pulling his pants of entirely and throwing them to the side. He debated with himself whether or not to take off Tony’s t-shirt too, and eventually decided to leave it on for now, and slowly got up and gently pushed Tony down on the mattress before crawling over, positioning himself over Tony, hands placed one both sides of his head, and leaned down to kiss him.
“I don’t regret saying yes to any of it. I don’t regret going on that first date back in high school, I don’t regret moving in together in Boston and I really don’t regret accepting your proposal. I don’t care what he has to say, I love you and that trumps him disapproving of us and everything else he thinks of me. He might think that I’m throwing my life away and that I’m just rebelling against him for the hell of it and we’ll never last for longer than a year or whatever but I know better.”
“And what about you? Are you just sit around and glare at everyone who dares looking at you? Or sip on ‘vodka’ all the time?” She rolled her eyes and smacked him on the head.
Though sometimes… well, very often actually, Tony would stay with him. He’d join him in the gym, either to work out himself or just to keep Steve company or sit down next to Steve on their bed, cuddle up to him and stay there for as long as Steve wanted him to. Which, nine times out of ten, ended with both of them falling asleep in each other’s arms. Sometimes, if they were watching a movie, they’d fall asleep before it was over.
"What do you mean you're
(See the end of the chapter for
! You were smaller than
"Well, I want to take a warm shower. I want to wash all of the grime and blood and dirt from this mission off me." He lowered his voice seductively. "You want to help me with that?" Tony smirked and wrapped his arms around his neck.
Tony pressed his lips together, took another breath and his voice sounded a little strained. “I tried to make it as clear as possible that he wasn’t wanted, that I wanted nothing to do with him. B-but whatever I said or did, he just wouldn’t leave me alone. He tried to buy me a drink, I said no. He asked me questions about how I’d been doing and stuff, I gave short and rude responds. He kept… he kept
“Well then, Brucie Bear, let me introduce the universe’s most advanced hair dryer. It will make sure you’re hair stays warm and fluffy at all times, with extra styling of your hair for no extra charge.” Bruce chuckled and knelt down to look at the display.
But thankfully it didn't bruise, but it did hurt a bit even after she had sat with that damn icepack against her face for twenty minutes and her ass got sore from her uncomfortable as fuck chair, so she eventually got up and put it away, washed her hands a bit and decided to go grab a coffee to get a change of scenery. Which, yeah wasn't a very smart move if she wanted to get away from Steve since he worked today, but she needed to get out of the workshop and have some change in scenery.
Steve’s annoyance softened a little and smile became more genuine. He placed his arm around Tony’s shoulders and pulled him close, off the armrest and into his lap. “If it’s from you, I know I’ll love it. “
"At medical. You... you relapsed," Helen told him cautiously.
"Didn't ask!" Tony quickly interrupted.
"Tony, please look at me. I need you to understand."
Again, no response. Then, Steve noticed that the bathroom door was ajar. He groaned, and walked over, carefully avoiding stepping on the papers on the floor. As he got closer to the bathroom, the smell of copper grew stronger. He finally reached the door, and by then the smell was suffocating him. He resisted the urge to cover his nose and walked into the bathroom slowly. And his eyes caught onto Tony's hair.
'team movie night' existed. When he questioned them about it, they all shared guilty looks and Bruce explained, "Uh yeah, we had them. But we didn't really know if you wanted to be a part of it since you were always in the lab..."
Steve nodded and then gasped. "Wait, why are we just standing here? We need to take him to medical!"
"Sir, please, you seem to be malnourished-"
Steve walked up to him carefully. "I did," the blond said.
As if reading his thoughts Jarvis, said, "Sir, the mess was cleaned during your time in medical. You can thank Mr. Rogers for that."
Tony scowled. "Yeah sure, Jarvis. Who said you could talk anyway?"
Helen nodded. "He's recovering. He'll wake up very soon. But... can I ask you guys a favor?"
Tony gasped. "What?"
Steve told them the same thing he told Bruce and Thor. "He cut himself."
He felt Tony tense a bit. "What's wrong?" He asked the brunette.
Everyone nodded and started off to the Quinjet. Tony sighed and followed.
should i continue this...
He watched as the team continued to grab slices, and he watched Thor as he bit into what seemed like his 16th pizza. Tony stared, jealous. How could the guy eat so much yet stay so fit? Tony looked down to his own bulging stomach and the nauseousness came back, full force. He suddenly stood up, with a great urge to vomit, and managed to choke out, "I'll be right back, just gotta use the bathroom."
He then went back over to the couch to put his laptop and coffee mug away and also fluffing up the pillows for a nice dinner and movie night.
“I know I am! You’re damn lucky that I’m here to look after you and boost your ego when you’re being stupid, you big baby.” Toni chuckled and moved to wrap her arms around her again, resting her chin on Janet’s shoulder and Jan quickly reciprocated the gesture.
And then, of course, there was Tony Stark. To say that he and Tony had gotten a rocky start would be an understatement. Even after they apologized for their harsh words on the Helicarrier, there was just something about Tony that had rubbed Steve the wrong way. There was just something about his attitude, this air of I-don’t-give-a-fuck that irked him a little. That Tony seemed to think he could do whatever he wanted and didn’t care about the consequences. That he didn’t have to listen to orders or directions or ideas from others, because ‘Fuck you, I’m Tony Stark, I do whatever I want’. And it didn’t help that they were oil and water and would get into arguments after every mission.
“Tony? Sweetheart, what’s wrong? What happened that I need to forgive you for?” Tony squirmed uncomfortably under Steve’s gaze, the hand that Steve wasn’t holding clenched tightly. He took a breath, visibly bracing himself before looking up at Steve, a few strands of hair hanging over his face.
Steve looked a little surprised at how forward Tony suddenly was and how quickly he had brushed the whole almost-drowning-thing off, but his smile looked more natural now and he took a step forward.
, asked Tony to marry him and Tony had said yes, everything had felt so wonderful and nothing had been able to bring him down.
And then she ran into to him at MIT from time to time, sometimes in the corridors or out on the campus lawn or in the library. And, against her better judgement, she started to hang out with him there too. She would greet him with a wide smile when she met him between classes or sit with on the lawn for a bit while he was hanging out with friends, or sit with him when he sat in the library and he was trying to study and bug for hours with endless talking or joking around with him.
“Well, Clint and Natasha were called in by Fury. Some top-secret mission he wanted them to get to ASAP. Thor is on a date with Jane while she’s in town and Bruce is on a seminar about radiation biology and its implications, so…” He placed his hands on Tony’s waist with a sweet smile on his face. “since it’s just the two of us, I wanted to spoil you a little.” He pressed a soft yet lingering kiss on Tony’s forehead, then his nose and then his mouth.
He turned to look over his shoulder and saw Johann Schmidt with Brock Rumlow on his right, like some kind of right hand man or something.
She leaned on the counter, looking him straight in the eyes. “Long enough to hear you think you’re not good enough to breathe the same air as me. That you think I’m too good for you.” And now she looked a little hurt, and Steve immediately felt bad at even the idea that he might have hurt her. “Is that what you think of me, Steve? You think I’m so swallow that I judge my friends by their bank account? Or how many facts they can cram into their heads? Or how successful they
“Oh, so defensive Steven. I just wanted to see how my old friend is doing, all alone with no friends to eat with.” Steve gritted his teeth and tried to breathe calmly through his nose so he wouldn’t loose his temper.
“Steve, people are looking!” Not that Tony actually minded that people looked, they could stare all they wanted for all he cared, but he still couldn’t help flushing at Steve’s very open affections for him. PDA got nothing on Steve Rogers.
Tony blushed a little as he got the many extravagant gifts listed up for him, but waved it off and smirked his usual confidant smirk. “Well, obviously I’ve got a big gift for you! What kind of husband would I be if I didn’t? Becoming a centenarian is a big deal. But this one I know you will love, I guarantee it.”
Okay, now he was really pushing it and it was becoming harder to come up with jokes to play off his insults with. He took another breath and cupped his hand behind his ear, like one might do when they wanted to hear better.
As he made his way down the hallway he felt people stare at him and heard them whisper or laugh as he passed them. He didn’t care what were saying, because it was never anything new. There was nothing they could say about him that he hadn’t already heard from everyone else.
Still, that didn’t mean he didn’t have bad days. Days when he’d wake up from nightmares about the ice, the dark cold surrounding him and leaving him unable to breathe. Nightmares of Bucky falling off the train and to his death in the mountains, just barely missing Steve’s hand trying to catch him and save him. Or dreams of Peggy and how his life could’ve looked like if he hadn’t been forced to fly the Valkyrie into the ice and had been able to try to have a life with her. Or if he’d just been able to live in the 40’s if the war had never happened at all. Maybe he could’ve just gone to art school, gotten a job drawing comics or something, met a dame and they could’ve had a simple life together. No fighting in a war, no super-soldier serum, no crashing into the ice and being thawed out against his will several decades later. No being forced to live in a world that wasn’t his anymore. And after he woke up from these dreams or nightmares, the dark thoughts barging in uninvited into his brain and wouldn’t leave him alone, sometimes for days on end.
His voice suddenly sounded choked up and blinked heavily, like he was holding back tears, which gave Toni pause and she suddenly felt less angry and offended and more pitying. He took a deep breath and looked like he was readying himself for something.
Bucky had texted him and said he wouldn’t come to school today, which meant Steve was alone to fend off other kids as he tried to survive the last day. Again, not the easiest thing to do, considering he had no other friends to talk to or any other way to pass the time.
And that’s not even mentioning his claustrophobia and the idea of being trapped in this ship for who knows how long and being able to go somewhere else or being able to breathe some fresh air when he needed it.
“Let the man choose for himself! We have all made our decisions on our own, let him make his.” He then turned to smile gently at Bruce. “Take your time my friend, there is no rush.” Bruce smiled gratefully at him before turning back to the buttons and took a shaky breath.
There was no idea that this wasn't going to end badly in the long run. It always did in the end.
He gestured to himself dejectedly. “And then there’s me. Steve Rogers, scrappy kid from Brooklyn with no money, a bit above average intelligence and have been studying Art for almost two years and has nothing to offer anyone.”
Steve looked mock-outraged at him and turned his nose in the air. “Well, if you’re gonna be like that I don’t think I wanna cook for you in the future, you’ve hurt my feelings Stark.” Tony smacked him on the arm again and moved towards his chair.
“Well, I didn’t see you come with any bright ideas or initiatives Rogers, so maybe you should just-“ Then the lights went off again and they turned to look back at the podium as the screen appeared. Steve turned to Bruce, now looking very concerned.
to some Gelato. As a thank you for saving me from drowning.” Steve smiled, and damn, that smile was way more breathtaking than any smile had any right to be.
"Long enough to hear you think you're not good enough to breathe the same air as me. That you think I'm too good for you." She narrowed her eyes at him, honestly offended by what he had said.
"Asshole. Here I go preparing dinner for you and let you just sit there and relax and not waste any energy after a three-day mission and you attack me! See if I'm ever nice to you again, Rogers." Steve laughed, put the fork down and buried his face in Tony's stomach again, kissing his belly.
“I don’t know, actually. We just said we’d meet up at the Starbucks at 7pm tonight.” Janet’s smile froze and she shifted a little closer to her.
“Well, help yourself honey.” Tony smirked and took two big scoops of spaghetti.
Tony shrugged and tried for an easy smile. He figured it was better to play dumb in this situation, despite feeling vey uncomfortable around these guys.
He had never liked the man, even as a child and his terrible behavior, drinking and child abuse flew way over his head. Back then he had just thought he was mean and a jerk, but it rarely bothered him too much since he and Tony spent most of their time and his house rather than Tony’s. But as he got older he realized more and more just how terrible Howard was and started to outright hate the man’s guts and made no secret to Tony or any of their friends what he thought of him. And Howard had never liked him either, both because he was
“Uh! And what is that supposed to mean? What makes you think I’ve done anything at all?” Steve huffed a small laugh and looked Tony right in the eyes.
ever made that attempt yourself. And
And sure, there were rumors about Clint, like how Clint was from a family of circus freaks or how his real dad had killed his little brother when they were kids and Clint had run off to join a circus when he was really young before being put in an orphanage and eventually got adopted when he was seven.
Tony rolled his eyes while still pressing his arm over his eyes. Sure, like he could make friends with anyone in that kind of environment. Kids in his school only saw him as a spoiled, rich brat who had never worked a day in his life, so what were the chances of anyone seeing him in a better light at a freaking nature camp?
Also, there are references for how my machines look at the bottom, just in case you’re confused by my terrible descriptions.
Steve laughed softly, shaking his head fondly as the dialed up their favorite Chinese restaurant and ordered all while Tony was still rambling on about the movie and instead of pulling up Netflix he was flicking through different channels. And even though Tony was still talking a mile a minute and barely stopped to breathe, not even looking at Steve anymore, Steve felt his heart swell and warmth spread through his body as he looked at him.
He was really hungry and tired and he knew he should get up and have some dinner, but he was just too tired. The mission had been three straight days of running around for intel that HYDRA had stolen from SHIELD and also fight a few big robots and HYDRA soldiers, which had been tiring since they never seemed to end.
But she just smiled at him and tried to look as calming and reassuring as she could, squeezing his hand between her own. "I would love to, Steve. How about we meet up here, maybe around 7pm?"
“Come on, we need to try and get out of the way!” Tony yelled to be heard over the alarms and the robotic voice that kept repeating
A few tears finally managed to slip out of the corners of Tony’s eyes and his shaky voice was interrupted with a few sobs. “I-I… I s-swear S-Steve, I-I wanted t-to f-fight him off. I-I d-didn’t want him to touch me or kiss me, bu-but i-it w-was like I was f-fourteen years old again, I-I just… c-couldn’t. It w-was like m-my own b-body stopped w-working and I-I couldn’t get away o-on my own-”
He looked down at his wristwatch.
He groaned and rested his forehead against the steering wheel. He wasn’t doing a very good jump pumping himself up for his final day of sophomore year, but he also knew he could stay in in car forever, so just grabbed his bag and got out of the car.
school laboratories on fire and none
Still, he didn’t let himself get deterred and just glared at his brother. “If you have nothing more you wish to tell me, then I suggest you leave me alone and let me pack in peace.” Loki just smirked at him and jumped off the bed, making his way to the door. But before he left the room, he turned to look at Thor.
“Oh, I have the perfect thing for that! I’ve been dying to see this with you; it’s the best of the worst! You ever heard of The Room? Of course you have, everybody has! Anyway, I have never actually seen it, only a clip here or there, but it’s one of the worst movies of all time and also super funny-“
told him that you would love to go out him.
"Wow, that was… certainly something." He tried to sound somewhat glad because he knew she just wanted him to be happy, but he had a sneaking suspicion that he wouldn't like whatever was connected to his parents sitting him down to watch that stupid commercial.
“Of course. But first,” He took the ring out of the box and gently put it on Tony’s ring finger. Tony gently pulled his hand out of Steve’s grip to get a closer look at it, and now that he wasn’t in complete surprise by Steve proposing and he got a closer look at it, he recognized it very quickly.
Seriously, the fact that there were people in this century that spent thousands of dollars on birthday parties made Steve’s skin crawl.
“How did have even know about? We haven’t told him anything and it hasn’t hit the Internet, so how did he know?” Tony shrugged and pinched his lips.
“Dad, I’m done now.” He looked up from the paper and looked at Bruce with tired, drunk eyes. Bruce rolled his eyes and bit his lip so he wouldn’t say anything, he just sighed.
"Yeah, sure, I can do that." He pressed a kiss to Steve's cheek before gently pulling away from the embrace and walked back to the fridge and poured a tall glass of milk before placing both it and the milk carton on the table in front of Steve. He stroked back his hair and kissed it. "Now eat your dinner already, before you faint from hunger pains."
“I hate college, Steve. If these exams don’t kill me this insane schedule will! I swear, I’m getting no sleep these days; all I do is study all day and all night! And that's not even mentioning the amount of money I've had to pay for everything! Why the hell did I ever think this was a good idea?” Steve smirked and looked up from his drawing.
“Oh, so your dad is the CEO for Odinson’s Solutions? My dad has talked about that before, he says they’re one of the few big companies that pose any threat to Stark Industries.” Thor smirked back at him and nodded, but before he could say anything, a loud BANG was heard and the driver cursed as she slowed down and pulled over by the road.
Steve’s cheeks flushed a bright red and smiled brightly, if a bit sheepishly and bent down to kiss Tony’s cheek in return. “Well, I’m very glad you did. But I was hoping to give you one more thing tonight.”
much difference. You’re still far away from him, whether on camp or in space. It’s not too much difference there.” Natasha smacked him and he yelped in pain, rubbing his arm where a small red mark was starting to form from her hand. “What? It’s true!”
“Yeah. We have the same dad and we’ve lived together since we were kids. She’s had my back since as forever.” He looked over at Bruce and smiled. “And you are?” Bruce smiled, a bit awkwardly and reached out his hand.
“I know you’re in there, Romanov, I can smell your trashiness from here, you little slut! Your freak brother can’t always protect you, you piece of shit!”
, but he wouldn’t have done that if you hadn’t pushed him too.
Whenever she flirted, she wanted the other party to either be aware that she was joking and wasn't too serious about it, or to flirt right back and she might walk away with a number she would forget or throw away, or they would spend a night in her apartment and that would be the end of that. That was about as far as her 'dating' went and she never did anything with any strings attached.
your fault. He has a grip on you mentally and psychologically, and after what he did to you, it makes complete sense that you’d still be wary of him. He didn’t listen when you dismissed him, and that is not your fault. It’s
Steve scrunched his nose, both confused and annoyed. “What? Quinoa, that can’t be a thing, right?” Tony laughed a little and shook his head at his fiancé. Sometimes he wondered how he’d managed to become engaged to such an adorable idiot, but then re-read that thought and then he remembered.
She kinda expected him to get annoyed with her after a while, with her relentless talking and flirting and hanging around him, but he didn't. On the contrary he seemed to enjoy her company more and more with every day. He would smile wide and brightly when he saw her smile and greet him in between classes, would gladly introduce her to old and new friends he had made and laugh at her jokes and humor her when she would talk nonstop at him in the library.
“Because I say so, now come on!” Then, suddenly, an loud humming started to accompany the light and hissing and it all got closer and closer and louder and louder. The kids shared a look between themselves before hurrying back into the car, slamming the doors behind them, but still keeping a watchful eye on what was going on outside. Steve looked out his window and bit his lip.
“What? What did you say, babe?” Tony smiled weakly and looked up at him with a few small tears in his big eyes.
flirted
And the most amazing about her: she took no shit from anyone. Whether it be professors or classmates or- and especially- men trying to silence her or demean her, she always knew how to handle them and make them feel humiliated or demeaned instead. Steve would always remember that day when he saw Justin Hammer trying to tell her how
When the hour was up, the kids gathered around the podium again as the lights went off again, the screen reappeared and the Watcher’s strange alien form appeared in front of them.
Bruce's eyes widened and he followed Steve to the lab. Once they got there, they noticed that the windows were not able to be seen through. This only made them more anxious and they started shouting, "JARVIS, let us in!"
Tony bit his lip and sighed, staying put. Was Steve sleep talking or was he really awake? Despite this, Tony stayed close. He wanted to savor this for as long as it lasted, even if it wasn't real...
"Please... please keep an eye on him. I know Tony can be annoying sometimes but he means well. And, if you let him be alone for too long... he gets very self-destructive," Helen told them.
But, he fell for that mask, just like many others had. Steve had just been washing the dishes when he heard JARVIS say, "Captain, Sir is in great need of assistance."
Steve nodded happily. "Thank you Jarvis!" He walked into the lab. It was no longer trashed, and the lights were dim. He spotted Tony dozing off with his head in his arms on a desk. He walked closer to the brunette, and couldn't help but notice his messy hair. Steve wanted to run his fingers through it, just to see how soft it was. Tony looked so peaceful when he was asleep. If only he always looked that way. Steve pondered these thoughts for a moment and then gasped, realizing what he was thinking.
Tony ignored Jarvis, and walked over to his desk, starting a new project. Jarvis continued to bug him.
Tony didn't respond. He knew Jarvis didn't care. He couldn't. He wasn't programmed to do that. Sure, Jarvis could act like he cared but he didn't really, nobody did.
He vomited until he dry-heaved, and then he just sat there, reminiscing in what he had just done. The hunger came back, and he quickly felt weak again. He sighed, and stood up, using the wall to steady himself. He knew the team was starting to get suspicious so he quickly rinsed his mouth, sprayed a bit of cologne to wash away the vomit smell, but not enough that they would know he sprayed a new one, and then he quickly walked out.
IM SO SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG!! I have this rlly bad habit of starting something and not finishing it but, I don't want to continue doing that! I was on writer's block for a while but I'm back! I'll try and finish this so expect more updates from now on! So sorry but hope you enjoyed! And should I continue this? I feel like it's getting a little boring?
Tony was shocked. Why would Bruce be sorry? It was his own fault. "Bruce... it's my fault, you shouldn't be sorry."
Steve shrugged. "I suspect it was an act for attention."
Tony's was shivering, and his breaths were coming out ragged. Steve knew he was about to have a panic attack. Luckily at this moment, the others had come in and were all in a state of shock when they saw the situation. Tony's sleeves were still rolled up, so the damage was visible and his sharp breaths showed that he needed help right away.
But neither Bruce not Thor responded. Instead, Bruce bolted out of the room and Steve was sure he saw some green on his neck. Thor still stood frozen in the same spot. The he looked up at Steve and muttered, "Cut himself...?"
Ha, Tony thought. As if Steve was surprised. "How did you know I was coming?" Tony asked, angry at them.
Everyone looked horrified. Steve shouted, "No Tony! No we don't want anything from you! We're doing this because we care!"
"Steve..."
Steve rubbed the back of his neck nervously, and Clint quickly said, "Jarvis told us."
Steve shook his head. "Shh... It's okay, Tony..."
"Like I said, Tony is very insecure about his body. He thinks he's fat or something, which obviously isn't true, but he doesn't seem to see that," Helen mumbled.
This was punishment, he decided. Punishment for letting Clint get hurt, punishment for disobeying, and punishment for existing at all. He pressed the knife into his leg multiple times, until the blood dripped onto the floor, causing the puddle that formed to get bigger. He began to feel himself get dizzy and he dropped the knife, the smell of copper becoming strong.
Steve closed his eyes and heard Thor's footsteps coming behind him. He heard Natasha and Clint run over to Thor and gasp at Tony's condition. "What the hell!" Clint shouted.
Steve held him tighter and whispered, "Yeah."
The brunette stared blankly at her for a moment and then he examined his arms. They were tightly bandaged, and a little sore. "How did you find me?" He asked Helen, quietly.
Steve quickly dropped the dish he was rinsing and heard it crack at the impact. He ignored that and ran towards the direction of the lab.
Tony gasped, his head shooting up. He panted, trying to forgot his nightmare. He looked down to his stomach, only to see the fat bulging through his shirt. He moaned in despair and bolted into the bathroom, quickly turning on the light. He stared at his reflection in the mirror. The fat wasn't only in his stomach, but in his cheeks too. He quickly turned away from the mirror and spotted a single toothbrush lying in a cup. He grabbed it with shaking hands, remembering something he read online with Bruce.
Now, Tony understood. He understood why people did things like this. He looked at the toilet and sighed. This was the only way he would ever lose the fat. The only way he'd ever be perfect.
"We all will," Clint butted in.
"He might wake up. His heart is pumping very quickly and he's twitching a bit," Helen responded sharply. "How long was he in the bathroom?"
Steve nodded and let go of his hand. "Tony... we will make this up to you."
He stayed on the floor for a few more minutes, until he felt himself begin to stand and walk into the bathroom. He turned on the light, and looked at himself in the mirror. He felt ashamed at what he saw staring back at him. Tony had heavy bags under his eyes, his face was very pale, his eyes red and wide, and his hair disheveled and matted with sweat. He felt his hand reach out to the cabinet and pull out something sharp. He stared at what he has pulled out. A knife, new and never used was sitting in his hand, waiting to cut something. And suddenly, he got a crazy idea.
