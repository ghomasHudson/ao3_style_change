That had been too close, and Steve wasn't prepared to lose him again. Hell, Steve isn’t prepared to lose Tony,
Despite his better judgement, and regardless of it all, that’s what it all comes back to. He can hate him and resent him and push him away all he likes, but Tony’s known the whole time. Steve Rogers isn’t the kind of man you just stop loving. Apparently, not even after a shield to the chest.
And it’s not that he’s all that jealous. He knows that Bucky and Tony would never—of course, he knows that.
He’s not wearing safety goggles, and Steve considers chiding him, just for old time’s sake. With a hand on the door, he pauses.
“You, Steve. You’ve changed.” Tony brushes his knuckles over Steve’s cheekbone, framing his face until his thumb drags across Steve’s bottom lip.
“Actually, I’m really glad you asked, Cap, because no. We can’t talk about it. Not now, not later, definitely not when you get back. I may not have a choice over any of what’s happening here and all the things everyone else believes they can tell me to do. But I damn well won’t be listening to you. I don’t care what you have to say, I don’t have the time and frankly, I don’t want to hear it.”
She floats gracefully throughout the room, making the rounds and answering question after question about the expansion of Stark Industries and the funding allotment for the Maria Stark Foundation. Tony smiles and charms, losing himself in the role that he’s been filling for years. As easy as riding a bike. Except his eyes keep twitching towards the bar, and if he starts drinking now it’ll be too easy to fall off and skin his knees.
With robotic movements, Steve rises on unsteady legs and all but collapses next to Tony, his head coming down onto Tony’s chest and his arms wrapping around Tony’s waist where they hesitate and don’t squeeze.
“A lot of things could go either way, with you.” Natasha hums which startled a laugh out of the billionaire. He stretched out, pinned her with a leer, and waggled his eyebrows.
“What about us?” Steve asked, quieter, arms trembling where Bucky watched him try not to snap the phone clenched in his fist.
“Oh my god. You’re joking, right? Tell me you’re joking. You can’t be that blind!” Mirth dancing around the corners of Tony’s mouth.
“Calendar.” Bruce corrected, but his lips are twitching and he’s enjoying it as much as any of them.
“It’s okay. Just, tell me.” Tony brushes fingers through his hair, looks into his eyes with that soft, ever-present warmth. God, what did he ever do to deserve that?
“This is a—oh my god, are you serious right now? This is a thing! You’re not telling me what you think because you don’t want me to do something just because it’s what you’d do? This is you ‘trusting me’ to know myself best? Like with Barnes, right? Steve?” Tony gives him a disbelieving look because seriously, what the fuck?
Tony grunts and fists his hands in the sheet, pressing his forehead down as heat washes through him. “Oh fuck.”
The circle of Steve’s fist is tight and warm. Tony drops his head to Steve’s shoulder, gasping and desperate to watch. It’s been so long since he’s seen Steve fall apart.
When Steve had worked three fingers inside him, Tony’s body started to shift restlessly beneath him, signalling he was ready for more. Steve slicked himself up and pressed between his cheeks, holding off taking him as he savoured the slippery glide that left sparks of pleasure shooting up his spine.
Steve staggers under the weight of his confession, or at least, Tony thinks he must because a second ago he was upright and now Tony’s on the ground. They’re both on the ground and the grass is wet and dew-drenched. Tony supposes that he should feel cold but his body doesn’t register it.
“I’d like to try and explain, but it took me a while to figure it out. The first part isn’t so nice.”
A rush of anger floods him and Steve fists his hands in Tony’s t-shirt, tugging him forward almost violently, trying to dig his way inside Tony’s body and never leave. He presses them together as best he can until Tony finally gets with the program and throws a leg over Steve’s hips to straddle his thighs but Tony holds back. His hands slide into Steve’s hair but don’t pull, he just tilts Steve’s head back and kisses him like he really means it, slipping his tongue gently into Steve’s mouth and licking along his lower lip.
“The caveman gig is surprisingly sexy. I dig it.” Tony laughs, kissing Steve and licking into his mouth for a brief moment before he pulls back. “When do you need to go?”
The more he stumbled upon them, the more he found himself tripping into a hot shower, jerking himself off fast onto the tiles. It was getting a bit exhausting.
The air around them crackles and the liquid fire races through Tony and into Steve. The pain is instant and all-consuming. He doesn’t know how Tony can stand it. It’s like they’ve been plugged right into the New York energy grid and Steve feels his heart skip beats in his chest. His skin burns and he can smell them, the charred flesh of Tony’s wrist and their joined palms where Steve grips him and refuses to let go.
“I know. I want you anyway.” Selfish. So fucking selfish. There’s still something vindicating about hearing it aloud.
He spots him, a stone’s throw away. His suit is mangled in various places, but the wound in his side is freshly stitched with nanites. Peter is in his arms, gasping.
Tony dozes for a while, in and out, floating along the crest of the opiates and Steve’s hums of contentment in his sleep. Amazing, that Steve can fall asleep here, like this, after all that’s happened and Tony chalks it up to something similar to a rabbit, when totally safe and at peace, flopping onto its side and showing its soft underbelly.
“I don’t really like dancing, Bucky,” Peter gives a small frown and the reference lost in translation between the two generations has everyone laughing again.
Clint had been the lucky recipient, and out of duty and his strong commitment to trolling, every winter at the first snowfall he unpacked the gloves from his closet and wore them until spring.
After Sam starts his B.A.R.F. sessions with Rhodey, things start to shift in Tony’s run-ins with the rest of the team. It shouldn’t still shock him, by now, the amount of himself he needs to give before he receives scraps in return. As if he hadn’t given them so much already, before now.
“I hate that you’re doing this to me.” Tony ran his hands down Bucky’s chest in reluctant appreciation. “How do you manage to still look so good in all my fuzzy shit?”
Whether he has the papers in hand or not, he’s officially divorced. Tony wonders if Steve knows yet, or if he alone has been blessed with the curse of knowledge.
The next time he wakes up—or, one of the times, Pepper tells him that he’s been in and out for days—he can see that he’s in a hospital room, charred arm at his side, body riddled with cuts and bruises like ink spilled across his chest and abdomen. Nothing hurts, and he’s flying high.
Tony thinks about the few people in this world that find their way back to each other, even after they separate. A farce, really, or a B-level Hallmark movie.
The revelation burns his fingertips and he powers down the soldering tip with a curse. DUM-E offers an empathetic whirr, and the fire extinguisher rolls across the ground at his feet.
The barely restrained anger surfaces and starts to show its face—funny, and here Tony was thinking it was Bruce who was always angry—and Tony wonders whether or not it’s the sheer force of the super-soldier serum containing it.
The elevator door chimes and opens into Tony’s magnificent penthouse suite, but Steve can’t be bothered to take in more than the path that seems to lead towards a bedroom. Tony’s bedroom, a guest bedroom, it doesn’t matter as Steve herds Tony towards it with a firm grip on his hips.
He does the deep breathing and thinks the happy thoughts, but it doesn’t make a dent in the weight that sits on his chest and crushes him all over again. It doesn’t fade until he’s walking through the doors to SI and Pepper’s calming face is greeting him, not asking any questions, just being a calm, soothing, warm body next to his own.
“I figured I’d better give my liver a fighting chance before the aliens come.” Tony shoots back, guzzling down his coffee and dragging his eyes up to meet Rhodey’s gaze. He winces, and offers him a meager half-smile.
It must be all the permission Tony needs because he gasps into Steve’s mouth and then he’s driving into Steve with purpose, letting his hips glide all the way back to bury himself to the hilt. If Tony wants him to feel every stroke of his cock inside him, he hits the mark. The slick sounds of their bodies meeting echo alongside Tony’s sharp little breaths and Steve’s hands slide down to Tony’s hips, tugging him closer, needing to feel him as deep as Tony can possibly get.
That was key. Bucky growled low in his chest, teeth constricting around the gland until it was painful and tears flickered behind his eyes. It was too much.
There have been just as many nights when he sits, eyes downcast, while Tony tells him the same. But that isn’t what Tony says this time. He just rubs a thumb across one of Steve’s nipples and asks, “Were you happy there?”
“And I’m happy for you. Truly.” Tony considers taking Steve’s hand and thinks better of it, lacing his fingers together and letting them hang between the slight spread of his knees. He’s mirroring Steve’s posture, he realizes a second too late. Trying to convey a comfort and ease he doesn’t feel, even now.
This story wasn't originally going to end on a bittersweet note, but the more I thought about where we were headed, the more I realized it had to. That's the way this kind of love goes, especially a love like this.
He looks up at Bucky to ask, but the sleek, black arm stops him short. It isn’t the light silver of the Stark Tech he remembers.
Now, Steve traces a finger across the entire thing from edge to edge, face tight and set in a firm line and Tony feels raw. “Can we start with this, please?”
“Mr. Parker is not of age for gambling. It would be ill-advised to expose his developing mind to such a risk,” Vision interrupts them, and Peter’s eyes go impossibly wide. As if he isn’t an enhanced, radioactive spider superhero who’s already fought Captain America and will quickly be preparing to defend earth against an unknown alien invasion the same as the rest of them.
“Hi,” Past-Steve whispers against Tony’s mouth, nosing at his jaw. “What are you doing down here? You’ve been gone for hours.”
Steve flinches away from him and regrets it almost immediately when Tony’s face crumbles. He scoots a bit closer in the chair next to the bed before he gets a hand on the mattress, inches it towards Steve’s. Just a light clasp of fingers, as if Tony thinks he could hurt him if he holds on too tightly.
JARVIS remains quiet as a hologram of Tony appears before Steve in the centre of the shop, projected from some unknown space across the room.
“Sometimes I forget that you’re not the same person I met in the beginning,” she murmurs, then hesitates.
Steve glances up as he finishes and settles his hands on his hips. “I have a meeting with Rhodes. I cancelled the training, but forgot about him.”
“This is what people are talking about when they use the word irony, right? I mean, come on. This is pretty ironic.” Tony circles him for the last time and Steve resists the urge to roll his eyes. He folds his arms over his slight chest, straightens up his back and realizes a beat too late how much that small gesture gives away.
“Bruce, no, you won’t survive a second time!” Tony’s blasting through the sky, a beautiful streak of red and gold against the grey horizon.
Tony’s voice startles Steve and his attention returns with a singular focus when the ticking of the keyboard comes to a sudden stop. Tony rests, setting his hands on the edge of the workbench in a controlled, fluid motion, giving the screen a blank look smeared with the beginnings of distaste.
Steve groans and heaves his massive bulk sideways, crawling back up until he can curve his arms around Tony’s good side and pull him in close. He lays there with his hands stroking over Tony’s chest and belly and traces little patterns in the wiry hair he finds there.
“You’re the one who said everything special about me came from a bottle,” Steve whispers, shifting on his toes. The fist in his shirt twists tighter and Tony grinds his hips forward, the erection trapped in his slacks connecting flush with Steve’s belly.
“Of course, he’s here. You really think that he’d be anywhere else?” A thumb strokes loving circles against his skin and her voice is soft, accepting. “The rest of us may not understand it, Tony. But you two love each other. You always have. I don’t have to like it to know that it’s true.”
Bucky stripped out of his shirt and boxers, gloriously naked before crowding back over him. The gland at the curve of his neck was swelling slightly where it could beneath the metal shoulder joint and Tony traced a finger over it, eyes heavy.
Tony spreads his hands in front of him, gives Steve an expectant look. “If the unchecked rage and emotional immaturity fits?”
Tony is showing him video clips of a spider kid, swinging across the New York skyline in a breathtaking arch. Steve’s stomach flips over as the kid does a flip from one building to the next, landing effortlessly on his feet with a grace that can’t be human.
Sometimes, Steve could hardly believe this was real. When he thought about it too long, it seemed like a fantasy. People didn’t just offer up their bodies to their friends the way Pepper had, but she’d offered and followed through nonetheless. Tony had been right again.
But she never left. Not after the first black eye and the second sprained write. Not when Tony left for MIT and, from his standpoint, there was nothing left to stay for—not that staying for Tony’s sake was ever enough justification in his books. Maria had circled around Howard like he was the sun and she was caught in the orbit of his brilliance. Now, Tony simply wonders if she didn’t have the strength to go on living on her own. Married too young, with no family to speak of and a son thousands of miles away, it’s not a far cry to imagine why she stayed.
“Not tonight,” Steve says with a hand on his chest to stop him. He half-rolls under Tony’s weight and fumbles for the lube under the pillows, pushing it into Tony’s hands with a small smile. “If there’s even a chance this is our last night on earth, you damn well better make it count.”
He’s disoriented and in pain, clawing his way through a jungle of wires pooled on his chest and wrapping up around his cheeks. A canula tickles under his nose and of all the pain radiating through his body, he is distinctly aware of his body already working to force the IV out from his arm. The pink blots of colour on both hands suggest he’s already worked out more than one port.
“I don’t want to, Steve. I don’t want to.” Tony searches his face, jaw tight as arousal wars with doubt and fear, plain as day.
“The metal arm does add a special appeal,” Tony admits, giving Bucky a speculative glance. Bucky rolls his eyes, letting the hood of the car drop shut and shucking the rest of his tools back into Tony’s kit.
It had happened all at once, and Bucky hadn’t done a damned thing to stop it. He was greedy and selfish because he had nothing, didn’t deserve nothing neither, but he wanted it all. He wanted them both, but with Tony it was somehow easier.
“So maybe we could try—I don’t know, just, I want to be better. For you, Tony. Please give me another chance to get this right.”
“Calm down. Breathe.” Tony scented him heavily, wrapping him up in the soothing warmth of acceptance and welcome, of
“Yeah, no, we’re not going to do that.” Steve jumps and jerks towards the sound of Tony’s voice, grunting at the fresh wave of pain.
Something about the way Steve says that filters oddly in the back of Tony’s mind. There’s a resignation that he’s not familiar with. A peace that surprises him. It’s not that he wants Steve to still be hung up on him. Tony has found his own ways to move on too. By now, he’s even been with other people. A few men. Two women. One that was almost important to him.
“Captain Rogers,” FRIDAY says his name with a disdain Tony wasn’t sure AI’s were even capable of, “is currently on the B.A.R.F. floor. He is presently using the software to–”
“Oh good, because I was thinking maybe if it goes over well with the chickens, we could try a dragon next? Nothing too big, just a small one.”
Steve groans and jolts forward, cock leaving a damp trail along the back of Tony’s thigh. Is this really what it can be like for them? The rest of their lives?
If Steve would just hand them over, Tony would cherish them as all the slivers of Steve he’s never seen before. Without a doubt, Tony knows those slivers will fit directly into the cracks in their foundation. The cracks that have been there from the beginning. Resentment ebbs and flows beneath the surface because he gave Steve his own flaws willing, every imperfection, and in many ways, Steve has abused that privilege.
Tony smiles at him, lifting his head up with a grin so bright Steve goes warm all over. “You made it.”
“But how?” Steve had asked, all of seventeen, adjusting to his new presentation as an alpha. The revelation had shocked everyone in his life, most of all himself.
“I do have a question,” Peter says, almost as an afterthought, and Tony offers him an encouraging grunt. “When you say Wizard… do you mean like, Harry Potter wizard or Gandalf wizard?”
Steve rears back to glares up at Tony as the hand on his throat tightens up. Something dark and twisted starting to unravel in his chest.
“If only it was that easy, sour patch.” Tony sighs heavily, the caffeine giving him just enough energy to shuffle over and refill his cup. He leans against the counter, and starts a new pot.
FRIDAY is quiet for a beat. “Impossible to calculate, Boss. But if I could venture a guess, perhaps new data is worth follow up experimentation. Difficult to say if the yield will be similar without further study.” He’s proud of her. Growing every day, and keeping Tony on his toes.
“Wow, this is inappropriate,” Tony’s eyebrows fly up as Steve shrugs him off and shuts the door with a soft
Bucky couldn’t put his finger on it, and Steve, the lump, hadn’t even seemed to notice. Yet something smelled off, too sweet, too sugary, and Tony had never been so absent in the time Bucky had known him.
He considers releasing a statement that there’s been some form of family emergency, which is a ridiculous farce because the entire world knows he has no family. He did once, just for a moment, before it all slipped away from him in Siberia.
“I think I have a few knitted blankets, if you want them, Stark.” Wanda piped up, but there was an underlying warm in her inflection. Being the only other Omega, save Peter who had yet to present, her words didn’t hold the same sharp edge.
Rhodey cackles from across the room while Bucky stares down at him in surprise. He’s worse than Peter, Tony realizes, eating up every inch of the road map that Bucky’s arm shows him. There are so many possible solutions. He could make something so much better than this.
Tony’s arms are at his sides and one pinky is just within reach. Steve could nudge his hand over and touch it. One moment of softness in a sea of brutality.
Pregnancy suited Pepper. In the last few months, she’d grown round and soft with their baby—a little girl, though Steve still wasn’t sure he could believe it. Even when she was uncomfortable, even when she was snapping at Tony and ordering him about, she was perfect.
When the door clicks shut signaling that Steve is finally gone, Tony pulls off the rest of his disheveled clothing and curls onto his side. The tears come hot and heavy and Tony sobs like he hasn’t sobbed since he woke up, in pain and alone, after Siberia.
Tony won’t look at him as he tugs Steve to his feet without grace and shoves him in the direction of the sofa in the corner. The couch connects with his knees and he crumples into a heap, barely avoiding cracking his jaw off the seatback.
Awe blossoms across Tony’s face, and Steve will swear later that he saw a shimmer of tears. And Tony calls him the sap.
Tony’s hand settles over his chest, and Steve closes his eyes and breathes. The air tastes sour in his mouth and sits heavy in his lungs, but the second breath is easier. Then the third. Tony always knows just what to say, just what to do, when Steve sits there, useless, drowning in loss.
“FRIDAY, come on baby, get me some better audio here.” Tony grunts, the pressure of keeping his hold leaving him trembling with effort. The suit is screaming, the air is screaming, somewhere behind him Peter is screaming his way back down to earth but that's good screaming and he’ll be fine. Peter will be safe and everything’s fine.
“I know it’s not what you meant. But it’s true. Being close to you hurts me, Steve. I have never met another person who can hurt me quite like you do. And the fucked-up thing is I love you anyway. That’s not fair.” Tony meets his eye, reaches up, and slides his palm across his face. His thumb traces the hollows under one of Steve’s beautiful eyes before dropping down to do the same to his lips. Steve kisses the pad of his finger. “I don’t deserve this. And you don’t deserve me.”
“No. We can’t.” The words are out of Steve’s mouth too soon, and Tony’s head whips around to stare at him, surprised.
The last thing Tony wants right now is to be held. He swallows a few times around the lump in his throat and watches hurt blossom over Steve’s features.
“Come on, Happy and Pepper are waiting downstairs. They’re going to want to see you in your suit.” Tony claps a hand down on his shoulder, steering him away from the rest of them, away from Steve. Away from all of the conflict and the fighting.
The elevator bell chimes and Steve half expects to see Phil, striding towards him in a pristine suit with laughter teasing at the corner of his eyes. The door opens but the elevator is empty. All of his dreams come with a pinprick of bittersweetness along the edges and Steve’s come to accept that not unlike his life, with immense joy comes red-rims of pain.
“Tony, Tony,” Steve pants into his hair, his ear, capturing the lobe between his teeth as he strokes them off in a hard, unsteady rhythm that makes Tony squirm. “Thought about this, you, every day. Every damn day. Christ, look at you.”
“Anything for you, sweetheart. Wish I’d known how kinky you were from the beginning. You’ve been holding out on me.” Tony smiles, exhausted, and runs fingers through Steve’s sweaty hair.
“It’s not.” Tony kisses the base of his spine. “It’s what you do, but it’s not who you are. Just admit it. You have no fucking idea and that’s what all this is about. You’re too scared to be anything except what everyone expects you to be and you’re tearing everything apart trying to prove that you’re right.”
“It never does. It never does.” Her words are soothing and a little regretful but there’s not a hint of condescension in sight.
The thought makes his skin crawl. But these are his people and he’s not completely alone without Steve. He knows that. He knows that Pepper and Happy won’t take him for granted. Or haven’t so far.
The unthinkable happens, and in the mere seconds between Tony realizing what has to be done and snapping his fingers, he thinks about the moment that he proposed. It seems like a fitting last memory if he has to choose one.
An alien dog smashes into Steve from the side, and his vision tilts as he hits the ground, hard. Time stands still in the moments he tries to fight his way free. A series of bullets rain down overhead, and Bucky’s at his side, metal fingers digging into his bicep as he’s hauled to his feet.
Tony’s maddening like this. Everything about his demeanor is wrong—the walls he’s built around himself as impenetrable as Steve’s shield.
It’s mere seconds before Steve tries to fist his cock again and Tony lets out a hiss of frustration, gripping his wrist and pinning it to the mattress.
They wander back up to the communal space, leaving Tony to a project he absently had claimed to stay and focus on. The second they’re gone he drops into a nearby chair and gives DUM-E a helpless look.
“We have to find the others.” Tony shoves away from him, stumbling unsteadily to his feet. Steve follows him in a body that floats two steps behind, disconnected and disjointed. He catches Tony’s elbow and when he turns him, grief rages in the brown of his eyes and he’s covered, chest to thigh, in dust.
“Which part?” Tony bites out the words. “The idiot wizard? He’s a condescending prick and you’d hate him. Actually, scrap that, you’d
“Oh, well that changes everything, doesn’t it! You’re sorry! So what? Apologies don’t bring my parents back, Steve. It doesn’t undo all the time you’ve been lying to me. It doesn’t give me back all the time I could have spent tracking down your fucking
“I mean, you could have seen me last week if you’d shown up for DUM-E’s birthday,” He teased and was rewarded with a chastising gasp. “But I suppose being a hot-shot CEO means you’re extra busy these days.”
“Nah,” Steve brushes off the offer, stepping through into the mansion. If he’d thought the opulence of the penthouse was something, this was a whole different world. All open concept and horribly modern but still with something distinctly comforting about the living room. The large fireplace and comfortable seating feel like a long-awaited welcome home.
Going back to an original hallmark, he throws a chilled, “fuck you, Rogers,” over his shoulder for good measure.
Tony snorts, as dry and sarcastic as a snort can be. “Is that what we’re calling it? You want to know how many broken ribs you’ve got, Steve? Ask me. Go on, ask me how many.”
Tony had just cackled, laying a hand on his shoulder as he passed. An unexpected zing of heat startled along Steve’s spine and that night he’d dreamt about Tony touching him in a very different way entirely.
Steve moans, biting down until he can feel his teeth grind together. Spit drips down between his legs and pools on the flat surface. It should be uncomfortable, sitting in the cooling little puddle but now, like this, it only escalates the pleasure.
Tony’s hair would be soft, greying more every day, with the spicy smell of his cologne wafting up from the curve of his neck. Steve would press his face into that space, close his eyes and just breathe. Steve would be home.
“Coulson designed it,” Tony corrects. “But I’m going to improve it. First things first, no goddamn buckles. And tighter pants.”
Now, in the middle of the absurdly large nest he had created for his Alphas, it almost felt like a betrayal of who he truly was. That of all people, it wasn’t fair he had been dealt so many difficult cards, only to succumb to
“Peter’s almost as much of a genius as yours truly,” Tony supplies, when Bucky’s looking a little dazed and confused, his arm being accosted now by two deft hands.
Guilt mixes with remorse and regret and grief and loss and Tony slams the door shut on all of it. Focus on Peter. Peter needs you right now.
After everything that’s just happened, Steve still manages to flush, a sweet spread of rose spotting across his cheeks. Tony could spend the rest of his life trying to make Steve blush for him that way, and his grin must give him away because Steve leans forward, presses his forehead against Tony’s, and huffs a small, indignant breath against his mouth.
Immediately, Steve is right on the edge. He claws desperately at the desk, legs tense around Tony’s shoulders, kicking a heal between Tony’s shoulder blades. “Stop, stop! Tony, stop, I’ll—”
He falls hard to his knees, gasping as he pitches out of the chair. He’s been sitting long enough that when the glasses are ripped off his face, nausea bubbles up and the abrupt bright lights blind him.
“Tony!” Steve says, appalled. Bucky and Tony both whirl to look at him, grinning at the horrified expression on his face. Bucky throws a greasy arm around Tony’s shoulder, smearing a patch across his cheek while Tony shoves at his immovable metal arm, indignant.
Why was he empty? He couldn’t remedy the sensation with the bliss in his mind. Warm satisfied fizzles of aftershocks fluttered along his spin and everything was perfect except he was...
“Fuck me. Come on Steve, fuck me. Oh, oh fuck I’m going to—” Tony’s teeth grind together when he clenches down hard, as if he can bite back the pleasure and Steve’s name, together. He spills hot and wet across his stomach and Steve fucks him through it at a brutal pace, not letting up when he starts to whine and force him back with a hand on the hip.
The air around them feels thick and heavy. This Tony isn’t the same willing, crazed participant he usually is, but it’s almost sweeter this way.
There’s nothing left and Steve knows it. The physical manifestation of being back in this broken, cursed body is just the last nail in the coffin.
Thanos disappears. Everything goes silent, cut through with the murmur of disbelief. This must be what victory sounds like.
Tears threatened behind his eyes. This was what Steve had been waiting for; being joined with Tony again after so long. It was a desperate form of agony he’d never experienced before.
It was just large enough for his hand to slide inside, a ridiculous little caricature of what Iron Man had been. The eyes were too large, taking up too much of the face plate, and the arc reactor in the centre of the chest was the wrong shade of blue. Steve should know; he’d mixed acrylics into that perfect, cerulean blue light countless times over the last few years.
, Steve. Do you understand that? How fucked that is? And even if you hadn’t, you lied. For years. Not weeks, not months. Goddamn years.” Tony balls his hands into fists at his sides. His voice is too loud and people are staring from across the street, peering over their glasses at the insane man screaming on the sidewalk. But he can’t seem to stop. “How dare you!”
Tony picks up the pace, biting down on Steve’s lip as something desperate wriggles free and explodes between them. Tony fucks into him until Steve doesn’t have to worry about all the years they’ve wasted. Everything pales in comparison to this moment, right now, and the way that Tony’s hand comes down to wrap around his cock, slick with lube and the precome leaking steadily from the tip to pump him in times with his thrusts.
The hard-won ground that Ross has managed to hold onto is slipping away right before Tony’s eyes. Whispers of addendums and rewrites and complete overhauls have been ongoing over the past few weeks, at least. Tony isn’t privy to all the private conversations that are being had behind closed doors.
Tony stops listening because Peter’s jumped right into a whole slew of potential solutions. He settles across from Nat at the dinner table, eyes flicking back and forth to the door, watching for Steve.
Bucky threw a leg over Tony’s hip, pulling him back from the circle of Steve’s arms until he was pressed against his chest. The possessive act made the Alpha instincts in him swell, the urge to grab Tony back taking Steve by surprise. Except a moment later, Bucky’s metal fingers were twining into his own, tucked their combined hands up under the smaller man’s chest. The urge dissipated as quick as it had come.
“What do you think, darlin’?” Bucky drawled, arching his back and putting himself, and the outfit, on display.
Tony peels off the corner and a small sheet of paper, barely bigger than a scratchpad falls onto the counter. A print photograph—who prints photographs anymore?—is tucked inside and he ignores it, favouring the odd piece of mail.
One of Bucky’s hands wormed its way down between them, pushing his own restrictive pants off as Steve’s hands slid up his ribs.
, so he collects his scattered thoughts, smacks Rhodey’s hands away harder than he needs to with the gauntlet, and strides out of the gym. His first instinct is to curl up in his workshop with a new project and a bottle, but he’s on scouting duty with Natasha that evening. Fuck if he’ll give her that sort of satisfaction.
Barnes blinks and says nothing, not that Tony is paying anymore attention. He’s digging his fingers into Peter’s shoulder, feeling that the kid is trembling, and steering him into the elevator.
Her voice is thick and watery, her hands digging into his back as if she’s trying to convince herself this is real the same way Steve is.
When Tony finally sees them, it’s two days later which appears to have been just enough time for everyone to have readjusted, but not enough time for Tony to be able to yank himself out of his massive hangover. It’s actually a couple massive hangovers because he doesn’t start from scratch, he just starts reinvesting in the buzz midday.
Clint gives him a look, passing them in the foyer, but Steve shakes his head, tucking Tony closer against his chest and leading him up the stairs. As he settles him onto bed, Tony lets Steve curl around him. He feels small and vulnerable, relaxing in small increments as Steve waits, stroking soft fingers up and down his ribcage.
“Yes, okay? Yes, I know you trust me, and I didn’t question that for a minute. I just wanted to have some hot, rough sex with my fiancé, not a heart-to-heart.”
“Peter’s a good kid.” Steve eventually offers when some of the Avengers have thinned out and it’s getting harder and harder to ignore each other. “He cares about you a great deal.”
“What are you doing? Peter!” Tony sounds outraged, but Steve ignores him. As long as he doesn’t get his hands on it, Steve can fix this.
“You love this tie,” Steve curls his hand over Tony’s again, linking their fingers together, and Tony yanks his hand back, pulling off and finally looking up to meet Steve’s eyes. Intimacy is the absolute last thing Tony wants, but seeing the concern in Steve’s gaze momentarily catches him off guard.
Until the fix stopped and Tony had gone into a withdrawal that had left him broken and bleeding, wrapped in hospital wires and gauze bandages for weeks. A withdrawal that had almost killed him and had lasted longer than any bender ever had.
He tugs on Steve’s tie again. The fabric creaks and whines under the strain, bringing Steve down to avoid ripping the fabric. Tony feels trapped, breathing coming sharper with Steve hovering above him and he squeezes his eyes shut to try and remember the first time they were together instead. The first time that Steve filled him like this, gazing into his eyes, breathing into his mouth,
For a minute Steve blinks up at Tony, waiting for him to disappear, but Tony just reaches out a hand and hauls him to his feet.
Bucky fretted for the better part of the afternoon as it turned into evening, fluttering and pacing in a way Steve hadn’t seen since, well, before the war. It wasn’t unlike the way Bucky would worry after him when the winter months set in and pneumonia threatened around every corner.
team again. More and more, Tony finds himself asking FRIDAY where everyone is only to learn that Wanda and Vision and Scott and Natasha are piled in the communal living room with Steve and Barnes, watching a movie or sharing a meal.
“We’re just calling about Tony.” Bucky explained. “He’s been acting a bit off the past few days and he’s not down in the shop. Our codes don’t seem to be working. FRIDAY says he’s at Stark Industries. Have you heard from him?”
Steve moans around his cock and Tony laughs, tugging at the lobe of his ear because Steve’s thinking something decidedly dirtier than Tony had meant, before sliding his hand back to cup the back of Steve’s head and hold him in place. He’ll die here, in Steve’s mouth, his aching cock brushing the back of Steve’s throat as he works up to taking him deeper. Steve’s always been a marvel at sucking cock, taking Tony all the way in and keeping him there, until Tony’s shivering and trembling, frantic with desire but not ready to let go.
Somehow, they manage to get through unscathed and then Pepper is there, setting her hand on his forearm and leading him off the stage. The frequency of her touches isn’t lost on him, and Tony knows exactly what she’s about. Pepper always knows what he needs, even before he realizes it himself.
But it’s too much, too soon, and he’d give anything to get off of this emotional rollercoaster and slide into their bed even if there hasn’t been a ‘
He presses the door open and peers inside. Tony is leaning against the Deere, not a tool in sight with the plaid shirt pulled back up over his shoulders. He looks even more ragged than when they’d fought earlier, and Steve steels himself for the worst.
Steve takes an even breath and Tony can all but see the count he works through in his head before he’s turning off on the nearest exit, and pulling the car to a stop on a country road Tony’s never driven down before.
Tony narrows his eyes and points with the index finger on his good hand. “So you do have an opinion?”
And okay, maybe he deserves that, because he hadn’t really given Steve the time of day. Tony had written him off entirely after everything, his rage and bitterness too strong to reign in and so he’d let it loose and hurt them both even more in the process.
“Sorry, you just startled me,” Tony offers, hoping that Steve will ignore it all, keep walking, and let him off the hook. It’s the least Steve could do, right?
“You lied to him,” Bucky says. “You never told him what I did to his parents, and then when the Accords happened, you fought. He left you after that. He married Pepper and they had their little girl. That’s what was real, Steve.”
Steve blinks and keeps blinking. The tears fall freely over his face, and no matter how many times he closes his eyes, all he can see is Tony.
Steve hardly gives Nick Fury a passing glance as they cross paths outside the entrance to the Barton’s barn. One of Fury’s eyebrows quirks up at his tone, but he keeps his silent spy master observations to himself and continues up the path to the house.
Tony sighs heavily, nudging DUM-E away until he wheeled back over to his charging port. Another exhausting day in their march towards the end of the world.
Licking his lips, Steve tried to reign in his desire. It’d been so long since he’d seen Tony, touched him, been near him like this. There was so much they had to talk about.
He blinks rapidly, over and over again, thinking that this Steve will disappear any second now. Except he draws closer every time Tony opens his eyes and it sounds like Steve is calling his name.
If history has taught him anything, he has at least a couple more hours before Rhodey gets worried enough to start forcing his way through doors. He decides to ignore him, because if he calls, Rhodey will know. Of course he’ll know, because he always knows.
— curls up under him, back arching like a cat, chasing the sensation as if Steve’s about to steal his fingers back any second.
Ross was a politician. Politicians were unpredictable, self-serving, and ultimately, relied on teams such as theirs to continue to function. Creating a pariah of Captain America had been a massive error for the Secretary of State.
“It’s better than it was a few weeks ago,” he lands on, simply because it’s the truth. “Things with Barton and Nat are a lot better. You’ll probably get on great with Clint–which I’m going to hate by the way–fair warning. Barnes isn’t so bad. A little bit gruff but if I’d been a P.O.W. for seventy years I’d probably be a bit rougher around the edges too.”
Tony ran Rhodey through the sequencing protocols slowly and purposefully, letting Rhodey practice interrupting the system which was the more significant responsibility, in the event of something going wrong. He fielded a few wayward questions, before they were calling it an afternoon and Tony suggested a round through the massage chairs in the self-care room before they returned to the daily grind.
Peter offered up a set of three personalized fire extinguishers that had everyone in stitches. They were a mixture of shapes and sizes, all bright patterns and fully up to code for DUM-E to have a selection to choose from the next time Tony was closed to lighting something, or himself, on fire.
Steve would come like a rocket, pumping streak after delicious streak into Tony’s body as he leaked slick over his thighs, trickling down both their legs. Bucky’s name tumbling from both their lips until Steve’s own throat was raw with it.
“You need to breathe, Steve. Take a deep breath,” Pepper is repeating the same two sentences over and over again which seems odd until Steve realizes it’s because he’s holding air in his lungs and refusing to let it go. As if exhaling would mean admitting that Tony is gone.
JARVIS tries to say something more but it gets lost in the white static screaming in Steve’s ears. Everything is cold and Steve hadn’t realized anything would ever hurt more than freezing to death.
Tony kisses him again, grinning against his mouth. “So, let’s review. You die and the first thing you want is to play with my bots and get fucked? You’re one hell of a man, Steve.”
Tony kisses her cheek, letting his lips linger when Happy protests behind her—they’re too close, it’s not appropriate anymore—then steps past her and kisses him next, making him flush. Happy wraps Tony into a surprisingly thick, tight hug and holds on a beat too long.
Just when Steve thinks he’s getting his bearings, tugging Tony in with a fist in the centre of his shirt, Tony’s hands go gentle along the side of his face. The pads of Tony’s thumbs brush Steve’s jaw, holding him like something precious and delicate. He licks into Steve’s mouth like he intends to swallow Steve whole, then sighs as if Steve is the sweetest thing he’s ever tasted. Sweeter than the dessert, and the only sustenance Tony needs.
Steve groaned, gripping Tony at the nape of his neck and forcing his face up for a long, satisfying kiss. If that was what Tony really wanted…
Steve had promised to accompany him to another dull gala that Tony hadn’t been able to get out of. He also remembers how bad he’d felt at the time, asking if he should be suspicious but knowing that he could trust Steve to provide that honest reassurance without batting an eye. Pushing that feeling down, telling himself that there was nothing to be jealous over, or insecure about, because his foundation with Steve was solid, and he’d never known a depth of love like this before.
“Maybe we should get an alpaca,” Tony suggests, nose buried in his tablet while Steve reads the same line, over and over again in the newspaper. He hums without commitment. It’s Tony’s newest thing, these animals. They’ve accumulated half a farm in their backyard, and Tony loves them all.
“Well, we can’t have that,” Steve mutters to himself, shaking his head, but excitement zips underneath his skin as he crosses the parking garage. The few dozen floors to the communal floor feel like hours until Steve’s stepping into the living room, his team standing around Tony in a half-circle with varying degrees of expressions, unimpressed and amused.
It was good to have Bucky there, that friendship deep and renewed yet somehow different. It wasn’t that Steve hadn’t thought about what had been there before. But things had changed, and Bucky had changed too.
Steve’s letting him have this. Letting him have him, when he’s vulnerable and raw, when Tony has been less than perfect and hardly deserves it by half. But Steve’s giving this to him, handing over the reins and giving him control. For a man like Steve, it’s a gift Tony cherishes with everything that he is.
“You are not fine.” The anger in Tony’s voice tremors just beneath the calm. “You are absolutely not fine. Are you in pain? Be honest, because they can push more pain meds if you—”
Beside him, one hip against the edge of the examination bed, Steve is silent. His face is an unreadable mask and for the first time, Tony sees just how advanced Steve’s poker face has become. He gives nothing away, not even when they’re in the car driving towards the mansion with one hand on Tony’s knee.
“Hey.” Bucky’s deep, sleep-drunk timbre was a gruff interruption from behind Tony, and Steve hid a guilty smile in the curve of Tony’s neck.
After Tony has said goodbye to Rhodey, his suitcase stowed away in the town car that will take him to the private airfield, he checks out of the hotel and makes one last stop.
Steve was able to order around the corpse of his soulmate—give the suit posthumous orders without even realizing—all because of a snide comment made in anger Steve rarely thought about? All because Natasha had gotten things wrong and Fury had been a bit more of a bastard than usual with his delivery?
Outside the Clerk’s Office, he pauses, just for a minute. The sun is a touch too warm over the layers of the suit and as he glances up at the unimposing doors, he can’t help but wonder how many people have walked through these doors, only to walk out alone. Maybe in more ways than one.
Now, their song wafts through the Compound, and Steve can’t hold back the tears as Tony looks into his eyes and tells him every way he has and will love him for the rest of their lives. He hopes that this feeling never fades, that Tony’s love is always shocking in its vastness, and that until the day he dies, Tony will always steal the breath from his lungs and breathe life back into his body with just a passing glance.
Sleep greets him like a gentle, early-autumn breeze and he falls asleep wrapped in the safety of Steve’s arms.
And Steve… Steve bursts into tears, collapsing in on himself until he’s folded in two, forehead pressed against Tony’s knuckles while giant sobs tremor like earthquakes through his body. His grief washes over them both as if Tony will be able to hold him in place through the typhoon. They’re both washed away, the tears slipping in silence down Tony’s own cheek as he squeezes those long, thick fingers over and over again.
The best thing about Pepper is that she doesn’t push and she accepts him exactly as he is, flaws and all. Hell, she’s seen them all already.
He sinks in with one fluid motion, shoving one of Tony’s knees up to his chest and watching the breath whoosh out of him. He's tight. It must burn, but the urgency bursts into fierce desperation. Just like that very first time, Steve rolls them over until Tony’s on top of him, helping Tony ride him as if it's their last night on Earth.
, Tony thinks, as Sam’s voice chases them down the hallway. But what he would pay to see the look on Steve’s face when one of his own challenges him.
Tony squeezes his eyes shut, everything in him revolting against the offer and the open love she’s laying down at his feet. “I don’t know what to do.”
Steve holds the door open for him and Tony steps through. They don’t touch, he’s careful of that. They haven’t touched since the last time Steve laid his hand over the whole of the arc reactor and pressed his fingertips into the scar tissue he helped to create. Sure, they’ve seen each other. A handful of times before everything went to shit.
As she shakes her head, laughing, Tony gives a soft command to J.A.R.V.I.S. and music wafts down from the speakers. It’s a bluesy tune that he remembers from the war and Tony offers up an arm.
Steve doesn’t bother smiling at his poor attempt at humour, always so black and white in his stoicism. He half collapses into the chair at Tony’s hip, dragging it closer but pausing with a hand hovering over Tony’s own on the bed to wait for permission. Tony watches in confusion as Steve slowly lowers his hand back into his lap, face a mask of pain and unrestrained desperation, but doesn’t touch him.
He shoved the thoughts away, yanking himself back from the inevitable slippery slope of imagining Tony’s voice. There were sick places in the back of his mind—that much he could admit—and he was ashamed that he kept indulging them.
He drags his heavy eyes up only to lose himself in Tony’s gaze. Steve drowns in him and as Tony leans forward and presses his lips to Steve’s forehead, warm breath wafts over his face and wraps around him like a blanket. He feels like less than dirt but Tony loves him anyway.
“More sleep for everyone!” Tony pulled the sheet up under his chin until it was draped across all three of them, and he was only a tuft of chocolate brown hair peeking out.
Of course, Steve had smelled it, but he also hadn’t been prepared to tell Tony that he smelled that scent all the time. That smell was second nature to his own after all these years. It lived right beneath his skin, torturing him and wracking him with guilt when he was wrapped up in their bed. Wrapped up in Tony’s arms.
“Please, I never meant—I’m sorry. Let’s just—we can talk about this. I came home so we could talk. So we could fix us.” He hesitated, searching Tony’s face. “Please don’t make me go. Tell me how to make this right. Please, Tony. I’m so sorry.”
With a singular focus, he tugs at Steve’s belt and yanks it open, shoving his pants and underwear down as Steve lifts his hips. Steve’s already hard, erection thick and dripping, jutting proudly from a short swatch of dark blond hair.
For a moment, he paused, his mouth dropping open and his fingers constricting further into the sheets. He looked beautiful, sated and blissed out, with pleasure smeared across his face.
“Sergeant Barnes has spent decades as a Prisoner of War for the most deranged sect of Nazis this century has ever seen. Sergeant Barnes has been subjected to a level of torture you and I can’t even imagine, Mr. Secretary.” Tony pauses to draw a breath, keeping his voice as even and steady as he can, “Sergeant Barnes is a
Faintly, Steve wonders if the grip he has locked on Tony’s waist is tight enough to hurt, but Tony doesn’t seem to mind. He just kisses Steve again and again, mouths meeting in a first dance that turn wetter and sloppier as the desperation starts to leak from Steve’s pores. It feels like the earth is going to give way and crumble underneath him.
“Perfect, I’m never making anything fancy again then. From here on out, everything will be boiled or overcooked and the only seasoning will be salt. Maybe pepper, but only if you’re really good.” Steve winced immediately; the innuendo landing heavily between them.
“Just, whatever Rogers, I told you I don’t care what you have to say, no matter what it is. Even if you just want to thank me. I couldn’t care less, understand?” He spits the last word at him.
Tony moans in his ear and slows his movements, letting Steve feel every slick drag of his cock as it works back into his body. Everything is reduced to where they’re joined and the aching spots Tony’s fingers are leaving on his hips.
Tony clamps a firm seal over the part of him that wants to hop onto the defensive, to remind Steve that he’d had no reason to give him the time of day anyhow. He reminds himself of the closed door in his face and takes a breath, letting Steve’s actions speak for him.
“It’s a very pretty asshole.” Rhodey wrinkles his nose and Tony snorts a dry laugh, “I don’t care how he was looking at me. He doesn’t get it. He probably thinks I’m doing it for him. Whatever, it doesn’t matter now. I’ll serve him the papers before we go.”
“It looks like you’re not going to give me much of a choice,” Tony nods with a hint of sarcasm towards the closed door that Steve is still blocking with his oversized body.
mates? Except Tony’s fear was that it wouldn’t be that easy; that he’d somehow get stuck, partially bonded to only one of them because triads were rare and the research was vague, or even that Bucky might not even be able to bond at all and be left behind.
“Whenever you want.” Steve promises gently, tugging on Tony’s hands to draw him in closer. He runs a linger hand down to stroke across Tony’s chest, resting it flat on the soft curve of his belly. Glancing at his mouth, Steve leans in but hesitates before he kisses him this time.
The white, sheet-covered mass that was Tony disappeared from view and in that moment, Steve thought to ask if they’d take him too, because they belonged together. Hadn’t Tony just promised him they’d be together, always? Steve had to go too.
Sometimes he thinks about the family he might’ve had with Steve, when Morgan’s brown eyes peer up at him and her face cracks into a smile. When in his dreams he can hear her voice calling out
“Take her,” Pepper says, already shifting their daughter towards him. “Go on, she’s yours. This is what you’ve been waiting for.”
But then he was scrambling away, taking the warmth of his body with him as he got tangled deeper into the sheets. Tony gasped and the horrified, broken noise shot through Steve’s chest like a bullet tearing through skin and bone.
Except then Steve had put a plane down in the ice, and woken up seventy years into the future with vanilla clinging to his skin, torturing him in the most devastating way. Alpha-Alpha relationships, though few and far between, were accepted and respected for the most part and his heart sagged in his chest under the weight of his loss.
Steve stumbles his way through his own vows, the fearless leader and motivational speaker in him left behind because Tony Stark is marrying Steve Rogers, and Steve Rogers never really had a way with words. When he finally finishes, he watches with wet eyes while Tony slides the vibranium wedding band onto his fingers and makes promises that sound simple on his lips: to love Steve, to cherish him, and to do things together, always.
“If it’s Parker, I think we’re the perfect people for him. You know, he’s had a terrible run so far. No parents, his aunt and uncle have been raising him since he was a kid, and his uncle was shot in an armed robbery right in front of him last year. Who knows a traumatized superhero better than we do?”
Why was he doing this? What kind of sick punishment was this supposed to be? If anything, maybe Tony should have known, that pushing Steve away wouldn’t actually stop him, just leave him stumbling into something more. This mockery of self-flagellation.
He doesn’t want to lose him. Not like this. Not when they’re angry and hurting and taking it out on each other.
Steve swallows down the lump in his throat, giving Bucky a watery half-smile. How in the hell is he going to make it through the ceremony? How is he going to read his
Sometimes there was no need for talking at all. Steve would let himself luxuriate in the feeling of Tony in his arms, trading a lifetime’s worth of lazy kisses, long overdue.
Steve seems to consider that for a moment, rolling Tony’s words around in his mind and translating them into a language that suits him best.
After all they went through to get him. Gone again. Dust on Steve fingertips. When he can’t look anymore, Steve crawls into bed next to Tony.
Clint shrugged. “So? We can have steaks on Saturday and then Steve can make them again three weeks from now. Stark can afford it.”
There’s the briefest sensation of Steve’s palm covering the arc reactor but he can’t feel the tips of his fingers lost around the edges.
But he doesn’t. Steve gives a deliberate, measured nod, releasing the door and venturing one step closer. “I promise.”
“What do you want me to say, here?” Rhodes asks in a tone that makes Steve bristle. “If this doesn’t have your daddy issues written all over it, I don’t know what does. Do you want a supportive best man? Or a getaway car? Whatever you want, it’s yours.”
“Tony, please.” It’s only a little bit desperate, but Tony finds it in his heart to take pity on him and leans up to kiss him on the mouth, lingering a beat longer than usual.
Steve runs a hand through his too-long hair, a lock falling forward when he shifts to scratch at the side of his beard. Tony wants to trace his fingertips across it and feel the rough scrape of Steve under his palms.
Steve lets Tony’s cock slide out of his mouth and scrambles backward on the bed, tugging at his belt and shoving his pants off with a speed Tony assumes must be unique to super-soldiers. For a moment he tries to remember when the last time he’s had Steve like this is, and he falters, fumbling with a bottle of lube pried out of his luggage. It’s been so long since he’s been inside Steve and they both know that this means something, Tony can see it on Steve’s face as clear as day.
Steve shifted, pressing Tony’s thighs higher. Fingers teased where Steve’s thrusting into him – Bucky – and Tony was hit with an intense wave of lust as Bucky’s fingers disappeared again and Steve arched forward.
This is about closure, and feeling good. Steve wants to feel better right? And it’s been ninety-two days since Tony’s last felt good.
“Here, let me—” Steve reaches down between them, a difficult task from where he has Tony folded in half with his knees up by his ears, fucking into him with a pace that’s borderline cruel. Before he can get a hand around Tony’s cock, Tony slaps him away and distracts him with his tongue forced into Steve’s mouth.
He repeats the words over and over until at least a small portion of his mind believes it and he can relax by a hair’s margin. By then, the movie has ended, and Peter has thrown an awkward arm around him in a half-hug that’s over too soon before he trundles off to bed.
Tony reaches out towards the bottle of scotch and pours himself another drink, bigger than the others.
Steve lets out a heavy breath through his nose and reminds himself why he’s here. This is Tony, his partner. His brand-new husband. They’ve muddled their way through everything else, and they’re going to make it through this one too.
“I didn’t mean to,” Steve forced out, the words like glass in his throat. “Tony, I saw the pills and I couldn’t wake you so I thought—”
Shifting up higher on the mattress, Tony fumbles for the tube of lube he’s shoved into the bedside table; a pathetic hope that he might get lucky or at the very least have the urge to re-familiarize himself with his own hand.
Bucky’s teasing voice broke through and Steve flushed, heat splattering across his cheeks, which only made Bucky’s smirk widen into a wolfish grin. “Care to share with the class?”
God, Tony loves when they can laugh like this. When sex is playful and meaningful and so incredibly deep and they don’t need to fuck each other fast and dirty. Not that he complains when Steve fucks into him like it’s their last moments on earth. But this… this is something else entirely.
“Steve, no offense, but I’d really feel more comfortable with you at my head,” Pepper says, and he snaps back to himself, forcing his feet to move until he’s got her other hand in both of his. They flank her on either side, and over the top of her head, Tony smiles at him.
With a mixture of experimentation and a battle of who could produce the grosser foods, Steve felt like he was finally finding his way out of the darkness; stepping into a present that brought with it a sense of friendship and belonging he hadn’t anticipated.
“Natasha,” Steve gasped when he could bear it, curling his fists around nothing and fighting to see her through a fresh curtain of tears that swam before his eyes. “Natasha, please don’t let them take him.”
“You’re beautiful.” Steve turns and smiles at him, something so warm and hopeful dancing in the blue of his eyes that Tony almost forgets that he can have this now. Steve. After all the wanting, it’s happening.
Someone’s drugged him. They must have had to sedate him even though that never lasts for long and doing it now feels selfish. Steve already knows there isn’t enough sedation in the world to take away the pain of
He can’t even remember the last time he’s been held. Maybe not since she’d come to see him in recovery, after the bunker. Had it really been so long since another person had touched him? Held him close?
“Tony, oh my god.” Something wet splashes against Tony’s cheek and he startles, eyes flying open when he realizes that Steve is crying. The little droplets are rolling down his cheeks, even as he tries to keep his eyes open, and Tony almost gags, his throat closing up as tears threaten behind his eyes.
Steve suddenly lurches off-balance when Tony tugs him down for a kiss, vibrating with an eager energy that’s infectious. Then Tony pulls back and gives Peggy a lascivious smile that makes Steve’s cheeks heat. “Want to compare notes, Pegs?”
Tony didn’t look up, a hand covering his face with his fingers digging into his forehead. When he didn’t answer, Steve forced his useless legs to move and pushed himself through the door, lingering just outside the entrance. He leaned his head against the wall and listened to the shallow stutter of Tony’s breathing.
“Morgan?” He asks as Tony steps through the doorway to their old bedroom at the Compound. Steve’s already in bed, pajama covered legs tucked under the blanket, bare-chested. Exhaustion is purple underneath Tony’s eyes, but his gaze is soft.
Over Pepper’s shoulder, Tony’s eyes find Steve’s. He only just makes out what she’s saying, the ringing in his ear a fitting companion to the burning that licks at the right side of his body. There are tears in Steve’s eyes. He’s staggering to his knees.
The air in Steve’s chest threatens to strangle him. At some point, one he can’t even remember now, Steve had brought Tony coffee for the last time.
For a lot of reasons, that doesn’t actually make Tony feel any better. Picking sides is what got everyone into this mess and he doesn’t want that. Not really. If anything, he just wants everyone not to be so against
He’s not ready. This can’t be real. It can’t be real because it’s too soon. There’s still more he has to do, people he has to look after. It has to be a mistake.
Tony jolts awake too soon, a hard-on rampant and demanding attention between his thighs for the first time in months.
Somehow, the gesture means more to him than the conversation. It leaves him aching, a little more feeling than he’d anticipated doing today. When his mind drifts to the next natural though–a stiff drink would be too easy a cure for the flurry of emotional butterflies colliding in his stomach–he fumbles his phone out of his pocket and runs his hand across the cool, flat screen.
It’s a matter of principle, because it’s hard not to hate a man who strides into a high-level security,
He reaches into his sweats and fists himself, rough and dry. It’s too tight but in seconds he’s coming hard, thinking about Steve’s bright blue eyes and the sweet taste of his mouth.
Tony moans, loud and long, his grip tightening up until only the red flush of his cockhead peaks out between his fingers, dripping a steady stream. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Get me there. Come on, harder. Steve,
“Sure, Bucky.” Steve smiles at the floor, forcing the muscles in his cheeks into the unfamiliar position. “Whatever you gotta do.”
Steve chokes, gasping in a breath as if he can’t get enough air and staggers under the weight of what Tony has said, as if Tony has struck him.
Tony is absolutely covered in come and the way that now makes him feel sick sits heavy in his stomach; a stark contrast to a reel of beautiful, technicolour memories of what it once meant to feel owned. Marked.
Steve had followed Tony’s remains across the U.S., spending too many days sitting at the base of the Tower in New York and lying in the grass in the Malibu sun. After Pepper and Morgan had travelled back to the city at the end of the summer, Steve had even let himself rest, his legs dangling off the dock at Lake Tahoe. As he stared up at the shuttered lakehouse the water had slowly turned his toes blue until he’d been forced to turn away.
“Hey, come on now, wake up. You’re alright, Tony. Wake up.” He jostled his shoulder a few more times without success.
Steve chokes on a breath, fucking into Tony as hard as he dares and using the headboard for leverage. Sometimes, Steve’s terror of a soulmate likes to up the stakes like this, just for the sake of healthy competition, and Steve knows Tony is grinning because the explosion of red, white and blue fireworks at Tony’s left wrist are glowing, warm to the touch.
“You—” Tony shudders, his body going rigid and he convulses like he’s touched a live wire. The live wire is plugged right into his goddamn arm. “Don’t let me go, Steve.”
Reaching out and touching Steve is his first big mistake, because he can’t pat his arm without squeezing to ground him and stepping into his space. Steve’s arms wrap around him and he thinks about pulling away, he really does, but he watches in disbelief as his arm slides up to wrap around Steve’s neck and pull him down.
Tony’s mind screamed and twisted away from it, the bond in the back of his mind snapping and exploding into a million tiny shards. What was left of the connection to Steve was torn away from him and for a second there was nothing – he was alone – what?
He spins around with both of his hands up, sweat dripping into his eyes from where the faceplate has peeled back and blurring vision that’s already tunnelled with rage and panic. The repulsors crackle and glow a dangerous amber. If only Steve would just push him a little further. Give him an excuse.
A few days after the cabbage rolls, Steve was ready for a new challenge. He’d been working his way up to asking Tony about one of his favourite dishes, prepared to make him something decadent and maybe Italian.
Tony ignores him, mouth moving on to his throat as he pops the button on his jacket and tugs Steve’s shirt out of his pants. Manhandling him away from the wall, Tony shoves him down onto one of the chairs beside the small table and drops to his knees.
Tony gives him a nudge and Steve lands on his back on the mattress, crowding up against Tony’s side and offering an arm for Tony to curl into. “‘Thank you,’ he says. Comes here, fucks my brains out in the best sex I’ve had in my goddamn life and all he has to say is ‘
They look so pleasantly domestic like this, both still in sleepwear, relaxed and content. For a moment he wonders if maybe… but no, he’ll ask later when Steve is there for safety purposes. He’s got some self-preservation left in him.
Steve’s told him about Barnes after the debacle on the helicarriers, but this is the first time Tony’s caught a glimpse of him.
“I’m sorry!” He shouted, eyes blurring with tears. Tony shook his head, forehead pressed into his forearms, rolling back and forth miserably. “Tony I would never! I didn’t mean to!”
“You’re full of surprises today, Captain. What’s one more?” As Tony nudges at Steve’s shoulder, he goes willingly.
Steve slid a hand down his chest, pulling the zipper of the hoodie down as he went and imaging it was Tony’s hands on him. Tony’s hands, creeping up under the bottom of his shirt, pinching one of his nipples and Tony leaning over him, breathing hot air into his mouth. Arousal stretched bowstring tight in the pit of Steve’s stomach and he swallowed, relaxing into the mattress and giving himself over to the coiling heat.
“I want to watch him fuck you, filling you up with those metal fingers before he pounds you into the mattress. Oh fuck, you’d be so gorgeous together. Two beautiful alphas, all for me.”
It’s a lot of doom and gloom, centering around some megalomaniac who is convinced he knows what’s best for the entire galaxy. Tony wonders how many times Steve could punch the alien in the face before the end of the world.
He doesn’t grace that with a reply because ‘just as much as it’s hurting me’, really? Steve can’t possibly think that.
And finally, the reality seems to settle over Tony too. Grief spills out of him, red and desolate. They’ve been bleeding all over each other for weeks.
Tony glances back at the photograph and sighs. He wonders how much more there is to the story and lets himself imagine, only for a moment, what exactly this could mean. It’s probably for the best that he’ll never know.
He bites down, hard, sucking the blood from Steve’s lip before thrusting his tongue into his mouth to lick behind his teeth. Tony’s breathing goes ragged, and his hands don’t stop tugging to get away. It’s as if his body and mind are at war, and Steve is bound to be the casualty between them.
“He looked me over and told Pepper, ‘I want one’ after he finished drooling all over my shoes.” Natasha laughs. “God, you were such a pig, remember?”
For a moment, Steve’s completely disoriented. His nails scramble against the floor as he tries to reach for the glasses. He has to go back. He has to try again because maybe this time he’ll get it right. One of these times, he’s got to be able to get it right.
They’ve tried already. Once. It ended in a screaming match followed by Tony drinking himself into a stupor and secluding himself in his workshop for weeks afterward. Pepper had had to drag him away while making a vague threat to commit him if he didn’t start taking better care of himself. It had been a joke, but the fear in her eyes seemed real enough.
“Dr. Strange couldn’t tell us much about the threat, only that it’ll be here in a few weeks time and it will devastate the world, if we’re not ready. He has little information in terms of the size of the attack or the technology. We’ll need to be prepared for just about anything.” The sound of Captain America preparing for another rousing speech curdles the vodka in Tony’s stomach.
Something fits into place, a key turning in the lock of Steve’s mind and he gets up, paces across the floor, and stands next to the window with a hand in his hair and the other on his hip. Tony could laugh because Steve had the nerve to call him dramatic as he stands there, shoulders up around his ears, refusing to look at Tony when he hears something he doesn’t like.
“I don’t care.” Steve steps back into his space, looping his arms around Tony’s waist because he really can’t stand to keep his hands off Tony. They’ve never had this much uninterrupted time together, and the possibilities feel endless. This time belongs to them. “I really don’t. We’ve got the whole week. Whatever you want, anything you want.”
Steve asks him to talk, holds his hands while he does, and offers acceptance in return. He’s patient and kind, not so different from the man Tony’s known, but he listens.
Tony rounds on him, knocking his hand away. There’s dirt all over his face and a cut on his forehead weeping blood down to his jaw. Another slices through the opposite cheek, the bleeding already slowing.
It’s hard not to wonder what Steve is doing, where he is at this exact moment. Tony spends more time than he cares to admit preoccupied with the idea, regardless of where he is in the world.
The vacations they’ve gifted Rhodes and Pepper, and Bucky and Natasha won’t ever be enough. All these people, holding them together. Steve will never be able to thank them the way they deserve.
’ pop off his lower lip, tossing a casual smile at the waitress across the room with a quick gesture for their bill.
“Come here. Tony, come here.” Steve’s tugging at the remaining scraps of his clothes, peeling his undershirt over his head and shoving a hand into his boxers. A hot palm wraps around his cock and gives it a loving stroke, firm from base to tip and Tony arches into it, pressing his forehead against Steve as a whimper that could be a sob slips free.
“Don’t you—don’t you think we should talk about this a little more?” Steve’s breathless, a high flush rising on his cheeks, and Tony smirks down at him.
“It’s not.” Steve searches his useless brain for some sort of explanation but there’s nothing he can do to explain this away. There’s no way to know how much Bucky has seen. “I’m just—I’m trying to figure out how to let him go.”
Tony let himself go, floating across the waves of pleasure rushing through their shared minds. The bond was young and fresh and oh so alive with joy and love, that his vision blurred at the edges.
He can’t stop staring into Tony’s eyes, trapped in the ever-expanding cosmos in Tony’s irises. “God,
“Fuck off, Wilson.” Tony gives him a cutting glare and Sam presses his lips together. “Aren’t you supposed to be some kind of therapist? What kind of friend are you, letting him get away with this bullshit?”
“Oh fuck,” Steve mutters, getting a firm grasp on Tony’s hair and pulling him in. He starts to move his hips, just little hitches into his mouth until Tony flicks a look up at him again, and it’s all the permission Steve needs.
They fuck—just fuck. Sometimes they share meals. Sometimes they watch movies, and when Tony falls asleep half in his lap up in the penthouse and Steve shifts them into his bed to spend the night, they laugh it off as an accident.
“It was nothing, Mr. Stark, really. I hardly said anything.” The flush on his face and the way he ducks his head don’t corroborate his story.
“That you’re coming back.” Tony interrupts, purposefully steering his tongue away from the word that keeps coming to mind.
“I’m going to take care of you, okay? Just like always, sweetheart. You’re safe, Tony. Wake up, now.”
“Don’t mention it. Shuri would be able to put it together for you. We’ll work out the kinks when you’re settled into the Compound.”
Dying doesn’t feel like as much of a loss as he expected. Maybe more of his heart was already here than he realized.
Tony will absolutely not glance to his left, where he can feel Steve’s eyes on him. Barnes’ eyes on him.
“I don’t know,” Tony says honestly. “But I still think that it’s his decision to make. And if he wakes up in a few months and feels like he’s lost time or made a mistake, he’ll figure it out. He’s a big boy, isn’t he? That’s his mistake to make—if it’s even a mistake at all, taking a big leap there, don’t you think? It’s his life to live. Not yours, understand? Not yours.”
Steve rolled out of the bed and stumbled into the bathroom, cleaning up himself before bringing a wet cloth back to clean off the puppet. When there was no evidence left, Steve set the puppet back where it belonged next to the lamp on the night table and snuggled back into the warmth of his bed.
Just the thought that Tony is taking as much pleasure in this as Steve is drives his desire skyrocketing up. He sets a vicious pace, letting Tony gag around him and pull away just long enough to take a breath, pulling him back and holding him still. Tony’s fist flies over his cock, taking what he needs and showing Steve exactly who he belongs to. Tony getting off on just a cock in his throat is almost too much and Steve closes his eyes, letting his head drop back and gripping the edge of the car.
“Okay!” Steve gave an uneven chuckle, heat spreading across his cheeks as his ears burned. Bucky thumped him on the back as the rest of the group laughed and Tony leered.
“Tony—” Steve chokes, blinking away the tears. He can’t lose him on the table. He can’t. It isn’t even worth it. Tony could keep on living with the arc reactor, and he’s taking a risk—
Steve never went back to the United States and the blank face of the burner phone he kept by his side mocked him. A constant reminder of his guilt.
“He would’ve loved you, you know.” Steve’s not an idiot. When the curtain of confusion parts, and he has both feet on solid ground, Steve knows how much of all of this was real. “I wasn’t always so sure, but I think I know that now.”
Somehow, in all the years that Tony has focused on becoming the polar opposite of his father, he’s transformed into a spectre of his mother instead. Maria was a weak woman, a broken woman, and Tony had loved her anyway. There was something brittle about her, the way her thin arms would wrap around him and shield him from Howard’s wrath, that is, until he was old enough to take it head-on. Then it was Tony’s turn to shield her.
“Yeah I hear that but, I mean, things haven’t been easy and I’m sure I’m the last person that you would want to talk to about this kind of thing anyway. But I wanted you to know that it’s okay. If you did want to talk, I mean. I’d listen. I can be… people.” Peter stumbles over the words but forces out every one, then steals another glance up to Tony’s face to gauge his reaction. Has Tony ever met another person in this world as pure and as giving as Peter Parker?
“I love you. You hear me, you giant, stubborn bastard? I love you and I’ve always loved you, and I forgive you for everything. You have to know that. Steve, come on? Can you hear me? I love you.
Somehow, Steve’s still managing to sound calm and pleading. He uses that gentle but firm voice he always did when he was trying to show that he was open and willing. Pliant, maybe, but never quite posing it like a question.
As his flight touches down, Tony’s righting his suit and tie and striding down to meet Pepper with frayed nerves and a parched throat. She’s waiting for him, hovering at the edge of the airstrip in a pinstripe grey dress, strawberry hair curled lightly at the edges. The woman will never age, and she looks more beautiful every day.
The fight is bleeding out of him and exhaustion is creeping back in. Tony feels fucked ten ways to Sunday and just wants to crawl into the nearest bathroom and scrub himself until he feels clean then sleep for a decade.
The barn fills with the quiet rattle of Tony’s sobs. Eventually, he lets Steve tuck him back into his pants, and Steve wipes the drying spit off his chin before he leads Tony back up to the house.
Rhodey felt like the appropriate choice to bridge that gap, and had accepted the honour. Though Tony would argue calling it an honour as Rhodey still struggles through his physiotherapy is a sick joke, even for the Avengers.
Amazing, Tony thinks spitefully, how Steve manages to piece together select snippets of information in ways that worked for him. That the Accords, which he had used not long ago as an excuse to rip their team to shreds, now fell from his lips as a beacon of trust and reconciliation.
“You’re okay,” Steve murmured, hands trailing lower until he could peel the blankets back from Tony’s hips. “I’ve got you, Tony. You’re okay. Wake up now, sweetheart.”
“Course, sweetheart. You know I love when she visits.” Steve bites back a grin, then adds, “Maybe I should get the kayaks back out of the shed? It might still be warm by the time she gets here, and you know how much she loves the little island.”
“Oh doll,” Bucky murmured darkly from between his legs, smearing his lips across the inside of Tony’s thighs with a sloppy kiss, spreading his slick. “We’re just getting started.”
“Jesus, Steve.” Tony’s eyes are wet and Steve reaches over to brush his fingertips at the creases, holding off on sharing how Morgan curls up against his chest and retells the fairy tales that Tony has told her through her childhood. “Warn a guy, would you? You’re really giving me some real emotional whiplash here.”
It’s the final straw, because Steve is only a man; a man in love and if Tony will have him like this, if Tony will wrap him in soft, sweet touches and whispered words, why would Steve deny himself?
Their every sensation, layered over each other and bursting like fireworks, fading and glowing renewed before the last had fully disappeared.
He’d hit traffic in the car on the way over with Happy, who was likely still stuck riding the elevator after Steve had opted to take the stairs a few sets at a time. Everything was conspiring against him, but he’d made it. Tony was still awake, and he’d made it.
“What?” Tony jerks back as if Steve’s slapped him. His face tightens up, and he tugs the sheet up higher, like some second line of defense. As soon as he’s said it, Steve wants to take it back.
A sob breaks free and Steve hadn’t even realized he was holding them back. His throat feels perpetually raw these days because when the sobs come, they don’t stop. He presses his fingers into his eyes but when he closes them, Tony is still there.
Peter becomes a member of the team with seamless ease. After classes and on the weekends, the young spider participates in training exercises on a near daily basis, sparring just as well as the rest of them, and earning a hundred bucks off the allegedly-famed Hawkeye and Falcon. He takes them both down with an effortless grace, surprising them with a combination of his new web fluid and the drone that neither of them had been anticipating.
“I… did not know that.” Rhodey is thoughtful from where he keeps a watchful eye on Tony’s breakfast. His stomach gives a loud gurgle but it doesn’t ease the tension he feels, even when Rhodey gives him a fond smile.
“Mr. Stark?” Peter’s voice is small and soft as he takes tentative steps forward and reaches out with one hand. Tony gazes down at his long, thin fingers feeling dazed and far away.
have no idea,” Tony snaps, eyes flashing but the simmering heat behind his words is abruptly lost in a hiss of pain.
“No! Peter! Goddamn you, Steve!” Tony blasts him, a beam right from the centre of the suit, and Steve flies halfway across the battlefield. His vision crackles with sparks, and he’s too far away. He stumbles to his feet, racing across the field, but he’s already too late.
Tony groans as he rolls out of the bed and Steve stares after him, shamelessly taking in the way his hips taper into the slope of his perfect ass. Tony is anything but flawless, body marred with scars and a little gathering of softness at the bottom of his belly, but he’s real. This is
Tony choked on a sob, freed from the hands holding him back to collapse half on top of Steve, smothering him with his weight even as Steve tried to prop himself up. Steve gasped for air and brought up water of his own. Salt and bile speared across them both as Steve heaved up his share of the ocean but one of his arms was looped around Tony’s waist and it was enough.
“The letter was selfish. I see that now. I thought that if I could just… I don’t know, appease you, or something. Humour you, tell you I at least understood your perspective and why you were holding onto it so tightly, that maybe that would be enough. It was the easiest way I could get what I wanted.”
The double standard makes Steve see red. Or red specks, forming around the black fuzziness on the edge of his vision. “You said the Mandarin was nothing!”
“Can we at least keep the nest?” Bucky asked, tugging both men back down and yanking blankets this way and that to cover them.
“Don’t want to fuck you.” Steve tightens up his grip, licking a stripe up Tony’s throat to his ear as he strokes him. When he rolls his thumb over the leaking head, Tony’s hips twitch towards him, eyes going hazy with pleasure. “Just want to make love to you. Love you so fucking much, Tony.”
He sighs. “Can we–would it be okay if we…?” That feels like enough for today and there’s too much to consider for him to listen to anymore. There’s nothing else he wants to say.
Happy pulls up in front of the Clerk’s Office and Pepper gives him an encouraging smile over her slender shoulder. “You’ll be home for dinner, yes?”
Tony’s not long behind him, a few thrusts more into the clenching vice of Steve’s body and he’s chanting Steve’s name into his mouth, fucking as deep as he can so Steve knows exactly who he belongs to. Exactly where he belongs.
Of course, it’s pathetic. Waking up and realizing that he’s managed to survive the end of the world, twice, fought against death and won, and be desperate to get his hands on a couple of letters from the ex-husband who almost beat him to death and never apologized.
“Come on,” Tony gasps out, breathless. Behind him, Tony is rapidly losing control, spiralling towards his own release with brutal thrusts. Steve whimpers and shakes his head as Tony’s hand starts to stroke him again.
“JARVIS why?” Steve rasps into the quiet room, pressing his fists into his eyes. “Why did he—why would he—” His voice dies on a sob, that brings reinforcements until Steve is choking on air and the misery washes over him.
The burn is grounding and his body thrums with anticipation. It’s a special type of sin he won’t be absolved from, and Steve wants to come. He wants to come screaming with Tony so deep inside him he’s gagging on it.
“Say it,” Steve gasps, forcing himself to keep his eyes open because he doesn’t want to miss this. “Tony, please, just—”
Riding on a wave of serotonin, Tony’s contentment feels absolute. Peace and belonging wrapping around him in the warmest comfort he’s ever experienced.
Sometimes it’s hard to remember Steve from before, like this. When he was all soft, sweet edges and bright eyes, turning his loving gaze on Tony so many times on a given day that he’d forgotten it wasn’t just Steve’s normal face. At some point Tony’s brain had rearranged all the schema and Steve’s baseline became crinkled eyes and toothy smiles.
“The serum’s just asleep for the winter.” Tony curls over Steve and for the first time since this started, he looks directly into Steve’s eyes. “I figured it out in less than an hour.”
How long has it been now? Six, seven years? And he can still feel the phantom of Steve’s palm on his lower back, guiding him through the Compound with warm familiarity, after all this time.
Barnes has somehow picked up on the fact that he subtly favours his right. Even Rogers had never noticed that, the famed tactician that he was. The Winter Soldier is perceptive and it’s terrifying.
“Sure, I usually make a habit of befriending the people who murder my loved ones.” Tony winces, and swallows around the acidity in his voice. He doesn’t want to fight, or give Steve a reason to start up again. “Sorry, that was—I didn’t mean that.” The little voice in his head flares to life:
When everything in him told him to run, Steve let himself fall forward, and Tony had been there, every time.
Steve paused in his work, shaking out a cramp in his hand and nudging at Bucky with his foot, who glanced up at him. Scenting him lightly, Steve reached out with bliss and love and family, smirking as he nodded towards the cooling coffee cup.
Steve has laid him down on the pyre and set him ablaze, thrusting into him while he burns and turns to ash, the taste of Steve’s kisses as bitter as charcoal.
Steve forces himself to look up. The pity in Bucky’s eyes stirs the nausea in his stomach. “Some of it was real.”
“I think I still want kids.” It comes out in a rush, a blurt across their comforter, and once he’s spoken it aloud, Tony’s eyes go wide and surprised, as if he can’t believe he’s said it. “I know a lot has changed, but I keep thinking—”
“Stop, fucking stop.” Tony buries a hand in Steve’s hair and tugs harder than he needs to, “fucking fuck me, Rogers.”
is the embodiment of everything irrational and Steve with his superior moral compass will save the day every time,
Not that what Steve wants is of any consequence. The circumstances of his dreams may always be different, but the storyline remains the same.
“This is absolutely the least sexy thing I’ve ever seen, but damn do you know how to get me hot, Barnes.” Tony growled, attributing his good nature to the stream of
He pressed his face into Tony’s throat, the scratch of his stubble prickling against Steve’s mouth. “Thank you. Thank you, so much.”
Everything still manages to fall into place. They take two limousines and have to shake it up at the last minute, because Steve and Tony’s disagreement in the living room has left them broken off in groupings too similar to Germany. This can’t fall apart, not after all the hard work they’ve put in.
The bond flared back to life and he barely had time to process it before Steve was wrenching backward, tipping his head to the side for Bucky’s mouth to seal over his neck.
Tony swallows hard, barking imaginary orders for his brain to consider any other topic, because this one is doing nothing to help with the whole bile issue.
The leap of faith feels worth it. And if he’s jumping right into the fire, it won’t be so bad. Tony’s been burned before.
Take that away and what is he? He’s already thrown everything else into the fire. He’s past the fork in the road, can’t turn back now.
It’s starting to sink in that Steve will never touch Tony again. Never hold him in his arms or relive the memories as if they were happening again for the very first time. Rhodes and Pepper have all made certain of that.
“Mr. Stark, you need to take a look at this. It’s amazing. It actually might be better than the prosthetic braces you’ve been working on for Colonel Rhodes.”
Tony’s beautiful, and for the first time Steve’s allowed to think that—to say it out loud in the light of day without fear.
The groan Steve lets out should make him shiver, but it has tears prickling behind his eyes and it takes more than it should to hide them underneath a choke and light gag.
He wants to live in this moment with the tickle of Tony’s hairy calves against the top of his feet, the feeling of Tony’s fingers digging into his thighs. There are never any bruises, but Steve wants him to dig his nails in deep enough to pierce skin if only Tony will leave his mark for a little while.
“Did he get you?” Steve asks with mock shock, plucking her hand up off the table and inspecting it closely. “Did he eat your fingers off?”
He thrusts deep into his throat, savouring the way Tony chokes just enough to pull back before he dives back in, meeting every roll of Steve’s hips like he was made for sucking his cock. Spit drips out from the corner of his mouth and onto the hood of the car between Steve’s legs, and below him, Tony’s free hand starts working on his own cock.
Tony’s still watching the flickering of orange, a remnant of the swirling magic Strange has conjured up and stepped through. Magic makes him twitchy.
To pull Steve down and watch him shatter into pieces on the concrete, his immovable statue of a husband—ex-husband—lying in rubble at his feet? He knows he can do a damn good job, and yet he feels guilt wrap around the arc reactor and squeeze.
“Wow, okay.” Tony forces out an uncertain breath before he pulls back the hand on Steve’s face and runs it through his own hair.
Tony’s cock is an enticing, lush red, a few shades lighter than the flush of exertion spreading across his cheeks and down onto his chest. If they had more time, Steve would lick and suck until red darkened into purple and Tony was teetering on the edge of release, moaning and begging for Steve to let him come.
Steve shakes his head and leans back on his hands, glancing up at the ceiling. “You have too much faith in me, Tony. Everyone does. I don’t deserve it.”
“Steve, come on!” Tony’s still grinning, throwing his armour towards him. “There’s an orgasm on the line here!”
“Oh, God,” Tony groans, burying his face in his shoulder. “Do you have to be so goddamn genuine all the time?”
It’s vindicating, to know that Steve finally understands. It must’ve been difficult, Tony imagines, to set so much aside and be willing to try again. The B.A.R.F. sessions can’t have been easy on him, but he did it anyways, to make things right even if only for himself. That counts for something, doesn’t it?
“Gentleman,” Pepper appears back at Tony’s side, eyes taking in the empty glass in his hand before they skate up to look at Steve. “Thank you for keeping Mr. Stark company, Captain, but I think I can handle it from here.”
Tony shrugs, giving Steve a look of ‘what can you do’ because there’s no clear answer as to why he doesn’t. Tony just… doesn’t hate Barnes. He can separate who he was with who he is.
“I guess I already know what you would have done differently.” Tony aims for a joke and Steve offers him an indulgent little half-smile.
“Can it, Stevie. I want to hear it from him. If he’s got some idea of what Omegas are supposed to be like, then he’s probably got a few things he wants to say to us, right?”
This is about possessing him, Tony knows, so he refuses to look at him, closing his eyes and tipping his head up towards the top of the bed.
Steve’s been ready for this for weeks, feeling his body falling apart around him even as his mind remained alert and focused. It was a terrible type of prison and one of the few times he’d felt human in decades.
“You say that now, but Tony I remember the look on your face. The way you couldn’t bear to be near me afterward. If we’re going to try—”
To be the first person to touch Steve had been a gift, and after, when Steve was breathless, spent inside of Tony’s body, he’d given him another gift and begged Tony to take him apart too.
“JARVIS? What exactly is the Avalon Protocol? Tony’s okay, right? He’s just unconscious or something? Release the suit and I'll carry him over to the med tent.”
Steve brushes a hand over his face but not before Tony is back at his side, reaching up and pushing the tears away with the tip of his thumb. Steve gives him a watery smile.
Maybe it’s the sharp intake of breath behind him, hardly a whisper of a sniffle, or maybe it’s Steve Rogers calling him
Tony’s on display across their bedspread, ass up, weight resting on his forearms, and as he presses his face into the mattress, he moans. He’s always been loud since that very first day, and it never ceases to stoke that low-burning fire in Steve’s belly back into a firestorm of want and desire.
Tony swallows, saliva thick and sour in the back of his mouth. An empty commitment, months too late. “It’s a shame you never asked, Steve.”
The surface wasn’t within view as the water crept steadily up towards his chest, filling in every modicum of space and reaching up to lick at his throat. It was a race against time and after his run-in with Vanko in France, Tony had never been one for races.
In upstate New York, Steve is probably getting back to the Compound, dropping his divorce certificate onto the counter, and sitting down to dinner with the team. Tony images him smiling like nothing is wrong—he probably wouldn’t have even said where he was going today.
Steve groaned into his mouth, finally getting with the program and palming the curve of Tony’s jaw, tipping his head back to gain a little more control over the kiss. Teasing along the seam of his lips, he relished the way Tony practically purred as he opened to him, letting him lick and taste and take.
“I’m going to make pasta for dinner tonight.” Steve explained. “It was Tony’s turn to choose. He picked Italian.”
Over Sarah’s shoulder, he sees Natasha and he can’t help it. A sob escapes him and he pitches forward out of his mother’s arms and straight into Natasha’s. “Did you miss me too, Avenger?” She asks.
“Now you better tell me what’s goin’ on, right now Stevie.” Bucky growled, pointing a finger in his face.
“You know, if we just tried, it might even get easier? We could at least figure out some way to exist in the same space.” Steve hisses between his teeth, anger overtaking everything else.
