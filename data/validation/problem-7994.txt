"Well, I thought we could spend some time before you jet off. I have your favorite thing starting with “D” upstairs.”
“Can you move us to the side? The post-fuck flop is crushing me, honey,” Tony said after a few moments.
He bent low, brushing the curls back from Tony’s forehead before pressing a soft kiss there. He rubbed his thumb over the hair under his hand, pressing more kisses to Tony’s face until he stirred.
Steve set down the bags of souvenirs they’d bought. “It was cool. I liked the section they had on the development of disposable cameras. Reminded me of so many summers where Buck and I each had one that had to last the whole summer vacation.”
“Well, he’s not in here for me.”
“It hasn’t changed,” Tony answered.
“I think it’s new. Sometimes I’ll catch Sam’s scent on them or Bucky’s on him.”
“Sorry about your bro date. I know you didn’t want to see Fast Cars 11 or whatever they’re called. I’ll make it up to him.”
“I thought you’d like it.”
He used his mouth and hands, tracing every line of Tony’s cock and working through his slick to drive him closer to coming. His fingers pumped in and out of Tony, stretching him and causing him to twist on the duvet. Tony shuddered and reached out to grab whatever he could reach of Steve, quietly whining and rambling to the ceiling. It was like every dirty dream came true, every night Steve woke painfully hard to the memory of Tony’s hole on his tongue.
“Not about that,” Steve sighed. “But good to know. Sam is in for his shift at 3:00, I’ll make sure he sends Redwing up there to collect the garbage.”
“Mr. Stark, this is my dad, Steve Rogers.”
Steve pulled away and tried to straighten his clothes like they had gotten caught making out. He couldn’t hear the reply, but the door shut and the loud ruckus that only small children can make came down the hallway.
“No,” Steve answered.
“No, it says ‘Get Lit.’ Totally different.”
“You can do whatever you want, you don’t have to…”
Steve stepped off the elevator and kicked off the gym shoes he’d changed into for the flight back. He ditched the weight of the shield carrier bag and his duffle there as well. He could feel the month’s worth of grime and sweat still on his skin, even after the lengthy shower at the hotel before the flight. He padded across the penthouse. There were a few dishes scattered about, a blanket on the couch balled up-- proof his husband didn’t spend the entire time he was gone cooped up in the workshop welding and hammering out his anxiety over the mission.
“I could run to the bodega?”
A gloved hand wrapped in deep maroon leather held the book out. Miranda Mayflower’s guide to Meeting Magical Men.
“No? I see the same dorito that I used to climb like a tree, only with a hipster haircut”
Steve decided that melting through the floor in embarrassment was sounding better and better. His face was probably the color of his shirt.
He steamrolled right over Steve’s objection, “Stevie here doesn’t have a date.”
He didn’t even need to think about it. “Yeah.”
Being the last of your friend group that wasn’t intentionally single led to a lot of meddling, blind dates, and offers to swipe on tinder for you. Steve opened his mouth to answer but the shop owner and Bucky chose that moment to come around the racks to join them.
Tony nodded before continuing, “I was scared. Every adult in my life shut me out and turned me away… Except for Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes. She flew up after the birth to show me how to change a diaper and get him to latch, and ended up staying for three weeks. I wrote to any address for the army I could find. Rhodey helped as much as he could from the Air Force side, without breaking any laws.”
Tony set his coffee down so he could grab Steve’s hands. “No. I thought we were going to do it all together. That night? When you were fidgety and cagey at dinner? I thought I was going to find a ring in my champagne.”
“It must have been difficult. Was Peter...is he healthy?”
Bucky shook a little extra silverweed powder into the bowl before whisking again. “I told you to tell off those kids last time they were in. They always think they can hide their empty coffee cups on top of the gemology case like we can’t see it.”
“Did you want me to pack you lunch? I can pack you a--”
“I’m glad you had her.”
“I’d love to. I’ll go wash up too,” Steve answered. He ached to end his words with a kiss to Tony’s cheek, top off the domesticity of it all. To be a little family.
“I didn’t know how to reach you. I thought about trying Bucky’s mom, but I didn’t know how she’d take it, or if she’d even help me or believe me.”
The paramedics laughed and gave Steve the all clear to get him home. Steve resisted the urge to pick Peter up like he was three and tote him back to the car, but barely. There was still so much commotion, but Steve could see another ambulance open closer to the doors of the school. Even wrapped in a blanket with a paramedic's hand obscuring most of his face, Steve knew Tony’s features from across the distance.
“Want to catch up? Or something else, Steve?”
“Here! This is perfect.”
“I am. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen, all those months ago when you walked back into our lives, but you just fit. Not every alpha would jump in feet first to get to know his pup, would devote so much time…”
“With our 9 and a half year old son.”
“You and me both, handsome,” Tony replied. He felt his way across Steve’s left hand, his bare fingers. “Are you seeing anyone?”
“I’m getting this one for Barton. He’ll love it. He can wear it on that farm of his.”
Steve pulled back from removing the panties with his teeth, “You complainin’?”
“You’re it for me, Steve. I tried, I really did. Anyone who was willing to fuck an unmated O with a pup waiting for them back home. It was like my body rejected them. Dried up like the Sahara down there,” Tony chuckled. “I dated a beta for a year or two, but turns out she just wanted to pilfer my workshop for stuff to sell.”
After a few dances, Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and their glasses and walked them to the patio outside the atrium. It had been his favorite part the handful of times he’d been to the Gardens. There was a bench nestled next to the butterfly garden that was practically glowing in the fading sun filtered through the trees. The warmth of Tony’s hand in his and the champagne on his tongue made him a little giddy; the cooling air outside was a much needed break from the crush of people inside to clear his head a little.
“ ‘Teve? You’re home?”
“Holy shit, if I’d known that a little bit of lace would bring out this side of you, I’d have worn it sooner,” Tony said breathlessly.
“He didn’t mean to, I made a joke and Peter wasn’t looking and we knocked the beakers over and Mr. Stark told us to go and there was this smell,” Ned was going a mile a minute.
“Yeah,” Tony replied. He put his forehead against Steve’s chest, “My body isn’t the same, though. I mean, a pup and then ten years, but--”
A swarm of thoughts rushed forward as he got his bag in the entryway, of headlines and young lives changed in seconds and all the horrors Peter told him of drills and and and…
“Mr. Rogers, thank God you answered!” Steve could hear sirens. His keys were in hand, the front door slammed behind him.
A huff loud enough to be heard through the duvet puffed the fabric out for a moment. “Vincent is coming this morning to fix...all this. You weren’t supposed to see.”
Steve felt a warmth inside at that, that Tony was funny and smart and comfortable with the kids that called him Uncle and held so much of his heart. “Can I steal you?”
Steve did his own embarrassed shuffle, “I mean, I have hoped that someday, we could. But I understand if you didn’t want to.”
Tony did his own version of the shy foot shuffle and pointed past Steve’s shoulder, “DUM-e and his brothers. I’ve always been a bit busy for a love life.”
“Order some I can rip and I’ll show you everything you’ve been missing, honey,” Steve replied. He smoothed Tony’s hair down, itching to give him a kiss.
“This one isn’t so bad. The reindeer motif is nice.”
"I can send you a photo if you'd like? And we would need to know as soon as possible if you two are wanting to meet him."
Steve kissed him again. Small pecks to soothe away the furrow in Tony’s brow. He wasn’t sure how long they stood there reconnecting, Tony fitting perfectly in his arms, before Tony spoke again. “Stay the night?”
Steve laughed as he he maneuvered them to laying on their sides, “Post-fuck flop?”
“They met him once. They showed up at the apartment one day around my birthday. I think Mother put her foot down wanting to see me. But they never came over again, and then...well I guess I should have known you didn’t know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony set his drink down and reached up and brushed his fingers through the short roughness of Steve’s beard. “Oh honey, someone who doesn’t just want a news story, or a few grand for a few hours of fun?
“Yes, I’d love to pick your brain about the Broomball doping scandal. I can’t believe they thought that common luck potion with
Steve. Motherfucking. Rogers. College beau and the one that didn’t just get away, but ran as fast as he could away from Tony. Steve “We’ll keep in touch” Rogers. The one who Tony still thought about on lonely nights, on nights when he paid someone new to warm his bed, on nights where the only warmth he felt was the burn of whatever he’d poured into a tumbler.
“I’m sorry Tony. God I wish I had been there for you, for you both.”
Steve thought.
"Oh, yes, Cap--Steve," Happy nodded, "Ms. Potts points out quite a lot that he's become more of the sentimental type since you've gotten together. I have to agree with her, and not just because she pays my salary."
“Single,” Steve answered with a nervous, hopeful little smile.
“Why is this so hard? Aren’t there any
Tony’s drink grumbled and spat lightning in the silence of the cafe. Time stretched awkwardly as Steve cycled through how to respond.
“Oh Petey, yeah, everyone did then,” Tony answered. He gathered Peter in a hug, giving the top of his hair a kiss. “We’ll see if we can still find one somewhere and I’ll show you how to use it.”
Steve blanched, “A what?!”
Steve stood, pulling Tony up with him and into another quick kiss. “We better hurry, Sarah said the cake’s predictions come true within a year.”
, I’ll take you to bed, sweetheart.”
“Sorry! I didn’t plan this,” Steve said with a grin. “How about I run out in the morning for Plan B and Bagels?”
He knew some parents sent gift cards or other little things to teachers at the end of the year, but all the things Steve wanted to give Mr. Stark were X-rated. Steve had nearly melted through the floor on Parent Night, flirtatious banter flying out of his mouth before his brain could stop it. And for Tony to give as good as he got, suggesting he couldn’t wait for their ‘one-on-one.’ The months since had been both exciting and agonizing, he couldn’t remember the last time he felt a connection like this. He tried to hide it from Peter, but the kid was smart enough to figure it out, subtly putting Tony’s number in Steve’s phone for ‘college prep meetings.’
“Steve?” Sam’s voice cut through the veil of the past, the crushing weight of memory that stole his breath. “What’s wrong, buddy?”
Steve wasn't sure what to do with this new information, but it'd have to wait. He needed to make sure no one ended up in the pond behind the officiant, including the officiant, and that he wasn't the source of any 'wedding disasters' stories.
"Yes, Captain."
“Tony, I...we should talk.”
Steve was a crier at weddings. The swell of emotion watching someone at their ceremony, their hands trembling when taking the ring from their attendant, their wobbly words as they recite their vows. The first time Sam’s voice cracked had set off everyone else in the party like a line of sobbing dominoes, and Steve was glad that Nat had made them each store a handkerchief up their sleeves.
“Yup. My hormones went into overdrive in an effort to get my alpha to stay and mate me. A bit of an underhanded attack for my body to make without my consent, but here we are.”
“You’re welcome, you raised a good kid. He seems pretty close to his aunt. Your sister?”
“How am I just seeing this side of you
“I’ll kick your ass on the plane tomorrow.” The ding of the call disconnecting came before the thunk of the phone hitting the nearest table.
“Well, did you want me to drive you? You shouldn’t have to take the bus on your first day.”
“What?”
“I hope you’re having a good time tonight.”
“Ned, is Mr. Stark ok?”
“Aren’t they a little young for fire magic?” Steve commented.
home. Tony’s earthy shampoo and the faintest hint of grease and coconut that never fades, warm cotton and the feeling of his skin under Steve’s lips.
“And if I want to?” He snapped a strap wrapping around Tony’s right thigh. That earned him a small squeak-- he wanted more. “You’re my present to open as I wish. And if I want to ruin you,” Steve tugged on Tony’s cheeks, licking a stripe up over Tony’s hole through the lace before continuing, “is that a problem?”
Dark roast coffee, like sticking his nose in a bag of fresh grounds. And sweet coconut. Clear as day and as strong as one of Bucky’s punches when he would catch Steve off guard at the gym.
“All dolled up? You sound like a 1940s virgin out on the town with a dame for the first time, Rogers.”
“Sorry,” Steve said quietly.
“Yup,” Tony replied, popping the ‘P’ before taking a sip of his own water. “I still have his ultrasounds, I saved everything. If you want to see.”
he'd worry about the hot billionaire out in the crowd.
Steve pushed Tony’s legs wider, changing the angle until his thrusts caused Tony’s quips to stop in favor of singing his praises to the ceiling. They laid in the soft quiet of the afterglow, the late afternoon light filtering through the curtains highlighting the goosebumps on their skin in the AC.
His mind tumbled during the drive from D.C. to New York City, turning over every memory of his time in the army for a clue, any mail he never opened or calls he didn’t take. Bucky and he rose through the ranks until he was captaining his own group of commandos for ops that were now more black bars than reports, if not shredded completely. Could General Phillips have kept his son from him? The commandos were all alphas with little left at home, except for Bucky’s mom. He wouldn’t have made it onto the team if Steve didn’t push, if Buck’s own bullheaded drive to protect Steve didn’t force Phillips’ hand.
“Thank you, and I’m sorry we’re away on our anniversary.”
“Are you insane? Refills are fifty cents! Another bucket is like $6.”
Steve chuckled, “I, uh… I have to confess that I didn’t know who you were until about five minutes before the ceremony, so I am still a little stunned you showed up, but I’m so glad you did.”
“No buts. I was clearing the halls of any other students, which is my job in an evacuation.” Tony tightened the blanket around Peter’s shoulders, “I don’t think I’d be able to live with myself if I’d lost you, kid, if it was a bigger emergency.”
“Yes, it has.” Tony knew his answer was curt, but goddamnit, Steve can’t just
“To Tony? Yeah, said that he sent letters, but the army sent them back.”
“Sure. No ic-”
“Damn super soldiers,” Tony laughed. He pushed at Steve’s shoulders and wiggled, throwing off the duvet. “Uncle,” Tony yelled between hiccuping laughs, “Steve!”
Steve stuck out his hand for a shake, “Pleasure to meet you, that was quite the presentation they put on.”
“And ready to mingle?” He trailed off, raising his eyebrow.
“Wow, that’s amazing. Does he know? Because that’s a pretty big secret.”
Steve tossed his hands up and pulled out a chair at the table. He sat, folding his head into his arms. “He doesn’t want me, not now at least. He thinks I knew this whole time. I have no right to be in his life. This child hasn’t known his sire for nearly 10 years. He thinks I returned the letters to reject him and Peter.”
Bucky looked a little stunned, eyes darting back and forth between Steve and Tony. “Yeah, I am. And I see you’ve met my best man, Steve.”
“Aw, baby. Tony.” He tugged on the blanket again, “I’m not having this conversation with the duvet.”
Standing in front of Steve was Tony Stark. World famous wizard and alchemist, creator of
“Tony, I-- I told you not to wait.”
Steve scraped his teeth across the fresh hickey on Tony’s collarbone, enjoying the shudder it caused in the body underneath him, the growing urgency in his noises.
Dinner was delicious, and the conversation with Tony was so effortless that Steve didn’t even notice it was time for speeches and cake until Nat dropped a mic in his lap. He made Bucky cry with his Best Man speech-- his sole goal for the evening-- and was pretty sure that Sam rigged the cake pull so he’d get the ring token. The New Orleans tradition predicted he’d be the next one to get married, at least according to a giggling Sarah. He brought a slice back for Tony and asked him to dance once it was finished.
Steve could hear Sam’s whispered “fuck” under his breath next to him as Tony’s words sunk in.
“Anxious to finish, so he rushes, see it all the time. But we can work on that,” Tony said with a smile.
“Uncle Steve, look!” AJ ran over to take Steve by the hand and bring him closer to the slowly circling forks balanced on the candle.
If you liked this fic, but don't know what to comment, I love emojis! Drop a ❤ to tell me you'd like to kudos again 😘
Tony laughed, eyes crinkling at the corners, “Nothing sends a message like a little mustard gas.” The medic put the clapped Tony on the shoulder to send him on his way. “And you, Mr. Rogers, I should give you detention for going back into that building.”
“Oh my God, Steve doesn’t know who his date is,” Sam thumped his head onto Bucky’s chest, “You asked a billionaire to our wedding for Grandpa Steve who still used a flip phone until like a year ago. How is this our life?”
Steve swooped, gathering Tony up in his arms before heading to the elevator. “Then let’s go make time.”
“I am not wearing a sweater that says, ‘Where my Ho’s at?’”
A shiver of weird deja vu trickled down Steve’s spine. The moment was like ten years never happened, that they were still in Tony’s college apartment after classes getting a drink before studying. But it passed, and the present leaked into the memory like color bleeding into a black and white photograph.
It'd taken Steve an agonizing week to really do it, even with its simplicity. But he'd wanted it to be perfect. He'd taken to a smaller canvas size so it wouldn't be ostentatious, fretted over the colors so they'd be just right, and worked through his cramping hand until it was done the way he wanted it to look.
“That would be awesome! Maybe Papa could take one and take pictures at his home.”
He let go of Tony’s locks, letting them curl forward and Steve was gone at the sight. Lush waves adding a dark lust to his husband’s face as he sucked down Steve’s come, licking the remnants that escaped his lips like a cat who had gotten the cream.
He leaned in close, “No,” and kissed him.
“He does. We kept in touch over the years, she would always drop by for his birthday. Now that he’s older, she takes him every once and a while. She lives in Queens and they do city stuff when he’s on summer break, does all the fun aunt stuff.”
“Well, we can’t keep the cake waiting,” Tony said, leading Steve by the hand to the parking lot. And if there was a row of faces pressed to the atrium glass watching them go, neither bothered to mention it.
“I have learned to be very quiet. But usually once he’s out, he’s out. There’s a guest bedroom on the other side of the apartment if you want to be careful.”
He laughed a little, “You should have seen me when I grew out a beard. But I meant that I have some scars, they aren’t pretty. We go at your pace, ok?”
“Dad, can I call Aunt May about it? I just want her to know,” Peter looked at him with those pleading puppy eyes Steve never could resist.
Steve laughed, “That’s what it feels like. How badly did Howard flip?”
“You and Uncle Bucky actually
Lord save him from these two.
ugly sweaters out there? No Santa peeing off the roof. No twerking elves. No ‘Big package’ puns.”
Steve agreed to stay in New York in case of supervillain shenanigans. After Doom crashed the wedding last year in a Maleficent-esque tantrum, Tony didn’t want to chance having them both out of town. No matter how beautiful Steve would look wearing only silk sheets and the warm sunrise of Malibu morning.
He arranged to have his gift, the letter, and some flowers delivered as a surprise in the morning for Steve to find when Tony knew he’d be missing him the most. He thought a hand-written letter would be more meaningful to Steve than transcribing something for JARVIS to print out, but other than scribbling out a signature, he hadn’t needed to write by hand in years. The movements felt rusty and stilted.
Before Tony came into his life, Steve hadn't had any experience in the relationship department. Sure, there was Bucky and the women that he'd go around with, but he wasn't like Bucky. He couldn't do things the way his friend did even if people were to give him a chance. So dating Tony was a learning experience. One that he didn't regret.
“I do not care, omega. Now sleep.”
In the distance, Steve could hear Rhodes speaking, but each word felt useless in the face of the omega that was being hurt.
They went their separate ways and Steve continued to mingle with the other alphas. But from the corner of his eye, he watched Tony interact with the other omegas. Or rather, he watched as Tony listened carefully to other omegas and smiled encouragingly when they told him about their home, their life-everything.
"You're his child are you not? Howard Stark was the owner of this manor. Rhodes told me." Steve added as realization dawned on Tony's face. Hi body trembled but he continued to listen to Steve's words.
“Alpha...that was incredible.” Tony moaned with delight and pressed a gentle kiss to Steve’s collarbone. “Very nice indeed.”
With a scowl, Steve mumbled his thanks and headed in the direction of the laundry room. Several omegas wandered around completing household errands but Tony was nowhere in sight.
“What’s the matter?” Steve asked and glanced down at his cock before looking back up. “Have you not taken this size before?”
The smirk slipped off Tony’s face and he stilled his hand. “Alpha?”
“We will keep this space between us. I want you to tell me about yourself. Where you’re from, what your home is like. Who your friends are and what your ambitions are.” Steve swallowed and began to blink rapidly. It hurt to speak and face Tony and yet he couldn’t look away. How could he dare to face him, after all the grief he’d put him through? “I want to know about you. What makes you happy, what makes you sad and what you want for yourself. I want to know you in a way that you know me. You have seen me in my home and seen my life. Show me yours. I want you to speak to me.”
He’d never seen Tony look so defeated. So...
“I heard you gave the fine silk clothes I gave you to that boy. My betas told me. There is a brunette omega you speak to every morning. You gave him those clothes from the gathering.”
In the early hours of the morning, Obadiah returned to the manor with two medium sized betas in tow. It was clear they had come for their property.
Caught in the act, Tony looked away like he was being scolded. “He needed it more than I did. There’s a chance some alpha might take him in. I want that for him.”
Steve pushed Tony back and onto his knees. Face flushed, Tony looked up at him with deep brown eyes, his mouth half open in surprise.
“What?” Tony frowned and looked down at himself. “No, my lord.”
Even as the words were spoken, Steve knew there was something else boiling under the surface. Something that Tony wasn’t saying.
“Put your clothes back on, Tony. I want you to dress in whatever is most comfortable and join me here.” Steve said calmly and patted the space beside him, doing his best not to flinch under Tony’s stare.
“You’re hurt.” Steve said lowly and despite his horror Tony merely smiled and pushed his hands away.
“I...I’m...” Tony’s breath stuttered and he blinked rapidly as Rhodes released him. He seemed close to tears. “Rhodey?”
That saddest part was that Steve had genuinely believed that once. Had turned a blind eye to it all. When Tony had tried to speak to him before, had tried to open up to Steve, he had shut down every avenue-every path, for Tony. Until eventually...
“Tony?” Steve reached out and ran a hand through his hair, doing his best to use his scent to sooth the clearly distraught omega. “Are you alright?”
“You only hurt me when you say it. You don’t understand but I am never going to leave. Obie will never allow it. In fact, if he found out you tried to bond me, you would never hear from me again and I-“
Steve closed his eyes in shame. Beside him there was a soft rustling and then the faint warmth of a body nearby.
“Of course. Always.”
His knot began to swell and they began to pick up rhythm. With one hard thrust, Steve pressed in fully and locked into place, and with it, Tony cried out and clenched down hard, body fluttering as his cock began to spill between them. Steve soon felt his own body give in and with a groan, he came deep inside Tony.
“Omega, what is your handler like?”
"Do you enjoy being a concubine? Is it something you..."
"The manor is yours. The piano, all of it. It
“He’s being punished. We’re not allowed to speak to him.”
“His name is Tony, my lord. A fine omega with beautiful behavior, I can’t even begin to express how well behaved he is! A fine addition to your household, I assure you!”
Having suitably distracted Tony, Steve reached down and gently brushed his thumb over Tony’s quivering hole, using soft motions to coax more moans out of the omega. To his delight, Tony seemed to melt under his touch.
Tucking his arm under Tony’s waist, Steve flipped them over to allow Tony to lie on his chest as they waited out the knot. It was unusual to do but Steve did not care. He simply wanted to rest.
Something was wrong, he was certain of it now. He saw it. He saw it every night when he held Tony close and noticed a dampness on the pillow every morning. He saw it in the way Tony would look at the omega nobles who met Steve for dinner and turn back to the plate in his hands that he carried to the table as if it surprised him.
And really that was what it came down to. Tony was his concubine. Steve was the alpha. The alpha of the night that would use him and hurt him-
“It was brilliant. We were able to talk about so much! I only wish we could have continued.” Tony said eagerly but then stopped and looked a little sad as he faced the ground.
“Hello. It’s nice to meet you my lords.” Tony said with a polite bow and Steve was stunned to see him move so perfectly.
“Tony...was it your first time?”
His body was looser too. His kisses were more passionate and giving. His ribs were thinner.
“So...” Obadiah leaned in and narrowed his eyes. “What do you think? Do you want to try him again?”
Time seemed to pass like a faded dream. A month went by. They never spoke of the incident again.
“I don’t have anything to offer you.” Tony said, sounding numb. “I have nothing. I’m just a concubine.”
“Isn’t that like me?”
Tony wept. He did not speak or move or shift. He simply hid his face from Steve and continued to cry, lost in his own world of hopelessness and despair. It was awful and stung just as much as a slap on the face. It couldn’t have been the guilt from being caught on the piano. It had to be something more.
“Good.” He rumbled and leaned in to press his lips to Tony’s neck.
“Hmmm good.” Steve closed his eyes and dropped his head on the pillow, keeping his hands loosely around Tony. “Now sleep, concubine.”
They were respectable omegas. Admirable. They did not offer themselves up to alphas.
pianos for all he cared.
Tony’s time as a concubine would come to an end.
“How long have you been here?” He asked quietly and that seemed to pull Tony out of his trance.
But Tony just laughed bitterly. “I know you think that. But you can’t give me those things. No one can.”
“Yes. Okay Steve,
“Sorry, I’ll just-yeah, I’ll go sort it-don’t worry I brought some creams that can mask the-the marks-“
For the first time ever, Tony looked so broken. Like his heart had been torn from his chest and ripped into two. Like someone had told him he’d never find happiness or would never see the light of day again. He looked so miserable and so upset it broke Steve’s heart.
Tony could’ve used his hands to build things, to create as was clearly his first love. And yet, instead he used his hands to...to...
“Omega. Tony.” Steve shook him gently to rouse him and see and luckily Tony groaned softly and opened his eyes, revealing dim, tired eyes. They were red-rimmed and somehow so old and so young at the same time.
The heat of Tony’s body against his, the press of his soft skin against his-
Steve thought, watching as Tony’s glossy eyes blinked tiredly and his lips smiled at him with a dying light.
“I am not-“
“Tell me.” Steve demanded, settling back down on the velvet seat of his chair. “What is your name?”
“Let me have you, Tony.” Steve murmured, pausing to press his lips to Tony’s forehead. He wanted nothing more than to bring a smile to Tony’s face. He was sure of it. “I will make sure you have the best life. You will answer to no one and be free to make your own decisions, even without me. I will never force myself on you, not in any part of your life. But I would love the chance to walk beside you.”
There hadn’t been for a while now, Steve realized. The last month had changed Tony, had made him more reserved and more exhausted.
Whenever they entered the bedroom, Tony would always place a small robe on the side. He would always comb his fingers through his hair. And after the incident with the bruises, he would always spend more time in the bathing room, carefully applying more makeup, Steve realized.
“You will please me as you like. Show me what you can do.”
“Mate, no. He is my guest for tonight.”
Feeling a wave of pride, Steve turned towards Tony.
Steve was ready. Tonight would be the first night with his future omega.
Steve paused and considered. “You’re not wrong. But you’re not right either.”
“Yeah Tony.” Rhodes said softly, taking hold of his elbows gently. “It’s me.”
“Thank you.” Tony whispered shyly, looking strangely grateful and to Steve’s surprise, he realized he’d spoken out loud.
“You play beautifully.” Steve finally admitted, meeting Tony’s gaze. “Where did you learn that song?”
“Alpha, that’s...oh, that’s so nice.” Tony slurred and seemed to just melt under the delicate strokes. A noise of pleasure left him and Steve was caught staring at the omega just sinking into the sheets.
“Your omega?” Tony echoed quietly sounding dazed, like he was lost in a dream. “I am...your omega?”
And yet...Tony said nothing. He simply looked down and kept walking. It was silent then, all the way to the guest room and Steve’s chest felt tight at the thought that he’d upset Tony for some reason. Which was surprising but still...
And Tony, of course leveled him with a glare.
“Says who?”
“Nothing my lord, I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Tony said earnestly though his voice shook and that gave it away. “I have no friends-“
But it didn’t matter. Steve had never been one for demanding so much of his partners in bed. Of the few partners he’d had, they’d always shared pleasure in the bedroom. He knew how to bring that about for both of them.
“Y-you want me-“ Tony struggled to stop laughing. In fact, he was laughing so hard, tears were coming out of his eyes. “-you want
Shocked, Tony’s eyes grew even wider. Then he started to laugh, a loud boisterous noise that had Steve frowning.
“It’s alright.” He reached up and cupped Tony’s cheek. “I had a feeling it was.”
“He will kill me! You don’t understand! He would much rather have me killed than risk others finding out what happened to me-!”
After a few days went by, Steve considered whether it was worth asking Tony again. And so, one evening, while Tony was quietly folding Steve’s clothes and rearranging his wardrobe, Steve approached him again and asked him about suppressants.
With a sigh, Steve hooked his hands under his plain white shirt and lifted it up. Once he was shirtless, he reached for his black breaches but paused when he heard a knock on the door.
“I do. I know of your kind heart. I want to be with you. I want you to be my mate.”
“Yes.” Tony said in a quiet voice and Steve growled a little and held Tony a little tighter.
He always did. Whether he wanted to or not.
“Just a scratch. Nothing to worry about.” He said and quickly reached up to cup Steve’s face in his hands and lean in to kiss him and start the evening as he always did since the first night.
“I don’t blame you for not trusting me.” He said, rubbing his hands up Tony’s waist gently. “I accept that. It simply means I need to prove myself to you.”
Omegas did not play. They simply were not taught such a thing. Unless they were high born in society, children of nobility or a performer in the arts, they did not learn, especially the common folk and the concubine group. To see an omega play was to ask for a light from a blind man. And yet Tony...
“Well it’s been a while.” Tony said plainly but narrowed his eyes as Steve came even closer. “What are you doing?”
“Alpha.” Tony spoke softly, nodding his chin down and looking up at him with a calm gaze. “It is an honor to see you.”
He looked at peace though. Even despite his actions.
“Oh, Tony...” Steve whispered, feeling just as lost and of course, that was what shattered the moment.
Tony was sitting cross-legged on the floor, wearing a translucent white long shirt that came up to his knees. He had his sleeves rolled up and was painstakingly scrubbing a solitary item against the washing rack, muttering several obscene words under his breath. With each shove of his hand, the water doused the clothing fully and released a wave of suds that built up into a lather in the water. Some of the water splashed back on him a few times, causing him to splutter and grumble even more.
Steve fought not to look to gleeful at the fact that Tony had left the title while addressing Stone. It was either a lapse in judgement or an intentional mistake. Either way, it made the blatant trust in Steve even more obvious.
He wasn’t supposed to, however. He was an omega concubine. And he had left his quarters without being called.
“No, I’m pretty sure you don’t.”
It was like an arrow had shot through Steve’s heart. But he couldn’t blame Tony.“I’m not lying.”
“No, uh, this is good.” Tony mumbled, suddenly looking embarrassed as he reached out and took the other cup. “Thank you.”
“You’ve lost weight.” Steve whispered softly into his ear, rubbing his thumbs gently over the pattern as he watched Tony look up at him through the mirror. Steve towered over him in size and a part of him had the sudden urge to wrap his arms around Tony and pull him against him if only to reassure himself that Tony was safe. His future omega.
That evening, when Sam left and Steve was left to his own devices, he spent more time watching Tony go about his routine.
“Of course I am, my lord. I am happy.” Tony replied in the same tone and feeling something begin to sink low in his stomach, Steve realised that Tony was still not smiling. And he had not even seemed to absorb Steve’s words.
“He looks thin. Does he eat well? Is he comfortable in his home?” Sam glared at him before jerking his head in Tony’s direction. Tony was busy assembling plates in the corner.
“Your father?”
Once Tony began to shift a little, Steve slowly began to push further, taking painstaking care to enter carefully and press deeper and deeper still, until finally he had fully entered and the base of his cock was pressed flush against the soft kiss of Tony’s hole.
Don’t you remember me? What on earth has gotten into you!?”
Light footsteps padded on the wooden floor. As soon as Tony came into sight, Steve looked up and beamed.
beautiful.
Tony jumped at the sound of his voice. Stunned, he turned and stared.
It had been early evening when he had been told of the arrival of some guests. His trusted beta servant had informed him that a strange alpha had asked to speak with him that very night; he had mentioned something about a proposition of sorts. Needless to say, Steve had been intrigued and had promised a meeting before the evening meal.
Steve could see the shock on Obadiah’s face. It made sense really. Why would an alpha, a young lord at that, want to claim a concubine? It was practically unheard of.
It was enough to make Steve pull him closer. He could barely contain his excitement.
Steve was looking at an omega that had been hurt under his care. A concubine who-
“Steve.” Sam said lowly and met his eye. “These omegas are never trained. Often they do what needs to be done. I’ve even heard that some handlers do not give the omegas suppressants.”
He knew who it would be. He was only expecting one guest after all.
Had Tony had dreams once? What was it he had said before? That he loved to watch the stars at night? That he had always wondered what it was like to craft a sword?
Feeling his breath catch, Steve turned back and looked at Tony, meeting the deep brown eyes that looked at him with such hesitance and hope, it hurt to see.
“Gentlemen. This is Tony. He’s my partner for the night.” Steve smiled and held his hand out to guide Tony forward.
Tony seemed to deflate at that. “I cannot. Please do not ask me for that.”
But still, Sam’s words continued to plague him.
Tony’s eyes widened and his tongue swept across his lips, giving them a glossy shine as he began to come closer. He knelt on the edge of the bed and ever so slowly approached Steve, crawling over the covers to slide up and settle between Steve’s legs. Then, slowly he leaned over and lifted himself up to straddle Steve’s thighs, giving himself an added height he hadn’t had before.
“My lord? Like this?” Tony asked, turning on his side and gazing up at Steve only a few inches away. When Steve opened his eyes, he noticed Tony had tucked a hand under his cheek and had let the other lie in the space between them. It was a shockingly open position for someone so hidden.
Curious, Steve raised a brow and looked at the man behind him. He had a much smaller figure and seemed to keep his head down and his hands tucked behind him. But from what Steve could see, the man had brown hair that appeared quite soft. Almost tempting enough for Steve to beacon him closer.
Thankfully, Steve had prepared for this.
“He was an engineer. I learned a lot from him.” Tony explained and then paused, looking momentarily lost. “Sometimes I wonder if he would’ve...”
“You could fall pregnant! Or worse, you could fall ill!”
Instantly Steve froze and below him, Tony froze. Steve could not believe what he had just said. He didn’t even know where that had come from...
“What could you possibly offer me?”
“I am no one, my lord. I am just here, with you-“
The omega was unlike anything he’d ever seen. Steve would’ve been a fool to turn the offer down.
“No, not at all.” Steve glanced at Tony then and frowned. The omega looked a little...disappointed.
Just as he had been
“You should sleep. You look tired so rest tonight. Obadiah can have you collected later in the morning.” Steve said, keeping his voice hushed as he guided Tony to sit on the edge of the bed. In the moonlight, Tony looked even more exhausted than before and a faint gleam on his cheeks caught Steve’s eye.
“Tony is in the laundry room. We’re not allowed to speak to him today.”
Steve had nothing left to say. He knew his decision.
“I am sorry.” Steve began the next day, as soon as they woke up the next morning. Tony was curled against him, their bodies loose and warm after a night of excitement.
“Our handler, sir.” The omega mumbled, wringing his hands together and turning his gaze to the floor. “He’s not happy with Tony at the moment.”
“Tony...are you happy?”
“I want him.”
Tony turned sharply at that, suddenly looking even more shocked than before. “You...what?”
“It doesn’t mean that is right. I will never speak to you that way again and if I do, you have full permission to slap me as I deserved.”
Had anyone touched Tony with kindness? Had held him and kissed him and told him how beautiful he was out of love rather than lust?
“Maybe I can tell you about where I used to live. I was once very-“
Out of nowhere, an idea struck Steve’s mind.
“It does not matter. You should not be here.” Steve said, and ignoring Tony’s protest, he hauled the omega out of his seat and began to drag him to the guest room. Or rather, he helped Tony because the omega didn’t seem to be able to walk straight and once again, the strange feeling of wrong took over.
He was glad they had spent so much time together. And that Tony was smiling with such joy in his eyes.
They kissed again, their lips melting together in a wave of heady warmth. The sensations, the touch and sight and taste and smell of Tony was everywhere and his heart and mind sung with pleasure at the thought. This omega had captured every part of him and tonight he would enjoy this omega and make good on his promise to give Tony what he wanted.
“And what is that?”
“I...”
With a sigh, Steve sucked in a breath and focused on calming his body. They were covered in sweat and Tony’s body was locked around his for the time being. It was worth trying to get some sleep.
The room went quiet again. Steve couldn’t even begin to address his thoughts.
He just wanted Tony to be happy. That would was all.
“For your happiness, my lord. Should you ever wish for my company, please do not hesitate to speak to my handler.”
How many times had Tony hidden his tears? How many times had he closed himself away?
“I thought we’d get frisky, but I didn’t think you’d frisk me,” Tony said with a breathless gasp.
“Kicked me out of their home and my apartment. Cut off everything but the trust fund, since it was legally mine already.”
“You still can later, if you want,” Steve said with a wink. “I wouldn’t say no to getting to find out how it feels to get those curls under my hands.”
Flustered, Steve grabbed the book and added it to the pile in his arms hoping to hide his burning cheeks, “Thank you, Mr. Stark. ”
wishes. Ty told me how you wanted to focus on SI, how I was a distraction. He said you wanted a clean break but--”
He smiled. “Peter. He said he thought I’d like it.”
“Steve,” Bucky prodded.
“It was great! They had this thing, it was set up like the old timey photos, where they had to stay still for a long time and make this face,” Peter paused long enough to pull the sides of his mouth with his fingers, “and it was really cool.”
It wasn’t just a gut feeling. He had a son.
Steve laughed, squeezing Tony’s slighter frame tighter. “Just let me know when halftime is over, baby. I plan on scoring a few more touchdowns in the second half.”
The children were too young to present and scent yet, but the parent’s scents drifted on the breeze. A chaotic mix that was thankfully muted by the open air and early morning dampness. Except one.
Tony locked his legs around Steve’s thighs with a growl, “If you even think about getting off this bed…”
Steve rounded the edge of the Reflecting Pool to start another lap around. It was still early. The sun cracked the sky behind him and the air still had the crispness of dew. He caught sight of Sam on the other long edge as he passed, the only other jogger still out with him. Another two laps would mark the end of 10 miles, and while it was a little more than usual, Sam asked to be pushed before the qualifying race for the Boston Marathon next month.
Steve brushed his bangs from his forehead with a huff. Did that group of rowdy elven youths have to touch
He walked through the open plan penthouse, aiming for the bedroom where he probably stashed his bag in the closet in his rush to be home a few weeks ago. “Tony? Are you home? I’m grabbing my bag befo--”
He looked over the dessert display for a moment before pointing to a deep indigo cake, “What’s in the Darkest Night Torte?”
Tony turned toward him, indulgently orgasm loose and pliant, and made a valiant attempt to lick his own flavor from every nook of Steve’s mouth. Steve’s head spun, Tony’s hand and thigh between his legs ratcheting him higher until he pulled away to Steve’s frustrated groan.
“I have copies for you. It’s ok, take your time. You look like I just told you I was pregnant right now,” Tony joked.
“Isn’t it?” Bucky continued before Steve could get a word in, “We built in a couple extra meals with the caterer, just in case things changed. What do you say?”
Steve pulled Tony into a hug, and Tony let himself be pulled. He squeezed tightly, offering silent comfort. He heard a small click and woosh of the front door being opened.
“I love you, too,” Steve said on a laugh. “If you want the other thing, we have to hurry.”
“Where did you learn to talk like that? Is there a dungeon I need to know about? Do you want to go get changed into some leather?”
“So,” Tony said, breaking the awkward silence, “Where should I start?”
“So you made it out of the sandbox, huh?” His voice was flat and toneless.
“What am I gonna do, Buck?” Steve slumped against the counter.
Instead, the real Mr. Stark wore fitted dark wash jeans that stretched nicely over the curve of his strong legs every time he crouched to adjust some part or fitting on the robot in the center of the room, and a deep red button down with a gold tie clipped to it so that nothing caught in the servos and gears. His sleeves were rolled up, and he kept tiny screwdrivers in his breast pocket. Every time he grabbed one and poked the tip of his tongue out in concentration, Steve choked on his own tongue.
Steve thought.
“I don’t know, the reaction was so fast, and he told us to go, and we thought he was right behind us, he pulled the fire alarm and,” Ned paused. There were other voices talking to him.
- an omega standing back from the group wrapped up in a black pea coat. The styled black hair and goatee were different from the crazy mop of curls and bare baby face of ten years ago, but it was him. His profile the same as the one Steve saw in his dreams, memories replayed of love and ache and the sweet twist of pleasure on his face every time Steve knotted him. The reason why Steve switched to tea, so he could make it through a morning without embarrassing himself in front of his squad and roommates.
Tony scribbled out the letters on the page with a little more force than necessary. This shouldn’t be
Tony scoffed a little. The barista called his name and he retrieved his cup and reached for the sugar packets, but Steve was there holding out four, the number he always took in his coffee.
Steve hated those days. He despised them, especially now that he knew Tony hadn’t been on suppressants. Tony would not be with him and it was not just that. Tony often came back with more marks than before.
“That’s right, I’m simply tired my lord, please, you don’t need to worry.” Tony promised and cleared his throat, looking away again. “I just wished to play one last time.”
“But I will find out. I already have an idea.” Steve insisted, leaning forward and steepling his fingers under his chin. “I have no choice. Otherwise I will not be able to have you.”
He heard the door creak open and felt footsteps vibrate against the wooden floor. The small bedroom allowed for some echo, so he was able to trace the exact footing. In his mind, he pictured the small omega-Tony-sauntering in with a graceful smile. The essence of omegas.
“You don’t need to worry, alpha. I’m fine. It’s a wonderful feeling to know however that you-“
“I know.” Tony smiled a little, only there was a strange feeling Steve couldn’t shake. As if something was wrong. Like looking at the jagged edges of roughened glass.
At the front door, Obadiah reached for Tony and greeted Steve with a gleeful smile. “How was he then? Did you enjoy him?”
The omega didn’t even bother to hide his smile at that. He simply looked up and made direct eye contact with Steve and instantly, Steve felt his breath catch.
“Are you lord Rogers?” The omega asked and Steve nodded.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have touched the piano.” He said hoarsely and shaking his head, Steve realized he suddenly didn’t care. Tony could touch a
Following the earlier meeting, Obadiah had promised to return later in the night to gift Steve with something even more satisfying. How Obadiah would do this was beyond Steve but still, he didn’t question it.
“My lord, I am here.” Tony said, settling beside him and leaning forward to drop his chin and look up at him in a sultry manner. “Would you prefer me to use my mouth instead? I can do that for you if you like?”
” Tony gasped softly and Steve slowly began to enter him.
“I picture you in the manor not a tavern. Admit it, even you agree.”
“I did. It really was beautiful.”
The look Tony had given him had been so lost, Steve had physically stopped his writing to look at him.
Tony’s eyes widened with each word but he didn’t react verbally. He simply shook his head over and over.
“Not many alphas no.” Obadiah smiled, only the skin around his lips was tight. “Why? Do you want me to get him more experience? Did he not meet your requirements? Did he misbehave?”
Steve frowned. “Why?”
“I wonder what you used to do. Before all this. What your life was like. I’m sorry I shut you out.” Steve whispered, releasing a heavy sigh as he felt something sit low in his chest. Tony had tried before and had been shot down for his efforts. Now Steve feared Tony would never trust him again-
“You can be honest with me. Tell me who you are Tony.”
“You will only speak when spoken to. Do you understand?”
“I...” Something had plagued Steve’s mind in the morning. While Tony had been good as gold, even tidying up his room before he’d woken, something still did not sit right with Steve.
“Shhhh. No one will hurt you-“
He began to ask questions.
“Don’t hold your breath.” Tony murmured, but let out a frustrated noise when Steve pulled the clothes out of his reach.
“As I said my lord. It is good to see you.” Tony said bleakly and smiled wanly as realization dawned on Rhodes face. “Should you ever wish for my company, please do not hesitate to speak to my handler.”
Moving in tandem they both began to move their bodies in sync, Steve’s hard length filling Tony fully and brushing up against his prostate in the perfect way so as to make Tony’s body shiver. He whined under the movements but didn’t stop and his cock was beautifully curved upwards between them and continued to leak over his belly, and finally that was the tipping point for Steve. The image of Tony so wanton and pretty was enough to push Steve over the edge.
Tony’s face paled at the words and he seemed to look accusingly at the tea, almost as if it was poisoned.
“Concubines are trained to please alphas. It is what they want.”
“It is not alright-“
In fact, it was as if he no longer knew how to smile.
“If it’s alright, I’d love to take a look around the brothel. Is that alright? Perhaps it’s time I choose an omega for myself.”
Tony’s whole body froze. He looked like he even stopped breathing for a moment. So Steve breathed for him.
Pulled in by the music, Steve drifted closer to his main room where the piano was tucked into the corner. He had not seen it used since he had first moved into the house and so he would never have expected such a song to be played. Yet here he was, listening to something so calm and soothing-
“I said it’s a bad idea. I’m still on the thinking part.” Tony mumbled under his breath but Steve couldn’t help beaming at the words.
“Tony? Is that you?” A familiar voice called out and Steve watched as Tony stilled.
“What...ah, what kind of things?” Steve swallowed, shuffling closer, his voice just as quiet so as to not break the moment.
“I will be over there. Take as much time as you need. I will keep an eye.” Steve promised, glancing meaningfully at Tony. It was clear Rhodes understood.
“I am not worried! I simply wish to know!” He snapped up at him and somehow, even with Tony being smaller and more vulnerable in his arms, Tony looked to be the one who was silently laughing at him.
Steve lifted his chin up and smiled serenely. He knew what part to play, and after careful discussion with Sam, he had known what to say. “He pleases me.”
“Of course.” Tony smirked and then frowned. Probably because he was doing a poor job of hiding his grimace. “Is that...is that not what you want?”
It wasn’t long before there was a knock on the door. At his signal, the door swung open.
It was Tony.
As if sensing the scrutiny, the smaller man looked up briefly, though he was still partially hidden from Steve’s sight by the alpha, but from what little he saw, he came to a quick realisation.
“That’s the spirit! You know you are always welcome to him anytime! You can do much better anyway!”
“I’m sorry your first time wasn’t the most loving. But I can promise you will always feel loved from this point on. I will always take care of you. Let our next time together be our new first time together. I’ve decided I will not touch you until we are bonded. When you are ready.”
“I am told I am very skilled. It would be an honor to pleasure you, my lord. You may use my mouth or any other part of my body that you desire.” Tony continued with a hollow voice and an empty gaze and suddenly a cold realization dawned on Steve.
“I can at least save you.” He breathed and nuzzled gently, hoping desperately for Tony to understand, to say yes, to finally be happy-
“No.” Steve cut him off and squeezed him admonishingly. “Sleep.”
Steve had turned Tony down sharply at that.
To his shock, Tony launched himself forward and threw his arms around Steve, hugging him as tightly as he could with as much strength as he could carry. His body clutched onto Steve like a lifeline, and while he tried to nuzzle closer, Steve could already feel the rapid beat of his heart.
It took a moment for Tony to close his mouth. When he did, he looked lost.
“You are
“You are
“It’s as I said before. You should be safe Tony. No one should hurt you and you deserve what is yours-“
“I wish you didn’t have to leave.” Tony whispered under his breath and to Steve’s dismay, began to grow quiet again.
“Well I thought I was too.” Steve said lightly, watching smugly as Tony’s smile dropped. “But I guess I was wrong in thinking a smart omega like you would know I care about you.”
Tony simply smiled and looked up at him again briefly before baring his neck, the submissive behavior returned. “I’m here. Whatever you need me for, alpha.”
“Well good!” Obadiah clapped his hands and nodded to his betas. “These fine young men are part of my group. If you wish to have Tony again, you only need send a message to these men at the front of my home. I promise you, they will be able to bring Tony to you by evening itself. Of course, the earlier you request him, the better. You should be aware that we give the omegas to whichever alphas have asked first. And I am aware Tony has caught the eye of a few others. I hope that’s not an issue?”
Of course that wasn’t all.
“Perfect.” Steve gasped as they pulled away and caught their breath. “You are well trained.”
Later, after several hours had passed, Steve finally noticed Rhodes and Tony stand. He was not surprised, it had been hours but still.
“Oh...alpha that was...” Tony seemed hazy, barely able to bring his thoughts together and Steve could sympathize.
How could he have been so naive, so foolish as to think Tony had chosen this? What omega, what person would choose a life like this?
“Do you not know you should not be here-?”
“You got this for me?” Tony sounded uncharacteristically small. Almost as if he was in complete awe. Steve let out a sigh of relief.
The glazed expression was back in Tony’s eyes. Steve’s heart sunk further and began to beat louder.
“And not for yourself?” Steve asked gently, giving Tony a knowing look when the omegas expression saddened. It was like he knew there was no way out for him.
How could he have ever thought Tony was just a concubine? How could he misunderstand the life of an omega concubine so much? One look through Tony’s eyes was more than enough to see.
.” And really Steve didn’t know what to say to that. Only that he could not read Tony’s expression now.
“Obadiah, my lord. Obadiah Stane.” The man replied, looking positively thrilled. Calm, Steve nodded and pointed at the omega.
“I am offering him, my lord.”
“Come in!” He said, making sure the shirt was carefully placed on the soft lined chair by the desk. His room was somewhat dark as the previous owner had clearly preferred dark woods for the furniture and deep maroon colors.
Is that you?”
“I can.” Steve rumbled and pulled Tony close, sinking one hand into Tony’s hair. Carefully, he guided Tony to his neck and waited. He felt Tony gasp under his touch and shift to bury his nose further into Steve’s neck. He knew he could sense it-the fierce warmth and love and protection-
Was Tony facing his heat? Was that the problem, unlikely as it was with the suppressants being started again.
“Okay, what is the matter?” Tony sighed, putting the tea down completely. Steve couldn’t stop beaming.
“Alpha, will you come with me?” Tony smiled eagerly and this time, Steve gave him the warmest smile he could. He would never turn down Tony’s smile again.
Steve tilted his head and regarded the omega.
“Obie won’t allow it.” Tony cut in sharply, something dark simmering in his eyes. A hate Steve had never seen before. “I have had plenty of alphas come to me and offer a claim. The answer has always been no. And there’s a reason for that.”
“I want you...to lie with me.” Steve said quietly and at Tony’s questioning gaze, Steve climbed up the bed and lay down, patting the space beside him. He could see the hesitation in Tony’s eyes but knew Tony would obey.
“Who would dare-!?”
“What?” Tony’s brow knitted together as his eyes flicked over Steve. “What do you mean?”
Not wanting to give away his own composure, Steve simply grunted his acceptance and pulled Tony close again, settling the omega on his lap and looking up at him. It was then that Tony seemed to curl his arms around him again and guide him closer.
“An hon-Tony, what is
“Mmm...it’s really...really nice...” Tony sighed and slowly his eyes fell shut as he leaned into the touch. Keeping quiet, Steve lifted up the covers higher over Tony so as to not disturb him. He kept running his finger through his hair though and was awed to see how at peace Tony looked.
“Steve!?” Tony exclaimed, as soon as he was caught sight of him and nearly dropped his neat bundle of clothing on the floor. His eyes were as large as dining plates and he seemed completely frozen in place. Steve could almost sympathize if he wasn’t too busy letting his emotions run wild at the thought of his wonderful future omega being with him. Now that he had made his decision, everything felt like it was slotting into place.
“If you believe it is pleasure, then I will give it to you. I will have you tonight.”
“He’s not as young as some of the other omegas. It would be better to have him pregnant now without the hassle of him stealing an alpha away from the young ones. You see what I mean?”
“Thank you.” Tony breathed and suddenly he was smiling again, the warm joyous smile that Steve was growing to love more and more.
“What is it?”
Tony had said the exact same words to him when they first met. Had offered the same things and promised the same things. Just as he was told to do.
“Tony.” Steve started, frowning as the omega continued to cough in his arms. “You should not be playing.”
“Shhhh.” Steve murmured and pressed his lips over Tony’s neck. “It will get better soon, do not worry.”
“Omega.”
him.”
“Go.” Steve ordered, waving a hand towards the bathroom without looking at Tony. “Tend to your wounds.”
Perhaps that was what had made Tony more relaxed. More comfortable to wonder around the large expanse of the manor, as Steve soon discovered.
“Your handler is not the most intelligent. And I do not have time to waste on him.” Steve shrugged, reaching out to pour the tea he had set out on a small tray on the table. Carefully, he poured it into the two China cups. “Please, have a seat.”
“Anything. Everything.” Tony sighed and his lips curved up a little at what Steve guessed was the memory of another life. “I always imagined I’d build things. Like my father did.”
“Hush now.” Steve rumbled lowly, placing his hands on Tony’s and taking the dripping wet wad of clothing and dumping it on the floor next to them. “I’ve made my decision.”
Almost shocked, Steve laughed a little out of disbelief. “Have others asked you to do that?”
“And what do you get out of this?” Steve asked, just as quiet, and for a moment, he could almost pretend they didn’t have an audience. Tony, for his part, seemed unaffected.
“You may use my mouth or any other part of my body that you desire. Whatever you wish, my lord.” Tony breathed into his ear, before pulling back and standing tall before him.
But he was a simple man. He just wanted Tony to be happy. That was all.
The omega was
It was odd in some ways but Steve had taken charge. It was as if the omega was almost happy to give charge over to him. He had expected Tony to take the lead.
“Your tea. The way you hold the cup and hold yourself. Even the way you cross your legs. It’s obvious.” Steve explained, watching the dawning realization on Tony’s face. “Only an omega born into a noble family would sit in such a way. You have been trained in courtroom behavior.”
“I don’t know what to say.”
“But I-“
“Why? Did you not like the song?” Tony winked even as he sounded choked, and for a moment Steve could almost forget he was his concubine. Tony’s snark was a key part of him, and one Steve could no longer picture him without.
Tony seemed to stare back at him in pure shock. His eyes were wide and his breathing was quiet, and yet there was something there that Steve could not read. Like Tony was processing what he had heard and unable to decipher anything at all.
“I am aware.”
Tony stared at him with wide, pale eyes. “I don’t understand...”
“It’s alright my lord.” Tony yawned and stretched, resting his cheek against Steve’s broad chest. “I do not take offence. After all, I am here for you."
“My lord? Is everything alright?” Tony asked quietly (eyes low-
Using his grip, Steve sharply spun Tony around and pulled him close, leaning down to level him with a firm look.
“Of course. I remember it well.” Tony looked down and fiddled with his cuffs. Steve nodded and swallowed.
“Alpha...” Tony whispered and Steve fought not to smirk when the omega appeared blissed out.
As the door clicked shut, Steve straightened his coat and took a deep breath. He’d put on his best clothes for the occasion, a nice blue vest with a white undershirt, dark slacks and a nice long blue coat with detailed embroidery at the cuffs. He had to look presentable for what he had planned for the night.
Hearing the sharp voice in the distance, Steve turned away and looked up. Colonel Rhodes, a recent visitor and returning soldier (from what he had been told) was fast approaching Tony.
“Of course alpha.” Tony said, keeping his head bowed down. “It is an honor to see you.”
“He is. Is he your mate, lord Rogers?”
But Steve wasn’t paying attention to that. He was too busy watching Tony carefully.
“A concubine, my lord.”
“Do you remember what I said to you the other night?” Steve said lowly, coming close enough to be just inches away. Tony continued to stare at him, eyes wide and very dark.
“Mmmm.” Tony hummed and shifted a little closer to let his skirt settle over them. “I suppose I am.”
He was being forced. It was the only explanation.
So in turn, Steve found himself beginning to ease his behavior. He started to ask Tony to simply lie with him instead. They did not need to do more all the time.
“Yes. Of course you are.” Steve murmured softly and watched with a sickening dread as Tony blinked rapidly and sniffed before bending over to pick up his thin robe and carry out his morning duties.
He no longer cared for the belief around concubines. It was clear society did not know.
That was until today, of course. It had been three weeks since their initial agreement and for the first time, Steve noticed something else. Something
More weeks went by. Steve stopped sleeping with Tony. He simply asked him to sleep beside him.
-seemed to be wearing very little. Only a knee length partially sheer skirt that was maroon in color and held by a thin gold band and some plain gold pieces of jewelry. A long sweeping necklace and a gold band that sat on his upper arm and little else. Just the sandals and that was it.
“No, my omega. I’ll take this. Leave it to me.” Steve said and smiled when Tony scowled at him.
Tony blinked. “You can’t.”
“This is unacceptable. I will not have it.” Steve shook his head and met Tony’s empty gaze. Tony was just staring at him, the clothes long forgotten. “I will get you suppressants and you will take medication, even as a preventative measure.”
With a sigh, Steve sucked in a deep breath and released it, letting all the anger and fear and pain leave his body with it. Only the guilt remained.
“I am sorry. For what I said last night, it was-“ Steve cleared his throat and looked away. “It was unrequired.”
here?”
Tony was not taking any suppressants.
“But...what?” Tony blinked, sounding dazed  and before Steve could stop himself, he reached out and pulled Tony into his arms, hands warm and firm as he held Tony close and didn’t let go.
After what felt like hours, the sobs finally calmed down and Tony eventually pulled back and Steve saw something that he never thought he’d see.
Tony had finally agreed.
“Well I do try, alpha.” Tony smiled a little and tentatively leaned his head against Steve’s chest, looking up hopefully when Steve frowned a little at him. “May I lie my head here?”
“Shhh, it’s alright. You’re okay.” Rhodes murmured and at Steve’s nod, guided Tony to a small table in the corner, settling next to him. Once they were settled, Steve leaned over them and spoke quietly.
“Enough! You won’t speak to me unless spoken to again.”
Instantly, Steve yanked his hands back as if burnt. Omega concubines were shameful and whatever they imparted on themselves was their choice. Steve had nothing to do with it.
It was as Steve had thought.
“It’s a bad idea.” Tony sighed and squirmed out of Steve’s hold. After being released, Tony made his way to the collection of clothes.
Tony nodded and smiled shyly. Steve did not smile back.
“What are you doing here?” Tony asked, nearly tripping as he moved out of the way while the servant closed the door. “I thought I was meant to meet Stone.”
Just as Steve was about to lean in and kiss Tony again, he paused.
Everyone else was silent. All the alpha and beta men and women were silent. The room was so tense, it was palpable.
“Yes-!”
-that letting concubines play such games was dangerous. But he would not bring himself to stop Tony from doing so. Even if he knew Tony did not want such comfort. Only his knot.
That’s-“
Tony’s head jerked up at that and Obadiah seemed just as stunned. Steve kept his face as stoic as possible, not wanting to reveal how uncomfortable the interaction truly made him feel.
“Lord Rogers.” He said, collecting the wet bundle of clothing and pushing himself up onto his feet. “What are you
“What did you say!?”
“What a beautiful omega! My, Fury, isn’t he wonderful!?” Lady Sharon, wife to one of the local wealthy tailors said delightedly. Nicholas Fury, the stoic mayor of the simply raised a brow.
It was a loaded question. Steve knew that Tony had the choice to reveal something about himself. A chance to speak up and explain himself as Steve had known the omega to try and do before. Tony was never a concubine to be underestimated.
Bruises. Of varying shapes and sizes. Tony’s breathing was shallower than usual under his hands.
Tony was slowly rousing from his slumber on his chest, and gently, Steve sifted his hand through Tony’s hair.
“Of course alpha.” Tony said softly and again, when Steve tried to smile at him in the hopes that he would gain a response, the omega did not smile back.
“I don’t under-“
“This isn’t the life you
to consider
Looking away, Tony sucked in a deep breath and spoke.
It was only after Steve had left Tony to his own devices and returned to his own room that something dawned on him.
“Oh.” Tony said softly, looking confused for a moment before he slowly reached for the dark blue robe he usually wore after they slept together. Silently, he wrapped it around himself and let the material fall to his knees. Distantly, Steve wondered if Tony ever got cold when he took his clothes off.
Now he was calm. Confident. More seasoned.
“I care about you.” Steve shrugged, folding his arms and tipping his chin up. “I would be lucky to have you.”
“Omega.” Steve grit his teeth and ever so gently circled his arms around Tony and pulled him closer, studying the marks on his sides. Hand prints on his skin.
That night, when Steve lay down and waited for Tony to come closer, he sat up higher and circled his arms around Tony.
For once, Steve ignored his other mind and continued to bring Tony onto the edge. Slowly, when the omega was blissed out enough, he pressed a finger gently inside and began to slowly work him open.
Thus began Steve’s newest change to his lifestyle. While he had never considered the possibility of making use of omega concubines, Tony had quickly become a part of his day to day routine. Every evening, Tony would be escorted to his house and every morning, he would be retrieved and after some negotiation, Steve even began to push to late afternoon. Money and respect in the community had a high place in the town, and with the manor, Steve had quickly become the richest man of them all.
Steve stayed above, watching the omega for a moment.  Silently, Tony stared back, not saying a word, something Steve had always insisted in bed. And now he finally had it.
Tony did not mention the change to Obadiah, as Steve learned. And he did not either.
With a slowly re-emerging smile, Tony crawled up and straddled Steve again and this time, began to shift until his cock began to brush against Steve’s, the contact spreading shivers down both their spines.
“Why-“ Tony purred, and began to step closer, the material of his skirt brushing his legs gently. “I am told I am very skilled. It would be an honour to pleasure you, my lord.”
“Don’t omega concubines prefer to avoid such displays?”
“Tony-“
for what he had done.
Steve had not expected to return home one day to such a sound. The gentle press of piano keys that sang a beautiful melody, filled the manor. Each note carefully following after another into a song that both soothed Steve’s mind and soul and called for more.
“You are not a concubine. And you...you need protection.” And love. Love and care that Steve wished to provide. “I can give that to you. Allow me to claim you. Let me provide for you.”
Tony was in a fully submissive position. Something only his future bonded alpha should see.
“Tony, my god, it has been too long, what have you-“
“I am.” Steve folded his arms and smiled a little when Tony’s mouth fell open. “All I want is for you to agree.”
“I am whatever you want me to be, alpha.” Tony whispered with an empty gaze. “I am always happy with you. Always.”
Everything was laid out perfectly and Steve had planned everything to the last piece. Even everything down to the fiber of the clothing had been carefully selected. Steve would not fail on this night.
“I know my lord. I can be good for you.”
“You will look after me, won’t you alpha? You won’t leave me to suffer, will you?” Tony whispered softly and to Steve’s surprise, leaned even closer until he was resting his head on his collar bone as well. His soft brown hair brushed his chin gently and before Steve could even stop himself, he was reaching out and cupping the omegas waist.
“He is a concubine. I frequently request him.” Steve continued to cut into the food. When he looked up, he realized Sam was staring at him.
“Did you have a good evening?” Steve asked gently, feeling lighter than before as Tony beamed at him and nodded.
“You may already be!” Steve growled, barely able to contain his rage at the thought.
To his surprise, Tony looked genuinely shocked to be asked that. But after a moment of staring, he huffed and shrugged lightly.
sorry. I should never have said something so awful to you. I was cruel and I can’t apologize enough.”
He played beautifully. Like he was born to play. Like he had always known and would always play.
Tony shook his head and kept smiling. “That’s rich. And I thought you were smart.”
The silence that filled the room was heavy and all encompassing. For a moment, Steve regretted what he said. Although he had not lied.
“I know.” He replied, wrapping his arms around Tony again and hugging him close. He squeezed around Tony tighter and buried his face between Tony’s shoulder blades, basking in their shared warmth.
After Steve returned with the suppressants, Tony took his first dose and they spent the evening simply completing tasks, Steve being sure to watch Tony for any reactions or concerns. Every so often, Tony would glance back at Steve and smile. And every time, Steve’s heart would begin to race.
They continued to descend the stairs after that, this time hand in hand and to Steve’s pure delight, Tony would not stop smiling all the way.
“You once asked me what my fantasy was.” Steve murmured, keeping his hand on the low of Tony’s back. “Well, I have my answer for you.”
The omegas all paused what they were doing to stare at him. Then they all glanced at each other before one stepped forward.
As Steve turned the corner, fully prepared to praise the player, he caught sight of them and froze.
“You’re a beautiful, clever omega. A man with so much potential. You shouldn’t be in this position.”
It was beyond concerning. Steve could not understand how such a drastic change had occurred. Weren’t concubine omegas supposed to be happy?
“Of course.” Steve said, sounding perfectly reasonable and smiled warmly. “I completely agree.”
“Then why are you here? You should not have left the room without being called-“
“It’s fine.” Tony sighed and tugged his corset down. “Ask.”
“Love? Steve, you do not love me.” Tony said harshly, though his voice broke. “You do not even know me.”
.” Steve growled and under him, Tony paled. But he didn’t move his hands out of Steve’s grip.
It hurt to hear but perhaps he was going about it the wrong way. Perhaps he needed to prove himself to Tony first and give him more reasons to trust him. Claiming could come later.
“Anthony Edward Stark. Omega son of Stark.”
“May I request him for tonight?”
“Why do you have an omega serving you? That’s not right Steve.”
He never got an answer to any of those questions. But there was one question that he did receive an answer to. And it continued to haunt him.
“This was a mistake.” He admitted, slowly opening his eyes. “I do not get involved in such acts.”
Obadiah seemed to laugh at that and clap Tony on the back heartily. “He really is, there’s no doubt. Perhaps you would even say he is the prettiest of my lot. Hard to say really, I have so many.”
“At this brothel. With your handler?” Steve asked, raising a brow and stepping closer.
“Oh, but I do.” Steve said with a dark tone and folded his arms as he met Tony’s gaze. “I refuse to allow this to continue. You may be a concubine but you will not become a parent. Not until you are ready.”
“I hope I am to your liking, alpha.”
“What?”
Taking Tony’s hand, he tugged him close and pressed his lips to his soft hair. There he whispered;
It took a few minutes for Tony to move. When he did, he carefully walked around Steve, keeping a watchful eye on him as he placed his bundle of clothing on the bed.
“Your handler, he’s had offers before?”
“How can I believe you? You’re just another alpha. You’re all the same.”
Before Steve could say anything, the tune began to die down. Eventually, the rhythm came to a stop and relieved, Steve stepped forward, only to frown when Tony’s hands slid off the keys.
“Sam, you worry to much-“
Steve blinked and shook his head. “No no. Nothing’s wrong.”
“Your name is Tony?” Steve rumbled, rubbing his thumbs over the soft skin and feeling Tony shiver against him. “Have you been trained in the art of pleasing an alpha?”
“You already provide for me.” He mumbled but looked away the moment he caught Steve’s stare and at Steve’s insistence, climbed under the covers.
“Well I can arrange for more-“
But Tony was by no means totally submissive. He continued to talk often, wanting to know if Steve had heard about a man by the name of James Rhodes, or would like to see what he had made in his spare time.
“My father liked to make things. All sorts of things. Maybe you would like to come see what we used to make toge-“
As planned, one of his betas was bringing Tony to this tavern. The same tavern as the other night, only Steve had hired a private bedroom for them and had taken time to dress the room appropriately and prepare for the much quieter evening. It would be perfect.
And love. He loved Tony.
“Well, that’s good! I was worried he was beginning to play up.”
He was loath to admit he still felt some remorse for what he’d said the night before. It hadn’t been the kindest thing and Tony had been much quieter after.
“Oh, god, alpha!” Tony cried and squeezed his eyes shut and began to clench tightly around him. It took every ounce of strength to hold back.
“Your friend, the one in the tavern, he said you had dreams once, what did he mean?
“He was very good.” Steve nodded and glanced at Tony briefly who was not looking back, far too busy looking at the ground. “Very beautiful.”
“Tony, at least think about what I’m suggesting.”
will ensure it. Please.” He whispered and waited with a racing heart.
It took a few moments but when it finally did, the reality hit him almost as hard as the sharp slap. He felt like he had been doused in ice.
"No alpha."
“My lord?”
Yet Steve knew instantly this man was no threat. Otherwise he would not have come so close.
And Steve would never let him go.
Steve had to look up to the ceiling to hide away his tears. Blinking rapidly, he nodded and did not look at Tony, even as he heard him approach.
Tony’s eyes darted towards his like he couldn’t believe it. Stunned, he silently reached up and held onto Steve’s wrist with both hands, looking like a man holding onto the boat for dear life.
“I am so sorry Tony, god, I need to get you out of here, I need to-“
That morning, when Tony left, Steve could not stop playing the words back in his mind.
To his delight, Tony had agreed to join him and after providing the finer clothes, he was able to introduce Tony to the other townsfolk.
“Yes please.”
“Do you feel well? You seem tired.” Steve instantly wished he hadn’t said it because as soon as he did, Tony’s smile dropped. The misery was there, it was just hidden away, tucked under the surface but close to the heart. And that hurt even more.
“Please my lord.” Tony implored and though he was smiling, Steve could see the hollowness in his eyes. “Such words will only depress me. I would rather not speak of such things.”
If Tony was offended, he didn’t show it. He simply tilted his head and considered Steve.
“It’s for you.” Steve said, not turning even though his heart was beating a fast pace.
Slowly, Steve put down the cutlery.
Steve had pictured many things. Riches, comfort, respect. But never once had he pictured himself to be the owner of an omega for a night. Especially not one such as this
It was nice to see. In a strange way, there was something intriguing about watching Tony’s behavior change and develop. While he spoke and acted confident, in the bedroom he was learning more and more and slowly building up his skills.
"Why not? Do you not enjoy giving pleasure to your alphas?"
“Rest, Tony. You need to rest.” Steve murmured and reached out to sift his hands through Tony’s dark hair, for once feeling certain that he needed to take the initiative. The strands were soft and wild under his hands, much like everything about Tony, but this was the first time Steve had touched it for any reason other than sex. And it felt wonderful and beyond right.
“Yes. I would like you to wear it tonight if that’s alright. But later, please sit with me first?”
“You want this.” Steve pushed, stepping closer when Tony tried to pick up the pile of clothes again. “You know what I can offer.”
“Omega, I’m going to come-“
When Steve collected his bundle, he turned and made to speak only to meet the sight of Tony dropping his head into his hands. Then to Steve’s absolute horror, Tony began to cry.
Then, almost as if by some spell, Tony was instantly beside him, mere inches away and leaning down to brush his ear.
Tony broke off suddenly and sucked in a deep breath, lightly brushing the back of his hand against his cheek. But Steve caught the slight sheen on his pale skin. Somehow it was all the more destroying to see.
“Happy. I mean to ask you. Are you happy?” Steve coughed gently into his cuff perhaps to hide the heat beginning to burn his cheeks. It was a daft question-Tony would surely laugh at him for even suggesting-
Lower and lower until he saw Tony fully. His smooth olive skin drew Steve in and his eyes fell lower and lower still until finally he was met with the most perfect sight. The skirt revealed Tony’s beautiful thighs that were parted to reveal the beautifully flushed head of his cock. A small trail of precum glistened proudly from the head, and though it was smaller than Steve’s, Tony had a beautifully sized cock for an omega. And an even more perfect hole that was coated in slick.
Tony went quiet for a moment. Then finally, he answered in a quiet tone.
“Do you want to know what my favorite pastime is? I used to enjoy such wonderful-“
“I meant what I said.” Steve swallowed, keeping his voice hushed. “I want to claim you.”
The movement paused again. Steve took a sip of his tea and sighed.
Someone had hurt Tony. Had
“Have some tea, Tony. Or if you’d like, I can make you something else?”
Tony closed his mouth at that. He seemed to have forgotten that he was meant to be hiding away from Steve, something Steve took full advantage of.
“Lie on your back omega. I want to see you when I enter you.”
With a huff, Tony gave him an unimpressed look, something that was far more attractive than it should’ve been, and hooked his arms around Steve’s neck to pull him in. And instantly, Steve brought their bodies closer, letting their lengths continue to brush and press against each other until they were both gasping and breathless.
“Yes alpha.”
Unable to agree or disagree, Steve nodded. What did one say to a man who held many concubines?
“You’re different. I think. There’s something different about you.”
“Breathe in.” Steve murmured, concentrating on tightening the strings and putting them into neat bows as Tony sucked in a breath. It was mesmerizing to imagine. Tony was wearing fine omega clothes. A traditional maroon corset that would suit him so well. Steve would have the privilege of seeing him like this.
be yours. Allow me to restore your birthright to you."
Tony gave him a look as if to say he had asked a highly daft question.
“Tony...may I ask you something? And you do not need to answer if you do not wish to.”
He frowned as he considered it. “I don’t know. I have never asked.”
Either way Tony just...smiled. His eyes looked hollow and unseeing and there was no shine in them anymore.
“Here?”
“Tony.” Rhodes breathed, reaching out to hug him as Steve had suspected he had wanted to do at their last meeting. Tony still seemed to be rolling in shock.
"Do not leave until I return. I will go to the physician now and return with them shortly. Do you suffer any ailments?"
“...Is everything alright alpha?” Tony asked quietly, leaning back a little against the seat and crossing his legs. “Is something wrong?”
“Oh, but I do. What would it take for you to consider me?”
“Right.” Tony replied eagerly and to Steve’s surprise, began to hum to himself as he folded the clothes. Determined by his new goal, Steve stood up and reached for his coat.
) and then suddenly he broke off and coughed into his hand and the noise jarred Steve. It sounded wet and crackled and that was when the fear finally took hold.
Tony didn’t know it yet but a plan was already forming.
“Tony.” Steve smiled warmly, nodding to the servant who had brought him up. “Thank you, you may leave now.”
And so he asked Tony to join him for an evening gathering at the local tavern. All high noblemen would be there to discuss town matters and Steve had the responsibility of showing face, especially with as he was the newest nobleman to join the town and was the owner of the large manor and its inhabitants.
Tony no longer had that spark he once wore. That winning smile and that hopeful look in his eyes. In fact, he never spoke of his own thoughts anymore. It was well and truly gone.
Tony just leveled Steve with a tired glare. “I know you’re just another alpha who wants a nice looking omega. You don’t really want me.” Tony sighed and turned away, bending over to pick up the pile at Steve’s feet but continuing to mutter; “No one ever does.”
“Put your clothes back on.” Steve said softly and looked up slowly as Tony paused and blinked at him.
Tony’s face began to blush at the words. But his fingers tightened over Steve’s.
“I am an open book, my lord.” Tony smiled, though it looked false even to Steve. “You know all there is to know.”
Steve turned away again. It was none of his business.
“Is that why you were so..” Tony trailed off, almost as if in awe. They both knew what he meant to say.
“My lord.” Tony said quietly and ducked his head down to the colonel.
“Why are you here?” Steve said in a low voice that spoke volumes. Still, the omega merely smirked and looked up.
Tony frowned, clearly not believing him but he accepted it and lifted the cup to his lips. Then he slowly pulled it away as Steve felt his lips begin to curl upwards.
“Then why are you shaking?”
Steve raised a brow. “What estate?”
“Why, the one in the corner of the town. You must come visit sometime. Every alpha always does.” The alpha smirked, and gestured towards the man behind him. “We have many such as him.”
, or create something extraordinary to make your father proud! And now you...” Rhodes voice trailed off as he sniffed and closed a hand over his mouth. Perhaps the denial was too strong. Perhaps the shock was incomprehensible.
“My handler? What do you wish to know about him? He is like any other handler.”
For a moment they were frozen there, held by each other in a moment of time. Tony looking up at his alpha with bubbling anticipation and unable to escape his grasp and Steve-
Tony looked wonderful tonight. He was wearing a dark blue waistcoat over his plain white shirt and black breaches and dress shoes. His usually unruly hair was stylishly spiked and his facial hair was immaculately trimmed. He wore very subtle makeup and Steve couldn’t help but feel drawn to him once again. It seemed Tony always had a new way to surprise him.
“Say yes.”
So Steve would have to choose for him.
“Tony. Tony, please say something.”
Tony did as he asked, though clearly hesitant. He settled into the seat and looked around the room, seeming to choose his words carefully.
“You’re so...” Tony swallowed and jerked a little when Steve glared at him. “No, I mean...”
Steve knew he shouldn’t. He knew it wasn’t necessary. But still, he could not help himself, no matter how much he did not care for the concubine.
“I know you like to tinker, or at least you would like to. I know you can play the piano beautifully. I know you’re a very curious omega who likes to talk. I know you’re a kind person who just wants to be happy. I know you’re brave-“ Tony looked up sharply at that but Steve carried on, holding that gaze with an iron fist. “I know you want nothing more than to be free.”
Tony fell silent and for a moment Steve wondered if he had finally been blessed with peace. But he was not so lucky.
The man’s smile grew, “Oh my god, Tony, it’s been years.”
He just had to use Happy to get his gifts to Tony.
He kept his focus during the ceremony, not missing any of his cues from Carol from being a blubbery mess. He didn’t drop the ring, or trip while escorting Mama Barnes to her seat. It wasn’t until his best friends were declared lawfully wed and presented to the world as Mr. and Mr. Barnes-Wilson that Steve even looked out at the crowd gathered as witnesses. There, in the back with his shades on, was Tony. The gorgeous man from the tailors, and a billionaire apparently, who
Steve didn’t say more but he did use the moment to remove the skirt completely. Once they had managed to remove it, Tony looked up at him and smiled a little nervously.
"It is my life, my lord. I enjoy it as much as one enjoys being with an alpha."
“I’ll prove it to you.” Steve vowed, bending over to scoop up the clothes pile before Tony could. “I’ll prove to you that I care about you. And you’ll admit to me that you want to be with me.”
“What did I say about promises?” Tony’s muffled voice said against his chest and Steve simply laughed and released him.
“I’m so sorry. I’m
“Do not kid yourself. I am a concubine belonging to a handler who sends me to pleasure alphas. There is no ownership here-“
It was different this time. Tony was not curled around him and giving him his body and his time. Steve was covering him and making him the center. And he was.
Tony as his omega. In society they would be recognized as alpha and omega, their bonding marks proud and displayed on their necks, their bodies joined by an unbreakable bond that would be clear to all.
Sam did not approve of his arrangements with the omega. When Steve first called Sam to dinner, he’d frowned at the sight of Tony bringing out plates with the other servants.
"I am not asking about your fancies. I am merely asking about your health."
Steve had not seen any issues with that. After all, Tony seemed to be happy.
Tony was quiet again, and this time, when Steve looked at him, he saw Tony’s gaze looking distant and lost. His skin was certainly pale with just a faint flush on his cheeks and for a moment, Steve worried that he might’ve fallen ill.
“You’re a noble. A noble-born.” Steve smiled, placing his own tea down to lean back and fold his arms smugly. It was obvious.
“Then you will take care of my needs. Please me as you like. Or rather-“
The answer
Tony had become more attuned to his needs. As a concubine he was also becoming more confident. Steve noticed there was a marked change in his behavior as compared to their first night. On the first night, Tony had been more hesitant. Or simply put, less experienced.
Life had not always involved the running of a manor. The inner workings of a carefully devised cog-run system were not something he was overly familiar with. And yet, after having bought out the lands, he’d found himself a new home. The manor belonging to the late nobleman of the town. A man who made his fortune through steam engines and ideas.
“How much experience has he had?” Steve asked and took note of the way Tony’s face paled. “Has he had many alphas?”
Thus, negotiating terms with Obadiah had been of no concern.
Frozen with something akin to fear, Steve dropped the bundle instantly and rushed forward. Guided by instinct, he stood in front of the weeping omega and pulled him close, wrapping him tightly in his arms.
“Why?”
“Indeed, good sir.” The alpha smiled broadly, lips curling upwards with a knowing look in his eyes. “But it is not simply about that, I assure you. I simply wished to offer a gift from our fine estate.”
And that spark was back. The omega was excited, even in his shock.
“You were very gentle. Thank you.”
As Tony turned and smiled warmly at him in all his naked glory, Steve could only watch with a heavy heart as he took in Tony’s appearance, perhaps for the first time.
Finally, after what felt like the longest minutes of his life, Tony began to speak.
“I never would have imagined you to come to a place like this.” Tony said, licking his lips and rubbing his palms against his thighs. “It seems...rustic.”
“Oh?”
Only Tony’s eyes were still wide. His hands were shaking by his sides.
“I suppose.” Tony sniffed, though his lips started to twitch as a smile began to form. “You must have liked the song then?”
“Well that’s alright.” Steve said, feeling relieved. “As long as you get some rest, we will not mention it. Perhaps we’ll just keep this secret between us. You could perhaps even play it again..”
“Me, my lord? Everything.” Tony laughed, and glanced back at Obadiah fondly. “There is no greater pleasure than to feel you. What more am I supposed to do?”
“He’s an omega.”
Wary, the omegas side-eyed each other before facing him.
“Yes my lord.”
It was like the world had shattered into pieces. The very ground could swallow him whole. He was going to
Feeling strangely proud, Steve turned and left them to their own devices. A strange righteousness had taken over, like he’d finally made the right choice and would see to it that something good came of it. It felt right to give Tony this.
It was unclear.
The omega was beautiful. Every detail, even down to the fine, clearly carefully styled facial hair was beautiful. He was truly a treasure.
“So are you.”
Only he couldn’t. Steve was afraid he would never laugh again.
Somewhere along the lines, he’d come to care for the omega. Especially the softer kisses and more delicate touches from the beginning had been what Steve had craved most. And since then his liking for the omega had begun to grow.
“I think we both know you’re more than that.” Steve cleared his throat and smirked. “Much more.”
“Tony?” Steve asked, stepping closer and shutting the door behind him. “Do you have a minute?”
“I can and I will-“
Taking vigil, Steve settled in his seat and called for the ale. In the distance, he could see Tony smiling.
Steve did however begin to wonder. About Tony and his life at the brothel.
The omega was sat in the soft red velvet seat, feet crossed underneath while his fingers brushed over the keys. Each finger played and moved and played, an endless chase that Steve felt drawn to. He knew he ought to stop it but he just couldn’t bring himself to.
Tony didn’t say a word. He continued to stare at a spot behind Steve’s shoulder but his hands shook.
“Alpha...”
“You can’t be serious!” Tony’s eyes were frantic and his whole body looked panicked. Steve didn’t care-it was the most lively Tony had been since they’d first met.
Finally Obadiah laughed.
Gently, Steve took Tony’s wrists in his hand and moved them aside. His eyes were fixed on the marks on Tony’s body, the blue marks blurred and imprinted on his skin.
“I believe I know who you are.” Steve beamed. “It is nice to meet you-“
repeat this to anyone. Ever.” Tony said quietly, his eyes full of rage and his voice full of discontent. He stared at Steve as if he had set a trap to ensnare him. But would do no such thing.
“You know...” Tony said quietly and dropped his eyes down to the center of Steve’s chest. “I’ve never met an alpha like you before.”
“Then let’s make it so!” Steve implored desperately, pulling Tony closer. “It’s not about pity, it is about my heart and my feelings for you. Have you never loved someone before?”
Carefully, Tony moved away from Steve and settled onto his back. Then, as Steve reached over and lined their bodies up, Tony shivered under him and waited for Steve to climb over him and enclose him completely.
Feeling broken to his core, Steve watched as Rhodes closed his eyes in pain.
The omega was thin, so thin, his ribs were beginning to show. His skin had paled considerably as compared to when Steve had first seen him and there were dark shadows under his eyes that even under the powdered makeup, Steve could see were deep in his skin. But the worst thing of all, was perhaps the very thing Steve had become so familiar with.
“He will be staying with us for a few days. As will you.” Steve explained calmly, fighting not to react to Tony’s absolutely shocked expression. “I have made the arrangements for us to depart to my old home in Brook. I would like him to stay with us until our bonding is complete and possibly after if he agrees. I would like him to serve as a witness to our bonding and be named your secondary alpha.” Then Steve lowered his chin and dropped his tone. "We will also sort out this business with Obadiah. I know about your father Tony. What he is owed."
“Mmm.” Tony hummed, putting his hands against his hips and swaying a little on his heels as he waited for Steve to finish. Once the corset was in place, Steve could no longer resist the urge to reach out and cup Tony’s waist from behind. He couldn’t help but think of how perfect his hands fitted there. But then a certain sadness took over.
A concubine did not deserve such a thing. Especially not one so shameful.
“Our first night.” Steve stopped and waited for Tony to pause. “Do you remember it?”
I have already assembled the papers, you only need say yes and we can be happy together. I will never let any harm come to you again. I will ensure it.
“I don’t know.” Tony shrugged but then leered up at him with a new found confidence, and somehow Steve knew Tony would not say more on that.
"It is my job to give them pleasure. It is not their job to give it back."
“It is not alright. Perhaps it will never be alright.”
“Ste-alpha. That’s...you don’t...”
Steve’s whole chest rumbled with pleasure. Tony hummed against him as their kiss grew more heated. Their tongues brushed and curled and licked and sucked. And Steve tasted every part of Tony’s mouth.
He even saw it in the way Tony would look at his bruises when he thought Steve wasn’t looking. When Tony would wince and bite his lip and drop his hand and continue to stare at the injuries as if he could not see beyond them. Like he was beginning to lose himself to other thoughts.
“I am available for your use my lord. I am always available. As was always going to be my fate. You only need to say.”
Steve hummed and blew over his tea gently.
Tony was shaking his head, fingers tightening on the wooden chair. “You know nothing-“
“Please sit.”
“Are you cold?”
Tony’s face darkened and the room grew cold. “Do not keep saying that.”
He regretted it now. Much like he regretted everything with Tony. He suspected he would always regret what he’d done to this omega who had once tried to open up to him, even just a little bit. Who he had essentially spurned and used.
"Other alphas do not let me do this." Tony sighed and buried further into Steve's neck as if to find a space and stay there forever.
Pleased, Steve reached up and stroked a gentle hand over Tony’s hair, and while Tony paused a little at that, he took the opportunity to slip his thumbs into the waistband of the beautiful skirt. Lifting his eyes up, he met Tony’s heated gaze and began to slip it down.
“It is. Alpha.” Tony took two steps forward until his was just mere inches away from Steve’s chest. Steve noted how much shorter the omega was than himself-he could easily cover the omega if he wanted to.
"Why?"
The memory of Tony crying in his bedroom came forth. Like a vicious whip that struck him at his core.
“Stop lying to me!” Steve screamed, suddenly unable to shake the image of Tony looking so defeated in the face of his friend. “You are no concubine! You are my
“I will not. On the condition that you tell me why you are now part of the brothel.”
sorry.”
Stood before him, the confident alpha was an older gentleman with a build that suggested he was used to good solid meals and an easy life. Not too well-built but clearly not thin either. A man of riches, perhaps even a nobleman.
“When we’re bonded, I will ensure you have the best meals. I never want to see you looking so thin again.” Steve said, frowning when he saw the clear skepticism in the Omega’s expression. “I will have extra food made for you and your housemates. You should all eat well regardless of what Obadiah says.”
“My, well-“ Obadiah cleared his throat. “I can’t say I was expecting that. What exactly has made you come to this decision, Lord Rogers?”
Only Steve was sure. Tony was not a concubine. He was
“What are you saying my lord? I am an omega. I do not think of such things.” Tony said with just a slight hitch in his breath. “If I am lucky, one day an alpha will take me in and give me pups. Perhaps they may even come to love me one day and let me raise them. But until then...”
Tony had been coughing a lot recently too, now that Steve thought about it, and it had only been getting worse. If this continued, he would eventually weaken and fall pray to the same illnesses that other omega concubines had faced-the awful, festering illnesses that ticked away as the life of the omega came to an end.
“Yes.” Steve whispered, meeting Tony’s gaze, even when he heard him gasp. “You are mine. If you let me, I will claim you.”
“But I can’t, Steve!” Tony cried out, pulling at his hair angrily and instinctively, Steve reached out and tugged his hands away. To his delight, Tony instantly curled his fingers around his and held on.
The moments drawn out felt like they had lasted for years. But finally when Tony spoke, it was as if the weight of the world lifted from his shoulders.
“One moment.”
His eyes were glued to the omega’s. Bright brown eyes, full of youth and joy looked back at him. Full lashes framed them, making them the center of attention in every way. With them, his full lips curved up into a confident smile that seemed to present a beautiful image.
Determined, Rhodes nodded and began to turn. “Let me grab my things.”
Think about what you’re saying!”
Curious, Tony tilted his head up at him and raised a brow.
Steve bristled at the words. He couldn’t help the wave of anger that washed over him but more than that, the sheer amount of hurt he felt. Did Tony truly hate him that much?
It was as Sam had said. A pregnant omega without an alpha was a death sentence. Without alpha pheromones to ease the months and provide for the growing family, an omega had to make ends meet while finding tasks more difficult. Eventually many would not survive the birth and fade, leaving a parent-less child that would eventually suffer the same fate. It was cruel to do such a thing to an omega.
“Silence!” Steve roared and stood from his perch, making sure to straighten the cuffs of his coat. The men and women continued to eye him with wary looks but he paid them no mind. His eyes were only fixed on the large alpha in front of him, and the man standing behind him.
"I, um...I could use some assistance.” Tony huffed out, startling Steve and to his surprise, he saw Tony struggling to reach behind and tighten the corset he had already somehow managed to change into. Warming at the thought, Steve stood up and stepped behind him and took hold of the strings.
Tony’s body was littered with marks. Bruises of fading colors and the teeth marks that Steve had first seen last week seemed to have taken hold of him in such a way that Steve could picture him being held down. Even with the make up on his skin they were visible and not so easily hidden anymore. In the back of his mind, he wondered just how much they had hurt when they’d first pierced his skin.
That was until Steve opened a narrow wooden door that revealed a cramped room with several lines of clothes and a few wicker baskets with soap covered clothes. By one of these baskets was Tony.
Tony’s eyes popped at the words as the implication sunk in. “You lied to Obie!?”
“Steve.” Tony sighed, pulling his hands away from his waist. In the mirror, he met his eye. “ You can’t save everyone.”
“I have missed you.” Tony choked out, and instantly Rhodes reached out and hugged him again.
“What’s that?” Tony huffed and Steve could barely contain the excitement. There was something wonderful about the thought of surprising Tony.
The shadows had caught his eye when Tony had first walked through the door. And not just the shadows but the slight wince in Tony’s gait, and the odd look on his face when he had moved his neck a certain way.
“Hmmm?”
Tony went still at that. He seemed completely stunned by the words.
“You are so..
“No! Do as you’re told, concubine! You might just learn how a proper omega behaves! Perhaps you would not be a concubine in the first place!”
“Several.” Tony said and finally sighed, the fire leaving his eyes. His shoulders dropped and he withdrew once again, but Steve had seen all he needed to see.
Tony didn’t say anything. He simply continued to cry, the only noise in the room the faint sounds of his sobs and the slight hitches of his breath. If Steve had not been present, he would never have noticed.
“Can I not even-?”
omega Tony. You will be. That means no harm will come to you now. I won’t allow it-“
He didn’t, of course.
No other words were said for some time. It was only in the late hours of the night, that Steve heard quiet words from a small voice.
“I do not care! Will you close your mouth and let me sleep!? I gave you what you wanted and that should be enough! Now leave me in peace!”
“Please don’t say these things.” Tony whispered, looking down with heated cheeks. “It only upsets me. Please don’t lie like that.”
Instead of looking appalled, the alpha merely threw his head back and laughed, the sound booming as it filled the room.
He felt a like a fool. It was a foolish question to ask.
Tony looked at him with eager eyes and followed. And while he moved with grace, there was an element of youth to him. A certain joy on his face that Steve longed to bring closer. He felt a pull to Tony unlike anything he’d felt before. And he had no choice but to act on it.
Steve reached up and rubbed at his eyes tiredly.
“Get up.” Steve said coldly, watching as Tony snapped his head up and looked at him with wide eyes. “You’re embarrassing yourself.”
Steve could hear the stunned silence.
“Tony, oh god, I’m so sorry, I’m
It wasn’t completely incorrect. But Steve couldn’t help but think that some part of Tony liked being with him. Whenever he arrived, he came with a smile and an armful of clothes for their evening events. And in the morning, Tony would always wrap his arms around him and hold on as if afraid to let go.
“I...I used to build things. I used to make a lot of things.” Tony whispered, voice soft but hesitant. Steve snapped his eyes open in seconds, ears sharp and hanging on every word. “It was my favorite thing to do. Once.”
Then he was tilting to one side.
“He would’ve...well. It doesn’t matter. None of it does.” Tony sighed, and instantly Steve knew the moment was over.
“I’m a rather irregular alpha.” Steve said and tried not to grin too hard when Tony started to smile. “I know a lot of things. And Natasha often needs help with these things.”
“Who got run over?” Nat shouted from the stairwell.
Steve pulled back enough to spin Tony, guiding his hands to the cool marble countertop and kicking his legs apart, “Sir, yes sir.”
He bent and kissed Tony, slow and purposeful. The kiss of someone wanting to absorb every sweet moment, of wanting to convey a thousand apologies. He paused before bringing their lips together again, kissing him like a thirsty man tasting his first sip of water, a little wild and sloppy and devouring.
“Patience, love, can’t fuck my face if I’m up here playing tonsil hockey,” Tony chided. The way the curls flopped under their own thick weight made him look soft against the pillow, but against the background of him crawling downwards to Steve’s aching cock-- it was sex hair, and
“It’s fun! And besides, it’s just the Avengers' party. We have to put on the monkey suits for the Stark Industry party, or Pep will have my head.”
Steve’s climax felt like a tug from his sternum to his cock, pleasure sparkling down his nerves before combusting. The heat and pillowy velvet of Tony’s mouth welcoming him down his throat until he was wrung near over-stimulation. Steve let himself thump backwards fully, chest heaving.
A flush of warmth washed over him. This wasn’t the first time Tony asked him to stay after his visitations with Peter, but the warmth happened every time. The alpha side of him basking in the attention of an omega, being allowed to stay near him and their pup for just a little bit longer. After the first meeting, they agreed to visits as often as Steve could make it up from D.C.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” he replied. “Plus you were the one to tell me that virginity is made up Alpha-arcrhal societal nonsense.”
“What’s his name?”
“They died a month before Peter’s first birthday. Howard was drunk, and...and the roads were icy.”
His feet ate up the ground toward the Lincoln Memorial. A bus-full of children were gathering at the memorial, parents hanging back hugging their travel mugs like lifelines. He turned the corner and stuck close to the pool’s low wall. He knew his size and scent as an alpha could be perceived as a threat subconsciously. His body pumped out pheromones in the sweat pouring down his face.
“Yes, and the map of the building.”
"Steve," he corrected, and not for the first time. Steve rubbed the back of his neck nervously, his eyes still on the package. "You really think so?"
Steve ran his hands across all the skin he could find. He snaked his hands up under the jersey and traced the shape of Tony’s chest with the edge of a nail. He dragged it around the border of the bralette as Tony shuddered in place. He cupped the muscle he found and squeezed, worrying Tony’s nipples through the lace while dropping kisses down his neck and exposed shoulder.
“Then what are you going to do about what, Stevie? I had to pop into the kitchen for more mandrake macaroons before Stark showed up.”
Bucky adjusted his sleeves and grabbed Sam’s cuffs, checking them over. “We met him at the suit shop.”
“Okay then, who’s the kid?”
“I can’t wait to get to know you too,” Steve said, dipping in for another kiss. One where he could taste the lingering sweetness of cake and smoke of Tony’s whiskey.
Steve laughed and captured Tony’s lips again. He dragged his fingers through the slick collecting between them and coated his cock. He took his time, rocking forward and back.
“It’s ok. I can fly down if it won’t be too distracting. Set myself up in the hotel for when you’re sweaty and full of adrenaline after practice and need to work out the pre-game frustrations.”
“Enjoy the movie, Buck.”
He spotted Ned and MJ waving their arms next to an ambulance. Peter sat on the floor of the vehicle, skinny legs dangling off the back. Steve let go of the breath he’d been holding, feeling like the first breath he’d taken since Ned’s call once he caught Peter’s eyes as he ran. His form looked small and curved in on itself and covered in a blanket under the strobing lights. The medics parted and he vaguely heard them say he could touch him over the chaos of everyone speaking at once.
Steve finally turned around to face his friends. “It was like looking at my damn elementary class photo, Buck. He has Tony’s eyes, though.”
Steve thought. Even when you’ve earned more than you ever imagined by doing what you loved, it was hard to part with the wisdom learned from the Sarah Rogers and Winifred Barnes School of Life.
“Oh Alpha, you know just what I want to hear,” Tony said jokingly. “So about staying the night…”
Bucky shrugged, “Getting a suit. He and Mark seemed like old friends.”
“I’m pretty sure that if Mark and I hadn’t come back when we did, they would have fucked in the fitting room.” Bucky replied with a smirk and straightened his soon to be husband’s bow tie that didn’t need straightening.
He gave a wet chuckle, “Well, I’m glad I can stop feeling like a monster that terrorized my boyfriend. I really wish I could punch Ty in the face though.”
“Sounds like a date. Now,” Tony dropped a kiss to Steve’s temple before continuing, “not to ruin the mushy mood, but I've got lace working it’s way up my crack, if you could get to peeling me out of this…”
“The previews are terrible anyways, I don’t know why you’re in such a hurry.”
“I really do miss you Tony, I’ve read every article they’ve written about you. I am so proud of how you’ve grown your dad’s company into green tech.”
Tony’s head popped up from underneath Steve’s chin. His hair was mussed and wild, curling a little at the edges. “You are?”
Tony? The Tony that Bucky busts your chops over Tony?”
“Well, I’ll be damned. And he showed up.”
“I love you so much.”
“No, I’ve been single for a while now. Do you live in the city? Maybe we can do dinner?”
Steve whipped around. Tony was leaning against the counter, a handful of books in one hand.
“On is fine. Can I get you some water?”
“Does someone want to tell me why
They’d fallen into a steady routine. Peter stayed after two nights a week for science club and got a ride home from Ned’s parents, and Steve picked them up on Fridays for pizza and games with their other friends. Steve heard the front door open and shut, the shuffle of shoes and a backpack hitting the wood floor and braced himself for the verbal tsunami of post science club gossip and excitement.
"It is, ma'am," Steve responded, catching himself when he started to nod. For a second, there was a stab of fear that this was a bad call to let them know they wouldn't be allowed or able to adopt. It was an irrational thing but he couldn't stop the doubt.
“Yeah, I hit traffic once or twice, but it was fine.” He followed Tony down the entryway until they hit a larger living space. “Shoes on or off?”
Tony hummed and rocked Steve a little as he thought. “His favorite color is red. He likes learning and school. He’s so smart, Steve. And he has a good eye for art, I always say he got it from you. He is obsessed with taking pictures. I actually got him a cheap camera for Christmas last year, he treats it like a thousand dollar DSLR.” A laugh tumbled out of him then, obviously some private inside joke between him and their son.
“Next week. All the clubs are giving demonstrations, we want to have him do three moves by then. But I’m not sure how he is going to be able to dab with only one arm,” Peter said with a very serious look on his face.
Tony shuffled his bare feet a little, tucking his hands in his pockets. “I just thought, maybe we adults should catch up? If you want. Unless,” color flooded his cheeks, “unless I’ve been reading your signals wrong? I mean, I know how you
Steve’s face fell, “I missed you.”
Tony raised his macchiato and took a sip, getting zapped by the raincloud for his efforts. It was
Steve took the lid off the box and started picking through the contents. Letters, photos and battered envelopes formed a timeline of Peter’s early life. There were a few ultrasounds, the bean getting bigger and more baby shaped. One of Peter swaddled and an angry red color on his face, newly born and obviously mad about it. Others of a tiny face peeking out of a snowsuit, of Tony holding him, both bundled up against the New York Winter he was born in. They were a flipbook of time passing, of Peter’s face changing from baby to toddler, all smiles and big brown doe eyes just like his birth parent.
“I love midnight berries!” Steve blurted out. Lowering his volume a little before continuing, “I’d love to join you, Mr. Stark.”
“Captain Rogers just entered the elevator to come collect you.”
“I can’t imagine
“Tony Stark? Ring a bell at all? The man is a tech genius. I thought you were taking me inviting him as your date a little lightly. I can’t believe you didn’t recognize him.” Bucky patted him on the shoulder. At least he looked less nervous about being in front of a crowd when he could focus on teasing Steve.
“I’ve been a little focused on last minute suits and the florist calling every hour about changing the arrangements, I haven’t exactly had a moment to think about you setting me up with a stranger,” Steve groused.
Steve juggled the phone and his keys. “I am just getting to Tony’s, I think I left my duffle here from the last away game.” Fury would be on his ass if he didn't have it for tomorrow. He finally got the lock open and walked through the door, “Besides, why not just get two buckets of popcorn at the start and not have to get up for a refill?”
“Would it be funnier if you got the ‘Naughty list’ one and I got the ‘Nice List’ one?”
of me. That you were scared of what I’d do if you tried to break it off. I couldn’t believe it, I didn’t think I’d ever done anything to make you think that, but…”
. He kissed the divot in Tony’s chest and continued down, tasting the coffee and coconut in the sweat on the skin of his hip.
It was Ned. “Hello?”
Steve wasn’t sure how close to sit or not, hovering a bit before Tony grabbed his hand and pulled. He was close enough to see the golden sparkle in Tony’s eyes. It was just as much torture as it was pleasure, just like the in the days when Tony was just the cute omega that sat in front of him in class.
The presentation was equal parts hilarious and informative, each club member presenting a portion or explaining the math and coding like they were giving a speech to the president instead of their parents a smattering of younger siblings that had tagged along. The bot danced in its own way, wiggling its arm and claw to mimic the students, but also acted up, pinching the hat from Ned’s head and wheeling away to Tony.
“Me too, buddy,” Bucky said. He reached over to grab Steve’s shoulder, giving it a squeeze, “Me too.”
“Black chocolate cake, with a mousse of midnight berries and full moon dust, topped with midnight berry frosting and curled starlight shards.”
“Yes, we grow these in Steve’s potion garden ‘round back. Picked ‘em this morning,” Bucky replied.
His voice cracked, wrent into pieces at seeing his omega who wasn’t his anymore, body flaring in pain. Years worth of aching denial like a hot fireplace poker to his soul. “Yeah.”
The bedroom swept out in front of him as he crested the steps, the door open and lights on and dimmed. The bed dominated the space with a lone bedside table on each side. Happy had come with his luggage and set it closer to the ensuite and closet, but as Tony walked closer, it looked like he had also brought something else. A present, wrapped in silver and white paper and a silver bow, sat squarely on the pillow on his side of the bed with a cream envelope balanced delicately on top.
“Yeah, baby. I’m home.” Steve laid his forehead against Tony’s and breathed deep. This
“But you’re a good man, and you’d rather crawl over the wire so someone else wouldn’t have to.” Tony reached up and wiped a tear from the corner of Steve’s face. It was so different with the beard, more mature, softer, not the same that broke Tony’s heart all those years ago. “I’ve missed you too, Steve.”
Sam gave Steve a firm slap on the back, kicking his lungs back into gear. He coughed and sputtered, sucking in wet gasps of air until Sam handed him a water bottle.
, And several more!
“Steve, yes, we hadn’t gotten to names yet. I hope you don’t mind me giving a little sartorial advice.”
A month of his own hand made the first glide of Tony’s tongue feel magnified, the first moment of wet suction around his cock was like a shock. He made good on his promise and threaded fistfuls of Tony’s hair through his fingers, gripping tight to the root. His husband was a balm on his weary returning soldier’s soul, eyes deep coffee brown in the low light of the bedroom and plush lips stretched obscenely. The sound of him trying to swallow his spit as Steve held him place by the hair was profane music to his ears, each little moan muffled by another thrust orchestrated by Steve’s hips.
Tony pulled on his hair, begging, “Steve, please, come here. I need you. Need your knot.”
Steve’s work bag thumped the floor, followed quickly by his keys into the dish in the entryway. He picked up Peter’s jacket he must have gotten knocked down this morning from the floor, gathered up a few pieces of mail that never made it to the office, and made a few trips to put away the groceries from the car. He hoped he had everything he needed for bringing snacks and brownies down to the school tonight. The end of the year party was due to start in an hour, so he needed to hustle to get house groceries sorted and put away and pack the rest up and beat traffic.
“Dad! Daddy!! We’re home!” Peter yelled as soon as the door was open.
Tony patted his hand, “Thank you. It was okay. Pepper let me sleep on her couch until I could get my own place. We actually got a place together, so she could help me with Peanut. She was in the delivery room with me and called Rhodey and a few others to let them know it went well.”
“No. Never.” Tony’s voice wavered a little, “Ravish at will.”
“Yup. And the other morning, Buck came downstairs in Air Force boxers, grabbed two coffees and the orange juice and went back upstairs. I don’t think he knew I hadn’t left for my drive up here yet.”
“No, but we got to teach one of the bots a new subroutine!”
Tony chuckled a little before closing the distance between them. “Steve. You didn’t know. You said it yourself after looking through what the Army sent back. Someone there didn’t want you to know, and that sucks, they shouldn’t have gotten to make that decision. I mean, I kind of wish I could give them a piece of my mind, my pup didn’t get to know his sire was even alive for his whole life! But I’m not mad at you for that.”
He never could have predicted a year ago that he’d be here, Tony slotting into his and Peter’s life like a puzzle piece that had been lost all these years. Soon, they’d have to get up and shower, be presentable enough for facetime and Peter’s daily recap of the sights of NYC, but for now, he’s content to lay here with Tony in his arms.
Steve scrambled up and put himself at the edge of Tony’s entrance. “Do I need a condom?”
“So you didn’t get any haircuts?”
“I haven’t,” Tony gulped, taking a moment to choose his words. “I haven’t had another alpha since you.”
Tony took his hand and walked them backwards down the dark hall until they got to the guest bedroom. He didn’t bother to turn on the light after he closed the door, letting the city filtering in through the window illuminate them.
“Really? I mean, yeah. I’d like that,” Steve answered. He couldn’t believe Bucky’s approach worked.
He set his husband’s clothes to rights and listened to the soft murmurs and rapidly slowing breaths coming from his mouth before he crawled up and over to settle in. He cuddled Tony close to drop soft kisses on every spare bit of skin he could reach. Tony’s beard was textured but soft, still conditioned and oiled but just so much
The pot of water on the stove hissed and rumbled, finally at a boil. Steve dropped the whole box of pasta in, amazed at how much food teen boys put away. He wasn’t like that when he was that age, was he? Peter certainly has his build, scrawny and tall, but his appetite was bordering on superhuman.
“And what do we have here?” He wouldn’t say he stalked toward Tony, but he could tell by the smug look on Tony’s face that he was looking a little feral around the edges advancing on his boyfriend dressed like one of his biggest fantasies. Barefoot and scantily covered in lace and his jersey.
“No, just take me to bed. Want you in me,” Tony whined.
Had he been breathing? Panting from his run or stolen completely somehow.
“Tests have always been a sticky point for him,” Steve said. He made a mental note to swing by a bookstore for some prep guides.
Steve chopped whatever fruit Sam put in front of him, “No one got run over.”
“Love ya, Petey. Give ‘em hell.”
Tony got up from the table, grabbing his drink and blowing out the candle, “I need to go talk with Uncle Steve. Don’t play with fire without an adult. But! You can still balance the forks on a toothpick on the edge of a glass.”
He looked at the stairs to the bedroom and contemplated sleeping on the couch. Neither his back nor his husband would let him live that down. He shed his shirt as he walked up the stairs. He smelled like ozone and oil, but a shower would have to wait for morning as jet lag quickly demanded sleep.
Steve grabbed the free edge of the blanket and flipped it, crawling under. He attacked swiftly, pressing tickling fingers into Tony’s side and sliding the thin material of his tank top up for more access.
“That one says it lights up.”
Steve let out the breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. “Good. Thank God.”
Their first anniversary was less than twenty-four hours away, and Tony needed to be in the air in two, bound for California and the SI plant that went offline after a minor earthquake tripped all the energy safety switches and finely calibrated housing for the arc reactor powering it. It couldn’t have come at a worse time, anniversary notwithstanding. He was neck deep in suit upgrades, Steve was busy handling Bucky’s de-Winter Soldering. Every phone call made them jump in case it was their social worker. Everyone told them that adopting while superheroing was risky, but Tony wasn’t getting any younger. Growing their family was worth whatever it was going to cost--even retirement.
is ask him out. I know he doesn’t come in here every week for macchiatos and new issues of Herbology Monthly.”
Peter’s messy hair and grinning face came through the arch into the kitchen a moment later. “Smells good.”
“Are Howard and your mom in his life at all?”
“It’s a date.”
“I promise my virginity didn’t grow back, Steve.”
“And miss my hot date? Never. It’s not everyday you meet the physical embodiment of a wet dream walking out of a fitting room.”
Tony?
He sighed. “Tony was at the Lincoln Memorial today.”
Tony snatched the packets out of his hand, “Then why the silence, huh? I know you know my email, my number hasn’t changed all these years.”
“I’d like that, can I have your new number? I recently moved back to New York, we’re starting construction soon, I want to be nearby.”
“It is, but I promise you’re not going to break me. Feel how wet and open you got me?”
“Thank God he at least put on boxers.” Tony looked up, his eyes were bright and twinkled in the city lights from the window. “Wanna see if I can still make you come a second time while you’re knotted?” Tony’s body rocked against his, challenge in his eyes now.
“I wasn’t.  After our last night, I had a low grade fever for a few days, cramps. I thought I had just picked up a bug somewhere, so I just took some Advil and stayed in bed.” Tony paused, his lips forming a thin line as he worked through what to say. “We were all surprised when I missed my next scheduled heat. Then, I couldn’t smell Dad’s cigarette smoke without throwing up when I went home, I couldn’t keep breakfast down. The doctor said it sounded like my body went through an unscheduled heat due to, well, a courting break.”
“His mom, actually.” Steve said. He let out a laugh at the look of pure confusion on Tony’s face before continuing. “We were young, and we were going to put him up for adoption. But that first moment I held him. I couldn’t let him go. She wasn’t ready to be a mom, so I did it on my own.”
“Okay, who died then?” She dropped a book and her phone on the table. Her clean linen beta scent washed over the room to cover his reek of distress.
The barista kept calling names, one of them being Steve’s, and the eavesdroppers kept coming back to the counter for napkins and stirrers and pumps of syrup. Steve was like a stone in a river as they all moved around him waves, everybody watching and waiting to see how this played out.
? God, Steve-ah!” Tony let out a series of breathy noises as Steve scraped his teeth over the swell of Tony’s right side.
“Brooklyn Botanical gardens, 3:00.”
Nights were hard without Tony by his side. Waking up was worse. Steve eyed the empty side of the bed and felt his husband's absence already. It wasn't as bad as when they'd first started seeing one another; that panic-induced loneliness was now just a minor ache that kept him from falling back to sleep.
he comes with a cake that foretells our marriage? You’re one in a billion, Steve.”
Tony made eye contact again and smiled, “Yeah. Bouncing baby boy, six pounds, 2 ounces. They tested him for everything I could remember you saying you’d had growing up. He’s fine, he’s always been perfectly fine.”
“I’m--I’m sorry. I-- How old is he?”
“See you on the plane tomorrow.”
“You deserve so much more. And if you’re willing, I’d like to give it to you.”
“Fine. You look like a thot,” Steve replied, finally touching, placing his hand on Tony’s bare back under the cropped edge and crushing their bodies together. “You look like a little sportsbunny looking to score a nice story for TMZ and I wish I didn’t like it as much as I do.”
“What? No Steve, come’on.”
Steve continued to chop, focused on keeping his fingers out of the way.
Steve thought for a moment, running through his mental list. “How about
Steve followed behind, moving to the counter to get down the blender as Sam gathered the ingredients for their post run recovery smoothie. “No, we don’t need to have an emergency meeting.”
“Tony, I… You didn’t want to break up?”
“I couldn’t leave him. I just moved without thinking,” Peter replied. “I just...I was thinking it’s what Uncle Bucky would have done.”
“Did you enjoy your present?” Tony asked, crawling over Steve’s body, laying on his chest and nestling his head under Steve’s chin.
“Do you?” Natasha asked. She reached out and placed a hand on Steve’s arm.
“She would have. I’m her second son, especially after my Mom passed. She would have done anything.”
Tony got his knees under him and turned. His shove was gentle, to get Steve onto his back, and he had a playful grin on his face. “You wanted my mouth?”
Steve cocked his head questioningly. Usually Tony bid him goodnight once Peter was asleep.
Steve dug out a scrap of paper and a pen, scribbling his number on it before handing it over.
“Students aren’t allowed to wear hats in class, he’s accessing an older subroutine he’s learned,” Tony explained. “DUM-e, good job, but you can return this to Mr. Leeds.”
“I’m glad the kids have someone like you who cares, do you have any of your own?”
“Can I say it when I have my cock there?”
“Get a move on, Rogers. We’re going to miss the previews.” Bucky’s voice crackled in Steve’s ear. You’d think he’d get better reception in Stark Tower with a Starkphone.
“Y-yeah. Fuck, though.” He felt Tony clench around him, “You’re still so snug.”
Steve’s breath left his lungs with a whistle. Bent over the counter island in the kitchen was Tony. Tony-- wearing the blue, white and red of his home jersey, his number 45 big and bold across his back, the fabric cut just below there to show the sleek muscle of Tony’s back before sloping to his rounded ass veiled in white lace. Satiny straps that mimicked a jockstrap around his thighs lifted and accentuated his assets, everything standing out against his tan olive skin.
“Yeah he does, but the attacks are rare. We don’t carry one.” Sam said.
“Feels good, Alpha?”
“You’re beautiful. My body isn’t the same either,” Steve comforted.
Nat, Sam’s Best Lady, popped her head into the doorway, “It’s showtime.”
“Peter.”
Tony popped a final peck to Steve’s reddened lips, “For old time’s sake.”
on the plane because he knows I hate that one, but he’ll be fine. He’d ditch me too if he found Nat all dolled up like this.” He finally closed in on his target. He placed his hands on each side of Tony on the countertop behind him, keeping himself just a breadth apart, and looked down the front of the jersey at the little bit of cleavage Tony achieved with lace and straps.
“He has a camera on his phone. He already sends us lots of pictures of his home, Peanut.”
“Looks complicated.”
Steve stepped out of the elevator a moment later, looking as fresh and as put together as always. He had on one of the navy sweaters that hugged his chest and drove Tony crazy.
Joy erupted through him, quicker and longer than the shock. "That's--that's amazing news, Hanna!”
Tony looked at the scrap in his hands. Instead of Steve’s name, he had scribbled a crude little Captain America shield, just like how he used to sign the notes he’d leave in their apartment. Tony rubbed his thumb across it and smiled.
Peter had failed to mention, all of the hundreds of times he talked about his science teacher, that Mr. Stark was a total smokeshow, as the kids were saying. The last thing Steve expected when he walked through the doors of the classroom was a handsome man about his own age with a finely cut goatee and safety goggles pushing up his ridiculously messy hair. The Mr. Stark in his mind was pushing 65, balding and wore exclusively hideously itchy brown knit sweaters and pants with creases ironed into them.
He lifted the shirt edge, “Is this okay?”
Steve flipped his hand, offering up his palm if Tony wanted to take it. He did. Steve squeezed.
Tony kissed him in apology. Steve felt a sense of rightness float through him as he breathed in their combined scents on their skin. The harsher tones of Steve’s leather were smoothed out by Tony’s rich coffee until they faded into the background. Their secondary scents pushed forward, citrus and coconut both bright and ticklish in his nose.
“Nah, thermodynamics is child’s play,” Tony replied.
He could hear Bucky huffing and puffing under his breath about the absurdity of what Steve just said. “It’s the principle of it, Steven.”
“I do. Maybe at some point, we could make some copies? If that’s ok.” Steve wrung his hands together, “I’m sorry, I never thought any of this would happen. I’m a little bit in shock.”
Steve turned, “I could have gotten it, I’m not--”
“Yeah, bud, go tell her the good news.” He and Tony watched Peter go out into the hallway to make the call before turning back to face each other. “Thank you so much, Mr. Stark. Peter has really bloomed, and I know it was because of you. He talks more about you than any other teacher, this club means so much to him.”
He dropped his things off at Mamma Barnes’, having left enough time for a tongue lashing about his delayed homecoming and to stop for a bouquet before heading to Manhattan to meet Tony. The doorman let him in, and each floor the elevator passed made the weight of anxiety in his stomach grow.
“Almost 9 and a half.”
Tony was going to love this news.
“Like it? Honey, you look like your brain is going to leak out of your ears, and that’s exactly why I wore it. I wanted to give you a little early anniversary present before you’re away this week,” Tony ended his words a little quietly, no longer looking Steve in the eyes and plucking at some lint on his shirt.
“Okay, fine. If Papa wants to, ok? Now go wash up, dinner is ready.” Tony let Peter go before standing up. “Do you wanna stay for dinner, Steve? I’m no cook, but it’s lasagna. Hard to screw up.”
He leaned in, feeling Tony’s smile on his as they connected. It was light and fleeting, like the flutter of wings, but the beautiful beginning of something better. Steve could see gold in Tony’s eyes when they parted, the amber light of the garden casting an enchanting glow over them both.
Tony looked up then, his face cracking into a grin, “Never too young for science.”
Tony huffed down further into the blanket, his response of, “You’re just saying that,” was muted.
“Hey Dad,” Peter walked into the living room, and paused when he saw Tony wasn’t alone.
Tony sighed, “Me too.” His hand hadn’t left the top of Steve’s. “I doubted myself so much leading up to the birth, but she kept me level headed. Together, we got S&P off the ground, with her as CEO since no one would issue a business loan to a disgraced omega with a pup hanging off one hip.”
“Peter.” Bucky said it reverently. It struck Steve that this was big news for Bucky too, being practically brothers, and knowing Tony for years as well. Peter would be like a nephew.
Tony’s face came around the corner to look at them, “There’s my guys. How was the museum?”
“Good. Keep yourself standing and don’t come until I’m done with you.”
They both dissolved into giggles by the end of the story, the vibrations tugged at where their bodies were joined turning their giggles into choked off moans.
Tony let him stay there as his breaths slowed to normal, stroking his hair like a child. When Steve could get his voice under control, he spoke, “Tell me about him.”
doing everything in my power to fix this, not getting a chance to be in his life.”
“Is that ok? You know, with Peter here?”
“Well, I’ll be goddamned. Did you talk to him?” Bucky leaned forward as he asked.
“I’ll never be able to yell at the dawdlers in the hall again, thanks for that,” Tony groaned.
It was why he'd wanted their first wedding anniversary to be special. But business called, and Steve wasn't one to get in the way of Stark Industries. Correction, he wasn't one to get in
He pulled back and checked over his son himself. He was soaked from the sprinklers, shivering underneath his blanket, but in one piece, the vice around Steve’s chest loosened. “I don’t know if I want to wrap you in bubble wrap or ground you for a month. Or both, Jesus-- Pete, what were you thinking? You’re not a superhero.”
He dove back in to the sound of Tony’s whine in his ears, soaking the lace and using it between his tongue and Tony’s hole to drive him crazy. Finally, he inched the fabric down until it snapped under Tony’s ass, scratching it down on the bites he left earlier. The front was still caught on Tony’s cock, so Steve reached up and squeezed lightly. Tony’s legs quivered but held as Steve massaged him through the material and licked him from the back.
He didn't used to get choked up by flowers but Tony certainly knew how to make a guy feel special in a way that Steve hadn't before. Steve smiled and caressed the flower petals with a light touch before opening the letter, the words nestling into his heart. For all the words that Tony was good at blurting out, he knew how to find the ones that mattered when it counted.
Peter let out a petulant whine, “Ugh can you two just go out already? I already owe MJ $20 because I thought you’d crack before spring break.” Apparently nothing got in the way of teenage histrionics.
“Wow. That’s incredible, Tony. I always knew that is what you wanted,” Steve said quietly.
“I wasn’t alone. I had Pep, and the Rhodes. But I’m not going to lie and say I didn’t wish I had you there beside me. Us.”
than Steve normally felt. It could give a man ideas.
“Bots?”
“Thank you,” Tony said as he swiftly grabbed some blueprints to cover up his disastrous attempts, “You’re a lifesaver.”
"That would be great." Steve had a new thought circling his head. He caught Happy ready to leave and waved him back over, moving the phone away from his mouth, "Let me see the gift, Happy?"
“No, you wanted to stand in the kitchen and look like a snack, so this is what you get.” Steve dipped his hand into Tony’s lace, starting up a firmer rhythm, “Make a mess for me, then I want your pretty mouth. Can you do that for me?”
“So, your buddy’s getting married. What about you?”
. This was Steve. Steve who he’s known for so long, who he’s loved for longer.
“Steve...Hi. Wow, you look--good.”
He wasn’t hard to track down. Tony was surrounded by Sam’s nephews and Clint’s kids and looked to be demonstrating some sort of trick using silverware, toothpicks and a candle. Steve watched as the contraption above the flame started to move and the kids created chaos in their little corner with their excited screaming.
“Do you have your class schedule printed out?”
Tony trembled on closer to orgasm, Steve steadied his rhythm to carry him over until he gasped, something Steve had ached a month for. Tony tangled his hands with Steve’s own, gripping and releasing in time with thrusts down Steve’s throat. The sharp press of his ring against Steve’s fingers was a bright point of focus breaking through the cloud of pleasure from rubbing against the bed in his own pants.
“No.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t-”
Tony mustered the straightest face he could before breaking into a fit of laughter. Steve
A picture of the two of them in Tony's workshop, home like they belonged, together.
Steve joined him in line waiting for drinks, “God, it’s been years. I--”
Sam took Bucky’s hand and helped him finish doing up his cuff links. “Now can we roll back to the part where you know Tony Stark and I'm just now finding out?”
Steve set two glasses of water down and joined his son at the table, “It’s not very nice to call anyone a dummy, Peter.” “It’s his name,” Peter explained, “D-U-M-Dash-E. You can meet him at Parent Night.”
ugly. But I just can’t. We’re going to be photographed in these.”
“Fuck. I’m so sorry, Tony. You went through so much.” Steve swore under his breath, “It’s killing me that you faced all of this alone.”
“Wait wait wait. Ty? Stone? Colossal asshole and who stalked me? That Ty?”
The man reached his hand out to Bucky, “Hi, I’m Tony. You must be the groom?”
“Lead the way,” Steve replied.
Mark grabbed a few shirts in a variety of pastel shades and handed them to Steve, “Go. Try these on.” He turned to escort Tony to the front, “Your suit is ready at the desk. I threw in a matching pocket square, I know how Pepper likes you to look put together.”
“And, um, they were ok? With you keeping him?”
Bucky was already mixing Tony’s usual drink; a large macchiato with infusions of honeysuckle and phoenix breath, topped with a hand-whipped storm cloud. Steve thought it was ridiculous, but Tony insisted the lightning kept it the perfect drinking temperature, and found the tiny rumbles charming as he wandered the stacks.
Peter shuffled his feet and looked down, obviously a little embarrassed by being praised, “Yeah, Thank you, Mr. Stark.”
They walked over to an empty table to claim it as theirs for the evening, picking one close enough to Sam and Bucky’s family table where Mama Barnes and Sam’s sister Sarah were already seated. He didn’t miss the looks on their faces as they watched him lead his date around the atrium. The family group chat was going to be unbearable tomorrow, he could feel it already.
“Well, Uncle Bucky is going to tan your hide when he hears this. When he goes into a rescue, he’s got fifty pounds of gear on and years of training.”
But why not give Tony a portrait of their future family? He had enough time to make a smooth addition to the picture.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, drawing their bodies together and deepening the kiss. His nose was full of Tony’s scent, full of the way it thickened like syrup. It was the same as it was ten years ago. Steve’s own scent flooded the air to match, and he could hear Tony’s soft whimper as he caught it and his body softened in response.
He slowed his pace, stopping and scanning the gathered adults and
Tony’s mouth made a noise of agreement and pleasure as he sealed it around Steve’s length, licking up the mess dripping from the tip. His tongue flickered against the shaft, under the crown and over all of Steve’s sensitive places until Steve’s mind started to haze. Tony was teasing, but also jacking him tightly, catching him between the edge of too much and not enough before sucking harder, taking him deeper.
The anxiety came right back and doubled. "Hello, ma'am."
“Honestly, I think you look adorable. Look at all this fluff?” He ran his hand through the strands sticking out of the blanket, “You’ve got amazing curls.”
“Of course, that is amazing, isn’t it Pete?” Steve clapped his son on the shoulder.
“I just don’t understand the point of an ugly Christmas sweater party. We used to wear our nice clothes for holiday parties.”
It would be presumptuous even with the news. A possible jinx to it.
Tony turned around to lean both elbows against the counter. The jersey’s cropped edge pulled against his chest as he reclined, stretching around his pecs and showing the barest hint of more white lace underneath and his tanned bare belly. The neckline fell toward one shoulder and revealed a lacy strap Steve wanted to break with his teeth. The front of the panties outlined his cock, already hard and threatening to pop past the elastic around the waistband.
“Well, I’m not in heat, but we all know how well that went last time. I don’t have any, or if I do they are sorely expired.”
“Boy next door my ass,” Tony griped. Steve retaliated by snapping one of the jockstraps again. “Literally.”
“When we got outside, we didn’t see him. He heard a lot of loud bangs, Mr. Stark had some sodium out on his table, something must have set off the sprinklers and the water would have--.” Ned paused. “Peter went back in for him.”
His staring must have finally alerted another parent, a woman eyeing him warily while tugging on Tony’s sleeve until he turned around. His eyes were just as expressive and wide as they were ten years ago, piercing the cold morning air straight to Steve’s own.
He loved the way Tony got for him, all soft and needy and
“Me?” Steve didn’t squeak, but maybe in this instance, staring at the wizard that topped every single free-pass list in the magical realm, it could be said that Steve’s voice was a little high as he answered.
“It’s just me, and I can take off early for a meeting whenever you need.”
“Sounds perfect. I am not against a future sibling for Petey, but absolutely not right now.” He looked down at himself and poked his belly, “You hear that? No Shenanigans this time.”
Steve nodded and swallowed the lump in his throat. “A son. I never thought that’d ever happen.” He paused for a moment, everything settling over him like a blanket. “I wish Ma was here.”
“Shh shh, honey,” Steve said. “If I make it out of the sandbox, and you aren’t with someone, all bonded and happy. But please, don’t wait for me. It’d…” his own voice was starting to crack, “it’d kill me to know you wasted years waiting on me. Okay?”
Steve reached for his phone, “Of course, give me your number, I’ll wait til later, when you’re home.”
Steve slumped onto a stool. “Fuck.”
“Gonna come baby?” Tony’s cock twitching in his palm was all the answer he needed. “Did you bring lube with you?”
Steve handed over the bouquet he brought and Tony cut the ends. He dropped the stems into a simple glass vase.
Steve had started a list of questions to ask. What was Peter’s birthday? His favorite flavor of ice cream? Was he doing well in school? Did he inherit any of Steve’s sickness that kept him skinny until the alpha hormones kicked in?
“Maybe we can find a matching pair? Then it won’t seem so bad.”
Happy grinned at Steve as he took the letter and present from the blond. "He's going to love them, Captain Rogers."
“I’m sure he took that well,” Steve deadpanned.
“Wonderful. I’ll take a slice.” Tony straightened up from the case, “And two forks? If you’d like to join me, Steve? If you like midnight berries, that is.”
“Wait.
Sam went first into the house, dropping his keys and wallet in the dish by the door before heading to the kitchen. “Bucky! Nat! Emergency roommate meeting!”
Tony peeled the blanket back enough to glare at Steve. “Pepper gave me the month off of meetings so I could work on all the new launches and equipment upgrades since I’d be essentially watching the clock until you got home.”
“That’s a damn shame.”
Finally, he was at Tony’s door. His apartment was one of two on this floor, quiet and well protected for an unmated omega and his pup to live alone. Steve noted all the security cameras as well and the itch to protect what was his, or what his alpha hindbrain thought was his, abated.
“This is our only day of downtime before getting on the plane for Tampa. I want to spend it eating my weight in popcorn, and if we plan it right, I can get a refill before the movie actually starts.”
Steve sat up and rubbed the drying tears and snot off his face with the palm of his hand, “What happened?”
combined with his smirk before popping the button and fly of Steve’s ruined jeans.
Steve adjusted the knot on his tie and gave himself one last look at the pink and gray suit before pushing through the fitting room curtain. “Well, Buck, is this gay enough?”
Not wanting to dawdle in the solitude, Steve got out of bed and started his routine for the morning; shower, warm-up, out for a run. He thought about the news he couldn't wait to talk about once he gets a call from Tony. It's why coming home to find Tony's surprise to him brought with it a pleasant joy.
The other man brightened, “Only if you call me Tony.”
“But I--”
“Breath, Steve,” Tony said.
, inventor of the vibranium transmutation spell, and Witchy World’s Most Winsome Wizard three years running. Not that Steve kept every copy of those issues of that gossip rag for any particular reason. Tony was also, for some unknown reason, a weekly regular at the shop.
