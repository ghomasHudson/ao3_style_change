She turns to him. Her eyes are harder than he thinks they should be. “Tony’s always been overworked and overextended. I appreciate that you’ve spent time thinking beyond your most basic contract.”
“It’s holographic, but the lush greenery is not. So, what do you think? Should we go?” A shift of expression crosses Tony’s gaze – hopeful and pained at the same time. It’s that haunted look that Steve first noticed when he met the prince.
Tony shakes his head. “I forgot the glasses.”
Reaching across the expansion between their chairs again, Tony grasps his hand and tangles his fingers with Steve’s. “Let me come with you.”
“Yeah, sorry about that,” Steve said. “We figured it out. Natasha is surprisingly good at – what they call profiling? And she put the pieces together. So I flew out to New York and had a sit down with Bruce at the SHIELD base there. He checked me over. We had lunch. It was nice.” Steve seemed so blasé about it like soul packs were every day occurrences. Not something special and coveted.
Steve grins. “Tell me about it. I once forced Dum Dum to dance the polka with me in the middle of camp. We were out of rations and we only trapped a single skinny hare. I was about starved to death.”
Loki spins around, his cloak whipping the air with the movement. He looks away, beyond the newly constructed maze toward the cliff. “Find your way through the maze, Captain. Find the way through the maze and maybe, just maybe, my maker won’t suffer the fate he deserves.” He glances over his shoulder at Steve – but he’s no longer the god of mischief. His robotic features dance over the remnants of Loki’s flesh. “Good luck, Captain. I’ll see you on the other side.” Loki/Utron disappears in a scattering of green light reminiscent of fireflies.
He gets a new applicator. Crouching, he presses the button on the applicator, the gel oozes out and he slides the applicator into his entrance. It only stings for a second and then he adjusts. Steve presses the button to deliver the nanites and then waits for a second before he removes the applicator. Standing, he doesn’t notice anything different except for a minor pressure. It’s very comfortable, so much more than the plug that constantly reminds Steve of the stretch and pull – sitting always caused problems too. He washes his hands, then pulls on his robe and goes out to the chair, sitting down. Very comfortable. Nearly no pressure at all.
“Tony Stark, you’ve heard of him,” Steve says and tries not to meet Sam’s eyes. If he does, he might give himself away.
Steve doubts anything in the Hub will nourish the serum. It’s like being in the Fey realm – food is only a mirage. “Let’s go.” He’ll play along for now. Getting the lay of the land is his plan right now. He doesn’t have time, though. The worm works its wonders and who knows what damage it might do to his head if he’s not rid of Ultron by the time it’s done.
“No one would blame you,” Tony said. His voice sounded small and very far away.
Tony shifts his glance to Vision who only stands silently at Steve’s side. How is it that his creation ended up in Steve’s hands. He frowns, he left the Avengers he needs to get used to it.
“I get that. The monitors read normal sleep patterns, but his brain is acting like he’s in a coma,” Bruce says. “They would like to do a PET scan of his brain. See if there’s something there.”
He thinks that Tony’s deluding himself more than Steve had been when he was omitted the truth about Tony’s parents and Bucky. “Maybe.”
Tony hoots and claps his hands. “All this time, they were just that close. You are a sneaky bastard.”
"Why's he like that?" He knows it's rude to ask. His mother would have pinched up her lips and shaken her head. It's just not done – no one ever remarks about a Companion if they are not paired. When he looks at the boy and then back at the older boy’s Soul Companion he doesn't see derision in the boy's features just a little curiosity and maybe amusement.
Steve hisses as the wind shocks and the snow flies around them. “I don’t trust him. We might be walking into a trap or we might be walking away from a town about to be hit.”
“In due course, Captain, you will find your way through the maze.”
“They liked him then! Right?” Tony said with bated excitement. Surely the people would know what a hero dear old Blu the lion was then.
“Wow, way to relax,” Tony says and nearly drops the wine glass he’s holding.
“Don’t worry. He knows it’s a fake date,” Tony says. While Steve didn’t seem eager to play the part of his date at first, he conceded to it. Over the last few days, Tony hadn’t noticed any big changes in Steve, a few more questions about Tony’s general interests and his life. While they were working on the upgrade codes late into the night, Steve struck a line of questioning that struck Tony as both insightful and earnest in his interest.
“Yes and the rules are that an alpha should be able to bring his omega warrior into theater. A warrior is the best defense, the best protection,” Steve said.
Steve only shrugged at Tony’s question. He wasn’t about to reveal that he’d spent the last few years having distressingly realistic dreams about Tony, and that they were not of a Puritan variety.
He huffs and shakes his head. “You know what, forget it. Just don’t send anymore paintings.”
“Don’t worry. He’s downstairs making more food for the super soldier.” Natasha went around Tony and entered the suite. She glanced around the clean lines of the design – it was all white cushions and tinted windows to the wooded areas outside. The pendulum lights hung in a cluster in the middle of the room like chrome pipes from an old 50s Chevy. “Strange, but not entirely horrible.” She brought the tray over to Steve.  As she set it up she ordered, “Start eating.”
“What the fuck?” Tony quakes as he watches; he feels like a voyeur, that he shouldn’t be able to witness what he’s seeing.
She knocked his arm. “That’s not what I meant, Stark.” She mumbled something in Russian. “You’re blue because you’re getting hungry, too hungry. Get some blood out of the fridge.”
“Get a room,” Natasha said. “And I’m not joking. Upstairs, boys. Now, before he keels over.” Natasha sipped the cold pig’s blood and grimaced at the taste. She set it aside. “Foul.” As Tony and Steve watched her, she shooed them upstairs. “Go, go. Before we have to let him take a good quarter of your blood.”
Tony’s shoulders slump and he looks at him with regret. Steve reaches out and places hands on each of his shoulders. “I’ll be here when you return.”
“Hey, you get to take your time. Just like me.” Tony reached out and touched Steve’s hand. “Come. The river walk I heard is fantastic.”
The day he walked through the stockade onto the premises of the prison, he often marked as the day he understood the reality of Hell. Seeing men like walking skeletons stare at him with vacant eyes, eyes that did not warn or threaten, only wished for death. He fought to escape in the earliest months of his imprisonment. He tried to break free through the Dead line, the fence to ward prisoners away from the stockade wall. Most prisoners suffered a death shot and were mercifully free of the prison at Camp Sumter. He didn’t get a killing shot, but worse, far worse.
“Sir, I believe we were making plans to rescue the elusive and non-existent Captain Steven Rogers. Who cannot be related to Captain America, also known as Steven Grant Rogers since he did not leave any known heirs.”
Tony doesn’t answer right away. The crescent moon illuminates his face. The dry tears glimmer like streaks of moonlight gracing his cheeks. Steve can’t help but want to touch them, and then he finds he is, wiping away the tears. “Stay.”
“There’s some. We detected a spike about three hours ago. One of the doctors thought it might be a dream like state, but then it disappeared again.”
“Not now,” Tony says. “I’ll deal with it. I’ll figure it out.” He means it, too. He’ll call Happy and Pepper and get the whole gang over here to move them out of this crappy building. He call in all the security guards. No one is touching Steve Rogers. Ever again.
“When I walk into the room, you are to get on your knees. This isn’t the first time I told you -.” He’s brimming with anger, trying to keep it hinged and controlled.
Tony ignores the first and focuses entirely on the last part of that sentence. “Your observation skills suck for someone with 20:20 vision.”
Steve narrows his eyes at Tony but says nothing about it in return. He pulls Tony back into the small, wooded area as if it will lend cover to prying artificial intelligence. “I think we stick with the plan. We can’t get out of here, we have to get to the inner Hub to exit.”
Those words so fatalistic in their delivery made a direct hit to Steve’s heart. “Yes, I want you around.” Steve’s shoulders slumped. “I haven’t been fair to you Tony. I am sorry about that. It wasn’t you.” His voice faded, cracking. He bowed his head. They were almost there – so close to the edge of the border to the land of light and recovery.
“I’m about to go through presentation and I need an alpha.” He’d said it like that – how else should he have done it? He put his cards on the table.
Returning to Tony, he closes the small door but cannot manage to lock it. His fingers are not willing to work like that anymore. With a shoulder to Tony’s chest, Steve hoists him up and wobbles as he straightens. Getting to the horse is a feat, but he does get him in the saddle.
Late one night, Steve climbed up to the loft room in the barn to find that Tony had all the vests spread out on the floor. He had a connection to JARVIS through his phone. “Can you adjust the interface?” Steve cocked a brow at Tony, trying to quietly ask him what he was doing. He only raised a finger and then said to JARVIS. “If you adjust it to give a little jolt, a shock, that would surprise the participant-.”
The lion relaxes his shoulders. And purrs.
The prince lays his head back on the cushions and Steve runs his hands up his thighs sensing the tension strung high throughout his body. A tender caress and he unrolls the condom onto his erection and then Steve holds the prince’s cock to lightly lick at the head, paying special attention to the slit. The prince shivers slightly as if he always holds back, as if he can never relax. If Steve can make the prince release a minimum of his stress, release the tension held in his muscles, then he’ll call it a win. He laves at the cock ignoring the fake black cherry taste and falls into deeply inhaling the musky scent of the prince. He curls his tongue around the heavy erection, using the tip of his tongue to glide and slide almost tickling in its manner. Then he slips his hand toward the prince’s balls, lightly stroking them and bringing them close enough to kiss and inhale.
As the hours, as the days wear on he finds himself on the canopy rack over the bed. He’s in presentation position, with his face in the pillows, his knees on the mattress and his ass in the air, but his arms are tied up to the rack above the bed. It puts a unique stress on his shoulders and the alpha rocks into him. He’s thick with the knot and Steve rides it well.
“No, no you don’t,” Steve said. “But you still feel guilty.”
Steve frowned but went back to the phone’s display, reading it aloud. “Most soul packs have specific characters or roles. Leader, sentinel, friend, confidant, guide, lover (beloved). Soul packs are ever evolving and could take up to five years to form.” He inhaled, held it to steady his nerves, and then exhaled. “Five years.” He continued to read.
“Do you want some?” Natasha appears at his shoulder and he jumps in response.
“I’m not so sure.”
This isn’t how it is supposed to be. He knows this – he intended for what he did to end things, but not like this. He would cut out his gland and free Tony. Simple, easy. He would free himself of the need to remember, of the curse of knowing what it felt like to be bonded, to want and to hold, and to fly into a warrior’s rage because of harm to his alpha. All of that would be a distant dreamlike thing to him. This didn’t happen when they took it, when the scientists experimented on him. He was fine. Why is it happening now?
“Oh Steve.” That’s Bucky in the background again – but this time it’s not mockery, it’s genuine concern.
CHAPTER 2
“How long?”
He denied the truth for a while. How could he come to accept that Captain America had been a prostitute in New York City and that he'd died in a suspicious fire.  Eventually he needed to accept the facts but it still felt like ice in his belly. He tried to thaw it out. He fucked his way through Times Square and then in the mile high club and again all around Malibu. He vowed never to go back to New York. It hurt too much to think about Steve. How everything ended and left him with a pit of cold despair inside of him so that he would never feel again.
Steve beams. This is exactly what Tony needs. “No sucking up, no special treatment, just privacy on all fronts.”
He clutches onto Steve’s arm and, in the barest whisper, says, “Bruss.”
“I thought I already was assigned for the week.”
Tony backs off and shoves his hands in his pockets. “Two huh? Over achiever. Ma always said it took forever to potty train me. Too busy doing other things to stop to take a leak.”
get away.” He placed his hand on his chest. “When she had this gorgeous hunk of sweet chocolate? Ah, she was the one who let me get away.”
He places a mug of coffee in front of Steve. “I take it that it’s been a while since you had any coffee.” Tony has no idea what they fed Steve in the hospital. During the flight Steve spent most of his time sleeping. Tony suspects it was a defense mechanism. “Listen, JARVIS, the robot in the ceiling – well not really – but you can think of him that way will help you out. Think of him as a butler. He’ll show you were your room is and I’ll have him order some clothes for you. Don’t worry about it. Just-.” Tony stops. Here’s where he has no clue what to say or do with a person turned lion turned person again. “Just take it easy.” He picks up his mug of coffee and starts toward his workshop – it’s been ages. He needs to escape. He can grill Steve when it’s more appropriate and his own head isn’t pounding.
“No,” Strange says and Tony can almost hear the bemused smile. “It’s not. But I can tell you that it would be a shame if Tony Stark thinks that the glasses and the implant are his 1 in 14,000,000 chance. I know you, Stark, you’re here to save the world. You’re not going to let a little thing like visual impairment stop you.”
“No, sorry,” the voice murmurs and something it pressed between his lips. It’s a straw and he sips.
He only managed to grumble in reply. Bruce was just Bruce but he seemed magnified, larger, more than himself. The loudness of his presence deafened Tony and he cringed in response to Bruce’s questions. He couldn’t answer them, the din around him, in him, muted any response.  Bruce caught hold of his shirt and dragged him along to meet Natasha and her crew.
“Drink this, come on Steve, drink it.” She forces the tube through Steve’s clenched teeth. He fights her in some hazy nightmare, but then as the liquid hits his tongue, he becomes surprisingly compliant. He falls limp in her arms again and rolls his head, opening his eyes.
The flush heated his face. “Before we were technically bonded. In the shower.”
She smiled at him. “He didn’t want me to tell you. But I think it’s important.”
“Steve, stop.” Tony’s voice cuts the air. Sharp and brutal. “I know about the seizures. I know about the memories of another Steve, another Tony. I know about the reality with the Ornari. I know it all.”
“But you can’t trust me,” Steve says. “I can’t tell you or give up Bucky to you. That means I’m a fugitive. I’m not signing the Accords, not when Bucky would be thrown in prison. I know you can’t forgive him, but you said you understand now that he was a victim.”
“That’s just it. Since we went on that ride and he nearly slipped off the dock, he’s not stopped,” Steve says. It hasn’t been that long, perhaps Steve is over reacting.
“Would you like to hear more about lacrosse, Mer Rogers?”
Tony reviews the armor, all the pieces and realizes this is his chance. It might be his only chance once Raza comes back. It is also Steve's only chance. They haven't practiced anything, they don't have a synchronized plan, but they have to improvise with what they have. Tony steps into the armor and Steve starts to bolt it into place, following Tony's instructions and the blue prints laid out on the workbench.
“So, considering the prince’s current state and my profession that includes de-stressing people, do you think I would be under the definition of a temporary assistant to the prince?” Steve waits. He hopes he didn’t happen to befuddle the AI too much.
“Yes, sir.”
So clearly Steve.
Following his instincts and his memories of the dream place, Steve teased Tony’s entrance only to have him tremble. Steve swallowed one more time before he opened his mouth and let Tony’s cock drop from his lips. Tony huffed and cried out, but he allowed Steve to flip him over and hoist him up onto his knees. In that position, Steve spread Tony’s ass with his hands and then lapped at his entrance, letting his tongue find its way into Tony.
“And what’s he into this time?” Steve asks, considering Tony, how he moves and observes. It isn’t a casual kind of observation. Steve’s seen the type of training, the careful calculating eye.  He’s seen it in war and prison.
“The synchronicity of astral energies through the various dimensions of the multi-verse. Captain Rogers and Doctor Banner were synchronized and thus bonded.”
Tony shudders under his care but looks up at him, his eyes dark and luminous. “What about you?”
“You can’t mean that, you can’t,” Tony says but he doesn’t tug away.
She folded her hands into the opposite sleeves of her robe. "Yes the great Service Order of the Jedi has been besmirched by the evil doings of the dead Emperor. I cannot have what's left of us be turned."  She stood looking out upon the twisted branches to the far below shipyard and dock.
The beast speaks.
“Oh, Captain Steve Rogers, I’m with the 107th out of Iraq. My unit, the Howling Commandos were called in to try and take this camp.” The words come to his mouth without thought, Fury must supply them because Steve is desperately taking notes on his own ‘life’ here on Earth. The first few weeks of being assigned to someone on Earth are always the hardest, the facts come in quick and the information dump is always a tad disarming.
In the dim light, Tony caught Steve’s smile. “Yeah, it is.”
“Yeah, well what about that girl you want to marry. You know, Dot.” Steve had asked and it was cold and he shivered in his too thin coat. Bucky only rolled his eyes and pulled off his own scarf to wrap it around Steve.
At that they adjourn with plans to go over specifics during the evening session after the formal dinner. They only have a few days to put together the details of their strategy but Tony believes they are off to a great start.
“Can you two leave us for a minute?” Natasha asks. Both Sam and Cho share looks and then silently decide to follow her request.
Slipping off the couch and quietly approach the prince, Steve gets within a meter of him and then kneels, shuffling closer while bringing the little packets of condoms out. “I have chocolate, strawberry, and my very favorite black cherry.”
“JARVIS, find me someplace between here and Malibu that is secluded, secure, and where I can buy the locals’ trust and loyalty.”
The media talk about it for days and Pepper is elated about the positive press.  The Board of Director’s meeting that followed had been a buzz with the news and remained upbeat about the direction of the company even with Tony’s recent absence. They saw the marriage as  sign of Tony’s new stability.
Tony snickers and slaps Steve on the back. He points to the microwave. “We’ll bring the popcorn. Get dressed and I’ll meet you in the living room in 15 minutes.”  He doesn’t give Steve long to get ready because the thought of him changing his mind tightens Tony’s chest, and causes his palms to get sweaty. Unfortunately, that also means Tony’s left with only a short time to get beautiful.
Tony stood, stunned and speechless. What the hell was going on? Belligerent. That was the only word Tony could use to describe Steve. He’d visited with Steve only a few hours ago in the dreamscape and that Steve was sorrowful, mourning, lost. “Is this some kind of test?”
The power of it ripped him apart. His sinews and muscles stretched and quaked through the stress. His brain begged for mercy as the new energy within him regenerated him, rebirthed him. He became something new, something horrible and bright. Something beautiful and something deadly. The surge of power lifted him. Tony opened his eyes and the people in the cell around him backed away. He stood – no, he floated a few feet above them. A hot and terrible fire blazed in his chest as he focused on his tormentors. With little knowledge of what happened to his body, Tony raised his hands when the V-Corps agents pointed their guns at him. While the bullets couldn’t kill him, they could do significant harm.
“Omegas have feelings, too.” Or that’s what he’s heard. The only time he ever really interacts with omegas has been during an urgency cycle. The mating blocks have scores of the drones. Doesn’t matter, they sell themselves either way. The only good omega is a warrior omega.
A shuffling of shoes on the floor and then Pepper is touching his hand as Strange moves away. “Steve’s not here right now. Maybe it would be best if we took this up in the morning. You haven’t eaten and you need to rest.”
“I worry for the future of the human race,” Strange says and then leaves the apartment. Wong grunts and follows him with Steve trailing after them. He feels a little like a lost duckling.
Coulson peers behind him at the door that has no lock at all. “I’m sorry, who are you again?”
She rolled her eyes. “I thought you left.”
A growl stops him. Turning, Tony discovers Blu has returned – and he’s not alone. He’s brought what looks like a dead animal – some kind of deer. He drops it on the ground and makes a small noise that sounds suspiciously like a purr.
“It’ll be fine.”
“Whose side are you on?” Sometimes, Natasha is like a blur – vague and pixelated against the background. He can never quite pin her down.
A burst of the dashboard, and then air bags deploy.  His first thoughts as the delivery truck collides with the panel of the passenger’s side of the vehicle revolve around Steve – protecting him and ensuring his safety. He can’t do anything, though as the SUV skids across the road, slightly tipping from the high center of gravity.  Lights and sounds turn into a monstrous invasion on his ability to formulate any coherent thought. Something splatters against his cheek and he struggles to push the air bag away to find out what is happening.
“Clint. Ultron. Whomever.”
“It sleeps sometimes after the scrub down and shave. Kind of stresses it out.” Rumlow stood next to Tony. His arms crossed over his chest, the weapon secured to his back and a grin on his face that spoke of pride and arrogance. “It’s in good health. We haven’t had to do level 3 punishment in a few weeks, though we keep up with the daily punishment as instructed.”
Steve muttered the Mantra as he went to the garage and got his bike. It would be at least a three hour drive. That meant that there was no way for Steve to make it there, deal with Bucky, and then back again before Tony woke up and noticed Steve was gone. One way or another Steve would end up paying for leaving the Tower and not telling Tony. He hopped on the bike after donning his Captain America helmet to stop the police for pulling him over. He didn’t start up the bike right away as he mulled over the right decision.
Staring into the flames as the smoke settled and the fire blazed, Steve said, “Well, he and Wong were guiding our pack. I needed to know as much as possible about them.” He liked to do his homework, know the lay of the land, understand the strengths and weaknesses of every situation.
With something to do, Pepper managed to pull herself together and went to work at the nearest computer terminal. Sawyer gave his passcode to her and she instantly flew over the keyboard, accessing different drives and evaluating what she needed to pull all the needed data off of the older computers.
Getting his dick fried apparently really pisses off the bastard.  He's got an assault rifle (which if Tony had seen it, he would have taken it). Rumlow limps onto the main factory floor and, with a hollering scream, sprays the area with bullets. He's no aiming at anything, the rage must be blinding. And the pain, Tony thinks.
“What you felt is the gravity flux here. The boots are compensating for you, so you don’t go floating into the game.” Tony touches the window, and it glitters. “Not a real window or barrier.”
One Friday night when the university planned a three-day weekend for Homecoming or some idiotic reason, Tony had goaded Rhodey to go to one of the illegal Blood Dens out in Vampire Row. Rhodey, always the straight-laced guy, shook his head and refused. At the time Tony was all of fifteen and getting into a Blood Den was hard enough. Being underage made it impossible. “Come on, Rhodey. You’re a killjoy, you know that? I think I might go insane this weekend and you’re sucking all the fun out of it already.”
“What is fealty without some measure of love?” Tony says and puts the glasses away. “It doesn’t matter now. I screwed up, like I always do when it comes to these things. Maybe I don’t deserve the chair.”
“What?” He turns to face her one last time before he presents at the mating blocks.
“Anything?” Blu purrs and rubs up against him as if he’s a house cat marking his human, only this time Tony falls flat on his ass.  He’d almost forgotten about his injuries. “Whoa there, big guy. Careful with the merchandise.” He pets Blu along the ridge of his ear and get a long low clucking noise in response. “I suppose you like that.”
Ultron always had a Pinocchio complex. When he designed and created Vision, his ultimate goal had been to occupy the mind of the Vision. Ultron lost that battle. Now, he’s inside of Steve, eating away at his consciousness, trapping him in some strange delusional reality.
“I will. Just relax. Just for a moment.” Steve guides him down to the grass.
“They moved him to a private room. Sewed up some of the worst of it,” Natasha reported. Her voice sounded tired, older than it should. He should give her leeway; he literally could feel the throb of exhaustion in the soul bonds. Yet at the same time he read relief through the bond. The worst of the worry for Steve was over. “Took out the bullet in his leg. The one in his abdomen was straight through. They did nothing but put some compression pads on that one. The serum is taking care of it. Sam and Bruce are in there now.” She pointed to the room.
“Stay down, Nat,” Steve said as he got to his feet. “Clint are you near Nat?”
Once home, Steve pretended not to worry about it, not to feel the constant twitch on his arm. The nurses and doctors might have confirmed that he was metaphysically connected to Bruce, but that told him nothing. They had tests – that’s what Fury had said. But it made no sense. If they had scientific tests to show that the soul linkage was there, didn’t that make it a part of nature and not magic. And the idea of SHIELD with all of their power knowing how to identify packs and mates brought with it an undercurrent of deceit. It hurt his head even to think about it. He made himself some coffee and sat in the darkening room with the files of his friends still on the side table. He should put everything away. Pack it all away and forget about the past. Because he’d been damned to the future.
“Oh, sorry. Forgot. Don’t know why JARVIS only had partial information,” Tony says and frowns. They had been looking in the wrong area, apparently, thus the reason no rescue mission found them until Tony had been able to fix the communications link in the HUD. “Well anyhow, it’s good to be home.” He owes her an explanation and he starts to formulate one but she holds up her finger to stop him.
“Give me a break. I am not suicidal,” Steve retorts and the numbness he felt before all but fades away. He’s vibrating with energy, with raw emotion that he’s bottled up for months since the last time he saw Tony, really saw him.
His body violently convulsed and he screamed through it. No sound escaped him. He juddered and arched. The scientists scattered as he rolled and pitched about the room. His body wasn’t his own, some supernatural force possessed it – the thing that made him a vampire in the first place. It seeded deep within his chest. It pulsed into the hollow of his ribcage and grasped what was left of his stone heart, worming its way into his core. He tore at his own chest, clawing at it as the agents whipped out their guns.
When they get to the lifts, the guards split but six of them enter the lift with Tony and Steve. A slight slip of the hand on Steve’s back by the prince quiets his nerves. This is something he’s never experienced. Life on Brooklyn had been simple, harsh and hard, but simple. Here at the Widow’s Brothel, it has been purposeful with risk, but never this dangerous. Steve always feels safe with his clients. Natasha is that good screening who is allowed to use her Brothel. There’s a reason her brothel is considered one of the top ones on the Station.
“Continue,” she repeats.
“Night time ambush,” Tony muttered.
“Well, you seemed to enjoy all of the activities,” Ross countered. “Perhaps it got you off?”
Once there he stares at himself in the mirror again, still stunned that this is his life. Dreaming of being an artist got him nowhere, but now he can help people. He might not be able to join the war efforts but at least this way he can support it. He recalls the brutally heartbreaking cry Tony let out as he come last night. It digs straight into his heart like a spear. Steve has a lot to learn about Tony.
“Yeah, I see you little man. That’s cool.” She led them to another section in the library, her shell beaded necklace clattering as she walked. She pointed out several selections, but one was an overlarge book about that last days of World War II. “If I recall, the lion appeared at the very end around 1945.” She handed Jarvis the heavy book that looked like what his mother called a
She smiles, but there’s no mirth in it. “We both know that, don’t we?”
“You may answer. I would like you to speak now, omega.”
“Nope, there’s the other side right there.” Steve points to the far side of the slope. “Would it be better if we go down together?”
“It could be,” Tony said. “Do you? Can you talk to them?”
The realization steals the breath from his lungs, but Steve doesn’t allow him to face it on his own. He wraps Tony in his arms and legs. They are entangled. He shudders. He knows what happened when the Ornari attacked that other reality. He knows that the other reality saved theirs from the Ornari.
“Don’t go where I can’t follow,” Steve whispers. His hand strokes up and down Tony’s scarred side. “Wherever we go, from now on, we go together.”
Before Bruce can comment, JARVIS announces, “Sir, Logan also known as Wolverine, has arrived.”
“God, JARVIS I should have married you.” Tony smiles.
“I am not wishing you Merry Christmas in July, Tony. That’s ridiculous.”
“Let us pass,” Tony says his hand clasps Steve though, he cannot visualize him at all.
As he sits there, alone in the quiet corridor, Steve curls around himself trying not to let the cold stir within him. There are options, images of what happened to Bucky. They float unwanted to the surface and Steve cringes, gritting his teeth. Out in space there are so many horrible ways to die. Some subtle and slow, others explosive and devastating. Bucky once told him not to look it up.
“Why?” Tony asked. “Because you’re some superhero?”
“Came about five years ago. Sir, Mister Stane hired me. Now I understand that you and he ended things kind of in the negative.” Rumlow twisted his face as if it was difficult to manage those words. “But he was always fair here. Much better than in my former employ.”
So I have one more chapter of Force of Nature to post before I have to start writing it again. I am planning on continuing. But I can see that the interest in this story is abysmal. A few very committed readers are here and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I will finish this story for you.
Steve laughs, sharp, not welcoming sound. “Then you understand my proclivities as well.”
It occurs to Steve that Tony knows because of his inexperience and Steve colors in response.
That revelation hurts more than Tony wants to admit. He keeps wanting to deny the truth of it, but he can’t – Steven has continued to offer everything of himself. Tony, being the rich boy, the wealthy man, has always expected the best, accepting nothing short of it. In his past, he’s waved away the faults of others, dismissing them and whatever they have to offer. Steven came into his life, broken and sentenced to death, but still when duty called he stood up, and refused to allow this life to beat him. But Tony sees it as a product of his nature. It can’t be because Steven feels something toward him. Why would he?
“Some say you were a coward during the war, sir,” he adds the sir at the end because he realizes he’s just insulted his host.
That was a bit of new knowledge that Steve hadn’t heard. As they walked into the wide open living space of the house with its vaulted beamed ceilings and tinted windows for ages along the back side, Steve searched around for the missing vampires. “Where are Bruce and Thor?”
“What?” Steve said. Sometimes the future really tried his patience.
“I didn’t expect him.” She coughed, and the color drained out of her face. “What I had to do to him, today.”
“Yeah.” Tony rubs at his eyes. “Do you know sometimes I see after images. I’m not sure what they are of. Can’t tell if they’re real or my mind is playing tricks on me. When it first happened, I thought it meant something. It doesn’t at all.”
Tony seems sufficiently cowed by her comment and quietly excuses himself as the woman settles next to Steve on the bed. She reaches out with her gnarled hand and brushes over the stretch of his one wing.
“God, do it. Fucking do it.” He’s not sure what he’s asking for, or what he wants Tony to do. All he knows is that Tony’s vow to always want to be inside of him throws him into a new fit of desire and his cock is unnaturally hard again already. He doesn’t dare touch it. It’s too painful. The agony of need fills him as much as Tony’s fucking cock stretches and over stimulates him.
After long moments of settling and calming, Steve whispered, “I’m so sorry, Tony. I didn’t want you to face him alone. I wanted to be there.” Maybe if he’d been there things would have been different. He could have controlled the soul bond, cut it off. “The bond shouldn’t have done that.”
Considering his choices, Steve again decides to protect Tony’s reputation. “I think so. Must have been.”
Tony wonders how much sleep Steve gets. What could possibly have led him into a life that he’s chosen? Did he ever have a choice? He doubts everything he knows and then he thinks about how the morning started – a meeting with a woman about her dead son. Clues pile up but no answers.
He knows he shouldn’t break the training, not after spending so much time on it. How would that look? Yet, Steven is not his slave. Yet, what kind of independence does the man have at all? This was getting too complicated for Tony to worry about – he really needed to talk to Jamison or Pep.
“Yes, you could. I don’t think you will,” Steven says and steps across the short divide between them into his personal space. He surprises Tony then, by tenderly cupping Tony’s jaw and bringing his line of sight to focus on Steven’s eyes, his expression. “I once told you I never knew you to be so cruel, and you replied that I didn’t know you at all.”
“Way to go with the lesson, dickhead!” Tony raised his tin mug and yelled into the rest of the shadowed cabin.  Steve snickered in response. “Oh, the old man has a sense of humor.”
When they get to the service elevator, it takes a bit for the car to arrive and Steve anxiously looks behind them, worried the wait staff or some of the media reporters will sneak away and find them. The elevator dings its arrival and they step on.
Steve smiles under his hand and it sends shocks, thrilling and surprising, through Tony. “Yeah. I think that would be good.”
He must have fallen asleep at some point, because when he opened his eyes, light shone in from the windows and in the corner chair Tony sat waiting for him to awake. Steve sat up, not surprised somehow to see this mysterious, ambiguous version of Tony watching him.
“I wear the vest under the armor, Stevie-boy. Don’t worry about it,” Tony said with a smile. “Let’s go Cap.”
“Don’t worry. We already have him,” Iron Man said in his ear. “Legion, take her and her friend.”
Steve stops shifting around and stands at rest – Tony assumes the parade rest again. “Yes,  I can. Sir.”
What he read through the link he shared with Steve had startled him. The loneliness might have been expected from Steve, but the pure isolation, the alienation from the world around him, stunned Tony. Reaching out to Steve had been instinctual and he had assumed that Steve would pull away. Yet he hadn’t, not physically. He allowed Tony to touch him, to hold his hand as they sat by the fire. The communion of their bond tightened then, Tony felt it. He hadn’t known if Steve experienced it, but as when Steve closed the space between them it because crystalline clear that their bond was meant to be something more. Beloved had a special connotation. Not just a Companion or a Lover, but a soul mate, a heart mate.
“I’ve been trying to learn more about it. Not just about the hot sex and stuff we’re missing out on. But what it means overall. I do my homework,” Tony said as the firelight flickered over him.
Tony can only laugh. Time marches on. A desperate ugly god waiting to swallow up hope and lives but this time, this time they won. This time they stole life from it. Their time heist not only saved the universe, it saved them.
He didn’t stop until every last one of the books were read and read again.
“Because I’m good to my workers. And I know you. I know the type I should say. You’ll burn out early because you’re emotionally invested in all of your clients. You spend so much time learning about them, caring for them. You’ll burn out early especially when you lose one to the war.” Her voice settles. “In the end, Steve, you’re going to need it because you’re not going to last in this profession.”
“In my dreams.”
“Maybe, maybe.” Bruce is up, pacing around the living room.
“Yes.” Steve squeezed his hand. They sat on the riverbank for the rest of the hour as they waited for Natasha and news of the coming storm from America.
“There’s a footpath to the north shore of the island. Nice cliffs to the ocean,” Tony says. He doesn’t mention how it might be a good view as well, and Steve keeps quiet about it.
“JARVIS? The AI?”
“Suppose that’s a yes.” Or the beast is just tired of listening to Tony babble.
“You won’t even see me. You don’t want to talk to me. You stand-.” He pointed to the balcony. “You run away from me.”
Steve smiled and the genuine appreciation shined through the link. “Thank you, Tony. Thank you very much.” Then the smile dropped and Steve bowed his head, his hands covering his face. It was the first time Tony witnessed their Captain, their leader, break down.
“Are we going to do this or are you going to stand there and continue to insult my life choices?” Steve said and waited. He didn’t really have much more to pack – his life could be contained in a box and a duffle bag if he was honest with himself.
At first, he’d thought she was talking about the weapons. Surely, she understood when she applied for the program that Stark Industries was a weapons manufacturer. “It’s weapons, what did you expect?”
“What’s that?” Tony says and he’s back to concentrating on the thing he’s building again.
He clenches his gauntleted hand and heads toward the water. The path through the stream is usually Blu’s first route to find food. There’s a possibility Tony might be able to find footprints by the stream or some other evidence of a big prey animal like a lion. His heart hammers in his chest. Today was the day he was going to test the HUD out, finally get out of this place, but now he’s petrified that Blu is gone, dead somewhere and Tony only thought of himself last night. He calls out several times as he approaches the water.
“Shit,” Tony said and dropped the handset.
The Glock clicks, a flash of light, and then they’re running through the corridors of the Soviet base. Steve’s not sure what the hell just happened, but Tony has him by the hand and they flee.
Both men are in the adjoining workshop with Stane’s loud booming voice pitching through the room like a tuba in an echo chamber. He’s angry and frustrated with the prince. The way he treats Tony – like an obstinate child – irks Steve.
“You know this dimension stuff doesn’t make sense. Dimensions aren’t realities. So, lion you couldn’t have come from another reality.”
“Captain America!” He spat at Steve. “Where the fuck is your allegiance? Come on! Don’t let them use you like this!” He launched another attack, but Steve caught his arm and twisted upward, contorting the elbow to sprain it. The crackle of the shock stick sizzled in the cramped space, and Steve took the chance of freeing Rumlow’s one hand to grab at his waist. Clutching his belt, Steve heaved and threw Rumlow into the overhead grate and light. It fizzled as Rumlow dropped unconscious to the floor.
Pepper glances again at Tony but he shrugs and shakes his head. “We’re on a tight deadline, since Mister Stark needs you for a meeting tomorrow. But if you feel inclined to have an attorney look at it, then we can reschedule your start date.” She looks to Tony again. “I suppose I can fill in.”
The evening settled around them; the lights from the street below glistened and the shadows shifted across his apartment as she studied him. “Steve, I’m going to ask you a question and I need you to be honest with me.”
“Not exactly.” He stood there, staring at Tony with his hot chocolate mug in his hand. His eyes looked dead and Tony thought about whether or not the myths about zombies might be truth. It was unnerving.
“It is easy enough to see, if you had eyes to see.”
Tony rolls him over and rubs his back. As he settles, he asks, “What’s going on?”
“Yes, I would. I hope you will decide otherwise. Your scent is pleasing to me, more so than other omegas,” Tony admits. It’s true. There’s something enticing and intoxicating about the man even though he’s barely more than a rag.
“Oh sorry,” Steve says and hands them to Tony, placing them into his hand with some firmness. It’s better than the tender way he took them, but it needs work. It will all need work, but he has a meeting tomorrow and they need to get over the kinks today.
“I went with him, pretending to be a prisoner as well,” Nat said with a shrug of her shoulder. “He didn’t ask a lot of questions. We got Bucky out and Clint. Bucky had been with them for so many more years, and Clint – well, he’s another story. You should look at the drive.” She placed it on the table between them and he just stared at it like it was some kind of key to the heavens or the hell. He was making a choice, deciding on his fate and the fate of others.
Steve never hesitated. He ran his tongue up and down Tony’s length as he swallowed and bobbed his head. It thrilled and drove Tony into a madness. He heard someone talking. It might have been him. He didn’t know. He found himself holding Steve’s head, thrusting into his willing, moist mouth. He could have Steve on his cock all day. Holding him and warming him. Even as he thought it their souls chimed together, wrapping tight and urgent. Steve groaned around him as he fisted his hand and pushed it at his own hard cock. Tony couldn’t hold on, he needed more and he grasped at Steve’s hair, pushing farther down his throat and then Steve gripped Tony’s hips, helping him to go deeper still.
“As you may know, Sheriff Rogers, my brother has a peculiar nature.”
He shakes his head and then says, “No, thanks.”
“You don’t have to do this.”
He ran barefooted to the elevator and JARVIS took him down to Steve’s assigned level. When the doors of the elevator opened after asking for entrance, Tony found Steve on his couch head in his hands and phone on the cushion next to him.  Through the waves of the bond, Tony felt the ache. It had been there before as he woke up, Tony realized that some key part of the bond was missing, gone.  Standing in front of Steve, the rebound of the ache increased to be acute and potent. He reached out, nearly afraid to do so because of the pain, and touched Steve’s shoulder.
“It’s romantic,” he mumbles as Sam places Steve’s head on his lap. He presses a towel to Steve’s shoulder and collarbone as he uses his phone with the other hand.
“Privac- holy shit! You really are going all in, aren’t you?” Tony rushed after him. He grabbed his bag as he followed Steve.
Natasha nodded as if she expected it. “Is Fury in position? And Thor?”
Happy nods to Steve.
"I want to help."
Tony twisted around and said, “Yeah?”
Soon after the astronauts returned to Earth, Howard Stark’s team examined
That’s when Steve glimpsed it, the horrible reckoning of a fractured soul as it battled the tether holding it to Earth. It sought to be consumed by the ever increasing dark void around them. Steve shuddered in its cold presence and then he heard a muted howl and realized it was Clint begging to live, to survive. This was his fault again. He rushed forward but then something, a bond, caught him and held him back from Bruce’s work. It felt like someone clasped him around his chest, keeping him back as Bruce wove the energies together, getting the crests to synchronize even as the tendrils whipped about trying for release. In a final heave, the purpled soul lurked away, trying to spread out its energies so that Bruce couldn’t possibly knot them together.
Strange snickers. “Of course, if you’d rather my esteemed colleague.”
It felt more like a proclamation instead of a simple statement. Steve released a pent-up breath. “I’ll see him, soon.”
“I’m not sure the founding fathers were talking about me when they said all men were created equal.”
“Tell me how that worked again?” Steve reaches for the mug of coffee as Tony offers it to him. It’s not how he likes it. It has a ton of milk – Steve likes it black and strong. “You know how I’m trying to increase my skillset.”
“Lash out?” Tony snaps and then witnesses the glimmer of tension flicker through Steven’s expression. He breathes once, holds it, and then exhales. “Okay, I get you. So let me put it this way. I understand a little. You’re as tied to your nature as I am. Your bonding gland forces you to seek me out, be with me, protect me. I get that. I think. Also, a lot of my training from early on, as you said, was from Estane. After the past few days – well- let’s just say I’ve learned my lesson. Or I have to unlearn some lessons he granted me.”
Tony shakes his head in the dark – that’s never going to be dark again with the shining blue light as his forever companion. “No. Not anymore. I had this – this little lion.”
“Yes, he has.”  Steve refused Thor’s insistence on coming along with them. Though Thor went searching, he always came back empty handed. Steve told Thor he believes he can convince Loki to return without the added animosity the two brothers share. In deference, Thor agreed to help Sam if there was a need.
Waving a smartphone at Tony, Steve scoffed. “You should be getting a text any second. See you tomorrow, Tony.” He smiled and then the video cut off.
It doesn’t take long for Tony immerse himself in the task. He sees nothing, thinks of nothing for days. When he emerges from his heady meditation of discovery and building because Yinsen prompts him to eat, Tony notices the lion is back but has his face in the corner as if trying to hide.
Steve nods silently. Dinner is a quiet affair. Tony tells Steve about where Stark Industries is headed next and that he’s dissembling the Iron Legion. Too many variables leave it as a liability rather than an asset. They also touch upon the idea of a shield around the world. Steve’s not sold on the idea, and Tony worries it might fall into the wrong hands at one time or another.
“You’re dead. We all are. Dead that is.” Tony points to the wound on his neck. “That is a product of some very smooth magic. That’s one of the reasons I called Frigga to come and heal you. It’s Soul Magic and she knows about that kind of thing since she was raised by witches.” He states all this as if it’s common knowledge.
He couldn’t. Until he flopped down on his back again and Tony – his ghost – was there again. Tony smiled down at him and then Steve moved, shifted, opening for Tony.  The slide and slip of Tony breaching him startled Steve but he accepted it. He wanted it, the heat of his need blinding him to right or wrong. Tony thrust in slow easy strokes and then Steve felt his hand encompassed by Tony’s ghostly hand. Together they worked Steve, as Tony continued an ever increasing rhythm. Steve couldn’t deny the heightened throb of his heart, the hunger coiling deep inside of him. He urged Tony and threw himself into the feeling, the intensity, and the rolling thrum until at last he succumbed to it. Opening eyes he hadn’t remembered that he’d closed, he met Tony’s gaze and a knowing streaked through them.
“Sir.” Steven nods and joins Tony at his side. There’s a fine tremor to his walk and Tony studies him.
“Do you think he’ll use something more -.” Tony clenches his jaw and then spits it out. “Something more personal?” There’s real fear in his eyes, as if the shadows lurking in the storage closet shift and reform into monsters of the past.
“I’m packing. I think it’s best,” Steve replies but doesn’t look at Tony. He rolls up a few t-shirts and shoves them into the bag. “It’s best. For as long as I remember Tony, I’ve always wanted to do what’s right. Even as lion from a different world or dimension or reality or cursed or whatever it was. I tried to do good. Now, I’m here. Doing what?”
Many in the west don’t appreciate that the origins of the city comes from the seven islands. These islands on the western shores of India comprise the center of culture and finance as well as the underbelly of the country. Nations all over the world seed their own demise. Pundits and politicians of the United States always pick the large metropolitan areas of America as the core of what was wrong with the nation. Nothing could be farther from the truth in the United States. Current opinion in India mirrors what’s been said about the States – that the cities will curse the country. Personally, he’s never seen it that way, but always seen it as the inverse.
Cho cringes at the thrown out nickname. “I’m not your sister and I know how to read your interface monitor. If the threat to the Captain gets into the red zone, we’ll pull him out.”
"That was tasty. Rumlow is a fucking animal."
Maria answered, “They were victims in a war several years ago, leaving them orphaned and living on the streets. From what we can gather from the SHIELD data dump -.” Hill glanced Natasha’s way for a second and then turned back to Steve. “They were recruited by SHIELD – but it was really Hydra probably. For experiments.”
“Sir?”
Tony crosses the room when Steve doesn’t take his hand. Even as Steve moves slightly away from him, he brushes past him and taps the wall near the pinned drawings. “Who did these?” He points to the three quarters profile of a woman with her face in her hand and her tender eyes gazing at the viewer. “Who is this? Your mother, Sarah?”
The side of the helmet catches his eye. “Will you look at that – a bowl. Should use my head more often.” This sends him into a laughing jag that ends with him crying from the pain. He lies there on his back looking up to the darkening sky. “What did I do? Why did I come back?”
Steve looks over at him. Tony blinks and looks like he’s staring directly at Steve. For a second, Steve thinks he is seeing him. His heart jumps in his chest and he says, “Tony?”
Steve teeters to the side. His ribs hurt; his lungs burn. He needs air.
Yet another mystery about Captain America. Tony wobbles and pitches forward into the snow, eating a good chunk of it. Probably ate bear piss or something else foul. He manages to get onto his feet and searches around for the shield. It’s only about ten feet from him but it’s through drifts of snow. Pushing his way through it, he grabs the sled and climbs back up the hill. It looks like the slope is ruined with all the footsteps and Tony’s body prints so maybe this whole fiasco can end. He grumbles as he makes the top of the slope.
Yinsen hums a little. “No, I suppose it isn’t.” He chops up the small onion and the carrot.
For the first week, Tony stayed cooped up in the house, never venturing farther than the patio or balcony. Steve finally convinced him to go on a walk. As they leave the house, Steve asks, “Do you want a hoodie? It’s a little on the cooler side today?”
“A dick? Yeah, he was you can say it.” Tony inhales, holds it, and then confesses, “You know what hurts the most about his death? I was actually a little relieved when he died. Like he’d been such an a-hole to me. I’d just come out as bi and he went ballistic. Told me thanks for ruining Christmas you little shit.”
“Well, maybe we should remedy that,” Tony said and sank down into his arms.
“Is it bad?”
“I didn’t say anything,” Bruce muttered, then he added, “That’s not what I understand as the role of Beloved.”
“Get Steve, where’s Steve?” Tony says and someone’s strapping him down onto a gurney.
Before he disappears, Steve jumps up and asks, “You’re a mysterious lot, you know that, right?”
“I hope you know what you’re doing. Captain Rogers might be able to handle the increased stress on his heart, but Stark isn’t.  If he hasn’t told you, then I will and damned confidentiality. He has heart damage that puts him at higher risk.” Her argument supports her poignant silent plea.
Steve tells JARVIS he’s ready and that he’s headed to Tony’s quarters. Before he leaves, he stows some supplies in his pockets, just in case the nanites don’t last. He also places a few of his med-patches in one of the pockets as well. If he’s staying over Tony’s quarters, it’s better to have access to them. He stops and thinks about the star broach he purchased for Tony. He shakes his head. It’s not time for that – maybe it never will be time for that.
“Sounds a like a good idea to me,” Gamora states.
It occurs to him probably not as often as Tony though. He’s totally at ease in the underground levels of the Pentagon, in the place and feel of it. As a defense contractor for the majority of his adult life, Tony probably frequented the place often. Steve realizes his buzzing brain isn’t taking the time to inventory where he’s going or what’s happening around him, but he glimpses Tony and it assures him that Tony knows. If there’s anyone here that Steve would trust it’s Tony. Their bond may be broken, and a world of changes occurred in their relationship, but Tony is someone that Steve can trust.
She moves off to the door. He follows her, intending to wrench the door open and get out of this hell. She shoves a hand on his chest. “No, I’ll find you. I’ll come back to you to help get him. But not here, not now. In the future. I’ll come get him. But you have to hide him until then. It won’t be safe for him. Get out, get out, now.”
“That is one old lion, Jarvis,” Tony said and stood up, taking the toy.
“Not again with the picnic.” Tony grabs Steve’s arm and uses a standard white cane as they take to the footpath.
“Okay, so maybe not blind.” Blu shifts his gaze back to Tony. “I still think you’re a crappy lion. Why haven’t you eaten those guys? I mean between you and me they aren’t treating you very well. Just – you know – bite them.” Tony mimes biting and the lion opens his mouth making a sound that melds a yawn with a growl. “Okay, so maybe you don’t like terrorist snacks.”
“A whole lot more,” Bruce said and continued to chop away at the vegetables with such vigor Steve had to wonder what they’d ever done to him.
“And you shouldn’t.” Steve leans forward and kisses Tony’s temple. “You shouldn’t. I made my bed. I made the mistake.”
Underneath the strange words that don’t really seem to go together is a hurriedly sketched picture of Captain America’s shield. He would know it anywhere. He slept on Captain America sheets as a child.  Back to the road, he checks the traffic and inches forward, but then he’s back to the words and the shield. It only takes his brain a few seconds to put the words together with the shield.
Tony yanks on him and shakes his head. “Where’s your sense of adventure? Plus, it has to be getting late. I don’t think I can take another few hours on the bike. Can you?”
Truth be told, I don't even remember writing this one at all...
“Yeah? Whose there?”
She nodded. “Will do.”
“Not all the time, but yes.” She finishes. “There. Now if you please, take it off and try not to mess with my markings. When you get it back there won’t be active nanites. It will be fitted just for you.”
Most of the time, Thor wore his armor sans cape. Yet on the farm, he’d taken to wearing civilian clothes, even when they were playing war games. Usually during their training exercises, Thor wore his chainmail over his civilian clothes. It felt all wrong and out of place, like someone decided to dress up a golden retriever. Still, Thor seemed comfortable in the two sizes too small plaid shirt and the torn jeans. He’d tied back his hair, though a few strands fell free around his face.
“I know you do,” Tony replied. The very last thing he wanted right now was to lose everything they’d started to build. He never thought they would get this far. The moment that Steve told him about Bucky and his parents remained in sharp relief in Tony’s memories. Sometimes it was hard to get around when he thought of the pack, its members, and his future.
Instantly, the few different packs in the world that had been studied appeared, but it wasn’t the players or individuals. Instead what blinked and materialized in tantalizing blues, reds, and yellows included what could only be described as neural networks. As soon as he glimpsed them he recognized it. He might not be a biomedical scientist or engineer, but the similarities couldn’t be denied. Each member offered a piece of the puzzle, yet the individuals were not isolated but merged through the neural networks in a pattern that reminded Tony of his work with artificial intelligence. The idea that he was a part of it excited him, but when he thought of those moments in the cabin, his heart dropped.
His throat cramps up and he can’t ask any questions.
“I took a shower.”
“Why not?” Tony starts to his feet.
“Put the Captain on the gurney,” Clint said. “We can move faster that way.”
Slipping out of bed, Steve pads to the attached bathroom and quickly and efficiently cleans up. He notes the marks on his neck and chest from the prince and wishes he was back in his quarters so he could properly cover them with some of the makeup the Brothel purchased for him. It wouldn’t do to have him walking around in the Prince’s ship looking like a slut. He feels the flush of heat to his face. Under his breath he reminds himself he’s not a slut, he’s a sex worker and that’s a profession. He provides comfort and care to lost souls and if there’s anyone out there that’s lost – it’s the prince.
He calls out to them, not crying their names, but seeking them both in this realm and the next. The Boundaries are shuttered to him and no matter how far he reaches into them, the cold liquid of evil seeps out. There’s something wrong within the worlds and realms. He cannot search, because the way has been infected with the lower realms, the realms of evil intent.
“I don’t know what you’re doing here but apparently I’m visiting places and times in my life. You know like they always say your life flashes before your eyes. I suppose in some weird way that’s true.” He shrugged and a sound reminiscent of ice crunching under boots echoed in the tent.
The pheromones leaking from Steven’s gland drift heavy in the air. He wants to drink from the gland so much that his knees nearly buckle as he tries to resist. For his part, Steven arches his neck and looks away. It is a biological response, nothing more. Tony collapses to his knees and pulls Steven toward him, drinking the elixir, tasting the sweetness while the salt from his own tears taint it.
"JARVIS?"
“Nah,” Tony says and shakes his head. “I think that’s already in play in a way.”
He walks the length of the boardwalk of the main street toward the saloon. It’s nearly time to meet Tony and his nerves tingle and jump. It feels like his skin is popping like Mexican jumping beans. He’s never allowed himself this luxury before, and he knows Bucky would never approve.
Steve shook his head. His body remembered every touch, every stroke. He recalled how they suckled at him, how they brought him to anxious heights as he struggled against the stimulation. When they finally allowed him release how he sank into the endorphins with relish like a hungry man at a feast. Only his feast would be tainted by the hell of shame. He recalled how they brought in more than one at a time, how they touched him, how they fucked him. “No, I can’t tell you.” He came every time. His body climaxed and came. And how he found refuge in those climaxes – an escape. He’d blocked it all out when he first woke up. Maybe his weaknesses helped him, protected him then, but now as his strength was reset, it marched back to him like an invasion.
“Quick and dirty, I like it.” Natasha turned to Sam. “In or out. We have a lot to accomplish and not a lot of time.”
He needs to be good.
Steve frowned and ignored her indirect reference to his relationship. “I think you’re right. We need another group but Sharon and Maria are not enough.”
She glides right by his sarcastic ‘sure’ and lifts the garment bag. “This is your uniform for today. I’m a little worried about the fit so if you could try it on, I might be able to get a uniform fabricator to alter it.” She shoves the garment bag at him.
“The convention thing. What’s it mean?”
“Something like that, son.” Howard stabbed his filet. “I don’t expect your mother to understand. What, Maria, didn’t you just go to finishing school?” The barb struck home, and Tony watched as his mother wilted.
His face must show his surprise.
Steve cannot help the guffaw as he holds his abdomen for a hard belly laugh that shakes his shoulders and brings tears to his eyes from the pain. “You? A blacksmith?”
Once the phone call disconnects, Steve says, “Sleep in?”
Tony beams at Steve, all too willing to forget Steve’s past transgressions. A wave of guilty shame washes over Steve and he grits his teeth. All the emotions crossing paths in his brain hurt and he needs a moment to get himself together.
He thanks her and soon she’s shoves him out of the door. He doesn’t think he’s ended up with any more information than when he started the day. He has two names and no way to find anything more about either. In fact one of the names – Coulson – there isn’t even a first name to go along with it. Unless, of course, the unlikely event is that Coulson’s first name is Agent and Tony sincerely doubts that.
“Jesus!” Tony says and scrambles for the latches. His talented hands find each one, unlocking them. He yanks at the helmet and throws it to the side. His hands are on Steve’s face. “Are you having an asthma attack? Nod if you are.”
“We have to scrub you up. I bet you only shower or bathe every few months.”
“That’s really how you’re going to tackle this? I thought you were some master strategist and tactician.” Tony sidled up to him, close enough to touch but not.
“You think it’s safe? Well,” Tony says and kneels down. He cups his hands. “Well, then it’s safe.” He brings the fresh water to his lips and drink. The scratch of his throat causes the water to burn a bit as he swallows but it tastes so very good, so very welcome. He drinks again and wants to drink his fill, but Blu splashes across the creek and places his paw on Tony’s hand, stopping him.
Whispering in his ear, he says, “If you can’t get me, promise me you’ll get out. Promise me.”
Tony opens his mouth as if he might refuse but then shuts it and walks beyond Steve toward the lift. It’s exactly where Steve needs to go in order to leave the ship. Tony steps aside and starts toward his own quarters. Steve hits the button, wishing for the damned lift to get there, but then before it does Tony returns.
Tony grins, that winning smile. “And camera crew. See you then Everhart.”
“Like he had a master plan,” Clint supplies. “Yeah, yeah, and it was to take down his sponsor all along like you said. You told me he had planned to burn Ultron and gut the whole of the hegemony of the Main Chamber.”
“Shouldn’t be, and if there is I’ll set them straight,” Natasha promises.
When Natasha cuts off her comm-grid conversation, she looks at Clint and frowns. “I told you no purple.”
He wants it.
“Yes, you said you needed one. You answered my ad.”
She chuckles. “Seriously, it’s just Pepper. The title is truly honorary since I spend most of my time running errands for a very wayward prince.” She holds a tablet close to her chest. “Come this way, I’ll show you to your quarters then you can meet the prince.”
“That’s not exactly true. I want to be here. I want to be able to afford the augmentation to fix my health problems.” He lifts a shoulder. “It’s just not my dream.”
Steve chances a question. “Who will be there?”
It seemed like an age until they were fully disrobed. They took their time, Tony slowly removed each article of clothing from Steve, then Steve doing the same for Tony. They paused at each moment, kissing and exploring. Anytime Steve shuddered with hesitation and fear, Tony strung their souls together and it relaxed them both – Steve brought Tony down to the bed. It wasn’t too uncomfortable but having Tony laying on top of him helped. To feel body to body, the heat, increased Steve’s need.
The man picks up the welding torch and frowns, his eyes shift to assess Tony again.
“Feels like a small disc, no bigger than a pea.” Tony takes his hand away as does Steve. “It’s the anchor to the actual implant in my head. It works. Most of the time. Unfortunately, it gives me killer headaches and worse.” He takes the glasses off and hands them in Steve’s direction, who takes them and lays them back in the desk. “You need to ensure you have them or I have them at all times.”
“Well, not for this week you don’t,” Steve says with a wink.
“Why does it sound like your Frodo and I’m Samwise?” Steve asks. “I hope you don’t think like that. That you’re Frodo with an evil ring to bear?”
“No inconvenience, sir. My friends and I celebrated last night.” Steve cringes because he must realize how that sounds. “Not with alcohol. Just with cake.”
“That’s just it, you can’t,” Tony muttered, and he glared at Steve. “You’re going to die. All of you are going to die. Just like my mother died.”
Steve gawks at her. The idea of attending such functions blows his mind. His lack of experience will be on display – not his sexual lack of experience but his knowledge of polite society. “How do I?” He swallows and fists his hands. This is not going to go well.
“God damn it, son. Captain America is a myth. Don’t you get it? He’s gone, and no one is ever going to find him. No one.” His eyes were wild then, wild and anxious as if having Tony believe him – that  Captain America was dead and gone and Tony know it was the most important thing in the world.
Jarvis comes into the kitchen by way of the dining room and only nods toward the sink and beyond it. Steve spots the back room that is directly behind the kitchen sink. He surmises it must be the way out to the wash trough behind the house, but he’s wrong. It’s a small washroom with a hand pump in a basin to pull water in from the underground well.
“Well, all is not lost,” Bruce said. “It’s not like you’re that far into it.” Bruce walked back into the laboratory, leaving Steve in the lounge. Steve frowned and wondered if he should follow but Bruce just said, “Hold on a minute.”
That startles Tony and, for a long moment, only shame fills him. What he just did was not consensual, not in the cleanest fashion of the word. Consent though is a different beast between a prime alpha and a sub omega. “I cannot apologize. As I will not apologize when I take you and bond with you. I am almost near my urgency. In fact, let’s get this over with – I am in my urgency. You’re my omega now. My mother was Aria Carbonelli which, from your reaction, I know you remember her. There’s nothing to stop this now.”
“I’m not sure that’s-.” Tony starts but then Steve catches his gaze. “Okay, maybe a little.”
“Don’t blame it on the school systems, Tony. I was out a lot because of illness. Always sick.” Steve pecks Tony on the cheek and starts toward the bathroom, scooping up the small purse with the nanite applicators in it. Tony instructed him a little more about the nanites early this morning, telling him they would restore the integrity of his entrance and muscles as they disintegrate after their escapades. Steve nearly choked on his laughter when Tony used the word ‘escapades’. At the same time though relief flooded him because the idea of being too lose is difficult to imagine for both his long term health and his short term career.
Thor looked at them, bewildered. He tugged up his sleeve to find the swirl of the mark on his arm. “What devilry is this?”
“Okay. Yeah.” Happy breathes a few times in the phone. Over the last week, Steve’s learned Happy is a heavy breather by habit. “You’re a good kid and all. Thanks for doing this for him.”
She whistles. “No but that would be a great product. Do you know where I could get my hands on it?”
“How long have you been assigned here?” Tony asked.
Tony grins at Rhodey. “If they tell anyone, Rhodey promises he’ll shoot them. Won’t you, sweetcakes.”
“Now get yourself to see Bruce. He’ll take a blood sample to check your status.” She walks back to the bar, staring at the fish captured in the tank.
Logan takes out a cigar but doesn’t light it. He just lets it hang out of his mouth. “So you’re entangled with your other selves.”
His hand shaking, Steve hits the implant one last time. “Query, is James Buchanan Barnes’ status official or unknown?”
He eased away from Tony, panting and trembling from the effects of their soul exploration. Tony looked wide-eyed at him; the tears dried on his face. “What? What was that?”
As the fire crackled in the background, the light flickering across the small cabin, Steve went through the Mantra in his head to open up his thoughts to Tony.
“This must be your jet.”
“Don’t say it,” Steve says and can’t help but laugh. “Let’s get you upstairs and I’ll get the rest of the crew up to speed.”
“I’d like to know if the elixir they’re extracting is permanent or if they have to keep drinking in the elixir,” Tony remarked. It was something he believed that Cho and her coven would study and could find the answer to if they could resource it out to her.
But Tony shakes his head, his eyes losing any focus. “In charge, you’re in charge. You- you tell me. You’re my-God! You’re my Captain!” His hips thrust but Steve captures his cock and squeezes it, stopping him from coming.
He falls gently asleep . Thankfully it is blissful and he does not dream. When he wakes he’s in a hospital room that’s more decked out like a hotel room. The bed still has all the monitors around it and is still a hospital bed. The rest of the room is outfitted very much like a luxury hotel room. The windows are large and there’s a sliding door to a balcony. There’s a sitting area with tables and what looks like a bar across from the bed. There are several doors to the right of the sitting area, one of which Steve decides must be the bathroom.
Steve raspberries the air. “Oh really. Ah! You know nothing.”
“Like when I’m working and maybe other people could come in?”
Strange glares at him, but then says, “That bad.”
He should never have asked – how could he be so stupid, so selfish. “I was selfish before, I’d gotten brash, too many victories. I was there to help save the world and Bucky – but he fell off the train because I thought we were invincible.”
When they step out onto the main holding floor, Tony sees that the two levels are open to one another. He can spot all of the available Omegas for the warrior blocks. There are stairs to climb to the upper level or the elevator with catwalks to the perimeter that holds the cells. Pep walks to the glass partition of one of the cells and begins to interview the first candidate. The young woman looks well enough and she’s interesting, but she prefers her alpha to be a woman, and Tony respects her wishes. They move through the different cells and the wired knot in his belly jabs as if it has barbs and thorns on it. It feels like nettles.
“He needs me, Tony,” Steve said but he still hadn’t looked at him. He gripped the counter and shook his head. “I’ve done the ground work. I started to try and reach out to him, give him a way home.”
The Enforcer at his side went to the door and opened it. A shuffled of boots but Steve didn’t bother to strain to look and see who it was. That fact was answered in seconds. “Jesus Christ, what the hell did you do to him?”
“Got that in one.”
Once Steven settles, Tony unlocks the harness and removes the dildo. He places both to the side to be cleaned later. Steven falls on his ass, wincing as he does, but he lowers his head as if he mourns something lost within him.
There’s a large sigh. “Tony?” He opens the door. He is in only his undershorts and looks aggrieved. “Where have you been? I’ve been-.” He stops and puts his hand to his mouth as if he should not share.
“It isn’t probably, it is true.” And now, Tony turns strident, passionate, and keenly pointed and focused as if he has a mission, when he continues. “I intend to make this my home, Captain. I’ve been looking for some place I could spend what days I have left, free from society’s expectations. My business be damned. I have the money still, and the reputation. I don’t care, I want to leave it all behind and find peace here.”
He taps his way over to the couch and settles down. It’s late at night and energy buzzes through him. It’s been this way since the accident. Circadian rhythms are for the visual population. He lives in a twilight world, a place where night and day meld together. It reminds him of those winter days when he was a kid and they lived in the mansion on 5th avenue. Days when clouds obscured the sun and the trees and street were covered in snow. Everything blended together in tones of silver, white, gray, and black. His life is like that now. It doesn’t matter how much the glasses help him; he doesn’t know what red is. He doesn’t know what blue is. Not anymore. It’s a fantasy he’s been chasing for nearly 10 years. He’s Alice in Wonderland, seeking a white rabbit with a pocket watch ticking down his time until everything falls apart, until he topples down the rabbit hole.
Phillips stood across the desk from him, shaking his head. “I can’t let you do it, son. What would the President think of me if I let their golden boy get killed by an insane beta?”
“In a minute, I have to just finish up this little piece.” He keys in the last of the designer code that Tony dictated to him. “There. Done.”
“Shit.”
“Really?”
Steve takes it and, instead of putting it on the small table in front of him, places it on his lap. “Thank you. Grapes? Cheese? I haven’t had any of these in.” He stops, failing for words.
“Dinner already, J?”
Tony doesn’t want to agree, because that means the Steve that’s laying down in the medical bay, the one he’s having all these feelings for, the one he’s been dating for nearly a month – he really doesn’t have memories. Not the memories sketched all over the papers on the coffee table, not the memories of Tony as his husband. Tony’s going to lose something he never had, and it fucking rends him, tears him apart. Maybe it’s his own entanglement. Maybe that’s it. Maybe once they isolate the alternate reality, then Tony won’t feel hollowed out and empty.
“What was that all about?”
Steve pushes up, trying to at least get a view of where they are. Tony tries his best to stop him, but he fails. Instead he adjusts Steve into a semi-reclined position. “Where?” His words are breathy, hardly whispered.
Steve closed the book and put it on the table between them. “We’re all a little part of the problem. We’re so used to doing things, getting the job done, on our own, doing it our own way, I don’t think we know how to function as a group.”
“All of this is happening in a computer matrix. We’re completely sedated on the other side.” Tony grips him under the arm and hoists him to his feet. It causes a looping motion to the verdant green fields around him but generally he can settle the horizon stills himself. “The entrance is pretty much what Cho and I constructed so I think we’ve been successful.”
“Yeah,” Sam said. He waited. He had the ability to read people and know when it was time to speak and when it was time to listen and to wait.
“Steve,” Tony replies with a short nod. “We need to go to the shuttle bay of the ship.”
Tony snickers. “You just made it weird, you know.”
“He lied to me.”
Alpha comes back with a couple of towels. He asks Steve to lie back on the cushions and then places one of the warmed, wet towels over Steve’s face. It feels nice.
“Always, Ma.” He hangs his head. Here he is weeping over something he can’t have, like that’s going to help anything. Steve needs fresh goals, not fantastic ideas of a hero swooping in to save him from a life of poverty, hunger, and despair. He’s more than his broken body. Once he earns enough from the Brothel, augmentation will be possible, and doors will open. There’s no two ways about it. He has to last. That’s his plan, he’s sticking to it.
“You’ve poisoned this realm, Schmidt. You cannot keep us here,” Steve states. His words and belief remain strong, but his fears rise as the blackness extends to tendrils that slither up his legs. It’s cold to the touch. He reaches toward his center, toward his true North and that’s Tony. It’s always been Tony.
“In a purely chaste way. Tell me I’m wrong. And remember we promised not to lie or hold back the truth from one another. Go on tell me I’m wrong.” He has both hands on the counter he’s leaning into the space.
Fire ran through Tony right to his groin. “Christ, that’s hot.”
“Here you go.” Steve dumps nearly the whole small bag sandwich bag into Tony’s mug. He saves a few for himself. He prepares his own hot chocolate and then settles down and stares out at the ocean.
“Modern lacrosse is played in the Gravity bowl of the station. This means that there aren’t stabilized gravity waves. Therefore, spectators need to wear specialized boots otherwise they will be subjected to free float effect.”
Tony pants through his anger, regulates his breathing and then says, “Sorry, but – sorry. I would like it if I could take care of you now. Is that all right?” He waits and then adds softer, “As your alpha, you have performed well shown me your fealty and I would like to reciprocate.”
The expression, the light, the joy in Tony’s face breaks everything for Steve. He wants so much to kiss this man, to hold him and to rejoice. But that is not his place. Not at all. There’s a skip in time, a moment when a yearning passes over Tony’s face and then it’s gone and he’s clearing his throat and stepping away from Steve, breaking their handhold.
“I think I know where they are.” Steve turns to face Tony, hands under his cheek. “You’re not going to believe me, but it’s the perfect place to hide out because no one really see you there.”
He finds tears streaming down his face. It motivates him to move, to crash through the pain binding him in the cold. Tony blinks away the tears and then has his phone in his hand before he can stop himself. He has connected to a number with the phone at his ear.
The silence weighs on them, then. There are no other words to say because it’s true. Whatever happened to Steve is a science Tony doesn’t understand. He can’t even figure out where to begin to try and discern how it happened or why. Tony puzzles over it, listening until Steve falls asleep, thinking he would leave, but by that time, the heaviness of inertia settles over him and he stays until he too slumbers.
The force of Tony’s thrusts move the table, causing it to screech against the flooring. It doesn’t distract or stop Tony. He’s well lost in the feel and touch, the imminent explosion of their bodies fucking. Steve sees the tension fill the arteries in the prince’s neck, feels the tightened grip on his shoulders as nails dig into his flesh. There will be bruises on his tender flesh in the morning. And then Tony throws his head back and howls words that are meaningless but nonetheless trigger a pulsation so hard and forceful that Steve’s vision whites out and he feels himself spill without a hand on him. The clenching of his ass around Tony causes the prince to fall over the edge as well and then both cry out.
Blu ends up strolling away. Tony calls out to him but Blu only purrs back. He listens to the night insects come alive as the twilight turns to evening, and then evening turns to night. He hopes Blu comes back. He doesn’t want to be here alone. With deft hands, he slips on the gauntlet and hooks up the wires to the arc reactor. Even with his injured arm, he’s able to do it now. The gauntlet stabilizes his arm. He thinks he should keep it on for a while as a splint as well as protection.
“What? Wait. No. That’s not it at all.” Steve drops down back into his chair.  “You treat everyone like family, Tony. I was drunk. Really, really drunk.”
“You gonna need to,” Natasha said. “If you have any hope of moving forward.”
“Yes, I accept the calls. Time Delay?” Steve asks. He wants to know if it will be a live discussion or if he’s just going to get an update from his friend.
“Don’t stop!” Tony commands. His eyes are wild with the chase. Steve cannot hear anyone behind them, but that’s not the game anymore. The game has no rules or restrictions.
As Steve started to rock into his mouth, Tony ran his tongue along the underside of his thick cock. Pre-come ran freely from his cock and Tony lapped at it, sucking and licking as he did. Steve growled out a half scream, half cry. Tony looked up to catch a glimpse of Steve, rolling his head against the back of the couch, hands now gripping the threadbare fabric and tearing it. His mouth was open as he cried out and it jolted Tony. He needed to stop or else he was going to come without a hand on him. Just seeing Steve so overcome and feeling the reflection of it along the lines of their souls as they wrapped together took his breath away. Yet he transcended the physical plane of feeling, of experiencing the moment. He tried to clasp onto the feelings, the coiling in his groin as he closed in on climax but he failed to stay. The energies surrounding them permeated his consciousness until it lifted him and it transformed him. Souls merged and he only succumbed to its power, its potency.
Finding Steve on the riverbank shocked Tony as he flew low over the scene. The deep-seated tug inside of him Tony ignored at that moment. He pretended it was nothing but instinct, but now he realized it must have been something more. He’d picked Steve up, ruined and beaten, flying him to the nearest hospital. JARVIS guided him. Even as he left the suit at the entrance to the emergency room, holding onto Steve as nurses and doctors surrounded them, Tony’s heart hurt. He couldn’t describe it in any other way. The pain spread and when he touched Steve’s hand as the nurses begged him to leave as Steve was placed on the gurney Tony felt something shocking and pure in his chest. In a daze, Steve awoke, focused on Tony for one pristine second, and spoke one word, just the one.
The rest of the ride is silent. Tony turns on the heat in the car even though it is late summer and he’s boiling due to the humidity and the temperature outside. He notices that Steve shivers and curls in on himself. Clearly, he’s in some type of mental shock even though he’s the king of denial. When Tony pulls up close to his apartment building he looks over at Steve. He’s sleeping.
“No, no.” Tony grabbed his hand and placed it right on his nipple. “It’s hot as in sexy hot. Jesus you feel so good.”
“A soul pack is a group of people with a common cause,” Strange said. He inhaled, exhaled as if the entire meeting bored him. “It binds them together through – well, let’s just use souls. Bound together they are a unit, a living breathing unit.”
“Not long.”
It was all a foreign concept to Tony. He let the tears come but only because no one saw them. In the end, he knew he had only one course of action, only one way to deal with the universe’s cruel trick.
“None of this makes sense, but I get it,” Clint said and that didn’t clear up a damned thing.
That’s the question, isn’t it? Tony longs to tell him how much he enjoyed watching Steven work. How he’s proud of the omega. How being with Steven – Tony thinks just might make him a better person. Already he’s learned so much. He’s learned to question everything he holds dear.  If there’s one thing that Tony values is knowledge. The fact that Steven presents him with more information, makes him query the rights of society – that’s something wonderful and dangerous.
He can’t do this again. Never.
“But there are others who would,” Tony says. He pinches the bridge of his nose. “I’m tired. I’m going to bed.”
Tony had tried not to let it set off the fire, the need, the want but he failed. "I just want to be able to contact you. That's all." His voice sounded like a small mewl.
“Lord, Tony,” Steven had said and grabbed his arm. They were in the dining room but to the side as the dinner was breaking into smaller groups. The musicians had taken the stage and the light sounds of the orchestra playing filtered through the cooling summer night. The huge ballroom had more than twenty tables that sat ten people each. Waiters still whisked through the room with trays of finger desserts and after dinner wines and other drinks. Tony only sipped wine. Steven had given of his gland several times during the day. It had been invigorating but he could see the telltale signs of it wearing on his omega.
Tony holds his helmet and nods. “I think it’s a wonderful idea. Is there a drug store around?”
“He’ll be able to lead?”
“I suppose.” Tony chews on the hard mush, relishing it while the tears wet his eyes. He doesn’t know why every morning when he eats he cries, but he does. Yinsen sits next to him on the cot and grips his shoulder with one hand, his other holds his own bowl of oats. Every morning they go through this ritual. Every morning, Tony finds a way to survive the rest of the day.
He never hears any answer as he sinks down into the turbulent waters below the surface of his consciousness. He feels like he’s stuck in muck a great deal of the time. His breathing becomes hindered and he fights his way to the surface of the mud river in his fevered dreams. There are always pressures, hands on him, moving him, telling him it will be okay. But he doesn’t believe it.
Tony’s solid stone hand grasped his and he said, “Because I know a little about what loneliness is.”
“Now who’s talking ableist?” Steve says and Tony hears the swing of the door and then the clatter of plates and an old transistor radio playing in the background. “You get to decide what’s right for you and when. You taught me that, Tony.”
“Sorry.” He sets the chair next to Tony’s recliner, hits the switch to have the chair automatically go into the reclining position. “Let me take care of the headache, okay?”
“Please.” The invitation came from Ross.  He rubbed his chin as he studied Steve.
“I did. I mean, I do. I just wanted to find out if my father had anything to do with this search for immortality.” Tony placed the current volume he had clutched in his hands on the desk.
Richards eyes them and then nods. “I can share the recording of the call. I kept it on file because of the subject matter.”
Steve curled his arm tighter around Tony. “I know.”
Steve tosses some popcorn into his mouth. “Well, that’s good considering I almost fell asleep last night watching the first one.”
As the team rushed off, Sam glared at Steve. “You just want me to cart your ass over there.”
Before long, Tony’s had his second orgasm of the night with Steve swallowing down his come as they let the water cascade around them in the shower. They kiss for a while, easy and languid. Eventually they finish up the shower and tuck into Steve’s big bed.
Hill startled as if she understood the significant of not only the soul pack, but the position Sam held. It was the closest to the position of Beloved according to Wong. Hill accepted him immediately after Steve’s announcement.
Andersonville – a prison for Union soldiers – where death became a wished for reprieve.
“I could eat,” Thor said and smiled. He followed Steve into the large kitchen. The curved island in the center sectioned off the working part of the kitchen with the large entertainment space. The sheer scale of it measured larger than his apartment in DC; it dwarfed anything he lived in when he grew up.
Steve gritted his teeth and nodded. He wasn’t angry, not with Tony, but maybe with himself a little. “It’s okay. I’ll get over it.”
Obie stands up straight, tugs at his jacket and nods. “Of course, more than humans. But all the factions.”
“They may allow brothels on the station, but not everyone agrees with – oh do that again,” Steve moans and starts to climb onto Tony’s lap, but before he can Tony stops his exploration of his ass.
"Diversion."
The lift arrives. They stare at one another for a beat, then two. “You hurt me.”
“I never left it,” Steve says and tugs Clint into a short corridor to the side of the main access to the Honor Guard offices. “Listen, I need some help.”
Steve finds his boxers on the floor next to the bed, scoops them up, and manages to shimmy into them under the blanket. He gets out of bed. He hates that everything Tony does is under the microscope, more so than it used to be ever since the interview with Christine Everhart and her series. She’s been an ally but at the same time Tony’s biggest critic.
“I wish only a moment with the Captain,” T’Challa said.
She eyed him but said nothing about it. “Let’s move out.”
Steve wonders if he does. He wonders if that’s the key.
Jarvis peered into the box with the comic books and other cast offs from a childhood stolen. “I see you’re putting these away. Maybe someday your children will love them as much as you did.”
“You know nothing about me,” Tony spits back, stalks over to the bar, pours a glass of straight bourbon, and drinks it down. Slamming the tumbler onto the metal counter, he says, “You want to feel what it’s like to not be treated kindly. I can accommodate you on that one, omega. Close up. We’re going.”
“I can get you to the border,” Sam said.
“Don’t cut it off,” Bucky screams, spittle flying everywhere as he grapples to get to his knees.
The confirmation runs through Tony and he lays his head down on Steve’s chest to listen to his heart. “If we do this, then I want to tell you I’m committed. I know you probably read a lot about me. This is not a one night stand. I don’t do those anymore. That was another me, that was a me that’s been gone for years. Today, tonight, I’m with you and for as long as you’ll have me.”
“And what do you get from keeping us all trapped here with you?”
“No, no television,” Steve says because he doesn’t want to see Tony on the news even if it is only in passing. “No television and I need to be on the rack. I don’t even care about the bed. Just the rack and no kissing.”
Steve repeats, “I mean, who made the Ornari.”
The water is cool and refreshing – and clean. The first of it to splash upon his lips and his tongue tastes like sweet nectar. It’s too much as it flows and he gags and chokes. The hand on his shoulder strokes and rubs and pets him. Words are said and he’s told to rest.
“That’s big of you,” Tony said and he couldn’t keep the tiny bit of snark out of his response. Thankfully, Bruce ignored it or wasn’t aware enough of Tony’s character to identify when he wasn’t being sincere.
“Yeah, my thought exactly,” Bucky grumbled. “Where the fuck are we and why are you here? Whoever the hell you are.”
Aggravated and hating the dark that had become his day, Tony wrenched at the chains, but they wouldn’t give way. Twisting his wrists, he attempted to slide out of the shackles but that proved impossible as well. The door to his cell opened while he worked on the locking mechanism that had been cleverly concealed under the shackle.
He removes his hat and duster and hands them to Jarvis, who smiles and leads him into the parlor. The room is cozy and well appointed with a thick rug on the floor, chairs by the fireplace, and small table near the chairs. There’s a writing desk set by the window with a glass lamp on it. Tony is there, in a smoking jacket and dark silk pants, sitting in one of the cushioned chairs at the fireplace. He smiles when Steve arrives. “I missed you today” He stands and looks healthier, stronger than he has in the recent days.
“An illegal prison,” Nat said and threw the best snarl Fury that Tony had ever seen. “He was kept there to try and equilibrate his brain to the present. The memories of 65 years of freezing and being isolated, not being able to move overwhelmed him. He could barely talk at times.”
“I told you I’m no longer a Captain, it’s Sheriff, now.”
The collar whistles in reply and the electric shock runs through Steven. He stiffens and collapses as his muscles go rigid and his eyes open wide, but Tony knows, knows he’s blinded by the electric shock racing through his nerves, through his body. The collar constricts and only a gag and a gasp of air is allowed into Steven tormented body. Blood weeps from his ears, from his nose before the collar finally disengages.
Following him, Steve says, “Be careful. Tony!”
Tony barks out laughter and kisses Steve joyously. He breaks the kiss and then without taking his eyes off Steve, the prince whispers, “Exquisite.” He places his hand on either side of Steve’s face. “I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone quite like you, Steve Rogers. Where did you come from?” It’s not truly a question and Steve stays quiet and Tony thumbs his lower lip.
“Don’t say that.” Tony tossed the blade away, disrupting Steve’s touch.
“Not sure,” Jamison says. “I’m getting most of my intel from Natalie. She says he’s aligning with An’Rossi.”
“Yes. Lions can travel 6 miles to 30 miles a day.”
“Show, first position.”
As Tony drank down the thick blood, he experienced the energy of the serum through him. His veins answered it. When he mated with Steve for the first time, Tony never knew the qualities and benefits of blood laced with the super soldier serum. An immortal made superior in so many ways. Natasha had only smirked at him when he described it as feeling like he sat on the top of Mount Olympus. He became drunk with it, an addict for Steve and his blood. Their mating had been fast and quick, that first time.  Tony hadn’t even known Steve’s name, hadn’t known that he’d encountered the famous Captain America of World War II now one of the Captains of the V-Corps.
As the guards start assembling the manacles and snapping them on Steve, Tony grumbles but then looks up at him. Steve cocks a brow at him and Tony grins. It blossoms in Steve’s chest and he knows he shouldn’t grasp onto it so tightly. Once the arm manacles are locked in place, they lead Steve to the back of one of the SUVs. Tony helps him climb in where the guards continue their work. Steve’s firmly imprisoned in the SUV in short order.
Steve’s jittery the rest of the flight as he observes Tony. A shell, that all Steve can think. Tony’s a shell of himself. There’s no light in his eyes, he’s practically comatose but still moving around. He drinks when Steve offers him some orange juice. He chews methodically when Steve offers him some crackers, but he stays completely emotionless, flat, uncaring with no energy. It terrifies Steve. This isn’t Tony. This isn’t how he would want to live.
Shaking his head, Steve went to his suitcase and pulled out his track pants and a t-shirt. Surely the hotel had somewhere to workout.  Once dressed he found the work out room tucked next to an Olympic sized pool. Steve stared at the pool for a while, thinking maybe he should just swim instead, but part of him – a quiet part that people didn’t know – hated the water. He remembered the gagging, as the ocean burst into the Valkyrie and the rush of water like a freight train slamming into him. His breath turned fluid and he drowned as the ice of the water chilled his bones. With that in mind, he went to the work out room. He couldn’t hit punching bags because he would end up paying for the ruined ones. Instead he took to the weights and began his repetitions.
“So, we negotiate?” Tony says. His expression is thoughtful but agitated.
His mind clicks back into gear. “How reliable are your sources?”
“He’s resting. He lost a lot of blood but the serum’s making short work of that issue. The wounds are closing at an amazing rate. It shouldn’t be too long before he’s upgraded from critical.”
Bruce eyed him. “Eat something too. We’re meeting on the medical floor.”
Steve frowned but he couldn’t blame Tony for directing Happy to save his own hide in whatever means possible. “Let me go first.”
“Tony, please, what can I do?” Steve said, and the ache pulsed through the bond, an ache so deep and so powerful it took his breath away. “Please, Tony, you have to talk to me. I can’t help you. All I see are these pictures, these moving pictures that remind me of the silent movies back in the day. Explain to me what’s in your head. I can’t help yo-.”
“Did you hear me? I said your guest is what I can only describe as prowling in his room.”
As he opened his eyes he found himself in the small tenement apartment again. For the first time, he felt safe and at home. The place might have been cringe-worthy at one point in time because of all of the old-fashioned furniture, the lack of modern technology, but what he sought was here. Steve.
“Huh?” Tony says. Steve peers around the area looking for what’s amused him. He explains, “Five bedrooms, six Avengers. I wonder who was going to share in Natasha’s mind.” She’s the one who planned this whole teambuilding exercise. Sure, Fury insisted on it, but it was Natasha who worked out the details after the whole Ultron fiasco.
“Don’t I?” Steven says.
A thousand questions collide in Steve’s head about the family business, Loki’s knowledge, the scope of the poison, but he needs to focus down to the point. Natasha interrupts him with her darkened mood.
"Yes."
That was the future. All Tony knew as he watched Steve leave for Wakanda that blustery winter day was that he was loved and that he loved.
“Nothing worth it ever is.”
He shrugs it off and then taps the countertop. “You are allowed to eat.” It looks like his guest is partially comatose or playing with idea of going catatonic. “Steve.” Tony tilts his head to get a glimpse of Steve. “What’s going on?”
. That last moment he actually saw Bucky as he fell from the train etched a hole in his heart so deep and wide Steve never thought it would heal. But now he had a chance to – because he could apologize, talk to Bucky. As he focused on his old friend, something deep and profound in his eyes halted Steve. How could he waltz back into Bucky’s life and expect nothing to be changed? When he looked at how Natasha and Bucky interacted – it was intimate – a wash of embarrassment came over Steve.
“You said we need the implant to home the virotherapy to the target.” Tony’s interest is piqued, but he refuses to get his hopes up.
"Tony, what's going on?"
Blu licks his shoulder and side of his face.
“Have you thought about it, Steve. Maybe a garter? Maybe these?” Tony touches a pair of silky crotchless panties. He also picks up a harness that’s all made from silk as well. “I can just imagine you wearing these, under your uniform all day, today. Ready for me at any time. The silk brushing up against you, teasing you.”
For a terrible second, Tony thought he’d died but then a scream from the adjacent corridor brought him back to the reality of his situation. He saw the rise and fall of Steve’s chest. It gave him the energy to move, to run, to find safety. Towing the gurney, Tony raced to join Natasha and Clint, stopping at the intersection of the corridors. He peered around the corner to find that Natasha and Clint had easily dispatched a half dozen more agents, though Clint clearly had a bullet wound to the shoulder that would likely make it difficult to pull the bow and Natasha grew ashen. Tony spotted several hits of the wooden spikes to her abdomen.
“Summer and Winter,” Steve whispers and it feels like the air in his lungs lifts his away into the clouds. The boy is holding him and Steve knows he never wants him to let go. “James?”
“You want some beers? I got beers for $3 a can.”
As he veers through the atmosphere he determines that she’s right, Pepper is always right. He needs to straighten up and analyze what Stane has been doing, stop allowing the press and the pundits their day about his company, and transform his life. This is what he’s here for, not this endless search, not this hopelessness grown from nightmares.
As if it’s too much to accept, Tony wavers and Steve catches him, leading him to the massive bed. Before Tony responds to his insistent push to settle on the bed, he turns and shakes his head. “I didn’t expect. I didn’t use the nanites. I’m not prepped. I almost never use-.”
“The bond broke,” Natasha answered for them. “It’s complicated but the Russians have a method to strip soul bonds, or at least put them-.”
Steve withers inside at the words, his heart and mind at war with one another. He keeps a valiant effort up and returns the prince’s smile. “And you, my prince, you look wonderfully handsome as well.”
But maybe he hasn’t come to his senses – maybe he needs to profess the truth and be honest with himself and with Tony.  He cannot stand the forlorn look on Tony’s face.
The words made no sense at all to Steve. Like pellets of hail they hit him, stinging and bruising. He wanted to close his eyes to the onslaught, but he remained firm fighting the fear. “What?” he said and looked around her. “Who?”
“I didn’t know,” Steve said and looked down at his battered body. “I didn’t.” He should have and that’s a fault in his leadership.
They both jump up and go to the fighter pods of the ship.  He jumps to the pod as Sam hits the other one. Bucky wishes he could go and check on Steve but they have no time. The ship rocks under the heavy fire and Bucky straps into the seat. With one arm in agony, it will take all of his skill to help out. But he doesn’t complain – how can he when Steve is in such dire straits?
He wants Steve to be his, only his. And this is the way to do it. He’s breaking down walls and limits and he doesn’t care as he caresses and gives and enters Steve. As they come together in some shuddering embrace with Steve’s legs grappling around him and Tony clutching his arms. It’s more than he hoped for that night so many months ago when he picked up a hooker looking for a good time. He loses all sense of self and falls into Steve, fucking and pounding until they are both crying out, until he blanks as his vision whites out and his breath is stolen from his lungs.
The Silver Knight looks between Frigga and the Red Knight. Frigga only smiles and goes back to the basin. She starts pull out vegetables from the wash bin to chop.
“That’s playing into his hand,” Steve says and leans against the cold concrete wall. “Soviet missile silo indicates Natasha, but so far nothing about her from what you searched?”
“Divini?” The sure as hell sounded like god to him. It made no sense. It was also a little presumptuous of them – considering the name. The thing inside of him, the cancer growing to consume the rest of his energy shuddered at the name, as if it understood the consequences. He couldn’t understand this dichotomy within his thoughts, he couldn’t control it. “Just what the hell are you talking about?” The anger and fear welled up inside of him. What happened to Tony? What the hell was happening to him? “What happened to Tony? What aren’t you telling me?”
Steve narrows his eyes as he focuses on the barrage of data scrolling over the virtual graphics. He stops on the scan and hits the key to pause it. “No, I won’t, I can’t.”
She smiles. “After death? After death comes many things. May we all find out.” She leans up and kisses his cheek. “Now go. There’s no delaying it.”
“Burgers, fries, shakes,” Tony said. “I know a guy.” He went right to work, that way Steve wouldn’t be able to stop him. He knew the management at the hotel and all he had to do was click his fingers and he plus his guests would get anything they desired and ordered. He listed everything he wanted and asked that all of the order be sent to his room in less than 30 minutes. Once off the phone he turned and smiled to Steve. “See? That’s how it’s done.”
He’d listened enraptured by the story of Captain America and his Howling Commandos along with Peggy Carter and her vampire coven. It helped him not be afraid, but it hadn’t changed his view of vampires until he transformed into one himself. A decade ago. A long time for a human but a blink of an eye for him. He’d been lucky to mate with Steve. As long as he didn’t sustain a life threatening wound, Steve would be with Tony for a long time.
He’s staring up at the ceiling and can’t move. He thinks he might be remembering something that he heard or something he read once. “I don’t know what you mean about a prime pairing.”
“Steve,” Natasha said and then she knelt in front of him, her hand on his knee. “She’s always part of us. Her link may be gone but you can feel her presence still. She helped you accept this world. Don’t make light of that. It was important.”
“Bruce isn’t feeling well,” Tony said. “The stress doesn’t help him much.” Tony stroked his hand down Steve’s arm. Even with the tinted windows, Steve spotted the weakness in Tony’s motions, the way he leaned against Steve.
His mind, his heart leans toward a gentle softness for Tony. There’s no lie in that fact. For years now he’s watched Tony’s life from afar, knowing all too well that he would only always be an outside player. Someone Tony worked with – and oh how that stung. He longed for the few days he spent with Tony going over the teams’ abilities, the financials, the strategies. Late into the night they would work. Every now and again, he’d find himself drifting into a fantasy where they were together working as a team – partners in life. He’d imagine reaching over and grabbing Tony’s hand. Or better yet when Tony ambled over for his fourth cup of coffee, Steve followed him and came up behind to wrap his arms around him in an embrace – that would lead to more. But then he would snap out of it and realize that was all a pipe dream.
“Well, at least he ate something,” Pepper says and waves for Steve to follow him.
Pepper and Rhodes break their conversation and rejoin them. Pepper nods to Happy. “Can you give us a minute?”
“And you’re still the same sick bastard I met six years ago.” The memories of the rooftop crucifixes hit him, and he nearly let out a cry for Tony. How many times had he gone up to the rooftop over the years? He’d worked with Fury to release as many of the innocent vampires he’d could from the crosses. He secreted them away. There had been failures over the years and times he couldn’t save all of them and he still hated himself for those he lost, but he’d tried.
Steve reads it easily enough. Tony’s worried about the deal with Secretary Ross. Testing Tony about the details is off limits. On the other hand, there’s Natasha. Steve shares a look with her, but she keeps her expression frozen, solid and strong. There’s a reason she’s a top ranked assassin and spy. Steve shifts away to gaze out the window the plane.
“Is it this?” Steve says and sniffles because it is cold and his whole body shivers against the wind as it hits him full force. He tumbles down to the ground next to Tony and sets the battery to the side. “Wires? Do I need wires?” He needs something to connect it up but then Tony’s hand flails and grasps onto Steve’s coat.
The dark Outriders surround him as he pulls his sword free and tightens his hand around his shield. Dozens circle him. He spins on his heels, making sure to jab and parry at the demons. They swipe and hit at him. Some of their claws fall true, ripping his shoulders, slicing at his legs. His chest plate protects him, but he’ going to fall. He knows it. He has but one choice.
Tony cries out.
Ross continued as if the researcher hadn’t spoken at all. “Let’s get the show on the road.”
Tony should take solace in these words. Steven is committed. He doesn’t seem as if he’s willing to shun his duty or even do a poor job. His caring touch says things to him that Tony must be misinterpreting. Steven leads Tony out of the shower and wraps in him a towel. Leading him out of the bathroom, Steven brings him to the bed. He dries Tony and then pulls down the linens. With a gentle touch, Steven gets Tony to lie down and he tucks the blankets around him.
"Captain," Coulson says with his hands folded in front of him. "You're name is Steve Rogers."
“You’re too proud of your work,” Natasha says and then whispers something that just might be an endearment. It’s shocking and odd. After all this is Ultron playing against himself.
“A little more about your position. I mean I don’t want details, but it seems to me that you really don’t want to be here. I mean no disrespect,” Tony says.
So true and so beautiful. A purity, it did not deserve.
It’s something that the team discussed prior to the mission. Cho expressed concerns, pointing to the weaknesses in the cradle technology, psychological stress factors, and how the reaction of the interface worked. Tony stayed stone cold silent on the matter. It indicated that Cho hit on something worrisome, but they proceeded anyway.
“Twenty percent,” Tony says and slumps down in a chair. He pushes his fingers under his glasses and into his sightless eyes. His voice is mumbled, and Steve feels the heartache, the pain, and the promise all wrapped into it. “That’s all. I could gain some of my sight back or nothing and have to live like this.” He pulls off his glasses. “I can’t do it, Strange. I can’t.”
Tony does and at the same time Steve pushes forward again. He’s over the ring of muscle and then gliding in. Tony huffs out a breath as Steve tells him to keep breathing. It’s too much. The thickness and weight, filling him. The sensation throws him, a wild and untamable feeling. It’s rushing through him, his blood pounds in his ears and all he can think is how much his body burns with it, how much more he wants, and then Steve’s buried deep inside him. All the way. Tony hears something, incoherent and embarrassingly perverse. It’s Tony – the noises of want and desire fill him.
“Okay.” Steve follows him and does the same with his hand. The door unlocks.
“Buck. It’s different now. Please, listen to me. It’s not about me.”
Steve smirks. "I have a feeling you are no tenderfoot, sir."
Tony froze. His eyes grew large and he stared at Steve. “What?”
“JARVIS called me, said you were having a crisis,” Bruce said. “You looked like you were sleeping. Is that a crisis? It might be considering how you don’t sleep, so you’re having a crisis. Are you?”
“Eat.” Logan places his half-devoured burger on the tray table and reaches for his shake. “I’m here to tell you something, Steve. Something important.”
“So it is real? I will believe it when I see it,” Steve says and then clicks at Shield to stop her from munching as they trot along the rocky plain. “But tell me about this new invention? This personal locomotive?”
Tony claps his hands when they are left alone and grins at Steve. “You are adorable.”
Now he was just dopey with it. Tony rolled his eyes. “Stop being adorable.” Tony jumped out of bed, pulled on a bathrobe – his father’s old one – and headed to the door.
“So, you’ve had these dreams for a while?”
“Huh?” he says and frowns at Tony, that little furrow appearing between his brows. “What?”
Tony stopped at the door to the laboratory, his hand on the door. “I’m getting an idea.”
"Yes, Captain, you can leave," Coulson says and with that announcement a woman with dark hair tied in a neat bun, a dark suit, and startling blue eyes walks in. She's carrying a shopping bag. She hands it to Coulson. "We took the liberty of getting you some clothes."
“Because otherwise you were a pervert,” Tony said, and he admitted bitterness laced his words. Shit, they’d just made love and here Tony was stuck in the same fucking place.
The night had been everything Tony wanted it to be. The fact he started entertaining romantic thoughts about his omega bothered him. But he’d never had a warrior before. This was the first time he bonded after all. He’d always had drones but this was different. They had a bond and a companionship. He told himself he could draw the line, that he knew the division between their relationship. He kept telling himself that – as they ate dinner and Steven told him stories.
He scoffs but Pep literally stamps her high heeled foot. “Okay, okay.” He turns to the wall that holds the interface. The black screen gives no indication it is on. “Purpose to fall deeply and devotedly in love with a warrior omega, get bonded, and then rule the universe.”
The intensity of his gaze, of his expression drowns Tony in a flood of anguish. How could anyone love someone so deeply, so powerfully that it would imprint as if it molded his very soul? It couldn’t be that. Tony is a man of science. The bond isn’t two souls entwined. It is a simple biochemical reaction. “The bond is broken.” Those words are inadequate, but it is all that Tony has to offer.
“Aw, you almost sounded modern, Cap,” Clint said with a laugh. Sam joined in.
Tony glances up at the darkening sky. Even out here in the middle of nowhere Stark technologies and its satellites don’t fail him. “Well, tell Pepper I’m fine. Everything is fine.”
The busy street below thrives with life, the honk of traffic, the drone of voices. Steve will miss it, but he tries not to brood about it too much as he tapes up another box. He doesn’t own too much, but it surprisingly takes up a lot of boxes. More than he reckoned. He’ll need to go back down to the grocer and see if he can get a few more boxes. Leaving the city hadn’t been his plan, but Bucky and Sam were right. There’s not a lot left here and he has a tidy sum in his bank account. As an artist he can work anywhere. Sure, New York City possesses one of the healthiest and strongest art communities in the world. Just look at the gala at the Maria Stark Foundation if anyone doubts that statement. Millions donated each year for young artists. It’s a dream for some, but for Steve it’s only a nightmare. Leaving the city and packing his life away in a storage container is the way to go. He’s going to stop off and see Bucky and Sam in D.C. before he leaves and then he’s going to wander on his motorcycle for a while. Just see the country. Maybe find inspiration in the landscape and the people. He needs something to pull him out of the funk.
“Captain, I am sorry to bother you, but you do have a visitor,” JARVIS said.
“Oh lord, oh fuck,” Tony says and sits on the closed toilet, and wraps his arm around those massive shoulders.
“But you’ll do the experiments to verify it?” Steve asks. It sounds like the words hurt him to say.
“You want peace.”
“I had a date.”
They’d come so close to finding a way out of the mess, so close. But then Tony called Wanda a weapon of mass destruction. And Steve had gotten so angry. Then Tony said it and it ripped Steve apart.
He's not sure what she means and knows he's too far in over his head to argue, so he takes Steve by the shirt and drags him along. If he is the original Captain America then what just happened to him must have jarred him royally. He's not functioning on all cylinders. But Steve follows him and when Tony chances a backward glance he finds Steve trying to mentally catch up. There’s a lost look in his eyes, and it recalls images of Steve as a young man, thin, sickly – Tony saw those photographs. He knows them as the beat of his heart.
Steve swiped the hologram away with one arm and then pulled on his fingerless gloves. “I did it before on the Helicarrier. Don’t think I can’t do it here.” He closed the conversation off and both Maria and Natasha shared a look before considering Tony. He put his hands up as Steve walked to the front of the Quin Jet. Tony followed him.
“As simple, my lord?” Steven asks as he opens the door from his bedroom for Tony. They continue down the long curved hallway. His estate mansion or some would call it a palace, has modern design mixed with a touch of old Earth. Art scavenged from the old world decorates the walls. The floor is a high polished white marble with blue veins. The large windows welcome the manicured gardens of the estate.
“It is,” Steve said. As if reading his mind – and maybe he did – Steve added, “Don’t think this has anything to do with you, Tony. My own failings here are mine. It takes time to wipe away thought patterns and habits.”
“Good. Makes you feel cheap,” Bucky comments.
Steve furrows his brows. “You brought a backpack?”
“Me? There wasn’t an attempt on my life, Happy.” Steve dismisses Happy’s concern with a pat on his arm. “It’s something we have to deal with as Escorts all the time.”
I promised a summary of the first two stories in this chapter. You will find it within the first two pages of the chapter.
“There is no need for you to worry about such things,” he says and then Steve feels him stand up, the weight of the bed shifting. He walks away and then returns with more warm clothes to clean Steve. “What would you like for our last time?”
“Over the city, they’re not going to attack us,” Clint said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s your shield! You love that like a baby!” Tony needs to clean out his ears, because he cannot fathom what he’s hearing.
“And not when the weight of so many souls you’ve confined here for so long possess the power to move on and leave this place. Even you with your pathetic plots and plans cannot stop the possibilities of life and love.” Steve sees the flicker of light beyond the Red Skull. A singularity of light, calling to the souls. “It’s your one chance to do what’s right, Schmidt, and let us move on. Let us pass through.”
“When I was a boy,” the prince says. “My father told me that as a royal, people were made to be at my beck and call. They were to do as I said and what I said. Never to question anything. They were there as my toys to do with as I please. Pawns in the game.” Tony searches Steve’s features. “And yet, here you are telling me off about Brooklyn and the war, changing my schedule for the better, and driving me to have the chef spend the better part of the afternoon working on making mock-cherries.”
If he needs to tear away the wall with his bare hands he will. “What does that mean; not really?” He picks up his shirt and shoves it into Blu- no Steve – as in Steve Rogers’ hands. “Put this one, at least.” When Steve tries to struggle into the shirt, Tony stops him. “Down below, unless you want your dick to get sunburnt.”
“We don’t have a choice.” Tony hits the arc reactor and the entire armor drains into his chest plate and then into small circle of light. Steve yanks off his backpack and gives Tony his jacket.
“I won’t suggest that, Young One.” Thor surveyed the dark forest. His eyes looked feral, wild, almost crazy with need. “I have gone for many years without a human mate, many times over. I know how it feels to lose one and to gain one.”
Tony yawns again. He probably didn’t get enough sleep last night. He pushes himself up to sit and Steve leans over and fluffs his pillows. “What time is it?”
Tony hung his head. He pressed his hands into his eyes and said in a low voice almost to himself, “I get it now. I understand.”
“Come on, Hawk,” Natasha beckons as she picks up the bowl with the spent and bloody rags and bullet fragments. She moves past him into the hallway. “And I would be careful calling Loki a fool, that man is liable to mix up some of his special remedies to put in the town water. Or worse have you lapping at his heels like a dog in heat.”
“We both did.”
A sharp intake of breath and then a more subtle release. “Nothing. I just don’t want to overstep my boundaries. I understand I’m your employee.”
Steve laughs. “I can’t believe Tony Stark just admitted that I outsmarted him.”
He snickers but demolishes another group of terrorists as he briefly gets stuck in a recess of the tunnel. Finally he clears it and trudges his way toward the opening, only to find a stacks of his own weapons loaded in the front of the tunnel and to the back, a crumpled form.
“What does it mean to be in love for anyone? Just because we’re this strange new thing, doesn’t mean we’re not us,” Tony whispered and bent closer to Steve, awaiting his signal.
“Steve said something,” Natasha answers. “He said Tony would like it.”
“I don’t know?” Steve said as he poured the coffee.
Steve steams as they get to the elevator and take it to the outer ring. They head toward the dock and only then he realizes they have no guards to protect them. He stops, paralyzed before Tony pulls him onward toward the dock and the ship.
“And Clint is okay?” Steve asked again. He felt like he wasn’t processing.
The omega only nods and closes his eyes.
“The twins,” Steve said and waited as if Tony should come to the same logical conclusion. When Tony stood there staring blankly at him, Steve relented. “Bucky must be in Europe. Don’t ask me how he got there but I’m getting a kind of old familiarity from him. Like he knows the places he’s hanging out, like he’s trying to find himself through walking places in his past.” He shrugged. “I’m not sure. But that’s what I’m getting. I think he feels the twins, more so than he does us. They’re on the same wavelength as he is. Fashioned by Hydra, but not bad. They aren’t bad people. I think he’s there to get them out. Same as us.”
Steve shakes his head. “No. I had to pay off mom’s medical expenses after she died. There were a lot of bills.”
“Are you a high-priced prostitute, Stevie? Because we didn’t raise you that way,” Bucky says.
“Move, please.”
“Of course we did with Cho’s cradle and my tinkering, we put together one supped up virtual reality interface.” Tony shifts away and Steve feels a loss he cannot parse. “Can you stand? I’d like to get out of the open, since we don’t exactly know where we are.”
I did want to point out that because of the low traffic on long plotty Stony stories from me, I will probably stop writing WIPs for Stony completely after I finish this story and Code. Unless IW really inspires me, I cannot see trying to fit into my busy schedule long complicated stories with intricate plots and world building that are not of interest to the vast majority of the Stony readers. I don't know what happened to my readers, perhaps it is how the fandom split after CW or maybe the fandom only wants the same tropes over again. I don't know. I have limited time writing so I have to plan for the future based on the evidence of the here and now. I'm sorry to see what's happened to the Stony fandom. I will always love Steve and Tony together, but like I said unless I see something inspiring in IW. These two stories will be my last multiple chapter stories for Stony.
“Unfortunately, the Murray sisters don’t have a brother,” Steve replied and tapped the bar. The bartender responded by refilling their drinks.
“Captain Rogers,” Tony said. The name didn’t draw his attention.
“Yes, I thought we did this already.”
Rumlow put his hand on Steve’s shoulder and said, “On your knees, Captain.”
Tony peers into the bathroom, not inviting himself into the room proper. “Breakfast is here.”
Pressing his hands along the outside of the jacket, Tony smooths it down. “Ready?”
Natasha takes in a deep breath and then releases it. “The client is Prince Anthony Stark. He’s coming to Prime for a conference on the state of the war. He’s requested an Escort for the entire time he’s at the station.”
“He’s waiting.” Steve says and feels the shock of pain in his gut. “He’s waiting for me to fall. He wants to meet you alone, Tony. He doesn’t want me to be there.” Truth be told, Steve’s not sure he’ll be able to make it. The darkened corridor descends farther into blackness and his vision pixelates like it did when he first entered the virtual world. “He’s changed the rules.” He peels back the jacket of the uniform. The nearly healed wound is open, bloody, and oozing pus. “He tried to get me out of the picture before. He wants you alone.”
That had to be the most Tony ever heard Bruce speak outside of talking about particle physics or Hulk related biology. Tony hung his head and sighed. “I’m not what he thinks I am.”
“No,” Tony says because he knows, he knows deep and true that Steve is not some made up figment of his imagination. Steve is real, flesh and blood and Tony feels his breath in the pit of his soul. It struggles and grapples as if it might be the last. Tony cannot give up now, not now, not when he knows this might be the last time he can search for his lost soul.
“Even worse?” Vision is sitting close to Wanda. He’s projecting his ‘human’ image. Steve’s noticed that Wanda always orbits him. Or he always revolves around her. It’s logical – they’re connected in a metaphysical dance.
“Do you think that’s wise?” Steve asks and sets the sketchbook on the table next to the couch.
“What a fucking lousy thing to do,” Tony huffed.
“I doubt you would understand-.”
She closes the space between them and reaches out, extending her hand to him. He waits a moment before accepting it. He’d been resigned to the idea that he might never be her friend, her teammate again, especially after her words in Berlin. She sided with Tony, she went with the Accords. For some reason, she wanted to take the path of least resistance, and he could respect that in some ways. She wanted to keep the team together because the team was the only family she’d ever had. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t see releasing control over his own destiny, over his decision about what is good and what is bad to an organization that refused to prove itself, refused to layer in safeguards. He couldn’t do it, so he lost her.
Bucky taps his ear comm and says, “Redwing found him, I think. Stand by.”
“It’s actually the only way. If we meet him where he’s vulnerable, then we have a chance. Otherwise it’s like a game of whack a mole.”
Tony dives into the stew which consists of a lot of root vegetables and a few scattered pieces of mystery meat. He doesn’t care his stomach rumbles at him in protest for having abandoned it for so long.
“No,” Tony said, his voice firm. Steve swallowed down his fear, his uncertainty. “No, you don’t get to do that if I don’t. Neither of us is to blame. Those fuckers are!” Tony had pulled away as he spoke. “What they did, we can’t let it defeat us. We can’t let them defeat us. We don’t have much to work with here, I know, but if we give up, if we surrender.”
Tony grins and bows his head. “Your breathing always accelerates when you’re excited.”
“Good God, man,” Tony says and seizes Steve up from his ministrations. He pummels Steve’s mouth and then Steve shares the pre-come taste with Tony. “We need the oil.”
“What's that?”
“Yes, why would you ask?” Steve says.
“Maybe, maybe not,” Steve responded. “I mean, we aren’t from the same background at all, but we both want to do good.”
Tony licked his lips and nodded. “I know.” He looked around the pale room. The bed with the broken head board, the lamp without a shade, the tacked up wooden planks on the windows – how he wanted desperately to spend time with Steve at his hidden house far from madness of the city. Away from the vampire district as it shrank with each and every new rule and law the humans put into place. He wanted to offer everything to Steve, but what he had, the laws made him conceal.
Leave it to Bucky to make Steve feel like that skinny kid from the Rims all those years ago. Natasha glares at him, but offers him space to explain himself.
Tony gambled then. He took a chance. He stood up and Steve went back only a footstep to allow him room. Seeking, Tony said, “Then how about this?” He reached up and gently brought Steve into his arms. He didn’t try kissing, he wasn’t going to go that far – at least that wasn’t his intention. He felt the stiffness of Steve in his arms, but slowly Steve brought his arms up to encompass Tony. They stood there like that for a few minutes as Tony counted the muscles in Steve’s back giving way, as he relaxed and laid his cheek against Tony’s temple. Even Tony eased his weariness, his tension. Their souls resonated through the bond and it was right. Tony felt the tangle of souls that had knotted and now relaxed.
He looks up at the screen – at the headshots of the men. He could go to Sam, ask Sam to do this for him. But he can’t. Because he still admits to himself he has hopes. If Steve entangles Sam into this whole mess, then how will he ever get Tony to be with him again? So he has to go to a nameless person. Someone to hurt him, and knot him, and not kiss him and not touch him in any pleasurable way. This is a biological urge and that’s all. When he first when through presentation, Tony explained it as simple as the need to eat, piss, or shit. He has to keep that in mind.
