The arms holding him tighten when he shifts slightly, the memories making his skin crawl, Steve’s probably awake, waiting for Tony to drop off. It won’t happen yet, almost every night for months he’s jerked awake, trembling and freezing.
make it right. Together.”
Tony’s not even surprised Rhodey’s sniffed him out.
Now he was back in his workshop at the compound and feeling more confused than before.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony spins around to face him, “That’s different and you know it! This…this feels way worse.”
Tony narrows his eyes at the last one, he really,
Steve has the decency to look a little sheepish, the tiniest hint of a blush sitting high on his cheekbones. “It’s hot,” he eventually says, with a shrug in his voice.
But then Tony’s asking, “So what are our options then? There has to be some way to counter all of the damage.”
Lifting up the gauze, Tony’s ensured that Bucky’s healing has completely clotted both wounds and he can let up on the pressure now.
Tony’s choked “They’re gone,” was enough for Steve to understand why.
But not before thoroughly kissing Tony Stark goodnight on his front step. He’s not a heathen.
Steve sounds somber, and Tony feels a twitch in his chest.
It didn’t last long, but Steve kept coming around, kept checking up on him, being so fucking earnest in that special way only Steve has. But, Tony was suspicious, sent Pepper to shoo him away with fake excuses.
His anger roars back to life again, and Tony’s crossing the room to grab the shitty flip phone that’s been mocking him for weeks.
Tony’s pissed that she’s right, “What am I supposed to do? Let them all pile on the jet and take them back home with us?”
Okay, this is getting real, either someone else is fighting these guys for fun, or Steve and whoever are merely floors apart from them.
“Would never dream of it babe,” Bucky responds, with a kiss on Tony’s cheek.
to get to Tony, even if it kills him in the process.
“Hungry?”
He can’t do this shit anymore.
Tony casts a smile at Natasha, “Vision did it, Ross should be making an emergency u-turn right about now.”
And god, Steve really has, their lives are always busy, and no one on the team ever has the time to really catch their breath, but on his rare days off, the hurt of missing Tony and wanting to spend as much time as he can with him is particularly frustrating and painful. Steve yearns for more time with him, wants it more than he knows how to put into words.
The next half hour is spent batting away Tony’s surprisingly quick hands from eating too much raw dough, and once again dealing with a mishap of some billowing flour covering Steve’s apron and Tony’s once black t-shirt, before their cookies are securely baking in the oven.
Steve’s talking before he realizes it, “Tony?”
He connects the call.
3000 words later i made it out alive
Who’s he kidding, there was never a choice.
He can hear his heart pounding in his ears.
“Was there really any doubt?” he replies, one eyebrow cocked playfully, stepping up to Steve again, to grab his hand and pull him back into their shared space. “You got a name, footloose?”
Tony’s watching Rhodey take a few laps around the room, already noting down in his head a few adjustments.
They both sit on Steve’s bed, and he makes Steve lean back against the wall so Tony can straddle his lap. His nerves try to swarm up in his stomach, but he nips them down quickly. Steve would never judge him, at least not
[12:12 P.M.]
“I really thought you were joking about this,” Natasha snarks from her slouched position on the couch.
Tony spins around from his place at the kitchen counter, awaiting his first cup of liquid gold of the day.
Like all things in his life, they met with an explosion.
“M’gonna wash your hair Bucky, close your eyes,” Steve says as he wets and lathers up Bucky’s hair.
Blinking several times, his vision mostly clears and he sees one of Ross’ men out cold on the floor. His glasses are done for, as they cracked on the impact and are now pathetically tossed aside on the floor.
The new suit is captivating and Steve had to fully remind himself to get it together when walking off the ship onto the deserted planet.
That makes Tony stop his typing, and bite his lip. Will he? He’s not sure and he doesn’t even know if its repairable at this point.
"Thanos came to the universe for the stone, I am here to merely guide others to it."
She’s still standing in her spot at the kitchen island, poised and ready to strike.
Tony thinks back to what Rhodey and he had discussed, about him cutting off his automatic defense wall he throws up around Steve. Not everything is a jab.
Tony frowns for a second at the weird reply, but then Steve’s turning away and taking a trip back to the break room, emerging a second later with two bottles of water in hand. Tony shrugs it off and says his thanks as he grabs hold of the condensation slick bottle, taking a long drag. He can feel Steve’s eyes on him, but the water is so refreshing on his dry throat, he doesn’t think much about it.
Who knows, the all-night distraction may very well just lead to a breakthrough in the ten-foot wall art block in his mind, that’s keeping him from finding the perfect pose to complete his portfolio. There’s nothing like a night of dancing to get your brain to shake itself loose.
But it’s half past three in the morning and he’s feeling a little reckless.
Goddamn Rogers and his relentless “I can do this all day” bullshit.
“You saying that you don’t want to make me angry, makes me angry.”
Fresh air has never been so good.
They walk over to Tony, sitting down on either side of him.
[9:25 A.M.]
Steve laughs and goes to put away her food in it’s rightful place, and Tony just decides to spit it out already.
To pull himself out of the pitch black empty space that yearns to swallow him whole. The place where he can’t seem to catch his breath.
It’s funny now, that Tony thought in any way, shape, or form would that keep Steve at bay.
Nebula finally speaks again, “We lost the time stone on Titan.”
She smirks back at him, “It was Loki’s idea, I just came to watch the train wreck in action.”
Tony immediately perks up, climbing off the bed and over to Steve, both of them facing Bucky’s side of the room.
Bruce and Natasha join them, and Steve watches as they all check him over, none of them mention how Tony trembles in their arms.
He should have tried harder, but it probably wouldn’t have been any use anyways.
, and Tony feels himself fall a little more in love.
He offers it out to Tony who quickly splits it in half, a couple gooey chocolate strings pulling away from the piece still in Steve’s hand. Tony has no hesitation in shoving it into his mouth, chewing blissfully.
No one says a word as they race down six flights of stairs, and out of the back of the building.
Tony turns his head to the sound, Rhodey sitting to his right, in a hospital acquired wheelchair. He swallows down the guilt that crawls up his throat looking at the man next to him, the memory of watching his best friend fall helplessly to the ground, in a suit that he made. Steeling himself, Tony pushes down the ache in his chest and flashes his signature smirk.
Bruce is asking him to get over to the Avengers compound with the team as soon as he can, and Steve can only roughly reply, “We’ll be there,” before letting the call end.
They finished off the blunt and have flopped over to lay down facing each other on Steve’s bed.
Using the gauze from the first aid kit, Tony cuts some up and applies pressure to the wounds, willing Bucky’s healing to clot his blood faster. He brings his other hand up to press down onto Bucky’s groin, hoping that pressure on both the wound and a major artery will stop Bucky from bleeding so profusely.
Tony’s headed to the scene now where he’ll meet up with Vision and Natasha to make a game plan.
Tony fumbles forward and trips to the floor, the shield falls with him and the noise it makes sends a tremor down his spine.
Tony just sighs and cuddles in closer to them both before Steve then gets up to actually order them some food, and Bucky makes Tony lay down with him, the exhaustion and blood loss finally catching up to him.
Steve hangs up and he’s left standing in his empty workshop.
The high is at its peak now, and they’re both huffing into each other’s mouth with the intensity of their kissing.
, even when he was screaming the opposite, red faced and teary eyed. He didn’t make the prettiest picture but there Steve still stood, ready to deal with anything Tony needed him to.
Tony feels dizzy. And so completely lost.
“Care for another dance, Tony?” Steve asks forwardly, and they begin to move together again, settling into their earlier groove now that they’ve successfully sussed each other out. The crowd seems to give them space of their own, or maybe Steve’s just so absolutely focused on not tripping over his own feet to impress Tony now, that everything around them dims down to a muted hum in the background.
Before Tony can ask what’s spurred this on, Steve’s fingertips are gently but firmly, titling Tony’s head up so their lips are just centimeters from brushing together, Steve’s blue eyes stuck on his, the palpable hunger rising in them.
[11:10 P.M.]
Judging by the way Steve eye’s light up, he would very much like to do so.
“Good Afternoon, Sir.” FRIDAY greets him as he enters the workshop. He hasn’t been back here since before the mess of the accords, and everything is exactly where he’s left it. How can he feel so changed and yet nothing is different at all?
Tony moans from deep within his chest, he could spend forever here with Steve, in the half dark room, together and high, feeling the best he has all week.
His fingertips barely touch the cold surface when he’s thrown back into a memory.
“…Tony? Can you hear me?”
The Avengers gets called in on a mission, drama ensues.
As he makes it to the end of the hall, his peripheral vision catches one of the doors slamming shut, bingo.
Oh, now Steve sounds frustrated. Welcome to the fucking club.
Steve laughs and tucks his head down shyly, “I didn’t want to scare you off, all those times I asked you if you wanted to go for a run at the stadium, you looked at me like I told you that your cheese fridge had just been stolen, figured you’d come to me at your own pace.”
Steve’s not opposed to any creative, out of the box methods at this point.
Tony wants to get lost in this feeling.
Tony can feel his adrenaline spiking, but they must be careful about this, the last thing he needs is to be seen breaking the accords and letting Ross know they’ve caught him out.
“So, are you gonna let him?”
There’s a hot bead of sweat slowly crawling down the back of Tony’s neck, the clock ticks ahead a minute, and he breathes out a deep sigh while flipping another page of the magazine he’s been fake reading for the past hour.
Natasha glances around them before coming in closer, “I don’t know, but I’m going to find out. Ross was pissed, he wanted to keep you in medical until you woke up, but I convinced him you wouldn’t be much help with a concussion.”
Tony would know that brick like physique anyway, not that he’d admit that. He’s honestly not entirely sure if he’s dreaming this or not. Does he remember waking up this morning?
sorry if this gets too jokey at times, i can't resist when it comes to rhodey/tony scenes
“No Steve,
“What happened on Titan, Tony?”
The memory is frayed and fuzzy after all these years, but Tony remembers it was around the 35-day mark of his kidnapping and Yinsen had suggested a moment of meditation. He remembers laughing, Tony’s life had always been non-stop high energy since he could remember, when had he ever had time for something like meditating. But Yinsen eventually convinced him over a cup of tea, that was tasting less and less like dirt every passing day.
“There’s 2 bodies around the corner, seem to be taking a mid afternoon nap, I guess we’re not alone.”
Steve ignores that perfectly accurate observation and walks over, settling beside Tony at the cash register, “How’re we doing today?”
Tony runs his hands through his hair, taking a deep breath to recover from his honest to god near heart attack.
He can smell the rust from the blood Steve’s covered in, his stomach turns and he has to grind his teeth, and swallow multiple times, to get a hold on himself.
All the anger he had a minute ago disappeared, and Tony’s left with a pounding headache.
Tony finally notices their back on the jet home, a blanket draped across him. He’s got one hell of a headache and he’s grateful for the pills and water Natasha hands him.
Fuck all logic and reasoning, he’s a man with a plan as he fills a glass with the amber liquid. Only breathing clearly after the first gulp.
He’s so lost in his head for awhile, Tony doesn’t hear the bath drain and Steve and Bucky walking back into the room.
Sometime later, Bucky walks into his shared dorm with Steve, and he’s met with the sight of both Steve and Tony snoring against the same pillow, his candy and the roach of one of his blunts sitting next to them.
Natasha snorts from across the kitchen island, “You add cinnamon to
“What? —Yeah, I’m fine, just tired,” Tony replies, he can see that Steve has wrapped up Bucky’s thigh and they’re both now dry and clean.
Tony decides he gets to lose some prefixes off that title of his right about now.
Nightmares, black holes, and aliens be damned, Tony still had Steve's arms to crawl into every night, and no matter what, Steve didn’t leave.
The nerves are starting to kick in now, and Tony wishes he had a suit with him. There’s one waiting back on the jet for him, but with what they’re doing here, it would receive unwanted attention.
He had warned them all, Steve especially. Now he’s putting his ass on the line, and he’s deeply regretting agreeing to this already.
Steve had politely but forcefully insisted to come back to the lab with Tony, to say goodnight to Octavia. Tony didn’t waste energy pretending like he minded at all, and they had just made it to the door when they heard a crash from inside
FRIDAY puts the call through, “Stark! We’ve got a situation; Avengers are a go.”
“I can hear you breathing Tony.”
It scared the shit out of Tony, he doesn’t know how to have conversations without sass and snide comments, words are his only defense when he’s not in the suit.
Tony sighs and finally looks Steve in the eyes. Steve is struck by how much he missed Tony, being back in his presence despite the lousy circumstances, has reminded him of how captivating Tony is. How he can display so much in just one look.
Then he remembers the night before and shoots up, fumbling towards the night stand to grab the Steve Phone™.
“We both made sacrifices, we have to live with them now.”
Tony fights against the onslaught of memories surfacing of the Siberia fight, he can’t afford another panic attack right now. If he were to ever get a bout of retrograde amnesia, now would be the perfect time, c’mon universe.
But all the years Tony’s had in military business have taught him to grin and bear it, especially when all you want to do is punch a pack of smug old white men in the face.
“No one’ll be in for a while and,” Steve starts to say, voice low, as he moves in closer to Tony, “I’ve missed you.”
bad. Rhodey’s always been a drama queen when it comes to him, what a mama-bear. Tony loves it.
Tony’s mouth dries up at the picture Steve makes. He’s gorgeous.
I think I’ve got enough now, thank you Tony,” Steve says, holding back his chuckling as a few people around them glance at Tony skeptically.
There’s about 30 seconds where Tony wakes up peacefully.
He has to clench his teeth together until they hurt to stop from protesting, but eventually turns back toward Red Skull. Looking straight into the eyes of the man who hurt Bucky, murdered, and plotted destruction all for his twisted scheme.
"Steve, you don't have to follow me
"Pay me a visit sometime,"
, so what's the point anymore?
. A grin breaks out into Tony's face, happy to see the man despite only seeing him a couple of days ago. However this was different, this wasn't just Jarvis coming to visit Tony, it was him bringing him home.
Or how Clint, even after Tony had beat him continuously at Mario kart, still dragged Tony into the kitchen so that they could steal the best of the snacks before Thor came and demolished it all. Everyone seemed to be well too nice to Tony, sweet and generous with their actions, offering him food, letting him get involved in their conversations, giving him a blanket to sleep under incase he got cold.
"Look, I'll get you started-"Tony is throwing open cupboards, rummaging get through them, throwing out items that look like they belong to Tony."You can keep the place, I'll live in the workshop, god knows I'll only be here for a short while anyway, I'll pay the rent for you, and your groceries, and whatever else that you want-"
"Well Clint will love that, he thrives to be famous. His only ambition in life is to be famously known for some hideous prank that will probably cost the lives of millions."Natasha stretches out on the couch beside James (
"Nope, not taking it. Take it as a tip for looking after me."
For everyone who is reading, commenting and being patient with me, thank you!
into but more like
Tony likes the company of his own, and if not on his own, then the bots back in his workshop at MIT or Rhodey on those days that he needs the comfort and attention. Sure, he liked that Steve came up the hospital to visit him, and the texting but that's different. Steve is different, he looks at Tony different, treats him different and that's what Tony likes about him. He just isn't sure that he'll like his friends.
But he's good. He's 28. Going on 29. And soon he'll be 30. And then 40. And then, Tony won't exactly know if he'll be good or not. But for now, he is. And for now, that's okay.
."James emphasises because he honestly can't believe it himself. Being married seems so
"Of course you are."She shakes her head and with that, she leaves Tony where he stands in the car park. Tony swallows the lump in his throat, taking his eyes off where Sarah was standing as he forces himself to turn towards the car that has stopped beside him.
"Huh?"
But there was only one of Tony, and despite the dozens of intelligent minds that work hard to perfect Tony's products, there was only one mind that could truly perfect it.
Or what Clint calls him; your everyday superhero.
of that look, because he had just seen his reflection just moments ago in the hospital bathroom look exactly like that, waxy and ill. As if he had just seen a ghost of a man he had imagined to be dead because to be dead was less of a heartache than for them to have just gotten up and left because being dead was not a choice. In a way, Steve had been a ghost, a ghost of a past that Tony had no interest in reliving and one he had been working years to forget with alcohol and pills and new heartaches to numb the one that left a gaping hole in his heart.
"Yes, thank you Thor! Say it louder, I don't think Bucks little sisters heard."Clint hisses, throwing himself onto the floor beside Natasha and curling into her side like a vulnerable little puppy desperate for affection. Natasha - being the brilliant best friend that she is - strokes at Clints hair.
"Gals?"
to give him money. That's a first, because as much as Rhodey doesn't want Tony's money, Honey-bear is more than grateful whenever Tony buys the drinks for the night or stalks up the cupboards in their shared dorm.
And they knew him too, obviously, as they shift in a sort of surprise that has their steel blue eyes widening in shock but it seems to be the only recognisable expression that graces his stoney features.
"Anything to make you happy, Boss."
"You're a weird guy,"James takes a seat on the damp wooden porch, his legs dangling over the steps and feet on the pavement in contrast to how Tony has his legs tucked under his bum. His eyes are narrowed, mumbling something under his breath whenever Tony suddenly presents him a lighter without a bash of the eyelids.
requesting your assistance."The A.I seems to heavily press on the word and Tony is sure that JARVIS is surely developing his own intelligence without Tony's assistance.
There's disbelief in his heart, a cry that what Bucky is flaunting isn't true, that it's fake news, a ploy to have Steve dragged away from his sweet on, to lure him into someone familiar and close to home who isn't halfway across the country. But Steve is logical, under all of his naivety and stubbornness, and he knows that the chances of Bucky lying to him are slim but that doesn't mean that Steve wants to believe him.
"Ha!"He laughs."Now either shut up and leave or fetch me a screwdriver, a universal one if you can, one that can be changed to fit multiple screws Incase you don't know what universal means."They inform, voice muffled with concentration and not even spearing Steve a glance who is hanging around the doorframe, unsure if he should step into the room and hold the chair so that the teen doesn't fall.
"Cheeseburger first."
"This isn't just to do with your lack of sleep."Strange observes, watching as Tony approaches the nurses desk that the doctor was previously leaning against. As much as Stephen liked to keep to himself, it didn't mean he hadn't noticed Tony's odd behaviour a couple of days ago. And that's saying something because to Strange, Tony is usually very odd to begin with.
"Don't normal people say that near death experiences bring out the positive side of them?"
and not something passed down from a passing generation and built on the soil of lies and abuse.
"Yeah, for Butterfingers- Oh! Sarah, Jarvis came up to visit today and brought up some photos to put by my bed, can you get them from the backpack for me please? There should be a Photograph of DUMM-E in there, I want you to see my 'bot."He sounds so thrilled as he speaks, smiling widely at Sarah as he points towards the backpack in the far left corner in a childish manner.
is never good, especially for Tony.
"30 minutes!"Tony is shouting down the hallway over his shoulder.
There's a hand that catches his own, and Tony freezes, he nearly flinches, but the hand is large and warm and
"There are worse ways to be famous, y'know."
Steve is grabbing his keys and phone from the place where he last left them, shutting the laptop lid close on his way out the door.
Because Tony is not only intoxicating, he's a
"It's good to see you, Sir."
"It's minus 5 outside."Bucky deadpans, grey eyes cold as he watches Steve reach for his own front door to make a leave in an angry huff.
Steve is hanging up his jacket by the front door, closing the door with the heel of his foot as he does so. It's cold outside and Steve can still feel it's chill even upon entering his apartment, one that has settled deep as he shakes his shoulders and heads to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea because Bruce has been on a herbal tea kick for the last several months and Steve has unwillingly become a fan.
"Oh please, nobody calls me Dr Stark. People seem to think if they start calling me by my Dr title that it'll undermine my father."Tony has rolled his eyes, setting his empty tumbler onto a passing tray. Howards old associates preferred not to call Tony but anything more than his name, to call him Doctor would just be insulting to Howard's memory. It would make it out that Tony was in some way shape or form
, he just doesn't know
"What did we agree, hmm? You would stop these silly, immature games in exchange for my absence of your life."
"Shit."Tony slumps in his chair, hands fiddling with the phone as he keeps peering for a message back from Steve."My mom is blaming me for her psychotic melt down and for the downfall of the company, and Howard is only finding interest in me due to the arc reactor. He'd probably rip it outta my chest if he got close enough."
Tony has to admit that his lack of sleep is something that is his own fault, because even at a young age Tony was always up to no good during the A.M or determined to finish a Lego sky-scraper for him to show Jarvis and Anna. Now, as a teenager he didn't sleep because he was distracted, and having that touch of ADD didn't really help when all you wanted to do was be cooped up in a lab and be blasting AC/DC until whatever he was working on is completed and to Tony's standard.
"Oh."And Tony swears he almost pales, hands clammy by his sides as he averts his gaze from Steve's so open, so earnest eyes that Tony swears that he could get lost in if he stares into them for too long.
It's where he finds himself now, bundled out on the balcony that leads from his bedroom, overlooking the fields of covered green that now is blanked with a layer of white snow that surrounds Stark Mansion. The concert Balcony is almost colder than the wind that's gushing into the side of Tony's face from where he's sitting down on the concert floor, his duvet draped around him, cocooning him with a warmth.
"Tomorrow is Christmas?"And okay, he hasn't looked at a Callander or his mobile in an awful long time because he's been too caught up trying to improve his hospital room and not get caught doing so. Steve nods his head, eyebrows meeting in the middle."So that means it's Christmas Eve, why are you spending your Christmas Eve with me? Why aren't you with your family?"
"Big family?"
"Impressive,"Thor is whistling lowly at Tony’s extended knowledge of James Bond actors.
Steve manages to strip out of his blood soaked clothing and into fresh and warmer clothing, throwing his clothes into the hamper and staggering his way tiredly to his bed. It's late now, just after 8 in the evening and although there's a dull ache for food rumbling in Steves stomach, by the time he wakes up he'll make some food. For now, sleep is enough.
"It was!"
"I want you t-"
"Steve, fuck off. I'm
"Go on,"Tony had turned to look at Pepper who had remained unmoved, unsure, as she stood in Tony's workshop with strict instructions to drag Tony out by the ear and into a shower, changed and off to gala event by 7:30."Say
"He didn't tell you the truth either."Bucky deadpans, stuffing the phone back into the pocket of his jogging bottoms, pushing a hand through his longing dark hair."He lied to you, Steve, he made you believe that he was some type of wounded animal, and what, because he has that thing in his chest? Boohoo, poor little rich boy is just hanging onto that as a charity case stunt to pull in sadsaps like you for fresher cock."
The hospital that his mom works in is all to familiar for Steve. He had spent a lot of his childhood in the hospital, and it wasn't because he was always getting into petty little fights with other boys because they were picking on someone else, but because he was often right along during weekends and spent his after school days here, in the waiting rooms and in the hallways.
“Hey Steve, uh—did you want to go grab a bite to eat at the shawarma stand?” Tony asks, and then adds before Steve can reply, “I’m pretty much done here for the day, so we could hang out at the park after if you wanted?”
Natasha has her gun up now, “We’re wasting time, we’re here to help you Clint, this is a trap.”
[11:13 P.M.]
Not to mention how tense it’s been between him and Steve, since their drunken one night stand a few months ago. Tony would have been fine with them just brushing it off and forgetting about it, but instead he had to start harboring feelings for the guy and now with this mission in the way, they’ve been at a standstill. Did he mention how much he hates undercover missions? Let alone the type that has his right wrist cramping from how many times he’s had to tug a quick one out in the bathroom because Steve decided to wear one of those skin tight henley’s again.
Tony doesn’t tell Steve he’s only seen this done at the kickbacks Natasha has invited him to. That girl knows how to throw a party.
Tony has to stop himself from crunching the flimsy plastic of the phone in his hands from his tight grip.
*me clutching my mug close to me as i sip my tea* soooo...thoughts?
Tony sighs, so he didn’t dream that all up.
‘Tony Stark Missing’ it reads, and Steve feels his heart drop low into his stomach.
He doesn’t let Steve know that it’s also because he more than likes the company Steve makes.
But science? Tony Stark can never ignore science.
Tony brings the blunt back up to his lips, and slowly takes a good sized hit, lest any smoke escapes before he can get to Steve. He leans in close, and Steve opens his mouth for him to bring their lips together, and Tony blows, feeling the smoke he was holding in pass into Steve’s mouth.
“No Tony, he wants to get rid of them, permanently.”
“Jesus, what a shit show. You got hit? How’s your side?”
“Tony, you have to understand, I never wanted you to find out that way.”
“Clock’s ticking Steve, put your money where your mouth is.”
Tony’s fine with hiding out in his compound and licking his wounds.
Steve chuckles, shaking his head at the ridiculous nickname, pointing down to his own nametag on his chest.
“I know, I still wanted to say it.”
Tony follows the sounds of heavy boots on linoleum floor, and stays close to the corners.
“Okay,” Steve replies distractedly, seeming to get lost in his thoughts for a moment, before adding, “Good.”
She raises one brow, “Keep it in your pants Tony, I’m going to get some shut eye before we land, you should too.”
Figures that’s what he thinks, Tony’s good deeds seem to always be taken the wrong way lately.
“FRIDAY, send Tash a message will ya? Ask her for any updates and when she’ll be back.”
Natasha sends him a grim smile, “It was Ross, I got in contact with a few people who owe me favors, and Ross has a bone to pick with our rogue team.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve frowns, reading the ingredients list one more time, finger tracing the text just in case his eyes are deceiving him. He hums unhappily once he realizes what he’s looking for is indeed not listed.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you baby.”
Tony frowns, realizing something, “But isn’t the only way to travel back in time.”
Tony spins around eventually and lets Steve wrap his arms around him, both of them sleepy and warm from the drug.
“It was just a flesh wound, takes a lot more to get me down.” She flashes him her signature smirk, and then grows serious.
Tony watches Steve, the way his sweat slick hair falls so pretty over his forehead, how the furrow in his brow deepens while focusing on his release, his muscles hard and flexing, every dream Tony’s ever had coming true right in front of him, and he can’t quite tell where Steve ends and he begins, they’re entirely intertwined together, sharing breaths, explosions of pleasure happening all around them.
“Aww, I can’t even not pick up so I can watch the line blink.”
Sam finally blocks Steve’s vision of the screen, and forces Steve to look him in the eyes, “Steve, listen to me, unless you somehow find a spaceship and a balls of steel pilot to get you there, we’re going to have to let Tony handle this himself, we have to go help Wanda and Vision, remember?”
“Tony…” Steve starts to remove his sunglasses but stops.
“Do one of you want to clue me in on why one of my boyfriends has come back to me as a human pin cushion?” Tony asks, now that he’s got the situation sorted mostly, he wants answers.
Shit.
Steve’s stood back up and turned towards Tony with a cute—
Steve’s nostrils flare, he’s frustrated that they’ve come all this way to get nothing in return. They need a better answer than that.
Tony keeps his hands busy, moving them down to start unbuckling Steve’s pants and shoving them off as best he can from his heightened position. When Steve pulls away, Tony looks down to find Steve decided to forego any underwear today and his hardened cock is in full view.
“Steve,” Tony had said, voice small, while the others were talking among themselves, “It’s good to see you.”
It hasn’t even been 100 days since Siberia, and yet he feels so changed.
Steve’s own spit slick hand comes around his length and Tony sighs in relief, Steve’s thick fingers taking some of the hot edge off.
Tony’s sitting at the back of the row of chairs, willing himself to pass out so he can avoid his life and pretend this isn't happening.
“Glad to see you’re not dead, now I can have the pleasure of killing you myself.”
God, when will it end?
Without the worry hanging over his head, Tony can finally breathe clearly.
They’re traveling as fast as possible back to earth, already alerted the rest of the team of their discovery, and Steve is able to maybe see the light at the end of this.
They both leave the lab, completely unaware of the two figures hiding out in the shadows.
“Yeah, me and JARVIS got a baby girl on our hands, she might be small now, but they grow fast,” Tony explains as Steve has crouched down now, to get a better look at the tiniest octopus he’s ever seen.
“So, do you have a plan?”
Tony barely has time to blink before his body moves on autopilot, lunging toward the man aiming at Sam and getting a hard kick in, up into the family jewels, stunning him after with the baton for good measure as the soldier falls to the floor.
Steve almost starts to say it wasn’t Tony’s fault, because it wasn't, Tony has been battling and preparing for this war longer than all of them, but then Tony continues talking.
He’s up and out of his bed, phone abandoned in the mess of his covers.
“Warn a guy before sneaking up on him! …Why are you back so early?”
He couldn’t hear anything at all.
Steve didn’t hesitate to kick the door in and run into the room, straight into the back where the tank is kept, Tony only a few steps behind him the whole way.
He didn’t ask why Tony won’t stop rubbing his hands on his pants, and tried not to eavesdrop when Bruce asked Tony where Spider-Man and Strange were.
Even when T’Challa’s little sister, Princess Shuri was sobbing, screaming, and beating on Steve’s chest, looking for answers he didn’t have.
It’s not that hard of a decision in the end.
, but the serious look on Tony’s face still makes his heart stop for a second. The idea of a life spent with Tony, laughing, and kissing, and spending the rest of forever in love. Steve’s more than okay with that.
Steve can feel the pain in her voice.
“We were ambushed outside of their safe-house, we got separated, and those jerks got two into Buck before I could break free and get us out of there,” Steve answers guiltily.
“Tony? You answered.”
Steve looks so down about it, Tony’s heart hurts for him, Steve always takes an injury happening on his watch as a slight to his ability as a leader.
[2:19 A.M.]
Tony stands up from the creaky bed and turns off the T.V., news about the nation’s current political situation is not helping calm himself down. Without the hum of the television, Tony’s stuck listening to thunder start to rumble overhead. He goes to lay back down—or else he’ll start pacing and won’t be able to stop.
“He might have hacked into Ross’ home security system, set the sprinkler system off inside his house, then hacked into his home network and sent President Ellis a
“I want you to, please Steve.”
“Stonekeeper,” Nebula says, and then the figure steps into the light and Steve’s heart stops.
Right here, in this warm body cradling him, in this safe space, where he can hide away, pretend he’s not slowly being dragged down by this invisible force.
thank you so much for the comments and kudos on the first chapter.
“Now I wish it was Cap, come back home we could go a few more rounds.”
“How the hell did they make it past the two downstairs?”
Tony just wanted to push and push Steve away. He didn’t want to face his feelings or the way that Steve would look at him when he thought Tony wasn’t paying attention.
[6:54 P.M.]
Aren’t they?
It doesn’t matter that it won’t be this way forever, nothing ever is, it only matters that it’s
Steve pulls back up once Tony let’s go of the hold on his shoulders, and he hums thoughtfully, feigning like he’s considering the prospect.
A lot of pain could have been spared.
Tony snatches the phone off the workshop floor, shoving it into his back pocket before power walking to the closest liquor cabinet.
It looks to just be a graze but the sight of blood on his favorite resident spy has Tony feeling queasy with worry, Natasha never has more than a hair out of place. He yells for Vision to get her to medical, as he aims toward the direction their opponent ran in.
They take their fries to go, and decide to walk down by the lake nearby, it’s nearly two in the morning, and the full exhaustion of the night has yet to hit Steve. His mind is completely focused on the hot food his stomach is gratefully indulging in and the way Tony’s eyes seem to never stop glowing even with the darkened night sky above them.
But for now, they need to get Octavia back into water, and there’s only one place big enough to hold her size comfortably. And, Tony’s not particularly happy about it.
“Well, it started when I couldn’t sleep one night and sometimes JARVIS puts on nature documentaries to bore me enough to knock out,” Tony pauses, and curses himself for sounding like a kid who needs to be read to sleep. “Anyways, basically, they showed this octopus stuck in a jar with the lid shut, and it was able to unscrew the jar by itself and escape, so I’ve wanted one since,” Tony finishes saying before adding, “Oh, and they also have nine brains.”
Tony can’t believe the hi-jinks that are constantly ensuing on this campus, he can’t have
“Get on Tony, the fries are waiting.”
“FRIDAY, I want you to put in the biggest order at the nearest IHOP, we’re gonna need the whole damn menu.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Rogers, huh?”
Up close like this, Steve notices more about him, the huge brown eyes, glittering with competitive light in the dark room, and how Steve is just the slightest bit taller than him, so he has to look up to meet Steve’s eyes. He spins around then, showing off before swaying his hips side to side, and Steve can’t help but throw his head back with a laugh, before doing a big spin and suave move of his own in retaliation.
Tony picks up his head to squint sadly at him, “I was
“Tones, you know I’m on your side, and yeah this sucks, this is a bad beat. But I haven’t changed my mind, at least not yet.”
But Tony’s already opening a random drawer and slamming it shut after tossing the phone in, out of sight out of mind.
Tony opens his mouth to say something, anything. Steve beats him to it.
Relieving because Tony didn’t know if Steve was even still alive, and heartbreaking because he’s still harboring all these feelings towards the ex-Captain.
He’d exchanged a short conversation with Tony after the commotion of the team’s relief earlier.
It’s not the first time they’ve done this—albeit they weren’t exactly sober then—and Tony quickly relents under Steve’s tongue. Steve kisses like he’s sure about it, full of confidence and sharp nips of his teeth on Tony’s bottom lip, Tony’s cock stirs, taking an immediate interest in this new activity. He lets out a muffled moan when Steve shoves a thigh up in between his legs, shimmying around until he’s at the best angle, and grinding it against Tony, hard.
Red Skull’s voice is dull when he replies, “Captain Rogers, It's been a very long time."
“Where were we?” Tony asks much too quietly, but their new proximity grants Steve the touch of their chests together, practically sharing breaths, that he hears every word perfectly.
Normally, he and Clint would’ve had a blast messing with them.
, Tony can do that, no harm in a little show and tell.
Instead he laughs, and tips his head down shyly, “I was thinking of going simple today, how do chocolate chip cookies sound to you?”
Tony curses, they’re outnumbered, but then, Natasha is making her way over to a window, handgun out, and casually jumping through it.
They all head down to where their get-away van is parked, using back alleys to avoid any citizens.
It was his pick this week and Steve had never seen it, and that’s an injustice in itself. He had said as much the day before while at lunch with Wasp—who wholeheartedly agreed.
He would rather avoid the headache that comes with speaking to the man.
In this moment, between the seconds where he is okay and where he’s not.
And as soon as the smoke hits Tony’s lungs, he’s coughing said lungs up.
“Tony, are you alright?” comes Steve’s voice inside the fog of his thoughts.
“C’mon Stark, let’s get you up.”
mission fic is not my forte, so i made it vague on purpose.
Steve flicks her off over his shoulder, shutting the door quickly so he only has to hear her sing the first few lines of the Time of My Life, loudly and impressively off key.
“If you want in my pants, all you gotta do is ask babe,” Bucky retorts weakly, and Tony just shakes his head with a smile and gets to work on pulling the stained denim off.
Tony starts the water and Steve gets himself and Bucky undressed, both of them needing to scrub away the grime they collected.
That orange tentacle belongs to only one octopus, and she’s somehow tripled in size since Steve and Tony left her an hour ago.
He takes a deep breath before shooting a repulsor blast at the door’s lock and kicking it open.
He had found a family in them.
Steve’s still fiddling with the light, finding the best angle to position it at when he replies, “Aw Tony, it’s okay, we can still hang out here until someone sorts it out.”
They went all out with the decorations, bright red and white balloons strewn across the floor and streamers draped on every accessible place they could manage. Steve has severely vivid flashbacks to every high school dance he attended and he pauses to shake off how weird it makes him feel for a moment, before reminding himself that braces and hair styled with way too much gel isn’t his reality anymore, thankfully.
“Let’s go around back, we can have FRIDAY scan for heat signatures.” Natasha casually walks off and Tony starts doing long division in his head for a couple minutes before following, as to not look suspicious. Also, because math makes him happy.
He feels Tony lay his head against his shoulder, arms tightening further around him, “I’m not sure, it feels like a dream.”
Natasha can be a master of persuasion at the best of times, she had laid it on thick and Tony ate it right up.
Steve is sneakily trying to give her more treats than necessary and Tony lets him slip her two more before cutting him off for the day, “Don’t spoil her now, we want to keep her humble,” he says.
He will make it right.
But Clint and Natasha were called in by Fury last night for some side-op, leaving Tony alone with only Steve and Bruce, the latter of the two in back snoozing away while Tony makes enemies with the clock.
“Yeah alright alright, enough about me, what’s Mr. Picasso working on right now?” Tony asks, deflecting the attention back onto Steve.
If Steve wants to only give him one measly word, Tony will give him two back.
Tony rips the bottle out of his hand and takes several gulps before feeling mostly like he can breathe again.
[7:03 P.M.]
He’s reminded of his past few conversations with Steve, and how the other man had mentioned something about Hydra and kidnappings. Tony says as much to Natasha and she doesn’t look surprised.
“I leave you alone for ten minutes and you’ve already replaced me, Stark?” Tony’s soft smile turns away from Steve and towards the man now standing next to them.
He’s met with two soldiers, a tied-up Sam, and a cuffed bloodied Steve.
It’s his compound and since everyone else decided to abandon it, Tony vetoes any fuck he gives about invading privacy and closes his fist around the knob.
And so, that’s how it all began, at first with Steve coming by every chance he got to see the octopus Tony lovingly named Octavia, until Tony got so fed up with Steve’s puppy dog eyes that he threw her feeding schedule at him and told him to come by a couple times every day to tend to her.
[2:33 P.M.]
He's been working away at reviewing Octavia’s training footage recorded from earlier in the day, and she’s well past exceeded the level Tony wanted for her to be at this week and will be fully ready for a new set of tasks next month, he adores her really.
Once they’re safely slid into the oven, Steve gets to work on washing the dishes, the sleeves of his sweater rolled up to his elbows, and the apron covered in flour from an earlier accident still tied securely around his waist.
“C’mon Sourpatch, you know that you love me too much to kill me, who else would provide you with endless hours of entertainment?”
The archer sighs but ultimately lets up on his draw and nods his head toward the stairway to the next floor.
Steve reaches out to grab a couple and slips them onto his fingers, like candy rings. He offers them out to Tony, and Tony doesn’t hesitate to slip Steve’s fingers into his mouth to bite them off.
Tony off on another engineering binge, his third suit in a week and Steve fighting for Tony to take a break.
Steve’s pulled out of his dreams later in the night when a warm hand slides around his middle, and prickly stubble tickles his bare shoulder.
The thing is, Tony does care about Steve and his ex-team, but damn does he resent them right now.
Bucky only makes a small pained noise when Tony pulls past the two stab wounds bleeding on his thigh. Tony has to close his eyes as the sight of the blood makes his stomach twist, but he soldiers on and get Bucky’s jeans completely off.
“I think your stomach just told me that it was going to eat me.”
The shop today (that they’ve been stationed at for a mind-numbing 9 weeks now) has been slow, only a handful of customers stopping in. Most of them perusing the shelves and leaving with empty hands, plus a few teenagers Tony had the joy of kicking to the curb after they stumbled red-faced through a lie about forgetting their ID’s.
He feels stunted somehow, all that Steve had said to him was one goddamn word? Sure, Tony was in fucking shock, who wouldn’t be. But he feels like he deserved way more than that.
When Thor told him that he might have found a way to get answers, Steve didn’t expect them to come from a raccoon named Rocket, who claimed he’d kill Thanos himself with a determined look in his eye, one Steve knows only comes from a life ending loss.
He’s led Steve over to a table with an all glass tank filled with water. Steve hesitates after Tony gestures for him to take a closer look, “She?” he asks, before letting his eyes fall on the creature inside the tank.
[7:07 P.M.]
He immediately goes to activate his shield, but Tony’s hand on his arm stops him.
“That’s the thing, this wasn’t sanctioned, because Ross has flown the coop and gone on a secret side mission. He’s got a good-sized team behind him, and he’s not going to hesitate in using all the force he needs, he’s had a vendetta since the Raft breakout.”
So much of this could have been avoided with communication.
“A little, but with the power out, I doubt the cafe cart is open…”Steve starts to say, and then shrugs, picking up some of the candy they found under Bucky’s bed. “I’m good with this for now.”
Tony makes a mock offended face at Steve, “How dare you presume I need anyone to open my jars,” he jokes, before saying “Now shut-up or I won’t let you feed her.”
Tony loves this man.
“I’ve wanted this for so long since that night,” Tony gasps, “I thought—thought you regretted it,” he barely bites out over their moans.
Before anyone can speak, Natasha and Clint are at the doorway, looking exhausted but unharmed.
Seeing Steve had been…both heartbreaking and relieving.
Rhodey’s stopped to sit down, already winded by the small workout. Tony has to force the grimace off his face, he’ll get Rhodey back to top shape, whatever it takes.
There’s only a few things that honestly send a chill down Tony’s spine, and one of them happens to be waking up to Natasha’s smiling face. His brain goes flight or fight and he makes a half attempt at sitting up, before she pushes him back down.
She’s barely two inches long, just an orange speckled ball of squish and several skinny limbs.
“Look Steve, I don’t doubt it, but we’re a little way past a sorry helping our situation here.”
Tony nods his head, keeping Steve in one hand while leaning back to use his other hand to push down his briefs, his cock popping up into view.
Tony was upset at her, at the situation they had all wound-up in.
“What the hell are you doing here?”
Rhodey quirks an eyebrow at him, “Wanna find out if we’ll be having another superhero war, more like.”
They’re walking in sync up the first flight of stairs, “You think it’s more of Ross’ men, or…” Tony doesn't have to specify who.
“I don’t know how serious you were last night, but I really like you Steve, and I was having the best time right before we got interrupted,” Tony says, making sure Steve knows how open he’s trying to be, “I wanted to know if we could get a redo, another try at last night, one that doesn’t end in disaster?”
“Okay,” Tony starts, “I’m going to take a puff of this without inhaling, and then blow it back into your mouth, where you’ll inhale instead, got it?” he asks Steve who’s looking more interested every second Tony’s talking.
Rhodey barely gives Steve a glance, assessing the scene, before he shakes his head disbelievingly at Tony’s antics, “Take your water Tony, I’m not going to watch you dehydrate anymore tonight,” he says pointedly, and then turns towards Steve, “He’s your problem now Steve, don’t let him dance himself to death no matter how cool he thinks that’ll sound as an epitaph on his tombstone.”
His skin felt red hot, and he tried and failed to get the vision of death from out in front of him.
“I didn’t know Barnes was such a stoner,” Tony says first, looking up at Steve’s amused face.
Not until Steve’s thumb comes up to wipe away a stray droplet that’s making its way down Tony’s chin.
And it’s enough.
Steve groans louder as Tony picks up the speed of his pumping, wanting, needing to see Steve come apart in front of him.
He walks in to his pitch black apartment, Natasha sprawled out on the couch in a similar position from all those hours ago, and Steve is not one bit surprised as he throws a blanket around her, before softly shutting the door to his bedroom shut.
Clint’s frown deepens and he talks quietly into his comm, likely informing the rest of his team he’d caught them. “Cap? You there?” Clint’s voice is louder now, concerned.
Oh, yeah, that’s a big no. Tony had sent both calls from Steve straight to voicemail, he can barely handle texting. He doesn’t want to imagine trying to suffer through a phone call.
He doesn’t hesitate to rip it open and say, “Tony?”, his voice tense as he holds his breath for a reply.
Tony wants to create; he wants to engineer his ass off.
Tony lets out a laugh, he remembers that like it was yesterday.
Tony grounds himself and it may take him ten more minutes before he’s able to breathe normally and attempt to stand, but he manages.
It’s the first time Steve’s seen him look sheepish and his brain absolutely eats it up, taking in the glossy look in his eyes and the coloring on his cheeks.
Tony’s bent over the couch shoving the cushions aside, on his quest to find the phone Steve gave him.
Except when Tony finally catches up to him, he’s already being taken care of.
They had taken one look at each other in his hospital room, and knew that they would be fine.
Tony lets his walls down, curling into Bucky and lacing his fingers with the hand Steve offers.
Steve begins sketching, and he doesn’t stop until the early morning light begins to shine in through his window, casting a perfect shadow across his page as he’s finishing, happy with the final pose he chose.  Steve closes his eyes, and remembers the way Tony had looked amongst all those people, one hand in his hair, that soft smile on his face, and the glinting lights above him making him the prettiest thing Steve has ever seen.
Tony now equipped with a stun baton pried from one of the soldier’s belts, they all stand poised in front of the 6
He has about thirty seconds’ peaceful silence, before he’s getting a phone call.
He had just finished up in the workshop, letting FRIDAY get to work putting a fresh coat of paint on his new suit. Tony had intended to go straight to bed, needing a reprieve after the long hours spent deep in code. He was on his way to the staircase leading to his suite, when he passed by the door of his old Captain’s room. He’s never been inside, not even before everything went to hell. Tony might be curious (some might call it nosy), but he firmly believes in someone’s personal space staying that way.
Bucky’s breathing is heavy but sounds clear, so Tony isn’t too worried about anything internal happening.
There’s a brighter aura around Tony, that usually comes with spending time with his oldest and closest friend. Is there anything better in the world than knowing someone will always stand beside you, even when the going gets tough? Tony’s lucky he hasn’t pushed Rhodey away, given his many mess-ups throughout the years.
Steve squeezes his hand back tightly, and Tony feels the beginnings of a warmth start to bloom in his chest.
Then he gestures to Loki, “C’mon mastermind, you’re helping us get her up there.”
[11:09 P.M.]
Vormir is freezing.
Blinking the sleepy fog away from his vision, Steve turns around to properly greet the face he’s been missing all day.
But Steve can’t just leave Tony hanging, not after what he promised him. He’s never wished to be able to be in two places at once, more than he has now.
of living, breathing, it’s all hushed away. The thump of his heart, and the heart next to his, the only sound remaining.
The song ends much too soon, and Steve bows his head, stepping away, accepting defeat while offering a nod and smile toward his competitor. “Alright, you win.” Steve says, voice picking up in volume to be heard over the start of the next song.
Tony’s last memory of true patience, was back in Afghanistan.
Now that they’re both squared away Tony makes his way back into the room, “I’m gonna order some food, be right back,” Tony yells to them both, before sitting back down onto the bed.
Natasha pops in front of him quickly, guarding him from their guest.
It pissed Tony off, what did Steve even care for?
Tony is trying to put as much disinterest in his voice as he can, here’s hoping Steve can take a hint.
“It’s too late Rhodey, what’s done is done.”
Something bad happened here.
“But what about the children, Steve?”
Tony receives The Letter exactly a month after Siberia.
Steve scribbles his name onto the crowded sign-up sheet, rolling his eyes at the ‘Mike Rotch’ two lines above his. His first lesson at college; graduating high school doesn’t always equal maturity. Putting the annoying frat dudes aside, Steve is excited for the dance marathon.
It’s awhile later and Tony’s grabbing some tools to burn through some SI projects. He realizes he hasn’t spoken to Natasha since the mission. It’s been a little over a week now, and while that’s not unusual for her to drop off the face of the earth from time to time, Tony is still a worry-wart.
but it's definitely not the main focus here, i hope you enjoy!
Steve is who knows how many miles away and yet his presence haunts Tony like a shadow.
—smile on his face, “So, you’ve got a pet octopus to open jars for you?”
Right, this is gonna be great.
“Did you like them?” Steve asks, not giving Tony a chance to answer before he’s kissing him again, deeper, chasing more of his hard day’s work on Tony’s tongue.
“Next time, just shake some sense into me please, because I very much enjoy this,” he says, grabbing Steve’s hand in his own, as they make their way over to the park.
Tony pushes Steve back a bit and makes himself busy, clumsily kicking off his shoes, peeling his sweaty shirt off of his torso, while hastily unbuckling his belt loop.
[6:57 P.M.]
He warned Peter to stop messing around with the electro-fetish villains, but no one can tell that kid a thing.
Tony has four hours left before he’s off duty, and the combination of humidity and ache reverberating between his shoulder blades, is setting him up for one hell of a migraine.
, heart pounding inside his chest so hard, he was convinced it was going to rip right through.
There’s about a million different scenarios running through Tony’s head, so many things could go wrong, and damn them both for convincing him not to bring any suits. Of course, he still has his suitcase armor in the trunk of the car in the parking lot, but if his paranoia turns out to be wrong and Steve catches him out for lying, Tony would rather not deal with Steve Rogers’ I’m disappointed in your actions face.
Tony just nods his head, “As long as you assholes never do that to me again, you couldn’t even send a text?” Tony asks, his earlier worries were entirely justified now.
Steve can’t stop the goofy smile from growing on his face.
Tony scrunches his nose up at the text on screen and waves his hands for JARVIS to wipe it all away.
Tony goes back to glaring daggers into the man’s face before knocking him out with one punch to his face.
Tony turns his head to Steve who just shakes his head with a grimace. Tony takes in a steadying breath and quietly says to Steve, “There’s a first aid kit in the trunk of the car, go grab it and I’ll get him to lay down.”
The soldier flails and drops his gun, Tony dashes for it, snatching it off the floor and aiming it straight at the man’s heart.
Remember how Tony was a big dumb idiot? This just in; he has now earned the title giant big dumb idiot for this one.
“Let’s get you over to the bed Bucky, so I can take a look at where all of that blood that’s not yours is coming from,” Tony says. He helps Bucky back onto his feet, ignoring the painful hiss Bucky makes as he sets both feet on the floor and they make their way to the bed.
He shoots a repulsor blast at the pole Steve’s cuffed to and after it breaks, he’s off helping Sam out of his binds.
“I saw him pack it a week ago,” Bucky says, then shrugs at the affronted look both Tony and Steve send him, “You are a bit predictable in that arena.”
Tony still wanted to be mad at her from their conversation when Rhodey’s diagnosis was up in the air. His comment about her not being able to shake the double agent act was petty, and he knew it, that’s why he said it. Their friendship has always been full of insults, going straight for the jugular. And despite all that, at the end of the day still protecting each other fiercely.
"How about this?"He asks again, this time pinching a different area of flesh with a pair of tweezers, earning a sudden jerk of pain as the sensation floods through James.
"Dum-E, what did I say about using the coffee maker?"Tony's tone is full of exhaustion as he watches the bot race from one side of the workshop to where Tony stands at its entrance, hands on his hips as he glares at the bot and the container of coffee that it holds in his claw. Dum-E beeps and whirls excitedly, showing off the container of coffee to his master. "Yes I know, you made coffee, but don't you remember what happened last time you made me coffee?"
"I'll think about it. Thank you for the invite."Tony decides just to go with it, seeing as Steve doesn't seem like the type of person to just give up, being the stubborn bastard that he seems to be. In a way, Tony finds it charming, just as much as it's annoying. After a couple of moments of silence, Tony speaks up."You don't seem like the party type of guy."
Peggy - as Christened by the group whenever Thor had pulled the car out of a scrap yard - skids into the ambulance unloading section at A&E, with the windows rolled down manually and some Bon Jovi tape in the player. The car gets out an u heathy rattle and wheel as it slows to a stop. Steve doesn't expect anything else from Natasha, the girl makes her own rules as he goes and that's why Steve lobes about her.
. Look at me! Alive and kicking."
"Don't tell me you've never been shopping before, Tony. That's just sad."Steve shakes his head, finding it hard to believe.
"To see Momma Rhodes, I know, I know. Just until I fall asleep."Tony has a leg thrown over Rhodey, shuffling into his personal space until his cheek rests upon Rhodey shoulder and the mans arm is draped around him, pulling him towards his body in that protective sort of way that Tony loves to be held.
He just wants Steve to see him as
he wasn't stupid, he just needed that little bit of leverage to push him towards a better education - and maybe a kick in the ass from Natasha - and maybe a chance in a college of his choice. Steves mindset was always focused on the better of others, he was the mother, the fairy godmother, the parent of his variety bunch of friends.
"You did."
Which there is, Tony calls it when they leave Burger King driver thru and Jarvis owns him coffee for a week. All Tony wants more in life is to go to bed and sleep in his own bed for the duets time in ages, maybe say Hello to his Mom and then phone Rhodey to tell him that he's home safely, but then disappear.
"Yeah,"Tony shrugs his shoulders, screwing a screw back into place with his screwdriver."But that's unlikely to happen, it's more likely I'll die from untreated infection around the arc reactor than anything else, I mean I have a fucking hole in my chest, of course I'm going to get infected."
"I got a heads up."He admits, thanking a nurse as he's handed back his StarkTab that Tony had gratefully gifted to him when they entered into their little work dynamic. As much as Tony and Stephen both like to tell people they don't work well with other people, the two work very well with one another.
"Can we hurry up before the ice cream starts melting?"Desperate to steer the conversation away, Tony pipes up and moves a round the Trolley to peer at the ice cream. He still didn't see the point on the food shopping because really all of the stuff that was in the tower was intact imported from different locations across the globe just to fit everyone's likings, paid for by Tony himself,
"You don't know where you are or if you're hurt, talk to me."
"And I'm a secret agent."Steve rolls his eyes in amusement.
"Here's a towel for after your shower."Steve has it already into Tony's hands before the teen can protest. The towel is fresh out of the dryer, soft and smelling of that laundry detergent that had tainted Steve's sheets.
"Tony,"Steve almost smiles sadly, reaching out to lay a gentle hand on Tony's hand. Tony's very faint flinch doesn't go unnoticed by Steve, the teenager retracting his hand slowly away."Tony, friends come in all shapes and sizes, problems and without. I don't care of anything other than you being you."
"It's a low risk procedure. If we're unable to connect the remaining tissue and nerves to that of the cybernetic prosthetic, we will accustom you with something equalling as matching. The only issue that we have is that of time. If you want us to push forward with this new prosthetic, it will take a lengthy amount of time. We're talking maybe 6 months to a year."
"Where'd you go?"Tony pauses in his tracks, a hand ghosting over the fabric of the cubical curtain that he so desperately wants to rip open and disappear behind, throwing responsibility to I'm-not-good-with-people Stephen Strange and go
"Rachel, leave Stevie alone. He doesn't want to play house."Bucky mutters as he enters the room with a drink for Steve and himself. His nose is scrunched up in a short of disgusted manner as he glares at his little sister to stop bothering his friend with her childish obsession of playing with dolls and playing pretend.
"Yes, well I was thinking, I happen not to be on call this evening myself and I was wondering if you woul-"
And that's all that Tony can remember.
When Tony awakes again, this time, it's on his own accord and he's on his own. Replacing the sickly sweet voice is the continuous beeping sound of the all too familiar heart monitor, monitoring Tony's heart beat that seemed a little too slow for his liking. The cotton ball feeling is still in his mouth, mouth dry from lack of swallowing and hoarse from lack of speaking.
"Tony-"
. God, that just makes me shiver and quake! I think I just creamed."Tony makes a show of tensing and shivering, smirking and winking seductively to the screen.
"Sir, I do need to remind you that you wanted to call Doctor Banner this afternoon."Tony blinks, hands stopping in its tracks of gliding across holographic screens, eyes tired of squinting because he forgot where he had last set his glasses and doesn't want to ask JARVIS where they are. He looks at the clock, making a strangled sound of surprise at the time.
For once in his life, Tony Stark is early, which is something that never happens because usually, the places that Tony is being dragged to or being forced to go to are places that Tony would rather be dead than alive to be in, and usually with that, that means that arriving fashionably late gives Tony Stark the best type of entrance to any party or club.
"So are you, handsome, Thinking you're all mysterious and edgy just because you listened to one
, favouriting scandalous stories of newly contacted STI's and an exclusive interview with the latest who has crawled into bed with Tony Stark. Tony, of course, finds amusement from indulging in such articles, a guilty pleasure to read because it's always fun to know if he has Chlamydia this month or be reminded of all his favourite kinks.
. They didn't know who he was, how he acts, how much money that he has. It's all
"Stevie over here thinks he's the best artist around since Picasso."
There had been a buzz in his pocket which Tony had chosen to ignore, sure of who it was, sure he was willing to ignore its business. A message maybe, a missed phone call, a headlining alert with the favourite tag of
tagging along?"
“I’m not saying that he isn’t, Steve, I’m just saying that he’s doing it
consoles being thrown out the window, Tony"
He's half awake, half tempted to roll over and press his face into the cold, fine polished wooden floor to ease at his pulsing headache, but there's a hand grabbing at the scruff of his shirt, pulling him across the wooden floor and tugging him harshly up into a seated position with his back against a sofa. Tony's head lolls forward but there's a hand in his hair, stretching his neck back as cold, harsh, sharp water is thrown into his face.
He can't help but notice the little scars that litter his arms and wrists, or the cuts around his face or the bruising on his cheek. He wears a dark tank top that dips low at his chest, exposing the bandages that cover his shoulders, biceps and chest. What makes Steve freeze is the odd blue light that glows from the teenagers chest, circle in shape and right in the middle.
Steve is never more glad to be dropped off at the hospital, calling out a goodbye to the three remaining in the car as he ran his way to the entrance out of the cold before he suffers from frostbite. He's never had good experience with the cold, it brought back bad childhood memories that he tries his hardest to forget.
"Who are you?"And his voice; emotionless, monotone, dull, blunt. It's so unlike Steve, it's not Steve. Tony encrypts the question, he knows the answer that Steve is looking for.
"Oh,"Tony says."You'll be spending tomorrow with them, I assume?"
Steve wakes up to a Cow in his livingroom, a gift from Tony, Something Steve can't help being amused about.
test subjects, if you will. They signed a waiver so they legally can't sue me if they develop unexplained nausea, ill-health, unexpected migraines, flu like symptoms or disruptive bowl moments and or find themselves in need of medical care."Tony lists off on his hand haven mulled over the possible symptoms that could possibly turn up when receiving replacement meal shakes from a 16 year old with no experience in meal replacement drinks whatsoever.
Tony tenses whenever she sees his mom come towards him, already able to see the effects of whatever Howard has given her to 'calm her nerves' take over. She's a social butterfly, Tony knows that he gets it from her.
But sometimes the best way to get through Tony's self loathing skull is just to be brutally honest
. Remove the rest, I don't care what happens to them or where they end up, just get them off of the property."The shadow that had been casted over Tony shifts away, a beam of sunlight lining through the massive, stretched out windows and onto Tony, casting the light upon his rugged, hungover features.
"You're not that kind of doctor,"Tony smirks, shrugging a shoulder,"And besides, you kept declining my offer to be apart of my team."
And Tony knows that type of look, and he's
"I've never seen a boy so capable of looking captivating even in bad publicity photos."He trails off, taking a puff of the cigar that's between his own lips."You know the ones. The coming out a club at 3am with a 30 year old guy grinding on your ass. You're lucky I keep those sort of things away from your Father."
"I know."Tony's attention is snapped back to Rhodey, eyes narrowed, lips parting with visible disbelief.
and it swallows Tony's own in a way that's familiar but not. The hand is so smoothed, without scars or blemishes and so unlike Tony's own which have been scarred from all sorts of bother.
"You doing okay?"Steve comes up behind Tony unexpectedly in the kitchen. He'd gotten up to get himself a drink in an act to clear his head and to get away from the commotion of so many people gathered in the livingroom. 5 people actually. Tony, Steve, Thor, Natasha and James.
"That helps."There's a pause, a smile on pretty pink lips."When are you back in New York?"
"My mum is working,"Steve shrugs."And my own friends are late shopping, I guess."
"If I'm smoking from the same packet, do you really think they're poison? C'mon, my arm is going dead."He rattles the packet in the air impatiently for James to take one, not backing down until he spots James' hand come and hesitantly take one from the packet. Tony snorts,"Thought so. Now join me."
"I can't see you! Move your thumb away from the camera!"Steve is shouting over the music to be heard, that stupid grin still on his face that never fails to make Tony feel all warm and tingly on the inside.
"I- you better be fucking kidding me."Rhodey freezes, eyes wide and hands on Tony's shoulders, jostling the younger man."Tell me you're fucking kidding me and that you did not give test subjects your prototype meal replacement shakes."
"You don't like anyone."The blond deadpans, looking over his shoulder at his best friend who seems to carry a constant air of hatred and disgust when surrounding the topic of Tony.
"Good morning Mr Barnes! Beautiful day outside, it's cold but it's that type of cold where it's just nice and crisp, with the winter sun shining and gah, I love it! Don't worry, won't keep you too long, just need to do some quick measuring, test your reflexes a bit and then you're out of here. Out that door."Tony dramatically points at the door he has just came through, closed for privacy and the inside of the door decorated in children's drawings.
"Now, I think you promised me coffee?"Tony is quick with averting the conversation before he almost spills the beans. It was one thing to have Bruce know ( and of course Bruce would know, you don't involve yourself in the world of science and technology and not know of Stark Industries, following through to everything to do about Tony Stark as well ) but to have Steve know is a totally different situation.
Tony is very good at preforming and maybe that's because his entire life has always been an act, a play, a stage show for the world to sit back, relax and enjoy as Tony stumbles over all the hurdles that life throws at him. He knows how to talk, to walk, smile and laugh in all the correct ways, he knows when to show dominance when shaking a hand and when to kiss the back of one and he definitely knows how to scan a room.
"Tell me where I'm wrong."Tony sighs with a roll of his brown eyes, rolling his head to the side in a way of boredom to cast a glance at Obadiah Stane as the man approaches. He knows well of Obadiah Stane, he's had his encounters and none of them have been pleasant.
He should've suspected that the body curled next to him was Tony, not only for the unfamiliar but familiar smell that Steve knows will linger in his bedsheets, on his pillows, on his clothes, but of his his jogged memory can recoil himself falling asleep on his bed after an argument of who gets the remaining sofa and ending up with Clint being pushed to the living room floor. Tony had been absent for awhile, carried up in a fast talking, bawdy conversation with Thor in the kitchen, but Steve can remember the teen finding his way onto Steve's bed somehow, for some reason or another.
"Uh, yeah."Tony lies, looking away from Steve. He doesn't want to admit that he doesn't celebrate Christmas, too many dark memories that he'd rather not remember or have them brought up. It didn't matter anyway, Tony spent the holidays on his own, locked away in his room with his gadgets.
"Steve, listen to me, please."Tony is almost begging, following after Steve into his home, so close to dropping to his knees, kissing his feet, beg to be listened, to explain, to wallow."You
, on the bed that had asked him a seemingly so harmless question but Tony was not fooled, no, because he may do stupid things but he was not stupid. And Tony may not have been present for Steve's sudden revelation but he had a fair idea of who was behind it.
"Well, you're not an easy person to get along with, Tony."Stephen has already started to walk away by the time Tony turns to look at the doctor, Steve out of sight and out of mind, going off to deal with his own responsibilities and duties and leaving Tony to his own.
"So where is that you'll go whenever you leave?"Steve asks out of curiosity, nearly tripping over  Tony's wires as Tony stretches out the wires of the heart monitor that chimes with ever beat of his heart.
"I asked for one thing, Steve, and that was for you to
His workshop was located in what was the basement of the abandoned warehouse, gutted from storage units and old boiler heaters so that Tony could accustom it with his advanced technology. His workshop became one of his first major projects, starting from scratch and investing all his time and money into making it his. It was where he birthed so many ideas, where he studied for his doctorate, where he created Butterfingers and U and where he created his first prototype of a prosthetic made from cybernetic technology.
"Seems to be."His reply is solemn, reserved.
"James?"Steve snorts, shifting up onto his elbow so that he's the one that's looking at Tony, sprawled out onto his back, the hoodie that he wore the night before still clung to his body and the soft blue light of his Arc reactor casting a dull light upon the bottom of his face."Nobody calls Bucky
"It could be worse, bird."Phil chimes, being the reasonable being and hanging his coat up. It wasn't soaked unlike everyone else, Phil had a remarkable skill on disappearing and reappearing in mer seconds.
"Oh he will, he thinks I'm cute."Which was an understatement because Tony has seen the way that Strange has looked at him, with deep adoration and respect, the way he would enclose Tony from behind if he was reading at a counter, protective and soft. It didn't make Tony tense, it made him feel safe and goddamnit, Tony loves it but hates it.
, James."
"I hate you all, I'm going to have snow in my ass for a week."Clint mutters as he stumbles into the Barnes household, shredding of his snow soaked clothing with it all landing in a damp pile on the floor. He has a sour look upon his face, one that makes Natasha snicker from behind her mug of coffee that Mrs Barnes had brought outside for them not that long ago. She's already sitting on the floor of the family room, watching the boys bicker of their lost.
"I made it to this one."
There's an odd type of feeling in his chest as he watches the pair interact and he isn't sure why. It's not like there's anything to get jealous of, Steve couldn't expect Tony not to get on well with anyone, especially not Bruce since they are born so interested in science. It's just, he hadn't expected Tony to hit off so well with someone and now Steve feels almost jealous at the fact that Tony isn't paying all the attention to
"Oh how I love it when you say my name, always full of affection and adoration."Tony sighs almost dramatically as the door closes behind him as he enters the office, it without blinds and so the same miserable grey clouds that Tony had woken up is in his line of vision once again, just with a different street view.
There's no answer, his voicemail box is full with frantic messages of Tony's apologies, of Tony pouring his heart out with his heart on his sleeve, a lump in his throat, a heaviness in his eyes because this is the one thing in his life that Tony doesn't want to mess up. And Tony does this, causing a mess just as his life starts to get on track, he's his own pin that pops his little perfect bubble; his own worst enemy.
strong."
Because Tony never talks, everyone knows that.
Tony has that tight, fake smile on his face that Rhodey has came accustomed too, feeling the younger man tense by his side whenever he is now the centre of attention, the chattering dying down to an uncomfortable murmur.
And Steve knows that's a damn lie, because even when he's exiting through the backdoor of his own house, he knows that Bucky will still be in the house on his return, just like he always is, wanting to escape from a house that he's never really had attention from to a house where he gets it all.
"I'll get a lift from 'Tasha."He informs, staggering off of the hard hospital bed that his mum had ushered him on whenever she spotted him sitting in the hallway, left by parametric's rim his oath staff to take care of. His injuries weren't life threatening for a doctor to be involved, and despite hospital rules about family aiding family, she had mended Steve herself.
"Buck, you're being a bit weird."Steve scoffs as he moves past Bucky's sulking frame in the doorway and moves towards the garage where the washing machine is.
Tony wakes up
It also doesn't help his case that they can be a bit overpowering. There's nothing that Steve can do about that because it's their personalities, who they are and Steve loves them for who they are and wouldn't change a thing in the world about them. What Steve doesn't have to fear is the group judging Tony for being that much of an outsider, none of them have the right to judge and neither of them would.
"What are you implying?"Tony raises his eyebrow at the blonde, feeling defensive at the thought that Steve is implying something.
. Tony looks up in alert, half expecting Steve not to have turned up and he looks terrible.
"He didn't lie to me."Steve is stubborn, he's famous for his bullheadedness, headstrong that he's right, that nothing deceives him, naivety strung to the extent that he believes in facades and false first impressions and fake smiles and oblivious to sarcasm.
person that has something against Tony, everyone else adores him."And usually, Steve is the one to stretch the truth but this time he isn't. Tony had managed to wiggle into everyone's good books, which was surprising enough when it came to a bunch of misfits like Steve's group.
"I don't know, maybe because I nearly died?"And god, that's ten scary thing to say out loud. Sure, Tony knows that he nearly died, god, he felt himself nearly dying, but it's different saying it in your head compared to saying it out loud. It makes everything feel so much more real.
And Tony hates himself for it, for the tears in his eyes, for the sobs in his throat, for the ache in his chest that he'd like to believe has only appeared, but has been present for an awfully long time. He's weak, gnawed down to the bone, brittle, vulnerable as it crashes, dawns, to him. Of the days, the weeks, the months, the years.
He never really finds out what he missed from the Biomechanics lecture, which is a shame, but instead he heads down to his Workshop that is situated among half a dozen other highly equipped ( but not as impressive as Tony's ) workshops and labs of the sort. He's greeted by the comforting smell of motor oil, the delightful sight of his messy but messy-in-the-sort-of-way-where-I-know-where-everything-is workbench and the loud excitable beeps and whirls of Dumm-E who is urgently trying to tug himself out of his charging workshop.
Thor is possibly bringing Bruce with him, I'm not sure, and Bucky lives across the road but he'll be the past one here, I'm sure of it."
There's nothing left for him, nothing that he can do, because as much as Tony loves Steve, Steve never will love him back. Not anymore.
"Hey, no, it's all good! You can help me set things up, fuck knows that my friends won't."Steve reassures with a laugh."Oh, here, shit let me take the bags. Come in, come in. Make yourself comfortable, god knows everyone else does."
"I know, I know, I'm just trying to be a good host."Steve explains, his face tinged pink in embarrassment. He really does want Tony to have a good time tonight, not only on his part but also for the sake of the whole group.
"You're not medical staff, shit, and here I am ordering you around."They nibble on their bottom lip, bringing a hand up to rest on the opposing wall for balance and using the other to run over his brow. Steve swallows thickly, taking in the little details of the teenager that is balancing on the chair.
Stark House is so much prettier than Stark Mansion, in so many different ways. It's newly furnished, with modern decor that decorates each room and surrounded by windows, and bright, natural light that gives the entire house a beautiful, handsome, gentle vibe. The house itself is positioned on a cliffside, overlooking the beautiful private white sand beach below and the dark blue waves of ocean that stretches out for miles and miles, a perfect view with a perfect sunset every evening and sunrise every morning.
With shaking hands, Tony is reaching into the pocket of his suit, pulling out his packet of cigarettes and cherished lighter. He pulls a cigarette out of the packet, stuffing it back into his pocket as the cigarette dangles between his lips. Leaning against the side of the brick, Tony is flicking the lighter, bringing it up to the cigarette.
The story of How Tony meets Steve starts in the hospital, with a 16 year olds life on the line with 3rd degree burns and pieces of shrapnel digging into his chest, aiming for his heart and slowly but surely killing him. Tony didn't look like Tony, the 3rd degree burns that was attacking his flesh made him look almost zombie like, too scary for his mother to look at without screaming in terror of what has happened to her son.
"Are you hungry? I bet you're hungry. I'll tell one of the chefs to cook you up something. Something small, snackish, cheese grills? Yeah okay."Tony dodges, babbling away as he grabs at Rhodey's arm."Come on, you're bunking with me."
Sarah is by far the best nurse in the hospital, and most likely the only one that doesn't either hate Tony's guts for being an attention seeking whore or love the teenager just because he has enough money to be showering in it. She's a pretty, smart and independent woman who dotes over Tony, treats him like a son and listens to everything that he tells her with the same amount of enthusiasm and excitement as Tony.
"You're going to get me arrested one day, brat."
"I'm not joking!"Steve says a little too urgently, noticing the way that Tony's voice flatters in unsureness. Tony flinches at the loud voice, finding himself reeled back to reality."That's really fucking impressive, I mean, like
Being good with people isn't on the top of Tony's agenda, and that's mostly for the fact that Tony Stark may be a social butterfly but that does
Howard, who Tony believed held his own type of deranged sadness in the forms of alcohol and abuse, did not hold back on expressing that by the age of 7, Tony had no right to be crying over scraped knees or in want of a hug when he was feeling extremely sad, or upset, or down.
"Fuck you. Fuck you all. I'm taking these out now."Clint huffs, lips pouted out as he makes a move to take the hearing aids out of his ears so that he can't listen to
"That's why I left."Steve looks away for a moment, watching as they past cars and street lamps. It's still early in the morning, he has a lot of things to do today."I just hadn't expected him to be there and when I recognised who it was- I don't know, just something within me just switched. He looked so
."He gestures aggressively to his phone."You could have anyone you wanted and you're pinning on this guy? I wouldn't be surprised that he has more STIs than a seat in a clinic."
There will be no one for Tony Stark at his final fall.
"Why didn't you call me?"
"Is he okay? Buck, is he okay? Nothing is wrong with him, right? The experiment can continue?"A sudden voice is asking frantically and Tony doesn't need to turn his head to know who that voice belongs to, but he does anyway. Steve stands in all his glory beside him at the station, 6 feet plus in height and weighted shoulders that could surely lift and carry Tony off somewhere far far away.
was painful to look at."Tony's whole body is relaxed, tongue sharp and eyes playful, so many mixed signals that someone could go with.
"California? How do you manage to afford that?"Steve asks in curiosity, head tilted in that puffy dog type of fashion that Tony has quickly grown to love. It makes the big guy seem to curious and innocent, haven't yet been exposed to all of the ugliness that is Tony Stark.
"We have no conversation to continue."Steve declares, fixing the scarf around his neck and pulling the hat over his head.
"Stevie says you're in college, some massive brainiac apparently."Bucky speaks up just as Tony has gotten up from where he was sitting and starting to walk back into the house, not liking the idea of his lips turning physically blue with coldness.
Steve has never been more thankful for the Burger King that was situated directly in front of the hospital that his mum works in, because as much as Steve dislikes burgers - and fries, and anything that is deep-fat-fried-in-heart-attack-oil - having the Burger King there made it a lot easier for him to take it across to the hospital for Tony, as somewhat of a peace offering to the young teen.
Steve has become haunted in more ways than one.
"I know that I'm below the height of the average male but I think you'd need at least 3 plastic bags to wrap my body in."He isn't that small, a little below the average height but he makes up for lack of height with his overlarge ego. Tony groans, leaning his face into his hands."If you're going to kill me, do it quick, it feels like someone is dancing on my brain and I think I'm going to puke which is not something that Starks do."
finished this conversation."Bucky turns, glaring at Steve who rolls his eyes, shrugging on his jacket and zipping it up.
"You're a friend of Anthony?"
"C'mon, sweetheart, let your hair down."Ty sighs dreamingly, brushing off Tony's snark and advancing forward, the tips of his fingers brushing across Tony's smooth cheek. That smile creeps up upon Tiberius' lips, that same luring smile that had introduced Tony into the world of clubs and drugs and sex and it makes his stomach scrunch up in nausea.
"I don't think that's quiet believable Sir, you are not found in the office even when you
it, he feels every single piece of fear that his mother holds, every single piece of her motherly instinct in the room that tries to convince him not to go, not to sign up, not to leave her. And she isn't being selfish because really, no mother truly is, and she's doing it for her son, even if he doesn't realise it yet.
"It's completed."
"You keep looking at your phone as if he's about to do something magnificent. The most a phone like that can do is survive a 100 foot drop off a building."
A prime example of people like that are Tiberius Stone, a fellow MIT student 5 years older than what Tony is. It hadn't taken long for Tony to understand that all of Tiberius's flirty gestures and free drinks was all for the sake of getting into Tony's pants, all and hoping for Tony to scream out SI secrets in bed. It was a pity that Tony found out that Ty was a spy for his own father, especially when he's so hot.
"You're awake,"There's someone new in his private hospital room, tall, slim built and on the wrong side of 40. Tony has filled with the Hospital bed enough to have it elevated in a way that the thing sticking out of his chest isn't causing him any pain and it allows him to see around the rather dull room.
The New Years midnight excitement has now disappeared into the night sky, but it wasn't as if Tony had did anything spectacular the celebrate the night anyway, he usually never does unlike his Parents who had already left that morning to spend a week or two on one of the islands that they own in the Caribbean. So Tony was left on his own, just like he is every New Years, with nothing but the bitter cold of New York and the glow of the arc reactor to keep him company.
But he doesn't blame her. Peggy had gotten a promotion, realised that she had to do something more in her life than hanging around New York all of the time, so she moved with her promotion to Washington and started up her new life, away from Tony, and away from all of her old memories. That didn't mean he hadn't seen her or heard from her, because Tony did, just not as much as he wishes, especially during the times that he really needed her.
"You are the
"That's very sweet of you,"She sighs, shaking her head at the kindness of the teenager that sits on the bed."I will be back in half an hour. I expect all of this food to be gone when I return, medication and all."She gives him a smile before leaving the hospital room, closing the door behind her.
"That's too long, Buck."Steve is looking at Barnes frantically as if the thought of having to be hospitalised repeatedly for a year if going to be a burden to him more so than for Barnes who meets Steve's eyes but not his emotion.
inside of his chest.
"Alarming, I know. I've an incredibly good memory for the small details. Not so much for the important stuff, however."Tony is beyond hyper and he can't even blame it on the coffee he drank in the car over, or the one he bought at the Hospital entrance, or the one Strange gave him at the desk or even the one he's been sipping at in between rushed, rambled sentences because Tony has always been like this. "Right, where did I leave my- aha! Okay Mr Barnes, shirt off."
By the end of the shopping trip, Tony can't really say that he didn't enjoy it. Steve kicks up a fuss at every other food item, and by the others he's just amazed by the different varieties of biscuits and crisps, the size of Nutella jars and the changes of Coca Cola bottles. They end up buying more than they had too but Tony doesn't mind, he has money to burn and doesn't mind spending it on Steve if it makes the Super Solider Happy.
"You're disgusting."But there's a smile tugging at the corner of his lips, pushing his falling glasses back up his nose. He had been working on a paper before he was rudely interrupted. However, despite the interruption, Bruce was kind of happy for it. He hasn't heard from Tony in a while, not since Tony had miraculously thought up of a new cybernetic technology that he could advance into his prosthetics.
"Nothing it is."
At this point in time, Tony would like to say he wished he did attend for once in his life, because then maybe he wouldn't be waking up from a 2 day comma and be feeling like some sort of groggy zombie who has just been shaken away from a peaceful slumber. His body is stiff and sore, there's an ache in his chest that has never been there and his skin was hot, hard and aching.
want people to feel sorry for him that he spends Christmas Day alone, locked in a workshop and AC/DC, he doesn't want that suburban family Christmas with a Christmas tree and present giving, eating food around a table like a
"Stay out of trouble."She sighs in defeat, watching as Tony smiles whenever she puts the money back into her pocket.
"Tony, I can't just take your backpack."
"We're not talking."
"You should critic less."He rolls his eyes, fingers dancing on the workshop bench before sighing."I forgot to call."
"Ouch."All three wince in sympathy because that's the closet that Bruce will ever be to getting in touch with his inner emotions. Bruce and Betty had been a big deal, especially for Bruce who had a lot of problems with letting people into his life. They'd been dating for 2 years when Betty announced her early graduations and going off to university in Europe. It'd struck Bruce hard, even if it didn't look like it did.
The 'bot gives Tony another long
"Me?"
But of course, that was a man that Tony had never met, a stranger that's only remembered in newspaper clippings and neatly kept scrapbooks that Maria Stark has kept treasured in the library for years. Now, the Man that was once, has been replaced with one that Maria has had to grown to get use to, and a man that Tony wishes that he never knew.
He puts it on, out of nagging sorrow and spilling sadness, it's too big.
"Ouch."Rhodey makes a pained sound in sympathy. It took no genius to know that Tony didn't get on well with his parents, especially his father that Tony barely spoke word about, and if he did, it was always in babbled sentences in the middle of the night after Tony was shook awake from a nightmare.
It was his home, made with Tony quirks and cluttered genius but in a way, elegant and expensive with a magnificent view of the Hudson River and amazingly crafted skylight on the ceiling. Tony loved his home, he loved The Warehouse because for once in his life it was something that was
But, it's fun, in a sort of way that Tony hasn't felt in a while, and it's harmless. They flirt, and that's
"I thought you were phoning me about the cybernetic prosthetic, Tony."Bruce looks bored or maybe that's just Tony's paranoia sneaking through as he quickly swipes his projections to keep Bruce's interests alive.
"Maybe."Steve shrugs his broad shoulders, his t-shirt tight and smaller than it should be. He's came along way from the sickly skinny boy that he use to be, but still a long way from becoming the man that he's training to be."I was actually going to ask who it was in my bed, but I've figured out that answer pretty quickly."
"You're going to get me in trouble,"She shakes her head, setting the tray down onto a table that will come up over the bed for Tony.
"I thought you weren't talking."There's a pause in her reply and Steve almost sees her hesitate, mull over the silence and the months and years it has been since Natasha and Bucky were on
And Rhodey knows that, he knows that when Tony makes up his mind then that is that, and if Tony isn't going to speak then he has to deal with that, and instead make up to him with the soft touches and attention that he knows Tony craves. Because he's a good friend, he best of friend that Tony could ask for, and it pains him to watch him walk through the airport security away from him, with nothing but a murmur to text him and a promise to meet him at the airport.
"If this proceeds, you're going to need to quit smoking, along with other things but I'm sure we will have lengthy discussions about that in the future."Tony is suddenly reminded and he hates how hypocritical that he sounds because Tony himself had been giving a lengthy discussion about what he was supposed to do and what he was not when fitted with the Arc Reactor and Tony was not someone you told what to do."We're going to be seeing a lot of each other, so if I were you, I'd reconsider your choice of asset."
"Sorry for the mess, hasn't been gutted since summer."Tony apologises because despite his attempts to clean up whenever Rhodey told him of him arriving, it still, wasn't enough to clean up the sheets of paper and forgotten mugs that once contained coffee.
Rhodey; Tony's little angel. The guy was a saviour that pulled him out of ditches and held the bucket while Tony threw up until his stomach was turned inside out. Tony must've done something good in a past life to deserve Rhodey, to have the older man take him under his wing and make sure that he didn't die of alcohol poisoning or get fucked up behind a frat house.
"That's, that's a pretty large bunch."Tony swallows thickly, glad to have the bag of crisps in his hands to fiddle with, something that only makes his nerves more known to Steve who looks on with a frown of concern.
had grown into a
Lucky enough, Howard and Maria were on the drive back from the annual Stark ball when the explosion happened, and even luckier that Tony was home and that no one else was in Stark mansion whenever it happened or he would never forgive himself for the Injury of others. He'd rather risk the death of himself over the death of others he cared for.
"Yeah."Tony nods,"Just dump whatever inside onto the table."He instructs, already turning back to finish up the heart monitor, screwing down the back of it. Steve follows the instructions, dumping the clothes that was inside of it onto the table and not being able to help the grin whenever a pair of Tony's coffee themed boxers fall out,
"Maybe I was and you've just knocked my confidence down a peg or two."His face flushes a coy pink, over the bridge of his nose and to the tips of his ears. The idea had been planted into his head a while ago back but never having the opportunity.
other than that.
"I haven't seen snow in so long,"Which was true, and it couldn't be blamed for Tony being in hospital. Winter break meant a winter vacation, one that Tony would try and opt out of but seemed to always fail to do so. The Starks have many homes across the world, in warm and cold locations. He would guess that's where his Mum and Howard are now, on their private island in the Caribbean.
"It is."Tony's voice holds emotion that Steve is only realising now. He turns, oddly white glasses been moved onto the bridge of his nose as he looks up at Steve with a reassuring smile."But don't worry, we can still chat. It's not as if I'm going to Mars or something. Honestly, I'm not going to lose my second friend due to where I study."
But then again, he can say that he's use to it, it would explain why he always gets this bubbling, unfamiliar feeling in the pit of his stomach every time that Rhodey says thank you for buying the pizza that week, or when Steve tells him that his work is impressive. He doesn't get that at home, he never has. Since the moment he was able to toddle and babble, Howard has been expecting great things, and in some ways he has achieved a son that has all the brains and good looks, but is still a fuck up in the eyes of a father.
Peggy Carter was a massive part of Tony's life, from the minute that he had been born, Tony had spent more time in his Aunt Peggy's arms than his own Mothers. She had carried him on his shoulders through shopping centres, took him to the park, was at all of his Science fairs and took him traveling during the school holidays. Peggy Carter was his Godmother, his only childhood friend and it has hurt when she exited his life.
"This isn't for the garbage, it's for you after I kill you and I need to dispose of your body."
"-to pick up your pieces."Tony only hears the tail-end of what Obie is ranting about, monologuing the hardships of being Howard Starks right hand man which also means being limbered as being Tony Starks personal babysitter."I do this all for you, m'boy."
long, has it?"Ty looks generally surprised and come to think of it, it has been that long since he and Ty last spoke, last saw one another and mingled in each other's company. Tiberius had found him on the balcony, Tony had just been made Times Magazine Man Of The Year and Tiberius was all but thrilled to buy him a couple of congratulatory drinks. They had talked, they had drank, they had fucked and then he was gone. Until now, of course.
"Not exactly great, no."They're both silent because Steve doesn't really want to talk but Bucky really does want him to, which is a dynamic that the two of them have never really worked out the kinks to. Both, however, hate dragged silences but Steve hates them more."She's more upset than she is mad at the decision, and right okay, I
"Can I kiss you?"
"Which do you like?"Tony asks.
is full of confessions or worries or spitfire angered profanities that leave either or both parties huddled in hurt or betrayal or embarrassment. A
He knows of the reasons of his discharge, he knows because he was told quite frankly one dusky evening that the army was discharging him with honours, with medals and a fancy Sargent Captain title, whereas Bucky had told him of the real reason, the reason that for the life of Steve, he cannot remember is.
"Tony,"Strange sighs deeply through his nose, fingers at his temples for a moment."I'm telling you that from what I've seen through photographic evidence alone is that we may be able to carry through with the specs of creating the first
his husband of 6 years, that we can't get a dog because I'm
"Look, I'll pay for your flight, just don't let me go to this dinner alone."Tony near enough begs, kicking his suitcase under his bed, shifting the boxes that have a home underneath his bed that Tony doesn't trust to be put into storage. He'd rather have his old blueprints and little gadgets under his bed where he knows that they are instead of some Stark Industries storage unit where he's sure Howard and Obi will steal his ideas.
"Dork,"Tony rolls his eyes, unable to help the feeling of fondness that suddenly rushes through his chest or the odd blush that he can feel heating his cheeks. Tony bites his bottom lip, shaking his head to rid himself of the unfamiliar feeling that has seemed to take over his mind and chest, moving to focus his attention on throwing his wallet back into the drawer and closing it.
It's a coffee hut, and if course it is. Open 24-7 from the looks of it, quiet other than the soft bristle of late night/early morning radio and the chime of the bell that rings every time someone pushes open the front door. It's warm inside, cosy and nice, with little to no people in the coffee hut than a handful of business men and a figure that's huddled in the far corner.
"No. This is obviously fake."Is Steve's first reaction, scoffing, shaking his head, pushing the phone out from his face because that can't be Tony, not
"Me too, but that didn't bother me much growing up."Steve shrugs."Bucky lives right next door, has since we were tots."
that you're spending time in our dorm."
Steve had become haunted, a ghost floating above the empty husk that was his own body, his own mind, his own conscious. But he had nowhere else to turn to because the friends that he had had gained their own lives, new and exciting and just as dangerous as his own has become, and he couldn't bare to be a burden to his mother, hardworking in her older age. And so, Steve toured again, and again.
"Ignore him, it's what he does. I'll talk to him."Steve has to suppress a sigh but he doesn't hold back on the roll of his eyes. Bucky has always been that type of friend, the one that goes out of his way to make anyone new who gets close to his best friend as uncomfortable as possible. Steve was use to it by now because every single one of their shared friends have went through the same treatment, Tony just seems to be getting it rougher than the rest had.
"Yes, Mr Rogers, that's correct. 27 days is nearly a month."
"That's, you can't be serious, Tony. He needs me in there."Steve looks eccentric and maybe that's because he's been running about like a headless chicken all morning for his bullheaded best friend and now he's being told that he's not allowed to be with him. Steve didn't see any signs that informed him on hospital policies, nor was any passing nurse quick to telling him of them either.
"Hey! Peggy is a healthy girl and there's hundreds of mileage left on her, she's going to be around for a long time."Natasha and everybody else hopes, seeing as Peggy is this only means of transportation for late night McDonalds or when coming back from a party. They all pitch in to pay for gas and repairs and despite all the money they would try and scrap together they wouldn't be able to afford a new car.
your fault."It's mocking, of course, because Tony has lead his life believing and being told that everything is his fault, in manners that don't show him off in a good light and make him out as the spoilt little brat that the media loves to portray him as."And I'll fix this, for a price, however."
"Steve. What are you doing here?"Sarah asks in a rushed tone whenever she spots her son stalking down the hallways, peering into random private rooms as subtle as someone who is over 6 feet tall can. She's rushing to get to the otherside of the hospital, with notes clutched in her hand that are crucially needed.
"Good, so that means we have 6 hours to grab everything that we need for a party- cake, balloons, party hats, the whole shabam!"
Okay honestly; they don't exactly say how old any of Buckys sisters are, I know that they are all younger than he is, and there's only one official name (from the comics) which is Rebecca (which will be around age 11). I'm going to follow the R theme and have Rachel (at age 6) and Rose (age 3).
"Why do you have to be so mean to your sisters?"Steve rolls his eyes, taking the tall glass from Buckys grip.
"I figured it out, Brucie!"Tony had proceeded to shove the StarkTab in Bruce's un-expecting face, the man taking it and scanning its contents, brow creased. "It hit me last night, or the day before, I can't remember but it was like some sort of
Whatever this trouble is, exactly, is unknown.
Dramatically, Clint is setting them on the coffee table with a clank, huffing a breath as he pulls the bag of marshmallows forward and settles into Natashas warmth seeing as she's the only human in the room that isn't being mean to him.
"Pick up, pick up, c'mon Steve."Half of Tony's attention is on the road, fingers drumming impatiently on the wheel, eyes darting from the road to his phone that's rested upon his thigh, desperate, begging Steve to answer his phone. If Tony keeps driving the way he is, he could make it to Brooklyn by tomorrow night, if he only stops for gas and to use the bathroom.
"This doesn't look like an absence of my life, Mr. Stane."Tony hisses, his throat raw and his mouth dry with the vivid taste of cigarette ash and vodka left on his tongue. The room won't stop spinning, his mind running to catch up on current events and every time that he blinks he sees double.
"Tony-"
thing, it's just an annoying thing. Why can't the men in my life be straight to the point? Life would just be so cut easier if Phil just told me I can't have a dog because I'm deaf."
. Tony could talk for hours to Strange about his ideas, his inventions and dreams and as much as Strange was smart, he didn't understand. But Bruce did.
"I don't care. And besides, who's going to listen to you."The paparazzi weren't exactly besting down doors and crossing police lines to get an interview with Tiberius Stone and neither was his word worth anything either. Sure, the tabloids got a kick of plastering his handsome face over their front page now and again but even at that, it's rare for him to be plastered on the front page. Page 10 maybe.
"I'll always be here for you, Tones."
Tony should be shocked to have a Super Solider to ask for permission to entire the engineers workshop only for Tony to grant him the access and then get dragged out with a hand under his elbow and arm bent in a way that made the man squirm and huff because he was not up to fighting a super solider.
He feels that, the slipping away, and it had started a lot earlier than this moment, but he's coming to the end of the sand, the end of caring, the end of his family which had never really been a family to begin with, but it was nice to say it out loud in times that he'd wanted to believe. And the sand is pouring, and he's slipping away out to sea, adrift from himself because everyone around him leaves, or joins the army, or is
Tony doesn't want Steve to know, he doesn't want that toxic knowledge to corrupt what angelic persona that Steve has obviously seemed to dream up when it comes to Tony. He doesn't want Steve to look at him any more differently than what he does now, he doesn't want that special treatment, the dancing around, the turned up faces, the muttering comments of all of the shameful, disgusting, embarrassing situations that Tony has gotten himself into.
"I'm going to come back, Mom."Steve isn't sure if he's reassuring himself or Sarah when he speaks those words, half way between being numb about the whole ideal and being ecstatic about it as well.
Bucky's talking animatedly, hands moving, lips shaping, torso heaving about...something. Steve is just trying to focus on waking up, beady eyes squinting at the alarm clock on his bedside table,
"Of course I am."Rhodes rolls his eyes fondly, allowing himself to be dragged towards the stairs with his backpack and suitcase in tow."Doesn't your house have like 20 bedrooms?"
"Come. Please. My friends would love to meet you, they've been pestering me about it for ages now."Steve continues with his own blush coating his cheeks, something that Tony brushes off as the cold wind that Steve is getting from being outside. The music from the party is still blasting some latest pop anthem that neither Tony or Steve know of.
"I'm sorry but, but Tony, I can't do that. I can't do that for you."The tablet is being set down on the counter in disbelief and astonishment, Bruce suddenly feeling cold to his core, especially when he sees Tony's face. "Tony, I'm so happy and so proud for you but- but I can't be apart of your research team, and I truly can't lead your work. It's not mine. It's not my
Tony thought about those times a lot as he waited in the caves, plotting an escape after what had to be weeks that had passed and there looked to be no means of anyone coming to rescue him. Tony hadn't expected anything different. Obie may have been swiping his messes under the carpet for years but he's been looking for opportunities to grabble for the company since Howard died. The kidnapping of Tony was the perfect opportunity to grab the company, tell the presses they were searching, throwing money at all sorts of field agents and search rescue teams, slowing inching his way into the favours of board members, all while Tony suffered and died in these caves.
And a long time ago, Tony use to laugh at Jarvis' scepticism or his fathers paranoia or how his mom use to always linger in the door frame any time that Obie was caught alone in a room with Tony. Now, Tony wishes that he took all of those hints, the red flags, to heart because he wouldn't have ended up in so many of the situations that he has in the past, and he wouldn't be here right now.
"Ha! You've obviously never played video games with me and Rhodey. He tries to tell me that I'm a sore loser, which I'm not by the way so don't be fooled by my act of acting like I am, when he got so angry that he kept getting killed that he threw my PlayStation out the window. I made him climb out our door window in the rain to retrieve it."
, is exactly what he needs, even if it is for a few days in a war withered country to make PR happy, and by extension the ugly head that is Obie, happy too.
"It's that too,"The corners of his mouth pick up in a smirk, lips pressed to the rim of the beer bottle."We're celebrating Bucks prosthetic, dude! Or well, hopeful prosthetic, he's so fucking secretive man and then Phil is so loyal- which isn't a
But nevertheless if Steve had felt all those emotions, that he had felt more battered and bruised in those last moments he had with Tony than any street fight or scrap he had been involved in, he still
. Tony's brains were not being overlooked and neither was his skill, his talent to create, to think, to
Or, he doesn't even make it to his bedroom, nor does he find himself waking up in his workshop, but haven collapsed somewhere between the elevator to the bedroom, sometimes the livingroom, mostly the couch. There, he'd wake up in the worst state, because those types of states where he finds himself waking up on the sofa is only because he was too intoxicated to get to the bedroom, and that comes hand in hand with haven made a scene from one place to another. Which, unfortunately so, means a wake up call from Obie because bad press of Tony is bad press for S.I.
He had been dragged to view various toys, make up sets, paint supplies, books from the minute breakfast had finished until the traditional Christmas Dinner was being served at 4 in the afternoon. He had been set in between Bucky and Rachel, with one ear being filled with absolute  garbage about how Barbie is way better than Bratz and the other the swear of how embarrassing the Barnes family is.
"I'm clean! I promise!"Tony raises his hands up in surrender, taking a step away from Rhodey who continues to give him that disapproving look that he has seemed to develop over the time he's known Tony Stark."Well, I've been doped up on Morphine for like 3 weeks but I'm clean of weed, and cocaine-"
"Black, two sugars."Tony speaks as he does, pulling the foam cup forward and picking up two sugar sachets. Steve nods, taking the other and adding another pod of milk into it as well as some sugar."If any of the nursing staff ask, you didn't get me any of this, alright? They'll have you head and my ass on a plate."
"Heart condition,"Tony rolls his eyes, bringing the cup up to his nose and almost melting at the the heavenly scent of coffee that invades his senses. The foam cup his warm in his hands, warming up his body."I'm literally recovering from open heart surgery and having a super magnet fitted into my chest to save my life from being dying of shrapnel stabbing me in the heart. Of fucking course I'm not allowed cheeseburgers or coffee, not for the mean time anyway-"
Tony comes back 128 days later
and by the way, when I calculated, could take months to complete."
But this is Steve. His
Alcohol numbs the pain, but only for awhile, Tony learns the hard way. He's on a strangers bathroom floor the next time that it happens. He's 21. Legal. Flying solo for the first time in his life without the weight of a company on his shoulders because Howard is gone for Christmas and he's taken Mom, and Obie has taken responsibility because god knows Tony isn't going to stay sober over Christmas, never mind New Years.
, was a shifty fucker just as he suspected from the start. And so he pushes it down, because he was

type of way.
"I know."He's swift with his actions, almost delicate on his feet as he swerves away from the sharp shoulder and around, eying up the bar that is so plainly in his sight before he's grabbed the attention of a Senator or a suitor that Obie still loves to dangle in front of his eyes every once in a while, hoping that Tony will settle down with a gorgeous Dutches or a wealthy arms manufacturer, for his sake and not for Tony's.
Tony gasps at the contact, eyes flung open in his shock and mouth agape with his sharp intake of air. There's water droplets caught to his eye lashes, locks of his hair stuck to his forehead and he can feel the cold water drip off of his chin and onto the bare flesh of his chest, bloodshot red eyes flickering up to look at his assaulter and feeling his stomach drop.
"So are you going to tell me what that was all about or should I just head home?"Bruce had asked when Doctor Strange has left, Tony turning sharply around with a gasp.
He had done a remarkable job of cleaning himself up, despite the fact that from a quarter past 11 that morning, he had found himself sitting at the island of his kitchen with the fail at company of a bottle of his favoured whiskey. By a quarter to 3 it was half gone and by 7, it was gone in its entirety with only but the remains staining the bottom of Tony's favoured crystal tumblr that he continued to twirl from hand to hand, stuck in his own thoughts.
It doesn't take Tony long to get himself settled into his workshop routine, of letting Jarvis scan his emails for ones marked IMPORTANT and URGENT and for Tony to glance at them himself, deeming them either not of his time and pass them along to Pepper or ones he can complete in a matter of minutes without hassle. Jarvis has taken it to himself to create a To Do list of work because Tony may not like being told what to do but he sure does like having tasks to complete or else he will fall down a swampy rabbit hole of meaningless work.
"Oh, save it."Tony rolls his eyes, peering up at Bucky through his thick rimmed glasses, the cigarette dangling from the corner of his lip as fishes out the remainder packet of cigarettes from his hoodie pocket, holding them out to the mysteriously edgy looking teenager."Join me, if you wish."
That doesn't happen, of course.
"I can't remember, was this supposed to be a weekend of just the two of us or did I spontaneously agree to having 300 of your
"You're a dick."
Tony has always been one that treasured the moments of sleep, mostly because sleep wasn't something that came on his plate often nor was he the best at staying asleep when it did come around. But when it does, he adores it, treasures the moment of sleep where you're so deep in sleep that you don't dream, that you wake up with sleep heated cheeks, messy hair and a brain so fogged and hazy that it's like coming out of your own personal oasis.
"It matters to my fucking nostrils, get in the shower. Now."
Plus, if Tony was to someday become a super villain, Bruce will totally be on his mind to ya,e over the world with.
"Whatever. I'm taking Bruce's advice and not coming off
It started with Jarvis
The groups approval of Tony wasn't exactly needed but it sure did help the tight knots of fear that had been settled inside of Steve since the beginning of that afternoon that Tony had came over. To Steve, Tony meant a lot to him, and having his friends ( or most of his friends, anyway ) think that Tony was the good guy that Steve knows him as, it means a lot.
Natasha had been unnerving, although strangely kind and almost sympathetic whenever she had approached Tony, as if she could see everything that he's been through and more. It was unsettling to say the least but she hadn't brought anything up and instead thrusted a bottle of vodka into his hands with a smile and left to annoy James.
Barging into his own workshop, Tony is waving off Dumm-E's attempts of greeting his welcome back and immediately reaching into his pocket for his mobile phone. It takes little to no time for his finger to have pressed onto Steve's contact, the familiar dial tone fresh in his ear, replacing the pulsing race of his pulse and blood that was previously circulating there.
"You don't know me."
Tony is close and bolting the bedroom door before Howard can reply, knowing that the man has so much more to say but willing to bite his tongue to say it all tonight. Interactions with Howard is never pleasant and Tony wants to keep them to a minimal for the rest of his life, or hopefully for the rest of Howard's life.
"Enough about me! I'm sure you're sick of hearing about me, god knows the media loves to talk, I'm an interesting person after all. I want to hear about you! Tell me, Dr Banner, what has been going on in that beautiful mind of yours?"
"Capsicle? Where did that nickname come from?"
"What do you mean it's
"Your mum is so pissed off,"Bucky mumbles, not even looking up at Steve. He's curled under the sheets and has been since 3 in the afternoon, only moving to pee or to raid the Rogers fridge. Bucky is a handsome teen, with longing black hair that Steve almost begs for his best friend to cut and amazing steel blue eyes that seem to have every shade of blue and grey that is possible. At over 6 feet tall, Bucky is both someone to fear but yet the biggest softy with a passion for baking.
Joseph Rogers was a man that Steve hated the sound of his name, the man had left when Steve was 10, walked out the door after slapping around his mother for the years of their marriage. Steve was glad that he was gone, he was a waste of a father and an even shittier husband. His mum deserved better, she deserved the moon, she believed that whatever Steve wanted to do, or be, where ever he'll go, that he'll have a good life and that's all the support he needed.
"Asshole."There's a glare in his eyes as he turns to look at Stephen, walking towards him once he has deemed himself presentable enough to meet with the patient. Tony is always one for first impressions, or second impressions of the first goes as one usually does when Tony is involved. A Stark Tablet is tucked under his armpit, slender and light and everything Tony needs, a separate tablet than the one for S.I related work and that of his personal tablet too.
were the one that left when you saw the Arc Reactor and you were the one that came back so don't fucking stand there and act as if I was the one that came and flipped your life onto its head."Tony shakes with anger, fists trembling, body jittery as he marches after Steve who pauses, turns sharply on heels.
"Ms.Potts, it's fantastic that you've made it. You look divine!"Tony throws his arms open in a gesture for Pepper to come forward, welcoming and charming as Pepper steps into the open space of his arms so that Tony can place a hand on her waist and another on her arm, leaning forward to press a kiss to her cheek for show. He can feel the eyes on the back of his head. He's late. He's drunk. Everybody knows it.
His workshop, where his favourite mug is usually stranded, filled with cold, old coffee or sometimes stuffed with pens and rubber bands that he keeps for the sole purpose of entertaining Dumm-E when he's bored. His favourite mug that lives in his workshop and hasn't been taken out since...since-
- Phil has the audacity to tell me,
SuperHero. The word still felt weird rolling off the tip of his tongue and just didn't settle right in Tony's stomach. Tony didn't feel like a hero, he didn't feel like someone who deserved such a title as there were many people across the world who have fought in wars, saved people's lives and didn't even get a damn mention never mind a medal. Tony was just Tony, a man in his late thirties with billions in the bank, a brain in his head and the ability to create machinery and suits that even impressed himself.
Okay, Tony is making the last one up but he swears he heard one of Howard's business partners ask that to Howard behind his back.
"And this looks like another one of your silly, immature games, m'boy."There's a sly twist of his lips, as if this moment is something that he has been anticipating since the moment he left him stranded in that hotel room, their promise something to be broken because Tony never changes his habits and Stane knows all of his weaknesses.
"Well, are you?"
His hospital room is blanked in darkness, the blinds drawn closed in his room and the only light source being the light coming off of his - christened - 'Stark Phone' with AC/DC playing to his left from a portable speaker that was hidden in one of the drawers beside his hospital bed. There had already been nurses round to give him one dose of medication, another not scheduled until later.
"MIT?"
"What happened to being on my side?"Clint pouts, a hearing aid left on the kitchen table and his good ear listening to Phil. Tony can vaguely remember being told about Clint being somewhat deaf and he must be a pretty good lip reader from what Tony can pick up because Clint hadn't missed a beat of their conversation from the night before until this morning.
Okay, so he doesn't know where he is but he damn well knows he's Tony Stark.
"How's your mom?"He asks tenderly, watching as Steve sighs, his chest rising and falling heavily, eyes turning from the window to Bucky who sits a desk diagonal from him, slanted in a chair and long dark hair falling over his face a little.
"Have a drink waiting for me, Ms.Potts."
"Hey, Buck."
"I'm not."Steve deadpans, casting a glance back at the house and then back to the camera so that he can see Tony. He had stolen Phils phone to be able to video call Tony, seeing as his phone was unable to do that and that he wanted to wish Tony a Happy New Years face to face as best as he could."Somebody opened their mouth about a free house and eventually the entire school found out."
"Of course not, sir, it's just general knowledge."
"That's where you're very wrong,"
"So you agree with him! You are all conspiring against me because I'm deaf! Using me for the disable badge, for the sympathy card, for the-"
"Sweet on. Who's the gal? Or is it a fella?"
"I'm so fucked, Steve."He finally whispers after a long stretch of silence, fingers enclosed at the fabric around the dirty hoodie that he wears, close to where the soft blue of the arc reactor can be seen through the material.
"Let's be real, Clint is going to be the first to die."
"You don't need to, you
"Clint, what the fuck were you doing on my roof?"Bucky shouts, getting out of the recliner. Steve is following suit, already reaching for his jacket, scarf and hat.
Tony had been elbow deep into a cars engine at the time, engine grease not only staining the material of his jeans or tank top, but smeared into the skin of his cheeks, of his arms, glued into his hair as he tried to reach for a bolt that was smack in the middle of the old cars engine. The car itself, is a mess, unkept and unloved by its owner and they're lucky that Tony is kind enough, and bored enough, to take the old Chevy off of their hands for a couple hundred bucks so he could tamper with it and sell it off for a couple of thousand instead.
"It'll keep you warm."Bucky smirks, taking a gulp from his own glass. He sets the glass onto the side table, knowing he'll get a yelling at by his mom for not using a coaster."And it's Christmas, live a little Stevie."
He dreads the dinner, despite the fact that Rhodey will be there because he knows that he's going to be shown around the guests like some prized cattle, with them wanting to poke and prod and lay attention to the Arc Reactor that is nestled in Tony's chest. They're going to want to ask questions, talk to Tony about his education as if they give a shit of what he wants to do in life.
"Good idea."Steve nods, not even minding whenever Clint is basically nuzzling his face into Steve's and mutters of his pretty that Tony looks, something that makes Steve warm all over."I bid you goodnight."
But he pushes down the guilty, self-loathing part of himself that rears it's ugly head during random parts of his day, when he's away on a jog or with his arm draped over Natasha's shoulders as they watch a film on the couch. It makes him tense, it makes him feel rotten, it makes him think that maybe he shouldn't have been so filled with smugness and eager to gloat that Tony,
"Steve, wake up, this is not the time to be sleeping, get up! Now!"Steve is shoved harshly at the shoulder, at the side, his stomach, his chest, gripped at the shoulders and jostled awake until there's throwing arms and grumbling words and lights flickering on in the small bedroom of Steve Rogers. The light blinds, Steve hisses, flinches from the light as he tries to blink and adjust, barely making out the figure that lurks at his bedside with longing hair in their face and a phone waving about in their hands.
"You've a press conference to go to first, an interview after that and then there's a brief. You've missed a lot since your...absence. Stane wants you caught up to speed and get you straight back to work. The StarkTab production was put on hold, they had to push the new Stark Expo to fall instead of summer and don't even get me started on the military department, Stane has been up to his eyeballs without you."
"Leave them alone, it's good to see Bruce so happy. He's been so upset since Betty left."
"You're paranoid."Pepper had told him when he had dumped a stack of files onto her desk, filled with information about every single person who had glanced at the Stark Industries data frame that one time Obie decided to modernise the system, exposing the  S.I's date frame for literal seconds before Tony had swooped in and saved the day. The list stretched to multiple pages, however, and Tony's one glance at the names had told him exactly what he needed to know and have things dealt with before Pepper could even read the first 10 names.
"Well that's sweet,"Tony breathes out, seeing his own breath in front of him as he ducks his head to watch him wiggle his converse cladded feet. A small smile tugs at the corner of his lips at the thought, allowing himself to believe even for a little while that Steve actually cares, changing the conversation swiftly.
, for 10 years you pretended that I had never existed, that Jarvis hadn't existed because you couldn't even come to his fucking funeral. Do you know I was the only one there, do you? I was the only one at his funeral, a great fucking man, and as his friend you couldn't even show up."
the attention, but-
"You talk about him so much, I have to meet him. It's only fair, after all."
"And what else did he
"Stevie, I've been your friend since you were in diapers and not once have I complimented you."Bucky can't help but to laugh.
"I brought you because you need out and about just as much as I do."Is what tumbles out of Steves mouth because he couldn't exactly pin point the words that he wanted to say without Tony looking at him as if he had 3 heads. It was just as much the truth as it was a lie because really, Steve didn't have anyone else to bring out 'Shopping' and he didn't exactly trust himself to get himself to the SuperMarket without making a run for any sense of danger.
"Maybe Tony will be good for him. Have himself a science buddy now that Betty is away. What do you think, Stevie?"Bucky looks at Steve who seems to be caught staring at the two, more jealously flaring in his stomach whenever Tony's eyes light up in awe at something that Bruce has said, followed by a laugh.
"Shirt off or I'm going to start thinking that you actually do have two arms."Tony throws himself onto his chair, the chair spinning with the force which gives him the opportunity to grab the equipment that he needs to take measurements, test reflexes and a couple of photos and test samples. By the time he has turned back, Bucky is without his shirt, wearing an under vest, avoiding eye contact with Tony as the doctor slides his chair closer to him.
"He didn't
"It has."
"Thought you'd leave without a goodbye?"
He has thought he'd have at least a day or two to get back onto his feet, grab his bearings, figure out left from right, have a good scope on what he's missed, what's been said about him, read the articles of crying past lovers and hateful competitors that all of a sudden think of Tony as a 'good man with a great heart' now that he's assumed dead. But no, he's being thrown in with the sharks, in the deep end of the swimming pool, head first into a starving lion enclosure.
"You have got to be joking me. He came
"Tony? Are you alright? Is everything okay?"Steve's voice breaks Tony's dreading silence urgently and out of breath. The breath that Tony had no idea he was holding in is suddenly exhaled, entire body leaning against his workshop bench and a hand curled around the material of his t-shirt, knuckles brushing around the rim of the Arc Reactor.
And goddamnit, why is Bruce' voice so convincing?
"Yeah, I mean kind of. It's just Clint, drunk."Steve pitches Tony in just in time for Clint to belt out Steve's name.
"One of Howard's business partners, trying to chat me up about ideas for the company."Tony covers smoothly."He was just leaving."
"It would be very considerate of you to remain quiet while I am trying to discuss a very serious procedure with my patient, Sir."It takes a lot to keep his tone of voice so monotone and calm, unable to look at anywhere but at Barnes whose attention is on Steve, a bark in his voice as he speaks up for the first time.
"She has every right, she's your
"This Dinner is for you, set up by your Father and I to show how happy we are of your recovery. You are attending. Some of your Fathers business associates will be there, you will be on your best behaviour."
Sure, Tony forgets things all of the time, like his birthday or Christmas or exams but suddenly, this feels way more important than all of those combined. He had made a promise, contentless little promises to Steve on his departure to keep in contact and to phone every so often at least. He has lived up to those promises, mostly.
"Dr Grey needs a consult- don't look at me like that, not my department, not my business. Mr Barnes is also here for his measurements so we can work on a suitable prototype."
And okay, Steve may be your local hero who was ready to climb a tree to save your damn stupid cat or run to the local supermarket just because you forgot milk, but that didn't mean he didn't get into some sort of trouble. Bucky has had to drag Steves ass out of a handful of fights he has caught himself in, busted up in the face and bruised in the torso.
, punk."There's a sort of desperation behind Bucky's voice on the word
and sit back and watch the money roll in.
anyone."
"Wait, what?"Steve is shaking his head in confusion, his face scrunched up.
"Yeah,"Steve shrugs with a kind smile."I'll be right back."Steve makes a move to getup, self-consciously fishing into the pocket of his jeans for the spare change he had collected from Burger King and pocket money. Yeah, there should be enough, hopefully.
"Sounds like a smart kid."Bucky mutters a little sourly, catching onto the admiration in Steves tone. Taking a bite out of his apple, Bucky continues."So invite him over this week. Bring him to video game night."
Tony feels nauseous.
He hasn’t let himself dwell too much on the utter loneliness he’s felt, those memories feel like years ago. When they were merely just a few months’ past.
There's nothing left of the man next to him, barely an ounce of human inside him, and Steve takes a moment to look over at Tony who nods at him to continue.
“Yeah,” Steve replies breathily, sounding soft and innocent and Tony’s chest tightens with how much he adores him.
“Yes Boss, shall I give him the go ahead?”
But he pauses when he spots it.
Tony’s silent for most of the trip, and at one point Steve shouts over at him, “You awake back there?”
Steve leans forward to plant a kiss on Tony’s forehead, “I would never presume to know what to expect from you Tony,” he replies.
“You too, Tony.”
Tony’s not very surprised he’s ended up here, standing outside the door to Steve’s room – if it can even be called that still.
The time of his life indeed.
Painfully aware of the throbbing on the left side of his face, Tony reaches up to poke at his cheekbone, fingers coming back tinged with blood.
To be honest, Tony had forgotten about the phone and the conversations it holds.
It’s been easier to try and stop sleeping altogether, rather than lay down at night knowing what’s to come. He can never get comfortable, never sit still, if he does his mind wanders to subjects better left alone.
move, I can’t believe it.”
Why would Steve go out of his way to risk getting arrested in Germany? There’s something he’s missing.
Tomorrow he tells himself, tomorrow he’ll get it together.
Tony should have eaten something before this, because suddenly FRIDAY’s shouting vitals at him that aren’t making much sense, and he’s falling back into darkness.
“Oh, well hey there Steve,” he says, before lifting his shirt slightly and showing the stickered tag reading ‘Tony’ placed on his jeans over his hip.
inappropriate insubordinate email, while also cleaning out his bank account by buying thousands of stocks into Facebook,” Tony explains smugly, “But that’s all just rumors and will never be supported by evidence.”
Rhodey hangs up, and Tony sighs already feeling the impending migraine he’s going to be sporting.
The rest of the week goes by fast enough, and Steve’s already getting ready to head out to the auditorium where he’ll be spending the next eight hours of his life dancing. There’s both excitement and nervous energy bubbling up inside of his stomach, some of his friends from class are going to be there so he’s not worried about being alone, but there’s something about the whole dance aspect that gets his heart pumping faster.
Sometimes things boil up, sizzling—popping water over the burning hot surface of his life. But right here, the constant
Tony snatches it out Steve’s grasp and rips it open, causing both of them to laugh at the mini explosion of them onto the bed.
"It would make an improvement,"
is going to say.
. And by god he wishes he could remember, but instead, he's staring into a half empty, half full cupboard or mismatched plates.
"A tough nut to crack."Obi shakes his head with a dark chuckle, one that causes Tony to shiver and move closer to Rhodey in an automatic reaction for protection. He leaves rather quickly, casting a glance at Tony as he leaves, the pair remaining outside in the cold December night.
"So I'm somehow an asshole because I called your face pretty?"He's amused, Tony knows it because he can see it in the way that the corner of his lips tug into a sort of an amused smile, or maybe it's a smirk, and his eyes sort of dart to pinpoint Tony's own reaction. Tony scoffs a sort of half-laugh, rolling his eyes as he begins to walk away.
Bucky soon gets bored with flicking pieces of eraser at a disadvantaged Clint Barton, turning back to look at Steve whose head is prompted up by his hand and looking off into the distance, mind distracted and uninterested by his surroundings. Bucky bites his bottom lip momentarily, a heavy sigh taking over him before he speaks up.
"Steve, your mobile has buzzed about 5 times since we've walked in."Bruce informs, eyes pointing towards the flip phone that lays on the coffee table beside the tray of hot chocolate.
"Well I'm not going to argue with that."Bruce shrugs from his place beside Clint in the backseat, half listening to the conversation as he works his way through a bunch of papers in his folder. Bruce looks up, pushing his glasses up his nose."Although, it would help your grades if you'd at least
"Hun?"Steve snaps his eyes away from the teenagers chest and the odd blue light, looking up to meet the coffee brown eyes that stare at Steve, waiting for an answer."Oh, um, got into a fight."He shrugs his shoulders, his voice a little uneasy."I'm Steve."
"I have a nickname for everyone,"Tony mutters, scrunching his nose."You remind me of a Captain, an old love of an Aunt of mine and a story I was use to be told as a child. You came in here chattering cold and covered in snow. I thought it fit well."
It felt strange in a way for someone to not know who he was, it was the same effect with every time that Tony would try and repay Steve back and for the blonde to shake his head and tell him not to waste his money. It felt weird because Tony isn't use to having people bug him things or have people refuse his money, it's normally the other way round. It felt
"Stephen?"Bruce queried quietly, dipping his head as he approaches Tony, piles of pages tucked in an arm pressed to his chest. He had looked frantic and maybe that's because Tony had called for him urgently or maybe more for the fact that he's taking on a workload that he can't manage on his own. And there was still so much more to do, work to edit, others to publish, paperwork to sign, moving vans to hire...
Which, if you asked Steve was poppycock because Steve didn't see himself as a model citizen, or a superhero. He was just a teenager that seemed to do a lot of good things in his life, like helping out at youth centres for less fortunate kids or doing the weekly shopping for his elderly next door neighbor Reta. He wasn't a damn superhero, there were far more people on earth who deserved that title and he wasn't one of them.
Tony was always in trouble
In this case, it was Steve that dragged him out of his workshop.
James ( which by the way, Tony already knows a James and doesn't need to know another one but whatever ) had been less comforting, more in the sense that he had been sulking in a corner for a good part of an hour before Tony had noticed him. James looked like the kind of kid that would've hissed at you in elementary school but is now hot and emo in his teen years.
"You say that but you barely come out of your workshop unless you have to."Steve drawls out, pushing the trolley towards the dairy section.
"So, do we know them?"Clint asks, leaning to whisper into Steves ear, failing whenever his voice comes out louder than what he thought.
"And sometimes rumours lead to the truth."It's not said but Steve can guess what she's angling at as he slumps deeper into the passenger seat, wishing now that he had stuck with his stubbornness and walked to his apartment rather than give in and let Natasha give him a lift. She sighs, he looks away."Bucky said he was shaking like a tree in the wind."
"Oh you charmer, stop it."Tony winks through his shields at Happy, earning himself one in return and god, doesn't it feel good to flirt again. The car starts and begins to drive and they're not even off the runway before Pepper begins to speak up.
"Which you did well and I'm very thankful for that, trust me, that's why I'm giving you the money."He dodges Sarah as she tries to hand the money back to the teenager, shaking his head and taking steps away."Keep it, please. Treat yourself with new shoes or tidy up your house, or take your son out for dinner, I don't know but
Which, Tony had been fine with because he remains the face of the company, the social butterfly at events and charity galas, the charm at board meetings and presentations while Obadiah is lumbered with the paperwork, the stress, the plans. It works out, in all sorts of way, because Tony remains the brains as well at the beauty and he improves the company from behind the scenes and out on the field in his own types of way, also.
the last person that I want to think differently of me."He keeps his voice low and quiet, as if he's afraid that anyone else that's in this coffee hut will over hear, as if they care of what Tony says.
Tony doesn't know the date, or the time, but that doesn't matter as he over turns mattresses and throws linen across rooms in search for his mobile phone, keys, wallet, clothes that aren't stained with fluids and powder and what he hopes is mud. His heart is thumping against the Arc Reactor, his teeth are doing a number to his bottom lip as he scampers around the upturned Stark House, collecting what he needs and making a mental note to beg Obie for his assistance.
"Stevie! There you a-"Hiccup,"-re!"He's stumbling his way down the steps, nearly toppling over into the bushes as he sways to the side. There's already the loss of his hearing aids and Clint is too drunk to lipread.
"And?"Tony prompts, petting mindlessly at Dumm-E's claw apologetically for shooing the 'bot off, as well as an item of comfort to Tony's soul.
"I was going to say not that great, but we can go with shit."Instead of sitting across from Tony, Steve is swiftly sliding into his side of the booth, suddenly feeling so much bigger than Tony in that moment where the younger teen hunches over a mug of coffee and chews on his bottom lip.
"I'm a busy guy,"Tony shrugs, following suit."A busy guy with a busy life and friends that are too busy to hang around me."He mumbles. Tony was not for the endless partying and a different lady (or man) in his bed scene anymore, he was fed up with it and since the rocky break up he endured with Pepper, he swore he wouldn't fall back into old habits.
are you even here? Don't you have studying to do?"
"I'll let you believe that."Steve snorts, loading the washing machine and slamming the machine door as soon as he's stuffed in the last sock. Steve has known Natasha longer than Bucky has, and despite all of what Natasha is on the outside, she's very knowing and understanding.
"Come on then, fill me in on the things I've missed."
"Tony?"And God,
is for long, a phone screen being shoved into his face, eyes blinking to keep up with the flashing lights, the vivid colours, the movement of bodies upon another, lips curling, voice sluring, tongues-
"That's more of a miracle than just make up, Tones."
care who he ends up in bed with when the night is over, and he's pretty sure that's something Steve would frown about, because it sure as hell makes his Parents upset.
This time, Peggy is there, in mourning black if only to blend in to the crowds. But she stands out to Tony, because only Peggy could appear in mourning but not actually be, to retain a facade as if she had never left. She looks tired, withered almost, as if the years of working a dream job in a dream city with a dream family wasn't the dream she intended it to be. And in some spiteful, hateful way, Tony does wishes that she had regrets, about leaving Tony in the dust, about leaving New York, about leaving behind a life, a boy, who adored her.
