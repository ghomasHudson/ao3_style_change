“So,” Tony breathed when they finally broke apart, “if I understand the story correctly: you cobbled together discarded armor, snuck into the ranks of my guard, and then threw yourself in front a sword rather than tell me you loved me.”
“Fine,” he told Clint, taking a gulp from his drink to fortify himself. “Sign me up for ‘Highway to Hell.’”
Tony was helpless to say anything other than, "Okay?" He climbed into the front seat and started the car again. He popped off the e-brake and had barely touched the gas before his car was jerking forward, right up the hill, out of the snow, and back onto the shoulder. "Whoa." He pulled the brake again and switched the car off.
“That’s ridiculous,” Tony shook his head. “You’re here now. We’ll find a way together. We always do.”
“Sorry to disappoint,” Steve replied. Tony had leaned in to adjust the collar of Steve’s shirt, and Steve let his hands drop to Tony’s waist, feeling just daring enough to sweep a soft circle across the crest of Tony’s hips. “But you got scooped by a hair-and-makeup artist for the USO tour.”
“I should never have stayed on the case after I realized what I was feeling,” Steve continued, his fists clenching around the blankets at his side. “But I couldn’t bring myself to trust anyone else with your safety. It was arrogant and selfish, and I almost –” He broke off, heaving in a deep breath of antiseptic and pine-scented cleansers. “I wasn’t strong enough to walk away.”
“Brucie Bear, I love you, and the faith in me implied by that question warms the cockles of my poor, caffeine-abused heart. But if I could tell the difference between those two things, I promise you that both my career and my kitchen counters would look very different right now.”
“Ward thinks I bought his line about taking Garrett to the Fridge,” Coulson added. “So they won’t be expecting my team to show up as back-up.”
“Fury is alive,” Coulson replied. “And I have very good reason to believe that Stark is too. Or at least he was twenty minutes ago, when Agent Hill received a phone call offering to make a trade for his life.”
“I’ll keep that in mind, Dr. Stark,” Grant said flatly. “And you might want to keep your own aversion to shaming in mind when you speak with your students. You hold a lot of power over their sense of self-worth.”
“Play nice, boys,” Natasha admonished with a small smile. “Sam’s just tired of Steve moping around all the time.”
Bruce sighed and pulled another box of onion rings out of the bag. Tony took it and stuck his tongue out at Natasha, who flipped him off without a change of expression. Steve cleared his throat, struggling not to smile.
Steve shifted his weight marginally before continuing, and Tony added to his list of “frankly heroic feats of self-control” by not pointing out how heroically self-controlled he was being.
“What, Captain Sure-of-Himself, you think you can out-carve a laser trained on the joint collections of the Louvre, the Whitney, and the Shanghai Museum?” Tony asked his boyfriend, eyes narrowing at the smug little twist of Steve’s lips.
“No kidding,” Tony shook his head. “And here I thought Brucie was just on a sugar high from all the funnel cakes Thor kept buying.”
Coulson’s team had joined them for the first round (and then the second and third), and Steve had spent most of the evening watching quietly from one of the pieces of assorted furniture he and Thor had carried out from their bedrooms. Skye and Clint had designed a version of “margarita pong” that integrated the shrapnel strewn across the kitchen, and they were facing off against Natasha and May. It was hard to tell who was winning or losing, but it was very clear which team was drunker. Coulson and Thor were swapping stories about Asgardian adventures on Earth, and every once in a while Coulson would pause to let Thor make a toast with the large brass planter he was using as a beer stein. Simmons and Bruce seemed to have gotten halfway through a unified theory of something called “gravitonium” and were drawing equations energetically on what remained of an end table. Tony and Fitz had gone down to Tony’s workshop, and it wasn’t until they reemerged, gesticulating and talking eagerly over top of each other, that Steve realized his muscles had been tense the entire time Tony had been out of sight.
“It’s a tradition in Asgard to honor the exchange of emotional vows!” Thor boomed genially. “The Gjestebud for Fandral and Hogun lasted three of your Midgardian months, and songs are still sung about the many Asgardian children conceived on the final night of feasting.”
. But Tony had somehow been juggling a product launch and a major acquisition at Stark Industries while also suiting up to fight Doombots, HYDRA agents, and something Clint had dubbed “the cuttlefish from Hell.” Steve had been trying his best to give Tony his space, but after the battle with the Doombots – when Tony had apparently nodded off mid-flight, clipped the side of a building with his shoulder, and ended up plowing through a billboard – Steve had been feeling extra vigilant.
“You were pretty out of it, and Helen was just getting off her clinical rotation at the ER, so I asked her to make sure you were okay. I wasn’t sure whether you would want to have the cops involved — you know, with your parents and everything. Then I brought you home.”
“Yes,” Steve agreed. “And I’m very sorry to do this, but we need to get moving.” He pulled out the injector gun that May had given him, and held it over Harrison’s chest. “This is adrenaline. It’s not going to feel great. But I promise I won’t leave you.”
“Ah, I see,” Tony smiled humorlessly, “you’re trying to tell me that Steve’s going to shoot me. Well you picked a tough sell there, Anya Amasova, because Steve is even less capable of that than he is of picking out clothes that fit him.”
The door closed behind them, leaving Steve alone with his nerves and the familiar pressure of the plastic phone in his hand. Taking a deep breath, he typed out a message, his fingers shaking only slightly over the keys:
“You can do whatever you want in the safety of your home,” Steve tried again, “but you have to stop trying to shake me when we’re in public. If you won’t let me stay close, then I can’t do my job.”
“I said we need you in L.A. tomorrow,” Pepper repeated, pointedly ignoring his interjections. “The board is threatening to pull support for the clean energy initiative if you don’t appear personally.”
That threat must have been effective at clearing the room, because Tony heard no more interruptions as Steve lowered him carefully back onto the bed. Tony twined one of his hands into Steve’s hair to hold him in place, indicating with a low growl and a squeeze to Steve’s hips that he was not, under any conditions, letting go. Steve seemed eager to take the hint. He followed Tony onto the bed, carefully holding his own weight on his elbows but continuing to kiss Tony greedily into the pillow he was arranging under Tony’s head. The movements were so gentle and hungry at once, and they made Tony ache with tenderness. He arched his hips off the bed so that he could feel the movement of Steve’s breathing against his chest. Steve responded by pressing one hand into the small of Tony’s back: holding Tony up or holding them together, Tony couldn’t tell.
“Ah yes,” Arnie remarked, a smile spreading across his face. “I was hoping someone would see her name in the papers and come asking.”
He paused to duck as a pillow, half a molasses crinkle, and what looked suspiciously like a tranquilizer dart flew at him from three different locations in the Avengers common room.
Steve swallowed heavily, not sure if he was fighting the urge to step out of Tony’s space or further into it. At this range, the series of expressions that flitted across Tony’s face was almost dizzying, and with his nerves still on fire from the frenzied search at the gala, Steve felt momentarily like he was swaying on the edge of a cliff.
“Would you like to -” James hesitated, “sit down for a while? See if we can wait it out? I wouldn’t mind the company.”
“Rude,” Tony replied, moving into the kitchen to grab a mug from the cupboards. “That one doesn’t count for your total, because it’s rude and it’s unfounded.”
Tony heaved a sigh, running both his hands vigorously through his hair as if he could shake loose a connection his brain hadn’t grasped yet. He found his eyes lingering over a photocopy of Steve Rogers’ sketch of the Oratorio di Santa Croce in Azzanno, the soft pencil shading somehow managing to capture the effect of sunlight hitting the red-tile roof.
“Oh shut up, Rogers,” Tony growled. And then he tightened his grip on Steve’s arms and hauled him into a kiss.
enough to have strong, unfalsifiable opinions: how wrong Charles Lyell was about gradualism, for example, or how deeply to read into the homoeroticism of “In Memoriam A.H.H.”
Steve let out a soft choking sound and collapsed forward, nestling his head onto Tony’s chest and clutching at the fabric of his hospital gown. Tony ran the tips of his fingers in small circles across Steve’s back and let him wrestle down the sobs.
dealing with that worry by paying a small fortune on Ebay for a set of his favorite, discontinued colored pencils so that you could pretend you accidentally found them at GoodWill.
“And you, Steve Rogers, might be even more of a smug little shit than I thought. But I have to say it’s growing on me.”
“Oh someone’s getting lucky, for sure,” Clint smirked, and then he ducked — almost in time to avoid a projectile potato chip from Natasha.
“Well, point B certainly proves point A,” Pepper remarked dryly. “And you don’t need to worry about Sharon.”
“Cap, Wonder Twins,” Tony replied. “Barton, glad to see the minor villains of the world find your face as punchable as we do.”
“They gave Hill a location,” Coulson answered, “and they want you to bring the files and the Director – no one else. They gave you four hours.”
“We went to the Delta Phi party, and Ty was there,” Steve explained. He was watching Tony carefully, and Tony did the best he could to keep the leap of panic that name had sent up his spine from showing up on his face. “I’m pretty sure he put something in your drink. Maybe because —”
“Us, huh?” Steve asked softly. He let his hands fall to Tony’s hips, sketching little circles across the skin just above his jeans.
“Get your hands off me, Rogers,” Ty snapped, practically spitting the words into Steve’s face. “Do you have any idea what I can do to someone like you?”
a crush on Captain America. I saw your teenage bedroom, and I think we both know that ship sailed a long time ago.”
“You injected yourself with a serum suppressant and let them walk you straight into an unmarked van!” Tony hissed.
Steve finally allowed a smile to spread across his face. In the part of his mind that was always scanning his periphery, he was aware of Natasha helping Bruce out of his blanket fort and picking a piece of lint out of his hair – her hand lingering a little longer than necessary as Bruce assured her he had a backup pie in the fridge. Rhodey and Thor were loudly concocting plans to smoke Clint out (and pointedly ignoring Clint’s own contributions from the vent above them). And in the center, as always, was Tony, who was grinning victoriously as he took in Steve’s expression.
“Whenever you need me,” Steve replied, then winced internally. Get a grip on yourself, Rogers. “I mean, right away if the team needs me. And soon either way. I just need a little bit of time to clear my head.”
In the end, Tony was too impatient to wait long enough to call the library back. He’d hoped that the rare workout at the gym would set him up for an equally rare eight hours of sleep, but despite what was shaping up to be a truly epic case of delayed-onset muscle soreness, rest had refused to come. The final straw came at 6:00 AM, when Tony woke up in a cold sweat from a recurring nightmare that the college was making him repeat his dissertation defense. Except this time, one of his committee members had been replaced by Dr. Grant, clad in a pair of tweed shorts that left even less to the imagination than his workout apparel. After lying awake for a half hour staring at the ceiling in a state of frustration that was only 50% sexual (65%
Tony took the hint and turned on the game. They talked stats for a while, and Tony kept up a running commentary for a few innings before dozing off, his tablet still held loosely in one hand. When Steve stood up to go, he stopped to lay a blanket around Tony’s shoulders, his fingers lingering a moment when he noticed Tony’s hair had gotten caught against the cushion. He was about to reach out and smooth it over, a small smile forming on his lips at the way Tony's smile lines relaxed in his sleep, and then he froze, his fingers hovering an inch away from delicately brushing his client’s hair.
Steve had time to see the tip of a rifle clear the edge of the doorway, already pivoting toward the place where Tony was positioned in front of him, and then he lunged forward, using as much of his body weight as he could muster to plow the attacker backward and into the opposite wall. Molten pressure exploded through his abdomen in a wave, but he had the presence of mind to force the rifle upward, sending a spray of gunfire into the ceiling.
small, you know? And yet everywhere I turn, there you are, biceps and all, swanning around and charming everyone, and adding a third and fourth circle of hell to faculty meetings."
Steve replaced his gun in its holster so he could climb down the ladder. Once he made it to the bottom, he paused to grip the side rail, holding it steady as Tony followed him.
“Okay, new final point: you’re fired. Again,” Tony said. “Ow! Ow! Fine, Romanov. Jesus, you’re a menace.”
“You mock, but it should be considered, like, high treason to put Captain America’s ass in off-the-rack pants,” Tony argued, letting one hand run down Steve’s backside to illustrate his point.
“Look we’ve all taken a few hits lately,” he pushed on. “But it isn’t all on you. That’s what you told me, right? Let the team take some of the punches with you. And you know what else that means: you’ve got backup wherever you go. You don’t have to fight for SHIELD if you don’t want to.”
Two blocks: but Tony wasn’t the real problem, and Steve knew it. Steve should have handed this case off to Clint the second he found himself wanting to tuck a blanket around Tony’s shoulders. If it weren’t for his unprofessional crush, Steve would never have been stupid enough to risk leaving Tony alone just so he could surprise him with
She sat down at one of the plush red couches and took another sip of her tea as Tony hovered by the coffee table, scanning the lounge furnishings that Pepper had chosen. At the time, she’d thought Tony would be living part-time at the facility as well, which might have been why she had decorated the residence in the same style as Avengers Tower. Tony brushed at the leaf of a flourishing philodendron and tried not to wonder who was watering the plants now that Bruce was M.I.A.
“But I maintain,” he continued from behind the couch, “that the underlying principle of the design is both technologically sound and aesthetically adorable. Also, refs, can I get a rule check on ‘no using knock-out techniques on your teammates’?”
Steve surged upward at the sight but found himself bound tightly into place. They had strapped him to an old dentist’s chair, bolted to the ground and too heavy to topple.
Tony had to reread the lines three times, his mind racing through a maze of implications. His father had met Steve Rogers - had actually worked on Rebirth - and had somehow been sworn to such a degree of secrecy about it that Tony had never heard either name pass his lips. And if the original materials for the weapons project had been destroyed, that might explain why so few mentions of the project had slipped past the censors.
“It’s not what it looks like,” Fury replied calmly. “SHIELD isn’t anywhere near the serum, Doctor. And this is why these files are classified, Stark. So people won’t see something they don’t understand and start a panic.”
He closed his eyes at the memory, balling up his love and pain and regret as if he could place them in Bucky's hands:
“Well then it’s a good thing Captain Constant Vigilance is here to remind us what it looks like to be forever on our guard,” Tony said sarcastically. “I’m curious: if you tried to unclench right now, would something physically fall out you?”
“I’ll do my best,” Tony repeated, feeling only a little foolish as he lifted the lid and peered inside.
Tony managed to get through the rest of his talk without further stumbles, though he couldn’t help but dart surreptitious glances at Grant as he laid out his new theory about Carter’s involvement with a covert squad of former POWs. He expected to see Grant looking skeptical about some of Tony’s larger reaches: Tony had made substantial progress with his inquiries into Dugan, Barnes, and Morita, but he didn’t exactly have incontrovertible evidence to connect the 107th to weapons-testing for “Project Rebirth,” and he’d come prepared to bullshit spectacularly when pressed.
And, of course, Steve could hardly have done any research into his potential client without seeing headlines about the man’s extracurricular exploits. After skimming a
The gorgeous ass was seated on the chest press machine, and Tony walked past so he could admire the pecs and abs he was sure went with legs like those, but when he rounded the equipment and came face to face with the man, it pushed a curse out of him. "Oh, for fuck's sake."
“I already told you I’m not doing that,” Bruce said, at the same time that Tony fired back, “We’ll see about that, Point Break.”
“Not quite,” Steve smiled. “I cobbled together discarded armor, snuck into the ranks of your guard, and then threw myself in front a sword
Tony felt a flutter of nerves that was both familiar and not - a slight racing of the pulse he’d felt at the gym, and again when he saw James walk into the room for his talk - and suddenly a truly terrible suspicion started to take shape in his mind.
Steve glanced over at Tony to make his eye roll as visible as possible, but he was smiling in a way that probably ruined the effect.
Now that he had arrived at the compound, however, the whole “take a breezy, fourteen-hour trip to double check that Steve’s face was not actually pale with blood loss” plan was feeling the tiniest bit ill-advised. Tony hadn’t been to the facility at all since the team had moved in, and he knew the timing of this particular visit was going to attract attention. He had another excuse for being there, but even that excuse relied on sharing news that he’d very much not wanted to communicate in person. He sat in his car outside the entrance to the residence, drumming his fingers rapidly against the steering wheel and considering the possibility of turning around. He could be back in the city by midnight, and if he was lucky, no one would even know he had come.
Tony broke off, and Steve’s brow furrowed in confusion. He had noticed the cameras, of course, somewhere in between rounds two and three with the sledge hammer. But he had assumed HYDRA was sending the visuals to SHIELD.
“No, I’m fine,” Steve assured him. He had walked several paces from the entryway into the living room, but now he turned back to face Tony. “At least…it seems like I’m fine. I guess everything that happened in there was just in our heads?”
“Well, I’d like you to stick around,” Tony said finally. He took Steve’s hand in his again, pressing it gently this time as he ran one thumb along the edge of Steve’s palm. Steve let out a gasp in response, and a slow smile spread across Tony’s face. “But I do have one condition: you need to quit.”
“Bad luck, I guess,” he said. And then he gave a shrug that sent an absolutely criminal ripple of movement across his bare chest.
“I’m going to head to bed,” Steve said abruptly, tearing his eyes away from Tony’s forearms as he stood up. “Gotta know when your luck has turned.”
“So am I disqualified from betting if the first injury of the month happened because you were standing next to me?” Tony asked. His tone was light but sharp, and even though Tony was turning the edge toward himself, Steve felt it like a blade against his sternum.
on Steve Rogers. My orientation here is completely professional. But while we’re on the subject, have I mentioned Rogers did a breathtaking sketch of the Church of Santa Maria Antica that’s almost perfectly proportional?”
He switched over his screen to his contact list and dialed Rhodey, the closest person he could think of to a government contact, because he had to tell someone, and he was far too impatient to wait until he could comb back through his notes at home. He paced up and down the stairs to his building while the phone rang, doing his best not to startle any more unsuspecting students.
“So I know we’ve all been a little bit distracted by the fact that I created a rampaging murder bot, but…do you think something’s going on with Bruce and Nat?” he asked.
Tony hiked his bag higher on his shoulder. "Yeah, I don't think you're exactly her type," he muttered.
Tony flipped to the next page and finally saw the magic words. “Project Rebirth” appeared in the neat, tightly packed letters of Erksine’s script, right there in the final line. Tony could feel a surge of adrenaline hit his system, his hand wavering just slightly as he photographed the page.
The memory of that fight had joined the list of visions that Steve tried to beat out of his brain by pounding them through punching bags: the image of Bucky shoving Tony’s face plate to the side, wrenching at the casing of the arc reactor with his metal fist. Steve had been able to get the chip in place in time to pull them apart, but not before the connection between the reactor and the suit had been damaged. Tony had been helpless when the carrier started to go down, and Steve’s heart rate jumped every time he remembered his mad scramble to get Tony out of the suit or his struggle to shield Tony’s body with his as they hit the water.
He had just toggled over to his college email account to rectify the oversight - taking advantage of a free moment while the students prepared their discussion questions in small groups - when he saw the Google alert pop up in his inbox. It wasn’t the alert he’d set up at the beginning of the year to catch any mentions of Peggy Carter, he realized a moment later: it was the one he’d set up two weeks ago, partially out of idle curiosity and partially out of book-proposal-related panic. And apparently, it had paid off, because someone had just published a blog entry that mentioned Howard Stark.
Tony gave him a tight smile, leaning back in his chair and forcing Steve to move quickly to avoid yanking his hair.
“Those bodies right –” Steve pointed at the place where Tony had uncovered the corpses dressed in their clothing and found himself gesturing toward a completely unremarkable expanse of solid floor. “– there,” he finished faintly.
"You should get some potassium too,” Bruce said, dropping a banana onto the table and picking up Tony’s wrist to take his pulse. At first it looked like Tony was going to protest against the gesture, but he seemed to think better of it when he saw Steve staring him down from across the table.
“Nice of you boys to show up,” Natasha called out, and Tony saw two gunmen drop off the overpass as she ducked out from behind a tractor-trailer.
“You’ve been staring at that photo for ten minutes,” she pointed out. “You look like you’re about to start doodling new initials in your sketchbook.”
“I knew you would say that, Stark,” Thor replied, “which is why I have asked Banner to design a great contest of warrior prowess, at which I will officially earn my title as strongest Avenger.”
“A rousing challenge!” Thor yelled, slapping his cards down on the table. “I would hate to give way under any less brave an assault.”
“Tony,” Rhodey’s voice greeted him a moment later. “I swear to God if this is another ‘would you rather fight one bear-sized raccoon or four raccoon-sized bears’ phone call…”
“I swear you make half of this shit up,” Tony said, grinning when Thor gave him a slow wink in reply.
“So,” Tony murmured, turning back to Steve after Clint had gone, “Speaking of people who have been hiding things. I think we were discussing the rather dramatic revelation that you love me.”
“Roger that. Meet you at the secret lair,” Tony affirmed. He turned to where Steve was still trying to get through to Barnes. Unfortunately, Steve’s pleading seemed to have rather increased than decreased the fury of the Winter Soldier’s attack. Tony winced when Steve took a punch to the head and then figured that turnabout was fair play.
Tony and Darcy looked up in unison. The extremely unholy love child of protein powder, corsets, and horny homoerotic greek statuary was standing at the end of the row, scowling at them. "This is a library. Would you mind keeping it down?"
Steve cleared his throat, feeling his cheeks flush slightly as a chunk of armor the size of a pea pattered onto the couch next to them with a barely audible fizzle.
"Why not? I heard it was lemon meringue day. Don't tell me I skipped a week by accident again and it's cherry cobbler…"
“You’ve got good taste,” Tony said finally, his voice coming out a little huskier than he had intended.
On what Clint called the “soggy side of the shit burger,” plan B was definitely still up to their standards. They’d had no problems dispatching the few hired thugs they’d found patrolling the rig: the men in question seemed so ill-prepared for any kind of skilled combat that Steve felt sure they couldn’t be intended for much more than a sacrificial stalling technique. But the rig itself was another story. Twenty minutes into the mission, the team had already been forced to ditch their comms and Tony’s suit (thanks to a specialized EMP that had been coded to the sound of Tony’s voice), change course several times (due to sudden eruptions of some kind of purple gas), and split up (courtesy of a series of metal doors that slid down from the ceiling and locked into place whenever something triggered the accompanying control panel). And that wasn’t even counting the large explosive device buried somewhere in the lower levels, which FRIDAY had detected shortly before Tony’s suit had gone offline.
Tony’s ridiculous childhood crush on Captain America was just rearing its ugly head the longer Steve lived in the Tower. It really didn’t help any that Tony had gotten to know
Steve seems so at peace as he gazes out into the vastness of space. Tony would be lying if he said it isn’t the reason he’s been able to keep his calm in the face of certain death (it
“Really?” Steve gasped in mock surprise as he crossed the kitchen to the cat’s bowls. “Well, don’t worry, cutie pie, I’ve got your food right here.”
When Rogers stepped into the conn-pod, he seemed a bit... nervous? There was tension in the way he was holding himself, and it looked like he was clenching his jaw hard enough to grind rocks into dust. Tony had thought they had both been anticipating this moment, but now a sliver of doubt was creeping into Tony’s mind at seeing his soon-to-be copilot looking apprehensive.
“No, you can’t stay in here by yourself.” Tony told him as ran his fingers through the soft fur on the cat’s belly, which still didn’t wake him up.
The ghost agreed, seeming a bit hesitant, but half an hour later he was trudging alongside Tony into the attic. It was disgustingly dusty upstairs, as if the stacks of boxes hadn’t been disturbed in decades. Belatedly, Tony wished he had a mask to wear so his allergies didn’t kill him the next day.
Occasionally, he caught Steve sneaking glances at him, and it was hard to keep from laughing at him. He wasn’t doing a very good job of being subtle, but then again, Tony probably wasn’t either. It was kind of hard to focus on the work Pepper had sent him when Steve was right there. Though it was pleasant to just… sit together, stealing glances in whatever this was that they definitely weren’t addressing. Tony wasn’t sure when the last time he ever simply spent time with someone was before Steve.
After Tony had found Steve in that cryopod, he hadn’t wanted to let go. He would have been perfectly fine with holding onto Steve forever. Tony had brushed it off as making sure Steve didn’t fall because of his unsteady legs, but he wasn’t even sure which of them had truly needed the support to stay upright.
“This is payback for the strawberry incident, isn’t it?” He asked. “I really am sorry about that. You should totally give me points for at least remembering that there was some sort of connection there.”
Tony had almost finished his first mug when Coulson appeared out of nowhere, nearly causing him to spill the rest when he jumped. “Good morning, Mr. Stark. How is everything?”
“You do, but for some reason they’ve completely muddled this whole process. Can you just do this one thing for me? Meet with the appraiser and get everything sorted out. I’m sure you’ll have it taken care of in just a day or two.”
It was Steve’s turn to roll his eyes at Tony. “I finally came back from the dead only for my boyfriend to get hypothermia running out in the snow to kiss me.”
Sketchpad forgotten for the moment, Steve was outright beaming at him now, and Tony was finding it hard to even be jokingly irritated with that face.
Just before the worst of his regret could hit him, Tony reeled his emotions back in and tried to push it all to the back of his mind and focus on the Jaeger. The voice of the officer in mission control became clearer as Tony channeled his focus and got his emotions in check.
The cat circled around the table a couple of times before finding an agreeable spot to plop down and watch as Tony got back to work on his project. Occasionally he reached out to give Orion some ear scritches because it was pretty hard to resist all that soft fluffiness so close-by. There was something relaxing about the cat’s presence; Clint might’ve been right about the whole “serotonin machine” thing.
“Come to join the land of the insomniacs again, O’Malley?” Tony held out a treat for the cat as he hopped up on the table as was now routine and gave him some pets once the treat was eaten.
Granted, that didn’t mean that Tony had managed to squash the tiny voice in the back of his head that reminded him that it didn’t matter. Over the years, he had developed a habit of defensively retreating into himself to avoid getting too attached because, eventually, everyone left Tony Stark. Really, the only exceptions to that were Rhodey and Pepper, and well… Pepper was still the CEO of his company and they were working on getting back to the whole “being friends” thing, but she hadn’t been able to handle his new superhero gig even after sticking around through some of the literal worst years of his life.
“Don’t you dare utter those words outside of this room or I’ll sue you for defamation,” Tony bristled, though Steve could tell it was more of an act than anything.
“Well hey there, little guy.” Steve cooed as he slowly reached out for the cat to sniff his hand. After seemingly determining Steve wasn’t a threat, the cat cautiously poked his head out from underneath the car and emerged with a casual stretch before butting his head against Steve’s hand.
For a brief moment, Tony was terrified (though wasn’t it supposed to be a good thing if Steve crossed over?), but then he whipped around and saw Steve on the porch of the house, face ashen.
“Well,” Tony started. “The town doesn’t even have a stoplight, there’s like two feet of snow everywhere, and that strange innkeeper guy said a bunch of cryptic shit before he left.”
Meanwhile, Tony couldn’t stop trying to piece together why the hell they hadn’t been able to break the curse yet. Steve was a bit quiet the rest of the day, but he kept drawing and somehow didn’t seem to be as weighed down by everything anymore. He couldn’t tell if Steve had just given up, or if this was his way of coping with it. He didn’t seem as tense and quick to anger as he had in those first few days, and he’d come to terms with his (needless) guilt over his best friend’s death… so what the hell was keeping him here?
Thor, Bucky and Natasha were already sitting at the kitchen table, and Steve sat down across from them when he was finished making his food. He thought the chair directly across from him was empty… until a precious fluffy face popped up over the edge of the table, sniffing the air eagerly at the scent of food.
“If I didn’t want you to look, I wouldn’t have left it within reaching distance.” Oh, the grogginess in Steve’s voice was really doing something to him.
He found him in the kitchen, finishing up breakfast because, as Tony had come to notice, Steve was a morning person. Like, the kind of morning person who probably got up every morning and went jogging for
“I mean, we pilot giant fucking robots to fight alien monsters that come through a portal at the bottom of the ocean, so. The existence of other universes? Not quite so far-fetched in the grand scheme of things.” And really, he’d be lying if he said the idea wasn’t a bit exciting.
“If you shut that in my face, I’ll just go get the Terminator to bust it down for me.” Quickly, Tony reached out to put a hand on the door, though he didn’t try to force it the rest of the way open. “I know what that arm is capable of, I made it.”
Steve had apparently decided it was his duty to retrieve Tony from the workshop whenever he was down there for an amount of time normal people deemed excessive. Of course, Tony gave into him every single time because he could never say no to Steve’s stupid beautiful blue eyes or his stupid honest face and the way he acted like he actually cared if Tony withered away from overworking himself.
Oh, Steve. Beautiful Steve. Wait, why did he think Tony had a cat? He’d lived here for like a year already, hadn’t he? That was definitely something that would have come up in conversation within that time, probably.
The man had immediately caught Tony’s attention when he had been transferred from a Shatterdome that had been taken out of commission. Granted, Tony had heard of him well before then; he’d always kept up with the various Jaeger pilots across the world, their success rates, what equipment and tactics worked in battle and what didn’t. Steve Rogers had somehow managed to get his Jaeger back to shore after a particularly awful Kaiju battle that had left his copilot, James Barnes, unconscious when the beast had ripped through the conn-pod. Barnes lost his arm from the injuries, but as Tony had seen for years and years, it could have been so much worse. As it was, he could no longer pilot with Rogers, and the duo’s Jaeger had been decommissioned.
“What?” Steve gave him a confused look. He tried to ignore the way his thoughts were drifting towards how very much he would like to climb Steve like a tree.
He hoped the use of the man’s first name would help settle him somehow, and Tony saw the last of the wariness fade from his eyes as the determined glint he was used to seeing during training took over. Steve nodded back as the crew began the process of connecting their suits to the Jaeger.
Steve placed a cup of coffee on the table in front of Tony, and he clung to it like a life preserver, inhaling the scent before downing a few gulps. When he blearily blinked the remaining sleep out of his eyes, Steve was just watching him with the barest hint of a smile on his face.
“Oh, you do?” He finally looked up from his drawing to find Tony with the utmost serious expression on his face.
“Well, alright. I suppose that’s as good a starting point as any.” His voice sounded way too loud in the silent study. “So, is there anything useful on these shelves? Some sort of Crossing Over for Dummies, or maybe a teenage diary full of your darkest secrets?”
He started rattling off a list of everything that would have to be done if the cat stayed, and Steve quietly committed it all to memory.
After a few hours, Tony finally had separated possible leads into a pile and began to look through the papers more closely for any articles that might hold a clue to the mystery of Steve’s death. He had narrowed it down to any papers printed during December in the year Steve had died and January of the following year. They made small talk while Tony gently flipped through the pages that had been “archived” in plastic protector sleeves that were probably purchased at the nearest scrapbooking store. Occasionally Steve made a comment here or there whenever something caught his eye. It was almost… pleasant, if not for how tedious it was and how Tony’s eyes were beginning to hurt after straining to read the faded text.
It took him a second to react to Steve’s response because he honestly hadn’t expected for Steve to say yes. Once his brain processed what Steve had said, Tony hopped up out of the chair and hustled to the shelf in case the man suddenly had a change of heart. Holy shit, wasn’t this like, the ultimate trust of an artist? Tony definitely didn’t let just anyone into his workshop, so he tried his best to not let Steve’s approval go to his head.
After half-heartedly poking around on some business documents for a few hours, Tony decided there was something more important he needed to do.
“It’s not your fault that people just didn’t care or notice, or whatever their fucking excuse was. Dumbasses, all of them. They have no clue what they missed.”
“Both pilots are out of alignment.” The voice over the comm system was clear now. “I repeat, Stark and Rogers, you are both out of alignment. We’re shutting it down.”
“Nah,” Steve shook his head, the corners of his mouth turning down. “Dames used to look right past me. When Bucky would drag me out on double dates, he’d always end up with both girls not even halfway through.” At that he gave a small chuckle, at least.
Tony attempted to work on some stuff Pepper emailed him about, but he just couldn’t focus on any of it because his mind kept wandering. The thought of how horrible it must feel to be cut-off from something one loved like that. Imagining not being able to interact with Dum-E and the other bots, not being able to work on his cars or any of his work projects felt like… well, it felt like cutting apart his soul and losing a piece of himself. So yeah, Steve’s reaction was pretty reasonable after Tony had spent the day dwelling on it.
“Okay, okay,” he said with a laugh, and Tony briefly considered recording the sound somehow, just so he could listen to it forever. "You can be my assistant then.”
“You don’t care at all, you can’t wait to be rid of me. I’m nothing but an obstacle keeping you from selling this place,” Steve continued, taking another step towards him. Tony could feel a chill creeping up his spine as Steve came closer.
Steve had left before Tony could say a single word to him about what had happened, but Tony didn’t even know what he would have even begun to say to the man if he had been given a chance. Hours later, his mind was still reeling from everything he had seen, trying to parse any kind of coherent narrative to it all.
“She’s terrifying in the best kind of way, but no, an exorcist is entirely unnecessary. I’ve got this.”
“Dum-E’s a pretty good model.” Steve reached out and patted the bot that had been posing for him for the past few hours of the early afternoon. “He holds a pose very well, dontcha, boy?”
Fury stopped by the Tower one day without announcing himself as usual, and Orion wasted no time in greeting their surprise guest.
“‘m cold,” Tony whined as he snuggled in impossibly close to Steve’s side, leaning his head against his shoulder. Steve wondered if the other man was close enough to feel the way his heart was absolutely pounding.
He’d been working on Jaegers for years, designing them, building them, getting them back in working order after pilots dragged his beautiful machines back from nasty encounters with Kaiju. Stark Industries had been on the forefront of the war against the Kaiju since the initial invasion, and were still in the thick of it now even with governments worldwide pulling their funding from the Jaeger Program and putting it towards building
Tony blinked against the sudden and harsh brightness of a sunny sky, and as things came into focus, he realized he was standing in the middle of a destroyed city street, dust and rubble and mangled cars making it look like some sort of… war zone. He took in his surroundings, and if he had to make a guess judging by what remained of the buildings, he’d say it was New York City. This couldn’t be the aftermath of a Kaiju attack; they’d never made it that far from the breach.
There were about a million issues running through his mind at once, security issues and Steve slowly growing more irate with him, because really, Tony was too good at carelessly pushing the man’s buttons. Wondering if any of the emotionally-stunted misfits who lived with him were even capable of taking care of a small fluffy creature, or if this would become a regrettable one-off and they’d end up taking the poor thing to a shelter after he became fond of it.
“I just didn’t think they’d be quite so… vivid in the drift,” Steve said apologetically, running a hand through his hair like it might be a nervous habit. “But I don’t know what I expected, some sort of epiphany maybe. It seems that we’re together in all of those other worlds, or whatever they are.”
.” Something else dawned on him, and Tony raised an eyebrow at Steve. “You’re… warm. Like really warm.”
Tony couldn’t hold back a laugh at the face Steve was making. “Oh man, I’ve got so much to catch you up on.” But his smile quickly faded when it dawned on him that he couldn’t really do that. There wasn’t a future here. Well, not for Steve at least.
Tony looked over to where Steve had been sitting while he drew, and the other man was nowhere to be seen, his sketchpad laying abandoned on the chair instead. It belatedly occurred to Tony that he wasn’t chilling anymore because a rather warm blanket had been tucked around him.
When he went to bed that night, Tony laid awake for hours, knowing that there had to be more that he could do.
“I think Buck developed a sixth sense for when I was about to get my ass kicked.” Steve’s expression was full of warmth and happiness, and Tony was relieved the man was able to think of his friend without being weighed down by guilt anymore. “He used to say that he never had to throw the first punch ‘cuz by the time he’d get there, I’d have already thrown at least three.”
“Coffee might also help,” Rhodey added with a playful smirk as he put the chair back from where he’d pulled it.
“Ready for the Vulcan mind meld?” Tony asked, wiggling his fingers at Rogers to try to ease the tension.
Steve looked up as Tony walked into the room, cradling a cup of fresh coffee in his hands like a lifeline.
While he was waiting for Steve, Tony went to the kitchen and made himself a cup of coffee to warm up from the chill of being outside in the snow for so long earlier. Though after what he saw in Steve’s bedroom, maybe a cold shower would have been a better idea.
“Yep, but they didn’t actually need me there. I’d rather be here tonight, anyway.” He sat up to put his now empty coffee cup on the table then promptly returned to plastering himself to Steve’s side. “What are we watching?”
“Hey, bud,” Tony reached out and gently poked the cat’s exposed (and extremely soft) belly in a halfhearted attempt to wake him up. “Naptime’s over.”
“Okay, that’s— not gonna lie, that’s kinda hot, but are you gonna make it across the yard like this?” Tony asked teasingly, as he wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist.
Tony actually had to think about it. “...Probably not since I was a little kid. My parents weren’t really big on the whole Christmas thing. Usually it was just company parties and wining and dining clients and whatnot.”
The old wooden box was full of drawing supplies, pencils and pieces of charcoal and chalk. He glanced over his shoulder at Steve, who was still rooted to the spot and looking just as furious as he had during their first argument.
“Right, okay. I’m just gonna—“ Tony left the room before he said anything weirder than he already had.
Even though Barnes was no longer a pilot, somehow Rogers had found a way to bring him along to the Malibu Shatterdome. Tony was also fairly certain he had somehow guilted Fury into finding a position for Barnes as a trainer for new recruits, but Fury would probably rather lose his other eye than admit he had a soft spot for any of the rangers.
“I’ve got some good news, Tony.” Her voice was way too chipper for this hour of the day. Thankfully, she took his incoherent garble as a response.
“Unfortunately, my name is on the deed, but not for long. I’m sure some developer would love a property like this. That stupid lake would be a great parking lot once it’s filled in.” Suddenly Tony was standing, too, and walking around the side of the table to stand toe to toe with Steve. He wasn’t quite sure why he was picking a fight like this, but it felt way more tempting than backing down.
He hadn’t actually been inside this room yet, so he took a second to take it all in. It was fairly spartan with only a few personal effects here and there: a few sketchbooks among the books on a shelf, some framed photographs sitting on the desk. Presumably, the handsome, smirking brunet with his arm thrown around Steve’s shoulders in one of the photos must be Bucky (Steve’s
The little guy didn’t seem to mind the whole ordeal and eagerly gobbled up the treats Nat gave him for being such a good boy. Maybe Tony would warm up to the cat now that he wasn’t a potential fluffball of destruction. Steve had assumed that was perhaps the issue, or maybe it was just that Tony probably didn’t have any pets growing up. Howard didn’t seem like the type, and Tony’s childhood hadn’t sounded very warm or loving from the offhand comments he sometimes disguised as jokes.
He caught a glimpse of a bashful smile before Steve ducked to hide it, but he definitely couldn’t hide the blush that was spreading up his neck. Oooh, boy.
“I don’t know how long it’d been, maybe a year or so after I died. Ma’s family moved away, so no one had found out about my… situation. But for some reason, my pal Buck came by during Christmastime and found me here, ya know, like this.” He vaguely gestured to himself. “We looked for some way to fix whatever had happened, but nothing we found worked…”
He was answered by Thor’s deep, rumbling laughter. “He has expressed that the infantile voices you use while speaking to him are quite amusing.”
“Pep could do way better than me anyway. I’m kind of a piping hot mess a lot of the time.” He shrugged.
“Look at that,” Tony motioned to the cat absolutely sound asleep on top of Steve. “You’re like his personal kitty furnace.”
The man dropped his hands from his face, revealing a weary expression that looked almost out of place on such a young face. He nodded but didn’t volunteer any details.
Before Tony could even begin to parse what he had seen, a massive cloud of dust blew in, causing him to reflexively shield his eyes even though he knew it wasn’t real. There was so much more dust than there had been before. The buildings around him are suddenly much smaller, and it dawned on him that it looked like he was in some sort of wild west town. He was standing in what seemed to be the middle of the desert, dry earth crunching underneath his heavy boots as he took a few curious steps towards the closest building.
Clint insisted on naming him “Orion” and kept talking about a galaxy like he was quoting something. Steve later found out Clint had gotten the name from a cat in a movie instead of the constellation itself, and once Clint found out that Steve hadn’t seen Men in Black yet, an impromptu movie marathon had happened.
“Big hulking shadow in the hallway? Can’t really say I’d want to be his neighbor,” Tony answered through a mouthful of food. “Is that the guy you mentioned steering clear of yesterd—“
That night, Tony just couldn’t manage to fall asleep, tossing and turning until he finally gave up. With a huff, he threw back the blankets and fumbled his way out of bed, cursing when his bare feet touched the chilly wooden floor. He found socks that he’d carelessly left on the floor at some point and wiggled them on before he headed downstairs for a glass of water or something.
Confused, Steve had just kinda scrunched his face at that one (and Tony shouldn’t have found it as endearing as he did, oh boy, when he wasn’t scowling he was unfortunately cute).
That seemed to have caught Steve off guard a bit, his eyes went a little wide and the red on his cheeks reached his ears now. “You don’t have to take your clothes off for this.”
It was just a chaste kiss, nothing like Tony was used to sharing, and it was better than he could have ever imagined. All traces of the frigid cold that had once surrounded Steve like an impenetrable shield were gone, and instead he was very faintly warm, not quite like a living body, but not quite as ghostly as he had felt before.
“Hey, Tones,” he started when Tony answered the phone, a hint of mischief in his voice. “Pepper told me you’ve got a bit of a Casper the Friendly Ghost situation going on. Do we need to call in the Ghostbusters?”
“Hey Tony,” Steve had greeted him while getting out what looked like ingredients to make hot chocolate. Because Steve, for all that he had quickly caught up with the modern world, was still adorably old fashioned. “I didn’t know you had a cat.”
“So, does that mean we can do that again?” Tony starts, words coming out in a rush. “Because it’s probably the best use of whatever oxygen we have left and—”
He froze as he felt Steve stirring behind him, but Steve just pulled Tony closer to his body before he proceeded to bury his face between Tony’s shoulder blades. Huh. Captain America is a cuddler. Tony filed that tidbit of information away for future use.
Steve scrunched up his face at the last bit, obviously not feeling the imagery there. It was kinda adorable in that Steve sorta way, but Tony wasn’t about to let himself get distracted.
Eventually, Tony felt Steve shift and lean away from him, so he let go. Steve peeked out from under the blanket, eyes locking onto Tony’s, and the emotion he found in them was overwhelming.
He went back to piddling around, waiting for Steve to be done with whatever the hell he was doing, and eventually Tony found himself in the study again. He had the feeling that he should really be doing something better with his time, so he settled in and started on a last ditch effort to find answers of any kind, even though he’d read any articles about Steve or his family enough times to have them memorized now.
“So Captain America is a smartass now? And sadistic, too.” Tony went on. “The American public will be heartbroken if they find out.”
“You can stop now,” Steve told him as he took Tony’s hand in his. “You’ve done more than enough for me.”
It was quiet after that, and Tony didn’t attempt to make more conversation in case he shoved his other foot in his mouth. He returned his focus to the search and was about to chalk it up as a lost cause since they hadn’t found anything of note yet. There were boxes upon boxes of stuff that looked like it had maybe belonged to Steve’s aunt, and the rest looked like it belonged to the inn. They had yet to uncover anything that belonged to Steve himself, or anything that even related to him in any sort of personal way.
“You? Surely not.” Steve shot him a sly grin, and Tony felt his cheeks heat a little at that. Oh boy, this had the potential to be dangerous.
He’d probably checked the clock a good fifteen times while getting ready, nervousness setting in knowing their time was almost out. Figuring it’d be fine to head down a few minutes early, Tony hustled down to the dining room, not wanting to waste another moment that he could spend with Steve.
Back in the sitting room, he found plastic totes of ornaments stacked near the tree. Tony peeked out the window, but he didn’t see Coulson’s truck, so he must have left while Tony was talking to Steve. Which, really, was fine by him because he didn’t particularly want a third wheel during the tree decorating. Phil must’ve gathered from their conversation at the tree lot that Tony was doing this all for Steve.
When he didn’t answer her, she continued. “I’ll see what I can do about things here on my end, but can you do me a favor?”
The cat squirmed slightly in his arms while they rode up in the elevator, but Tony couldn’t really tell if he was actually asleep or just pretending to be so he could hitch a free ride. It was fine. He’d just drop the little guy off on the common floor and then maybe go take a nap of his own. There was a stiffness settled in his back, and he was starting to feel like hell after pulling all-nighters these days. Maybe he really was getting too old for this shit.
“Nope, take it all back, Pep.” He interrupted, putting down the doughnut. “I don’t want bribery doughnuts, it ruins the taste.”
“Coffee,” Steve grumbled, voice still tinged with sleep as he wiggled past Tony to get off the couch.
Unable to shake the odd feeling, Tony cautiously peeked over towards the door, not quite sure who or what to expect. His eyes met golden ones peering through the glass, and he breathed out a sigh of relief that he didn’t know he was holding.
“You know what, that is one question that I’m okay with not having the answer to,” he replied, giving Steve a quick peck of a kiss.
“Ah, Mr. Stark.” The man greeted calmly, clearly not surprised by Tony’s presence at least. “Ms. Potts told me you’d be arriving sometime today.” He held out a hand for Tony to shake. “Phil Coulson, I’m the manager of the inn. It’s nice to meet you.”
Tony sighed as he turned away from his project, motioning for JARVIS to turn his music down, and fully faced Orion where he practically had his adorable face plastered to the door, getting little kitty noseprints all over the glass.
“Is this our thing now?” Tony asked the cat the next time he appeared at the door wanting to be left inside. “Or did Steve put you up to this?”
do whatever the fuck it was that the two who were fighting each other did, alright?” He added with a roguish smirk. Steve gently placed a hand over Tony’s, and it was like the siren faded into the distance as he gazed into Steve’s clear blue eyes. He couldn’t help but notice the way those eyes briefly darted down to his lips.
“Sounds very Hallmark-y, gross.” He made a face. “If it’s that much trouble, you can just have it, I don’t care. Merry Christmas.”
But he decided to just enjoy the moment and not question it. As Steve let himself lean into Tony, he thought he heard a tiny sigh of contentment come from the other man. His eyelids were drooping shut, and he looked like he was about to drift off to sleep at any moment now that he was wrapped up like a burrito in the blanket. Steve gently rested his head against the top of Tony’s and returned his focus back to whatever stupid movie was playing on TV.
“What? There’s no way. That had to be at least like, five minutes, pushing seven probably.” There was a pause as something dawned on him. “You were timing me.”
“Funny thing is, well, not really so funny, but my dad’s gone, too. Actually...” He stopped to scoff. “He was the one behind the wheel. There was uh… a car accident. Howard always acted like he was invincible, even more so after knocking back a bottle of scotch. They both died on impact.”
think they are?” Tony insisted. “Come on, I know you graduated at the top of your cadet class, don’t hold back.”
Tony honed in on that last part. “That reminds me, if you’re only here for twelve days out of the year, where are you the rest of the time? Please tell me it’s somewhere warmer.” He tried for a joke at the end to break the tension, but it didn’t seem to have worked.
But Steve Rogers was a smartass and incredibly stubborn to the extent that he constantly gave Tony a run for his money in that regard. He was a dork who actually enjoyed the terribly cheesy movies Clint forced the team to watch, and sometimes he’d come down to draw in Tony’s workshop for god only knows what reason. Steve wasn’t anything like Tony had assumed from their confrontation on the helicarrier, and it was possible he might like him more than he did Captain America.
This time he waited until Steve was finished helping with the dishes and turned around. He chucked the phone directly at Steve’s chest, only for the phone to simply pass through him and hit the cabinet with a
Steve leans closer, and suddenly lips are gently pressing against Tony’s, and the rush of guilt ebbs away. It takes a second before he realizes he should probably kiss Steve back. His lips are a little bit chapped, but the softness and warmth are heavenly in the chill of the escape pod.
Steve crossed the workshop to stand next to the table Orion was sitting on and reached out to get a better look at the orb-shaped pendant dangling from his collar. Upon closer inspection, Steve realized it must be some sort of replica of the galaxy from the Men in Black movie he’d watched with Clint. The detail was amazingly intricate, and it was actually smaller than what he remembered from the movie’s version of it.
He brushed his hands off on his pajama pants, just in case there was anything on them, before he reached up and pulled one off the shelf, handling it with the utmost care since the sketchbooks were so old. The pages weren’t as yellowed as Tony had expected, so someone must have kept them in storage, maybe bringing them out whenever it was time for Steve to show up in December every year. Probably Coulson, Tony suspected.
Once Tony had changed out of his damp clothes, he gave himself a once-over in the mirror to make sure he’d gotten all the pine needles out of his hair— absolutely not because he wanted to look good in front of Steve. He picked out the last few stragglers and deemed himself presentable.
Bright, blue eyes met his own, and he was overwhelmed by the emotion in them. “You’ve given me more than enough. I’ve been miserable and angry for so long that I had lost myself to it. You pulled me out of that, that abyss… and I’m so thankful that you may be the one person out there that’s as stubborn as I am.”
When Steve answered, the light had returned to his eyes and his smile was amused again. “Maybe sometime.”
But everyone knew that side of Rogers, the hero with the near perfect kill rate until that final mission several months ago. After the initial commotion at his arrival on base, not many people paid attention to the man behind that story, the one who had stepped foot out of that helicopter looking like he was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.
He leaned back against the pillows, heart sinking as the loss settled in. It didn’t feel like Steve was gone to whatever awful place he was cursed to while he wasn’t haunting the halls of the inn; it was more like he was completely
Something felt… different, deep in his chest and in the atmosphere of the house, like something incredibly important was now missing. He grabbed his phone to double check the date, even though he already knew the answer. Steve was gone.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Can you repeat that first part?” Tony held his hand up to stop Steve and gave him a crooked grin. “I need to get ‘Tony, you were right’ on recording, I wanna set it as my ringtone.”
“Ah,” Tony said. “Well… maybe you should try again sometime? Not now, probably not even today, but just if you feel like it? Maybe something will have changed.” Steve seemed apprehensive, so Tony didn’t want to push him to try right then.
With a sigh, Steve relinquished his hold on the door and headed further into the room. Tony slipped inside and quietly closed the door behind him, keeping a wary eye on his troubled friend as he did so. It didn’t seem like Steve was going to start this conversation himself, so Tony went for it.
Eventually, almost the entire team slowly found their way to the living room throughout the movies, as it seemed word of the tower’s newest resident spread.
“I’m sorry.” Tony couldn’t quite bring himself to make eye contact with Steve in that moment. He cleared his throat after an uneasy pause. “Uh. Mine, too.”
It felt as though Barnes didn’t leave any room there for a comeback, so Tony nodded. At this point, he couldn’t avoid the conversation any longer, and neither of them were going to feel any better until he talked to Steve about it. Tony left the mess hall with only his barely warm coffee in hand; he didn’t have much of an appetite right now anyway.
“What room are we taking it to, Mr. Stark?” Coulson’s voice was steady. Clearly someone else wasn’t having as much trouble as Tony was.
“Alright,” with another sigh, Tony motioned for JARVIS to allow the cat in. The little guy beelined for Tony and began rubbing against his shins for attention then jumped up on the table to get a better look at what Tony was fiddling with. Quickly, Tony moved anything sharp away from Orion’s too curious paws just to be safe.
He put a bit of polish on the rag, careful to not use too much, thinking back to a time Jarvis had shown him when he was a kid. The dust was incredibly thick on the wooden cases, but after a few goes on each one, Tony had them looking almost good as new again. He used the other side of the rag to clean the cobwebs off the easel, and while he was working on it, he noticed that the screws needed a bit of oil. Recalling that he had noticed some in the hall closet while getting the rag, Tony went back and got it, applying just enough for the screws to turn smoothly again.
Tony wasn’t entirely sure why he was sharing this bit of information with Steve, but it just felt like he needed to, like out of all of the people out there, he would understand. And he did.
. Tony surged forward, threading his fingers through Steve’s hair and deepening the kiss, licking into Steve’s mouth and capturing the taller man’s soft gasp.
“That’s a bit pot and kettle coming from the man who flew a nuke into a portal to space,” Steve added, his own voice coming out softer than he expected.
Hoping to find something— absolutely anything— that he may have overlooked before, Tony started to sort through the newspapers again, combing over the articles carefully for any trace of something that might have been related to Steve. He’d honestly lost track of time when Steve surprised him by gently taking the paper out of his hand and setting it on the table.
“Is it coming back now?” Tony asked, quietly, even though the answer was clear through Steve’s body language.
“Definitely feeling like a third wheel right now.” Steve chimed in from where he was watching from the couch.
is he here? The hell kind of unfinished business does he have? That’s usually their deal in stories.”
After that, Steve couldn’t stop watching how Tony would interact with the cat. He didn’t think he was imagining that Tony was interacting more with Orion when the team was together. He noticed Tony giving the cat a little head pat here and there, or sometimes he’d find Tony feeding him, which had been really unexpected, honestly.
After trimming the tree, the two of them spent the rest of the day just kinda near each other. Tony had some S.I. stuff to look over before the holidays truly kicked in, and Steve settled down in the same room, reading one of his dog-eared books. Briefly, Tony thought about getting him a new one, but he probably wouldn’t even be able to touch it. Would finding an old copy in nice condition work?
“I found him in the garage!” Steve defended himself. “And then he followed me up the elevator, acting like he knew where he was going, so I just assumed he lived here.”
He got a bashful smile from Steve in response to that, but then Steve waved it off. “A guy like you wouldn’t have given me a second look back then.”
Steve relaxed a bit at the change of subject, settling back in his chair. “Well, we never did a whole lot because we didn’t really have the money. Not that it mattered to me. Having time with Ma when she’d get off work was always the best part.” His smile had taken on a wistful feeling. “She always made sure I had a present to unwrap, even if it was just an orange. Sometimes she’d manage to get me a new book, though.”
The answer he received was the warmest smile he thought he’d ever seen directed at himself before Steve pulled him close and brought their lips together in a tender kiss.
“Hate to break it to you, Rogers.” Tony grinned at the man before continuing. “But I love a good puzzle. There’s no way I’m leaving now.”
“Are you?” Those beautiful blue eyes bore into Tony’s, like his soul was being laid bare before they even began. “What you’re about to see… it’s a lot.”
That seemed to have brought Steve back to reality, at least. He could have sworn he almost saw a smile on his face as he finally turned away from the window.
Steve couldn’t help but tease him for earlier to lighten the mood a bit. “So, you call the cat ‘honeybuns?’”
As luck would have it, the elevator doors opened on Bruce’s floor, and the scientist raised his eyebrow in an unimpressed look at Tony.
It was starting to snow, big flakes slowly drifting from grey clouds above the city, and the brisk winter air whipped against his jacket as he turned down the avenue leading back to the tower. It was a little too cold to be out, but according to the forecast it was only going to get worse for the next week, and Steve had been getting a bit stir-crazy in the tower. No supervillains or criminal organizations had tried to take over or destroy the city in the week since Christmas, and quite frankly he had been getting bored going through the same routine day in and day out while it seemed too cold for bad guys to even bother going outside.
The pair stopped by a pet store on the way back and picked up anything and everything that a cat could ever possibly need. Steve mentally went down the list of things Tony had mentioned earlier to make sure essentials weren’t missed in the rush of enthusiasm.
“It’s… hard, isn’t it?” There was more emotion in Steve’s eyes than when he had slipped into his memories of loss earlier.
Steve huffed a laugh against the back of Tony’s neck. “I’m not… great at these things, so I thought I’d let my drawings speak for me.”
Right. No ghosts, just eerily calm innkeepers. Tony shook his hand then gestured vaguely in the direction of the front door. “I think that was the appraiser I was supposed to be meeting.”
“Thank you, JARVIS,” Steve answered before quickly heading down to Tony’s workshop to see what in the world could possibly be going on.
Quietly, Tony slipped into the kitchen and was steadfastly trying to ignore Steve and the cat, but he didn’t manage to escape with his coffee before Steve greeted him, thankfully without passing any judgement for Tony clearly not having slept yet.
“Okay, it’s finished. Come here, honeybuns.” Tony wiggled his fingers at the cat to motion him closer so he could attach what he was working on to Orion’s collar.
At that, Steve burst into laughter again, throwing his head against the back of the couch. “I was wondering how long you’d last like that,” he finally got out between laughs.
Suddenly drained of his energy, Tony dramatically flopped onto the couch and poked at Steve’s leg with his foot. “Were you just going to let me suffer in silence?”
“You know, they say after you drift with someone, that you feel like there’s nothing to talk about,” he started. “But I think I deserve an explanation after… whatever the hell that was.”
“You know,” Tony said, getting Steve’s attention. “If I came back from the dead, I’d be eating something a lot more exciting than a grilled cheese.”
Tony noticed Steve tense for a moment, but it only lasted a moment before he nodded again. “Yeah, that’s fine.”
“So what, we’re destined to find each other no matter the universe we’re in?” Steve smiled hesitantly.
Distantly, Tony knew he shouldn’t follow the sounds, but he couldn’t fight the draw to it as he moved down a corridor towards the source. He had to know despite the sense of dread gnawing at his stomach. He could faintly make out voices above the sound of the clashing echoes he was following; voices like harsh whispers that rang out in his mind.
“Anything that involves preheating is self-serve,” Steve shot back as he rifled through the cupboards for popcorn and chips.
“I’d stay very still if I were you, Captain Rogers,” said another voice Steve recognized as Sitwell’s. And then Steve gasped as something stung sharply up his nasal cavity and into his skull. The hand holding his hair disengaged, and Steve was able to sit forward, taking in the room: Sitwell, backing away from him, Rumlow, leering at him from the opposite wall, Ward, clenching his jaw and gripping the holster of his gun, and Tony, tied to a metal chair, duct tape over his mouth and a large gash over his left eye.
James grabbed both of Tony's shoulders and stood, pulling him up with him like he was a rag doll. "Seriously, Tony. I don't have time to explain everything to you. I'm - I'm not who I say I am, but you were right about this being dangerous, okay? So just go. You'll be fine if you just
Of course, the potential of a real friendship with Tony was already too far beyond Steve’s initial expectations for him to entertain hopes of anything more. Tony had just gotten out of a relationship with someone he still loved and trusted. And Steve was pretty sure he wouldn’t have been Tony’s type anyway. But Tony didn’t seem to mind his company. He’d even started seeking Steve out in the gym sometimes to spar or to lounge on a workout bench and talk about his latest project while Steve boxed a punching bag.
"Okay, first of all, and for the four hundredth time: JARVIS sweeps all the residential floors before I enter, so you can stop doing the whole ‘Eagle has landed’ routine every time we change rooms. Second, and more importantly, did you just
“You need to sleep,” Bruce retorted more firmly. “You’ve been in down here for days, and you’ve consumed enough of that –” he gestured at the open bottle of vodka “– to strip the paint off the quinjet.”
But Steve could see immediately what Dr. Banner was, because just then he came careening up the stairs at the end of the hallway, Thor right behind him. Bruce was looking a little too close to Thor’s height, and he had gone ominously green around the neck, which was probably why Thor was repeating the lines Natasha had developed to calm the Hulk in the field. Unfortunately, some of Natasha’s soothing effect seemed to be getting lost in Thor’s energetic delivery.
Tony rose from his chair, giving Coulson a mock salute. He was almost to the door before Coulson called out a final time.
He ran one hand through his hair in frustration, and Natasha shifted slightly back toward the footage, giving him space but maintaining contact through the slight pressure of her feet on his lap.
Steve’s eyes held his for a long moment, and Tony wished, not for the first time, that he could see whatever battle Steve fought against himself in these moments. Normally, Tony’s instinct would be to experiment until he got a bigger reaction: to find a pressure point to squeeze or a sensitive spot to needle. But right now, Tony realized, all he wanted to do was to run his thumb gently along Steve’s jaw until the tension drained away.
“Sunday, technically,” Steve responded, his eyes dropping to the thin sliver of skin that Tony’s stretch had revealed at his waistline.
“Sorry if I scared you,” she confirmed, detaching herself from the doorframe with a graceful curl of her shoulders. “I sleepwalk: the most unbelievable nightmares. Then again,” she stepped closer, looking up at him coyly, “maybe it’s you who should be apologizing. After all, you’re the one who has a gun pointed at me in my own house.”
“The first meeting today is with a delegation of farmers from the south,” Steve announced, turning to retrieve a stack of ledgers from an oak cabinet in the corner of the room. “They are petitioning for relief from their taxes, which have just been raised by Lord Hammer.”
“You don’t like to be handed things,” Natasha finished for him, pushing the glass across the table instead.
“I’ll text the team updates about how long it takes Pepper to strangle me with my own tie, if you want to take bets,” Tony offered. “And don’t let Barton talk everyone into air-vent laser tag. He’s been asking, and the answer is no. Not while I’m not here to kick his ass.”
Most people wouldn’t do what you did for me through love alone. They need a little hopelessness too. And who is filled with despair at the impossibility of human connection and the futility of moral effort on
Rumlow drew his gun and started to move toward the struggle, but Tony lunged forward with his own, suddenly free right hand and – using a grip they had practiced while sparring – broke Rumlow’s wrist. Rumlow howled and dropped the gun, and Steve leveled a sharp punch at Ward’s jaw before rolling to the side to grab the firearm. Ward had stayed down after the last punch, so Steve trained the gun on Rumlow as he moved slowly to collect the other weapon.
“Did you find anything else in the collection?” Grant asked carefully. “Anything about a code name - or a shield?”
The speech had poured out of Steve in a rush of feeling. But now Tony was staring at him with an inscrutable expression on his face, and Steve felt a flush creeping up the back of his neck. That had probably been too much, he thought ruefully, because Tony’s eyes were searching his face, and Natasha was giving him a smirk across the table that looked too knowing by half.
“A special person,” Steve replied. It didn’t quite explain the flowers, but it had the virtue of being true. And it seemed like a simpler explanation than, “the wealthy client I’m paid to protect just wiped the floor with a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I’m looking for a gift that threads the needle between ‘generic professional sentiment’ and ‘I’ve recently developed an interest in cooking you dinner and washing your hair.’”
All five of them whirled toward the source of the unexpected sound. Because those words had been spoken by a voice Steve hadn’t heard since he stood in the command center of the helicarrier. They had been spoken by a voice he’d thought he would never hear again. An impossible voice.
“Come out, my tiny, murderous robot sons,” Tony called, “or I’m going to turn your favorite tree into a pile of toothpicks.”
Tony clicked to the next slide, which displayed his favorite photo of Carter. It was a wartime shot, and she was in uniform, leaning back against a jeep in the midst of a group of soldiers. Tony had always loved its candidness - the easy posture Carter adopted with the enlisted men - and he glanced out at the audience to check its effect.
“I was technically dead for seventy years,” Steve retorted. “And I’ve been wanting to do this for almost as long as I’ve been alive again.”
“You know I’m durable, Tony,” Steve said, his eyes falling shut as cold relief rippled out from each place where one of Tony’s fingers made contact with the cloth.
“We’ll go see if we can rustle up some better food than that travesty of a mac-and-cheese dinner they were bringing around earlier,” Sam offered, rising to his feet along with Wanda and Natasha. “While we’re gone, maybe you can think about why you kept muttering his name the whole time they were prepping you for surgery.”
“Tony,” he said softly, and something in the tone of his voice made Tony’s stomach flutter and settle at the same time. “How are you feeling? Do you need anything? I was going to try to make you coffee, but —” He gestured ruefully at the machine with a small smile. “I might have accidentally changed its operating language to Klingon instead.”
“I didn’t know for sure until today,” he explained. “Loki told me Bucky was alive – back in New York, when he was impersonating me after the battle. I didn’t tell anyone at the time, because it took me a while to even remember what Loki had said. Getting hit with the staff made the whole thing feel like a dream. And then I wasn’t sure whether it was true or whether he was just manipulating me. I didn’t want to get my hopes up. But when I saw the Winter Soldier outside my apartment, he caught my shield, and I was almost positive I recognized his eyes.”
“The dwarves are reading some promising heat signatures on the third floor, northwest corner,” came a voice that May had introduced as Leopold Fitz.
Steve’s foot slipped slightly on the final rung of the ladder. He tried to cover the misstep by exaggerating his hop to the ground; but judging by Natasha’s wry expression, he didn’t think he’d succeeded.
Tony felt something twist in his stomach, and he wound it into an angry knot before it could start pinching at his insides.
The sour feeling was still roiling in Tony’s gut, and he couldn’t shake the image of Steve crashing through metal, taking punches, hardly even trying to protect himself.
He never got to finish the sentence, because at that moment there was a high-pitched whine, and Harrison went limp, one eye lurching to the side as the explosive detonated.
“We were right in the middle of a procedure,” complained someone who Tony assumed must be new to Avengers medical care.
With a sound almost closer to a moan than a creak, one of the doors that Tony had just tried swung open behind them, sending a shaft of warm light cutting across the hallway.
Tony’s eyes snapped up from his phone, where Rhodey had caught him checking the Avengers group chat yet again.
“I saw the PowerPoint, Tony,” Steve smirked. “I bought two more pairs after that meeting just to let you know how much of an impression you made with that, ‘Dockers: A Human Tragedy’ slide.”
But the woman at the register seemed relaxed: no fidgeting hands or beads of sweat or any of the other indicators of stress that people about to accost a celebrity usually displayed.
“Sorry, Cap, reunion’s over,” he said, blasting forward to scoop Steve over one shoulder and fly them both upward, away from the circle of armored vehicles squealing into place around them. Steve let out one noise of frustration and then went silent, and Tony was almost glad that the armor made it impossible to feel the tension he knew was probably radiating off of him as they flew out of D.C.
“Sorry to interrupt, but I have to borrow Dr. Grant here,” he announced, wrapping a hand around Grant’s upper arm for reasons that were purely tactical, “there’s an oil-paint-related emergency in the Fine Arts building that is very real and definitely not something I’m making up right now to get him out of this conversation. Thanks for coming - always a pleasure to get another question about ontology from the author of both ‘Ten Ways of Thinking about Ontology’ and ‘Ten More Ways of Thinking about Ontology.’”
going to drink burnt drip coffee from the cafeteria for four years), and Steve had never learned to use it — being, as he was, one of those horrible people who leapt into their gym shoes and out the door for a jog every morning with no more fuel than a chug of Gatorade.
. He flipped back to the index and ran his index finger through the B’s until it rested on the blank space between “Brooch Key” and “brother, Michael.”
Steve flushed rapidly, his eyes snapping toward the elevator door. He hit the button for the residential floor, mentally kicking himself for the obvious slip.
“Do it. Tony! Listen to me.” He clenched his jaw around a fresh wave of agony. “We just need enough of a current to fry the explosive without cooking my brain. The device could blow any second, and then I won’t be able to get you out.”
If the gym weren't an extremely inappropriate place to ask someone out, Tony would have seen if he could get his runner's high in another way today. He slipped into the locker room and changed. He grabbed his wraps in case he decided to box, but with his focus all over the place, the treadmill seemed like a better idea.
“Yes, well, I took the absolutely unprecedented step of asking her if she’d like to go out some time,” she replied, arching one eyebrow at him meaningfully. “You might give that a try next time you’re tempted to hurl tequila across the room to get Steve's attention.”
“I love you too!” Tony yelled as he flipped the switch, and then all the anguish in his voice was pulsing through Steve’s body until everything went black.
“It was the brain child of Clint, Tony’s new propulsion system, and a lot of Asgardian mead, so no – probably not,” Natasha responded.
Dr. Coulson looked up from his papers and managed to visibly sigh without moving or exhaling. "For you? Never."
“Let’s just say I think I’ve got a shot at the popular vote,” Steve replied affably. And then the bastard
“Will you shut up and just let me handle something for once, Rogers?” Tony muttered. “Quit trying to backseat-drive your own rescue.”
, of all the pathetic gestures. Steve would be in the room right now, ready to protect Tony – ready to do his
Further back, a quicker fix: when Fury handed him the Winter Soldier’s files, he would drive straight to New York and tell Tony his suspicions. Even if Tony smiled when Steve walked out of the elevator – one of those thousand-watt grins that crinkled the lines around Tony’s eyes and squeezed a fist around Steve’s heart – Steve wouldn’t hesitate, wouldn’t be tempted to put it off until he had soaked up just a little more light. He would give himself no time to wonder whether those smiles could ever be his to keep.
If it was possible for Coulson’s face to soften, it softened, and he gave Tony one more considering look before straightening the stack of papers in front of him with a deft sweep of one hand.
Of course, that explanation raised as many questions as it provided answers. HYDRA was an acronym Tony had never come across, for example. Not to mention -
He disappeared momentarily behind a row of shelves, and Tony pulled back a chair from the long wooden table in the middle of the room. He perched on the edge of the seat and fished out his phone and notebooks, trying to fit Arnie’s revelations into the framework of what he knew about Peggy Carter.
“Save me the speech, Rogers. It’s not my first solider this time, right? I remember the spiel. He knew the risks, and we did everything we could, and I can’t blame myself. But he was practically a kid and now he’s dead. So if it’s okay with you, I’m going to skip the whole ‘died a hero’ part and go get blindingly drunk.”
“Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” Tony greeted her. “Still sneaking up on people to scare the shit out of them I see.”
have time to squeeze in a trip to the storage unit the next morning, because he woke up to an email announcing that all classes at Stanley College were canceled in expectation of a blizzard.
Tony felt a slow grin spreading across his face, and he looked instinctively back toward Steve to see if he had noticed Natasha’s adaptation to the game. But when he met Steve’s gaze, the grin stuck, only halfway formed. Because Steve was staring directly at him, his jaw and brow set into hard lines that (as Tony had learned through painful experience) were Steve’s tell for, “wearing a parachute would only slow me down.”
He cracked one eyelid, and his suspicion was confirmed by the sight of Steve bent over a small row of buttons, his brows contracted in frustration as he tried to figure out which settings to use. Tony smiled into his pillow. The espresso machine had been his one big concession to his family’s wealth (he may be living in the dorms to annoy Howard, but he was
"Normally takes new faculty at least two months to be chased out of the student-center gym by grade change requests."
Steve cut Tony off by lifting him easily off the ground, holding his weight with one hand under his thigh and one at his back until Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist.
“Oh no, Tony,” Steve said seriously, already slicing precise lines down his pumpkin’s surface. “I’m sure I couldn’t possibly create anything as elaborate as that.”
He broke off, struggling to push back the desperation clawing at his throat. He was just about to start trying precordial thumps when, from outside the room, he heard the unmistakable sounds of Clint Barton clearing a hallway.
legend – would bristle at the tone he’d taken. But instead he watched as a grin spread slowly across the billionaire’s face.
“We’re going to take a few more minutes in small groups,” Tony announced to the class, already pulling up the blog in question. “If you’ve finished your two questions, try to come up with a bonus question that links today’s topic to a piece of pop culture - the more obscure the better.”
Steve was smiling now, feeling his shoulders relax as Tony’s expression loosened. Maybe Tony heard the smile in his voice, because he gave a theatrical sigh and flopped toward Steve, propping himself up on one elbow so he could look at Steve’s face.
From somewhere on the bedside table, Steve’s phone erupted with the voice of Whitney Houston, the violin track reaching a crescendo just as Tony and Steve broke apart.
“I was just about to come up,” he said. “I have a few finishing touches left here and then I’m all yours, Cap. Give me everything that can survive being the tiniest bit overcooked.”
The last time, that was, until yesterday, when he had gotten word that a mission in Lagos had ended with Steve jumping shield-first onto an exploding Brock Rumlow. That night Tony had woken up in a cold sweat, having dreamed once again of watching the light go out of a pair of brilliant blue eyes, and he had been on the road headed out of the city before the sun rose.
“Not exactly,” Tony hedged. “Let’s say it seems like someone was hoping to use him, but things didn’t go according to plan. Like I said, it’s being handled.”
In the split second during which Tony hesitated, the Soldier heaved backward, using his weight and Tony’s grasp on his arm to flip Tony onto his back. Tony made a grab at the Soldier’s face, but the man’s fist was already descending toward the arc reactor on Tony’s chest. Tony just managed to close one gauntlet around the edges of the Soldier’s mask before the body looming over him was gone: Steve had launched himself in between them, tackling the Solider to the ground.
Steve’s hands had touched him countless times: unlacing his boots, removing his cloak, tightening the straps of his armor. But Tony was suddenly aware that he had barely touched Steve since they were teenagers – not since the night before his coronation, when he’d run down to the stables with a satchel of pilfered dinner rolls to tell Steve to get two horses ready to ride. The old Steward, Jarvis, had been worried about Tony’s readiness for the ceremony so soon after his parents’ death, and Tony had made a show of retiring early to rest and prepare. He had related as much to Steve as they crouched behind the hay bales and Tony explained his plan. They could be well on their way to Wakanda or Asgard, he had promised, before anyone would notice they were gone.
“Sir, there are multiple vehicles converging on this location,” JARVIS said. “They are marked as law enforcement, but I suspect –”
Steve shut his eyes against the sudden blaze of pain tearing through his chest, but the view his mind supplied was no better. Agent Harrison was stretched out limp on the floor of the helicopter, except it was Bucky on an exam table; it was Tony crushed by water and twisted metal. Tony, whose hands were so deft and gentle as they cupped Steve’s chin, was falling off the train, and Steve was never there in time –
“It does?” Steve asked, the pressure against Tony’s chest lightening as Steve pulled back to search Tony’s face.
“He’s already healed well enough to embarrass me on the mats,” Sam winced, rubbing the back of his neck.
“Dr. Stark?” a student in the front row asked hesitantly, and Tony blinked at her for a moment before remembering where he was.
He laid his hand over Tony’s where it was pressed to his side, but Tony jerked back as if he’d been burned, leaving Steve to hold the pocket square in place.
“Stay back,” Steve barked, and then he was ricocheting his shield off the walls again, spinning out in pursuit of their new attackers. There were only three of them, and after a few well-aimed throws the coast was clear to the northwest corner.
Steve had been so young when he made this deal, Tony remembered – so much younger than Tony had been when he shot his way out of a cave, already on borrowed time. Steve had thought he was signing up to die for people. He couldn’t have imagined the highest cost of his bravery would be that he’d have to outlive them.
“You told me you weren’t interested,” Tony repeated slowly. “Would it help jog your memory if I reenacted the scene where it happened?” He took one step to the left with exaggerated precision. “There: reenactment complete.”
But he could only hold the team on pause for so long waiting for another shoe to belatedly drop. Tony was already behind on his work for Stark Industries. Thor and Bruce had never gotten to finish their research visit to New Mexico. And Fury wanted Steve, Natasha, and Clint for other missions. So Steve tried to put the unanswered questions to the back of his mind.
“Hey whoa,” Tony protested, holding up his hands to cut Steve off. “That’s bullshit, Steve. My business partner paid a network of goddamn assassins to take me out and frame you for the crime: that does not become your fault just because you stepped outside for your first smoke break in five months.”
“In position right next to you, probably doing lasting damage to my knees trying to crouch this long,” Tony stage-whispered, “ready to launch your star-spangled ass through a window because you think ‘tactical strike’ rhymes with ‘human projectile.’”
“You offering to go a few rounds?” Steve countered after a short pause. The buzzing in his chest had turned electric, throwing sparks across nerves that he hadn’t felt light up since their fight on the Helicarrier.
Steve grimaced, his chest suddenly feeling tight with the memory of why Tony had needed saving in the first place.
“Fuck that, Steve,” Tony snapped, popping back into view to slam one fist against the door. “I am not leaving you: do you hear me? I will stay right here, and the water will get through eventually, and then we’ll both drown, so you might as well use your stupid, miracle-of-modern-science muscles to open this goddamn door so I can get your stubborn ass out of here.”
“Aww Milk Duds no!” Clint complained as a small shower of chocolate pebbles bounced across the elevator floor.
When Steve reached the top of the stairs, he could see Tony moving through the hallway, trying each doorknob he passed in a succession of fruitless rattles.
After Simmons had given Steve the all-clear, the team had opted to have “celebratory margaritas” at the Tower, in spite of the near-total destruction of the common room. Steve suspected the other Avengers had agreed to the idea for the same reason Steve had suggested it: they wanted to be home together.
“BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!” Tony exploded. He sat back in his chair, and his whole body seemed suddenly to sag, as if someone had pulled a plug connected to his spine. “Jesus, Steve. You can probably remember the position of every piece in the game of chess we started last week, but you can’t see me making moves so goddamn obvious that even HYDRA clocked them.”
Ty’s face was slightly flushed from the alcohol, but his eyes were sharp as they roved over Tony’s slim tee-shirt and tailored jeans.
From his angle on the edge of the rooftop bar, Steve noticed three things in quick succession: (1) Tony was alive, and he was currently crouched behind the limited cover of an overturned table and couch; (2) there were two gunmen circling toward Tony’s position, and both of them would have clear shots in just under fifteen seconds; (3) Steve would only have time to take out one of the assailants before they fired.
He woke up in his own bed, his phone pinging as a doodle of DUM-E in an oversized Iron Man helmet appeared in the group text.
“What do we do?” Steve asked, holding one hand to the side of Harrison’s head to steady him as he convulsed in pain again.
“You’re the ones who attacked him,” Steve said, allowing some of the desperation he was suppressing to creep into his voice. “The wreck was all over the news. You killed him.”
“You’re the Black Widow,” he said finally, his voice sounding as if it cost him something to speak the words out loud.
“Ugh don’t remind me about the senate hearing,” Tony groaned. “Every time I get subpoenaed I end up saying something that requires me to buy Pepper another pair of shoes.”
Clint was across the room in a second, his hand snapping up over his shoulder, where he had strapped one of Tony’s briefcase suits to his back.
Not once since that conversation had he sought Steve’s touch. Not since Steve had set his jaw and shaken his head and called Tony “your majesty” – or since Tony had shoved Steve’s shoulder and forced a laugh and told him it had been a joke, obviously, so lighten up Rogers. The last time he’d reached out to feel the warmth of Steve’s skin, it had been to push him away.
When the smoke cleared and the ringing in his ears stopped, the first thing Steve could hear was JARVIS.
“Please just come up to the common room,” Bruce pleaded. “Thor is threatening to throw something called a ‘Shield-Brother Gjestebud.’”
Tony arrived at the Triskelion just after Clint and Natasha, who were debriefing with Steve outside the conference room. Natasha was still dressed in an evening gown, and Clint was sporting an impressive black eye, so they must have been pulled off their previous mission abruptly. Steve had changed from road-trip casual into a generic SHIELD tac suit that had absolutely no hope of making him look inconspicuous. Tony was just making a mental note to send Fury thank-you flowers for the particularly clingy cut of those pants when Steve looked over at him with a smile that was warm and shy, and – shit. He had to admit that Rhodey may have had the tiniest, most infinitesimal point, because Tony’s heart rate really should not be more responsive to a little smile than it was to super-soldier physique.
, Bruce scrawled under Tony’s note. Tony’s eyes narrowed. He remembered now that Justin Hammer had just started his post-tenure leave, but Tony had been sure the Fine Arts department had only hired for a one-year position.
“I don’t think that’s really helping your case, Tony. Natasha’s probably seeing Pepper more regularly than you are.”
If he did, Grant would probably come storming into his office all huffy and demand to take him to the hospital for a head injury anyway. Tony went straight to the Fine Arts building, his burning need to recover his file folder knocked sideways out of his head by the near crash, and found Dr. Grant's office.
He was about to leap to his feet, ready to make a run for Tony’s position, but before he could move, Tony was there in front of him, setting the first HYDRA agent’s gun on the ground so that he could assess the wound in Steve’s side.
be true: once Tony and Nat were clear, Steve could work on getting out, and maybe he could survive long enough to free himself from the sinking rig. Steve didn’t actually know what it would take to stop his heart, after all; and he had never been sure whether he would have drowned the first time if not for the ice.
There was so much else to apologize for – for not seeing the field clearly, for letting his feelings cloud his judgment, for leaving Tony alone – but before Steve could continue, they both froze at the sight of the third-floor door swinging open just two feet in front of them.
After a horrible silence that might have lasted a second or a century, Steve sat up with a rattling gasp. Tony barely had time to register the fact that he was now tucked in Steve’s lap before Steve had swept Rumlow’s gun off the ground and pointed it toward the door, his other arm curling Tony protectively toward his chest.
Steve reached down to pull his phone out of his pocket, flicked his fingers across the screen, and slid it across the table. Tony saw that it was open to the very earliest messages on the group text. The first three were from Tony: a link to a feature story about the Battle of New York that contained a clip of the Hulk punching Thor; a video of a hawk making a clumsy landing; a photo of the take-out menu for Thai Palace with the caption “next time Romanov has to order her own spring rolls.” After that the team had started chiming in: Natasha with a GIF of someone making a stabbing motion with scissors, and Clint with a text that said, “drubk on roof bring cheeetos.” Finally, the first photo from Steve appeared. He was lying in the grass, head propped against a bunched-up sweatshirt, holding a bag of Cheetos. “Hope someone saved Clint,” the caption read.
“Tony, calm down,” she told him, but there was no chance in hell of that, because the last thing he remembered was Steve’s face through plate glass, his head tilted slightly upward as the water rose around his neck.
He was almost to the first steps when he heard a muffled crack. The wall next to him buckled, and he had to dart quickly to the side to avoid the collapsing metal. His lungs screamed in protest, but he gripped the railing of the stairwell and hauled himself forward, kicking steadily as he made his way up.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up at what seemed like a simultaneously vague and specific request, and he was about to press Grant with a follow-up when they were cut off by the sharp buzz of a phone.
She looked on the verge of enlightening him further as to the specifics of his inanity, but they were cut off by the arrival of the Norwegian exchange student, Thor, and a very inebriated-looking Clint Barton.
“Third-party feeds?” Natasha asked, and of course she would zero in on the one thing Tony had hoped to breeze by. “Who else is looking?”
"Actually, you can have this one," Tony replied. "And my pie, and my weight machines, and probably all my summer funding or something." He turned away and stalked off towards the double doors that led outside. The weather had turned bitterly cold, and as soon as the frigid air hit him, Tony shivered.
“What – you’ve already got my replacement lined up?” Tony grinned. “Rhodey’s older than I am, you know, and he walks like the Tin Man for a full day if he falls asleep on the couch for too long. Don’t let him pull that ‘clean living’ line on you.”
“If everything looks like a wall to you,” Clint continued, stepping through the threshold into the next room, “it might be because you’re carrying the wall with you.”
“That’s best ‘fails,’ Norwegian Road House,” Tony said, “and my test flights weren’t failures. Technically, I made it into the air and back to the ground every time. The icing problem was a one-time thing.”
particular memory. Maybe the real Steve in his living room sensed some of what was in Tony’s thoughts, because he cleared his throat and set his jaw in determination.
“I didn’t know we were already picking favorites,” Tony complained, reaching out to grab an onion ring only to have Natasha slap his hand away with lightning speed.
“Two.” Rumlow gripped the back of Tony’s head and shoved the tub into place. Tony let out a strangled sound, and Steve didn’t have to engineer any bit of his desperation after that.
When Steve did wake up, it wasn’t on a couch or a bus but in a hospital bed. He felt it before he saw it: the rough drag of overwashed cotton against his arms, the soft tug of plastic on the back of his hand, and the pit in his stomach that warned him of what was missing from the room.
“Thank you,” Steve said softly, his gaze traveling across each member of the team before he turned back to Tony. “So what do you think?”
“I have a working theory,” Natasha continued, glancing up at him as she reached the floor. Steve sighed and holstered his gun so that he could follow her down. “I think you tell yourself that you follow him out of duty or loyalty. But that’s because you’re too afraid to admit your dirty little secret: that the only pleasure you really know how to let yourself feel is self-righteousness.”
“Extremely tactical,” Sam nodded, his face deadpan. Natasha was back to texting furiously, and Wanda seemed to be hiding her face behind her mug of tea. Vision looked as sedate as ever, but Tony noticed that his lips curled up slightly at whatever expression Wanda was trying to cover.
She and Steve were in the common room going over the footage Ward had brought them. They’d been at it for over an hour already – freezing frames, playing them backward, anything that might make something new pop out of the five-minute clip. But Steve had gotten distracted by the photo Tony had sent to the group text that morning. The picture had been taken in the foyer of the Malibu house: Tony was grinning manically, Pepper had her eyes raised to the ceiling in exasperation, and behind them loomed what appeared to be a giant stuffed rabbit.
“What?” Tony asked, pressing one hand to his chest in a display of innocence. “How will I ever get better, Brucie, if I don’t engage thoughtfully with my toughest critics?”
“Did someone say Ski Balls?” Thor asked excitedly, returning from the kitchen with a second bowl of popcorn and a pizza pan grinning with ginger snaps. “Maybe we could play a round before –”
Somewhere behind him, Tony swore furiously, and then the rifle was being ripped away. Steve looked around to see Tony slam the butt of the gun into the top of the attacker’s head – leaving the man Steve recognized vaguely as Jasper Sitwell to collapse in a heap – and then he was slumping down the wall behind him, his torso on fire with agony.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Tony,” he said blandly. “No one in their twenties can afford a house in this economy.”
Fitz and Simmons jumped onto the line, talking almost on top of each other as they reviewed the readings.
Steve didn’t move from his position until the door closed behind the marshal, and when he did it was not to return Tony’s gaze but to busy himself with adjusting the folds of a nearby tapestry. It had once been a favorite of Queen Maria’s: a forest scene, with a somber woman in blue and gold bent over a harp. And as it had barely been touched since the day that she died, it seemed an unlikely item to require Steve’s immediate attention.
"Oh, god. And Dr. Grant is going to be there, cause that asshole would never miss a chance to offer a colleague constructive criticism, I'm sure." Tony groaned and tipped face-down on his desk.
As if on cue, the elevator pinged, and Clint emerged. His gait was loose, but his eyes were sharp as they scanned his four teammates for signs of wear and tear. His gaze lingered for a moment on Natasha, who gave him a tight nod as he approached.
“I will make the tiny potatoes,” Thor offered magnanimously, rising from the recliner fast enough that it gave a creak of surprise. He looked by far the least battered of any of them, despite having taken a header from a load-bearing wall when the bomb had detonated. “They are an excellent vehicle for ketchup.”
“What are you saying exactly?” Tony asked, because the cold seemed to be making him sluggish, and it had been sixteen hours and twenty-three minutes since he’d last had coffee, so maybe the direct approach was best.
“Blame is assigned by the survivors, Stark,” Natasha said evenly. Her face darted into view at one end of her barricade, next to a box wrapped in “Hulk Smash!” paper. “And if we don’t get these ornaments contained before Bruce’s chocolate pecan pie has to come out of the oven, I can’t guarantee that anyone in this room will qualify.”
“You’ve got Rhodey on loan from the Air Force and weekly shipments of my tech,” he finally told her over the phone. “Those are my better halves anyway. Now when are you coming to the city? I picked up a vodka in St. Petersburg that’s going to make your graceful, murderous little toes curl.”
“Well, it wasn’t just what I read in your report,” Tony explained. “Pepper had told me she’d noticed something funny with some shipments over the past few months. I hadn’t paid it a lot of attention – it will shock you to discover that it has not always been easy for Pep to get me to focus on the details of business operations – but seeing the results sitting in front of me…I guess I needed one last, annoyingly chiseled kick in the ass, and you provided it.”
Steve looked over at Tony, and he had just enough time to watch the realization dawn in Tony’s eyes before he had to move.
“I know I’m a mess, Cap. It might look I’m not trying to stop it from hurting people, but I am. That’s why I’m down here.”
“Bet you could think of a few things to try,” Tony suggested, throwing his head back as Steve’s lips moved down his neck. “Not going to promise anything.”
"Alright." Grant watched Tony settle back in his seat and re-clip his seat belt, then he swung the door shut and walked back to his own car.
He finally looked Steve in the eyes, and Steve felt something in his stomach flutter at the softness in his gaze. He could feel the feather-light presence of Tony’s fingers next to his upper arm, the slight brush of Tony’s breath against his cheek. Could it be possible Steve hadn’t been the only one feeling the constant pull to close that distance? If he reached out now…
Decision made, Steve climbed the stairs to the second story, where Tony had been continuing his monologue.
“That is some pretty smug psychoanalyzing coming from you,” he said. “I’ve seen your military records, Rogers: multiple promotions, service with distinction, wounded during a high-profile rescue operation that pulled a dozen soldiers out of enemy hands. When you got discharged, you were getting recruited by West Point, Academi, Halliburton. You could have waltzed your way into a position at any private security firm in the country, and instead you ran straight toward the first job you could find that would allow you to take bullets professionally – the only career that would take your pathological need to be the first one in the line of fire and turn it into a job responsibility.”
Tony nodded faintly and let himself sag forward into Steve’s side, letting out a small sigh when Steve wrapped a gentle arm around his back. He supported most of Tony’s weight for the series of steps it took them to make it to the door, and once they made it to the porch, he scooped Tony the rest of the way into his arms. At another point in time, Tony might have found the energy to feel embarrassed about ending the night getting bridal carried out of a sorority party, but just at that moment all he could feel was the comfort of Steve’s shoulder pressed against his cheek.
“Deal the cards, Nat,” Tony said, taking care to wet the tips of his fingers with his tongue before he plucked his off the table.
Steve paused and then nodded. Tony gently took Steve’s chin in one hand to anchor himself and touched the ice pack to the largest clump of bruises, near Steve’s left temple. He tried to keep the pressure light, but Steve’s face remained drawn, his jaw flexing under Tony’s hand.
He had waited to corner Steve until they made it out of the press conference and into a quiet hallway. And watching the slope of Tony’s shoulders shift from indolent to exhausted the moment the two of them were alone, Steve was forced to adjust his assessment of Tony’s tendency to play bored in public.
But then the worst of Tony’s bad decisions — a blonde, abusive cheater of an ex-boyfriend named Tiberius Stone — had started dropping hints about Tony giving up his room on campus and moving downtown to live near the college’s wealthier set, and suddenly Steve had started looking like a safer option.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Tony snapped, tugging the sunglasses off his face so he could look Grant directly in the eyes. “I didn’t realize the college had hired you to provide expert training in academic advising. That seems like a lot of work on top of all your extracurricular volume policing – not to mention what appears to be a full-time position in the Department of Sisyphean Policy Battles. I hope they offered you a better life insurance policy than the rest of us if today’s little performance is any indication of how many time-consuming, untenable hills you’re planning to die on.”
“I’ve been wondering for a while,” Steve said. “Bruce almost Hulked out on me when I told him I led Nat into a booby-trapped HYDRA bunker. And I’m pretty sure I saw them holding hands when we dragged him onto that roller coaster.”
“If it makes you feel any better, Cap, the Malibu house is pretty easy to find anyway. I’m not one for subtlety, as you’ve been known to point out. In fact, you’d love the place – plenty of coastline where you could run yourself into the ground to take the edge off.”
Pull yourself together, Tony told himself firmly. You can make it through one party without ruining this.
“I know it’s me he’s after,” Tony said finally, “because he sent me a letter with a set of coordinates, a date and time, and a photograph of Barnes being watched through the scope of a rifle.”
"It's late! I didn't think you were coming. Plus I gave it to someone who really deserved it, I promise." She fluttered her eyelashes.
“Well, you’re not facing him alone,” Tony said finally, keeping his own voice even through herculean effort. “You want to get your face punched in some more by Soviet-edition Bourne Identity, fine, but you’re taking me with you.”
He gave a nod to Ward, who drew his gun and pointed it at Tony’s left leg. Steve fought the urge to lurch against the bindings again, knowing he needed to save his strength for the right moments, but he couldn’t stop himself from grinding out a curse.
“Et tu, Brute?” Tony mock-gasped, pressing one hand to his heart. “My will is being flouted at every turn.”
“We didn’t break up because of what happened in the fight, exactly,” Tony replied after a pause, a small, rueful smile tugging at his mouth, “but when I got Natasha’s message and flew to D.C. – I think that was when Pepper realized why I was having so much trouble walking away.”
Tony grit his teeth and tried to make it look like a smile. "Sure, why not? Put me down for two." He'd make Rhodey come with him If he was in town. It'd be payback for the time Rhodey had made Tony sit through an entire documentary on model-plane engineers.
“I don’t blame you, Tony. And I understand why you can’t stop blaming yourself. We just want to help take care of you when you can’t be careful with yourself.”
He glanced over to where Steve had emerged from the crowd and saw Steve searching his face carefully. No words came out, but Tony must have sent a signal with his eyes, because the next thing he knew, the pressure on his arm had disappeared, and his view of Ty was entirely blocked by the expanse of Steve’s back. Some free part of Tony’s brain wondered how Steve had managed to extricate Tony without so much as brushing against him, but then he heard Ty let out a strangled yelp as Steve twisted his arm into the air.
Steve’s jaw clenched, and for a moment it looked like he was going to refuse. Then he sighed, nodding slightly in resignation. Taking in a slow breath, he held his arms carefully away from his torso and allowed Tony to remove his belt and raise the hem of his tunic.
“ – only the first of many losses, if the files from Project TAHITI are not delivered to me,” a low voice was saying, and the visual suddenly shifted to a bearded man dressed in a robe, who was silhouetted against a dark background. “The Mandarin does not give warnings. He makes promises. Director Fury, you have one week.”
Steve’s cheeks flushed for the first time since they’d stepped off the quinjet into the tundra surrounding the HYDRA base, and Tony blinked in confusion. Steve was fidgeting too, chewing slightly at the bottom of his lip, but Tony couldn’t seem to connect the sudden shift in behavior to what Steve had said – because what had Steve said, exactly?
“Just bring the cartons,” Natasha suggested, not bothering to lift her head from where it was resting on Bruce’s shoulder. She’d taken a hard fall right before the Code Green, and Steve wasn’t sure Bruce even realized he’d been tracing fractal patterns across her arm ever since she’d flopped down next to him.
Tony was almost lost in the haze of kissing Steve Rogers – the half-desperation, half-relief inspired by the sharp pant of Steve’s breath against his lips – when he felt Steve wince. Tony pulled back immediately, and Steve chased after Tony’s retreating mouth with a noise of frustration.
It took three hours of pacing in his office, thirty minutes of leaving increasingly frantic voice mails for Bruce about the status of “Operation: Kill the Inappropriate Crush with Fire,” twenty minutes of scraping half an iceberg off his car, and then an additional hour of driving carefully in the wake of a snow plow before Tony made it home again. The wisest course of action at that point would probably have been to take a hot shower and go straight to bed. So, of course, twenty minutes later Tony had arranged all his research notes on the remaining floorspace of his study so that he could examine them all simultaneously while perching on top of his desk with a bag of rainbow Chips Ahoy and a reheated mug of coffee he hoped had been brewed within the last two days.
“Nat! This fucking idiot locked himself in, and the place is going to flood,” Tony explained rapidly. “Help me get the door open.”
“Steve Rogers,” Arnie replied in a matter-of-fact tone, and Tony tripped over his own feet on the way into the room.
He groped around him with his left hand, trying to keep the right pressed against the wound in his side, and he discovered a slick streak of blood and the edge of a step. The floor was already so wet that Steve could hardly believe he was still alive, but he must have dragged himself back to the staircase somehow before losing consciousness. And the trail seemed to continue down the steps ahead of him, which meant that maybe, through some even greater miracle, Tony had found his way out as well.
“Steve saw me talking with Ty. God, Pep! He probably thinks I get passed around more than a case of mono at a fraternity mixer — he breaks out the Jaw Clench of Judgment every time anyone even
He rubbed the hand not holding Tony’s across his eyes, and for the first time Tony noticed the faint tracks running down Steve’s cheek.
“Then quit micromanaging and concentrate on knitting that left ankle back together,” Tony said. “Don’t think I didn’t notice you favoring it.” He settled two larger logs into place around the pyramid of kindling, blew once on the first coals to encourage them, and then closed the door and opened the vents.
“Here’s a proposal: since I am not currently cursed with the knowledge required to operate your espresso machine, why don’t I go grab some coffees from the cafe across the quad? Maybe when I get back you can tell me how many hours of football you’ve secretly watched while pretending to think it was possible to end the game early by ‘shooting the moon.’’
Upon waking up, Tony became aware of three facts in the following order: (1) he was cold, (2) there was an IV line pulling at the skin of his left arm, and (3) Steve Rogers was hunched over his hospital bed looking absolutely awful.
He started to lean back, but Steve grabbed the hand Tony had circled around his wrist and held it in place.
Tony was walking back into the penthouse as he spoke, loosening his tie and rolling up the cuffs of his sleeves in what Steve now recognized as part of his post-office ritual. Talking, too, was integral to the process – the flow of words helping to unknot whatever strings held the public performance of Tony Stark together – and though Steve was sure Tony would have solicited participation from whoever happened to be around, he had started to look forward to those few minutes at the end of the day when Tony tried to draw him out.
Whatever the drug had been, it was still making him groggy as he woke up to the fist tangled in his hair. He could hear a muffled shout of protest coming from a few feet away, and he jerked instinctively toward the familiar voice before he felt something metal jammed into his nose.
And okay, it wasn’t like there hadn’t been signs. Rhodey had tried to warn him weeks ago. Pepper had called him out on it just yesterday, when they had gotten together to strategize about the upcoming board meeting.
It was as much of a surprise to Tony as anyone else, but he found he could accept help more easily from this weird team of people who were making a mess of his kitchen and using his ten-thousand-dollar dining table for beer pong than he could from the woman he had loved for years, who was already exhausting herself trying to take care of his chaotic professional habits without having to clean up his personal messes as well. He suspected that Pepper sensed this – that she had probably been the one to tell the Avengers about Tony’s episode in the first place. He knew they needed to talk about what it meant. But Tony hadn’t been brave enough to start that conversation when he knew too well how it was likely to end.
“I know how much you’ve invested in this project, Tony,” Bruce said gently, “but it’s just like the dissertation. At some point, you have to stop inventing new reasons that it’s not done and just call it. Eventually, it’s as good as it’s going to get.”
He hung up the phone. There would be time later to feel the fear about what state Tony would be in when Steve found him – right now he had to find him. He turned toward Natasha, who was standing in readiness, rotating a knife that had materialized in her hands.
“How easy this will be is entirely in your hands, Captain Rogers,” said a new voice, and a middle-aged man Steve didn’t recognize came into view. John Garrett, Steve supposed, as he took in the intense gaze and the wild grin playing around his lips.
Tony glanced back to the other side of the room again, scanning to see whether there was any chance of catching Steve and explaining how little interest he had in ever seeing Ty ever again. But the spot where Steve had been standing was empty, and Tony couldn’t catch sight of his tragically loose button-down anywhere else in the room either.
“No need to thank me, Romanov. I’m just the messenger,” he replied. “I’ll be in touch personally if we find anything else. Some members of my team were pretty shaken up by what happened in New Jersey, and I want to take care of these guys as soon as we can.”
He looked behind him as he bolted full speed for the north stair, fully expecting James to be right behind him, but he wasn't. James was also running, but not behind Tony,
Tony looked up from the electrical sensors he’d been pulverizing to see that Bruce had stopped pretending to work and was hovering nearby with a frown on his face.
Sitwell’s eyes had been widening gradually as Tony spoke, and he seemed momentarily frozen with indecision. Then the sounds of an explosion erupted from somewhere nearby, rattling the windows and creating what Sitwell must have thought was an opportunity. Sitwell’s free hand darted toward his hip, and Tony fired.
looked into Project TAHITI. You were the one who knew to search for the weapons on the helicarrier. I sensed something was wrong, but I wouldn’t have done anything about it if you hadn’t pushed me. I was just trying to get through the mission.”
