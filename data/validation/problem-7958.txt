It was all too easy to get his goat.
“Whatever you want. Even if it’s only this. It doesn’t have to be anything more than this, Steve.” Tony would whisper, as if he wasn’t offering to hand Steve the entire world on a platter. As if he wasn’t offering him
“What?” Tony runs a hand through his hair and down over his face. There’s exhaustion hollowed under his eyes and his shirt is crumpled.
“No,” Tony says, at the same time Steve starts with, “Not really sure how much there is to explain.”
This thing they have, it’s delicate. If Steve were to hazard a guess, hope is blooming in Tony’s chest the same way it is in his own, and he knows better than to crush something so precious.
. Steve pushed into him from behind as Bucky shifted back. He hasn’t knotted him because – because Steve. Of course, Steve. Tony blinked blearily, taking in the look of amazement and love on Bucky’s open face and he smiled.
“No pain.”
God, he had missed him.
“If you don’t get us up, we’ll both drown, JARVIS, you think I give a fuck about decompression sickness? Just get us to the surface and send out another SOS. Tell them where we are. I can get him there. I can do this, damn it.” Tony gritted his teeth, almost biting through the side of his cheek.
Steve has an insistent hand on his hip, tugging him closer until he’s taking on some of Tony’s weight and helping him shift over Steve’s hips to close him in. Hovering above him so they’re not fully touching, Tony savours the way it feels to be above him. Powerful. That’s what he needs. To be in control.
“Yes,” Steve gasped, forcing himself to switch hands and wrapping the Iron Man puppet around his screaming erection. It was the furthest thing from Tony’s mouth but when he did it like this, when he pumped his hips up into the fabric, it was almost like he was fucking into Tony’s warmth, driving inside him over and over again. “Tony, fuck, please. Please, Tony.”
He offers it to Steve with an age-old smile. Steve leans in and takes it, licking the tips of his fingers and watching Tony’s eyes go soft and wistful. It feels as if he’s floating, and Tony is the only thing keeping him pinned down. Without him, Steve could simply float away.
after all.
“I’m trying, Tony. I am.”
“I hate that you’re doing this to me.” Tony ran his hands down Bucky’s chest in reluctant appreciation. “How do you manage to still look so good in all my fuzzy shit?”
Tony takes two steps backward, safely back at Rhodey’s side as Bucky turns and strides out stiffer than a board. There, that wasn’t so bad.
“Don’t be jealous.” Tony purred, teasing him in a way that would have been impossible a few months ago.
He drags his heavy eyes up only to lose himself in Tony’s gaze. Steve drowns in him and as Tony leans forward and presses his lips to Steve’s forehead, warm breath wafts over his face and wraps around him like a blanket. He feels like less than dirt but Tony loves him anyway.
Steve’s eyes are blown black, but there’s something sad lingering around the corner of his mouth, a slight curve downward.
Steve feels himself colour, and he glances down before he meets Bucky head on. “Anytime now. We’ve… been waiting.” Bucky’s eyebrows shoot up and Steve huffs, nudging him with a shoulder. “Well, I couldn’t go off and get married without my best man, now could I?”
say.” Tony kisses him, and not long after, sparring on the mats turns into something else entirely.
Tony gags again.
Steve resists the urge to roll his eyes, inhaling sharply through his nose.
would stop the room from being too cold and too big, so Steve found himself curled in baggy sweatpants and hoodies that never quite kept out the chill as he tried to fill hours in a way that mattered. Every day was reduced to a battle for warmth and comfort.
“And you’re the expert on that, are you?” Steve asked.
“Tony—”
Tony feels hot and cold all over. “I—thank you.”
like he deserves better. It’s an axe hanging between the, waiting to sever the delicate threads of whatever this is and might become.
“There won’t be a neighborhood for him to get friendly with if aliens wipe out the planet,” Rhodey points out, because he’s rational and a realist that way.
Natasha made a soft, broken sound but said nothing, just pulled him back into her arms and held him for as long as she could. Even when his knees gave way and he fell to the ground, she went with him, holding him as he collapsed and sobbed Tony’s name over and over again against her shoulder.
Tony shrugs, giving Steve a look of ‘what can you do’ because there’s no clear answer as to why he doesn’t. Tony just… doesn’t hate Barnes. He can separate who he was with who he is.
Steve is more efficient than he once was, slicking up his fingers with lube from the bedside table—whoever had left it behind, Tony’s not sure— and tracing the seam of Tony’s ass before rubbing against his hole and pressing in. Tony groans and shoves back, taking Steve’s fingers into the second knuckle in a fierce shove that has Steve gripping his hips to hold him still.
He wriggles in Tony’s arms again but there’s nowhere to go. Between his legs, his cock throbs and he’s been hard enough to cut glass since this all started. There’s no escape from the heat of Tony’s hands, his body pinning him in place.
“You can’t force everyone to bend to your will, Steve.”
Tony’s breathing evens out, tempered and slow. If he hadn’t known better, Steve might’ve thought he was sleeping. Usually at this point Steve is waking up, rolling his sore shoulders and filing away another harsh, impossible fantasy so he can greet the day.
, and he wants Tony to know that it’s been him since the beginning.
In an effort to calm him, Steve tugged off his gloves and slid a soothing hand down Tony’s spine.
“Very well, Sir.”
Tony squeezes his eyes shut, everything in him revolting against the offer and the open love she’s laying down at his feet. “I don’t know what to do.”
“Just a bunch of pretty words then, huh Steve? That’s what it all was. Before?”
“Jesus fucking Christ.” Tony stumbles backward, ungraceful and a flurry of limbs as Steve reaches out a hand to steady him.
Tony’s face starts to shutter, and Steve gives him a pleading look.
Bucky dove in like it was his job, spread out flat on his stomach and parted Tony’s cheeks with his thumbs. He licked deep, spearing inside with a pointed, firm tongue until Tony was writhing and gasping, trying to thrust up against that sinful mouth. Steve kept him pinned down at the hip, the restraint sending a sear of pleasure curling low in his stomach.
Steve and Bucky wandered down to the workshop, entering both of their codes and coming up unsuccessful which was… unexpected. Steve had had access to all of Tony’s personal spaces since New York, save the first few weeks of their return, and Bucky had gained equal status not long after he’d come into the fold of their relationship.
Rhodey grunts and gives the ceiling an exasperated look, before pinning Tony with a harsh eye, “I’m just saying that it’s obvious you still love the guy, so maybe it’s worth a conversation before you call it quits. I’m not singing Rogers’ praises here, but I do want you—my friend, my brother—to be happy. And happiness has never come easily to you.”
be something there. “It’s been you since New York, you have to know that.”
The Accords Council passes the new Amendments, agreeing with immediate effect to all the necessary provisions that pardon and reinstate the Rogues. Barnes will serve no jail time and be permitted to join the Avengers pending a lengthy psychiatric evaluation process. There’s no joy on Barnes’ face when the agreement is signed and conferred into the Sokovia Accords and Tony finds himself wondering if maybe he's tired of all the fighting.
It’s unfair that she’s focusing on
“I called her the first time I got wasted,” Tony continues. “She was so disappointed, but it was hard to take her seriously in yesterday’s make up, her hair up in curlers on the top of her head. She even had her slippers on, pink, fluffy little things, looking so serious.”
Steve swallows, then grins up at him, watching the uncertainty melt away when Steve takes the proffered hand and lets Tony tug him to his feet.
“Then you can humour me.”
“Steve, stop!” Bucky gets in his path, hands on his shoulders holding him back.
Steve wants him to scream. “Tony. Tony?”
They part ways outside the diner and Tony meanders back to the hotel slowly. Their accommodations wouldn’t have been his first choice or even his second, but it’s comfortable enough despite the vivid green walls. The owners must have done something horrible to their interior designer.
“I can’t do this,” Steve whispers into the quiet. Tony keeps a firm hold over his hands in his lap. He will not touch him. He absolutely will not reach out and comfort Steve this time.
Steve chokes on a breath, fucking into Tony as hard as he dares and using the headboard for leverage. Sometimes, Steve’s terror of a soulmate likes to up the stakes like this, just for the sake of healthy competition, and Steve knows Tony is grinning because the explosion of red, white and blue fireworks at Tony’s left wrist are glowing, warm to the touch.
And Steve… Steve bursts into tears, collapsing in on himself until he’s folded in two, forehead pressed against Tony’s knuckles while giant sobs tremor like earthquakes through his body. His grief washes over them both as if Tony will be able to hold him in place through the typhoon. They’re both washed away, the tears slipping in silence down Tony’s own cheek as he squeezes those long, thick fingers over and over again.
He can feel Steve’s eyes on him and listens to his soft, even breaths. Steve is probably going to defend himself and tell Tony every reason that letter was necessary. That maybe he still feels the same way, but he can understand why Tony
Steve whispers the words back to him, and no one else exists. There’s only Tony, looking up at him like Steve’s the only person in the universe. When Tony looks at him, he can almost believe it.
“Tony–”
DUM-E whirrs again, insistent.
What should he even care about Steve’s comings and goings? He doesn’t, he tells himself, not really.
Steve isn’t coming home, not really.
Not what he was expecting, but actually, not a horrible idea either.
“Yeah, JARVIS?” Steve croaks, tears falling in quiet, even rivers down his face.
Steve considered it. “No, that’s still new.”
“What are we doing?” Steve’s breath is hot against his lips when he tears his mouth away.
“That wasn’t bad, Buckaroo.” Tony was cheeky and when his brain came back online, any minute now, he was going to do something about that. Definitely
“Can you just do this for me? God—stop looking at me like I’m about to go rogue. I’m not going to hunt him down; I’m not going to kill him or something asinine like that. But I can’t do anything with all—” Tony gestures wildly at himself. “
The thought had flabbergasted Steve at first, who had, of course, considered it once or twice. Who would have blamed him? He was only a man, and a man with a clearly well-defined type at that, but he’d never allowed it to go very far. He had Tony now.
“No. We can’t.” The words are out of Steve’s mouth too soon, and Tony’s head whips around to stare at him, surprised.
He needs to be able to help. He needs to do
“And you were such an ass.” Steve rolled onto his side and pressed Tony into the mattress to run a hand through his hair. He kissed the sleep from his mouth, watching him stretch luxuriously like a cat reaching into wakefulness.
“Your bots stealing our stuff or something, Tones?” He joked, but Steve could have sworn that Tony’s face had flickered blankly right before he rolled his eyes and laughed.
him and that’s honestly even worse, Rogers. Or maybe it’s the part where Earth is about to be decimated, hmm? That must be it, because I know you can’t be talking about how the entire globe is prepared to ignore all the shit you and your pals pulled off this past year is what’s
Pepper turning up out of the blue when he’s just finished vomiting his guts up is enough to put an end to his three-week bender. The last bout of heaving isn’t from the alcohol, but from shame. It’s infinitely fouler and he’d take drying out again a hundred times over if it saves him any more of
“The caveman gig is surprisingly sexy. I dig it.” Tony laughs, kissing Steve and licking into his mouth for a brief moment before he pulls back. “When do you need to go?”
Pepper still calls, even after he’d snapped at her, and it’s a blessing when she does. The calls are shorter now and come at increasingly unpredictable intervals as the weeks pass. There’s more shop talk than they’ve had in years, but at least he knows that Stark Industries remains in capable hands while he tries to figure out what comes next.
“Never seen anything like you, Steve.” Tony’s hands are on his hips, roughly pulling him forward then guiding him back. “Never thought you’d—
. Right now, Steve is waiting and unable to do a damned thing.
me when I was unconscious.
“Yes,” Steve says as Tony pauses halfway down the stairs, giving him a startled look. Then he smiles, helplessly shaking his head.
In his rage, Tony was not a rational man and Steve didn’t blame him for attacking Bucky. Hell, he didn’t blame him for the fiasco with the Accords, either. It was a difference of opinion Tony was entitled to, and Steve knew that Tony had been struggling since Ultron; Tony’s judgement had been impaired.
Tony had always been perfect like this. Asleep, when he was peaceful and vulnerable, and Steve had cherished every moment of their time together. Seeing him so close now left Steve aching, the tips of his fingers tingling with the urge to reach out and stroke a hand over all that soft, scarred skin.
“Not really,” Steve admits, sheepish.
The same hands that he’d used to fight Tony off in Siberia.
Rhodey pauses. “I don’t think they know what happened between you, man.” Tony doesn’t bother to fill the space so he cuts to the point. “You’re still in love with him.”
Tony readjusts in the bed, fiddling with the edge of the strap to the harness that keeps his destroyed arm close to his belly. “They’re releasing me tomorrow.” He forces himself to meet Steve’s eye. “Okay. Yeah, okay.”
“Let’s get you home.” Pepper settles a hand on his arm and shepherds him off the airstrip.
Tony freezes up, glaring at the nearest camera to express his displeasure. “There’s a
Rhodes becomes Jim, and though he never quite respects Steve’s rank, they get on well enough. They trade war stories, and Steve marvels at how little has really changed after all. He doesn’t visit often; the military is stretched to its limits between emergency relief and rebuilding, but Tony relaxes when he does.
Sometimes there was no need for talking at all. Steve would let himself luxuriate in the feeling of Tony in his arms, trading a lifetime’s worth of lazy kisses, long overdue.
The puppet just sat there, teasing him.
A single finger draws a light line from the dip of his lower back, halfway up his spine and back down again. Over and over, soothing and calm.
“Tones—”
“You are not fine.” The anger in Tony’s voice tremors just beneath the calm. “You are absolutely not fine. Are you in pain? Be honest, because they can push more pain meds if you—”
“Damn it!” Tony shouts, slamming his hand down on the countertop. “Stop talking to me in that fucking voice. I’m trying to have a conversation with Steve Rogers. You’ve met him, right? Is he in there, Cap?” The words are barbed and meant to sting.
“Tony? Tony! Honey, can you hear me?”
“Steve,” Tony says, voice a gentle brush over Steve’s raw nerves. “It’s okay. I promise, it’s alright.”
“I love you,” Steve says, and Tony sets all his doubts aside.
When Steve had worked three fingers inside him, Tony’s body started to shift restlessly beneath him, signalling he was ready for more. Steve slicked himself up and pressed between his cheeks, holding off taking him as he savoured the slippery glide that left sparks of pleasure shooting up his spine.
“Believe it, baby. You ready?”
When Tony finally touches down on the platform that juts out from his Malibu mansion, Steve’s legs feel like putty, and he leans against the suit, an arm still slung around Tony’s metal neck.
, twisting and tugging at the little strands to hold Steve’s focus and guide his face wherever Tony might need it. How is it that he can feel that if Tony is lying in a morgue somewhere? Wherever they’ve taken him.
The unthinkable happens, and in the mere seconds between Tony realizing what has to be done and snapping his fingers, he thinks about the moment that he proposed. It seems like a fitting last memory if he has to choose one.
Three months had passed since the Battle for Earth and each new day felt increasingly bleak and dreary. The Avengers were recovering, each in their own way, alongside the rest of the world and Steve remembered the words he had spoken so many times before in his support group.
“Talk to me, Steve, tell me what you’re feeling.” Tony bites down on his shoulder before he turns his head and presses his nose into the curve of Steve’s neck.
Steve sighs. “It always ends eventually, Tony.”
It gave him something to focus on when there was something wrong with his Omega.
; here physically, but Steve can’t be sure that the Bucky Barnes he knew will ever return completely.
“Come on, Stevie, this is too fucking good.”
“Wow,” Tony says with a teasing air. “Your best guy, huh? Tell me I’m your fella next, Rogers. Really put the accent into it, too.”
He does the deep breathing and thinks the happy thoughts, but it doesn’t make a dent in the weight that sits on his chest and crushes him all over again. It doesn’t fade until he’s walking through the doors to SI and Pepper’s calming face is greeting him, not asking any questions, just being a calm, soothing, warm body next to his own.
“Or how you asked him whether or not you should look at his eye, or his eyepatch.” Clint teases.
Could it have been possible that Steve knew Barnes was out there? He’s been in pursuit of the Winter Soldier for weeks now, and for Barnes to show up here, to watch them—Tony shoves the thought aside, checking off all the mental boxes for neuroses and low self-esteem.
, Tony’s heart beats for Steve and he should have known.
“What’s that?”
Steve shakes his head and doesn’t stop shaking it. He can see their wedding rings, shining bright against Tony’s olive skin. He remembers the shine in Tony’s eyes the day he married him and the disbelief before the awe set in on the afternoon Morgan was born.
Peter offered up a set of three personalized fire extinguishers that had everyone in stitches. They were a mixture of shapes and sizes, all bright patterns and fully up to code for DUM-E to have a selection to choose from the next time Tony was closed to lighting something, or himself, on fire.
“He’ll go if I tell ‘im to take a hike.” Bucky said though he could already see the distress and protest in the look Steve was giving him. “We’re not together, Stark. You don’t have anything to worry about. That ended a long time ago and I’m not lookin’ for anything. Not expectin’ anything.”
“You want to hear a secret, Cap?” Tony bears him down into the cushions, bending him at an angle that forces his ass into the air, spine arching to accommodate the intrusion as a second finger joins the first. Tony licks a hot stripe up Steve’s neck and bites down hard on his earlobe. “I don’t think you recognize yourself anymore and that terrifies you.”
Guilt cloyed after that, a constant nuisance.
Tony leans back against the couch and runs a hand through his hair, ignoring the accusation and going in for the kill. “Prove me wrong. Sit down. Listen to me. I would love nothing more than for you to prove me wrong at least once. Or do you want to stand over there, glowering, ready to put your first through the wall or talk over me when you’re tired of listening to what I have to say? It’s not going to make a difference to me, Steve. Like you said. I already ‘walked away.’ There’s nothing stopping me from going right now.”
Tony shrugs, looking down at his hands and picking a bit of dirt out from underneath one of his nails. “Just something you said earlier. That I was
He can see it in his face, feel it in his words. It doesn’t feel good, far from it, because he’s spent months expecting to hear Steve justify and excuse, find ways to blame Tony instead. But it’s better this way in the end, even if the truth isn’t as satisfying as the fight. Even if he wants to See Steve hurt the way he’s hurt, just to feel some sense of justice.
“Just ask me.” Steve props himself up on one arm, watching uncertainty slash across Tony’s face. “Tony, what?”
Across the room, Steve is standing with his back to Tony, talking in soft tones with Natasha. The stage is lit up and the rest of the Avengers are milling about with a nervous energy that sets Tony on edge. His speech tumbles around in his mind and for a second, he wishes that he’d never agreed to come.
“Just you, always you, Steve.”
And finally, the reality seems to settle over Tony too. Grief spills out of him, red and desolate. They’ve been bleeding all over each other for weeks.
The glow hasn’t quite started to fade when Tony turns his face away. “You should go.”
“Bucky’s fine, kid. And I guess?”
“Tony get off.”
Steve kisses him, laughing when Tony keeps up a steady stream of words against his lips. Maybe their friendship has a few perks in it for Steve after all.
“Steve?”
He sputtered and choked but he was breathing. Breathing!
That he’s letting Tony go.
Somewhere after serving the papers the anger had deflated and made way for loneliness, rejection, and hurt to creep back in. The little question of doubt,
“Hey Tony?”
That seems to surprise Steve. “You’re been seeing a therapist?”
Steve laughed, wet and short, trying to picture her pouring a young, drunken Tony into her car, stern even in disarray. “I didn’t know.”
“Just—shut up for a minute. Everyone always says that he straightened you out. That he’s somehow responsible for the goodness in you, but that’s been there all along. I know you think he makes you a better man, but you’re wrong. You make
The sobs come at double-time, taking over until there’s no air left in his lungs. The grief feels like a downpour.
“What’s up, J?”
Tony tilts his head and gives him a calculating look. It would be reasonable for Tony to be angry or resentful, and Steve steadies himself for whatever comes next. There had been so many times back in the early days he spent with Peggy, enjoying a peaceful evening in their perfect little house, when he’d hear Tony in his head.
It doesn’t even feel real. That they’re here, that the space woman with flaming hair has found them in time and brought them back. It’s a miracle he doesn’t even deserve.
“Right.” Steve’s voice is small and tight.
It’s the first time that he’s heard Barnes speak since the bunker. His voice is different now; it’s soft, unassuming, and laced with a little hint of Brooklyn that Steve only ever lapsed into if he was angry enough.
The arm plates are popped back in, and the dinner plates are distributed across the table. Everyone settles in and starts to eat, but Steve is still absent. Tony’s noticed that he’s been absent a lot the past few days, since their run in in the hallway.
“Yeah. Me too.”
Steve sucks them down, lapping at Tony’s fingerprints.
, even a crack, Tony would have thrown it open wide. Probably wouldn’t have been able to help himself.
There’s nowhere to go because this is exactly where Steve is supposed to be. He’s already home.
“I’ve got you. You feel so good—couldn’t stop if I wanted to. Never going to stop.” Tony drives back into him, slamming against his hips until everything narrows to the rough glide of Tony’s cock against his prostate and the way his fist flies over Steve’s cock, twisting under the head until stars dance at the edge of his vision.
Eventually, when the food gets cold and the chatter starts to die off, Tony pushes away the nagging thought that Steve might return after all.
“I told her, too.” Tony whispers. “She told me not to ever let you go.”
Be brave, Stark, but not desperate. “Maybe… maybe it could, though. I mean, if we wanted it to.”
Rhodey’s phone goes off and draws Tony back.
Every moment that Tony’s ever whispered in Steve’s ear,
Steve flinches away from him and regrets it almost immediately when Tony’s face crumbles. He scoots a bit closer in the chair next to the bed before he gets a hand on the mattress, inches it towards Steve’s. Just a light clasp of fingers, as if Tony thinks he could hurt him if he holds on too tightly.
A rush of anger floods him and Steve fists his hands in Tony’s t-shirt, tugging him forward almost violently, trying to dig his way inside Tony’s body and never leave. He presses them together as best he can until Tony finally gets with the program and throws a leg over Steve’s hips to straddle his thighs but Tony holds back. His hands slide into Steve’s hair but don’t pull, he just tilts Steve’s head back and kisses him like he really means it, slipping his tongue gently into Steve’s mouth and licking along his lower lip.
“He’s acting weird, too.”
Steve tries so many times that Tony hears–
“Steve’s training ended earlier, and he wanted a day at the beach,” Tony says, waving them off with nonchalance.
Tony held Steve’s wrist in a tight grip with the gauntlet, the other hand stretched out behind him, keeping them alight and he had nothing to fight Steve off with, nothing he could use to stop him. He could only watch, with abject horror, when Steve reached up and squeezed the fingers of the gauntlet with his own, looking into the Iron Man faceplate with a bittersweet smile.
Peter laughed good-naturedly and pointed his fork towards Tony, jumping into a razzing contest about all the merch that Tony had held onto when the Spider-Man and Winter Soldier lines had gone live in the fall, joining his collection of Captain America specialties.
Yet Bucky holds back now, his only tell in the harsh grip he keeps on Steve’s arm. His fingers bite into Steve’s flesh but the hurt feels grounding. It forces Steve to acknowledge that this is real. Even when he looks away, Bucky is still there in front of him.
A grin spread across Tony’s face. “Yep, that’s what I’m saying. At least try it before you say no. Just imagine it, Steve.” Tony slid across the mattress towards him, resting his hand on one of Steve’s thighs as he leaned in and pressed his mouth to the soft spot below Steve’s ear. “Think about it. You can have me. Do whatever you want to me. Help me.”
Steve’s never been good at any of this. Sam and Bucky follow after him, asking why he hasn’t done more to get them back. They never leave.
When he looks back, minutes or hours later, Steve is gone.
“Tony, I love you.”
Steve suddenly lurches off-balance when Tony tugs him down for a kiss, vibrating with an eager energy that’s infectious. Then Tony pulls back and gives Peggy a lascivious smile that makes Steve’s cheeks heat. “Want to compare notes, Pegs?”
Tony is showing him video clips of a spider kid, swinging across the New York skyline in a breathtaking arch. Steve’s stomach flips over as the kid does a flip from one building to the next, landing effortlessly on his feet with a grace that can’t be human.
Steve’s grip on his jaw tightens almost painfully as he jerks Tony’s face up.
Tony folds his arms over his chest and gets a visceral memory of the two of them, in exactly this position, three months prior. Except this time, when he glances down at Steve’s hand something aches inside him because Steve has finally retired his wedding band. For the briefest moment Tony thinks maybe it’s around his throat—but no, there’s no chain.
Tony’s fear too intense to pass off as anything else, as Tony fell to his knees gasping and Bucky stumbled backwards.
“I can see that you’re hurting. You may be surprised to see what you find if you change your mind about talking to him.”
Rhodey felt like the appropriate choice to bridge that gap, and had accepted the honour. Though Tony would argue calling it an honour as Rhodey still struggles through his physiotherapy is a sick joke, even for the Avengers.
!” He snapped his fingers, smiling. “Smarter than I thought an art education major would be.”
"Do you have to bring this up now?" Steve let out a sigh. "I'm already cautious about it. He's not even gay."
The man looked up immediately from his clipboard, red covering his cheeks. His shaking only seemed to worsen. "Oh, I apologize Mr. Stark. Go right in."
Tony put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. "Don't worry about it, kid. It's all good."
Tony flipped open the mirror that was attached to the car ceiling, putting locks of his hair here and there to fix it. Steve did the same, realizing that somehow the wind had made his look a lot better than he had tried to make it look.
“Are you trying to… blackmail me?” He knew that somehow, he should’ve been expecting this. Should’ve been expecting Obadiah to do
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sure, keep saying that, you'll see."
"And the handsiness. The hand on my hip." Steve shrugged carelessly. "He seemed to be okay with me for the most part, so that's a win, right? Your dad likes me."
Tony shows up to sit front row at one of Steve's football games.
"I... fine," Steve sighed as he gave in to it.
“Oh, I definitely am,” Obadiah corrected. “All I have to do is pull some strings and you’re off the football team and out of school.”
"I don't have your number, Stark."
A nervous Steve tells Bucky about Tony's deal, and ultimately decides to show up for help in his classes. Needless to say, Tony is late, and Steve is a bit annoyed. Some words are exchanged between the two. (Also known as: Tony and Steve are oblivious to the fact that they both like each other.)
He directed his attention to the waiter. "No thank you," he told them with a curt nod. They walked off without another word. "I don't drink, Mr. Stark," Steve explained to him.
"Did you or did you
Do you know that you're popular? I'm being serious here.
College football was not a thing that Steve enjoyed. He would rather spend his time and focus on his art education degree, not on lifting weights and trying to make it into the NFL. But, he was never as naturally good in academic subjects that other students around him excelled in. Mid-high school, Steve tried out for the football team to make up for it. Senior year, when the college football scouts started to come in to pick boys out, Steve was chosen. They offered him a full ride scholarship just to have him play on the team and attend. He couldn't just say no to the gracious offer.
, it's because you're the exact opposite and he, too, isn't able to defy your charms."
The blond stayed silent, looking at the man in confusion.
To tell the truth, it didn't represent anything in particular. Perhaps it was his feelings painted out onto a canvas, but he wasn't even sure of how to explain that. His feelings were confusing lately, all jumbled up into one big mess that he couldn't unravel.
Steve for the last two days had opted out of football practice. He had been in his dorm, catching up on the work that he hadn't yet finished for his classes. His grades were gradually going down because of these missing assignments. But of course Coach Fury would think this was due to arrogance. The nights were long, not to mention that the coffee maker in his small kitchen was broken. (He and Bucky had tried to fix it. Many times. It seemed as if now they would only have to buy a new one. Another valuable fifteen dollars down the drain for something that would probably break again.)
“And you don’t like me,” the blond finished off for him.
(See the end of the chapter for
, no--"

"For now. I will be expecting to see you on time in the library on Friday."
I'm getting you a new one. What color tie?
“Nice, right?”
"The fact that there's a recognizable one..." Bucky trailed off, letting out a sigh.
"That's fine with me," he finally said. "Be careful, okay?"
How did you get my number anyway? I don't give it to many people.
"Its a perfectly enjoyable movie," Bucky responded, smacking Sam on the arm. "And don't talk with your mouth full, it's disgusting. Right, Steve?"
"He brought a car of his own in, asking specifically for me to fix it. But the car was a piece of shit, it couldn't even be fixed. He stood there for hours while I tried to figure out what the hell was wrong with it. It took all night only for me to fail. He told my employer that I was a bad mechanic, that I needed to be fired immediately. And though he appreciated my work and how much I had helped the shop, he had to fire me. My father did that to embarrass me, to teach me some sort of fucked up lesson. All I learned that night was how to be more secretive around him and my mother."
Like the night before, there was only one thought on his mind:
"This movie sucks," Sam complained, stuffing pasta into his mouth. "How could anyone enjoy this?"
Coach Fury's office.
“Mr. Rogers!” A man called out from across the room, approaching the blond. Howard had probably mentioned Steve to Obadiah already, there was no need to be paranoid.
"Talk to me. Say something. Anything. Tell me about yourself."
Bucky only laughed at him, before lifting up the covers and laying down in his bed once again. "You're a punk."
Tony, I play offense.
"Besides me being a genius?" Steve scoffed, Tony continued anyways, "
“Yeah, of course.”
"Do you want to... dance?" Steve rubbed the back of his neck, his face flushing. "Do you-- would you like to... Tony Stark, would you want to--"
listen to you groan all night."
"Did you agree? I mean, he
My writing seems sloppy in this so expect some updates soon!
"You're talented at painting, you know."
"Oh. Well, thanks for the compliment, I guess. My art... it's kind of messy. I'm glad you like it." Steve rubbed the back of the neck with his hand, looking down at the floor. He looked like a mess. His blond hair was probably everywhere, paint stains on his clothing and his hands. Most likely his face too. His art wasn't that good, either. He wouldn't have cared if it was anyone else seeing him like this, or even saw his art. So why did he care about it around Tony?
"Yeah, easy, let's go."
“I’m expecting you to do what's best for Tony. I see how you look at him. I know you care for him. And Tony deserves someone who does. But not you. He needs someone who is adapted to this. He needs someone… what's the word?”
"Can... can I roll the window down?" Despite the heat outside, he just wanted to feel the wind on his face. Tony only responded to that with a nod of his head.
Did you catch her name, by chance?
"But I don't want to. Let me hear it from you and you only."
I was asking for your number, not her name.
"Do you know why I called you in here?" Coach asked, raising an eyebrow.
“I have to tell him?”
Every time they talked, there was always the silence that occurred between both of them. Both of them had acknowledged it, but couldn't begin to explain it. It stayed like that for a minute, before Tony decided to speak up.
He lifted his head up from the car seat, narrowing his eyes at the blond. "I must say I'm surprised. But fine, I'll tell you something anyway." He looked out the window. "I never had to have a job like you when I was younger. My father had enough money to support the family for the rest of our lives. But, some part of me just wanted to be normal, you know? So I went out and got a job myself, never told my employer my real name and always wore a beanie over my hair. I worked in an auto shop, fixing people's cars in my free time. My father noticed how busy I had suddenly become and decided that he would follow me out one day to where I worked."
The picture showed Coach Fury and his two adopted daughters, Maria and Carol. The three of them stood smiling, arms wrapped around each other at a fair. In his hands, Fury was holding a teddy bear that he had won from one of the many game booths. A smile adorned his features, making the man look seemingly younger. Fury was always happier when the two girls came around for the holidays, the workouts easier on the tea, and his mood always brightened. The team loved it when they came around.
Having a position on the football team practically meant everything. No football team, no tuition payment.
Oh, crap.
the blond responded in a whisper. "Look, it's not that big of a deal. Tony will probably ditch me halfway through anyway, you know how it is with people like him. Obsess about it all you want, but I'm going to bed."
Tony left, walking away with Jarvis at his side. Which only left Steve alone in a mostly crowded room, filled with mindless chatter. He grabbed a water from a table nearby, chugging it down.
!" Steve interrupted the brunet. Tonight there would be no physical confrontations between Tony and his father, he would make sure of that. "What are you-- no, don't worry about me. This is all just very... new. These people say cutting remarks between straight, white teeth. I honestly have no idea how anyone could deal with them alone as long as you have."
practice," the older man added, shaking his head in disappointment. "What is going on with you lately, Rogers? This team needs you, you know this team needs you. But what do I get? Another cocky college boy blowing off his chances just like
“An arrogant, idealistic, football player firmly set in the liberal agenda? Gotta admit it, kid, I don’t think we can coexist with the Starks,” Obadiah explained, concealing his hate with a fake face of innocence.
“Yes, you
“Mhm, nice,” the brown hair boy agreed, laying his head down on the surface closest to him. Bucky closed his eyes, about to fall asleep. Again.
Steve waited awkwardly for Tony to arrive, standing on the sidewalk right outside of his dormitory. He was fumbling with his hands, picking at his nails carelessly. The heat from the outdoors was beginning to make him sweat, and the bugs were beginning to try and bite at his neck. Steve swatted them away. He had decided to be early, too, which ended up being a big mistake. People who passed by gave him second looks, which only meant one thing: he was entirely out of place. His hair was done up and was wearing a suit with the nicest shoes he owned. In the bathroom mirror, the blond had thought he looked somewhat decent. But now in public, his low self-esteem was really beginning to shine.
Some cheerleader. Brunette, brown eyes.
"What's so funny?" The brunet raised one eyebrow at him. "Do I have something on my face?"
Sam and Bucky sat smushed together on the couch, while Steve -- who didn't want to be the third wheel -- had offered to sit on the floor while they watched Netflix. Steve would've complained about the floor being dirty and the end of the couch hurting his back, but the food Sam had brought had erased those thoughts from his mind.
agree?" He persisted. "I would've said yes in a heartbeat, honestly. Imagine it, Stevie. You get to go on a
A waiter approached the two. "Drinks?"
Steve looked over at Tony with a frown. "Your parents treated you that way? Why?" Steve's eyes widened. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked that. You don't have to answer if you don't want to."
"Stark, why would I want a rich, egotistical playboy to help me with my homework?" Steve asked. Tony's eyes widened in surprise, before covering up his facial expressions with a stupid smirk. Steve wanted to slap it off his face.
I'll buy a ticket. Front row.
Tony be like: Let me call this boy handsome but then NOT ask him out. Yes. Perfect. (Bisexual awakening?)
." Steve had sworn he saw a red on his face, but Tony looked away before he could make sure of it. "Thanks. I think."
"I used to babysit my neighbor's cat when I was a kid," Steve began. "That cat hated my guts. It would scratch up my arms if I didn't feed it on time, and if it was disinterested in its toys it would try and destroy furniture around the house. Eventually, the neighbor was like,  Steve, we love you, but you can't do this anymore for us.  I got fired without even being told that I was being fired. My mother wasn't even mad at me for it. Later that week I had found a job for the local newspaper, except all I did was ride my bike around and throw it into people's yards. I got fired from that, too."
Fury was quick to interrupt him. "I saw your email. Don't try and forget about your attendance to
“What is it?” The smaller boy questioned him, looking up into the blonds eyes with furrowed eyebrows.
"He... does. He didn't used to. But now..."
me to be gone then your wish is my command." Steve held back a laugh and grabbed a towel from the rack in their bathroom. Even from there, he could hear Bucky choke on his own spit. "But it depends on what time he will be coming over. I shouldn't be gone later than nine or so."
"It's nice to meet you, Steve," Pepper told him.
Why don't we both wear pink ties? Create a little bit of gossip.
Steve fumbled around in his pocket, his fingers finally touching a crumpled up note. He retrieved it and flattened it out with his thumbs. Tony's number was indeed on the slip of paper. "Wow. Okay. I'll give you credit for that one."
He furrowed his eyebrows. "Unlike you, Stark," he pointed his finger at Tony, "I can't pay my way through college--"
"Tony, has anyone told you that you have a tendency to only hear the bad things?" Steve questioned, raising an eyebrow.
"Tony," he murmured back.
Bucky’s terrible sleep schedule. His roommate was up during the day just for enough time to attend his classes, but as soon as he got back to their dorm -- he was out like a light. It only resulted in the brown haired boy staying up at night, repeating the same process from the day before.
If you make a touchdown, make sure to come over and give me a kiss.
So, in short, yes. Steve knew better than anything why Coach had called him into his office. The blond lowered his head, embarrassed. "My grades, sir. I emailed you--"
Tony led Steve away, but he could still feel Howard's eyes burning holes into his back from afar. Steve had the urging suspicion that maybe Howard didn't even like him at all.
"It's Tony." Steve looked down at his phone, the screen telling him that it was already five-fifty. "I have to go, I'll see you and Sam later tonight."
"Check your pocket."
"Do you have to attend every single one of these events?" Steve asked, his eyes wandering around. It was mostly old men and women who gathered around the entrance, the occasional young woman or man here and there. They all wore their fanciest outfits, with their posture perfect and steps that almost seemed fake. Steve pulled his shoulders back immediately.
Steve knew that he couldn’t trust his own conscience at times. He didn’t even have any regard for his own safety. But he had a sudden suspicion, that hey, maybe he should tell Tony now. In the middle of all this. Better now than later, right?
“See, it kinda does. Maria was a smart choice for Howard -- good family, good looking, knew how all of this worked, and already had connections. Plus, I like her.”
I'll meet you after the game to give it to you.
"Steve," Mrs. Carter said in amazement from behind him, a smile coming upon her red-tinted lips, "That's absolutely beautiful."
"It was nice to meet you, also, Pepper," Steve smiled. "Always nice to meet new people."
"The problem is that... is that he's a Stark."
It doesn't matter to me if you don't play.
Curious eyes from all directions followed the two, and Steve noticed. But did Tony?
"That expression! It's your Steve is being stubborn for no reason face." Steve saw that face coming from Bucky almost always.
I'm kidding. I paid someone ten bucks for it.
Bucky and Sam were all he needed as far as friends went. Dating wasn't something he wanted to get into.
"Yes?"
"Tony! Finall-- I mean, yes, please, excuse us."
“I-- okay, okay. Steve, I’ll be right back. Obie will be here in a second, then we’ll go back to your place.” Tony started to walk off, looking seemingly upset.
"You really are more than just a pretty face, huh, Rogers?"
"Bad?" Steve jested.
Tony, ever since they had first met each other in that hallway, had always had Steve’s eye. Always in his thoughts, in his words.
"So... a date."
"Wait. It's your turn to tell me about you."
"Right back at you."
"What is it, Steve?" Bucky questioned, pushing Sam away from him. "Sam! I swear to god-- stop! -- Sam! The pasta is
"Name?" A man at the front door asked them. He held a clipboard so tightly in one of his shaking hands that his knuckles were white. On the other hand, he held a blue fountain pen, with a feather at the top that was nearly falling apart.
Steve nodded, gulping rather loudly. Howard grinned at that. "Sounds good with me."
Balancing a sport and classes was not easy, but the blond knew that Coach wouldn't take that as an excuse. In a hurry. Steve had emailed him about it. It explained his current situation, and how he would make up for it later. But in came the one sentenced response:
Tony had mentioned Obadiah Stane on the ride here. He was one of his father’s old friends, who had helped with Stark Industries on its rise to fame. Steve had heard Howard talk about Obadiah before, but at the time he just didn’t know the man’s name. Was that the man that Howard was so intent on meeting Steve?
The more that Steve looked at it, Tony was helping in more ways than he had originally thought. With his grades now on the rise up, Coach Fury was impressed with him. Teachers had suddenly become more lenient on letting Steve turn in work just a tad bit late. His anxiety and stress about the situation was practically gone now, and all of this was thanks to Tony.
But the blond did agree with his friend. He probably did smell horrible -- which he was nose blind to at this point -- and his skin felt sticky and gross. Without another word he went into the bathroom and turned the shower on. Steve closed the door and began to take all his clothes off.
Having that quickly swept under the rug, they had hitched a short ride in Tony's truck, an old model flatbed pickup truck of all things (though of course  not without some of Tony's usual flair for style), before finally arriving back at the tower. Steve and Nat had watched as Tony  wordlessly stared up at the tower with an unreadable expression. His movements as he approached the tower were slow, hesitant,  like a man trapped in a waking dream. Maybe he was still struggling to believe it was more than just a dream.
Steve wasn't called a master tactician for nothing though, and could be quite persuasive when the situation demanded.
Startled by the sudden noise, Tony flinched, causing the razor to jerk erratically in his grip and carve a harsh path across his face. Tony jerked back with a curse, and muttering under his breath,  slammed the razor on the counter before turning to glare at Steve. Already, a small trickle of blood was flowing freely from the cut.
"I see." Steve commented simply. He didn't. But by now he figured it was prolly for the  best to leave all his unanswered questions as is. The woman waited a few more seconds before continuing in a breezy tone.
Not real, just a dream.
"Really? What about that stunt you pulled back at the pyramid?."
And hope, fragile thing that it was ,  was all he had left.
-----------------
Though his thoughts drifted with dreamlike irregularity, the one one cold hard  truth was that acceptance equalled defeat.
"Tested?" Steve interrupted, looking up from the papers with raised brow.
"You didn't answer when I knocked."  Steve defended stubbornly.
The Beyonder was formidable no doubt, perhaps their strongest foe yet, but together..together Steve felt they would prevail. And as he felt himself also start to drift off, he was certain that for the first time in months,  there'd be no nightmares.
"Oh how nice.  So you'll be wanting one of our pleasurable models I assume" Janice commented, while simultaneously  scribbling notes on paper," what sort of options are you looking for?"
Only Tony had gone where he hadn't been able to follow, and Steve had never felt less worthy of the Captain America mantle.
Steve gave a small fond, shake of his head. Same old Tony. " Glad to have you back Tony."
" That's why he is.."
After a long hot shower, Steve found himself staring blankly at the dinghy mirror which adorned his private  bathroom. It was not exactly a pleasant visage. His reflection stared  back at him with hollow eyes that spoke to several nights without adequate sleep and a certain aura of world weariness that he'd never noticed before.  He was coming undone at the seams, and  looked like he had seen hell and kept going  back for more. Unbidden, a small smirk flitted briefly across his face, as he tried to imagine  what Tony would say if he could see him now.
"Rough week ?"
Steve wandered aimlessly around the room while Tony showered. It was the first time Steve had been in their shared room since Tony had been trapped in that no tech dimension. The thought of sleeping alone in an empty room which had once held so many happy memories, had always seemed wrong to him. Too painful. With the reminder of Tony's absence shoved in his face from every direction.
Putting the photo back, Steve went and sat down on the edge of the bed once more as he waited. And waited. Time dragged on slowly..forty-five minutes, an hour..hour and half. And though the rational part of his mind was telling him not to overreact, Steve started to grow worried. After another fifteen minutes passed, before he  decided to check on Tony.  Just in case.
"St-teve please ..."  Tony murmured low in his throat, by now scarcely coherent. A plea? A praise? His thoughts were floating discordantly, muddled by  the delicious high he was currently riding.
"Glad to be back..or you know, sort of.." Tony stopped abruptly,  and turned around to look at Steve fully for the first time," how did the rest of the  team end up here anyway?"
The only detail  which gave any indication that he was indeed at the right location was the sign out front, hereupon  the company name was written in a bold green lettering evocative of some sort of leviathan monstrosity. Underneath this, a smaller line of text proudly proclaimed " for all your fantasies, fiendish or fun". And below that, in even smaller script of  lovingly embellished cursive  "established 2010"
Steve hesitated before signing as," Roger Star". Feeling only a mild twinge of guilt at the partial lie.
IHis first impression was that it looked..shockingly ordinary. Like a factory more then anything else. Typical long rectangle brick building. Tiny windows placed at coordinated intervals, all connected to a square building with welcoming set of double doors. A white van was parked in the otherwise deserted lot.
After some hurried shuffling of papers, the woman turned to gaze up at him wuth nearly folded hands, "Okay now first things first, may I ask what made you choose our services?"
His mind instantly conjured up all the worse case scenarios. What if Tony wasn't as well as he let on? What if he was lying unconscious on the floor right now? Trying to call for help but too weak? What if Steve himself had finally snapped and the whole thing was just a figment of his imagination?
"I know what you mean." Steve agreed softly. He did. All too well.
So despite some initial doubts and the questionable legality of the business, it was safe to say that Rent-tacle  had ended up being  an upstanding success. And maybe next time, he'd throw in jug of sex pollen as well.
"Excellent!" The woman tucked the papers away in a folder before turning to him once more," We will have it shipped to the address given on the form tomorrow as well as a set of instructions. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
Steve quickly found out that much like everything else in the modern world, there were OPTIONS. Customizations. And different service packages. The sales woman ran this all by him in a clipped, professional, tone that he found hard to keep up with.
Steve sank slowly  back down into a  halfway sitting position at the edge off the mattress. The disarray state of the covers, sign of the silent battles he had been fighting in his sleep. Battles he had lost, and which had cost him everything. Shakily he sucked in a deep breath.
"What about you? What happened after we lost contact with you? We tried to find you, but Dr.Foster said it'd be like finding a needle in a haystack. "
This year, Steve decided that he wanted to do something special for Tony's birthday. Choosing a gift for a billionaire who had the means to  buy anything he could ever want, was never going to be an easy task, but one which  Steve had always tackled head on. Tony's happiness was worth it. To Steve this meant either experiences or personal gifts(like the painting he did last year, immortalized from one of his sketches during holiday. Iit now hangs proudly above their shared bed) . This year however he was looking to do something...unique. Something which was inspired by  a chance encounter with one of the many open tabs on Tony's laptop.
Steve jerked into wakefulness with a start, heart pounding his ribcage with a force that was almost painful. Springing to his feet , he braced himself for the incoming attack..
Only to realize he was alone. And that it was currently 4:30 in the morning.
Having cleaned up once more, both men  sprawled lazily on their side,  turned so that  they could look into each other's eyes. Steve's hands threaded lightly through Tony's hair, a simple pleasure he almost thought he'd never experience again.
"You were in there for a while." Steve explained, suddenly feeling very sheepish," I thought something might have happened to you."
"Alright. Enough. I hate it when you stare at me like that." Tony was talking fast, trying to lighten the mood. Steve himself stood up not too long after, " I'll try to catch you up, but there's one thing I need to do beforehand..."
The other man  shrugged, " I survived. Thinking of the team helped. I was determined that one way or another we'd be reunited. Though as time passed I found it harder and harder to have hope", he admitted, '' Sometimes I still have a hard time  believing you are really here and this is not just a dream."
The modern world really did have everything.
"I was just a little bit preoccupied." Tony answered icily. For a few seconds both men stared at each other intensely..but neither one's heart was really in it. Steve ran a hand wearily down his face.
Steve was not stupid. He didn't miss the way his teammates conversation would often dwindle to a hush the moment he entered a room. Or the way they all had started acting as if they were  walking on eggshells when around him.  Treating him as if he was too fragile to handle the "truth". Tony had become the taboo subject that was on all their minds, but which none would dare to speak of.
"Now why don't I believe that."
"Oh?"
Steve still held his silence, and Tony shrugged before continuing his story at a faster pace," Not too long after I ran into the Beyonder."
Captain America never broke his promises.
"Yes."
As Steve went to  put away the razor,  Tony stared at his reflection for a few seconds, critically examining himself from several angles before running his fingers across his now smooth skin, "Not bad Cap." he admitted approvingly. A clean shave  may have been a small thing, but it did wonders to help feel in control again. More human.
Steve was more than a little dubious, but ylthe following day he took one of the jets out to the designated location.
Never again.
"It's your birthday, try to have a little fun."
"Does it look like I'm having fun to you?!" Tony retorted,  face already slightly flushed.  Steve wanted to say ,"yes, yes he did", at least  if the erection pushing at the front if his pants was any indication.Tony was locked in a losing battle, and the tentacles seemed to be growing restless. One had slithered its way up till it found an entrance at the hem of his pant leg, while two more were engaged in crawling  up his shirt, causing the fabric to strain and tear slightly against their combined girth (about the size of a man's forearm at their thickest point ). Tony couldn't quite suppress a gasp as one the tentacles had hit a sweet spot.
A hastily scribbled, but seductively enticing note  left in their shared  bedroom would get the ball rolling.  Purposely mysterious, but all the more tempting  because of it, with just enough of a hint to insinuate that good times were just ahead. (He had even left the little winking face ;) ) It would be the perfect balm after a rough day at work, and hopefully a birthday Tony would remember for years to come.
Stepping through the double doors, he was once again surprised at how ordinary everything was. The main hall was large and  meticulously clean, with multicolored  tiled floors and white washed walls. Straight ahead there was a guest counter of sorts(though Steve didn't see anyone), similar to what one  would find in a hotel lobby.  In one of the corners there was a makeshift  waiting area, consisting of  a couple chairs, vending machines, and a coffee table covered with magazines and neat, glossy  pamphlets that  presumably advertised the company. Across from that was a massive,  iron  door with an "employees only" sign.
Tony looked him up and down, with what seemed like eyes of judgment. "You look--"
The brown haired boy rolled his eyes. “The cuffed jeans. His daddy issues. Him being an absolute mess. Those three ingredients call for a bisexual.”
Tony ran his hands through his hair, letting out a long breath. "Talk."
"Would you just tell me what's going on with you?" Bucky asked, the light from his phone illuminating his face as he looked over at Steve. "I would rather
The blond didn't know it, but every once in awhile, Tony would look over and smile at this boy being such a dork about being able to have the window rolled down in the car.
Steve scanned his eyes up and down the outfit, admiring what Tony had done for him.
This chapter is going to be shorter than usual! Thank you all for reading, even with my very inconsistent updates.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well. To Tony, to Mrs. and Mr. Stark, and to Mr. Jarvis, I’m fine. I’m not sure what to tell you since who Tony dates doesn't concern you or your work for the family--”
"Yes, sir. All ears," Steve responded.
Does it matter?
“Ask him if he likes Sweater Weather by the Neighbourhood.”
"Yes, the problem. What was it again?"
"Steve, trust me, I know. My parents aren't very active in my life."
Tony, where in the world are you?
Steve nodded and got in the car, hitting his head against the top of the door frame. A small pulsing sensation started at the top of his head, and he rubbed it in hopes of the pain going away. The blond felt his face heat up, but the darkness inside of the car was enough to hide it. He pulled the car door closed and buckled himself into the seat.
Bucky’s head shoots up, and he gapes at Steve, wide-eyed, before he stiffens and glares at the door like he’s going to storm through it and haul Tony to the altar himself.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve smiles, but his eyes give him away. Nervousness stirs below the surface and the little muscle in his jaw that signals stress twitches.
A massive pile of blanket skitters across the floor as the burly super soldier underneath them scrambles backward and springs to his feet. Tony knows the moment Bucky registers who’s standing there, his expression waffling between defensive and sheepish but landing in a grim mixture of both.
When a flurry of orders and expectations are thrown his way, Tony’s day is turning over on its head so fast his brain spins in his skull. If Strange had wanted to fuck with him this bad, he could have slipped something into one of his drinks instead.
He cradles his last link to Tony in his palms and crawls into his too-big bed. When he curls under the duvet, he draws his knees to his chest and pulls the blanket over his head. With a click, the familiar blue light comes on, warm and welcoming.
“Shut up.”
Knowing that Steve regrets it all, that he would do it all differently, that he’s
He’s not naked now though, neither of them are, stripped down to boxers and undershirts as they slide between cool and unfamiliar sheets. Steve’s eyes grow sadder when they clock the arc reactor, fixed back into place in the centre of Tony’s chest. Steve doesn’t say anything, just shuffles forward, closes his eyes, and leans in slow enough to give Tony a chance to stop him before he presses his forehead against it.
“I guess I already know what you would have done differently.” Tony aims for a joke and Steve offers him an indulgent little half-smile.
"I need an impressive date to shut up Daddy Dearest. You're here."
"Steve?" Bucky said groggily as he opened the door. His hair was messy and part of his face was red from whatever he had been napping on. "Come inside, dude, what are you doing out here?"
Steve looked at Tony, "You're not as bad as I thought, either."
He nodded. "If this behavior continues to come from you, I'll have no choice other than to kick you off. If I don't, then the school sure damn will."
Tony got fed up, which was why he was here. Also maybe because he had happened to have a liking towards the football player, but that was beside the point.
"Hold on--" Tony smirked, "Did the infamously stubborn Steve Rogers just give up a fight?"
"And what does this piece represent, Mr. Rogers?" She asked, raising an eyebrow at him.
He and Sam both had made many attempts to try and get him to function on normal hours, like everyone else. But it just… didn’t work. It was almost like Bucky was born to be a nightowl.
"Of course," Steve said, gulping. He didn't want Tony to leave his side. How could he do this alone? He walked off in that direction anyway, trying his best to not look how he felt.
All at once it comes rushing back and the living room tilts on its axis. Steve jolts up off the couch, his body lethargic and unsteady as he tries to adjust to the mumble of conversation around him, words that stretch and claw for entrance to his brain but aren’t quite processing.
Tony hadn’t been sleeping well.
. As if he amounts to less than garbage and all that matters is a series of letters and numbers wrapped up in gold-titanium alloy. As if the man inside is devoid of value. As if Tony himself is—was—nothing at all.
By now he’s picked apart every claim Steve has made and he doesn’t need Steve Rogers treating him with kid gloves.
They tear apart, grinning.
Now that it’s happening, Steve is terrified.
He paces back and forth across the room, watching Tony at Pepper’s head, stroking back the wet hair falling low across her forehead. There’s a beautiful red flush to her skin, and if she wasn’t in intermittent bursts of pain, Steve might have told her this was the most beautiful he’d ever seen her.
“Fuck off, Wilson.” Tony gives him a cutting glare and Sam presses his lips together. “Aren’t you supposed to be some kind of therapist? What kind of friend are you, letting him get away with this bullshit?”
of recognition made it all worth it.
The why of it all isn’t quite clear, and the way she switches sides so effortlessly is tormenting to no end. But she’s had his back when it’s counted in the past, and despite himself, he misses her. Misses what they’d just started to carve out, before it’d all gone to shit.
Steve comes to him like a sexual marionette and when Tony turns around, already working at his belt and shoving down his slacks, Steve’s hands take over. His jacket is stripped off his shoulders and he hears the rustling of Steve doing the same before two hands shove him forward at the hips and he lands on his hands and knees on the bed, ass up, face down.
He slides the slick across Steve’s puckered entrance, relishing the way Steve clenches and releases before Tony’s even breached him, already begging to be filled. And he deserves a reward for that pretty picture, so Tony fills him carefully with one finger, then a second, whispering endearments and demands to relax as he seeks out Steve’s hot spot and strokes his fingers across it.
Suddenly he’s right there. Tony’s being wrapped up in beefy, oversized arms and all his weight is suspended in mid-air, limp and all but lifeless in Steve’s grasp. He feels like hell, but there are no words to express it and the tears don’t even bother to come to his eyes.
He knew he’d waited a beat too long when his enhanced hearing picked up what Tony said next. It was only the smallest hint of a whisper, muffled against skin. “Then why did you do this to me?”
“What are you doing? Peter!” Tony sounds outraged, but Steve ignores him. As long as he doesn’t get his hands on it, Steve can fix this.
Tony chuckles against his lips, grinning into the next series of kisses while fingers trailing up under Steve’s shirt and following the lines up his back. “Not sick of me yet?”
“Already asleep. Pep’s going to be with her.”
. Somewhere on the edges of his consciousness he thinks he hears a yelp, and when enough of his brain reboots, Steve opens his eyes and sees Tony wearing a mischievous grin, rubbing at an already purpling bruise at his throat.
Because he has listened, hasn’t he?
“You know I don’t like all that stuff, Mr. Stark.” Peter waves a hand behind him in a vague gesture and Tony understands. Peter never wanted all this, and if it weren’t for the Accords, Tony would have been happy to let him go on doing his thing and used everything in his power to keep Peter safe in his own neighborhood.
While Tony is grounded, giving Wanda and Vision direction from one corner, Steve dives for his legs, getting a grip around one boot just as Tony soars back into the air. From this angle he can crawl halfway up the armour, swaying into the buckling as it groans under his weight, and Tony’s laughter rings in his ear.
Tony glanced up at him expectantly like a baby bird, opening his mouth and glancing pointedly at the pot. As if Steve would
“FRIDAY, come on baby, get me some better audio here.” Tony grunts, the pressure of keeping his hold leaving him trembling with effort. The suit is screaming, the air is screaming, somewhere behind him Peter is screaming his way back down to earth but that's good screaming and he’ll be fine. Peter will be safe and everything’s fine.
“You saw it all, then?” Steve’s voice is the smallest of whispers.
“You still don’t get it.”
Steve strides towards him in half as many steps which forces Tony to lean back to look up at him as he reaches over him and shuts the door. This time, Steve pushes it hard enough to leave it rattling on its hinges.
“You’re a weird dude.”
The whole experience was amazing. Enlightening, even, and it had set the precedent for dozens of nights after where Steve lost himself entirely, greedy in his pleasure as he chased away Tony’s nightmares and kept him safe from his own subconscious.
“Yeah. We’re going to take them back, tomorrow preferably.”
Tony sighs, running a hand through his hair. The way Steve brandishes the words in a low voice as if they’re acid on his tongue, letting them slide with distaste into the sliver of space between them, should spark anger. It just leaves Tony with a deep sense of pity.
“Let it be stated, for the record, that I can be a very forgiving man.” Tony flicks them a charming smile. “Given the right incentive, of course.”
“After.”
“What are you–”
“Hey!” Sam crows, hovering a few feet above him. “You’re playing dirty.”
It’s more than that, though.
“Tony, don’t tease.” Steve grips his wrist and fucks himself down onto his fingers, watching Tony’s eyes dance with heat as he does. “I want you in me. Sweetheart, please.”
Steve hasn’t been there for months.
Steve had hoped to avoid coming here to begin with, but with Shuri unable to help him, Dr. Cho ignoring his calls, and Bruce still in the wind, he hadn’t had any other option. So, while Tony’s eye tracks him like a vulture circling the sky, Steve reminds himself there’s purpose to the feeling of being naked under his layers of too-big clothing. The gooseflesh rising on his arms is a price to be paid. He suppresses a full body shiver.
But the fact that there’s absolutely zero chance at a Captain America altercation means Tony lets himself join the team for dinner. The first time since they all came together.
Is it so ridiculous to imagine that the serum is the only thing he has left to hold on to?
Would it really bad so bad if Tony imagined that that’s what this was? In a way, this is another first.
“I’m going to go,” Rhodey fires off a quick response and huffs a breath, his lips tightening into a firm, almost sad line. He looks tired enough to sleep for a week, but still, the tactician in him is preparing. If all goes well and as planned, the Rogues will be pardoned and the team will need to be a
“I can’t help it. I look at you, and I just want everyone to know that I have you. That you’re mine.”
Steve opens for him, readjusting and tipping his hips up, reaching out with his arms, curling around Tony entirely as the wet heat of his body welcomes Tony inside and Tony can bury himself to the hilt. Everything narrows into Steve’s eyes on his, the clench of his ass around Tony’s cock, the taste of his mouth, and Tony drives into him with slow rolls of his hips.
“That’s what you said, right? To listen. Full stop.”
“Tony,
A rush of warmth floods Steve’s cheeks as he flushes, glancing down at the arc reactor then forcing himself to meet Tony’s eye. Now that it's real, embarrassment comes tumbling forward and he’s nervous. Nervous that Tony will change his mind and push him away when Steve’s heart can’t take that.
When Steve finally has him naked, he pulls Tony down on top of him in the ridiculous, massive bed.
In a way, the new apartment felt almost clinical with it’s white walls and pale blue curtains, littered with his meager belongings. There were only a handful of items left over after the destruction of the Compound, but Steve didn’t need much.
If he focused, he could even hear Tony’s voice.
All the mutterings stop, and the hand Pepper has in his hair slides down to cup his face. Both of her hands are on his cheeks and he squints to try and make sense of the mess of eyes and nose and mouth that should be her face, but contort into something else. Maybe it’s all the red blotches, new splatters of watercolour across her delicate features that have never been there before.
He didn’t want to miss even a second of Tony’s body welcoming him home.
“Okay. Okay, I know.” Tony braces a hand on his chest and pulls away, crawling out of Steve’s lap. “I don’t want to talk either. Come on.”
“I thought Rhodey would have told you.” Tony starts, “but I can also understand why he didn’t. After the fight – after the shield – the suit was destroyed. There wasn’t enough power to pilot it, and it had been bent in. I would have died, Helen said, if T’Challa hadn’t been there.”
Comments are much loved, let me know what you think!
What should he care if Barton didn’t think he was making an effort? Maybe Tony could rig one of his arrows to blow up in his face later. Oops, sorry Hawkeye, complete error. Must’ve been a miscalculation.
. Just like all the rest of us.”
It’s not as if he could do it all again.
He wants to live in this moment with the tickle of Tony’s hairy calves against the top of his feet, the feeling of Tony’s fingers digging into his thighs. There are never any bruises, but Steve wants him to dig his nails in deep enough to pierce skin if only Tony will leave his mark for a little while.
“Come upstairs with me.” Tony mumbles against his lips.
“Oh fuck, I want to suck you.”
“Anything. Anything for you.”
“Aw, Stevie, you big shmuck!” Bucky throws an arm around his shoulder, tugging him into a playful squeeze. “Come on, why don’t you catch me up on what I’ve missed. That’s okay, right Tony? You don’t need me for anything else? And you don’t mind if I—”
