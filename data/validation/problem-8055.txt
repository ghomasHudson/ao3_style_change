great..now he was angry...
the conference room was empty .he didn't know how long he's been lost in his thoughts when Nat called him to give him a file about the deal they had with the government and all that stupid shit he didn't really care about anymore..she was talking about the files in all that agent-assassin tone but honestly, he couldn't make out a word..he couldn't focus, at all..
"I ..I just..I'm sorry ..it's just.." he couldn't speak he didn't want to..at least not now because the images kept playing on his mind...
-"we...we have to do something.." it was Nat's voice that broke the ice..but even SHE was at loss...
-"shut up for a second..AND you will stay out if .."
"there..there's something?"
He wanted to talk to Nat..he had to know what's wrong..what they were talking about..he knew he couldn't talk to Tony and ask him..so, Nat, it was..but for now,they had bigger problems...tomorrow was the day..the day they were going to give people the news..about the return of  team cap..Tony was going to do the talking, as always..they were told to keep their distance and try not to be seen for now..so they were just going to play the guards..they weren't sure how the public would react to the news,so they were going to make sure nothing happened..nothing out of plan...
-"there's not much time so.." She couldn't believe it. Now she was angry. She couldn't believe that he had given up. He …Tony Stark … had given up. She blinked furiously and that made other tears to escape...
-"yeah..i guess"he felt like his heart was going to jump out of his chest and was wondering, it the music wasn't that loud, Tony could hear his crazy heartbeat.."umm..about what you said the other day.."he added nervously..he was freaking out and he hadn't even started..
"please… Steve…" his face was covered in blood...
-"yeah sure.." he wasn't sure he wanted him to continue...

"T...Tony.." his voice was barely audible..but he heard it ..and looked at him with those hazel eyes he was dying to see again...
I am soooooo sorry it took this long to update the new chapter ..
-"what would you do?I mean if you two were friends and you kinda knew that person would never feel the same but you just can't go on like that and have to make sure but you  didn't want to ruin everything.."
-"we need to talk.." he suddenly sounded serious...
-" hey...earth to Steve.." it was bucky..waving his hand in front of his eyes..when he finally looked up, he understood they had landed ..they were on the Avengers tower..every one was getting out.
_"oh my God..when did you become this soft on me Natalie?..seriously, its wore that that whole agent Romanoff thing..it freaks me out.." he said with a big smirk...
-"that's not what I'm worried about..you know that.." she said desperately..
-"I DIDN’T GIVE UP…. "He yelled...She took a step back.
he jolted awake with a scream..he was shaking and his forehead was covered in sweat. he looked around, he was on the couch in his apartment ..not in Siberia but still ..
-"of course.." he said with a warm smile...
-"yeah... I know..thanks.." he smiled as he left...THAT was what he loved about him..well, it was one of the many many things he loved about him..how he cared about everyone and wanted them to feel okay and fine and act like he ...
he looked at his hands..they weren't bloody..it was just a dream..another nightmare..he covered his face with his hands when Bucky suddenly entered the room and turned the lights on.."you ok?"
Now the story is starting to begin..
-"simple..I love you...just  jump and.."
It was three seconds..the first second he laid his eyes on him, he felt his heart stopped..the second one he felt his eyes burning with tears..he couldn't believe it. On the third second he didn't know what or how it happened but he was running to him and suddenly he was only a few steps away from him..he was aware that he was shaking and crying but he didn't care..he couldn't stop..all he wanted was to hug him and never let go..but he was afraid it was just another cruel dream and he would fade away..so he stood still..
-"look..you should give it time..everything will be okay.."
-"hey yourself.."he said it with his casual genious_billionare_playboy_philanthropist_Tony Stark smile..after a few seconds which passed by him, walking around and scanning the gym and steve, looking at him nervously, mostly cause he has been avoiding tony for the past few weeks and he was worried he would do something stupid like right now..
-"you?" he said it like it was obvious...
he took a step forward with shaky legs..he didn't know what to say..should he say anything? or more importantly, would he even look at him? answer him? after what he had done.."cpatain.." he said with a nod and that cool smile that only belonged to Tony Stark...
"hey...it's okay.."
-"please..i.. i just want to know..where is he"..he pleaded..
its been three days since the conversation in the gym that he found himself in the middle of his lab, ready to talk..just as ton noticed him and was walking toward him, he felt like WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?...he wished he could just run out but it was late..so he thought..screw it..be a man..spill it out..
-"can...can we talk?"he asked..he sounded nervous but still,serious..so serious it was scary..
let me know what you think
let me know what you think..
-"what took you so long?" he was trying his best to make him uncomfortable and by the look of it, he was doing it right...
they had no idea who was responsible for the attacks but what they did know was that, although the attacks had caused serious damage, still, it was like the attacker just wanted to play with them...there was no real purpose..or they thought...
they were busier than ever ..mission after mission..meeting after meeting.. he was afraid everything would be forgoten..so one day, which they were unbelievably and unexpectedly not-so-busy,he walked to the lab with an offer...
(See the end of the chapter for
-"did I?"
"my father ...he..he made that, you don't deserve it."
-"okay..again,sorry about today..maybe some othertime....um look i have to go..see you..bye.."and he hung up..before he could say anything else..he didnt know what he was so worried about, I  mean Tony is a busy man..right?..its normal for him to miss a dinner..he kept telling himself that but stil, something about his tone on the phone, made him worried..like super worried..he just hopped he was wrong and everything was ok..he decided to walk to the tower to  clear his mind...it was a long walk but he felt like he needed it..when he got there, it was as quiet as a grave...there was none to be seen..he looked as his watch and saw that it was past midnight..everyone was probbly sleep...he didnt know why but he found himself, going to the lab..to his surprise, it was empty..he wasnt there...he mustve been so tired...he went upstars to his room and throw himself to the bed..he didnt even have the strength to chancg so he just lay there and tried to sleep, which was kinda hard,or better say,impossible...he didnt know when he drifted but the next time he oppend his eyes, outside wanst dark anymore...his head was pounding..he needed coffee..a lot of coffee..
-"is that awkward or something now?" he was sweating and blushing...
sorry it took me this long to update the new chapter..
its been nearly a month since the whole confession and all that happily ever after-ish thing and they were getting closer..no one still knew anything about them ..it was nothing obvious or special ...not yet..just some kisses then and there and that's just it...
she held her gaze for another second then turned around to leave when he caught her arm and asked again...
-"there is nothing to do...they're gone.."
-"A..breath.....B..youre asking the wrong person cause I would probably spill everything out and ruin the whole thing ..BUT..i still think its the best way..you know..if its hurting you and all then you have to say and ..you can't be sure..she might love you as well.."
-"missions?.." he said..unsure..blushing a bit.." so ..you coming or what?"
he closed his eyes for a second, then with a tired voice asked.."why are you awake?"
-"something...I don't know...anything...it's been a month..we haven't done a thing..we're just sitting here and do nothing..."
-"its okay..I was just worried that's all.."
please let me know what you think about this chapter..LOVE YA..
everything was explained and still there was no sign of Tony..everything felt cold,frezing..no one said a word the whole meeting and even after ..they all just went to suit up and get ready to go.even clint was unbelievably silent and didn't make any wise-ass remarks, even when he had the chance to..they were all like soldiers, waiting for the commander to make a command. nothing more..
He couldn't bear this silence anymore..he was sure if he stayed here any more second he would lose what was left of his mind..he got up suddenly and went to the door,he was about to open it and run out when Bruce's voice stopped him..he sounded angry..not hulk's way angry but like offended and betrayed and...
-"wha..i .. I just wanted to know if he's okay..he never missed the meetings.." he tried to use that whole cool captain America tone but failed miserably...
-"why?"..
He felt like everything was spinning and his legs couldn't carry his weight anymore..everything was turning black and he couldn't make out the faces of the people who were standing a bit further ...all he could see and focus on was Steve's baby blue eyes and that was enough...HE was enough...he was all he wanted to see..even if it was the last thing he saw..steve's eyes...
-"you what? You just decided that it's a good time for a little break? For not being you? that now after all the shit you've been through it's time to just give up?"
-"he.." he said it before he could stop himself...
spaceship landed or better say crushed to the ground and by the look of it the pilot was a drunk idiot who had a death wish..but whoever it was, Thanos or any other asshole..they were ready for it ..what they weren't ready for ,was a bloody pale Tony Stark to come out of the ship with shaky legs..he was barely standing..
"What if somebody walks in?"
“Err.. Next time, tell him to have one of the guestrooms alright? In fact, you know what, he can choose one for himself, it can be Steve’s room here. ”
Tony nodded, then not sure if Steve saw it, said "Yup."
"Please.." Tony replied weakly, and the finger in him moved, searching for his prostate. Tony moved his hips to help that one finger and then gave a long moan when Steve hit his mark.
Once again, he didn't need to think, he didn't have the power the move things in one direction or the other. He just had to... be. Exist. As a set of body parts, that Steve seemed to enjoy looking at.
“Get you pregnant.” He went on, his voice turning into a low growl. Then he ground down on Tony’s hardness once more. One of his hands inched down to push Tony’s pants off.
Steve had never before gotten this strong an urge to hide and possess an omega so selfishly.
"Nothing you need to concern yourself with right now Tony. Either way, there's nothing to be done right now."
Tony looked at him, brows knit in a frown, lips pursed. Hating to admit how right Steve was. Thankfully the Captain didn't press him to answer.
"Oh I'm missing the point? How about you try to explain it to me then, I promise I'll try to listen very hard."
“At once Captain.”
“Almost two months?” Of course, how had Steve missed that? He had been too preoccupied with Tony to notice the timing. He was no expert but even he knew that couldn’t be natural or healthy. Then he remembered how different Tony’s heat had smelled that first time he had seen it happen, during the fundraiser. Something wasn’t right.
(See the end of the chapter for
It came as a surprise when Steve’s hand appeared beneath his nose, holding fried prawn. When he reached out to take it though, the hand pulled back.
"For me? Keep the company for me? "
"I was going for an omlette but the eggs insisted on being scrambled." Tony commented as he put the pan back on the stove and sat down to eat.
Tony finally turned around when he reached his car.
“Hey yourself.” Tony plopped himself down onto the chair in front of Steve’s desk without waiting for an invite. “One Tony Stark, as requested, delivered for lunch.” He said.
Steve smiled for the cameras as more flashes went off in front of his face. He was starting to see stars dance in front of his eyes but it was part of the show. It must be worse for Tony as his name was on the fundraiser but the thought didn’t help Steve even a little. He knew Tony Stark was the alpha that was born for the masses to adore. Steve Rogers, even after a prolific career as a dancing monkey, had never gotten used to being the center of attention. He bore it with grace and charisma but he had never been the type of alpha who fed on mindless compliments. His self worth did not ride on what the press wrote about him. He had been invited to his friends fundraiser so he would ‘gladly’ attend. The real reason was that Tony had reasonably argued, more famous names in the event meant more media coverage. And Steve really did want to raise money for the prevention of domestic abuse toward omegas.
"No! Just- God, please.. I am dying here.. " Tony said as soon as the gag came free. "I didn't' Don't- Please don't stop... Oh my god.. You have to fuck me, Steve, I am serious, I am losing my mind here.. Can't take this anymore.. You have to.."
"Do you want to have sex with me?" he asked.
"This is not bad Tony."
“Uh.. He’s a scientist, occasionally working with SHIELD. Why do you ask?”
"No."
And it had been maddening, having Steve lay him down, unbutton his shirt and touch Tony’s body with his big, warm hands, keeping him on the floor with his gentle grip, exploring him. Tony had been able to smell Steve’s arousal then, how much the alpha wanted him but Steve had gone no further than putting his lips and teeth to Tony’s skin.
Well, maybe not forever. He definitely wouldn’t mind if Steve were to tighten his fingers in his hair and pull Tony’s mouth a little closer between his legs, allow him to taste and smell what the blond alpha was hiding under those pants. But he knew Steve never would do that and he was okay with it. He could live with this. Just kneeling here, in silence and have Steve pet him. It was more than he had expected to receive and he would take whatever he could get.
"Mhm?"
(See the end of the chapter for
The warm wetness was broken by the occasional gust of colder air that teased his hole as the Captain breathed on it between small licks, then Tony gave out a long, drawn out moan when Steve just closed his lips around it and started to eat him out properly.
Steve had been glad to leave.
A minute passed.
“What do you mean? What does he mean? ” Steve asked first to the ceiling then to Pepper.
"Stop worrying. You know me, I know you. Try to relax, I freed up your week, but if you don't believe me, you can check with Ms Potts tomorrow. Today... There is nothing you can do Tony. There is nothing you can do, do you understand me? Let it go."
"Fine." Tony looked down at his hands then forlornly picked up the pencil.
"What the hell Stark?"
"It's not even dark yet." Steve said. They were under a half tent, in a meticulously designed garden, surrounded by high fences tastefully hidden behind climbing ivy.
Tony shivered. He could practically feel the doms lips hovering above the crook of his neck, making all the hairs prickle. Steve's tone was deep and teasing, yet his words made his butt ache with the reminder from the previous nights spanking. He froze with the pan half in soapy water.
Steve stopped turning, his hand slowed down on his cock but didn't stop.
"In my closet. You can go into my room." Steve answered poking his head around the hallway to answer. Then,
He followed the marks, as much as he could, dealing with any party who spotted him doing so. But soon he lost the track, coming to a stop, seemingly in the middle of a bunch of buildings, not knowing which way to go from there.
"No no no..." Tony tried to say around the gag when Steve pulled away. Tony let the toy ball go and it rolled off the bed, but all Steve did was chuckle and reach above to take the gag off.
"Are you calmer now?"
This is the exact thing I was trying to avoid, with my previous story too, I always try to update regularly and often, like every few days. I always have a bunch of chapters already written beforehand and story notes so that I know where I'm going in every chapter.
"You'll find out what I do with manipulative subs."
"How do I look?" Tony struck a pose with his hands open on each side.
"Would you beg to suck my cock?" Steve asked with a smile, and even that looked obscene when his lips were all wet and red under the water, pulled into a confident half smile that made Tony ache.
“Condoms.” Steve said.
“Um no. Remember you asked me what happens when Dr Banner gets angry? And the rage monster thing?”
“No.” Steve turned to look back at Tony, then ran a hand through his hair. “He is.. happy now. Quiet. I don’t want to push him to talk about it right now. After the heat maybe.”
Tony nodded, busy rinsing the pan and the plate.
Steve didn't reply but Tony could hear him rummaging around in the cupboards. When the rummaging stopped and the footsteps started getting closer to Tony's head, Tony tried to turn and look,
He had sat in silence while they drove to their plane, and then all through the flight, close to Tony’s side while the medics had applied first aid. They hadn’t let Tony sleep until the plane had landed on American soil but when they had carried Tony to the room in the infirmary, Steve had asked to go see him and the nurse had told him for the time being only family members would be allowed and Mr. Stark was asleep anyway.  That was a good sign, Steve supposed. They never would have let Tony sleep if there had been a concussion or anything.
But Steve stood his ground, feeling slightly ridiculous for his outburst. But Tony had been about to get away.
Then he started folding up his newspaper and got up. "But I plan to show you."
“Hello mister colonel. Nice to meet you.”
Steve’s stopped the gentle caress.
“Tony.. Your amnesia has complicated.. some things.” Steve started and at that Tony did give him his full attention.
Steve's hand was now petting the length of his back, his hair, and wiping his tears but he didn't want to move.
“It’s a long story. And one that I’m not sure I know the details of. I don’t want to mislead you. Maybe it’s best if you remembered on your own.”
Tony knew he should be angry, probably. Frustrated. Well, he was frustrated but it was a dim kind of frustration, not the kind of indignant frustration he'd feel if he wasn't so .. unhooked. He recognized the feeling as a very superficial form of subspace.
“Colonel Rhodes is on his way up.”
“Did the doctors say anything? They wouldn’t tell me anything Pepper, did they tell you about this?” Steve turned to Pepper, immediately in business mode. Assessing the situation and planning what to do next was better than fretting. So he concentrated on that instead of the worry blooming in the pit of his stomach.
"What??" Tony's jaw was hanging in shock. He knew he hadn't done such a great job, ok, but he'd never expected Steve to be so rude.
“Everyone keeps saying that. Why does everyone keep saying I hated Steve? Look, you seem like a nice guy and all but butt out. He’s been nothing but supportive for as long as I can remember. Granted, it’s not a long time, but he’s been there for me when he didn’t have to be. He’s been patient with me and yes, I remember him. Not everything, but all I remember about him is positive. If we hated eachother as much as everyone seems to think, all I can say is that I must have been pretty dumb back then to not realize what a great guy he is.”
He didn’t worry about the Banner guy though, even if most of the department had fled the area. Steve had told him he had nothing to worry about so it’d be fine. Instead he was concentrating on taking measurements on the resistance of the nano-fiber material they had been working on for the past week.
And he was hard again.
"Do you want to use your safeword?" Steve interrupted.
He laid the omega down, he had to struggle to gently keep Tony from curling up on himself. He pulled off the pajama pants and the boxers Tony was wearing, rubbed him down quickly with a discarded t-shirt, then laid down next to him and wrapped himself around the omega as best as he could before pulling the covers over them both.
"I will expect physical and domestic service from you. It's both for your training and peace of mind. You will be doing the cooking, cleaning, laundry and ironing in this house. You will not only provide sexual service but also serve as my valet and butler."
"Oh no way in hell I'm telling you buddy." Tony answered immediately. A murmur rose up once more. "I'd rather get married in peace, thank you." he added over the noise.
"Shirt too."
Unfortunately for him he'd forgotten to put salt in the eggs and it tasted as bland as eggs could be. He looked up to see Steve putting salt on his food with a very serious face.
The colonel didn’t sound annoyed exactly, but Steve still caught the tiniest amount of distaste in his tone.
Now as he knelt on the floor with his head on Steve’s lap he wondered if he’d had any other alphas before? He couldn’t imagine kneeling for anyone else other than Steve but now that he was kneeling here, he also couldn’t imagine going through life without experiencing this relief and bliss.
"I am leaving," he said instead, hanging his head. "I am no good for you. I should go."
"No." Steve answered once more.
"Not your best save."
"You did so well, it's over now."
"You're gonna spank me now aren't you? Or wash my mouth with soap? Come up with some weird humiliating punishment?"
Steve nodded then. Again, several options crowding into his brain, to avoid signing the vouchers. But they were right. As long as Stane's document existed Tony's property would be in danger. If they got married.. No, WHEN they got married, Steve thought a little giddily, if Tony ever wanted to declare the document null, the board would once more push Tony into signing his shares over to Steve. This way, it'd be on Tony's terms. Then he could sign them back over toTony.
There was a moment of silence in which Pepper mussed her make up further by rubbing her eyes.
As if reading his mind, Steve pushed in a third finger and Tony felt his balls draw up.
"I want you to wear your service uniform to the wedding." He said. "Then I want you to fuck me wearing it."
"See you around Stark."
At that, Pepper let a small laugh escape and Tony glared at her.
"Do you find the proposal fair Mr Stark?" was the answer.
Steve was still doubtful. How would it work? He could picture himself being there for Tony, gently guiding him, comforting him, dominating him. But he couldn’t, in good conscience, have sex with Tony, own Tony or be a true alpha to him. He could play at it, until Tony got his feet back under him but how would that effect Steve? What kind of torture would it be to have Tony but not have him? Could he do it? Should he? How would Tony react to such an arrangement once he got his memories back? He’d probably hate Steve. He’d feel humiliated.
“God damn it, Tony, what are you doing..” He said as he knelt next to the omega but it came out more worried than angry. The scent of Tony’s heat was fresher in here, but muted. His body was trying to compensate for the heat loss rather than preparing the omega for a pleasant sex marathon. The engineers lips had gone blue, as well as his fingertips which Steve had to pry open from around Tony’s knees. First thing he needed to do was get rid of the wet pajama bottoms, wet clothes only worked to suck off heat. When Steve touched him, his skin was cold and clammy. Tony gave no indication that he’d noticed Steve was there until Steve picked him up, bridal style, to carry him to the bedroom. Only then Tony turned his gaze to look at Steve, but he still wasn’t speaking. His teeth wasn’t chattering, nor was the omega shivering anymore. Steve knew enough first aid to know that this was very bad indeed.
In the end the colonel broke the silence,
“No.” He said calmly and got out of the bed, letting the covers fall.
Well, my computer died. Taking my written material and notes for future stuff along with it. Apparently I backed up all my real life related projects and such but not the fanfic:( And I've been working on a huge project irl so I've been too busy to spare time to try and salvage it. Hence this emberresment happening right now.
“Yeah whatever. What did he do? What did
“You’re not alone now Tony. Listen to my voice. Look at me.” Steve sounded calm and strong. His alpha. His alphas voice.
Tony didn't like this but without safewording out there was no way he could get out of Steve's "exercise plan". Plus, he didn't want to prove Fury right by chickening out of following directions. Steve wouldn't let him brain himself on a piece of gym equipment, would he? No. Tony at least trusted the guy to keep Tony from injuring himself.
A thought occurred to him when he walked into his bedroom.
"That'd be excessive. But alright, I'll help you."
"Here. As promised." he said, and Tony nodded in thanks, "I have some work to do. On the computer. You can stay in your room and have some free time until lunch. If you want you can join me in the living room."
Tony’s hands were trembling. He shook them out a couple of times to get rid of the irrational shiver and when that didn’t help he banged his hands on the wheel.
"When we're home I'll help you settle in, then I'll punish you for disobeying the first order I gave you. We have the week off. I've arranged everything with Ms Potts, in case this meeting went well. I'll inform her that it did. Now heel."
Tony slapped his arm not so lightly.
Steve nodded but didn’t say goodbye yet, looking more awkward if it was even possible, he started,
But somehow he couldn’t. Only years of ingrained training and experience had stopped him from dropping to his knees when Steve shut the car door on his face. Then the simply hurt look Steve gave him when Tony basically told him to fuck off...
Then Steve dumped the clothes into a basket, right next to his feet and took the drawing out of Tony's hands.
"What Tony!? What more do you want from me!?" Steve stopped pacing to face him. "If you think I am going to force myself on you, you are wrong. I am hurt but I'll live. You can relax and stop feeling guilty about it!"
Tony was furious. He marched right into Steve's room only to find it empty. Of course Captain early bird was already up and about no matter that it was barely 6:30am. Tony stomped into the living room, ready to find Steve and tear him a new one but the dom was just calmly sitting in a chair in the kitchen sipping orange juice with a paper newspaper spread on the table.
“The information is only available to Mr. Hogan, Colonel Rhodes, Ms Potts, me and of course, now, to yourself Captain.” JARVIS intoned. “May I advise you on how important it is to keep this information from any other parties, as it would have considerable legal ramifications on Mr. Stark’s possessions, should the knowledge leak into the press.”
“I haven’t mentioned my suspicions to him. But I’d like to report to him, yes. Tony Stark is under contract with SHIELD. It is illegal to forge a contract under false information. Not to mention the risk this puts SHIELD in. We also have to address the matter of the failure of our intel gathering methods. It’s not everyday that a mark manages to fool Agent Romanov. She was the one that compiled the evaluation report on Mr Stark when SHIELD was considering him for the Avengers Initiative.”
"Good. Now take off your shirt, and undershirt, shoes, socks. Then kneel." he said.
"Ready?"
"After.. After the memory loss.." Steve half asked through a dry throat. Tony might be sore but the serum in Steve's veins was something else.
Steve laughed.
“Tony. At the border.. You didn’t seem.. It didn’t look like you were..comfortable with the SHIELD team and Coulson. ”
"Yes you asshole, you made me drink a huge fucking glass of water!"
"Tony." The dominant spoke, and Tony thought he recognized the voice. It was a very very familiar voice.
Tony was once more, surprised to find out that yes, he would like to keep the blindfold on for just a little bit longer.
Banner chuckled quietly.
Now as he laid on the Captain's bed while Steve carefully removed it, Tony both mourned the loss and celebrated the freedom. His cock, likewise, stood up to cheer.
Steve’s head whipped up and he turned on the high stool he was sitting on to face the door,
A thumb caressed his pink hole, as if responding to the little wink, then Tony froze, every muscle in his body tensing up when the thumb was followed by a tongue.
“Experimental as in FDA approved experimental?”
But Steve didn’t miss the way Tony’s shoulders relaxed just the tiniest bit. Then Tony returned to the couch and held out the drink. Steve didn’t take it. Instead he picked one of the thin cushions off the couch and put it on the floor, right next to his feet.
“Sorry Captain. But I can’t tell you. I need to find Tony right now. Now please move or I’ll have to make you.”
The next day Steve was there again, while they went to visit the SHEILD medical, informing the appointed doctor of Tony’s amnesia. Various tests were done but they didn’t reveal anything. To all outward appearance Tony looked fine. When the doctor suggested Tony visit the psychiatry department Tony looked at Steve with huge, pleading eyes.
"Steve!" Tony protested, upset, unsure and unsettled by how cold Steve sounded now.
First Steve very carefully took the cock cage off of him, then sitting next to Tony on the bed pressed the cool washcloth over his face. It felt heavenly. Then Tony was handed a glass of water. It tasted soothing and made him realise how parched he was feeling. After that the Captain made him lie on his front.
“Tony..” Pepper breathed out, horrified, as her hands rose to her mouth in a nervous gesture. She didn’t know how to take the news. Steve knew how she was feeling.
When the man was asleep, the force of his personality toned down, looking at him made Tony feel old, ugly, dirty and used up.
In the end he had realized he had no choice but to confess to Steve that he needed help. He needed Steve’s help. He was so tired. Only after one day, the strain had been too much. It hadn’t been hard to admit, not really, choosing the words hadn’t been easy but the admission had forced itself out of Tony’s mouth. He needed the bubble of safety, in which he knew where he stood as an omega, where Steve stood as his alpha and he had to do nothing but obey. At least until he got a grip on this new reality that surrounded him.
Coulson nodded again,
Cool cream was gently rubbed into his cheeks and Tony relaxed, melting into the covers that smelled like Steve. Everything was soft and hazey, he felt taken care of, cared for. It was as welcome a feeling as it was foreign. He decided he was too tired to think about it.
Steve pulled Tony by the hand, positioning him in his lap, face down, with his caged cock between the Captain's big thighs. The dom took care to place pillows where necessary to make sure Tony was as comfortable as possible. When he was positioned just as his dom wanted, and a big palm rested on his bottom, Tony sighed. This was not that bad.
"I'll start a tally then." he said easily as he tied the belt. Tony weakly struggled against the doms hold but it wasn't a real effort, it was mostly to test it. It held.
"I'll.. uh.. I'll run my tongue all over your cock first, I.. um I'll lick into the slit, gather every bit of your precum. I bet you taste delicious.. And I'll lick and suck your balls.. Untill you're all wet and- and you can't take it any more, that you wanna grab my hair and want to force me down on your cock.. But then I'll swallow you whole, right to the root, until my lips touch your balls.. I can Steve, I can do that.. I'll swallow around your cock.. You'll feel my throat trying to work it. You can touch my throat even and feel how you fill me up.. Oh.."
At that Pepper got such a pitying look on her face that Tony had his answer.
And for most of the day Tony hadn’t seen him. Being alone in a world that was foreign to him had been hard. And forbidden to gather information about SHIELD, he had convinced himself he could act better if he knew more about himself. What he had done, what his place had been in among these people. Everyone had acted like he was a hero, some liked him, some didn’t and Tony felt frustrated never knowing why. So he’d reasoned, he could get a sneak peek at his own files at least. But he hadn’t known where to start.
Dropping his mop and bucket for a moment, he took the penny to his room to tuck it in a safe pocket. When he returned to pick up his mop, he was whistling to himself.
Steve's fingers dug into Tony's shoulders, creasing the smart jacket he was wearing and probably leaving bruises but Tony didn't mind one bit.
"Why?"
But he knew the panic was irrational and he could safeword out anytime. At this point, he didn't even need the safeword, he could just get up an walk away. The tought calmed him a little, so he forced himself to speak "Yes. I won't look up until I have permission."
Rogers tapped Tony's hip and Tony spoke.
“95.0 degrees Fahrenheit.”
Steve curled his fingers around Tony’s as he watched the colonels expression closed off, his eyes fixed on their joint hands.
"The door, Tony, get the door."
It didn't take long. Very soon, Tony was a writhing moaning mess.
"I thought I was." Tony replied. "Wait, do you know who Steve's bestman is?"
It didn't take Tony too long to get bored.
Tony looked at the guy with his jaw on the floor. Odin? Loki? Greatest energy source known? He had been there??? What?
Only problem was that huge glass of water was starting to make itself felt again. Tony shuffled his feet a bit.
“Good?” Steve asked and Tony nodded. This was kind of nice. Actually, more than a little nice. It felt foreign too, not familiar like some things did, even through the amnesia. No one had hand fed him before, apparently. Tony decided he liked it, despite the indignity. Even that, he didn’t mind much when it was Steve feeding him. There was something that felt inherently right in the action, the alpha provider, providing for his omega…
He tried to forget the extremely vivid memory of Steve carrying him to the limo. It had been nothing. It should mean nothing. It was such a simple act. Tony didn’t remember much before or after that. Only that he had been at the fundraiser.
The colonel nodded and picked up the mug Steve brought him.
"You're not ready for sex in this relationship right now Tony, because I don't want you to think this is all about sex. If I slept with you now you would think that's all I want from you and we'd be done. You being my sub doesn't mean you just submit to me sexually, it means trust and surrender. Even when you submit in bed, I'm certain that you make sure you have the upper hand. How many doms have found themselves politely kicked out by Ms Potts in the morning? You can't be finding any of those encounters satisfying."
“What? Just making new friends. You know, since I don’t remember the old ones.” Tony answered petulantly.
"On your front." Steve's command was simple and direct. Tony rolled over and wriggled his butt with a smile over his shoulder.
"Well, it is kind of important and I thought you let me keep the prototype model so maybe you wouldn't mind."
Tony felt the burn and the stretch but it just felt good, the pain scratching a deep itch inside him, when he wanted to feel more, deeper, stronger... The fingers moved, and it got even slicker. Tony realized the Cap had probably added lube to make it easier but he just felt open, available and absolutely surrendered to whatever the dom wanted to do to him.
Tony’s shoulders slumped.
Steve was a healthy alpha. And one that had been alone for far too long. More than 70 years at this point. When he thought about having a lover, he thought he or she would be the one. The one to settle down with. The sentiment had been old fashioned even back in the 40’s, but it was just the type of guy Steve was.
Instinctively his nostrils flared, trying to catch some sort of scent of distress, illness or anything. But even the enhanced sense of smell the serum had given him was thwarted by the mixed scents of perfume, high quality food and alcohol in the crowded hall.
Tony smiled.
Steve sat down on the couch and took his head between his hands.
“But he must have been scared.” Pepper concluded.
“Agent.. Banks.” Steve interrupted him, remembering the name. He was trying hard to keep his cool. “Do you think if Tony Stark wanted to access files above his clearance level, he would go about it like a common thug? Sneaking into senior agents rooms and fiddling with paper copies? I assure you, he is more knowledgeable than you about the surveillance systems of SHIELD and if he really wanted to break into your data storages, you wouldn’t even know about it.”
Steve pulled Tony up into a sitting position, which wasn't hard to do, since Tony was all loose limbs at this point. The dom hugged him to his chest, careful to keep Tony's weight on the subs thighs instead of his abused butt.
Also! I've finally seen Winter Soldier! Badass Steve is always so yummy to me. He was SUCH an alpha in this film. More so than the other ones, in my opinion. *drools a bit*
Tony pulled into his garage without even bothering to park his car neatly. He just hit the breakes as the door of the garage door lowered behind him. He sat there, in the car, sitting crooked in the middle of the row of cars, and he tried to breathe normally.
Then, “How long do I have to stay here?” Tony asked Steve, and Pepper and Steve looked at eachother.
Then came the part about Agent Romanov and Agent Barton, which, after the Norse god story, fell a bit flat. Steve thought Tony only needed to meet Natasha in person and to watch Clint in action to understand why they were on equal ground with a Norse God on a battle field.
“With the fundraiser.”
“We can’t take him to a doctor for this Steve. Don’t worry about. This is not Tony’s first time.” But she sounded tired rather then terse.
“He turned me down before, didn’t he..” he said and looked down. Suddenly needing that glass of cognac.
"You-"
On the morning of the sixth day, Steve woke up to an empty bed. Having run through the house looking for him, he found no sign of Tony except the dissipating scent of his heat. Tony was gone and all Jarvis had to say on the subject was “Mr Stark has left the building. He requested that I give you no further information on his whereabouts.”
The scorch mark and a small crater was there. But no Tony, no suit. He could see where the suit was dragged on the ground, but there was no way of telling if it was Tony who had dragged himself to some sort of safety or Syrian special ops team salvaging the remains as fast as possible. If the latter was the case, reverse engineering could be a problem. Last thing they needed was a version of the War Machine in the hands of Syrian military.
He tiptoed through, creating funny little prints on the floor, and stopped when he spotted a penny tucked up next to a cabinet. He leaned down to pick it up.
Steve hadn’t exactly forbidden Tony to speak but for what he wanted to do, he preferred Tony didn’t. Anyway, he alreadyknew how Tony preferred his food from all those times they ate together in Tony’s workshop.
First order of business, as soon as Steve reached home and he closed the door behind him, he shucked off what was left of his dress uniform and threw himself into the shower. It was almost an embarrassingly short amount of time before he came into his own hand, his erection finally going down.
Steve landed a hit between each word, and soon Tony was sobbing, his face a mess of tears and snot. In a matter of seconds he was unable to catch a breath to talk back. But just as when it was getting to be unbearable he was tipped back up to sit on Steve's knee, gasping and sobbing.
Steve pulled first one of Tony's wrists down near his thigh, then the other, and Tony let himself be moved however the Captain wanted, curious and excited. He was rock hard already.
After that Tony was silent, and Steve went back to his book. It was a while before Tony could concentrate on his prototype again.
Safe.
He had dreamt of Tony a few times. It was either a nightmare, a variation on the fundraiser evening in which Steve was just a little too late, or Tony going into heat in the middle of a battle or something equally horrific. Or it was the sort of dream that made Steve wake up to sticky sheets with Tony’s remembered scent still under his nose.
I'm so sorry if you've already read this. I've added some scenes. I hope even if you've read this before, it won't disrupt the flow of the story. I usually plan out my chapters before writing and always have a few chapters ahead already written before posting. Apparently it's not enough caution, I hope it wont happen again.
“Are you stalking me Cap?”
“What?? I wasn’t-”
“Yes. In the Syrian facility. We were getting Natasha and Clint out. Remember?” Steve was getting worried but it was also understandable that Tony would get a little disoriented after a fall like that.
"Pretty much." Barton leaned forward and ran a hand through his hair. "But it's not as simple as that. I'd never suggest that you turn out like me. Fuck I'm a mess, I'll be the first to admit that. But.."
“I will. Steve I’m so sorry.”
Happy froze for a moment, looking like he didn’t know what to do when the command was issued by an alpha that even his boss listened to. Occasionally. Then pulled himself up to his full height, which fell only a an inch or so short of Steve’s, and squared his shoulders like he was revving for a fight. After all he had never been a coward and Steve knew how loyal he was to Tony.
For a moment Tony felt Steve's chin touch his head as the captains arms tightened around him. Then he had this curious sensation like a light kiss pressed into his hair.
When Steve was fully clothed, he allowed Tony to put on clothes too. By the time Tony was done getting dressed wearing a borrowed pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt, Steve was already back with a notebook and a pen in his hands. He put them down on the table.
The hand feeding Rogers insisted on had been awkward. Tony hadn't been expecting that. It was uncomfortable, messy and embarrasing, he could feel the collar touch his adams apple every time he swallowed. The surprising part was how Tony felt after it. Rogers took in stride every awkward moment of it and made it feel normal, every  embarrasing glob of sauce on Tony's chin was wiped away carefully and the mocking Tony half expected every time, never came. When it was over Tony felt like he'd been through an ordeal, and it hadn't gone half as bad as he'd assumed it would be.
When a pair of very clean soft brown leather shoes came into his line of sight he forgot about how weird it felt to be kneeling though. Suddenly a dominant, /his/ dominant was standing in front of him. It changed everything. Something sparked in the pit of his stomach, looking at those shoes, feeling the mans gaze looking down on him. The mans speech about Tony's character flashed back into his mind.
Not right now though. Right now Tony was falling asleep in his arms and Steve inhaled deeply, trying to burn the memory of Tony’s scent into his mind.
When the car stopped, Tony startled to see when Rogers said 'home', he meant his own home, not the Stark tower.
“Did you get the low sodium soy?” Tony suddenly asked from under Steve’s hand.
Turns out, despite all the mockery and the petulance, Tony did take Steve seriously as his alpha. Steve had asked one of the guys from the department to call Steve if Tony left the R&D floor but when lunch time had arrived and Tony walked in after knocking on his door, Steve hadn’t received any calls.
“I died.” He tried to say. “I was alone. And I…”
But after a while, he had no idea how long, could have been minutes, could have been hours, or mere seconds, Steve was back, to gently hold his wrists to pull his hands away from the wall, not even bothering to catch the pennies as they fell every which way. He helped Tony straighten his back and stand up, get his legs moving again, to support the subs weight.
Pepper tried to smile but it was clear she didn’t believe her own words. Two hours wasn’t such a long time. It was a long time to be buying donuts but not nearly long enough for any police department to consider it seriously as a missing person case, especially when they couldn’t tell the police that Tony Stark the billionaire hero who had a billion different enemies, had amnesia. All the hospital listings she’d checked had turned out unhelpful too. She knew it was irrational but what else could she do? Tony wasn’t anywhere near SHIELD, no one from SI had seen him, Jarvis refused to look for him, Coulson had told them he’d dispatch a team but really, it was too early to tell yet.
Coulson looked at him searchingly for a few seconds. Then he seemed to accept Steve’s answer.
"And time. Alright Tony, step onto the mat right in front of you, 4 straight steps, then stop."
"Don't try to mind fuck me Barton, I swear on my mothers grave I'll make you regret it if you try to pull some dom crap on me right now." Tony bit out.
Planning on regular updates from now on. Thanks for putting up with me.
“Of course.” Agent Coulson, closed the dossier he was working on at once and turned his attention to Steve, pointing to the chair in front of his desk. “Please.”
"You think this is unfair?"
“Holy shit! Does he like turn into a monster or something? Is that why the R&D department ran away from him? That quiet little guy! How cool is that?”
When Steve opened his eyes Tony licked his lips and said, "Yes."
There was no answer, so Steve laid his head back on the backrest of the sofa.
"I'm very impressed with you today." Steve told him.
At that Pepper raised her eyebrows but Steve ignored her.
Tony turned the words over in his head, trying to make sense of it. Of course they were on the same side, they were on the same team, weren't they?
Tony grudgingly nodded, rubbing his itching cheek on the inseam of Steve's pants. The hand went back to petting his hair. Tony had to admit it kind of felt nice.
"I'll take the bottle." he said, sounding defeated even to his own ears. In the next moment Steve was next to him, carding his fingers through Tony's hair where his head was hanging between his shoulders.
"I see you, Tony. All of you. And I want you so bad. It's driving me nuts watching you walk around naked. All strength and stubborn wit. You have no idea how tempting you are."
"No! No way! No way in hell I'm peeing in a bottle!"
Tony wasn't sure what had woken him up. He felt completely rested. Steve was a tangled starfish next to him on the bed, radiating body heat. His eyes were closed and his lips were together, cheek slightly smushed on the pillow. His jawline was breathtaking from this angle, hair messy like Tony didn't get to see often. And his eyelashes in the moonlight looked impossibly long, making the Captain's whole face look boyish and young.
"Fuck, Steve, that's not what I meant! I just.. I just think you deserve better than being stuck with me as a sub!"
“Just.. Umm. Just tell me if you feel pain and..”
"Then I would like to draw you tied up tonight. After your punishment."
Steve tapped the tip of his finger under Tony’s chin to shut him up and Tony did. Steve waited a moment to see if Tony would speak up again, but the other man stayed silent.
Because it was a misunderstanding at the core of the matter, wasn’t it. Steve had misread the situation. Maybe at first he had been right to give Tony his space. But later.. No matter what had happened between them in the past, Tony was a grown man and he could make his own decisions. Steve had to trust Tony to know what he wanted. And clearly, Tony wanted Steve. He had been such a meatball to push Tony away. In the end it had drove the omega to the point of torturing himself to control his desires rather than violating what he believed to be were Steve’s wishes.
Barton shook his head. "Nah, sorry, I work for the big spy. Being able to keep your mouth shut kinda is the job description."
"You're only a tease if you don't follow through. Finish the dishes and come to my room."  With that, the dom was gone.
He didn't really believe the guy would take the deal, because they'd never let any dominant into the room with Tony before screening him to within an inch of his life to make sure his motives matched Fury's. The dom was probably a perfect SHIELD drone that never did anything wrong.
Nothing could be wrong with something that felt so good. He would leave the worrying to Steve. Steve probably would know best anyway.
"The correct answer is 'Yes Steve'. Say it."
“But. Tony we didn’t always get along well. Last time we had a conversation you called me King Kong and told me to back off.”
"Where are my other stuff? And what do you mean naked?" Tony started, but Rogers interrupted him again.
And the shape Steve tied him in was comfortable, allowed Tony's to relax and be held in position by the rope. Steve's hand was sure on his limbs and skin, moving and smoothing, calming, and demanding.
"Really. That was a big load, thanks Tony."

“The cold. There was no air. I don’t want to do this.”
“Of course sir.”
When the balding senior agent had caught him and started to yell at him though… He wasn’t as practiced at pretending to be an alpha to deal with an angry alpha who seemed to outrank him. He hadn’t known the agent couldn’t outrank him until after Steve had saved his ass. He also hadn’t been as practiced in dealing with it as an omega either. He was somewhere in between, alone, unsure of his place, unable to hold on to one side or the other. He had tried to channel Pepper, the way she had glared down Steve… But in this foreign situation it had seemed impossible. Pepper knew who she was, where she stood, what she was capable of and what other people could do. Tony didn’t know any of it, he had relied on Steve. And Steve had been absent. As much as he wished for Steve at that moment, the second his wish had come true, it had hit Tony that, Steve had once more caught him in the act of breaking Steve’s order about not seeking out information.
“Speaking of lack of control.. Now this guy,” he said, “is bad news.”
Steve frowned this time.
"My butt-"
“Nothing much. Just flashes. Although I’ve been thinking.”
"You don't mind if I draw you?"
Tony laughed into the dip between Steve's collar bones.
"How do your arms feel?"
Steve caught Bruce first.
“I wouldn’t know about that. Because you told the whole department to keep secrets from me.”
“Alright! Alright, fine. I won’t. Happy? Now can we eat?”
"I don't 'have' to do anything."
Tony banged his head on the wheel this time then flinched when someone honked loudly right next to him.
The whole premise of the story is that Tony is a submissive that has trust issues and Steve wants to teach him it's ok to trust. He is doing this by appealing to Tony's submissive nature and in turn they will both be learning leassons in dominating and submitting. At least this is the plan. Steve does NOT aim to break Tony, neither do I. But certainly both of them will come out of the experience as changed people. It's not a bug, it's a feature.
"I am glad to hear that Tony."
“You don’t have to apologize.” Banner smiled kindly and Tony struggled to see even the tiniest hint of what had scared the other scientists away. There was nothing. The guy was more of a very shy nerd than a big green rage monster.
Steve started to stroke this time, up and down, making Tony feel a bit like a cow being milked. He could feel the intense blush around his neck and ears, brought on both by his position and what the Captain was saying.
It was torture. But Jarvis was right. There was nothing else they could do. Steve’s mind was exceptionally vicious in the worst case scenarios it was constantly coming up with. Most of them centered around the special nightmare in which Tony woke up to his memories, saw Steve in bed and hated himself for every single time he knelt in front of Steve, every singe touch and kiss, felt violated.
"Tony."
It was a good feeling. So good that while he listened to Steve flip through the pages of some magazine above his head, he thought he could sit here like this forever.
“I don’t know them, I don’t trust them. I don’t trust SHIELD either. Aside from that, I’ve already figured out what it would mean for the news of Iron Man losing his memories to get out. It’d make me fish in a barrel. Best I can do for now is to hang in there and try to remember.”
Tony shook his head. "No. No gags, I'm good thanks."
"Alright." he said.
Upon receiving the news of Tony’s amnesia, Coulson had given up on hounding Steve’s steps to get a report from Tony on the events in Syria. They had sat down with the director and debated if they needed to bench Tony. Steve had argued no more than a week was necessary for Tony’s recuperation. There was no way to tell when his memories would come back, but Tony was a fast learner. And isolating him certainly wouldn’t help Tony remember. Fury had agreed to let Steve bring Tony back after a week of orientation, but refused to let Tony use the Iron Man suit. Steve had pointed out they couldn’t stop Tony if he really wanted to use his own damn tech. A fight had ensued about unauthorized use of advanced weapons by underqualified personnel. Steve once again had pointed out no one was more qualified than Tony, and he wasn’t SHIELD personnel and that the suits weren’t mere weapons, they were a part of the genius.
Tony whistled. “I don’t blame the R&D guys, though you said Dr Banner had been struggling to control it? What happens when he can’t control it?”
In line with Tony’s progress in adjusting, Steve started to let Tony get more involved in SHIELD’s projects.  Since simply being there didn’t seem to be helping him remember much. So one morning, he paid Coulson a visit.
"It's your house!" He protested even as he stood up and went to open the door.
Then kneeling on the floor. He fixed his gaze to his knees and settled in to wait.
“You looked too serious in the photo they showed me. Nice to know I wasn’t friends with a guy with a permanent stick up his ass.” Tony said, completely at ease with Steve touching him so casually, he even scooted his chair a little closer to Steve’s.
The smile dropped off Tony's face and he looked down at the basket with a frown.
He had decided to stay after tucking Tony into bed. Not through the night but for a little while longer, to make sure Tony slept peacefully.
“Wait. Are you authorized to know all this? I mean.. Of course you were there when Loki tried to take over the world but still, if no one told you about it already, maybe I shouldn’t be telling you either?”
“So what you’re saying is,” Steve started, trying to contain his anger but Tony cut in,
“Yes. Ok.” Steve said n the end, walked to the elevator but then stopped, “You do know I’m not going to tell anyone right? I hope that goes without saying?”
“What about it Cap?”
That clever, frustrating man!
“Yes Tony.” She said, her voice almost too kind.
"You.. You haven't?" He tried to say but Steve waved him off, choosing to hand Tony a glass of room temperature water.
Tony stuck his hands in his pockets and shrugged. He was fidgeting with something in his pocket but clearly he wasn't done talking.
He snapped his head to the other side to see the Captain, sitting on an armless chair, as if it was a throne, with a notebook in his lap. He was twirling a pencil between his fingers but his eyes were locked on Tony. Intense and drinking in every detail.
"Hah! Hah! Jesus!"
“Yes. If he was scared of me, he could have just asked me to leave, or something. But he actively tried to stop his heat.”
"Nope. Just scrambled eggs, bacon and toast." Tony answered as he forked over a huge lump into Steve's plate.
Then Happy said "Boss, the music's on." and Tony flinched.
"Tony I'm not going to hurt you or do anything to you that you haven't consented."
Instead he concentrated on the feel of Steve’s thigh pressed to his arm. All hard muscle under khaki pants, he wanted to run his hands over Steve’s leg, his chest. Touch what he had seen on the tablet sceen this morning. Not for the first or the hundredth time, he imagined Steve spreading his legs and letting Tony kneel between them, giving him permission to unbuckle his belt and… Surely Steve wouldn’t object to it if he knew Tony was inclined? Or more accurately, desperate for it? After what he had seen today, what he shouldn’t have seen, Tony thought it was pointless to torture them both like this, when they both wanted eachother.
"So can we assume that your relationship with Ms Pepper Potts was a public lie? Or did she even know you were an omega? How did she react?"
When the doors closed his knees had buckled. All he’d wanted to do was curl up in a ball and ignore this strange place and people. Ignore his failures. He hadn’t wanted to turn and see how pissed Steve was at him. He couldn’t have handled Steve’s anger too, just then.
That night Steve spent in Tony's bed. After five days of heat Tony was a little sore but touching Steve now, with all their history put into perspective, felt different. Exhilarating in an entirely foreign way. Like he was touching Steve for the first time, yet he knew his alphas body very well.
If he said yes, this would be about surrender, in a way that sex had never been for him.
"What?"
After parking the car he put a hand on Tony’s knee to stop him from getting out. Tony obediently sat back and turned to give Steve a questioning look.
Tony did that easily, searching with his foot, he found Steve was right, the mat was right in front of him and it was 4 steps length. He stopped.
“What drugs, Pepper, what are you talking about?”
"I'm not that young anymore." Tony said, just to have said something, keep the conversation going. His didn't manage to sound very conversational however.
"You don't get to judge that!" Tony protested.
“Captain. I think there’s not much you can do here. And now you’ve had your explanation. I also think you know where the door is?” Pepper asked him with a fake smile. She was usually sharp and a bit scary but not to this degree. Steve could see she was clearly on edge, worried and was lashing out.
“Nice to meet you all.” Steve said then turned to walk out the mess hall, knowing that Tony would follow.
Tony didn't look up once while the captain carried him to his room, laid Tony down in his bed. When the dom let Tony go, he finally opened his eyes. And realised he was not in his own room but he was in Steve's room.
Tony suddenly realised how intensely he didn't want to be alone tonight. Not after his admission. He felt vulnerable like he'd never felt before, raw and gutted. But he felt comforted at the same time. It was confusing.
“It’s.. It’s not right.. Not when you can’t remember..”
"You are such a little whore for it aren't you Tony?" Steve breathed, this time sounding ragged. His hand was fast on his cock now, and Tony could see how he squeezed on every down sroke and twisted a thumb around the head on every up stroke.
“What? That we were lying to you?” Steve snapped and the colonel glared at him. Let him glare all he wants, Steve thought. But just then, the colonel turned to look back at Tony, this time with a sad smile.
When Steve spoke, his voice was right behind Tony's ear, startling him. The clutter of two pennies on the floor were defeaning.
"What makes you say that?"
"Acceptable." Pepper answered as she raised her chin but Tony could see the smile she was trying to suppress.
He looked at his reflected image on the glass of the wide window, superposed onto the night time view of Manhattan. Then he straightened his stance as much as he could and squared his shoulders. He was short for an alpha. But he was well built, all compact muscle. Maybe his own image should have looked foreign to him, but it didn’t. It felt familiar. Even with his ‘alpha scowl’ and tight shoulders.
"Good boy." he said. This time the praise didn't feel as condescending. Well, it did, but that wasn't so bad.
“Alright.” Steve’s tone was light. No pressure. Then he bit the inside of his cheek because he had to ask. “Is that all you remember? Anything else?”
No.. It would get worse. He wasn’t sure how long he had but he would bet that he didn’t have more than an hour at best. It was getting harder and harder to think.
The guy hesitated for a moment then said, “Uh it may sound like a cliché, but seriously, if there’s one person you don’t want to see angry, it is Dr. Banner. Please Mr Stark. It’s not a joke. Believe me, I’m not exaggerating. You asked me why Prof. Jenkins was so scared? It was because he was on the Hellicarrier when Dr. Banner….got angry.”
"Uh. You're welcome." Tony said and with a frown then went to hang up the shirts.
A look of concern flitted over Tony’s face but it disappeared immediately and Tony stood up too.
Tony shivered, when the dom used his first name, thinking 'Here goes nothing.'
"You are beautiful. I'm looking forward to finding out how many times I can make you come in one day." Steve's voice was low, deep. Tony's cock tried harder, to no avail.
There was a moment of silence, then a different voice spoke, deeper, and obviously electronically manipulated.
“Okay.” Now he sounded wary and Pepper was giving Steve the ‘let me do the talking’ look. Steve sighed and shut up, after all, Pepper had been there for Tony for much longer than Steve had and if Tony didn’t act oddly attached to Steve, he wouldn’t even have a reason to be in the room.
Still, Steve saw him in a different light. He tried to be subtle about sniffing the air when Tony took the seat across from him while Fury explained some new system of operations combining the efforts of the Avengers and SHIELD personnel, warned Tony a couple of times about team play, complained about Thor and Steve could smell nothing but expensive cologne. Again, as usual. This time though Steve understood why Tony always put so much of it on. He was the only omega on the team. Natasha was a clear alpha, Bruce was more subtle about it. Clint was a straight up beta. And Thor, didn’t really fit in any orientation. Even most higher ups on the SHIELD command chain were either betas or alphas. Tony stood alone. And he did stand very proudly, Steve had to respect that.
“Captain, for whatever it’s worth, I think you should start telling him.. things. It seems to work.” He smiled. “And don’t worry. Your secret is safe with me Mr Stark.” Coulson left as easily as he’d walked in, Tony’s shoulders sagged as he sat down next to Steve. Steve wondered for how long Tony’s secret would be safe with Coulson. He trusted the man to keep a secret but he also trusted that Coulson would do what he thought would be best on the long run.
"If this is going where I think it's going, I'll send Fury a bouquet of roses." he said. The corner of Steve's lips lifted for a second but then the half-smile vanished.
Steve pulled his hand back, and looked away, preparing himself to refuse, no matter how much he wanted Tony, even if for a little while, and even if only to help.
When Tony whipped around, clutching at his burning butt, Rogers was looking at him with amused eyes.
Tony grudgingly sank to his knees, his eyes spitting fire at the dominant. Unexpectedly, Rogers simply grabbed Tony's head and forcefuly averted his eyes to make Tony look at his own knees. Tony stayed put, if mostly out of surprise and outrage.
“Steve! Steve!”
Steve temped down the urge to grab his finger and break his arm. A voice in his head kept telling him the colonel was probably right, no matter what Pepper said.
Tony breathed deeply and let it out slowly.
"You are so beautiful. I feel so lucky that I get to see you like this." Steve's words might have rung as sappy in another time, but he sounded dead serious and Tony was too comfortable to be offended. He opted out of bothering with a reply. He felt like it was not needed. There was no point in him voicing any stray thought.
“Tony?”
“This document legally binds Mr. Stark from having access to his inheritance as well as any income procured through the actions or policies of Stark Industries, in force as of the appointment of Obadiah Stane, Executive CEO of Stark Industries, followed by death of former CEO Howard Stark, until such time as Anthony Edward Stark marries the Alpha of his choice. In which case all possessions and artifacts owned by Stark Industries  shall pass onto the possession of the said Alpha, preventing an Omega from operating the company in any effective form.” JARVIS summarized helpfully.
“I.. I don’t. I..”
“Hey Cap.” He smiled at him widely when he spotted Steve. When the woman did also, she huffed a little and with a short goodbye left Happy’s side. Happy looked after her a little wistfully but still turned to Steve when he strode up to him.
“It’s alright Tony. You remember SHIELD? Coulson? Look, it’ll be fine.” Steve gestured to around him, but Tony didn’t raise his head. Instead he let go of Steve and kept sitting there, looking down. Then after a beat, he said in a subdued voice,
"Not very talkative any more, are you."
"I'll be down at the gym. Be there in 5 minutes. Wear what I laid out for you on your bed."
Either way, Tony was fine, he had been doing fine. He could just go to Fury and tell him that it all worked out, Steve did his job and know he'd learned his lesson. Steve wouldn't have to waste a day on him again.
Next time Steve looked up at Tony’s face, his eyes were closed. Steve dithered on the brink for a moment, not sure if he should let Tony sleep but then he decided 93 degrees was not fatally low, considering the situation. An after a while Jarvis spoke up,
Steve breathed to calm himself down. “Is this your first time?”
"Well, get ready to eat a lot of it because that might be the one thing I can cook decently."
He hadn’t had to call Rhodey since Loki. Not that type of call. So he wouldn’t call him now just because some stupid kid from the 40’s had strutted around him, showing a lot of muscle and absolutely no brains.
He was so hard and he could feel Tony’s cock straining through the layers, he pulled the omegas hips closer to ground down on the feeling and Tony moaned so expensively that Steve knew that sound would be the one thing he would strive to hear more of every day of his life.
“Show me what?” Steve asked but before he could finish a blue screen appeared in the middle of the room and text started scrolling through it. Steve walked up to it to take a closer look.
"No, really, go ahead, let's get this over with. Fury obviously sent you around to tell me the collar isn't really that bad, and you are a dom and you wore the collar so I should totally be able to, since, you know, I'm a sub. And look how well you turned out, so be more like me Stark. Am I spot on or what?" Tony crossed his arms, even knowing how helplessly defensive a move it was but unable to help himself.
"What's this? A blindfold?"
The captain took his last bite and hummed. "I do not mind at all. But I want you to try cooking a steak tomorrow."
Steve felt blood drain from his face. Tony, for the first time since his amnesia, had just called the Colonel, 'Rhodey'.
“We met when the SHIELD called me in to work on locating the gamma radiation signature the Teserract was emitting.” Banner told him as he started up the sequence on the screen in front of him.
She sighed and shook her head when she saw Steve looking at her with resolved expectation.
“How’s the first day back going?” He asked Tony after a little bit of chit chat. Tony grinned. “Awesome. I was just wondering why I never thought to eat with the agents in the mess hall before. Why do you think Steve?”
The speed of Jarvis’s answer indicated that if he’d been human he would have sighed, instead he answered as calmly as always.
Alright. I think I'm done. I wrote it all out, just smoothing out the edges and fretting over it now. There'll be a bunch of cliffhangers but no more delays. Both positive feedback and constructive critisizm are welcome. I've never written something like this before so kindly suspend your disblief. Thank you for your patience.
He didn't care that he was drooling on the bedding, he didn't care that the Cap's hands were pressing bruises into his hips, he was grabbing Tony so hard. He didn't have any room for shame or propriety, as that tongue moved further into him, massaging and opening him up, all he could focus on was the feeling that he was being assaulted in his core, there was nothing he could do about it, either to stop it or to get more of it and he was loving every second of it.
“But it’s better now right? You remember Pepper? And SHIELD?”
Steve’s smile faltered. Tony couldn’t have been any more right, Steve did think Tony was cute when he was excited, in an insufferable way. He just didn’t feel comfortable letting Tony know it.
He knew Steve didn't care, he knew Steve didn't judge him for it. He was fine here. He could stay here, cuddled for a while longer. He deserved it, after the pain he went through. He could let go.
Steve didn’t wait for them to get too far, as soon as they passed Steve, he leapt. He went for the man with the rifle first, the others dropped the suit to the ground with a heavy thunk, but still didn’t have much time as Steve easily got rid of the rest. Then he dragged the suit into the darkness of the building. He covered the tracks and prayed that he would have a little time to check on Tony before more men poured in.
Second point I want to make is that this is a BDSM and D/s fic. Which means in their relationship there will be a dominant and a submissive partner. Within the confines of Tony's safeword and limits Steve will FORCE Tony to do things. If you don't want to read a fic in which one partner says "Do it!" and the other says "No I don't wanna." And the answer is "You will do it because I say so." then maybe a D/s tagged fic is not what you are looking for. Also please note that I've already said 'within the confines of Tony's safeword and limits'.
"Did I."
Rogers shrugged. "And I have amazing control over it." Then he proceeded to root around in his pockets, pulling out the L key, the prototype and the gum pack. He tossed them onto the bed.
It was Tony’s first day in SHIELD and Steve hadn’t seen him since morning. It was making Steve antsy. Both Pepper, Happy and him had reminded Tony that he needed to remember that he was an alpha. Nothing overt, no over acting. He just needed to be his usual arrogant self.
“What can I do for you?” The man gave Steve his patented calm smile.
“Yes. I see. I’ve heard he skipped his psych appointment too. Maybe you’re right.” Then he moved to the computer and started clicking away at it.
“Captain Rogers,” the man straightened a little and Steve really hated the fact that some agents showed clear bias in how they treated Captain America compared to Tony Stark. Tony deserved every bit of respect as he did, maybe even more, “Stark was going through confidential files he has no right or authorization to look into, and we don’t need to spend time and energy babysitting an arrogant, self entitled-”
But he pulled himself together fast, not wanting to lose his chance at finding out about the amazing adventures of the Iron Man. The name still sounded a little ridiculous to him, but what Banner was talking about sounded like the coolest stuff ever.
"What did you just call me Tony?"
“Yes. Yes of course. Sorry, what time is it?”
“Shhh.. It’s alright. I don’t mind Tony. I don’t. I’m sorry I left you alone.” He started.
“Did you give him sedatives?” Steve asked and Pepper nodded.
"Expertise is different. That is why I volunteered. You also need a dominant that trusts you."
Tony looked into the dominants intense blue eyes, open and earnest. Then felt the tightness in his gut unravel. There was nothing he could do. Rogers was right.
"Stop- I SAID STOP!"
"What? Here?"
"Getting comfy. You know I never realised how much potential a gym has when it comes to fucking. You could just tie me on to this beauty," he patted the cushioned leg rests, "with that rope you got there, and fuck me until I screamed. And no one would even hear."
"You are right, I am still wearing your collar so I might as well... " Tony trailed off when Steve's eyes traveled down to look at the collar and Tony thought he saw a kind of strong emotion there for a second.
“Steve, I believe you, you don’t need to give me the details. Anyway, I know that Tony is no wilting flower. I’m just saying.”
A second and third spurt followed, Steve's hand alternating between stripping his cock and stopping. Eventually the dom sighed, letting his cock go.
“But I thought…” Then Tony trailed off and Steve had no idea what to do. He looked around to meet Coulson’s gaze and the agent was frowning.
To Tony's great delight, Steve's ears turned a bit pink, and the sweatpants weren't really designed to hide his interest. But the doms expression didn't change.
The discussion he’d had with Pepper was worrying, but being exposed to so much pheromones for so long without doing anything about it wasn’t easy for any alpha.  On his way to home all he could think about was Tony. How he had coped. How much pain he had endured to get through his heats alone, get through life alone. How strong that meant Tony was. And he had thought about Tony in heat. The images his creative brain offered did nothing to help his case of blue balls. But most disturbingly, he found himself dwelling more than was appropriate on the subject of Tony’s virginity. Surely, he couldn’t be, Tony couldn’t still be a virgin and that meant only one thing, that Colonel Rhodes had gotten there first. First, as in before Steve? Ridiculous line of thought, Steve didn’t have a snowballs chance in hell of getting into Tony’s pants. Not that he wanted to even. He had noticed that Tony was a very handsome guy but being a fellow alpha he had never considered.. Well alright, he hadn’t considered it very often, lets say.
“You remember.” He said. Steve liked Banner usually, but the man had been uncharacteristically stupid today. Of course Steve wasn’t trying to shift blame. He should have warned the scientist. Then again, none of them could have known this would happen if Tony found out about his recent past like that. All in one sitting.
“Tony! My god!”
"Oh for.. Ok, I suck at this. And you being super nice about it isn't helping. Just makes me feel like a bigger asshole."
"I'll be right over here, working out for a bit. You can take the blindfold off when you feel ready. I'll be watching you. Alright?"
“Walking in, the whole bringing the dossiers himself thing.”
Tony had gleefully skipped his appointment.
“I’m going out.”
At that Tony looked up, suddenly realizing how ridiculous he looked.
"Oh shit" he tried to say into the gag but was grateful that it was too garbled to earn him more swats.
Sooner than Tony expected though the dom was back.
There was a pause in which Tony suddenly became really self conscious about the frown on his face, reflected back at him on the mirror. Fuck but this was disturbing.
Tony nodded. It was pretty easy. He was naked but the room was warm, the floor was pleasently warm, holding pennies against the wall was kind of ridiculous but it was very easy. Not being an idiot, he got suspicious.
"I still need to go to the bathroom." Tony petulantly reminded his dom.
“Yes! Yes, of course you should be telling me! Don’t worry about it, I am Iron Man, right? Of course I have clearance. Now tell me, what happened with the guy trying to take over the world? And what sort of name is Loki? I fought some crazy villain?”
Pepper screamed when Steve slammed Rhodey to the wall.
Tony watched him eat for a moment then started chuckling himself.
Steve shook his head and took the papers from Tony before he could flip through them and come across an image of the Hulk.
“Kneel for me?”
Then the medics were swarming around the car, with two stretchers. Sighing in relief, Steve got out to talk to Coulson.
"What?!"
“But, genius!” Tony pointed to his head. “Maybe the Colonel was just slow.”
“What?”
Steve had only seconds to make a decision. Either he would get out and go sit in his home, stewing in the knowledge that Tony was trying to struggle through his own heat alone, which was clearly building again. Or he could put them both out of their misery, hold Tony down and fuck him, for as long as they both liked, until Tony’s heat was over, they were both sated in a bone deep level and there were no more misunderstandings left between them.
“Hey.” He greeted and Tony’s eyes snapped to his, giving Steve his most brilliant smile. “Steve!”
Barton held up his hands again, making himself as non-threatening as possible.
“What’s going on here?” Steve interrupted as he strode into the room, the documents he was carrying forgotten in his hand, he didn’t stop until he was standing between the angry agent and Tony. Steve vaguely recognized the guy, he didn’t usually work with the Avengers, still important enough that Steve should probably know his name. He was late 40’s with a receding hairline and a bulging stomach that showed lots of years gone by pushing papers rather than doing field work. He was also an alpha.
Tony had wanted Steve to bite him so badly, leave marks, make Tony feel that he was owned through delicious pain, he could feel his skin prickle even at the thought of it. But Steve had been gentle. He had left the tiniest marks on places that no one would see, while Tony writhed under him, not daring to beg for more when Steve had barely agreed to even touch him.
“So,” he started, “you called me capsicle once before. When we were on our way to the Hellicarrier.”
"Nope. Shutting up now."
Then without waiting for an answer he walked out of the room.
"Alright, you can wind down."
“Nor does he remember Pepper, or Stane or Happy.. But he remembers you? Pepper told me the doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with his brain. I would have thought he’d be safer out there with Captain America watching his back.”
He managed to slide in right as the doors closed. To his credit, Tony didn’t even look annoyed about it other than his eyes widening slightly. Which sort of annoyed Steve.
Tony stood still in the embrace, surprised. Steve was big, Tony wasn't the tallest man and he usually resented it a bit but now, feeling how much bigger Steve was, and how his strength was all very gentle around him, Tony felt something warm and a little painful in his lower stomach, something that left him a little bit breathless and with a lump in his throat. How ridiculous was it that he felt safe here, in this mans arms? It was just a stupid hug and Tony felt like he was as delicate as spun glass, resting in the velvet box of Steve's arms.
"You've made mistakes." Steve said, hand still petting Tony's head. "But you made amends. You're making amends, you will in the future too. There's not a single person on this planet that hasn't made mistakes. How many do you think worked as hard as you to fix those mistakes?"
"Tony. I only asked you to put the boxes in recycling. I didn't ask you to revolutionize the recycling system."
Happy’s shoulders drooped as he visibly realised that he was not only challenging Captain America, but also a friend.
For any other alpha, no matter how much cologne Tony used, it would be impossible to scent anyone like this, but Steve was different. If he concentrated hard enough…
“What.. What are the repercussions? I mean what sort of damage can they do to Tony? Quitting the drugs out of their cycle? Or going cold turkey?”
“It’s well known that you two didn’t get along very well before this incident Captain. So please understand my surprise when I received news of you driving Mr Stark home everyday. Of course, it’s very good of you to care so much about a team mate. Even one you didn’t used to like very much.”
“I did.” Tony said, and Steve was hugging him. No, carrying him.
The alpha was instantly awake and he sat up in bed.
"You remember.." He breathed out and Tony nodded, his nervous smile getting more and more strained.
Tony looked at him for a while, then nodded and bowed his head, seemingly accepting that it was all Steve was ready to reveal. Steve didn’t really trust the easy acceptance.
Steve handed Tony hot cocoa and then sat next to him. Tony held it but didn’t take a sip. Steve suspected he was sucking up the heat.
“Oh yeah?” Banks raised his chin, “With all due respect Captain, we here on the 10th floor, are all aware of Stark’s little bump to the head. I know exactly what he was doing.”
Steve sniffed. “Maybe. I’ll deal with him tomorrow. Although it’s my fault for muting Jarvis.”
Tony would of course deflect any attempt, so he promised himself that he would be very subtle about it, no pressure, just offer help in anyway he could, offer his own reassurance that he would keep Tony’s secret safe. Tell him, that Steve understood and admired him for his courage.
“Dr Bruce Banner? What the actual fuck? Does that guy make puppy eyes at the bad guys until they apologies or something? Not to dis him or anything but really, that guy could use some self confidence. He seemed really smart. Aside from not dishing to the amnesia guy of course.. But I don’t really blame him.” He looked a little embarrassed.
“Put my pups in you. It would be a good look on you.” He kissed a nipple and Tony whimpered. Wanting to hear the omega moan he bit the nipple he’d kissed while his fingers twisted in Tony’s slick to spread it. Then he found Tony’s entrance.
Then the dom was leaving the bathroom so Tony automatically rose to follow him.
"I can't Steve.." Tony tried, he locked his knees and forced his muscles to relax. There was nothing. And he was trying. It felt horrible, the pushing need to piss and being unable to.
“You’re right. Right.” Steve said and tried to drop the matter but he wasn't at his most clear at the moment and with the scent of Tony around him, trying to not think of Tony like that was a little hard.
"I love you too." Tony told him between kisses. "God how I love you.."
They sat there for a second, looking at eachother. Then Tony's  shoulders slumped a little.
“No need to get up on my behalf Mr Stark. I’m not exactly shocked.” Coulson said, then laid the dossiers on the coffee table. “May I sit?” But before either of them could answer Coulson had already perched himself on the arm of the closest couch.
“That is confidential information, only available by command of either -” JARVIS started in the end but Pepper just waved a hand.
“Fine. He’s doing fine.” Steve said, “Except, it’s been almost two weeks now and he doesn’t seem to be remembering anything.”
Steve walked in and sat down. “Thank you.”
“The craziest. It was not just you though.”
"Well. You will be." Steve smiled gently.
“Jarvis, you are sure he wasn’t kidnapped? Maybe.. Maybe mind control? Loki? Magic?”
“All we need to do is get to the border. Then the medical can take care of you.” He told Tony, he tried to look out into the road as he pulled onto it but when he couldn’t help from glancing back at Tony, Tony was nodding, clearly not really understanding but going along with whatever Steve was saying, his eyes looking large and confused. Steve couldn’t really take it.
However it was enough time to make Steve feel ready to pull out his own hair.
Tony flexed his hand in the thick wrap, focusing on the feeling of being held by rope. Then his wrist was being pulled, down further, past his thighs, forcing him to bend his body further. When a new length of the rope started to wrap around his ankle, Tony got the idea.
"Tough. Hold still. Hands at your sides." Rogers slowly undid the buttons on Tony's crisp white shirt, while Tony tried not to fidget. He knew he had a nice body but revealing the arc reactor always made him nervous. It was too intimate, too revealing, made him too vulnerable.
When Steve turned around, Tony had kicked off the shorts, and was palming himself. He was already half erect, leaning against a piece of equipment that had leg spreaders.
Then he kissed Tony on the forehead. The chastest, stupidest kiss. But it didn't feel stupid to Tony. It felt like his heart was cracking right down the middle to expose the raw, juicy innards.
Steve breathed a sigh of relief, because Tony hadn’t sounded scared or intimidated. He was impressed and intrigued.
There were phone calls involved, Jarvis would say something sometimes and Steve would go away for a while but never for more than a few minutes. Steve would wash him, feed him, fuck him, keep him warm, comfortable and satisfied. As days passed, Tony would sometimes vaguely remember that he should probably pay attention to his surroundings, make an effort to leave the bed, care about something more than having Steve touch him and fuck him. But it would pass very quickly. And anyway, he was so happy, so satisfied with life in general that he couldn’t imagine what could be wrong with staying naked in the bed for the rest of his life and have his alpha take care of him.
He pulled off his shirt first, because no one looked good with a shirt and no pants, then he pushed off the sweatpants.
"Did you know Clint Barton was once collared for a period of 6 months?" the dom asked him. Tony consciously smoothed his features.
“Damn it. Tony..”
Pepper stopped, “I don’t know Tony. But you like him now. Maybe that’s what matters?”
Tony frowned.
"Yes."
"I'm going to get dressed now, if you don't mind." He bit out, as he dried himself.
There was a very quiet sort of peace in concentrating so fully on an other person. Tony hadn't had the time yet but later when he thought on it, he'd find it surprising.
Then it was Pepper.  But with her, Steve was a little relieved that she’d called.
Steve scowled, annoyed.
He knew he sounded a little grim as he said the last part but he couldn’t help himself.
“Woah!” Tony flinched, then looked at Steve with disbelief in his eyes. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing king kong?”
Coulson shook his head.
Steve sighed. He couldn’t in good conscience sit there and watch Tony struggle alone. If Tony was starting to remember he wouldn’t want Steve to touch him anymore, but he would have to explicitly tell Steve to stay away. Making up his mind he pulled the blanketed bundle of genius, billionaire, philanthropist into his chest, letting Tony lie between his legs. Then he tentatively carded his fingers through the messy dark hair and gently pulled the omegas head onto his shoulder, exposing his throat. Slowly, measuring Tony’s reactions carefully he raised his hand to wrap it around Tony’s throat. Not constricting but restrictive. Steve hoped it wouldn’t be unwelcome and that it’d be grounding.
The sound of Tony’s door opening interrupted his thoughts and when Steve turned back, Pepper was standing there, holding the door open with an unreadable expression on her face.
“Captain, Colonel James Rhodes is in the building. He’s in the elevator. He’ll be here in a moment. Would you like me to wake up Mr Stark?”
He’d wanted to take a quick, cold shower, check on Tony, and walk back to his apartment. Tony never did things by halves and even the bathroom of the guest suite on the floor was dizzying. Still, sitting with Tony’s head in his lap all evening, he hadn’t possessed the patience to play with all the buttons and switches that adjusted water flow, temperature and pressure strength. He had pulled off his clothes, leaving them in a heap on the bathroom floor and thrown himself under the spray, the temperature set to freezing.
Steve huffed out a laugh and Tony rolled off of him to lay in the crook of Steve's arm. When Steve placed a kiss to his hair Tony felt his heart swell. Just this peace and comfort was worth everything in the world. Finally it was quiet in his head. He felt like he could deal with anything.
He carded the fingers of his free hand through Tony’s hair, gently pulling his head to rest on his knee and Tony went with it. The geniuses dark hair was soft and Steve had to relish the feeling of being able to touch finally. Tony’s eyes closed and Steve got the feeling if Tony could purr, he would. Instead he got a distinct scent of satisfaction when he discreetly smelled the air. He kept petting Tony as he started to speak.
Was this what Tony felt inside all the time?
“No Tony. Nothing like that. It’s just that.. You didn’t get along very well.”
“What do you mean?” Pepper immediatly switched to concerned over annoyed.
There was a pause. "Do you want a gag?"
But Steve did notice the smug look drop off of Tony’s face as soon as his back was turned to the photographers and Tony wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead. He couldn’t hear what they were whispering about over the noise of the crowd but suddenly Pepper leaned into Tony, looking first nervous then terrified.
"You are a terrible tease, you know that?" he said, shooting a frustrated look over his shoulder at his dom, then added challengingly, "Sir."
“No. Not for sure. But I had my suspicions. Don’t take this the wrong way Mr Stark but an alpha as loud and obnoxious as you are had to be compensating for something.”
Tony nodded vigorously. His own dick hurt, but he didn't really care about that anymore. Steve looked like a god behind the glass, perfect, delicious, unattainable... Hit every button in Tony's submissive psyche.
“He’s asleep. You must be tired then. I just made coffee. Would you like some?” Steve moved to the kitchen. He may not have liked the colonels presence in Tony’s home just then, but he would be civil.
Steve seemed to think on it for a second then reached out to hold both Tony's shoulders. He didn't really look sleepy anymore, as Tony had imagined. He didn't look as young as he did when he was asleep either. He did look like Captain America though. Intense blue eyes bore into Tony.
Of course Steve had been right to warn him, he had no right to trick the agents because he was having fun and getting info at the same time. And he had hoped maybe Steve had been a little jealous? But Steve was too down to earth for that, the good captain had only been worried about Tony’s amnesia and the young agents who were crushing on a fake alpha. Steve always was the better man.
Tony shrugged. “The guy leaves an impression.” He said and flashed Steve such a smile that Steve felt himself blush a little. Pepper rolled her eyes.
"Why don't you take a picture, it'll last longer. Plus, we don't have to wait to get to the fun parts." He said.
“Then don’t. I don’t wanna talk about it. You can go away now.” He made a shooing motion with his hands and turned to open the car door.
"Are you watching me?" Tony asked, a bit annoyed.
At the word 'heel', Tony felt a terrible laughter bubbling up his chest, then feared it might come out as tears and swallowed it down. He simply got up and walked to his new dominant, and stopped short a few steps behind him.
He needed… He needed an alpha. He needed Steve to be his alpha. At least act as his alpha.
He made the necessary phone calls, telling Coulson that they wouldn’t be coming in for the next week. What surprised Steve the most was his own reaction when Coulson asked after Tony. It was irrational and a little humiliating how angry Steve got at the agent. He knew he had to tell Coulson at least that there was a personal emergency preventing them from coming into work. Coulson was sharp enough to guess what that emergency might be, now that he knew for a fact Tony was an omega. But it felt annoying, having to inform another alpha of his own omegas heat. Because Tony was Steve’s and no one elses.
Clint said..coldly...
-"Steve..." he almost shouted
-"there's nothing to do...they're all gone.."
_"did I say or do something ?"
-"so you gave up?"...she said with a deadly voice...
he looked at him with an expression that meant start...
again everything was quiet...
-"I had to..he...He deserves to be happy"... He gives her a sad smile.
He knew this place, it was painfully familiar. he looked at his hands, they were blood soaked. He looked around and saw a figure lying on the ground, he ran to it. It was Tony, he was lying on a pool of his own blood. The arc reactor was in two pieces and there was a large, bleeding gash on his chest. His face has no color left and if it wasn’t because of the painful sound of his breathing, he would’ve thought that he is dead. He dropped to his knees and put his shaky hands on his chest, trying to stop the bleeding which was impossible. The gash was just too deep and by the look of it, he has lost a lot of blood.
(See the end of the chapter for
One second he was looking at him and the other his eyes were closed and he was about to hit the ground and he WOULD hit the ground if he hadn't caught him..he hugged him tight and bury his face onto his neck.
It was one of those bad days..his eyes were red, reminding that he had been crying and not sleeping..he looked shaken..his hair messy but no one said a thing...they were all in their own mind when the alarm went off..it was like a bomb..so sudden .."there's a space ship..coming to us .."it was Nat's assassin voice ..every one were back on the game mood, or at least were trying to..
-"about..?"
he went to the kitchen and was waiting for the coffee to be ready when he heard footsteps..he turned around and saw him..he was wearing a nice,black suit and by the look of it,he just came back from a meeting or something..his eyes were red,reminding how tired he was...
"it's okay....you're okay...I'm here..."
he felt his heart was pounding,the room was spinning..he put his hand on the table and took some shake breathes..he had to get out of this room..her words were like a punch to the face..he had spent three years to forget what he had done or at least convince himself that he had no other choice, that he did what he had to do to save bucky ...not that he was successful at any of that but what she said was..its like there was no air in the room ..he tried to calm his breathing ..
he swallowed hard... it has been a long time since he called him cap with that serious tone...
-"no...you don't know that...We don't know that..they might be alive.. somewhere..I..we gotta keep going..keep searching...." he was too unsure..begging for a way a solution anything that would bring their friends back...
-"Bruce.." client stood up and tried to calm his friend...
he looked at Tony, still lying on the cold snowy ground, bloody, breathing heavily...he wanted to go closer, help him up..ask, beg him to forgive him...God, he wanted to do that, he just couldn't..he was frozen, he couldn't move..he didn't dare get closer. He didn't have the heart to. he was shaking and he knew it wasn't because of the cold…. He was terrified.he was lost. He didn't know what to do.
-"But I... I can't destroy his life. I can't be selfish. Not this time. He deserves to be happy…He deserves it. I can't take it from him..he deserves to be happy.."He said the last part mostly to himself...He did the right thing, he chooses the best way, right?
Hearing his name, HIS name, not cap or Rogers or any other stupid nicknames that he knew that no longer were for teasing, its just hearing his name from Tony after all this not-so-short time was like a kick, a shock...
Seating there, looking at his friends' faces when half of them were gone was...well let's say he prefers to be dead..gone to ashes, instead of being here...ALONE..but like other times the cruel world had kept him alive..chose him to be the one who has to stay and lead..God, it FELT like the ice ...everything felt familiar and not in a good way...
he started punching the next punching bag when he heard footsteps. he turned around and was shocked to see HIM., nice timing Stark...that's exactly what I needed right now..damit...he thought...
-"what? no..why would I do that?" he tried to look cool and all and added a fake, silly laugh and let's be honest, he was a terrible actor...
-"it's just..." he looked at his hands trying to avoid eye contact. There was a lump in his throat and he couldn't keep it together anymore. He couldn't stop the tears that left his eye..he wanted it all to end..he couldn't do it anymore...He took a deep breath, cleared his throat and looked at her again...
A veil of white haze loomed over the bridge as Tony drove his red Cadillac through the arches of high gothic towers that reminded him of church. But even as he looked out of the window to admire the intricately-woven steel cables, it never once crossed his mind that he was about to get hitched.
“He was going to use the Infinity Spell,” Pietro said, answering the unspoken question, “to end the human race.”
“Yeah. I get that,” Tony said. He understood that Steve was coming from a good place, even if he went about it the wrong way.
He paused at the sound of Steve’s voice, and his breathing began to slow down. For a while, he buried his tearful face into Steve’s chest, enjoying a few moments of silence.
The horsemen charged with great speed, with their spears held high above their heads. One of the faster ones broke through the ranks, and came at them so quickly that Tony barely had time to blink.
Tony always read the prophecy with a healthy dose of skepticism. Yet, here, in the heart of the cave, surrounded by these elaborate carvings, Tyranaksthon felt more real than ever.
Steve’s sword glinted as he raised it to the sunlight. Riding in front of his warriors, the king ran his sword against their spears in salutation and rallied their morale with loud clinks that resounded through the fields.
Morning light filtered through the drapes to bathe Tony in its glow. Amid the strings of pearls and chains of gold neatly laid out on the bed, the dragonstones shone brightly, as they cast streaks of red, yellow, green and blue upon the high domed ceiling.
OMG THE SECOND LAST CHAPTER I CAN'T BELIEVE WE MADE IT THIS FAR!
“We can go next Saturday,” Steve murmured, nuzzling his neck apologetically.
“That’s the horn of Rex Divinus,” Thanos sneered, when he recognised the blade’s unique curvature and hue. “How dare you try to use it?”
It was an imposing tower, twice as tall as Ferrumarx, and perched on one of the tallest mountains Tony had ever seen. The only entrance into the castle was through the pair of high gates into the turret, in front of which was a wide expanse of mossy blackstone to serve as a landing pad.
Tony stiffened, pulling away. “And where is your knight?” he asked, as an unreadable look flashed across his face.
“Relax, Shellhead,” Nat said. “Not all of us can fly.”
Pierce drew a handgun, so Tony pushed a threatened councilman out of the way while Natasha disarmed the secretary, amidst panicked gasps and cries and more gunshots. Still, working together, it didn’t take long before all the STRIKE operatives were down.
Right. His heat was on its way.
Then, Nat clinked a spoon against the rim of her wine glass, drawing their friends closer so they could listen to what she had to say.
Steve leaned closer so Tony could bury his tearful face in his chest.
Tony swallowed. “Why not?” he asked.
Steve caught him just in time, and held him so tightly that Tony thought he would pass out again. But he leaned into the touch, Steve's hand on the back of his neck grounding him, and bringing him back to the present.
Steve thought, with growing horror, as he recognised the prince’s distinct silhouette against a towering inferno. Fiery arrows began raining on the barges, intent on destroying the stolen arrows so they couldn’t be used again. The barges erupted in flames.
The relentless immersion began to take its toll. He lost his focus. And he felt dizzy and light-headed.
The words pierced through the light fog that lingered around his head, and Steve looked up sharply. “The Infinity Spell?” he repeated. “I thought it was a legend.”
“It’s a delicate mission, one that requires intelligence,” Sam pointed out and as an afterthought, he added, “That rules Clint out."
There was a fair bit that was lost in translation, but he’d heard enough to cause a deep ache in his heart. All that was standing in the way of Tony’s return was the threat of Thanos, and once that was taken care of, Tony would be on his way.
“Uh- They said it was safe. I was looking for you.”
And just a few moments ago, he was asking the same of Bruce.
"What did I say?" Tony asked, seeking clarification, because he had said a few things.
The blush was back on Steve's cheeks. "The thing about following me."
Following the order specified by the spell, Steve picked the stones up and placed them inside the crucible, one at a time, recognising that behind the acquisition of each gem was a moving story of personal courage and sacrifice –
“What do you think?” he asked, and turned slowly to look at the full-grown tree behind them.
Steve put down his knife to brush away the wooden shavings from the top, satisfied with the wide-bodied design and a shorter peg. A quick twist of his fingers and the spinner was twirling on its point, in a dizzying, mesmerising dance. He counted the seconds that passed -
“Read on,” the director directed.
The dragon loved Tony and Tony loved him too. The dragon was brave and kind and charming, just like Tony was. The dragon would make Tony happy, and Steve wouldn’t get in their way. He couldn’t.
“And then what?” Tony countered, “Like you’ve just expressed, most gracefully – we’ve used the stones – and
Marrying a foreign monarch was his only chance of leaving the palace and war had always been inevitable. Thanos would find another reason to fight them for access to their land and their natural resources. It was the stones he was after and Tony had to do everything in his power to stop him.
Bucky, too, was surprised. “Natalia?” he asked, his voice breathy with disbelief, the use of her real name indicating they were acquainted.
“Clint can get his hands on the rest of the materials easily,” Bruce said, still looking at the reports, so used to their disgusting behaviour he deserved an 8th PhD. “But he still needs a power source of high energy density. Something to kickstart the cube.”
“Thor?” he asked.
Hi! I finally managed to update!
“Yes, Steve has been very kind.” He really was. He loved showering Tony with gifts, all sorts of gifts, ranging from the tiny treats in his teacup to large liberties like the workshop which his dad was probably finding out about right now.
“Who is going to evict us from your own building?”
Questions swam around in his head as he tried to make sense of what had gone wrong. The public reaction to their response to New York attack had been largely positive. Apart from a handful of cynics like Miss Everhart, people were thankful that they had been around to stop the attack. So, who could possibly want Fury dead?
He sighed in appreciation as he observed Steve descending from the hatch, not even bothering with a parachute.
Strange’s long arms seemed to close around his neck a little more tightly. “One,” he quietly said.
“Then, we move on,” she said. “My child, we have no control over life and death. We’ve never had. All we can do is love them as best as we can while they’re alive.”
and not much else, unlike this,” he said, raising his hands dramatically toward the ceiling.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s a beautiful place,” Tony said.
Tony gazed at his husband, his eyes tracing over his messy hair, the curve of his cheekbones and the set of his jaw. He took in the red-rimmed eyes, the wet lashes, the tear tracks on gaunt cheeks. He could have sworn those lines on his forehead hadn’t been there before.
Wordlessly, Steve took his hand and guided him back to the ballroom, making a beeline for Natasha who was conversing with Agent. Tony sank into the empty seat beside Natasha, still shaking from the shock as he attempted to listen to Agent persuade Steve against impulsive behaviour of any kind.
He drew his sword and pointed it at the heavens, before he swung it hard against the heartewoode tree. His chest tightened, and his ribs collapsed into his lungs, forcing the air out as he fell to the ground, limbs heavy and unable to move.
Howard smiled and pulled Tony in for a hug. Tony mirrored his smile to keep his disappointment from showing. No, he wouldn’t be hearing those words back. But Tony would comfort himself with the knowledge that they’d at least parted on good terms.
“You probably know this place better than I do. But I’ll give you a tour all the same,” Captain Rogers said as he took them further inside.
in the night sky, you can be sure that I will be thinking of you.”
As the dragonet landed gracefully beside them, Tony noticed how the dragon’s iridescent scales were still changing in colour. “You’re a drameleon. A long time ago, I had a drameleon friend too.”
Nat the first to react, kissing his forehead before placing her arms around his shoulders. Then, Steve wrapped his arms around hers. Tony couldn’t tell who was next but they were soon part of a massive group hug.
Nothing from Steve. He opened their conversation to check that he hadn’t missed anything. Tense fingers hovered over the keypad as he considered sending a note before he tapped the
and now the
wasn’t bad at all), before giving the press a soundbite, though not the kind they were expecting, growling so ferociously that everyone within a mile’s radius fell to the ground, hands over their ears.
“How’d you solve the icing problem?”
By the time all the pieces of his armour were lying neatly in a row on their dining table, Tony felt so exposed and vulnerable he might as well have been naked. He was drained, and all the fight had left his body. Shaking so badly he could barely stand, it was impossible to tell with whom he was angrier, Steve or himself.
He’d scrubbed his skin so hard in an attempt to rid himself of Killian’s scent. It was red and raw to the touch. But he also felt feverish and light-headed. Steve sensed it too and promptly got out of bed to pour Tony a glass of water.
“Yes,” Steve agreed.
“You won’t,” Tony said, confidently. “But if you catch me,” he added, biting down on his bottom lip. “You can have anything you want.”
Steve ignored the dragon’s calls, and broke into a run, going down a different set of corridors, toward the exit. And then he was flying, falling, landing all at once, crumpling into a heap beside a pile of clothes. It was just like the torn clothing he’d found outside the cave, where Tony had been unconscious and unclothed.
“Thanos resurrected them,” Clint muttered, with disgusted realisation, as the rest of the knights looked uneasily at one another.
"Oh," Tony started. "Yes, I do mean that."
“I’m fine,” he insisted.
“Clever. Bruce can find a way to grow anything he wants. It does help that plants seem to take well to our soil, even the heartewoode you're leaning against."
Steve had to remind himself, even as he strained his ears so as not to miss a word.
“I won’t,” Tony blurted.
He turned his back to him, marching away with long, purposeful strides. It’s the final blow, the twist of a bayonet. Because no alpha, not even the bravest and strongest, could stand to see their omega walking away from them, the way he was.
“Tony,” he whispered, gently shaking the distressed prince to get his attention. “The house is on fire!”
By the time Wanda was done, Tony had crumpled to a heap, having to hide his head under his wing to manage the pain. If he was exhausted, so was she, for Wanda, trembling with exertion, had to be supported by her brother.
Judging by the joyful cheers along the beach, the other petrified warriors were slowly coming back to life, revived by the tears of loving family and friends. They had expected a day of carnage and ruin and it was a nice change, not to have to clean up the blood and flesh of patriots from their shores.
“Kraken!” Clint shouted, and his scream was drowned out by the roar of the beast. Mayhem resumed as warriors hurried to their stations to free the boat from its icy moat, with the braver ones firing arrows into the monster’s mouth. They were out of their league, exhausted by their efforts to battle the monsters from the depths of the ocean - an army of leviathans, a basilisk and now, a kraken.
He lowered his repulsors, getting the brutes to lower their defences, before hitting them all with his shoulder-mounted guns.
Waking up alone was somewhat of a surprise, for he distinctly remembered falling asleep in Tony’s arms, a memory that was corroborated by the lingering scent of burnt wood, and the depressed spot on the bed, which was sadly no longer warm to the touch.
“No, Happy. Take me home.”
Clearly, he was wrong.
“Not that scared,” Steve asserted.
They had to, after all.
his true love, who was riding toward them that very moment. Tony watched the knight in shining armour bring his galloping horse to a stop, just outside the gates. The knights soft, dark hair was pulled back from his face in a loose bun, his bright eyes were shining with excitement and his voice was warm and sincere. This man was an angel, and in his presence, Tony was reminded of his own repulsiveness and shortcomings.
Thank you so much for reading this! :D
“Hello, beastie,” Steve said, before he sprang, spear in hand, toward the spot between her eyes, piercing it with a satisfying squelch.
When he looked up, the dragon was gazing at him meaningfully, as though waiting for him to connect the dots. But the dots were like stars in the night sky, with an infinite number of constellations to be mapped.
(See the end of the chapter for
“A heartewood,” Tony said, turning back to run his fingers over the impressive trunk, noting the recently-trimmed branches hanging over him. “This is a heartewoode? A flowering one?”
“Everyone’s got a superpower now,” Sam said.
“No. Stand down. Now.” Steve directed, his voice thick. It’s an order. Something that Tony tended to comply with. But not this. Not when millions of lives were at stake.
“Waiting at the entrance, for one, or both, to call for help.”
“This must be a big adjustment for you. Life here – I know it’s no bed of roses.”
“Go on then,” Steve huffed in an attempt to hide his disappointment. “Get on the wagon and meet your dragon.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony's breath hitched. Because Steve was pushing all the right buttons now. Hitting all the nails on their heads.
Tony nodded. “I’ve heard the stories. Is he quite all right now?” he asked.
“Thinks for thanking of me. As long as it’s next month. I’m working hard on being not-busy this month. You know right?” he said, reminding Clint that he was going on a vacation. With Steve. And barring any potential world-ending events, they were not to be interrupted.
As Steve moved to stand between them, Tony shouted from behind his husband, “I’m not afraid of you!”
Steve looked up in surprise and Tony couldn't help but notice how wet his face was. "You shouldn't," he argued. "I'm the worst kind of person, Tony. I'm a bully. You should stay away from me, run as far as you can."
If he were an Avenger, he’d take it up with the president. If he were an Avenger, he would -
But Obie had already taken the bait. “Oh?” the dragon said, so all Tony had to do was to reel him in.
His expression softened at the sight of Tony. “If not for Prince Anthony, and you, I would have lost the last of my family, more precious than all the riches of the world. I am in your debt. If there is the slightest chance that the mindstone will aid Prince Anthony’s recovery, we will be honoured if you accept.”
He had to keep it together. With a curt nod and a sharp turn of his head, he made his way toward Rhodey and Peter, all the while feeling their curious gazes on him.
“According to my calculations, Captain Rogers has completed combat training at the tower. He is expected to be home in approximately thirty minutes.”
“Help?” Steve asked sharply.
Because I am a very unoriginal person, there aremany references here from hmmm MCU films, Parks and Recreation and
It was late afternoon when Lord Strange entered the bedroom through a portal, with Thor and Loki behind him. Having managed to avoid the drizzle outside, the trio arrived relatively dry, albeit soaked in perspiration and blood.
“Yes, but Thanos had one stone then. This time, he had four.”
Tony leaned over to kiss his cheek. “I have to go,” he said, as Strange opened one of his portals.
Tiny specks emerged from the high gates and rapidly enlarged into roaring dragons and screeching bats. And in the midst of all that chaos – the Black Order.
Each time they entered the room, their arms were laden with gifts. That morning, Sam brought back some of Mrs Phillips’ meat pies and an assortment of cheeses from the Coulsons. Bucky had a bread basket from the Simmonses in one hand and a cheery basket of seasonal fruit from the Shaws in the other, bursting with oranges, strawberries and cherries. Together with the large bouquet of white daisies the Johnsons had sent that morning, the gifts brought some much-needed cheer to an otherwise austere home.
Tony led her to another memory, of them both signing a peace treaty, before King Maxwell left.
A gust of wind blew the sand at his face and it forced Tony to blink several times. When he looked down again, the letters had shifted.
They turned to look at each other in shock. “Stay with me,” Steve said.
“Wait, wait. Hold up. Am I hearing you right?” Rhodey interrupted while Tony was in the middle of breaking it down. “You want
“Where is his treasure?” Wanda demanded, as she paced the carpet in a panic. “We need his treasure.”
“I go wherever Mr. Stark goes,” Tony said.
Finally, he tried listing the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946...
“The blue house beside the keep, with white flowers in the garden. You’ll find it in the bedroom all the way at the back. There’s a chest under the bed. That’s where it is,” Steve said, explaining where Tony had hidden his treasure chest.
“If they arrive on time,” Steve said. “I understand that Captain Maw has plans to make landfall by daybreak.”
Tony blinked. “Who?”
“Thank you, Phil. Hello, everyone,” he greeted.
“How?”
“You heard the prince,” Steve said, as the knights got up cheerfully to see to Tony’s request and leave them alone.
“As always, Brother,” Loki said, “you are awash with keen insight.”
Because
“And this must be Prince Anthony,” Thor continued, as he turned to Tony. “We warmly welcome you to our ranks.”
By the time he had identified 1218 stones with light scratches on them from years of wear, the pain in his body was beginning to subside – indicating that the venom had run its course.
In a state of lingering shock, Tony almost forgot about Glaive, who was still charging at them, escorted by swift dragons looking ready to kill. When one of the reptiles lunged at them, with its acidic maw wide open, Steve drew his sword and sliced off its head.
“You okay?” Tony asked, as he shot Steve a look of concern, as if sensing his inner turmoil.
“Next Saturday,” Tony agreed, soothed by the scent of
He knew it now, and he wondered if Steve one day would. That stripped of all his armour and coverings, at the heart of it all, right down to the core -
Tony’s eyes grew large. What was Steve talking about? He was Captain America. He could have anyone. But he made Tony feel special. And wanted. What kind of alpha finds out his omega has been fooling around with tools only to give them a fully-equipped workshop? Steve, apparently.
“Tony?”
“What?” Tony asked when he realised everyone was staring at him.
She found out about the medallion, the suppression of his powers, and the secrets he continued to keep. “You care too much about what they think,” she said, as her frown deepened. “You can’t control their fear, only your own.”
All hopes of a quick escape were dashed when he came out to find Steve on the ground with the Winter Soldier on him. Steve, like an idiot, was lying down and just taking it.
“Please, don’t do this. We have time. We can work it out," Steve implored, his voice laced with emotion.
She reached out and touched his arm. “You’re not alone.”
Through it all, Steve kept his head down and arms folded, as he waited patiently for his commanders to return to the discussion. The chilly reception cooled the fire within, and it caused Tony’s heart to freeze and crack painfully in his chest. It had been months since that disastrous conversation and the fall out, but clearly, Steve wasn't ready to let it go.
“For what?” Tony cried, bewildered.
“L- Like this?”
Turning back to the firefighters, the weakened young man continued to speak in short bursts interspersed with heavy panting. “Smoke inhalation is a risk. Staircase - remains our best route. Gotta keep it clear – and get them out – fast,” he barely managed to choke out, before falling into Tony’s arms.
“The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims! But not the screams of the dead, of course. No, no- wounded screams, mainly whimpering.”
“Yes,” Steve told him, truthfully, because it
Water. It trickled, then gushed, into his nostrils, down his trachea. His nasal passages and throat swelled up from the constant coughing. His chest felt like it was about to burst.
He barely spoke to Captain Rogers all day. Conversation in the car was minimal and Tony’s eyes were steadfastly riveted to the changing sights outside his window. But there was no avoiding the unavoidable now.
“When Thanos broke out of hell, he found sympathy and a new home in the Kingdom of Anguisia,” Loki said, wiggling his fingers to bring back the purple dragon, positioning him right above them. “Since then, he's been a plague. He invades kingdoms, takes what he wants, wiping out populations in the process. All the invasions in the last two centuries - they were all him.”
“You are of no benefit at all.”
“Sputnik.”
Rhodey was his best friend and he could never give him up, but Tony had also learnt the value of honesty, respect and trust. Without these pillars, empires built from the hardest bricks would still crumble from within.
“I don’t know,” Peter said, as he turned around to peek at Steve from over the rocks. “I’m not sure he ever was.”
The dragon’s eyes filled with pain, which was a hysterical thought, because
“Such a sexy-looking beast,” Steve running his hands over one of Tyranakston’s carvings.
. He always purchased from large stores, so Steve couldn’t tell what he’d bought from the credit card statement. And he never bought them all at once.
Tony raised his brows, surprised by the revelation. He’d often heard about Valorian tendencies, how men of war tended to live each day like they were the last. “I didn’t think. I mean. I heard. Don’t you all…” he stammered, before trailing off in embarrassment.
“You all right?” Steve asked, as he held him under his searching gaze. “Do we need to get you more of those gems?”
Then, there were fingers in his hair and warm lips against his cheek, thumbs gently brushing those unrelenting tears from his eyes. And through his muffled sobs, came the voice, ringing soft but clear, like music to his ears –
“And what's that?” he demanded.
“Here’s your - trinket,” Tony said, placing it over Steve’s arm. Come on, we have to go.”
found me. Home is where the alien invasion started. In case you haven’t noticed, no place is safe, Steve. That’s why I built a suit of armour around myself. It’s protection.”
Then, Brock and Jack had to enter the (unworthy) elevator, where tense greetings were exchanged.
Thank you for reading! :)
“Relax,” Natasha said, squeezing Tony’s hand. “He doesn’t mean you. He’s very fond of you.”
“I didn’t know you liked engineering.”
He found Stripe alone, grazing on some grass, while his companions frolicked a distance away. It felt apt for his horse to be an outcast too, on the outside looking in. At least he was on the outside this time, instead of being confined to a life inside the palace and its courts.
“They reached an understanding,” Wanda said quietly.
“My king,” Bruce said. “You are asking a lot. We don’t trade lives. That’s not our way. You know that.”
Today, it would keep him anchored while the tempest raged.
“Ziry Gaomas daor gimogon ilva,” the young male said.
“Then, I think I have something you might want.” Steve reached into the basket and retrieved a shieldberger, gently placing the morsel into a large paw.
“The weapons company I’m supposed to liaise with no longer makes weapons,” he said, looking pointedly at Tony. “So, I've got a new job here. Depending on how it goes, I might be here a while.”
Tony felt incredible pain mixed with rage, and the emotions weren’t his own. He shuddered as Wanda's memories spilled into Tony’s head. He was shown a flower-filled raft, with her father’s dead body in the middle, a dagger impaled in his chest.
Tony swallowed painfully, remembering the last time he had seen his parents. They had been so happy, so alive. “What do I do now that they’re gone?”
Steve could feel the pain bleeding out of those words. “My heart is broken for your loss,” he offered.
He wondered if 1940s sickly Steve, who illustrated comic books for a living, had ever once considered the possibility of being an enhanced human being who read books about coding algorithms and programming language in his free time.
Maria looked timelessly beautiful as she lay at rest. A devoted mother and wife, she was a paragon of virtue, and taught Tony close to everything he knew about people and life. He stayed by her side whenever he could, keeping vigil as she slept, unable to tear his eyes away from her powdered face and décolletage.
“I did,” Steve said. “It’s coded to your print. Bracelets were a little big. Thought this was more discreet. And you never quite took it off. Not unless you were already in the workshop,” he added, looking at the ring, which was partially visible from outside the suit.
He found Steve back in their room, sitting on the edge of their bed. He was staring at something outside their window. His gaze was faraway, distant. He didn't even look up as Tony entered the room.
Compared to the tentacled beast, they were clearly shorthanded. Still, they had the bravest warriors - a hulk, a mysterious fire-snuffing dragon, a giant falcon, a master archer.
wasn’t the one that was being rejected or replaced. It was Steve. “Steve…” he said, and his voice took on a pleading tone as he reached forward in an attempt to brush the tear from the corner of his eye.
Sarah conceded defeat, accepting the outcome of this personal battle. For once a Rogers man had decided on something, be it a battle plan or life partner, they never changed their minds. “You’re a righteous king, Steve. And soon, you’ll be a loving husband.”
“She was.”
“Oh! The stones!” Tony said, in a matching deep voice. “That makes so much sense! No, not really,” he mumbled, studying the colourless gems on his fingers.
Despite the darkening evening sky, Tony could see the deep gash on Steve’s arm. “Steve, you’ve been clawed – by a dragon,” Tony said, his heart aching. “I don’t think the super warrior potion is going to work on that.”
“Uh – guys,” he interrupted. “I think Jarvis wants the pips. And Ana wants the zest. So you could, maybe, just take the parts you want? And leave me the rest for lemonade.”
“Anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they’d like to disclose? I’m open to suggestions,” Tony called out. “Because
He was fast. He was strong. He had a metal arm.
“Our men,” Steve gently corrected.
It’s a watch, with the map of the world carved on its face, its hands automatically adjusting to its geographical location to tell the local time (3.30 p.m. in Gulmira). And always the time back home (7.00 a.m. in New York City).
Brave warriors were celebrated with new titles and vast riches and in front of his beaming family, young Peter Parker recited the words of an oath he already knew by heart.
The shield glowed, even as it returned to Steve’s hand. “It’s never done this before,” Steve breathed, as his eyes went wide with wonder.
In other news, we had our baby and things have been chaotic, but so happy, at home.
The word, spoken aloud, was all it took to undo the spell. Then, the Winter Soldier unravelled, falling to his knees, trying to ground himself to a helicarrier that was falling apart as icy blue eyes melting into pools of unshed tears.
Sam looked at him quizzically. “We are outside.”
That was one way of putting it. “Ideally, what would we have done?” he asked, curious about how people in Steve's time used to go about doing things.
He spent the rest of the evening trying to do just that, but hours of stargazing made his eyes bleary with fatigue.
This doesn't count as a cliffhanger, right? Since everyone knows exactly how it ends? =p
“The prince began to glow red-hot,” Steve said, “And when he screamed, flames shot out of his own mouth, which blasted the dragon in the face.”
, with her flowing auburn mane and piercing brown eyes burning holes in his.
Steve continued his approach, unfazed. “If the crown fits, wear it. If the sword lifts – ” he said, breaking off into a run, ducking his head to avoid the jet of dragonfire from the roaring emperor’s mouth. He disappeared into a portal and reappeared on top of Thanos’ shoulder. “Wield it,” he finished, and stabbed Thanos at the back of his neck.
“Yes, husband."
“We cultivated a new breed," he said. "Well, not
They pulled him into their house, and sat him down by the fireplace to warm up. He wasn’t ready to talk and they weren’t the sort to push. So, they fed him with apple tortes, chocolate souffles and butter cake, all of which helped somewhat to
Steve held his hand, dragging him away from the bench.
Steve quickly rose to his feet, and brushed off his titles like the dirt on his leggings. “Uh -" he began awkwardly. "I suppose you’d better call me Steve.”
It was with this in mind that he drove towards the rendezvous point in downtown Brooklyn, to meet the living legend who was Steve Rogers. Over a cup of weak coffee and a slice of something, Tony would listen to his life story and find a way to reward him for bravely coming to his parents’ aid. Then, they would part and be on their merry way.
“I’ll find us one,” Coulson promised before leaving with Hill to make other arrangements.
“Yeah.”
“Here, let me show you.” Steve said, taking his right hand and placing his index finger on the largest stone in the middle of the ring.
Alarm bells rang in Tony’s head as he sprang into action. Failing to get the attention of the overwhelmed paramedics, he pulled the other man back to his feet.  “Come on. We gotta get you to the hospital.”
Tony smiled in satisfaction as his gloved hands pulled out a particularly nasty sprout of black nightshade. Stalk by stalk, he weeded out the omissions and secrets and lies that had taken root in his heart and by evening, despite the hard work, felt fresh and zesty and full of life.
Tony looked at him in concern. "And you were planning to get yourself killed?"
for the picture of our boys and the flying suit pieces. :D
“What? That’s crazy. And wrong. I don’t even get– why would– I’ve never hidden anything from anyone, anywhere. It’s none of your- you have- the nerve, the audacity. How do I know, frankly, that you’re not hiding something from me? Maybe you are. Maybe you’re trying to throw me off? Aha! Eureka! Check and mate!”
“Oh but one can learn a lot about people - from the way they ride,” Tony pointed out, looking longingly at the horses.
“And when I don’t?”
? I must have meant
Tony dived after the falling dragon, and as he did, noticed the dracanix right behind and a smaller, colourful dragonet closing in on his other side. As Tony approached the ground, he spread his wings to brake hard, but still required a few steps to come to a complete stop beside Obie's motionless body.
“Give a guy a heads-up, will you?” Tony grumbled, when he’d recovered from the surprise.
He repeated the process, over and over, until they stopped coming. And all was quiet.
“Thank goodness! I’m ravishing,” the dragon announced with a loud sigh of relief.
(See the end of the chapter for
For the rest of the evening, Steve rode the waves of shared euphoria as he felt himself being pulled into one embrace after another, listening to what felt like a never-ending stream of congratulations.
“What do they say?” Steve said. “That it's always greener where it’s watered?”
The fight continued, and Tony became more confident with each new manoeuvre he practised, but Obie steadily weakened from the blood loss. “You're good, Tony. But I am bigger, stronger and tougher in every way!” Obie roared one final time and spread his wings in a massive display of might.
Tony was exultant at finding it, making sure to shout his discovery from the rooftop. Gazing through the telescope, he could barely discern two distinct bodies.
“You know,” Pietro began. “Mortals are odd. They think order and chaos are opposites, and try to control what they don’t know. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.”
“This thing we have,” Tony said, as he gestured between them both. “Are you feeling it too or is it just me?”
, and directed the mist at a small platoon of sea serpents near the stern of their ship before circling the perimeter.
“Shall I store this on the central database?”
“And you’ve got heart, kid,” Steve said, nodding at him. It's a show of respect, and acceptance.
Steve, who'd somehow managed to recover and rise to his feet, was already charging at Thanos, sliding under the titan’s arm and turning back around to land a punch on Thanos’ gut and another on his chin. When the emperor stumbled backward with the impact, Steve grabbed his right fist.
Impact was made and tears streamed from blue eyes in a trail of vaporised ice and ash. “I’m sorry, Tony. It’s my fault. I let him fall from the train,” he said, over and over, as Tony held him through the tremors.
Steve took a long sip of his beverage, making a loud noise of appreciation, as chocolate milkshake covered his lips. “What do you mean?” he asked, before taking another long sip.
Tony bought things for their home: cushions, tablecloths, picture frames. He got himself books he’d been wanting but didn't want to ask his parents for. And because they were on Steve’s list (of pop culture things to catch up on), Tony got him videotapes of the
Bucky raised his brows. “What?” he asked.
“Okay. I won’t,” he promised.
It was happening (or not happening) again. Bruce was having issues turning into the Hulk. It seemed like being part of a big, loving family was doing
Tony shrugged. “You know, I thought Dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff. In all fairness, I was a handful. And it must be hard being a parent.”
Then he let out a deep exhale, changing his mind when he saw the crestfallen look on Tony’s face.
"Why not?" Tony asked.
“Steve,” Nat said, appearing from the copse of trees behind them. “Sam’s back. The Anguisians have crossed the River Aros and are making good on time. They’ll be at the Freedom Mounds before we know it.”
“suppressants helped- counter-effect”
Tony gasped, “You- you know.”
They sat on the beach quietly, looking gravely at the gentle waves lapping against the shore, bringing in the little boats carrying the last of their people back to land. Amidst the sea of faces, Steve could make out a familiar, bright face. Steve took a deep, uneasy breath, as he steeled himself for the hardest thing he’d ever had to do.
With bated breath, he watched Bruce removing the bandages, hearing the wonder in the healer’s voice as he informed them that Tony’s wounds had all healed, without even leaving a scar.
(See the end of the chapter for
It took them by surprise, especially Steve, who tumbled from the dragon’s shoulders onto the blackstone floor, but before he could roll out of the way, Thanos sank his dagger-like teeth into his chainmail shirt and trapped him in his massive jaws of death.
“You planning to use the virus on Fury?”
Steve held on to Bruce’s wrist. “He’s in pain,” he said. Can we – can we give him anything?” he asked.
When they cast their eyes back to earth, Tony had to squint through the ash and smoke to find the Dracarex Hylls, for their fires had finally been extinguished. All that remained of the fiery mountains that once stood between Armestria and Valoria were flattened plains covered in rich, fertile soil, which presented to them the perfect place for a new farming community.
“Nat, follow the banner down the centre. Clint, take your company right after we pass the creek. Sam, you’ve got to draw away the flyers,” Steve said, referring to the menacing dragons screeching above the army, their loud cries piercing their ears.
Strange flicked his wrist, and moved five of the six crystals in the direction of the purple dragon.  The crystals attached themselves to his talons, three on one hand and two on the other, as the Sorcerer Supreme closed his fist. “Thanos has five of the six stones. That makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands on the heartstone…”
Steve looked away again, refusing to meet his eyes. “It felt wrong. It didn’t belong to me,” he explained, as he tried to return the weapon.
I hope everyone is doing well! All the love in the world!
really old book?” Tony asked.
The battle raged on the Gladioli Fields as brave warriors put up a strong fight, even though the enemy's large numbers had forced them to break formation. They were surrounded by chaos, trapped in an all-encompassing disaster of epic proportions and all Tony could think about was —
Dread pooled in Tony’s stomach as Happy pulled out of the driveway, leaving him in front of his new home with his new husband. Tony had rehearsed his responses to 14,000,605 possible scenarios, so why did he still feel so unprepared for their first interaction as a married couple?
It was a sweet sentiment, spoken from one best friend to another, but it really ended up being the other way around, with Tony trailing behind while they made their way past the heavily-armed soldiers in the AIM compound.
“Meeting room in ten. Bring Barton. It’s just us three,” he said. “And Iron Man,” he added, after giving Tony a look. “We’re a little short-handed. You can help, right?” he asked.
Steve fought an eyeroll and waited patiently for them to finish, but they merely went on to the next verse - this time focused on his husband-to-be.
"He'd be great,” Natasha said. “I’ve seen him work. The suit is incredible. Its strength, the speed, the manoeuvrability -”
White knuckles contrasted against the dark wood as Steve gripped the arms to steady himself, even as the chair’s legs scraped noisily against the hardwood floor. Knees were brought to his chest as he hugged them tightly, so as not to sink into despair.
Tony knew. It took exactly ten words to turn a good man into a ruthless killer. But how many words did it take to turn him back to the person he was?
DUM-A, wasn’t it?” Steve pressed.
Tony thought of the physicist’s perpetual motion clock on his bedside table. He wondered if it was still there. The significance of the gift wasn't lost on him. A timepiece that never stopped ticking. A heart that never stopped beating.
Finally, Steve broke away. And told him, “I love you too.”
Drums pounded incessantly. It was the point – for the enemy to think they were under attack. The arrows came so fast and furious that the barges soon began tilting to one side.
“Yup. Let's see how long we hold up before everything goes to shit," Clint said before thanking Tony for the family suite he'd designed for his growing family. Tony waved away the thanks, just thrilled to have
Steve's face darkened. “Don’t you ever, ever, ever make me do anything like that again,” he thundered before storming out.
“Quinjet can’t do it.”
“Clearly, you don’t know our might. Our army grows so massive it shakes the ground and drinks the rivers dry. All we ask from your king, is free passage through your lands. And a simple offering - a token of your submission. We’ll take the traitor,” he said, indicating Nat.
Tony wondered. If it had been the other way around, and Rhodey had killed Steve’s parents, albeit under brainwashing, would he tell Steve? Or keep his mouth shut to protect the precious peace that hung precariously on the balance?
“No, look! Clint’s right,” Tony said.
It had been worth a shot, speaking up before forever holding his peace. What was a blow to the head compared to a lifetime of indentured servitude? He’d debated, argued, then begged. Before slamming the table and raising his voice, prompting his father to raise his hand.
. “Mr. Stark will be safe with me,” he promised, trying to assuage the captain's fears.
“No, we haven’t,” Tony agreed. “But did you really think I would leave after the war? Did you think I would leave – without you?” he asked, and the spots of pink that appeared on Steve’s cheeks was the only answer he needed.
“Well, it’s me. You’ll think of something,” Tony said.
“Fine,” Tony sighed, deciding to do as he was told, but not before giving orders of his own. “Don’t do anything stupid till I get back.”
So finally, the birthday boy was tucked snugly into his sleeping bag, with his parents lying on either side, and that was how the three of them drifted off under the evening sky.
Hi! Sorry I took so long to update! This chapter is longer than the rest so hopefully it makes up for things a little bit. I just wanted to get into Tony's headspace for a while, to outline some of his motivations for becoming Iron Man. After being kidnapped, I think being Iron Man was the only way he knew to keep himself safe. He realised he couldn't count on anyone else (not even Steve who had his own issues) to take care of him.  I hope it sort of came though. Please let me know what you think! Thank you so much!!! <3
Tony sighed. “What you did all those years ago, it wasn’t you. You didn’t have a choice.”
“Right. So, here's what's going to happen. When all this is over, and our lives aren't in imminent danger, we're going to sit down calmly and work things out. But right now, you need to get a grip on yourself. Because we need to fight our way out of here. So we can end the fight and go home."
Steve wasn’t even surprised. It was always about the dragon. That was all Tony ever seemed to talk about. “Yes? Which one?” he asked, trying not to let his irritation show.
Tony woke up shaking, his back bathed in cold sweat. For a moment, he thought he was still in the playground, stuck in a bad dream. And then, he remembered being in the cave, trapped in a nightmare. But it was too dark for the playground and too bright for the cave. And the blonde head beside him, reflecting the rising sun into his eyes, told him he was somewhere else. Hopefully on a quinjet bound for the states.
Steve shrugged, downcast. “I’m good. Thankful that the only person who doesn’t hate me right now is you.”
Bolstered by a series of successful invasions, Thanos had turned his attention back to Valoria, still convinced that the heartstone was hidden on their lands. The Black Order, comprising of the emperor’s most ferocious dragon warriors, had been raiding their lands with an alarming frequency. Recent weeks had also seen the emperor consolidating his forces, and it had impressed upon them that a full-scale attack was imminent.
Thank you to everyone who's been reading this story and for all the lovely comments last chapter. They made me so so so happy, you have no idea. This story has a few more twists and turns but I hope you will continue to enjoy it. <3
The Asgardians had used antitoxins to treat snake venom before, with varying degrees of success, so Strange and Bruce had modelled their treatment plan after theirs, with some fine adjustments for a human patient.
, he retorted, with a fond roll of his eyes.
He couldn’t bring himself to look into his husband's eyes so he settled for his jawline, now covered in a five o’ clock shadow. Steve didn’t smell angry. Sometimes, Howard didn’t smell angry. He just reeked of disappointment and sadness. But Steve didn’t smell like that either.
Flying past the scarlet dragon, Tony retaliated with
“I didn’t.”
A head of overgrown curls, adorned with a crown of gold and red rubies, came into sight. He was too far away for Steve to make out his features, but the soft hair, sharp jawline and the graceful curve of his neck made him the most beautiful person Steve had ever seen, and Steve was unable to look away from the magnetic presence who was Anthony Stark.
like to flirt,” Sam said, correcting him. “But this thing that you both do - you're like albatrosses, dancing around each other in some sort of weird courtship ritual. They mate for life, by the way."
“You seemed to like him fine.”
Steve was the only family he had now.
It brought back memories of being wrapped in blankets, the hacking coughs that hurt his lungs, fevers that wouldn’t break, nights when death was close.
“No, Steve. it’s my heat. I don’t know how…”
Tony was sure that Steve would say the words back. He already said them every day, so many times in so many ways: gifts, coffee, backrubs, hand squeezes, all the
“If I wait any longer a lot of people are going to die,” he explained. “Steve, this is my choice.”
“Mother was here,” he said, when he noticed the teacups on their table. “What did she want?”
“I’m not planning on hurting him,” Steve informed him, defensively.
“The altitude for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.”
“Cognitive recalibration,” she explained. “I hit him really hard on his head.”
“Tony, Tony, Tony. What were you thinking? Giving him the cure.
“Verily, we do,” he said.
A bitter laugh escaped. “I’m yours,” he said.
“No, of course not,” he answered, reaching the limits of his patience. “
The media rocketed out of their seats, shooting hundreds of questions at him, even though Phil had specifically asked them not to. Tony looked past them, searching, scanning- for a face at the back of the room, beaming brightly back at him. It was a smile so brilliant it eclipsed everyone and everything there. He was looking at a smile of sunrises and new beginnings, a promise that he would never be alone.
Tony listened. He led the party of warriors through a series of tight corners, where Hawkeye was perched in wait. He fired arrow upon arrow on the riders. When he turned around, the Chitauri were gone.
“Bruce?”
Steve was already by his side, holding Tony’s hand. “What’s going on?” he asked, looking desperately at Strange, who ignored his question in favour of observing Tony’s response.
“Yes.”
“Son of a bitch!” Steve cursed.
heat signatures with extreme prejudice. Do it. Now!” he ordered, as twelve injectors flew out, easily finding their targets. He used his jet boots and repulsors to his advantage, moving out of reach each time they came too close. The moment the soldiers stopped glowing, he took them out with a quick one-two of his repulsor blasts.
Pietro held the other, and together, they tried to divest him of his rings as Wanda’s red mist surrounded the emperor’s body.
“Later,” was what they agreed on.
“Ambushed in an elevator. You should have seen the other guy. Guys. Yeah. Like ten of them.”
“Oh, Colonel, shall we play? It’s okay, Steve. You don’t have to stay. I know you hate
There were still a few years before the end of Steve’s reign, and Tony’s father, should the gods will it, would rule for many more. At some point, he and Steve would need a place of their own. Tony could even see it now - Asterica, the Castle of the Stars, built in concentric circles - moat, gardens, stables, houses and an astronomy tower right in the middle, in the shape of a star.
“Oh no, Tony. Ivan and Killian are going to stay right here, with your precious king. Keep him safe and warm,” Obie said, as Ivan secured Steve’s hands with his tail and Killian blew fireballs all around his head. “Take me to this - Ty-ran-ak-sthon,” Obie spat, pressing a sharp talon against the small of Tony's back. “And no one gets hurt. Lead the way. Now.”
“Aha!” Obie said, with a smug look on his face. “But you have heard of me!”
Looking directly at him.
He squeezed his eyes shut and willed himself to stop thinking.  Dragons were solitary creatures. They didn’t need anyone. Steve was happy without him and –
Tony had barely taken a sip of cool water before long, limber arms were around his neck and as Peter contorted the rest of his body to fit around his girth, it tickled, and made him laugh. “This feels nice,” Peter purred happily, when Tony returned the hug.
“Steve, you can trust me. You don’t have to be afraid. I’m still me,” the dragon said, holding out a claw to him. “I won’t hurt you. I’d never hurt you.”
When Tony arrived at the Gladioli Fields, Steve and his knights were huddled in deep discussion under the shade of some trees.
Enchanted, Tony hadn’t noticed the dragon looming, all poised to attack. A full-grown dragon - and he never even hesitated. He was a prince, bound by duty to defend the innocent. Besides, there was no stopping ten-year old boys from charging in front of dragons, not when they believed they were just as brave as the knights in their bedtime stories.
Steve nodded at the sobering reminder. “We have a Hulk,” he said, clasping Tony's hand to reassure him. “A giant falcon and his handler. A couple of master warriors. And we have you,” he finished, with a small smile.
Fury, however, was nowhere to be found.
“Yes,” Steve said, swallowing hard.
“A purple beast swooped in. Neither bird nor airship, but a
strong suit.”
She held up Bucky’s sword in her right hand, which caused her lover to break into a smile. “Always picking up after you boys,” she sighed.
Yet, Tony’s condition was deteriorating by the day. causing Steve to fear that he might never again gaze into those brilliant brown eyes that once dazzled with shimmering flecks of gold.
Tony frowned. “Fondue is just cheese and bread. Or chocolate, if that’s more your thing.”
“Tony!” Rhodey shouted, while a shadowy figure loomed above them and blocked out the midday sun.
“Not yet,” Steve said, regretfully, for the heartewoode only bloomed under very specific conditions. "It might just happen in our lifetime. Our grounds are rich and well-watered and we get plenty of sunlight all year.”
“That’s it,” Steve said, having to raise his voice above the ruckus. “You’re crazy. My knights. The most celebrated warriors in the kingdom. And all of you are mad.”
“It was. He looked right at me.”
Tickled by the hot breath on his neck, Steve chuckled and gave him a half-hearted push, but Tony only pulled him closer and licked the side of his scruffy face. “No, no,” Steve wheezed, and continued to laugh as he escaped his embrace to race Tony across the landing pad to the locked gates that led into the castle, where they finally came to a stop.
“You have my word. Now, please get on the boat,” Tony added, and the urgency had crept into his voice as he spotted Ivan heading their way.
He was about to hack at the creature with the side of his sword, but the serpent had had enough. With an angry hiss, Captain Maw coiled his tail around him and immobilised Steve's legs and arms, working his way around his neck to squeeze the life out of his body as Steve strained against his grip.
“It’s you,” Steve answered, matter-of-factly.
Tony nodded and slashed at the magic ropes with his talons, slicing them easily into pieces. Then, he picked up the shield and held it out to Steve, who was rubbing his chafing wrists.
“Do it,” Steve commanded.
“And I said
“Tony?”
“You never said you had a dracanix!” Tony shouted excitedly, naming the species.
“Tony, Tony, Tony. You’re breaking my heart.”
“Deliver the package remotely. You don’t have to go in yourself.”
A long day that starts with a quest and ends with a confession. Oh, and there's a battle in there, somewhere. =p
“I do,” Tony assured him. “There’s something about it though. Something I can’t quite seem to put my finger on.”
T Y R A N A K S T H O N
“You don’t live with your parents anymore. I don’t think anyone but we should decide what we do in our home. So, fix whatever you want. Build whatever you like. I just want you to be happy with m- here."
“Yeah. But I’m warning you. You pull something like that on me ever again, I’ll be out of your life in a heartbeat. You understand?”
Tony studied the wedding band on his shaking hands. He was good with his hands. He’d use them to make their meals, keep their home clean. Their guests stood up, applauding. He waved, happiness out of his hands. For now. He would hold his head up and smile. Smile through his fear and his pain.
By the time he reached the end of the page, his knuckles had turned white. “I don’t understand, Director. I thought I did okay.
“How are you doing that?” Tony asked, impressed by Steve’s ability to navigate in the dark, with only a couple of lanterns to light the way. “Can barely see the back of your head.”
He rolled over, burying his face where Steve’s head had been, inhaling deeply and filling up with his mate’s scent. But it wasn’t enough. He propped himself up and tried to find his footing. His body sparked painfully in protest but he ignored it. He needed to be where Steve was. He took deep breaths to still his racing heart and then the quinjet seemed to tilt and spin around him. His vision began to get dark.
“This is the antidote working,” Bruce told him. “Once Tony’s body completes the healing process, the spasms will stop.”
“You want a little air?” Killian asked, after talking for a while.
Steve snaked his strong arms around Tony to rest at the small of his back. “He truly is - very handsome, but I’ve only got eyes for you.”
“But I don- I only cooked after we were married. I don’t even do it anymore. You know DUM-E does the cooking, right?”
a suit of armour (Mark II) hidden behind his secret door, Tony liked to have his arms around Steve’s neck. He was going to be his little jetpack, lifting him up so he could fly. They were going to be fine.
A horn rang out and floated across the ocean into their ears. It was followed by a series of different horns at different pitches, said to match the battle cries of their namesakes. Straining his ears, Steve could make out the chords of their national anthem, which heralded the arrival of the Howling Commandos and their ships – Fury’s
“Shit!” Tony clapped his hand over his mouth. “I just remembered. I was supposed to be meeting someone.”
“RPG! STEVE! RPG!” he shrieked at the screen as Hill held his arm to calm him down.
Tony watched as Steve left. Yes, he had to get changed first. Get comfortable. Fetch his belt or whatever he needed. The belt wasn’t so bad.
Tony felt the mountains trembling, shaking tender leaves from their branches. Then came the battle cry - terrible and grotesque, which made his heart stop and his blood freeze. Feet rooted to the ground, Tony saw hundreds and thousands of horsemen, covered in furs and riding like the wind. A handful of trolls and stone-giants lumbered behind them, and at times appeared to crush the riders beneath their feet.
“Sweetheart?”
Hi! Sorry for the delay! Here is chapter 7, once again beta-read by the incredible Serinah!!! <3
He spent the next 4,800 nights waiting for this moment. And this time, he wasn’t going to let him down.
is in your workshop?”
“A beautiful sentiment. But we will win, one way or another. The emperor is building a new army and we're ready for a higher form of war. You’ll fall to your knees,” he gritted out as he grabbed a fistful of Nat’s hair as he attempted to shove her to the ground, but Nat simply caught his wrist and twisted his arm behind his back.
“He’s going to be there, you know?” Hill reminded them, looking specifically at Steve, then Natasha.
“Yes, that shall help you keep a low profile.”
Crisis was averted when Tony proposed an idea that had recently occurred to him –
“He did. Told me it was your dream. And made me promise not to hold you back.”
Steve and Tony go on a vacation. Tyranaksthon makes an appearance.
“Steady your breath. Look deep into your hearts. Your will is to be tested. During the heat of battle, should you need a reason to fight, turn to the man or woman beside you. They are the
“Swooning, so soon?”
“I'd have courted you properly," Steve said slowly, "Given us to chance to know each other. For you - ah - us to be sure before asking for your hand.”
“Yes,” Steve said.
Steve let out a soft sigh, as his features relaxed into a small smile. “That’s great. I’m so glad. Tony, thank you for giving me a chance.”
So, maybe he hadn’t killed Obie. But he’d watched Obie kill himself trying to kill him.
Tony's heart stopped as he watched metal fingers wrap around Steve’s neck, squeezing mercilessly as Steve's face turned red from the strain.
Steve nodded, but the expression on his face remained unreadable. “The world stands on the brink of destruction, the tipping point between order and chaos. Your help will push us over the edge to triumph over our foes.”
“What?” Wanda muttered in disbelief, her face hard with anger, as Thanos offered Tony his hand.
“If he could do that, he could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet,” Steve concluded, before fusing his hot mouth with Tony's.
“Your one true love,” Steve echoed, and felt his mouth going dry. “It’s Tony then, isn’t it?” he asked, after a long pause, because there hadn’t been anyone else on King’s Isle that day.
Steve pulled him in, suit and all, for the embrace. “I know who you are.”
“Coffee?” Tony asked, as he reached for the coffee pot.
High above the battlefield, Clint let out an elated whoop as he flew in on Peter’s back. He drew his bow and took careful aim, before releasing his arrows at the multitude of berserkers closing in on Bruce.
I can't believe we just have two more chapters to go!!! I am mostly happy with the last two chapters, although they still need to be beta-ed and go through rounds of editing. I hope to post this all by mid-February (edit: probably later because I"m really burnt out right now, 9 February 2021)! If you're still reading this, despite my horrible update schedule, you are amazing and I love you! <3
Steve gave him a look of exasperation, so Tony took advantage of his silence to go on. “What’s the worst that could happen? Even if we don’t get along, and end up hating each other, we can always file for a divorce. As long as we stay married till after our 25th birthday, we’d be off SHIELD’s radar – forever. Just think about that.”
He wondered if the Starks had learnt of it too, because when Steve listened in again on their conversation, there was talk of a family reunion, and not a temporary one.
“Tony, Tony. Wake up. You had a nightmare. You’re okay. You’re fine. You’re safe.”
the god of stories. Please, go ahead.”
The Avengers Tower was his home anyway. It had belonged to Howard and now it belonged to him. They settled in quickly on the 93rd (highest) floor of the tower, where Tony was warmly welcomed (doted on) by the rest of the team.
“And you?” Steve asked.
A horn sounded from the middle barge, and the barges rotated, allowing the hay statues on the other side to collect their share of arrows. Then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the shower stopped. Steve held up his hand, and the drumming ceased, which allowed him to hear the anguished cries of the enemy discovering their act of deceit.
Tony's skin itched and hardened as a mysterious red substance grew over them.
“Don’t move,” Tony whispered, when he tried to twist away. “I just want to help. That okay?”
“Pretty sure that’s a
Was the dragon, content with guarding his treasure in his lair, really the villain? And was Beowulf who sought the dragon out even after he’d already ceased his attacks, truly the hero of the story?
By the time they were listening to the words, Steve’s hand had moved to the small of Tony’s back and he had pulled the omega in close, so close that Tony could feel his warm breath on his temple. Tony nuzzled Steve’s neck in response, and older man’s breath hitched.
The short, easy drive soon had him turning into an empty spot by the kerb. He noticed the smoke almost instantly, and tried not to let it bother him too much. It wasn’t unusual for the city to be covered in a layer of smog, with new factories coming up in the industrial belt, producing everything from pencils to soap.
Steve froze when it was time to say the vows and Sam had to nudge him in the ribs. Thankfully, he’d rehearsed the words so many times that he managed to recite them, once he remembered it was his turn to speak. He barely looked away from the face of his husband.
He flexed his fingers, marvelling at the fluid motions of the gold-titanium covering his hands. “You - you finished the code,” shocked and impressed at the incredible feat of engineering that Steve had pulled off. All on his own.
I want to thank everyone for their sweet words of encouragement. I think I really needed to hear that. I was torn between replying to your lovely comments and writing this chapter but I thought everyone would want to have a new chapter first. I will get to responding to the comments, I promise! :D
“No,” Steve said. “You have no army. You have no warriors. What you have are slaves - and they will fear my sword more than your whip.”
Steve found Tony beside him, looking back at him with wide eyes that shone gold in the firelight, a stark contrast to his pale face. Steve observed his mussed-up hair and crumpled clothing, unable to tell for how long Tony had sat there just watching him.
“You won,” Tony said, beaming graciously at the man who taught him to play.
His father was already waiting, looking excited and eager to give him away. He offered Tony his arm and a soft smile, both of which he gratefully accepted. Affection was a currency his dad was stingy with and over the years, Tony had learnt to be thankful for the scraps.
Or maybe not.
He lay on the ground, still damp with rain, and felt the moist grass soaking his clothes and his skin, thinking that being submerged in water and drowning in it was preferable to the prospect of living in a world without Tony Stark.
Tony tried to say something, but his heart was bursting with happiness.
“Bravo locked,” Thor reported. “Here comes the parade,” he said as a group of HYDRA pilots began firing at him.
“Bucky,” Tony whispered, as he gently shook the knight. “Where’s Steve?”
Tony’s eyes grew large. The
“Right,” Tony said. “Don’t suppose he’d deign to name his prodigal son right here. Wait, did I say
Looking at the sapling, he continued, “The other day, I found this lemon sapling sprouting right here. A stray animal must have taken it. And a new idea has taken root. Just imagine! A lemon grove on these grounds? Ana would be pleased.”
Tony reminisced about Saturday evening motorcycle rides with his arms closely wrapped around Steve’s warm body. Riding slowly, his husband had pointed out the various alleys, parking lots and diners, where he’d ever got beat up.
So, they stayed in New York, which was fine for Tony. What he needed wasn't a quick recharge. It was a new battery.
Steve looked up into a pair of pale blue eyes. “Of course, I do. War is on its way. Men are ready to lay down their lives. I’ve got no right to do any less.”
He eased himself on the carpeted floor, so he could hold his hand and get his alpha’s attention.
"Yes, if they're as pretty as you, because you're really pretty when you smile."
Tony ran his hand through his overgrown curls, sweeping his untidy bangs out of his eyes. Checking for stubble, he stroked his smooth jaw and upper lip and briefly wondered how it would feel to be kissed.
“Where’s Thor?”
"Yes?" Steve said, and gave Tony a look of alarm. "Are you not afraid of them?"
Clint raised his brow. “That sounds badass - kinda like us,” he said.
“Tony, baby, sweetheart. I adore you. You know how much I do. But right now – Right now, I need the other guy.”
He ignored the questions. “They smell amazing,” he said instead, watching her place the mini-muffins on a serving tray. “Are they all for me?”
“Slow down, Pete,” Tony cautioned, when Peter expressed a desire to leave without delay. “Thanos is still out there, biding his time. We can’t leave our allies now, not when they need us most.”
