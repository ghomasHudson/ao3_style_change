"Answer the question!", Wade demanded and there was an edge to his voice that made Peter comply immediately.
All of these words shot around Peter's head in that moment. He felt suspended in time, like days passed between each of his heartbeats. He had never seen anything like it.
The file. She had read Peter's file and then she told them. She told Tony and Steve what Peter did. That's where the anger came from, he thought. And the disappointment. They knew what he was now. That he wasn't good, that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't be.
"Well, you can join me if you're scared of leaving me by myself. ", Peter suggested and Wade didn't need to hear that twice so he sat down next to Peter.
But right now? Peter only really had to fear for his own life. And killing him didn't seem to be part of the plan for now or Gwen would've already done it.
"That's what I mean. They put you on drugs that switch off your emotions.", Wade explained. He had no way of knowing how much Peter had been aware of during his stay with SHIELD.
Even right now when his body and brain were on fire. Even when every step seemed to shake another piece of him loose until he was only a pile of broke pieces, unable to go forward, he was still there, lurking in every dark knuck and cranny of his mind.
And before Wade knew it they were looking at each other, both breathless with racing hearts, cupping each others faces like they were each other's most precious treasures.
"Oh! Yeah- but you don't- I know you weren't thinking straight- so you don't have to- if you don't want-", Wade started to stammer because he couldn't accept that this was happening. A part of him, mainly his boxes, had almost convinced him that Peter had lied, that it had just been a spur of the moment thing, that Peter didn't really feel that way about Wade.
Once again Steve thought of Bucky. Of how ashamed he was after Steve figured out the extent of abuse he went through at the hands of HYDRA. For a while he wouldn't even look Steve in the eyes. With that in mind he put down the file without opening it. This was a decision Tony had to make. For now Steve only had tell him. God... how was he supposed to tell him when he himself barely comprehended it.
Bucky spend his nights in an armchair by his bed ever since the kid took up the space. Bucky didn't sleep a lot anyways. Dealing with his nightmares got a whole of a lot harder when he was by himself.
They found the wreck several miles outside New York and seeing it with his own eyes opened up a pit in Wade's stomach, a dark hole that was always there but right now it was growing, consuming him.
"Anyways,  what was I saying? Ah, yes, we're going to stay at a motel tonight, I think you could use a full night's rest and we'll continue
It was a clear night sky tonight and he might send Wade another picture later. That's how they've been communicating this past month. Peter would send Wade little pictures of where ever he currently was with little messages attached and Wade would do the same. He had left Malibu as it seemed. He'd sent Peter pictures of cities, Peter didn't ask where he was because Wade didn't expect Peter to tell him that either.
Peter was okay according to Bucky. Or not okay. That would've been unrealistic. But he was managing. And in the pictures Bucky sent... Peter looked better and better the longer they were away. Healthier, if not necessarily happy. Tony tried to not be selfish, he was glad that his son was getting better, even if he couldn't be a part of his recovery for now.
"Is it selfish if I ask you to stay?", he then asked, his voice faint, like he hoped that Wade wouldn't hear him.
But I'm reaching ahead. Right now I want to hear your thoughts on this chapter and what YOU think will happen in these last few chapters! Tell me in the comments!
Okay, so obviously Peter knew of gay people. His father and Steve were two men in a relationship, after all. He just hadn't  known that there was a specific word for it, Peter had sort of assumed that people just dated whoever they fell in love with, unrelated to gender.
"Thats them.", he said and it was almost like he was bracing himself. Surely enough a car parked not far away and Bucky and Peter stepped out.
"Yeah.", Tony said, his voice as empty as his eyes. "Nothing good, though. " Then he laughed, an awful, ruined sound. "You can say 'I told you so', if you want.", he then stated once his awful laugh died off.
The next words sent a chill down Steve's spine and for a second he felt like he was in the ice again.
"Holy shit. I kissed Tony Stark's son. ", she stated, followed by a breathless laugh. Peter actually had to smirk at that, too, just because it was the most ridiculous part that MJ could've focused on. "Thank you, for what you did in there.", MJ then said after another moment of silence.
Peter didn't even register that he didn't recognize the person in front of him, didn't even register the weird red and black suit or the mask with the eerie white eyes. His fight or flight instinct just set in and he ripped his arms and legs out of the restraints of the chamber and grabbed the stranger, hurling him against a wall before jumping to the ceiling.
Peter looked so much younger than he was in that moment. He was, what, 19? But he looked like a child, narrow shoulders, hunched over, huge eyes that looked so fucking lost. But he also wore the exhaustion of an old man, someone who has been through way too much. It was a dichotomy that was equally fascinating and heartbreaking.
"People... always have ulterior motives...", there was an exhaustion in his eyes, it made him look so much older than he was supposed to be.
"GO AWAY!", He yelled back, his voice rougher than he expected. His eyes fell on the empty pill bottle on his nightstand that held the drugs he used to stop his own heart every night. He'd need to get new ones. Or he could just shoot himself again but that was always so messy.
"But why? I told her that I forgave her. I told her that there was nothing to forgive! ", Peter exclaimed and he seemed desperate.
"If you say so.", he said instead. The words felt weird in his mouth. Bucky gave him a nod before turning away. He hovered in the doorway, asking a silent question when he faced the others again.
"Impressive, isn't it?", Keipon smiled at Gwen before reaching out for her and placing his hands on her shoulders. "It turned out more difficult to scrape her brains out. We had to get creative with her. She's still your lovely Gwen, just with different... priorities. We just needed to shift her worldview, flip it around a little. And of course our biggest improvement, no trigger words, remote activation. This way we just had to serve her to you on a silverplatter and wait until you settled around her. ", he explained proudly.
They had undressed him and put him in paperthin scrubs. Peter was shaking all over. He wanted to claw at his arms but they put him into a straitjacket. There was a collar too but Peter wouldn't have tried to use his powers anyways. This wasn't new. This was familiar. Peter had spend 10 years of his life like this. He knew that fighting was useless. That didn't mean that he could handle this. When more agents came to take him out of his cell for his treatment he couldn't keep it together. That's when things got fuzzier. Peter could remember screaming, struggling, he could remember Lorenz' strong hand grabbing the back of his neck and dragging him along. He didn't remember the way to the labs. Peter found himself in a chair that felt all too familiar, straps holding him down and that's when he wished that he could lose time. Check out. Not go through this again. Anything but this.
Without answering the question he looked over at agent Lorenz. She seemed to take that as her cue to say her goodbyes. "Take care of yourself, Peter.",she said, a smile on her lips. Peter didn't return the sentiment. Instead he turned around and headed for the door. He didn't run, no, he just walked out and unsure what else to do, the others followed him. Tony led them to their car and Peter got in without making a fuss. It was weird. He didn't behave in the usual submissive way he sometimes exhibited when he thought that he had to follow orders. He was much more present than that. But his silence and lack of reaction was downright disturbing. In the car he didn't flinch when Wade sat down next to him, their legs pressing against each other. He didn't even aknowledge him, looking out the window instead.
It was a good movie, it really was, but Peter's mind was a little preoccupied with MJ who seemed to edge closer and closer. At some point she leaned her head against his shoulder.
"If you say so...", Peter smirked, looking down at his hands, he had long slim fingers, elegant but also jarring when you looked at how thin his wrists were in comparison. "I really don't mind, seeing your face, I mean. The mask kinda puts me on edge. Of course it's your choice if you want to keep it on. Just thought that you should know that. ", he then said, looking up at Wade again and for once the boxes were silent.
"A lot of time has passed Peter. Time where you weren't together, time where your presence couldn't make her stronger.", Wade said, as gently as possible.
Gwen didn't say anything at that for a long time. Peter wished that he cold see her face. "What happened to you, after... after they separated us?", she eventually asked and he could hear the worry in her voice.
1 pm. Peter looked up as the door swung open and Natasha Romanoff came out. She looked as perfect and deadly as always. Peter had known that he'd have to interact with her. According to Tony, Natasha had taken custody of Gwen, so anything that had to do with Gwen now had to go through Natasha first.
They hadn't told him about his death because Wade had begged them not to. Tony didn't know the full story either, didn't know how Wade managed to bargain for Peter's soul. Just that Wade made a deal with Death and that there was a price that Wade would pay. "I don't want him to know what I did to keep him alive. He'd not like it. ", Wade had said but he had promised Tony that the price of the deal had nothing to do with Peter, that Wade would never endanger him.
"I'm not like you. ", Gwen snapped before straddling Peter and punching him so hard that Peter was sure that she broke his nose. The pain was just piling on at this point, his whole body was in agony but Peter forced himself to not shut down. Gwen shouldn't have broken his nose, she was strong enough to smash his scull, she was pulling her punches.
Finally one last door was pushed open and Peter's blood froze in his veins, his mind went blank and replaced every single rational thought or emotion with absolute terror.
"Do you think Wade will ever come here.", Peter asked. That was his biggest fear for now. Everyone died eventually. His family would lead their lives and then they would join him. Everyone except for Wade. The thought of never seeing him again was painful. It was the only pain Peter still experienced.
"That's enough of that now.", Keipon snapped before quickly pulling up his smile again. He reached for Peter's throat and this time Peter didn't fight him. Keipon pressed two fingers underneath Peter's jaw, feeling for his pulse and Peter wished that he could stop the pounding of his heart just so that he wouldn't give Keipon the satisfaction.
"Not really the 40s... I miss my family, my friends, I miss who I used to be, who Steve used to be. But not the fucking time. The 40s sucked in comparison to now.", Bucky smirked, sounding more genuine this time.
He knew that the distance that Wade had put between them was hurting Peter. But he couldn't spend the night with Peter, he'd never want to go to bed but he had to and imagining falling asleep next to Peter and waking up next to Death was too jarring and imagining waking up next to Peter after a night with Death was even worse.
"Well, you don't have an ID and I'd rather not have people ask why Bucky Barnes is travelling around the country with a random kid."
purpose. He had no right to feel... whatever it was that he was feeling. Kinda empty, emptier than usual.
"Little Women, I think?", Peter replied. He barely knew anything about it, MJ had chosen it after he told her that he wasn't into horror or action, he just couldn't imagine enjoying movies like that.
"What the fu-", the man started but this time Peter cut him off. He moved entirely on instinct, years of training just activated. He took a step forward and threw out a web with a flick of his wrist. One yank and the gun flew into his hands. He turned it over in his hand and when he came at the stranger this time, it wasn't him that flinched away. There was nowhere the other man could go, though, so Peter easily grabbed a hold of him and knocked the handle of the gun against his forehead. Peter managed to contain his strength enough to not immediately smash the other man's skull but the stranger did collapse against the wall, sliding to the ground where he curled up, trying to cover his head.
Peter seemed to take pity on his attempt because he let out something that might've been a smirk. "Try to not be too jealous.", he returned, his tone slightly teasing, even if his expression was still blank.
That didn't mean that he wasn't completely overwhelmed with the situation. The first week was an absolute nightmare and Tony found himself thinking more than once '
"I now don't feel miserable just because of the presence of people that care about me.", Peter told him. Wade just kept on being amazed by Peter. He seemed more confident somehow, more at ease.
"He turned off the tracker of the jet, how did he even know how to do that?", Tony cursed. They had gathered in his workshop, trying to figure out where Peter went.
"It's okay, I'm okay. I'm good.", Peter whispered because his voice couldn't manage more. "I can be good, I can make it good for you...", he whispered into Wade's ear. "I'll be so good, just please let me be numb- please- please- I can be so good. I'll do whatever you want, you can do what you want to me. I won't complain, please- let me be numb again-"
Bucky glanced over at the two and noticed that Peter's eyes met his for a moment. He could probably hear them. Whispering was pretty useless when it came to Peter's hearing.
Peter shrugged. He didn't want to leave,  didn't even want to think about it but it was probably inevitable now. "Don't know, Bucky usually chooses-", he started to reply when Bucky suddenly busted through the doors again, calling out Peter's name. Apparently that was his thing today. "What's up?", Peter asked, worry suddenly seeping in. Bucky looked frantic.
"Yeah, sorry, need to focus, need to tell you this... You asked me if I had ever been in love and I said yes.", he went on, his speech started to slur a bit. "I ment you. ", he said and Wade thought that he misunderstood him.
As promised the living room was quite messy, with both weapons and pizza boxes spread around the whole room until it looked like the layer of an r-rated version of the teenage mutant ninja turtles. Peter didn't mind it, though. He spend so much time there that he had gotten used to Wade's chaos. Plus, it was nice to see what a space looked like when it was completely Wade's. His bedroom whenever he stayed with Peter's family had been pretty impersonal. This apartment screamed 'Wade'. The bulletholes in the walls, the record collection filled with Wham!, the Betty White poster on the wall anf the Voltron figurines on his coffee table. This place was Wade's and Peter loved it for that. That didn't mean that he wasn't bitter about Wade moving out.
"I'm sorry, I'm bored. I have no patience whatsoever.", Peter shrugged while still continuing to juggle. It wasn't a complete lie and it sounded better than 'Reality doesn't feel real and the best way to combat that feeling right now is to juggle.'
That's when his brain started to work again and he took in the situation. They were on the edge of a forest, the car was fucked, flipped on it's back, Wade was fine though, he climbed out of the wreckage like it was no problem and pulled on his mask again, running towards Peter.
Wade didn't find the answer to that question, because Peter quickly moved on, seemingly distressed by the topic of conversation.
"You can Google it, wait, that reminds me.", Bucky said before reaching into the pocket of his jacket, pulling out a STARK phone and handing it to Peter. "I got you this as well."
"I'm an ass. I'm an ass for saying this and I'm a hypocrite for not being more understanding. I know, but I'm just...so fucking desperate. I don't know what to do."
"And what sort of issues would that be?", Peter asked and Tony and Wade exchanged a look. This was something that they both had noticed before, a certain sort of behavior. It was all too familiar to Tony, he used to do the same, still sometimes did. When he would feel cornered he'd lash out just to test the waters. Check how much he could push the borders before crossing a line.
"So?", he asked and the look that Tony gave him looked so incredibly wounded that Peter almost regretted it.
"No problemo baby-boy. Just be careful with the bandages. ", Wade said while Peter continued to undress.
"I don't know.", Peter sighed, releasing the smoke. "She's pretty shaken up, but that's not a surprise. I don't know how I'm supposed to help her. Even though I can imagine it, I don't know what she went through ever since we separated, she seems different. I just...I don't want to cause her anymore pain but I don't know what the right thing to do is.", he admitted.
"You're right, you're stronger. ", Peter said, he tasted blood, was it coming out of his throat or his nose?
"See if I care." Weasel didn't pay attention to Wade's senseless mumbling. The two had been buddies for so long that none of Wade's psycho behaviour surprised Weasel anymore. He just poured him another drink and then another one and so on and so forth.
He was alive. Tony didn't dare to believe Steve's words until he saw the boy himself. He still didn't quite believe it. It hadn't sunken in yet. But as he sat in the spare bedroom that they quickly prepared for Peter and watched him sleep, watched his chest rise and fall steadily, it slowly started to become real. His son, his baby, was alive. Back in his arms.
Bucky was there. Had SHIELD taken him as well? Or were they back at HYDRA? Peter saw two Buckys. One was the Winter Soldier. Peter had forgotten this one. Now he saw him. Brutal, vicious, the perfect weapon. The other was just Bucky and he was talking to Peter but Peter couldn't hear a word. Everything
"Thank you...", that's all he got out, sounding like a fucking idiot. Who replies thank you to something like that? But what else was he supposed to say?
Wade took a deep breath and reconsidered, if he was really sure that he wanted to do this. "Maybe Gwen doesn't seem like herself because she isn't.", he the stated and judging by Peter's expression he didn't like the sound of that at all.
"Just tell him, okay? Tell him that I love him, and that I'm sorry that I never said it back- tell him- tell him I'm glad that he's my father-", his voice cracked, he seemed to gasp for air that wouldn't come, choking on his own blood.
"Noticing a pattern?", Peter asked in a teasing tone at which MJ rolled with her eyes before throwing some fries at Peter.
In the end MJ was staring at him with wide eyes, filled with horror. "You're not making this up, are you?", she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, a deep frown on her face.
He looked up at the screen with tired eyes and let out a sigh, rubbing a hand over his face. "Nick. This is my son. Work with me, I'm fucking begging you." So they had gotten that far. To Wade's surprise Fury actually calmed down, removing just a fraction of his edge.
To his surprise Peter shook his head. "I knew that you used to be HYDRA. I just didn't believe it, didn't believe that you were like me.", Peter said and Bucky knew what he ment. There was a difference between knowing something as a fact and believing in it. Bucky knew lots of things, he didn't believe in much.
Peter took a step away from the glass, his eyes still zeroed in on Natasha. He shook his head like a disappointed parent, still wearing that bitter smile that Wade hated with a passion. "You people are all the same... You can tell yourself that you're better than HYDRA all you want, I've yet to see it. "
He sat up and looked around the dark room, trying to ground himself the way Bucky had told him. To breathe, to focus on his senses.
Could guilt kill you? Could he physically come undone because of what he did? If it was possible than it was a fitting end, to be suffocated by his own regrets. For a while he just waited for the blood to rise in his throat, until he choked on it. Until it was finally over. It didn't come. He wasn't dying, not immediately. So he got up.
Bucky focused his attention on Peter again, who was closing his menu and putting it aside. "So, you're not hungry at all.", he stated sarcastically and Peter replied with a shrug.
He was surprised to find the lights on but less surprised that it was Tony who was sitting at the kitchen counter with a whole coffee pot that he held, as if it was a mug. He assumed that he might be genetically predisposed to being an insomniac. "Are you drinking straight out of the pot?", he asked with a smirk and Tony gave him a surprised look.
In the end it was neither of those, because Tony was better than Peter gave him credit for, and maybe he cared about Peter's well being, even though he didn't allow himself to believe that. Peter couldn't see Tony's face when he said it but he could hear how choked up he was. "Okay... Okay. If that's what he needs than you should do that. But you have to promise me, that you'll watch out for him, that you'll call every day, that if anything goes wrong or if there's even the slightest bit of an inkling that HYDRA is onto you, you'll tell us."
Peter softly shook his head. "No. I was awake already.", he said before slipping out of the bed. The boy then suddenly stopped and Wade could see why, he was staring at his bandaged wrist. The white bandage was soaked with red in a way it shouldn't be, considering Peter's healing abilities. "Shit...", Peter sighed before his eyes shot up to meet Wade's. God, how he hated the fear that he found in Peter's eyes. "I didn't mean to, I swear.", he quickly said, his voice already quivering slightly. Wade felt another storm approach and he really wanted to avoid that.
"Aren't you a bit young for that?", Peter asked. He didn't know how old Wade was but he seemed younger than 30. Maybe he was in his early 20s.
"Boss, the communication channel between the jets is still open. We might get a reply. ", FRIDAY suddenly alerted them.
He turned his head even though it hurt and there was a man up front, driving the car. The stranger turned his head and glanced at Peter but Peter couldn't read his expression. "You're awake. Stay with me kid, okay?"
"No, sorry. That came out the wrong way. I'm genuinely asking. I'd hate- I just don't want to be a burden. And I honestly didn't think that you were serious about the promise.", Peter replied. It was hard to get a read on him, now that he wasn't so exhausted anymore. Wade felt like he was actively trying to hide his emotions or maybe he just felt emptiness. That could be possible, too. Sometimes when things were to much he would feel empty as well. Feel nothing instead of too much.
"GET AWAY FROM ME!", he screamed before he could hold back. Wade jumped back and Peter hated himself.
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it and I'd love to hear what you think about this chapter in particular and if you have any thoughts or wishes for their relationship.
Apparently the idea of a romantic relationship seemed to stress Peter out a lot right now. The only reason that Wade could think of why that'd come up now was because of Gwen, which in turn stressed Wade out, but he wasn't about to put his own feelings above Peter's, so he tried to help as well as he could.
On the last night before they were supposed to pick Peter up again he found himself on the rooftop of Steve's apartment building. He sat by the edge and gazed at the city. Sleep wouldn't be an option tonight. His thoughts were too scattered. Spinning in his mind violently.
Steve was a man out of time and even though he had changed quite a bit since his arrival in the 21st century, his ideals where the same. Glorious and moral and unfortunately outdated. He understood the danger of secrets, but not in the same way as her.
Wade then took out one of his burner phones and tossed it into Peter's lap. Thank God he had multiple ones. Peter only crushed his main one. "You can Google your dad if you want. Don't want you meeting him completely unprepared."
"I know. I'm sorry... I couldn't sleep and I didn't want to wake you... I'm sorry. I'm not going anywhere. ", Peter told her.
The blue jeans were fine, pretty loose and only held up with a belt on Peter's narrow hips, they were cuffed at the bottom. The secondhand sneakers were okay too, comfortable, Peter wasn't sure if he ever wore shoes before.
, it hurt. "You love him.", Death said in Peter's voice and Wade felt his insides shrivel and die all over again.
Peter placed his bare feet in the water first before lowering them until the bottoms of his sweats got soaked. It didn't help that the water was pretty cold, not freezing but cold enough to make Peter shiver. Still, he clenched his teeth and pushed himself off the edge, sliding into the water until his feet  found the ground.
"One friend. Singular. And it doesn't matter now, anyways. She's dead.", he clarified and Wade's grin faded.
"Nevermind...", he mumbled before looking at the painting again. Peter was clueless when it came to art but he liked it. The colours were much more vivid then they could possibly be in real life. It was chaotic and wild and beautiful. "I like it.", Peter said, awkwardly. His people skills were never there to begin with and now they were especially rusty.
Once he woke up he never knew what it ment. It didn't mean anything, right? It was just a dream...right?
"We don't know for sure if she's HYDRA, she could've been distressed, she could've just needed to get out. Would you really put it past Peter to take the jet.", Steve wondered out loud, ever the optimist. Wade wished that it were that easy, that Peter just decided to take Gwen out for a bit but he couldn't imagine it.
"Gwen is currently located in Peter's bedroom and Peter is on the rooftop.", FRIDAY's pleasant voice replied.
"Hey, listen to me, it would be a real dick move if you didn't listen to my last words.", Peter said, his voice cracking but he dared to smile. Blood was spilling from his lips but the smile was genuine.
Peter had never kissed anyone, he had never imagined it either. Kissing MJ was nice, her lips were soft and she was gentle with him. Peter didn't feel the need to cower away or push her off, but it wasn't like in the movie's either, he didn't feel sparks fly and fireworks go off or any of the other stuff movies always talked about.  It was okay, but Peter didn't really care for it. And he had a sneaking suspicion that for once he wasn't the problem. He felt like maybe he was just kissing the wrong person because one of his first thoughts after processing that he was kissing MJ was what it'd feel like to kiss Wade instead.
He quickly placed the boy back on the bed and tucked him in. When he took a few steps back the kid was staring at him again, his eyes looked tired, the little bit of energy he had, had run out. "One more thing. You've been asleep for two days and you haven't eaten anything. Before you fall asleep again, I'd like you to eat something, if you can manage."
The point is, this simple reassurance, that Peter still thought of Wade, still cared, it got Wade off his ass. He left the bar, went home for the first time in months, started to take on jobs again, met up with Domino, tried to live his life like he had before.
"Fake IDs.", Bucky replied simply. Peter inspected them for a moment, reading the writing on them, looking at his and Bucky's picture.
"I can't, I'm grabbing lunch with Peter today.", Wade stated, not taking her hand and searching for his phone instead. In that moment his phone chimed from where it was hidden underneath his blankets and Dom got to it first, unlocking it and reading whatever message he got.
"Oh god, what have I done?", she whispered before a horrified sob escaped her. She started to fiddle at his collar, there was keypad for a code and for a moment he thought that she might know it. But whatever she did, it wouldn't come off.
"Fuck... Should've seen this coming.", Wade sighed, rubbing his hand over his masked face. "I guess you deserve to know but... it was quite the feat to even get him here. He's- he's really scared of getting rejected by you and I think he might be trying to get ahead of that. Can't be disappointed if you don't expect anything. ", the other male explained.
To hear that he was making progress was a small concolation but Wade clung to it. After their visit to the headquarters they scattered. Steve and Tony went back to Steve's apartment. Bucky and Wade both went their separate ways. Wade didn't care how the other's were spending their days, he focused mostly on drowning out the voices in his head.
"Run away? Hide in a remote cabin somewhere in Siberia where no one can hurt you. ", Wade replied and he knew that it wouldn't have worked. A part of him wished that he had just broken Peter out, the minute he was taken. But Bucky had been right. They would've been on the run and Wade didn't know how long Peter could've handled that.
Tony raised his eyebrows at the blunt statement. "That's not what I asked.", Tony replied, trying to maintain a calm demeanor. "And for the record, that's not what I thought either. "
"What's that even supposed to mean-?", Tony just snapped when he heard a voice speak up from behind him.
"Well, I'm already dead, my day can't get much shittier. ", Peter shrugged. He felt a weird sense of detachment that he couldn't yet place his finger on, like something wasn't quite right,  like he was missing something.
In the beginning it was all about patience. Luckily Bucky had that down. He had spend countless nights next to Steve's bed, making sure that he was still breathing. It was a bit like that. At first Kid slept a lot, or maybe he pretended to sleep. Bucky tried to get him to eat whenever he was awake. He quickly found that he had to stay present, or else Kid just wouldn't eat the food, even if it was right in front of him. Bucky asked why he did that.
Bucky didn't mean to go off on Wade, this wasn't his fault and if he was honest with himself, all that Bucky wanted to do was break Peter out immediately and hide him somewhere neither SHIELD nor HYDRA could find him. But he knew that he'd only move Peter from one prison to another. That it wasn't of any use, not really, not if there were any other options. Wade deflated like a ballon, all the anger fading from his face, making way for misery. "I just... I can't bear to think of him all by himself.", his voice was barely above a whisper and it broke Bucky's heart, apparently there was still something left to break.
Tony didn't know what to think of this Deadpool guy. On the one hand he had the feeling that he wasn't taking this seriously enough. His mood was too upbeat, he cracked jokes and stuff. On the other hand he rescued Tony's son,  brought him home,  and genuinely seemed to care about him.
He had already woken up in that weird mood. That tiredness that no amount of sleep could relieve. It clung to him, dragged him down, made the simplest tasks unmanageable. Peter leaned his head against the window and watched the scenery pass by while his mind ran on empty.
Wade couldn't shut up, though. He never could. And especially not now. Not when Peter was dead, and he told Wade that he loved him, and Wade didn't... didn't get to say it back. Peter died not knowing how much Wade loved him. Peter
"Since when do you smoke?", Peter didn't mean to ask. The words just sort of tumbled out of his mouth.
"Wade!", Peter groaned but he was still smiling so Wade gave him a shrug before pretending to take out another key that he used to open his lips with.
"I don't know! Why else would she shut me out for months?! Maybe it's something that HYDRA did to her or maybe she's just now coming to her senses and realizing that she hates me for ripping her apart in the first place. ", he snapped, turning around to face his father again. He was met by the exact look that he despised so much. Concern and pity.
He was fine, though. The days were manageable. The nights were the issue. Faking it became a hell of a lot harder when he was asleep. The better his days went the worse his nights started to become.
"Something's on your mind, what is it?", he asked and it almost sounded like in order. Out of all the ways that he had changed, this one was a little startling. Peter wasn't meek, he didn't hold back. Bucky didn't know if it was because he wasn't afraid anymore or if he just didn't care about the consequences and what might happen to him. That's why he couldn't tell, if it was a good or a bad change.
Wade was just about to say something, probably something morbid yet amusing but then Peter sat up and looked at Wade. His brown eyes looked black in the low light and one of the corners of his mouth was still quirked up into a crooked smile, another tear rolled down his cheek. "Are you going to kill me?", he didn't sound scared, just curious, which wasn't good.
Then the door to the bathroom opened, hot steam streaming out. Peter leaned against the doorway, dressed in a large T-shirt that probably belonged to Bucky, his hair wet, his cheeks rosy and damp. "You're awake.", he pointed out, stepping in and throwing himself onto the bed.
Tony understood, seemed to see how shameful this all was for Peter. He slowly got up and walked over to the door before turning around once more. "I'll be in the kitchen. Come out whenever you feel ready, don't rush yourself. "
"Did you- did you make a gay joke?", Wade asked with a breathless laugh and Peter grinned back at him.
Wade raised his eyebrows in surprise. "That's coming outta your body? Are you that excited to see me?"
"I don't really expect to live that long.", Peter shrugged before realizing how crazy he probably just made himself sound. Not half as mental as he actually was but that didn't mean that he wanted people to know about that. "Shit. Sorry. That was a fucked up thing to say.", he sighed, covering his face with his free hand.
Peter wasn't surprised by that comparison. He was more surprised that Tony actually said it. Positively surprised. He wasn't used to him being so direct with him. "If that's the case I think I owe you an apology.",he smirked, he didn't mean for it to sound so bitter.
"Okay, maybe I sort of did, now shut up!", he admitted reluctantly. When he looked up again Bucky had shut his mouth but there was a glint in his eyes.
A tiny noise, nothing that a normal person would pay any attention to or even pick up but Peter knew that sound. He knew exactly what a gun sounded like.
"Are you sure?", a voice asked and Wade didn't want to look up because he knew what he'd see. But Death wouldn't have it, so she lifted his head up until he came face to face with Peter, or rather, Peter's face. It wasn't him, Wade knew that. Because Death always made things perfect, too perfect. This Peter was healthy, he didn't look like a ghost, his eyes weren't rimmed with red and he was smiling, unbothered. None of that was his Peter. He was lacking Peter's edges, the pain that shaped him into the person Wade knew, the person he loved. Seeing him still hurt,
Wade couldn't argue with that logic. Like him, Death couldn't die, she wasn't alive. And he only ever met her on her territory, where she made the rules, he couldn't do anything to her. "Then I'll beg.", he said.
Gaunt, sickly looking, dull eyes, almost cadaverous. It was a huge contrast to the fact that the man, or boy, was wearing a bright colored Hawaiian shirt.
"Yeah, but you'll figure it out.", Wade said, though Tony wasn't sure how convincing he was. Wade clapped Tony on the back before following Peter out, leaving Tony by himself again.
"It was the right thing to do. But I'm glad to be back. If we stayed away longer, Bucky would've probably dragged me to every single national park in his pursuit to show me how beautiful the world is. ", Peter continued to tell him before stopping and looking down at the floor for a second, sharing a quiet chuckled with himself before saying this: "Like... no... don't kill yourself... the world's too sexy...haha."
Peter was only listening with one ear as he was going through the clothes he packed. Most were just black jeans, hoodies and shirts, a flannel or two, but there were two items that stuck out like a sore thumb.
They once more turned silent, their conversation had reached a dead end and now they needed to find a way to dig their way out of the weird whole they had fallen into.
"You got your ID?", Bucky asked and Peter tapped the pocket of his jacket where he had stashed his wallet. Bucky got him both of those. He bought the wallet in Texas so that Peter had something to stash his ID in and the Jacket in Oregon when Peter had been cold. The jacket was made of navy blue denim with a white wool lining. It was a bit big on Peter but he loved it none the less, barely taking it off anymore.
He woke up from time to time, but not really. Unseeing eyes and slurred words, whimpers, pleading. Whenever Bucky listened to the boy begging for his life, or begging for his death, he wished that he'd just sleep.
Peter didn't look as relieved as Wade had expected. Wade couldn't really read how he was feeling at all. It was almost like from one second to another Peter had pulled up a massive wall between them. His face was a neutral mask, his eyes empty and silent, not giving away anything. "Great. Then you can leave now." His tone was so devoid of emotion that it almost sent a shiver down Wade's spine.
"She was...more herself yesterday. But today, no, not at all. And I get it, she's traumatized and processing or she's in shock or whatever those fancy words are that you all throw around when you think I can't hear but... I've seen her in pain, I've seen her at the bottom, it wasn't like this.", Peter replied, sounding tired.
Tony observed him for a moment, chewing on the nail of his thumb. He was thinking about saying something. At least that's what it seemed like. "Don't take this the wrong way, but I sort of thought that you were into Wade.", he finally confessed.
"What did she do to you?", Peter whispered and Wade could feel Peter's thumb brush against his cheek.
He forced his body to relax and stop shaking. "Sorry. I'll stop.", He mumbled before looking out the window again.
He could do this. He could behave. He could do whatever Tony wanted and get better. He could be good.
He didn't know how long he had been here, time didn't feel real in the afterlife, the clock on the wall didn't even have pointers.
"Nothing I didn't experience myself. As you said, recognition.", Bucky shrugged. Peter didn't say anything for a while, he just stared, expression turning unreadable.
He heard a soft knock on the door and quickly dropped his arm. "Peter, I'll hand in the clothes, if you don't mind. I promise I won't look.",Wade announce and Peter swallowed.
Besides, he found it motivating to imagine a time when Tony and Steve and, to some extent, Wade didn't look at him like this anymore. Like this bridle thing, this fragile construct of pain, fear and trauma.
"Grand canyon. I thought you might like it there. I know I always wanted to see it, even back in the 40s but we couldn't afford it. During the war Steve always said he'd take me one day.", Bucky explained and he couldn't help but to crack a hesitant smile. He saw himself and Steve in some bar somewhere in Europe, he couldn't remember where it was, only that they were on a leave, the last one Bucky got, the last one for the both of them. But they didn't know that yet. Didn't know how little time they had left and they made plans. They were like children, naive and hopeful.
"It's called a promise for a reason.", Wade commented. Peter glanced over at him and for a second Wade thought he'd protest. He didn't though, Peter just stared at him. "Unless you want me to leave...", Wade said slowly and Peter diverted his eyes.
Also, as always, I hope you enjoy this chapter, the next one's going to be more irondad focused again.
"I want you. I want you to stop avoiding me. You'll come back, every night you'll cone here and you'll be with me and you won't fight me, as long as you do that he lives.", Death said, looking up at him, now there was something new in her eyes, a fire, like she was challenging him.
"Please, I can't- you can't just take away everyone I love and expect me to live on. You cave just take good people that suffered all their life and then kill them! That's not good story telling!"
Gwen glanced at the other men in the room, uncertain, before turning to Peter again. "Can you come?", she asked quietly.
MJ's expression softened at that and she gave in which Peter was thankful for. He really didn't want to make her mad, or anyone for that matter. "Fine, you dumbass.", she agreed but she smiled so Peter could relax a little.
"Oh...sorry... if you need me to leave-", he stammered but MJ cut him off before he could ramble on even more.
If he hadn't spend several days face to face with him, Wade would think that it had something to do with his mask being off. Then again, maybe Peter was embarrassed by him.
"Only for like five minutes. I almost had a panic attack and then I got out. I didn't, though, so I guess that's a plus. ", Peter shrugged again before making his way to his suitcase to get himself some dry clothes to switch into. He picked up another pair of sweats and a shirt before turning to go to the bathroom. But then he noticed that Bucky was still looking at him and he was smiling. "What are you smiling at?", he asked him. Bucky gave him another amused look before shrugging.
"Yeah, I'm good, I'm fine.", He said too quickly and he knew that she noticed it, too but decided to not press Peter about it. Not immediately at least.
"Peter!", Tony groaned, burying his face in his hands. Of course Peter would think that, even if there was absolutely no reason for it.
"I didn't survive the war, remember?", Bucky replied, a sad smile pulling at his lips. When he looked over at Peter he expected the boy to not face him, to stare out the window again. He wasn't prepared to have Peter's full attention. His huge dark eyes staring right back at Bucky. They weren't empty or cold. They were... understanding. And
Peter was in a car, it looked a lot like the one Bucky drove during their road trip, then he blinked and now it looked like Wade's.
Peter describes how the the withdrawal feels to him. He craves the drugs and tries to convince Wade to get them for him. Wade rejects him and Peter freaks out before losing time. Once he's conscious again he thinks about killing himself before moving to the bathroom where he uses a pair of scissors to harm himself. Wade comes in before Peter can finish and takes the scissors from him. Peter passes out.
Wade quickly pushed the thought aside. "I don't think so...", Peter confessed, smiling. He then closed his eyes, took a deep breath and looked up at the sky again. "I actually think that I'm officially losing my mind completely. " Then he chuckled again, like it was the funniest shit on earth. "It's about damn time!"
"That Natasha upset you and that you ran away." Peter barked out a laugh, a bitter one. Then he wrapped his arms around his torso, held himself tightly like he might come apart any second.
Also, I hope you enjoy this awful awful chapter, I promise it gets a bit better from now on. No magical recovery, that's too easy and unrealistic, but a bit more fluff here and there. As always, I'd really appreciate a comment, I love reading them!
"Or maybe because she didn't escape on her own, or didn't escape at all.", Wade said carefully and now Peter just looked hurt. God, this was getting worse and worse.
Fury didn't meet them at SHIELD. It was some random agent that led them to one of those barren rooms that looked like they're made for police questionings. Tony took in the room. Grey walls, two doors, a table, five chairs, four on one side, one on the other. All bolted into the ground. There was a two way mirror. SHIELD agents would be watching them. All that Tony saw right now was his own exhausted face. He took in his bloodshot eyes for a moment before turning his back on the reflection. "Please take a seat. Peter will arrive in a minute.", the agent that led them here ordered. Tony mirrored the others and they all took a seat on one side of the table. Surely enough a minute later, Tony counted the seconds, the other door opened.
Okay, so trigger warning because Peter's suicide attempt is discussed very briefly in here but without any detail.
"They will all join you in time. ", she said but Peter knew that she was lying. Wade couldn't die, he had tried. Peter would never see him again.
"FRIDAY, do we have any footage of them before they took off?", Tony asked and a video was pulled up onto the screen, taken in the hallway before Peter's bedroom by the looks of it. It showed Peter and Gwen, facing each other, Gwen held a gun in her hand, aiming it at her own temple.
Several hours had passed since he entered the room and the Superdads were probably desperate for an update.
how Tony flinched beside him at the sight of his face. Wade focused all his attention on Peter instead. "Peter, look at me. You're okay. You aren't with HYDRA anymore, remember?", he pleaded with Peter and slowly his eyes cleared up and focused on Wade.
"Buckle up, baby boy, Imma teach you.", Wade laughed and Steve could see Peter crack a tiny smile as well before returning his attention to Tony.
"Needless to say, if you hurt him you'll wish that you could die.", Steve stated, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Sorry for dying... again. I was just really fucking inspired in a different way. If you wanna know what I mean check out my tumblr https://winter-oswin.tumblr.com/
"Yes. In case one gets stolen! Like now. Now move!", Tony returned before they separated in the hallway.
"FRIDAY? Call Harley.", he ordered and the AI system, that seemed to be running this house, did as it was told. Harley turned out to be a boy, a little younger that Peter and Tony and him seemed familiar.
"But they don't know that you have that so no pressure.", Bucky told him gently, hoping that it would sooth whatever anxiety was building up in Peter's mind.
"I think I'll sleep now, if that's okay.", Peter then said, laying his head against the window again. It was the middle of the day and super bright outside but Bucky got it.
He led her back to the kitchen. Wade was currently the only one there, eating waffles that were, judging by the smell, freshly made.
Peter didn't pull away, though. He just stared Wade down and then his eyes lowered to Wade's lips, just for a split second and this couldn't be real, it couldn't be true. Peter was leaning in and Wade was on fire.
It was hilarious, their baffled expressions, Wade enjoyed every second of it. There was also a weird sense of pride that felt entirely misplaced. After all, he didn't really contribute anything to how Peter was but he still felt like he knew something that the two Avengers didn't. It was a foolish and childish thought and his boxes quickly shot him down.
Ever since they got to Bruce' lab the boy was trembling uncontrollably and when Bruce took his samples his breathing got so quick that Bruce asked, if he should stop. But Peter just shook his head frantically, his eyes clenched shut, and told him to get it over with.
"Okay...how about I run you a bath and then you can still decide if you want to do it?", Wade suggested. Peter gave him a shaky nod, not trusting in his ability to speak right now.
Wade pushed the voice aside. This wasn't like Peter which ment... "Shit!", Wade cursed under his breath. He had been right, it was Gwen,
"Yeah, sure you did, who'd you fall for, Black Widow?",Weasel smirked and Wade couldn't help but to gag. Black fucking Widow, his absolutely least favorite Avengers.
Okay, this one's a doozy. Not gonna lie, it's dark. There is a lot of talk about death, there is mildly graphic selfharm and torture. I marked it with this **
Wade reached out and placed a gentle hand on Peter's shoulder, or he tried to. Peter flinched away and Wade pulled his hand back immediately. "That. ", Peter breathed out, his voice shaky, eyes downcast. "Touch. I-I don't always- Can't stand it sometimes.", he stammered. He looked up, his eyes shooting from Tony to Wade and back. They were wide, frantic, terrified of their reaction.
The boxes went on and on and while Wade knew that there was a good chance that they were right, that Peter would never forgive him, he clung to the hope that it were just the drugs. That they were still okay, or that they could be one day.
He looked up with a raised eyebrow. God, the kid looked nervous. "Uhh, sorry sir, but... are you being kidnapped? Should I call the cops?", he whispered carefully and Peter almost smirked. He had to look quite worrying with his sickly appearance, the scrubs and his bare feet.
"Sure, come on Petey-Pie. Gonna build you sand castle in the sand like Robin Sparkles." With that he led him off and Tony turned back to face Natasha.
Peter didn't react, he observed Tony, cocking his head to one side slightly. His cold detached look gave Tony the creeps. What had they done to him.
"I don't know what good cornering him right now would do but I'd ask Bucky to be sure. He seems to be the only one of us who has the slightest idea how to handle this. ", Tony replied.
"You good, Peter?", Wade asked, trying to ignore how tight his throat felt all of a sudden. Peter nodded slowly, mechanically, before he seemed to snap out of it. Again, a slight headshake, then his eyes met Wade's.
"I could never.", Peter chuckled before pulling out the file and flipping it open. His expression darkened automatically as he started to read through it. Wade was about to say that maybe reading that wasn't the best idea when Peter spoke up again.
"I never agreed to any of this! Do you think I want to be this way?! No! But nobody ever asks me!". Every word was like a punch to Wade's gut. They tightened the vice on Wade's heart until he wasn't sure if it was still there. It had to be or he wouldn't be alive, even if he felt like dying.
"Is that all?", Peter then asked and he didn't sound like himself at all. His voice was rough, cracking, again, an indication for screaming, for panic that he had endured. But the tone of the voice was detached, bored. It was like a punch to the gut.
"Okay.", Bucky nodded, even though Peter didn't face him. He ran through options in his mind, his first idea was to take Peter to the grand canyon. It's where Steve had taken Bucky once he was well enough. It had been his dream to see the canyon ever since he was little and Steve knew that. They could sleep in remote motels, go out a night. Bucky thought that Peter might like that, hoped that Peter still had the capacity to find joy in those things. "I got you some things, by the way.", Bucky announced, pulling a package out of the glove-compartment and handing it to Peter. Peter finally diverted his eyes from the window and focused them onto the package in his hands. He ripped off the newspaper that Bucky used to wrap it. Two cards slid out into his lap.
Wade had to agree with his boxes on this one. He was being damn pathetic. Once he got back to New York he got enough of a handle on himself to not sob as soon as he collapsed on a stool in Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children. "Didn't see you around lately. Where have you been.",Weasel asked as he poured a shot of Vodka.
"Not really. For me the withdrawal had no physical side effects at all. It was purely the psychological torment.", Bucky explained before heading for his bedroom to put his stuff away.
"I get it. I've had... a weird relationship with Death for years now.", Wade admitted and Peter raised his eyebrows curiously.
"What?! Why?", Wade asked at first before it dawned on him. Peter wouldn't just leave on his own. Not when he was well. Sure, he had ran in the past but those had been moments of emotional turmoil for him.
"I don't know. I never thought of it before. Maybe I am.", he stammered before quickly picking up his clothes and heading for the bathroom. Apparently he was done with the topic.
Wade was the first one that dared to speak. "Peter.", he only whispered. No reaction. Peter made no indication that he heard them, or that he was even remotely aware of what was happening around him.
-", his whimpering turned into gasps and choked off sobs and Wade wanted to rip apart everyone that contributed to this.
What happened next Tony wasn't exactly sure. Maybe it was because he still wasn't eating enough, or maybe the lack of sleep (according to FRIDAY Peter slept up to 3 hours on a good night) or maybe the general emotional exhaustion that seemed to be Peter's primary mood, but he slipped, or tripped or something.
"HE ISN'T SOME HYDRA GOON! HE'S MY SON!", he yelled at her but Natasha didn't even flinch. Noise wasn't scary and Tony couldn't hurt her, not physically at least.
"Lovely, strong and way too good for me.", Wade shrugged, hoping that Peter would get it, that he'd somehow know.
The guards that had held him in place for so long let go of him, following Keipon to the other door across from Peter, probably escorting him to safety. Peter only now realized that they had been effectively, holding him up. Without their support he felt like he was moments away from collapsing. A look down to his clothes told him that they were soaked in blood. He might not even need Gwen to kill him, she might've already done the job.
"So are you on the run from HYDRA, is that why you're traveling with Bucky fucking Barnes. ", she then asked, as casually as if they were talking about a movie.
"On purpose. That's the catch. He might be harmless in the right environment but he has the same training as Barnes. He's a loose cannon and I simply can't let you risk the safety of innocent people for his sake."
His throat grew tight at the thought of being alone with Steve and Tony. He knew how irrational and maybe even insulting that was but he couldn't help it. He was terrified.
Two agents stepped out first, looking like clones in their suits. Another agent walked behind them and that's when Tony saw Peter. He was led forward by the third agent and Tony's stomach twisted in his gut.
"Nah, I think this is one of those vital parenting moments.", he said before turning around and making his way to the roof. As promised Peter was sitting up there, his feet dangling off the edge, a pair of sunglasses on his nose, a cigarette between his lips and a scowl on his face.
Tony smiled, a sorrowful kind of smile, a mirror image of Peter. "I'm sure she'd disagree.", Tony said and Peter new he was right because he knew that Gwen loved him as much as he loved her. "And you know what they say, if she really was that great, takes one to know one."
Tony believed him, and as much as he hated lying to Peter, he didn't want to put anymore guilt on his son. That left them with one more problem.
Death melted against his touch and looked up at him, they were so close that Wade could tell that she wasn't breathing. "He will be happy, here. Life is painful. If you want peace for him you should let him stay here.", she said simply and Wade actually believed her to be genuine. He considered that possibility, only for moment, but he did consider it. What if Peter didn't want to come back? What if being dead was easier? In the end, he decided against it, though.
"I'll cut your hair. You look like a sasquatch.", he announced. "Unless that makes you uncomfortable."
Bucky didn't need to hear that twice. "I'm getting our stuff.", he announced, as reliable as always. He turned his back on the other two, storming back into the motel.
Once they got to the part of the movie where Jo had her speech about women and their place in the world Peter actually heard MJ sniffling beside him.
"What the fuck is this noise-?", Wade groaned, joining Steve, Tony and Bucky in Tony's workshop. A deafening siren was blaring through the entire house.
But Luckily, I got absolutely hammered last night and then decided, fuck it, I'm writing this at 2 am while drunk.
"Are you enjoying it?", Wade asked. He wasn't sure how far Peter's apathy went, if he could even enjoy anything right now.
Tony quickly got serious, letting out a short sigh. "Firstly, you're not a difficult person, okay? And second, Wade's definitely into you, alright? That man is whipped for you."
"No. Maybe we'll just drive around.", Peter shrugged. He followed Wade's line of sight and looked out as well.
Peter smirked before his eyes wandered to the window, looking outside. "You should. You might reconsider..." The boy let out a sigh before locking eyes with Tony again. "Look, I get that you feel responsible but you don't know me, you don't- you don't know what you're getting into... with me."
Peter gave him a doubtful look, frowing at the book in his hands before opening it up and staring at the blank pages. "Don't pull that face, you know it helped me a lot. ", Bucky argued.
"Because you love him.", she replied and sounded absolutely not like herself. Death sounded heartbroken. Wade hadn't even known that she had a heart.
Tony looked around the room for a moment like he was trying to find the right words. His eyes focused in on the window, looking beyond it to the ocean outside. The mansion was on a cliff right by the sea. It was beautiful but essentially it felt like looking at a picture. Peter wasn't allowed to leave. Or so he thought. "Mind going on a walk, kid?", Tony asked, looking back at him as Peter's eyebrows shot up.
Someone grabbed his shoulder and turned him and suddenly there was air again, but there were also hands, touching him, and Peter was on fire. He screamed. Or maybe he didn't. He couldn't tell anymore. Good boys didn't scream. They took what they desevered in silence. He stared up at the ceiling. A face moved in the way. Peter saw Lorenz smile at him and he wanted to cry. He smiled back. It
"I'm not done yet-", Peter forced himself to say after another wave of bloody agonizing coughs. "Second- Gwen. Take care of her, please! This isn't her fault and she'll need your help, please, if you care about me, help her- she needs you. Promise you'll help her. ", he pleaded and even though it would be hard, even though Wade knew that he'd never completely forgive Gwen, he nodded.
"Nothing. You just make a lot more sense now.", MJ shrugged. Peter didn't like this, he didn't want her to pity him. They turned silent once more, the uncertainty of it all standing between them like a boulder.
"I said put your gun down.", he stated, his tone sharper this time. The pain helped him to focus, pain had always been an instrument that made him perform.
"No, this is huge! Peter asking for something? Fucking miracle. And I'm sure that it's your doing to a large extent. You did good, Barnes."
and his suicide attempt had most likely been because of the withdrawal, but even before this whole mess Peter had been prone to self destructive behaviour. " You can hold onto me the whole time, if you want. I just want to be outside.", Peter then said and that look was back in his eyes, the desperation, the pleading. Bucky was so god-awfully soft.
"Yes they do.", Wade said and a frown appeared in Death's face. That was her irritated face, Wade knew because it used to be Vanessa's irritated face.
"Is it that hard to believe that I'm bringing you to your father? Should I show you the picture again? Why does it bother you so much anyways? If I found out I had a father that isn't a complete shitshow and actually wants me... actually, I don't know what I'd do, but I'd want to meet him.", Wade snapped and Peter flinched ever so slightly, melting away Wade's irritation instantly.
That seemed to have been the wrong thing to say because Tony pulled a face, but to his credit he still stayed calm when he replied:"He isn't necessarily better than you, he's just three years ahead of you in your recovery process. Give yourself some time."
"Natasha, open the goddamn door! We need to talk!", he yelled and Natasha sighed before flipping some switches that probably turned the one way mirror into a regular window because Peter's eyes now focused in on Natasha specifically.
"Me touching you.", Wade replied, looking down at Peter's arm in his hand and Peter did the same. He didn't answer for a while, only staring at their hands, like he was trying to solve a riddle.
"Nah, I don't want to do that to him.", He shrugged. He knew Peter would hate what Wade did. He'd feel responsible and guilty even if he wasn't. Wade also didn't know what Peter would do to himself if he found out and that scared Wade more than anything.
When he looked left and right he could see Tony blasting a man's face away, Steve smashing bones with his shield, Bucky taking out man after man with his guns. It was intoxicating.
"Gwen...", he gasped, his head was pounding, he barely get to his hands an knees before Gwen placed a brutal kick to his side which made him collapse all over again. Something cracked, probably his ribs.
Peter didn't try to conceal the fact that he was contemplating it. Whatever his confession was, it didn't come easy. "Maybe now's the time to mention that I have superpowers."
. Maybe she wouldn't hurt him if he smiled, too. Maybe it wouldn't be as bad if he pretended that it wasn't.
You can also just say hi if you want! As always I'm thrilled to hear what you think about this chapter!
"Well, doesn't change the fact that you are getting some waffles, baby boy. ", Wade shrugged, focusing on the road again. He didn't like how defenseless the boy seemed. Not an hour ago he threw Deadpool through the air like he was nothing, he probably could stop this car immediately if he tried. He didn't even move.
"Wait, aren't you at least gonna ask where we're going or-", Steve started to ask but the Peter's eyes shifted towards him.
"So we can be out of here as soon as you're ready.", Tony finished. They wanted to take Peter to Malibu, the other side of the country. There they'd be more secluded, harder to find, and they wouldn't need to worry about any strangers bursting in.
"Wow, are you okay?! Wait-", the stranger asked before reaching behind Peter's head, undoing the strap of his mask and pulling out the several inches long gag that came with it. Peter desperately gasped for air before snapping his mouth shut for the first time in God knows how long. "You're Peter, right?", the stranger asked, tossing away the mask. Peter didn't question why he knew his name, they all did. The way he was holding his head though, gently, that's what freaked the boy out.
Bucky let out a sigh and let himself drop into the armchair. "I feel like I should be but I'm not.", he replied honestly.
"Are you the supposed Peter Stark?", he asked and to his shock the boy flinched so hard, he leapt into the air slightly. The other one, the masked fella, quickly placed a hand on the boy's back and he relaxed ever so slightly.
"Then let me tell you, being with someone isn't about things like sex or... touching each other, if that's not what you want. It's more about the emotional bond, about being there for each other, about support and love. And you're not robbing someone, if you're not ready to do anything, you're not damaged because of that. I'm begging you to not think of romantic relationships that way, because if you do you might end up doing something that you don't want and you don't deserve to feel such a pain. Love should be something good, something easy."
"Is that something other than cynicism I hear there?", Steve asked with a cheeky smile, slipping his hand into Tony's.
"Is he here yet?", Wade asked as he walked up to the entrance of the main building where Tony and Steve were waiting. He had arrived a little early and had used the time to dress in civilian clothes again. SHIELD probably wouldn't appreciate his blood soaked suit.
It wasn't a surprise to him either. He always wanted what he couldn't have. He was dying of cancer and wanted to live. Then he became immortal and now he craved death.
They ended up buying 5 pairs of pants, 5 shirts, 3 sweaters, one pair of shoes, one jacket and a bunch of socks and underwear for Gwen and a very ugly Christmas sweater for Peter that showed 3 reindeer fucking.
"Did you know? That she didn't want to see me, did you know that?", Peter asked him, still not looking at Tony. He didn't sound like he was feeling betrayed, he just seemed sad.
Yeah, but Peter judged himself for it. Honestly, he didn't have the right, not after he had done the same thing to her. And not after he spend three months begging her to give him some attention. He was being ridiculous.
"Whatever.", Peter shook his head slightly. "Let me rephrase it. I don't think he's lying. I believe that he loved me or loves the son he lost but... I'm not the Peter Stark he lost. You've spend the last few days with me, you know what a colossal dumpster fire of a person I am. Soon enough he'll realize that and I just don't want to deal with his disappointment. So yes, I'm protecting myself."
As furious as Steve was, he knew that she ment it. Natasha was doing what she considered right. "You have a great way of showing it.", he snapped and she bit down on her lip.
"Here you are.", Domino stated, her voice coming from the doorframe of Wade's bedroom. He didn't bother to turn around to face her.
"Not really a who, baby-boy. Helgen is a town in Skyrim and Alduin is the dragon that destroys it.", Wade then explained kindly.
"Peter...", Wade whispered into the silence. Peter wasn't looking at him, his eyes were glassy and unseeing, darting around frantically, his chest was heaving and even now he was still clawing at his skin, digging his wounds deeper and deeper.
That was the end of the conversation, Bucky knew it, heard it in the finality of the boy's tone. Peter had said all that he could, for now. It was progress but now Bucky was back to waiting.
"It's- you don't have to apologize.", Bucky started and Peter dared to close the door behind him and come in a little further. "Just please- don't just disappear on me like that. Not after- ", Bucky added, his tone pleading before his voice broke off.
"Not talking to you Wade. ", Tony stated before returning his attention to Peter. "The code is my birth date.", he added.
That's what Wade always had to remind himself of, what Irondad and his crew would have to learn. Peter had in most fields, essentially, no idea how to be human. That included healthy relationships.
He stormed back into the room expecting that maybe someone broke in, maybe HYDRA somehow found them, maybe- The only thing he saw was Peter, sticking to one corner of the ceiling, his eyes clenched shut.
Peter made himself a coffee and a hot chocolate for Gwen. He had no idea if she'd like it but it was worth a try.
"Peter, I can't hide you forever.", he stated and suddenly Peter looked up at him with this manic look in his eyes.
"Patience, kid. I'm getting there. Well, he didn't take it well at first. Understandable, if you ask me. He just found out his parents got murdered and now the murderer is right in front of him. Still, your dad only needed time. I couldn't believe it either but... he forgave me. I think he never really blamed me in the first place. You seeing where I'm going with this?", Bucky asked but Peter didn't reply, only raising his eyebrows. "If he can forgive a random stranger that killed his parents, he definitely won't hold a grudge against you. Hard to argue with that logic, isn't it?"
Peter didn't say that he would, instead he just said :"Thank you." Before turning his head to the window, the sun outside reflecting in his eyes. "I want-", Peter started but his voice broke off.
"Yeah, Steve and I are dating, have been for a while.", Tony replied before setting a plate down in front of Peter and after a moment of hesitation in front of Wade as well.
"You're wet.", Bucky suddenly stated, as if he only now noticed it and that somehow broke the tension between them, at least a little.
Bucky worked in silence for a while just snipping away at Peter's hair. Peter was surprised that he didn't feel uncomfortable at all. He had grown more and more relaxed around Bucky in the past weeks, regaining a bit of that trust that they had lost. Maybe that comfort and trust moved Peter to ask his next question.
"No. I don't mind you.", she stated and Peter felt like she was surprised by that herself. Peter didn't question it, though.  He really didn't want to go back inside so he sat down at the edge of the pool again.
He decided to give the two a little privacy as he turned his attention towards Bucky and Steve. "You really did a number on him, Buck. I'm impressed.", Steve just said and Bucky smiled but didn't look up, seeming almost shy.
"Oh fuck...yeah... that's better... thanks. ", he sighed, his eyes turned towards the sky. Suddenly he smirked.
Peter hissed but quickly schooled his expression back to neutrality as Wade dabbed a damp piece of cloth against his wounds. They were already closing up so the bandages Wade wrapped around them after cleaning them were really unnecessary.
. Like he had any choice, like it wasn't done to him, like it was his fault. "Natasha read it. And she told them all about me. About the programming I have, about what I did.", Peter's voice broke off for a second and he looked up at Bucky, his eyes haunted. "I killed my best friend, I ripped her apart on command. I'm a loaded gun and now they know.", he shrugged and Bucky could see how stricken with grief he was. Grief and selfloathing. "I even-", Peter let out a shaky agonizing laugh. "I even attacked them. After she told them, I just snapped. I'm dangerous, I don't trust myself and I can't expect them to do that. Besides, I can't take it, the way they'll look at me now that they know. And I can't go back to some fucking lab. I
"Is it true, what you said, did you try to kill yourself?", she asked him after a while. Now it was Peter's turn to feel ashamed.
Wade had made the conscious decision to not be affected by Peter leaving. Peter was just taking care of himself, he would come back when he felt better, he wanted to see him again, he said so himself! That resolution lasted until Wade spend his first couple of hours on the road and "All by myself" came on all of a sudden. Wade totally forgot that he put that song in that playlist. He just really loved Celine Dion, she literally wrote his titel song. Still, it wasn't the best song for the situation. Let's just say that he handled it as well as expected. You know that one scene in Glee where Emma cried in her car while singing along to Celine Dion as it rained outside?
"You can handle me if I'm a fucked up weirdo but not if I'm into drugs?", Peter asked, trying to go for a joking tone but this time MJ didn't join in.
"Don't touch me.", he stated, matter of fact, his voice like steel. Then his eyes wandered to the rest of the group, lingering on them for a second before returning to Tony. "And don't bother coming back. I'll see you when they're done with me."
"Hey Natalie!", Tony greeted her with a false cheerfulness in his tone and she scoffed at the name he used. A relic from when she used to spy on him. "Nice to see you, except, it isn't. Why the unannounced visit?"
Then he fell to his knees, he barely felt the pain of his bones hitting the floor. He scrambled over to the toilet, already hurling, unable to stop it. Before he knew it the last bit of food he ate the previous day shot out of him until he was completely empty, dry heaving.  His face was wet with tears and he was still trembling uncontrollably, curled up next to the toilet, when Wade opened the door.
Death smiled, or at least Wade thought so, it was kinda hard to tell when she had no skin. "You know I can't let you in."
"I don't want to hear it.", he stated and Tony shut up. "I'll come back.", he then promised and at least he didn't sound completely empty.
Then his lips met Wade's and it was like an explosion, like fireworks and like the whole world just snapped out of existence and only Wade and Peter were left. Only his lips on Peter's mattered, only their fingers intertwining. It was glorious, it was everything that Wade had imagined and more.
"It's the McWay Fall.", a voice beside Peter suddenly said and he flinched too violently to go unnoticed. To her credit the girl beside him didn't mention it. Instead she just stared at him with a blank expression.
"Shut up. He'll be here.", MJ stated but it didn't have her usual bite. She was too busy analysing the room. Peter realized that the rather sketchy crowd was stressing her out so he quickly led her to the back where the stairs were.
Peter let out a heavy sigh. "Gwen is different. It's my fault. I didn't fail to protect her, I literally killed her.",he then said and Wade stopped cutting for a second.
"In order to protect you from HYDRA as well as possible we need to remove the tracker inside your tooth and get you to a safer location.", Tony went on.
"You can eat it.", Peter told her gently and she immediately got to it. Her eyes focused in on her plate completely, only paying attention to one task at a time. Peter's eyes met Wades and he must've looked distressed again because Wade took the opportunity to kick start a conversation again.
Gwen looked actually startled by being addressed, as if she had no voice in this discussion of her future. Wade couldn't fault her for thinking like that.
"Sure", he mumbled, stepping into the bath. He didn't let himself hesitate so he didn't even have time to consider what the water would feel like. "It's warm.", he stated before placing his other foot in the water as well.
"Really?", he asked, unable to conceal the surprise in his voice. Tony stopped as well and turned around to face him once more. "I mean... you're not lying?" It made him sick how pathetic he sounded.
"Let me take one of you.", she offered and Peter handed her his phone. "Smile, you tragedy. ", she ordered with a smirk so Peter did. His smile felt weird, it always did when he smiled on purpose, but Peter didn't hate the picture when MJ showed it to him. It'd be the first picture that he'd sent Wade of himself and Peter felt like it was a good choice.
Peter could barely hold his eyes open anymore, he breathed in air and breathed out blood, he was shutting down, but still... still he was comforting Wade. "Shh... it's all good... You were great, you were... the best...", he sighed, breathing out a final time before going completely limp, eyes shut, heart still.
"You don't have to say it, if you don't mean it. ", Peter told him and he really sounded like he expected Wade to just take it back.
His eyes shot towards his bandaged wrists for a second before he quickly shook his head. It didn't help him before, it wouldn't help him now.
"Yeah, and they all treat me like one, too. They ask me for my wants and needs and they want to know my opinions and shit and what I'm okay with and what not. Weird isn't it? ", he smirked."You'll have to get used to that, too.", he added, his smirk softening to a gentle smile.
"I could've shat on what the superdads said and broken you out myself. I should've. ", Wade replied.
So Tony got up and convinced Wade to leave as well. Just before they closed the door behind them Tony turned to Peter once more, saying:"We'll be just next door." Then Bucky and Peter were alone.
"It's not like I have a choice, do I?", he asked and Steve understood what was happening. He understood because he'd seen it before in Bucky. They both had a prisoner- mentality. They didn't expect anyone to let them make their own choices.
Sorry that this update took so long, after Endgame I needed a little time to process it. I watched it twice by now, will watch it a third time on friday. I won't spoil anything but I loved it.
"Who are you talking to then, if you don't mind me asking?", he didn't sound accusatory or afraid, that helped.
It was already dark once they arrived and Peter's eyes fell on the red neon sign above the motel, flashing it's name to anyone who passed it. Bucky parked the car and they both got out, only taking a backpack each, leaving their other stuff in the trunk.
"I know. Don't moved until I tell you to, okay?" And before Wade knew what was happening Peter leaned into him, their torsos pressing together. Peter slung his arms around Wade's waist and leaned his head against his shoulder and Wade didn't move. Not a muscle, not until Peter told him to.
Tony had his eyes fixed on his son, a heartbroken expression on his face. Tony was too exprecive for his own good, you always knew what he was feeling, it made him an easy target.
Peter let out a sigh, closing the book once more and dropping it into his lap. "Maybe but... I think it would just make me paranoid. Like, I'm writing another HYDRA file that people can read and judge me on.", he then confessed, his eyes moving back to the window.
"Judging by his vitals he's fine. He seems to be brooding.", FRIDAY explained and the tension in Tony's chest eased up a bit.
"You know, Tony, Steve, Wade. What do they want from me?", Peter asked. His face still didn't change but he sounded tired, resigned, like he was
"It's not overreacting... I can see where you are coming from. But you'll be fine. Trust me.", Wade then replied, much gentler now.
Peter quickly switched from sorrow back to anger. Wade knew how easy it was to hide behind rage, he couldn't fault him for that, even if it made everything a lot harder. Peter wasn't rational when he was angry, then again, who was?
Tony gave Steve a questioning look at which he could only shrug. They were both slightly thrown, not because this type of humor was foreign to them. In fact it was exactly this type of shit that made Steve laugh and Tony knew that. But they were both pleasantly surprised that Peter seemed to have a sense of humor at all. Not only that but that he seemed to be pretty much at ease during his interactions with Wade.
They paid the lady and drove onto the lot. After finding a good spot for their car they got out and went over to the foodtrucks.
Then again, he told himself, this was only temporary. Wade was only the delivery man and once Peter was with his father again there was no promise that he'd get to feel like this again.
Peter chewed at his lip, struggling to say it, but when he did it was like he had read Bucky's mind. "Please don't ask what happened to me." It was a quiet, pitiful plea and Bucky knew that it hurt him. That it hurt Peter to ask for something.
He tried everything to give his life purpose again. Became Iron Man, became an Avenger, he even fell in love with a man who knew loss as intimately as Tony did.
But whenever it got too much he just imagined the real Peter, giving him gentle kisses, tucking himself against Wade's side. Peter wouldn't be cruel, he'd be gentle and lovely and he'd be worth it.
"The file you mentioned, have you read it?", Natasha asked once Tony was finished. He looked up from his hands, his eyes still a bit glassy. Natasha hated this, she hated that she had to make it worse.
"How did you arrive at that conclusion?", Peter asked, faking offence. Sure, he'd like to dig deeper and figure out what Tony was thinking off. But then again he didn't want to push his luck, he didn't want to annoy his father. He said they'd talk about it later so Peter would follow that order. A rare case in which his curiosity took a backseat.
"I'm trying to protect you!", she persisted and Wade could feel that same rage, spark up in him again. Steve must've noticed his tension because he tightened his hold while Wade tried to push Red away. He couldn't flip again, not in front of Peter.
Tony told Steve up front that he'd never have children again. That he couldn't bear the fear of losing them, and if he did, he wouldn't survive it. Tony thought that would be enough to send Steve away. He already prepared himself for another loss. It didn't happen,  Steve stayed. Each time Tony pushed him away, not because he wanted Steve gone, just because he was trying to get to the inevitable pain quicker, Steve stayed.
"A hero...",Peter repeated slowly before cocking his head to one side and looking at Wade. "Like you?"
Steve glanced over as well, Deadpool was currently rubbing Fake-Peter's back, quietly speaking to him. He didn't seem malicious, he actually seemed to be the only thing that kept the boy from falling apart completely. That didn't have to mean anything though, he could still be responsible for the boy's state. Steve had heard of gaslighting and
Wade quickly jumped up and made his way to the roof. When he arrived Peter was already waiting for him, glancing over his shoulder with a nervous smile that made Wade's heart flutter.
Peter didn't seem to notice Wade's surprise, or maybe he just didn't care to address it. Instead he went on. "No. You don't need to apologize. I get why you're doing it. I mean, I haven't been the most stable of guys and I know that nobody would expect me to be durable to any capacity." His response was accompanied by a dry, humorless laugh and Wade's chest ached.
That didn't stop Wades imagination from going wild. Memories of the HYDRA base he found Peter in popped up and mixed with his own time in the weapon x  program. He saw Peter strapped to a tabled, a muzzle in his mouth and panic in his eyes. He saw him in the infamous chair, the halo, that was used to brainwash him and Bucky. Wade couldn't hear White or Yellow. Red whispered in his ear.
"Yeah, I know...", Tony grumbled before wiping one hand over his face and through his hair. "But are you telling me because you want to or because you think that you have to?"
"There is one more thing.", Peter said, his look uncertain, not scared but something not too far off. "You need to talk to me. Ask me what I-",
Peter nodded slowly before reaching behind his seat, picking up Wade's backpack and searching through it. He pulled a pink unicorn plushie out and gave Wade a questioning look. "Do I even wanna know?", he asked with a raised eyebrow.
Next they went north. Multnomah Falls were beautiful though Peter didn't enjoy how cold it already was in Oregon. Judging my Bucky's light jacket it wasn't that bad but Peter was very sensitive to the cold.
Hello there, I wanted to warn you that there is discussion of self harm and suicide in this but it's only mentioned and not at all graphic.
He looked outside for a while, watched the bright scenery rush by the windows of their car. They were driving away from the coast, Peter didn't know where to, hopefully somewhere pretty and open. He felt so trapped, even in this car he felt it. Like he was still in his cell at SHIELD. agent Lorenz called it his room or his quarters. It was his cell either way. Just how calling him a patient hadn't changed what he really was to them, a prisoner and a subject. He had felt the same way at Tony's house. His supposed
"Oh Pete... Do you kiss your father with that mouth?", Keipon asked with a frown, sounding like a disappointed parent, everything about this made Peter sick.
"I guess so. See you later, Peter." With that she turned around and left through the entrance of the motel.
He went to the kitchen on their floor, making himself Waffles even though it was 1 am. He was too worked up, too wired, he needed to do something. Steve was just finishing up when a soft knock startled him out of his solitude. Peter was leaning in the doorway, dressed in one of Bucky's sweaters, his hair standing in all directions but his eyes awake and focused. "Mind if I join you? I smelled Waffles. ", he asked softly and a smile split on Steve's lips.
"Is it always going to be like this now?", Peter suddenly asked and at first Wade genuinely didn't get what he ment.
It's like her words flipped a switch in Peter and he started to shake, then tremble. "I didn't-", he choked," I didn't mean for that to happen- I didn't-"
"That's because I can't.", Peter attempted to joke and MJ let out a snort before turning around to pull the door to the driver's side of the car open.
"Peter, I need you to listen to me.", Wade ordered, he had to ground him somehow. To his surprise Peter went quiet, he still didn't look at him, though. "Yes, listen to my voice, that's right. You're not at HYDRA anymore. Okay? You are outside, beside a highway. We were driving and- "
"Wade?", Domino's voice called. Wade wasn't sure how long she had been standing outside of his apartment, hammering against the door. He had woken up at some point but thus far he hadn't brought up the energy he needed to move. So he just stayed curled up in his bed, staring out the window as his body trembled. God, he was so exhausted.
Wade wasn't a pessimist, or an optimist for that matter. He was desperate, though, desperate and soft, for Peter. Wade had thrown the whole don't-get-attached-thing overboard a long time ago. Maybe it wasn't there in the first place. He loved easily, way too easily for someone who seemed to kill everything in his reach. Now Peter seemed to be the next life he destroyed in his path. Logically he knew that this wasn't his fault and that Peter's life had been a raging dumpster fire way before Wade ever got his hands on it. But Wade wasn't a creature of logic, his existence wasn't bound to logic, it rarely applied to him and his mind rarely focused on it. Wade wasn't optimistic, someone like him couldn't afford that. He wasnt like Domino. Things didn't just work out for him. But this wasn't about Wade's happiness, it was about Peter and Wade would've never given up as long as there was even a slight chance that Peter was still out there. He was sure of that.
Peter had to smirk. Bold was really not a term he'd use to describe himself but if there was a time when he could afford to be reckless, it would be now. He had nothing left to lose.
"Fuck off, I'm depressed.", Wade then groaned. Weasel's answer to that was to pour Wade another one, that Wade obediently drank.
Death didn't answer for a moment. She just let her finger trace Wade's jaw, a playful smile on her lips. Then:"He was very brave, you know. So fucking brave. I gotta say, you have great taste, love."
"Gwen.", He whispered, his voice suddenly raw. He couldn't say anything else, all he could do was stare.
"Let me give you a tip, you and I have a mutual friend that has a thing for killing, memes and losing his loved ones.", she replied with a smirk.
"What do you mean?", Steve asked, cocking his head to one side slightly. A loose strand of his golden hair brushed against his forehead and Tony was struck with how lucky he was to not be alone in this. Steve Rogers, a fucking treasure.
After careful delibiration, as careful as a panicking mind could delibirate, Peter charged forward and slammed his hand onto the button, hopefully activating an alarm or something that would alert his family.
"No, don't worry, it's fine.", he said, even though it obviously wasn't. Tony could tell by how Peter crossed his arms, held himself, his shoulders hunched and defensive. They were all silent for a second, suffocating with uncertainty. "I'm sorry, for what I did- ", Peter started and of course they all wanted to jump to his defenses.
, Bucky knew what he ment. He himself had left the Avengers because he needed space to get better by himself. No matter how well-meaning people sometimes were, they could also give you the feeling that you were a problem. The bomb in the room, the issue, the tragedy. And when you snapped, when you lost it, when you had setbacks, they were devastated and that only made you feel worse about yourself.
"Then let me explain to you that real love is unconditional. You love someone even when it's not easy, even when it's pretty fucking hard. Loving someone is real annoying most of the time anyways but most people still do it.", Wade tried to explain but Peter didn't seem convinced. "Look, you don't have to be all lovey-dovey with him but maybe, just maybe, try not to push him away unnecessarily. Try to enjoy it.", Wade then added and he could tell that Peter was swaying a little but not completely yet.
"Oh thank you! I know, I'm a total poet!", he said before bowing a little. He then let out a little breathless laugh, stroking his hand through his hair. "God that was shit. She was always way better than me.", he admitted.
But not that day and Bucky quickly realized why. Next to the bed was a suitcase and in the suitcase was a pile of notebooks and one of those notebooks was in Kid's lap. He hadn't noticed Bucky entering, he was actually reading this time.
"Gwen, don't do this, it's not too late to turn the jet around." That was Bucky's voice, calm, collected, goal oriented.
"Invading Czechoslovakia, what does it look like?", he snapped, his voice was lacking his usual snark. Right now it was sharp. dangerous, just like the swords he carried with him. Wade tried to push past Bucky but Bucky wasn't having it.
For a moment Peter didn't know what to respond. Sure, maybe she was faking the guilt but Peter didn't think so. He was good at reading lies. He was raised by liars. But just because she was telling the truth didn't mean that all was good now.
"Coward." He tried to sound teasing but it fell flat. Peter was sure that Bucky noticed because he put down the phone as quickly as he had pulled it up. On Peter's request he showed him the picture before sending it to Tony. Peter hadn't realty looked at himself in a while. The boy on the picture was a stranger. Tousled dark hair, pale skin, dark circles under his eyes, and dressed in black like a funeral. But something about the look in his eyes, the way he had cocked his head to one side. It didn't look like the devastad empty boy from the HYDRA file. He still looked hollow, but harsher, sharper. Peter wasn't sure if he liked it. "I look dead inside.", Peter pointed out, no specific tone to his voice.
"What do you want to talk about?", Wade asked him and the smile returned to Peter's face. There was something cheeky about it and goddamn, Wade would do almost anything to have Peter look at him like that.
"It was tough, but you can imagine that. He didn't remember me, he didn't remember himself. In the beginning he thought I was his handler, that was...rough. I mean... He was fucking terrified and so frustrated with himself and it's fucking heart breaking to watch someone you love go through that while not knowing how to help." While he spoke, Tony looked up at Steve. He rarely saw Steve like this anymore, vulnerable about his own frustrations, his own feelings. They both had their demons, matching mountains of PTSD and abandonment issues. Tony had to wake Steve up from nightmares just as often as Steve had to calm Tony down after a panic attack. They used to talk about that a lot, exchange their traumas. Lately Tony felt like it had all become about him, or not him but Peter and Steve was supportive as always. Tony still felt like he was neglecting Steve a bit. But he also didn't know how to stop worrying about Peter. He used to be like that before Peter was taken, too. Peter used to be and still was the most important part of his life. Now there was just a new completely rational sense of panic involved in that. "Yeah, that sums it up pretty well.", he mumbled, otherwise lost for words.
Sometimes Bucky would speak to Kid, Kid would reply by nodding or shaking his head, if he felt like it. Sometimes he just pulled faces, sometimes it felt like he wasn't really there.
"I made a friend who is very into internet culture.", Peter stated proudly. "Apparently I have a type. ", he then added with a shrug and Wade's heart skipped a beat.
He hadn't been himself back then, still wasn't entirely, but he was working on it. He spend so much time trying to be better, but now that he saw this face from his past, all the dread came crashing down on him. He expected them to catch up to him in the end, HYDRA would never let him go, not fully. Now he had to make a decision.
"Peter. ", Gwen said, her tone careful, her smile hesitant and Peter might burst. He wasn't sure what he was feeling, if it was positive or negative but it was definitely a lot.
"No, I'm fucking losing it. But thanks for asking.", he laughed and that actually made Wade crack up as well.
All he knew was that something was wrong between them, that something was definitely wrong with Peter himself.
Peter continued to watch movies with Wade and actually tried to pay attention to the plot. He tried to participate, be less of a ghost. It was tiring but Peter hoped that it would be worth it in the long run. Fake it 'till you make it, right?
She scanned the room for the file with her eyes first before starting to search it. The closet, dresser and shelf were first. After that she checked the drawers of the desk. One was jammed and she broke it open with one of her knifes to find it empty. Natasha tried to think like a kid, where would Peter hide something like this? Something that he maybe didn't want to see on accident. Natasha dropped to the ground and crawled under the bed where she found a thick, worn file jammed between the slatted frame and the mattress. There was no sense of victory in finding it.
There was something heartbreaking about how matter-of-factly Peter spoke about himself. "Peter- I don't care about what they did to you, I thought I'd never see you again. I still can't believe that you're really alive and if you think that I'll send you away now, you're absolutely crazy.", Tony didn't know how to convince Peter, how to make him believe.
"Not sure if that's a compliment but I'll take it as one.", he smirked before sitting down on the curb. He was too exhausted for this shit, his healing was taking up all his energy. MJ was nice enough to sit down beside him and he was glad to see that she didn't seem spooked.
Bucky didn't point out that Tony's car was basically self-driving and he barely needed to watch the road. Instead he looked ahead and let Peter listen to the music without being watched. This much he could give him.
Wade looked at the closed door for a moment before returning his gaze to Tony.  "I guess it went well?", he asked sarcastically and Tony rolled with his eyes.
Better leave with your head held high instead of overstaying your welcome. Wade let out a chuckle, forced himself to relax and put on a nonchalant act. "Oh come on, Spidey. You think Imma get all sappy just because you ain't got a rose for me?", he smirked and Peter shrugged nervously, his eyes cast down.
Tony couldn't believe it. He hadn't thought that he'd ever hear Peter say those words again. He was content with Peter just being here but to hear him say that he loved Tony, that he considered him family, it was better than Tony could've ever imagined.
Gwen landed the plane not long after that. Peter tried to see where they were landing. It didn't seem to be a HYDRA base. It looked pretty broken down, actually. Maybe it used to be a factory or a power plant or something but it had to be long abandoned,  if HYDRA was holed up here.
"You'll have to tell him eventually.", Dom just stated stubbornly, crossing her arms in front of her chest.
The boy crawled up into one corner of the ceiling, facing the door, holding onto the wall with his feet and wrapping his arms around the trembling cage that was his torso. There he waited for them to come, to rip him apart, drown him out, bend and maybe even break him.
When Peter came to a halt a few feet away from them nobody really knew what to do. Wade wanted to hug him but he could imagine that Peter wouldn't appreciate that at all. "Hello Peter, how are you doing?", Steve asked, his tone awkward and stilted. Peter looked at him with the bored expression not shifting at all.
"Right now someone should watch you, you may seem non-violent but that can change rapidly." Wade noticed how Bucky addressed Peter directly, not talking over his head. Peter didn't seem to appreciate it all that much.
Maybe it was too late, maybe he was too far gone. His family had to think so, too. They sent him away. They were smarter than Gwen, they realized that they couldn't fix him, not on their own. He understood. It still
"I thought you were dead- they told me that they-", Gwen stammered, her breath starting to hitch as she started to cry as well.
"You see, I didn't really plan on stumbling into you. But even if I did, low profile isn't really my style. If it was I wouldn't be wearing this bright-red full-body-condom every day.", Deadpool, or Wade, smirked.
Peter pressed his lips together and glanced down for a second before meeting Wade's eyes again.  And then... Then Wade felt Peter's hand cover his own where it was resting between them. And not just a brush, no, it lingered.
They never let him die though, no matter how much Peter begged for it, no matter how close he got. His body could, unfortunately, take a whole lot of shit, even when his mind couldn't.
"Trauma, PTSD and... cult deprogramming.", Tony replied and Peter spun around to face them with raised eyebrows.
Out the corner of his eyes he saw Wade reach for his weapons, move in front of Peter like a shield but he couldn't quite comprehend it. Then he heard his voice. "Run, hide, don't come out until I call you."
"What?", Natasha asked, barely able to tear her eyes off Peter. Gwen had stepped next to him by now, holding onto his shoulder while she was trying to get him to look at her but Peter just continued to stare down Natasha.
Peter raised his hand and looked at it, as if he completely forgot about it, his knuckles were bloody and he hissed when he tried to form a fist. "I think I might've broken some fingers.", he then said with a startled laugh.
"You're fucking with me, right?", he asked at the end of it and Peter stopped in his tracks to shake his head. Wade felt so fucking dumb, like the biggest moron ever. "Peter, the only reason I left is because I thought that you wanted me gone, I would've never done that if I-"
'"Hey, Peter, listen to me. Everything's going to be fine!", Peter could hear Wade's voice but it was like someone stuffed cotton balls in his ears or like he was under water. It was far away and the alarm bells in Peter's mind were so deafening that he couldn't focus on the words.
. Like Peter was the monster in this, the weapon, the danger. Bucky scoffed. He was the only one that had an idea of what Peter was going through right now.
"Yeah. My mind is running a mile a minute. But Gwen's asleep now and I don't want to disturb her. ", he admitted.
Alarm bells went off in Wade's head in the form of his boxes laughing manically. "Trust me, you don't wanna see my ugly mug.", he only smirked but Peter didn't let it go this easily.
Wade tried to tell himself that that was the reason, that Peter would be fine. His doubts still remained. They took the form of his boxes.
God, Peter was so tired. But he didn't close his eyes, not yet. Instead he watched the sky, in all of it's glorious beauty and for a second he didn't feel quite as disgusting. That's as good as it would get for him, Peter was sure of that. With that he closed his eyes and let loose, of time, of consciousness, of life. Peter was dying and he didn't mind.
"Oh yeah, I got shot a couple of hours ago.", Peter replied with a smirk, pulling up his shirt with his free hand. Revealing the white bandaid Bucky had applied before they drove here.
The door to the cell slid open and one the guard stepped in to removed the tracker around the girls neck. Peter held onto her hand the entire time and didn't let go of it once they stepped out of the cell.
"You're pathetic. Look at yourself.", Keipon snarled, grabbing Peter by his jaw and forcing eye contact. He looked disgusted with Peter... because Peter had been
"Gwen, I know you're in there, you gotta snap out of this. ", he whispered. At this point it wasn't even about saving himself anymore, for Peter it had never been about himself.
"Doctor, the Avengers have arrived on sight.", one of the guards announced and Peter didn't dare to be relieved. He was nowhere near safe.
"Why are you here...", he then asked, neutral. Peter was quick to put up his walls again once he was in control.
"You're an abomination. I crime against nature. I need you to remember that.", She'd say. "The dead shouldn't be alive."
"Of course,  I put it there for you.", Wade agreed, still not facing Peter. "Wait, I'll get you fresh clothes while you dry off.", he then announced before leaving the room, letting Peter have the privacy to step out of the bath and dry himself off.
"Fight back!", she snapped before slapping Peter across his face and this time she sobbed desperately. Like she needed him to give her a reason to kill him. She shouldn't have the need for a reason.
The next morning he woke up to see MJ's face hovering above his. Her wild curls were hanging in her face and the light from the window gave her a halo.
