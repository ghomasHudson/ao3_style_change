He held up various instruments at a time met with a head shake from Obie, stopping on a circular ring and a pair of pliers. Tony felt his skin rubbing raw and tearing under the restraints but pulled harder against them when his uncle nodded and the man approached. A wide palm enclosed his jaw, fingers wrenching his clenched teeth apart and shoving the ring behind his teeth. Tony twisted in place, wrenching his head back and forth as the man strapped the contraption to his head by it’s leather straps.
The captain walked carefully through the growing crowds, glancing over his shoulder every once and a while, shepherding him through the streets with ease. Only then did Tony realize that he could barely hear the footsteps of the large man in front of him, the deliberate steps avoiding dips or curves in his path that might otherwise impede him. Although the sun was steadily rising into the sky, bringing a radiant warmth on the parts of Tony’s skin it could reach, it wasn’t enough to keep the chill from biting at his fingers and nose. As more people flooded the streets, looking to make purchases from the stands lining the roads; travelling to work, transporting animals, you name it, it was happening, Tony walked closer and closer behind the Captain, eventually resorting to catching a handful of the deep brown cloak in front of him and bringing the large man’s head as close to his own as he would allow.
Clint’s voice rang out, “Buck says he’s had worse and I believe it. Stop squirming.” That last part was muttered under his breath, taking care to stitch a particularly wide cut on the silent man’s leg.
“Y’know, I was wondering. How’d you get an arrow stuck in you if you had a shield?” Tony mused as he cleaned out the slivers of open skin, mostly to keep himself busy.
“Rhodey has been with us for some time, just as uncooperative as you, such a trooper,” He kneeled down and pinched his friend's cheek roughly, barely dodging the snap of teeth that came after. “I can see how he became a General.
“The human body is truly incredible,” His uncle’s voice carried over the struggle, meeting Tony’s glare with a cool smirk. “Able to recover from almost any wound, survive horrible conditions, even amputation… Oh don’t look at me like that, your hands will be fine, you need them to build after all.”
The team was back late. The rest of the day had gone just fine, the two had returned to the lab after eating, resuming Tony’s lessons. He absorbed everything that Bruce taught him, finding he worked better hands-on as they accelerated into electronics.
worried about you, couldn’t believe the rumors of you going to the mountains. Even hired me to bring you back home.”
Tony’s eyes opened to a commotion at the front door, pain in his shoulder returning for a split second before the green haze filled the whole room. The room descended into chaos when the group of superhumans rounded the corner, obviously injured. While their leathers were torn and bloodied in a few places, the cuts had already healed and closed of their own accord. Bruce launched himself off the covers and grabbed Thor by the arm, pulling it over his shoulder and leading him down the hall. Clint followed suit with Bucky, Nat guiding Steve and the rest on their heels.
The man stopped and glanced at him with a hint of a smile on his lips, shifting his grip a bit but still leading on. Tony glanced around nervously and took a chance, it seemed like this mountain of a man could understand him so he might as well, “Where, uh, are you taking us then? Nowhere bad I hope?”
“There are three suites to each floor, excluding this one of course, each suite has a washroom, kitchen and other amenities,” filling the silence while the pair made their way to a pair of doors against a far wall, which opened to reveal a small mirrored room with buttons on the inside wall. Tony hesitated for a moment before following him in, messing with his hair in the reflective surface, trying to make sense of the mess.
Let me know of any questions you've got and I'll try and answer them or I'll let you know if it's a spoiler.
Packing the bloody area with bandages was the easy part, now the obstruction was gone and he could start healing. He slid the knife through the knots holding the leather cuirass together and opened it, carefully sliding it forward and off the broad shoulders, leaving Steve in just his bottoms.
“-he MDU, which is where we all stay. We’ll have your things moved there for now, you show a lot of potential and as a newcomer, you’ll have access to our materials under supervision. I’ll take you there in a moment, that is if you’re okay with that. Tony?”
“And it’s easier to just take the superhumans, things go a lot faster this way.” Sam winked at him as he slid a metal pack onto his back, pressing a button that made the contraption light up red and begin humming.
The sound of metal rattling against itself came from down the hall, increasing in volume as Obie began what sounded like the beginning of a rehearsed speech, “I’ve been a part of this company for my entire life, longer than you’ve been alive, and I do believe it is my turn to run things.”
“Mr. Tony, are you quite alright?” Tony drew in shaking breaths, adrenaline still coursing through his body and tensing up when J gently touched his forearms to gain his attention.
Tony works to escape his captors, maybe even making a deal in the process, and we get to see an old friend.
Thank you for reading! Drop a comment or kudos if you enjoyed, they let me know what I'm doing right and push me to write more <3 <3
Tony was again jolted from his thoughts as the faint sound of a door across from his swooshed open and more footsteps traveled down the hall. Steve was going somewhere? Tony glanced at the spare clothes he had been given and sighed, reluctantly removing his tunic and changing in front of the fire. The pale blue tunic hung off his shoulders and showed off his collarbones nicely, but thankfully still covering his soulmark. The deep blue trousers fit nicely around his waist and, after rolling the bottoms up, framed his boots like they were meant to be. Leaving his borrowed cloak, Tony found his way to the elevator and followed the noise on the first floor to a room he hadn’t been introduced to yet. He peeked his head around the corner and gasped as an enormous chamber room filled with seemingly endless walls of racks of armor, color differentiating as they went around the corner. In the center of the large expanse was Steve, Sam, Bucky, Thor and Valkyrie, still strapping leather to themselves, speaking with Bruce in what tony had learned was Norse, the language of the Gods. Although they did not look worried or rushed, dread settled like a pit in Tony’s stomach at seeing what he believed to be the largest and strongest men and women he had ever met rounded the armory corner, handing weapons to the main five and assisting in assembling the last of their armor.
Loki let out a put upon sigh, continuing his magic above them, “I’m sure you’ve grown up with the stories of soulmates, even in a household like yours, someone must have spun you tales of ‘finding your other half’ or destiny or the inevitability of finding love. It’s not true. Everyone has another half, someone or multiple someones that make you feel… whole.”
Abusive behavior and violence in this first chapter, you can skip to the first break and be just fine.
He brought the blade up to the entrance wound and cut the top layer of skin first, bisecting the area. The smell of iron was already heavy in the air, but now it lingered on his tongue and sat. Bringing the blade back heavier, he cut through the next layers of skin and fat, following the line he drew. Steve hummed in the back of his throat and brought a fist to his mouth, biting down.
“Tony!” His cover blown, Thor waving his arm with a flourish for Tony to join them. As he approached, the small crowd of people dwindled until there were only two strangers left, ready for battle.
Bruce hummed, “Well, a perimeter check entails them riding around the land and its surrounding areas-”
Steve chuckled, shaking his head lightly, “It’ll be best if you snap the end off first. Grab a few of those pressure bandages and the flat knife, you’re gonna have to cut this thing out of me. Hey, Bruce?”
Sorry this was so late! I got the infamous sickness of 2020 (covid) and have recovered! I have the next 3 chapters planned out, alls to do is write and revise, so I'll see you all next update <3
A loud banging against the metal in front of him made him jerk his hand away, “Rest time. Don’t make me come back there and put you to sleep.”
Obadiah clapped his hands together and smiled warmly, “Glad you still recognize me, son! Anything I can get for you? A drink, something to eat?”
The rattling metal rolled closer until it was directly outside his confinement, the end of a metal cart peeking through the doorway, multiple shiny instruments hanging off of it. The rest came into view with one final shove and, oh fuck, it was absolutely covered in weapons, tools, things that Tony was certain belonged in a fucking kitchen. Struggling anew, he watched in horror as a bandana-clad man handed a chair to his uncle, running his fingers over the cart’s contents and inspecting them.
Even stranger was the warmth he still felt in his mark from when the captain first touched him, lulling him into a sense of security he hadn’t felt in months.
“You should know I’m not,” He took hold of the lowest part of the arrow and snapped it above his fist. Even as he tried to keep it steady, he heard Steve’s small groan when the head shifted.
“Of course, your highness,” sarcasm dripping from his voice, the magister drew a translucent blue sheet over them and Tony felt his mind grow slow. The world grew muted and dull as his eyes drifted close, feeling Natasha’s heartbeat against his face, the only noise left the breath of his friends.
“Shit!” He forgot to bring something of his mothers! In the rush of everything he forgot, how could he forget? It’s not like she had been gone that long, how could he have been so stupid! He blinked frustrated tears away and flopped heavily onto his side, as though that small amount of pain could be his repentance. Curling in on himself, he drifted off to Essam’s soft breathing, a nice constant to keep him tethered to his life and where it was going.
Tony only stopped thrashing when the pliers closed tightly around one of his molars, looking into the expressionless mask for empathy and empathy that didn’t exist. In one swift movement, the tooth was ripped from its root and dropped to the floor. Tony didn’t realize he was screaming until his blood bubbled in his throat and choked him, the pain was incredible but not the worst to come, he was certain. Richard shoved his head down, blood pouring out of his open mouth and down his shirt, warmth seeping through his chest.
“Shit, how are you not screaming right now? Because this honestly looks horrific, Cap.” It may have been his lack of battlefield experience but the arrow sticking out of the broad upper shoulder was one of the worst things he’d ever seen. The skin was puckered around it like it was trying to heal despite the dark wood embedding itself in the man, the head was fully submerged as well. Glancing at the rest of him, he could see the semi healed cuts beneath leather, small pieces of metal and wood stuck in them. He’d deal with those in a minute.
The room was more of a cave, rows of metals and tools stacked high, blocking the 50 foot depth. With only one guard watching him, Tony took the blade that had been used on Rhodey from the small of his back and stashed it under a workbench. He made his way through the blueprints, finding a mix of his father’s and Hydra weapons. Mostly of mass destruction.
When he looked up at the Captain in question the man merely shrugged, “You left yours back in the meeting room, you need it more than I do.”
The team at the table was no longer relaxed or performing small absentminded fidgets, sympathetic eyes turned his way but he avoided them nonetheless. Rogers turned to face them, switching back to what Tony could only identify as something his mother used to tell tales about, the whole table animated and speaking nearly at once was a bit dizzying. The person who had been sent off returned with what looked like one of the blueprints that had been in his bag, displaying it on the table and saying something before leaving again. The table dissolved into deeper conversation, so he just stared a place at the table where the wood had splintered and let his mind wander, barely registering the change of language back to one he could understand.
Steve raised a hand to stop her at his table, “Please don’t hurt them too bad, but drag them through town if you have to.” They smiled at each other knowingly and the redhead left, heading toward the armory.
“We’ll be back before midday tomorrow,” Steve placed a shield on his back as his face grew serious. “Do me a favor, Tony. Get some rest while you can, sleeping in the lab isn’t good for you, next time our Doctor might not be so gracious to let me know.” And with that the group strode past him to the door, leaving him baffled until he heard the front door close behind them, moving to Bruce’s side.
“Stop,” his voice escaped him in a breath, “I... I’ll build for you, just-just don’t hurt him. Anything you want; money, fame, the business, my life and eternal servitude.”
, he thought to himself, a glimmer of hope that quickly squashed itself at the larger groups of people heading their way.
“You see,” Obie stood, walking behind Tony’s back as his voice became softer, “there’s something I need from you. Just a little information about your time with the Lord of the North.”
Jarvis stood in the doorway of Tony’s room and watched the young man's face as it fell, tears threatening to form in the corners of his eyes. He turned away, scrubbing at his eyes and muttering a ‘thanks J’ in a small voice when Jarvis stepped closer to run a hand through his hair and pull him into a half hug.
Tony bristled, they want undeniable proof? Fuck it. Give it to them. He wrangled off his cloak and tunic, twisting his body to reveal a mass of black and blue lines and splotches covering his entire back, “Courtesy of my father not long before I left home. Decided I needed a trip down the stairs for asking too many questions.”
A chair screeched across the floor and Obie’s figure blocked his vision for a moment. He stopped on Tony’s left and leered close to the side of his face, Tony feeling the bite against his already open wounds as he leaned away.  He flinched away again when Obie laughed, Rhodey had been able to kick the man on his legs in the back, “As… admirable as he is, I’m afraid I can’t lose anymore men to him. So,”
He startled awake, already retied to the chair bolted in the center of his cell and immediately slurs his way through a tirade of insults directed at his uncle. Obie’s amused face comes into focus slowly, looking far too smug for the complete lack of information and cooperation Tony’s given.
I was debating a nsfw ending but I couldn't really find a way to make it fit? I might add an extra chapter if I get inspo
The cell door swung open and there he was. Rhodey. Relief and dread flooded his heart. His best friend was a balm to all the pain he’d been through, he had missed him desperately. Rhodey was still in their military’s uniform, though it was ruffled and he had obviously put up a fight, he smiled wide when he saw Tony. Three guards shoved him farther into the cell as Obie began speaking again. Bastard loved the sound of his own voice.
Rhodey’s head turned his way and their eyes locked, “Tones, I love you with all my heart, but please shut the hell up. Don’t tell them anything, you have a duty to your people.”
Shoutout to everyone who's left kudos and comments, been many times where I felt like abandoning this and got a comment that made me come back <3
When he finally stumbled his way down to the communal room, he found that Natasha, Bruce, Clint, and Scott were huddled together on one of the mounds of furs in front of the fire, Valkyrie and Loki were hovering around them. Natasha had Clint’s face tucked into her shoulder, smothering his occasional whimpers, the rest of his body tensed up along her side. Scott was curled up against Clint with his legs tucked under the other man’s, one arm around his stomach and the other wrapped around his own. If Tony looked closely enough, he could see sweat across Scott’s brow and the occasional tremor that ran through his body.
Little wet spots appeared and fizzled on the metal Tony was welding. He scrubbed his forearm across his eyes and sighed, his father always said crying would get him nowhere. As much as he hated it, his father was probably right.
Tony will get to be his little shit self here, but he's in a very complicated place and is pretty scared right now. The whole team is multilingual, so no need for translations, Thor is just intimidating at first glance. Next time we meet the main team and dig a little deeper into what tony's plans are! Thanks for reading, comments/kudos/criticism is appreciated <3
The rest of the team had joined them for dinner that night, Loki preparing a hare stew and bringing down an Asgaurdian alcohol as a “gift for the new member”. Tony didn’t like the glint in his eye when he said that, so he simply sipped at his cup over dinner until Clint reached over and stole it from him (a grateful theft), downing it in one go. They all chatted into the night, Tony regaling them with tales of what it was like South, how things hadn’t really changed and seemed stuck in place, his tongue loosened by what little he had drunk. They returned the favor by answering his questions of the history of the place, short stories of how they came to live there and a little about themselves. Even Thor’s aloof brother had shared a few old tales, almost certainly giving them his own twist, evident by the smirk on his face.
Jarvis stopped them at the gate, producing a map out of seemingly nowhere and tucking it in with the young man’s blueprints, “You’ll be needing this, it’s the best I could find for detailing of the surrounding areas. Please take care of yourself sir.”
“This arrow’s barbed, should I push it through or cut it out?” Another muffled response. “That’s what I thought.”
Hot damn, accidentally made this chapter 2.5k words long. Getting a bit more sass from Tones and some very trusting Steve. We've got an accepting but nervous team.
Tony shut down the welder and lit up the lantern next to his cot, bringing it to the very back of the cave and dimming it. He felt his way back to the stash of chemicals and metals he needed, inspecting them in the dim light.
Now he was paused at a fork in the path he was following, looking around helplessly as he searched for any marker on the map in his hands that matched his surroundings. Just my luck, he thought, at least I can’t get more lost. Grimacing, he pulled his horse to the right, unsatisfied at his own decision but without much choice. He made sure to pay attention to each turn, marking it down on the back of his map in case he needed to turn back. He had just turned onto a larger path when he hit a clearing, he glanced up after making his mark and gasped. Around 30 yards away was a large iron gate, intricate in detail but sturdy as hell, at least it looked like it. Tony dismounted from his horse and approached the gate that was easily three times his size, trailing eyes at the rock surrounding it, trying to find a way in. He brought a hand up and knocked on the gate three times… Nothing.
“Just get your ass down here,” Natasha grabbed his hand and pulled him down until he rested his head against her stomach and felt his legs settle next to Bruce’s.
Only a few weeks had passed since his mother's death when he finally had enough. Jarvis had been subtly providing him with containers of water and nonperishable food so he could live in his room and avoid the man stalking the halls, just waiting for an opportunity. He still forgot to eat, instead burying himself in his work, designing new weapons, until he had a surplus of both.
“But you, the youngest Stark, can help the world! Think of it Tony, a world like the one you saw inside those walls, you can help your people in unimaginable ways! All you have to do,”
Thank you to everyone who stuck with me through this, waited for the last chapter, or even just read the first part
Green patterns resumed above his head and the pain in his shoulder left completely until all that was left was an occasional twinge. He looked into the glowing green eyes to his left and lifted an eyebrow at the glare.
Rogers caught his eye in the reflection and smiled when Tony’s hands shot back down to his sides, “Oh, you’ll love this. You said you’re an inventor, right? Watch,” the doors closed and he pressed one of the buttons on the wall, and Tony’s center of gravity shifted down, feeling the room move upward. Apparently his confusion was blatant enough to warrant concern and an explanation, “We’ve been allies with Wakanda for centuries, their advancements in technology has been incredible, the next time their king visits I can introduce you,” he paused when the doors opened and they exited onto another floor, “His sister would love to have another person to bounce ideas off of, right now all she’s got is Banner, Bucky and myself.”
Tony applied the last bit of plaster to the cut stretching across one of the Captains shoulder blades and hopped off the table, grabbing a nearby rag to wipe his hands off with. He rounded the table and glanced at the man’s now exposed torso in case there were more cuts but what he saw…
Whats the best way to deal with finding your soulmate? Well if you're Tony, you avoid the issue and get into perilous situations.
The sun’s glow had started to show itself over the mountain tops and signs of the towns population were finding their way in the pairs path, just further into the compound than he had been able to see before. Early risers and shopkeepers called, “Heill
Also, we're getting close to an end! Thank you to everyone who's read so far, kudos'd or commented, it means a lot to me <3 Sorry the updates have been sporadic, but I hope this will end happily for everyone involved.
Our timeline is a bit messed up too, Ragnorak has already happened, there won't be a civil war because that's stupid, Wakanda is not as advanced as they are in the movie just so we can be real on where they were (they are currently at modern day technology/slightly more advanced but with the same ideals and attitudes as in the movie). Just a side note in case I don't explore it enough later, Sam Steve and Bucky are all results of the superhuman serum. Will I tell you who made them? Fuck no, not yet.
Okay, what’s the worst that could happen? Obie had mentioned he wouldn’t permanently mutilate or ruin him, but things sure weren’t looking good. In the hallway, he could hear something being dragged toward the cell.
He carefully cut around the head, wincing in time with Steve and dabbing away the blood that pooled over his fingers. It made his grip slick, nearly letting the muscle fall back in place. Tony dug his hand in more forcefully, desperately ignoring the sound it made as he pulled the barbed metal out. The captain's shoulders heaved, gushing more blood that Tony made quick work of and between wipes, he could already see the wound stitching back together. The pain in his shoulder had all but disappeared now as he was more focused on the medical marvel in front on him.
“Rogers, I can’t keep up with you through this crowd and I’m thinking I’m going to freeze my ass off before we get to the bunker.”
He couldn’t help the sardonic tone slipping in the last sentence and grimaced at his own inflection.
He took a deep breath and rubbed a free hand over his soulmark, a constant warmth through his body. Even through the torture of the past -however long he’d been here, days, a week or weeks- it had stayed a comfort.
Obie’s smile fell, a sneer taking its place as he rubbed his bald head, “Then perhaps I can change your mind.
Tony’s face went pale as his heart rushed blood to his arms and legs, pleading with his uncle, “I can’t- Obie,
Loki’s face had grown soft as he looked at the group in front of him, his hands slowed but consistent, “My magic isn’t really meant for this. I’m a God and it feels insultingly below me to play healer to a bunch of mortals.”
As the other man laughed and led the way to the kitchen, Tony felt a ball of anxiety start to form in his stomach and desperately hoped it was just hunger.
Tony’s hand moved to his temple, ghosting over the last place Steve had touched him as he cried. He faced the wall and slid his hand across his chest, the warmth of his mark flooding his body as he drifted off.
The man held both hands up in surrender, “Okay, I understand. However, for us, this is a very serious accusation and while we may not know your father, there are certain actions we’ll have to take to ensure your safety. If this is true, we would consider him banished from our society as a whole, ostracized from any future communications or any shared technology. It is very rare that Wakanda allows people to join their collective kingdom, but we are instructed to keep our options open. Is there any way you can prove this without a doubt, an eyewitness or something of the like?”
“Follow me then,” He’s already walking toward the entrance and holding the door, Tony gives a last look at the group around the table and follows, “It’s to the left, rather large building in town, hard to miss.”
Tony’s vision blurred yet again, leaning down off the horse to give J a hug and the same to Friday, “I’ll be careful, I promise. Thank you both… But, what will you tell father after I am gone?”
Tony stood frozen in the kitchen, blurry hyper-focused eyes fixed on his father, who had just thrown a plate through one of their extravagant windows. The damage itself wasn’t bad, shattering one pane and cracking the few around it, but the air was thick and Tony could already feel his heartbeat in every part of his body. Howard moved to another cabinet, wrenching the wood off its hinges and casting it in his son’s direction along with all the china he could reach. The harsh impact of the door against the wall behind him shocked him out of his stupor and his body took off, leaving anything but instinct behind.
His peace was interrupted as he felt a sudden shooting pain through his right shoulder that lingered for a good 30 seconds, before dissolving into a more manageable but still deeply aching, down to the fucking bone. Breath choking through his throat and stars clearing from his eyes, Tony realized he was sprawled across the floor, clutching his shoulder in one hand and fingernails scratched through the wood floor. He took a shaky breath and brought himself up on his knees while fighting the urge to vomit.
“I am not obligated nor compelled to help you. I can explain why you are feeling pain, but only if you cooperate.” Loki leaned forward and narrowed his eyes, invading Tony’s already lacking personal bubble.
Rogers stepped in first, moving inside to start a fire deep on the other side of the room, his crouched figure almost enveloping the entire mouth of the fireplace. He reaches for slabs of wood as the fire builds, feeding the flame until it was a suitable size, moving to one side and waving Tony down beside him. Tony complied, rubbing warmth back into his hands while Rogers moved in the corner of his eye. A solid warmth settled on his back and he brought his hands up to his shoulders, burying them in the soft fur cloak he had felt on the way to his home now.
it. Someone to love him unconditionally, destined to be his other half, complete his soul. Just- someone who would love him because of who he was, not the power he held. Steve’s team was the closest thing he had to family -aside from Jarvis, Friday, and Rhodey- they held onto and truly cared for each other.
As promised, Obie released him to a room filled with enough materials to take out half the continent if they knew how to wield them. He was assured that once Rhodey was recovered enough, he could see him again. Obie’s promises were less than nothing, Tony had learned, usually the opposite would occur.
“Pull the muscle to the side and cut through if it’s already damaged,” Bruce chimed in. Tony gave him a withering glance and drew in a steadying breath, refocusing on the task at hand. He curled his fingers around the edge of a muscle group and pulled it to one side, revealing the torn muscle the arrow was embedded.
Tony is tortured by Obie for information, bringing in Rhodey (Tony's childhood friend) and severing his spinal chord as a punishment for not agreeing sooner. Tony begins working for Obie, but is also creating his own reactor, thinking of a weapon he imagined while in the North. He gets a reaction and cries himself to sleep. He misses Steve.
“Tony, can you take care of the Captain? I’ve kinda got my hands full here,” Tony looked over and saw the man’s arms were indeed full of a certain God, essentially cuddling the man while standing up and watching Valkyrie plaster over the wounds that hadn’t healed already. He turned his attention to Rogers who had unclasped his chest piece with some difficulty, unable to fully take it off. He rounded the table and kneeled behind the man’s wide back.
Huge violence and torture warning. Skip to end notes for a summary if you want to move past it quick.
Example of knowledge? Brought blueprints but somebody left his horse at the gate with his belongings.
They all looked at each other, somewhat confused before Steve responded for the group, “We’re just going on a perimeter run, we’ve heard some reports of Hydra in the area.”
“I didn’t come all this way to not even get in, dammit.” He placed a foot in one of the dips in the concrete and pulled himself up toward the top of the gate. His hands were protected by his gloves but he could still feel the rock cutting into his palms as he hefted himself up and over the rock wall. His feet hit wood as he dropped onto an inside platform, right in front of someone.
Loki crouched down in front of the group, looking at Tony for a moment, “Where are you feeling your pain, newcomer?”
Tony shoved his sleeves up his forearms fruitlessly, “You guys look ready for a war. Were you gonna leave without telling me-anyone?”
To assuage Hydra, he began a few weapons with small mistakes that would render them useless or explode in the user’s hand, only perceptible by engineers like himself. But in the moments that he was supposed to be rechecking his work, he sketched a weapon for himself, something he had thought up when he heard snippets of the technology Wakanda held. Bruce would kick his ass if he was there, for trying something so reckless, then he’d probably tell Steve and they would be banned from experiments again.
Interest in mathematics? A slight man with glasses asks this, obviously trying to bridge the gap between them, eyes lighting up when Tony nods his affirmation.
“I’m sorry about that Tony, I can assure you that your belongings will be taken care of,” his voice was surprisingly refined, plenty deep and gave a slight flush to Tony’s face and ears, “You may call me Captain Rogers, the man next to you is Thor.” He moves closer to the pair, allowing Tony a clearer look at the intricate symbols on his arm guards, “I’ve sent someone to bring in your things and your horse to our stables. And if you wouldn’t mind…” he leans against the table, lids low, “We want to know
The next morning proved uneventful, packing up and riding until the sun was gone, occasionally checking his map and the North Star’s location in the sky when night came. He was definitely heading in the right direction if the weather was any indication. He now wore his deep green cloak at all times, long black trousers and high boots protecting his legs, a red linen tunic that was opened at the neck. He fiddled with his gold piercings, turning them over and over again as the woods got thicker, the air got colder and the days seemed simultaneously longer and shorter. After a while, he stopped counting, his days blending together.
I'll add translations at the end of each chapter, but as the languages are old as balls, they won't be very accurate. Clint is deaf and Bucky is mute, so I'll add ASL translations when necessary too. Perhaps next we shall meet the team next?
“Hydra was waiting for us,” Steve rasped out. “Nat, I need you to find out who tipped us off that there was activity on the border, they were probably involved. And even if they weren’t, I want to see them.”
The sun had set and risen many times since he left home. He pulled his wool cape around himself more firmly, the air had gained a bite in the past few days and as reluctant as he had been, Tony had built a campsite with a small fire in it for those nights. It felt like he was admitting he wasn’t ready for this journey, he should have brought more layers, waited for a little longer, done something else. It was too late for regrets.
His uncle pulled a dagger from his tunic and passed it to Richard, “I have a permanent solution in mind. Unless, of course, you have /something/ to tell us now?”
He looked away from the door and caught Tony’s unamused gaze, “Oh! You mean about the lab… Well I can’t tell you everything, I just let the Captain know his newest recruit fell asleep mid lesson and might wake up aching if left alone.” He shrugged. “I left the lab after that, you are a really deep sleeper, you know?”
Stopping at a lower-mid notch, tip of the knife pressed between two vertebrae, Richard looked to Obie.
He didn’t know if Rhodey was still alive. He only had one idea of how to escape, but where would he go? His own father only wanted him as a successor to the family name and was willing to have him tortured to get him back. Howard didn’t give a shit- had never cared about him. All that mattered was results. When his mark had first appeared, Howard was unreasonably upset at the sight of it and had threatened to have it cut away. It wouldn’t have removed his soulmate from his life but it would have left him scarred and destroyed, guess his father got his way regardless.
The smile turned a bit bashful, Banner breaking the small silence before it could turn awkward, “You ready to eat? I was planning on making breakfast.”
Bucky’s shoulders were shaking and he was making a clicking noise in his throat that Tony assumed was laughter, but the murderous look he tossed Steve’s way was a bit off. It spoke of years of dealing with that kind of bullshit, not anger but eternal exasperation. Soon enough the whole room was cracking up at a joke that Tony wasn’t privy to but the energy of the room pulled at the corners of his mouth and he found himself smiling regardless.
Rhodey’s legs went slack first. His face was turned so that Tony could still see the agony etched onto his face, it fell away when the pain became overwhelming and his head hit the floor with a thud. Face slack and eyes closed, blood started pooling over his side and on the floor.
Tony felt his face flush in embarrassment. No, he didn’t know that. Back home- well at his old house, Howards presence and his own insomnia made him a very light sleeper.
His stomach twisted and the gnawing hunger turned to nausea, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve never had a friend in my life, never even met another person.”
Tony drew in a ragged breath and wailed, echoing down the hall and out of the building. If Rhodey was dead… he didn’t know what he’d do. But that fucking deal was off.
They began silently loading supplies into his bags, Tony’s heart rate jumping back up when the house settled, but focused on leaving. They snuck downstairs, past the now unoccupied kitchen, outside the house and to the stables. Tony almost objected, some staff would still be there, but Jarvis told him that no one would hesitate to help him, they knew this day would come. A dark skinned woman was waiting outside the barn doors, hair pulled back meticulously in contrast to the workman's clothes she had on.
Rhodey was held down by the shoulders, one man kneeling on his thighs, being thrown slightly akin to someone taming a wild horse as Rhodey thrashed. Tony knew from experience just how strong his friend was but seeing him still be able to jolt three men holding him down cemented it. Even when they were younger Rhodey would lift him up on his shoulders and run, being scolded by the town elders for roughhousing in town square. It was the best part of his childhood, bumps and bruises included.
Blue paint in an arrow over his right eye matched an ‘n’ over his pectoral and a bridge-like symbol peaked out from under his leather Pteruges. Slits in the leathery fabric revealed collums of thigh muscles, flexing lightly with each step and shift of the man's stature. Tony let his eyes drift over strapping abs, noticeably lingering on a red tattoo sprawled just above his belly button until a pair of bracer-covered arms overlayed his equally beefy chest, concealing yet another red hook shaped tattoo along his bottom of his pec. Metal and leather covered his heart and vital regions, along with his shoulders, he noticed as his gaze darted back up to the man’s inquisitive expression, waiting with a bemused expression.
Nat gave an affirmative noise, placing a red kit on each of the the end of each table, “Easy enough.”
“Don’t break his pretty little mind too bad. As loathe as I am to admit it, we need his intelligence.”
“Call me Steve here, my room is on the same floor as yours anyway. I’ll be back to get you for dinner, get some rest if you can.” The door swooshes closed behind him as he departs and Tony regards the fire once again. He pulled the cloak closer to himself and buries his face into it, the heady scent of musk and spice mixing with the woodsmoke in the room, relaxing him further. Eyes drooping, he absentmindedly rubbed the soulmark on his right pec to soothe the twinge he felt at being alone again. It had been strange to run away from everything you were, only to find the place you feared to be this welcoming.
Taking small pieces of iron, a makeshift battery and slivers of Palladium, Tony began making his own miniature nuclear reactor.
Tony awoke to the sound of footsteps traversing down the hallway outside his room. He blinked the sleep from his eyes and stared up at the ceiling for a moment, tracing intricate lines as he tried to recall exactly how he had arrived in his room.
“Tony?” Obie’s apathetic voice called his eyes back up, “Glad you’re still with us. How’s that deal sounding now?”
If you looked at her for too long, you could see the slight shake of Friday’s hands as she passed the reins to Jarvis, her eyes betraying her sadness at his departure. The three loaded up, helping Tony onto the horse and leading the way to the entrance.
Blue met brown and his face softened. “Here,” He reached backward and guided Tony to stand closer to him, placing an arm behind his shoulders and bringing the warm clothing to drape around his shoulders. Although they soon left the crowd, the arm stayed around him and honestly, Tony wasn’t about to complain. The captain however, noticed after their entrance to a residence reminiscent of his mansion at home and removed it with an apology too polite for Tony to get upset with him. The first floor had a communal kitchen, complete with a wood oven and stove top that nearly put his own to shame, a large living room adorned with comfortable places to sit or sleep and a strange glass on a wall, each room containing a large fireplace.
Why climb the fence instead of waiting for an answer? Impatience. It was cold out and he traveled far.
Tony spoke his next words slowly, picking them as carefully as possible to keep information to himself, “My relationship with my father has always been, let’s say rough, recently things got worse. A lot worse. Actually my mother died and kind of pushed him over the edge… I don’t really like to talk about it. In fact I hate talking about it. It’s just-”
“He throws the thing!” Sam cackled, nearly doubling over Scott, who pushed him back upright by the shoulders, “He’s too busy doing fancy twirls in the air and tossing it in front of the shots meant for his teammates to actually use the damn thing for himself.”
Faux sadness creased Obie’s face as an exaggerated frown crossed his face and for the first time, Tony truly saw his uncle.
Rhodey wasn’t dead. After his sustained screams of anguish and a fist to his already injured face, he saw his friends back rise and fall slowly.
There is some graphic violence in this chapter, it starts after the bold warning and ends after the sentence "Packing the bloody area"
Tony’s blood ran cold and he dropped the rag, freezing mid-stride at the sight of the man's chest. At any other time he would simply admire the large muscles, the strength visible in the bulk there. But right now, his eyes were trained on the image that rested on Steve’s left pec. It was a vibrant blue circle in the center of a golden triangle, which was surrounded by a gold circle.
Nuclear power was tricky and frowned upon in most places, the North was sufficient on solar and wind power. It wasn’t exactly banned but Banner had given him the third degree about not messing with atoms. He had told him how dangerous it was, how volatile the element was, but Tony never was one to play by the rules. As long as the danger was his alone, it would be fine.
Tony’s stomach growled at the mention of food and he quickly wrapped his arms around his middle, squeezing to try and quiet the noise, “I could eat.”
Tony kept his head down as his servants footsteps grew faint until they stopped altogether. His shoulders hunched and he began to shake with silent sobs. Tony’s mother was one of the only people left in his life that truly loved him, aside from Jarvis of course, now she was gone. His mind swirled with everything her death would leave him with; his father’s growing alcoholism, his uncle Obie’s increasing interest in his inventions and the money he would inherit. He wasn’t ready. She wasn’t supposed to leave yet. In many ways he felt like a child, relying on his mother to keep him safe, crying over her loss and hiding away in his room even when called for dinner. No one blamed him of course, no one who saw what the Stark family was like out of the public eye.
“How does it work? Who’s Banner? Why have I never heard of Wakanda if they are so advanced? There’s a-”
“It’s the only place he won’t be able to find you. Trust us.” Tony sighed, they had never steered him wrong before, he trusted them more than anyone else in the world. He brought the reins down and started his journey north, unable to resist turning his head back for one final look at his home. His mother was gone. It was time to start over, somewhere his father had no influence.
Tony almost hadn’t noticed when midday passed, but Bruce had been getting testy over the course of the morning and when the man dropped a vial of mercury on the lab floor, Tony suggested they take a break.
drama Rogers.” Tony says, shaking his head. “How are you even real.” and Steve laughs. “No seriously, this is soap opera level, you should be in show business. I’ve spoken to Pepper about our past, and not even
However, what finally made Steve believe him without a single shred of doubt left in his mind, beyond just time and the clear love he sees in Tony’s eyes when he looks at him, was when he had seen Tony’s face, watching Happy walk his daughter down the aisle at Morgan’s wedding almost four years ago. There had been nothing there but love, so clear and pure, seeming to light Tony up from the inside. Steve hadn’t been able to look away at that moment, because despite Tony’s red-rimmed eyes and nose, he had been beautiful.
Tony shakes his head, amused despite himself. "Don't look at me, honeybear. I've been here slaving over Pepper's paperwork since early morning." Tony picks up the sheaf of papers, waving it in Rhodey's direction to attempt to garner some sympathy. Rhodey appears to remain unmoved.
Either way, Steve finds himself leaving with his excuses around the fifth episode of the first season, heading back to his room. He needs something else to take his mind off things since TV shows don’t seem to be working, and it’s only after he’s broken out a good portion of his new art supplies sketching an intangible outline that he realizes the picture he’s drawing has morphed into Tony somehow, iridescent and glowing, pieces of the Iron Man armour on, hugging his slender curves, with the rest of it floating in pieces around him, a halo of protection and defense.
Wanda hums in vague agreement, turning to grab some glasses for drinks and bustling out of the kitchen, trailing magic-infused floating cups when there proves to be too much for her to carry in her arms.
“I’m sorry, what?” Tony looks up from his phone for the first time in the team meeting that afternoon in order to stare at Fury’s unimpressed face.
Steve doesn’t know how to react to this information. The fact that Tony apparently created an AI of himself before he died, because what other logical explanation is there, because this can’t actually be Tony can it, and who else could have
“I’m really sorry too, for what it’s worth.” he directs the sentence up at the lights and Steve snaps around to stare at Tony, gives him a look. “
“Heyyyy that’s pretty good.” Tony interrupts to comment. “A lot better than some other villain names out there, I mean we’ve got a Doctor Doom, we’ve got fucking Dracula, some knuckleheads decided
So like that, things progress. At some point, Steve goes to Manhattan for a day, considering the compound is still kind of removed from the busiest portions of the city, and visits Pepper and Happy in the SI offices, brings them some food, and they sit for a while and chat before Pepper has to head off to another meeting.
“I’ll call him again, try and talk to him, and you should too when he’s ready.” Pepper says, “Honestly, it sounds like he just needs a friend right now.”
He sinks down onto the blankets without another thought and pulls Tony towards him, places his hands on his forehead, and Tony is a million degrees - just as bad as being ice cold because Steve had seen those mortal healers at work,
If Tony’s entirely honest, he absolutely loves when he can go out to eat with Steve. Sure, he likes it back at the tower, but there's always so many distractions in that warm communal atmosphere that he finds it hard pressed to concentrate on any one person.
Steve doesn't really need to eat, never has, so his schedule generally proceeds from sleep straight to work. Although he'll admit there was a time long ago where he remembers that he did eat, just because he could. He can't fathom why he would do that now. It's a waste of time.
“Anytime at all, kid.” Tony says quietly, voice unbearably gentle, and Peter goes back to flipping through his textbook, happy grin plastered on his face.
Steve starts on the reports in good spirits, a tiny private smile curling his lips as he flips through the paperwork and realizes that a good portion of the reports have already been finished interchangeably in Bruce and Clint’s handwriting. The papers are still crumpled from the rough handling, and Steve smooths it out fondly as he adds in little details of the fight that his teammates had missed, and then finds the report where the writing cuts off and continues from there. That particular one is his personal report to Shield. All the Avengers had written and submitted one, since they’re working in cooperation with the fledgling organization, and it’s better for them as a whole if the tactical information is shared. Fury probably wouldn’t be too impressed at how distressed the paper is, but Steve doesn’t particularly care.
“Love you,” Steve whispers quietly against Tony’s hand, and he smiles happily in response. “Love you too.” he murmurs before he leans in.
“The intent behind both forms of magic was a malicious one and cast by the same powerful sorcerer. When you offered yourself up-” Strange gives Steve a stern look that he smiles sheepishly at. “-the spell made the transfer easily because of how compatible the two forms of magic were. It doesn’t care about after effect. Tony was already suffering in that moment. But you weren’t in enough pain. It was a loophole, albeit a useless one. Until now I suppose.”
The comfortable silence lasts for another two hours before Tony finally reluctantly shuts down his schematics.
Tony bounces up and down on his toes and Steve tries not to find it adorable. “It’s functional now Steve! And it can withstand your kingdom’s apocalypse level storms. Now all I need is like a day! Two days at most, fix some handholds so you can come with on a ride and…”
He freezes suddenly, when he somehow ends up in a very familiar hallway. It doesn’t hit him at first, just exactly where he is, because the place itself is rather unassuming, all polished linoleum floors and fluorescent lights, but Steve isn’t interested in the decor of the place. It’s the high tech door set into the wall in the middle of the hallway, one with a variety of sensors and scanners.
Regardless of his words though, Bucky promptly flings one arm around Sam and the other one over Steve’s shoulders, steering them out of the meeting room and down the hall.
So he keeps his phone shut off for the remainder of the time he’s in the lab, and he’s getting his frustration out, can feel his headache ebbing away, and everything is fine up until Agent Jin decides to hunt his ass down. Again.
“There’s only so much I can do with so little information,” Tony had muttered, looking frustrated. “The parameters are too wide. We’ll have to wait for Barnes and Wilson.”
during last weeks obligatory yay-we’re-not-dead tournament.” Bucky finally suggests, eyes sparkling with mischief.
He looks down at the staff, still gasping for breath. It's now as tall as him, lightweight and pitch black with a strip of blue glow that almost reminds him of the arc reactor light, a small logo printed on the end.
“No, no Steve, don’t worry, it’s nothing dangerous or bad. Yinsen...just...talk to him Steve. When you get the chance, talk to Tony.”
“Ugh.” is the response Natasha gets, the girl giving her a long suffering look and Nat laughs. “Bureaucracy is soooo boring, but it must be done to keep things running smoothly.” She intones the last bit in a dry voice. “At least that’s what the big Boss says. Well. Bosses. There are too many to count. We’ve had an influx of departures in the last few days, which is wonderful of course, God I’m so happy about that, those people arrived way before their time because of that evil, vile - GAH -”
At one point, and Tony’s not entirely sure who, but he has a suspicion it might actually be Pepper, Natasha and Peggy’s scheming that set this up (and isn’t
Steve feels like his heart is overfull as he watches Tony’s expression, captivated and unable to look away, watches it go from fear to disbelief to awe to softness and warmth, the brittleness from yesterday melting, and Steve
Logically Steve knows there was next to no blood in their actual deaths. That doesn’t stop him from feeling like his hands are covered with it.
“Oh shush you horrible person.” Steve obviously can’t see her, but he has a feeling she just stuck her tongue out at the phone.
try and convince you to something you know is wrong’” Cooper, Cassandra and Nathaniel continue, dramatically throwing themselves across the back of the couch at the word turkey.
“...Thanks Steve.” Steve waves him off impatiently, not wanting to be thanked for something that shouldn’t even be in question in the first place.
Pepper needs to get back to SI as soon as possible, apparently having dashed out of the middle of an important meaning as soon as she got the news. Happy is currently holding down the fort.
They updated him on the Tony situation and Thor in turn promises solemnly to head to Earth as soon as he possibly can, eager to see Tony himself. He’ll probably arrive in a couple of weeks. All the Avengers are excited, it’s been a long time since Thor has been back.
She helps him out with all of his different accounts. If asked, Tony will still assert that he’s doing this all under great duress, but he does begin to see the merit.
“Punk.” Bucky grumbles. “You’re a real idiot Stevie, and I’d whoop your ass over almost getting murdered by a homicidal Hydra agent, but it’s been three weeks and I’m too exhausted to bother.”
Tony cling wraps the coffee maker, the faucet and the fridge, puts sticky notes with a smiley face on the bottom of all the computer mice in the house, covers the TV with more sticky notes, switches out all the sugar for salt and then watches with barely suppressed glee as Steve and Natasha fill all the plastic cups in the house with water and place them in parallel rows all around the living room floor, just close enough that it’d be almost impossible to walk between them. It’s useful being incorporeal, because as they walk around they don’t have to worry about knocking any of the cups over.
"What you said hurt, I will admit, but I think I understand a bit more of where you're coming from now. It's understandable to be upset when someone comes to replace a person you've lost-"
“Tony?” she had said, eyes haunted, and the fragile quality of her voice is heartbreaking. Tony the AI gives her a warm smile, clearly knowing who she is, but at the same time, the smile is missing something that should be there for your former wife. Love? Familiarity? Steve didn’t know, and he didn’t want to think about it either, so he had given Pepper a quick squeeze of her shoulder and left the room.
“Daddy!” Morgan shouts happily, full of innocent joy, and she launches herself across the room. Steve tenses along with Happy, Rhodey and Pepper, because if she tries to hug Tony that won’t go well at
“Steve.” Pepper gives him a Look, and Steve sighs and meets her decisive and challenging gaze. Slowly nods.
“I’ll let you two ladies talk,” he says teasingly with a smirk at Steve, who rolls his eyes in good humour. Pepper sticks her tongue out at Happy, and he laughs as he heads out the back door as well.
“Hey,” Steve said softly that evening, finding Tony sitting near the lake, the drift of laughter and light from the house sounding distant in the background. “You okay?”
“Can you tell me what exactly happened?” Steve asks, changing the subject for the time being. “I was unconscious for most of the time I was falling.”
“I hate you all.” He announces to the room at large, hiding a smile, and goes to get another beer, the sound of good natured ribbing following him to the dining table.
“I gotta go let Addilynn know,” Tony suddenly stops to say, and Steve sighs, half fond and half exasperated, because of
“Nice apron by the way.” Tony comments amusedly after a minute of slightly awkward, but not unbearable silence, grinning at Steve’s chest.
The new Avengers operate smoothly as ever, with Sam calling the shots and Bucky as his second. They work as a well oiled machine, and Steve can't help but feel extraordinarily proud of them, and sad, at the echo of how it had been all those years ago.
The words slip out before Steve can stop it, low, angry and tense, and the comms go deathly silent, even as the battle continues. There's a moment's pause and then:
About five minutes later, the kitchen and dining room is bustling with people as Bruce greets Rhodey, Pepper and Happy warmly, Morgan talking happily at everyone and climbing all over Harley, the room filled with laughter and conversation. Steve is in the process of slicing up the loaves of bread Wanda had bought at a bakery a couple days ago and putting them in the bread basket, and he smiles as he watches everyone interacting and helping out. Rhodey and Happy carry out the pots eventually, dishing out portions into the bowls.
“Tony, you kinda were.” Sam cuts in, having gone back to his keyboard when he had determined that Agent Jin was ok.
He turns, weary down to the bones, but still searching, and he doesn’t really know for who at this point, just someone, Thor or Sam or Clint or Bruce or Bucky or Tony, for someone to smile at, to say
“Natasha,” Tony croaks, and clears his throat impatiently, “Natasha, get over here!” he yells, voice louder, and then launches himself at Steve, who stumbles back but finally catches himself, and hugs him tightly, so tightly, hands desperate on Tony’s back, as if holding him close will prevent him from disappearing, and Tony wants to reassure him, to tell him he doesn’t have to worry, but he’s kind of crying too hard to say anything of the sort, face buried in Steve’s shoulder.
“Idiots.” she scoffs as Thor booms about how Autumn’s might is superior to all those present, and t’Challa threatens to turn Mjolnir into a bouquet of spring flowers.
Tony’s the one who walks forward and offers Loki a hand up from where he arrived, sitting on their living room floor, funnily enough.
“So, you’re not swayed at all by pouts huh?” Tony says smugly, picking up their previous strand of teasing when Steve finally breaks the kiss, but only to a small distance, their breathes still mingling.
, but yet it reminds him acutely of what they had lost. Feeling invisible the entire day hadn’t exactly helped. He wipes at his eyes and stares out at the rippling lake water, the peace and quiet interrupted occasionally with a bout of quiet laughter and conversation.
“We’re not entirely sure what happened because Tony flew you to SHIELD medical and then had to book it before the press got here,” Bruce continues, and Steve can’t help but feel an irrational pang of sadness that Tony couldn’t be here, even though Steve knows there’s a good reason for it, that Tony can’t be seen by the public. “and the rest of the time we were concentrating on apprehending the rest of the villains, but by the time they got you stabilized you had severe chemical burns. The serum is the only reason you’re not dead.”
Steve goes to protest, thinking about the past, not being able to let go is kind of what got him into this mess in the first place, but Tony shakes his head sharply.
When he leaves the lab an hour later, he catches a glimpse of Tony before Steve steps out of the room, expression pinched and worried, arms crossed tightly in front of his chest, looking all the world like he’s just had his heart ripped out.
Steve snorts and helps Peter turn to a page in the notebook that isn’t covered with misshapen scribbles.
Half an hour later, everyone has migrated from Tony’s lab into Bruce’s, because Bruce is more familiar with the equipment in his own lab, and Tony apparently can pretty much go anywhere in the compound. Like FRIDAY, he has full control of the AI systems, all the technology in the place, and the Iron Man suits, although Steve can’t help but think that there’s probably not a system on this Earth that the AI couldn’t break into, considering.
It’s hard to care, as time drags on, as he loses track of it entirely. As he goes numbly from one duty to another, from one empty gesture to another. Steve tries desperately not to forget, not to fade, but it's difficult when he feels so detached.
They see everyone off when clean-up is finished, Morgan half-asleep on Pepper’s shoulder as Tony says goodbye and promises to see her again soon, Harley and Peter leaving with them when Happy offers to give them a ride back to their homes.
"It's not your fault." Steve responds, fierce. "These wounds will heal in a couple of days and I'll be fine, but we need to get to the bottom of this, make sure it doesn't happen again." He shakes his head, voice dropping. "She had nanites as well. I don't really believe in coincidences where this is concerned."
had Steve never tried to get him a better one, but his own bed is sheeted in ice, and Tony needs the warmth, so he covers him up and retreats back to his own side of the room.
,” Tony huffs, rolling his eyes. “Not your fault that is. Just believe me you stubborn ass, it’s not
Another subject kneels before him. They report what they will, and he watches them silently, pale blue eyes chilled to the core. He nods.
Tony stands there, hologram watching him, eyes glittering wetly and AIs can't cry right? but Steve swears he can see tears, and he feels horrible that they're there.
“Wow, seems like a party in here,” Steve looks up from making funny faces at Morgan to see Clint poking his head in, his joking tone belied by the worry in his eyes. “And I wasn’t invited? I think I’m a little offended.”
Steve doesn’t know why he does it, but his very first drawing ends up being of Tony. He purposely makes it very very ugly, and leaves it on Tony’s workbench for him to find.
At this point Tony’s still frowning slightly at Steve, but seems to have lowered his defenses a bit, no longer looking so ready to throw down at the slightest provocation.
"I'm-I'm fine...just...shit, probably some broken ribs?" Peter gasps out over the comms, breathing laboured. "I'll be ok, I-" he hisses sharply when he tries to move.
“Not funny,” she says, even as she starts giggling as well. At this point Steve can feel Tony also shaking with repressed laughter at his side. Even Natasha is snickering.
Tony gives him a shaky smile at the attempted joke. Steve wants to hug him, because he just looks so uncertain and shaken, but he can’t, so he settles for turning his body a bit, shifting closer to offer silent comfort. Tony seems to get what he’s trying to do because his smile becomes thankful before he forges on. “and I guess I just...thought the worse.” Tony meets Steve’s eyes sternly. “
There's a small rational part of Steve still screaming at him to stop, a last ditch effort, a voice of reason saying
Steve gets that expression on his face that means, ‘I would be rolling my eyes at you if I wasn’t so polite’. “So you want to tell me why Tara went upstairs to help me cook lunch but ended up mutilating a bunch of carrots instead?”
“You two are something else altogether. How you guys managed to lead a highly elite team of superpowered responders is beyond me sometimes.”
“I think we’re gonna be okay Steve.” Tony says once their laughter had died down, and Steve understands it for what it is, an olive branch, an extended hand in friendship, forgiveness all in one. He still thinks he’s been let off too easy, but he’s hardly going to complain.
"Ok sooo. Solutions guys?" Sam prompts again, awkwardly, and really there should be no room for awkward in a life or death fight, but somehow they manage it. Steve doesn't reply as he stabs his staff through a portion of the mass, and it crumbles away.
Tony shrugs, still staring blankly at the floor. His voice is flat when he talks. “Reassurance I guess. I overheard some of your conversation with Pepper.”
“How do you know my name?” Steve asks, voice hoarse. He opens his eyes but stares resolutely at the ground. There’s a chuckle from the AI, and Steve can’t breathe.
Steve tries to break free before she gets to too high of an altitude, tries to fight back, but her grip is like steel, hard and unyielding, the nano-tech lending her unparalleled strength, and he can feel the substance creeping off her arms to hold him in an uncompromising grip, crawling towards his neck, and there’s the dizzying flying and dodging she’s doing, the wind cold and merciless, slashing at him at breakneck speeds, and Steve can barely breathe enough to speak, can barely get enough air from the way he’s being crushed-
Tony watches Peter grow up too, become like a big brother to Morgan and he loves the kid like he's his own, making sure to attend his wedding as well, although he doesn't end up having children.
He gets shushed aggressively by all three of them when he tries to thank them, with Morgan giggling impishly in the background at Pepper’s following “Shut
He comes back at the end of the day to see the place transformed, to the stifling heat of a true blacksmith’s forge, the stone walls damp from melted ice. The heat washes over him and Steve stares at the vision of Tony sitting on the workbench to the side, shirt off, staring down sadly at his chest.
made T.O.N.Y, who else could have had the genius, the knowledge to do so, and the fact that he set the AI’s primary objective to look after all of them when he’s gone, to keep them safe, protect them, even after all the hurt they’ve caused each other, and Steve, just. He just
“Steve’s decked out like a little wife is what, all dolled up in lace.” Tony drawls, lifting his head from where he’s watching Harley draw, and smirking at Steve to the chorus of “oooohs” that take over the kitchen, Peter and Harley the loudest of all the Avengers. Tony raises an eyebrow at him, daring him to respond. It's a challenge if he's ever seen one.
Steve doesn’t get it. If following him around makes him unhappy, Steve doesn’t understand why he doesn’t just leave. Steve
a terrifying thought, the three of them talking is enough to take over the world), but there’s a suggestion that Steve and Tony should get married and make it official, to which Tony had responded that there is literally no point, they’re all dead, and Steve had shrugged and said it would be nice though, and Tony had given Steve the Unimpressed Look™, and Steve had given him the Puppy-dog Eyes™, and Morgan had smacked Tony on the arm and went
Steve, Bucky, Bruce, Sam, Peter, Harley, Clint and Wanda are currently gathered in the main living area as Tony talks with Happy and Pepper alone. Clint had already had his time to speak a bit with Tony, and is currently sitting with them on the couch, staring off out the window in shock.
It takes a while before anyone else of their makeshift family shows up, and Tony is glad because he wants them to live a long and good life. He watches his daughter grow up, restart a company, fall in love and have a family of her own, gets special permission to be at Morgan’s wedding with Steve and Natasha when that comes, and then again after she brings his granddaughter home for the first time.
And in turn Tony can blab on and on about his various experiments and Steve amazingly never seems to become bored. Sometimes Tony wonders if he’s even human, because it takes a special kind of wonderful to be able to deal with Tony’s constant jabbering. It’s warm and familiar and comfortable the way that few of Tony’s personal relationships are.
"Tony," Steve calls, broken, and he expects it when the door scans him, and doesn't even prompt him for a handprint or voice recognition, chiming out an
Steve laughs at Tony’s verbal fumbling, eyes bright. Picks up Tony’s hand and squeezes it. Shakes his head.
“That’s it,” he finally declares, after poking at one of the cling wrap toilets, “call in the reinforcements.” He says nodding solemnly at Bucky, who salutes with mock seriousness. “There is only one way to settle this.”
“Like, something wrong with the program?” Pepper says, understanding what Steve means even though he’s probably not being very eloquent at the moment. Steve pauses when he hears her reiteration, and squirms a bit uncomfortably. It sounds bad when it’s worded like that, as if Tony’s emotions could be attributed to a malfunction, but Tony had just looked so
The room is dark, and in the dim light, the outline of Tony’s hologram glows, a beautiful arc reactor blue. Steve can’t help but think he looks positively angelic, otherworldly like this, like he’s lit from within.
Although, when he’s sitting on the couch laughing at bad movie effects with the rest of the Avengers and Tara, chucking popcorn at the TV screen, with Steve sitting warm at his side, Tony has to admit that no matter how wide the internet may reach, it still can't really hold a candle to the real thing.
"Well no matter," he says amiably. "I've apologized, you've accepted it, and let's pretend that is that."
Y'all know I had to add in a DC reference because I'm honestly trash for both. Thank you all for reading! As always, comments literally give me life. :))))
“Thanks babe.” he patted Steve on the arm and then promptly went back to talking about the plan, and Steve nods along and hums in the appropriate places like the good boyfriend he is. Natasha mouths “whipped” at Steve again when Tony isn’t looking, which he resolutely ignores.
He grasps for a weapon desperately with the hand that’s still somewhat free, not entirely pinned by the grey substance, and his hand closes on the edge of the baton.
Steve rolls his eyes. “It’s been five days Pepper, I haven’t needed to “take it easy” since three days ago. And believe me I have. Clint hid my paperwork deep in the vents, I didn’t really have a choice.”
“Just shock.” Steve returns, flatly, gives him a bland smile. “I’m sorry if seeing the Iron Man armour threw me for a loop, since said owner of the armour is
"Good morning Tony," Steve says, putting his pencil to paper again, and shading in the trunk of a far off tree. "What's up?"
Agent Jin stares at Tony with a vaguely constipated look on her face characteristic of those who decide to trifle with the mighty Tony Stark, and finally gives a soft huff of laughter.
But Steve really doesn't want to be the one who welcomes him right now. Doesn't want that responsibility when he can barely keep himself together.
“Is Uncle Steve a mummy now?” Morgan suddenly asks out of nowhere, and Steve startles a bit before he starts laughing, Pepper and Bruce joining in as well. Morgan frowns at the lot of them, confused.
The plan itself is too convoluted to even have a chance at working but Tony will admit that the death ray seems to have merit. Not a bad design at all. And that’s saying something considering he’s the one saying it.
Peter tries to wave them all off when they go to help him, and finally reluctantly let’s Wanda lead him out of the door when she refuses to leave his side.
Until then though, Tony needs his time and space to just. Be. Do what he does best. Take his frustrations out on a hunk of metal.
“Duly noted.” he says. Harley squints suspiciously at Steve. “In fact, at this point I half expect you to grab a chair, turn it around backwards and start lecturing me.”
The kiss is unexpected, but not remotely unwelcome. Tony’s lips are warm, and it starts off soft, but then quickly sinks into something else entirely when Tony breaks it off quickly to push Steve until he unbalances and flops back onto his pillows.
They’re almost a month in. Tony collapses in the workshop, clutching at his chest, and Steve’s heart stops as he thinks,
He becomes aware of his surroundings slowly, registering the feeling of a blanket pulled up to his chest, soft sheets beneath his fingers, and the feel of bandages and a soreness that lingers at his throat and arms, hears the soft voices of conversation in the room.
“As long as we’re not fighting in an airport again.” Scott sighs, resigned, and the room rings with laughter.
The quinjet lands finally in the hangar, and the Avengers all file out to change. Steve follows the doctor’s orders, taking a shower with a wet washcloth for the time being. He barely even has to unzip his uniform to do it, the resilient cloth now pretty much in shreds from the acid, and where the doctors had cut portions of it away to get at his burns. He tosses it in the trash for now, vowing to get another one at some point, and decides he’ll apply the ointment later, before he goes to bed.
Rhodey laughs, and soon the courtyard is filled with the sound of well wishes and goodbyes (tearful between Morgan and Elle) as the luggage is loaded onto the back and Pepper, Elle and Rhodey climb in to make their way back across the border. They've got a Summer Kingdom to run after all.
And with that Tony says his ending spiel and Steve lets it wash over him, staring almost desperately at the hologram, drinking in this last glimpse of him. At the same time, in a rather contradictory manner, Steve finds himself wishing that Tony’s technology wasn’t quite so advanced and real, because it’s painful and bittersweet to see him there, alive and whole and healthy, and knowing that it’s all an illusion.
"You have a lot of history with human Tony I think." He says quietly. "Why don't you start at the beginning."
either. He doubts a human could survive in his kingdom, but yet here Tony is, chattering away in Steve's ear as he goes about his duties.
“-but the Avengers are gonna be here any minute now,” Tony finished with a raised eyebrow, “so I suggest you take your death ray there and skedaddle before they get here.”
I don't know what I was even-" and Steve is choking, vision blurring in front of him, and he squeezes his eyes shut desperately to find words, to explain, apologize.
Tony looks at him, surprised, and Steve feels horrible that the AI keeps having these little moments of insecurity, because he knows that it’s his fault. Steve realizes he wasn’t subtle at all about the fact that he missed human Tony desperately, understatement of the century, but that doesn’t change how he feels about the AI now. Tony is family, doesn’t matter what form.
you, how you made Wanda laugh properly, which is an almost impossibly difficult feat after Vision, how you gave Bucky tips on his arm so it stops hurting him as much, how you coaxed Bruce out of the lab so he could get something to eat, helped out Harley and Peter with their schoolwork when they needed it-"
and it rattled me. Actually that’s an understatement. It blew everything I knew to fucking smithereens. I left so I could process. And what you said about the malfunction thing...about being broken...this situation...it kinda hit a little close to home. I was just not in a good place yesterday; I already wasn’t thinking clearly, like
The rest of the Avengers already had a debriefing while Steve had been in treatment, and considering Steve barely knows himself what exactly happened when he passed out, he figures it’s probably for the best.
Tony grabs Steve’s hand and intertwines it with his, their rings glinting, and plants a kiss on Steve’s knuckles. They had discussed keeping the rings from their previous marriages on as well, but decided in the end to wear them on a chain around their necks as a reminder of what had passed.
Sam wolf whistles loudly, as Steve finally finishes undoing the straps, pulls the apron off slowly, and whirls it twice over his head like one might do for a shirt, whips it into the cupboard, his impeccable aim ensuring it catches on the clothing hook neatly.
Tony’s mouth drops open and the look of utter betrayal almost makes Steve start laughing again. “Stop that. No. That face is not allowed, stop, put that expression away, I’m banning that from the compound.” Steve looks down at his pencil sadly. “Oh my God STOP it, I swear to God you’re
on his workshop. Steve aches at the thought of what could have been lost, and what could have been cut free, and instead just nods in response to Pepper, who looks at him worriedly.
“The purpose of this is twofold.” he continues. “The press currently controls most of your public image, and opinions of the people can be swayed with the drop of a hat. I want you all to get a media presence that you alone can control. It will act as a counterbalance to all the shit that the press will inevitably say about you. It gives you a way to respond without a chance of outside people manipulating the information.”
Steve grimaces. “I’m not entirely sure...we were talking normally and then suddenly Tony just froze and started babbling, and I re-ran the entire conversation in my head but I can’t pick out anything I said that would be particularly upsetting? But there’s a possibility I inadvertently did without realizing-” Steve breaks off with a sigh. “I never say the right things.”
“I’m surprised how good you are at this,” Tony comments idly as he watches Steve put together a delicate piece of wiring, hands hovering as if he wants to help but can’t. “Even Bruce had trouble at times- wait careful there,
“Thank you,” Steve smiles as he heads back to check on the food, “Pepper, Rhodey, Happy and Morgan are staying to eat so I thought take-out might not be the most appropriate thing.”
, and suddenly hearing you say all that...well you can imagine how it sounded, and it played right into some insecurities.
Steve hums in agreement, lifting up the lid of the pot to check on the sauce. “So, how was training today?”
“Nonsense.” Pepper interrupts with a decisive look. “It’s already dark out and it’s been a long and exhausting day, there’s no reason for you to make the hour trip back to the compound when there’s room here.” Pepper raises a challenging eyebrow when Steve doesn’t move.
and he shudders like he can feel it, that phantom shifting in his atoms as they all crumble to dust, because this time there would be no quarter from Thanos. A gruesome echo of five years past.
to listen, and I have no idea if you're even there, or if it's already too late or-" Steve breaks off, unable to continue with that line of thought.
"We’re both worked up right now Steve." He says, voice wavering. "I need time to calm down, before we talk properly, and I’m sure you do too.” he gestures a bit to Steve’s tear-stained cheeks. “I don’t want to say something else that accidentally jabs at a sore spot, and vice versa. You two...seem to have a lot of history, and I want to understand."
Every petal that falls after that is another counting down a day. Soon Steve will have enough petals to make a full bouquet.
Next chapter is finally finished! Phew, that was a struggle and a half, though, I'm not very good at writing complex E M O T I O N S, so half the time I was curled around my laptop, just like how do humans function even? What is this?
Tony snorts. “As if I couldn’t forge your handwriting.” Peter and Steve both swivel to look at the AI incredulously, both with slightly worried expressions on their faces.
Occasionally someone will come and try and coax Steve into talking, worried about how he's retreating. Steve's reply every single instance is that he needs more time to process.
It’s the darkest hour before dawn when Tony’s breathing grows so weak against Steve’s neck, so weak that it’s barely there, and his pulse thumps feebly, and Steve knows he’s going to leave, this is the moment he’ll go-
, Steve had known him once, considered him a friend, shaken his hand - he had taken the throne by force, had been slowly weeding in his own people for decades without anyone noticing.
Tony stares at him, his eyes welling up with tears, and then lunges at Steve suddenly, pulling him into a tight hug. Steve hugs him back haltingly, enjoying the brief warmth before it’s gone.
It’s too late. It’s already far too late, and Steve wants to scream, wants to break down, wants to crack into a million shards of ice, wants it all to stop; everything he’s ever loved, shattering bit by bit. “I’m sorry.”
“Yes. I was young at the time.” Tony tilts his head down. “Wild. Careless. I didn’t give a shit about anything, not what I did or what other people thought. Not for any duty, and certainly not for my subjects. I wasn’t a good person. And I didn’t think much of the curse. We live for centuries after all. What could possibly kill us? Love? I thought it was ridiculous.” Tony murmurs sadly, smiling without humor.
“You can carry me sometimes,” she says magnanimously, patting Steve on the head. Steve laughs, and sets her gently back down on the floor.
Tony tells them as much, and Natasha and Steve both nod in understanding. They’ve all lost people. They get it.
Steve retreats to his corner again as the fire crackles merrily in the middle of his destroyed bedroom, unfazed by the cold surrounding it.
He likes Snapchatting the other Avengers and Tara because against what all evidence might suggest, it
Tony watches him curiously, asking incremental questions, to which Steve has great fun being contrary under the guise of his usual rigidity. Tony keeps squinting at Steve as if he thinks Steve is messing with him, but has enough doubt not to be able to confirm it.
Steve and Tony had been left to their own devices, moving around the various groups, and basking in the life and happiness of their friends and family. Once everyone had settled down with their food though, the topic had turned to current life events, and eventually to Tony, Natasha and Steve.
There are some tools tossed haphazardly on the workbench, never having been put away, and now that Steve looks closely, all the tables have gathered a thick layer of dust, after having been left undisturbed for, God what, almost seven years? Tony had taken FRIDAY, Dum-E, You and Butterfingers with him to the cabin with Pepper the first time they had failed to reverse the damage Thanos had wrought, when Thor had killed him. Five years later, Tony had arrived at the compound with the time machine already made, and the compound had other labs, so no one had returned here.
There’s a blur of sound and cold, and it’s dark behind his eyelids, but there’s panicked screaming of his name from somewhere, the identity hard to make out against the fog that’s in his head.
"So dramatic Rogers?" comes a weak sounding voice from behind him suddenly, and Steve whirls around, almost falls in his haste to turn.
“Oh don’t act dumb.” Tony says dully. “I’m not broken, so you can stop your little speculations with Pepper. I get it. I’m an AI, but I’m not gonna just kill you all in your sleep, so you can unclench.”
“I know what you’re about to say Steve, and there’s no need to defend me from self-deprecation, because that’s not what I’m trying to communicate.” she pauses to gather her thoughts. “What I mean is, I can’t be the one to judge you on this, not really, because I’m not Tony, and I’m not any of the Avengers involved in that entire fucked up mess.”
Tony flickers out with a small smile, and Steve lies down, falling asleep almost immediately despite his injuries, exhausted to the core.
Anyways, he’s in the middle of fiddling with a schematic trying to figure out how to fix a problematic design flaw, and really you’d think he would find designing things easier in the Afterlife just on principle but apparently not, when there’s a clearing of a throat from behind him. It sounds very very familiar. Tony knows that uncertain tone, would know it in his sleep, the same way he knows Pepper’s disapproving but fond looks, and Rhodey’s exasperated laugh. Tony whips around to see Steve there, young again, staring at Tony as if he’s seen a ghost which, well, technically.
“There will be no arguments, do you understand me? You have been fighting non-stop for the last two weeks, and none of you have went to medical in that time frame. I refuse to believe there are no injuries. I want the defenders of Earth to be hale and healthy, and I assure you, you most definitely won’t be if you skip the medical checks
Sam gives him a considering look. “We should have a small celebration, now that you’re back,” and Steve can feel himself stiffening slightly.
Steve wrinkles his nose. “And yeah, I apologize for that actually, because I shouldn’t contribute your emotions to a programming thing, now that I think about it, that’s a very very shitty thing to do, and I’m sorry for doing that. But it was just an errant thought, and I didn’t mean anything bad by it, I
, something Steve’s long forgotten. That rush of adrenaline through his system, that high of going at breakneck speeds.
“There’s a chance that it’s not the right person,” Sam affirms, “but our odds are good; she fits the profile we have on her to a tee.”
“Steve.” he looks up to see the AI kneeling in front of him, hand hovering as if wanting to touch him, but of course Tony isn’t solid. His eyes are worried. “You with me?” Tony asks, and Steve swallows. Nods slowly.
“We gotta get the visits out of the way first,” Tony says distractedly, eyes sparkling with excitement. “You know, seeing everyone, making sure they’re not fucking up too badly and all that…” and Steve exchanges an amused look with Natasha as he steers Tony away from the pole he had been about to walk into. Tony blinks.
“How’s Rhodey doing?” Steve asks curiously. They’ve finished all the oreos, so Steve has started fiddling with the plate.
“Why are we doing this?” Steve questions, as Tony maneuvers him. Or as much maneuvering as he can do considering Steve is taller and heavier than him.
“Did you?” Steve’s voice is hoarse, so he swallows determinedly before continuing, wanting to know what the inside of the lab is like now. “Did you or Rhodey or Happy?” Pepper shakes her head, subdued, and puts away the cups before joining Steve in leaning against the counter.
Instead, Steve will occasionally see Tony talking or bonding with the other Avengers, joking around with Bucky(now that Steve thinks about it, they do have remarkably similar personalities), poking fun at Sam as he trains in the gym, following Bruce around as he does his experiments and helping him run calculations, laughing with Wanda and Harley as they watch re-runs of Friends.
Steve frowns slightly at him, a bit taken aback that he was listening, but then again, Steve supposes that makes sense.
“I’m a selfish man Steve. I was when I met you in your castle of ice, and I am now. You deserve someone better, someone whole, someone
Oop. Nope, no, too confrontational, and now Tony looks angry, the expression breaking past his tense facade. Steve lowers his voice to an agitated murmur. “What the hell was I supposed to think, when you just suddenly froze and started babbling, and then
“Better,” Steve says, smiling and helping Peter up, who seems slightly winded. “Why don’t you take fifteen, and then we’ll come back and keep going.” and Peter nods, darting off to get some water.
His limbs aren’t as strong as they used to be, and they feel weak as a lamb’s as he keeps plodding through snowbanks, as he keeps pushing onwards even though he can no longer breathe too deeply and has to take frequent breaks.
“You were so handsome and charming and kind when I met you that one time as a child. The perfect king. I resented you every time I couldn’t measure up, resented you everytime Howard couldn’t see past the shadow of you to me. It was hard, when my own father left to go look for you without a second thought. It was harder when I landed all that time ago in your castle and saw you there, alive and well and uncaring while my own life had fallen to pieces.”
There’s a chorus of tense greetings over the comms as the rest of the Avengers realize that Steve’s on scene, and Sam fills him in as he joins the fight.
Tara shakes her head, trying to hide a smile. “Awww, the Avengers are protecting their tiny engineer.”
“Marry me.” Tony mumbles, slumping down onto the floor against the cupboards next to the stove and hugging his cup of coffee. “You glorious bean, I’ll treat you so well, I’ll buy you all the best containers for you to sit in, the wedding will be glorious, we’ll get married in Paris at sunset.”
“Shit.” Scott summarizes eloquently. Steve wholeheartedly agrees with his sentiments, and judging by the atmosphere in the room, so does everyone else.
Now that Steve has a moment to himself to think, the emotional rollercoaster of today seems to really hit him, smashing into him a hundred miles an hour like a freight train, finally pierces through the numbness that had set in, the soldier mindset of
“Her name is Pearl Jeffreys” Sam says tensely, as soon as Steve takes his seat at the table after nodding a greeting at everyone.
It’s only a couple minutes before Tony is thrashing again, kicking off the covers, whimpering helplessly, and Steve feels something inside him roil at the sight of Tony in so much pain, moves forward enough to hear the mumbles, “burning up - air - I can’t -”
He steps inside hesitantly, and sensors register movement, lights clicking on all throughout the lab one by one. Almost like it’s lighting a path.
“Hop to it Rogers, left right left, come on.” and Steve gets up with a sheepish smile, and follows Pepper and Morgan inside.
Steve laughs and rolls his eyes, deciding it’s best not to mention that he purposely stepped into her trajectory to shield Wanda and Scott.
something he had said? He should definitely apologize in that case, but at the same time, he doesn’t even know what he did wrong in the first place.
He hops onto the helicopter with a bunch of other SHIELD agents, inserting a comm into his ear, assorted weapons strapped at his hip and they arrive quickly on site. He doesn’t wait for anyone, and throws himself into the fight, moving civilians out of the way along with the other agents, who are trying to secure the location.
“Well,” Steve begins after a moment's hesitation. Tony finds himself admiring how the afternoon light makes Steve’s pale skin and hair glow. He looks beautiful. “I think...I want to take you out on a date.” and Tony starts to smile.
“Watch it Cap.” Tony warns, “You can only push Aaron Burr so much and then...” He makes two finger guns, points them at Cap and makes a couple pew pew sound effects.
Steve turns and full on runs, bursting out of his room down the halls, down to the lab, terrified and panicked and anguished and guilty, skids to a stop in front of that unassuming hallway, those doors that are now locked and shut just like he figured it would be even though they had been completely open for the past week.
Thank you to all those in the comments that gave me suggestions for Tony's name, they were all wonderful, but I think I'll keep it the same for now? Just because I don't really intend to mention what the abbreviation stands for again so yeah XD.
He opens the door to his room, his still numb hands barely registering the texture, and walks calmly down the hall, not expecting it when he's grabbed from behind and whirled around to face the man, who's now looking irate. His hands on his arm are warm, warmer than anything he's felt for a long time, and Steve jolts as his skin tingles with it, comes alive underneath the man's touch.
Tony was in his workshop in the place he shares with Nat, fiddling with things, because clearly a heaven can never be a heaven for him unless he gets to tinker. He’s very glad that the laws of physics behave in the same way in the Afterlife as it does on Earth, although he supposes there’s no reason for it not to. He misses Friday, Dummy, Butterfingers and You like he misses a limb, and has already re-created their code, but he’s not entirely sure he should activate it. It’s an ongoing debate.
"Very advanced." She says, shaking her head. "Absolutely gorgeous coding. I'm definitely impressed, and it takes a lot for me to say that." She gives AI Tony a sad smile, who smiles back at her. "I wish I had gotten to meet your creator. He seemed remarkable."
Tony raises a hand to tap at his chest, his fingertips clinking against the hard surface. “This is something I invented - an arc reactor. It slows the progression of the curse, even though it can’t stop it.”
Steve laughs and slips into easy conversation with Pepper, about the happenings at SI, about the Avengers, everything. They’ve haven’t had a lot of time to just talk after all, Pepper’s busy schedule making it difficult to fit in even just a phone call at times. It had been simpler when Steve lived with her and Morgan, but now all they can really do is have a brief talk whenever they’re able.
“Oh come on,” Tony laughs, when Steve pushes a coffee cup into his hand, smirking. “What are you, her Tony ambassador?”
Bucky tows Steve around the compound after that, saying hello to people and letting them know they're back while simultaneously catching up with each other on current events. Steve talks to Bucky often enough, but it's not the same over the phone.
Tony looks around at his teammates slightly incredulously. Clint is fiddling around with his bow while Natasha sharpens her knife idly. Sam seems to be in the middle of typing new code, the Hulk is munching on something that he most definitely did not have when they entered the meeting, Thor is cleaning his hammer and Steve is diligently taking notes.
And there’s another part of him that seems just to be mad at the AI, even though it’s even more illogical, because he hasn’t
“I feel like Jarvis should be greatly offended at your lapse in memory.” Tony glances guiltily at his ceiling. Despite his protestations to the team that Jarvis does NOT live in the ceiling, he seems to have picked up their bad habit of talking to it nonetheless.
she is, and she understands and remembers more than most, but at the same time she’s still just a kid and she’s
“Um...technically? Yes, because I can multitask, but also no.” Tony says. There’s a brief pause and then:  “holographic me is currently helping Peter with his homework, and by helping, I mean watching as Peter insists he can write things without the function of a right hand, and stubbornly refusing to let me record his answers electronically.”
With Pepper’s smarts and armour, and Happy’s knowledge of the security of the building, they never stood a chance. There was everything under the sun, the more notable ones being; sticking all the furniture of the living areas to the ceiling, sticky noting all the vehicles in the compound (the non-Avengers business ones, just in case there was a need for the quinjet), covering all the currently in use bedrooms from floor to ceiling with pictures of Mr. Bean intermixed with memes, and cling wrapping all the toilets.
“Daddy used to say he’d take me there one day to see the exhibits.” She says quietly, and Steve abruptly feels like he just got punched in the gut. She’s so smart, she’s Tony’s daughter so
“I look hot in this jacket. A thread is all you’re getting Steve.” Tony teases, but then falls silent as Steve drops the thread in, and a plume of smoke explodes up. When it finally clears, the liquid in the bowl shows an image, a beautiful red haired woman, leaning up against a stone wall.
“Just out of curiosity,” Tony asks quietly, finally breaking the heavy silence. “were you and human Tony ever this shit at communicating?”
It’s late by the time dinner actually ends, everyone lingering around the table to talk, and then pitching in when Bruce gets up to start clearing the table, the clean-up becoming a family event in the process.
“Well you all seem like you’re having fun here,” Bucky calls from behind Steve, and he whirls around.
It’s held at Tony’s cabin by the lake, the place where he’s had so many happy memories with his family, where he got to live out a short normal life before it all went to hell. The whole planet is mourning today, with wakes being held all over the world for the man who had saved them all, had sacrificed everything for them. But for the actual funeral, the gathering is very small. The people closest to him, his friends, family, all those people whose lives Tony had touched.
“Scan complete. Captain Steve Rogers, confirm voice recognition and handprint.” the same computerized voice says, and this time Steve puts his hand on the palm print.
1. I realized that I've been using the word nano-tech when I really meant nanites, aka I'm a dumb bitch and forgot that nanotechnology could be referring to anything really, as my uni professor had stressed at me, artificial lipid bilayers are called nano-tech too, so just. Ignore that? I'll possibly get around to fixing that when I have the time lol.
,” she says, beckoning Steve into the house, “how would Steve ever get anything done? And you wouldn’t ever get to play with your friends again would you?”
The mood in the room after Tony, Pepper, Clint and Rhodey finish their explanation is already somber. It only sinks further when Bucky voices the question of
Steve paces around restlessly for an entire hour after that, unable to keep still, feeling like his skin is crawling with guilt. He needs to go apologize
“Alright, alright.” He says finally, poking Steve in the side. “Enough sappy staring, we got work to do. Move it you lumps.” then he pauses, and narrows his eyes at the book Pepper is reading before snorting.
He puts his hand over hers on his shoulder. “No, no I’m good. I just. I don’t know where to go first.”
Despite Tony’s reassurances at the beginning, Steve had still been very worried about his reaction to Pepper moving on, even after breaking the news to Tony and him reacting very positively, which of course had caused a considerable level of tentativeness and a bit of strain at the beginning of their relationship. To be fair, it took awhile before Tony really believed Steve about Peggy’s situation as well, so it wasn’t only him that was skeptical and holding himself back.
Steve sets down the newly brewed carafe of coffee that Bruce handed him to put on the table and goes to get the whipped cream and syrup, but Sam stops him before he can move away. Sam gives him a questioning look, Bucky watching the proceedings from where he’s sipping from his coffee cup, eyes worried. Steve takes the looks for what it is, them checking in on if he’s truly okay, how he’s joking happily now with Tony and if it’s only an act, if he needs to get away like he had been doing for the last week.
Tony laughs more here too, singing loudly as he works, dances around the floor as he waits for re-molded armour to cool, drags Steve up from his perch on a workbench and manhandles him about the room in the semblance of a waltz.
“And Tony, Tony was - he -" Pepper breaks off at that, unable to continue, lip trembling, and Steve finds himself putting a comforting arm around her as she breaks down on his shoulder, the strong shell finally cracking.
“I don’t think I’m in love with Pepper anymore.” Tony says contemplatively one day, as Steve is once again sketching, and Tony is working on his armour. “I keep trying to figure out how I possibly survived, how this all happened, and maybe…”
"And what are you up to now?" A voice asks from the doorway. Tony's head snaps up to see the warm gaze of his husband watching them amusedly from the open door, blue eyes sparkling.
“Don’t worry. You’ll like the ending of this one. Hopefully.” Tony draws in a shaky breath and pulls further away from Steve to sit up at the edge of his bed, looking like he’s steeling himself. Curious, Steve doesn’t follow him up, remaining where he is.
- looks over at Steve and raises an eyebrow at him, the expression so familiar that Steve’s knees almost buckle.
“See, this is why Agent Jin had trouble.” Steve continues, amused smirk softening into a genuine smile. He pokes Tony in the shoulder, and Tony swats at him halfheartedly. “She doesn’t know how to negotiate with you.”
Pepper nods in understanding. “Well then, plain old Steve Rogers,” she emphasizes the title by raising her eyebrows at him again. Morgan mumbles in her sleep, and Pepper smooths a hand down her back again, shifting her hold on her in preparation to stand.
Steve allows himself to be instructed, watching Tony amusedly all the while, listening to him monologue, because it’s undeniable that he’s in his element here, surrounded by his own creations and genius, thoroughly entrenched in his math equations. It’s awe-inspiring to watch him work, flitting around the lab almost like a magician, although Steve makes a note never to compare what Tony’s doing to magic, because boy will he rant, but that’s exactly what it looks like to Steve. Magic.
Natasha peels off from Steve and Tony when they finally bid Peggy and her husband goodbye after promising to visit again soon, citing that she wants to go fix up their disaster of a garden back at their place.
The day of the funeral dawns bright and gorgeous. Despite the general belief that funerals should be nothing but somber, Steve can’t help but think it’s fitting for Tony’s send off to be on a beautiful morning like this.
They finally make their way through most of the events happening until the present day, and Tony throws an arm around Nat in comfort as the Screen shuts down.
“Yes as far as I know, although she is visiting more often, and goes to see Director Fury whenever she can. It’s kind of hilarious, the few times I’ve been down to the new Shield headquarters she’s there causing havoc with Goose.”
Steve is the only one who even resembles being fully awake, and is standing at the stove flipping pancakes. He’s wearing a ridiculous frilly pink apron.
“Ughhhhh the suspense is killing meeee.” Tony drags a hand down his face dramatically, earning a few amused looks from passing spirits. He gives all of them a small smile.
Pepper and Happy pull Steve aside after their talk with Tony, who is now speaking with Bruce one on one in the corner of the room. Steve can't tell if he's just deciding to have heart to heart talks with everyone or if it's just casual conversation, but he hopes it’s the latter one. Steve’s not sure he can handle a heart to heart at the moment.
Tony had arrived back to his kingdom just in time to see the last of those loyal to the Stark lineage taken away in chains, on their way to execution.
watched those stupid PSA’s?!” Steve asks loudly, flailing his arms a bit. There’s a moment of silence, and then;
“Oh believe me, it very much wasn’t.” Steve says, the mirth in his voice probably belying his words.
The greetings as everyone files into Steve's room at about 3 am in the morning is tearful, loud and warm.
The numbness in his hand and arm doesn't leave no matter how much Steve rubs at them, so he finally ends up ignoring it entirely, staring instead at the play of flickering light across the icy floor. The flames are mesmerizing to watch, smoke drifting in lazy spirals out the window Steve had cracked.
Tony nudges Steve in the side with a smirk, and Steve rolls his eyes, before planting a kiss on the top of Tony’s head and dragging him and Nat down from the ceiling to follow behind.
“Does it...hurt a lot?” the question comes, quiet and subdued, Tony’s voice tentative. Steve hums again, thinking.
"Chemical self-destruct is my guess." Bruce says in answer to Steve's unspoken question as he walks forward to stand beside Steve. Comms are dead.
Steve glances around the conference table and then frowns as his gaze falls on Tony. Everyone is grim, but he seems almost the most tense out of all of them, anger smoldering in his eyes and rigid angles etched into the line of his body, the rest of his face an uncompromising mask of neutrality. He looks. Well, frozen is one way to describe it.
Tony interrupts himself with a yelp of laughter as Steve suddenly picks him up as easily as anything, walking over to deposit him gently on their bed.
me, better than anyone else I can think of, and I knew her and I doubt there even is a word for what we were. At the beginning I just kept wondering if I had traded one for the other, the fact that she sacrificed herself so that I could return to my family, if I was horrible for it, being happy when Laura, Cooper, Lila and Nathaniel returned-”
Clint snorts, and wipes at his eyes. “I don’t know what the fucking hell she was talking about. She was always the best. The best out of the two of us even if she couldn’t see it.”
“True,” Wanda agrees, following after him. “Morgan’s grown so much since I last saw her, I almost don’t recognize her.” she says fondly.
Tony's managed to cannibalize some of Steve's thinner blankets and sew it to the inside lining of the gold and wine red jacket he had been wearing under his peculiar armour. It appears to make him warmer, so Steve doesn't say anything except go find him some more blankets.
truly leave, not beyond bringing about winter to the mortal realm, none of his people can. The borders don’t allow it, but there’s nothing holding Tony here.
The voice is close now, whispering in a panicked way as gentle fingers smooth his brow, and he tries his best to follow instructions, tries not to shift again.
“And...you’re okay? Y’know…” Steve wrinkles his nose at the wording but he can’t think of any other way to say it. “...systems-wise?”
“There it is, that PSA smile, the face of pure evil.” and Steve laughs along with the three of them.
, can’t school his face into something normal and he feels almost too full, bursting with everything, and Steve thinks he’s probably half hysterical at this point, and this is what it feels to be drunk, oscillating between extreme emotions.
Steve steals away to go visit the figures of Natasha, Sam and Bucky when Tony becomes distracted in the forge, because he needs to. He needs to mourn them the way he hadn’t been able to before.
inside the empty cavity of his chest, at the thought of Tony dying, Tony ceasing to exist. He can’t figure out what it is, but it’s a twinge and it hurts.
The recount of what had happened in the time Steve was out courtesy of Nat, Bucky, Sam, and literally every single person Tony has ever spoken about during their conversations - Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, Clint, Bruce, Thor, Nebula, Peter, Harley, Shuri, t’Challa, you name it, they’re here - is as fantastical as Steve would expect it to be.
Oh yes, the song Tony sings is "Wait For It" from Hamilton, because I thought it was rather on brand with Tony's backstory :)
Wanda laughed softly in response, shook her head. “Don’t worry,” she said, a small secret grin gracing her face. “They’re never really far. They never really left.”
He laughs at Tony’s response as he unscrews the ointment and starts applying it gently, wincing every once in a while when he presses too hard. He does this in silence for a couple of minutes, concentrating on getting all the areas, so he understandably startles slightly when Tony breaks the silence again.
Steve stands from his throne and watches silently as his guards carry in a slim shape of red and gold. It’s hard to make out what he’s looking at from his vantage point - the hall is massive - but as they approach, Steve finds himself pausing suddenly before the steps of the dias. The messenger told him they found something.
“Not your fault Steve.” Tony whispers, shaking his head. “It was a perfectly mundane sentence. You couldn’t have known. Hell,
Steve watches them unhappily. He has rather mixed feelings about this, ranging everywhere from elation from the fact that in a way, they got Tony back, to melancholy and guilt at the previous thought and the knowledge that the AI is still exactly that. An AI.
"Would it be okay for me to stay here for a while?" The man seemingly pops up out of nowhere to ask the question as Steve steps back into the great Hall, having returned from more reports of his subjects succumbing to the cold. The numbers are great now, and the kingdom almost empty of life.
There’s a couple of angry grumbles from where Peter’s face is still buried in Steve’s chest and Peter’s hand (the one not in a sling) comes up and smacks Steve on the arm.
“Um.” Steve says. “So...you know that thing human Tony used to do when he was deeply upset over something, and would avoid all human contact and lock himself in his lab for hours on end, and sometimes it was better to go find him as soon as possible and talk it out with him, but other times it was better to just let him be and think through it himself, and I was never really that good at noticing which one of these moods it was, so at the beginning of our friendship I would fuck up quite a lot?” Steve asks in a rush.
Afterwards Morgan shouts about going down to play at the lake, so Happy follows her as she runs out the back door.
It's one of the bad days. They have been getting fewer and farther between, but they’re still there, occasionally popping up when Steve least expects it, catching him off guard.
He lets himself zone out for a bit as he stares out the window, still shaking off the remnants of sleep, before he decides to get a headstart on his morning routine. Steve heads back to his room to change for a run.
and at this point Steve doubts it will ever stop, but it no longer feels like a vice tightening on his lungs, choking him.
“ -teve, Steve!” a voice calls, as if from very far away, and Steve ignores it because he can’t process any outside information right now, he can’t he can’t he can’t
“Sorry,” she says, amusement lighting up her eyes, removes her hand before her expression shifts to something more serious. “It’s okay. Look, I’ll admit. I was kind of furious when I had heard what had happened.”
“That's it, both of you, get out of my tower. Leave.” Tony says, then squawks when he’s grabbed by the arm and dragged across the lab towards the exit by a very enthusiastic SHIELD agent.
Steve’s not even remotely ready to deal with this, can barely wrap his head around everything that has happened. From the moment of his impromptu panic attack on the floor of the lab to now, he feels like he’s walking through a fog, like he’ll wake up eventually and find out this was all a bizarre dream, brought about by his grief.
It changes though one day, when Steve finds Tony asleep beside the dias after he sends the last of his audiences away. No way around it, Steve picks Tony up, gasping as warmth floods his arms and chest from where he’s cradling Tony’s figure. It’s startling and a bit painful after the numbness, so Steve darts quickly down the halls, hurriedly depositing Tony on the pile of blankets near the fire and throwing the covers over him before Tony can freeze more.
of the kindness he's been shown, because he had taken all of that and smashed it to smithereens, had been so entitled and selfish, focused on himself, ignoring Tony with no explanation, and Steve realizes a part of him has been seeing an object there the entire time simply because it's been too painful to see a person.
Tony? Does he seem like the type to just ‘forget’” Clint does air quotes around the word to emphasize it. Steve has to admit he has a point there.
“You know this means war.” She says to Happy, eyes glinting mischievously, and he shakes his head in response, grinning, “I’d expect nothing less. I suppose we’re bringing Rescue out of retirement?”
Steve watches his best friend enter and stumble around the kitchen for a minute, half-asleep and for once unaware of his surroundings before clearing his throat to make his presence known.
They have a goal, Steve’s almost sure they do, but right now there’s no detectable pattern, just seems to be a bunch of...disorganized destruction.
that it might as well be an actual law at this point, given how you all just seem to be perfect robots.” Tony says, typing in a 48 digit password without even looking. He also quickly hacks into the website to up the security of the Avenger accounts. Tara watches him do all this with wary resignation. “And this is coming from a man who builds AI’s and machines for a living. You are all too android-like. I don’t trust it.”
Tony had said, nudging Steve and Natasha smugly) and then proceeded to prank the shit out of the rest of the Avengers (most of which were out for the day, although Bruce apparently remained in the compound laboratory).
an interesting idea) and Tony listens as Steve talks about the various people he’s met around and how he’s picked up art again.
He pays no mind to the fact that his hands are smeared over with pastels, that his white shirt is covered in the pigment, that there’s red and gold
Steve, you were one of the many people featured on the ‘Tony makes very bad decisions’ show. Probably half of New York has been wrongly accused by me at this point. So there, you’re not
“You don’t feel.” Tony smiles sadly, reaching up to brush away a strand of Steve’s hair. “The Winter King lives up to his name. I’m a selfish man, Steve, and I’m scared. I don’t want to die in isolation, even though I should. You don’t feel. And I needed that when I first crashed here. I can’t be the reason for hurting another person. Better for Pepper and Rhodey to think I’m off being irresponsible. Better for you to be unaffected when I’m gone.”
“Original flavour Tony?” Tony snorts in response, unbothered. “The fuck is he, Pringles??” and Steve relaxes incrementally, stifling his laughter with the hand that isn’t flipping pancakes.
Steve tries to swallow, throat working, then turns and leaves the compound, unable to face everyone the way he is right now.
everytime you see me. You know that you do that? Look at me in that way that says you hate the sight of me, hate that I'm here, and I don't even know what I've fucking done. What is your
There’s snapchat notifications and facebook friend requests and dozens of different messages from everyone and Tony takes one look at it all and shuts off his phone entirely.
“Do you hate me now?” Tony finally breaks the silence, laughing through his tears then, as if he’s made some grand joke.
“You’re going down, old man.” Harley smirks at him, and Steve feels a well of fondness for the kid, at how similar Harley’s brand of snark is to Tony’s.
Decision made, Steve firmly puts the issue out of his mind for now, and heads towards his room, intending to catch up some mission and tactical reports that he’s behind on. He had tried working on them in the five days it took to heal up, but had always been conveniently called away by one of the other Avengers. When Clint had come to visit, he had found a couple of his files missing, and discovered them stuffed in a vent.
“Harley,” Steve then calls, and Harley looks up from where he’s been typing away on his phone in his gym clothes, half paying attention to Peter and Steve’s sparring match. “You’re up champ.” and Harley gets up with an excited grin, stepping onto the mats.
“The only reason we haven’t encountered more of these incidents,” Sam continues in, pulling Steve’s attention away from their resident AI genius, who is doing a pretty good job of mimicking a stone statue, “is because the tech itself ain’t cheap. Not everyone can afford it, and not everyone knows about it. And most importantly, no one seems to actually know who or what the source is.”
Steve snorts a bit, tries for a joke. “They’re trying to get here during New York rush hour? Good luck.”
“Wanda’s training is kind of above my pay grade,” Steve continues, and Pepper laughs, “although I have been teaching her hand to hand combat, just in case anything were to ever happen.”
The mass drops like a stone, slamming to the ground with a deafening crack, a million tons of who knows what sizzling on the city streets.
“And now?” Tony purrs, and Steve swears he can’t stop the eye roll if his life depended on it, uncharacteristic as it is, because if he doesn’t do that, he might do something else stupid. Like grab Tony and kiss him. Or melt into a pile of goo.
“Sir, I think Tony has a point with one of the objections he raised.” Tony has to resist the strong urge to yell “HA” in the SHIELD Director’s face.  He settles for grinning smugly instead. Fury pointedly ignores him.
Steve glares at Tony. “Stop trying to ask me for permission. Not my place. Turn the Iron Man armours into a beer float if you want to.” and Tony laughs again, surprised.
“Two hours outside and then you have lessons.” Steve reminds Morgan’s retreating figure, who turns around and pouts at him.
"Don't." Tony snaps, whip crack sharp, and Steve shuts his mouth with a click. "I get it." His voice is horribly flat, and he flickers out of existence two seconds later.
Now that Steve had been through it once though, he finds himself a lot more relaxed as they walk towards the building, even able to tease Tony a bit along with Natasha as he mutters about what they’re gonna do when they get there.
Tony smiles when Steve falls into step beside him, and in no time at all, they make it down to the courtyard where the Sam, Bucky, Nat, Bruce, Peter and Clint are waiting along with Pepper and Rhodey.
The street is covered with swarms of a glittering substance that form into shapes and disintegrates at will. It’s a massive and deadly behemoth, fast, despite its size, unharmed by physical attacks, and magical ones don’t seem to hinder it much. Wanda destroys one of the masses, and it quickly reforms a few seconds later, deadly and quick as ever. The villain is nowhere in sight, apparently having escaped as soon as he had unleashed his little surprise.
He carries Tony back to their rooms, because Steve tries to ask what’s wrong, tries to get Tony to talk to him, but Tony is unresponsive, is mumbling and incoherent, keeps hacking and gasping and
“I don’t know.” Tony reaches out a hand to cup Steve’s face, and it takes all he has not to lean into it. “You’re warmer.”
Pepper calls Steve into the living room with the rest of Tony’s family and Steve remembers distantly feeling shocked. He’s never held any illusions that he’s been a part of Tony’s family. Tentative friends maybe. Coworkers yes. Enemies, and Steve doesn’t want to think about that one. But there’s been too much history and pain between them, too many mistakes, for him to be considered anything closer, and the thought hurts like an open wound, infected and festering, but the truth is the truth.
Hmm. Steve watches as one of the gaudily dressed villains cowers behind a half destroyed wall when Wanda levitates after him, getting captured easily. He’s cuffed and taken to the waiting vehicle. Maybe Steve’s giving them too much credit.
“Tara,” she says with a smile at Natasha. “You all can call me that if you wish. And can I just say, it's an honour to meet you ma’am.”
He is apparently the last person in the entire world to find out, via Clint when he lept out of one of the vents in the hallway, screaming about how the video is #1 on trending and scaring the ever loving crap out of Tony in the process.
Anyways, this chapter is short and really didn't have anything to do with anything (plot? What plot. I don't got any here), I just felt like writing something cracky because I'm running off four hours of sleep and I've got like five exams coming up, so therefore, I must panic-write stories about superheroes instead of studying for my chemistry exam in a week.
“Oh you know.” Tony begins slowly after turning back to Steve, “April 1st...day of pranks. I just thought-I mean it just
“Shut up” Tony groans and ducks into the kitchen. Or tries to anyways. Clint backflips over the couch and promptly drags him back to sit with them.
Tony is already always on his phone anyways, but he’s been noticing that now his level of productivity seems to be dropping the longer he spends sending goofy pics to Steve. People also seem to be giving him weird looks every time he’s in public, on account of the fact it’s not everyday you see Tony Stark making funny faces at his phone in the local Starbucks.
Steve blacks out like that as the first rays of light touch the ceiling, with his face buried in Tony’s dark hair.
“Scan complete. Captain Steve Rogers, confirm voice recognition and handprint.” an unfamiliar computerized voice announces. And Steve freezes as the scanner for the handprint lights up, waiting for him to place his palm there and open the doors.
“Hey, after you’re done doing that, can you let Bruce know that dinner will be ready in about ten minutes?” Steve calls out of the kitchen absently, poking at one of the pasta noodles with a spoon to see if it’s cooked properly.
“You probably want an explanation.” Tony murmurs hours later when he shuts the door behind him to see Steve sitting up on his bed, waiting.
There are trips to the mortal realm to bring about winter, the work unchanging for centuries, but it’s harsh and deadly because try as he might, Steve can’t always figure out how much is too much anymore. He watches as the blizzards rage and his subjects keep moving forward, going through the paces mechanically, and he pulls them back, as the Earth is frozen over with thick ice, as humanity is lost to the howling wind, but Steve can’t tell anymore, and neither can his people.
allowed to die, not like this, not when I haven’t even told you to your face that I love you yet, you
“So we broke up, and we made up again, and we broke up, and it kept going like that, on and on, because I couldn’t handle him being Iron Man, and he couldn’t handle being without. But I couldn’t stay away from him. How could I ever? He was, just so amazing, smart and gorgeous, heart of gold and utterly infuriating and everything I’ve ever wanted, he was
difficult is more like it. How the hell are you supposed to decide whether or not to tell a five year old child that her father has sort of, kind of, returned from the dead in the form of an artificial intelligence?
"You call this time of day ‘morning’, Rogers?" comes the reply, picking up their lighthearted snarking tone right where it left off from yesterday, and Tony’s hologram flickers into view beside Steve. “You are a disgrace to all things apple pie and American, not being up at the ass-crack of dawn, it is a disgrace Steve,
came for me?” Tony asks quizzically. Steve gives him a weird look from beside him.  “Of course. Why wouldn’t we? Everyone was really worried.”
“Collective you,” the AI amends, stepping away with a dismissive wave of his hand, and again the gesture is so familiar it hurts horribly. “Y’know, protect you, help you out around the compound, make a smoothie or something. The Avengers, Pepper, Happy, Morgan, Rhodey, Peter, Harley etc. etc. Of course I know who you are. Kind of hard to protect who you don’t know.”
Tony pesters her the entire way there, wherever there happens to be, because Natasha is apparently the same Natasha afterlife or otherwise, and refuses to tell him where they’re going. He tries to wheedle it out of her, but her poker face remains legendary, even as a retired superspy.
There are days where Morgan will grow reserved, quiet and contemplative, nothing like the cheerful and bright kid she is usually. She’ll shut herself in her room and if Steve’s the one to go call her to eat he’ll sometimes find her sitting on her bed, staring at a photo album, quietly crying, and it’s those days where Steve truly feels his heart shatter, at his utter inability to help shield this little girl from the hurt of a parent who won’t ever return.
One seems to be successfully driving away the other at the moment, but Steve’s not so naive to think that they’ll cancel each other out completely. The vines will keep flourishing until they destroy him.
“None.” He smiles happily, and continues to look up at the stars, with Steve at his side and the drift of music and laughter from behind them. Forever alongside the people he loves.
“Damn composting book again.” he mutters as he shoves at Steve and consequently Natasha. Steve’s learned not to question it and steps obligingly into the house.
There’s a shiver of something in the air, and lights Steve didn’t even know existed start glowing a soft blue at the edges of the room, the schematics flickering above each table. They dance and Steve stares as he looks around, mesmerized.
He walks forward, and the light sweeps over him quickly and efficiently as soon as they register a person there.
Steve frowns. "Not particularly." And again there's that look on the man's face, peculiar and confused and searching before he sweeps it behind a dazzling smile. Steve is a little dazed by the beauty of it as the man steps closer to him.
“I could possibly be persuaded.” He says, beaming that all American smile at Agent Jin. She responds with a bright grin of her own.
” Tony’s giving him an amused and fond look, his arms full of armour parts. It’s so difficult not to smile back, to cross the floor and pull Tony into his arms, but he manages to keep the blank look locked firmly in place.
“That depends,” Steve says, reaching out a hand, and Morgan happily takes it and uses it to lever herself onto the bed, and then she promptly snuggles up to him, leaning up against the pillow and giving Steve a hug. “Are mummies cool or scary, what’s the verdict?”
They sit quietly in comfortable silence, the lights of the lab still mostly off, sitting in darkness.
Steve hurriedly pulls out the chain he wears under his cloak, and drops it, with the frozen petal, over Tony’s neck, tucking it under his armour. “For luck.” he says when Tony gives him a confused look.
“Yes. Canoodling.” Natasha rolls her eyes at them, dusting off her hands before stepping off the porch to grab the hose situated underneath. Tony watches her incredulously, taking in her dirt splattered jeans and messy bun.
Days where he’ll talk to FRIDAY, and really, he knows she’s an AI and everyone will say that she can’t feel emotions, but he’ll hear it anyways in her tone of voice and he’ll
There’s silence from Tony’s end, and for a second Steve wonders worriedly if he had gone too far, if he had asked too much of the AI, but then there’s a quiet, joking question. “Shellhead?”
He comes into awareness in slow increments, registers the sound of soft even breaths and warm sheets against his skin. He blinks open his eyes to see the ceiling of his room, unadorned with ice for the first time in a long while.
“How so?” Ned asks, seemingly over his momentary embarrassment. Steve shrugs, “Couldn’t keep a straight face.” he says simply, “did you guys see the one about a hot lunch? God, the director looked like he wanted to punch me by the end because I
Steve smirks at her. “How busy could he really be, being in the chair force and all.” and Pepper smacks him on the arm, telling him to shush. She knows Steve doesn’t mean any of it. He knows how much good Rhodey, and really any soldier does for the country, would never disrespect any of the service they’ve given.
Honestly, I spent most of the last week wrestling in a fight to the death with the plot of this story, trying to wrestle it into submission. Not entirely sure I succeeded, but here's hoping things make sense in the end XDD
It's a brutal winter season for the mortal realm. It’s so hard to care like this, but hopelessly, he still tries.
Bruce is leaning on Bucky. Sam is poking at Thor’s war hammer, seemingly unconcerned with the fact that if it falls off Thor’s belt, it might smash his hand. Stephen, Pepper and Rhodey are all squished on one couch. Peter, Shuri, Happy and Harley are sound asleep on the other couch, off to the side, t’Challa perched on the armrest. Nebula is curled up on Tony’s other side, where he’s not pressed up with Steve.
Tony’s gaze on him, because that’s just how intense it is, the way the AI is looking at him, eyes glimmering, and there can’t be tears, but it looks a hell of a lot like there is.
Tony has thus far managed to escape Tara’s clutches for the last week or so, having run for the hills everytime she even mentioned the words “account” or “social media”. Sadly, Tara seems to have eventually given up on trying to be polite and had somehow managed to gain access to Tony’s workshop in order to pester him about following through on his duties. Tony has expressed his customary displeasure by threatening to donate Jarvis to a community college along with DUM-E post-haste, and is now parked in front of one of his holographic screens, with Agent Jin tapping into a variety of different sites. She’s trying to get Tony to be cooperative, which is quite frankly a lost cause.
“I see no reason why we cannot proceed with Fury’s plan.” He says solemnly. “Seems like a noble and valiant endeavour. Back on Asgard, warriors would oft tell tales of their wondrous battles in the great hall while breaking fast.”
Steve sees Tony's face as the words hit their mark, anger and pain as he flinches, and there's a flash of memory, them in
- but in reality, it’s because all the sketches are of Tony himself. And Steve isn’t sure what that means.
“Alright,” He says, rolling his eyes, “if you guys can manage getting things together on such short notice, than fine.” and then he laughs as Sam gives a loud whoop and high fives Bucky.
He smiles. “Just plain old Steve Rogers now. I’m no longer a Captain.” Peppers eyebrows shoot up at that and Steve elaborates. “I guess I’m...retired now? If you can even call it that when you’re a 34 year old man who wasn’t even officially a captain in the first place.”
“The way you’re talking about the coding there Bruce, makes it sound like a human personality.” Harley cuts in, raising an eyebrow. “Changing traits? Subconscious characteristics? Quirks? I don’t have a
The waiting is tense; Tony spends the entire time fidgeting, pacing around, opening and re-opening his blueprints, and generally ignoring Peter, Harley and Steve anytime they try and talk to him.
Pepper sniffs haughtily, “A lady never shows her age. I’m actually three hundred and twelve years old.” and Steve can’t help but laugh softly along with Pepper at that, because dumb joke it may be, both of them are acutely aware of
Scott eventually ends up in a cheerful conversation with Tony and Bruce about the quantum realm that ends up going a little over Steve’s head, so after a few minutes of squinting at them in confusion, he excuses himself with a smile and a shake of his head. He’s not really sure what he’s gonna do now as he wanders around the compound, a little bit listlessly if he’s gonna be honest, but Steve’s sure he’ll eventually think of something.
“Steve.” Sam grunts from over the comms, and Steve looks up in time to see Sam’s agile form swoop gracefully away from a hit, his uniform a combination of the Falcon armour and the Captain America uniform. The shield is strapped to his back.
"And you've somehow translated that into me having a problem with you in particular?" Steve says mildly, trying to get Tony to fucking
because it’s completely your fault.” Tony sniffles wetly into Steve’s shoulder. And then he draws back to stare down at Steve. His brown eyes are puffy and red rimmed with dark circles under them, and he looks even older somehow, world weary and tired. He looks a mess. He’s gorgeous.
They make it to the restaurant in record time, because although Steve drives like the 90 year old man he is in cars, the rules apparently don't apply to two wheeled vehicles.
Steve is too. He had been shaky when it had first occurred to him that Thanos could have destroyed that portion of the compound. Because despite the fact that the lab is now a horrifying reminder of what was gone, it still hurts to think of losing that reminder of Tony forever. He finds himself so profoundly grateful that one part of Tony had still remained intact from the final battle, that despite the destruction of the compound, the lower levels had remained mostly salvageable, that Tony was paranoid enough to put on fucking
There are dark edges dancing on the edge of his vision, creeping forward. His hands burn with pain. Steve holds on for as long as he can, because he knows if he closes his eyes now, he won’t wake up again, thinks about the warmth of laughter and music in his kingdom, Bucky’s smiles and Sam’s laughter and Natasha’s sharp remarks, and Tony, with red and gold glinting like a halo around him.
Scott ends up arriving back at the compound a couple days after Sam and Bucky leave for their mission. Tony, Bruce and Steve had been in the lab at the time and there was a moment of panic where Bruce couldn’t remember if he had told him about AI Tony or not.
"Interesting as in, he gave Thor's helmet working wings in the middle of his country address. It flew away."
, the one that says 'sure Tony, I have no idea what you're talking about, but whatever you say' it is all dirty lies you dirty
Now he just lies there amidst comfy sheets, perfectly content where he is, reluctant to move. He feels lazy, and happy, the bone deep exhaustion and weight from yesterday gone. The sunlight filters in from the window, and Steve watches the play of light beams dappled on the ceiling and his bedsheets. His hand itches to sketch it, the dance of rays shining in through the curtains, dust particles floating through the air, peaceful.
Steve stands quietly out of sight and range of sound over the playing of the TV, not quite ready to join them yet. He watches as speeches are given about the bravery that had been shown by Iron Man, as the camera pans through the crowd, thousands of people dressed in black, and red and gold in equal measure, come to pay their respects again.
Tony rolls his eyes in response. “That I do.” he mumbles to himself, but Steve’s serum enhanced ears catches it easily. He tries not to blush but he probably fails, suddenly flooded with warmth and happiness. Steve looks hurriedly back down at his drawing to hide the fact that he had heard, needlessly adding more layers to one of the shadows.
They go for a walk around the park afterwards and somehow end up debating rather vigorously about the merits of pineapple on pizza, with Tony for and Steve against.
“Shhhhhhhhh,” Peter says loudly, placing a hand over Wanda’s mouth. “My husband Jake Peralta is talking, everyone be quiet.”
Steve suddenly feels a blast of energy slam him to the ground, taken completely by surprise, and he curses when he realizes he let himself get distracted. It’s painful, and he can feel where his skin is blistering and burning, but mortality wise, he’s still ok.
Eventually, his breathe stutters and evens out slowly, and instead of the full on panic, there is only him on the sweaty bed-sheets, damp with tears and shaking like a leaf. He shivers, cold, despite the temperature regulated compound.
Peter shrugs, throwing himself into Steve’s chair, and eyeing his notebook curiously. “You got stuck with babysitting duty.”
“Cap.” he says and smiles. “God, what could I possibly say to you. There’s a lot of history between us, old man.” Tony shakes his head, and Steve gives a huff of laughter, despite the tears now streaming down his cheeks. “You’re a stubborn son of a bitch Rogers. Be happy.”
“So,” Steve says eventually when Tony makes it clear he’s not going to continue. “Have you come here just to yell at me?” He looks at the AI with wide blue eyes, trying his best to pout a bit without bursting into laughter. It’s a struggle. “That’s mean Tony, I think my feelings are hurt.”
Pepper gingerly shifts a couple of the cups to the side and steps forward a bit, taking in the cling wrapped and sticky noted appliances.
Steve drags himself out of bed into the shower and turns the water to the hottest setting he can stand, and he stays there for a long while, trying to erase the tendrils of the dream from his mind.
They open the door and Pepper immediately stops walking in order to stare at the perfect rows of cups lining the floor all the way to the stairwell, the perfect face of “does-not-compute” seeming to flash in her eyes. Happy promptly bursts into laughter at the expression on her face and Pepper smacks him on the arm, her own lips twitching with amusement.
"Oh fine." Tony laughs after a couple seconds of wide eyes and lip wobbling. "You're regular criminals, aren't you? Get back into your stupid closet, we'll ride this out until your mother comes to yell at me. If anyone asks, you're a pirate" Tony points at Elle, who giggles. "-and you're an accountant." Morgan nods solemnly.
Steve admits he had been expecting Tony to just go about his business like all of his other subjects do in this place, but instead, Tony follows Steve around everyday to each of his duties.
He sits there quietly, on his throne of ice, cloak of azure, gilded with silver and frost. Sunlight streams through the open windows of the room, setting the icy floor glinting with kaleidoscopes of colours. He watches the light dance, only looking up when he’s prompted by his second in command.
Tony was tinkering in his workshop with Sam, who had requested that he turn down the music, since he can't concentrate with it on. Tony had rolled his eyes but turned off AC/DC as per request.
the substance. The arm weakens briefly, and as soon as it’s grip is loosened, Steve gulps in air, slashes the hand with the staff, and he drops to the ground as portions of the arm disintegrate, some glitching and shorting out from the jolt of electricity.
As Bruce had told them while they had gotten settled in the living room to give Pepper, Happy and Tony some privacy, not a human with emotions and feelings, because it’s just not possible. No chemicals, no receptors to use those chemicals, no body to feel them with. Maybe there’s a convincing illusion of emotion based on the premises set by the personality, but it's not real emotion, and most importantly, he's not Tony Stark.
Bucky shrugs, “Not an uncommon way of doing business; it’s sold through word of mouth, always from a friend of a friend - using ‘friend’ in the loosest sense of the word, of course - we tracked down the guy who hooked our little thief up to the nanites; followed the trail from there. There were a couple of close shaves, but after Bruce’s call about the HYDRA agent, we kept a look out and stumbled on the information by pure dumb luck. There was a small organization within the system that had been selling to multiple buyers. They kept a paper record of the budget, and guess who was a customer?”
“Peggy’s here.” Tony comments afterwards, when they’re sitting on a bench, waiting for Natasha to come back with ice cream. “We can go see her if you want. Although I gotta warn you, I think she lives with her husband. Erm, the one that’s not you. Um. Y’know. The other one.”
Finally, he becomes aware enough to realize he’s now on the floor, leaning against the base of the main workshop table, arms around his knees, curled into a ball. He’s shaking like a leaf, but he’s breathing normally now.
It’s cozy, and comfortable, and as evening turns into night, none of them really bother to leave afterwards, dozing off one by one on the couches.
“Original flavour Tony used to do this all the time.” Steve decides to say lightly after a short pause of contemplation, but he can feel himself tense a bit anyways as he waits to see if the joke will be well received. He’s still not entirely sure where they stand, if they can joke about that kind of thing.
“Uh huh,” Pepper says, sounding unconvinced. Steve spins around a bit in his swivel chair just to have something to do.
There’s a ripple of shock as Steve prepares to swing at the enemy he’s locked in combat with, because he
PhD’s-” and Bruce rolls his eyes at Harley’s friendly but teasing tone. “-so correct me if I’m wrong, but an AI hardly needs any of those to function. In fact, in the long run it’ll probably hinder the program more than help.”
“Shhh, stop being treasonous,” Peter kicks at her. “The show is good enough that it warrants a second watch.”
He looks around, noting the trajectory of the hit, finally sees the culprit, a woman in a black suit, levitating.
There is no Jarvis, no Friday in the compound after Tony had moved her to his house by the lake, to notice the fact that his shower has been running for almost an hour and a half now, to notice that Steve’s barely moving, just leaning heavily against the wall, to call for help. He finds himself glad and immediately guilty for it, because he doesn’t want to be found by anyone right now, wants to stand here where the almost boiling water beats down on him. He’s still so cold.
The hologram tilts his head curiously at the shocked and shaken look on Steve’s face, and walks forward, and Steve scrambles back, smashing into the edge of the table in his haste to get away, even though he knows that if he reaches out to touch, his hand would simply go through air.
“Oh, I see how it is,” Tony says in a faux-offended tone as Steve goes to sit down beside Peter. “Tony the AI gets a ‘no, I swear I can do it Tony’, but Steve the Captain America gets a ‘yes please’?”
“Given the way you are Tony,” she says, opening the lab door. “You and Tumblr are a match made in heaven, trust me.”
The internet is great, but there are times, like now, where Tony just wants a bit of peace while in the workshop. He’s spent this entire life photographed and chased by camera flashes. His lab is the one place that he can be private, and he doesn’t intend for that to change. And if Tony is being entirely honest with himself, he doesn't view this little social media plan as any more than an exercise in futility, and more than a little annoying when it interferes with Tony’s work.
There are happy days, even though they’re rare and far between. It’s when Morgan will come up to him and ask for stories of the Avengers, and Steve will tell her about all those adventures they used to get up to. Or when Peter and Harley visit, which is often, or the rest of the remaining and new Avengers, filling up the house with laughter, a burden shared and halved.
A spark of blue lightning shocked Tony’s hands and he dropped the ring of metal, watching it spark a few more times before it stopped. He felt his face stretch into a tired smile and laughed lightly. Then he kept laughing. Not a belly laugh, but light sustained giggling that bubbled up from his chest and out of his lips. The noise kept escaping him while he hid his materials again, then he crawled to his cot, trying to stay off his still healing feet.
Steve ends up in conversation with Peter, Ned and Harley after he talks a bit with Aunt May. It’s exceedingly interesting because Steve goes to shake Ned’s hand when Peter introduces him to Steve and Ned blurts out an awed, “Wow, you’re
I couldn’t handle it, the fear.” Pepper puts her head in her hands, and Steve sets a hand on her shoulder.
The humming grows louder and then stops suddenly, the room jarringly silent, like a caught anticipatory breathe, the moment before something life-altering…
Tony’s eyes soften. “I do know that.” He says warmly, and then pauses to frown. “Okay actually, you kinda had to remind me today because I got irrationally angry at you over a misunderstanding, but the point still stands, I know that
“You used to draw.” Tony says to him one day, and Steve looks over to see him holding a dusty palette of colours and a stack of paper, certain pigments cracked from the years.
“Oh God this is gold,” Tony whispered from his perch on the ceiling couch as they watched the Avengers collectively lose their shit when they arrived early that afternoon. Sam had been the one to find the cheeky note that had been left, the one that said, “Love, Happy and Pepper ;)” left in clear view in the middle of the now clear living room floor.
, happiness spilling through him like a wave, warm and sweet and bright, and tilts Steve’s chin back up, surges in because he doesn’t think he can wait another second.
You can probably tell from my spelling of armour that I'm just very very Canadian, so please just ignore it and enjoy the story :)))
He thinks as he releases his grip, now directed and tamed, and collapses into the snow, the cold leaving him in a rush of wind that sounds like a relieved sigh.
The only person who doesn't warm up as much to Tony is Peter, although he does a lot better than Steve, at least talking normally to Tony and being friendly.
and he's in trouble, except Bruce grabs him, pulls him back before he makes it a step, and he remembers.
Tony wheezes, trying to get his laughter under control before opening his camera. He gives it his best stern look, and then takes out the drawing app, adding a cowl and a shield. He captions this pic “Language!” And promptly sends it.
“Just shut up for a bit. Give me a sec so I don’t start shouting in frustration.” Steve grumbles. He rubs a hand over his face wearily, now thoroughly in a shitty mood, and then just lies there, arms on either side of his head.
There’s a gentle whispering of cool wind, the sound of leaves rustling. Light filters in through the canopy, spreading dappled colour behind closed eyelids. The ground is blessedly cool beneath him, the sunlight wonderfully warm above.
Tony did. He pays for that when a henchman nearest growls at him, evidently thinking Steve’s laughing at him, and slams (or attempts to slam) a fist towards his face. Steve blocks with his staff deftly, and promptly jabs his opponent in the ribs with the electrified tip, making sure the setting is on low so he doesn’t accidentally kill him. He drops to the floor like a bag of potatoes.
The Avengers had of course, been invited to a bunch of these memorials, but they had shown their respects last year for the first anniversary in public and this time Sam, as the new leader and face of the Avengers, had politely declined, because none of them felt like being scrutinized while mourning. They had done the same for Natasha and all the other memorials for the fallen heroes.
They set to work, with Tony helping to direct them into setting things up. They had planned some relatively harmless pranks, nothing gigantic considering how much concentration it takes to move objects.
many insecurities Steve, honestly I could write a dictionary of them. Webster’s Dictionary of Worries A - Z”
And then Tony is there, warm presence pressing Steve into his sheets, and he kisses him again, undoing him with tongue and lips and teeth, and if the first kiss was tender, this one is liquid fire, setting Steve alight, and he can barely keep up, whimpering into Tony’s mouth…
Steve blinks at him, confused for a second before it finally seems to register what Tony’s referring to.
Maria frowns as she watches him, but after a tense second, nods in understanding. “Fury won’t be happy.”
“Ok rude.” he scowls, but his fond expression gives him away as Steve continues to muffle his laughter into his hand. Natasha is still there eating her pretzels and watching them as if they’re a very fascinating TV show.
“Whoa there,” he laughs as she tries to climb onto his shoulders like a limber monkey. “You’re getting too big even for a supersoldier to pick up,” he teases, as he walks towards Pepper, who’s watching them with an amused smile. It’s a Saturday, so she’s home from SI.
“Alright alright. I will...hmm, try my best. That’s all I can give you. Sorry Rogers.” he smirks down at Steve, who rolls his eyes and moves on. That’s a fight he can’t win.
There are still sullen moments where Tony becomes withdrawn, when something doesn’t work on schedule and he gets that helpless look to his eyes, infinite sadness when he watches Steve.
“How much information did they have?” Clint asks, and Bucky grunts. “Not a lot. It was a business transaction, and one done in cash at that. We’ve got an identity though, and that’s more than what we had before.” Bucky looks over at Tony and addresses him. “You think you could do anything with that Tony?”
“I’m sorry.” Steve whispers, at a loss for what else to say, because if Tony had been unconscious for a month, Steve’s not sure he would’ve remained
“Anything from your kingdom would do.” he clarifies when Tony stares at him, confused, and Tony finally plucks a singular thread from his jacket.
Finally, on the second anniversary of Tony's death, Steve finds himself once again, standing outside the lab. He’s against the opposite wall, hands flattened to it as he stares at the doors, not willing to step into range yet. He imagines he makes quite a sight, a six foot super-soldier cowering in front of a door.
Steve can feel the shock distantly when she mentions Hydra, he wracks his oxygen deprived brain for something, some hint of recognition of the agent, but there is none. She smiles, and Steve can see the insanity in her eyes, the cold intelligence and burning fury.
After the Avenger’s hectic two week marathon of world saving, the universe seems to decide to finally give them all a brief break.
It's the Iron Man armour, dropping like a stone, and it's reflex, Steve feels pure panic, almost runs forward, self-destruct be damned, almost goes to catch about 225 pounds of metal armour in deadly free fall, because it's
, muscles screaming, but too late every time. And then the accusing looks, from Natasha, and Tony, their mangled bodies,
He smiles crookedly when Steve looks up and gives him a mildly skeptical look. Tony finds himself sticking his tongue out at him.
“He forgave you Steve, I know he did. And who am I to disagree with him?” Steve laughs softly, ignoring the fact that it comes out a bit wet.
It seems like the respectful thing to do, cleaning up the place a bit, and Steve eventually manages to scrounge up an old broom and dustpan from an old cupboard in the back. He supposes it’s too much to ask for a bottle of Lysol, so he makes do with a towel he wets with the sink in the back of the lab to wipe down the tables.
“I figured giving him some space would be the best way to go about this,” Steve says quietly. “He wanted to be alone, so it’s been a couple hours.”
He let's go of it sheepishly, even though the kitchen is currently empty and sighs, guiltily noting the slight indent of fingers imprinted in the metal. After a moment of contemplation, he decides to just get a glass of water instead.
He sees Pepper and Happy standing on the back porch watching them later on, Happy's arm around Pepper's waist in comfort. They look cozy.
Steve knows Harley doesn’t have any particular superpowers, but he’s already applied to SHIELD as a possible agent, and Steve is adamant to recruit him as one of the Avengers, considering his intellect and level of capability. He sees no reason for Harley not to be given the same opportunity as Peter, considering he’s probably going to throw himself into danger at SHIELD anyway, but Steve will be damned if he doesn’t train them properly before letting them into the field. Being only human doesn’t change a thing. It’s never stopped Clint, Natasha or Tony, so Steve doesn’t let it change his considerations, although he does make sure to go a little easier on Harley when training him up.
In their arguing, neither of them had noticed the quiet snick of the lock being picked, or the sound of the door being opened. Steve isn’t smiling, but Tony can see the sparkle of mirth and relief in his eyes as he re-attaches his shield to his back. Natasha stands behind him, smirking at the two of them, blade in hand.
Harley laughs, a bit sad. “Sorry Tony. You know what I mean.” and Tony responds with a teasing smile.
They worry a little bit about Thor, since they don’t really know the protocol for God of Thunder when it comes to the afterlife, or death even, but he does end up arriving eventually, in his former young glory instead of a wizened old man like he had been in life.
Steve watches through his own stinging eyes as Natasha goes back to staring out the window, the tears freezing on her cheeks.
“Hey,” Steve waves his hands, slightly panicked as Tony starts laughing again, half hysterical, tears leaking out of his eyes. “Tony, deep breaths, come on, you’re okay, you’re-”
Steve places his other hand, the one that's not still numb with cold, to the man's chest, starting a bit when his fingernails clink against something hard. He disregards it though after a second, and pulls more, taking care this time not to go too far. He wants the man warmed up, not bursting into flames.
“Hey there kiddo.” Steve shuts his book quietly and gestures at Morgan to come over. “Why aren’t you asleep? You’ve got a big day at school tomorrow. Your mom says you’re going to the Science centre for a field trip, aren’t you?”
“Steve!” he says happily, “Look, I’m working on being ambidextrous.” Peter waves his pencil at him and then his smile turns a bit sheepish. “Actually, it could be going better but, well. Win some lose some.”
"Why are you following me?" Steve asks one day, interrupting Tony's terrade as he goes on about something or other. Steve's not sure they're speaking the same language at this point, Tony ranting about some sort of "science" that is lost to Steve.
, shimmering over his skin and his desk and his shirt and probably his neck and even his face because he’s scratched an itch a couple times and he just draws and draws and draws and draws.
Steve whispers to Tony for hours after that, talks more than he has in months, speaks until his voice is hoarse. He recounts Tony’s own stories to him, covers him in blankets again when Tony grows too cold, and embraces him when the fever shoots back up, and he whispers every prayer he remembers, ones of safe passage and mourning, and rusty unused ones of life.
He’s so close. But there’s no body heat, because why would there be? The AI is pure light, created with circuits and sensors, calibrated perfectly for an illusion. Not real.
There’s something to be said about the former Captain America hiding in a high-tech storage closet in order to avoid human interaction.
worth of ‘So you got detention’ and I would live long and happy knowing I never have to hear another of those things again in my life.” and Steve laughs in good humour at the disgruntled look on Harley’s face.
Steve pauses, thrown at the interruption. “Yeah she already-oh wait.” Steve suddenly feels like kicking himself because
she was in on the entire thing. “Thanks babe,” Tony bounces forward to give him a quick kiss, “Love you, talk to you later!” and with that, makes his exit.
“I can’t.” he says suddenly, “I can’t I’m sorry, I just- I have to-” and then he leaves the room quickly. Steve goes to get up and follow him, but Harley waves him down, going after Peter instead.
Steve had seen the humans at it, those huddled in their houses against the cold, a light source crackling merrily in a brick hearth, feeding on fuel and giving warmth to those around them. It would work. Except.
Tony keeps babbling, but Steve’s stopped hearing it, just enjoying being in this moment, happy and part way loopy with exhaustion, high on the emotional rollercoaster that is today and really, this entire week.
Tony gives him a confused smile. "I have no idea why you're apologizing to me, but if it’s any consolation, I'm pretty sure human Tony wouldn't have included you in the list of people to protect if he hadn't forgiven you."
Pepper grins, self-satisfied. “I ran into her once.” and Steve squints at her suspiciously. “Why,” he begins slowly, “do you look so smug?”
MILD TRIGGER WARNING BTW. I feel the need to warn for this because it's really really minor, like barely there, but there's a very slight reference to suicide, although not technically suicide?? Because AI? But I thought I'd warn for it just in case. Read with caution.
“No. Just no. That is forever exiled. That accent. Not allowed. It’s illegal Steve, stop breaking the law.”
Tony’s face softens at that, looking a bit surprised as he smiles hesitantly at Peter. Steve distantly remembers, as he watches them, as Peter tentatively smiles back warmly, how Peter hadn’t seemed that comfortable around Tony either in the first week of his arrival (still did better than Steve though), the similarities between the AI and the human making it difficult for Peter as well. This was a marked improvement based on what he had seen.
Tony endures the next three minutes of his own singing. He knows he doesn’t have a bad voice. Far from it in fact, and he can definitely carry a tune. But there's just something about watching himself sing that just makes him want to cringe.
Steve’s first instinct, his first reflex is to blush and splutter, and honestly Steve probably still blushes a bit, but it’s been several years since he’s become friends with original Tony, several years since he’s been someone that would fluster easily with a couple of well said words. Steve instead quickly schools his expression into a blank look. His conversations with Tony might still be a bit awkward at times, still not sure what he's allowed to say, not wanting to break the unstable friendship with a wrong sentence, but
“Avengers assemble!” Steve yells, already dashing to change into his uniform, still the SHIELD one, and there’s a bit of fumbling, but ten minutes later all the Avengers are on the quinjet headed to the site, with Steve piloting and simultaneously arguing with Spiderman over comms to
?” Steve can distantly feel himself still struggling, vision going dark, black spots growing in his eyes as he’s choked to death by the glimmering gelatinous substance, as they climb higher and higher and the air grows thinner and colder, and there’s no way that any of his teammates could get to him in time and he hopes desperately that Wanda and Scott are okay and he can’t help but think
It doesn’t take long before Pepper stands up from her position on the swing and makes her way to the house. She stops in her tracks when she sees the note though, eyes narrowing.
“Paintball battle.” Steve, Tony and Natasha all chorus at the same time that Clint says it, dissolving into laughter afterwards, and then trails behind as Clint calls his wife telling her to gather the troops, and Sam calls Pepper and Happy, making a declaration of war.
Steve doesn’t care anymore about the danger, walks straight into it and stands his ground even when it rips at him like sharp nails, as his cloak is grabbed by the wind and wrenched from him, and his eyes sting with shards of ice. This is for Tony. This is for Tony and Bucky and Natasha and Sam and Pepper and Rhodey and Clint and Happy and Peter and Harley and Nebula and everyone Tony loves and his people who he’s failed for far too long.
, you’d have to learn how to bite your tongue for once in your life.” Steve laughs and Tony smacks him on the arm.
She nods solemnly in response. “Yeah we do. I still hafta tell you about how I won first place in the science fair!”
as he left and Steve can’t connect any of their conversation to it with the little information he has, so maybe it was a physical thing, and Steve doesn’t want to even consider that, but there’s still that one paranoid portion of him that’s saying over and over, entertain every theory because ‘what if’...
After the first two hours of Tony using Tumblr, Tara has to physically stop him from buying out the website. These are his
Suddenly, there’s a snort of laughter from nowhere and Steve grins, not looking up from his mixing bowl.
Not that there is a routine, but that Tony appears to follow it. Steve gets the sense Tony isn't exactly known for having structure, based on his long rambling rants chock full of digressions.
, speaking in computer programming terms Tony, don’t give me that look.” Bruce snorts when Tony puts his hand on his heart in fake offense. “Tony -
Steve's glad, and how could he not be? But he knows there will always be a tiny selfish part of him that will think about Natasha and Tony, think about those brief but bright moments in the tower when it had been just the six of them united, and will whisper that the price was too high, that if only he had left it well enough alone, or if he had been a bit faster, a bit stronger, a bit smarter...
After that they all sit down, after much coaxing from Pepper for Steve to take it easy, and they talk for another hour or so, Wanda and Scott leaning in the doorway, before a SHIELD nurse comes in to notify them that Steve can finally leave.
Steve puts his hand over Tony’s mouth and Tony glares at him, to which Steve responds with a cheeky smile.
“Any day now Stark.” Tara comments from behind the camera, which prompts Tony to look up and stick his tongue out at the camera.
“Were the bathroom soaps that amusing?” Natasha comments, smile twitching at the corner of her mouth.
Steve watches them bicker back and forth fondly, Scott and Bruce cutting in here and there with a comment at different times. Steve feels Tony’s absence keenly, the silence in between and lack of sharp humour and his laugh, but he tries to put that out of his mind as they get further and further into the episodes.
“Real time.” Steve says, a pit growing in his stomach as well at the thought of what might be happening over in Tony’s kingdom. He doesn’t want to say this, wants to beg Tony to stay here where it’s safe, with Steve, but he knows Tony would never forgive himself if he doesn’t do something. “You have to go.”
There’s a hint of well disguised pain in Tony’s jovial voice as he says this last part, and Steve blinks, wonders if he’s supposed to know who these people are, like he was apparently supposed to know Howard. Tony pays his confusion no mind, and has continued talking once again.
Tony is released from their care surprisingly quickly, having obtained the least amount of injuries and being too exhausted to attempt to hinder the medical staff. He slumps onto a waiting room chair to wait for his teammates.
