“Brother, please,” he tried again.
Tony’s fingers twitched, itching for a phone. When he’d first gotten here, he’d spent over a week in front of his computer, coming through the FBI mainframe, searching for his lost family members. It was laughably easy, JARVIS taking over and providing him with completed dockets on each member. From what Tony could tell, his team had safety made it to their respective locations and were in seemingly good health – at least, he could only assume, if he read between the lines of the FBI agents’ weekly reports. The check-ins listed gold star reviews for Natasha and complaints of having to diffuse a few instances with the local force involving noise complaints from Sam’s new home. There had already been a small fire from where they had moved Clint, not to mention he’d recently been busted for starting a gambling ring with his new neighbors. Bucky’s agent had straight up asked for a reassignment. JARVIS had even found some paparazzi photos of Thor in Norway – ones that showed blurry images of Bruce’s rumpled figure. So yes, his family was all tucked away safely and out of harm’s way.
“You didn't have too. If you even think to insinuate that
“The suit?”
"Wanna tell me what we’re doing here?”
“No, course not.” Tony tried to shoot a winning smile his way, but he could tell by the wary look he got in response that Steve didn’t believe him.
“Yes, your fault- ”
With that, Tony hit the streets again, moving quickly and as quietly as possible. He doubled back a few times, taking the same persuasions as when he was driving, making sure he wasn’t followed. The last thing he needed was a mob’s lackeys cornering him. By the time he reached his destination, the sun had sunk way behind the cityscape, the buildings' lights flickering on in the distance. Tony cursed to himself, wishing he brought a flashlight. He was so disconnected from the main civilization that the pale moonlight was the only viable source of light. It was strange, as Tony didn't think there would be places like this left in the never sleeping New York.
Tony smacked at Steve’s pec. “Yes, thank you, Captain Obvious,” he replied dryly. “I wanted to wait until you were in me.”
“Fat chance,” Steve snorted as he stood, yanking Bucky up with him. “You said until the end of the line, pal. If I die of blue balls, you’re comin’ with me.”
His bleary eyes finally locked on to the voice. The one light in the room shone across the dark trench coat, showing the creases in all the leather. The man leaned down, his single eye staring intensely down at him.
She smiled softly. “Steve.”
“Okay,” he answered, before uttering a quiet, “thank you, Pepper.”
"And we're sure it was HYDRA?"
There was Tony, eyes wide as he grasped his right wrist, looking down at –
Everyone in the room tensed, guns cocking all around. Steve's breath caught in his throat; Tony Stark was a loose cannon. One wrong move and the whole thing goes south.
Steve stilled.
“Isn’t this the part where you ask me if I want some water?”
“It’s for your own good, Steve,” reasoned Clint. “You’re not well, none of us are. We just need to take a few steps back for a while and- ”
“Pepper,
“But- ”
Steve felt his heart rate pick up again. They couldn’t find the bullet, but Tony was already in critical condition. If the doctors start poking around in there looking for a bullet, it could mean disastrous things.
Tony thought to himself.
“-as you both shall live?” the priest cut in.
Steve nodded, silently preening when he caught Stark’s impressed gaze. “I know it’s not a lot, but I need you to hit the streets. Start at the warehouse and make your usual perimeter; take people with if you need. Talk to your sources, bribe people, I don’t care. Find this man.”
“Jesus, Tony. You nearly gave me a heart attack! What could you possibly- ”
“Don’t worry. I don’t think she’ll come back.”
“Yeah, yeah,
Red seemed like the better choice. Seeing the Iron Man armor glint in the sun was always a sight to behold. But they didn’t have the right shade. There was one that looked more like it would belong on a fire truck and the other was too dark. Crimson, like the color of the blood that trickled out of Tony’s mouth as he laid dying just months ago. Steve frowned, moving away from the red sheets. Turns out it wasn’t the better choice.
Both men whipped around, Tony startling with an added jump. Across the room sat Natasha Romanoff, idly picking at her nails.
“There’s something behind it,” she concluded.
Clint was the most down to earth person Tony had ever met. He never once looked at Tony as everyone else did; he never made any assumptions. Clint was one of the first people to get to know the real Tony. He never said anything when Tony drank too much, or said harsh things. He never mentioned when he knew Tony had nightmares; he just sat with him until morning.
Steve fell harshly, hard metal digging into his back. Before he could gauge his surroundings, the beeping of the bomb sped up before finally exploding, sending Steve flying further back. Head pounding, Steve stumbled back up when he heard a horn in the distance.
don’t let him do anything too stupid. Keep him safe for me.”
Steve awoke behind the trees to a man shouting. Looking out he saw the owner of the house pointing a weird mechanism at an assailant. Gasping, Steve reached for his shield and took off across the field.
Steve yanked Tony into his chest again. “They can’t kill me. It’ll disrupt the future too much. But you? No one will have a problem killing you. Take the car. I’ll distract them long enough for you to get away. Go north, out of the city. Hide in the countryside until I come find you.”
Jarvis didn't drink. He
had that. He’d like to think he had that with Rhodey at least, but he's been known for fabricating his reality for something he’d always wanted. “Sure, I can respect it. But that doesn’t mean I understand it,” Tony replied, heading back for the stairs.
“Oh, um. Right. Let’s get this show on the road.” Tony gave a quick smirk before heading back to the elevators, his new superhero team in tow.
Steve huffed. “I know. I’m not exactly happy with you either.”
Tony groaned, head flopping against the pillows. He’d gotten completely sidetracked. Damn Steve and his distracting self. No, damn Phil. This was all his fault. Of course that man could be a complete cockblock without even being present.
Tony hummed, but pulled back, face still distraught. “Well, yeah. Relationships are all about communication, right?” he tried to joke.
Loki looked up at them, one eye already swelling shut from Stark’s right hook. “Ah,” he said. “I was starting to think you had forgotten about me. Tell me, Captain, which one of your lovely mutts will be taking care of me?”
Finally alone, Steve turned back to Stark. "Talk."
Tony scoffed to his left. “Your boy got sent to the principal’s office. Again.”
“Stipulations,” Bucky repeated hollowly. “What exactly did we agree to?”
“Keep on The Captain. Report to me if anything happens.”
“Shut up, he can go somewhere else. Let me take care of you, ya jerk.”
“I do,” Tony confirmed, grinning back. “I-I really do.”
-------------------------
“Clint,” Wanda smiled.
“Time to go,” Steve snapped, not wasting another second as he grabbed Sam’s shoulder, yanking him towards the back exit.
Steve couldn’t begin to imagine the scenarios the man was chugging through in his head. Formulating numbers and outcomes in milliseconds, searching desperately for a way to win. No doubt his head was mostly filled with ideas on how to get Steve out of the room. Keeping his eyes locked with Tony, Steve stepped right next to him, dropping in the chair next to him.
The man ignored the voice, electing to continue down the hall, sweat collecting on his brow as he pushed his aching legs closer to the door.
Steve hummed, leaning down to suck a mark into Tony’s neck. “How about a date?” he asked when he pulled away. “I believe I promised you one of those. I’ll even cook.”
“Florida?”
The public, of course, was in a panic. At least they were, after someone threw the term
“Tony, I don’t know what to say,” Steve whispered.
Steve surged forward, flipping Tony under him. He would give Tony anything.
In retrospect, Tony thought as he found himself waking up again on his cot, he should have come up with a more diplomatic answer. Shifting slightly, he felt the dampness of his skin and instantly turned to his side, throwing up whatever bile remained in his stomach. Tony shuddered, not really knowing if he should count himself lucky he didn’t remember the waterboarding this time. It was bad enough the first time, in the warehouse. How no matter how much he struggled, how much he screamed in protest, there was nothing but the silence and the water.
“No, you need to look at the whole picture. People need guns, so we build them. End of story.”
Clint raised an eyebrow. “And you think I can help you because?”
he hissed, staring into the kitchen camera. The icebox shut off with a small whir, the kitchen descending into silence again. Tony clenched his hands into fists, ready to deliver another angry barb, when he finally heard it.
Thor stood back up, pulling Bruce along with him. “In times like that, I must remember the good that I have done, the good I have inside me.” Thor pointed at Bruce’s chest. “Sometimes I ask why I do what I do every day, buy I force myself to remember the people that I have saved. The people like Sarah. And I will continue to do my duty for people like them. Because I am a hero. As are you.”
“Relax.”
“Are you alone here, sir?”
Steve frowned. “A break?”
Rumlow saw Pierce freeze.
“Fine,” Raza hissed. “See that it’s done.”
A low chuckle sounded over the phone.
Tony shot him a grin in return. “You love it.”
Bucky nodded. “Good. Now keep crackin’ on this, well, whatever the hell you’re doing. I’ll send Sam and Clint to the locations where I know are, and we’ll just text them your list.”
“Who is this friend?” he couldn’t help but ask.
Steve looked desperately for Tony, for his armour, anything. Carefully, he inched away from the protection of the crates, towards the water, his shield held high before him. He startled badly when something touched his shoulder, whirling around and thrusting his shield into whatever enemy had taken him by surprise.
Two times.
important to Stark.
Had the scarecrow been trying to get help all this time?
Besides, he still needed an explanation for his changed appearance.
Steve stood there as they sat down at the table, talking urgently about Ultr—Ultrosomething. Who was that? Was it even relevant to their current situation? And what was her connection to the Witch?
He had to save Tony. He had to. He strained all he could against the armour, but it held strong, restricting him further. Jocasta cast a disinterested glance at Steve before turning back to Tony’s prone body.
Tony swallows, tries to remember if Steve has ever offered to draw Tony in the nude before. It’s too blurry.
“All right, all right, I get it, it wasn’t very glamorous. But I’ll accept the promotion, thank you. As long as it comes with a pay raise.”
He was
He can’t feel his hands anymore. His legs. His neck. Part by part, they’re disappearing, and the ache with them. He’s almost free from everything.
“Tony, you’re…less than alright. I need to speak to you about Ultrocifern. She’s not with the Witch, I haven’t been able to find her.”
They start light, stretching for five minutes, doing a few burpies, running two laps across the gym to get the body warm and the blood flowing. Every time Steve breathes, he pushes oxygen into his lungs, oxygen that passes through the respiratory membranes into his bloodstream into his muscles. If he exerts his muscles, they’ll ask for more oxygen and he’ll breathe heavier and his heart will beat faster and there will be so much movement in his veins, and Tony can almost hear the blood rushing. He should make Steve break a sweat, put him through his paces, anything to make the flow of the blood in his arteries stronger. If Tony bit Steve’s bicep, he bets it would spurt out like water from a burst pipe. Beautiful.
Iron Man locked eyes with Tony, who took a step back at the sheer desperation in the man’s eyes. This went beyond Iron Man not believing that Tony was who he was. This was personal for Iron Man.
“We met at the Witch’s castle. He’s not a scarecrow, he’s actually another man that she cursed. I think he managed to slip away with me, but I don’t recall what happened very clearly. He says he’s been trying to enter the castle, that there is something he needs there.”
A hiss escapes from his lips as Steve jostles his bad arm again.
But then Steve became Nomad, and he disappeared, and Tony got his answer.
Steve realised this was what a flirting Stark looked like. Inexplicably, it annoyed him. Why did he have to court every pretty face he came across? Why couldn’t he just appreciate people for their intellect of personality, instead of their looks? Was it too much to ask, huh?
Maybe it wouldn’t have happened, or maybe it would have. Maybe the Witch of the Waste would have found out about Steve regardless. Maybe she would have killed him if she didn’t know what emotional link there was between Steve and Tony.
Tony would be near the sea. Where mermaids lived. Of course, Steve didn’t know if there were mermaids in the harbour, but honestly, he wasn’t going to take the chance. He had to warn Tony somehow, make him lure the Witch away from the water.
Steve gripped his shield tight enough to stop his trembling and jumped into the fight. He couldn’t reach them, high as they were, but he got an idea when he accidentally ran into a stray spell ray.
He just wants to hold Steve again.
His heart isn’t beating, and he hurts, but Steve’s arms are around him, they’re touching from head to toe, Steve a searing heat all along Tony’s back. The pain almost doesn’t register beneath the awful relief.
“Iron Man! I was looking for you!” A deep baritone rang out, just as a tall and broad-shouldered man entered the gym. He was wearing what could only be described as the American flag turned into tights, which made Tony’s hopes go up, even if his clothing looked more fit for a circus than anything else. Or maybe a comic book. The beefcake’s boots made Tony think of the musketeers he’d read about when he was a child, even if they’d never been such a bright red in the books. These two fellas sure wore bright colours. But the red, white, and blue were a good sign. Better that than black, white, and red, right? Maybe he really was in the US, and this would turn out to be a simple mistake.
“You wound me, Iron Man.”
Well. If he had to be honest: no, he wouldn’t. But he would like to spend it with Natasha. And Stark didn’t seem to have any siblings, or even family. But he had his friends, Jarvis, Potts, and—and others. That he’d never seen or heard about.
He continued hollering at the castle to slow down, which it did, although only enough for him to run after the receding door and knock breathlessly. The moment he hit the wood, the door swung open, narrowly missing his face, and he stumbled into the building. The door closed with a bang, and Steve lay on the ground, trying to get his breath back. His legs were jelly, his heart had never beaten faster, and he sounded like a train whistle when he sucked in mouthful after mouthful of air.
“I don’t know. It’s hard to keep track of, sometimes, all the names and teams. Then again, you wouldn’t know, would you. Now that you have everything recorded and filed.”
“You’re not making sense, Iron Man. We looked him over, you saw that this is him. You’re not acting like yourself, Shellhead, what’s going on? Did something happen to you as well?”
Iron Man flinched slightly, got up, paced a little, then stopped dead in the center of the lab. He held his hands up, pleading.
Steve’s eyes are half-lidded, his gaze fixed on Tony’s mouth. His body is thrumming with contained energy, but his hands are open and lax against the mat. His thighs flex around Tony. Steve is all power and strength, a mountain lion in a human skin. Right now, he’s giving that power over to Tony. He’s waiting for Tony’s next move, still and silent. The perfect image of obedience. Tony could devour him whole and Steve would only bare his neck to make the access easier. It’s a heady feeling. It’s so easy to imagine a similar scene in a different setting. Steve looking at him like that, surrendering to Tony, sprawled across Tony’s bed. Tony wouldn’t even need to cuff him, he’d stay still just because Tony told him to, using that extraordinary muscle control to move less than a statue. Tony would lick him all over, suck bruises into his neck and collarbones. He’d play with Steve’s nipples, get them nice and hard, until they were as red as Steve’s lips. Tony would nip at his chest, his stomach, his trembling abdominals, skip to the inside of Steve’s thighs, and Steve would just shudder and take it. He would make those high, needy, bitten-off noises. Tony would tease him until he begged for more, until he begged for a real bite, for teeth under his skin, for his blood to leave him. He’d plead for Tony to bite him, suck him, take him.
“I—I don’t eat hearts. That would be a little too ironic, even for me. Where have you even heard those stories?”
“I took Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hyperion and Starbrand with me the first time, but they gradually disappeared until only we were left. I don’t know why, and I don’t know why we’re in a time loop, and nothing I do changes anything.”
“Aren’t you
His newfound energy lasted until he got back to the shop. He just managed to push the door shut behind him before he lost his strength and crashed to the ground with Tony still in his arms. His heart was beating out of his chest, it felt like, and he was sweating profusely, his arms trembling from the prolonged effort. It took a while before he extricated himself from under Tony and stood up.
Steve didn’t know how long he’d been in the ice. Time had lost all meaning, turning to nothing. What good was it to feel the seconds pass if he couldn’t even move his chest enough to breathe? The cold was everywhere, invading his lungs, seeping into his bones. He could still feel his heartbeat, its sluggish rhythm the only thing breaking the monotony of his situation.
Why had he stopped?
He hadn’t been fast enough to run away before the other soldier could load his musket, and now it was too late. From this distance, the bullet would hit him with deadly accuracy.
And Tony did not have a whole year on his hands, thank you very much. There was a war going on, and he wasn’t strictly speaking allowed on the Swedish island Gotland, seeing as the kingdom’s supposed neutrality in the war meant that they didn’t really look kindly upon any foreign secret service agents running around.
He couldn’t believe someone that young would be so cruel already.
“Oh, nothing much. I just wanted to see the rest of it. Now, if you could…”
Tony wondered whether Stark was aware of what he was doing. He wondered whether Cap himself was aware. He watched them as Steve gave Stark a quick run-down of what Tony and him had talked about in his absence, and realized that, no, they weren’t aware.
Strange and James were both injured, Strange cradling one of his hands close to his chest, James holding a rag against his temple. Around them, the suits of armour lay unmoving, some of them destroyed, others unmarred.
When he was done, he sat on the chair, observing Jarvis. Jarvis, who was glowing red and orange, just like any ordinary fire. He’d been so different the day before, glittering in the colours of the rainbow. Thinking back to it, Steve came to the realisation that Jarvis had glowed and shined just like the stars that Steve had almost caught. There had been the same explosion of colours, the same colours even.
“What did you say?”
Maybe not Captain
As it turned out, it wasn’t. Jarvis had multiple examples of people Stark had taken in until they could continue on with their life. He’d found a teenager on his porch, once, and instead of sending him away, had fed him and housed him until the young man had admitted to being an orphan. The young man had sat on Stark’s porch because he knew no one would dare make him move from such a powerful man’s doorstep. Stark had helped him get an education and now he lived in Queen’s city, specialising in glue-like fluids and arachnids. There was another teenager he had helped, some years after that, a brilliant girl that had lost her father in a street fight. She’d been passionate about automatons, and he had helped her develop her skills in magic and machines. She was living with her mother, now, setting up her own shop, which she’d named Ironheart.
Tony smiled harder. “Of course. Why wouldn’t I be?”
Fury slipped a piece of paper from his file, placing it on Phil’s lap. “You remember filing this, correct? The missing person file on Tony Stark?”
For years, the East River has served as a mode for transportation, regardless of the season. In the summer, boats flooded through, offering multiple options for transport. The cold winters on New York could always create ice bridges for people to cross. For a while, it even served as a highway for smuggling in booze during the prohibition era. Now, it only made sense that HYDRA would be using the same route, most likely using it to smuggle in weapons. No way anyone would run into cops out on a body of water.
say to Clint. Phil was family to all of them, but to Clint? To Clint he was everything. And now it’s all gone, in a blink of an eye. Steve could understand what that was like, but it crushed him to know that there was someone else that shared the same fate.
“We’re heading to see Clint after you. Then Phil. Not sure what I’m gonna do about Bruce and Thor. You know they’re in Norway?”
“Excuse me,” Pepper interrupted. “You better not be dragging him into another mess of yours,” she said with a frown, her arms crossing.
“Do you have any real questions for me? Because otherwise I’m going to have to ask you to leave. Again.”
“I’m glad,” Steve smiled.
Tony cleared his throat awkwardly. Steve’s head snapped towards his and
“Just passing through,” Tony said nonchalantly. “I was going to make something to eat if you’d like something.”
Steve groaned, rubbing his hands over his face. “I have no idea. Who knows what Stark will do now that someone has made a- wait,” Steve stopped himself. “Do you hear that?”
“What are you gonna do?” laughed Tony. “Murder the broad? We’re supposed to be keeping a low profile here.”
Happy had called him in terror; there had been an explosion in his office.
Loki panted, his mind working slowly as exhaustion caught up with him. The tunnels that Barton led him through were twisted, the man seemingly taking random turns as if to throw off their tails. “Eventually,” Loki finally answered. “They all want the same thing, but for different reasons. How long before they realize they don’t need the other?”
Unfortunately, that didn’t make Alexander Pierce feel any better. Weeks ago, Pierce thought they had finally won; they had finally hit the jackpot. They had a potential location on The Captain’s hideout. Hook had cornered Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. For good this time.
The archer nodded automatically, putting down his gun to give Steve his full attention. “Not here,” Steve continued. “Let’s go up to my office, alright?”
Natasha scoffed. “Are you kidding me? I know you’re sleeping with Steve. But look, here you are, at 3 a.m., out here. Is he just another one of your conquests? You can’t even spend the whole night with him, can you?”
He turned around for the final time, walking back towards-
Steve nodded slightly, watching as Stark sauntered past him. "Get back to it," he said to the rest of his crew. Not waiting to be told twice, everyone around him startled, pushing around each other to get back to work. Steve called Clint over. "Stay alert. If anything goes wrong, take care of him." Clint gave a terse nod, perching himself over in the corner of the room, giving him a perfect angle of Steve's office.
Steve groaned, rubbing at his temples again.
was dead. Each day was a blur of alcohol, each night nothing more than a faint whiff of smoke and blinding lights. It wasn't until the day of the funeral that everything had changed. Obie had found him passed out in some coke den, dragged him into the shower to spray him with a icy spray to sober him up. Tony sat idly, face blank as he was dressed, carted off in a car, and pulled to the cemetery. He didn't want to be there - he'd made his position very clear. He said that he'd only attend if Jarvis would be laid to rest the same day. It was then that they told him that Jarvis was already taken care of, already laying in the ground. They didn't even bother to hold a ceremony for him. To say Tony took that well was a lie - he did, after all, end up in a coke den.
Not even bothering hanging up, Steve tossed the phone aside, bringing his hand to cup Tony’s face. He could hear Peter starting to cry in the background, but Steve could barely hear him over his own distress. His heart was pounding in his ears and his body trembled as he tried to wake Tony.
“Two hours.”
Rhodey was redeployed, Happy was in a coma, and Tony certainly wasn’t going in there by himself.
"You know, my dad had a lot of sayings. Lessons, he would call them," he continued. "I didn't get a lot of time with him, hell, I didn't even get to say goodbye, but I'll always have what he taught me. One saying that I got on a regular basis was
Back then he had been Captain America to Tony; the guy fresh out the ice, clearly too young and traumatised to be thrust into another war so soon, but with enough arrogance to prove his place in the brave new world. The legend, the hero. The man Howard wasted his fatherhood to find.
Fuck. He was jumping to conclusions.
“Barton…” Bucky murmured, awkwardly looking between Tony and Steve with a grimace.
They stopped shy, noses brushing against each other as they savoured the quiet of Steve's rooms around them. This moment was precious. Here, not even the sounds of late-night traffic could penetrate. Any trouble waking members of the Mansion were in would have to wait. Tony could feel the warmth of Steve's face against his own and it was no effort at all to follow that feeling; to kiss his friend again for the first time in over ten years.
Hill nodded slightly. “When I last checked in with you, you had three seconds to switch out the cartridges.”
going to be the one to feed him more. This was highly sensitive stuff. How long before Stark turns on them? Who’s to say he wasn’t already working with HYDRA?
Clint frowned. “Are you going to run off again?”
“Steve, you can’t go in there! Come on, the cops are coming!” Clint yanked and yanked at Steve, but the man kept managing to pull back away. "
“Yep, we got them all.”
It was quiet for a while, but Steve knew Tony hadn’t fallen back asleep. If anything, Tony was being as stubborn as ever and forcing himself to stay awake, if only to try and get out of the med bay quicker. He turned slightly, towards Steve. He must have finally felt the wet patch that was slowly accumulating on his back from Steve’s tears.
The man was mostly hidden by the shadows of the buildings, but Tony could still see that his entire focus was on The Captain and the car. "Do a scan on him as well."
After leaving the cemetery, Tony had managed to stumble to a main street. It wasn’t long before Tony found himself in a cab, on his way home. Tony had been thankful the driver didn’t comment on how he looked. Knowing that they lived in New York City, the driver probably saw shit like that daily. While Tony could only think about nothing except for a warm shower and his soft bed on the ride home, he found himself in the lab.
They were all going to die.
“Photo quality?”
“What do you mean wait? I basically just said that I’m the Thelma to your Louise, and you want to wait?”
What a hypocrite. You know what that got him? A bullet in his brain and a half-assed car accident cover up. He was in over his head, and frankly? He got what was coming to him. So don’t ask me again, Obie. I won’t do it.”
The Captain jostled against the hard bench, the book he was sketching in sent flying to the ground. “What the hell are you doing here?” he asked, his shining blue eyes opened wide, glistening in the sunlight.
“Fuck that,” Bucky snarled, legs shaking as he tried to walk over back over to Steve. Hill grabbed at his arm.
Barnes froze.
“I need you to do something for me,” Tony explained. “No biggie.”
“Well, sorry, Blackbeard. You’re going to have to schedule an appointment.”
“Yes, Tony. For the millionth time,
He just wanted this nightmare to be over.
“He still not answering?”
his everything, and to have it thrown to the side like it was just a mild inconvenience disgusted him. “HYDRA is everyone’s problem," he seethed. "They’re not going to stop with The Commandos. It won’t be long until they start attacking other businesses. Businesses like Asgard.”
“What the hell are you doing here?” Tony pressed.
“What did you say you did today, Tony?”
Tony spun around quickly after accepting that Steve was still alright, and reached back down to help heft Barnes out of the water. The man was almost as pale as Steve, his breath coming in harsh pants. How he was able to drag over two hundred pounds of a wet Steve with one arm, Tony would never know. Tony threw the man’s jacket back around his shoulders, checking he was okay. The man was shaking with violent tremors, but he grunted out a short confirmation before shooing Tony back towards Rogers.
There was a flash of emotion over Clint’s face, but it was gone as soon as it appeared, the man resorting to nodding numbly.
He should have turned around before stopping his heart.
Steve strained all he could, but he was stuck in place, a horrible repeat of that night so many months ago. The Witch was close to him now, so close that she reached up and rest a hand on his cheek. If he could, he would have bared his teeth at her.
There wasn’t any sound in here.
“What happens on Midsummer Day?”
The force of the explosion threw Steve off his feet, hurling him at the nearest wall, and he braced himself, curled into a ball and hoped that the shield would protect him from the worst.
They didn’t seem like bad people, though. Cap was friendly enough, and even if Iron Man was more suspicious, he wasn’t hostile anymore. Besides, the advanced lab could come in handy if Tony wanted to go back to his Rhodey and Pepper. God, he didn’t even know if it was possible. For all he knew, he’d ended in a twisted dream, or he’d died and this was the afterlife. He felt his heart beat faster at the thought. He didn’t want to pretend anymore. He wanted to go home. Man, what had he been thinking? He really wasn’t cut out for spy work.
He loses faith, is what happens. He becomes bitter and cynical and all his hope and belief is turned into rage and hate.
He walked and walked and walked.
Steve stood up, panting heavily, his chest metaphorically on fire, and watched as her flames died, as her frame melted into the ground, until all that was left of her were the two halves of Janet’s heart.
His excuse to leave was as obvious to Steve as it was to Jarvis, but Tony didn’t seem to care that he was transparent in his need to leave. For what it was worth, he looked really unwell.
You only know compromise, Steve told him. Well, compromise is better than being dead. Tony’s only alive because he compromised, so long ago, in that cave. He’s alive because he knows when to bend your head and find another way. Steve’s survived on stubbornness and principles alone. And sometimes even that wasn’t enough.
Maybe he would wait with throwing anything.
It’s on the tip of his tongue. He can’t say it.
Tony thinks that the only thing that Steve’s been doing is shouting at Tony and bashing his head in, but he keeps the comment to himself. Best not to anger the man who has your life in his hands.
The rumbling in his ear has turned into a soft, satisfied, murmur.
“And by that, I mean that she’ll kill me, or, well. I’ll be as good as dead.”
Steve decided that if Stark didn’t want him here, he would have thrown Steve out already, so he could just as well make himself comfortable while he waited for the master of the house to greet him or kill him.
Trying to fight against Captain America in his full righteous fury is futile. Whatever you do, he’ll find a way to win. Because he’s right. Because he stands for what is true, for what is good. He’ll even die if he has to. But you’ll always lose in the end. He knows it, you know it, but you’ll still try because you have no other choice, because you have to, because this is for the greater good, and he’ll shout at you that you’ve got everything wrong, that you used him, that you betrayed him, and that
Which was a lie as well. Steve just hoped Stark didn’t believe in those things himself.
“Three conditions?”
Sir Coulson came running in, whispering furiously at the lord’s ear for a moment before running away as swiftly as he came. Lord Fury straightened up, eyeing the armour inquisitively.
Steve’s telling them what’s happening. The muted horror in their eyes makes Tony’s gut roil. He knows it was necessary, but now that the charade’s over, he desperately wants to rewind time, to refuse to mind-wipe Steve, at the risk of getting mind-wiped too. He wants to curl up, let the incursions swallow him whole, anything to avoid the ire of the man he would do anything for. He wants to drop to his knees and beg for forgiveness, anything to redeem himself.
The words were whispered, but Steve still heard them. Hearing Tony so desperate made his heart ache. What did it matter if Tony didn’t love him? Steve cared for him, and Tony cared for Steve, and that would have to be enough. Matters of the heart were not important right now. Tony was dying, and Steve wanted to be there for him.
“Good morning, Mr. Rogers. I’m Tony Stark, and this is my fire demon Jarvis. Are those fried eggs?”
But the reason that the scarecrow was adorned like that was of little import because he didn’t have any use for it. He put it against the bushes and followed the snarling sound. A grey dog was growling, trying to get away from where it was half under the bushes, but unable to, due to its long and shaggy fur being twisted and stuck in the thorns. It was snarling and snapping its teeth at nothing. Steve tried to calm the dog down, but the animal didn’t stop struggling no matter how much Steve pet him or shushed him. In the end, Steve had to rip its fur off the thorns. The moment the dog was free, it ran away, still growling under its breath. Steve watched as it ran downhill and disappeared in the growing shadows.
Steve’s chest constricted at the words. Stark couldn’t know who he really was, he would be angry or disappointed because of Steve’s earlier dismissal, maybe he’d kill him—oh God. That night, Stark was planning to seduce Steve, wasn’t he? Steve had been right in his suspicion, after all. He was lucky he’d refused, because he’d be a heartless corpse by now if he’d taken Stark up on that offer.
With every finished piece, a fraction of his stress disappeared, until he felt like himself again. When he looked up, it was completely dark outside, the stars shining faintly. How long had he painted? He hadn’t realised, Jarvis had kept his room illuminated with a small floating flame. He heard the front door slam, and his heart lurched in his chest. Who—
“It was a stupid coincidence. I was in Brooklyne, trying to find an empty building for us to move into, and I got distracted when I saw your painting supply shop. I thought, hey, you know what, that could work, and then I—”
Steve’s neck is a wonderful shade of red, blood rushing to the surface capillaries, just millimetres away from the surface. Tony wants to see where the blush ends. He puts a little more weight on his knee, just because he can, and stands up. Steve loses no time in turning around, the blush ever more pronounced on his face.
Of course, Tony would never do that. He’s part of a team, can’t just disappear in the middle of a fight. He’s not exactly inconspicuous. Besides, he’s supposed to save the civilians, not drink them. It wouldn’t do to put SHIELD on his back.
“I’m going to disappear soon. Thank you for the tips, Stark. And Cap, I’ll make sure to find you in my reality. Such a pretty fella like you, would be a shame to never meet you.”
“Good morning, my dear. A bit of a peculiar question, but are you by any chance in possession of half a song or poem? I am missing half of my paper, you see, I was careless with it the other day.”
While his body convulses, choking on blood, Tony has the hazy thought that an accidental decapitation isn’t really the type of execution reserved for traitors.
And wasn’t that the truth? There were still unaddressed questions, and secrets on both sides, but the more Steve learned to know Stark, the better they got along.
“You turned the disk to the black part, didn’t you?”
Steve and Tony’s fates were more intertwined than Steve could ever have guessed.
He doesn’t know what’s happening, but Steve’s killed him at least once, he’s killed Steve—
Steve fist cracks against his jaw, and, oh, he must be angry beyond reason, because there is none of the careful control Steve always has over himself. His punch is explosively deadly, too forceful, and Tony’s jaw splinters, shredding his cheek and tongue, and the momentum twists his neck until there’s a sickening snap, and the world blinks out.
Cap couldn’t quite hide the forlorn expression on his face. How was he taking the news of Iron Man’s identity, Tony wondered? It didn’t feel right to pry though, so he started cooing at one of the Iron Man gauntlets instead.
Was the contract with Jarvis making him especially vulnerable to the curse? Had the Witch of the Waste been cursed in a similar fashion? What had happened to her fire demon? Miss Potts had said that the fire demon had led her to her destruction, but what had the fire demon gained from that?
He was also going to give her two words about what she thought she was doing. Since when had Steve needed someone to protect him? He could take care of himself, had always done, had lived alone and it had all worked out more than fine. He didn’t need some knight in shining armour, thank you very much, and just because he’d lost some muscle didn’t mean that he couldn’t survive on his own.
He turned to look at the fireplace, where Tony was sound asleep in his chair, his head dangerously close to Jarvis’ core. Jarvis was sleeping too, and when Steve looked at the door, it was closed, the circle on the green part.
He wondered what was happening outside of the ice.
His smile had too many teeth to be friendly. Steve realised he might be in over his head, and suddenly he was glad that he had Jarvis at his back. The armour hadn’t moved, but it glowed warmly at Steve’s side. He decided to ignore the unsettling fact that he was being watched, preferring to address the matter of interest.
Tony isn’t dead. He’s slumped against a street light, watching the hotel go up in flames. No one died, the police are saying. A miracle, Christmas come early.
Tony Stark.” He wouldn’t let Iron Man sway Cap, dammit. Besides, why was Iron Man so adamant about him not being Tony Stark? The teleportation hadn’t changed his appearance, had it?
It shouldn’t hurt, but it still does. Steve knows Tony always gives him his codes, no matter how they feel about each other. He has the same codes as always, and now Steve is stripping the last shred of armour from Tony, leaving him bare, utterly vulnerable.
It’s everything Tony has dreamed of and more. Steve’s devouring him, enveloping him whole, taking and taking and taking everything he can take from Tony, and Tony lets himself be kissed and smiles through treacherous tears. He clings to Steve, and hangs on and hopes this isn’t a dream.
Maybe he could make a cup of coffee for Tony and bring it to him, have an excuse to make sure that he was alright?
Janet had had her heart taken over by Jocasta.
against his skull—
Steve’s voice is a quiet rumble in Tony’s ear.
“Are you, are you sure this will work?”
Iron Man scoffed, and Cap’s eyebrows twitched at the sound.
Steve takes his head between his hands and brings him closer and Tony can’t help it, he glances at Steve’s lips, he doesn’t know what the fuck is happening, and Steve’s hand moves to cradle his jaw and he looks at Steve’s eyes and they’re cold as ice and the hands tighten around him and Steve snaps his neck.
She sighed, eyes soft and sad.
“We need to move.”
He walks past the mansion, by accident, or maybe not. He can’t look at it. He lived there, once. When he was still a hero. It’s home to other people now.
The marks had grown again. The highest one had reached his Adam’s apple, moving in time with Tony’s swallowing. The lowest ones disappeared under the line of the cloth that had pooled around Tony’s hips.
Steve tells Tony that he won’t put himself in serious danger, and Tony believes him. This isn’t worse than little kids holding their breath until they can’t anymore. Breathing is vital, as is a beating heart. Tony is just playing it a little more high-tech.
“I can’t, Tony. You know it doesn’t work like that.”
Steve couldn’t imagine Jarvis willingly turning Tony evil. But could an external source change that?
He had to find a way to stop the curse, he had to, he couldn’t leave Ste—he couldn’t leave his friends like that. Steve couldn’t lose him, but what was he to do? He couldn’t stand by and do nothing. He would fight the Witch, use his shield, anything.
Who would find him? A nameless agent? Hill herself? Or maybe Carol, if there’s Avengers business. He wonders if they would cry. He doesn’t think so. They have better, more important things to do. Tony doesn’t deserve more than a moment of silent contemplation.They’d look at the broken parts of his body and understand that it was just a matter of time.
It sounded simple enough. Find a way to break the contract and get his body back. Steve had nothing to lose.
Steve didn’t like how Stark’s lips were curling upwards, his eyes twinkling merrily.
Jarvis swallowed a log loudly, crackling everywhere. If Steve had interpreted that correctly, it corresponded to a human clearing their throat. Stark put his head in his hands and sighed deeply, gazing at his plate.
Tony cursed under his breath.
Logically, telling the King was Steve’s duty.
Steve got the answer to his own question when his gaze fell on Stark’s chest.
“Well! Let’s see where the castle moved to!”
“What Ms. Potts means is that we’re glad that you’re back, and that if you ever do this again, we’ll both quit. Sir.”
The same dead voice, the same empty eyes he’d had when he first met Steve. If Steve hadn’t been able to see his chest moving, he’d have said he was dead.
He smiled his most innocent smile and hoped that would be enough.
“Amazing! We’ll do that. I’ve always loved flowers.”
“See? I don’t have anything to do with any disappearances, and I will never eat any hearts either, so you can calm down now. I won’t deny the seducing part, but you can’t blame me for looking for a bit of fun, can you?”
He was only light, a bright beam aimed at the Witch, who was too close to dodge it. It hit her head on. She managed to deflect a part of it, but Steve jumped in and used the shield to reflect it back to her.
He’s right. Not so long ago, Tony spent thirty seven minutes without a beating heart and pulled through with a clean bill of health. It was most likely Steve who performed the CPR. Tony never asked, and Steve never said a word about it. When Tony stopped his heart that time, he overloaded his heart via the armour. He doesn’t actually need the armour to stop his heart. He can send a simple command, override Extremis’ health safeguards, and manually stop his heart. A simple electric shock should be enough to start his heart again. The armour can be in stand-by, ready to jump in if anything goes wrong.
Steve gripped his shield tighter, staring at Jarvis, body tense and mind running. Tony had fled towards the harbour, Steve realised.
Steve breathed out, his legs shaky. For one second, he’d thought…
“If you stay away from the sea, there is no risk that you’d meet a mermaid. Aren’t they a reclusive species? I doubt you’ll meet any.”
“Where will we move?”
Tony’s last day couldn’t be tomorrow. There had to be more time left, they’d just talked about how they felt, something good was happening between them, it was too soon, way too soon—
Steve never talks to him, never gets near enough for Tony to see his eyes. He doesn’t really know what to think of it, so he peers down the bottle instead. When he’s drunk half of it, there’s always this fleeting moment of euphoria, where everything will take a golden haze, where nothing will hurt, where he forgets what he’s doing and why.
He breathed in, out, and looked at his surroundings.
“Tony. What are these marks?”
“I know! I know. It was a long time ago, alright? But it’s a little problematic. Because the King doesn’t care one bit about my past relationships—says it’s my own fault, I’ll show him “my own fault”, just you see—and I need a reason for him to discard me. He can ask someone else to risk their lives against the Witch, I need to be as far from her as possible. But how can I convince him to—oh. Oh! I know!”
Tony doesn’t need Extremis to tell him that Steve won’t make it. He’s too pale, too still except for his desperate breaths. Steve must know it too, because his eyes are too wide, his pupils too small.
Steve grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him until his teeth rattle.
Steve laughed out loud, hugging Tony close, revelling in the slighter man against him. They’d done it! The Witch was gone, she hadn’t managed to kill Tony, they could still make it out—
Tony’s never seen Steve in such a state. At least, he doesn’t remember he has.
It won’t hurt anyone. At worst, he doesn’t feel Steve. At best, he gets twenty seconds with him.
To his surprise, Jarvis answered:
He hurried downstairs, where Tony was sitting at the table, rubbing at his chest again. Steve put his hands on the backrest on the nearest chair, catching his breath. Tony smelled faintly like flowers, and it hit Steve that he’d gone out through the
“I can change where the door leads to. We’ll keep the hills, since that is the castle’s physical location, but I’ll change where the red and blue doors lead to. I might change the black one, but I think I’ll keep it.”
“Now that you know why you can’t be me, tell us who you are.”
They lock gazes. Tony’s chest is heaving against Steve’s. Their hearts are beating almost in tandem. Steve’s shirt is soaked through, leaving little to the imagination. Tony would just need to lower himself those last few inches to kiss Steve. He could bend his neck, bite at one of Steve’s nipples. Tony is willing to bet his fortune that Steve would arch beautifully into the pain. With Steve’s heightened pain threshold, Tony would be able to bite hard enough to bruise. He’d see the capillaries burst before his eyes. All that blood, just a bite away.
Steve latched onto the words of the man. She wanted to know about him? And Tony had been looking for him?
Cap flinched slightly, and Stark jerked.
He’s cold.
Where was he hit? Where is the bullet?
“Has Stark ever loved someone?”
“What’s—Tony, what did you do?” Steve hisses in his ear, and pushes forward, crushing Tony between himself and nothing but thin air.
James had gone back to sleep, likely needing to recuperate. After making sure that he had everything he needed in terms of food and water, Steve sat down at the table and started to draft his letter to Natasha.
He lifted his hand, and—
Steve’s mirth at the mental imagery disappeared when he remembered that Stark was powerful enough that the King wanted him to be court sorcerer, and realised that the further Natasha was from him, the better.
. Tony had been flirting with him the whole damn time!
Tony readied his repulsor. Thor and Bruce had told them all about Loki's change of heart during Ragnarok and the reclamation of his family name -
He didn’t need to ask for his help; Steve got the hint. He would never need to ask again if Steve had anything to say about it.
When he was three years old he understood that if he avoided the eighth plank in and fourth across, his socked feet would not make a noise to alert the nanny of the month. He never understood how Jarvis - the gentleman, not the A.I. - found him in the middle of the night, despite his careful avoidance of the eighth plank in and fourth across. He would allow Tony a biscuit with the little dried fruits and sugar on top but made sure he ate with a napkin and a saucer.
“It wasn’t that,” He confessed, his fingers tensing up as they dropped to Tony’s shoulders, trapping him in place. He probably didn’t even realise he was doing it. “He was awful familiar with you. He called you Tony.”
"An exaggeration from the press, I'm sure," he dismissed with an airy wave of his hand.
“You’re still so hot,” he said with a laugh and if his voice caught on emotion Steve didn’t mention it.
. It wouldn’t be the first time someone saw Tony Stark as good for nothing but a fuck and some tech, but for
FRIDAY replied, gentle Irish notes cautious.
But it didn't explain how the footage of himself, asleep and alone in the workshop, came to be. They had put the Stones back, so it couldn’t be footage from an off-shoot universe leaking into theirs either; the Stones were where they needed to be. It wasn’t possible for a duplicate reality to exist in tandem when they were anchored.
“Yes.”
He almost followed Steve into the bathroom, but chose to be responsible and instead gathered up the soiled bedsheets. He dumped them in the laundry chute, then opened the curtains and picked the pillows up off the floor. Tony touched the bedframe with a contemplative hand, pausing for a few moments to absorb just how different the day was compared to just twenty-four hours before.
And yet, with his armour dead around him, cutting into his face, Tony wished for nothing else than to die.
Don’t waste your breath, Tony wants to say, but his words won’t come. He desperately wets his lips, head feverish with thoughts that trip over themselves.
That was a very cryptic answer. Would it work if Steve thought very hard about it? Did he have to walk somewhere and wait for the stars to come to him? Or would he be transported to the place if he desired it? And what did “in his heart” mean, really? Was it enough to think about it, or did it have to be an unconscious desire as well?
—, emotional stress, and the physical exertion of swinging the pan was too much for Steve. His arms hurt, he felt like there was a weight on his chest, and he was almost positive that he’d sprained one of his wrists. He was
When Steve entered the kitchen, Jarvis was awake again. He turned to face Steve, his fiery face frowning.
, power of a super-soldier until he’s straddling you, pinning you to the ground, doing his best to rip you in half.
The snow has buried his last bottle.
“I couldn’t escape, but I had to, had to warn Nat—”
Tony smiled, pleased, and stood up.
“What, doesn’t he think I can handle myself?”
Oh. A garden? No, never mind that, Stark had thought the skull looked
Tony watches as Steve walks up the steps to the entrance. His back is straight. Tony doesn’t know if he’s found a new spark of fighting spirit since Tony left him in the cell, or if it’s just for show.
Tony’s eyes widened, and Steve could see every emotion that played in them. Surprise, incredulity, gratitude, joy, and hope. Tony pushed himself up, helped by Steve, and his face lit up when he saw Jarvis.
He’s got a meeting in ten minutes.
Steve cut him off, clasping his right hand between his own.
“Are you alright? Here, let me…”
He turned to Jarvis then, incredulous.
When Stark came back, Tony was in the middle of telling his adventure with Poseidon’s trident, Cap laughing and gasping at the right moments. Cap was with his back to the door, but Tony clearly saw how Stark stiffened when he saw them. He walked over a tad too forcefully and said:
But why was he flirting with her? Couldn’t they have a professional relationship? Or was Tony incapable of spending any time near a good-looking person without flirting?
They came back to the castle just in time for lunch.
He puts on his armour, intent on flying away. If he can’t survive in close proximity to Steve, he just needs to go away, hide somewhere while he figures out how to fix this. Maybe he can open up a communication channel with Steve, work things out with the safety of distance between them.
“You’re going to regret winding me up, Tony,” Steve said, firm and punctured by the effort of pistoning his middle and ring fingers into Tony's hole. He was breathing harshly and Tony knew it wasn’t due to the effort of maintaining his rough pace.
“I’d best be going too,” Steve said contritely and Tony consciously stopped himself from feeling offended. He wasn't sure why it had taken him so long to notice that Steve was avoiding him; he could suddenly see it plain as day.
, which I think was sort of a joke because you know his memories are still a bit- but I didn’t want to say anything. Still, it means you don’t have to worry about him not liking you back?”
Stepping down from active fieldwork had been an easy choice after he was back on his feet. Tony was glad that he had come to the conclusion on his own that he was (for now) better off as a behind the scenes guy: a consultant and benefactor, as planned from the beginning all those years ago. He took a roundabout way to get there, but he'd chosen it for himself this time. Thanos was dead by his and Thor's collective hand, depending on the way one squinted at the mess they made of the timeline. The point still stood regardless: Thanos was gone and Tony had earned a little holiday time.
With a grunt, Tony silenced the footage and let his eyes wash over the images before him. The third Captain America -
"Thor-" Cap started, gripping his shield tighter and readying a fighting stance.
Warm fingers grazed Tony’s cheek in tender touch - drawing him back to the present - before slowly falling to the small space between their chests. A deep exhale followed that touch and Tony felt it as, from one instant to the next, Steve finally fell into true sleep.
but rather than starting in on the arm, Tony opened up his ongoing pet project of reinstating J.A.R.V.I.S’ old data files with F.R.I.D.A.Y’s.
“Yes, yes. But, go slow to start. I don’t want to come yet, I don't want to forget this.”
“Stay,” he said, like a man to his dog (albeit, a kind man who loved his dog very much) and Tony found he wouldn’t be able to move if he wanted to. He met Cap’s heated gaze and smirked as the shadow of his early paranoia slipped away to make room for keen arousal. He was glad he had the forethought to cloak the balcony.
"Yeah, hm," Tony replied and brought Steve out of his thoughts once more. Tony was looking away and he took his protective eyewear off before hitting them against the back of his hand - fidgeting, working himself up to say something that made him feel vulnerable. Years ago Steve would have assumed Tony was being dismissive, too self-involved to hold a full conversation, but in reality, he was presenting a mask of a casualness. He was familiar enough with Tony’s quirks and habits that he could see it now.
Upon such occurrences, Steve was clammy and cold to the touch, but now he was hot and crowding up against Tony like he was wearing the little red number he liked under his fine pin-stripe trousers.
And it was suggestive, Steve realised now. It was not one of Tony’s best lines, but it was indeed an invitation that he would not have registered before. He would have assumed Tony was mocking him with unnecessarily promiscuous speech: for a long time, he thought that was how Tony liked to disrespect and frustrate him.
The rest of the UN would likely take a few more weeks to collectively pour over the documents and sub-papers, but likewise: as long as the bulk was left unchanged, the proposed NNSA's (officially titled the quaint: Negotiated [inter-]National Super-Being Agreement. Tony didn’t come up with it, otherwise it would have been a lot cooler) would be passed into the implementation stage. When that happened, Tony doubted that Ross would last a week more in the role of Secretary of State.
can't make anything easy, can you?"
of it all.
It ran dexterity, tension, strength, heat, pressure, all seamlessly. As a precaution, the back of the forearm hid a photon-shield; his palm a contained repulsor, and he had an option to stun anytime he sent a finger gun someone’s way. Occasionally he would tinker with his new arm, testing to see if he could make it more sensitive, more dexterous,
“If you’re going to vomit please don’t do it here,” Sam grumbled to Barton, stabbing at his plate as he scrolled through his phone in his other hand.
Four more black coffees later - three of which were decaf, thank you kindly - Tony’s eyes were feeling dry and scratchy. He ran his fingers over his beard thoughtfully and waited for FRIDAY to finish actioning the latest reprogramming updates.
“That’s it, fuck, you’re perfect,” Tony groaned. He cried out, tugging tightly at Steve’s hair as a third finger entered him. “Goddamn, I hate how fucking perfect you are, how good your dick is going to feel inside me.”
Tony had thought through the sinking feeling in his stomach; those Stones were far more trouble than they were worth.
He ripped free the rest of Tony's shirt buttons to reveal the light of his original arc reactor embedded in his chest and the toned stomach below. The buttons of Tony's trousers received the same treatment. With a violent jerk of his wrists, he could see sharply trimmed pubic hair and the base of Tony’s trapped erection. Steve bit his lip, eyes roaming hungrily over the bounty and splendour of Tony's form. "You're perfect," he said. It was too much -
He cleared his throat and smiled up at Steve briefly, reassuring, before he turned his back and wandered the living room, poking and prodding at anything not bolted down.
Tony caught his gaze and stretched out to grip the far edge of the bench above his head in self-imposed bondage. The artful position showed off the muscles in his arms, the glare of the arc reactor, the hollow of his stomach, his leaking prick and his balls swollen tucked close to his shaft. He squeezed Tony’s balls, hot and throbbing under his palm as he fucked him with the full length of his cock. He used his other hand to hold Tony’s hips down, keeping him still so he could thrust into him roughly as they both wanted.
"Of course we are, Cap,” Tony snorted - ignorant to the weight behind Steve's message - and patted Steve’s bicep with a smirk. Unable to help himself, Steve chuckled and tilted his head curiously, waiting for him to explain. Tony met his gaze over the top of his sunglasses with a wink.
Ever since waking up he had wanted to talk to Steve, to say that he heard him loud and clear during their time heist together. Whenever Steve had said
“Fuck you, Rogers,” Tony cursed between kisses, teeth kneading at Steve’s lower lip.
When he stopped grinding, Steve’s breaths were still sharp; as though he was in the midst of a panic. He was shaking above Tony so much that he wondered if Steve was too scared to move lest he crumbled apart. Tony kept kissing him, coaxing them both through the unusual and surreal torrent of emotions that had passed between them. He deepened the kiss and slowed the pace, easing his fingers through Steve’s damp hair to rub against the back of his neck in soothing lines that ebbed to and fro along its length.
"Can you blame me?" Steve replied with a little smirk, mouth twisting up on one side, just like it used to. Tony could almost cheer with relief; Steve’s smile was such a sight for sore eyes. His chest bubbled excitedly and he laughed again from sheer joy.
Across the table, Thor wore a pair of blackout shades, although they had listed to the tip of his nose and did nothing to hide his shut eyes. Between himself and Tony were his elevated feet and he was heavily leaning his woollen body on the back two legs of his chair. His head was lolled to the side and the tangle of days-old braids in his beard glistened under the artificial light as drool escaped his slack mouth.
Steve paused a moment, wanting to hit his past-self over the head for the second time that day. Because, well...
“Alright,” was Steve’s immediate reply and, just like that, warm hands began to explore the unclothed cooling skin above Tony’s knees. He stroked the flat of his palms over the lengths of Tony’s thighs, sparking heat between them like a match along a striking paper.
"Please," Tony moaned and the word was almost meaningless. He pleaded for nothing in particular, he just wanted Steve. Forever, always.
she said simply and opened up the window with plenty of time for Thor to twirl himself out into the city air and towards the waterfowl commotion.
Arctic blue held him
And then everything stopped. And Steve pulled away.
He felt Steve rearrange him, kicking his legs out wider and tugging one of his arms so it could rest at the base of his spine. Steve gripped his wrist there, holding him steady to use Tony’s body as leverage, and he carefully undulated his hips. The head of his cock teased out past the clenching ring of muscle before he pushed back in carefully, deliciously stretching Tony another half an inch- then he stopped again.
Steve moved away from the door, stepping further into the room while maintaining a respectful distance. Position engaged.
He felt Tony shudder as he kissed him again and allowed the other man to fuck his newly slickened fist for a few moments before taking his hand away completely.
“No,” Bruce said, voice strained with frustration as he glared at Tony across the kitchen table. “What I’m saying is, you can’t have
Steve broke the kiss, just enough to respond with a hushed
know where we’re at right now.”
There is the workshop, but anywhere past ten metres from it, everything goes dead. He can’t connect to the Internet, nothing but his local sensors and workshop machine. His phone doesn’t have any signal and doesn’t show a time either. By all accounts, his world is a sphere with a twenty-metre radius. Tony doesn’t need to be a genius to know that that shouldn’t be possible, but he’s learned that impossible is not a word you should use when faced with an infinity gem. If Tony had to guess, he’d say that the time gem has put Steve and Tony in a pocket of time parallel to the main timeline, and since time and space go hand in hand, the pocket of time somehow translated into a pocket of space as well. They’re stuck somewhere, between time and space, and Tony doesn’t know what will happen if they don’t break this time loop. Can it go on forever? Will the gem lose infinity energy or whatever powers it?
Just the ice.
Jarvis did the equivalent of arching his brows at Stark, which Stark ignored with a huff.
“If I said I had decided to experiment more with the tattoo, would you believe—”
Tony nodded, thankful for the lie. Cap seemed like he wanted to believe him, but Iron Man wasn’t convinced. He started muttering about intruders again, and Cap shot him a chiding look.
Steve agreed, thinking furiously.
“Don’t mention it! Besides, a captain needs a weapon. Or well, shield.”
Stark came over to look and Steve handed him the paper with the first verse of the mysterious spell. Stark frowned, read the spell again, then looked at Steve.
“Iron Man, you’re famous for giving people the benefit of the doubt. Why are you so suspicious now? We should try to find ways to help Mr. Stark get his memories back.”
He can’t remember if he ever specified how he wants to be dealt with when he dies. He must have updated his will after getting Extremis. He’s never wanted a religious ceremony, but he might have asked to be buried with his parents. That can’t happen anymore, naturally. He needs to be cremated, or sealed away, so that no one can touch his body.
O’Casta really was the perfect contender for Tony’s heart.  She was striking, tall, and smart, and she knew a lot about magic. In short, she would fit perfectly with Tony. She really was the opposite of Steve, short, ugly Steve.
”Tony! Will you stop running for a minute!”
Tony thought.
Oh. Tony knew the dog wasn’t really a dog, and that it was the Witch that had cursed him. Which almost certainly meant that the man wasn’t working for her, or at least not willingly. Steve wished he could talk to Natasha and ask her about him. She had to know exactly who he was, especially since she was literally training to hone her intelligence skills. She would have the answers, Steve knew.
“You have full control on your body with Extremis, right?”
The ice exploded around him, and Steve was on his back, his body shivering uncontrollably, gasping for air.
rhetorical question!”
That didn’t really sound like the words of someone who was just looking for a roll in the hay. But when had Tony seen him before? Steve didn’t remember meeting him, and certainly not at an important part of his life.
He hoped she would like him.
Time to see what this is all about.
Tony’s in his workshop and he remembers.
“What do you mean?”
He hated it.
The marks were definitely growing. Would they grow indefinitely? Would they cover Tony’s whole body? What would happen then?
There’s nothing to say. This is Tony’s surrender.
Natasha was in love with someone? Who was it? Could Steve see them?
No, he was Iron Byronsides. But he liked the ring of “Iron Man” for the armour. It was better than calling it a tin can, at least. And transistors? He’d never heard of that. He wondered why they were so much more technologically advanced. What did they have that he was lacking?
He looked so earnest that Tony was tempted to tell him everything, but he decided to keep his cards close to his chest and learn a bit more about the situation first. Gain information, never give it, as Fury would say.
“This is loop number thirteen. I came to confront you about your betrayal and in the ensuing fight, you died. Then the time gem materialised in my hand, shattered, and I was in front of the workshop door again, but with one less teammate.”
Steve took a bowl of water and a piece of raw bacon and placed them next to the weredog. God, they hadn’t fed him at all, had they? Steve was doing everything wrong.
In the middle of the kitchen lay Tony, immobile, the marks still very much there. He was still breathing, but each exhale was a rattling whisper.
He staggered over to the couch, letting himself fall down on it.
He wants to vomit at the thought. Has it devolved to this, is Steve ready to kill Tony for what he’s done? Has he made himself judge, jury and executioner in the matter?
He smiled the fakest smile he’d ever smiled. He wasn’t even trying to be polite, he just wanted her gone. She’d been acting weird when they had come to her house, refusing to give Tony the piece of paper with the spell, and now she was being oddly insistent about staying in the castle. He didn’t trust her.
“You won’t be able to save him.”
he thought,
He could laugh—or more likely, cry—more after this was dealt with.
They dance around each other, and still it’s evident that this phase, too, won’t last. One day one of them will trip into the other’s space and they will take this one step further. Tony has smelled Steve, has had his sweat on his tongue, and he longs for more.
“We can sell flowers, too, they’ll smell good and it’ll freshen up the shop.”
Two out of four conditions had been met, and Tony was one step closer to death.
“I mean. You’re obviously great at painting, look at the shield, and I’ve seen some of your drawings lying around, so maybe you could sell some of your artworks next to the supplies, and I could, I don’t know, sell cheap charms on the side, have a little business running?”
do something. And if that means that I sell my soul in the process, then so be it.”
with him?
Could she be the one responsible for the disappearances?
Gretl.
She looked around her, then back to Steve, and seemed to realise he was ready to force her out of the door if necessary. She walked away, asking Steve to notify Tony as soon as he came back; that she’d been looking for him. After she closed the door behind her, Steve breathed out and rushed to Jarvis.
The rock was—moving, for lack of a better word. There was inhuman shrieking emanating from inside of it, or was it beside it? What was happening?
Tony gathered his tunic to his chest, pressing slightly, as if he could push the marks away. He was looking at the floor, blinking silently. Jarvis was blue, a washed-out colour that could only mean he was grieving. Steve felt his own eyes prickles. Why did it have to happen? The conditions were supposed to be impossible to meet, yet they were being fulfilled one after the other. Was there even any point in trying to stop the curse? With the rate of success they had, it wouldn’t be a week before the curse was complete, before Tony would be an “honest mind”.
A highly fascinating conversation followed, where Stark avoided telling anything of political importance to Tony, but hinted at many technological advancements. Tony had a list of people he should look up, and new hopes for his heart. If the answer really was the pacemaker, Tony would be able to live without the constant fear of his heart giving out. He was also certain that the transistor technology held the secrets to making his own Iron Man armour. And what an armour it was! Tony couldn’t stop marveling at the smoothness of the movements. He laughed in excitement when Stark demonstrated its flying abilities. Cap was in the background, smiling happily at them both, content to listen to them talk, occasionally shooting thoughtful glances at Stark.
Tony was hunched over one of his armours, humming to himself as blue and white sparks flew everywhere. He had his back to Steve, and Steve stopped in the doorframe, looking at him. He had taken off his shirt, obviously to avoid getting it dirty, since he hadn’t been wearing workshop proof clothes when he’d fled down there. Steve could appreciate the bunching and stretching of the muscles on his back, his skin glistening with sweat.
something.
Which made things simultaneously harder and easier since Steve wouldn’t have to look for some trinket or body part—thank God—but would have to know what to look for before finding it. Would Jarvis tell him if he asked him about it?
“You are gifted with magic too, Mr. Rogers. You can give life to your drawings, your aspirations and beliefs can become reality. You can and will find out what the contract is about, and you will help yourself in the process. Rescue will come, but not in the form you expect. I can’t tell you more. Good luck.”
A small, rational part of his mind pointed out that she could be lying, that it could be a trap.
“Promise me to never catch a star, okay? I’m serious about this, really. You have to promise me to never, ever catch a star. You don’t know what could happen to you, you have too little magical knowledge, it would end very badly for everyone involved. Trust me, the consequences are not something you want to be dealing with.”
“Well it seems the rumors about you were right. You’re nothing but an egotistical narcissist.”
“Aye,” answered Thor. “Stark is with us now. His people are ours.”
The Captain eyes him warily. “What are you suggesting?”
he growled.
Steve sucked in a breath as the victim’s image popped up. She was so young; he hadn’t realized how young. Another innocent life taken. After spending years in the Middle East, Steve should have been used to death. He wasn’t blind to it; he would be an idiot if he didn’t understand the cost of war. But he still found himself struggling. When he was deployed, it was easy for him to envision home as a utopia, a haven away from the blood and the screams. But coming back to America to realize that horror and death still lurked even their streets, it was enough to break the illusion.
“I know that sounds all too well,” Bucky replied, looking right at Steve. “It was a bomb.”
Barton shrugged. “None of us did, besides Bucky. You didn’t trust us, we didn’t trust you. Our life has taught us nothing but to see the worst in people.”
Steve clenched his jaw.
“Take it easy, Steve.” Air punch.
“What the hell is Extremis?”
fun. Glad I can check it off my bucket list.”
She placed a packet in his hands. It looked almost innocent, small even. Hill was right; if Project Insight was a complete success, Steve would be reading a book rather than a small pamphlet. He did save a lot of people. But there were still victims typed onto the pages. There were still people that didn’t come home.
“Sounds fair.”
“Don’t say that, don’t defend me, you don’t even know what I
In his little rooftop canopy, Steve hid a shoebox under a worn tarp. In the shoebox were his most prized possessions: a handful of toy soldiers. Not so much as soldiers, per say, as regular people. A few men in suits. A police officer, a fireman. There was a pilot, a few vacationers, some with clothes that were mismatched. There were even some that were clad in bright colors, like the superheroes from the comic books.
“No, not really. Whatever you’re selling, Boy Scout, I’m not buying.”
Loki looked up, trying to flee, but another body closed around him. Barnes?
A burst of warmth hit him as he sidled into the backseat, slamming the door behind him. Ignoring the other occupants, Obadiah tapped a quick rap against the divider and his chauffeur took off, navigating easily through the New York streets.
“He isn’t,” Coulson negated. “He believes me. And wants to help take him down.”
So when The Captain decided to attack Tony in the middle of a rescheduled business lunch, he was about ready to shit his pants. None of it had been scripted; for a little while, Tony had been entirely convinced The Captain was actually going to kill him.
Tony nodded. “I’m still gonna go.”
“Wake up, kid! This isn’t about just your life! It’s about
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” hissed Barton.
The man doubled over when Romanoff pressed a finger against his shoulder wound. “I asked you a question. I expect an answer.”
“I even would have done those mission reports I’ve been putting off,” came another complaint.
, Steve thought. Tony was stronger than Steve could ever imagine, but there was no way he could keep this up. No way that he should have to. Not on Steve's watch. He needed to do something.
Tony had already filled The Captain in on the extra rumors he had heard as soon as he got there. Tony had explained to the man about how terrified he was, as well as conveyed in every way possible that he wasn’t actually HYDRA. The Captain, the asshole, just laughed at him.
Matthew Drumm tapped a broken melody on the side of the van he was leaning against. He had been waiting hours for Hammer’s field men to come back from the job, hopefully with The Captain and Stark in tow.
“No, Buck,” Steve moaned. “You can’t do this to yourself; I won’t let you.”
“No, I’m pretty sure I’m right.”
“Sir?”
Oops.
He slammed down on the gas pedal, leaving the men behind.
Tony’s demeanor changed. He made a complete turn from a deer in headlights to stony anger. With a thrust of his hand, Tony shot the repulsor at Steve, sending him crashing back into the shed.
“Right, that’s what Phil said," Tony confirmed. "How’s that help?”
Nothing.
“Leave,” Tony snapped, tightening his hold on the repulsor.
“Captain,” Tony pleaded. “Listen to me; it needed to be done.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But there was nothing. No arm, no fingers.
“Do you have any idea what I thought when I found you gone?" Steve asked. "Jesus, Tony, I was out of my damn mind.”
Pepper nodded slowly, still gaze still stuck on the glowing orb in her hands. She walked over to the closest lab table and deposited it gently, as if damaging the unit would still hurt Tony. When she walked back over to Tony, he tried to give her an encouraging smile. “You’re doing great already,” he said. “Now, I just need you to grab this,” he continued, pulling her hand to his chest cavity.
Steve laughed again. “We’ll tell you on the way,” he answered, pulling Clint back towards his house. “But let’s get you inside. I want to put some ice on that cheek.”
“Give me another chance, I can bring him in!”
“Steve?” Bucky asked.
“I’m sorry to say that you just haven’t seen it yet.” Steve paused. “Would you like to?”
Steve smiled at the color that had started to return to Tony’s skin, a beautiful olive with a slight flush around his cheeks. He ran his hand softly through Tony’s tangled locks before finally retreating out of the room.
He heard the call disconnect, but he didn’t pull the phone away. For the first time in a long time, he wished he was still that snot-nosed kid, looking down at the people in the street, always at a distance, always
“I don’t deal with those mobs, Obie, I just
“And drinking the hard stuff again, I see.” Natasha pointed down to his cup. It was a glass tumbler. It wasn’t Tony’s fault he couldn’t find a coffee mug.
“Pretty sure that’s not how probability works.”
He could hear a soft sigh emanate from the other side of the register, the tenor laced with irritation. Steve clenched his jaw, but otherwise ignored the cashier, opting to insert his plastic card into the reader for a third time.
Clint couldn’t help but give a watery smile. “Now come on, you can grovel to me later. We need to get to base.”
“Stark, wait! Tony!” Steve’s pleas were cut off as Stark slammed the door behind him.
Steve waited hard and long for a snarky response, a bright chuckle, anything. But it never came.
Steve broke off when strong arms swooped him into a huge hug. “There it is,” he heard Bucky whisper, but Steve could barely hear it over his gasps and shudders.
“Steve, please. You’re the same person. I know you have the same memories. That means you know me. You know I couldn’t do this, I couldn’t be this person you’re looking for.”
That Steve Rogers died in the fire alongside his friends.
He could see Barton keep peering over his shoulder, eyes wide, just waiting for the rest of the Avengers to catch up with him. Finally, he glared back at Delmar.
"I'm sorry, Sir, but I cannot match The Captain to any known male in New York. I have even taken the liberty to extend the search to neighboring states, as well as adding in your additional parameters. The Captain simply does not exist."
The next time that your boss comes anywhere near my people,
After the ‘events’ of Afghanistan, Tony had gotten in contact with Nick Fury. He had always talked about the Avenger Initiative, but Tony never thought that it would ever solidify. Now he was housing the entire team.
The change of tone finally had Steve looking up at his husband, his hand still working furiously on the meat. “Wait, what?”
Barton changed lanes and made another right turn. “Anything else I need to know about?”
“Cutting it kind of close, don’t you think?”
“Oh, you’re up,” Clint fumbled, before his head finally caught up with seeing Steve active. “Wait, you’re up!”
Steve loved it. The lab was so unbelievably Tony. It stuck out like such a sore thumb compared to the rest of the building, but Steve couldn’t imagine the speakeasy without it. It was just like Tony, standing tall next to The Commandos.
Tony felt Steve’s arms tighten around him, frozen in place as blue light finally started to dance around in Steve’s eyes. “Oh my God,” the blonde moaned, fear etched clearly on his face.
“I’m sure it will be just fine, Tony.” Although if it was anything like the rest of the tower, Steve was sure he wouldn’t agree with it. But Steve couldn’t complain. Not with Tony being so generous. Steve would just have to get used to it; just like everything else.
“Well, I don’t take orders from anyone. So why don’t you put the gun down and tell me what you want?”
Clint cursed again, desperately searching for his phone. Phil must think that he was in there. Clint got more frantic, searching every pocket he could.
“I guess,” Natasha shrugged. “It just doesn’t make any sense. Why even bother with false information? It’s not like we had any inkling of what direction to head in before.”
She pointed at a pile of tables that had been tossed around. And hidden behind the fronts was –
When they reached what seemed to be a pause in the mayhem, Rhodes look at the trail of bodies they left behind him. “What?” Steve asked.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony murmured, bending down to place a few kisses on Steve’s head before crouching down, bundling the larger man in his arms.
Tony pulled up alongside him. “
“That brings us to the second question of the hour,” interjected Sam. “Who’s they? We don’t think they’re HYDRA, so who could it be?”
to be in control. How much longer before they strike? How much longer until he wouldn’t be staring at a hospital bed, but a grave?
, his face still crinkled in pain. Tony cursed, looking back to the huge pile of rubble that lay on Barnes. The only way for him to get Barnes out of there was to remove the debris. Which, for Tony, was asking him to lift a train car. Tony’s eyes flashed around the room, looking for anything to use as a fulcrum. They were running out of time. It wouldn’t be long before both he and Barnes were crushed by the collapsing building.
It wasn’t much later that Steve found himself with fresh clothes and a hot meal in his stomach. Tony was staring at him from across the table.
“Don’t count on that happening any time soon.”
“When you snatch an engineer from the street, make sure you can always see their hands.”
“Why is this important?” Tony asked. “With the number of files that the SSR collected over the years, it would make sense that Pierce would put them on an electronic platform. He could keep them on his person at all times, and it would be way easier to sort and organize all of the information he collected.”
“What the hell were you thinking?!”
Bucky followed Steve’s eyeline, looking at the tall windows in front of them, mostly shot out from the onslaught of bullets. “You serious?”
“What are you doing here?” Tony asked.
Progress Check!
And when he woke,
“Well, following the traffic laws comes at a price, unfortunately.”
Fury paused for a moment, deep in thought. “You can consider this pro bono, as well,” he finally responded. “Pierce has made this find as public as possible. The bust of the century, they’re already calling it. He’s already gotten in contact with the governor. He’s going to present it to him in a ceremony with full press, tomorrow morning. He’s probably hoping for a large promotion, most likely my job. And if what you said is true, handing that information over will mean bad things for the people named on that list.”
“Explain, then.”
“No. They’re just people. Just regular, ordinary people.”
That was until he heard the sound of quiet breathing coming from the living room. Tucking into a defensive position, Steve reared, ready to attack when-
“If Stark could manage this in the sewer, it won’t take him long to perfect his design. We just don’t know how he powered it.”
“Uh, yea, Clint. I don’t know if you remember that you’ve been gone for a month,” Steve snapped.
“Yes,” Tony grit out. “And would you believe this was our first choice?”
As soon as Tony was gone, Bucky grabbed at Steve’s wrist. He could feel the metal joints pinch his skin as the grip tightened. “Steve,” he said.
Steve couldn’t help it this time, deep belly laughs emanating from his chest, Tony joining in with him. They laid there for hours, Tony talking,
The other man looked away. “This is everyone,” he whispered.
(Please comment; it makes me happy.)
“That’s right, boys. I got him. I fucking caught Rogers,” Rumlow said with a smirk.
“What are you talking about?”
Pierce clenched his hands into fists. “Just say what you need to say and get out before I kill you.”
“Of course I know where he is,” she scoffed. “I sure as hell am not telling you.”
Tony sighed, obviously frustrated. Steve had heard it many a time before while he was on the phone with the board or in front of some quack interviewer, the meaning ranging from ‘
“With this,” Tony replied, chuckling a phone at him. “Fully functioning Commando hotline. Now, you and the gang can start talking shit behind our backs again.”
save?”
“Good,” Tony answered, seemingly satisfied.
Tony smiled. “There’s that dry wit. I was afraid you’d left it at the bottom of the river.”
Bucky shook his friend, the blonde remaining unresponsive as he became more frantic. “Come on, don’t do this,” he whispered, leaning down to check that he was still breathing. He flopped his head onto Steve’s chest after feeling the faint puff of Steve’s breath against his ear. He could feel the warm rivulets smear against his cheek, a sharp contrast to the cold of the river water.
“You literally got in an argument with an artist and learned to blow glass just to piss him off!” grinned Steve. “You are such a determined, stubborn ass, but you’re
There wasn’t a lot of interaction with the listeners, but Steve hadn’t expected there to be. He always struggled with the sharing part of therapy, being put on the spot in front of Coulson, the man seemingly ready to pick each thing he said apart. One of the main reasons for this additional podcast was to offer a therapy feel for other veterans, but without forcing them to delve into their personal horrors, giving them a chance to learn and heal through hearing others’ stories.
The blonde smiled. “Listen to Bucky, huh?”
Steve was up in a flash, grabbing at Tony, pulling the giggling man back into his arms. “I don’t think so,” he negated, tightening his hold.
Steve grabbed at Tony’s shoulders as the man tried to push past his again. “You can’t come; you aren’t combat trained. Remember the last time you went out? Hammer’s men shot you.”
Steve barely had time to work on wearing down the zip ties before the door on the left burst open, a stern looking man walked in.
Walking down to the front door, Steve could already hear the harsh thuds of Bucky’s fists hitting the punching bag. He sighed, finally walking outside to one of their vans, sliding in the passenger side. Clint was driving, but thankfully the man had enough sense than to ask him about what went down.
3. Joseph Chavez- Gluttony
Natasha was always angry. Gone were her chiding remarks and soft hums. All that was left now was a mother that was too fed up in dealing with her children. Sam wasn’t doing much better. He filtered through the rooms of the speakeasy, trying to help everyone. Of course, when no one wanted it, Sam’s become nothing but constantly drained. Steve hadn’t seen Bruce or Thor in weeks. Bruce had ditched in the midst of another screaming match, the doctor always avoiding conflicts that brought up undesirable childhood memories. As for Thor, Steve wasn’t sure he’d ever come back. It wasn’t hard for any of them to put the pieces together on who was responsible for Coulson. One look at Clint’s face and Thor was out the door, guilt hanging over him like a cloud.
He always said he was more of a delivery boy, both him and Bucky running rampant through the streets of New York to find their next package, bringing them back for usually Nat to take them apart. While Clint had always joked about being the errand boy, Steve knew he wouldn’t have it any other way. Steve could always catch a glimpse of it; the uneasiness that sat in his stormy eyes whenever he walked in during one of their sessions. That, and once while in a drunken stupor, Clint had admitted that he didn’t like the noises. The dull thuds of flesh hitting flesh, the chair scrapping, the pleading moans. He said it reminded him too much of his time in the circus. That was all Steve needed to know to try and keep the man as far away from interrogations as possible.
Steve didn’t waste any time delving his tongue into Tony’s, relearning the engineer’s sweet taste. He caressed Tony’s face as he leaned in for more.
he thought to himself.
“Great,” Tony pouted. “Just great. You’re all friends now. Why do I feel like this is a bad thing?”
