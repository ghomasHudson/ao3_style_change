"I... I can explain," Peter began, before being cut off by the older man.
"Good..."
Steve pushed the boy gamingly, sitting down in the cramped space he had made on the sofa. "Me and Bucky gotta go fight some bad guys, Pete... You gonna be okay home alone till we're back?"
"Oh, we're not going to kill..." he pressed the gun against Peter's chest, "you. We're just going to kill Peter Stark-Rogers."
"Tony, we-"
She placed her hand over her heart and exclaimed, “I didn’t write it... though,  I do wish I was able to take credit for that.” She again suppressed her laughter at Sam’s facial expressions. She pressed a small, silver button and pointed up at the screen; the audio of it was now turned on.
"I'm a philanthropist, Rogers. I freakin' look out for people's welfare. Why would I put my own son in danger?"
"Objection, your honour!" Tony said loudly, outraged by his former partner's accusations.
Peter let go a sigh of relief, when he was thrown into a small room. Sure, it wasn't much - just a two by two cell, with unnaturally white walls and lights that burnt his eyes, but it was better than his previous accommodations.
"I think we should wake up Peter," Bucky suggested.
Tony chuckled, "Why's he killing me and not you?"
"Wanda?" Steve asked, his eyes widening in panic. "What about Wanda?" The girl was too young to get mixed up in all this. She was practically a child compared to the rest of the team.
They were so busy throwing insults at each other that both of them forgot to turn left.
"Crystal clear."
"Have wanted to do that for a long time, Tony?" she suggested, her eyes wide in a mixture of both shock and admiration. She leant against the wall, throwing a quick look at Peter before turning her gaze back to the ground.
"Good."
Peter looked down at his trembling hands, hurrying to hide them behind his back. "Fine. Maybe I do do that when I lie."
"Well, Pete," Steve began, whilst twiddling his thumbs, "There's a bit of news I have to share with you..."
No, that couldn't be true. He's my baby
"Of course I will, Stevie. He's your son, how could I not like him?"
The number was unknown but it was obvious who they were on about. Peggy. It broke his heart to say he saw it coming, after all he was a man out of time- all of his friends, other than Bucky, had grown old without him. Most had died. Her time had ran out, however morbid it sounded.
Now dressed  and even more tired, Peter lay down on the bed: unable to sleep because of the harsh light glaring down at him. They - Hydra - were doing this for one of two reasons... a) they wanted him to suffer, or b) they were trying to make him sleep only when they wanted him to. As if on cue, the light switched off - submerging him in the
Tony added more to his list, the paper now consisting of:
"You're going to read this, актив/asset, you're going to read this and then repeat back to me everything it says."
"You okay, Stevie?" he whispered, willing to wrap his arms around the shaking soldier - the only thing stopping him being the formality of the event.
"If he wants to be an Iron Man Junior, why shouldn't he be. After all, he's only helping people."
Bucky shook his head. "I killed him, and his wife - Maria, I think. They were my mission. I never fail a mission..." he exclaimed, turning to face away from his boyfriend. He couldn't bring himself to look at the blond. He would feel too guilty. Too ashamed.
"When does he usually sleep until?" Bucky asked curiously, keeping his voice down as Steve's footsteps padded over the carpet. "He's a teenager, don't teenagers usually sleep in?"
Peter glared at the man, his fists clenching as much as they could with the handcuffs on them. "Where am I, who are you?" he muttered, his breathing becoming shaky.
Steve thought back to a conversation he and Bucky had had prior to everything. And by everything, he meant the incident of his son being kidnapped.
The blond and the teen looked over at Tony who was muttering, "Oscorp, Oscorp! Why would anyone in their right minds want to go to Oscorp?" under his breath.
He couldn't bring himself to say anything else. It was too hard. The knot inside his stomach had grown tighter, tugging at him painfully. Had he felt feelings for Peggy, back then? Maybe... but it was only because feeling them for Bucky would have meant execution.
"The fact Captain America and Iron Man are going on a mission together," he replied nonchalantly. "It's hilarious, you should check it out."
clickingkey-boards helped write the Steve and Tony scene so I could get this up in time.
Steve could hear voices. They were speaking in German. He wasn't sure what they were saying but knowing his luck it was unlikely to be good. Suddenly, the sound of the door being battered echoed through the room. They were trying to get in. They were trying to get to Bucky. He had to do something.
Peter jumped up from the couch, webbing the remaining bags of food towards him and his Dad. "I'm starving!"
"She's not a US citizen, Steve..."
As always let's thank the wonderful clickingkey-boards for helping.
"What powers? You didn't repeat the Winter Soldier experiment. Did you?"
"Alright everyone, off the bus," called out their teacher: Mr Harrington.
"Wait... You lo-ve me?" he stammered, after comprehending the words Bucky had just said.
"Yes, Steve. Me saying 'shush Peter,' does imply that, doesn't it?"
Peter shrugged. It was perfectly plausible. Especially when you lived in a building, which is home to: an enhanced super soldier, a man with an arc reactor in place of his heart, a physical AI, a girl with awesome - and kind of weird - powers, a man who thinks he's a hawk, a man who thinks he's a falcon, a man who can grow real big - and real small, and an incredible assassin.
"I thought you said you homeschooled him, Tony?" Steve asked, still glancing at the empty space Peter had disappeared from.
The boy buried his face in a pillow, trying to block out the outside world. His senses were dialled to eleven - giving him a super headache. "Nothing," he muffled through the cushion.
"There was so much personality in that sentence, I'm astounded," Tony replied sarcastically. "You should go on TV."
"Technicalities, technicalities," Tony dismissed. "I'll do you one better: now I'm picturing you trying to take down Loki by hitting him in the face with your shield."
"What? No. The Avengers. They're the ones that  injured me so much I was better off without the thoughts," the boy countered.
"Mister Wilson, if you would please listen for a minute... For the past 4 years, you operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. The Sokovia Accords. Approved by one hundred and seventeen countries. It states, that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations Panel, only when and if that Panel deems it necessary."
"I know, I know. It's just a nice thing - like Aunt Tasha said -  to celebrate it for him."
Raising his eyebrows, Peter smirked, "What do you mean?" He was blushing, now too, but he didn't realise - instead he continued to look to his Dad for answers.
Steve tilted his head to look up at Ross, the ocean in his eyes swirling as if a storm was about to brew. He made eye contact with the General, doing his upmost best not to stand up and let him have it. Yet, before he could reply to the question Ross added, "If I misplaced a couple of thirty megaton nukes, you can be sure there'd be consequences."
"You knew. Didn't you, Stark?"
"Warmer than jail," replied Tony.
"About to find out..."
MJ raised her eyebrows, watching as Peter Uber his hand against the back of his neck. "You hurt?"
Stunned, the kid replied with, "Uh, sure." He has also seen how badly Peter was acting. He was a good friend and knew when to leave.
The young teen did as he was told, forcing himself up off of the ground. He was slightly grateful to see something, or someone, other than the white walls that made up the room, but he knew that his gratitude wouldn't last for long. His knees were shaking, causing the rest of his body to tremble alongside them. His face was pale, and he was certain that everything that had happened yesterday would be a walk in the park compared to whatever would happen today.
"Of course, Sir."
"So I was thinking, Pete, how'd you like to do some stuff that's more your level?"
"Six m-" Peter whispered, "That's a long time." He grinned, his voice getting louder, "For a second there, I thought it had been a few years. I mean, Dad, your hair really is going grey."
"You alright, kid?" Tony asked. He held his right hand down to his son, pulling him up of the ground. "Nice PJs by the way," he added, after noticing the Iron Man pyjamas Peter was sporting.
Natasha then said something she never thought she would be saying. "Maybe Tony's right..." Tony must have found it surprising too as he was fast to turn his head in her direction. "If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off-"
"Kay..."
“You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry... We only have to talk about one.”
Smirking, Peter said, "Sure! Thought you'd never ask. I'm heading out now, should I meet you by the Tower?"
"Spider-Man!"
The sound of siren blaring suddenly flooded the room. Something bad was happening. Something awful. The boy wasn't too sure what it was - but alarms were bad. Fire alarms, school alarms, all alarms... none of them led to good.
This triggered something in Peter's subconscious mind as he quickly muttered back the snarky reply of, "Don't need to go... already smarter."
Taking a deep breath, Tony stepped out of the suit. It was always strange to be out of suit while Steve was in his, it felt as if he was becoming an entirely different person. "When we were in the theme park?"
"We'll have to run some tests on you, kiddo. See what the bite's done to you, treat it before your Pops finds out," Tony informed his son.
Tony paused and took a deep breath, "Say you did get bitten, what would happen?"
His phone buzzed again. It was a text. From the same number as before.
"Hey, Dad, is that you?"
Tony sighed. "Bad news and however you decide to take it news. What would you like first?"
Tony scowled at him. "Glad my son's kidnapping amuses you, Rogers."
The other man was only a few cars behind, leaping at the same pace as the sergeant. He then leapt onto the car Steve was driving. The Captain swerved from side to side,  trying to throw him off but it was useless.
"Anything else?" Tony cut in.
* * *
"Okay..." began Steve, realising Peter didn't want to talk about it; then as he noticed his son's choice of clothing, he said in mock anger, "Anthony Stark, what have you done?"
There was silence. The two usually loudest people in the Tower had fallen quiet, the only sounds in the room being their heavy and hasty breathing.
The Captain sighed, "Yeah... He's all that, and more. He's intelligent, might be only fourteen but he's probably ready to graduate college."
Another man was heading towards them, and to stop him, Bucky shoved Steve into him, causing the German to fall over in pain. More bullets came and Bucky used his metal hand to repel them, throwing another man into the shelves that lined one of the walls. Then, before anything else could happen, Bucky ran to the stairway, jumping a level without injuring himself. He had to get away.
"Stand up."
"Now you're making it sound bad, Dad."
"Steve, wait up," he called after the tall blond.
Tony smirked, "It's a good thing that I made a few improvements to this car..."
"So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?" Sam asked, ready to fight the man in front of him. Tony rolled his eyes, glad he couldn't actually see what was happening. He was sat on the sofa facing the over way; his head was in his hands.
* * *
Steve laughed, "Jeez, relax, James, it's a nickname."
"Peter..."
* * *
The four clambered out of their seats, grabbing their bags, and joined the rest of the class outside of Oscorp.
Then he felt it. A sudden burn on the back of his neck. It left as soon as it came, but he now had a faint headache. "Ouch," he muttered, under his breath.
"Lovin' the jammies, kid." Sam pointed at the Iron Man pyjamas the teen was wearing and smirked. "Think I could pull them off?"
Peter raised his hand, in the same manor a student would do to gain the teacher's attention. "Is Pepper gonna be here soon? You said she'd pick me up so I wasn't stuck here the entire time..."
* * *
"Who said Iron Man can't meet... Spider-Man? There's no rules restricting him."
* * *
Steve shrugged, "Not sure, I just know that he isn't happy."
"Kid..." Tony said gently.
Oh right... Peter thought to himself. Ned didn't know about anything that had happened. He just thought that Peter was away: travelling. To him there was no coma, no fighting, no torture, no Hydra. No Spider-Man. And, that was the it had to stay. Peter wouldn't be able to live with himself if something happened to Ned because of him.
"Tony?" Steve asked, his voice cold. "Why are you phoning me?"
A shadow appeared outside of the apartment window, the shape of a man appearing against the brick wall. The dark figure was grasping a book - one that was the colour of blood - with a black star etched across the front of it.
The older man sighed, bringing his right hand to his chin so he could lean on it mid-thought. "I don't want you to-"
Peter begrudgingly followed his Dad into the Tower. Every single sound, every little whisper, was amplified in his head. He could hear - and at the same time not hear - the words his Dad was saying to him. It was like being in a room and watching as people spoke, hearing the words, but not understanding any of it.
The man gently pushed the boy towards the bed, "Stay in here, актив/asset, you'll be safe." Then he headed out of the room - locking the door behind him.
"He what?"
"Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive," Steve informed Bucky.
"Oh my gosh, we were panicking so much," Steve chuckled. "Then Pete comes back with ice cream on his face and a new toy in his hand."
He was currently in Cleveland, in his car outside of Vasily Karpov's home. It was a small place, rather ran down. The blinds were slightly torn at the edges, bitten by moths and goodness knows that else. The outside walls were adorned in graffiti, and the front of the house's pavement seemed to be the single place on the block where weeds decided to gather. Altogether it was a disgusting place.
"D-dad... m-morning," slurred the young boy, his eyes blinking rapidly. "What time is it?" he added, after he felt slightly more awake. His brown curls were sticking out all over the place, and his Star Wars: The Clone Wars pyjama shirt was drenched in sweat.
He tried to put the thought behind him as they continued into the compound, but he couldn't. It was still there - a drifting feeling at the back of his mind.
Multiple police cars were following after them, the chase getting bigger and more intense. Steve continues to swerve, trying to ignore his conscience. He hit another car but decided to keep on going. He was already in deep, there was no point backing out now.
"Well... he's kinda like me back before the serum."
"It's okay, bud. I shouldn't of got mad at you," Tony admitted softly, "And I probably should have told you about..."
Karpov seemed appalled by that idea. It was a rule all members of secret organisations followed: never get associated with law enforcement. It will never end well for anyone. Karpov shook his head, "No. No cops."
"I'm okay... I think I'm gonna sleep with all my old toys - in my room, if that's okay with you... but apart from that I'm fine."
"I don't mean to make things difficult."
"I think it's a good idea."
"Hey, kiddo," Tony replied, his voice warped slightly by the noise of his suit, "You up for a bit of patrolling?"
"I was bitten by a spider... a radioactive spider."
So the pair headed down the the hallway, running straight into Zemo himself. "Mr Stark, Mr Rogers... How wonderful it is to find you down in the hallways of my home. We've been expecting you. Obviously, you took a little longer than we might have hoped. We had to resort to some... creative uses for your son."
"Oh shit!" Tony piped, when the alarm began to tone. "And this is why you don't ask for a shield. Who thought it would be a good idea for you to have a shield?"
* * *
The boy knew it was there, but he couldn't physically feel it. It was an abstract feeling, One you couldn't quite describe if you tried. "I don't know what you're talking about. Everything you've said to me has been a lie. You're trying to turn me against them. It won't work, though. It won't."
He could still have picture her, not a day older than when he first got his shield. Her hair kept back in neat braids, whilst her uniform was completely spotless. The brown sparkle in her eyes was still there even to the last time he had visited her... but it had vanished now. Now it was only him, and Buck. They were alone in the world.
"It's Ned, Dad!" Peter corrected, even though he knew that was exactly the reaction his dad wanted.
MJ smiled, nodding her head, "Okay, sure thing."
Peter said nothing as he sat down in the back of Steve's car. He said nothing as they drove the thirty minute drive, and said nothing when Bucky lifted his case from the trunk. He said nothing whilst Steve showed him the room he would be forced to call his, and remained silent for the rest of the night: not even attending dinner, when he was asked.
Eventually, he forgot that people could be watching and picked up the bowl, drinking directly from it until he had drained it entirely. The water was lukewarm and quite disgusting, but Peter still drank all of it until the glass was empty, not even thinking about how he may have to save the food and make it last.
Peter began to open his mouth to make a quip - a trait of Tony's that had rubbed off on him, but shut it almost instantly. There was no point going through pain like that again... none at all. He felt the cold, metal hand grasp his pyjama tee's collar, and closed his eyes. He was shivering, shuddering and shaking: his teeth chattering as he held his breath, waiting for whatever would come next. "Move it," spat Bucky, kicking the back of Peter's shins.
"Yeah," Peter exclaimed, realising he could go do some Spider-Man stuff, "I'll be fine."
Peter shook his head, "Fine! Eres un idiota!"
"You should've woken me," Peter exclaimed, pretending to be annoyed at his father. Yet, the teen was partially relieved by his late awakening; he did feel a little better after a long night's rest. He began pushing his Doctor Who duvet off of himself, when he realised all of his plushies had began to fall with it onto the floor.
Nodding in agreement, Peter replied, "Sounds good. What's happening?"
"Good."
"Hell, yeah!" Peter exclaimed, before a solemn look overcame him. It was as if all the happiness in the word has been drained from him, only to be replaced by sadness.
* * *
Bucky raised his eyebrows, "What the hell does fondue mean? Please tell me there is a meaning and you weren't just trying to make it rhyme?"
Nothing bad happened that evening. In fact neither of the Starks had to step in at all. All crimes they spotted were mediocre, so Friday and Karen would automatically contact the cops.
"I still want an answer. Whether I do or do not like it," Steve insisted, taking a step towards the shorter man.
"Ah, okay... Me and Buck better be off, then. And don't worry about walking us out, I know the way."
"Dad was always the pain in the ass, you know. I'm following in his footsteps. But anyway, he and mom always managed to make it work," Tony stated. "Me and Pepper will be able to, too."
"Boy, you know me so well," Tony replied sarcastically. Of course Steve didn't want the team to know that they had already discussed it. He wanted it to seem like he was just good at reading people... which he was not, let's just clarify. He wanted to seem like the good guy in all this darkness.
* * *
Tony pulled away from Peter, when his phone started vibrating. "Just gonna take this call, why don't you test out the web shooters?"
"Which one's that?" Tony asked, more out of fatherly love than the desire to know which nerdy creation his son was building in his bedroom. He often bought the kid new sets but he didn't really check what they were, only to make sure Peter didn't already have it. Occasionally, when he wasn't too busy with Stark Industries or the Avengers Initiative, the genius would sit in Peter's room with him, helping him with his Lego. He was definitely putting his MIT education to good use. He chuckled, quietly.
"Yes, sir."
The teen was cut short by the gunshot. He had just been taken down by one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s preferred  weapons. An Icer... or as the creator of them - Leo Fitz - liked to call them: Night Night Guns. They don't kill, they just knock you out. A better weapon for those who want to do right in the world, or for those who want to kidnap the son of two Avengers.
"It hurts," the teenager whimpered, rubbing his hands against his head, "It's like a part of my brain has been torn out... Like a piece of the puzzle is missing."
Tony reassured himself, however his forehead was still wet from his sweat. He still didn't know what to say, and as the word started to form on the top of his tongue,
Nodding, Steve replied, "I'm afraid so. I don't agree with it. I think we should be able to save whoever needs saving, not whoever the UN deem worthy."
"And," the man continued, "I'm sure you've already met our most valued asset. He's been away from his home far too long."
"Soldier, would you care to remove Peter's restraints?" the man asked, directing the order at Bucky.
"Fine," whined the boy, whilst they got back to the patrolling.
"Spider-Man? You're barely a teen."
"I don't intend on going anywhere."
Peter nodded his head, leaving Ned off his case, however MJ seemed to see something was up.
The Winter Soldier.
"Yep..." The teenager hurried out of the room, glad to be free from the heat of the discussion between his parents.
"It was, Dad! It really was!"
His metabolism seemed to be finally taking his toll, as his insides felt as if his stomach was eating away at itself. There had to be food, he thought to himself, there just had to be. No place, no matter how horrid, had no food inside it. Fortunately, luck was on his side for seemingly the first time in hours, as his heightened senses picked up food that proved to be there. On a tray - a white tray, of course - was a glass of water and a bowl of soup.
Instead, Steve found it funny, chuckling behind his hand for several moments until he regained his composure. "Right, moment over... let's set off, shall we?"
Grinning, the hawk teased: "In Español!"
Clint ruffled Peter's hair, "You talk too much."
"The man, who I once called a loving husband, is no more than a drunk and an addict - one who has access to a weaponised suit, and multiple laboratories. He has had many careers, which I - and I presume the court will too - believe are unsuitable for a single father. He has been a weapons manufacturer-"
This made Tony angrier than he could possibly imagine - if he were Bruce, he was pretty sure he would of already turned into Hulk and destroyed the entire building. "I'm not putting him in danger, Rogers," he spat, standing up hastily. "I have never, and will never, do anything to harm my son."
"Yes," Peter spat, working up all of his courage to rebel. He couldn't let them win. He wouldn't... He was Spider-Man, he was a hero. "You won't kill me. I know that. You need me alive," he added bravely.
"No," protested Peter, his smile fading, "But not Bucky. He... He went bad, Dad, he let them hurt me."
Could he do that without crying? Could he do that without breaking down into an endless pit of despair, unable to escape? Peggy would do it for him. She probably had already done it, when the world thought him dead.
He felt a slight ticklish sensation up his neck. It was because of all the talk on spiders, he guessed. Oscorp weren't that awful at security measures to have one of their experiments just waltzing around the compound. Were they?
“Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would,” Sharon cut in. Then, she turned her attention to the screen showing Bucky and the evaluator.
Peter glanced at him and responded slightly shyly with, "Hi..." Steve had sat down on the couch, next to Bucky, but had made space on the right of him for Peter.
Peter stuck his arm out and looked the other way, wincing when his Dad pulled the needle out. "It's all done, kid, you can go to sleep now."
"Yeah?"
Sighing, Tony once again picked up his son: cradling him in his arms. "Kiddo... what am I going to do with you?"
"Seventeen, Benign, Nine, Homecoming-"
"Howard..."
"Da-Dad?" Peter asked sheepishly from beneath the mountain of blankets he was hiding under. He had been there since eight, when Tony had been pulled into the meeting earlier that day.
Bucky dropped the man and turned his attention to Steve, swift to push him down to the ground by his chest. He punched a hole into the floor with his metal arm. "I'm. Not. Gonna. Kill. Anyone!" He then pulled up a floorboard, grabbing the backpack that was hidden beneath it; he throws it out of the window. Bucky then gets behind Steve, using the man and his shield as a way to avoid getting hit by the oncoming storm of bullets.
"So I can be a better Shield agent than you."
Rhodey tapped his hand on the pile of documents that was in front of him. He didn't seem impressed. However, he looked substantially calmer than both Steve and Nat. "So... there are contingencies?"
* * *
* * *
The screen shone green, and Peter put the phone to his ear. "Hey, Dad, it's me... Peter."
"So me and you..." Bucky began.
"You and Bucky, and yes I know you two are a thing," he added after seeing Steve's expression, "Where are you two staying? After The Hub..."
Knock. Knock.
"It's just... it seems a bit like a rebound relationship," the blond shrugged. He was quick to add, "To me," after noticing that Tony was now sending him death glares.
"As long as you're not the one making them," teased Peter, regretting his sny comment almost instantly. Steve tugged the blanket off of the teen and started tickling the vulnerable child. "Pops! Stop! Please! Stop!" he protested, squirming away from the blond.
Tony looked up from his book, his conscience questioning whether or not he had imagined the faint voice. He glanced down at Peter, and smiled at the sight of his son's fluttering eyes. "Pete?" he said softly, his hand brushing across the boy's hair, "Bud... can you hear me?"
Tony dropped him on to the bed, "Pete, what's wrong?"
Tony threw his blazer to the floor. "That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realised what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stopped manufacturing."
Overly Enhanced Vision - Too Much Input?
"Tony!" Steve exclaimed, "You chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our rights to choose... What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go and they don't let us! We may not be perfect but the safest hands are still our own."
"Right," Steve replied, still somewhat uncertainly. For the next thirty minutes of the film, the blond remained silent whilst it played. However when r cut to a section on his own team: The Howling Commandos, he couldn't hold it in anymore.
Then, much to his surprise, the door - which he had assumed was there - creaked open, allowing a man, who was wearing a black suit, to walk in. "Ahh, Peter, so glad to see you're awake."
Steve didn't like the idea of an actual cell but the idea of being in a room with the order not to leave it still felt as much a prison as the real thing. His eyes wandered to T'Challa's, who was just about to speak.
"Hate you too, Capsicle!" Tony quipped. "Kinda wished Howard hadn't helped you illegally go storm that base." He glanced across at Steve's confused face, and added, "Oh yeah, you can bet he was real proud of the fact that he had done something important for America's glorious Captain. Never shut up about it."
Peter stepped into his window, pulling off his mask. His hair stuck upwards, his brown curls waving in the breeze. "Fine..."
Sitting at the kitchen table was the man himself, rather haphazardly streaking his pencils across a piece of paper. Rolling his eyes and snorting, Tony picked up a discarded rubber and threw it at Steve's face. "Oi, Rogers? I'm here to find out where your crazy boyfriend has kidnapped my - sorry, our - son to."
A few hours later, Steve received a call. He had been expecting it, waiting for it even. Ever since the modestly sized television in the corner of his and Bucky's bedroom lit up with a a news article about the Wakandan King T'Chaka's death, and how The Winter Soldier was supposedly behind it, he had been sat on his bed, clutching his phone.
"The spider bite contained DNA," Tony continued, "And it's bonded with your own."
"It's not on an Avengers pay role," Tony would say, before heading off into the distance: leaving the fourteen year old to catch up with him.
"You guys know I'm right here, right?" Peter cut in, slowly eating the breakfast that had been put before him.
"Say goodbye to your kneecaps, motherfucker," he replied with a deadly serious face.
"I'm just reading the terrain," she answered. "We have made some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back."
Peter's head snapped up to stare at Zemo, realising the question was directed at him as there was nobody else in the room. "I'm not your asset so don't call me that," he replied angrily, before letting his head hang towards the floor.
"Because-"
"What the hell?" he exclaimed, looking at the red and blue suit.
"Says he's retired." Natasha smiles. It was unlike her to let her guard down in such a public place but it was most likely she knew no one was going to interrupt them.
"I know that, Pete," he said, rolling his eyes. "Come on, what do you think of it? I slaved in the kitchen for two hours for this so I'm not letting you go with just agreeing with other people's comments!"
Bucky smirked, "Only one of those things are true, and let me tell you, Stevie, we all know you're an idiot."
The Dark Room wasn't just a room with an ominous adjective describing it... It was a room that made Peter's hairs stand on edge: and if it wasn't for the Soldier's firm grasp on him, he would have legged it by now. The room itself was dark, yet it wasn't empty, either. Instead of being a plain, old, dark abyss it just had to be filled with things that almost completely resembled torture devices. Actually, Peter was pretty sure they were torture devices.
"That is why he will not be with you, Captain. Why don't you let your son have some bonding time with his future stepdad?"
Tony didn't respond to the Captain. Instead, he stood up - Peter copying him, and they walked out of the restaurant before ordering anything. "Come on, Peter, we're going."
The genius' eyes flickered to the screens... the ones showing Bucky. He began to watch intensely at the scene that was taking place.
"Peter, it's not what you want... it's what's best for you."
"I didn't want you to be alone." The assassin pulled him into a hug, something they'd never done- at least never outside of missions. He could recall their kiss. Shake the thought, Steve, he screamed to himself. Shake the thought.
Dragging the teen to his feet, Zemo detached the chain that bound Peter to the table, and threw him against a wall. "Do you really want to test my patience, актив/asset?"
The unknown man leaped off the front of the vehicle and onto the motorbike. The soldier reacted quickly, flinging the intruder over his head and leant the bike down on its side. He kicked the assailant away, straightened himself up and rode on.
Steve spluttered indigrantly. "That little... ugh, I'm going to kill that damn bird!"
"Another intern," he said, thoroughly enjoying annoying him.
Tony huffed, falling back against his chair. How dare he be bossed around by a civilian, an ignorant, idiotic civilian? "He's got no good points, might as well end this here."
Rhodey got out of his seat, standing opposite the Falcon. He shook his head in disbelief. "Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honour, which is one more than you have."
Steve paused for a moment, "Alright, but can I know why you're running tests on his blood?"
Peter took a deep breath, inhaling the information his Dad had given him. He'd only just became Spider-Man, or at least it felt like that to him, and he wasn't sure if he was quite ready to take of the mask. But if it meant staying on the right side of the law- the law he was trying to keep, then he'd do it what.
"That... And I've got a headache," Peter answered, not elaborated on the details as he didn't want to stress his Dad out.
Picking up another slice of toast, Bucky eyed his boyfriend - not completely sure what to say. So, instead of inputting more to the conversation, he decided to let Steve do all the talking, allowing him to destroy all evidence of the cooked bread.
"Yeah... I think Pops mentioned you once... or twice, or a bajillion times."
The Captain paused - causing the room to be flooded by a silence - or at least a silence with the faint sound of someone eating toast.
"And now I've got genetically enhanced powers... just like Pops," he finished, slightly less enthusiastically.
Bucky placed his hand onto Steve's, making sure to gain his partner's attention. "No. He already hates me for just being your boyfriend. He'd kill me, Steve."
"Morning Peter, have a good night's sleep?" Steve asked, hugging his son for a brief, few seconds before returning to get his breakfast.
"Just realised that Pops isn't here to tell me to watch my language..."
The bedroom door swung open, revealing a shocked Bucky Barnes. He had had a bag of KFC in his metal hand, and had dropped in once he saw the clothing the boy was dressed in.
"I just said, I can't!"
* * *
Bucky continued, "If you don't love him, Stevie, tell him. You're too bad a liar to fake love."
"I didn't realise you liked her in that way," Steve continued, trying to piece together everything about Pepper and Tony that he could, in his mind. "But, I can kinda see it working. She's got a lot to work with."
"Come on, Peter," Steve begged from the other side of the teen's bedroom door. "You need to eat." In truth, Peter knew that not eating wouldn't go down too well with his new abilities, yet he didn't want to sit out there with them.
"Pops says that too... so does Dad."
"Woah, Dad, this is awesome," he exclaimed as he walked back into the lab.
"Aw-ful? Did you just call my amazing comedy awful?"
Tony put his hands on his son's shoulders, "Pete... you've been moved from family before-" He never got to finish his words, he never got to say how it would be different this time because Steve was his Pops.
"Oh, come on, Tony."
The other man, who Steve has just began to realise resembled a wild cat of some sort, slashed at Bucky with his claws. The assassin dodged the attack. Just. He had held up a metal bar to protect himself.
"Morning," Peter responded, for the second time that day.
Recognising the sorrow in his Pops' ocean-like eyes, Peter decided it was probably best to reply. "Because... because you took me away from Dad. I wouldn't of minded living part time, but this... this isn't what I want."
Peter exhaled before replying to both his Dad and Ross. "I'm fine, Dad... honest. If this keeps us on the right side of the law, I'll do it."
"Stop! Peter, alright? I can't hear this stuff without... without feeling like this was all my fault. If it weren't for me having a go at Steve, we wouldn't have gone our own separate ways. You'd have never stayed there. Hydra would never have found you," the man choked, rubbing his eyes to hide the tears. "We can go to KFC... for you, buddy... okay?"
"You've got some powers... which we need to test out. But they're there. Science never lies."
"All the great elements named after people," Ned said, laughing. "Bohrium, Curium, Einsteinium, Lawrencium, Fermium, Rutherfordium and Peterium."
* * *
"I totally agree with you, now. Sure, I wanted to choose a fight that included The Inquisitor but that was really fun." He pulled the headset off of his head, waiting patiently as his friend did the same.
Tony stared at his son, and anxiously responded with, "Sure thing, kiddo. "
"You mean I have to put up with all your flirting, which, by the way, you are not that good at?" Peter asked. His eyes widened. His lip dropping. This was the look Peter gave his father whenever he wanted something. And in all fairness, that didn't happen very often. The kid was grateful. Extremely grateful.
Eventually Steve gave in to the silence, bringing a plate of grilled chicken, fries and a side of salad into the room. "Kiddo, you're hungry. I can hear your stomach growling from the other room."
"What about our lawyer?" questioned Steve, his eyebrows still raised in disbelief of this 'Everett Ross'. He threw a quick glance at Sharon, realising that she too was waiting for an answer.
"Kiddo, you better get used to swinging 'round town in your Underoos."
* * *
“Bird costume?” Sam said, annoyed. He sighed, loudly. “Come on!” He placed the paper on the table and gave Sharon a look that anyone could read.
"Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too," Nat reasoned.
"You deserve this, Mister," Tony stated whilst continuing to tickle his son.
"Well, someone's gotta look out for the little guy, right? And, when I'm not here, who better to than you?"
A divorce?
Steve stood tall, not moving a muscle as armed police arrived and surrounded them. At least fifty guns were pointed at him, ready to fire with a word. War Machine leapt down from above and raised both of his hands. His mask retracted.
Fun? That word didn't seem great coming from Zemo's mouth. In fact, nothing he said ever seemed worth celebrating.
The attorney, who appeared to have been either drunk or was just had a spur of the moment idea ended the meeting by saying, "I now pronounce you single and single. You may now walk away..."
"So, so they do work! That's sick! Did you use my formula for the webbing? Is there multiple combinations? Is there a way to dissolve it, seeing as you sent me to bed before I could make the antiserum? So if there isn't, well then it's your fault, wait no, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry."
"You wanna test out these?" Tony asked, handing Peter two black band-things.
The young boy grit his teeth; the pain may have been bad but it wasn't... unbearable. At least it was nothing compared to what had happened the day before. However, the tension in his body lightened as Zemo removed his hand.
Nat shook her head. "She's right. If this a planned attack it reminds me too much of my... my previous jobs."
Peter didn't know what to say. His Dad would have been great in a situation like this; his snarky comments always lit up the moment. Oh God, his Dad would be worried sick... if he knew Peter was missing. But he didn't... he wouldn't. All because Pops and Bucky had won the court case.
Steve pulled out his phone, one of the latest Stark Industries models. "What if he hates me?" he asked, distressed, as scrolled to find Peter's number. "What if he'd rather have stayed with Tony?"
"Would you like a full English, I believe you had one on your holiday there two years ago?"
"Since we first met. Couldn't mention it back then, of course. Probably would've been shot for it... Now, though, it's a common norm. A man can love a man without anyone hating on it."
Steve shook his head, and passed a plate filled with two fried eggs, three sausages, some bacon and an omelet to Peter: "Good thing he's a Stark-Rogers then..."
"I'm sorry..."
The other three around the table burst out laughing. "Yes, Tony, I'm sure Iron was named after you," Pepper said through her chuckles. "Boys, when was it found?"
"Hello, Rogers."
Bucky smiled softly to show that he kind of understood. "Ah, okay..... go on."
The boy shook his head. All he could remember was everything that had happened after he had woken up. Nothing else. His mind was blank. And it was all Captain America and Iron Man's fault. "I'm sorry."
* * *
"He's gonna kill you if he does find out."
"And I was in a coma for six months," Peter stated calmly. However the young boy wasn't feeling very calm, his mind was taking him back to his time with Hydra. The worst time of his life. Yet he really wanted to go to KFC, Tony never let them go there, the billionaire always made them eat out at fancy restaurants, or stay at home.
Tony chuckled, "I did nothing. Uncle Bird Brain on the other hand..."
Asset? What were they talking about? They mustn't mean, they couldn't mean, did they? As a lightbulb formed in Peter's brain, Bucky Barnes walked in and stood beside the man.
"Yes... Yes, you do."
"Ooh, you said a bad language word," Bucky muttered, and Steve shot him a death glare.
"Tony, if you want to have this talk with me, we'll have it later. Fury called me earlier, found some leads on Bucky, told me to meet him today. Goodbye," Steve said sternly. He was in no mood to argue with his husband, especially over something that involved his son's safety. And anyway, he had more pressing matters on hand: he hadn't seen his old pal's face in forever.
"Does this lunch have to happen?" whispered Peter, his tone sounding very serious, and making Tony struggle not to laugh. His eyes were wide with a mix of fear and terror - something a parent never wanted to see in their child.
"We would protect you," the bot added.
"Clint?" He queried, knowing how well the two former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents got along. Then again he hadn't seen the Hawk since before Peter's.... disappearance.
Steve shook his head in annoyance, using all his willpower not to huff. "What are we giving up to do it.....? I'm sorry, Nat, I.... I can't sign it." He brought his hand to his face, leaning into it. Maybe it would make this Sokovia stuff disappear.
"You're a superhero, kid, I get it. If my parents were Steve and Stark... I'd wanna be one, too."
"Where're you going, Dad?" Peter asked, watching as the brunet rushed past him - sunglasses in hand.
Tony smirked, his personality was rubbing off on the teen. That was probably not a good thing but he was going to let that slide. Who doesn't like Tony Stark? Exactly, nobody. He stood up.
"They were Shield agents, Dad! Level 7! That's higher than you. So, I skimmed through a few of their files and documents. My father... my birth father, was the person who modified those spiders back at Oscorp."
The silence left Tony anxious. Steve usually dealt with this kind of stuff; he was the fun parent - Steve was the parental one.
Steve watched as Falcon swooped down from the sky, heading right towards Steve. "Sam, southwest roof." He braced himself for the impact, and threw himself off the roof onto the neighbouring building.
"The internet. One Clint Barton posted it on one of those social medias," Bucky explained.
"You 'kay kid?" Clint asked, dropping down from the vents, where he had probably been hiding away in a for an unreasonably long period of time.
"The news is going ballistic," Tony commented casually, listening to Steve swear - and by swear, he means say words such as heck and gosh, and complain about how sticky the gears on his motorbike were.
Before Steve had the chance to ask who the clearly delightful man was, Sharon stepped in for him. She introduced him as: "Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander..."
"Sounds great."
"Like to shut up and do your freaking Spanish assignment!"
"Woah," they both said unison.
"Yes they are!" Tony chuckled. He hadn't seen Peter this happy in what seemed like forever, but he knew this was only a cover up - or at least a temporary state of mind. Suddenly, and he didn't know how soon, the teen would remember about Steve and the walls of protection Tony had placed around him would crumble down.
"That's interesting," Steve grunted, envisioning the smug grin on Tony's face as he flew directly above him, watching him struggle like a pensioner trying to figure out how google works. "Couldn't have fixed this up for me, could you?"
"They always are," Sam added, who had just crept into the room without anyone noticing. "Morning y'all."
"So am I. I haven't been this stressed since the last time Peter ran off," Steve replied, a smile tugging at his lips.
Peter walked out through reception, sighing in relief when the cold air of the outside world hit him. He was sweating, whether it was from nerves or heat he couldn't tell, and his vision was blurring.
"That's interesting..."
"So you were lying to me?"
"And who told the intern?" he asked, frowning suspiciously.
"How?"
"What in Satan's name have you done to him? If you hurt my kid-" started Tony, who began to walk over to Zemo, only to be held back by his ex-husband.
"Uh huh..."
The teen did a small dance. At least, Tong hopes it was a dance. It was a mix of his legs bouncing around across the floor and his hands waving through the air. His muscles had all relaxed so the grin on Peter's face was bigger than ever.
"Kid, Pete, I covered for you back there, at least tell me what I did it for."
"Alright, fine.... I'll go call him now."
Nodding, Peter replied with, "Sure."
That would work. Peter could come live with him part of the time, and with Tony the rest of it. They'd be a happy family, eventually. Steve was sure it work, sure Tony would understand.
* * *
"Tell me more about Peter," Bucky exclaimed, his arms wrapped around the blond. The man had mentioned him a few times briefly but had never gone into detail.
"Nat!" Steve announced, standing up to greet the redhead, a smile across his face. The agent was holding a flask, which the blond guessed was not filled with hot cocoa or coffee, and had sat down on the couch opposite then, after shaking the Captain's hand. "What are you doing here? Well I mean other than the fact your live here," he added.
"Steve doesn't think I'm a fit parent, he thinks I'm a bad influence on you-"
"Stand down! Stand down!"
Peter's eyes lit up, a smile forming on his face. "Wait... You mean I get to come on patrol with you and the rest of the squad?"
And you know what happened next?
Peggy could have been alone when she passed... or as Steve would rather think, she had been surrounded by her carers: the people who had looked after her for the last few years. It was best not to think about it, though. Death and Steve Rogers didn't really get along.
Peter eventually stopped hugging his Pops and sat down next to him - finally noticing Bucky. "Who the hell are you?" he asked, earning himself a disapproved glare from Steve.
Tony looked down at his son, who's face was hidden in the man's chest. "What is it, bud?"
Peter glanced over to his friend, watching as Ned's eyes lit up. His friend was a huge Iron Man fan so obviously this was going to be a huge deal for him. "Oh my god," Ned whispered to Peter, "Tony Stark said we're on a first name basis."
Steve smiled thinly. "No, I don't. Sometimes."
Steve took a step back, taking in the sight that had just appeared out of nowhere. A man, clad entirely in sparkling charcoal, slammed into the side of Bucky, pushing the assassin onto the rough ground. If the newcomer was strong enough to best Bucky, it was probably bad news. Steve had always looked up to his pal in terms of strength, even after the serum changed his body. Bucky was mentally and physically strong... something Steve wished he knew how to be. His emotions always seemed to get the better of him. That's why he liked heading down to the boxing ring; it gave him a chance to take out his anger in a manageable way.
Tony  g u l p e d.
"Hey, Pete, we're outside."
"Are you sure you want to do this, Pete?" Tony asked from the other side of the room, watching as his son picked up the pen to sign the Accords. Ross was stood behind Peter's chair, watching the teen in a mixture of fear and morbid curiosity.
Putting his hands up in surrender, the brunet took a step back: almost hitting the wall behind him.
Zemo chuckled to himself as he injected a serum into Peter's arm. "Director will be proud of my efforts." He signalled for a blond to enter the room. "Take him back to his room... Now!"
"Wha-at?" Tony mumbled, finally noticing Steve was there, "Oh hi, Stevie."
"Tell me everything, and I mean everything, that has happened since the bite."
The kid's eyes widened even more. "You mean you're actually gonna properly meet Ned?" Truth he told, Tony had never really, actually met his son's best friend. Usually, he was too busy or some emergency pulled him away from the Tower. Rhodey had met him, so had Clint and Happy, but the philanthropist still was yet to meet the boy.
Once dinner was finished, Peter and Ned decided to head back into the games room, deciding to venture into another reality....
"I thought it would be pretty sweet actually, MJ," Ned insisted, turning around in his seat.
“My name is Bucky.”
"Now, Soldier," said the man, eyes smiling at Bucky, "Take our newest recruit to the Dark Room."
Steve pulled a rug from beneath one of the German men, sending him flying. They may not have been fighting on the same team but at least now they had a mutual enemy. Bucky brought the blond back from his thoughts by slamming another man against the wall, the man's eyes rolling inside his head at the impact. "Buck! Stop! You're gonna kill someone."
"Arms out."
"I am your father!" Tony shouted, his voice modified by the mask. He pulled it off. He could tell Peter had gotten freaked out, nervous even... "Ned, is it okay if I take you back early?"'
"Gravitonium..." whispered Tony, now understanding everything that was happening. "You helped Ian Quinn?"
Again clickingkey-boards has helped out with this chapter. We all really owe it to her that I'm able to get this story out on time.
"She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company."
The world began to spin round as the boy was thrown against the ceiling. What was happening? Was he going crazy? His head hurt badly - really badly, and now the spinning was turning into dizziness.
"No, Tony. Because of you."
* * *
The blond pushed him in through a door to his right, and forced him onto a chair.
"You're lucky you are still technically injured, otherwise I might have had to come over there and tickled you, Mister," Tony replied. He raised his hands, miming the movements in jest.
"No, but it's run by people with agendas. And, agendas change."
Stretching out her arms, the assassin got Ross' attention just as he began to exit the room. "And if we come to a decision you don't like?" she asked.
"A spider bite?" she questioned, her face emotionless, making it hard for Peter to tell if she was joking. "Relax, I'm kidding," she added: somehow reading his mind.
Tony fell to his knees beside the blond, shaking his head in denial. "Pete, kiddo, this isn't your time to go. You've gotta wake up." His voice began to shake, his eyes watering as he stammered, "You've gotta wake up, right now."
"You ever built a flying car?" he asked, turning his head away from the ceiling to look at Tony's.
"Thanks for the dad joke, Dad. Definitely wanted to hear another one of your awful puns."
"Ste-"
"They're lying to you, you know."
"I know, because you're a very polite person."
Bucky grinned. "Well I'm pleased to finally meet you, Peter. Your... Pops has spoken a lot about you."
"Peter..." Tony started, leaving the teen as pale as a ghost. Tony almost never called him by his actual name: it was always nicknames and pet names, mainly to annoy him. "Your Pops and I had a bit of an argument downstairs. He's gonna stay with that friend of his, Bucky, the one everyone was looking for, until we sort things out." If we sort things out, Tony thought.
At that moment, Peter's bedroom door opened and, the boy tiptoed out of the room. He was wearing black tracksuit pants, and a Captain america tee, and was rubbing his eyes sheepishly. "Bucky, what was all that shouting? Who are you?" he asked, blinking rapidly.
Tony was stood up in the middle of an office, his neck craned in an effort to keep his phone in place as he noted something down. He tossed the paper to the side, before saying, "No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup."
"Okay, let's begin. Mr Rogers, your statement - if you'd please."
Peter shoved Tony away, his super strength sending his Dad a few metres back. "It isn't, though. You're sending me away. You're not even putting up a fight. You're meant to be Iron Man but you can't even protect me."
The four continued to fight, trying to escape from the others in the area. Someone threw a bomb at a building, sheltering the street in rubble. The man in black let go of Sam's leg, grabbing at Bucky and Steve swerved the vehicle through the debris, leaping out and pulling the man away from his friend.
* * *
Steve took another long, hard stare at the the blurry photo of the man, who had been behind the bombing of the congress meeting in Vienna. “Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?”
"The kid told me, while we were playing chess," he said, a satisfied grin on his features. "He said he heard it from an intern at SI."
Vasily Karpov was one of the best handlers Hydra ever had. He had made sure The Winter Soldier would be worthy of all the praise the organisation gave him. He also kept the asset in line, punishing him relentlessly until the man he had once been shattered into a million pieces, leaving behind just an empty shell. He was also an organised man with an organised mind. He had a good memory and believe it careless to forget even one single mission report. That's why Zemo had come to him.
For a minute that seemed impossibly long, the room was quiet - not quite silent, just an unsettling kind of quiet. The only sound was of breathing: Zemo's calm, relaxed breaths and Peter's heavy and broken breaths, verging on hyperventilation.
Peter nodded and started fiddling with his new shooters, as Tony picked up his phone. "Hey... Steve."
"Everything?" Peter suggested, walking over to his Dad and leaning in against his chest.
"Bucky used to make for us back before the war... after my Mom passed. He knew I didn't feed myself too much and still seems to have a knack for cooking."
"That, well that's nice. See you at the next briefing, I guess..."
"He's not dead, kiddo. Just missing."
"What?" Ned asked, unsure of what his friend was trying to raise to his attention. He seemed scared, worried... Ned had heard of people listing stuff to calm themselves down but he didn't understand why Peter was so panicked by the dark.
Ross patted the kid firmly on the shoulder, causing Tony to shudder. "You've got yourself a smart kid, Stark. Maybe you should take some advice from him." The General laughed.
"You've barely read it!"
"Jeez, kiddo. What's gotten into you?"
Tony hauled himself off the ground, walking back over to his son. "I am protecting you, bud. If you want to be able to see me again you're just gonna have to along with this."
* * *
Peter's wide, brown eyes met his father's - blinking every few seconds to keep away the tears. "That's because I've never, ever, been taken away from the people, or person, I loved."
Ross continued. "Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground."
"Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir." Tony shoved his phone back into his pocket. He looked sympathetically at Peter, knowing full well what it felt like to be stuck in your father's business room with nothing to do.
"Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony." He slammed his fist again the table, flinching when a glass fell and shattered. They both ignored it.
"You'll remember eventually."
"Woah! Easy, tiger...." Tony exclaimed sarcastically, "We don't want you getting even more injured - do we?" He pulled his hand away from the kid's hair, and added, "Fri, tell Steve to get up here now. Say Pete's awake."
* * *
"Hey, Peter, how are you?" Steve said, trying to start a conversation. After a few seconds of silence, Tony nudged the boy's shoulder, hoping to get his attention.
Steve said nothing. The absence of a good friend and colleague hurt. Fury, however, seemed to never grieve. Never.
"Hey... loser. You coming or not?"
The voice's owner, a boy that looked roughly his height and age replied, "The name's Parker. Peter Parker." Then, after looking at the other's confused stares added, "Sorry, I've always wanted to do that. It's from a movie."
Peter frowned, swirling his spoon around on his bowl of lucky charms. "What do you mean?" He asked it as more of a reality check than anything else. He knew exactly what it meant: he was only gonna be able to stay with one of his parents, if it ends up in the hand of a judge.
"But I love you anyway..."
Bucky grinned, "I sure did. Me and my pal Alfie used to play it back in the day... Your Pops, here, can't play to save his life."
"Of course, you'll be amazing. It'll be a little rocky at first, but it always is when you learn something new. He seems to like you as a chess partner, if that's any consolation."
That made Tony's heart shatter into a million pieces... Why was his son so precious? He and Steve had made an amazing decision in deciding to adopt him. Talking about Steve... the old man had said he needed to discuss some stuff with him over lunch. "You have two options today, Petey. You can come to lunch with me and your Pops, or you can stay here at the Tower with Vis and Wanda."
"Just don't talk about it," Tony said, glaring at the soldier as he combed his fingers through Peter's hair. "If this is what you wanted to discuss then we're leaving."
"You're a great influence," reassured the teen.
"No, it's okay. You can talk about him, Pete. I don't mind. But, what exactly do you mean you're now like me and your Pops?"
Bucky burst out laughing, unable to keep a straight face. "You thought Peggy Carter and Howard Stark? Oh my gawd, you're adorable."
“We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.”
"I have you now, Soldier," he hissed, his accent thick and his breathing quiet, "I have you now."
Tony grabbed at one of the blanket's creases, fiddling with it in his hands. He could see his son fighting to stay awake, the need to know being the only thing forcing his eyes to stay open. If he told Peter, the kid would be worried sick... but if he didn't tell him, the boy would know he was lying. "Kid... every enhanced individual has to sign this contract."
"Uhuh, kiddo. 'Bout time I meet the kid I've been spending all my money on for your movie premieres and comic cons." He was joking, of course. Those events cost less than the bottle of whisky he was currently pouring from. It barely made a dent in the small wallet he carried around for those weird places that didn't accept cards, let alone his actual fortune.
