“But it’s only a half a block away, Dad!  Like I can literally see it from the parking lot!”  Peter rolled his eyes, tugging on the strap of his backpack.  He was thirteen, for heaven’s sake, not three, and could more than handle a half a block walk without holding his daddy’s hand.
"If you say so, sir," JARVIS said warily.
" Tony muttered. "Where in the hell does this guy get off—?"
And, since in that moment he didn't even think he could have moved if he’d wanted to, that stance made even more sense.
Which made the possibility of her leaving him next summer to go to England seem all that much worse.
Gwen gave him a rueful smile. "Well, I know I'm not the smartest person in the class, but I'm no dummy either. Your lightning-fast reflexes when I almost dropped my computer that one time? Your bad reaction to the peppermint in my mom's cake? The fact that I found your clothes at Liz's house that night of her party, and how you were able to save my dad's life when the movie theatre blew up? It all makes sense."
Hulk cuts him off with a booming roar, one so Earth-shatteringly loud that Steve has to fight the urge to clap his hands over his ears.
As he continued his search, Tony's mind buzzed with details, as well as various offshoots of potential problems that might arise. It was a testimony to how much Steve had managed to influence him over their years together that Tony was trying to even come up with a plan, instead of simply winging it like he'd done on all of his initial missions as Iron Man.
"Thanks," said Tony. He sat down next to Peter on the bed, brushing the hair off his forehead. "You're gonna be okay, buddy, yeah? Papa's Ma's gonna take really good care of you."
Steve thought as his hand instinctively curled into a fist and his blood pressure went into a sudden freefall. He sucked in a deep breath, pointedly ignoring the look of concern Bucky was tossing at him as he stared at Anthony Stark's face, trying with all of his might not to glare so harshly that he drew Colonel Phillips's attention.
"It's gonna be okay, sweetheart."
Another tear rolled down Uncle Bucky's cheek, pooling into the scruffy whiskers covering his chin.
—who could convince Tony otherwise.
"Goddamnit, baby, just open me up already!" Tony begged. He was gripping the sheets so tightly with his clenched hands that pain shot through his knuckles. "Please, Steve, I need you inside me!"
"Tony!" she exclaimed. "I noticed Mr Beck stomping down the hall towards the elevator a few minutes ago, so I thought I'd come and see how the meeting went. I take it didn't go well?"
"That's my sensitive man," Tony whispered as he did it again, pulling a choked moan from Steve's throat. "You like that, don't you baby?"
"Copy that," Tony said. "Rhodey and I will take off as soon as JARVIS is done upgrading the drone."
Tony quirked an eyebrow. "He says he has that Asgardian guardian of his keep an eye on us, whatever that means, but if that's the case then why didn't he show up at the bunker? We could've used him then too."
"She can't babe, 'cause it's right here," said Tony. He pointed to one of the lines on the screen with a shaking hand, with Steve's blood turning to ice as he saw it.
The tall, blond, and handsome guy he knew he loved with his entire heart and soul and everything in between.
I saw
"Not exactly," answered Steve with a light chuckle. "There weren't really many opportunities for home-cooked meals in the Army."
"Oh, Christ," Steve heard Sam mutter as he took off, leaping onto the tank just as Rumlow was preparing to fire again. He swung his shield, intending to strike Rumlow in the head as Rumlow raised his right arm to block the blow, landing a hard punch to Steve's abdomen with his left. Steve grunted as he fell sideways from the tank, managing to right himself just in time to land on his feet. Both of Rumlow's forearms were covered in thick, metal gauntlets, not too unlike the first few versions of Tony's gauntlets, and sounded exactly like the old WWII HYDRA weapons as they charged.
"You're too high up, buddy!" Dad said. "You're running out of air!"
"And you taught Peter," Steve said. "He told me that as well."
into the Arctic water to keep it from unleashing its Tesseract-powered bombs onto New York City, and that's exactly what he had been doing in the dream as well. Only in his dream it had been in the here and now, not 1944, which meant that—
Would he manage to find it still intact?  He supposed that was anyone’s guess.  All Steve knew at the moment was that in the six or so minutes he was inside the store, Tony Stark had managed to completely captivate him, which meant there was no way he could continue channelling all of his pent-up resentment and hatred towards him.
"Uh huh," Peter replied. "Thanks."
"One of his Uncle James', Dad," Gwen said with a wide smile. "Peter has two of them."
“Uh huh.”  As Peter swims, he uses his breaths on the breaststroke laps to keep an eye on Dad and Mr Rogers as they talk, almost snorting water up his nose when he sees Dad shuffle from foot to foot as Mr Rogers starts to laugh at something he said.
"Oh, like you're one to talk," Steve retorted, kissing Tony's hand again to help take the sting from his words. "How 'bout we both try. You haven't really slept since the night this all happened, and—" He broke off, glancing mournfully at their son. "And I think Peter would like it if we curled up with him for awhile."
“Hey, JARVIS?”
"That was mean!" Peter wheezed, his eyes watering. "I mean, Ned's brilliant and all, but—"
“Two weeks?” Obie said, nearly choking on his Scotch.  “Oh, c’mon, Tony!  You can’t do it any faster than that?  They might forget about the whole damn thing by then!”
had made as it sank into the freezing Arctic water, back in 1945.  A sound that despite Steve’s best efforts to purge from his mind, still managed to regularly find its way into his nightmares.
"At your service, Captain."
“You did great today, little guy!” Steve says after Peter’s final touch.  “I’m already so proud of you!”
“Yeah,” Steve said as a smile broke out across his beautiful face.  “That sounds perfect.”
"And there's that huge guest room there that never even gets used, and I really want to show her around everywhere, and introduce her to Pietro and Wanda, and she's told me a few times that she's never been upstate, and in the early spring it's really pretty and stuff with all the leaves that are starting to bud, and—"
As soon as the elevator doors had closed both Dad and Papa turned to Peter, wearing their nearly identical "worried dad looks" that had Peter wishing he could sink into the couch cushions and disappear.
"How bad—" he started, slamming his jaw closed when Helen raised her hand.
As soon as he heard the sound of Uncle James's retreating footsteps, Peter laid back, trying to make it look like he hadn't been listening. About three seconds later Uncle Bucky rapped on his door.
Tony chuckled as his son instantly transformed into the perfect gentleman as Rhodey introduced him to Carol, his “It’s really awesome to meet you!” bringing proud smiles to both Tony and Steve’s faces.
"Pete, you all right?" Dad called from somewhere on the opposite side of the ship. "I can't see you!"
“Oh, and whatever it is that Obie’s going on about, tell him that he’s just gonna have to wait until this afternoon, yeah?  I got some other stuff to work on this morning.”
"Spoken like a true artist," Papa said with a wink. Then he stepped over to the window, leaning against the frame with his arms crossed.
“I would love to,” Steve said.  It wasn't until about three heartbeats had passed that he realised Tony had just essentially informed him that there would be more evenings like the one they had just spent together.
"Guess I'll see ya tomorrow," Ned said.
"Oh, you think so?" Steve said, raising an eyebrow. "But you still haven't told me what you want."
After not even three months, he had grown so used to having Steve there in the bed with him, grown so used to having his warm, solid body pressed up against him and his arm draped across his waist, that the thought of having to sleep alone was… well, it was just not okay.
Tony rolled his eyes, his fingers twitching in Steve's. "Fine, mother hen, we can go have coffee. But just one, okay? I've got a lot of data to look through, and since none of the SHIELD scientists know how to organise anything, it's kind of a mess."
"I want to move Peter to my ma's house," Steve blurted out. "Before I leave on the Phoenix mission."
"Well, then it's a good thing that I asked for a gate to be installed at our new house," said Steve. "Hopefully that'll be enough to keep them out. I don't mind giving an interview or two when the time is right, but there's no need for anyone to bother us at our home."
Tony quickly glanced at Helen, who gave a small shake of her head. Mental injuries weren't her thing, they were Sam's, who no doubt was going to have his work cut out for him once they finally were able to get Steve home.
T'Challa nodded, jerking his head towards General Okoye. "Then Thanos shall have it. We have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, and my Dora Milaje. I believe that together with your team, Captain, we shall emerge victorious."
"I'm sure she would," Peter answered. "I'll ask Dad, see what he says. I know he doesn't see you as a security threat, and it's not like you'd try anything with Auntie Nat sitting right there anyway."
It had started out awful, even more so than his trip to the scene before Afghanistan. He was in the HYDRA prison, the invisible bunker hidden on the remote Georgia island, under the influence of so many mind-altering drugs and in so much pain from his shattered foot that he could barely stand, much less attempt to fight against what he now knew had been a vision-induced evil version of his own husband.
As soon as they left the room Peter grabbed for his phone, trying to decide whether or not to text Gwen. He doubted that she'd be asleep as she had told him before that she tended to be a night owl on the weekends, but he didn't want her to get in trouble with her parents either.
"Ah, hello? Do you guys remember me?" the man said. "I'm the one who kinda tried to break into your house a little over a year ago?"
"Correct, babe," said Tony. "So far the only thing we've been able to find out about Baker is that he was never employed at SHIELD, or at least not officially. Other than that there's nothing."
But before Tony could even answer, the water level in the lake suddenly dropped about a metre as the fog began to rise straight off the surface, swirling counterclockwise as it coalesced into what could only be described as some kind of water monster. Once it was fully formed the creature let out a roar, one so loud that Steve was forced to close his eyes against the pain in his frozen ears.
I can’t wait to see what you guys think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
“Goodnight, buddy.”
"Need you," Steve whispered, sliding his hand underneath Tony's waistband. "Please."
"We're all well aware of how chaotic it's been these last ten months, Scott," Steve said in his Captain's voice. He didn't add that from his perspective, Scott might've actually had it a bit easier, believing he had been gone for only ten minutes. "But what exactly did you drive all the way across the country here to tell us?"
Uncle Bucky bit his lip, as if he was divulging a deep secret. "Yeah, I did, or at least I suspected. Never said nothin' to him, though, I didn't wanna embarrass him."
Aside from Thor, who was an actual god, Steve was the closest that living, breathing humanoids came to being indestructible.
The words swirl around in Steve’s mind like a feverish dream, bouncing off the softened edges like a ping-pong ball that’s grown spikes.  He groans as he slowly regains consciousness, attempting to blink open his eyes, his body giving a violent jerk when he realises that they’re completely frozen shut.
Tony scowled.
About fifteen or twenty seconds later his phone beeped, indicating that JARVIS was cutting power to his foot repulsors because he was only ten seconds out.
competition? Nothing wrong with having an edge on the opponents, right?"
"What?" Steve asked as he glanced up at the ceiling, swiping droplets of cold sweat from his forehead. "JARVIS?"
Dr Strange threw up his hands, rolling his eyes. "Well, that's just great. So now the very thing that I didn't want to happen is going to happen."
too much like the sound of a ship sinking.
"Don't worry, Cap," said Cam. "We've all got your back."
Steve’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed.  “But… what if—what if I’m not… fixable?  Tony, what if… we
Frustrated, Steve slammed the end of his bat down onto the plate, the resulting
Peter breathed in slowly, his hands clenching into tight fists at his sides.
Colonel Phillips owed Steve's father, Steve never found out. All he knew was the very next day, even though Steve was already eighteen and technically a year older than the military preferred for its enlisted men, his ma approached Steve and asked him if he wanted to participate in the program.
"Hush," Tony said, brushing his fingertips across Steve's lips as he worked the tank top over his head. Steve shuddered as Tony's calloused palms slid all across his neck and chest, as if he was trying to re-familiarise himself with Steve's body. Desire pooled deep in Steve's gut, sending bursts of flame across his nerve endings with every single touch of Tony's skin against his, and he couldn't help but let out a loud moan as Tony's thumbs scraped across his nipples, earning a rather cheeky smirk from his husband.
"All right, Nat," he murmured. "Let's bring the pager here and see if Bruce can recreate the signal."
Tony said on a moan as Steve began to stroke them, grinding his hips against Tony’s as Tony’s knees hooked over his hips, his heels pressing against the backs of Steve’s thighs.  “Shit, baby, you're so good.  You feel so fucking good!”
"Bruce? What did you find?" Steve demanded.
Steve let out a slight smile. "All of the above?" he replied, his jaw twitching as a thought suddenly occurred to him. He reached for Tony's waist, relieved when Tony didn't flinch or otherwise pull away as he pressed their foreheads together. "Did you know?"
Sam's eyebrows knitted together as he tore off another piece off his scone. "You feel like going into a bit more detail about that?"
Peter breathed in, squaring his shoulders. "He ends up destroying his creator, and then he goes free."
"Sounds good." Tony picked up his coffee cup, frowning when he saw that it was empty. "Any word back yet about getting in to see Toomes?"
Tony breathed. "You have no idea just how sexy that is, do you? I mean, there's just no way that you could possibly know, because—"
"Yeah, he is," Tony said, clearing his throat. "And thanks. I… uh… think so too."
"Well, hopefully Dad's new foundation is gonna help with that," stated Peter. "He told me that Pepper already approved big discounts to the medicines that Stark Industries helped to develop, and she also set up a slush fund for certain really expensive medicines as part of the Stark Relief Foundation. Things like Epi-Pens and insulin, and certain cancer drugs."
It was too much for Peter to even wrap his mind around. He had never,
But apparently not this day.
"Sure. Have at it, bud."
Peter sniffed, swiping at the tears tracking down his face as he tried to take the slow, even breaths that would help his heart rate to slow down.
"Uh huh," Peter said with a nod, causing Tony's heart to lurch. His sweet boy was trying hard to put on a brave face, but Tony could read him well enough to know that he was just as terrified as Tony.
Tony froze. "I am
"Ah, Scott?" Steve said, grunting when Scott nearly jumped out of his skin. "Um… this is Captain Rogers. Can you please tell us what you're doing here?"
But, as Peter suspected, the rain sounds didn't help much, if at all. And when the alarm went off the next morning, having not slept a single wink, his body stiff and sore from being curled into a tight ball the entire night, it hit him then that it hadn't been just a dream after all.
"No, thanks," answered Steve. He held up his phone. "I'll… I'll be okay. I just need—"
Which was yet another thing that he and Steve had in common. Tony knew all about trying to bury traumatic memories to avoid dealing with them, or finding less-than-helpful ways of dealing with them when they refused to stay buried. Drinking, gambling, and throwing himself into his work, Tony had tried them all in his attempts to process the various traumas associated with his father, both when he was still alive and with his abrupt death.
Mr Stacy waved a dismissive hand. "I'm sure he has, and I'm sure to you it doesn't seem odd that the very people who caused the mess in the first place are now being paid to clean it up."
“Mmm, we’ll see,” Tony says.  Then he smoothes the curls away from Peter’s forehead and plants a kiss there, just like he’s done ever since Peter was a baby.  “I love you, buddy.”
"You did? Is he okay?" Steve quickly asked.
Tony rolled his eyes as he made his way to the living room, finding Clint and Pietro's faces already on the monitor just as Steve came in from the back, where he'd been busy stacking firewood to save for their next visit.
And, based on what Carol explained whenever she touched base from her travels—which always seemed to be when Rhodey was around, now that Tony thought about it—none of the other planets in the universe were faring any better.
Dr Strange gave a nod. "That's right."
“That’s ‘cause you're amazing,” Steve said just before bringing their lips together.  As he deepened the kiss, Steve shifted so Tony was lying on top of him, straddling his waist.  Then he took hold of Tony’s hips and rocked up to meet them, Tony’s answering gasp sending a bolt of pleasure straight to his crotch.  “God, Tony, you’re just so fucking gorgeous.  I want you so badly, and—”
"That's really,
"There, there," Grandma said, patting his back. She held out a glass of water. "Take a drink now, okay?"
Tony slowly shook his head, squeezing his eyes closed as his lower lip started to shake. "Steve, I can't—I can't leave him. Not now. Not again. If I would've—I should've been there. I should've been able to
"You guys go ahead, I'll meet you back at the jet," Steve said as he reached for his phone. "I just need—"
"All right, then let's get you situated," Papa said as he lifted Peter up, carrying him into his room. Peter was still shaky enough that Dad had to help him get undressed and into his pajamas, but once that was done and he was resting on top of three heating pads with two more draped over his knees and sipping some of Papa's awesome hot chocolate and some homemade soup, he did feel a bit better.
"All right, buddy," he said quietly. "You're an Avenger now."
Tony huffed, tearing his gaze away from his husband's piercing blue eyes, shining like the dotted lights in the distant skyscrapers. "Well… yeah, I s'pose I could have, but after I upgraded the locator chips, I just figured that I may as well upgrade your suit too, 'cause it gets to the point where it's just easier to make a whole new one. So I changed up the Kevlar a bit and made a few other changes that I think you'll enjoy."
But Tony pressed his fingers to Steve's lips, cutting off his self-deprecating rant. "Damnit, honey, when are you gonna realise that this team knows you better than you think? They all know what you're feeling, and even more so when you try so hard to hide it. And you know you can't hide anything from me, don't you?"
Steve grunted as Tony unlocked the door and helped him inside, bringing him over to the bed. Curfew was due to begin in about ten minutes, which meant that he had just enough time to hurry down to the mess hall and grab some food before the lights went out.
All the better for Steve to ask the two most important questions he had ever asked in his entire life.
looks. "The fact that you actually thought there would be is rather laughable, Wilson."
Yet another thing that didn't sit right with him.
Which, if Steve was being honest, he probably would.
"Yes," Dr Strange said grimly. "It is time for us to join in the battle. The Avengers need our help."
"Pardon me, sir," JARVIS said gently, jarring Tony from his fitful semi-doze. "But Miss Stacy is on the line requesting an update on Master Peter's condition, and she sounds rather concerned."
"Hey, little guy," Steve said, his heart skittering as he carefully patted Peter on the shoulder. Steve hadn't seen Sharon at the nurses' station and so wasn't able to ask her how Peter was doing, and while Steve was certainly no medical expert it sure seemed to him that Peter's condition was still deteriorating despite being in the hospital. His normally pale skin was even paler than usual, and he seemed to be wasting away, his shoulders and arms nothing but skin and bones.
"I know, you've told me that before," Steve said. "You told me that his parents adored you, and that—"
Steve thought with a firm shake of his head. He couldn't afford to think like that. Not now, not when everyone was looking to him to lead the most important mission he'd ever led in his life.
For a moment, Tony could only gape in awe at the absolutely beautiful man standing in front of him, unable to even form words. After their wedding, Tony had had the studio remodeled to add more windows for the natural light that Steve preferred, and the afternoon sun was streaming through those very windows now, highlighting the lighter strands in Steve's blond hair like a halo and causing his intense blue eyes—with the tiny hint of green—to appear even more striking than usual. The fact that his hands and arms were covered in various multicoloured paint smudges only added to the overall effect.
"That the so-called Meridian government got their hands on at least half of the created doses?" said Colonel Phillips. "Then you would be correct, Captain. Although apparently their initial experience with the serum wasn't all that great, so they ended up scrapping the whole super-soldier idea altogether."
Steve's heart felt like a huge ball of lead as he stood on one of the hovering Wakandan warrior transports, zooming across the vast plain that stretched from the palace. A few metres from the transport was Bruce, running along in the Veronica armour as he attempted to get accustomed to it.
Not taking his eyes off the screen, Peter fumbled around on his bed until he came across his external keyboard, connecting it via Bluetooth to his tablet and opening a clean document file.
"Take off your pants and lie down on the bed," Tony said. "Face down."
"Of course," JARVIS said, filling Peter's vast bedroom with the soothing sound of gently falling rain. "Is there anything else that you require?"
"Which isn't out of the realm of possibility, especially with these newfangled machines that you've designed," said Phillips. "And if everything continues to go as planned, then I don't see why—"
“Yeah,” replied Rhodey.  “‘Bout time we both settled down, don't ya think?”
"Sure, bud," Tony said with a smile. He'd never been able to resist Peter's infectious enthusiasm. He handed Peter the air container and his glasses, tapping Bucky lightly on the shoulder. "That okay with you?"
"We're just going to the back of the room, mo grá," Steve pleaded as Bucky took his place next to Peter. He offered Peter his metal left hand which Peter immediately latched onto, squeezing it so tightly that his knuckles went white. "Bucky's gonna stay here with Peter."
"Oh, so Steve doesn't deserve that same caution?" snapped Tony. "And why is—?"
Not when Papa's life was at stake.
If anything, Peter's constant presence would probably only make things worse. It'd been a long time since Dad and Papa had had any alone time, and Peter knew that Papa was especially looking forward to it.
"No!" Tony screamed as he bolted upright, sweating and panting into the semi-darkness of the bedroom. "Oh God, no, you can't—I'm not gonna let you take—!"
“Fine,” he said.  “But can you at least tell me what’s going on?  ‘Cause you were all sorts of twitchy when you got to the store today, so… what happened?”
Part of his whole 1940s stoicism thing, or something like that. Tony's heart ached as he remembered how Rhodey had found him in Peter's room, sprawled across his rumpled bed and clutching his stuffed polar to his chest. Rhodey had literally ordered Tony to sit up, to look at him and listen as he told Tony that he had just brought Steve to the infirmary with two very busted-up hands, and that he needed to go to his husband right the hell now.
"Duly noted!" said Dad. "STANE, analyse his fight pattern!"
"That's 'cause we're all gonna be landing in Wakanda together," said Tony. "Those of us who made it off Titan after the snap won't be starting out there again. That'll be part of what's different this go-round."
“Ah, and you do the same, Captain,” Mr Reeves said with a wave.  “And you as well, young man.”
"Damn right, babe," Tony said, smiling proudly. "So let's go kick this fucker's ass."
Papa gave a nod, smiling softly. "You're right, little guy," he said, clapping a hand on Peter's shoulder. "You're pretty smart, you know that?"
"Indeed it is, sir," said JARVIS.
Bucky grinned, firing a bullet directly between the alien's eyes. "Copy that." Less than a second later the four Chitauri were laid out on the plain, and Bucky was already reloading.
“Oh, you're welcome,” said Pepper.  “And again, I know I’m probably way off base here, but Happy’s noticed the same thing in your son.  He told me that Peter’s guards have noticed that he seems happier than he’s been in a long time too, so… whatever you're both doing that’s been different, it seems to be working pretty well.”
"Well…" Steve said as he picked up Tony's left hand, twirling the titanium ring that encircled his third finger. "It might have something to do with this."
He'd have plenty of time for that while she was gone.
Peter let out a squeak, his heart hammering against his ribcage as the images of him clinging to his father for dear life flooded his mind. He sucked in a deep, shaky breath, gripping Gwen's hand as tightly as he dared.
"Yeah, I just saw him yesterday when I brought Riley's stuff out to Erin. I think he's six months now? Something like that. Looks just like Riley too, poor kid."
he thought, gripping the counter with both hands.
"Yeah, okay, but can we please dispense with some of the lovey-dovey talk?" asked Carol. "'Cause I'm pretty sure that I'm either gonna puke or go into sugar shock here."
"You mean, that you used to use for your suits, do you not, sir?" JARVIS asked.
He would just have to hope that they could get together without guards or chaperones sometime soon. Maybe after spring break was over they could plan another date.
"We're gonna be back here at midnight sharp, okay boys?" Papa said as he turned to face Peter. "Not a minute later. And Peter, if you happen to sense anything weird, anything at all, don't wait to call us. All right?"
"You can hold his hand if it helps you feel better," Shuri said as she quickly soaked another cloth, wrapping it around Tony's right forearm. "It will not hurt him."
"Pete? Buddy, you stay with me!" Tony called over the comm as Steve snuck a glance up, pride flaring in his chest as he watched Peter execute a perfect landing onto Tony's back. A wide open, fairly treeless plain didn't exactly play to Peter's strengths as Spider-Man, but Steve knew that his boy would be okay as long as he stuck close to one of their team members.
"I know we'd all appreciate it if you could personally oversee the transfer and arraignment of these prisoners, Chief Stacy, until we know better who else we can trust," Sam said. "I can ask Natasha and Clint if they'll go with you for extra security if you'd like."
"I've been going to visit sick kids at the hospital for a few years now," he said. "Usually a couple afternoons a week. One afternoon when I went there I met Tony's son, only I didn't know he was his son at the time. It was the day before our first 302 briefing."
The words were barely out of Steve's mouth when Tony felt his blood pressure spike and a bolt of pain shoot down his left forearm.
to their son's head that he would've been just as scared out of his wits as Tony—and been just as livid afterwards—but Steve also would have realised that now that the standoff was over, they needed to put it behind them and focus on the task at hand.
"New Avengers' facility? That must've meant the Compound!" Peter exclaimed, clapping his hand over his mouth a second later. He had already deactivated JARVIS for the night, not wanting to be bugged every three minutes about why he was still awake, but the last thing he wanted was to possibly wake up Papa, who Peter knew had not been sleeping well lately.
Tipping his head back, Peter sucked in the slowest, deepest breath that he could, pressing his palm over his heart that was racing so fast he was surprised that it hadn't just decided to explode and be done with it.
"Are you okay with all this?" he asked as he drew Tony flush against him, tucking his head under his chin. "I'm sorry that I didn't ask you first, but—"
Tony tapped his chin. "And that was it, J?"
”Tony’s ready, Thor,” says Steve.  “Take him up.”
"Okay?" Tony said, scowling deeply. "So, what, can he shrink at will or something?"
Ned shot him an odd look. "Why the hell are you so uptight all of a sudden? Just because—?"
"I mean, it's totally fine if you do," he quickly added. "I just… it's probably not all that fun. Is it?"
Unfortunately, it had been nothing but a colossal waste of time. Not only had O'Brien proceeded to laugh in Tony's face when he demanded to know of Hank Pym's whereabouts, but he had also informed Tony in no uncertain terms that Pym was so adept at hiding that there'd be "no chance in hell" that anyone would ever be able to find him.
"Very funny, Flash," Gwen said, scowling at the older boy. "Besides, there's nothing wrong with looking young, as I'm sure Captain America would agree."
Doctor List took another step forward, his upper lip curling into a sneer as Steve instinctively tried to back away, bringing a fresh wave of pain washing across his body.
—to Steve the ring was a tactile symbol of that very hope. The three stones in the ring, the blue stone flanked by the two red stones, represented each of them: Steve, Tony, and Peter, with the etched phoenix a symbol of their rebirth as a complete family.
"Um, I don't know, Ned," Peter finally said. "Do you need a new shirt?"
"I always aim to please, Master Peter," said JARVIS. "As you are well aware."
Tony's eyebrows knitted together into a frown. "Steve, I'm not here to mooch off of you. That's not—"
“Yeah, I bet,” said Ned.  “It’s funny how much you don't realise you use your pinky finger for until you can’t anymore, huh?”
"There's no way you would've made it, honey," he forced past the lump in his throat. "No possible way."
"Sorry, asshole!" Peter yelled as he swung Fake Man over his head, crashing the armour to the floor. "But I don't think imitation is the best form of flattery here!"
“Hey now,” Tony suddenly murmured, brushing away a tear that had somehow escaped from Steve’s eye.  “Honey?  You okay?”
"Because as far as we know, the space phenomenon was a single occurrence, whereas in this case, our assistance is being requested by the head of state of another country," Fury said firmly. "Another country that might prove to be an invaluable ally if such another space phenomenon were to occur."
"Um… well… let me see," Tony said, his breath hitching on every word. "I think I remember you mentioning something about using your tongue the next time that we did this."
“Very good, sir.  I will inform them at once.”
"Well, at least it wasn't long enough to need another feeding tube," Tony said. "And Helen said you hit your head pretty hard, so—"
"I'll be waiting for your call, Mr Wilson," Stacy said, nodding in Sam's direction. "And I'll be ready."
"Tell you what," Helen continued. "I need to go and check on the setup for the operating room, so Tony, why don't you get Captain Rogers cleaned up while we're waiting?" She pointed to a small bathroom off of the examining room. "There's a basin and washcloths in there that you can use."
Tony thought bitterly.
“Okay, this is not good,” he whispered as he took another careful step, his jaw tightly clenched to keep his teeth from chattering.  Just as he’d feared, the loss of daylight had caused the outside temperature to drop like a rock, which meant he needed to find the bunker quickly, before he became hypothermic.
"Pete, I'm not gonna tell you that," Tony answered. "It's not something that you—"
A second later the repulsors fired, immediately sending Peter shooting backwards towards the bank of sharp rocks. He managed to adjust the course just before he would've smashed against them, but then shot straight up over the top of the row of buildings.
"We'd need to somehow get all of his medicines to her too," added Tony. "Pete's on a literal boatload of meds, so—"
“No, no, not quite like that,” said Peter.  “I asked him if he had a family, and he said no, but that he’d always wanted one.”
Steve flinches as Tony aims his repulsor at the window, its rising-pitched whine still a bit too close to the Red Skull’s HYDRA weapons for his comfort.  A second later, the window shatters, sending shards of glass everywhere as he takes off as fast as a bullet from a gun.
and… if JARVIS hadn't—if Peter hadn't created him, we—we would've—both of us, Tony, we would've—"
Steve's stomach growled then, a sharp reminder that he was once again late to meet his teammates for dinner. He glanced down at his abdomen, silently telling it that it was just going to have to wait a bit longer. He wasn't yet done.
"Yeah, hon," Tony said proudly. "That's exactly right."
"You're pretty perceptive. Aren't ya," he said quietly.
"Okay, but I'm not sure that a few FBI agents are gonna be enough against what I'm afraid we'd be up against," Tony said softly.
"Oh," Tony gasped as all the air whooshed from his lungs in one fell swoop. He squeezed his eyes closed, pressing his palm tightly to his chest as he tried not to give in to the tears threatening to fall. There wasn't a day that passed where Tony didn't miss Mr Jarvis so badly it was almost painful, and he knew that somehow Peter understood that, even though he'd never had the chance to meet him.
"Oh, I know it will," said Peter. Now that he was away from the prying eyes of his classmates, he felt could freely admit just how badly he missed his dad. "I miss him."
"Promise?" Steve whimpered, sucking in a shaky breath.
“That sounds awesome to me!” exclaimed Peter.  “I’m starving!”
that followed loud enough to turn Tony's stomach. Steve immediately cried out, shielding his bleeding nose with one hand while still trying to wrangle Peter with the other.
"Yes, yes, but he was victorious in his slashing," said Uncle Thor, raising his beer bottle. "Therefore he must be celebrated!"
said that my suit was—!"
"Hmm," said Tony. "Well, I can't say I'm specifically looking for that, but if it keeps Hulk from punching other people, or cars, or buildings that are filled with other people, then I'd say it's a trade-off that's decent enough."
Peter thought as he resumed work on his essay. There was no point in getting Dad's hopes up if it just turned out to be another dead end.
Tony had also placed the new locators in Peter's Spider-Man uniforms, even though they never left the Avengers' facilities. Tony's thought was that he could never be too careful when it came to protecting his boys.
"Y-yep," Dad said after a heartbeat's pause. "I mean, he's still in school so he's only like, part time. You know, like a nights and weekends kinda thing. But you've already seen him in action, so you know how good he is. And he's even got a uniform."
"Uh huh," said Peter. He watched as Grandpa struggled to get to his feet, swearing under his breath. "Be careful walking home, okay?"
Tony shuddered, sliding the glasses from Peter's face before burying his nose into his hair. "I know it is. But goddamnit, bud, do ya think that you and Papa could make it just a little less dramatic next time? I mean, geez!"
"So, my mom was asking if I thought I needed to buy a new shirt to wear to The Lion King?" Ned asked. "What do you guys think?"
“Yes, sir,” JARVIS said, not without a touch of sympathy.  “Render for the pharmaceutical printing device will be completed in approximately eight hours.”
As it turned out, they were arguing about the fact that Papa had asked Uncle Thor to basically smuggle Peter and Dad to Asgard if something were to happen with the government where he no longer felt that it was safe, and Dad was trying to convince him that there would be "no way in hell" that he would leave Papa to "fend for himself against a pack of rabid wolves", and that Papa just needed to get over his "goddamn 1940's sentiment" and agree that Dad would stay by his side.
“Language!” Steve calls over the comm without thinking.  “JARVIS, what’s the view from upstairs?”
"No problem, sir."
Dad's lips twitched as he glanced over at Papa, just for a second, giving him the 'it's-all-right-honey' eyebrow. "I don't see why not, bud. I'll tell Happy tomorrow morning to plan on having the guards available for the school, okay?"
Tony pressed his palm to his chest, the cool metal of Steve's dog tags against his scarred skin sending a light shiver down his spine. The fact that the drones had not only surprised HYDRA but also managed to scare them off couldn't be just a coincidence, and it also likely meant that wherever they were holding Steve was currently out of the firing range of the drones, both at the Tower and Compound and those mounted on the Stark Industries building in D.C.
"What, you don't think Rhodey could use some pointers?" replied Tony. "'Cause I've heard some of his sweet talk before—I mean, not
Draining the rest of the lukewarm coffee in his cup, Tony picked up his tablet again, looking back at the lines of code he'd been studying earlier.
"Nothing!" Peter squeaked. "I just really, really,
"'Cause I'm not the one that held a fucking blaster to your son's head, you got that?" Tony snapped. "So, if you would all please just circle up here, we can get started!"
"Babe?" he said, jerking his head towards the tablet in Steve's gloved hand. "What're we looking at here?"
Gulping, Steve nodded, wiping the grime and sweat from his eyes as he tried to think of what to do next.
"That's never going to happen, mo grá," Steve murmured. "I promise."
"Satellite deployed," Captain Barnes said a few minutes later. "Orbit unchanged."
"True. But still… something just doesn't sit right with me about HYDRA using these disposable soldiers. I mean, it's not that I can't see them doing it, but even if their only goal was to get at Pete, it doesn't seem right that they would try almost the exact same thing again after it didn't work the first time. They're smarter than that."
He started at Tony's neck, kissing and nibbling and caressing across his husband's beautiful olive-toned upper body, sucking marks into the skin below his collarbones and spending ample time on the kaleidoscope of scars marking the centre of Tony's chest, where the arc reactor had once been. Tony had never admitted to Steve that he was self-conscious of the arc reactor but Steve knew he was anyway, and had always taken special care to lavish attention to it, so grateful that it was able to keep the man that he loved alive.
Steve nodded into Tony's hair. Sam was smart to have called Tony with that particular question rather than Steve. "I know, sweetheart, and I'm okay. Really."
And for Tony, whose stomach currently felt like a giant ball of lead, it only served to strengthen his resolve.
“It’s not about the money,” Peter muttered, chuckling.  “It’s about sending a message.”
Peter shook his head, his curls flopping down over his forehead. "What are they saying?"
"That sounds reasonable," Nebula cut in. "Then I will begin work on reestablishing life support."
"Oh," Peter said, feeling like a fool as realisation dawned. Uncle Bucky had said something very similar to him not too long after that fateful dinner, and Peter had just brushed it off as yet another one of his old-fashioned ideas on courtship. But maybe… if he'd been right all along, that might mean…
That at least drew a small smile from Steve, and he turned, finally meeting Tony's worried eyes.
Peter smiled as he thought about Dad and Steve. If someone would've told him a few months ago that his father would meet and fall in love with an Air Corps pilot, Peter would've thought they were mad. But first impressions aside, Peter had quickly realised that Steve was the absolute best person his father could've chosen. Steve was kind, loyal, honest, and had told Peter over and over that he loved his father—and Peter as well—very much.
“Sir?” JARVIS asked.  “Sir, are you all right?  Your heart rate has just undergone quite a sharp increase, and—”
"Copy that, Steve," Natasha said. "Thor, meet me by the south side entrance to the Institute."
Tony sat back down at his workstation, pinching the bridge of his nose as he attempted to force his exhausted eyes to stay open. He had sent Bruce back downstairs when he started nodding off into one of his notebooks, but Tony at least needed to stay awake until Peter got home from the dance.
And never with Dad.  Dad has never liked swimming, probably because he’s too afraid for people to see him without a shirt on.
It was Brooklyn, the street where he had grown up. And according to the newspapers being peddled a few metres away, the year was… 1924.
"Benign! Homecoming!"
"Oh, not a goddamn chance. I mean, have you seen this guy?" said Tony, prompting peals of laughter that were just enough to help break some of the tension hanging in the air like a lead curtain.
Carol 'Avenger' Danvers. Although Tony felt a more apt callsign for her would be 'Angel'.
"By all means, Senator," said Tony. "Proceed."
Tony groaned in frustration, tossing a sharp glance at Steve over his shoulder. "Goddamn stubborn soldier."
"Mmm," murmured Tony. "Love you too."
"Huh?" said Uncle Bucky, his eyebrows knitting into a frown. "What the hell's that supposed to mean?"
"No," said Tony, probably a bit more harshly than was necessary when Phillips scowled. "No, Colonel, nothing at all."
"I guess I'll know it when I see it," Peter said softly. There had to be some clue he could find that would give away a possible location. Disrupted wind patterns, a break in a treeline,
"You've mentioned that a couple times before," he said, his fingertips tracing around Tony's engagement ring. "Can you tell me more about what you mean? How did Peter save you?"
"Maybe we should go shoot some hoops instead?" Bucky said as he jogged up next to Sam. "Let Stevie practise his half-court shots?"
"No, I am absolutely positive that I did not know that," she said. "And where in the world did you hear it?"
“It’s a good thing that Dad renovated all of the fume hoods last year, or else Brad could’ve burned down the entire school!” Peter said, his eyebrows so high they were almost touching his curls.  “I mean, what an idiot!”
"Nah, dude, you heard it right," said Chester. "Either that or I'm just as messed up as you are, which I will flat-out deny until my dying day, so—"
“Uh—uh huh,” Peter said.  He sniffed, his red-rimmed brown eyes glassy and exhausted as he leaned his head against Tony’s chest.  X-rays had shown that Peter’s pinky finger had suffered a break, but thankfully it was a clean break, requiring only a splint to keep it immobile for the next four weeks or so while it healed.
"Captain. You guys made pretty good time getting here," Hill said. Her eyebrows knitted together as she noticed Thor standing next to Bucky. "I don't remember you being on the guest list."
close to asking Steve to officially move in with them when Fury had contacted him with the mission.
“Think I’m gonna duck out for a bit too, I need to check in with my superiors,” Rhodey said as Sam and Bucky made a beeline for the door.  “I have a feeling there’s gonna be a few questions for me to answer.”
"Mmm. Deputy police chief, hmm?" Dad said, raising his eyebrows. "Well, I highly doubt that she's smarter than you, buddy, 'cause we all know that's impossible."
Peter's belly dropped to his knees. "Oh, crap."
"Wow," Tony said, his eyes wide. "So then, is there anything that you actually
Steve's shoulders dropped. "Tony—"
“Ah, what?” Obie said, his eyes going almost comically wide for a second or two before he was able to catch himself.  “What’re you looking into the drug trials for?”
"As he should," said Tony. "Don't forget to eat something."
And then Natasha, who probably kept the most busy of any of them. Not only was she trying to support Clint and Pietro through their grief while in mourning herself, but she was also assisting George Stacy with his law enforcement duties and maintaining a frequent correspondence with General Okoye down in Wakanda. The two women were discussing the possibility of setting up a new international cooperative agency that would work to seek out any new potential super-villains and snuff them out before they had a chance to gain enough traction to become menacing.
"Yeah, okay," Tony muttered. He huffed out a deep breath, trying to relax his tight shoulders. "Go ahead and try again."
Right now, it was Tony who needed him.
"Like where your mom and dad were from?" asked Tony.
"You should
"Mmm," Tony mumbled, followed by a series of coughs that were so guttural and soggy that Steve's stomach flipped. He quickly rolled Tony onto his back, nearly collapsing in relief when he saw that the arc reactor was still glowing its usual bright blue.
"I do believe that he believes so, sir," answered JARVIS.
"Yes. He refused to help them, said he would rather die first," Wanda said. "His parents were killed in a work camp during one of the last big wars, so… the thought of working for people like that, he just—he couldn't take it." A tear rolled down Wanda's cheek that she quickly brushed away. "He tried to escape here one night, but he—this place, there wasn't enough metal in it for him to be able to get out, not with me and my brother, so they caught him again, and—"
Someone that breathtaking deserved to be immortalised in as many different art forms as possible, especially when not even photographs were enough to do him justice.
Not one single time.
Thor let out a sigh, one heavy enough to make Steve shiver. "At the moment, Captain, I have no suggestions. Only that it is of utmost importance that we find out if Wakanda is home to another stone."
“Hey, Dad?” Peter asked as the elevator slid to a halt, startling Tony from his standing semi-doze.  He rubbed at his eyes, ignoring Peter’s pointed look as they stepped into the garage.  He didn't want to think about how many times Peter had tried and failed to get his attention.
"Well, so what if I have?" she asked. "She's a lot more interesting than Kurt Vonnegut, if I do say so."
A flash of movement along the far right side of the lake caught the corner of Tony's eye then—either a person or an animal, he wasn't quite sure—drawing his gaze away from Peter just long enough to miss him hitting the surface of the water so hard that the impact echoed across the lake. Tony cried out in panic as Peter promptly disappeared beneath the rippling water, with Steve releasing his rope only a split-second later to dive in after him. Tony immediately spun the boat around, nearly capsizing it when an eerie, ear-splitting cracking noise suddenly cut through the air, raising all of the hair on the back of his neck.
"It's not popcorn that I want at the moment."
He still couldn't help but notice, though, that while Rogers' expression still contained a measure of poorly-concealed suspicion, he at least wasn't shooting rockets out of his eyes anymore.
Tony snorted, feeling some of the tension in his shoulders start to seep away. "Oh, you think so?"
"Yeah, I copy."
Tears stung Peter's dry, scratchy eyes as he swallowed hard, trying to hold himself together. "But even if you could talk to someone in charge, are you sure you could even trust them?" he asked. "I mean, Dad's known the guy who took Papa away since he was my age, so—"
"Well, they've got twice the amount of trouble than Dad and I do," Steve said. "But Uncle Clint and Auntie Nat are definitely excellent surrogate parents. Nat told me yesterday that she got a call from one of Wanda's teachers, telling her how well she seemed to be fitting in with her class." Steve didn't add that hearing that news had brightened his entire day. After being held captive for months in the same HYDRA prison as Steve, he'd had some serious concerns that the twins would be able to easily rejoin society. He'd been especially concerned about Wanda, since she had been forced to participate in Steve's torture and had directly witnessed the death of her father at HYDRA's hands. She had even forced Peter to see some pretty horrible things after he infiltrated the prison, visions that still sometimes haunted him while he slept.
"May as well just keep going," Peter muttered. He reached for his bag of peanut m&ms, popping three into his mouth as he opened the next file.
"Redwing's just about done with his sweep," Steve answered, watching as various blinking green dots appeared across the screen, each indicating a perimeter guard for the base. Despite the massive size of the structure and surrounding outposts, which were easily twice the size of the bases they had just cleared out in Iceland, there weren't all that many guards.
"Oh my God!" Peter cried as yet another massive icy wave shot down his spine, nearly bringing him to his knees as he heard Uncle Thor's booming voice come through the portal, his tone indicating that he was out for blood.
Before Tony could say anything else, Steve slipped his fingers under his chin, tilting his head up and capturing his lips. Tony wound his arms around Steve's neck as his tongue swiped across Tony's bottom lip, asking for permission like the gentleman he always was. He whimpered as Steve's tongue plundered his mouth, teasing and tasting as one hand slipped underneath Tony's t-shirt, his blunt fingernails scraping lightly up his back.
"I don't want to be put under," Steve cut in, squeezing Tony's hand so hard that he popped two of his knuckles. "Tony,
"Wow," Peter said with wide eyes. "And I thought my house was nuts."
"So…" Tony said as he carefully cupped Steve's right cheek—the less beat-up side—as he regarded the overgrown whiskers covering the lower half of his husband's face. Steve had always hated having any facial hair; he'd always said that it made him itch something fierce.
"Why do you think I'm here?" Rhodey asked with a slight grin. "O'Brien's probably gonna call you tomorrow with the news, so you gotta promise me that you'll act surprised—"
"Six new aircraft just engaged from Meridia, Rogers," said Major Kowalski amidst another burst of gunfire. "We're still picking off most of 'em, but be advised that two of 'em are heading directly for you and Carol."
"I'm listening."
"Well," Sam said after a short pause. "Never a dull moment around this place, huh?"
"Hey, Петр," he said, fondly ruffling Peter's hair. "You doing okay?"
Steve laughed, the melodic sound sending another blast of warmth through Tony’s body.  “Well, based on what I’ve seen, I highly doubt that.  But if it’s any consolation, I still like hanging out with you.”
—face when he agreed to his invitation for the date, one of pure, boyish delight, amplified by the desire he'd noticed sparking in the handsome pilot's gorgeous blue eyes.
“Then I guess that’s my cue to say goodnight,” Steve says.  He offers Tony his hand, smiling shyly when Tony takes it.  His hands are a bit smaller than Steve’s, and sprinkled with calluses, probably from his work as a mechanic.
Swiping at his eyes, Tony pressed his palm over the arc reactor, trailing his fingertip down the chain holding Steve’s dog tags.
"You are
Thankfully, Ms Sharon was true to her word, only bugging Peter every couple of hours during the night while Grandma and Uncle Bucky caught up on their sleep, both of them exhausted from constantly having to deal with Peter's needs. But by the time the barest hints of light were beginning to poke over the distant horizon, Peter was struggling hard to keep himself going, his lungs so drenched that every single breath was a gargantuan effort, his fingers so freezing cold that he could barely feel them as they ceaselessly tapped against the keyboard.
"Always taking care of me," Tony murmured as he closed out his schematics and went around the lab, gathering up the six half-empty coffee cups that had gotten strewn about over the course of the day. He contemplated showing the proposal to Steve to get his opinion on it, but decided against it. Steve was doing so much better lately, Tony didn't dare do anything that might possibly set back that progress.
the target highlighted in a set of red crosshairs. "JARVIS? Give it everything we've got."
"And how did you go about doing that, exactly?" asked Tony, crossing his arms. "I thought your stupid Air Corps anti-gossip rule was supposed to prevent that kind of thing?"
“I love you so much,” Steve said as he captured Tony’s lips, the kiss wet and sloppy as the pleasure spiked and his strokes began to falter.  He wasn’t going to last much longer.  “Fuck, Tony, I need—I need you to come with me!”
"Well, I don't think being curious is a crime, Captain Rogers," Anthony said, and Steve could've sworn that he saw a hint of a smirk playing on Anthony's full lips. "But since we're still quite a ways away from dealing with anything out in space, I'm afraid not. This information only covers normal flight operations and is designed as an addendum to the flight materials that you've already received."
Not until he was absolutely certain that Peter would be okay.
If not even Tony can find a way out of their predicament, then things really are about as hopeless as they can get.  Which means in all of his hemming and hawing and second-guessing, Steve has completely missed his chance with him.
Amazing moodboard created by therollingstonys 💖
“Yeah,” said Peter.  “And I’m also thinking we should order from Antonio’s tomorrow night.  I can ask Steve what kind of pasta he likes before you pick us up.”
"Ow!" he said, the word ripping through his sore throat like a piece of jagged glass. He attempted to move his hand to rub at the bump, but his arm felt as heavy as a lead brick, and after two weak attempts Peter gave up, squeezing his eyes closed and willing the bright stars behind them to go away.
"I'm pretty sure I could never turn down an invitation like that," Steve answered, smiling as he pecked Tony on the nose. "Especially since the fella doing the asking is as handsome as you."
Tony increased the speed as he eased out of the first turn in their oval-shaped course, laughing as Peter ducked under Steve's rope and crossed over to his side. He was so enthralled with watching his boys that he didn't notice right away that the air temperature had suddenly dropped about ten degrees until they were rounding the second turn, heading back towards the dock where Peter was supposed to drop his ski.
"Yeah, I bet. And I thought my brothers were bad," said Gwen. She bit off part of a shrimp, chewing it slowly. "Speaking of my brothers, they keep asking me when you're gonna come over again. Especially Simon, he seems pretty smitten with you."
"Okay, but what happened?" Peter asked. "What's the emergency?"
"Not in any salt shaker that I've ever seen," Tony said with wide eyes. "But have you ever known Phillips to joke about something like that?"
"Yeah," Peter said with a light chuckle. He had often suspected that one of Dad's reasons for inventing JARVIS in the first place was so that he could have someone besides Peter to talk to that didn't constantly want something from him.
Tony didn't just look happy, he looked
Steve chuckled, leaning down to kiss Tony on the cheek. "Pretty sure Peter would end up being late for school, sweetheart."
"Mmm, fine," Peter grumbled.
"Yes, I mean hide," continued Dr Strange. "We should hide so that when Thanos arrives, I'm the only person he sees. The rest of you should be placed at strategic points so as to be able to launch the attack simultaneously."
Steve said on a gasp as Tony trailed his fingers up the inside of his thigh to curl around his cock, lying flush against his abdomen. Steve hissed, his back arching up off the bed as Tony began to stroke him, his lips teasing the sensitive skin of his thighs and pelvis.
"Then, I'll do it," Steve repeated. "This seems like a no-brainer to me."
But Papa was cut off by another repulsor shot, followed a second later by the sound of a hard impact, like he'd been slammed against the floor or a wall.
With a final kiss to Tony's forehead, Steve stepped into the hallway just in time to hear a sharp cracking noise followed by a startled, "Whoops!" that sounded all too familiar. Fighting the urge to chuckle, Steve was not surprised when he stepped into the kitchen to find Peter cleaning raw egg from the vent over the stove.
"We'll pick this back up in the morning, eh, J?"
"I'll be fine, JARVIS," he muttered as he swung his legs over the side of the bed and grabbed the headboard to get to his feet. He was still shivering, still shaking even harder than he had after he'd been immersed in the ice. "I'm just… gonna take a shower, and then go and check on Peter, and then—"
"It might not even be HYDRA, honey," Tony said gently. "But even if it was it would be a pretty bold move for them, especially after the disaster that was Project Insight. No, there has to be something else, something either so secret it's gonna be damn near impossible to find, or something so obvious it's gonna hit us right in the nose and then we'll spend a month or so kicking ourselves for missing it."
handle it—spiraling into a vicious whirlpool of alcohol, drugs, and sex—that he very nearly managed to get himself killed on numerous occasions before finally being pulled from the brink of destruction by Rhodey, his friend from university, who for some reason had decided to take Tony under his wing despite there being absolutely no benefit at all for him to do so.
Tony gave a nod. "As much as I can make it so, yeah."
"Yes, well, we prefer not to use that particular term around here," Hammer said, glancing rather nervously at the girl. He leaned forward, lowering his voice. "You know, since it kinda has a negative connotation to it." Then he clapped his hands again, causing both Peter and the girl to jump. "But anyway, I'm not here to argue semantics with a smart-ass teenager, of all people. What I'm here for is to—"
"Steve," Natasha said as she rushed forward from a nearby clump of trees, grabbing the shield from Steve's left hand just as he pitched forward, nearly slipping from James's grip. Steve grunted as he struggled to regain his balance, lifting his head slightly to meet her eyes, which were just as shocked and sorrow-filled as he felt.
"Then it's a good thing I like to see you wearing my clothes," he murmured. He planted an open-mouthed kiss right at Tony's navel, briefly dipping his tongue inside. "Tell me what you want, mo grá. Ba mhaith liom tú a shásamh."
"Yeah." Tony rubbed at his scratchy eyes as Steve got up from the bed, pulling on his t-shirt as he shuffled barefoot out of the room. His heart was still racing, with pain radiating from his left forearm up to his shoulder and across his chest, almost like he was being electrocuted. Helen Cho had explained that he had likely sustained some nerve damage the time he got knocked by the fighter jet somewhere over Afghanistan way back when, but Tony didn't have time to dwell on his pain now. He needed to get ready for what lay ahead.
"Yeah, I'm sure we will," Ned said with a grin. "Other than that though, it's been pretty boring around here. I was really looking forward to coming up to the Compound."
look that Tony had ever seen, complete with rapidly paling cheeks and an audible gulp.
Sam grinned as he fiddled with the edge of his napkin. "Well, I'm pretty damn lucky to have him too. Long as you don't tell him that I said anything."
"How much peppermint did you consume, Peter?" she asked, frowning as she listened.
"So he doesn't seem to be any worse for wear," Dad said as he checked his readings. He shot Peter a rather satisfied smile. "I think we did it, Pete."
"You just think you're the only one who's ever felt like this," Sam said with a knowing nod. "'Cause that's one of those things that no one ever likes to talk about when they're discussing PTSD. Or, post-battle stress, I guess that's the term that you'd be familiar with."
"I did indeed, sir. The diagnostic yielded no anomalies."
And now that he was back, Tony wanted to kick Thanos' ass all the way beyond the void, that empty space area out beyond the barriers between universes that up until a few weeks ago, he'd believed only existed in science-fiction movies.
"Bruce!" Steve exclaimed as Bruce stumbled forward, practically collapsing into Steve's arms. "What—what're you doing here? Where's Thor? And—and Loki? And the ship?"
“Ah, yeah,” he finally murmurs.  “Something like that.”
"Steve, Bruce's already spoken with M'Baku," James said. "From what he said, the entire royal family was snapped, so he and General Okoye, well… they've got a lot of their own stuff to deal with at the moment. We can talk with them again later."
"Shh, buddy, it's okay," Tony whispered, over and over as Steve curled his arms around them both, carefully blotting Peter's bloody arm with the bedsheet. "We've got you."
"Where are you taking him?" Tony asked quietly.
"Oh, dear gods," Tony rasped, his knees nearly buckling at the sight of their sweet, beloved son lying there, as pale and as still as death itself, his long eyelashes resting against his round cheeks and his skinny chest rising and falling with the measured breaths from the ventilator parked next to the head of the bed. Tears rolled down Tony's face as he reached a trembling hand towards Peter's forehead, brushing his downy-soft curls away. "Oh, my poor sweet boy, I'm so sorry. This isn't—I never wanted any of this to happen."
the middle of the night, and they did need to take Peter to school in a few hours.
"Uh huh." Peter's eyes swept across Tony's sleeping form and up to the screen lining the head of the table, which displayed Tony's vital signs. "Uncle Bucky and I are gonna play chess once I get back, and Shuri said she'd show me some of her stuff later too."
"Well, that's good," said Peter. "'Cause if we're gonna win this, then we've all gotta work together. Papa always says that a team can never win if the players are only thinking about themselves."
And then he had turned on his heel and walked out of Obie’s office, slamming the door behind him so hard that the wall had shaken.
"No, no, that's not it!" he cried as he locked his knees and elbows, trying to angle his upper body downward. He managed to get himself parallel to the water barely before he would've broken the top of the fog line, activating his parachute as a sort of makeshift flight stabiliser.
"Yeah, okay," he whispered. "Just… need to get my shoes on."
Dr Strange sighed as he raised his scarred, slightly trembling hands, his left hand embossed with a large, golden two-fingered ring. "I'm very sorry, young man, but I don't really have time to explain it any further at the moment. Now, are you ready?"
"Sure, that's fine," he said past the knot in his throat. "Do you know when they'll be back?"
"The suit's wrecked now anyway, isn't it? You sure saw to that," he grumbled. "Can I go to sleep now?"
“Ah.  Yeah, I guess that would make sense,” Tony said as he pulled into the Tower garage.  Rhodey had told him plenty of not-so-great stories about airmen getting hazed to the point of severe injury if their squads suspected them of being anything other than heterosexual, so he figured the other military branches had to be similar.
"Who the hell are you?" Tony snapped as the guy pressed a button on the side of his helmet, revealing his face. He quickly glanced at Steve, then at Tony, then at Peter standing in the background, his eyes widening as if in admiration.
Tony grinned as he imagined how hot Steve would look in Black Tie.  “Oh, you have no idea.”
Steve lets out a sort of morbid chuckle.  “You know, if you put half as much energy into finishing your part of that grant application we spent all of last week working on as you do trying to find me a date, we’d never have to worry about replacing worn-out equipment ever again.”
Ned scoffed, rolling his eyes. "I mean, my one uncle's a tax attorney, and my other one manages a Target out in Hawaii. Not exactly all that exciting, you know?"
"Well, I'm sure Pete could always give them a hand with their schoolwork if it comes down to it," Tony said, only half-joking. "Wouldn't wanna make Barton have to use his brains too much if it's too painful."
"Um… excuse me, Doctor, but do you have any idea why my dad and the others just up and disappeared? 'Cause it seems a bit weird, actually more like
Tony gave a firm nod. "Damn right."
"Well, well, well. Who would've thought that the infamous vigilante known as Spider-Man would make his way down here?" the man said, far too jovially for Peter's taste. He clapped his hands, rubbing them together like a child who had just been presented with a shiny new toy.
"Huh?" Peter said as Papa hurriedly left his room, returning a few moments later with one of Dad's old and ratty MIT hoodies.
“Mmm.  Okay,” Peter said, obviously unconvinced.  He tipped his bowl up to down the rest of the milk, running his sleeve across his mouth when he was done.  “I’m ready to go now.”
Tony gulped, his eyes glassy as he nodded, and he reached for Steve's ass as Steve slowly pushed inside him. He paused once he was completely sheathed inside, breathing in a few deep breaths and taking in the incredible sight, smell, and feel of his beloved. It was as though he and Tony had been made for each other, how well they fit together, and for Steve, who once thought he would never get to experience something as incredible as this, the first few seconds were always a bit overwhelming.
"Absolutely nothing at all, babe. You're just his papa."
"Oh," she said on a gasp, her hand reaching for him before abruptly pulling back. "Is—is it okay if I hold his hand, Captain? I promise I'll be careful, I just—"
"Really?" Peter said. "He's a pilot?"
Steve screamed inside his mind as Tony’s lips parted just enough for their tongues to touch, his blood sizzling like he’d just gotten caught by a tripwire.  He had never wanted anyone as badly as he wanted Tony Stark in that moment, but he also knew that they needed to wait.
"Gwen?" he called. "Let's get going, sweetheart!"
Which was just plain
"What did you just say?" Tony demanded, his blood pressure spiking. "'Cause it damn well better not be what I think I just heard!"
"And make sure that at least two are specifically assigned to Pete whenever he's out of the Tower, all right?"
Or eye-fucked, as Bucky so cleverly liked to say, something that Steve had witnessed between him and Sam more times that he cared to recall. Those two were definitely crazy about each other, as were Carol and her boyfriend, from what Steve had seen.
He looked positively debauched, and Tony was convinced there was not a more glorious sight in all the universe.
Not until Steve came along.
Now, though, it was like they were screaming at him, signaling him with flashing lights and blaring alarms.
Peter rolled his eyes. "Like either if you would let me leave without one."
"I know you do," Steve murmured. "But sometimes I just really wish that you didn't, 'cause this… this—"
"Dad, it's okay," said Peter. He held out his hand, stepping towards Strange. "My name's Peter, by the way."
“Tony!” Steve choked out, his fingers curling around Tony’s arm.  “Tony, what—what—?”
"Have you heard the new rumour going around?" the guy asked in the loudest whisper Peter had ever heard in his life. He glanced around, leaning even closer. "There's some people who think that the Avengers went back in time. You know, to fix stuff?"
Peter let out a soft chuckle at Dad's words. "Packs a wallop" was something he'd heard Papa say a ton of times over the years, but he'd never heard Dad say it until now.
"Die, space dogs!" he heard from somewhere off to his left, turning to find Bucky holding the raccoon by its scruff as they both shot with their rifles.
And what lay beneath those linens. His long, lean legs. His absolutely magnificent ass, so gorgeous it would make Michelangelo jealous.
"And—and Peter?" Steve asked as tears welled in his eyes. "Were you able to—"
"Yes, but when have you ever actually brought them to school?" Natasha asked. "By yourself?"
Stane,” he said.  “But I’d say there’s a difference between knowing someone and
Tony's heart began to thud. "Oh gods, Steve—honey, you don't—you don't have to—"
And every single night, with so few exceptions that Tony could count them on one hand, Mr Jarvis sat with Tony as he attempted to fall asleep, promising him over and over that no monsters were going to come and steal his heart away while it was dark.
perfect.
"Yes," she replied. "Along with Bruce, Bucky… and—"
is gonna care that much about what you're wearing." said Bucky. He stepped closer, waggling his eyebrows. "Especially since there's a chance you won't be wearing anything by the time the date's over."
“We will, Ms Mags!” Peter says as the tiny old lady heads towards the kitchen, a lot faster than anyone her age should be able to move.  As soon as Mags disappears around the corner, he leans closer to Tony, his sweet brown eyes filled to the brim with the concern that Tony always hates to see.
"Peter—" Papa started, his mouth snapping closed when Dad grabbed his hand.
I'd like to get to know him a bit more first!"
After zipping his backpack closed, Peter slung it over his shoulder and followed Tony out of the kitchen, stopping short right in the middle of the living room when he realised he’d forgotten his jacket.  After retrieving the jacket—and an extra pair of contact lenses, at Tony’s request—they piled into the elevator for the ride down to the garage.
Steve has had no business leading the Avengers on these raids.  Not when the need for them compromises him so badly.
Is it Ireland again? I'm assuming that you've already made plans."
"You're assuming right," Steve said firmly. "Keep on it. JARVIS?"
“You’ll come over again tomorrow night?” Tony asked, just as breathless as Steve.
Unfortunately, Steve had barely made it ten metres down the hall before he heard a familiar voice calling his name.
"No!" T'Challa screamed, bounding like a cat over to where the stone rested. "No, you cannot have it! That stone belongs to Wakanda!"
The last several months, however, were a very different story. For even when Tony wasn't in one of his deep, incapacitating depressive moods, he still hadn't shown any interest in doing anything beyond cuddling.
Bruce gave a somber nod. "Yeah. The theory is that by reducing the kinetic energy of atoms, it condenses them and makes them colder, which—"
"You're
It was still a bit unnerving just how quickly Steve was able to break down the iron walls Tony had spent years expertly building around his heart, beam by beam.  Their first encounter on the streets of Germany had been awkward as hell, not at all helped by the suit Steve was wearing, Coulson’s wet-dream version of Captain America’s old comic-book uniform.  Once he’d blasted Loki down, it had taken more of Tony’s strength than he’d cared to admit first to not laugh right in Steve’s face, and then later to keep his eyes from popping out once Steve finally removed the ridiculous-looking cowl from his head and Tony finally got his first good, long look at the living legend himself.
"How in the hell did you get back up?" he asked as he patted his shirt and pants pockets, looking for the damn comm device. He'd been right in the middle of another test when he'd apparently dropped off, but as far as he knew nothing had happened in the meantime, so—
"Breathe," Steve murmured into Tony's neck, his voice breaking and taking Tony's heart right with it. "Tony, I can't remember the last time I was able to take a real, deep breath. It's like my chest is constantly being squeezed, and all I can do is gasp. And then ever since the lake, oh God, I just feel like I'm
mention his name!" Tony snapped. He took a step forward, which immediately prompted the suit to Hammer's left to aim its repulsor at Tony's chest. "Steve Rogers has more honour in his left pinky toenail that you could ever hope to have in your entire life, so you just keep his name out of your filthy mouth, you got that?"
Steve planted a soft kiss on Peter's forehead, then pulled his blankets up over his shoulder, tucking them securely around his neck. He and Tony kept Peter's bedroom warmer than the rest of their apartment to help Peter maintain his body temp, but he still enjoyed being practically buried in his blankets while he slept.
"Steve?" Tony said as he touched down about twenty metres away, his voice laced with trepidation. "Honey, is he—?"
Peter looked away while Uncle Thor popped it in. He'd been able to handle watching Papa's foot surgery with no problems, but for some reason watching someone pop in an artificial eye tested the limits of his squeamishness, especially right after he'd just eaten three halves of a pizza.
Tony smiled softly as he glanced over at his husband, his breath hitching as he took him in. Steve's thick blond hair was tucked under a bright blue New York Mets baseball hat, and he was wearing the wire-rimmed, aviator sunglasses that Tony adored. That combined with the way his left hand was resting right at twelve o'clock on the steering wheel and the way the dimple in his right cheek was staring so boldly in Tony's direction that it may as well have been a flashing neon sign… it was taking entirely too much of Tony's willpower to keep his hands to himself so Steve could drive.
"Agreed," said Tony. "So… what're you guys up to, hmm?"
O'Brien tilted his head, his thin lips curling into a rather amused smirk. "Surely you know of whom I'm referring, don't you, Captain?"
"Good. Go ahead and start on the drone assembly then, yeah? I'd like to get those installed—"
"It is a stupid amount of work," Peter murmured, his pencil flipping around his thumb. "Which is why—"
“Sounds awesome!” Peter exclaimed.  “Oh, I can’t wait for this weekend!  It’s gonna be so much fun!”
"Steve?" Tony asked, his eyebrows knitting together. "Hon, I gotta say that you're starting to freak me out a bit here. What's going on?"
Steve gasps as the thought slips past the protective shield inside his mind before he can stop it, practically parading itself out in front of him and dancing a jig.  Steve has told himself multiple times that he needs to keep a lid on his personal feelings, needs to maintain the proper chain of command, or the team could fall apart at some critical juncture, but—
"What'd he say?" Tony cut in. "Steve, what—?"
"Oh no," Peter croaked as he tried to push himself up, rubbing at his eyes. "Why do you have to leave, didn't you just get here?"
Peter had meant his statement to be funny, but the frank words still hit Steve like a missile to the chest, something that didn't escape Peter's notice.
He had taken only one step towards the door when he felt Stacy's hand on his arm.
"Bed!" Tony finally gasped, just before Steve attacked his mouth again, kissing him like he was afraid it would be the last time. Tony let out another whimper as he clung to Steve's broad shoulders, forcibly trying to empty his mind of his worries so he could focus only on how Steve was making him feel.
"Eh, guess it's not too bad," Tony said to his reflection once he was done. He'd try to squeeze in a shower later, once the simulator sessions were done and before he headed out to visit Peter. The cadets' locker room was usually pretty quiet during that time of day.
"Tony, please!" Steve pleaded as he reached again for Tony's waist. "Please, why can't we just go back to bed? I think if we just—"
"You had to do
name one of his UIs after the man who had manipulated him, tormented him, and then tried to not only kill him, but also Peter and Papa more than once. There was just no possible way.
"Yeah. If nothing else, I think it would give Ma some peace of mind to know the truth. She deserves it."
But other than his cell and this massive arena-like area, he had no idea what the rest of the bunker looked like, or how much resistance he'd be facing if he were to break free.
"JARVIS, what time did the flight land?" she asked.
Uncle Bucky shrugged, his upper lip curling into a sneer as he glanced down at his left shoulder, and the arm that wasn't there.
Tony knew they still had a long way to go.  But at least now they were driving in the right direction.
"Daddy, please!" he whimpered. "Please, don't yell! I can't—I can't take it!"
"Gotcha, babe." Turning in his seat, Tony grabbed hold of both the steering wheel and the engine lever. "Here we go!"
"Oh God." Tony breathed in a shaky breath, still holding his forearm. "And yet you didn't turn him in?"
"The boy," the blue chick—her name had escaped Tony's mind at the moment—suddenly said, causing Tony to jump. Her voice was raspy, a bit like Natasha's except a bit more… mechanical-sounding.
—later. He removed his surgical cap, rubbing at his eyes under his glasses. "
"Uh huh."
"I'm afraid this one's going to need to be on an O2 mask soon," she had whispered to her medical student afterwards, once again completely disregarding the fact that Peter could hear every word she was saying. "And once that happens he'll need a feeding tube, which'll cost his father even more credits, and—"
“No, wait, Tony!” Steve yelps, his heart starting to thud as he takes off towards the building.  “We don't know what kind of defences they have inside the structure!”
“Damn, that’s rough,” Tony whispers.  “But if he was hurt, why the hell did he swim in the first place?”  Tony has never claimed to be an expert in sports, but he would think that no one in their right mind would push an athlete to compete through an injury.  Especially when swimmers aren’t getting paid like football or basketball stars.
Peter thought as he took a big bite of his pizza.  At least now he had something of his own to work on, something that wasn’t just yet another Lego set.
And—of course—the message light on his phone was blinking.
"Colonel Phillips believes that's a strong possibility," Uncle James said. "And that's all he'd say over the phone, so don't ask me any more questions 'cause I won't know the answers."
"'Cause we don't have that much of it," said Steve. "Just enough to power our X-302s and build the container. It's an extremely rare metal."
"That's part of the same long story as the rest, Buck," Steve answered. "One that I promise we'll tell once this is all over."
"I'm not seeing any remaining hostiles from up here," said Sam. "Cap?"
Tony thought as he let out a confused groan, one that grew instantly louder as he pulled onto the street and the bright morning sun hit him square in the face.
Steve sputtered out a laugh, very grateful that he hadn't caught Tony on one of his really bad days.
But it obviously wasn't yet enough, especially if this afternoon was any indication. Threats could be coming at them from any direction, not the least of which was from outside of Earth itself, and he needed to do all that he could to stave them off.
He had to admit that it was addictive, being desired that much. And the fact that it was Steve Rogers, a person who Tony had always said that he hated but now couldn't imagine trying to live without, somehow made it all that much more erotic.
Tony frowned, tilting his head as he regarded the glowing blue hologram hovering in the air in front of him. It was another suit, one that he and Bruce had designed specifically as an emergency backup to help bring down Hulk in case he ever decided to go rogue. They had started on the initial design drafts way back when Bucky was first brought to the Tower after the Project Insight fiasco, but with his and Steve's wedding, then their honeymoon, then their kidnapping by Obadiah and Aldrich Killian and the months-long hospital stays that followed, that particular suit got pushed to the back of Tony's "must-have" list.
being so sick. He
Besides, the sex he had with Steve was the best sex that Tony had ever had in his life. Even during their more frantic, make-me-forget sessions, Steve was still so attentive and passionate and loving that sometimes it was all Tony could do to keep from just melting into him completely. Before Peter was born, Tony had always thought himself to be too selfish to actually love anyone, and too self-loathing to think that anyone might actually want to love him. Sex for him was nothing more than a cheap thrill and a way to blow off steam, with little to no thoughts of developing any kind of lasting relationship. But after Peter came along, Tony's interest in sex practically evaporated overnight, with him indulging in only the occasional date or hookup until Peter's heart problem was discovered and he pretty much swore it off completely.
"Um, those things are still coming through!" Bucky said as he raised his rifle, picking off three of the half-burning war dogs in rapid succession. "We're not just gonna stand here and watch, are we?"
“Here you are, miss.  And thank you for coming in,” Steve said as he handed the lady her loaded-down shopping bag, filled with a complete boxed set of V.C. Andrews novels that Steve had had to special-order.
All the people who had been snapped—or presumed snapped—were there.
“Please!” Peter begged, his huge brown eyes filling with tears behind his wire-rimmed glasses.  “Dad, please!  You know how good I am with research and digging through stuff, so please!  Let me help!”
Without a microsecond's hesitation, Steve forced his body forward and grabbed onto Tony's left hand, any question he might've had as to why completely obliterated as he felt the stones' combined power began to transfer across their connected hands and into his own body.
"No," Steve murmured as he tucked a pillow under Tony's hips. "I'm gonna make love to you."
"Good," Nebula said before stepping over to where her sister lay whimpering in the dust. Crouching down, she grabbed onto Gamora's shoulders, giving them a gentle shake
"Yeah, thanks," Peter said, trying to smile. Of course the first time he was ever this close to a girl that he liked it had to be when he was so sick that he could barely walk.
"Good." Tony glanced up at the clock, rubbing his temples. "It's 2130 now, so I'm gonna give you another six-hour break, okay? We can talk again at 0330."
“Well,” Tony says a few moments later, his sharp exhales perfectly in time with Steve’s ragged pants.  “I know this probably isn’t the best time to mention this particular tidbit, but—”
Tony's jaw was tightly clenched as he crept along the side of the massive spaceship, trying to make heads or tails of its design. The inner circle was still spinning, as he could sense the vibrations through his armoured feet, which likely meant that it was tied into both the ship's artificial gravity and the life support system.
"Yeah, that makes sense," Steve replied. His own procedure had drained so much of the country's power that it had caused almost a three-day blackout, and that had been with the full approval of the government. There's no way Colonel Phillips would've been able to store enough power for Peter's use without being discovered.
“Yeah.  Okay,” Tony says.  Carefully, he places his hands on Steve’s leg, one on his ankle and the other just below his knee, bracing himself on one knee as he resumes his mumbling, his fingertips gliding up and down Steve’s leg, pressing lightly on various parts.
"I don't know, Steve. Things were a bit different back then, so maybe it's a newer thing?" said Bucky. "I'm sure your ma would know if you asked her."
Dad huffed as he released Peter, keeping one hand on his shoulder. "Pete was cold," he said, low and tight. "I was helping him to get warm."
"Yeah, man, I do."
"Hey, Peter," said Uncle Bruce, his glasses slightly crooked on his face and gripping the side of his arm. "How's it going back in New York?"
Except now, it was missing.
Then why don't you fucking enlighten me on what the hell it
"She'll be seventeen by the time she goes," muttered Peter.
"Barton, you and Romanoff take Stacy's team and search for Steve!" came the commanding voice of Uncle Sam, muffled through the thick glass—which obviously wasn't glass, now that Peter thought about it—of his cell. "And Tony, you and Rhodey work on picking off the rest of those flyers."
The thought of a fully-automated user-interface system is really,
Chairman Oklahoma gave a rather bored nod. "As you wish, Mr Stark."
His hair rinsed and conditioned, Tony turned in Steve's hold, pressing a light kiss to his stubbled chin as he reached for the soap bar so he could wash his husband's exquisite body, lingering on his gorgeous pecs and abs while Steve's intense blue eyes never wavered from Tony's face. It was something that Steve had been doing quite a bit ever since the battle down in Miami, as if he was afraid Tony might up and disappear if he happened to look away. His expression was a mixture of love, longing, and the tiny hint of disbelief that Tony knew still lingered in the back of Steve's mind, the disbelief that he had a husband and a son who loved him, something he never thought that he might actually get to have.
"Or not-so-presumed," said Tony. "They'd start with their definite enemies first, and guess who'd be at the top of that list?"
As he watches them go, with Tony’s arm draped protectively around his son’s shoulders, Steve looks down at his feet, shaking his head.
"Huh?" Peter said as his head snapped up again, blinking in confusion. "Oh, yeah. I guess I am kinda tired."
"Um… who's Ego?" Peter asked. "Is he another one of Thanos' guys?"
Peter thought in a panic. "Um… what do—um, what do you mean, you
Losing his virginity on the night of his senior prom was one of those experiences that Steve desperately wished he could purge from his mind.  Not even the hard slap across the face he’d gotten afterwards could compare to how fumbling and awkward he had felt, or how scared he’d been that he was somehow broken when it didn't turn out to be as mind-blowing as all of his friends had said it was.
“All readings are within normal parameters, sir,” said JARVIS.
Wars and conflicts weren’t just going to go away on their own, after all, and since the difference between war and peace often came down to whoever wielded the bigger stick, it was imperative that Stark Industries, the main weapons manufacturer for the U.S. Military, constantly came up with bigger and better stick designs to ensure that the military could always maintain the upper hand in whatever conflict occupied their attention at the moment.
"Yeah, you might've mentioned that a time or three," Tony said, rolling his eyes. "In the last sixty seconds or so. There! It's right there, right by your hand!"
Peter shook his head, internally knocking himself on the forehand as he fished his phone from the pocket, pulling up his Contacts app. "Oh, sure. That makes perfect sense."
Tony's lips twitched, his tongue poking out to wet them as he studied Steve's face, his expression slowly transforming into that self-loathing look that Steve had seen far too many times before.
“Hello!” Peter said, grunting when his voice jumped an entire octave on the ‘o’.  He gave his head a quick shake, trying again.  “I mean, hi.  Um… no, thank you.  I’m just here to look around… if that’s okay?”
"In a couple hours, bud," Tony said. "Long after you're asleep."
"But I take it the JAG office doesn't see it that way?" Peter asked.
Which meant that Tony had better make it a message worth listening to, if by some miracle Steve ever found it.
It wasn't enough time, but it was all they had.
Peter gulped, squaring his shoulders as he nodded. At least he'd remembered to bring his earplugs with. "Yes, that's right," he said quietly. "And my other dad is Captain America."
"We could bring them all home," Steve said as tears welled in his eyes. "Sam, and Bucky, and Wanda, and—and—"
"I'm good," Peter said automatically, frowning when Dad quirked an eyebrow. "Seriously, Dad, I'm okay. I just… really miss you."
"Got it," replied Fury. "Coordinate with Hill once you're on the ground, she'll put you in touch with Prince T'Challa."
"The hospital people are here now, buddy, and they're gonna take good care of you," he said. "I'll make sure of it."
“You sure five will work any better?” Peter asks.  Most days Dad doesn’t leave the shop until it closes at six, and he doesn’t like to ask Jimmy to close for him more than once or twice a week.
"Mmm," grumbled Tony. "You know how much I hate resting."
"Steve," James suddenly said from behind him. He must've been saying goodbye to Carol. "The device was loaded inside your aircraft before sunrise this morning along with all of your water and rations, so you're good to go."
"I fell one time when I tried to get up by myself," he said as he grabbed onto the rolling metal tree holding his intravenous drips and external oxygen. "Ended up pulling out one of my IVs, which was totally awful, so now they told me that I'm not allowed to get up by myself anymore."
"Mmm, all right," said Peter. "I am pretty hungry."
Suppressing a shudder, Peter stepped up to the window, placing his palms against it. The Hammer suits had all taken off after Dad and Uncle James, but just in the last minute or so he could hear them returning, apparently trying to track down the ground personnel still inside the building.
Steve's throat tightened, and he placed his hand gently on Peter's shoulder. "I'm sorry, Peter, but I do need to get going now. Is it all right if I come back tomorrow and see you again?"
"Tony," he said gently as he worked his hand underneath Tony's arm, giving him a slight shake when Tony didn't respond. "Sweetheart, come with me, okay?"
"So?" Peter snapped back. "I can't climb trees anymore! I can't help my dad build stuff in his garage, or even go outside, but that doesn't mean that my dads don't still love me!"
He couldn't imagine how difficult it must have been for Ma to discover Peter unconscious when she'd already been so worried about him being stranded in space, but Steve knew she would eventually be fine. Ma was one of the strongest people Steve had ever met. There were so many times when she'd managed to keep him alive using nothing more than her sheer force of will.
Steve thinks.
But since God or fate or whoever’s turn it had been to roll the cosmic dice that day had somehow deemed Tony worthy of becoming Peter’s father, then Tony was going to make sure that his precious son had everything that Tony could possibly give him.
"Okay, and those combined with the Mind Stone make three," said James. "So where are the rest?"
kisses that curled Tony's toes and left him whimpering.
Steve glared in Bucky's direction as he grabbed his bar of soap, running it across his chest. "What's that's supposed to mean?"
"Oh gods, buddy, I'm sorry," Tony said. "I shouldn't've snapped at you. But here I've been thinking this whole time that you and Steve didn't even know each other and it turns out that you've known him even longer than I have, so you'll have to forgive me if I'm just a bit confused as to what the hell's going on."
"Oh, I don't think he ever really thought that," Gwen said with a soft laugh. "Not really. I think maybe part of it was he was still pretty new to the precinct back then and still trying to establish his authority. But anyway—"
"Nah, Steve, we'll all pitch in and cover for you guys," he said. "Go on and see your kid."
"Oh gods," Tony murmured as he scrabbled with Steve's t-shirt, finally ripping it over his head and launching it across the room. He searched the floor for his clothes, finally locating them halfway under the bed and nearly tipping over in his haste to snatch them up. His chest was so tight he could barely breathe, his limbs barely functional as he tried to push his legs into his pants and locate the fucking arm holes on his shirt, not even caring as he jammed his feet into his shoes that in his haze of betrayal and rage he'd managed put the damn thing on backwards.
He broke off, shaking his head as he pulled up the bill's text with the offensive sections already highlighted, and handed it to Papa.
Gwen dabbed at her eyes, sniffing. "Oh, I know that. I still begged him not to go, even though deep down I knew that he would anyway." She let out a sort of morbid chuckle, shaking her head. "Peter loved being Spider-Man. He loved being a superhero and training with the Avengers, but he loved you and Mr Stark and the rest of his family more. And—and maybe even me, 'cause he said so right before he left, and—but anyway… That's the real reason why he left the bus. He wasn't trying to be a hero, Captain Rogers. He was just trying to keep the people he loved safe."
"Ah, maybe Obie hired him," he added. "Like I said, I'll take a look and let you know if I find anything wonky."
“Thanks, Miss Potts,” Tony said, smiling softly.  “I appreciate that.”
And if how Peter was acting was any indication, Tony was enjoying himself just as much.
"That is correct, sir, but it was not Mr Beck who accessed the server on that date. It was instead accessed by an as-yet-unidentified third party."
Besides that, it was a lot more comfortable to eat at an actual table than it would've been in Tony's tiny office. Steve had been forced to sit on the less messy corner of Tony's desk while he'd worked that afternoon, going over the previous day's X-302 reports and inputting the rest of Peter's JARVIS updates.
over and over and over again.  Despite being aware of exactly what was going to happen, he found that he couldn't seem to escape, could only watch in horror as the ice formed over his head, sealing him in.  By the time Tony had been able to wake him, he could barely remember where he was, writhing and panting and covered in sweat, his lungs like frozen blocks of ice in his chest and his hands full of the tattered remains of the sheets.
"Maybe not, but that doesn't mean they aren't correct," Tony said, frowning. "And since when do you discount your own suspicions?"
“Uh huh, it was okay,” Peter answered, frowning.  “But it sure doesn’t look like yours was very good.  What happened?”
“Is it okay if I visit that bookstore again on Monday?” he asked.  “I didn't really get a chance to look around that much.”
Maybe that's why they were so determined to recapture him, to experiment on him to try and figure out how he had been able to resist their conversion procedures.
be able to handle it.
"Oh, thank you, Mr Stark!" Ned said with a wide smile, adjusting the brown fedora perched on his round head as he and Peter climbed out of the car. "It gives me confidence!"
"All right," Tony said as Steve noticed Major Kowalski arriving inside the anteroom, taking the last available chair next to Ma, who was holding onto Bucky's hand.
"My last name's Quill," Blaster Peter said, puffing out his chest. "I'm also known as Star-Lord, as you've probably heard."
"Yeah, I'm not surprised," Steve said. He tapped his fingers idly against his shield as he thought. Tony was right in that it seemed far too convenient for this all to be just a coincidence, but even that didn't mean it absolutely couldn't be. And if Thor's vision was correct—which he kept insisting that it couldn't be wrong—then his team needed to keep their focus on that.
"Yeah, a bit." Hill jerked her head in the direction of an armoured truck parked off to the side, leading them inside and tapping a large viewscreen, on which a glowing yellow map appeared. "From what we've been able to discern based on forensic evidence, this attack was not designed to take out the Wakandan king. In fact, we're now doubtful that the perpetrators even knew he was here."
Tony thought, straightening his back.
"Um… yeah," Peter said, clearing his throat. "Um, this afternoon Gwen asked if I wanted to come to her house for dinner sometime, she said her mom wanted to meet me. She actually asked if I could go tomorrow and I told her that I couldn't since you guys weren't home, but… would it be okay if I did?"
Peter gave a nod. "Almost, just got a bit of history to finish with Papa after dinner. He asked me to wait so he could do it with me."
Peter shook his head in disgust. "I can't imagine being that… cruel."
“It’s not bragging if it’s true, Pete,” Tony said firmly.  He shot Steve a wink that went straight to his crotch.  “Kid’s so good he could join the championship circuit if he wanted to.”
“Thirty minutes,” Steve whispers as he drapes his towel across his neck and gathers up his warm-up suit.  Thirty minutes gives him just enough time to do a quick cool down and talk to Phillips, who no doubt will have a few somethings to say about his race.
Designing weapons.
"That's 'cause you're a physics whiz, Pete," Tony said as Peter scrambled onto the porch and lunged for his cup of hot cocoa sitting next to the fire pit. "There's no other way anyone else could hit a speedster with a snowball. Uncle Bruce would be proud."
Digging his heels against the wall, Peter leapt onto probably the last intact chair, pausing only long enough to catch his balance as he jumped towards the broken wall next to Chief Stacy, grabbing onto his arm and hauling him up across his shoulders into a fireman's carry. Peter could feel the man's breath on his neck, so he knew he was at least still alive, but Peter also knew that the air was getting dangerously thin with the continued fires, and his mind was still sluggish from the unfinished trigger words.
Steve glanced over at Tony, giving him his
"Please, don't hurt him! Please don't hurt my son!"
He managed to swallow the rest of his sentence before it escaped from his mouth, not wanting to upset Dad more than he already was. He had already lost a bunch of weight since Papa had been gone, his eyes were red-rimmed and puffy, like he'd been crying, his face was scarily pale under his overgrown facial hair, and Peter knew that he hadn't slept more than a few minutes in the last several days. And he'd only gotten that because Uncle James had threatened to knock him over the head if he didn't sit down for awhile.
Sucking in a slow, deep breath, Steve picked a yellow splinter of pencil out of his palm before nodding, carefully closing his notebook.
"Mmm," muttered Steve. Asking his ma questions about either money or Howard Stark was usually a recipe for disaster. "Yeah, I guess. I just… those kinds of conversations don't ever go over very well."
"I saw all of it," Steve said, a wide grin on his handsome face. "Looks like you did it, sweetheart."
Peter shivered, burrowing even further down into his hoodie as he checked his phone and huffing in frustration when he saw that he still had around fifteen miles to go.
"Yes, sir," Steve replied. "My name is Steven Grant Rogers, and my date of birth is July the fourth, nineteen hundred and eighteen."
Steve attempted a smile. "No, I'm pretty sure that honour goes to Clint. In fact, I think he would insist on it."
"Nah, it can't be just a coincidence," said Sam. "Based on what we know about the Wakandans, this smells more like an assassination attempt to me."
"Peter," Ms Sharon said sternly. "I am positive that no one has asked you to do what you're doing. Have they?"
down out of the sky during their battle, Tony wasn't shocked to see that the ship had been hit in the fallout.
“Well… okay,” he said, in that smooth, smarmy voice he liked to use with reporters.  “Um… while I’m not quite sure why Tony felt the need to parade all of you gentlemen in here, it was nice to meet you.  However, if you’ll excuse us, Tony and I do have some private business to discuss—”
And now Peter was getting ready to give Dad even more to worry about.
"I really hate to do this," Steve said after he'd reluctantly checked his timepiece. "But I've gotta be up in a little over four hours, so—"
"Whoa," Bruce said under his breath. "That's—that's—"
“I am so glad you asked me that, Mr Chairman.”  Tony smiled as he pulled up the specs of Stark Industries newest tablet design, one that Tony had no doubt would revolutionise the industry and cause far fewer casualties than any of the missiles he used to design.
And the way Peter saw it, he could either call his dads and have them call in the team to stop Mr Toomes and whatever he was planning and turn it all into a huge production, or he could take care of them himself and finally prove to his dads that he no longer needed their constant hovering and supervision, and that he was worthy of being a superhero in his own right.
Holy shit, Pete, don't you realise how worried Papa's gonna be now?"
Or at least not an answer that didn't sound childish or petulant, and the last thing that Steve wanted was to appear childish or petulant in front of Colonel Phillips. Not when there was a very high chance for him to become one of the first Langarans to ever fly in space.
"Then I will be sure to go for the head," Thor said firmly. "And I assure you, Rabbit, I will not miss."
"I never wanted to presume," murmured Steve. "I know how much you love him, Tony, and I never wanted you to think that I was trying to intrude on anything—"
Peter felt his cheeks flush hot. "Yeah. I guess I am."
“Yes, he damn well could’ve helped it, Pete!” Tony snapped.  “And I don’t care what he meant to do, all I care about is what he
“I need you to write up a press release for me,” he said.
And while the computer was so old that it took almost five minutes to completely boot up, it was at least better than nothing.
"You need food," Nebula said as she stepped onto the ship, guiding Gamora by the hand.
"I don't know, Tony," Howard said quietly, his shoulders sagging as he suddenly aged twenty years in less than three seconds. "I wasn't exactly keeping track."
“Honestly, Cap, I don't know at this point,” Tony says with a frown.  “But I can’t imagine that Strucker would just take off without the thing either, so if I had to guess, I’d say that Strucker probably took off as soon as the alarm went off.
Twenty-eight years of complete control over the country's news outlets, television programming, and literature.
"Yeah." Tony would have far preferred to have gone over the calculations with Bruce one final time before starting in on the render, but seeing as how Bruce was offworld with Thor and Loki,
“Yes,” Pepper said, not without a touch of sympathy.  “I’m sorry, I tried to tell him that you weren’t in yet, but I’m afraid he insisted.”
Peter's heart leapt into his throat. "That we know of," he repeated. "But what if—"
(See the end of the chapter for
Little Steve shook his head, nearly dislodging his too-large newsboy cap. "
"James, are you okay?" Steve cried as he quickly scanned for Pietro. "Do you need evac?"
"Catastrophe, gentlemen, on a level simply impossible to quantify," he said. "This is why we must find out all that we can, and we must do so as soon as possible."
“Okay, so… we just station Barton up in a tree by the tower and let him pick ‘em off, two by two?” asks Tony.  “Seems simple enough.”
bedroom, at that—and not had the urge to run screaming from it as soon as he came to his senses.
Would Steve have been as gung-ho to join the Army if his ma had still been alive when Pearl Harbour was bombed? He supposed there was no way to know for sure.
"Thor? Why Thor?" Steve asked. "You think these dreams have something to do with the infinity stones?"
"As long as it's okay with my dads."
"No, it's not okay, and I need you to understand this." Steve brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing his finger over his wedding ring. "I love you, and if I've ever made you feel like all I'm doing is—is using you to help myself feel better, then that makes me a lousy husband, and—"
Well, it was something Steve would do. Apparently he really was flawless.
"Oh, Jesus, Steve, what the hell was all that?" he cried.
"Then how come none of my doctors ever told my dad about it?" asked Peter. "It has to be a lot cheaper than all of my inhalers and stuff!"
He didn't have much time left.
It was 825pm when the lights dimmed and the music slowed to a ballad. Peter gulped as Gwen gave his arm a light tug, relieved when he noticed Betty hurrying towards Ned from across the gym. At least they would get one slow dance in before he had to leave.
“Goodnight, Tony.”
"Grandma had to help me with my tie," Peter added as he tugged on his silky-soft, royal purple tie, the very same tie that Dad was set to wear. His suit was the same as Dad's as well, a beautiful charcoal grey colour, and designed by the very same tailor who had created the Air Corps dress uniforms.
He needed Steve, just like he knew Steve needed him.
Unfortunately, now that the nanites were at least somewhat perfected, Tony felt that he'd fallen so far behind on building more of his regular suits—and relying far too heavily on the drones—that he needed to make up for lost time. Hence, turning his attention back to his Hulkbuster armour, the suit that Bruce had for some reason dubbed, Veronica.
set was going to have to dethrone at least one of them.
"Oh, you're really not okay," Gwen said worriedly as she wrapped her arm around Peter's waist, trying to help support his weight. "Did you already call your dads? 'Cause I know you said they were gonna pick you up, but you probably should—and Mom was wondering if she should call an ambulance or something, so—"
“Most?” said Tony.  “Don't you mean ‘all’, buddy?  I can’t remember the last time that Rhodey even came close to beating you.”
A list that nearly caused him to choke on his own spit once he finally found it.
good.
to. And Peter was going to find it.
I just want them erased from my mind, but they just won't go away!"
"Like a souped-up version of the trigger words," Peter mumbled. He let out a hard shudder, fatigue pulsing through his body with every beat of his heart. His legs felt like jello, his head was pounding, and his vision was so wonky that he could barely keep his eyes open.
And he was
"No," Steve repeated. He stepped back, leaning against his tall supply counter and crossing his arms. "Now, can you tell me how long it'll take to get the security drones up and running?"
“Jesus Christ, Pete,” Dad muttered, probably rapping his fingertips on his desk.  “All right, fine.  If you can’t bring yourself to just sit tight for an hour, then I guess it’s okay.  Long as you only go there and back, you got that?”
It was revolting. Almost as gross as the old man passed out cold on the couch, a tipped-over highball glass barely caught in one hand.
"Diagnostic found no errors, sir," said JARVIS.
Tony's beautiful brown eyes were shimmering with unshed tears as he shook his head. "Nope," he said. "It didn't pass."
Steve's legs were aching, his eyes stinging with the sweat pouring in rivulets off his forehead as he rounded the corner towards the barracks at breakneck speed. The still-rising sun was directly in his eyes, and he squinted as he lowered his head and pumped his arms, trying as hard as he could to stay ahead of all of the disturbing thoughts that had been chasing him ever since his rather tense discussion with Colonel Phillips the previous evening.
"Nuh uh," Tony cut in. Steve had already tried to convince Tony that they could just go out to a pub or something in Brooklyn to celebrate their anniversary, but Tony wasn't having it. "This is a special occasion and you're more than worth it, so just hush, yeah?"
"Well, all right then," said Phillips. "Just be aware that not all of us are as bad as you think."
Tony moved closer, keeping his eyes locked with Steve as he retracted his left arm gauntlet, showing Steve the wedding ring that he'd placed on Tony's finger over two years ago.
Steve grunted as he kissed him again, settling back on the bed with Tony on top of him and drawing his t-shirt up over his head.
"Oh?" said Davis. "And how exactly would you classify them?"
"Exactly."
Steve's belly gave a nervous swoop as he glided his hands down the smooth skin of Tony's back to his still-clothed ass, pressing him against him. He knew Tony would gladly give him anything he asked for, but it was still sometimes difficult for him to be specific, especially when it came to sex.
"You just… what?" Tony asked. "What're you worried about?"
Peter huffed, the effect of his attempted glare lessened by the fact that his eyes were bruised and bloodshot and both of his cheeks were scratched and bleeding. He looked like he could sleep for a week, and most likely would once he got cleaned up and ate something.
“P-Peter,” he stammered.  “I—I’m so—I’m so—”
Growing up without a father because of Howard Stark.
"Holy shit," Tony breathed, his eyes briefly fluttering shut. "So then you've pretty much decided that being sneaky is the only way we're gonna be able to do this."
"Mmm," Steve murmured as he opened one sleepy eye, his hand splaying across Tony's lower back. "G'morning."
A lot can change in ten years’ time.
"Well… yeah, that is part of it," Ned admitted. "You know my mom just likes to know what's going on, so…" He gave his head a quick shake. "Anyway, she told me that one of her friends was walking in the city on Saturday afternoon and saw Dr Stephen Strange go into a comic book store."
"And Tony," said Steve. "You should watch the two of them sometime when they're working together. It's like they're speaking a whole different language."
But he didn't dare say that out loud. He had not taken the news of Gwen's upcoming summer internship well at all, and while he had apologised to her multiple times since then, he still felt guilty about not being more supportive.
"And I only mean in like 'now' terms, all right?" added Rhodey. "Something tangible I can actually provide for you that might help?"
He had obviously overcorrected in his course calculations, something both he and Bruce had anticipated might happen given that this was just the initial run-through. But as the realisation of what he was looking at washed over him, Tony couldn't help but believe that something other than science was at work here.
Steve thought.
That he'd
Grandma attempted a smile, which came out looking like more of a grimace as she stepped into the room, her eyes flicking over to the datapad.
"I just—I just needed to pee."
Happy Thanksgiving to all of my American readers!  I hope your holiday is safe and wonderful!  💖
“I’m pretty sure that’s what we’ve been doing for the last eighteen or so years,” Tony answered.  “Or haven’t you noticed?”
But he wasn't about to wake Steve up over something as trivial as a school field trip. He and Steve had already decided that despite their own fears, they were going to try and keep Peter's life as normal as possible, and Tony supposed that included school field trips to boring art museums.
"Yes, and I've already spoken with Bruce and asked if you could start a couple hours later," Steve said gently. "And he said it was fine."
"Mmm, I love you too." Tony tipped his head up, kissing the sensitive spot on the underside of Steve's jaw, grinning as he shivered. "Please, be careful, yeah? All you guys? There's no telling what you're flying into, so—"
Tony scoffed, his hand still clutching Steve's. "Did you seriously just say 'hitherto undreamt of'? Who are you, some Shakespeare wannabe?"
“You just thought you’d try and help out a guy you barely know,” Tony said.  He reached over, patting Peter on the knee.  “‘Cause that’s what you do, yeah?”
"Sir Buchanan?" Bucky said as Natasha let out a snort of laughter. "Where the hell did that come from?"
"Oh, you know. Hanging in there," Tony replied, ignoring the stab of pain piercing his heart. "Not much else he can do."
"I'm not gonna let it happen," he murmured under his breath, a bit too loudly when Papa turned towards him, one eyebrow raised in question.
"Were you the person he was trying to contact?" Natasha asked.
"He has had it pretty easy this year," Tony added. "Usually he's out three or four times a winter with some respiratory crud or another. Maybe puberty's actually agreeing with him. It seemed to cure his eyesight, so why not his lungs too?"
"Pete?" Tony cut in.
"Good," Colonel Phillips shot back. "Then I highly suggest that you pay attention."
—to be thankful for it.
“Nice shot, Tony!” Clint yells as Tony passes over their jeep.  “Thanks!”
"Steve… honey…
The short pause that followed told Tony all he needed to know.
"C'mere," Tony murmured as he reached for his worried husband, curling his arms around Steve's trembling shoulders and pulling him close. Steve's breaths were coming in short, shallow gasps, and his heart was thundering in his chest like a galloping racehorse.
Yet another thing to tweak with his armour.
If Steve thought the sound of his leg breaking was horrifying, the sound of it popping back into place is about a thousand times worse.  The slide of the jagged ends of the bone against his bruised and bleeding skin accompanied by the hair-raising
, Howard, and that is something that I will never, ever forgive you for. Not ever!"
“You may not have meant to… whatever the hell that was.  But you do need something.  Something… more,” he said, his voice so low and flat that Steve’s felt his heart shattering in slow motion.  “Something more than we can give you, and I—I just can’t watch you self-destruct anymore.  I just can’t do it, Steve.  Not after this.”
be fine. We'll drop him off at the party and then we can go sit at a Starbucks or something and wait till it's time to pick him up."
The frantic edge in Peter's voice caught Tony off guard, and he sat up straighter in his chair, scowling.
"Nope. They'll go to the poor losers who couldn't cut it for the test-flight program," Steve said with a grin. "Which, by the way, wasn't us."
"No, I can talk to her," Peter said with a sigh. "Can you put her through to my tablet, please?"
"Wow," Tony said. "They're moving kinda fast, hmm?"
"Mmm, if you say so," Steve said warily. He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "I don't know, Tony. I can't shake the feeling that by trying to protect him, I'm somehow pushing him away."
"Rogers," answered Mr Muscles, proudly squaring his shoulders. "Captain Steve Rogers."
"Steve," Tony said, brushing his fingers across his lips. "Just… stop, okay? I shouldn't—I shouldn't've said that, and I—"
"Just don't want anything bad to happen to Uncle Bucky, Dad," Peter said. "He's already been through enough crap for three lifetimes, don't you think?"
Of which Scott was, as his position as a cyber-security consultant was still active.
"Tony, I'm gonna—I'm gonna—" Steve choked out, his breath hitching as Tony slid his hand underneath Steve's ass, squeezing it before trailing his fingertips along his crack. "Tony, I'm gonna come!"
With three Stark men all living under one small roof they definitely needed the peace, and lately Tony had just been too exhausted to put up much of a fight.
Carefully Steve leaned over him, brushing the mass of thick brown curls off his forehead before gently kissing him, the feel of Peter's slightly cool skin reassuring him that yes, he was in fact all right.
Tony shrugs, but Steve can’t help but notice the gleam of pride hidden in his eyes.  “Yeah, well, you're not exactly one of my holograms, right?  So I’m just triple-checking a couple of things here before I…”
"A kid who can lift a car with one hand, Tony, and you know it," said Rhodey. "And a kid who's even smarter than you, so while I'm not saying that we should just sit around here and do nothing, I think we should be cautious about following him right away because the last thing we want is for HYDRA to see where we're headed and either be waiting there to take Peter out, or move Steve somewhere else and bust the whole damn thing." Rhodey got to his feet, placing a hand on Tony's shoulder. "He's your kid, Tony, so you know him best. What do you think he's planning on doing?"
"Sam, we need to figure out where these guys are coming from," Steve said as he stood back up, scanning the smoke- and debris-filled area. "There's gotta be some kind of centralised area that they're working from."
"Now wait just a damn minute here!" retorted Sam. "I'm pretty sure that I never said anything about paying for all of—"
"No, he knew better than to mention that name in front of my ma," said Steve. "All he told me was that I was damn lucky I was my papa's son 'cause there'd be no chance in hell I'd be there otherwise, and that it was going to hurt. I never found out where it came from or who developed it."
"Sounds good, Phoenix Three," said Tony. "Everything looks fine from here."
"I need some air," Peter suddenly said, standing to his feet so fast that he jiggled the coffee table housing the game, causing it to scrape across the wood floor and send an eerie shiver down his spine. Peter shivered again as his arms pebbled with goosebumps, and he wrapped his arms around his front, glancing down at Gwen and hoping she'd understand. "I'm okay, I'll—I'll just be back in a bit."
Steve stopped him with a firm kiss to his lips, just long and exaggerated enough to make Clint groan. "Hey, sweetheart," he said, rather impishly. "Wanna get a room?"
"Yes," answered Tony. "Yes I am."
"There's no telling," said Bruce. "But I'm guessing it'll be soon. Like, really soon. And if he manages to get his hands on all six stones, then—"
"Pardon me, sir?" JARVIS asked, startling Tony so badly that he nearly fell off his chair. "I didn't quite catch that?"
"So antsy," Steve said, just before capturing Tony's mouth again. Steve loved kissing Tony, loved the feel of their lips and tongues sliding against each other's and the little whimpers that Tony made whenever Steve cupped his cheeks with his hands. They kissed until they were both out of breath, panting as Steve broke away to kiss and nibble his way across his husband's—his
“Mmm,” Dad muttered as he nearly dropped his phone again.  “I was under the impression that the entire point of this conversation was to ensure that you
They were mostly silent as Peter drove to Gwen's house as slowly as the traffic laws allowed, pulling up to the curb in front of her walkup about fifteen minutes later. Tears welled in Peter's eyes as he put the car into Park and reached for Gwen's face, drawing her close for a kiss.
No wonder Colonel Phillips had been so sure to inform Steve that his new class was being taught by a civilian. Phillips had flown with Steve's papa, had been one of his wingmen during the very battle that had taken Joseph Rogers' life, and had also been given the unenviable task of breaking the news of his death to Steve's ma.
He hadn't felt that physically attracted to someone in… well, he supposed ever.  Steve was no stranger to lust, or to hiding it.  As a gay man serving in the Army Special Forces, he had perfected the art of keeping his wandering eyes to himself out of both necessity and to maintain the proper chain of command, but this went far beyond that.  He felt, for lack of a better term, like he had just been ambushed.  Only this time, instead of being forced to dig for survivors in the resulting rubble, it was like he was searching for his heart instead.  The heart he had slowly buried over the last twenty years.
Now that Ned had brought him up, though, Peter had to admit he was pretty curious as to what the former surgeon had been up to in the last several months.
"You can get out now too, sweetheart, if you're tired," Steve said once Natasha and Bruce were gone. "I'll stay with him."
"Pardon me, sir, Captain," he said. "But Master Peter is inquiring if everything is all right?"
"Not that I know of," said Gwen. "I mean, I'm sure one could come through without people knowing, but don't we usually hear about it if they're expecting one?"
"Steve," he said softly. "It's nice to meet you."
Good thing Bruce was used to it by now.
"It was?" Peter asked. "But why would the Air Corps pay for a private wedding?"
"I promise. As soon as I find Pietro, I'll come and help you."
"Steve, I just want
"Well, it's about time there, Casanova," Uncle James said as soon as Peter slid into the backseat. "Did you forget we were here or something?"
Fury shot him a deep scowl. "Yes, Tony, something like that. And if that were to happen, then SHIELD and the Avengers would be able to coordinate with the Wakandan government to ascertain the best type of response."
Static burst across the comm, raising all the hair on Tony's arms until he heard Steve attempt to clear his throat.
Peter gave a small nod, his brown eyes cast downward. "I wish Papa was here."
"Oh?" Steve said. "And I'm guessing that it worked?"
"Not yet. Thought you'd wanna know first."
Steve glanced over at Bucky, quirking an eyebrow.
"Uh huh. Thanks."
After however many hundreds of hours of work by both Tony and Peter, Project Phoenix was as ready as it would ever be.
"I dunno, maybe he thought it wasn't that big a deal?" said Peter. "I mean, Mr Stacy is just a regular cop, and Liz was Gwen's friend too, so maybe the FBI agent just thought he was doing Mr Stacy a favour."
Peter watched as Gwen's shoulders dropped, and she nodded, gently patting Peter's shoulder. "One of the other officers already called my mom, and she's trying to find someone to watch my brothers so she can get to the hospital."
Tony dropped his head, chuckling as he set his stuff back down on the counter. Of all the days for Steve to go running late…
Natasha's concerned grey eyes flicked between Steve and Tony as she swallowed hard. "It's probably best that we show you."
"Very good, sir."
Instinctively, Tony leaned his head back against Steve's collarbone, feeling the tense muscles across his shoulders relax at his touch.
"No, no, test-mode is fine," Tony said, winking as DUM-E let out a sort of worried beep. Aside from the mess, he was getting tired of constantly having to repair sections of his lab. "Are ya ready?"
“Goddamn asshole,” Tony muttered as he stepped into the elevator, bouncing impatiently as it made its way down to the garage level.  The fact that Howard never once brought Tony to school or picked him up was the very reason why Tony absolutely insisted on doing both for Peter every single day.
"That's right," stated Tony. "I built them with patented materials manufactured by myself and my company, and paid for them out of my own pocket. I believe that's enough of a reason to classify them as mine."
Steve's face fell, but he nodded anyway, knowing it was useless to argue. Instead, he shifted again so he could curl his arm around Tony's shoulders, tucking him against his chest and kissing the top of his head.
Dr Bruce Banner, the world's foremost expert in about eleventy billion things, as 'Uncle Bruce'."
"Well, honey, I know you just said that you don't think this is the kind of tired that sleep can fix, but maybe you should try and catch a few winks, yeah?" Tony suggested. "It's been awhile since you've gotten any sleep that was more than a ten minute catnap."
"And that's all very noble of you, Mr Stark," he said. "But it still doesn't answer my question. How can we be assured that this serum is what it needs to be for Peter?"
"S'okay, sweetheart, I've got you," Steve said as he slipped his hand between their bodies, curling his fingers around Tony's leaking cock. "Come for me, Tony!"
Except, instead of the missile breaking apart into its smaller components just as the sparks appeared, it remained intact, therefore defeating the entire purpose of the new design.
"All right," said Sam. "And the rest of us?"
Somehow, Steve had managed to figure out who Peter was. It was the only explanation Peter could think of for his goofy reaction when he'd said that his father would probably like him if they ever met. Steve's face had turned as red as a beet, which could only mean that he'd already decided that he liked Dad, and Dad had seemed so giddy on the phone it was obvious that he really liked Steve. It had been so long since Peter had heard anything resembling excitement in his father's voice that he had almost forgotten what it sounded like.
