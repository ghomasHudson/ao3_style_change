Tony didn’t think for too long before he was scurrying to where Peggy waited for him. She was up to something, and he was trying desperately to figure it out. “Where are we going?” he asked in a hushed whisper, hoping they were far enough away from his father to finally speak, or whisper at least.
“By the time he’s done that, it could be too late.” Steve threw on a heavier jacket and put the belt on. He grabbed his shield and bag and started to head back out.
“I just need one name, Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.”
“Well then, maybe I’ll go down tomorrow to watch you work some before we go out to get some lunch on me?”
“I… I don’t know,” Tony replied. “I want all that… but at the same time we’re still in a war, and if something happened...It’d be really hard to move on.”
Tony scoffed at himself. He had bigger things to worry about than if he would end up bonded to Steve or not. Like the stupid Captain America outfit. And how he was going to explain to his father that he ended up going to Europe with the alpha he had helped create. And what it was going to be like in a camp full of alphas, then what would happen if Tony went into heat while over there and he didn't have an alpha to protect him from the others. What it might feel like to be surrounded by a pack of alphas all growling and snapping, wanting to get a taste of him.
Nurses came in to check Tony’s heat rate and IV drip, along with a few other things concerning the arc reactor, and they offered coffee and blankets for the parents since it was nearly four in the morning. Maria and Howard were given the option to stay up if they wanted, but they were also allowed to sleep beside their son if they were still tired.
map that Tony had fantasized Steve fucking him on.
“It’s what makes me good at my job.” she said smugly before turning back to Steve, “I trust you’re fine with signing the basic NDA? You’ll be able to mention that you have a commission with us, just not any specific details regarding what Tony may show you or tell you about unreleased projects.”
Howard was running after several more minutes, heart beating rapidly in his chest as he feared the worst. He was about to assume the worst and go find Peggy, but he heard a cry for help, one that didn’t sound very strong, and sounded vaguely like Tony.
his chest. He started to panic again, unsure of how he was going to keep living like this, but then his father put a gentle hand on his shoulder, and he looked up with wide, sparkling eyes.
Sighing and pulling himself out of his day dreaming, Tony picked up a small box of medical supplies and carried them over to the wagon the other boxes were being stacked on. As much as he wanted Steve to join him in heat again, Tony knew that each time Steve joined him, they were risking being caught or having a pregnancy scare. Tony had heard of couples being so in the moment that they forgot to use protection, and of course it ended in pregnancy. It was a scary thought, though pregnancy couldn’t happen outside of heats. Still, having an unplanned pregnancy right now, well, it just wasn’t a good time.
“Alright,” the omega responded, holding back another sob, even as tears streamed down his face. He thought for a minute, trying to come up with a way to respond. “One week. Next Saturday at A&W in upstate California.”
"And I love you, Tony." The blond pulled Tony closer with a happy sigh. "I'm glad I got that serum. There was no way you were going to be interested in dating a sick stick of a beta."
When his name was called, Tony suddenly got a flood of nerves rush through him, making the other omegas in the room react at the change in his scent. He was amazed, actually amazed, at the positive support he received back. There wasn’t a single omega in that waiting room that reacted negatively to his nerves. They all understood what he was going through, to a point, and they knew he was nervous. Tony nearly cried when the room filled with a sweet, supportive scent as he walked to the back with his mother.
When the nest was finished and Tony was in it, practically inviting Steve to get in, the alpha carefully stepped into the nest and settled down next to Tony, a smile on his face. "Now this is more what I'd call a date."
“I’ve got some toast and a couple eggs for us,” Howard said as he looked at his son. “Are you good with eating on the way? I’ve got to get to the base as soon as possible.”
“Thank you.”
Winter soon turned to spring in Malibu as the months passed. Tony had forgotten how lonely he got sleeping in his own bed that smelled like only himself. There had been several nights where he crawled into bed with his mother, comforted by the slight scent she gave off. With her being a beta, it was sometimes difficult for Tony to find comfort when snuggling up to her, but she had her own distinct scent that wasn’t entirely muted by her neutral secondary gender. Tony was grateful she at least had some sort of scent as opposed to no scent at all.
Tony shrugged. “I wouldn’t say I’m obsessed over the more omegan styles… but I do find it nice to dress up every once in a while for Steve now.”
“Fine! He can do whatever the hell he wants! Just don’t come crying to me and blaming his death on me.” Howard angrily turned away from Steve and Peggy, knowing he was losing the argument that was apparently already pitted against him. “He can have his freedom. I don’t care what happens to him at this point…”
Steve sighed. He felt it was unfair if he got to survive and live a young life if his omega had to grow old without him. He'd feel guilty if that was the case.
The next day ended similarly, though Tony didn’t throw up any on the third day. He simply just felt nauseous, but finally on the fourth day he got a well needed break. Tony felt nearly back to normal, not feeling nauseous at all or feeling much pain. He was happy for all of two days before he was suddenly thrust back into what felt like scheduled discomfort and nausea.
Maria spotted Tony exiting the store and smiled at her son, happy to see him with a large bag full of items. “Looks like you were successful in there.”
The wiggling seemed to help, because Steve was growling louder and shifting until Tony was beneath him, a panting and whimpering mess ready to take his alpha. Steve bathed in the omega’s scent when he leaned down to lick Tony’s neck where his scent gland was. The action caused a shiver to run through the omega’s body, and Steve growled once more at the shiver, knowing full well how much power he held over Tony in that moment.
“Anyway.” she said, turning back to Steve, “We’re interested in having you paint a mural in the main lobby. Something that celebrates what Stark Industries is all about.”
“I won’t need to look, but Tony should. He’ll be talking you through some of our projects for inspiration, though you’d have to sign a nondisclosure agreement before we get to that. We have some projects we haven’t announced yet that may come up. Tony may end up launching into too much detail.”
“Well… I actually kinda want to go home. My mom hasn’t seen  me in a long time. I figured I can at least let her see me for a bit before I try to come back.”
Tony hesitated before answering. “She knows I’m with Steve.”
Tony’s eyes lit up as a smile graced his lips. “Really? You’re considering this?”
“Let’s just focus on the present then,” the doctor said, leading Howard away to get him cleaned up.
Stunned that Steve had actually let him go, Tony scoffed, then his face crumpled up into a sob and he buried it in his hands. He couldn’t believe Steve didn’t want him. Showing all his kindness and flirting every once in a while, taking him out on a date after one of his shows. How could Steve do all of this, and then break it to Tony that he didn’t want to take the omega with him to Italy? It just didn’t make sense in his mind. Tony ran over the information too many times to count in his head, and each time came with the same confusion and sadness. The math didn’t add up. Steve plus acting like a proper alpha towards Tony equals dumping him before going to Italy. In what universe did that math ever work out?
There was silence between them as Bucky finally caught up to Tony. “You’ve got a fast omega,” he commented as he caught his breath. “Now go get a room before Howard decides to confront his son.”
Steve growled a little bit.
As intriguing as mathematics were to Tony, it never caught his attention for more than a couple hours. After that, he checked out completely. He glanced around the room and wandered over to Peggy, watching the reports she was working on while they waited for Steve. That captured his attention for about 20 minutes before he sighed and went off to find a chair to sit in and think of something else to do. Nothing came to mind. Tony was bored and without any paper or pencil to write down equations that would take him out of his boredom. He couldn’t go anywhere in the base really, because no one wanted him to mess anything up, not that he was really interested in the files they had unless they were blueprints for future weapons. His father wouldn't allow him to go anywhere in the base either. Tony felt like he was being watched by a babysitter, just like when he was a kid.
Tony stood up, head down as he stared at the floor, his tears still blurring his vision. Maria and Jarvis went silent as they watched him stand there, then turn to them with a vulnerable expression. “Steve needs me… and I need him. I need to go.”
Nevertheless, Tony didn’t regret any of his decisions. He was happy to finally be helping win the war, even if that meant having to go behind his father’s back. He wasn’t sitting on his butt all day waiting for something exciting to happen. Tony was going to the action rather than just hearing about it.
“You did, I didn’t,” Peggy replied with a smile. “He wanted me to come tell Steve about the equipment. He didn’t tell me to take you with me.”
Sending a hard glare at his father, Tony shifted in the bed and whined a little, the pain in his side growing worse the more he moved. “You can’t feel... this pain right now. It fucking hurts!”
“I’m scheduled for another in December... Maybe our bodies are synching up with each other finally.”
The omega tugged the alpha to his lips in a hungry kiss, nipping at his lips until they parted for him so he could dazzle his mouth with the talents of his practiced tongue.
Tony shook his head. “Nothing. He’s not even responding to my ring. When I tap it, it sends a little vibration to a matching ring Steve has,” he explained when Peggy looked confused. “I made them…”
The omega didn’t wake up until late in the night, the moon high and full and shining soft light into the room. When Tony woke, he moaned softly, not yet willing to wake up his alpha. He sat up slowly and took in a deep breath, Steve's scent thick with rut, causing a wave of slick to rush out of Tony's body. He moaned again, moving his legs so he was sitting indian style and balling up his fists in his lap. An intense feeling of need made Tony shiver, and he looked over at Steve’s sleeping figure, which only made him produce more slick.
Tony shook his head. “No, we didn’t really want to bond yet, not while the war is going on. If something were to happen… it would be too painful.”
The next thing Tony knew, they were all heading out to the Alps, very little chatter happening on the planes. It wasn’t a comfortable silence, but Tony had gotten a seat next to Steve, and when his stomach started to act up again, he grabbed the alpha’s hand and held tight, trying not to throw up everywhere. He was glad that Steve tried to make the situation better by squeezing his hand back and shuffling closer. Steve’s scent was heavy with anger, but Tony still found comfort in it. It was still Steve’s scent, and Tony would take anything he could get, even if it was an angered scent. For him, while being pregnant, it calmed him enough to have his stomach settle a little, allowing Tony to open his eyes again, which he hadn’t realized he had closed.
“I’m sorry they didn’t have a better fashion sense, Tony, but this is what I have to work with. I can get someone to change the outfit, but I doubt they’d make one as good as you.” Steve looked down at Tony, honestly looking uncomfortable as he waited for his cue to go on stage.
“If I didn’t know any better, it was like they were trying to run you off.”
Silence fell once more until they reached the hospital, and Howard took over carrying his son once more. The parents and their son filed into the emergency room while Jarvis went to park the car. He didn’t need to be in the way when nurses rushed away the omega to a room. Howard went with the nurses while Maria stayed behind to fill out paperwork. Mother and father were fully prepared to stay with their son for a while before a doctor came around, but thankfully they didn’t have to wait long.
Once the machine and the reactor were all ready to go, all that was left to do was create a serum that would increase Tony’s metabolism, which was what the omega had suspected would have kept Steve alive if he had indeed survived. Test after test needed to be performed with familiar faces, scientists from the Strategic Scientific Reserve volunteering their time to help the mate sick omega reunite with his alpha.
“My son could get killed out here! And he’s in heat now? Are you stupid, Rogers? He should be home where he’d be comfortable and with his mother to help him!”
Tony pulled himself close to Steve, but he nodded at Bucky politely.
“Alpha!”
Howard swallowed and sat on the edge of the bed, seeing Peggy leave the room quickly out of the corner of his eye. She was probably running to get a nurse or doctor.
“I couldn’t care less about Tony’s money or fame,” Steve said. “I like Tony, he makes me happy, and I like when he watches me paint. I may just be a simple artist, but that doesn’t mean that I’m desperate to get some money. Tony is sweet and kind, and I love that about him.”
Peggy turned to look at him and smiled. “But they look damn fine on you. The high rise really suits your body. Now put this on.”
“I wasn’t complaining,” Steve said quickly. “Just… making an observation.”
Tony didn’t know how long he had his eyes closed for, because the next thing he knew Peggy was tapping his shoulder and holding a finger up to her lips, indicating for the omega to keep quiet. He looked around with wide eyes as he woke up, seeing his father’s back turned to them. Looking back at Peggy, he shook his head with a questioning expression.
The room was quiet and calm, the sound of Tony’s breathing seeming to be the loudest thing in the room. It was almost like the war was over, and it was just a time of recovery. Of course, that was the furthest from the truth, with Steve being gone and Tony suffering from injuries that weren’t caught until it was almost too late. The weight of it all rested heavily on Howard’s shoulders, and he wished more than anything that Tony would open his eyes and smile at him. Wishful thinking, since Howard had previously not been a great parent to his son, but that little snarky smile from his son was all he wanted from the world in that moment. A smile and a hug.
Tony winced at Peggy’s sharp words. He knew she was going to be upset, but somehow he didn’t think of how upset she would be.
“Tonight’s lap dancer called in about an unexpected heat. Stone wants you to cover for her.” Clint admitted, his words causing Tony to huff out an unpleased sound.
“Don’t you get involved in this Peggy,” Howard snapped. “This is a family matter.”
“Oh god, thank you doctors.” Howard smiled, hugging himself.
As the rain poured and Steve drew, Tony leaned against the alpha, closing his eyes and taking in the blond's scent. It was calming as his heat approached. Any day now it would happen, a short period of pre-heat happening, warning him that he had roughly an hour to prepare before he would basically lose himself to his needs. Tony hated it honestly. Then again, so did most modern omegas. None of them ever said they always looked forward to their heats, even if they were wanting families or just wanted to have a good time with their alphas. Heats sucked, plain as that.
“Extremely. I want to go dance, but I’ll look stupid around everyone else. Besides, I think most of these people expect me to act like an actual omega…” Tony sighed and rolled his eyes.
Steve didn’t let Tony adjust much, he just pushed his cock all the way inside and then started up a pace only a few seconds after. With as much slick as there was, Steve’s cock had no trouble being able to slide in and out easily without any resistance.
“The wounds were too deep. There wasn’t time to take them out, I had to… I had to put this in his chest. I-It's keeping the shrapnel away from his heart.”
“Hey,” Steve said gently, his voice still deep from sleeping.
As he walked, Tony noticed more areas of pain, specifically in his legs. He was finding it somewhat difficult to walk on his own, but he’d get over it eventually. Besides, the warm water of a shower might help take away some of the pain. At the very least he would be happy to wash off all the dried slick, sweat, and cum, and to finally smell nice again.
“Tony, please.” Maria tried to calm her son as best as she could, but the omega was growing more desperate by the second, and she was struggling to hold Tony back. “You can’t go with him, you know that.”
“That’s okay, let’s clean up your room a bit, and then we’ll get you something you want to eat.” Maria hugged Tony again, this time with a smile, and she entered her son’s room, Tony leading her in. Most of the foods that Tony hadn’t eaten, he had thrown away, but there were some plates with food on them still that looked like they hadn’t been touched in a while.
A question to be answered another day. For the moment, there were no questions needed. Tony was back with Steve, and to him,
“I don’t mind. Seeing an alpha down there is doing wonders for my inflated ego.” Tony wiggled his hips, “And knowing that my scent is going to stick with you all day really turns me on.”
“You’ll let me dress you?” Tony asked, running his fingers over the rack to get an idea as to which section had the softest options. None of them were as soft as Tony’s chosen pair, and the colors available were quite limited compared to the omega section. While the omega section had a full rainbow to choose from, the alpha section seemed to consist of dark green, black, grey, and navy blue. Though there was some maroon as well. And, well, maroon was close enough to the bright red Tony loved, so he pulled out a decently soft pair of maroon pajamas and held it up to Steve.
"Come on, Captain. Let's get you readjusted to the modern age, then we've got one more thing for you that we think will make you feel a lot more at home."
It didn’t process in his mind. There was no way he could be pregnant. He was sure he and Steve had used protection during his last heat, but the more he tried to remember the less he was actually remembering, and his face went white, his hands trembling.
Steve smiled before pulling his omega in for a kiss. He was happy until he noticed Tony was crying again, and he could tell it was more of a sad type of crying than happy. He held Tony close. “Hey, it’s okay. I’m here now, Tony. Everything is gonna be okay, you’ll see.”
"Now maybe you'll learn to make the changes you want yourself rather than depending on drugs to do it for you." Howard tossed the bottle into the trash, leaving Tony to be by himself in the bathroom. "By the way, I'm sending you home as soon as your heat is over."
Maybe he'd ask Steve one day to draw him.
A knock came on his bedroom door. “Tony, are you ready to go?” Maria asked as she poked her head in.
“Five years of mate sickness is quite a long time, especially if you choose not to move on from your old mate,” Howard said, trying to make sense out of the situation. “I don’t want you to be sick any more than you have to, and if you’ve ran these numbers and they look good… then I’m okay with you going through with this.”
Tony flushed as he rolled his eyes. “I don’t think Steve ever thinks I look underwhelming.”
“Y-yeah,” Tony said shakily. He looked up at the heart monitor when it beeped, indicating that Tony’s heart rate went up rather dramatically. “Damn it… Can you, uh… leave me alone for a bit?”
“Yeah, we destroy the headquarters, we take down Hydra for good.”
The omega sighed and looked at the floor. “When Dad is off to London, I’m coming with you, Steve. I want involved in this too. I can do the same things my dad does, but he wants me home to be a good omega, like I should be.”
Tony looked at Steve, his eyes a little teary from just how sensitive he was where they were connected, and then he smiled. It wasn’t the same cocky smirk he’d shown previously to Steve, it was softer, almost shy with how content he was feeling. “Pretty omega?” he fished.
“What relation are you to the omega, Miss?” the first doctor asked Peggy.
Sighing, Tony climbed into the car after his father, scowling when the driver looked back at him in the rearview mirror and smirked.Tony hated alphas who thought they could get away with taking bonded omegas as their own.
“Yeah, he is...and you’re super sweet.” Tony purred, pressing a kiss to his jaw.
The alpha smiled. “Okay, I’ll stop. Don’t want you to leave the party early anyways.”
Maria’s heart broke as he watched her son cry in pain and anguish and frustration. She knelt next to his bed and reached over to wipe away his constant stream of tears. “I think it’s time we go to the hospital… It’s clear you’re not just sick.”
“You’d really do that for me? You’d let me have my own workshop?”
As the plane started up, Peggy reached forward and pulled Tony away from the landing strip, careful not to be too rough. She knew he wanted to watch the plane go, watch Steve go. It was going to be a long night for both agent and omega, but for Tony, it was probably going to feel like the longest night of his life, especially if his heat kept him awake all night. When they were far enough away from the plane, Peggy put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, squeezing lightly to tell him she was there for him, she was going to take care of him until Steve got back.
“Oh? How could you tell?” Howard smiled at his son before he took his own bite of soup.
“Hey, Dad,” the omega said in a small voice, gripping the harness that held the reactor to his chest.
Tony smiled. “Yeah, me too.”
“Well, just don’t expect to be invited in every time you come over.” The older man sat down with a groan and started dishing out their meal.
Tony was told to stay in the apartment that day, Howard claiming that the weather was too bad and he didn’t want to have to worry about his son in case something happened. It was fine. Tony could stay warm inside and work on some more designs. The new uniform that Steve had was dashing to say the least. The strap over the shoulder, the leather gloves, the gun holster that went around one thigh, those were Tony’s favorite parts of the uniform. Honestly there wasn’t a single alpha that could make the uniform look better, which Tony prided himself in.
“You need to take a second look at your son before you decide that he’s too frail to fight,” Peggy said as she glanced at Tony before he disappeared behind a wall. “He’s been working out more since the last time I saw him. He’s aching to fight, and it shows. Tony may be your son, and he may be an omega, but he’s a fighter as well. It’s a shame you can’t actually see that because you’re too blinded by the old ways of your generation.”
“Well then, Mr. Stark. Care to join me on this first date of cheeseburgers and root beer?”
Steve looked up from the papers, and if his eyes could have changed color with his anger, they would have. “That’s exactly what we’re going to do.”
“Where is Steve?”
“Wait here,” Fury said before he went into the room, and Steve tried his hardest to follow, but a couple agents put their hands on his shoulders to stop him.
Tony was once again back to where he was before. Anxiety kept him awake at night and panic attacks bombarded him throughout the days as he lay in his bed. If he ate anything at all, it wasn’t enough to keep up his energy or to support his baby. It was no longer a question of if, but when. Eventually, as the days passed by, everything built up to one cold night that Tony would regret for the rest of his life because of his failure to take care of himself due to the most traumatic event in his life.
“Yeah, he came home from the war in August, and we spent my August and December heats together. I don’t see how this is important to my being sick.” Tony groaned and grabbed his head, carefully making his way back to the bed.
“Your name isn’t on there as my caretaker!”
“Afterwards we can dance to something slow. Just like we did at the—”
"Everything, alpha?" Tony looked up at his mate with a sparkle in his eyes.
“Must be my dance partner.” Tony smiled up at him.
“It seems we will have some time, yeah. Lead the way, we’ll pick up where you left off this morning.” Tony said, moving Clint’s bag to lean up against Bucky’s door.
Steve chuckled as he stepped inside. “Sorry, I guess I’m not such a little guy anymore. If it makes you feel any better, I’m not sure I like this transformation quite yet.”
Tony shook his head, swallowing the chocolate. “No one likes to give out suppressants to an unbonded omega. Kinda fucked, but that’s life.”
“Can you growl?” Steve suggested. “Most alphas I know would think twice about crossing an omega growling at them threateningly.”
“You think so?”
Tony heard his name called out by his alpha, and he let out a louder whine as he looked around more frantically until a path cleared out before him, and suddenly Steve was there. Tony’s legs moved on their own as he ran to Steve as fast as he could, jumping into the alpha’s arms as Steve met him halfway down the cleared path. Those strong alpha arms picked up Tony from the ground and held him tight, as if it had been years since they had seen each other and not just half a year. Tony was so caught up in the moment that he wrapped his legs around Steve’s torso and held on tight, taking in his scent and relaxing in the familiarity of it. He didn’t even care that they were only hugging and taking in each other’s scents. Kissing be damned, this was the closest Tony had ever felt to his alpha before.
Howard sighed as he locked up the apartment the two of them were staying in. “Tonight you need to get some rest.”
"Ten bucks says that Ty guy will still come over here and demand a date," Steve said with a sigh.
Everything was so confusing to the alpha, so he ran, trying to find an escape route as he slammed open a pair of metal doors.
Steve was good for him like that, it seemed.
One day, Tony told himself. They’d get married after the war and physically mark each other, Steve giving Tony the bite scar and Tony giving Steve a smaller version of the bite scar.
Pulling the alpha out of the room, Tony smiled wider. “Come on, let’s put up decorations today. We’ve got a lot of house to cover.”
“Sorry, you were starting to move quite a bit, and the doctor said to keep you lying still so your rib could heal.” She leaned forward and put a gentle hand on Tony’s upper arm. “You parents are here, they would like to see you. Think you have the energy for that?”
Between his legs and looking up at him with bright blue eyes was Steve, the omega’s cock in his mouth and tongue working expertly to make every little noise escape Tony’s mouth. Tony moaned again, a little louder as he rolled his head to the side and let his eyes close again. The thought had just crossed his mind that Steve might not have even bothered to put Tony back into any clothing after taking off his party outfit. Looking up again, Tony noticed the outfit hanging up in his closet. He moaned yet again and brought his legs up around Steve’s head, keeping the alpha in place.
“Ah, see, he doesn’t need a dance with me for that, not to mention that my dear Pepper should be in on any such conversation as she handles a lot of that kind of thing for me. Why don’t you direct him her way and I can finish up my dance with Steve and not have to get close to the guy.”
“Please, I just want to know what happened to Tony,” Steve begged Fury, looking tired and defeated.
“A good challenge, but never impossible to see through to the end.”
The omega preened while letting out a soft moan. Yup, Steve was definitely bigger than other alphas he’s had. The alpha wasn’t even half way inside him yet, and he was feeling his hole slicken like he was going into heat.
Sighing, Tony put his ring on and tapped the top of it twice, and a few seconds later, it vibrated slightly, letting the omega know that Steve had also tapped on his ring. It was a simple way to keep in communication with each other, even if they were miles apart already.
Shaking his head, Tony sighed. “I’m getting tired, so I think I’m going to go to bed.”
“Our own? We wouldn’t have to share?” Clint asked.
Steve's attention was caught. "Sounds like your true potential has been hindered by the fact that you're an omega. I'm actually disappointed society hasn't made much progress in terms of what omegas can do." Steve got on his feet again and took off his shoes, then he sat next to Tony. "Perhaps having the right alpha would set you free from the prison you're kept in."
“As soon as the war is over, I promise we’ll get married, my love.”
“Good, because Happy isn’t thrilled about these narrow streets while driving the limo. He’s eager to get back to more limo-friendly traffic or whatever.” Tony said, slipping his arm through Steve’s and guiding him back down the steps.
Steve sighed as he was left alone. Sure, he thought Tony was cute. He was small and sassy; how was that not cute? Then he thought how he never really thought about any omega like this before when he was just a beta. That serum changed a lot more about him than he originally thought. Not that it was all bad. He actually had physical and emotional changes when around omegas and alphas, which was an odd sensation he had never experienced before but rather liked.
“It’s been a long time, Captain…”
“Congratulations, you’ve just been promoted.”
“Yeah, this is Tony. Tony, this is my friend Bucky I told you about.”
Steve smiled and hugged his omega close. “Well, I suppose it's good to know that you can take care of yourself when I’m not around to take care of you.”
"Yeah. Who wouldn't want to protect someone as special as you?"
“Something like that, yeah.” Tony made eye contact with Steve before he pulled the alpha down for a kiss. “I love you to infinity, Steve Rogers, and that number will never get smaller.”
Sitting next to the radio was one of the Howling Commandos, and Tony wished that he had been the one to sit in that seat, but he felt better pacing around. His stomach was filling with butterflies anyways, and the more he moved around, the better he felt.
The moment of silence was heavy between father and son. Tony was conflicted for sure, and he felt like shit, but his father had saved him. Howard had known the arc reactor was keeping him alive somehow, and he had known somehow that there wasn’t enough time to get him to the hospital without the reactor. Howard had known how bad a shape Tony was in, and despite their history, he had chosen to save Tony.
“They’ll undoubtedly shoot back.”
"It's be nice if we could get some more alone time. I mean I know we just spend part of my last heat together… but I'd like to spend a whole one with you." Tony leaned in closer, lowering his voice as he spoke about the more private topic.
“Fine isn’t good enough—hand me my soldering iron.” a hand appeared, outstretched and wiggling impatiently.
"2008. Been a long time since 1945. But life hasn't changed all that much, I promise. You'll see soon enough. As for your concerns about your old mate…"
Though he truly missed his best friend, Steve found himself happier than he had been in quite a while, and he caught himself thinking that he would be happy staying with Tony for the rest of his life. That thought put a smile on his face while he cuddled Tony closer and closed his eyes.
“Have I ever told you how glad I am to have you back?” Tony asked while opening his eyes again to look at Steve.
More silence. Tony didn’t know what to say. He knew what Steve was implying what Steve knew he needed to do, and Tony wanted to scream and object. Steve couldn’t leave him again, not when he couldn’t come back. It was unfair. They had plans for the future! They were going to get married, and they were having a baby together, it just wasn’t fair for Steve to leave again!
“Does that happen often? Being under a deadline?”
By the time Steve pulled back to breathe, his face was absolutely covered in slick, some even in his hair as he set Tony on his back again and made eye contact with him. Steve’s eyes stayed with Tony’s even as he bent down and placed a kiss at the omega’s navel, leaving a wet spot on Tony’s skin.
Tony chuckled. “All the stars we can see in the sky wouldn’t even come close to the number that represents my love for you, Steve.”
“You’re a stupid alpha,” Tony said after his crying had settled once more. “This is why we shouldn’t make more super soldiers like you. They’d all turn into stupid alphas.”
The assistant frowned. "I… will let him know that." Without any more words, the assistant turned and left, leaving Tony and Steve alone again.
“Just don’t get sick. I’d hate for you to start your heat with an upset stomach.”
“As good as it could have gone,” the woman replied. “The doctors did warn Tony to try not to be so stressed, but other than that, the baby is healthy and growing at a good rate.”
“I don’t think it’s that bad… but I guess I won’t hurt to take something.” Tony shrugged as he finished his first sandwich.
The woman’s shell cracked as her smile fell, and a brief flash of panic crossed her expression.
“Well, I’d like to say these bags are for good reason. Been working nonstop to get your alpha back to you.”
Tony gave a little half-laugh at that. “Maybe you’d still be stupid if you were a beta. Can’t change a personality, even if you turn the person into an alpha.”
will let the doctors do what they need to.”
"The weather is nice enough for it. I haven't bothered to explore any of the new food places yet," Steve said as he followed Miss Potts "just moved into my new apartment, and I just decided to get groceries instead of eating out."
He had been fast asleep, tossing and turning in his bed. Tony had simply been unable to eat at all that day, and he was feeling weaker than normal. Most of his day had been spent sleeping or staring at the walls. He seemed to be in an entirely different world when someone came in to check on him, and he hardly responded to them when they talked to him. He hadn’t let anyone know how steady his pain was growing throughout the day, the cramping that often had him curled up into a ball on his bed while wishing the pain would go away.
Tony laughed, “Yeah, yeah. I’m serious though. We’re leaving for a better life.”
The omega nodded with a smile, opening the door further so his mother could enter. “I’m almost done getting ready.”
"Holy shit," he whispered to himself as he backed away from the curtain. Okay, so Tony had a
“Only this week he’s been sick,” Maria responded, but a noise of opposition came from the bathroom. “Is that not right, Tony?”
Tony felt scared, in all honesty. He was scared Steve wasn’t going to make it back to him. He was scared an alpha might barge in and take advantage of him. He was scared their camp might be attacked in the middle of the night and he would be taken hostage. There were so many things on his mind that he found it impossible to sleep until he exhausted his body to the point of passing out.
“Not nearly enough.”
“Oh I… I don’t know,” Tony said, shrugging. “Dancing is nice and all, but I don’t really dance all that much.”
Tony returned to the picture frame he had slammed down and picked it up, running his finger over a crack in the glass he had created. He sighed and set it upright. “I hope this war ends soon. You won’t be distracted by any others who try to take advantage of you.”
Tony whined. “Steve, let it go.”
“Unless that’s moving too fast for you,” Steve said gently, stopping Tony and putting a hand on the back of his head, looking into his eyes with an expression so soft that the omega whined again.
“I take it that means you both also have your own rooms so
Steve charged towards the agents surrounding Tony, baring his teeth and growling. The Hydra agents all turned their attention to the captain, allowing Tony to bend his knees and build up strength to help him jump. As soon as Steve was next to the agents, Tony jumped straight up, pulling out the pin in the grenade. He tossed it down to where he had been standing seconds before, and then he felt  himself be caught by Steve, the captain having jumped over the agents as soon as he had seen Tony jump. They landed on the barrel of the gun on the tank nearby right as the grenade went off, the agents crying out and falling to the ground below them.
Steve chuckled. "Nope, the glory of a retail store. Anything you could ever want is inside. Come on, I'll make sure you don't get lost."
“Oh, I’m sure we’ll be stuck together quite satisfactorily.”
Tony pointed to James, “That’s Rhodey bear, my best friend from college.”
Tony stepped closer to join the conversation. “How are you going to convince them to help you?”
“His...date.” the man frowned.
Steve. Turned to look at who had tapped his shoulder, pausing his and Tony’s dance. “I’m sorry, but we are dancing right now,” he said as kindly as he could muster. “Maybe the next song?”
While the commandos hurried to extract information, Steve and Tony stayed back, keeping an eye on the trees in case other Hydra agents came for them. There were loads of words wanting to be spoken between the two, but they could wait until they got back to their little camp. For the time being they could exchange glances while they waited for the rest of the commandos. After a bit of waiting, the commandos returned with some papers in hand.
“As long as we’re both soft and cuddly once we change.” Tony said, digging through the rack of pajamas, looking for the softest one in his size, regardless of color. Sure, red was his favorite, but they seemed limited in choices already, so why bother with worrying about color.
“Well when this war is over, and we get married and move into a house together, I’ll let you have the garage as a workshop, so you can work on whatever projects you want.”
The two omegas climbed out the back of the car and hurried inside, each getting the breakfast they were craving. Clint boxing up four slices of pepperoni pizza and a soft drink, Tony grabbing a cheeseburger, a doughnut, and a juice. Then they returned to the car to eat on the way to Hydra’s base.
“Yeah… Let’s go find Steve.”
“You will. I won’t abandon you to the wolves.”
Well...
“I would hope so. There’s no way I’m letting you leave me mid-heat to go play hero.”
“Sure. When I was in the army, there were actually several omegas enlisted with us. They could come up with a mean growl, and they’d use it often when we’d spar.”
With the manor once again rid of the male beta, a lot of tension seemed to dispel, much to the relief of Tony. He knew it was difficult to hide things from his father, but somehow he and Steve had managed to keep from Howard just how intimate the two were. It surprised Tony a little, but he wasn’t going to complain. Any time away from his father and keeping this secret successfully from him was a good time for Tony.
Steve knelt down on the ground and got between Tony’s legs, reaching up to shove the omega’s shirt off and toss it to the side. The small moan he received made him smile as he leaned forward and planted a kiss to the center of Tony’s chest. Pulling back, he pulled off the gloves he wore, tossing them into the start of a pile of the clothes. Next to come off was the helmet, his blond hair standing up on end from sweat. His jacket soon followed, being tossed into the pile. His lifted his eyes to Tony’s tilting his head to the side with a look of relief to just be back with Tony and to be alone with him like this.
crush on Steve.
Tony nodded, looking back up at the stars. “I think preheat will hit either tonight or tomorrow…”
“You’ll like these clothes. Besides, you’re dressing up for Steve anyways.”
“You heard the colonel, your friend is most likely dead.”
"You don't think he deserves a dance anyways, especially since you have danced with Tony all night?" The assistant asked.
“Oh don’t you dare get grease all over my nice furnisher, Anthony. Go fetch your dirty stool of shame from the closet!” Miss Potts said.
“I don’t need an alpha anyways, because I’m going to make my own way into the world as soon as I can get away from you and your restricting house rules!” Tony cried out as he tried to be intimidating, leaning forward aggressively at his father.
“I know, Dad. But I don’t know if I can really last the rest of my life without him…”
“I wouldn’t mind some bacon on some of those,” Tony added after shaking his thoughts away from Steve.
“Why should I? You decided a blonde beta took your fancy today rather than the omega you’ve been seeing for months now.”
Tony smiled, squeezing his hand, “Remember, there’s going to be lots of cameras and shouting when we arrive. Just smile politely and I’ll get you through as quick as I can.”
"You could say he died. A new Captain took his place when he woke up from the ice in a German laboratory 70 years later." Steve flicked his eyes up to Tony's, reaching forward to take the omega's top off.
“You just think he’s cute now.” Peggy smirked knowingly at the blond, patting his back as she left.
With Tony presented like he was, Steve felt his cock twitch in anticipation. He was excited, to say the least. After a long couple of days walking in the Italian sun and wondering if Tony was alright, Steve was more than ready for this. To spend part of a heat with his omega, tell Tony that he was safe once again, that’s what Steve wanted. He wanted to connect with Tony on a whole new level, move on from the courting phase of their relationship. That phase had probably ended already to be truthful, especially if they were naked on a cot going through a heat for the first time together. It was all so interesting how one day they were still courting, then the next they were sharing a heat together.
“I am happy with you,” Steve said softly. “I want to marry you as soon as possible.”
“Bucky!” Tony quickly pulled away from his alpha, rushing into the arms of his best friend with a wide smile on his face. Bucky’s familiar scent was also comforting to the brunet, the peppery smell feeling almost like a second home, some place Tony could be safe and not worry about the troubles of the world. He casually ignored seeing his father pull away from the group to jog over to the hanger entrance where Maria was still standing after Tony had left her side to find Steve. He’d greet his father later. For now, he had Steve and Bucky to catch up with, and he knew his mother wanted to catch up with Howard just as much as Tony wanted Steve to hold him. He was sure Howard wouldn’t be upset at a delayed greeting from him.
“I’ll consider myself lucky for seeing the real Tony Stark, then.” Steve smiled as Tony got the stool, and he looked back at Miss Potts.
“There are a lot more cameras here than what I saw in the car,” Steve said, smiling as Tony guided him through the crowd.
“Why don’t you sit down and relax while you wait,” James suggested. “You work too hard sometimes, just like Tony.”
“I did tell him that I wished he slept better,” Steve said. “But maybe I can convince him to sleep in a proper bed more often if I offered cuddles or something like that.”
“I’m going to Europe after New York. They want me and the girls to perform for some of the soldiers over in Italy.”
“Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third. Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers… killed in action. Period.”
“I’m glad you could spend Christmas with us, Steve,” Maria said as she took a break from cooking to grab a cup of coffee. “I know you’ve mentioned that you don’t really have any family left, but as far as I’m concerned, you’re basically family here already.”
One last meeting was held just before the troops shipped out to the Alps, going over the small details of the mission, who would go where and do what, and also Steve mentioning that he planned to let himself get captured to get inside the base, allowing the commandos to come barging in, and then the rest of the troops would storm the base and attack. It all sounded well and good, but it didn’t help settle the bit of anxiousness left floating around Tony’s stomach. He had to excuse himself from the meeting once to go throw up, which of course raised a bit of suspicion, but Tony played it off as only nerves, and that he was more anxious than he showed. Thankfully for him, the lie was convincing enough.
“I kind of...work until I pass out?” Tony admitted, “Oh and there’s times where I forget about my heat cycle and I just… go into heat suddenly and there is no way I’m going to do a heat walk up to my penthouse with the amount of alphas that work in my building. They do not need to know when I’m dripping wet with heat. That kind of vulnerability is only ok for close family to witness...or mate once a mate is in the picture.”
himself directly involved, but he kind of was. His father was over in Europe trying to take the fight to Hydra, Peggy was doing the same thing, and Steve was here acting like a war hero for war bonds. Three major people in his life were directly involved in the war, and he wanted so bad to be involved as well. Help his dad build something, help Peggy track down targets, help Mr. Captain America himself punch Nazis in the face. Just doing his part to help in the war! It wasn't helping his peace of mind, but at least he was around one of his closest friends now.
“Oh, Tony…” Maria started fully crying as he hugged her son once more. “I love you so much… and I want you to be happy and free of your sickness. If this is the way to do it, then I’m okay with it as well.”
Fury nodded. "We have information on him that you'll be very interested in, but it's best to just show you rather than tell you."
“Dad doesn’t… he doesn’t know that Steve and I are physical. That would have just been too much for him to deal with.”
“Yeah, I really made us wait for it, didn’t I?” Steve chuckled as he pulled Tony closer. “At least we’re out of the sight of your dad, so we don’t have to hold back as much.”
Tony smiled up at him and guided him along, stopping them when he had to play nice and give a few words to some overly persistent reporters asking him about his date and sometimes some Stark Industries things.
"I'll stay here with you," Peggy said, putting a hand on Tony's shoulder.
“Did you see him back there? He’s too busy with his project to know we’ll be gone, I promise.”
“And for some nice eye candy for me to look at for a while.” Tony said shamelessly.
“Sorry, I… misinterpreted, clearly.” Steve cleared his throat. “I’m not usually one to take that train of thought, but…”
Steve chuckled. “But why? It makes me happy to see you like this. But I do like this outfit. I would hate to see it ruined. It was probably pretty expensive too.”
It felt like hours of waiting. Nothing was coming through the radio. No static, no voices, nothing, and that worried Tony even more than he already was. He almost felt like his heart would stop beating.
Tony caught his thoughts wandering again, which seemed to be happening quite a lot. Living with his father, it was hard to properly take care of heats when they came. Howard still didn’t know just how intense a relationship his son was in, which was honestly a miracle by any means. Tony was surprised his father hadn’t figured it out yet, because sometimes Steve couldn’t help kissing Tony right in front of everyone and it was hard to ignore how red the omega’s face was after being kissed. Nevertheless, Tony and Steve’s sexual relationship was still a secret to Howard and Maria Stark.
“If this is a family matter, then it concerns me,” Steve said. “Tony wants to fight, so let him. He’s not a child anymore. He can make his own decisions, omega or not.”
happen in the changing room.
“Eight o’clock, on the dot. Don’t you dare be late,” Tony said, his voice cracking. “Understood?”
Howard picked up his son carefully and let Maria wrap the omega up, then the three were heading downstairs and to the garage where Jarvis had their car running and ready to leave. Tony was handed off to Maria once she was seated in the car, and she held her son close, her own tears mixing with Tony’s as she leaned her head against his. The trip to the hospital was silent except for Tony’s crying, both out of emotion and physical pain. Everyone knew just how painful the moment was, and any amount of talking wasn’t going to help the situation in the slightest.
Tony shook his head, keeping his eyes trained on the floor as he picked up the pants he was going to wear. In his head, he was glad he already had his shirt with the high collar on that muted his scent and hid his stomach, even though he knew he wasn’t even close to having a baby bump yet.
“I’m feeling better already. I’m fine, Peggy.”
“No to the lip gloss, but I’ll do the eyeliner.” Tony moved himself to the vanity and sat down, taking the earrings out of the box and putting them on. He turned his head from side to side and smiled. They weren’t too big or too small, and they caught every bit of light, no matter what direction his head was turned. By the time he had put the matching brooch on, Peggy had already slipped into her dress and was approaching Tony from behind.
Tony tumbled into the back of the limo and once Steve followed, he tugged Steve into a seat and slipped into his lap. “Sorry about how this date turned out.”
Tony slammed the bomb into the hatch and started running away, back down the barrel with Steve hot on his heels. The super soldier was faster than Tony by far, and he was able to grab the omega right as they jumped off the tank, the bomb inside detonating and sending them flying back towards the woods. The explosion was huge and hot, wiping out most of the base and Hydra agents. The heat was so intense that Tony felt like his skin was going to burn off, despite being mostly clothed. The sound the explosion created was deafening, and as Steve and Tony landed roughly near some trees, the brunet found himself covering his ears as best as he could. There were so many things going on at once that he thought he might pass out from the intensity of it all.
“Fuck, please.” Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, “You like me calling you Captain, or so you have a real name you’d prefer me to cry out when you hit me deep?”
“It’s the least I can do for you. I tried not to wash too many of Captain Rogers’s things, so their scent will last a little longer.”
“Oh well if they try anything your ex army bodyguard eye candy will ward them off.”
“I think you know how,” Steve growled low in Tony’s ear, which made the omega shiver.
was unique to Steve only. Even Bucky’s scent was far from Steve’s, the darker haired alpha’s being more peppery with a bit of citrus to it, which was a scent that Tony knew he had smelled long before meeting Bucky.
Tony leaned forward heavily, his arms almost slamming onto the table. “Oh, it’s not? You didn’t want to take me on dates and butter me up just to dump me before you head to Europe to dance around stage with one of the girls that travel with you?”
Steve growled, grabbing Fury’s shoulder to stop him. “Then what the hell are we doing here? Quit playing games, I want straight answers right
“I think so… but I wanted to talk to you two about something.”
“Sure, uhhh…” Tony said looking around.
“The fifth one was here in Poland, near the Baltic,” Tony heard the blond say, having not paid any attention to the conversation before hand since he was told to sit aside and let the alphas and betas do their work. He hadn’t been too happy with that command given to him by a random agent.
The two finally arrived at their date location, Tony looking up from Steve’s neck to see where they were. Boasting that it was established in 1874 stood the Criterion Restaurant, a place that Tony knew royalty and parliament members dined. Getting out of the car, the omega looked wide eyed at the entrance of the restaurant.
“I didn’t want to
“And I missed you.” Tony smiled up at Steve before pulling away. “Come on, I’m sure Dad wants to get home as soon as possible.”
Steve kissed Tony gently and pulled back to smile at his omega. “Right by my side, even after the war.”
“I don’t know what to do… I don’t know how to take care of a baby! Holy shit, Dad is going to kill me…”
“Very hungry,” the omega responded. “And like this is all feels like a real thing now. I’m still scared, honestly…”
“Ma’am,” Bucky said as Peggy approached.
“Sounds like a plan,” Steve said, ignoring the remaining flashes from cameras that had suddenly gone off during the kiss.
“As of today, the SSR is being retasked.”
Tony shrugged. “I don’t think I ever had a mind sound enough to even think of asking for more food. I think I barely got breaks between my waves of need to eat and drink. Hell, I don’t think I ever cleaned up until this morning, which was absolutely disgusting.”
“Howard,” Maria said. “Do you really think this is best for Tony? I don’t want to sound like I’m opposing this but… well dang it, I don’t want to lose my baby boy.”
“I was forced to walk up three flights of steps, Steve! Who’s your land lord? I need to talk to them about meeting me fix and upgrade the thing!” Tony whined before taking off his sun glasses and smiling, “But the view up here is totally worth the climb. Wow, you clean up nice, Rogers.”
“My sister would not be very happy with me if I missed my flight,” the dark haired alpha said, picking up his bags with a smirk. “I’ll write when I get to her house. Don’t know when I’ll see you two again, but write me any time.”
Once again, Steve led Tony through the store and to the grocery side where they would find all the snacks they wanted. Steve insisted on at least getting something more filling and nutritious for Tony so it wouldn't just be alcohol and junk food in his stomach, but other than that, he let the omega pick out whatever he wanted to snack on after that. Cookies, crackers, nuts, they grabbed perhaps a little of everything. And if they didn't eat it all that night, there was always the next day, which was a Sunday, so neither of them had to necessarily work until Monday. Having a weekend for just the two of them was sounding nicer to Steve the longer time went on. Sure, the gala hadn't gone completely as planned, but Steve still got to spend time with Tony, and they had shared a kiss in front of a ton of cameras. Staying out of the public eye for a day would give the reporters a great day to come up with wild theories and stories to post as soon as they could.
Tony chuckled, “No, he’s the personal assistant to one of my exes. I’m guessing Ty forgot I’ve met him while we were together, or he assumes I am quick to forget the little people he doesn’t properly appreciate.”
That was when Peggy entered. “What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?”
“Perks of having a beta female as a friend, I guess. I get to wear her clothes.”
Tony leaned against Steve, snuggling in as best he could in the back seat of the limo while in their suits.
Steve sighed at the door, turning around to see Tony hugging himself. He looked distant, like his mind was somewhere far from reality, and it made Steve sad to see his omega so distressed.
Smiling wide, the alpha leaned down to nuzzle Tony. “I love you. One day, we’ll get married and live happily after the war is over and we don’t have to worry about Nazis anymore.”
“I think I can agree with you on this one thing. I’d rather see them all be brought down to equal levels as everyone else. They’re too high in society and have too little expected of them. Find an omega, settle down, have a family, forget about your family and find a younger, prettier omega that catches their eyes.”
“Steve’s ring. I gave him a ring for Christmas, and I have one that matches it.” Tony weakly brought his hand up out of the blankets for his father to see. The ring looked like it was barely holding on. “I made these rings… they are linked through wireless networking frequencies. It’s something I came up with… I have the notes on it in my desk if you’re interested.”
“You almost gave Steve a heart attack,” Bucky said with a smirk as he walked towards the flaming chunks of tank. “Commandos, search through the parts of the base not burning and gather any information on the last Hydra base.”
“Yeah, healing if I didn’t have these bandages on.” Tony grunted and grimaced, catching his breath as he struggled to breathe properly with the bandages on.
The cramping only got worse as the minutes ticked by. Tony was screaming in pain and anguish, tears rolling down his face. He wanted to get up and get help, but he was so weak that he couldn’t move a muscle. He had to lay in his bed and suffer and hope someone could hear his screams. Otherwise, he would be found in the morning covered in blood and sobbing at yet another loss.
anything!” Tony pouted.
Maybe Steve could go too. Tony would get approval of some outfits perhaps, and maybe they could slip into a changing room and try on some of the outfits. Maria would have a
Slowly, the three made their way to the back of Howard’s home office. The vile of serum sat waiting on the desk, its blue tint cold and unforgiving. It almost felt threatening, but it held so much promise in it that Tony was counting on it working.The door to the closet and the machine both were open, just waiting for the lone occupant to enter for a slumber that would last over a hundred years if it needed to.
Howard ran a hand through his hair. “You’re too distracted by that boy… Don’t be disappointed when you can’t see him today. His world doesn’t revolve around you, you know.”
“Well, they aren’t impossible, at least.”
Steve couldn’t help the dorky smile that formed on his lips as he looked at Tony. “You sure are. Quite adorable, if I was to dare to say so.”
Tony didn’t want help. He wanted to die. He wanted to be with Steve again and nothing else. Tony didn’t care about getting help for his wounds or his broken heart. There was just nothing anyone could do that could help Tony.
Tony felt his stomach flip as they rounded the corner of the hallway and met Steve face to face, along with Bucky. The omega’s heart started beating faster as he made eye contact with his alpha. “Hello, Captain,” he managed to say with a smile.
Steve shut the door after Tony was out and shrugged. “I can buy you dinner.”
“Perhaps one tonight would be appropriate?” Steve asked, a slightly hopeful tone to his voice.
Tony nodded. Too bad I don't have an umbrella with me. My clothes are going to get soaked."
Steve tilted his head to one side. “No, I doubt that… I think they’re jealous because they don’t have me as a boyfriend and you do.”
"I saw the truth behind Hydra's motives. They converted me from the false patriotism I acted under. Captain America is dead."
Another round of tears sent Tony nearly wailing for his alpha, having the thought that the baby was like Steve’s last Christmas gift to Tony, and that seemed to break the omega’s heart even more. How could he even go on living like this? Being without his alpha for the rest of his life just didn’t sound enjoyable at all. Sure, maybe he would get lucky and settle with another alpha in the future, but no one could replace Steve. That alpha had been one of a kind, the only one in the world to have ever been born a beta and be turned into the alpha he had so easily become. It was like Steve had been destined to be an alpha all along, and had he not been an alpha, Tony probably would have dated Steve a little, but he didn’t know if he would have gone as far as he had with alpha Steve.
Tony smiled and pressed up into the kiss to return it without pressing for it to go deeper before letting it come to a soft end.
“Your aunts do have a… specific style,” Maria agreed. “But I agree that we need to get you some clothes that you like. We don’t want you looking underwhelming for your alpha, now do we?”
The night the suit was finished, most of the Howling commandos, Steve, and Peggy were watching Tony work. The reactor was having its finishing touches being worked on late into the night, and when it was finally finished, it lit up with a blue glow that filled the darkened lab. Everyone was in awe of the reactor, something that looked like it didn’t belong in the 1940’s. Tony held it up and admired his work, silently apologizing to his dad for completing the reactor first.
Here's this chapter a little earlier than normal! My normal posting day is a busy day, so I thought I'd be nice and give you some more angst early lmao. Also this chapter is where the unprofessional medical procedures tag comes into play.
“No, Tony! If you depend on these for your freedom, then you’ll just end up putting yourself into a downward spiral towards disappointment.”
“Well maybe I can’t hold myself back from taking you straight up to the bedroom,” Steve rumbled.
“If you acted as fast as you say you did, he has the chance. But it will take him time to wake up. We should get him to a hospital so he can be watched more carefully, just in case he takes a turn for the worst.”
The soldier at the door looked awkwardly at Steve and cleared his throat. “We really don’t have much time, Captain. We have clothes and toiletries packed for you, and the plane leaves in an hour.”
Lodged deep into his skin were pieces of shrapnel and other pieces of metal. They were mostly digging into the skin over his heart, and the wounds were still bleeding quite a lot.
Steve wasn't quite as fast to remove his suit, but he had to admit he was much more comfortable in the red pajama pants and plain white tank top that replaced the suit. Being away from the flashing lights and loud noises of the gala instantly made Steve feel more in his element.
Phillips picked up a photo and pointed at it. “Hydra’s last base is here, in the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.” He tossed the photo back onto the table, where a commando grabbed it and looked at it.
Tony and Steve both nodded, and the omega approached Bucky to give him a tight hug. "Come see us for Thanksgiving or Christmas if you can."
“Yeah, just let me get shoes on.”
Tony covered his eyes as he started crying again, and it was all Steve could do to not whine and make it known that he didn’t know how to comfort his mate who had left his parents behind. But the alpha knew he had to comfort Tony even if he didn’t know the best way to do so. All he did was hold the omega closer and crooned. In a matter of seconds, Tony was calming down and curling up into Steve, and in the back of his mind, Steve made a note that this was probably how things were going to be for a while, especially after all Tony had gone through, and Steve was okay with that fact. He would be there for his mate in rain or shine, no matter what.
“What about the plane?” Tony asked, also sounding hysterical.
Tony hesitated before he pulled back. “I don’t know… maybe, but the war is still going on, and I don’t want to risk losing you if we plan a wedding or something.”
“I swear you’re more omega now than you’ve ever been,” the mother said gently, placing a hand on her son’s shoulder. “But I’m very glad to see you’re getting closer to your normal self again. I was worried you were getting sick.”
Steve smirked back, leaning into the touch. "The hell I can't. I pay very high for the omegas I satisfy."
Steve sighed. “What you saw was far from the truth. The private was talking with me about how I saved all those soldiers and she was getting uncomfortably close with me. I told her I was taken, but she refused to listen to me. Next thing I knew she was kissing me, and… yeah I kissed her back, but it was because I was thinking of you.”
“You sound so confident in my skills, I’m flattered,” Steve said with a smile, going through the door.
“I want to learn. I’m willing to learn, and I want to fight. I don’t want to be a useless omega anymore.”
“Well fuck me, really? There is actually an
“We’re going to be supportive when our friend gets a nice alpha for once,” Rhodey said.
“Steve! You made it.” James grinned, patting his shoulder as he stepped aside to let the artist in, “Go make yourself comfortable. We have a few more people coming, yet. Tones is busy fucking with my TV and gaming set up, so just ignore the legs poking out from behind the TV stand.”
"You mean like chores and such? I can handle doing those things myself. If my omega is loyal, then I'll reward then with all the best things I can offer, no strings attached."
Maria soon decided that there wasn’t anything in that store worth buying, and Tony was thrilled to finally leave. He wanted to be surrounded by actual scents and not the dead ones that betas had. They went into several more stores, searching and not finding much. It seemed that the war was taking a toll on all goods shipments, including omegan goods. There were only a handful of mixed stores that were offering a full line of omegan products, and those stores were not the most family friendly. Still, if they were offering any sort of clothing, Tony was highly considering stopping by one of the stores just to check it out.
“Goodbye, Mom and Dad…”
“Then maybe we can have a private session to test out our compatibility. Followed by a nice date.” Clint suggested.
“Where I’m going, if anybody yells at me, I’ll just shoot them.”
“Well, if it isn’t the star spangled man with a plan,” the older man said, not looking too impressed that Steve, Peggy, and Tony had all come to his tent, let alone even be in Italy. “What is your plan today?”
Peggy searched her closet, picking out a pair of pants that were a dark grey, then she picked a top that flared out at the bottom. She held it up to Tony, tilting her head in thought. “Why don’t you go put on those pants real quick, and tuck your shirt into it. Lose the suspenders for now.”
The dark haired alpha shrugged. "Small price to pay for victory."
Bucky nodded, hugged Tony once more, then hugged Steve. “Gonna miss you guys. See you around the holidays.” He saluted, and then Bucky turned on his heel and walked away from his two friends, a smile on his face the whole time.
“We only have room for the captain,” the soldier once again spoke up, and Tony hated how he tried to use a commanding tone with him.
The European landscape flew by as Tony looked out the window, wondering just when the war was going to end. It had already lasted far longer than anyone had anticipated, but that nasty alpha who was the leader of Germany just didn’t know when to quit. It sickened Tony to even think of how many people were being slaughtered or taken advantage of. It was disgusting, and it would only end when the Nazis, and Hydra, were defeated for good. Only a few more steps had to be taken, but they were careful steps. One slip up at the Hydra headquarters could have meant disaster for the rest of the world.
The omega pressed his lips together, flushing even more. “I swear if you don’t stop you’ll be paying to replace this suit and this chair.”
Steve pulled back enough to look his omega in the eyes. “I don’t know exactly what you went through, but I can only imagine. I know you’re tough, but even tough people break down sometimes. Losing the baby is painful, yes. It’s going to be probably for the rest of our lives. But I’m here now, and I’m not leaving again. We’ll mourn the loss together, and I’ll love you as much as I can to show you how much I care.”
The omega smiled. “Yeah, Peggy gave me those. She said they looked better on me than her.”
“You think so?”
“But what if I am?” Steve asked playfully with a smirk. “Maybe I’ll teach you not to say something so offensive next time.”
Tony sucked in a breath, coughed, and then headed into the hallway that led into the base. “Come on, we have to help Steve.”
Peggy hesitated at the entrance of the tent, sighing as she watched Phillips turn to look at her. “Any news?” she asked.
Tony nodded. “I’m not exactly sure how long I can make the sleep for myself last, but if we make a serum similar to what Steve had, then I could possibly be frozen in time to wait for Steve to be found and also woken up.”
Steve pulled away very quickly from the private with wide eyes and a look of horror. Of course Tony had walked in right at that moment, only to see him kissing the blonde. This was going to be hard to explain…
“You saved me,” Tony said after a bit, trying to speak clearly around his tears. “You… why did you save me?”
“You know already?” Maria asked.
“When you, Bucky, and I go out there to head to the base, I want you just in front of us,” Steve said around a mouthful of food. “That way you can keep sharp eyes at the front while Bucky and I cover your flanks and rear.”
Tony gave a weak smile. “Silly alpha… I’m fine, just exhausted. That’ll be a different story once I’m in heat though.”
“A great idea, Tony, it really is. But what if Steve is never found? Or what if he’s found dead, not alive?”
Maria smiled. “Maybe you two could go ring shopping.”
When she was gone, Tony let out a whine, shaking more and leaning forward into Steve, taking in his scent with a moan. “I had hoped… that this could have waited a few more days. Would make this surprise mission so much easier.”
When Tony entered the lab, he slammed his designs on the main table next to all the shields his father had been working on for Steve. That stupid alpha didn’t know when he was going too far, and he had very much crossed the line of respect for Tony. How dare he accuse Tony of cheating on him! Why the hell would he ever think that? Tony was loyal, had been for months now, and suddenly Steve kisses someone else once and blames it on the omega. Typical alpha behavior! Stupid alpha!
The rest of the car ride was spent in silence. Steve was as confused as ever, but he still couldn't stop thinking about Tony. His ring had broken on impact with the ice back in 1945, and he was devastated that he didn't even have the pieces to try to put it back together. He didn't have a ring to show off anymore to say he was getting married. And hell, he worried that Tony had moved on from him and married some other alpha, had a family with that alpha and had just completely forgotten about him. He'd be heartbroken to find that out, but could he really blame Tony?
When the car was closer to the plane, Steve got out of his seat and planted his foot just outside the car door. He held his shield close to his body, chest heaving as his nerves keep his heart pounding. “Keep it steady,” he shouted at the colonel, preparing to duck under the blades propelling the plane.
Tony opened his eyes and cried as he clutched his stomach gently. He had no one to seek comfort in but his child.
Travelling along more hallways, Tony, Peggy, and the soldiers they took with them trampled down many Hydra agents. Of course some of the soldiers perished against the firepower of the ray guns that just seemed to vaporize the poor men like they were made of nothing more than dust. Down a specific hallway, Tony’s ears caught the familiar sound of Steve’s shield colliding with metal, and that made his heart race just a little bit until the next thing he heard sounded like an uncontrollable blaze of fire. Tony went into a dead sprint towards the source, Peggy trailing behind him with her gun raised and ready to shoot.
by said omega.
Steve pulled the omega’s legs apart just enough for him to slip through and crawl the rest of the way onto the cot. He braced himself with his hands over Tony, and the brunet gently squeezed his legs against Steve’s torso.
Tony noticed the nervous ticks, and he reached out to still Steve’s hands. “Something’s on your mind.”
“I told you I’d come back, Tony.” Steve pulled back and smoothed back the brunet’s hair, hand resting on Tony’s cheek. His thumb wiped away some tears.
“Come on, you’ll learn very soon.” The dark skinned alpha patted Steve’s shoulder reassuringly before continuing to guide him back to a room that was closed off from the rest of the medical facility. Several medical professionals were running in and out of the room, but with the few glimpses Steve could get inside,  his heart rate started to go up, and he let out a whine, letting his pain be known to the other alpha.
“I’m up for a dance, sure.”
“So, did you ever drink much before the serum?” Tony asked Steve, taking a sip of his whiskey.
"It'll be close to enemy lines," Steve explained. "Anyone that close is in danger. So I'm not sure if I want you to come with me."
Bucky hardly got the car parked before Tony was out and heading inside, slipping on some ice that made him lose his balance just briefly before he regained control and returned to his hurried pace. The omega ignored Bucky calling for him to slow down, because Steve was close! Steve was back in London and they could physically hold each other again, go on a proper date, spend New Year's Eve together and bring in 1944 the right way. With his thoughts running wild, Tony completely ignored everyone who spoke to him, including his own father who had gotten upset upon seeing his son away from the apartment. Tony didn’t stop looking around until finally, he saw Steve, facing away from him and hunched over a map,
“You’re sure? The people here didn’t just tell you that so you wouldn’t worry?”
When his mother had left, Tony let himself cry. He was tired and hurt and didn’t feel good at all. His day had made a turn so quickly that it had put him to bed early. He did not eat dinner that night, he had tossed and turned all through the night despite being exhausted from throwing up so much. No matter what he did, he just couldn’t get comfortable, and he wanted Steve more than ever. He wanted the comforting crooning his alpha provided when he was stressed out of his mind. He wanted those big arms to wrap around him and hold him until he felt better. Tony wanted a lot of things that pertained to his alpha, but he wasn’t going to get any of them so long as Steve was across the oceans fighting in the nasty war that demanded his attention.
The alpha scoffed. “Pathetic. Try more like an hour for me.”
“We won’t send any agents to watch over you either,” Fury added as they walked out of the room, slowly so Tony could walk on his own. “I think the captain can handle anything this city throws at him. He did throw some of our agents through a wall, after all.”
“Yeah, Nicholas helped me out quite a bit in there. He’s one of the employees.” Tony smiled back as he started walking the halls of the mall once more.
“I just wanna be with him…” Tony let himself be pulled away, another whine escaping before Peggy slapped him across the face, getting him to refocus.
“Oh my god, Steve,” Tony cried as they collided, the omega burying his face in Steve’s chest and inhaling as he let his tears stream down his face. Tony still smelled like he was in heat, but his scent was mixed with relief and happiness.
Steve shifted gingerly, taking care not to flip over the cot so they could lay on their sides together. Once they were in a more comfortable position to relax in, both sighed in unison, happy and content sighs that made them both smile. Tony had a brief thought that he was glad the cot hadn’t simply snapped under the strength of Steve’s grip in his last few thrusts.
“I… I did…”
Nodding, the beta woman smiled back and pulled the omega in for a quick hug. “We’ll talk more later. Just focus on heading out soon.”
“Right, my dad would kill me.” Tony picked up a roll of paper towels nearby and wiped himself off before handing them to Steve, putting his pants back on while his alpha cleaned up the rest of their evidence.
"Let's go up to the rooms, and we'll find a picture," Steve said, punching the button to call the elevator.
Steve got into the driver’s seat and started up the car. “Want to pick the music we listen to?” he asked Tony once they got onto the road.
Chuckling, Bucky watched the omega excitedly lock the door to the apartment and rush outside. He understood at least a little why Steve had taken a liking to Tony. It was very obvious now; the omega was an energetic guy when he was happy, and a real joy to be around. Bucky had heard about the little spat that happened when Steve had been caught kissing a beta, but to him it looked like Tony had gotten over that and was very ready to see his alpha again.
“The hell I’m not,” Tony grunted as the ringing in his ears subsided a little. “Gotta keep going. Gotta help Steve…”
“Oh my god!” Peggy hurried over to the father and son, the medic who had been with her earlier rushing into the room hoping she had found Tony.
“He just needs to get me as close as he can,” Steve said, turning to look at the map, an arm staying around Tony’s shoulders. “You know, you and Howard are going to be in a lot of trouble when you land.”
“He’s got every reason to fight, Mr. Stark,” Peggy stepped in. “From what I’ve heard, he’s capable of fighting just as well as the others.”
Steve put his hands on Tony’s shoulders to keep him in place while sliding the rest of his cock into the omega. When he was fully inside, he let Tony adjust and relax before he even dared to move. Steve knew he was large, all thanks to the serum, and he wasn’t some alpha who just took what he wanted without a care. No,he was respectful enough to give Tony time to get used to his size.
“Mr. Stark has told me it’s been tested numerous times. It should work.”
Tony waited until Peggy was far enough away to let out a louder moan he had been holding back. He reached down to the bags that belonged to Steve and fumbled with the zippers and buckles until finally one opened, revealing Steve’s casual shirts and his tan army dress clothes. The alpha might get upset if Tony ruined his dress clothes with slick and drool, so he went for a t-shirt, snatching it up and bringing it to his face to inhale deeply. Honestly, he just wanted to grab the whole bag and dump it on himself, feeling that sensation of something heavy on him that smelled like Steve. He settled for just putting the shirt on one of the pillows and rearranging all the blankets and remaining pillows into a nest, plus adding some more of Steve’s shirts to make it smell better. Soon he had a sturdy nest built, and he collapsed into it after shedding most of his clothes.
“So that should be the very last one. The last head to destroy? Or the body I guess. However that story of the hydra goes.”
Tony thought he had been doing well since his mother had taken care of him. He’d been drinking enough water, eating right, getting exercise when he felt extra good. He’d been doing everything right for nearly three weeks. He truly had been living the best life he could without Steve being around. Tony had felt happy and healthy, despite missing his alpha. He had blamed everything that had happened after Steve left on depression, because it was a plausible explanation. It was the only thing that made sense, in his mind, that made him feel terrible.
“I know,” Steve said, looking at the floor and fidgeting with his hands. “I know you probably will choose not to believe any word I say, and I understand. If I was in your position, I’d feel the same way.”
"Nah, I'll be fine. A little rain never hurt anyone. Except the wicked witch of the West, of course."
“There, now, you’ll be alright,” Jarvis reassured. “Your mother is waiting back at the manor. She made sure that I made your favorite meal.”
Tony caught just the smallest hint of Steve’s scent as he walked in, and briefly he thought that the alpha might be home already, but the scent was dead and fading, and Tony sighed sadly. He hoped that soon he would be able to be with Steve again soon.
"Fantastic. Hopefully we can get Tony healthy again soon." Howard kissed his wife's cheek before he helped her up from his lap, then he stood up and sighed.
Maria nodded. “I knew I smelled something different on you, but I’m glad to know that it’s Steve that I was smelling. Did you two bond?”
Tony followed Steve, like a duckling following its mother. He was silent, his hands in his pockets as he looked up at the sky. More rain… just what they needed. Add more gloom onto the already gloomy day in Italy.
“Yeah, kind of hard to ban me from the places I’m required to be granted access for the classes my dad was paying good money for me to take.”
“I like a good classic burger. I’m kind of a plain Jane when it comes to being adventurous with food.”
"I'll make sure the both of you get what you want," the alpha said. "Anything at all, you let me know what you need and I'll get it for you."
“Okay, so not Peggy. You can’t move out with your mom because she lives with your dad, you’d never move in with Colonel Phillips…”
“I’ll throw a tantrum if he tries.”
“They want you to go to Italy? Like, right next to enemy lines basically?”
“Everyone is staring at me…” Tony tried to make himself look smaller, though he kept his gaze on his alpha, who made him flush by complimenting him so much. The omega thought his heart might burst in his chest.
It took Tony maybe another half hour to finish getting ready for the party. While he picked out a pair of shoes, he almost had an overwhelming desire to just throw on his boots and not give a damn that they didn’t match his outfit. He wanted to be back with his friends in the Howling Commandos, truthfully, but he knew he had to wait until Steve was called back to duty to see them again. It wasn’t that much longer, he told himself, slipping on a pair of heeled shoes than made him a little taller. Soon. Soon he would be back with his friends.
Those few weeks seemed to fly by as Christmas drew closer. Maria and Jarvis were quite busy with planning another big party to host, since it was common of the Starks to throw a huge party at nearly any big holiday. Tony made sure to stay away from the planning as much as possible, unless his smart mind was needed. Party planning wasn’t his forte, so he just stayed in his room with Steve most of the time and worked on invention designs. One of the more recent designs he had become obsessed with was the arc reactor that his uniform donned. It was probably going to need an upgrade as soon as he and Steve returned to London, so it was better to start working on designs before he was able to handle his uniform again.
Steve’s eyes also grew wet with tears, holding his omega close and crooning softly. “I’ll take care of you, Tony,” he said after a while. “Don’t you worry, I’ll take care of you until the day we die.”
“Your heat is coming soon.”
“Carter, Stark, get up here! We’re trying to establish a link with Rogers.”
“Yeah, well I think we can take partial blame for that,” Steve said. “We did clear you for fighting even though you weren’t fully healed quite yet.”
“Can’t be too cautious though. I’m sure he goes wild when you dress up nice for him.”
“Do you think they’ll have any new shipments of clothes today?” Maria asked as they entered the mall, arms linked together.
“Well, I’m glad you have some new clothes to wear for Steve now. I’m sure he’ll love them.”
Somehow Tony stayed awake through the whole plane ride, though he remained feeling numb. His eyes stared out the window, emotionless, red, and dried up. How his heart ached for Steve to come back with that bright smile on his face and his blond hair just slightly out of its normal style. Tony would have given anything to bring Steve back, but there was nothing he could give. Tony was alone without his alpha once more, and he hadn’t realized until that moment just how much he had changed in the time he had known Steve.
Phillips didn’t waste time to smash the button that Tony had pointed to. The car’s engine roared and it surged forward, once again gaining on the plane that was so close to leaving the runway.
“I’ve been waiting for two weeks to see you again, of course I’m eager.” Smirking, the omega sank to his knees and nuzzled Steve’s crotch teasingly.
“I’m sorry, but you know I have to.” Steve hugged Tony again, the hug lasting longer than the last one did. He tried to wrap Tony in his scent as much as he could, nuzzling the omega’s head, then his neck a little at the scent gland there.
When the day finally came for Steve, Bucky, and Howard to come home, Tony made himself a little more presentable than he normally did. He didn’t bother with the button up shirts and suspenders that day, trading them in for the first top he had found in the store at the mall back in May. Tony had worn that top for his birthday, and also for Steve’s, and while he was dressing, Tony was reminded yet again that they both missed being with each other on the days they turned yet another year older.
As he thought about what he’d do once he was free from the painting, his phone began to vibrate in his pocket, silently letting him know that he was receiving a call.
“But you do want to get married?”
. Of course the store was perfectly fine to betas, but to Tony, it was drab and boring and it set him on edge just a little from not having a distinct scent.
“Sounds like a lot of bull to me, Smartass.”
Slipping behind the screen, Steve set his uniform on the bench next to Tony’s civilian clothes before pulling the omega into a gentle kiss. It wasn’t hidden very well, because Tony may have been just short of the screen, but Steve practically towered over it. Regardless, Tony pressed closer to his alpha with a sigh, closing his eyes while he kissed Steve. He could feel the alpha shake just slightly, a hint of sadness filling Steve’s scent, no doubt as the alpha thought of Bucky.
“I know you love me more than a machine.”
“I understand the pressure of being under deadlines,” Steve sympathized. “Hopefully your projects aren’t too hard on you.”
“You’re not going with Captain Rogers, but you can watch me work for a while if that will make you happy.”
"If we can ever get past this war."
“So you’re staying here in the United States for now,” Tony asked.
“Hydra’s goal is to change society for the better, and unfortunately some people don’t see that. When Hydra rises, they will be punished accordingly, and omegas will rise through the ranks equivalent to alphas. Equality for all omegas is a top priority.” Steve smiled and tilted his head to the side. “So what do you say, Tony?”
“Well, whenever he comes down, he has pancakes waiting.”
Still dazed from sleep, Tony got up and stumbled to the door, opening it to find his father.
“The sixth one was about… here, 30 or 40 miles west of the Maginot Line.” Steve stood up straight as the agent standing next to him took away the map he had been marking on, causing him to switch his attention to something else. He settled on Peggy.
“Then you know that’s not true.”
That got a happy noise out of the omega, but also got a few tears to be shed. Tony was glad Steve didn’t see them. “That… you don’t know how happy that makes me.” Tony’s voice cracked with emotion, betraying himself.
“What about mind-blowing sex?”
“I… I guess one dance won’t hurt.”
“Sounds good,” Steve agreed.
Peggy narrowed her eyes a little. “Well, he’s here at the hospital. He wanted to see you as well, but I think that can wait until tomorrow.”
“Wait, what? But alphas never…”
Steve’s hands very quickly flew to Tony’s hips as he woke up, a low throaty groan filling the room as his blue eyes focused on Tony. A new wave of his rut hit him all at once, and then he was growling as he made Tony move faster, demanding that the omega keep up with his seemingly insatiable need.
There was a lot more silence that Tony was anticipating, but he still didn’t like how it dragged on without Steve saying anything. The blond had gone back to eating, though Tony could tell he was tense by the way his jaw was set. When Tony thought he wasn’t going to get an answer, he drank more of his wine and started eating again. Somehow he knew he was going to get this reaction.
Steve’s words faded into sobs as he and his omega hugged tightly. There didn’t need to be anymore words between the two in that moment. They understood their apologies and forgiveness. Steve and Tony didn’t have any care in the world at that point. They were finally back together again, after over 60 years of being apart, alpha and omega were reunited, and they had no intentions of parting again until one of them died at an old age.
“Go choke on a dick,” Tony hissed, trying with all his might to fight back, break free as he heard Peggy cry out for him.
you, Tony. You misinterpret what I wanted to suggest.” Steve reached out to grab Tony’s arm, but the omega smacked it away.
Tony wanted to go to the locker room to change, but Steve’s scent hit him like a wall as soon as he stepped in the room, and his eyes grew wet all over again. He couldn’t stand to be there with the scent of his alpha surrounding him when Steve wasn’t going to ever come back. So he fled the locker room, trying to find a quiet place to hide. He settled in the bathroom first, but that proved to be a bad spot as there were more people going in and out than he liked. The next place he hid was a closet, and he didn’t like how several people were calling out his name, probably medics who wanted to help him.
“I absolutely promise. Maybe I’ll stay locked inside you longer because you’re such a perfect match for me.” Steve crooned with a hint of a growl, nuzzling Tony’s jawline and attempting to scent again.
Tony whined happily, “No takes-backsies. I get your knot for at least an hour now! It’s mine to sit on!” he said, wiggling so that it tugged at his overly sensitive entrance, successfully drawing a whine from himself.
The first day of training and taking the pills occurred the same day as the prescription was filled and the meeting occurred. Tony was started immediately on weight training, working on building up his muscles to handle the intensity of the coming days of training. He started with small weights of course, but eventually he knew he would be able to lift just as much as the rare beta soldiers could. His pills worked wonderfully as well, helping keep his omegan hormones at bay when his scheduled heat was pushed to the side. Without those hormones taking over his body, he was able to build up more muscle mass quickly. He soon saw improvements over the weeks he lifted weights, the second week consisting of both weight and endurance training. The once thin and slightly built omega soon turned into an omega ready to kick ass and take names. In most physical ways, he looked more like a beta, thanks to both his training and the pills. This was a new freedom that he hadn’t experienced before but was enjoying greatly.
“Don’t just guess, Tony. Know.” Peggy lifted Tony’s head and offered a worried smile. “Promise me you won’t fight again until the baby is born.”
"They certainly are," Steve agreed. "I was a soldier alongside some of those types of alphas unfortunately. Real dickheads."
Steve came for a long time, a new wave of cum shooting into Tony after the tiniest bit of movement, and the omega couldn't say that he hated being absolutely filled to the brim with Steve’s cum. The two eventually calmed down to simple moans and little whimpers when the alpha pulled against Tony’s hole locking him in. Soon they were just laying there, Steve on top of Tony and breathing deeply with heavy eyelids. Tony wasn’t going to complain about having Steve put his full weight on top of him. Keeping the alpha right where he was, was more than comfortable for the spent omega. Tony didn’t think of anything other than satisfaction, and how amazing Steve was.
“His ring isn’t working.”
“He probably doesn’t like that you’re taller than him now,” Tony said. “You alphas do tend to be sensitive about that kind of stuff.”
“You keep saying Hydra...isn’t that some mythical beast from Greece or something? Lots of heads that grow back?”
was more than perfect.
“Peggy,” He said, catching the attention of the beta as they headed up the radio tower inside the Hydra base’s hangar. “I wanna talk now.”
Tony inhaled unsteadily as Steve wiped away more of his tears. He grabbed his alpha’s wrist when Steve’s hand rested on his cheek. “I know… I was happy about the baby, but…”
"Oh gosh, are you alright Tony?" Steve took his hand back quickly with a panicked tone to his voice.
“Thank you, Mr. Stark.” Steve sat down next to Tony, briefly glancing at him before focusing on Howard putting everything on the table. “I hope it wasn’t too much trouble that I dropped by unexpectedly.”
Tony swallowed, trying to ignore the blood soaking into his uniform and making him shiver. He needed to tell Peggy about the baby soon, because there was the possibility that he could pass out any time from blood loss. Not that he had felt like he had lost a lot of blood. His uniform already felt stiff, like the blood was dying and scabbing already.
“Sorry I’m so late, Pep! I lost track of time, and…”
“Really, Steve? You’re saying I’m misinterpreting the way you’re telling me you might leave me here in the US while you go overseas where there are other omegas out there who would
Once they were home, Tony made a beeline for his room. He grabbed the drawing of he and his alpha that Steve had given him and propped it up near his bed. Then he gathered all the blankets, pillows, and clothes he could find to form up a nest that faintly scented like Steve, but it was just enough to eventually soothe the mourning omega to sleep. If he closed his eyes, he could almost imagine Steve’s arms wrapped around him and hands gently resting on his slowly growing stomach.
“You’re late,” Peggy said as Colonel Phillips walked away.
"Sounds to me like you'd rather help people than bomb them."
“He doesn’t need a good alpha, he needs a strict alpha who knows what’s best for him.” a new voice stated.
“Tony’s alpha was in rut in December,” Maria said, sighing in what almost sounded like relief as she rubbed her face.
“Good to meet you, too.” Bruce nodded, shrugging out of his jacket and hanging it on the coat rack by the door before moving over to sit down in the recliner, “Welcome to the craziness of our little circle of friends. Tony’s not the only energetic one that livens things up, you’ll find. My fiancé is just as loud.”
“Nope, I’m just a hopeless omega with a weak heart and a dead unborn baby, apparently.” Tony muttered into his mostly empty glass. He tipped it back, draining the rest before setting the glass down a little too hard on the counter, his knuckles white as they gripped the now empty glass. “Bastard never lets me forget that pain. Loves to remind me.”
“Yeah, it’s called winning a war,” the colonel said, placing his hands on his hips.
Steve scoffed. “I keep forgetting I’m an alpha now. I don’t really… feel different mostly. I mean there were some obvious changes, but other than those, I feel the same… Okay maybe not exactly the same. I was really sick before the serum. Now I’m as healthy as a horse.”
Tony soon fell asleep with the faint scent of his alpha surrounding him. A calm washed over him as he slept. His dreams were surprisingly nice, visions of reuniting with Steve after being gone for so long, scenes of Steve meeting their child for the first time, though grown up quite a bit. Tony’s mind was put at ease, as if Steve’s spirit was soothing the omega and telling him that everything was going to be alright. In his dreams, Tony was happier than he had ever been, and each new scene he experienced put him in a more relaxed state until he no longer had any dreams, and he was left in a deep sleep for the rest of the day and well into the night.
Tony nodded and led the way (with some directional help from Steve) to the checkout where he paid and helped gather their bags before heading back out to the limo.
“Good thing I’m here to talk to you. You’d get bored so easily.” Steve smiled down at his omega.
Tony sighed as he stepped back to Steve and wrapped his arms around him. “I’m so glad you’re back,” he said in a soft voice.
Tony shivered. “I hope that won’t happen… but I know what I have to do, and I won’t hesitate to give my life up if it’s necessary.”
Tony looked up at Steve and frowned. “I don’t want to talk to you.”
“Ruts can make omegas go into heat if they happen before the scheduled heat,” Steve said, taking one of Tony’s hands and wrapping it up in both of his. “I’d at least hope you’re starting to have urges to nest again.”
After Steve left, Tony stayed on the bed a moment, letting out a breath. “...I want his knot again…” he muttered before rolling off the bed and starting to gather his clothing from the day before. Not bothering to put them on, he slipped out the hidden back door that took him to the back of the club where small dorms were located for the omegas who worked there.
“Yes, we just need to find Steve and we’ll be fine.” Peggy led the way towards the back of the bar, looking around with sharp eyes, discouraging any alphas from making a move. She moved her head suddenly towards a hallway that lead to another part of the bar.
Tony nodded and closed his eyes, whining as she left. It felt like an eternity before she returned, water and soup in hand, because that was all she could do until she knew what exactly was wrong with her son.
When breakfast was finally done, the four moved into the parlor with plates of food and glasses filled with coffee and juice. They settled down and simply enjoyed the food and soft music playing. There was simply nothing to worry about but if the eggs needed more salt or if the coffee was still too hot to drink. It was a simple time for the four residents of the Stark manor, and there wasn’t honestly anything that could have broken the happy mood.
“Right, come here then.” She gestured her hand for Tony to follow back to her bedroom closet. Surprisingly, it wasn’t full of dresses and military uniforms like Tony had thought it would be. In fact, there were several pairs of pants in the closet, none of which looked like they had been worn for a while.
“He shouldn’t be too much longer.”
“Nah, there’s no point. Just make them. You do make some pretty good cheeseburgers anyways.”
January 30th was the day that Tony went to the omega clinic to get his checkup. He had to say he felt a bit awkward, seeing several frail omegas who were in various states of pregnancy. They all looked like Tony would win against them in a fight, which he hated to compare himself to them, but he was the only omega there that was as fit and built in muscle as he was. He wondered if any of the omegas thought he was a beta.
“Better not be a quick-releaser. I want to keep it right where it is—right where it belongs.” the omega purred.
Most omegas found Steve attractive, but he found only a few to his own liking.
“To a point,” Fury confirmed. “We also know how and when your parents died, if you’d care to know that information.”
"If you really want to go home, sure. I don't want you to feel worse than you already do." Steve leaned in to nuzzle Tony and croon slightly. "We can go tell Pepper what happened before we go, so she isn't disappointed."
“I’m fine, I don’t feel any pain now,” Tony said with a smile.
After a little bit of holding the intense stare, Steve shifted and slid one leg off the cot. He made slow movements to grab Tony and turn him over, Tony easily following his alpha’s wordless instructions and sliding onto his stomach. He started to sit up, back turned to Steve, but he was quickly deterred from sitting up when Steve gave a sharp “No,” with his alpha tone coming through. Tony obeyed without any hesitation, though he did whine when Steve didn't touch him after that. The omega was forced to trust Steve, as he could not see what Steve was doing very well when faced away from him.
The alpha laughed and opened the door. "Good, we wouldn't be able to get pajamas without it."
“Jesus, Peggy, make some more noise next time…” He groaned low as he relaxed again.
“I’d practice right now with you, but I feel it’d come out too much like a purr right now. I’ll practice with Pepper later.”
Phillips raised an eyebrow before walking away, looking over the papers he was given.
Steve was starting to move his hips on his own, despite having Tony’s hand on his hip. The hand was barely doing anything against him. The omega learned quickly to stop moving his head and let the alpha do the work, which he appreciated. His neck was getting tired from moving, so having Steve move was a relief for him. The longer they went, the closer Steve got to his orgasm, and the more he groaned out as he cupped his hands around both sides of the omega’s face. He watched as Tony quickened the hand that he was using to jack himself off, noting the little noises he was making around Steve’s cock.
“How bad?”
“Oh yeah? That’s great! I mean, not that your friend lost an arm, that’s horrible, but it’s great to have that confirmation that veterans in need are getting the Stark tech I donate to help make their lives a little better after all that stuff overseas beats them down. I still get a lot of backlash for closing Stark Industries' weapons department in order to open the medical tech department. I just want to help make the world a better place but so many people think I’m just too soft. Uncle Obie—uh, not my real uncle, he just was always like an uncle to me as a kid—he’s not happy with my changes to the company. I know he’s just worried but it wears me down when he keeps bringing up wanting to reopen the weapons department, you know? So it’s nice to hear that my changes are out there helping people.”
“Oh wow… I didn’t know you had these. You never wear anything like this.” Tony carefully took the box and looked over the gems.
When they landed in London, the rain was falling harder than when they were on the plane. The snow on the roads were being melted into slush by the rain. It wasn’t a warm rain by any means. It was cold and heavy and dark. It was the complete opposite type of rain that fell the night Steve and Tony had their first A&W date. This rain felt like it would never stop.
Tony hurried away, wanting nothing but to hear Steve’s voice and know he was okay. That was all that mattered to him. Running up the stairs, Tony’s arc reactor bounced around on the straps that barely held it only the uniform, and every time the reactor got a little bit further away from his chest, he winced, a little bit of pain shooting through his chest. He ignored it though, because the pain went away when he was still once more, pacing about the room and chewing on his thumbnail as he waited, as they all waited for Steve to radio in.
“That’s the sacrifice of war though, isn’t it? You give up your life for fighting what you believe in,” Tony responded, standing up to his father with a serious expression. “You can’t make me stay here anymore, Dad. I’m a soldier in this war as much as any of the other Howling Commandos are.”
Reaching the forty-fifth floor, the blond stepped out of the elevator and took in his new surroundings.
“If you don’t want to work on it, I will.”
“Please, don’t do this, Steve. We have time, we can work it out!”
“Yeah, no, Ty and Justin both are a firm no. Anyone else I could politely dance with so long as it’s not so many people that I end up neglecting my actual date.” Tony said firmly. “I didn’t drag my boyfriend here so he can stand by the wall hoping for some time with me.”
Huffing, Tony sat down on one of the boxes. “Fine, but only because Steve will yell at me if I don’t.”
Jarvis put a hand on Maria’s shoulder before she had a chance to say anything more. “He won’t be happy if he stays here while his alpha suffers,” he stated. “And who knows what will happen to the captain? If Tony is there to help him grieve, then it’s best that Tony goes.”
The omega seemed to struggle with himself for a bit, but then he nodded while biting his bottom lip. “Okay… I’ll go in…. You won’t go anywhere, will you? I don’t know if I’ll be comfortable enough to stay in there for too long.”
"Yeah, actually. Our relationship got a lot better after… after you disappeared."
“It’s worth a try, isn’t it? You can’t say you’d rather stay here to make Stone a bunch of money.”
Steve held his breath. It had been so long, and he was afraid of what he’d see in that room. Tony barely alive and trapped in an iron lung that was keeping him alive? Tony as an old man hooked up to life support and as frail as a piece of paper? So many possibilities ran through his head, but not one of them was even close to  what Steve was about to see, the condition his lovely omega was in after over sixty years of being apart.
Okay, he technically
Time felt slow as Howard worked and worked to save his son. Blood was far up his arms and on his shirt as he worked, trying to keep himself calm as he performed such an unpracticed medical procedure on Tony. It was the only quick way Tony could be saved, even if it was taking longer than Howard had anticipated. Racing against the clock, the beta worked and put aside his feelings, putting that true Stark brainpower to use as he came up with solutions to problems on the fly. There were so many things that could have gone wrong, and yet, everything Howard was doing yielded the least amount of blood and carving possible.
Tony looked up at him and nodded, “Can you text Happy for me? I’m not sure my words will come out in any known language right now…”
"Well I hope I'll make a good impression, then."
happy, Steve.” Tony smiled before sipping his drink.
The alpha then gave his few gifts to Maria and Jarvis, thanking them for being so welcoming and nice to him. He had truly felt like part of the family the past few months he had spent in the Stark manor, and it made him happier than he had been since his own mother passed away. It felt good to be a family member again.
“Tony, it’s okay,” Maria soothed, grabbing his hands to still them. “I should have suspected, because you have a lot of the symptoms I had when I was pregnant with you.”
Tony cried out, losing control of his volume completely, “
The new guy was another omega with dark curly hair, though he seemed more reserved than Tony was. He also was wearing glasses that he pushed up his nose as he looked at Steve. “Who’s the new guy?”
Maria came up behind him with Howard, and the three hugged before the woman moved over to the piano and played a classical piece for Tony for the last time. It was difficult to listen to, but Tony sat on the sofa with his father, listening to the beautiful song as the last hour of his birthday passed. Tony had no regrets in his decision, but knowing he would never get to hear his mother play for him again, never get to tinker with machines beside his father again, never see Jarvis and joke with him again, it all came crashing down on the omega as he sat on that sofa, and he cried until his throat hurt and his eyes were dry.
Maria nodded in understanding. “Meet me in the garage when you’re ready. It’s just going to be you and me today.”
Tony nodded, “Best out of what this place offers. They need to work on their color selection for alphas. It’s so limited! I mean, so is the omega section once you start looking at the sizes, but at a glance they have many options.”
Steve burst into what looked like a lobby packed with people dressed in all black. He thought that maybe they were Hydra, but he couldn’t locate the organization’s symbol before he was suddenly being chased after. Running between what he assumed were agents, he knocked a few aside as he escaped the building and ran out into the rainy New York day.
Tony sighed and looked at the ground. “I have a feeling I won’t be going on another mission for a long time. My dad is going to kill me.”
“My tough little omega.” Steve smiled and was about to lean down to kiss Tony when Peggy interrupted again.
Howard sighed. “Well, you’re not wrong. That baby’s life is precious, after all. Part of Steve makes up the baby.”
Tony gave a small, weak smile and pressed into Steve’s side, pointedly ignoring Obadiah as they passed the man on their way out.
When the two omegas arrived at Steve's parked car, the alpha was already standing there, a leather jacket over his blue button up and a pair of sunglasses protecting his eyes from the morning sun. He turned to look at Clint and Tony, unlocking his car and opening the trunk. "Put your things back here. It's a bit of a drive to Hydra, so make yourselves comfortable."
Thanks for reading, everyone.
“We’ll just have to look. And who knows, maybe we’ll both get lucky and find something we both like.”
Steve turned his head to look at who had called his name, and instantly a smile broke out on his face. He ignored what had occupied him before and approached the brunet rather quickly, stopping just short of the omega, still keeping his respect for Tony’s space.
When everyone had finished their lunch and had prepared their equipment, Steve rallied them all together, going over the plan one last time before he led them out of the camp. A silence fell amongst the pack of alphas, all of them switching over to soldier mode and watching each other’s backs. Even Tony slipped into a similar mindset, holding his gun close to his body while glancing around while at the front of the pack. Silently they moved through the woods, moving as one machine when Steve and Bucky gave out orders for the others to spread out. Soon the pack was forming a large line behind Tony, Bucky, and Steve, letting them take control of the mission and guide them to the base.
"Sorry I've been taking so long here. The guys know how to put away their drinks. I guess they're just recovering from having been held captive for a while."
“Exactly. My only regret is that it took me so long to realize it and actually take the steps towards change for the company.”
Tony cried silently as he received a string of vibrations from his ring, thinking of how badly Steve had wanted to stay with him instead of return to London.
“Well… It looks like you made clean incisions. Not quite as good as a practiced hand, but remarkably well. If he hasn’t lost too much blood yet, he may survive.” The medic crouched down and felt for Tony’s pulse, pleased to find that it was steady and normal. “From what’s on the floor, I don’t think he passed out from blood loss. Was he passed out when you got to him?”
The blond didn’t take long, knowing how much Tony loved cheeseburgers and knowing how hungry the both of them were after only having a light lunch. He was in and out of the changing room in a flash, sporting his tan army dress shirt, pants and tie. Tony wasn’t too fond of the outfit, but they got respect wherever they went because of the outfit, so it was good for something at least.
Steve pulled out a chair for Tony at their table, pushing it in when the omega had taken his seat. “You look like you’re not sure how to feel,” he said as he took his own seat. “Is this okay?”
“I didn’t know you were coming over here,” Steve whispered to his omega, holding Tony as close as possible.
Tony felt numb. It wasn't from not taking his pill that day, because he took it in the mornings usually, so he had taken his pill for the day, but his body would most likely start going into heat the next morning once it realized there wasn't a suppressant pill taken. Tony knew that was going to suck a lot, but at least he could stay with Steve. He
“Of course I can take care of myself! I’m a Stark, I know how to get around.”
“Ok, give me your coordinates and I’ll get you a safe landing site.” Tony started looking over the instruments around the radio as he spoke, hands shaking.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and smiled. "Let's go, then. I haven't played Mario Kart in ages, so I'm ready to get my butt kicked."
“Mind if I cut in?”
Everyone looked hopefully at the blond alpha waiting to hear his response.
Almost as soon as their joy of the new year ended, Steve was sent on another mission to take down a larger Hydra base located in Belgium. While he was gone, Tony approached his dad and spent many days in the lab with him. Tony had a plan brewing, one that he was sure his father wouldn’t approve of, and maybe even Steve wouldn’t approve. It was a risky plan, one that Tony planned to bring up on the date the two would be having as soon as Steve got back to London. Thankfully he didn’t have to wait too long for his alpha to return, because Steve was hurrying home with the Howling Commandos as quick as he was allowed. Tony got word mere hours after the base had been destroyed that the soldiers were already on their way home. Quick and to the point, the brunet had thought to himself that day.
The Howling Commandos cheered as they crowded around the omega soldier, congratulating him on completing a very basic version of basic training. All excitement aside, Tony was out for blood now, and it wouldn’t be long before he was in Czechoslovakia fighting beside his alpha and finally feeling useful.
Everyone in the room turned to Steve, looking at him like he was crazy for suggesting the plan. Even Tony was a bit surprised that Steve wanted to go in guns blazing, but he put his hands on Steve’s shoulders instead, looking at him expectantly.
“You sure don’t act like the all-American posterboy that was Captain America. Pretty sure he was the type who would be too nervous to enter a place full of scantily clad omegas, and here you are, sitting between the legs of one, paying to get your knot sat on.”
.” Those being his last words, Tony stormed away into the lab, leaving Steve to think about what he had said and regret every word.
“Tony, please come inside,” Maria interrupted. “We can talk more over dinner, yeah?”
“I got here just as he passed out. I acted as fast as I could…”
A low growl came from Steve’s throat. “If you’re still willing, I’d very much like for you to sit on my knot.”
Tony cried until his throat was raw and he could barely breathe, his whole body shaking as he felt cold. He stared at the floor long after he couldn’t cry any more, hugging himself and struggling to keep himself from going into a full blown panic attack, though he was mostly in one already. It was impossible for him stop as he realized how much he had been sweating, despite feeling cold. He had to get medical attention… but he was too broken to do so. He didn’t move himself from that chair in case, by some miracle, Steve came back on the radio asking for help. But the request never came, and Tony felt numb.
“You have no idea, Mom. He gave me his dog tags to bring back home so I could have something of his while we were apart.” Tony pulled out the dog tags and looked at the name on them with a fond smile. “But I did go to Europe with him… and I’m sorry I didn’t tell you until much later. I should have told you sooner.”
"Of course I did. I couldn't not accept them. I am pretty into you, after all."
“Tony, Steve!” Rhodey said when the couple got closer. “Glad to see you two made it.”
“Alpha!
“Finally?” Clint asked, stepping out ahead of the obvious new couple and settling himself next to the other alpha.
“Just to be sure,” Steve said. “You’re doing this to help in the war, not just to be by my side for the rest of it?”
"Well, I do like when omegas wear little lacy things underneath their normal clothes. Gets me excited knowing they've got something pretty on that no one else can see. But really you don't have to do anything for me if you don't feel like it. I'm not going to force you to do anything for me."
Tony smiled. "Let's see how many agents I can piss off by joining you."
When he got to the locker room, without anyone seeing him thankfully, Tony sat on the bench in the screened off area he had put on his uniform in before. It smelled like Steve, which made Tony feel a little bit better, but his chest was hurting again, as well as his stomach. He tried to sit upright as he looked over his blood soaked uniform. He groaned at the sight, noting for future reference that red was a bad color for his uniform. Sighing, Tony kicked his boots off, and he almost fell off the bench from the simple action. There was something wrong with him, and he really didn’t feel good the more he thought about it. His stomach churned and his chest hurt with a pain that felt physical and emotional, which of course made sense to him. He had just lost his alpha, whom he was mated to, and that bond alone was painful to have when one side of that bond died. Tony wanted to scream, but his throat hurt too much to make any sound. He remained silent, thinking, mourning as he took parts of  his uniform off. He just wanted to get into comfortable clothes and curl up with his mother, maybe have her read him a story and sleep in his bed with him, just so he didn’t feel so alone.
"Oh trust me, I'm not new to the area. But… I could go for friends and drinks. Been getting tired of just painting and then going straight home."
“Okay, you can rest then. I won’t make you do more than you can handle.” Howard stood up and took Tony’s bowl, then he gave his son a small kiss on the forehead. “I’ll leave your water in here for you to drink.”
“Right now I’m in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer, a lot of people are going to die.”
There was a kind smile on the doctor’s face as he pulled up a chair and sat next to the bed. “So, I heard we’ve got a sick omega. What kind of symptoms are we having?”
Peggy helped Tony lay down on the cot he was provided with; all the blankets and pillows he had used piled around him. She wiped a cool cloth over his forehead. “I’m going to leave now, but your tent will be protected all night long, okay?”
“Depends on how well I know the omega. I typically start off rough with a new omega, because from my experience, omegas are practically horny all the time. But you are different from others.” Steve smirked at Tony, eyes roaming over the small frame of the omega.
Clint frowned, “Tony, you know I don’t like having to share alphas…”
Tests and examinations were done on Tony before the nurses cleaned him up and an IV drip was inserted into his arm before he and his parents were left alone once more. Pain medication soon kicked in, thanks to the IV, and Tony was soon feeling physically comfortable again, but emotionally he was completely destroyed. There was no quick recovery from the emotional trauma the omega had experienced, and it showed. Tony lay in the hospital bed, staring up at the ceiling as his tears rolled down the sides of his face. He had nothing left of Steve, and that was devastating on its own. Losing that last bit of Steve that Tony had been clinging to left him without hope or a will to live.
“You look exhausted,” Howard stated, looking over his son. “And cold.”
Steve plus acting like a proper alpha plus Tony realizing he had overthought things equals the two of them going to Italy together as alpha and omega.
Tony was curled up under a pile of blankets and shirts, all the shirts belonging to Steve, though they had long lost their scent of the alpha. The omega’s usually bright and curious eyes were dull and sad, puffy from bouts of crying throughout the day. It was a sight that broke Howard’s heart, but he knew his pain of seeing his son so sick was nothing compared to the heartache that Tony was experiencing. The poor omega was paler than his sheets and thinner than he had ever been. He looked like he was barely alive. The only sign that Howard had to know his son was still alive was the omega’s gaze switching from the wall to the new visitor.
