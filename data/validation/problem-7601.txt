A sniffle was picked up by the unkind acoustics of the room. Rhodey had sunk his face into his hands. With a start, Tony realized this was the first time Rhodey had seen them since their deaths.
His burnt hand seared with pain; he had gripped the blade he had meant to shave with so tightly it had dug into his slowly healing palm. At this hiss, Bucky looked up. He was polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside the boot, the other blacking it. Muttering about seeing to a doctor, Steve set down the bloodstained blade and left the office.
Half the room jumped on their seats; Bucky had struck his fist down onto the table.
from the rest of the room…
Tony thought of the house, of rooms he had been carried away from by a nurse; he thought of mysterious objects never explained to him, and the scolding he had got when he’d tried to figure them out himself, and resentment swelled in his chest. Why had Howard done it? Had he ever wished for a child in the first place? Or had Tony been nothing more than a testimony of his supreme intellect, a document to bring out whenever its contents suited him best?
Tony laughed. They had reached his car; he jumped over the closed door onto the driver’s seat. As he double-clutched, Rhodey opened and closed the passenger side door, sliding in with a creak of dipping leather.
Strucker begun to pace in front of their table. “Were you, er, left with any … physical effects?”
“I’m not going,” Steve said.
Steve woke up early on a Thursday, wrapped up in his sheets. A sliver of sky was visible between the curtain and the sill; it was the cool pink of an overcast sunrise, and everything was quiet. He rolled over in bed so that he was lying across the mattress sideways, gearing up to light the fireplace at the chill coming to rest over his exposed skin. Discontented, he lifted his head from the crook of his arm and then realized what he was doing: searching the air for sounds of life.
Down underground, surrounded by four walls, he finally let himself feel a thrill of dread; his immediate thought was that someone keeping watch of the house, surely, would use his solitude as an opportunity? And at once came the dispiriting realisation that even if something happened, he would neither be heard nor believed. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in … and as Tony moved deeper into the workshop, he heard a scurrying of disturbed mice.
“It’s made of bricks and mortar,” she said gently. “How could it be alive?”
Above him, a floorboard creaked.
Tony, face bloody and twisted into a grimace that was half-pain, half-venom, was holding the runaway bulb.
“Do you know where he went?” Steve asked abruptly, hiding his mouth behind a long sip.
Beside him, Rhodey was saying, “I can’t believe I’ve got to save your skin every time. First Sunset, then Tiberius—”
“We had nice times together, didn’t we, Anthony?”
[2] I loved writing Rhodey for the first time, but he had to go or there would be no story to tell: he is canonly about 99% of Tony's self-control, after all, and that's why I wrote him acting like the White Guy in every horror movie ever. Sorry.
“You’re just—you’re so—you have no idea how to act in a relationship, do you?” Tony said abruptly, and then shook his head, “I don’t know why I thought this would be easy.”
Steve followed his eyes to the scar on his palm. “Ish.”
“Stane doesn’t
“Well, there was a rogue window, but—” another ring, another denial “ — just take a look yourself, this is hundreds of acres of land. A lot of things happen here that I’m not aware of — ”
Tony streaked down the country lane.
Here, Rhodey, who had been looking gradually more and more uncomfortable at being waited on, took the plunge, and said, “What if I took—”
“Maybe later,” answered Bucky. “But you’d think the glamor of war would’ve dimmed some by now, right? I just don’t get it, it’s not like there’s something special in him. Remember Tony? All he did was bat those lashes and this fella—” Bucky shoved a thumb at Steve, “—stood there, paralyzed. Next thing we know he’s put a ring on it.”
On the evening of day three, they reached the train stuck on the other side of the summit; it had stayed to linger around a tiny station sixty miles off Sacramento. Here, they persuaded the engine driver to turn back to San Francisco Bay, and from there, they took a ferry from Oakland Pier to the city itself. The shortest way to the factory took them through the very heart of San Francisco, where they were swept along by the rush of horse-drawn carriages and carts.
He then whipped his walking stick out of the Constable’s hands, turning the action into a fierce full stop, before ducking into a waiting car. His barking directions to his chauffer were cut off by the slam of the door.
Her face was as pale as her voice was grave.
“No more than usual,” answered Natasha diplomatically, then she eyed him. “You think one of them is a possible suspect? You’ll have to tread carefully, Steve, our economy suffered big enough a hit when the bridge went down—we can’t afford to lose more visitors.”
Fury hesitated.
Steve’s heart skipped a beat.
“I’m sorry,” Clint put in loudly, “did you say,
Steve’s own eyes flew open as he was shaken awake by a sound; on his right, Clint had broken open his rifle and was reloading it. The trembles of a dying body turned into the vibration of the speeding train. Outside the window, landscapes changed rapidly, and smoke flied past in wisps as the engine thundered; Steve could see the chimney whenever the tracks bent to the left.
Steve, who couldn’t help but notice the girl looked at his father with the amount of awe Scott bestowed upon Steve, smiled. While he wondered at the proof of a generation that had not known war, Tony had joined him by his elbow, staring at the scene himself with an unreadable expression.
“I haven’t got one.”
“No, it isn’t, but I’ll do you one better.” Bucky pointed to the general direction of the cell door. “A goddamn smoking bridge.”
Steve thought he looked drawn, even ill, but although Steve watched him closely for signs of discomfort, only the red goggle-creases marring the corners of his eyes were found.
“Objection,” he growled. “Speculation.”
Tony, who did not want to look as though anything odd was happening, seeing as Rhodey had only just stopped thinking he was a frail, weak thing, said, “I’m not afraid.”
“Yes, yes. Them and a hundred starved women and children …
“No one asked you to, Buck,” Steve said.
“I heard you met Rogers,” said Peggy, rather out of the blue, when her voice filtered to Tony’s right, desk-facing ear.
“Me, too. I think Pym has it out for me,” said Steve bitterly; this injustice still rankled.
Clint hummed. “What’s special about that?”
“Frankly,” Sam started, “I don’t know what kind of help we should even expect but given recent developments, I would not be too astonished if it was revealed you have a warship tucked away somewhere around here.”
Tony did not answer. Steve could not see his face: he wondered whether Tony sensed Stane’s plan, was trying to lead them backwards into someplace safe, away from wherever Stane shepherded them.
And the glass was almost on his lips when—
it was by chance. He had suspected this. If it were easy, the killer would have left a card on the rug for them to pick up, instead of a body. He set off around the cover of his shelf, trying to catch a sight.
“It’s not your eyes,” Steve told him, and rushed in.
Abandoning all pretence, Steve asked, “And during the night of the crime, you were at home?”
“No, not without you. Tony, these people,” Steve started slowly, “are akin to thieves and murderers. You’re nothing like them—”
“Sure,” said Steve, though he felt that, too, would result in another dead end. While Sam made his exit, Steve wandered into the bedroom for a chance of clothes.
for that.”
At home, he began to stride blindly around the rooms, opening half-empty wardrobes and chests and picking up clothes only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from Jarvis echoed in his head:
A horrible thought was rising in Steve. “And … Tony?”
With the moonlight cut off, Tiberius’ ghostly appearance turned into one of slack slumber. Wondering at such visible state of oblivion, and feeling more than a little envious, Tony shuffled over to the sleeping man, fighting the petulant urge to kick him awake.
“And privately?” pressed Tony, looking up.
“Oh, I couldn’t find a spot…” said Tony indifferently.
Tony felt his mouth stretch into a none too authentic smile that stretched his cheeks and fell far too quickly.
“Would be hard not to,” replied Hope simply.
The rag was shaken loose and the tic-toc started anew. Tony slid down from the table and placed a hand onto the meaty part of Steve’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze. With his eyes firmly on the walls, Tony said, “It’s not your fault.”
“I’m glad to see, sir, that you’re timely as always,” he said.
Have still the upper hand;
Tiberius had drawn up to his full, not insignificant height. “’Tis how you treat your superior,
“Uh-huh, Malibu warm enough for you?”
Tony twisted in his seat to shoot a smirk at the cousins of his mother’s, who had waited with bated breath for Howard to kick the bucket for decades.
he had said. “I always have and always will be afraid
“Really? Well, I suppose that’s going around,” Tony said, and Steve knew he did not mean death. “I hated mine. At least I’m not afraid to say so.”
“What—?”
“Excuse me,” said Obie, though he addressed not Tony, but the lawyer, “Mr. Murdoc, if it’s not against professional etiquette, how usual is this change of Will?”
Once Jarvis came to, it took several moments to overcome his state of agitation—and then several more to overcome Bruce’s declaration that his patient needed rest—but, at last, Bruce was persuaded to go but not before making sure Jarvis was to be kept in a reclined position for further questioning.
“When was this?”
Clint grumbled but, in the end, gave away.
Jarvis’ lined mouth crinkled, and he cut back on the censor. “He is a miserable man.”
“You need a hobby,” Rhodey said, simply.
And Steve, having been constantly, painfully, on the alert for any indication that someone else was about to tell him they had had enough, that they wished for
The realization that struck Steve with the force of a battering ram was as staggeringly bright as it was relieving. When Steve’s face, breaking into understanding, snapped back to Tony, he found him already looking back.
Steve drew a deep breath.
“Only that Mr. Stark trusted him enough to name him as his successor if something was to happen to him.”
“A dead-end,” replied Steve, folding the letter back, but at the word ‘dead’, something stirred in him; at the shape of the letter ‘y’ and its sharp downward tip. No matter what he tried, the memory eluded him. Was it a threat? Or an encouragement from an old friend to a bored Tony to embrace what he really needed: more than this life.
A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon Steve, but he did not care; he was even glad of it. He didn’t want to think about anything that had happened since he had gotten out of bed. He did not want to examine the thoughts, fresh and sharp as photographs, which kept flashing across his mind. The Starks, killed. Tony, scarred, tapping on his chest at the merest mention of Stane. Tony … gone … Tony, lifting molds of steel from a pail…
An older woman was rushing to him with a rustle of skirts, her bonnet staying atop her silvery hair just by the bow under her chin. She was already speaking, full steam ahead, before she had reached him.
“Thank you,” said Rogers and made another note in his crisp black notebook. “Did you see or hear anything unusual at night between one and five?”
Steve was so startled he answered truthfully. “I forgot.”
“Ah,” said Tony, who was starting to regret asking; he had nothing to say to this.
Steve scowled stubbornly. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked round to see Bucky gazing, resigned, at the ceiling. His lips moved, silently mouthing something.
And sure enough, they were there, looking bemused. Fury invited them, by gesture, to be seated, where they continued to look at the mayor curiously. When Fury straightened up, he laid a casual hand atop his safe.
. A house arrest is never unnegotiable. The police invented that to keep the hysteric wives happy.”
“Typical of the old man, really,” he said from behind the frame, which, true to Jarvis’ aborted pursuit, was dust-free. “Under several pounds of stone and he’s still managing to lecture me about idleness. If I didn’t know better, I’d say he’s dissembling this house himself to make me work for it.”
hide the scar from us. You, with your medals and honor, you who have let your man hooraw you around—here’s what I think of
“Defense,” Coulson called for the last turn to speak, looking vexed at Bucky’s right side. Clearly, they worked him too hard. “Anything to add?”
They were standing at the top of a hill sloping steeply down to the water. The sky got bluer further at the sea that glittered in the daylight, occasionally disrupted by a ferry plying the waters. In the middle of the bay stood a large island.
Sam looked nervous. “These have been tested, right?”
“You don’t think he was still alive when they brought him in? Or that he found the window already open, broken by the vase-thief? A robbery gone wrong?”
Steve looked over at Sharon as well; she was standing next to Ms. Hill, already engaged in a conversation as though she had not just arrived at her side of the room. Women were so strange sometimes.
“You’d better retire for tonight, Hodge,” he said coldly. “Your bottle is getting empty.”
been a means of distraction.
And, that was order restored.
your story?” Sam cackled. “Riveting stuff.”
For some reason, Fury gave Clint an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault he was enduring the force of Steve’s obstinance instead of easy cooperation, but Steve, glancing across at Bucky, who was indifferently chewing on a straw, thought that Fury was fighting a long-lost battle. However, Fury had not said his last word.
“Just ‘cause I wasn’t elected doesn’t make me any less real,” Fury grunted. “I convinced him the air was fresher in Tennessee.”
to the floor, yet it had rolled like tumbleweed in a breeze. There was a faint ringing sensation rising in his ears, and it was not because of the noise.
“Listen,” said Bucky grimly, returning behind the ironwork. “Tony is an idiot. Big brain but not adaptable to life skills. It’s not a very good mixture when the only thing bigger than his wits is his heart. I’d say it was very easy to get him to crack.”
“We should stick together,” Steve began, but showed his unholstered hips under his jacket, nonetheless. Pierce was shaking his head.
“We are done here,” he said steely, a gleam of sweat on his brow. “Go home, Steve.”
Pym stared at him from behind his golden, thin-rimmed glasses.
“I can’t believe you.” Then, harder: “I

“Hank Pym.”
Evidently Rogers had no other suggestions. After squinting at Tony for a moment or two, Rogers rose, mirroring Tony, who did as he had suggested, with the horrible feeling of seeing off a ticking timebomb.
“What ‘what’? An informant,” said Bucky, impatiently. “Fury’s been sending letters all over the country for naught but—
“Came here for more?” he asked and swayed slightly. “I’m afraid it’s pretty slim pickings.”
“And she ain’t only one,” said Sam, and started to count with his fingers. “There’s been three fat men, four tall men with mustache, and one bearded cripple, all seen near the bridge around twilight and all wearing a sinister expression.”
He tried to recall what he had seen on the night of the murder. It was all in rapid flashes … there had been the noise, and the window … he concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember…
It was the bullet. Now pitifully flattened as though it had hit solid rock instead of cloth and skin;
When their feet touched the parquet floor of the hall, Tony found himself face to face with a Police Sergeant, who had just come out of the drawing room, closing the door behind him.
“Then uncomplicate it,” said Tony and glanced at the silver-framed table clock on the edge of the desk. “Fourteen and counting…”
Tony looked bewildered but, freshly caffeinated, followed Steve up the staircase into the second floor of the Saloon and across the landing. Steve knocked on the last door on the right. A muffled, “Come in!” answered them.
shoot first.”
“Oh, that’s how it is—"
Steve craned his head carefully, for he loath to dislodge Tony’s sleeping head on his right shoulder, but Natasha, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, “There’s nothing in there. I checked. Fury’s made sure of it.”
“Do not pity me in vain,” rasped Jarvis after a beat and peered up at Steve shortsightedly. “I know my days are counted. I only wish to live long enough to see Anthony one more time.”
Tony hummed.
“If I’m right,” said Natasha from under the belly of the plane, “the guns are synchronized with the rotation of the propeller. This will change war. For good.”
As he stepped out of the shadow of the building, Tony finally recognized his puffy face as that of Mr. Stern, member of Parliament. A uniformed Constable was following after him, looking apologetic and powerless as Stern went on, loudly enough for the whole street to witness.
When they met at the middle again, Sharon asked seriously, “Never mind that, how are you?”
He did pretty well in getting the words out, all things considered. Behind him, Stern’s red face was bordering on purple. Hammer, with real pleasure, tugged Tony, whose drink sloshed, into the room.
“Is it?” Tony squinted, yawned and said, “Huh. What date is it?”
“So, I’m right?” Tony pressed, pushing away from the trunk, and to his surprise he was prevented from moving by Rogers’ hand clasping his arm. He looked down at it. He thought for a wild second that it was the first time he had been touched by Rogers, although they must have come to contact before —
Apart from the noise of the yielding suspension as they got out of the car, the silence prevailed; this was for the best, really, since Tony was so tired and Rogers so very unexpectedly attentive as he escorted Tony to the door, that God only knew what he may have uttered …
“A call would have done the job,” said Tony.
still partly meant his father.
“No,” answered Rogers. “If someone
Bucky and Steve exchanged another long look.
“Pass me the stool.”
“See? Easy.”
“I’ve been busy, that’s all,” said Steve. “The people are rather distressed at a time like this and it is my duty to help.”
Indeed, by the time the dinner was finished, they found the dark-uniformed Police-Constables talking to two of the housemaids in the hall outside.
Steve merely looked at him. Jarvis’ eyes slid over to Steve’s star.
His question was answered, not by them but by shouting coming from behind a stack of crates. They all fell silent, crouching down behind the visual barrier.
Pym spat out some of his drink.
“Shit … shit,
“Don’t worry,” Steve threw over his shoulder, “I’m not going to punch them in the nose.”
“So, it’s okay?”
“I only want the men whose discretion I can count on.” Pierces eyes strayed to someone behind Steve. “Half of you need to stand on guard for Stane and slow him down by any means necessary.”
Jarvis looked down at the picture as though expecting Tony to reach out and explain it to him.
Tony startled; he had not realized Jarvis was still there; and although he should have known it would be coming, he had not expected the jump from Master Anthony to
Steve shook the offered hand. Despite the laugh lines etched onto the man’s face, his eyes were cold. All Steve’s speculation was soon forgotten, though, as Pierce addressed Steve’s group—finally relenting his unfaltering gaze on Steve—and the moment he did so the scowl vanished, and he took in the men and a disguised woman with what looked like amusement.
“Steve, you cannot run from it,” he said impatiently. “I know what Coulson gave you.”
“Protecting himself, more like. If London hears about this, goodbye Westminster.”
The next thing Tony felt was considerable pain on his cheek. Hammer Sr. had released him — the result was that his body had crumbled down, and when met with no resistance, by the feeling in his cheek, hit the floor headlong. He scampered up, holding his fevered-feeling throat; the musty air of the room felt cold flooding in his lungs again — and the uproar was loud and clear at last—
Anyway, thanks for sticking with me to this point of the story. If you're interested in this new one, if I continue with this speed, it should be ready by September lol
Tony’s heart was pumping rather fast again as he bent closer, his head almost inside the safe: yellowing papers of various sizes lay in listing stacks, money was tucked at the furthermost corner and — Tony’s insides felt suddenly loose and watery — his mother’s jewellery occupied the shelf closest to him.
“Can I test it?” Rogers asked, the key held aloft.
Yup. RIP to 2020 but I'm different.
but this is all so very thrilling!”
“I had my rest,
“It’s
“When he rode off with the outlaw’s horse, it was. The man set the marshals after Scott.”
By the shelves Rogers stiffened, but said, “Understood.”
“Like old scotch at three in the morning,” replied Tony honestly.
It smelled of freshly cut roses, damp soil and the perfume of the woman bustling from the counter to a confused customer and back. As he took a step in, a head popped up from behind the assortment of bouquets.
“Hello, Anthony,” she greeted warmly. Then nodded to the man next to Tony. “Colonel Rhodes.”
Tony was barely listening. Where was Obie? He did not seem to be at the back of the room near the edibles … he was nowhere near the hall he had walked through … he wasn’t part of any of the groups lingering by the French windows, occasionally discussing in detail the garden outside…
Inspector Rogers returns ... 😉 😉
One of the Bills had been about to step off for refreshments, but at the sight of Steve, he leapt back to his partner and rejoined the dancing clowns, politicians, and celebrities.
It had happened a few times in the past two weeks, Steve going to bed alone but waking up to noises from the kitchen, and, upon stumbling towards it, finding Tony there.
“Postponed,” said the voice of Rogers, “due to new evidence. And to two of the witnesses fleeing to their townhouse in Mayfair. They declared the country air to be bad for their health.”
Finally Sam gathered himself together and spoke, “Okay,
“I don’t. It’s a miracle how leisure and compelling circumstances chances one’s habits. And speaking of leisure,” he said, shooting Steve a calculated look. “Done testing whether my guns match the grooves of the bullet? Fool’s work, really. I would have had the right one discarded.”
It was ajar; Tony could not remember Jarvis leaving it unlocked last evening, nor having seen a pale strip of light pooling under the gap minutes ago. Tony crept closer to the door and pressed his ear against it. It was impossible to pick up a sound. He quietly pushed open the door.
“What is it?” Steve asked.
It was an attractive blush, yet Tony’s rising dislike of the man rather impaired the pleasure.
“One more thing,” hissed Stern’s voice. “It’s an awkward position you’ve driven us in. One has to treat you as usual out of loyalty to your father, of course, but hang it all, one’s gorge does rise at treating something to eat to a murderer.”
“So young,” he spoke up, “to be in charge of so many.”
Something had chipped the post into splinters, but neither of the cleaner grooves cutting it diagonally, nor the slight blackened gunpowder residue confirmed Steve’s theory. Feeling disappointed, he threw sideways glances left and right, put on his hat with a twirl and, with last parting glower at the fence, walked off to finish some more paperwork.
“Interest that the ‘man’ has been too obtuse to notice,” said Steve, trying not to freak out about
“He should expect a bright future as this town’s Sheriff, then.”
“For this bruise?” Steve couldn’t help but ask, part of him enjoying the stupefied looks on their faces. “Did we get them all?”
The notion struck to Steve as something he would seek from Tony as well, and this, above anything, won him over as the man finished heartfeltly, “But he is.
A figure came bustling through it, and took several steps back, stunned by what he had found. They cried out, and ran off—
“I didn’t grow up with much,” said Steve, now with a feeling of calmness settling into him. “Why should I need more things now?”
“If I had believed Clint’s warning—"
Twice, Tony thought he felt an icy, calculating pair of eyes on his back, but when he, at last, could chance a look at the front door, his eyes merely caught those of Obie, Mr. Stone. and Stern, standing in a ring, smoking cigars.
“Or not,” said Steve, and gazed at them. He felt like an answer was dangling right in front of his eyes, tantalizingly close. “That’s exactly what he does.”
He had been stewing his resentment at Howard for so long — prepared to never let the happy memories outweigh the bad — that now when he suddenly found some more of the good, he did not know where he stood. Was it love — or something he’d always taken to be affection? What did love
They descended into the entry where it all had started, joined the stream of people moving down the opposite corridor, looking around as surreptitiously as possible. But even the map had lied about the enormity of the premises. The hallways seemed to continue forever. They passed through a fire door which opened to a large, high-ceilinged hall that spread above and under them; they had reached Sector 10. A wave of metal-scented heat hit them in the face while the workers continued down a metal staircase to the floor where massive cogwheels turned; and further along, furnaces lined the walls and men were pouring molten metal into ladles.
“Just like that?” said Steve, remarkably softly.
“Exactly,” said Fury, looking greatly approving. “Unfortunately, we can’t touch them. They’re rich. They arm our military. We must act quietly without raising alarm. But, how do we know which company to target?”
might even be, to act as a war deterrent, gives people hope. They won’t let go of that easily. Do you see where I’m going with this?”
Rogers rallied at once.
seriously?” Rogers said harshly, knuckles white around his pen. “If I had a dead man turn up in my house, I’d refrain from making immature cracks—”
“Sweet of you,” Fury praised impassively.
Steve stepped forward.
Rhodey sighed. “Yeah, so I heard. I’m not mad, Tony.”
He removed it, revealing a strip of much paler, Irish skin underneath.
Tony, indolently, waved him off. Dummy, stretching languidly, trotted off with Rogers, having apparently cottoned on to the concept of outdoors. As both pairs of steps retreated, echoing down the hall, Tony lingered by the ajar door, knowing Rogers would have to cross through the servants’ quarters on his way to the back.
“Here,” said Sam, shrugging off his jacket; Steve didn’t know where he had lost his. “I better not see you run into any more fires with that on.”
“We are a bit bigger than some private snoop. The government is part of us, and we are part of the government.” Fury set onto Steve’s lap a stack of papers, on which Steve discovered the mysterious eagled logo.
“Let’s,” Tony granted quickly; he had just seen Peggy rising up.
“I just came in … found him like this … it all seems a little
Neither spoke for a moment. Then—
“God damn it,” Fury swore and shook his hand to snuff out the flames. “You feel this air, don’t you? We might be getting that rain faster than we thought. I ain’t—”
“All right, what
“Steve,” cried a voice. “
“Are you all right, mister?” Sam asked Jarvis, who looked as though he had forgotten how to breathe.
They climbed upstairs.
As the horror of the discovery crept down his spine like scuttling ants, his mind registered sounds of the real world: a shuffle of fabric next to him as someone leaned past him to the window.
“Sorry, lost in my head,” he said, mustering a smile onto his face.
“Who’s ‘we’?” asked Steve sharply.
Rhodey just gave him a blankly curious look. “Yours?”
“I have grown rather fond of you,” Stane muttered quietly. “But, alas, if you insist to be selfish, you leave me no other choice.”
“Maybe we should have this someplace else—” Steve started to suggest but was cut off.
“The old man said to divide it as I wanted!”
When he laid down his knife to blow off some of the dust, however, he caught the reflection of a figure, distorted though it was by the rippling water, and looked up. Steve might have startled, but there was no one else to see. He was perfectly composed by the time the figure revealed itself to be Tony, who was finally, impossibly, at home.
“I was
Steve’s insides twisted in displeasure. “What did he steal?”
. Just for the record, imprisoned in his house with just a box of scraps for company until my father’s legacy was officially transferred to his name was about as fun as it sounds. On my twelfth birthday, he had me transferred to the New York factory. I think he told me to ‘think of it as a nice fieldtrip.’ Very nice sense of humor, that man had.
Pym swung back around. “Because ten years ago, another Stark came snooping,” he said.
“Idiot.”
“Should we be concerned about that,” said Scott, and pointed behind the fallen table.
Tony picked up the jagged pieces of the plate and arranged them, slowly, into a pile on their table.
As he strode through the tight passage between the stairs and the open doors, he was unable to help hearing a scrap of conversation happening behind the only closed door of the corridor. It was Mr. Stone’s angry, winded voice that said, “Then you won’t tell them?”
“If you want to leave by tomorrow, you’d better hurry to catch the train at Julesburg,” he said, turning his back on them.
Silence pressed upon his ears as he tiptoed through the dark, echoing hall. He could only see ten feet ahead of him, so that as he reached the foot of the staircase its steps appeared to emerge suddenly out of the oncoming darkness: several feet of polished, smooth balustrade, console tables of deep mahogany decorated with hazardously thin-glassed vases of daisies. He walked ahead and ahead, out towards the left wing, his eyes wide, staring through the shadows around him to the blackness beyond, where a door would be.
Steve’s arm spasmed from its heat—and he hesitated.
“Overruled,” denied Coulson.
might be Stane, and they were on the right track. Then they heard movement from the street to their left. Steve had his gun aimed at the disturbance before he realized, in the ambient light of the lamps, that his weapon was aimed at Scott and Sam, who looked vexed. Scott was massaging his shoulder.
But just as Stane’s eyes flashed in the darkness, Steve saw his mouth curl into a grimace; the gun fired, missing Steve by a mile, its sound echoing in the misty night for a long time while, with disbelieving frown Stane brought his hand to his pallid face that slowly contorted with betrayal at the sight of his singed palm.
Later, after having caught the unlicensed liquor salesman, who was taken to the cells by Clint, Steve decided to walk to the church. There he followed its white picket fence and its worn painted surface until, under the stained-glass windows, he found what he was looking for: an oddly shaped, snow-capped post. Excited, he took off his hat, and swatted at the fence. Snow fell off and revealed what was underneath.
“Well,” said Stern, “well, well, well. Now
Steve felt faint. He was not alone in this; none of them had seen more than two California gold pieces at a time after war.
At this, if Steve had not been mistaken, the serious, thin-lipped man had blushed under his rather badly receding hairline.
“You know, when you’ve got a lot of time to think, it’s funny what you remember. It’s the moments that you skated over,” he said, addressing his drink. “I told Tony I was scared of what he did. The look on his face … I don’t think he got what I meant, which part of it I truly was afraid of. Plenty people know what my father did, why I never step a foot in here, and Tony … you don’t think he thought I’d become afraid of
“I — I got the feeling he was … cornered,” Tony tested, recalling the wild-eyed look on Ty’s face, which no doubt had been mirrored on Tony’s. “Mr. Stone, his father, is—”
“It’s a cigar! It brought in a cigar, it’s — gah! Covered in
He did not return for the next twenty minutes. Tony, who was getting antsy, felt the reality of his whereabouts rest heavy on his shoulders. They both knew Steve had covered for him, told God knows what to keep Tony out of custody. So here Tony was in his debt, unable to even things up —
“Steve?” Bucky repeated, now with an edge, and Steve shook himself out of it.
“I’m going to the saloon,” he declared.
“Do you have any idea how stupid you are?” Bucky thundered. “If Tony had kept gunpowder in there, your ass would have been blown up sky high.”
“Don’t want them to steal the thunder?” asked Tony, who was eying with interest the typewriter Jarvis had scavenged for Steve.
“He’s got a point,” said Clint, looking at Sam.
“San Fran—?” he started, but the rest of the city was drowned by a voice not unlike a cannon fire, and Steve instinctively ducked his head, expecting to find the roof collapsing upon them.
“Afternoon, Mr. Stark,” he greeted cordially.
“They seem to trickle in like postcards,” he said. “Lastly for bribery.”
“They like you better,” replied Tony, edging closer to the grand piano. “You do it.”
“Platypus—”
Barnes, out of habit, knew not to put too much weight on this, and snickered.
It was hard to describe the feelings that rattled across Jarvis’ face right then. Disappointment would not quite be adequate. Shame had Steve’s insides clenching even tighter.
“No kidding.”
Not in there … safe, not dead … and the thing that was burning was just the empty forge…
Rogers looked contrived.
Steve groaned. “Pym’s men.”
“Good talk,” said Tony, and in passing, tapped Steve’s chest with the back of his hand. Steve watched him all the way down the street, not moving, and only when he was out of sight, did he lift his free hand to trace the chaste touch, puzzled.
“No one knows,” Steve read from the paper. “The cartridge didn’t match any known caliber and, according to the autopsy, the wound was shaped weird.”
Meanwhile, Scott had taken a hammer and a chisel out of his satchel, placed the end of the latter into the hole of the lock and struck. The following rattle of loose machine parts was hardly heard overt the sniping, which ceased only after the door creaked open before their stupefied faces.
“Oh, I’ve heard all right,” replied Obie. “I’ve busted my back day and night to keep it from spreading beyond the society pages. Why do you think the Hammers got Reed? By skill?” He scoffed and his eyes fell into the corner by the door. “Nice toy.”
“What?”
“Did you — do you—”
“I know we will,” said Bucky bracingly. “You know why? Because I bet he’s giving Stane hell. Besides you, he’s the most stubborn person I’ve ever met.”
“—which means the only way is through basement—”
“Come on, Cap,” said Sam, tugging at his arm. “Up to bed. I’ll make sure you don’t collapse on the way there.”
Once they passed it, Tony punched the stage ceiling twice.
“You shouldn’t have to be,” she replied.
Peter was finally down on the ground, shaking his hands. Steve watched him pick a splinter from his thumb. And sure enough, he had a strange-looking mask with slits for eyes on his face, behind which one could see the pinked tips of his rather prominent ears.
Tony sighed. “Is he worth my time?”
“New?” asked Steve keenly.
At the sight of the weapon, Steve sensed Natasha shift next to him and stepped pointedly between her and the men.
Steve’s insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell them the truth. They would find soon enough, too soon… He toed off a day-old chunk of caked mud from the side of his boot to avoid answering. In the corner of his vision, he saw the two share a long glance.
The man lived up to his letter, seeming large and commanding in his bowler hat and broad-collared coat as he prowled along the passage like a caged wild cat, sucking on a fat cigar. A sudden turn obstructed him from Steve’s visual by another walkway, and Steve could not see what was going on above him. He tilted his head back, trying to see…
Neither fired. Stalemate.
“Well,” said Tony flippantly, “the enemy of the State is six feet under. I’ve got the company now. I’ve turned on a new leaf, I am
They sat, shivering now, for the train was speeding much faster on a plain and the wind whipped their fringes ruthlessly. For a few minutes, the only sound was the howl of the draught. But then Tony shimmied up the window and, when even that noise was cut off, the pressing need to say something became too much for Steve.
“He’s gone into shock!” Sam shouted. “We need a thicker coat.” He squatted in front of Steve. “Steve, can you hear me? Do you feel cold sweat?”
The woman, having been so promptly and directly spoken to, startled and retreated onto a display; as she and the saleswoman rushed to gather the scattered flowers, Tony plucked a bunch of lilies, slipped around the women and threw several notes on the register. Behind him, he heard a commotion as Hammer tried to follow but got his jacket caught on a decorative arrangement, and by the time he got his hem detached from the clutch of the gilded branch, Tony had already tugged the door open with force that rattled the OPEN sign, tugging his sunglasses higher up his nose.
“Can you not rip my arm?” It was definitely Tony; Steve’s stomach registered a violent swoop. “You need it more than I do.”
“Where’s my dog?” Tony demanded instead.
Witness, accomplice, family, every possible connection or timeline tying them to one another, they raked over them, Steve joining in at intervals. He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, get paperwork done, trying to fool his mind off the one unsigned paper in his possession, but Bucky insisted on his attendance in ever more unlikely debates simply, Steve was aware, to keep him from brooding.
“Well, then,” Steve said, trying to muster a smile, “maybe more witnesses will pop up by then.”
Steve bit his lip, swaying on the cusp of gathering enough courage to take the leap, when a voice shouted, “Sheriff!”
“Yeah.”
“But there are mountain lions out there,” Scott moaned. “He don’t do so good alone. What if he gets lost?”
“Fury likes to delegate tasks to break up the facts into pieces so small it makes piecing them together impossible,” he said. “I see he has not given up on the tradition. Still the only one who knows the full truth … is him.”
“You—you’re sure?”
And then he was gone, hidden behind the dancing townsmen. As Steve watched the spot where he had last seen him, a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the brandy he had drunk. It seemed fate was set on keeping one of them miserable at a time: as one failed in love, the other triumphed.
“To have a chat with them about keeping their animals in check.”
When Steve was a dozen steps away from the bed, Tony stopped him again.
Natasha had gotten there. She had lost her hat, and her red hair swung loose as she tugged a ribbon free, tied it around a man’s neck and, using this as leverage, kicked off the ground. Two men were laid out on the cobblestones before her legs met the cobble again.
“Keats,” said Tony, who hardly recognized his own voice. “She found it romantic.”
He no longer found use for furtiveness; he dashed down the steps and let the carpet-muffled echo of it scare off the vandal downstairs, where, he was sure, the person was now standing frozen, aware that someone in the house was awake. This gave Tony the needed courage to skip over the last three steps, and witnessed the drawing room door loom out of the dark wall ahead.
He let none of this show on his face. “Congrats,” he offered mechanically.
Steve bit his cheek. “I grant that,” he said eventually, “but what proof do you have?”
“People aren’t made of metal, Tony.”
The promise held—for over a decade—until that very December morning when Steve trudged up the stairs of COULSON’S ATTYS & COUNCELORS & LAW into the upstairs office of the judge, who looked grave behind his desk. He wordlessly handed over a single page, so unusual compared to the hefty sheets these visits usually brought on, and before Steve could ask, he spied the heading:
They stuck to his heels until Jarvis slowed down at the doorway.
“Could you please not judge me for five seconds?” Tony massaged at his eyes, pressing on them until he saw spots, and went on bitingly, “How do you
“Huh,” said Steve, turning to watch Scott, seated on the right side of the car, in the light of this new information. Funny enough, he looked exactly the same. Next to Scott, Clint raised his spurred boot to push against the opposing seat; catching Steve’s eye, he then lifted the other from the carpeted floor to drape over his left.
“So, I’m what?” urged Tony, affronted. “A
Tony glanced back repeatedly at the landing, half-expecting to find a bank of Police-Constables stomping up the stairs to arrest him. Tony, who did not feel as carefree as he had pretended when reassuring Jarvis to call the police, was silent in his observing of the crowded drive. A Constable and Doctor Banner had pulled up minutes ago, tailed by another black car bearing a plain-clothed man with a camera, and an ambulance.
“You’re not making a very splendid figure of yourself, but I’ll consider letting you sleep off your bad decisions, if you ask nice,” he went on, collapsing onto the carpet as well as the adrenaline leaked out of his body, leaving behind a feeling of fatigue and mild nausea. “We can amend the hostilities a little bit … I
“Stay here, Steve,” Bucky pleaded as he watched Steve rush about. Soon, he let go of the doorjamb and he spread his hands in defeat. “I’m fighting a losing battle, aren’t I? You’re going to do it anyways and I will have to clean up after you.”
—quickly!”
They thus carried four chairs to his bedside in one of the holding cells and positioned themselves comfortably. Steve hesitated to give him Tony’s photo—if this was to protect himself or Jarvis, Steve did not care to explore.
So he did. Sufficiently scolded, Tony inquired on Rhodey’s plans to leave for America, on catching the train, and offered, quite graciously, to have Happy drive all his trunks to the station.
“I thought I was unpopular.”
Steve felt said chest clench at her casual use of Tony’s beloved nickname, and he looked away, out to the now empty saloon. When he turned around, he was sorry to find Natasha was still staring at him.
Rogers glanced at him from his perusing of the trail, apparently alarmed at this new delighted air that had crept into Tony’s voice.
“Tony!”
“We did ask around, but the crews cleaned up the area overnight to allow for normal business operations the next day, and in doing so they destroyed physical evidence that might have helped investigators solve the crime. Stark Industries was in shambles after the stocks dropped. We could not quite figure out from whose pocket the funeral expenses should be paid.”
Tony broke off in coughs. Steve sprung up from his chair and helped Tony up, propping a pillow against the middle bar of the white metal headboard and guided Tony to rest his head on it.
Their laughter was followed by a round of cheers rose among the crowd; someone had won a turkey.
“Sir?”
“Come on,” Tony mumbled, hands desperate, “nothing else is gonna shut my mind—”
He paused and then added slowly.
“What I meant to say is, although this case is so cut and dried its manufactured aspects have defeated their own ends, an inquest is inevitable. It’s fixed for tomorrow at noon — you are familiar with the village hall? No doubt they’ll bring it in Wilful Murder by person or persons unknown, given the evidence, or lack thereof, but—” Rogers paused, seeming to choose his next words very carefully. “They’ll want to hear you. And I wish that did not make me fearful of you making my job that much harder.”
Tony turned to look at Rogers and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.
The room looked twice as secretive swimming in the shadows of twilight, but otherwise the office was as still and empty except for the people inside it. To the three’s credit, they all looked unruffled; wearing a mildly curious expression, Fury looked up from his paperwork as though having a deputy, a saloon owner, and an armed secretary in his building was a normal day’s work for him.
Tony hesitated, thinking … and then resumed his retreat back to his car. However, he kept his eyes on the back of the distancing vehicle, wondering … it just did not seem in character, somehow, for correct, magistrate Mr. Stone to be taking matters to his own hands like this…
“If it’s of any comfort, the death was quick,” he said, consulting his notes, which he had taken out of a coat pocket. “He was shot here between two and four in the morning. Bullet pierced liver and was found during autopsy. Including enough Benzedrine sulphate to knock out a horse — not lethal, but enough to have you climbing up walls for a long, long time.”
“What can I do for you? — I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch —
“Yep,” said Bucky, pale but standing upright, “but there’s still the big guy … over there.”
“Imagine this,” he said. “A man creates dissension on purpose to antagonize the country that is still divided—to the bitter losers who are neck-deep in debt, and the rich winners, who feel validated by their cause. It is easy, too easy, to stage the murders of several politicians with significant northern ideals of equality. Conflict made, this man is one murder away from starting a full-blown war. So, I ask you, Sheriff, what kind of man will profit from this? What could this man own that will make him a rich man when human nature becomes a casualty of war?”
“I thought Stark still made weapons during war?” Bucky asked, confused.
Steve let the hallway door slip from his grip. Action was all he had wanted these past days, to fill this desire to do something desperate and risky; now, it was being offered to him on a silver platter.
,” said Obie loftily. “I don’t remember you being present.”
“He was the one who gave Clint that paper.”
“I—um,” Tony said, and rubbed his temple. “What was I saying? Can you give me a second, this … it’s like Chinese water torture. I’m trying to—”
Steve wrenched his jacket off his shoulders and cast it on a nearby stool. Although the pot-belly stove was several dozen feet away, the room had suddenly become hot. He could also feel a burning and prickling that had nothing to do with the alcohol; he blinked up at the candle chandelier.
(See the end of the chapter for
“If that’s what it takes,” said Steve, not pausing his strides.
Tony must have known they would come to save him…and they had wasted so much time… For how long had he had to buy time? How long had he had to pretend to be stalled by something and what had it cost him? Had he worried Steve would never come?
“I feel like trouble,” Rhodey said, frowning.
Steve twisted his limbs free to grab his gun, just as Stane lunged and picked up his own from below the scaffolding. Observing the barrel pointed at his forehead, Stane looked amused.
Rhodey twisted his pursed mouth between his fingers in contemplation.
He threw himself into a divan, arranging an embroidered cushion behind his back. He noticed, with no little degree of amusement, that Rogers was careful not to let his eyes stray to Tony, as though he were witnessing something indecent.
“Don’t be so loud,” Steve reprimanded.
And there were hands reaching towards him: Obie took Tony gently by the armpit; the others were not so courteous: he was pushed and tugged, yanked and hauled by so many arms he could not tell which belonged to whom, nor a word of what was whispered, wondered, by the bystanders at both sides of the rooms he was half-carried through —and, at last, was released at the door of a pantry, only to be violently shoved, with a parting, “Get in, vermin.”
“You’ll be glad to have work on your hands, then?” Fury’s good eye was peering at Steve passively. “Some of it is right in front of you.”
“At least I clean,” said Steve, which sobered Bucky up at once.
“Um, yeah.” Tony’s voice was bordering on hysteric heights. “This is not a good time—”
the telephone’s sound was getting harder and harder to ignore; it was now pressing on Tony’s eardrums and he felt something start to pound on the back of his eyes. Tony knew better, though, than to say what he did or did not like; Roger’s face held a hint of interest at his discomfort that came across as dangerous.
The lack of text must have shown through the paper in the lighting, because Bruce straightened in his seat, craning his neck.
“The Woodward’s Gardens’ magician, you mean? He’s got the name for it, I see what you mean.”
A small branch hit Clint on the shoulder.
Steve looked away, rubbing at his chest. Resentment and hopelessness battled inside him, fighting for their place on his face. Steve wanted the truth; why was it so hard to come by?
“We’ve got company,” he warned.
“I found it lost under his cot, already opened. I like my privacy, and I’ve found that the best way to maintain it, is to respect that of others.”
“You don’t like him,” observed Steve with pleasure. “So you’ll help us.”
A nurse in long, starched apron walked past with a rattling tray of instruments to one of the ten beds but Steve paid it no mind. He sat there, on a white rickety chair that dug into his vertebra when leaned against, like he had done for the past twenty hours, glancing from Tony’s sleeping form to the blood-caked ring. It had been scarlet and gold when his watch started but was now browning and flaky.
“I’m fine,” said Steve, wondering why he kept telling people this. “Really.”
“Really?” Tony had gone red from both anger and embarrassment. “That’s why you’re all—”
“Women,” scoffed Clint, but adopted a visibly less scornful look at Natasha’s withering glare. “I think the stagecoach driver is going to string us up by his reins next time he passes through.”
“Shh,” Steve said, and Tony’s head lolled onto Steve’s chest. He remained awake, though: the warmth of his breath turned the skin over Steve’s sternum into gooseflesh. Soon, Tony’s agitation waned enough for Steve to venture to let go of his wrists; instead bringing his hands up, to rub his thumbs into the stiff cords of muscle in his back, as knotted and full of kinks as ever.
Steve stared at the short, stubby woman.
At last, curiosity unquenched he suspected the rest of the letter had been accidentally grabbed by one of the others. But none of them were looking at their laps in baffled fashion: their eyes were still moving quickly along the lines of what looked to be much more satisfying, long letters.
Here, the Windsor-loving cousin jumped up like a jack-in-the-box. Highly embarrassed, she sat back down slowly, and thereafter remained in her seat. Tony, leaning back on his rear chair legs, gazed through his lashes at the attaché case in disguised avidness, and as Murdoc walked to it, every eye tracked his movements. At the back of the room, books had stopped shuffling.
“Objection,” said Bucky from next to Steve.
The room below seemed to be a combination of cellar and garage, and as such, was bare-walled and windowless. Though very cluttered and thoroughly utilized, the room somewhat resembled their family mausoleum on the unforgettable occasion that his parents’ bodies had been laid to rest inside sealed stone. There was a stack of rotors on a plugboard, and an engine Tony deduced to belong to his father’s Mercedes, due to the unique shape of the pimped-up exhaust manifold. Wrapped bunches of cables long enough to make the way to London and back, all bobbing in the breeze he had brought in with him, hung from hooks screwed deep into the cement wall.
“Oh!” he exclaimed suddenly. “A Ming-dynasty vase has gone missing from the drawing room, sir. Thought you should know.”
“No,” answered Steve at once, “I got the feeling there was a certain solidarity between your father and Mr. Stone. Howard, at least, was very actively keeping up the correspondence. But,” — he kept a pointed pause — “on the months leading to Howard’s death, they had not interacted once, and because of this, I had Stone surveyed particularly closely. He had been in Covent Garden from where he and his lady friend took a taxi to the Palace. The hotel staff confirmed the couple stayed the whole night and did not return here until late in the morning.”
Now even further away from Steve, Tony cursed colorfully under his breath as a shiny shoe stepped through the heavy door, then another; Stane only had time to take in the additional guests around Tony, surprise clear on his bearded face, before Tony lifted his left hand as if to expel Obadiah out of the hall…
Steve gave no credence to Bucky and Clint’s accusations, but he began to agree that Tony might be spinning out of control: in his shirtsleeves, Tony decidedly did not look right. He was, Steve knew, more intelligent and creative than any other man he had met, with potential to break new ground—but only if he didn’t break himself while reaching there.
Steve didn’t reply. Instead he felt at his intact chest, gazing past Sam into the rim of the theater’s roof, past which he could see the starless sky. Despite this, Steve thought it had not looked so bright in months. Finally, he looked back at Sam.
Steve turned around—just in time to see a ninth man, a dozen feet away, take a shot at him.
“And why should it stop because of my choice?” shouted back another.
“Then what did he do it for? You haven’t considered the possibility that he likes it. I had a friend once whose boy was absolutely fascinated with fire. Kept playing with it, you see. The doctors said he was not all right in the head. It’s incurable—but quite harmless, I swear. The cure is to let them have their fun
Tony walked on, eyes on the red woman — Romanoff? — all the while feeling those of others’ boring into his back. He couldn’t relax, even when he was out of earshot: he was certain betrayal would come; he was only unsure from where.
Steve could see it happening again. He watched a horse-drawn carriage bobbing along a street on its spindly wheels, closing in on the soon-to-be ignited charge laying on the street in daylight … but there, Steve’s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how the timing could have possibly worked.
Hours later, after gaining several blisters from shaving an old board to replace the broken axel and hammering back together the bent wheel; grimy from wiping heir sweaty foreheads on their dusty sleeves, they were able to send off Scott and his borrowed mule-driven wagon on their journey northwards to home.
“You know I like paying attention to your projects,” Steve defended. “I like pointing them out before you have the chance to announce them. But sometimes I wish I did not have to fear that you’ve, I don’t know, knocked down a
Coulson dipped his pen into the ink bottle. There was a visible smile tugging at the corners of Coulson’s mouth as his pen flied over the curve of the capital ‘C’ to the last ‘n’.
It was up there, once they had found their way to the middle of the room, at Clint’s outstretched forefinger and middle finger, that they found the owner himself.
Steve’s earlier wish for refreshment was all but brushed aside as he became suddenly intrigued. Could this finally be their needed clue?
“If I ever find way,” Tony said, “I’ll make sure to be the first one. I’ll live forever.”
,” Bucky said gesturing to the general direction of Steve’s chin. “You should buy one of those papier-mâché masks from Joe’s before tonight. Although, they fall utterly short of nightmare-inducing in the face of those dark circles. You’re going to scare off all your partners.”
“I don’t like the idea of him laying low,” said Steve, frowning. “It’s like he’s gathering his strength for something.”
Steve skidded to a stop and stared at the mouth of a rifle. On the other end, was Ms. Hill, who lowered her weapon, once she identified the disturbance.
Then, warily, he set off.
“Sorry, couldn’t quite make out what you said behind that mask of yours.”
—the adventurous sort. He got that from his father—never stayed still, that man.” Jarvis then said coaxingly, “Has he gone very far, do you think?”
“Oh, surely I shouldn’t—but if you insist—thank you, dear,” she simpered. “Do you have time? I’ve bought a new tea set since the last time we met. It’s of course not as fine as yours—” she sighed somewhat wistfully. “Finest china I’ve ever seen. Never quite got Mr. Rogers to divulge their origin. Oh! Speaking of which … you should ask him to come, too, sometime. I have it on very good authority that honey and ginger are good for us insomniacs,” she said and nodded meaningfully at Steve. “All that smoke coming out of that chimney day and night…”
thought Steve. His hair stood on end.
“A great man, for sure, but blind. At least that husband of his had the decency to leave, knowing as how we know he did it.”
The tapping stilled. “I don’t care about the close-knit community idyll anymore,” Tony confessed in a rush. “It’s … it’s dull. This is me trying to revive myself.”
In answer, Bucky crossed his arms, jacket sleeves straining.
Something crashed. A burning shelf had collapsed. It sent a bottle careening towards the floor where it shattered; tiny fragments of glass and a shower of sharp-smelling liquid spread about; the fire almost looked like it danced as it hungrily licked its way up the airborne droplets. Heat burned at his side, smoke stung in his eyes and his vision swum. The flames, eating up the curtains of the alcove, were too tall to see if the bed was vacant or not.
.” He kicked the fallen table. “What now? We were supposed to find Tony. Now that we did, it turns out he doesn’t want to be saved…”
“Put that where it belongs,” Tony said.
“Was,” Steve muttered.
Tony, feeling indignant, huffed, “You can do it yourself if you sit on everything I have to say. Anyway, what’s the next move?”
“Okay, Mr. Pinkerton…” drawled Sam.
Yet, barely detectable over the sound of his heavy breathing, Steve’s ears registered a strange sizzle. His warning never left his abused throat; horror-struck and cursed by his only human reflexes, he was forced to watch as Tony’s propped arms buckled under him. And although the bad in the world had been conquered, although the good had prevailed, the day claimed its last victim when Tony sagged forward, quite lifeless, onto the foot of the church.
When he looked back, even months later, Steve found he had little memories of the Monday after. It was as though his life had turned over one time too many to keep count. The collections he did have were very painful. The worst, perhaps, was the absence of Tony that took place right after his return to the empty house, and the untouched side of their bed that kept drawing his gaze like a dead body.
Terror tore at Steve’s heart … he had to get back to the house and he had to talk to Tony … somehow this must have all been a big misunderstanding … he could reverse what had happened if they just talked things through … Tony could not be tired of him…
“Twenty more minutes and I’m going to freeze off my—”
Rogers absorbed this. “He must have made a copy.”
lit the fire.”
Fury lit a match, bringing it to the cigarette butt inside his cupped hand. This cast ominous shadows upon his eyepatch, causing the surrounding scars to seem even deeper. The flame flickered; almost dying out.
Steve glanced behind him, meeting the apprehensive faces of his group. “Nat, Bucky, with me. Clint, Sam, stay behind with Scott.”
“I am not partaking in
“They aren’t,” Clint said. “They are scared off their wits and this happens to be the juiciest piece of gossip in years—oh, and that reminds me, Steve.” Clint shot a look towards the open font door. “Fury’s been trying to fish information out of Bucky and me. About Tony’s whereabouts. He’ll try Sam or you next. Coulson came snooping as well but when he realized you’re the one with the answers, he dropped it. Not Fury, though … I think he lost all tact along with that eye of his.”
“They never made you, Tony,” Stane growled, “not in the way that matters. I did. Let’s walk further.”
“Would you have listened?”
Fury gave him a slow, one-eyed blink. Then he rose from his desk and rounded it, hands in his pockets. He came to stand in front of it, leaning casually backwards onto its edge.
A chill went down Steve’s back as he looked down on the map himself. Somewhere in there, in one of these massive halls spotted with shadows by the voluminous, onion-shaped shade of the oil lamp, was Tony. In what condition, their spy had not been able to tell.
And why was the entry forced if there was a key? For that was definitely his; Tony had given it to Ty several years previously. It was all becoming tangled; Tony braced fingers against his temples, blocking out the current sunlit state of the room, trying to hold onto the moonlit window frame, but it was like trying to bottle smoke; the details were dispersing and thinning as fast as he tried to gather them … Tiberius had been shot from close range, and fallen backwards … away from the window …
This, finally, turned Scott’s face serious as a windmill creaked above their heads.
felt obligated to stop my designs from ending up in the wrong hands.”
“Come on, Anthony,” Hammer lamented, although he did step away from the white, fragrant flowers. “Is this how you treat a friend of family?”
Steve swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did not think he could stand to discuss Tony. It had been painful enough to hear the whispers, even worse to listen to the others’ comments on them.
… neither could Steve leave him there…
Steve pursed his lips. Silently, he changed position to see them better, crouching into the shadow of the theater.
He trailed off, for, after reaching out to shake Tiberius awake, his hand had instead of drunken slackness met with stiff muscles.
“N-no,” rasped Rumlow at length. “We were supposed to—were to—wait, that’s a
Steve closed his eyes. “And I love you.”
“If it gets messy, we can always double back. No? Then how about Denver? Is that okay?”
desperate man.”
“If he did lapse, he didn’t get the drinks from me,” Natasha said. “Thor hadn’t served him anything stronger than a beer in ages, either.”
“I—I, well, I did!” told Everhart quickly.  “I saw him. But other than that, nothing. Tilly snores loud enough to mask a gunshot.”
The arm pointing at the lane curving behind the house said:
This idea, however, hit a hitch sooner than they would have liked: the door with gilded details at the end of the corridor outside did not budge.
“Your network of spies is a maze,” Bucky said, awed.
A note. Steve had spent the moments before Bucky’s arrival rushing about and looking for things that weren’t there instead of things that might be new. The thought of a note, some communication, provided a surge of hope against all reason. Maybe there was nothing he had missed. Maybe he wasn’t supposed to know what this meant and it all would be explained to him. Tony can’t have just expected him to understand…
This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Tony knew, Howard and Hammer Sr. hadn’t been alone together in a decade, and direct contact between them had been negligible after a rivalrous weapons deal. However, Hammer did not deem it necessary to fact check this. He put his hand around Tony’s shoulder and drew him close.
In the end, they left to take their chance at the large hall, trusting the amount of people to turn them invisible. Steve’s mind grappled with the possibilities as they crept back down: they still had the keys which guaranteed that further violation of property could be minimalized. Of course, they did not know whether Pierce was sufficiently important to own keys to Sector 16, and even if he did, the broken door of Stane’s room might trigger a search before they were clear of the factory.
“Yeah, as are bails.” Obie leaned in closer. “Listen to me, Tony. I need you,
By the Stately Homes of England
“I’ll throw you a bone,” Tony went on. “You’ve just found out I’m innocent and now you’re trying to get the ball rolling without losing your face. Let’s hear it.”
“No, Sheriff, not three weeks. It is actually fifteen days on average. Fifteen!” Strucker exclaimed and turned, arms splayed to the courtroom. “Imagine that.”
Only after it had clicked shut, did Fury step away from observing the street below. It was rare to see him in just shirtsleeves and a grey waistcoat, although he did not look any less sinister: the visible shoulder straps of his holsters guaranteed this.
“Poor Sheriff,” Steve heard one of them whisper as they passed by him in the court hallway. “He must still love him dearly … imagine having to arrest your own husband.”
Tony was careful not to catch Rhodey’s eyes.
“And,” said Steve, “there’s nothing that can be done to fix that ugly, old—"
Tony had known, but to hear it was another matter, and the confirmation sent a ripple of wariness through him. In the stifling, still warmth of the late afternoon, he shivered.
Their horses were saddled; tied to the back of a stage. Steve and Tony were waiting in the crowded station yard of Julesburg with the rest of the company for a promised ride that would take them back home. It was a beautiful December’s day. Steve supposed the weather would remain so, when they arrived there in a day’s time. The thought of clear snow and glittered sun gave him much more pleasure than it would have a week ago.
“Sorry,” he still said in the end and made to leave but was thwarted by Bucky’s arrival.
“What is this? What’s the meaning of this?”
“Everyone to the north of the village, but only half the people inside the house,” said Tony. “Good plan.”
The shadows were already long with sunset by the time Tony walked through the large front doors of Hammer Hall.
The shock of losing the bridge and their forge hung over the town in the days that followed. Urged by necessity, anyone capable of holding a tool had partaken in the project to build a one-man raft to move produce across river, but its modest mechanics had not held well against the unyielding force of the current—a fact which was part of the reason why their smith’s absence was met with much scorn. Steve still startled every morning upon seeing the blackened skeletons of the fire on his way to work where his deputies kept shooting worried glances behind his back.
Tony did. “Huh,” he said as his eyes skimmed along the lines. “Yup, piece of cake … the bullet went in sideways. It’s been known to happen with poor rifling. If I were them, I would concentrate my efforts on anyone buying Hammer’s products.” He threw the paper into the corner of the table, away from the plates. “Who was the poor bastard?”
Well, thought Tony, this wasn’t quite how he had imagined having the man sleep under his roof.
“There won’t be a puddle you can cross peacefully in between here and Nova Scotia except the River Styx, should Stane prevail. I know you all have been hoping for a position where you might see a fair bit of action, but this is far more than survey work. Public opinion is what preserves his innocence. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, whose
“No,” he said, but went on hastily, “I would tell you if I knew.”
“Your ongoing indignation? So you’ll hunt down the truth and let him know it when you go to prove him wrong. He doesn’t know shit, Steve. They just act like they do.”
“No, no,” Tony said and waved his fork at Rhodey imperiously. “You wanted to leave, you do as you please. Don’t change your mind for my sake. Besides,” said Tony, having just heard a car pull up in front of the house through the open door of the dining room. “Who says the case isn’t solved by the time you settled in. Then who’s the fool?”
“I don’t blame you,” Steve spoke softly. “Tony needs more people who consider him priority.”
“Of course, but it is Tony we’re talking about. When has he ever been a functional part of society?”
.” Hammer’s voice changed. “Are you listening? You seem a little distracted. I feel like I’m talking to a wall.”
Steve opened his mouth—
“Do you know something about what’s going on, Tony?” Steve asked. “Look at me.”
“That the coach drove over the explosive at the exact time of detonation … think about it, in order for the shaft to go through the carriage, it must have been set off just under the horses.”
“What a curious coincidence,” said Clint, who, Steve couldn’t help but observe, looked to be rather enjoying himself.
He set down his glass and made a meal out of placing it correctly on a silver tray.
“I remember him,” Jarvis affirmed. “A serious man.”
Steve sagged against the wall behind him. Tony’s fingers twitched.
Tony did not answer straight away. Nevertheless, he felt the air between them thicken: Tony’s refusal to play into Tiberius’ goading was a refusal to allow him to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Tony could tell Tiberius took it as such.
“No.”
“What do you mean?” Steve said hurriedly, having to raise his voice over Clint’s indignant voice going, ‘What, should we hold off until after lunch? The employee benefits must be out of this world.’
“Very fine, sir,” said Jarvis, sounding prim, and bowed out.
Steve hastily tucked the paper in his hands into the folds of his jacket, seized Bucky’s arm and tugged him along with him out into the chilly December air.
There was a greedy glint to Strucker’s sharp eyes when he faced Steve again. Those who had looked excited were now starting to frown.
And it did not appear to be stopping until, finally, midst placing the steaming sauce on the dining table, the cook spoke up:
,” Scott gushed.
They soon discovered this was not taken kindly. After the stables, where their shivering horses had been taken to dry indoors, they had walked straight to the main house. At its thirty-feet-long stone entry they were greeted by a housekeeper, who, after bestowing upon them a look of deepest repugnance, briskly lead them upstairs, where Steve found himself gaping at the Rembrandts, Gainsboroughs, Reynolds, and Gobelin tapestries decorating the walls of the staircase.
As he set off down the dirty-snowed street, he slowed down, looking around.
“Way to go, my boy!” he cheered. “I’ll see you in New York in a week, yeah?”
“I’m not dead?” Tony finished astutely. “Don’t look at me like that—like I’m a … supreme human. It was luck, a mad stroke of luck, a second chance at life. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t escape unscratched—” his fingers stilled on his chest “—I had my fair share of health problems, but … there was a man.”
Steve found himself gaping at its knobby grey bark; there were no trees in this side of town. He looked up and saw a small foot hovering in the air. There, couple feet above him, was a boy hanging from the balcony rail above Joe’s porch.
The dog jumped up; for a second Tony thought it had been bothered by their raised voices, but then it barked once, which was the only warning they got before headlights danced across the passage walls from the driveway below the windows.
There were sounds of several traded shots, nearly drowned by Clint’s fire behind Steve’s back—and then, suddenly, it became silent in the way nature quieted before a storm; and then—nothing could have prepared Steve for this—the air was full of Bucky’s yells. Horrified, Steve backtracked, and dashed over to Bucky, who was kneeling on the ground, face pale and clutching his shoulder. Blood swelled between his fingers and dripped down the back of his hand. Standing over him, sneering at his own work, was Rumlow.
Tony looked down at the cigarette and kicked it away with the toe of his shoe; a Royce already came squealing out of the open garage as Tony retreated back to the house. As he stepped under the Edwardian arch, he glanced back at the speeding car, and stayed quite still until he couldn’t see a sign of even the seat shroud, then he closed the door behind him.
Tony, don’t leave me again—
Fury combed every inch of his safe for over ten minutes, but was forced, finally, to conclude that the rest of the letter was gone. Given how upset as he was, Steve got the feeling it would have contained something much more valuable than the first page, and the only potentially useful clue he could see was the identity of the worker.
Down the streets and up the streets they went, over the tracks of a cable car (which Bucky eyed hungrily), and finally emerged to a wet-soiled side road. The further they rode, the less imposing the stucco-fronted town houses became, until finally, they could see smoke rising behind a line of rather weather-worn buildings.
Jarvis looked at Tony, who waved him away, whereupon he gave a quick, jerky nod of the head and turned on the spot, making to leave the room.
Natasha twirled around to shoot a deadly glare at him.
A memory caused a twinge in Steve’s chest; he thought he was done serving as someone’s cleanup crew. “I don’t do that anymore,” he told Fury.
“Read on,” urged Clint. “They mention the killer further down. They say it to be a Confederate sympathizer.”
“There’s a lot you don’t know,” said Pym, staring deeply into the bottom of his glass. “Do you know your target?”
“Tony represented much to you that you had not known before. But,” said Bucky, and with every word, he jabbed the star on Steve’s chest; pressing down so hard Steve feared its points were going to imprint on his skin, “… you ought to relax your self-criticism in favor of your mental state.”
“With your permission, sir,” Steve said, slipping into parade rest, “I’d like a leave of absence to take care of a personal matter.”
It popped open with a crack of splintering wood … and revealed an empty, musky-smelling drawer. Tony slumped back in frustration. Excitement had been futile … unless …
The morning of the day after dawned clear. Steve observed this with mild pleasure through the cabin’s window and blew aside a strand of hair which had, out of neglect, grown long enough to dangle over his eyes in blond wisps. Through the thick glass, he could see what felt like the whole of West Coast spreading along the central valley. If he squinted, he imagined he could all the way to San Francisco—but that was merely a fantasy. Not even Clint’s eyes could have seen that far.
And soon, the six of them hurried towards the maze of uphill housing.
Tony held his chin high. “I’m not a murderer.”
Then, Tony’s lips were on his, in a familiar, established, but questioning, I’m-down-if-you-are kiss until Tony realized Steve wasn’t down, for he started to test the eventual separation of their mouths with the lingering motions of ending the kiss. When, at length, Tony did pull back, the spell between them broke like a frail soap bubble.
“Yeah, but watch what you put in your mouth,” Bucky said on the opposite side of it. “In the morning, spiders come out of hiding to warm up.”
“You could have thrown it away. I wouldn’t have minded.” He glanced at his hand from which his own ring was finally absent. “I
Clothes were dropped on the floor on his way to bed. It dipped and Steve caught the smell of cigarettes and distilled malt—the saloon.
A silence swelled. Out of respect to Rhodey, and having more than a few secrets of his own, Tony did not point out how he had stayed up and through the wall heard the sound of steps and rustling while the eery wind howled outside, and how they had been replaced by the sound of deep, slow breathing only after the sky had shown signs of breaking dawn.
“Have you — have you truly not heard? Dad bought Reed Tech.”
Deciding no for the former, and yes for the latter, Steve wiggled into thick wool of the uniform. It was a much tighter fit than he had expected, having lost some of the bulk required to carry the 60-pound equipment. He trailed down with his fingers the row of golden buttons.
“I hope you’re sure, because this launch of the initiative is sooner than I’d have liked.”
“Hmm … what?” asked Steve, who looked as though he was surfacing from a very deep thought.
Rogers stopped looking at the shelves.
Rogers gritted, though his relieved shift of weight from one leg to another was at odds with his berating tone. “What in the God’s name are you doing in here?”
Tony blinked — Obie and Hammer Sr. were poised chest to chest — the others, Stone and his partners, knelt by the body, which, as Tony now saw, was heavily bruised at the head, a rivulet of half-dried blood trickling down a temple. The glasses, that had minutes ago glinted in light, laid crooked and cracked at the end of a broken nose.
“It was so good of Mr. Jarvis, bless his poor heart, to try and direct the blame off you, sir, by smartly mentioning the burglary,” she noted conversationally.
Bucky whistled, and wandered to it. “Someone’s unhappy.” He picked up one and straightened it, “’Progress stalled … cannot deliver … blah, blah … will not recur…’” Bucky balled the letter back and sounded impressed as he continued, “Huh, never heard of Tony being stalled in anything. Sounds like your boy is fighting back, Steve.”
Pierce let out a cry and collapsed to the floor.
“Oh,” said Jarvis.
“We can’t guarantee his safety,” he warned.
“Home,” Rogers said shortly. Then, when Tony looked at him in flat disbelief: “Too many people want you dead.”
“Yes,” Fury said distractedly, digging through his safe, “but my attention is less on what’s on it than what
“What is?”
“Our tickets around this factory,” told Clint, shimmying his hips inside the leather apron and worn jeans. “Like it?”
“You don’t mind Natasha asked Tony, do you?” asked Sam in a troubled voice, as they set off down the street. “I don’t know what’s going on with you two but—"
It seemed to dawn on Bucky he could not hold Steve back and thus, Bucky caught up with him and together they strode forward, shoulder to shoulder. In silence, Sam followed.
Rogers, as though wishing nothing more than to see him squirm some more, gave his permission with visible reluctance.
confess to the father of the victim?”
“The police?” Rogers observed thoughtfully. “Stern’s been rather noticeably mum about his whereabouts.  I think Stone suspects one of his friends and fears Stern is protecting them.”
Inspiration struck: experiencing a surge of savage pleasure, Tony picked it up: now he would know all the things his father had never thought it worth telling him, whether Howard wanted to, or not. Glancing about shiftily, Tony struck it in the thin gab and twisted—
had fled his brain … or had that been the scotch?
Steve felt as though someone had sucked the air out; it was suddenly very stifling in their three-roomed house.
Halfway along the first corridor they emerged into a wide, open space where a hundred women stood in rows by several room-length tables full of Tony-like littering of metal scraps. There was a system to it, though: in unison, the women placed each piece in stacks with similar shapes or color. But soon they had walked further, and the hypnotizing scene was left behind.
And he was just about to leave, hand on the handle when he spied the ring still on his hand.
This had actually caught Tony off guard; his eyes tried to land on something other,
“I hate to see you like this,” Rhodey said, voice respectfully soft, but echoing bleakly. “You’re my best friend, Tony.”
“City utilities,” replied Coulson. “Fire and water service.”
“Oh, man. Cassie’s never gonna believe this,” he said, looking at the land spreading green so far that the horizon was tinted blue. It was easy to imagine, then, how it once could have seemed like the edge of the world.
“You know, your life would be a lot easier if you stopped baiting people you dislike,” Rogers’ voice spoke, then, from out of sight.
With no other choice but to head down themselves, they descended the stairs. On the floor level, the noise of the steam engine-run cogs became almost unbearable and cut down their communication to nothing but hand signals. They weaved through rows of steel pipe columns as thick one’s thigh holding up the walkways half a story higher.
Steve swayed where he stood. The dark, empty room seemed to close around him; he couldn’t quite understand what he was seeing at first. He did not know what to think at all, except that it would be a kind of treachery to believe the worst too soon.
[4] Am I churning historical AU after AU to hide the fact I'm not too savvy about modern tech lingo,which is, coincidentally, pretty essential to writing a character like Tony Stark?
“You won’t stay for lunch?” asked Thor, looking troubled. “Steve’s great warrior friend has yet to come—”
Steve, feeling mutinous, sat mechanically.
“Good, good,” Pierce returned, distractedly, for he was fishing a big set of keys from inside his double-breasted jacket. He got them into the building through another iron gate. When the grille clattered shut behind them, Pierce took off at a brisk pace.
“As long as I get that coffee first?”
“Really? That must have left you out of several, significant stages of development,” said Pepper wryly, “which would explain how
“And why did he have to bring that wretched Babushka?” whispered loudly a woman reclined in a velvet cocktail chair as he passed the group. “What was she called again? Molotov?
Tony sucked on his tongue, though the reminder somehow hurt less coming from the mouth of Barnes, than it had from the man still hovering tall behind Tony.
“How should I present it, then? Need me to dress it up as a request—”
Steve, reluctantly, had to agree.
Being drunk was a curious sensation.
“I guess someone has been very obligingly helpful in telling about our past and my apparent laundry list of character defects, and I have my suspicions as to who it is.”
Before he could even wipe his chin, though, the man was seized by the front of his suit by Bucky, who one-handedly lifted Strucker in air and looked equally enraged. The courtroom gave a collective gasp.
Stane stepped even closer. Tony had no way out but to retreat up the sloping street.
Here, they were met by raised voices.
Apparently, Clint had been following his own train of thought.
“Peachy,” he said instead, and pulled off the pavement with a twist of the wheel.
But it was as though a breeze had snuffed all the figurative candles: all Steve’s relief, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness as the glorious flush of reunion broke.
Roger’s brows crept up. “How did he come by it?”
The floor broke into chaos.
And frequently mortgaged to the hilt
As the cries faded, Stane, with a sneer, backed up onto the steps of the church. Both kept their guns targeted on one another, and Steve, who had just survived what should have been a fatal shot, followed. The closer he got, the more astonished and almost fearful Stane became, and the higher he climbed—until his feet ran out of steps and met with the even surface of the landing…
Steve, taken aback by the directness of his speech, took a while to register the last part. “What do you mean ‘no matter what happens?’”
“You don’t seem like you enjoy the party.”
“Well,” said Pym, looking unblinkingly at Steve, “let the man have his wish. Come on then, I’ll give you a tour.”
And sure enough, Justin Hammer and his smarmy smile swept over impetuously past the glass vases brimming with roses.
Steve looked back at the empty passage spreading behind them, then to the door. Bucky seemed to latch onto his thoughts and tugged Natasha close to the wall as Steve took a couple steps away from the door and brought his body forward. The frame groaned; the latch had sprung loose of its bent cavity and Steve pried it open further by hand, the other side of which revealed to be a lavish, mahogany-paneled room.
Naturally, he had thought, with their businesses being so tightly linked, that they would come to work very closely in the upcoming years. He had been impressed to find the sleepy town already under such capable hands, though this had been nothing to how he had felt meeting the taciturn, grey-haired late Mayor Philips.
“You haven’t brought them with you, have you?” Tony inquired, perking up. “My new security detail’s proven to be corrupt.”
pouring that liquid all over the cornerstones,” she finished and looked expectantly up at Steve. “What do you think?”
Steve glanced at Tony; he could practically hear his brain whirring as he, unconsciously, was spinning around a necklace.
“We’re not finished,” said Rogers to Tony, who had reached out his arm for the trembling receiver. “Do you keep guns in the house?”
“Or,” Bucky suddenly said, sounding weird, “he counted on outliving him.”
“Your job’s crazy,” Lang said, looking down from his saddle in reverence, though his brows furrowed once he noticed the lack of cattle nearby despite their prints all over the street. “Oh, man. Did Cow-coa and Moolissa break free?”
“You’re just as distrustful of authorities as they told me you were,” Fury said, not unfavorably. “You’re wrong about me, though. I do not have a hand in everything. No, Tony Stark was a different mission which just happened to collide with yours, by your doing.”
“Hey, woah, woah,” said Sam, holding a hand in a subduing gesture. “Are you guilt tripping him?”
than the Starling rotary cannon…
I was just feeling a bit discouraged by how little hits this has. But all of you who have found this, you have all been so wonderful in your comments. Maybe I just wasn't realistic enough in thinking I might get the same traction as my previous fandom with its 800+ kudos. Well, my fault. I still want this story out, because when I got read it back as I edited the start of this chapter, I started to feel somewhat good about this fic again... idk...
“We can’t punch our way out of this,” he said, reality closing upon him. “Not now when we’ve lost the element of surprise.”
Tony looked up to the coffered ceiling, the apricot-coloured pressed glass shade of the chandelier. Less than a week ago he had been standing in this exact spot of his childhood bedroom, waiting for the guests of the double-wake to fill the hall. It seemed like a lifetime away. What was he to do now? He stood, immobilized, by the door and he thought of his parents’ death, of the daunting, demanding legacy they had left behind … this house … Stark Industries…
Hammer gave a little, airy laugh, “I already got them, but beauty always draws me back.”
“Yes,” he said quickly, “anything to help.”
This gave Tony a pause.
“I’m fine. It just slipped,” Tony said, “I must have still had some oil on my fingers.” He shook off Steve’s hands and asked with false casualty, “You mean the president-elect?”
“Do you know what’s it gonna say?” muttered Rhodey, muffled by his hand and barely moving lips.
And Steve listened, sense of touch on high alert for every tap, his heart beating fast. His eyes fell on a hydrant an odd hundred feet away; he braced himself, knowing he was using his last bullet, and blew off the valve with a well-placed shot.
“Then where’s that purple-toned collar around your throat from?” asked Rhodey, finger pointing at the general direction of Tony’s neck.
“Until the telegraph pylons are fixed, we’re shooting blind, sir. All our usual contacts seem somewhat disinterested in returning to good old pen and paper.”
“Now we know where to go if we get thirsty,” Sam muttered to Bucky behind Steve.
It had rained at dawn before the skies cleared, leaving behind a lingering chill and several puddles. The spray of water sheared up from under him up to the golden mascot at the front of the bonnet trim as, with a tug of the steering wheel, the car veered sharply to left, following a canopy of large oaks up a drive. Here, he brought the car to a screeching halt that caused it to slide several feet on the loose gravel. He hit reverse and backed until he was level with the arches of the entry.
“Hmm?” he said vaguely, and at raising his gaze, continued airily, “Oh, no, don’t stop your brainstorm for my sake.”
“Choose your two partners wisely—unless you want to go alone?”
Steve felt flushed in the already hot, crowded Town Court. He also felt as if he was floating; every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there in the shadows of the wall feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of Sam and Bucky’s presence next to him.
Steve made to rise from his perch.
“I bet I’ll feel really terrible about it,” Steve remarked dryly.
“Believe me or not I thought it a kinder fate to staging my death. Plus, I didn’t set that molded piece of junk afire, personally.”
British wiring…!”
Tony slumped against the foot of the stairs, breathing hard. Bitterly, Stane let the gun clatter to the ground. To preserve his dignity, he straightened up laboriously under Steve’s judging eye.
“Let me congratulate you on your restraint, then,” said Obie, picking up the glass, and attempted to balance it on the narrow music rack. “All five seconds of it.”
Tony stared out of the window at the inky, blue-black sky. It had been enough of a shock to be strangled; it was even more disconcerting to find out a group of angry old men might murder him in his bed tonight if he wasn’t behind bars. He doubted very much that his being free would stay a secret long in the town. As he well knew, the only thing connecting the first death and the second attempted one was
“Fury was right,” Bucky said, “it
Tony endured this stoically, reaching to grab a salmon sandwich as soon as they were set down on the spindle-legged side table.
Tony had to look at him to see what Steve was showing him: his wedding ring.
Ignoring them, Pym walked to a side table of decanters and filled a glass of liquor for himself. Over its rim, he gave them a dirty once-over. Steve stared back, unimpressed.
“He didn’t tell me much … I thought you’d hit a rough patch,” explained Bruce, who was rather studiously rubbing at his elbow crease under the folded cuffs of his shirt. “But then … you went and ran into a building on fire. Stupid, but heroic.”
he said. “Did you know the prototype for Starling was drawn at the back of a napkin while piss-drunk on a charity dinner? No, and you know why? Because I covered it up. The night he refused to aid Confederates … that was when I was most afraid he would bring down the whole company. Good old Howard, a decent person but a poor businessman. Adults are so much harder to manipulate, I had to change for a younger partner—”
Tony gasped, body seizing… just as Steve’s arms closed around him, blood bubbled from within a hole in his chest, right were the scarring used to be … it spread wide while Steve, helplessly, tried to put pressure upon the wound…
Steve noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried look that met Steve every morning in the mirror. Nobody walked alone. Less time was spent talking and, even less than that, shopping. Trade had slowed down as the usual supply lines were cut. On the other hand, a number of questionable, self-contained salesmen had sprung up. The newest one, who had entered the Saloon in hopes of an easy deal, was taking his sweet time in the face of what should have been an instant rejection. Steve feared this one was just the start of a long list of hardship.
He made to kneel before the rustler, who looked very reluctant to be showcased as proof and was looking around, hoping somebody would intervene.
“Unlike your other men, he’s actually literate!”
“Twenty-one,” he said, feeling uncomfortably warm. It took a while before Strucker got a word in past the animated, mumbling crowd.
Natasha, on the other hand, was looking from one man to another in apparent contempt. “Men,” she scoffed.
Tony’s heart began to pump rapidly. Mostly unaltered? But it should have been a sure deal, they had all agreed on that…
At this, he glanced back at the detective, as though checking the impact of his witticism, but found the man’s pale brows set into a one, severe line as he followed noiselessly; this brought the small talk into an irredeemable halt which, in turn, lasted until they entered the oblong study.
a wasp at an outdoor feast. Buzzing loudly and irritating everybody.”
“Looking like death, huh? You should see the guy upstairs.”
“You didn’t answer,” Tony pointed out.
The hair on the back of Steve’s neck stood up. Jarvis’ hoarse voice seemed to come to him as if from a distance as the sound of cannon fire reverberated through the intervening years. He saw what had happened next like he himself had been present.
“It’s late,” Steve said instead. “I should leave.” Tony’s eyes snapped to meet his. “I’ll be back tomorrow.”
happened to come across them in the saloon, the streets, or wherever.”
“You’re no trouble,” said Tony swiftly.
“See you in a minute,” said Steve, who guided his group to left, while the others took right.
listen so well when asked? Listen to this: go home. Don’t you have something better to do?”
A headache was starting to pound behind Steve’s eyes. “You’re saying Tony lit the fire?”
“May I?” asked Rogers, hand on the back of a chair he was about to draw for himself. He sat down. Just as he pulled out a little booklet, a knock came from the door.
“You would, wouldn’t you?” Tony asked, turning away from the window. There was no accusation in his eyes.
“Air,” said Steve at once. “Open the window.”
“Are we?” asked Rhodey and looked over his shoulder to where Howard rested. “You don’t talk about this. Not about
“No, this is your impulsiveness gone round the bend—”
“The two people capable of running this place are at large,” hissed Natasha poisonously, “so I would be a little more concerned about the future of this country if I were you.”
“Sorry for the killjoy, buddy. Guys like him just can’t handle men like you and me, you know?  If you got it, flaunt it, that’s what I say.”
, was the best word for it. Although outwardly resembling the usual QWERTY design, the Y had moved out to the bottom row and changed digs with Z; and the slot for paper had been replaced by three jagged cogs, each with a small, dark screen by its base; and given Steve’s deepening frown, nothing legible was coming out.
“And I said, no.”
“What about Hammer?” he asked Steve, fighting off a fidget. “Either, really. Both have got a smile like a slit in a letter box. I wouldn’t be surprised if he — them, either — planned to turn this into a Reichenbach.”
“Have you slept well?” he asked. “In a house that’s been broken into … it’s quite common to feel unsafe.”
“Hm, then I suggest you familiarize yourself with the words,
“Steve,” he said with a small voice, “what if he was taken?”
“By which you mean Howard Stark’s only heir?” Bucky said relentlessly, for he was, as they all were, determined to know the full story. “Anthony Stark, wasn’t he?”
Steve felt babied and beleaguered: did they think he did not know Tony was never going to come back, didn’t they understand that it was only the manner of his departure that left him feeling torn? There was a long and awkward silence that was broken by the sound of crinkling and Steve lowered his gaze to his white-knuckled grip around a paper—he forced himself to uncurl.
Steve looked overt the table, too. Where Stane was supposed to be, all but lifelessly sprawled on the cemented floor, was now just a couple pieces of what looked to be a broken pocket watch. As they cursed colorfully, the mindset of leadership was slowly taking hold of Steve.
to tamper with a window, who would have had the means to do it?”
“To tell the truth, Steve,” Tony said, not meeting Steve’s eyes, “I’m not happy here.”
“Maybe it will pass?” he was saying.
“Don’t look at me,” he said, shrugging. “He got impatient.”
The voices, although not more than couple feet apart, were coming as though through a great distance; fragmented visons were already flooding his exhausted mind that was determined to pull him under again—
“Tony never touches alcohol.”
“Oh, good.”
“I never signed them,” Steve said as the realization struck. By law, they were
“Armed?”
happen yesterday to get you so spooked?” asked Sam, eyeing Steve over his cup of coffee.
And though Tony would have rather jumped off the study window than admit it, by the time the shadows had lengthened and the night came his chivalrous decision to have Rhodey removed out of harm’s way was rapidly losing its glory.
With a delay, the ground under them gave an almighty lurch—all around them people were thrown off their balance—the metal columns rattling long after the sound stopped resonating off the walls.
Jarvis looked so troubled by this Steve was about to apologize, but he was interrupted.
“Oh,” Steve said unenthusiastically, “well, we’re doing the best we can. Did you hear the wires might be back up soon?”
“Yeah?” said Sam. “You mean one of the heifers Ant-Man said would win the county’s Harvest Fair for months before we went and shot it? That cow?”
Wordlessly, Rogers exchanged his cup for the receiver. Tony rather thought he was being sneered at for abusing his station, but he did not much care for anything else but the fifteen minutes and then some that had already been spent eying the mulish set of lines on Roger’s face. As Tony pretended to inspect his fingers while listening in to the call, he found there was caked blood under a fingernail. He went to bite it off, then, upon reflection, aborted the order hastily.
“Must be all this sand.”
Before Ms. Althea could say a word, the door to the courtroom was pulled open, and with it, a blast of noise filled the corridor. Steve looked over her shoulder, at the figure surrounded by light. Clint stood there, looking at both of them squished in the corner.
He took them though the house, and in a far-flung room behind a locked door, he dug up five of what looked like thin breastplates—but not of any metal Steve knew. They looked light as Pym handled them, handing them over to the five of them.
Down below, Tony had merely glimpsed a dark thin-brimmed hat, and wide shoulders. Now, he had the chance to take in all of him — fair skin, straw-blond hair, plain pants, and an open overcoat coat that did no favours to what appeared to be a
Natasha appraised him. For a minute, no one spoke. Steve engaged himself with his drink. He imagined the subject of Tony had been closed, but he was wrong again.
the key? Unless, they hadn’t known it was in Tiberius possession … which begged the question: why
Fury chuckled. It was unnerving how, with one eye, you couldn’t tell if his amusement was genuine.
“Do you think we’ll be on time?” Steve asked.
