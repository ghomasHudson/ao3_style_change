to be loved and accepted—even from a distance—often superseded common sense. Because while they wanted to protect themselves from the agony of betrayal, they just couldn’t shake the hope that
being broadcast all over the world? The public is gonna have questions, not to mention the President. I’m not even gonna ask about the shield. You’re lucky it’s me here and not someone else.”
“Yes. The proceeds go to various charities that you support throughout the world,” Jarvis replied seamlessly.
“Alive and kicking,” Judith mused smiling. “I’m seeing a gentleman from my water aerobics class. He’s seventy.”
Steve laughed but it was a terrible sounding thing, jagged and cut with glass. “I’m angry. Shit wasn’t so cut and dry back home, not by a long shot. The Avengers picked teams when it came to the Accords and when it came to what to do with you. I fought friends. I fought my Tony. Rhodey got hurt pretty bad and my team ended up in prison. You and I went to wipe out the other Winter Soldiers that were supposed to be around but when we got tp the bunker, Zemo had already killed them. ‘Cause it wasn’t about
“I’d like that too,” she mused. “And I wouldn’t mind hearing about this other Pepper whenever you have a free moment.”
“I’m making a mess of this, aren’t I?” Steve asked, completely discomfited. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have assumed anything.”
“No it’s not that,” Steve said honestly. “Really it’s hard to put into words. I never thought I would see Tony again, not—not as I knew him anyway and while that’s true here it’s also not. If I’d made sure Howard wasn’t a dick to Tony in my new timeline with Peggy and always been there for him, it would have changed him. Tony was shaped by the experiences of his life so changing the experiences changes him. But here it’s—it’s the truest version of him without actually
? Put Steve’s mind at ease in some way? The issue was she didn’t know the depth of their…shit. A lot of it revolved around the Civil War but she wasn’t an idiot—there was more.
Steve rolled his eyes but it was clear he was in a good mood. “How about you show me what you else you’re working on in here.  C’mon. Blow my mind, Ms. Stark.”
“Okay,” Toni said eyes on her tablet again. “Is this prime reality home or alternate timeline with Peggy home?”
There was also this tether business that he couldn’t even begin to comprehend, not really. He understood the basics but
know the details he can come by but he has to keep his stupid trap shut afterwards. No telling Hope or her dumb dad.”
“I know he annoys you but I hope Bucky Prime back home can have…that.” Steve gestured towards the direction Bucky had gone. “I hope that he finds a balance to his life and is able to experience joy. Be a bit of a smart ass again. I think hanging out with Sam will really help him. I foolishly thought having me in his corner was enough…”
Sure enough minutes later Rhodey was strolling out of the elevator with his bags in hand, dropping them so that he could catch Toni as she all but skipped into his arms. She hugged him tightly and kissed his cheek with a loud
Shifting, Steve twisted so that he was facing her. His eyes focused on nothing before settling on her face almost like they were forced. There was a resolute shine in them that she noticed from old clips where he’d been planning the next attack. Whatever he was about to say he was determined to get it out. “Bucky says you helped him after everything he did. Or was made to do.”
Glancing around like he always did before giving her a little smile, Rhodey made his way over to where she was currently perched. Grabbed up the extra stool with its shiny black wheels and pulled it close so that he could sit beside her.
Toni smiled; she kinda loved this old lady. “They are. We’re having a low key dinner so that they can meet a new friend of mine. And you know Bruce loves your croissants. I’ve had to put on the armor to get them away from him.”
“Ten thirty, sir. Breakfast is ready if you’re hungry. I..” He paused, his voice going dry. “I have been asked to inform you that you should come to the kitchen even if you’re
Toni poked her in the side. “I bet she has more shoes than you. I bet they have Jimmy Choos over there we’ve never even heard of.”
Barnes was a…touchy subject where she was concerned but she could tell seeing him had helped Steve. Figuring it would was why she’d called in him and Nat in the first place. No doubt Steve was drifting and rudderless in this world not unlike his own, so seeing a friendly face would help to anchor him.
Steve pressed his hands against the counter, shoulders curving inward. “Can I—would it be okay if I just sat with you while you worked? I mean I’ll probably end up falling asleep but…”
She sniffed at him. “Says the guy who was making animal noises earlier. Leave me be and get back to your girlfriend before she comes to her senses about you.”
Toni shook her head. “No he’s not doing that. But I do think there is a lot of unresolved shit with Tony Prime that he’s just now thinking about, and realizing it’ll never be solved. And my dumbass wants to help him…but I can’t. You know I don’t like situations I can’t take apart and fix. At most I can figure out a way to get him back to Peggy and make sure the Time Wraith leaves him alone. I suppose it’ll have to be enough.”
boss!” Toni chuckled before sobering a little. “Rhodey and I fight and I always feel terrible afterwards, even if it wasn’t my fault because he’s just…he’s
Toni’s brows narrowed; sometimes she questioned why she’d given him snark. “Yeah yeah whatever, J. Why don’t we both change though? You probably can’t catch pneumonia but I can. J be your oh so helpful self and direct Steve to the guest suite.”
“Then I—I’ll just do what I did when I first got there. Explain the bare minimum and we’ll start over. It’s not like she won’t be happy to see me.”
Steve laughed again, so hard his shoulders shook. “Then it obviously got what it deserved. But I find it hard to believe anyone could think badly of you now, especially after Thanos.
She snorted. “Yeah not yet anyway. Okay well um I guess we can have Jarvis order you some stuff to make your stay more…homey. And don’t say you don’t need anything because that’s horse shit. Barnes doesn’t
return there, the Wraith got involved. Could be it didn’t even see Steve as a person but as an extension of the stones, considering their role in everything. So stones go back, Steve doesn’t and the Wraith thinks it’s an anomaly it has to correct.”
“I keep forgetting things happened in a bit of a different order because you guys skipped stuff since Captain America didn’t exist here.” He paused. “I think had he not died Tony would have retired again though perhaps not completely. He would have wanted to spend more time with Pepper and Morgan for sure.”
awake?” Her brown eyes landed on his food. “Ah. Right. You carbo-load because of your metabolism. Carry on then.” Humming and with coffee in hand, she strolled off. “J make sure Steve doesn’t eat all of the garlic knots.”
my best friend. I’m just looking out for her.” Rhodey straightened. “I get that she’s an adult and could probably make some sort of tech to take over the world, but we’ve been through a lot together. When she was in that coma after tangling with Thanos I was worried sick that she would never wake up again. Now I hear there is a world out there where Toni
Suddenly Toni’s voice was drowned out by a loud alarm echoing throughout the building. “Ah fuck…” She took off running towards the elevator and Steve followed. “The one night I didn’t wear the arc reactor to dinner and assholes are on the prowl. Big ones if J is sounding the alarm.”
“I’m sure you helped him a lot. I mean he’d still be in Hydra town if it weren’t for you.” And then she was scrunching up her nose at him. “Hey Jarvis, put on a movie for us. Something ridiculous that will make Steve smile.”
“It’s okay, Toni.” Steve stepped closer so that his chest brushed her back. “I want to talk to him too. There won’t be any violence.”
Different reality aside the only person who seemed different was Bucky, and that was largely due to Nat’s influence and the absence of the Civil War. Yet as he’d been sitting around the dinner table earlier filled with familiar faces, he couldn’t push down that feeling that he was an outsider, especially considering the circumstances. It hadn’t been as debilitating as when he’d discovered he’d apparently traveled seventy years into the future but it’d still did his head in. In another life these people were his friends, his allies. He’d fought side by side with them and sometimes against them, but he’d never thought he’d actually have to start over where they were concerned. Introduce himself. Shake hands. Be the subject of Bruce’s excited questions and Rhodey’s quiet stares. But in a way he guessed it was the meeting he’d never got with the others, a calmer meeting without the influence of Loki’s scepter or what have you.
Toni found Steve sitting on the soft brown shag carpet in front of the sofa, fiddling with something in his hands. He seemed distracted and perhaps with her bare feet it was easy to sneak up on him and peer over his shoulder. Or he just knew she wasn’t a threat so his senses weren’t on high alert. Either way when she peeped over she noticed the
He’d almost forgotten. “I saw something. This floating, flying thing in a tattered robe with no eyes. I think it’s what pulled me away from Peggy and dropped me here. Wherever here is. I was going to follow it and make sure it didn’t hurt anyone.”
“Sound hypothesis ma’am,” Jarvis said with obvious affection. “My research has turned up quite a few instances of them being referred to as
“This whole tether business.” She pinched the bridge of her nose. “You’d tell me if—if you weren’t cool with it, right? Not that there is anything I could do about it but still…”
For a moment Toni wondered if she recognized him—it would be silly to think no one realized how much he resembled Captain America—but from the mischievous twinkle in her eye that obviously wasn’t the case. It was just Judith about to be completely inappropriate; something Toni loved about her.
Minutes later they were walking into the gym, the sound of Pepper’s high heels alerting that they were coming. They found Barnes and Steve stretched out on blue mats laughing about something, both perking up when they noticed they weren’t alone. Steve got a soft smile at the sight of Pepper and stood, slinging his towel around his neck.
people cared was enough. It meant she didn’t have to reach out during a bad moment. Just knowing someone was there to reach back…made her feel all warm inside.
Toni laughed from her place behind the fence of the batting cages. She tapped her bat against her ankle and watched as the machine spit out another ball towards Steve, which he of course hit across the field and completely out of sight with enough force to probably break the sound barrier. It was a delight to watch for more reasons that one, the top perhaps being the relaxed joy on Steve’s face. He was having fun and everything that appeared to be weighing him down was gone for now at least.
In the few days that had passed he’d settled into a slight routine that had been easier than expected. Jogging with Bucky to Coney Island. Hanging out with Toni in her workshop or just in general. Sparring with Bucky and Natasha while getting to see how they functioned as a couple; which turned out to be very well. Where he came from the very idea of Buck and Nat ending up in a relationship was as foreign to him as some of the technical jargon Tony used to ramble off, but here—like other things—it fit. He could tell by the way they looked at each other that they were very much in love. And while Steve was happy for them he felt a pang of sadness for his Bucky who didn’t have this. Who would never have this because their Natasha was dead… Though he did get on well with Sam, and it wouldn’t be the first time an antagonizing relationship turned into respect. Knowing that Bucky had Sam to look out for him was one of the reasons he’d been able to return to 1945.
Steve smiled and felt his chest fill with warmth at this impractical person in front of him. They were strangers and yet they weren’t, not really. It didn’t make much sense to him but he supposed it didn’t have to. “Can you make one?”
“Hey Cap!” She’d already flung his door opened when it occurred to her that perhaps she should have knocked first. “I—oh.”
“Someone should tell your face.” Toni dug her fingers into the back of his neck, massaging lightly. “It’s okay to not be okay. But since we’re talking… Earlier before the alarm went off I asked what you’d do if I couldn’t get you back to Peggy.”
When she was a little girl the idea of meeting Captain America had been something that caused her to feel delighted excitement. It was something to bring her closer to a cold and calculating father who never seemed quite interested in the other things she could do. At first she’d assumed Howard had wanted a boy to carry on the Stark name but then she realized it had nothing to do with her gender. He just didn’t know how to be a father to a living, breathing invention. But when they talked about all of the amazing things Captain America had done he lit up.
It was obvious Bucky and Toni weren’t the best of friends but they were civil, able to rib each other despite the horrible circumstances that brought them together. Over the years they’d found an even ground and while it filled Steve’s heard with joy to see, it also made him sad. Would Tony and Bucky Prime have circled this way if he’d told the truth instead of lying for so long? Would Tony have been able to forgive the man who killed his parents and taken him in simply because Steve had asked…the way Natasha did here?
He snorted. “Okay. Tell me that stops you from creating the amazing things you create or from being Iron Woman and I’ll let you take all the shirtless pictures of me you want.”
since his day and in the beginning he’d been mildly flustered at all of the skin women chose to show. He wasn’t sure if he was a less is more type of guy and he fully respected a woman’s right to wear whatever the hell she wanted, but he had to own up to the fact that those pants on Toni were something else. They supported and accentuated every curve, moving and sticking to her body like a second skin. A part of him felt like he shouldn’t be looking but he couldn’t help himself. His eyes were just drawn to the way the fabric hugged her ass and her thighs, how it tapered down to nice legs and strong calves.
“Alright I’m off.” Pepper dropped her phone into her purse. “It was nice to meet you Steve. Perhaps we can all have dinner together soon. And Toni I expect you to answer my texts even if you are involved with your new friend. Walk me out?”
for a fact that he had been. Still, no regrets. Steve smiled a little and walked over to kiss Tony's cheek just as he was fiddling with the tie. "I like the Santa," he hummed with a half smile.
"Whoa, buddy." Sam put a hand on his ankle to still him. Steve was on some kind of medical bench. "Calm down. It's just us."
Tony knew Steve could feel his trepidation.  He knew Steve could feel how anxious he was.  But not knowing was worse. Tony would rather know.  Even if it wasn't his mark, he'd learn to accept it. The important thing was that Steve was in his bed, not Bucky's, and that Steve had chosen him, not Bucky.
"Or something," agreed Tony.  "...have you talked to Ty? Tiberius Stone.  He was at Pine Hills; he's got all sorts of dirt."
"You do you too, Kitty," he told her with a small nod of his head and then they were stepping into the elevator and Steve was relieved to be getting out of there. The elevator doors slid shut and it was like Steve could breathe again. He slumped against a wall, feeling small and his chest still feeling tight.
"I don't think they'll let you out of the country, Steve," said Tony delicately.  He wiped his face off with a towel and gave his goatee one final examination, making sure the hair was even on his jawline before walking out and sitting tentatively on the edge of the bed.
Then Steve felt it catch against his hole and his entrance twitched. He made sure to hold Tony's gaze as he slid down. Steve loved this position. He could always angle his hips down
Pepper looked alarmed, but Rhodey felt that hard love was probably the only thing that would work at this point.  Steve looked lost, anxious.  Not as bad as Tony, but certainly not well.
Tony felt a smile tug at his lips.  There it was. That usual omega desperation to please, to pamper.
"Shouldn't last more than an hour," said Happy as they turned into the parking garage.  It was a reassurance; Tony couldn't help but feel that the building and its surroundings were ominous, and he could feel Steve's unease in his own stomach.
Cooper pouted, clearly not impressed. Laura reached over to take Lila from Natasha and then smoothed out her hair from where it had been ruffled by dinosaur attacks. "It's okay. I'll keep them occupied. You guys take as long as you need."
Steve turned to face Tony and pointed his phone at him. "You need to calm the hell down Tony. He's sick and he's confused and he needs treatment."  He could tell Tony was about to protest; he cut him off. "He did whatever they told him to.
Tony had already picked out at least one restaurant he wanted to eat at.  It was a pub located on Frying Pan Alley and Tony's interest in going there largely had to do with the name of the street it was on, which sounded delightfully whimsical, like something straight out of Harry Potter.  He figured Steve would get a kick out of it.
His first instinct, to push Steve down and stand over him protectively, was throbbing through him.  He wanted to tear someone's head off.
They stepped into the pizza place and stepped up to the counter. Ian started reeling off a loud of orders. Steve hung back, still holding Tony's hand.
Natasha's phone chimed and she pulled it out to check it.  "Clint says hi," she said without replying to Tony.
From the front steps of his house, Tony jutted the heels of his hands out, hit the jets, and shot upward, leaving Steve below.
Lightning-fast, Natasha was suddenly behind Sitwell, a garrote around his neck, choking him.  His eyes bulged and he gasped, reaching up to claw at it.
"I'm really not hungry," insisted Tony, coming up to side of the pool. His eyes lit up at Steve's mention of a shower.  "Yes! Yes, I want to shower! ....will you wear the collar again?"
July slid into August, then early September, and Steve moped around anxiously.  They were using condoms a lot more regularly now. There had been no more talk of Bucky, for which Tony was grateful.
"Goose chase.  ...perhaps. But I'm not due for at least a month.  Can't we at least keep him until then? He's a valuable ass--"  Pietro caught himself, but Wanda had already heard what he was about to say.
Steve stepped in after Tony and then shut the door behind himself. He leaned against it. "What's wrong?"
Steve offered Tony a small smile of reassurance as he laid down against the chair. The gel felt cold in his hair, he didn't like it all that much. The wires, too...it reminded him of the serum transformation. While, arguably lifesaving, it had also been painful.
Steve stepped back with a shiny look in his blue eyes. "I'm gonna go run a bath, yeah?" He said as he grabbed a pancake, rolling it up and devouring it in about two bites. He was a good cook when he wanted to be. "Maybe shoot Pepper a text now, if you want to..." he suggested tentatively.  Steve offered a small but genuine smile. "I'll just go run that bath now."
Sam stared after him, heart pounding.  He regretted standing up for Tony earlier.  A couple of minutes into the mission and Tony had already pulled two incredibly tasteless pranks.
"Mr. Rogers-- I mean, Captain-- mister-- Steve-- hey!  Mr. Steve!" The Asian girl was tugging on Steve's sleeve insistently.  "Your mate-- James-- James is in a fight-- with your mate-- hey!" Over the music, all Steve could really make out was "your mate" and "James" over and over.
"Yes, sir.  Understood."  Clint's gaze moved over to the cube.  It was lovely, the purest blue, ever-shifting, swirling, like the reflection water makes on surfaces when it's back lit by water.  He liked to watch it from the rafters. Sometimes, when he stared too long, he felt like he was dropping into a pool; that the cube contained something bigger than itself, that there was a vastness it encompassed and that he could fall into it, that, just for a second, he wasn't looking at an object, but a doorway, something as incomprehensibly huge as space itself.  And then he would blink and that glimpse was gone. He had mentioned it to Natasha, who had advised him not to tell anyone. "They already think we're unstable and crazy," she said. "Better to lie low." Clint had to admit, it did sound crazy. So whenever he felt himself staring into an abyss, he blinked a few times and looked away, and usually, by the time he looked back, the cube was itself again, and he assumed it was nothing more than a trick of the eyes.
“This looks amazing, Steve. Thank you for making breakfast,” Peter says, as he sits and picks up the fruit bowl. He scoops some onto Tony’s plate, ignoring the grumbling, before taking some for himself.
Peter looks around to see if there is anyone else in the garage before leaning up and kissing Tony gently on the cheek. “You don’t need to impress me with your fancy cars, Tony. I mean, cars are nice, but I like you without them too.”
Tony, apparently just noticing, rolls his eyes, “Of course. 5 minutes. Don’t make me send Steve over to get you!” Peter nods and Tony heads back across the hall.
Tony blindly grabs between the cushions, muttering that Steve had left the lube there the last time they were on the couch, unable to take his eyes off Peter stepping out of the pool of fabric and back toward him. Peter places one knee to the side of Tony’s thigh, and bracing himself on Tony's still clothed shoulder, swings his other leg to Tony’s other side.
“Sure thing Mr. Steve.” Peter replies as Steve shakes his head with a laugh but watches Peter vault over the couch like it’s a curb rather than an armrest.
Peter keens as Steve stops, just the tip in. Steve bends to look Peter in the face, concerned that it’s too much too fast, but Peter meets his eyes and demands, “Don’t stop! I need it.”
“Oh please Sir, please fuck me. I want it, want you.” Peter replies desperately, wiggling his hips, trying to impale himself on Steve’s cock.
Peter stood in the foyer of Stark Tower, surrounded by fancy dresses and polished shoes, and hadn’t felt so underdressed since his first night out as Spider-Man. He tugs on the cuffs of the slightly too short jacket, trying to get them to cover his shirt sleeves, glad for the first time that he decided to leave his web-shooters at home. Corralled with the crowd into the ballroom, Peter gets his first glimpse at Tony Stark himself, standing next to his husband of 4 years, Captain America, Steve Rogers. Their coming out and engagement announcement shocked the world, but also encouraged an entire generation of people to be who they wanted to be, and love who they wanted to love. It gave Peter, like many of his peers, the inspiration to come out themselves his junior year of High School. Seeing them now in the flesh was amazing. And loud. Peter’s incredibly glad that he’s wearing his noise cancelling earbuds tonight or he wouldn't be able to stay in the room for much longer.
Peter feels Steve slide in another finger and start stretching him around Tony’s cock. By time Steve has three fingers in alongside Tony, Peter’s whimpering and groaning at every press into his body. Peter feels Steve’s fingers slide out and then his freshly lubed cock push in. Peter knows what he agreed to when he nodded at Tony, but this is just so much more. The feel of both Tony and Steve, moving together, in and around him is just-
Steve ladles some soup into Peter’s bowl at his nod and then some for Tony, before serving himself and sitting.
“Steve, I need to come.” Tony whines as he fucks up into Peter’s tight heat next to Steve’s hard cock. “Yeah. Yeah, hold on Tony.” Steve pants as he pulls out long enough to unsnap Tony’s cockring and then plunges right back in. Tony lasts another few hard thrusts from Steve before he’s crying out under Peter, flooding Peter’s insides and coating Steve’s cock. Steve groans at the feeling and slams into Peter a few more times before he cums inside Peter as well.
Peter can’t help but tune out his obviously rote-memorized script to listen to the sounds and timbre of Mr. Stark’s voice. He’d been half in love with Mr. Stark since Jr. High and being able to listen to him like this, without the distortion of a recording was amazing. Eyes closed, stuck in his own little fantasy, listening to Iron Man talk, Peter whispers, “God Mr. Stark, mmm, so hot Daddy.” Hearing his own voice out loud sparked Peter out of his daydream just in time to hear Mr. Stark thank everyone for coming. Peter glanced up at the stage to be drawn into the intense stare of Captain America. Out of all of the people in the room, he was looking right at him. Holding eye contact, the Captain raised one eyebrow and mouthed
Peter’s flushed and embarrassed, but so turned on he almost cries when Steve finally pushes in again. Steve sets a quick rhythm, pulling Peter back, bottoming out on every stroke, and then causing his cheeks to bounce as he pushes him away. Peter’s drops from his elbows to smash his face and upper body into the mattress, even pushing the pillow away so he can breath through Steve’s brutal pace.
Mr. Stark didn’t even wait for a response before turning and walking toward the podium where the Captain was waiting for him. Most of the group Peter was standing with followed, closer to the front of the room, but he stood, waiting behind the crowd, senses already a little overwhelmed with the crush of people.
Peter slowly raises his head, looking right into Tony’s face, close enough to almost kiss him and holds there for a moment before pulling back and away, rubbing his face with his hand. “Yeah, food, table, sounds good.”
stuck. I figured he would tell us when he was ready.” At Peter’s nod, they all relaxed a little on the couch. “Anyway, why do you think I’ve been feeding him so much? Have you ever seen him patrol out there? I mean, in the suit? That must burn thousands of calories an hour.”
Peter showed Tony around his lab and his experiments before pulling up the specs for his Fellowship project. Peter was trying to make his webs into a less recognizable spray adhesive bandage. Over the afternoon, Tony starts standing closer to Peter, and if they were both looking at something together, he sometimes laid his arm across his shoulder. Peter had a hard time not blushing constantly, but kept up a steady internal dialog of
“Wow, Tony,” Peter says, as he reaches his free hand to cup Tony’s cheek. “Thank you. That means everything to me.” Peter presses a soft kiss to Tony’s lips before turning,
Tony and Steve share a grin and a kiss over Peter’s shoulder as they hold him through his aftershocks.
At 3:05, there’s a quick knock on the door before it opens and Tony walks in. He’s wearing a bulky jacket, dark shades and a crazy, multi colored, knitted, striped winter hat.
Steve makes a quick pasta dish and showers before taking the casserole back to Peter’s house. He hopes he’s not over stepping, but places it into Peter’s oven to finish baking before sitting on a reclining chair to watch his guys sleep.
“Hot,” Tony calls from the couch with a smirk. “Little kinky, though, thought you were trying to make a good impression on the kid.”
“Hey there guys, gals and non-binary pals, look at all my future geniuses all here in a group. I have like a minute to say hi right now, Steve’s been riding my ass about this speech and not in a good way if you catch my drift, so I can’t stay and chat, but I want to! Can you guys just hang out for a bit and I’ll be back after ok?”
There’s a quiet knock on the door before Peter hears Steve say, “Peter, bud, I can hear you crying. Please let me in. I’m not mad at you son… Please Peter.”
Steve sighs as he marches them toward the couch to sit, “Oh Pete, don’t think we won’t talk about that too, but now’s not the time, ok? Let’s handle one crisis at a time. Tony’s upset that you ran out upset, and
Peter stops in the hall, backpack still on, near the door to the bedroom when he turns back to face Steve. With only the slightest blush on the tips of his ears and a furtive grin, explains. “Tony and I were working on something for you in his workshop today. It’s kind of a surprise, would you like to see?”
Tony flicks his button open on his jeans and yanks the zipper before hoisting his hips up enough to pull his pants and boxers down to his knees. He looks up at Peter as he shucks his shirt off, pants around his ankles already.
going to be sore tomorrow, that's for sure. But we’ll take care of you, isn’t that right, Pete?” Steve pauses to watch Peter enthusiastically nod. “This is how we say thank you for taking care of us, Tony. You get to fuck our Baby, as you get fucked as well, just like you like it.”
“Oh, Baby, I’ve only got one in me tonight, so I’m going to save it for later, but you’re free to try to get it early.” Tony tangles his hand into Peter’s hair and pushes his head down over his cock, pushing into Peter’s throat for just a moment before letting Peter lift his head. Tony pushes him down and pulls him up over and over, Peter’s spit now covering his balls, before pulling Peter off completely, pressing him over onto Steve’s cock which is still standing straight up and waiting for attention. Tony continues directing Peter’s head before saying casually, “Here Stevie, you take him for a while, he’s such a good boy for us.”
. More than Peter has ever felt, fuller than he has ever felt before. He closes his eyes, hanging his head, letting the sense of completeness take over.
Tony surges up and catches Peter in a deeper kiss, pressing his tongue along Peter’s, before he can continue talking.
“I’ll have you know that it’s freezing out there for one, and two, you’d better be thankful that I’m wearing this disguise so the reporters don’t come swooping down on you for knowing me.”
a smirk sliding over his face as he states, “Now, what’s so great about this workshop of yours? Looks boring to me.”
With Steve’s help, they all stumble down the hall to the bed, before falling into it, pressing Peter in the middle of the pile. Steve makes everyone take at least a long pull from the bottle before he pulls up the blankets and turns off his bedside table light. Peter’s asleep before Steve’s even turned back toward him.
“They know who I am, they’ll hold the table for me as long as it takes. And really, they don’t expect
Peter’s eyes widen and he tries to move, but Steve just holds him tightly. “He’s just joking Baby, we’re both happy you’re here. But now that you are awake, you should really eat something.”
“Slow down, I gotcha.” Steve comforts him, as he presses one hand onto the small of Peter’s back and uses his other to line up, before slowly pressing in.
Peter tries to not blush as he answers, “Yeah, I mean no, I mean, I was there but I didn’t meet you. You didn’t forget, I had to leave a little early.” He glances up at Steve, not able to hide his blush.
Tony explains as he rushes them down the sidewalk toward his waiting, running, car, “My workshop! In the Tower! It’s done, and the workmen are gone, and the elevator’s working again, and FRIDAY’s gotten everything back together with DUM-E and U, and they’ll be so excited to meet you!”
“Pete. God, Peter, Baby. Couch,” Tony answers between thrusts of his own. He directs them back toward the couch, never breaking lip contact. Tony reaches down and grabs Peter’s thighs, hoisting him up and around his waist for the last few steps before he spins and sits on the couch, Peter on his lap still grinding into him.
“I think I’ll pick all three today, Baby.” Steve says as he spreads Peter’s ass apart and licks him with a flat wide swipe. Peter groans, pressing his face into the pillow and his backside into Steve’s face. Steve licks, alternating wide stripes from his balls to his hole, and pointed pushes into it.
By time Peter has actually opened his eyes, Tony is standing nearly under him, bare chested in sleep pants, eyes flicking between Peter’s Spider-Man suit in his hands, and Peter on the ceiling, shock showing clearly his face.
Tony smiles at him before wheeling back under the electronics box. “Hey though, while you're here, wanna help me out and hand me the 11mm socket?”
Steve toed off his boots and yanked off his suit jacket before answering, “Stole a Quin and then rode my bike from the tower.” Steve strode over into the living room with purpose. “Now, what’s our huge emergency?”
“Wait, no. Sorry Tony, you just caught me off guard a little… again.” Peter runs his hand through his hair and longingly glances at the empty coffee pot before stepping back and gesturing Tony inside. “Yeah, I’ll make some coffee or something. Go, I don’t know, sit?”
“Damnit, Tony,” Steve starts as he pulls off his cowl. “Emergency, you said. If you called me home to have sex with the suit on, I’m heading right back there and staying for a week.”
“Oh, Baby.” Steve starts and takes another step forward, arm reaching out as if to touch. With Peter’s head turned to the side, he can perfectly make out Steve's form in the reflection in the dresser mirror.
Steve pushes his pants and boxers off his hips, causing them to drop to the floor as he steps back to the couch, sitting next to Peter's head. “Look at our baby, Tony. He’s such a good boy,” Steve coos at him, as he pushes one hand through Peter’s hair and uses the other hand to hold his cock to Peter’s lips. “Our good boy.” Steve says above him as he thrusts shallowly into Peter’s mouth. Peter groans from both the feeling of Steve’s cock in his mouth and the praise.
Peter cuts him off with another quick peck before turning to the bedroom door and in a rush, states, “Great! Give me 5 minutes and then come in, ok?” Without waiting for an answer, Peter ducks into the bedroom and shuts the door.
“Yes!” Peter cries, enthusiastic about his consent. Peter’s already rock hard and starting to twitch with just Steve’s tongue.
“God, Baby, you feel so good. So tight for me, ready to come. Come for me Baby, let me feel it again.”
Tony replies with a pained groan, tilting his head back against the couch. “You’ll be the death of me, Baby. You can’t talk like that when I can barely think as it is.”
Steve hands the remaining glass to Tony, who also guzzles it without hesitation. Steve collects the two empty glasses before placing them on to the side table by Peter’s head.
“Anytime Peter. I’m happy to care for the health and wellbeing of my brainy boys. Now! Let’s eat before it gets cold, and why don’t you tell me all about what you’re working on here. Tony comes home regaling me with stories of your experiments but I’ve never gotten so see it up close like this before.”
“I go to Columbia. Um, I actually have a Stark Fellowship there for my Master’s in biomedical engineering.”
Steve, watching Peter strip, commands, “Tony, take off your pants or I will do it for you,” but then turns and with a softer voice coaxes, “Peter wants to show you how grateful he is. You’ll let him, won't you?”
Peter tried to sleep but it was restless all night, he emailed in sick to his Prof’s for the first time ever.
Tony huffs out, “Only you could think of food at a time like this, when there’s physics to be done!”
Tony lifts Peter’s head and sits on the couch, letting Peter use his thigh as a pillow, as he teases Steve, but then places a small red metallic box on Peter’s chest, almost touching Steve’s nose.
They finish their cereal and move to the couch to wait for Steve. Peter’s just nodding back off, warm in a blanket and pressed up against Tony when he hears thunderous footsteps heading up the stairs. “Incoming,” Peter mumbles, which makes Tony look toward the door. It takes another 30 seconds for the door to fly open, and Captain America to step inside.
“That’s it. Good boy, our Baby. Taking it from both of us so well. Too bad Tony’s not here to see you now. All fucked out and ruddy, ass wide open for me to take. So pretty, Baby.” Steve rambles as he approaches his first orgasm.
Peter pouts silently and just snuggles deeper into Steve’s arms and the blankets surrounding him. Too much work to get up.
Steve rubs a hand down his face and sighs, “I was going to tell you Tony,” Steve shushes Tony’s bluster, and runs his hands from Tony's shoulders down, calming him, to hold his hands. “I hadn’t talked to Peter about it either, I don’t think that he knew for sure if I knew.” They both look over to Peter who had stuck his head out of the blanket pile to watch. He shook his head in a quick no. “We knew Spider-Man was young- we figured a student based on his periods of being more active in the summers and around school breaks. You would have known this, too, if you had shown up for a meeting once in a while back then.”
Tony swiftly removes his fingers and grabs Peter’s hips, slouching on the couch as he pulls Peter up to him. With one hand steading Pete, the other directs his cock into Peter’s waiting hole.
Tony runs his hands down Peter's sides before settling them on Peter’s hips, “You’re so beautiful Peter, perfect, so strong.” Tony is awestruck as he traces one finger over the defined abdominal muscles that Peter is holding so tightly to stay upright and not lean into Tony.
“Of course, Peter.” from FRIDAY, and a muffled grumble from Tony is all he hears as he steps out of the room.
“I think I found Tony’s gift for me, Baby. It’s nice of you to deliver it like this for me. Such a pretty package.” Steve grins as he wipes his fingers on his own cock, slicking it just enough. “Ya ready? Want me to give you something to send back to him?”
“6:45. Get down here- right this minute, Peter Parker- and explain to me not only why you have a Spider-Man suit in the back of your closet, but why you are currently on the ceiling?”
“Wait! It’s fine Pete,” Steve says with a gentle smile as he steps in, carrying 2 plastic bags that feature Peter’s favorite Thai restaurant’s logo. “I’m well versed in wooing a genius, Peter. I knew that you were heading into the lab this morning to get some work done. You’re not the only one who gets
Steve wraps his arms around Peter and pulls him in with a light kiss to his forehead. “Of course. I can text you a reminder next time too. But I know that sometimes genius waits for no man, plans or not, so if you need to be working then I’m happy to come take care of you here.”
Steve beckons Tony to slide closer to him as he hauls Peter up and onto his lap. Tony arranges Peter’s long legs over his own, as he’s pressed into Steve’s side. Steve adjusts Peter so his head is leaning on his shoulder and has one hand around Peter’s waist. Steve reaches behind Tony’s head to his shoulder to pull him in snug as well. They sit for a moment, just cuddled together, before Steve breaks the comfortable silence, “This is perfect. Thank you, Peter.”
“Peter, you’re amazing, Baby,” Steve says as he starts to stand, “I’m getting you a drink. You need to stay hydrated for the rest of the evening. Tony, you want some water, too?”
Tony grips Peter’s ass cheeks and slams him down, grinding up in a circular movement. “Hard, Baby? I can do hard. You better hold on, though.” Peter gets almost no warning before he is lifted and brought back down hard, over and over until Tony’s swearing, sweat running down his face, and Peter’s clenching his whole body, trying to hold off until Tony’s ready.
“Thanks, Tony. I’ll keep that in mind. I don’t think I’m planning on spending the night, but maybe I’ll see you later?” Peter questions.
Tony reaches for and holds Steve’s hand on top of the table. “We talked about it and decided that we wouldn't leave here until your semester was done and we could talk to you about where you wanted
After lunch they moved to the living room and spent most of the afternoon talking. They discussed Peter’s studies and then about the new exhibit in MOMA that Peter had taken Aunt May to. Steve talked a little about the Avengers and about his art that was in the hallway.
Peter moans in wordless enjoyment as Tony’s hands track all over his body. “Daddy, please!” Peter whines Tony’s name as one hand gets close to his hole without touching.
“No, Peter,” Steve interjects, “it wasn’t like that at all. It really was just like we said, the apartment was supposed to be taken by another Fellowship student, but they didn’t move in. All of the rest of the properties were too far out of the city to make it feasible for me to still get to the tower. We didn’t know that you were the other tenant until we met you that first day.”
“You could just stay with me. Here, I mean. I’m sure my bed’s not as big or as nice as yours, but you’re welcome to stay.”
“Yes, I want this.” Peter sighs out, leaning his head back against Tony’s shoulder, just before he hears the lock on the door disengage.
Tony pulls out his finger and quickly presses two back in, twitching and flexing them into Peter's slick warmth. Peter sighs a little with a low groan before admitting, “I fucked myself on a dildo this morning in the shower thinking of you. I’m ready. Fuck me, Daddy.”
“Nah, there is a real emergency, it’s just not world-ending at the moment. You did make great time though, was that under 45 minutes? From the compound?”
“Not shocked, baby girl,” Tony finally replies, “Completely astounded, amazed, flabbergasted and astonished.”
“More.” Peter moans as he finds his breath. Steve reaches to fondle his balls and finds that Peter hasn’t softened at all.
Tony grabs both waiting mugs, and as he hands one to Peter, comments, “You’re right, Pete, he does love me. I have a shirt somewhere that says,
Peter turns to look at Tony, who’s looking so hopeful for a positive answer that Peter just nods, not trusting his sleepy calorie deprived brain to not turn his
Peter wakes to a loud knocking on his door. Well, it started as a knocking but now was almost pounding. Tipping his phone up to see the time, he groans and stretches, feeling two things that have to happen before he can even think about the door. Peter slowly stands and wobbles his way to the bathroom, stopping only briefly to yell, “Just a minute!” at the door. Bladder empty, now he can focus on his equally empty stomach. He quickly grabs a protein bar and swings open the door while taking a huge bite.
“Please Steve, please Sir.” Peter begs as Steve halts his movement, but spreads his fingers wide inside him.
Tony holds Peter’s hips still and just lets Steve rock into him, gaining rhythm and speed as Peter’s body lets him in. Tony moves one hand to Peter’s shoulder and Steve reaches to hold him there too, fingers entwined, pressing Peter tightly between them. Tony and Steve take turns rocking into Peter, finding that it’s hard to both fuck into him at the same time.
Tony shudders and has to visibly pause to get himself back under control enough to be able to respond.
Tony shoots a troublemaking grin at Steve before looking back at Peter, “So what do you say kid, wanna come be
While waiters passed appetizers and beverages, Peter found a group of older looking students to mingle with. Most of the kids there had brought parents, so it was easy enough to find the other Fellowship recipients. They talked about their undergrad majors and their upcoming Fellowship projects, and while one of them were attending Columbia with Peter, none of them had moved into the same building. Jamie had decided to keep her apartment with her husband rather than moving. Peter actually was enjoying talking with these other recipients, but kept an eye, and part of an ear, out for Mr. Stark who was walking around the room with Captain America greeting the other kids.
Peter blushes and looks down at his napkin, “I mean yeah? I know I’m nothing special, and it’s hard to believe that something like this just happens, ya know? It would make more sense..”
“Mmm.. I suppose,” Tony starts, as he sits up and slides out from under the covers. “We’d better get out there though, or he’s going to eat it all without us.”
Tony almost chokes as he scoffs incredulously at Peter, “A Rubix Cube? You think that I’ve spent the last 3 weeks in the lab building you a
“Just for me, Baby? That’s very nice of you.” Steve says as he slowly starts to rock the plug out, teasing Peter with it. “How should I find this gift, Baby? Should I search for it with my tongue, with my fingers, or with my cock?”
“I woke up early and had to go to the bathroom. Your room is frigid compared to the warmth you put out, so I was going to grab a sweatshirt before starting coffee. I mean, I wasn’t looking for it if that’s what you mean.”
“Got it under con… Wait, why aren’t you shocked at this? That’s your hiding-stuff-from-Tony face. I know that face.” Tony stands and pushes a finger into Steve’s chest, staring up at him with a scowl. “Spill it.”
Peter makes it most of the way through his first sandwich before asking, “Sorry if this is rude, but what are you guys doing here? Don’t you live in the Tower?”
“Pete, you stay just like that, but head up onto the armrest. Tony, on your knees.” Steve pushes Tony’s body into the position that he wants, ass up, knees spread, face pressed into Peter’s crotch.
Huge fantastic thank you to TellMeMoreAgain who is fantastic and amazing and is way better at grammar and punctuation than I can ever hope to be. All remaining errors are because I don't learn from them very well.
Tony heads his way with two mugs a few minutes later and sits next to the mound of blankets. “Coffee Delivery with extra sugar here Pete. Where’s your hand?”
“What?” Tony questions as he spins around. Seeing Peter’s upset face, his softens. “No, Baby. I’m not mad at you. I mean, I’m concerned that you kept such a big secret from us and, Peter, I can do the math, you were just a
it. This came straight out of your mind, just you could make this and it's just for me, just because you care about me.”
“You said I could try for it,” Peter replies with a wink, his puffy lips rough and reddened and stretched in a sassy smirk.
Steve reaches for Peter’s hand before continuing, “While we didn’t go looking for you, we weren't going to turn down the opportunity once we saw it was you. We just got extra lucky that you’re beautiful and smart as well.”
It takes some more sweet talking and reassurance that he’s not mad from Steve before Peter’s able to calm down enough to reach up and unlatch the locks. Moving just enough for Steve to fit through the doorway, Peter’s still on the floor, curled, head down onto his knees.
“Sure thing Pete. Steve’s already up and getting it ready for us. Maybe some water too huh? Steve, some water too please!” Tony calls into the kitchen while walking next to Peter, who is slowly making his way to the table.
Tony now standing close enough to reach, touches Peter’s shoulder gently. “How about I’ll make the coffee and you go sit. My fault here, this I can fix and get it for you, ok?”
“You know that he’d never leave you out. He loves you too much,” Peter mumbles, still with his face buried under Tony’s arm.
At the sight of Tony’s grin, Peter clarifies, “Just for sleeping! I’m not kidding, mister, you keep your greasy pizza paws to yourself!”
Tony spins around as he reaches the back of the lift and grabs Peter’s hand, yanking him toward his chest and kissing him with more tongue than is strictly appropriate for a public place.
“Oh yeah! I mean, yes, I’m ready to go out to dinner with you guys. But I think you’ve wined and dined me before Tony, we’ve had dinner together quite a few times.”
Steve has added a finger along with his tongue, trying his best to sway Peter’s attention back to him. When he swipes directly over Peter’s prostate with a casual, “Oops,” Peter almost bites Tony.
It only takes a few more thrusts of Tony’s strong hips directly against his prostate for Peter to come again, crying out Tony’s name. Peter’s whole body tightens as he comes, forcing Tony to buck into Peter’s heat, gasping, as he comes as well.
Steve scolds him gently, “No Baby, Tony told me about your three orgasms and outstanding equestrian skills, along with the three you had with me, you really need to
“I ate already, but I got one for you too. You should eat and then get some work done so I’m not a liar when I tell Steve that you’re hard at it.” Peter grins at the unintentional double entendre before tossing Tony his sandwich and a bag of chips. “Any words of wisdom for me as I set out to seduce your husband?”
“14 then, jeeze.” Tony looks up to the ceiling and lets a long breath out. “Did anyone know? Was there anyone to back you up if things went wrong? Was anyone in your corner?”
With Peter moaning and squirming, filled with Steve in his mouth and full of Tony in his ass, his muscles start to shake as he tries to hold his orgasm, not wanting this to end. “I can’t give him more without getting up for the lube. Steve, wanna help him out?” Tony comments with a salacious grin. Steve smiles back, “Of course, here, get it slick for him?” Steve holds out his hand, fingers raised to Tony, who leans forward and licks, swirling his tongue around his palm. Steve caresses Tony’s cheek with his fingertips before reaching below Peter to grasp his dick firmly. It only takes a few pulls of Steve’s spit slick hand, along with Tony’s accurate fingers to send Peter over the edge. He cums almost silently, mouth still stuffed with Steve’s cock, before pulling off and resting his head on Steve’s thigh. Tony pets up and down his thighs and over his ass after pulling his fingers out of Peter, waiting for Peter to find his breath.
“Not just most days,” Steve says as he’s putting the last of the pancakes on the platter he’s made already, “
Steve finds them curled up together on the couch an hour later, Star Wars still on in the background. He looked first in their apartment before checking the location of Tony’s phone, but hearing what he knows to be both Tony and Peter’s favorite movie without Tony’s voice accompanying it makes him try the door first before knocking. Steve smiles at them both before turning back to his kitchen to make supper for them all.
Tony dresses Peter in Steve’s undershirt again, before they head down the hall toward Steve, who is humming a jaunty tune under his breath while flipping pancakes. There’s fresh coffee already brewed and two mugs are poured and waiting on the counter.
Peter laughs enough to make his Prof glare at him. He hides his phone under his table and glances around before texting back.
Peter takes a shaky breath before heading to the bathroom. After brushing his teeth and running a cool washcloth over his burning face, he sits on the bed and grabs Tony’s pillow, breathing in his scent for what he thinks might be his last time. Gathering his courage, he runs his hand through his hair before cautiously heading down the hall and into the kitchen.
Tony, grasping his chest dramatically, leans back and replies, “Mortal wound! Ouch, Petey. See if I take you to Carmine’s now, only cheap delivery pizza for you.”
“But Peter’s our guest and we’re not making him sit alone in the back on the way to our first date.”
“Boss’s heart rate is elevated, his blood pressure is reading higher than usual, but I detect no major impairments and no unusual brain responses. Perhaps you just shocked him?”
Steve frowns at Peter on the floor before kneeling himself and scooping Peter up into his arms. Startled, Peter jumps a little and sticks to Steve’s arm and shoulder, the closest thing for Peter to grab onto. Peter realizes what he did too late for Steve not to notice and tries to curl into himself again.
“Yeah Baby, come all you want, you’re taking it so well.” Steve pants and growls out, as he comes, never slowing his strokes.
“Oh kid, you might have busted him. I like it. Please keep doing that,” Tony says, as he points Peter toward his car, leaving Steve standing frozen in the elevator.
“Yes Steve, this is an emergency. -- No, not like the time I couldn’t find the Venezuelan coffee beans. I mean it, a real deal. -- Peter! Yes, it has to do with Peter. -- What, so when I say I have an emergency you ask questions, but when it’s Peter you come running? I see how it is, Steven Grant Rogers. -- Yes! I want you to come home, no, I’m not arguing with you. Just- Peter’s place ASAP.
“Hey Steve, there’s all of the Fellowship students, let’s go over there next, yeah?” Peter hears Mr. Stark say to Cap from all the way across the room. “Sure Tony, but you’ve got to give your speech in like 2 minutes, so a quick hello is all you’ve got time for ok? And I’m not kidding this time. Pepper’s already giving me the stink eye.” Tony mumbles an affirmative answer as he veers over to Peter’s group on the way toward the stage.
“Oh, Baby, come here.” Tony pulls Peter into a desperate hug. “I’m not mad at you. I’m scared for you. I’m scared because of all the times you almost didn’t make it home, and all the times that you were hurt. I can’t... God, another superhero. Do I have some sort of pheromone?” Tony wonders out loud, but it makes Peter giggle in Tony’s arms. “Speaking of superheroes, hold on here for a minute.” Tony kisses Peter quickly, but then pauses, and kisses him again, licking into his mouth with a moan. Finally pulling away, Tony dashes back into the bedroom.
They arrive at the Tower in record time, Peter holding on to the door and dashboard with his sticky fingers. Parking in the private lot and heading up the elevator, Peter meets FRIDAY for the first time.
“Come sit Pete!” Tony calls from the small dining room attached to the kitchen, and Peter heads that way. “Steve’s almost done with lunch, he’s making fancy grilled cheese and soup. Wait, you don’t have any food allergies do you?”
Peter remembers, but he didn’t think they did, in fact, he didn’t know how Tony could know about it at all. He wasn’t the one with super soldier hearing. Peter looks up at Steve’s face and sees a hungry grin. “Tell him Baby, tell him what you called him the night of the scholarship banquet.” At Peter’s blush Steve continues, “He already knows Peter, I told him that night. I told him there was a hot young twink in the back calling him Daddy in his daydreams.” Peter’s blush deepens as Steve and Tony step back up to him, Tony once again whispering, “Yes what Baby?”
“Speaking of how I like it, come for me, Pete, let me feel you ripple around me,” Tony commands. Peter reaches down and touches himself, only taking a few tugs to come all over Tony’s chest. Steve pauses his eager thrusts to watch Tony pick up a bit of Peter’s cum with his finger and feed it to back to Peter.
Then Steve slumped over, hissing as a spasm shuddered through him. He felt a low heat coil in his belly and screwed his eyes shut as he let out a short huff of hot air. "Fuck," he whispered. Phil didn't let go of his hand even when Steve squeezed tighter. "It's coming back."
. It was nice to hear it out loud. It made him feel almost giddy. He realised he was smiling, blue eyes glittering.
"Mad doesn't begin to cover it," Nick cut it in coolly. He glanced to Tony, still asleep, then back to Steve.
"It's just a bad day," Steve told the guy (his name was Marcus) tactfully as he gently rubbed a hand up and down Tony's back. George passed over their pizza boxes. Steve wasn't sure he really felt like eating now himself.
Donner," said Donner a bit defensively.  "And I already have enough problems with people mixing me up for Steve Rogers... I don't want the name, too.  I'm a
love a man in uniform?" mused Tony, grinning ear-to-ear.  He looked back toward the stage. Taylor Swift was handing Steve a microphone.  "Oo, are we doing karaoke? Rhodey, you wanna do
"Don't talk like that," Natasha said firmly and squeezed Steve's shoulder.  "Tony wants you.  Your old bond doesn't matter; that was over half a century ago.  He'll come around, Steve in time.  He just needs time."
Boswell waved a tired hand at them; Donner glanced up and his eyes got even wider.  "Boswell Mackabee," he mouthed, not managing to even make any noise.
"I'm Tony Stark... I'm here to rescue you," said Tony.  He turned to Steve. "You take room five and I'll take room three."
"...thanks for being so understanding with us," said Tony suddenly, looking up, unusually appreciative on Steve's behalf.
Steve blushed crimson.  "So...what's after this?" Steve asked, trying to sound casual, inspecting a piece of cucumber with a smile. "More spa stuff? Dinner? ...bed?"
He wished he just call Dugan up right now. He'd be the perfect person to talk to... Steve wondered where he was buried, if he had family. He hadn't even asked.
“Thanks for coming to check on me, Toni.” He reached up and squeezed her shoulder. “I really appreciate it.”
Natasha sat down beside him. “Sounds like my kind of girl.” She met his gaze. “I hope you’re not blaming yourself for what happened. It needed to be done so she did it. When people like me decide to become the good guys we don’t half ass it. We go all in and if that means dying for the cause, then we die. Sounds like her sacrifice wasn’t for nothing.”
Toni eased around until she was standing next to Steve, shielding him with her body. “He’s…Steve Rogers. Not
Steve smoothed down his shirt and stepped up beside Tony, drawing Nick’s critical eye. “It was me. I’m Captain America.” He held out his hand to be shook. “Steve Rogers. It’s…a long story.”
“Yeah it was nice,” she replied after a moment. “I’m glad that everyone got along not that I thought otherwise. Rhodey and Bruce were bound to like Steve. Everyone likes Steve. He’s a very likeable guy.”
Toni propped her chin up with her hand. “So. Besides making Steve look like he’s about to burst out some god-like powers, what does this do?”
She made a face. “Harry Potter. Look can I just get a run down on them, please? Why do they exist? What do they eat? Are they housebroken? How would one theoretically stop one?”
Did he? He honestly wasn’t sure. He wasn’t sure of anything anymore. “What the fuck is happening to me?”
Jarvis hummed and the curtains closed as a projector screen slowly lowered itself from the ceiling. “One ridiculous movie, at your request.”
need a plus one otherwise I’m liable to feed all the orphans or fix all the broken fire hydrants in the city.”
She didn’t want to ask because a part of her didn’t want the answer but… “Are you sure you’re going to be alright…here with me I mean? Pouty lips and boobs aside; I am your dead friend. Grief is a terrible fucker and I would completely understand if—if I caused bad thoughts.”
to. Maybe you put the idea into his head but you didn’t force him to act on it.” She touched his thigh. “You more than anyone should be familiar with survivor’s guilt. Tony would want you to mourn and grieve and cry like, tons, but then he’d want you to live. Live and be beautiful and happy. It’s what I would want.”
He put his phone off to the side. “I want to believe Tony accomplished everything he wanted but with how he was, it’s like the sky was never enough. He could have done so much more. But he was happy before—before. With Pepper and their daughter. Tony was happy and I…”
They spent about thirty more minutes at the ball park and Toni did manage to hit a few balls, though they didn’t go nearly as far as Steve’s had. Before leaving she signed some baseballs for a group of kids and took photos, introducing Steve as her new bodyguard. Then they hit a vendor up for hot dogs and ate them on a bench while people quickly went about their afternoon.
“Of course not.” She frowned and looked at him over her shoulder. “But then I’m smart enough to come up with another solution. Honestly…your earnest—ness is a bit…jarring. There.”
Before Toni could huff about him being rude a yellow fizzing portal was opening in the middle of her lab and Strange was stepping through, red cape flowing artfully behind him.
was turning into his future. If he managed to get back to Peggy would he run into a version of himself already there?
Rhodey flew overhead towards the front of the line. “Smart thinking, Toni. I’ll take care of the ones at the front.”
Toni snickered. “How about I get that fridge out of the way so we can get your jewelry? As much as I’d love to keep you here to myself, I know your adoring public awaits.”
Toni combed her fingers through her long dark hair. “I don’t know. They say actions speak louder than words and before Gulmira, I acted like a fool. Some people never got over that I suppose. Or like the tabloids they never wanted to because
Now it was her turn to squint at him. “Are you bullshitting me or…” When he didn’t reply she chuckled. “Okay. Well Steve it’s nice to meet you. I’m Toni. Toni Stark.”
Steve’s shoulders drooped. At the time he’d thought crashing that plane was a death sentence and he’d made quick peace with it because what else was he going to do? He’d never imagined what would happen afterwards. All of the amazing things he’d see and the people he would meet. Being able to save Bucky… “Oh. Him being dead probably changed a lot here then.”
“They’re all my rooms!” Toni shouted pointing at him. “Careful you don’t end up sleeping on the roof.”
Toni batted at Bucky’s metal arm. “Dude seriously he’s not a threat I swear. Nat please get your boyfriend.”
“Why wouldn’t he want me to know?” he asked walking over to the fence. “I’ve never liked bullies. I wouldn’t have—I’m not a bigot. I believe people should be free to love whoever they want.”
It was clear Toni didn’t want to leave but she grumbled and followed Nat down the hall towards the small library that also doubled as a den. With them gone Steve turned his attention back to Bucky and motioned to the sofa where they both slowly sat down.
“Oh Mr. Rogers, be careful what you ask for. You’re going to need a cigarette by the time I’m done.”
Toni combed her fingers through her hair. “To be honest that would depend on the laws of their universe. Although probably similar to here I wouldn’t be shocked to find a tiny difference in there somewhere. Logically it just tracks. If their reality is built on the theory that changing the past creates a completely
Tony hummed. “Do me a favor and get a couple of quick scans for me. Photos too and put them on my private server. I want to have a look at his attributes later. Compare and stuff especially if this goes the way I think it will.” The elevator opened with a low beep and she strolled out, coming up to lean against the bar.
“No. The parts used to make the soldiers yielded no real results since they can be purchased wholesale from several retailers. Mostly for department store mannequins. The wiring was crude which I’m sure was to deter you from interfering. I suspect they will have to up their game if there is a next time.”
Pushing those thoughts away he returned to his drawing, losing track of time until Toni was padding across the floor in tight jeans and a baby blue blouse. She looked showered and refreshed, and happy.
Steve rounded the corner in a tight white t-shirt and grey sweatpants. Or maybe it was a regular t-shirt and just tight on him. “I’ve probably said thank you a lot but I am grateful for all of your help Toni,” he said softly.
Pinching the bridge of his nose, he cast his thoughts out to Peggy because that was something he could deal with. Was she looking for him or did she even remember him showing up at all? Hell did that timeline even still exist now that he wasn’t in it actively shaping it? Technically that was his past because this new
Just having someone in your corner—a true friend—tell you it was okay to be unapologetically gifted…well it was one of the reasons she always went out of her way to encourage others like her. Like Peter and Harley. She never wanted them to feel shunned because of the amazing things they could do.
where he was actually supposed to be? It was clear that Nat and Bucky both thought so; he was a bit scared to ask what Toni thought. Not to mention he didn’t want to look too deep into his own subconscious. “Is that what you think?”
Toni had seen the old black and white picture reels of Sergeant Barnes and Captain Rogers. Knew the triumphant story of Krausberg and the devastation of that Hydra train. When Barnes had popped up as the Winter Soldier she’d idly thought the wrong person had survived. That thought buried itself into her chest and took root after finding out what he’d done to her parents. Years and years thinking Howard had had too much to drink only for the truth to perhaps be even worse. They were murdered and their murderer was Captain America’s best friend.
Strange rubbed at his chin and then walked a slow circle around Steve, eying him thoughtfully. “If you mean do I know you don’t necessarily belong here, yes. Your energy is in major fluctuation but I can tell it’s settling already. Who are you?”
“Toni learned at a young age that she would have to play the game. That being the smartest woman in a
Steve blinked, caught off guard by the question. He’d never thought about Toni not being able to do anything, because Starks constantly pulled off the impossible. But…“Then…I guess I’m moving in permanently.”
“And you think he’s, what? Using you as a crutch because his Tony died?” Rhodey inquired slowly. “That’s a dick move if true.”
in his head. Every mistake. Every fight. Every way it could have gone differently to end with Tony alive. The kick in the teeth being he couldn’t replay it to
Pulling back, she made a face. “I guess I should go check on Steve and make sure Bruce is behaving himself. Who knows the kinda questions he is asking him.”
I'd just like to thank anyone who is still reading this fic, anyone who has left a comment or kudos and anyone just showing up. I know updates have been messy lol and I do apologize. My dad passed away in February after a rather sudden battle with cancer, and while I did write a little bit (mostly more self indulgent things ;) ) some stuff just wasn't flowing. This fic being one of them. But here I am getting back into the swing of things and I'm excited to hopefully update all of my work in the coming weeks/months.
“Ah I see you’re having a crisis of identity. Makes sense. Well I could give you the scientific explanation about string theory or the astronomical theory but it would just be a lot of jargon not everyone even believes in. I’ve sort of been on the fence about it until you. To be honest Steve the point is that there
? Was it his mission in life to make her comfortable? To raise her faults to the forefront and shove them under a microscope? In what galaxy did Toni Stark deserve the respect of a freaking icon?
Steve would always regret not being able to save Tony because if anyone deserved to live and see what they’d accomplished, it was Tony. He deserved to be there for his daughter, to see her grow up and become an amazing young woman. Pepper deserved her husband alive. Death was a part of war but it never got any easier. It was never ever fair to lose someone you cared about.
“Okay. One of the doctors will be in to see you soon. I lit a fire under their asses but someone chopped off his finger trying to cut open an avocado and since you still have all your bits, I figured he could go first,” mused the woman from before as she entered the room. “Huh…didn’t you have a cut there?” Her fingers brushed his forehead. “Anyway don’t worry about insurance or whatever I’ll take care of everything. It’s the least I can do since I hit you with my car. Even though you also bear some responsibility in this situation.”
“Are you alright? You have been quiet for thirty-five minutes and nineteen seconds,” Jarvis mused. “A near record for you I should think.”
“I’m Toni Stark,” she snickered. “First screw SHIELD and second…my dad made this so technically it reverts back to me. I totally stole it and left a very convincing replica in its place. Not like they go down there and play with it so they’ll never know…unless they do actually go down and try to play with it in which case it’ll break apart like wet clay.”
“It happens more than it should,” she replied matter of fact. “But uh, yeah. I can see how something like that would rip apart the team. Kinda fucked up you didn’t tell him, Steve.”
“Yeah just…thoughts.” She tapped her temple. “Sometimes it’s hard to shut my brain up. But never mind any of that. Tonight is about good food and good friends.”
She grinned. “A lot does. And everyone was doing their own thing. Thor and Carol were off world and Natasha was on a mission. Clint was spending time with his family and Bruce was trying not to go green. Besides we were still new as a team and—and…”
“I suggest removing the Captain’s shield from plain view. Do you think he is going to wish to make use of it?”
“Are you a new one of Toni’s super friends?” she asked looking him over. “I’ve never seen you in my shop before. I would have remembered those cheekbones. I’m Judith.”
“You mean after I ushered one sleepy super soldier to bed? Yeah I did,” she replied as he sat back down. “I got enough to function but I might nap later. I do that now. I nap.”
“Peggy,” he said honestly. “I hope she’s not worrying about me if she’s even aware I’m gone. We were going to…”
Grinning, he shook his head and swung again. “My mistake. Did you really just bring me out here to watch me hit balls?”
and he’d gone because he was good at following orders. Most times anyway. He never found out what Doctor Moreland’s assessment of him had been. Loki showed up two weeks later and the rest was history. And honestly Fury probably would have put him to work either way, trusting or perhaps hoping he could handle it because he was
“Um sure and if he asks why I need them tell him it’s for a top secret project.” She paused. “And if he
“So you want to what? Pay rent? Lift heavy things for my amusement?” Steve chuckled so she continued. “This is the Avengers tower and you’re an Avenger. Speaking of which should I leave the shield out for you or…? I mean no pressure of course but if like, a giant herd of frogs attack would you want to fight them off with me or stay on the bench? With staying on the bench being a totally valid option especially after everything you’ve been through.”
Steve wasn’t convinced. Plate in hand he sat down across from her. “Really Toni it doesn’t bother me.  You can call me whatever you want. I
Toni snorted but her eyes were alight with mischief. “He won’t be laughing when I tell Natasha he harassed me.”
You’d think he’d be used to nightmares of all kinds by now but in spite of everything he’d be through, a few could surprise him even now. A few could tear him apart from the inside out, and he figured had he not always been stubborn and strong he’d have broke by now. Then again there was a good chance he
Bucky nodded. “She found out when her and Nat cracked some usb drive or something. That’s why she didn’t trust me and wanted me dead, not that I blame her. It wasn’t me…but it was. I still don’t know how Nat talked her down from blowing my head off but she did. My name was cleared—what was left of it—and then started the healing to get rid of the Hydra shit. I spent some time in Wakanda and then came back here to be with Nat. Toni put me in that program she created to help brains and it did wonders.” He tilted his head. “Why do you look like you’re about to shit yourself and throw up at the same time?”
Steve exhaled and retrieved his plate when it was ready. “Ultron happened. From what I understand he destroyed a large part of Jarvis and what was left, Tony uploaded into the being that came to be known as Vision. After that he started using an AI called Friday in all of his suits.”
Rhodey cracked a smile. “Odd to think of Captain America as the retiring sort especially with the world the way it is. Bad guys might not be Thanos sized anymore but they still exist. He’s still needed. Seems like there is a lot of good left for him to do.”
Steve nodded. “What do you want to know? I can tell you shit that’s not in the history books. You can also ask Bucky but…not sure I want him recounting my greatest hits.”
Finishing his food, he rinsed his bowl and placed it in the sink. Soft footsteps sounded and he watched as Toni padded into the room in comfortable looking pajamas with her damp hair up in a tight bun. She flopped down onto the couch and put a pillow into her lap, smiling as he stepped around and into view. He returned her smile and sat down beside her, resting his feet on an ottoman.
"Oh, cool, this is from 1974," said Tony.  He pointed to the large model of the fair.  "How 'bout that."
They were running at a leisurely pace.  Well, Steve was, anyway.  Sam was struggling to keep up with Steve's jog. "Gideon called us just now," Steve said. "He's using our own principles against us to try and talk to Donner."
take up some modelling; paying for all those lawyers was going to clean him right out. As well as giving social services all that money so they could build hostels in preparation, and funding all their interventions, and all the medical care that would be required afterwards--
Steve's entrance was tight, warm, and moist; he pushed against it, softly growling into Steve's neck, the mark that was half-his inside his mouth.
"Oh, she's getting chatted up by someone boyband singer." Arcadia waved a hand and then downed her glass and stood. "Come on. Let's go find you some whiskey;
"JARVIS!  Call Aria and Pepper, tell them Steve's cycling... if he wants that interview he'll have to do it today," hollered Tony.  "...and call Gleason about medications!"
He had grilled Natasha after Yemen about him.  She'd been up close and personal and Tony had had questions.
Was this normal?  He had no reference point, no way of knowing.  No one had ever sat him down and explained these particular facts of life.
"It makes me angrier than I can ever express that I can't make him pay for it.  But I also care because it proves how strong you are. It's proof of what you've endured and that you've come out the other side." Steve tilted his head and kissed the corner of his mouth. "That wasn't real." He kissed Tony's bottom lip. "But this is."
Mackenzie appeared back outside. "Guys? Is there a problem?" They'd hung around for a while and Steve was obviously upset. "...what... what did he do in there exactly?"
Then Sam was gone. Steve headed back upstairs and began flicking through articles Aria had forwarded to him:
"Steve! Get him to eat something!" She called out as she headed upstairs but Steve was too distracted by Tony to reply with anything but a moan. He trembled against his mate and whined, low in his throat, arcing his head back into Tony's touch.
"I love this," said Tony, relaxing on the couch, sipping a glass of Malbec.  "Don't you love this, Rhodey?"
"I missed you too," Steve said, words thick. "Missed you from the day I woke up. Before I even knew you were alive..." Then he fell quiet.  Bucky fell asleep before Steve did, the weight of the last hour catching up to him.  Eventually, Steve drifted off too. It was strange to sleep next to him, a man he thought was dead for so long, a man he knew was a ruthless and efficient killer.
It was too much for him. Sure, he could deal with the chaos of a battlefield, but this was something else. Steve wasn't fighting, he was supposed to a be part of it and he couldn’t be, he couldn't goddamn
"I don't want to mate," was the first thing that came out of Steve's mouth. In about ten minutes he'd be pliant and probably wouldn't protest, his body would want it and his mind would accept that but right now he could still be stubborn. Right now Steve could still be mad at Tony. Mad at him for pinning him down on the floor for an hour as he bled and mad at him for saying he wanted to break their bond.
.  He turned that word over and over and over and over in his head.  The way it had dropped from those lips.  It carried the same impact as
Happy just nodded and gestured for Steve to get in. He got into the back next to Tony as Happy settled in behind the wheel.
He curled up in on himself, waiting for his heart to slow the fuck down.  He'd kept himself in control for Steve's dinner and for the ride home but now, he couldn't hold it back any longer.  He needed to let it out or he'd really lose it.  He was shaking violently, gasping fast and shallow, his world reduced to a tiny little pinpoint of himself and his pain.  The first time he'd had one, he'd thought he was dying.  A heart attack, maybe.  But no.  Just a panic attack.  Quite common for people with PTSD, the doctors had informed him.  Tony had scoffed and told them he didn't have PTSD, and never mentioned it again, although he had one or two a month.  But only Pepper and Happy knew about those, and maybe Rhodey.  Tony didn't feel like it was that big of a deal, really.  Plenty of people probably got kidnapped and tortured for three months and then had a couple of little panic spells a month.  Besides, he'd earned this one.  It was warranted, after he'd nearly lost his goddamn mate.
Tony and the other Alpha sized each other up, then nodded approvingly at each other's bruises.  The omega asked for a picture with Steve; her Alpha waited impatiently, clearly in some discomfort.
"And I don't blame you for what's in the simulation. It's not all you, Tony; they put ideas in your head and direct your subconscious in the right direction. There's a reason it goes straight to a battle of some kind for every one." Steve's voice was still soft, cautious almost. He was keeping his gaze fixed on the road.
Tony and Steve smile and both stand, walking around the table, and pulling Peter up from his chair. Steve tips Peter’s face up with a finger under his chin before kissing him softly. Tony then grabs his head with both hands and turns him to kiss him as well, more aggressively than Steve had.
Peter yawns as the credits roll on the fourth episode. Tony presses a kiss into Peter’s curls along with the pause button and comments, “Ya know, I was only partly kidding about the bed being cold. I really don’t
Tony steps in and presses flush against Peter’s back, pulling Peter’s hips back to meet his, nosing at his neck and ear before questioning again, “Yes what, baby?”
decided that they wanted to bring an experiment into our kitchen.” Steve pointedly looks across the table at Tony.
At that, Tony wheels out on the creeper enough to glare at Peter and roll his eyes, “Your lab kid, you earned the Fellowship, you earned the lab. Though,” Tony pauses, thoughtfully, “one day maybe I’ll stop in to see what you’re working on?”
“So, does this mean you like it?” Tony questions, his cocky tone not hiding the insecurity clearly painted on his face.
“Mmm. Perfect,” Peter whispers as he kneels on the couch, crawling himself toward Tony’s lap and giving Steve a perfect view of his ass and bobbing dick. Peter slowly licks around the head of Tony’s cock before giving kitten licks down to his balls, gently sucking on them. Tipping his head so far down, Peter widens his stance on his knees and arches his spine to stay balanced. Peter feels a hand drag up his thigh, then Steve’s finger circles around his hole before Steve spreads his cheeks and licks a long stripe from his balls up over his pucker. Peter has a hard time focusing on Tony while Steve is teasing his fluttering asshole with his pointed tongue.
Normally his assistant would swoop in and escort her out but he had no assistant.  Pepper wasn't talking to him.  Rhodey wasn't talking to him.  Steve was gone.
On the third day Steve woke up with Tony inside of him, their sticky bodies pressed together on equally gross sheets. And fuck, he really needed a piss. With a little wiggle Steve slipped off him, kissing Tony's cheek at his noise of protest before he reached for the light switch. The blackout curtains meant it was always very dark in their bedroom. But Steve knew the layout well and wobbled into the bathroom easily before reaching for the light switch--
"I don't know if I can make any sort of point here, Tony," he groaned. "I don't think anyone here will listen to me. And what right do I have to come along and say they're all living their lives wrong, and are being oppressed? I don't. Everyone has individual situations."
He wasn't sure what to do exactly.  He wasn't programmed to handle this.  He wasn't allowed to masturbate; why would he be?  There was no purpose to it.
But he wasn't sure whether Steve just wanted to order in or not.  He was fine with that. It was difficult to pull himself away from the bed when he was with his mate.
He panted as he came down, leaning his forehead back against the sofa before he doubted he could take his weight. His hands flexed under Tony's now-loose grip and he smiled a little. Steve let out a weak laugh. "I think...we might have to buy them a new sofa," he breathed, hair stuck to his forehead. And he'd just showered. Goddammit.
after promising you Italian, after all."  He smiled slightly.  It took him an enormous amount of effort to climb into the suit; he wanted to throw Steve down and take him again.  But he couldn't stay here all day.
"Nice to meet you Donner," Steve said with an impressive degree of cheerfulness. He thought about offering a hand to shake but he didn't want Donner to get in trouble with Gideon. It wasn't his intention to make anyone's situation worse.
Tony sipped at his coffee, searching the faces for one that looked like Clint's, but none of the omegas really resembled him.  Tony could feel Steve's disappointment in his gut.  But on the outside, Steve was all business; he blew around collecting omegas like Pokemon, leaving Tony to scurry after him feeling increasingly useless.  Luckily, the omega staff, after being told they really had no choice but to abandon their chores and come to the lobby to talk to the police, completely defaulted to listening to Tony instead of Steve.
He looked down at the Alpha at his feet.  Broken leg, not a threat. Tony didn't have the where-with-all to appreciate the irony.  He would have gladly broken the guy's other leg if he thought he was a competitor.
And the way Tony growled and sucked at his neck-- that was goddamn near enough to make Steve wet. Jesus Christ. And him pinning Steve down- despite his size. He wasn't afraid of manhandling Steve despite the serum and that was attractive in itself.
"No.  Six hours before the simulation all you're allowed is water. It sometimes makes people throw up so it's best that way," Steve said, unable to fight back the tug in his chest. He wished Tony wasn't so reliant on alcohol. He knew he wasn't the perfect example of mental health himself but he still cared.
"How is it?" Aria glanced over the bed, pulling a face. "Looks like everything is back in working order."
For months Karpov had been talking about disappearing but it had always be a foregone conclusion to Bucky that he would be coming along.  He realized now that that was never the plan. He had a vague memory of a conversation in Cuba...
"I'll make sure they get done!" Steve said as Pepper walked out, and she shot him a look that was something like gratitude over her shoulder as she went.
"Great!  This is great!  ...and now I gotta join the team, right?  Obviously.  Since we're, you know, the greatest pair-bond ever... we'll show you how it's done, according to this article... Hey, look, look, Steve; look at this one!"  A picture of Steve and Tony stepping out of the car when they first entered the Expo, Tony waving, Steve ducking shyly behind him.  "
It occurred to him, as he drifted off, that people who said he resembled his father were overwhelmingly betas.  Alphas rarely made the comparison, because they were going by dominance, by his scent... and scent-wise, Tony did not resemble his father in the slightest.  And for the first time in forty years, he didn't really care much.
Tony was used to this.  He'd been famous before, but now he was Iron Man; he hadn't been able to go out without people coming up to him.
.  But they hadn't been laughing at him, no.  Clearly, they pitied him, and that was far, far worse.
Tony looked up, his face obscured behind a pair of dark welding goggles.  "...leave in an hour for what?" he yelled over the blaring music of KISS. "This flight-capable, modular armor isn't gonna build itself, you know!"  He reached over to the weld power supply to turn it off, then shoved his goggles up on his head.
Fortunately, when Steve began to weave through the crowd, people stopped scuffling, or at least the omegas did. Steve wore a serious expression; he was one of the only real soldiers in the room. He could have them all on the floor in minutes, possibly seconds.
Donner looked awkward as he got into the car next to them. He was staring at Tony, looking down at his hand, but also watching Steve. He peered at his eyes.
"Do it!" challenged Tiberius, clinging even harder to Pietro.  "Do it; I have nothing to lose; are you willing to put his life on the line?  Huh? Are you?"
Steve didn't like following orders (outside of Tony, he realised) but Rhodey...he wouldn't dare say no to him right now.  "Yes, sir," Steve clipped in short reply, almost feeling like a boy responding to his father before he promptly walked past them and headed downstairs.
The meeting was taking place at a restaurant called Providence in Hollywood.  The traffic was awful, and with good reason; an entire block was shut down by police because of the king.
"Well, that's great, because me and Steve were actually planning to go to Limehouse right now, instead of going back to our room for some mind-blowing anniversary sex," said Tony sarcastically.
She showed him to the edge of the camp where they were still putting up tents for the kids to sleep in. It was a group of men putting them up, mostly alphas and betas. A few were in police uniforms. They were less star-struck around Steve (small mercies).
"Steve.  Since your publicist just walked in on us, can I have Pepper come in to get me a drink?  Even things out?" asked Tony hopefully.
When Steve slammed into Pietro it hurt. He hadn't seen the omega get in front of them; Pietro had simply suddenly been there and there had been no time to avoid slamming into him.  He hadn't broken anything but he had certainly hurt the other and his left ankle throbbed in a way it shouldn't. The other omega seemed in a much worse way than him. Steve felt bad but he also couldn't afford the other coming after him.
These are also the last 2 chapters of this part of Omega Rising.  Part 3 debuts July first, and it's is gonna be lit, so stay tuned!
strip. I'm just... I'm... I'm not good at being happy or having good relationships."  His mouth twitched. "Just ask Beth." He ducked his head, his fingers softly stroking Steve's skin.
Steve groaned, half in protest.  "Surgery?  No, no, I don't wanna get surgery.  I'll do what Tony said, I'll take a pill.  You guys have pills for that nowadays, right?"
Passing through the crowd outside the house wasn't pleasant. Steve got to see Bethany punch a good few more signs in though and that certainly cheered him up. He tried to ignore the shouting and jeering, the general rumble of hate that came off of the crowd; they weren't worth it. Steve squeezed Tony's hand a little tighter.
Tony carried on contentedly for a while, until he had the uncomfortable feeling that he was being watched.
Steve emerged from the bedroom about an hour later, in pants (thankfully) and a hoodie. He went to get coffee and then sat on the sofa, legs crossed and cup in his lap. He was struggling to even meet Aria's gaze though she didn't look mad at him. Just worried.
"I love you too," Steve murmured, voice thick with emotion and sincerity as he returned to sentiment. Tony was hot and pulsing inside of him, a branding mark of claim. He let his eyes slip shut, the feeling almost blissful as he felt Tony's breathing syncing up with his own.
"I'm not helping you put that painting up and if you put it up on that wall, where all the house stuff can see, I will burn it," Steve promised him, raising a brow.  "And thank you, for the flowers," Steve breathed and glanced over at Rhodey. "They're very nice. Thank you."
"Hey!  I know that place; that's that omega school that the auction was supposed to benefit," said Tony, touching the pin.
"What if HYDRA isn't behind this at all?  What if the Winter Soldier is operating alone?  What if something is driving him away from them and towards me?  If that's the case, I think that, in the end...he isn't going to choose HYDRA's side. I can be very persuasive you know."
"Hey. Sorry I startled you," Steve said. He was glad he'd put the robe on. It might have been a bit much to walk out naked.
The guilt that had plagued Tony over the last two yeas was rearing its ugly head again, reminding him that, until recently, he was as guilty as his father and Stane were, unwittingly help this stupid, innocent, fresh-faced kids blow each other up.
Tony found he didn't know what to say.  If Steve was still there and still conscious, this would be the first time they'd spoken for two months.
Tony spotted Pepper swish past in a gorgeous blue gown. "...would you get jealous if I danced with Pepper?" he asked curiously, pulling away to twirl Steve briefly.  Steve, despite his size, could be graceful under the right circumstances.
Steve walked across the street as the car stopped at the zebra crossing and then turned on his heel and got into the passenger seat. He didn't even look across at him. He didn't need to, to know who it was.
"Hey, they're not all from Gideon.  Let's see... this one is from the board of Miss Porter's School for Girls... this one is from Bill and Sharon Whitehall of Ohio... I guess one of their kids-- oo, this one looks official!"
Tony looked up to meet Steve's sincere blue eyes, and suddenly the atmosphere of the room grew serious.
After mating, they'd gone on a disastrous date, then Steve had had his psych eval, then had a follow-up eval, then they'd had another blow-up fight when Tony learned about Bucky, then they'd gone to the Expo the day before yesterday, where Vanko had tried to kill them.
"Jesus Christ," Steve muttered as he watched Tony lick his own slick off his hand. If he could have gotten hard again so soon, he would have.
Steve knew a lot about Tony from when he'd been undercover.  Things like that Tony didn't know how to tie a tie (except a half-Windsor, which he refused to wear) and that Tony was allergic to opiates.  But Tony didn't really know him.
Rhodey appeared from the bathroom with the rescued vase and set it down far away from Tony's reach. "At least don't be sick in any more antiques, Tony."
Steve swallowed, his chest feeling tight. He didn't need to see his own point of view to know what Bucky's corpse looked like tumbling down into the crevasse.
The asset was kneeling to help Pietro.  It wasn't his primary objective but his friend was hurt and he couldn't just leave him here.
Fortunately the conversation was already turning again.  More harmless, polite banter.  Malick came back to the table and gave Pierce a tight smile and a nod.  Tony was guessing he hadn't been talking to a mechanic; some top-secret SHIELD thing.  Heck, maybe he'd been talking with a doctor, getting updates on Fury.
"I don't think me and him really saw eye to eye," Steve said diplomatically. He glanced over at the omegas for auction. They were all dressed in pale, simple clothes. Their hair was done up or slicked back and they wore almost no make up. They were as they would be, day to day, a clear example of the 'product.' Steve reeled internally.
Natasha answered before anyone else could, her arms crossed over chest. "Yes," she said flatly. "A functioning albeit, but
"She's dead," Jarvis said, rounding on him suddenly and Steve blinked. His heart thundered in his chest.  "She's been dead since 1936, Steven.  Surely you remember your own mother's death?"
Unsurprisingly, Boswell's passing left a splash on the headlines, but so did Banksy's speech.  Steve had not appreciated what a closed little secret the beginning of their relationship was; people seemed genuinely shocked that Banksy had been force-bonded in the first place.  Also unsurprisingly, most of them focused on the negative, not the positive.
The moment Tony pressed down on the gland Steve's body light up with sensation. He whimpered and belatedly realised the noise had come from himself . Every time Tony stroked against the gland it felt like he was touching him
"Fuck!  Get the reactor!  Get the reactor!" he yelled, clawing uselessly at the other man.  Trying to bite him, trying to find some vulnerable spot.
By the time they were introducing him to Dr. Brazinski ("or Sarah, if you prefer"), Tony was feeling a lot calmer than he had in the morning.
Tony seemed a little...unhinged but he had just nearly died. Steve gently lead him to sit back down on the couch before he moved to go get his laptop from his bedroom. He almost rolled his eyes. "I have my own Wifi, Tony, I'm not
Tony had to give credit where credit was due.  SHIELD had hit all of his major fears.  Fear of leaving people to die: check.  Fear of losing Steve: check.  Fear of failure, humiliation, abandonment, not being good enough... check, check, and check.  He thought the death scene was weird, though.  He knew Steve's old mate, Barnes, had fallen to his death and figured it was a glitch in the system.  Tony was taking Steve's lead and not mentioning it.
"I'll be honest, I always just thought you were doing crosswords, I had no idea you went to all this work," said Tony.  "Oh, look, there's Elon.  HEY, ELON!"
"Maybe you should fill out this form again," said the nurse in annoyance, shoving a blank form at Tony.  He had marked "no" to everything; on the new form, he marked "yes" as the nurse inflated a blood pressure cuff around his upper arm.
"We're both beat," said Tony.  He couldn't wait to go home, work on the suit... and get JARVIS to start digging up what he could on Gene Bennett and Margaret Turner.
"Oh hi," he said, trying to look casual.  He was suddenly very aware that he was naked and holding a bottle of liquor.  "...believe it or not, I did get work done this morning.  I just came back from a flight.  How was your run?"
"Not if we bred him to the asset.  He's modified," said the younger man.  "All you'd have to do would be to induce heat and then, bam!" he slapped the lab's plain black counter.  "Not even Karpov's precious program would stop him."
He tried to instead engage Pepper with a conversation about Wakandan customs.  Pepper showed unbridled enthusiasm for Tony's apparently taking an interest in actually learning something cultural and talked their ear off the entire drive north.
“Not that I know of.” Peter replies as Steve sets the platter of sandwiches down and heads back for the soup. “Those look fantastic Mr. Steve. Thank you for inviting me.”
Steve glances up and greets him casually, but Peter’s fidgeting with his hands and looks uncomfortable so Steve, now concerned, questions, “Hey Peter, You ok bud?”
Peter looks a little dumbfounded and Tony rushes to continue, “I mean, you are definitely welcome to stay with us in the penthouse, in our room or in one of the guest rooms, or there are different floors, the Avenger’s each have one, you could have whatever you want Pete, or you could stay here, the Fellowship will cover it for another few years anyway. Anything you want, Pete.”
“Jokes on you, because pizza’s what I wanted anyway,” Peter retorts, shutting down his computer before reaching for his coat. “How about Jake’s? Steve still on his training thing with the new kids?”
“Good boy.” Tony says in a low growl with another nip to his ear chased with a sweet kiss, and it’s all Peter needs, as he shudders at Tony’s words in his ear and comes, finally rutting against Steve in front of him.
“Jake’s sounds fine,” Tony mumbles with his scarf between his teeth, as he pulls on his own coat. Once his hands are free, he wraps his scarf around Peter’s bare neck, using it to yank Peter close to him. “Yes, Steve’s away and my bed was so cold last night. You wanna fix that for me Baby?”
“Please.” Peter moans at him as Steve reaches the bed. Steve places his hand on his hip and drags it over his asscheek, down his flank and back up, almost to the plug before stopping. With Steve’s other hand, he gently presses one finger to the base of the plug and
“Thank you spider bite or thank you youth?” Steve comments as he starts purposely missing his prostate as he rocks his fingers in and out of Peter’s squelching hole.
The three comfortably eat through Steve’s large stack of pancakes, Tony even eating more fruit that Peter puts on his plate, before Peter asks, “Hey, I was wondering when your apartment at the tower was going to be completed? It’s been like five months now right?”
“That’s it, Baby. So good for us,” Tony croons, pausing to grin at Steve over Peter’s back. “You can thank me by coming, Baby. Let’s get you all soft and pliable.” Tony redoubles his tease of Peter’s body with his tongue, adding one finger and then two, to press against his prostate.
“Something something about collagen and lean protein and muscle repair and dehydration, I didn’t really listen, but I know it smells good.” Tony winks with a grin as Peter shuffles toward him dressed in Steve’s clothing. “Oh, he’s going to love this.” Tony comments as he pushes Peter toward the door.
Peter sees Tony smile indulgently at him before he really studies the cube, rotating it in his hands. Peter presses his thumb against the slightly concave indent and it gives, his thumb sinking into the cube before it seems to melt and then race up his arm and over his chest, completely covering his body in a moment. With wide eyes and a thundering heart, Peter looks through the new HUD system at Tony in time for him to hear, “Safer than stripping and changing in an alley. What do you think, Pete?”
“Tell me I’m not reading this wrong.” Tony pauses, nose almost touching Peter’s neck. But Peter doesn’t answer, he’s too busy biting his bottom lip, trying to stop his whimper at Tony’s touch.
“So weird. Maybe I’m already sleeping. Maybe I fell asleep on my lab table and this has been a horrible embarrassing dream.” Peter mutters as he trudges his way into his bedroom and flops down to his bed. He throws his phone onto the charging pad and barely covers himself with the blanket before he’s sound asleep.
Peter goes to the perfectly made bed and turns the covers down. He’d hate to stain the quilt, and he wasn’t sure it could be washed. He arranges a pillow in the middle for himself before stripping off his clothes and folding them nicely on the side chair. Steve worries about things like that and Peter doesn’t want his attention divided
Steve, who had finally caught up to then, stepped up behind Peter as he reassured Tony and gently kissed him on the cheek, “And that’s why we like you too, Peter. Alright, everyone in the car! Pete, front passenger side please.” Steve swipes the keys right from Tony’s fingers as he strides by. “I’ll drive, and Tony, your short legs can fit in the back.”
“I just like seeing it leak out of you, Tony’s gift. Don’t you want me to see it?” Steve taunts as he pulls out again. He doesn’t wait for a response from Peter before bending and licking his hole again. “Mmm.” Steve hums, “My favorite flavor. Tony sends the best gifts.”
Steve stands and slowly drags his shirt up and over his head with one hand as Tony circles around Peter’s pucker with the tip of his tongue. “Watch, Baby. He’s stripping just for you,” Tony says between swipes as Peter hangs his head down in an overabundance of feelings.
Peter smiles indulgently at Tony, reaching to hold his hand, but answers Steve. “I’ve never formally had anything measured. I’ve never told anyone else- and no one else has found out. I know that I need to eat about 3500 calories on a non-patrol day, and about 5500 on a patrol day or I go a little derpy.”
Peter sets his jacket and scarf down with a flush and steps up to Steve. “Hey Steve. Thank you for bringing me lunch. I’m sorry that I forgot to set my alarm. I’ll try to do better next time ok?”
“Thanks FRIDAY, I’m very very happy to be back. This is Peter Parker, by the way. Could you list him as a user and um, level 17 access?”
Peter quickly brushes his hair and teeth, after tossing the bar back onto the kitchen counter. He throws on clean jeans and grabs a shirt from the closet, pulling it on as he walks back toward the door. He finds the door across the hall open, so he walks over, locking his door behind him. It would be hard for someone to find his Spider-man suit in the back of his closet, but not impossible, so he always locks the door, even just heading across the hall.
Tony starts showing up at his lab twice, sometimes three times a week. Lab time is usually followed with supper. Sometimes take out, sometimes Steve would cook. Sometimes Steve is there but more often now, it’s just Peter and Tony.
“Hey Pete.” Tony says softly as he pets at the now moving head of curls, “Steve made some supper, are you hungry? We can eat here on the couch if you want or sit at the table. Whatever you’d prefer kiddo.”
“Easy Kid,” Mr. Stark stays, trying to calm the skittish boy. “Just set it down and I’ll get you a glass of water ok?” Mr. Stark heads toward the small kitchen and continues as he walks, “Finals week right? I thought I heard you tell Steve, I remember those days.”
Before opening his eyes, he hears both Tony and Steve quietly whispering to one another. He must move enough to show that he's awake because Tony’s rough hand rubs through his hair and down the side of his face, before a soft kiss is pressed to his forehead.
“What’s up Tony?” Peter asks tiredly, not eating well, and not sleeping much really wipes him out post spider bite.
It’s late March and the weather is warm enough for the doors and windows to be open. After dinner, Peter’s standing at the rail of the small balcony off the living room when he feels Tony walk up behind him. Close behind him. Close enough to make Peter’s heart race. He could hear Tony’s heartbeat too. He usually tried to tune it out when he was around him, but with him so close, it was impossible.
They finish their dessert with only a small amount of talking before heading out to the car. Peter does sit in the back with Tony and tucks himself under his shoulder, content to be snuggled on the drive home.
Suddenly alert, heart racing for a different reason, Peter pulls away from Tony and steps back into the living room. He’s just in time to see Steve walk in and place his keys on the hook, still glancing at the magazine he came in with.
“Making a fool of myself in front of you sir. I’m dead, I swear. Call Ned and tell him I died like a hero will you?” Peter replies, hands on his knees, still trying to breathe, before muttering, “No, better not call Ned, then he’d be dead too.”
“Don’t rush him, Tony, I’m sure that when Peter’s comfortable- oomfph.” Steve’s lecture is cut off by Peter launching himself at Steve, and yanking down Steve’s head to kiss him quickly before the doors of the elevator reopen.
He accepts the glass from Mr. Stark and drinks without looking up, eyelids drooping as he finishes the glass.
“No, I know that.” Peter pauses. “Why did you call Steve to come home early? We could have waited for him to get done.”
“Audi ok with you tonight Pete? Well, there’s not much of a choice, the Audi and Steve’s bike are all we have here, but I’ll call a car if you’d prefer something else…” Tony dithers, showing his nerves for the first time tonight.
Peter looks at Steve, his face so open and caring, hopeful yet questioning. Peter slowly moves to stand and Steve helps him off his lap, then lets him move away from the couch. Steve stands as well and reaches out to touch Peter’s shoulder, but half way there, thinks better before stating, “We won't push or rush you. Please think about it. You’re always welcome to come over if you need to talk or ask any questions ok?” Steve walks up to Peter, who is still not looking at him, and tips Peter’s head up with a gentle finger under his chin, “Ok Peter?”
Tony replies gruffly, “Anytime, Peter,” before dipping his head to hide his emotions. Peter turns and kisses Steve as well, leaning over to reach him. After a few tender kisses, Peter nips at his lower lip before pulling back and winking at Steve. Climbing off Tony's lap and pulling his shirt over his head, Peter asks, “Now, can you take off your pants so I can say thank you properly?”
“That’s enough of that, Steven. We’ll see how you like it. Switch, Baby,” Tony commands as he manhandles Peter around, glistening ass now pointing at Tony’s face. “Stand and strip, Steve. Give us a show.”
“There it is, Baby. I can feel Tony’s gift for me so deeply in you. This is perfect, Baby, thank you.”
Tony and Steve glance at each other before they both turn back to Peter and Steve replies, “If that’s what you want, Peter. You’re welcome to join the team as Spider-Man and have your own floor.”
Tony’s delighted smile fades as he clears his throat. “Um, just tap the backs of your wrists together twice and it will form into its daily wearable form.”
“How many can you go, Baby?” Tony questions breathlessly, feeling Peter’s orgasm was almost enough to get him there too.
“Ready for some soup and rolls kid? Our Stevie’s just finishing up a midnight snack for us.” Tony comments as he pulls a pair of shorts and one of Steve’s undershirts out of the dresser and hands them to Peter.
Peter anxiously checks the mirror again in his bathroom, sweeping his curling bangs back off his face. Tony and Steve were picking him up in about 5 minutes for their official first date and he was nervous. While it couldn’t really look like a date to others, they knew better. While the movie played the other night, Steve, the responsible one, led the discussion on what they each wanted out of the relationship and asked if Peter wanted to tell his friends and family about it. Peter had decided that he wanted to keep it to himself for now, but he told them that he would let them know if he changed his mind.
“Thank you Peter, it’s actually Tony’s recipe, well Tony’s mom’s recipe to be precise. He makes a big pot of sauce every one in a while and we freeze it to use later.” Steve replies with a smile.
“It’s really great Tony, I didn’t know you could cook.” Peter says with a blush dusting the tops of his ears.
“Yes Tony? Come on Baby, that’s not what you said the first night you saw us. Don’t you remember what you called me then?”
Tony turned in his chair to look directly at Peter, before holding out his hand. “Hi! I’m Tony Stark. Have we met? I, notoriously, have no patience and when I want to know something, I want it now. Also, he’s coming home so you don’t have to go through it twice. The new kids can handle a day with Falcon instead. Be proud that I’m willing to wait for him at all!”
Peter’s pressing into Tony, aborted little thrusts of his hips, clawing at Tony’s shirt like it’s his only lifeline.
Tony, still petting Peter, starts calling his name, pulling him from a doze again. Peter wakes more fully this time, sniffing the air and groaning at the amazing smells, as his stomach growls in agreement.
“Welcome everyone to this year’s annual Stark Scholarship Meet & Greet! Everyone here was chosen specifically because they are the best and the brightest upcoming scholars of the STEM world..”
“Aw Pete, you do love me.” Tony throws out offhandedly, already reaching for the coffee pot, not seeing Peter’s scarlet cheeks at the comment.
“Eggs are in the door.” Peter calls to him as he listens to Tony mumble to himself, making a list on his phone’s notes app of tests he wants done.
Peter blushed, looked away, and crossed his arms around himself, mortified that Captain America heard him thirst over his husband.
“Alright, Tony! I’m coming- look even peacefully!- but please, pray tell, where are we going in such a hurry?”
Riding the elevator alone, Peter closes his eyes, leans against the wall and waits for the ding that announces the arrival to his floor. Slowly ambling out of the elevator toward his door, he doesn't open his eyes, until he bumps into a solid body in front of him. He looks up at a very fit, wide shoulders and blond head holding the back of a long couch that may be jammed in the doorway across from his own. Frozen and wide eyed, Peter hears a muffled voice, “I said pivot Steven, not lurch. I knew we should have hired movers Mr. I-can-lift-it-myself,” and then the blond mountain replies as he turns to look back at Peter, “I can lift it myself Tony. Someone just bumped into me, hold on a second ok?”
With a shocked grin, Steve slams all the way into Peter, grasping his hips to keep him tightly pressed to himself.
“Wow, Pete. Time to feed the beast I guess, huh?” Tony says with a laugh, “God Kid, if I didn’t know that we were the only ones here, I wouldn't think that a noise that big could come out of a thing that small.”
It takes less than a day of radio silence from Peter before Tony’s at his door knocking. Peter opens to see a contrite Tony, an expression he hadn’t seen before on the man.
Peter slowly lifts his head to find Steve softly looking down at him. “What? Tony talks to me all the time, maybe that’s the problem..”
“I bet Steve would love it if you went down,” Bucky mused as he sauntered into the room, making a beeline for the elevator.
Toni made a face like she’d just sucked on a lemon. “I know Hank Pym didn’t like my dad and that he passed that bullshit onto Scott where I was concerned. I know they’re what Scott uses in his suit to grow big or small. So shot in the dark? You used the Quantum Realm to travel in time to collect the stones, and you needed Pym Particles to shrink down. Afterwards you used the same particles to travel to 1945 to get alternate with Aunt Peggy. How am I doing so far?”
She strolled into the room and opened the fridge, pulling out a small jug of orange juice. “You thought I wouldn’t be able to handle it? Or you wanted to spare my feelings?”
“You have the best ideas.” Toni fluttered her lashes dramatically. “Though if Jolly Green is stopping by we’re going to need more food, and some of that weird tea he likes. Jarvis put in some orders for stuff the gang likes and make sure it’s here by nightfall.”
Steve gripped his fork a little tighter. “I would have helped you. Had I existed here I would have helped you.”
sun. It was awesome and a story for later if you want to hear it.” She paused. “Why were you running out of the alley?”
“I know what you mean,” Bruce said lightly. “I don’t know how we would be fairing if we’d lost Toni. She can be a real pain in the ass but I couldn’t imagine her not being here giving me grief or talking me down when I need it. Hearing about where you came from makes me realize just how lucky we were in comparison. Our Nat and Toni are safe, and I’m so grateful. But I am truly sorry for the pain you’ve went through.”
Steve watched as she pulled the shield out of the case, blue eyes tracking over the bright red, white and blue stripes before settling on the shiny white star. “Is that—that’s the real thing?”
“Hey Pepper and I argue all the time but we still love each other. Technically she’s been telling me what to do longer than I can remember and I was supposed to be
“I do,” he said without a hint of hesitation or dishonesty. “You might not be the Tony I know but I’ve learned that trusting Tony Stark is always the right thing to do. Hard lesson won but…”
But this Cap was a different Cap. He’d spent time with a Tony Stark and probably knew what buttons to avoid pushing. Plus there was something—
“I think—maybe the point is about second chances though. Or hope that somewhere out there, there is a you that gets it right. Whatever
Jarvis’ voice flared to life. “Ma’am, Miss. Potts is on her way up. I thought it prudent to warn you.”

a guy. He was—he was one of the best men I’ve ever known even though he didn’t always believe it, and I didn’t always show it. We fought a being named Thanos and Tony died saving the universe. A few days after his funeral Bruce said the Infinity Stones needed to go back to where they came from so that the alternate realities we’d created by taking them would be erased. When I was done with that I…went back to Peggy in 1945. I was going to stay there with her. Retire. Finally get a life.”
Bucky laughed. “Smothered between thighs wouldn’t be the worst way to go,” he said with a wink. “But no we—we work for some odd reason. She understands, ya know? She hasn’t done nearly any of the bad shit I have but she has her fair share, and she doesn’t judge. And she digs the arm.”
“We can cuddle up anytime you want, Steve. I’ll even let you be the big spoon…but you have to promise not to roll over and crush me. Funny way to die but still.”
Truer words had never been spoken. Toni Stark was a problem solver no matter what form they were in. It was something Steve had realized immediately about Tony Prime and had begrudgingly respected, though that hadn’t stopped him from questioning his motives. Or his techniques. But in the end Starks got the work done.
However, he felt like he’d gotten better at picking up on the moods of others. And listening to others.
Toni grinned widely. “Hey no worries, Judy fruit. I’ll pop on the armor and move the fridge. Bout time I looked behind there anyway. Make sure a dust colony hasn’t evolved into its own species.”
Bucky remained silent so Steve kept talking. It was like he couldn’t stop. Everything was rushing to the surface, bringing with it the rubble of past mistakes and sharp memories he’d rather not think about. “I don’t regret saving you Bucky, not for a second but fuck if I don’t regret that it cost me Tony in the process. I never wanted that. I never wanted him to get hurt. I never wanted to have to choose between the people I cared about,” he whispered. “And yeah in the end we made up but all that lost time. I’ll never get that back. I’ll never get him back…”

“And yet very much his pragmatic style,” she replied nonchalantly. “The Strange here would have done the same thing without a doubt if he’d had the chance. While fighting Thanos the first time things got dicey and he lost the stone. That was how Thanos got it. Still not sure on the details since I was too busy trying not to get crushed inside of my suit by some big rock monster thing. Anyway after we got everyone back and things settled down, he suggested we should become more
Toni cracked a small smile and brushed the tear off his face. “Yeah. But if being a hero were easy, everyone would be doing it.”
“Steve…” Toni reached out and gently shook his shoulder. “We’re home. Well the Tower which is sorta home.”
to belong because of Peggy but you could probably belong anywhere. Not to mention the Time Wraith probably put you here for a reason. I’d wager we figure out that reason before attempting to send you back or it might just toss you here again. Or someplace worse.”
James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes took one look at Steve and literally vaulted over the couch, landing in front of Toni with a forceful thud. He had two serious looking guns pointed directly in Steve’s face a second later. “Stark get back! Now!”
Tony while looking at her. There was so much pain in his clear blue eyes though. Threatening to leak down around all of his carefully crafted edges. “You’re not going to incapacitate me or turn me into SHIELD, are you?” he inquired.
in Tony’s smoky tone even if afterwards he’d told Steve to fuck off. And then it had rung but with Bruce on the other end and Steve was certain he’d never hear Tony’s voice again.
When Toni still had the arc reactor buried deeply in her chest, sometimes it would ache for no other reason than rain was on the way. Taking it out didn’t change that though the pain lessened considerably. Now it was like a phantom twinge that flared up when she was stressed or ate too much spicy food. Well, there was none of Rhodey’s famous five alarm chili in sight.
“He said the chains will get stronger and higher the longer I’m here. They’ll eventually be to my shoulders though I’ll never feel them or anything; it’s sort of symbolic.”
In the end he’d ended up sending Tony postcards and annoying little touristy stuff from all the places he’d visited. They’d adorned a shelf in the Tower until it was sold.
one but from what you’re describing and you being here, it sort of sounds like you tangled with a Time Wraith,” she explained giddily. “They hate temporal disturbances and if there is one big enough, supposedly they try to correct it. You’re probably carrying a ton of time energy because of all the jumping you’ve done and that energy drew them to you. A man out of time trying to fit into another time permanently? Oh yeah they’d be all over that shit.
The unknown was a terrible thing as was the inability to change the past. Right after Tony’s funeral he’d idly thought about using the stones to try and change things. Maybe doing something as small as leaving Tony a note, begging him not to put on the gauntlet. But according to Bruce’s rules that wouldn’t have brought back
Rhodey stood and flashed her a devilish little grin. “I’ll come with you. I think it’s time I got to know this Steve Rogers.”
“Riiight. And there is no chance I’ll walk in on you doing something weird with it?” Toni asked suspiciously. “Ugh whatever I came in here for a healthy snack, the kind Pepper still makes me eat.” She stood on her tippy toes and felt around on top of the fridge, back arching as she bit her bottom lip. “And buttery crackers. Ooh we should order like a dip platter with ten different kinds of dip and crackers.”
“Mostly. I’ve gotten deeper into scientific research which was my first calling. I like speaking to the younger generation about gamma radiation, and possibly perusing careers in the sciences. But if I’m needed to fight I come when called,” Bruce explained as he cleaned his glasses on a handkerchief. “I’ve always found teaching to be fun and these days more kids are into math and science. It feels good to prepare the next generation for whatever may come.”
“You know that wasn’t an invitation to just come over. I could have been naked. How did you get past my security protocols?”
Strange hummed. “In my studies since becoming the guardian of the Time stone I’ve learned about quite a few different anomalies. I’m curious though where you’d even hear the term
“I’m okay…” Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “It’s been a crazy few years and not all of them were good. In fact they were damn horrible. I’d planned to retire now that things were mellow but I guess the universe isn’t done screwing with me yet.”
“After helping us get rid of Thanos and getting his family back from the great dusting, he decided to take a much needed leave of absence from the hero life. He just wants to watch his kids grow up. Can’t blame him.”
“Yeah but tell them to stay clear for now. I just did a check on vitals and thankfully no one appears to be hurt. Let’s hope that doesn’t change.”
Slouched in the front seat of her Audi, Toni stared at the man claiming to be Captain America as he lightly dozed across from her. After devouring like five cheeseburger combos and two apple pies, they’d piled back into her car to go to the Tower. It hadn’t been a long drive especially not the way she did it but she supposed all that he’d been through had finally caught up with him. Well if you believed him of course and honestly, she kinda wanted to because how damn crazy would
“The higher they go the stronger my connection to this reality grows. He made it sound like sooner or later either I won’t want to leave…or I won’t be able to.”
“Hey Tony gave as good as he got,” Steve chuckled. “But maybe. You’re not my do over though and really I’m just being honest. Even if Tony and I had never seen eye to eye I wouldn’t use your pain to my advantage. That’s not who I am.”
of Steve Rogers was as perfect as apple pie, so she’d always assumed the real thing must have been saint-like. A pure, flawless bastion of walking ideals that would have taken one look at her and known she wasn’t good enough. But that wasn’t Steve at all. Steve was real and messy and
She nodded. “He does. I think he wants more time with his best friend. First and foremost though he wants you to be happy. Anyway just think about it.” She left just as soundlessly as she’d appeared.
“I hope he likes me,” Steve replied eyes on her collarbones. “I want to get along with the people you care about.”
you know? But even when we do fight there is a lot of love there. Hell love is usually the reason. You and Tony Prime loved each other otherwise things wouldn’t have been able to get so heated.”
Steve laughed. “Shouldn’t I still hit you because of equality? Especially since you’ll be in the suit and can match me with no problems.”
are why your Captain is here…or why he’s staying here without trouble from the Wraith. Apparently there is a powerful tether rooting Steve to this dimension. That’s what the red and gold is…”
“You say that like it’s a bad thing.” She chuckled lightly. “I have been told that I talk too much. By more than a few people. Usually while they’re shooting at me.”
“Hey I should get points for focusing on what mattered before ogling you. Needless to say however I am not disappointed by the view. The last person I had the urge to motorboat this bad was named Cinnamon.”
Bucky smirked. “There is a difference between glancing and checking out, but it’s fine. Stark’s hot—even I can admit that and she’s set my shower to ice cold for a month. There’s nothing wrong with looking.”
Steve smirked. “Little old ladies have always loved me. I like to think they see a kindred spirit in me.”
Steve opened his mouth to reply when Toni trudged into the room, black tank top sporting burns and tiny holes. There was a smudge of grease on her cheek and her hair was a mess but she had a big if slightly tired smile. “Coffee,” she moaned making a beeline for it. “What time is it?”
“This might be really strange for you,” Steve said softly. “It’s the same for me. I—where I come from things—circumstances happened that couldn’t happen here so I—seeing you is throwing me a bit.”
It was near ten thirty when they entered the Tower and the view from the wide windows was utterly amazing. She nudged Steve in the back when he stopped to admire it—again—and told him to entertain himself while she caught up on messages. That unfortunately took longer than she’d expected, with Scott yelling at her but also wanting to know what was so secret it had to be
He nodded and tucked into his breakfast. “I left my timeline in very capable hands. I’d always planned to eventually go back after, well after. Find a version of the shield that was still intact and give it to Sam. If anyone deserved to be the new Captain America it was him.”
“And? Look you know how much I love Nat but saying I think Stark is hot doesn’t somehow diminish how I feel about Natasha. Besides one Nat knows Stark is hot and agrees and two, even if I were the kinda guy to go there it means squat because Stark wouldn’t touch me with a ten foot pole,” Bucky said matter of fact. “So what’s the issue?”
But the thought of Peggy thinking he’d abandoned her cut him to the quick. Yes it was just a dream but what if—
Back when they’d found Cap dead in the ice, she’d wondered how differently things would’ve turned out if he’d lived. Would they have fought side by side against Loki and his Chitauri? Would he be living here in the tower with everyone else? Enjoying their dumb movie nights and game nights where Natasha cheated at Monopoly and Thor lost at Sorry. Would they be friends? Would he have even liked her?
“No but I feel like they’re probably looking for a giant cobra to fight.” She dropped to the ground with a heavy clank and grabbed one of the twitching headless soldiers. “Let’s see. Rudimentary wiring, no on board computer for me to hack—smart—but ultimately pretty lazy if I do say so myself. I’m guessing whoever made these guys chipped them one by one with preprogrammed orders and then let them loose.”
, which made him snort but hug her back. Rhodey looked happy and healthy; his lower body not needing the harness because here there’d been no Vision to accidentally paralyze him. It was very clear his relationship with Toni was the same as Steve had experienced in his own reality, one built due to years of love and respect.
Toni slinked out of her jacket and laid it across the sink, ripping down several paper towels to wipe at her wet arms. “Should have told Happy to bring me a change of clothes. Oh well. So guy me died huh? That’s…a real mind fuck. But I guess it’s no weirder than learning Cap is dead here.”
…and I was only one of those things. Part of me thought how can I have someone like that when I’m—I’m not worth it? Not worth her grace and her goodness.”
Chewing on her bottom lip, she shrugged. “I get that, I used to have a hole in my chest. Being a hero and wanting to help everyone is sort of anathema to taking care of yourself. But if we fall, who’s gonna be around to help those left? Whenever I go out I want to do it as a boss…not because I got gangrene because I didn’t get a cut tended to.”
he was staggering to his feet within seconds, becoming drenched by the chilly rain pouring down from a now night sky.
it wouldn’t hurt if he was prepared for that one percent chance that this might be his new home now.”
“Could be both. Pepper used to complain about the temperature in the Tower but I like it on the chilly side. Ooh! We’ll get you a weighted blanket and you’ll be right as rain.”
So Toni had done what Toni did best; faked it. Laughed and cracked jokes and made fun of Barnes until everyone was full and itching to do something else. Bruce had practically jumped for joy when Steve agreed to let him run a few low level tests, and really it’d been the perfect moment for Toni to beg off citing science stuff so that she could disappear into her workshop to gather her bearings.
Toni actually blushed, the apples of her cheeks going faintly pink. “No actually this was, heh well this was Loki’s doing. With that nuke I just—I looked out into the gaping blackness of space and for a while afterwards it was all I saw when I closed my eyes. So I didn’t. Didn’t sleep.” She shrugged and scratched at her chin. “Then an asshole blew up my mansion, nearly killed me and Pepper and shit got rough for a while. Stress, they said caused it. I’ve dyed it but it comes back so…whatever. Hell I mean I guess it’s better than a heart attack so go me.”
that? How much could she really be damaged in the process?  Besides it’s not like she was a stranger to pain, enduring or overcoming. Sure it would probably suck but in the end it would be okay because Steve would be back where he belonged. Back with someone he loved.
Toni hummed and wrapped an arm around his shoulders, tugging until he shifted and leaned into her, resting his head against hers. His hair was soft against her cheek, smelling slightly of the apples of her favorite shampoo. “I hate it too. It’s the worst.”
But he couldn’t just leave his suit in an alley. If it fell into the wrong hands the material could be repurposed for anything. “No I—it’s there. Please just—just grab it.”
Toni smirked. “Sam Wilson I presume? Mm. Well I guess if anyone’s earned retirement it’s the hundred year old guy. You could train people though. Not everyone has such a promising tactical mind.” She yawned and rubbed at her eyes. “Anyway so while you were getting your beauty sleep I managed to get in touch with some of the team and they’ll be rolling by later. I didn’t tell them why I needed them. You’re more of a…see with your own eyes type deal.”
She stifled a yawn. “I think we assume life would be easier if we could all be happy all the time. And maybe it would be but would we be satisfied? Unfortunately, we need the chaos from time to time. Small chaos would be cool but we don’t make the rules.”
Swiping a hand across his eyes, Steve laughed again. “I have to say I don’t remember my Tony being so…” He searched for the right word. “I don’t know. I mean he was witty and a lot of what you say sounds like what he’d say, but he didn’t…”
“Hush. I’ll be eighty one in December; I’m allowed to say what I please.” Judith elbowed him in the ribs with as much force as she could muster, making him cough out a laugh. Her gold bracelet hit his shirt and snapped off with a tiny pop, flying off her wrist to slide right under the fridge. “Shit! I thought I’d fixed that damn clasp!”
was needed to function as a unit. And they’d been mostly right although Tony had always wanted them to do more random stuff together. How many times had he invited them on trips or vacations or to sporting events? And how many times had they all begged off with
But the point however was that Washington never felt like home. Being on the run with Sam and Nat—arguably the two people he was closest to at the time—hadn’t felt like home either. It wasn’t until he and the other Avengers were dragging their bruised and bloody bodies off their ship and into the
“You know the more I learn about this world the more I wish things had turned out differently where I’m from. It makes me wish I could go back in time and fix things. Makes me wish it actually worked that way.”
“Hell no. I don’t trust SHIELD as far as I could throw them ever since Fury split. And as for knocking you out if you’re really dosed with super serum I’d need like fifty horse tranqs which I don’t just keep around for shits and giggles,” she replied in amusement. “C’mon Cap you said you trusted me.”
She fluttered her lashes playfully. “You are welcome. Also I wanted to know what you thought about us fighting together. Please explain in great detail while standing exactly like you are.”
“Aunt Peggy was a boss. Literally and figuratively. She told me I could do anything I wanted to do and if someone said otherwise, to kick them in the bollocks.” Smiling, she drifted over and perched on the side of his bed. “She mentioned Cap from time to time. Said he could be a stubborn
the power in my veins and in my lungs and in my bones. Hyping me up while snuffing me out. Then Carol was there and she just—she just grabbed my wrist and my arm like I’d fallen and she was helping me up. And I told Thanos to go to hell because I was Iron Woman and he did not know who he was fucking with.
Rhodey arched a brow. “But from what I gathered none of that is your fault. In fact, without the tether he’d apparently be floating around in space or something, right?”
Toni shrugged. “It’s the thought that counts.” Giggling, she gestured at nothing. “Okay so I’ll look into Time Wraiths and time GPS but for now why don’t we put on our grown up clothes and then do something fun?”
Yet his brain chugged along sluggishly and he idly wondered if it had anything to do with ending back up in the future. Or that strange creature.
Toni groaned before pointing a stern finger at Steve who chuckled. “Shut it Stars and Stripes. Okay lay it on me, J.”
there. With our similar personalities we’d crash and burn before even getting off of the ground. Knowing me I would
Steve stared on in dazed horror so she kept talking. “They set every cell I had on fucking fire—I was burning up from the inside out. I could
To say that he was nervous about meeting this Rhodey would be an understatement. He was probably tied for first place when it came to who were the most important people in Tony’s life. Like Pepper, Rhodey was very protective of Tony and even when he’d stuck up for them with Secretary Ross, there had been
She gestured to the man in question. “I’m sure Steve wouldn’t mind taking you. Not like either of you have anything better to do until Doctor Strange contacts you.”
“If they break my gym they are buying me new one.” She winced as Steve kicked Barnes into a treadmill, snapping off one of its arms. Barnes for his part simply laughed and bounded back into the ring. “Least they are having fun.”
She shrugged nonchalantly but he could see the way her pulse slightly quickened. “At first it was pretty painful and no matter what else I had going on, I could
Toni didn’t want to ask but she had to because her brain pretty much demanded it. She sought answers to questions like a man crawling through the desert sought water. “Why are they red and gold?”
“Like I said before Cap, I’ve seen the footage of you working that shield and while looks can be faked, that kinda thing can’t be,” she explained. “Dad uh, he said you chose the shield and then it was like the shield chose you. Unless you want me to do a full blood work up and DNA testing, I’m willing to believe you are Steve Rogers from another reality.”
“For what it’s worth I’m glad Ultron didn’t get a chance to mess things up here. I know how much you mean to Toni and how heartbroken my Tony was to lose you. He never said but it was obvious.”
“Just the ones we made ourselves.” Clearing her throat, she cut her eyes to her watch and changed the subject. “Anyway since I doubt you have any other place to go when you’re released, you’re coming back to the Tower with me. Not like I don’t have the room. Pep said she’d take care of like crap you’d need so it should be there already. We’ll prove you’re who you say you are and then…profit.”
Steve exhaled shakily and balled his hands into fists. Several different emotions rolled in his stomach, making him feel green around the edges. One of his most vivid memories was finally getting through to Bucky. Stopping that helicopter by sheer strength and will alone; hiding him away until they could figure out what to do about the other Soldiers. The airport…fighting people who were supposed to be his friends. And then…
More than once she’d wondered if things would have been different if she’d been a boy. However with Steve’s introduction into her life she’d gotten her answer. It would not have mattered at all. Boy, girl—it was just her very existence that caused the ripples. Oh well.
meant for things to get that out of hand. He’d just wanted to save his best friend and yes he hadn’t agreed with the Accords but what came after wasn’t something he wanted. Knowing that it was his fault the Avengers weren’t together to stop Thanos the first time. Knowing that in some twisted way Tony’s death was his fault because—because…
