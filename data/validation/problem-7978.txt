"Why were you so shocked?" he shot back, changing the direction a bit. "When I told you."
Tony: And no.
handsome," the woman behind them in line agrees, to make the matters even worse. "Especially the tall one."
Tony: The arrangements are perfectly safe. Don't worry.
Tony: You're absurd.
he had in mind. A very final
Tony: Oh, I'm not going to be mean to you now, after everything. If that's what you thought. And we did work together, and hell, Steve, yeah, it felt good.
Steve hated painkillers, hated the warm, foamy feeling that enveloped you like a hot bath and made it look like a good idea to sit on a gurney with a man you're not allowed to fall in love with, and let him hold your hand, and treasure his closeness, and even close your eyes to savor it better. He really, really, really hated painkillers.
Tony kept his face straight. Nodded at him, chin-up, doing his best to seem... well, disinterested. Then he made himself say: "Yes, Cap," to preserve a modicum of civility.
when Steve shivered violently, just once, and for all his assertions of
Steve sighed. "I'm fine." And then, before Tony had the time to start towards his mount again: "How come you're here?"
Tony: Okay, yeah, it probably is.
Tony: What if they trust you to be rational and strong; and then what if, at a key moment, you aren't?
Tony: Don't worry.
, Steve repeated to himself, and he had no idea why it made his cheeks a little hotter, but it did. He very much decided to keep that to himself.
He is vaguely aware of Thanos lumbering to his feet, tossing Steve's friends to the side, but then a blue streak of a woman is grabbing the gauntlet and Star Lord is yelling: "She's all right! Go, Nebula, go!"
"I mean," he says, "that we were on the team together for like two seconds, all in all, years ago. And then I left, and then you left, and then, with Thanos, we were mostly on different sides of the world, or worlds. Bad timing, I don't know. I just..."
And Tony very much didn't want it to go away. Oh, god. He had fallen for former Captain America in under an hour, and he had fallen badly.
Which – if Steve had been in a fight (and Tony could hardly imagine Steve getting taken without a fight), it would be understandable. Still, it would take quite a beating. And then, after something like that, the man threw himself through a wooden door and a brick wall, because that made perfect sense. Right. Involuntarily, Tony shuddered.
Tony: Don't mind me.
He could see Tony's erection twitch in his pants, and the improbable sensuality of the sight made Steve stop for a second. Tony didn't even seem angry any longer, just urgent and needy and burning. Steve loved him so much in that moment that he thought it was absolutely impossible to ever love more than that, and then, instantly he loved him even more. And for a second he couldn't help but wonder: How's this even possible? And, if there was so much passion between them, if Tony wanted him this much, couldn't they do it again? Occasionally? At least when they are angry at each other, he thought wryly. And even though he'd half-promised himself not to hope for anything more, he hoped.
And all the intimacies, even the hand-holding – it could be explained away, easily. Kindness. Warmth. A desire to help someone, to soothe, to offer comfort. It didn't have anything to do with... with attraction, and Tony was being an idiot.
Captain raised both eyebrows at him, and Tony couldn't decide if he looked amused or not. "There's the 20 hours introductory course on astrodynamics and aerodynamics, 10 hours on in-orbit weather, 15 hours on engines and systems, all in the curriculum guide I have here." Those eyebrows never went down as Cap spoke. "It's all yours. You can teach it. I'll give you the specs. You'll have to review the material in your free time."
I tried to cover it all up by rummaging around in a box, but the random things I saw just made it worse. And then I found the mug with Natasha's symbol on it. In my timeline Clint had broken it years ago, but here it was whole; it was the last straw. There was no use trying to hide it, and besides, we'd just made a pact. I just looked at Tony and shrugged, feeling helpless. I tried to smile through the tears.
the majority would arrive now, all at the same time, and form a very polite line in front of the reception desk. Someone is looking at them strangely. Tony thinks he recognizes one of the goons from the airport as the two of them join the line. The experience is absolutely appalling, and doubtlessly the rooms are going to be no better.
Her snort was barely perceptible. "You know I will."
Tony: Also, I was thinking of getting a PhD in medicinal biochemistry for this.
Tony: What do you want me to say now?
They say having a child to save a relationship is a terrible idea. What about when you decide to save your relationship because you can't save the world this time around, and you need to save something, at least? Morgan is a part of the whole story. She tentatively emerged as a clump of cells while Tony was still in space. He'd wanted her, fiercely so, and that was something that never would change. Then Pepper decided she wanted her too, and she decided to keep the pregnancy. At first, after Morgan was born, it all worked in a weird, push-me-pull-you sort of way, but it did work. Still, the strain that a kid put on their relationship was something they never could have anticipated. Perhaps they were too old or just too tired. Not for her, no, never that; but they became too old and too tired for each other soon enough. It took them some time to notice; they thought it would pass. Growing apart is a sneaky process, and once you take notice of it, it's often too late.
"Thick and sturdy," Tony added, because, as they were bringing him in, he'd looked. "As in, cold war thick. Judging by the design of the building, I'd guess we're somewhere in Eastern Europe."
Tony: Well, he said some considerably less nice things too, that I'm not going to repeat.
"Have you been to see Carol and the others today?" he asked just to say something. The injured pilots were still in the med bay. If anything significant changed on that front, he'd be updated.
At witch point Tony shared a knowing look with Steve and inconspicuously rolled his eyes at him, perhaps conveying more than he meant to. Steve's smile became so incredibly sad for a second that it practically wasn't a smile at all.
Tony: Also, thank Natasha for me, some of the info she sent was moderately useful. She thinks the serum got reverse engineered from the blood samples and the bone marrow of the dead super-soldiers in that base in Siberia, do you think that's possible?
– Tony had a burning desire to prove them wrong. All the expectations and assumptions – they offended him; he wanted to scrap them. He wanted to be someone else, for once. Fresh starts, all that bullshit.
, that he was finally ready, now that he had finally passed the tests.
"I said
"Get your legs up," Tony says in clipped tones. "I want to see your ass."
"I.." Steve said, and: "I
Tony: Steve, you need to answer me.
Tony made it his task to stay calm and reassuring.
There had been a tension in the lines of his face – there almost always is, with Tony – but now a part of it started bleeding away, slowly. It was a most beautiful sight.
, again and again, but instead he took a deep breath. He came closer, rubbing his cock against Steve's ass cheek for a moment, gasping. Then he bent forward, pressing his body against Steve's, stomach against back, and bit him on the shoulder, hard, unrestrained, until Steve hissed.
Tony would supply; Tony being Tony, even that would sound perfectly dry.
And I can tell you what happens in book three if you're interested. Scoot over. What have you got there?"
Steve gasped. This seemed to be the last straw. He parted his lips, and suddenly their press against Tony’s was hard, unrelenting, and his tongue shot into Tony’s mouth almost forcefully. Steve struggled to free his hands from between their bodies, clumsy for a second, forgetting he was supposed to let go of Tony first. And then one of his arms was somewhere around Tony’s torso, but that one was almost irrelevant, because the other hand was squeezing Tony’s ass cheek, insistently, almost to the point of pain. Then he pulled him even closer, in a jerky motion, holding Tony’s pelvis in place and pushing his own groin out. He bent his knees a little and rubbed his cock directly over Tony’s while keeping the other’s mouth shut with his own.
Tony: You mean it's been APPROPRIATED.
. Now, I posted it as a separate fic because it's E-rated, and I didn't want that one scene to raise the rating of the whole fic. Also, it's not in texts, just regular prose, so it wouldn't fit the format.
"You just had to be all selfless and noble, did you?" he muttered resentfully.
He raised his eyes towards Tony almost furtively, but Tony was looking at him already, out of the corner of his eye. Their gazes locked for just a fraction of a second; everything seemed to come into sharp focus, as if they could almost read each other's thoughts; and then Tony looked away and Steve looked down; they could both just pretend nothing was changed between them, but they couldn't really fool each other.
"The diner is closed, remember?" Tony said. And then Steve was wriggling out of his jacket and pushing it at Tony.
Tony: Not every piece of shit in this universe is a Hydra agent.
"Yeah, but you put your helmet on now too,
talk to her about anything important.
Tony trails his fingers trough the slit, lingering at the hole, poking, probing lightly, unhurriedly. More, it seems to Steve, in curiosity than with any kind of desire.
She was bench-pressing, as per usual. Steve took up the neighboring bench. The gym was pretty tiny –
, but Steve didn't exactly stop to listen. His insides were so hot the booze felt like a trickle of cool spring water. It quenched the anger somehow, and what resulted from it was a perfect, gleaming silvery blade, cool like glass and much, much harder, where his heart used to be.
to say. The guy was now looking at his dressing quite studiously.
"I don't think I'll be kicking through anything much any time soon." And there it was. The underlying note of weariness Steve'd been hiding and Tony'd been half-aware of since the beginning. Another piece of the puzzle. "But we should review the facts we got, Tony. Stop wasting time."
"Tony?" That was half acquiescence and half a what-do-you-mean.
Tony: Cut the bullshit.
Tony: Talk to me. You can talk to me. Health and such trump all. I'm here.
Tony huffed. "Peter! I can’t believe you’d talk to your super-science father like that!" He clutched at his heart dramatically. The bubbling joy had to go somewhere, after all. He wasn't sure if it was his or Steve's but did it really matter?  "Is this the thanks I get, after feeding you and housing you for the last," he glanced at the kitchen clock, "fifteen hours and sixteen minutes?"
Tony: And for all the snow about us, we look like we're about to drown.
I could tell her about his arthritis and also all of his grandkids that keep him busy these days. I could also tell her he just got his family back and is thinking of starting therapy (it's going to work wonders for him, I know). But – there will be time for that. "He's happy," I tell her. "And he loves you, always." Both Clints do.
He had no idea how many days had passed since.
I kissed him for a long time, then, against the wall, and against the closet door and against the kitchen counter, going from room to room again, exorcising the ghosts of the fight.
Natasha rolled her eyes. "You're not saying it right. It's the
easily. "Then we're good," Steve murmurs and reaches out to touch his face.
He came back later, but it was different, then.
Tony: You'll just have to trust me.
The atmosphere in the elevator is all electricity and live wires, but they are not looking at each other. Neither of them is saying anything. It just... sizzles.
The woman standing behind them in line giggles. She was at the airport. She was on the plane. She is
It was Steve’s turn to look confused. “But I
"Okay," Tony said. And it was frustrating, all of it, because they weren't talking, really; they could as well be grunting at each other. As soon as they started to say anything real, they stopped and backtracked, both of them. It was a years-long habit, Steve supposed. Walking on eggshells. Always afraid they'd spoil more than they gained. But if they went on like that, Tony would fly off, and Steve would stay, and they would probably never sea each other again. The thought was searing. Every morning, getting out of bed, walking around Timely, going to work, dealing with Fisk and his lot – it all became just bearable because somewhere nearby Tony was sleeping in his bed or hammering away in his workshop and that later on Steve was going to run into him, as if by chance. Without that... it was hard to imagine his life without that. Without that, everything seemed gray.
"Is this normal?" Nebula asks, nodding at them coolly.
"Did he have feelings for her?" I asked, because I'd learned quite a lot about people and their reactions in that support group, as I mentioned.
, to be honest. They say you should multiply the glasses you've had with the number of gray hairs on your head.
together," she coos before Steve can finally answer
. Oh, they argue, and they sometimes drive each other up the wall, and Natasha occasionally threatens she'll throw them out, but they are blindly, insanely, guiltily happy with each other, all in all. They live together now at the Compound, with Dog. It's there that Scott finds them.
Near the elevator that connected their floor to the lower deck, the thrum altered again, becoming slightly higher in pitch. Someone had turned the basses down, the treble up. The music of the ship was modulated all wrong.
there was something brewing there, but honestly, he had no idea what to do with that or how.
(That one stings more than it should.)
Tony: Who is she?
"The flight," Steve breathed, "was just fine." And then: "How come I never know what to say to you?"
, you know. Since you are already here and all.” As he spoke, Steve’s eyes had gotten rounder with understanding. “Which, Cap,” Tony said, emphasizing every word, “is what I meant in the
Tony: Fair enough. Want it?
"Yes, let's do that," Steve replied with evident relief.
He registered Bruce tugging at his arm somewhat frantically. "We're, er, we're
Tony moved back, a step, then two. He wore Howard's old bathrobe on top of his clothes (he had found it in his parent's bedroom, as if it had been put away yesterday, in an armoire that still smelled of mothballs). On his feet he had Maria's old slippers. To her eternal consternation, his mom had had huge feet, for a woman. Howard always said they were there to balance her grace and beauty out, and to keep her honest. He said they were counterweights that kept her from floating away towards the heavens. He said he would never get tired of charming her over and over again (although, in the end, he did).
have the control of your life, quite literally, in your hands.
Tony hid his jerk of surprise well, but Steve noticed it, he felt it in his bones: a stab of regret, black and inconsolable. Because Tony seemed to be asking him why, why are you being like this to me, why now? What did I do? Which was a perfectly understandable question, really, because Tony considered him a friend, and he had done nothing wrong, and Steve's feelings were his own private hell. He should try to keep them that way.
, he thought, almost snarling at himself,
Steve clears his throat.
"I didn't really think you wanted to use it against me. The serum suppressant."
. Steve? How long ago was it for you, exactly?" He hadn't asked me that and I hadn't thought to mention it, or maybe I failed to mention it on purpose, trying to avoid just this.
Who would have thought it had already been a year since they won and turned the Old Purple and his posse into three tons of noodles and a matchstick? Time flies when you're having fun, and the cleanup after worldwide warfare and laying foundations for intergalactic relations were the special kind of fun Tony could have done without.
"Your Santa costume, for Morgan. It was in my bag. I think I lost it the water."
Rain is leaking into his eyes, dripping down his beard. Streaming down his hair into his ears. He remembers the umbrella. He remembers you are supposed to hold umbrellas upright. Over your head. Not hanging over your shoulder, as if you were a young woman on a Monet painting, absentmindedly spinning it one way and then the other.
"Tony, please, what I mean is..."
Steve did want to.
"Ooooh, a widow, eh? Is that a gigolo thing or...?"
Tony: What's with you?
Tony: Because before, you wouldn't have.
"Nothing wrong with the cabin," he said. The attempt at a cutting tone was spoiled by another sneeze. The hankie was embroidered silk, he'd found it tucked into the pocket of the bathrobe. That was what mom did. Always put clean handkerchiefs into the pockets of their clothes.
Tony: Whose tongue went deeper into whose mouth? Because, they say it shows who's going to be more dominant in a relationship.
Tony: Oh, never better! This is amazing.
Looking at it rationally, he had, actually. Plentifully so. It was just me – insecure when it came to him, as ever. He was more expressive about it, too, than I could picture my Tony ever being, but I suppose that's what happens when people die on you. He'd lost his Steve, I'd lost my Tony. I expected we both had things we regretted not saying. Doesn't everyone? We couldn't afford to repeat that mistake.
Steve frowned. "So, if I kick it down, it will explode?"
Tony: I do want to be here.
Tony's mind was back to reasonably calm, and as soon as that happened, the questions were already waiting in line, vying for his attention. He wondered where Steve had been caught. He wondered how. Most of all, he wondered
Cap stopped him in the corridor, a day after Tony'd passed preliminary basic flight (the real test would come after they entered a viper cockpit and exercised in real world conditions). The first thing Tony thought was
Steve jumped back – away – as if hit by a spurt of hot steam. "
A breathy laugh. “Bullshit.”
moved on?" Steve asked slowly.
. Yes I
Tony: Will be perfectly serious from now on. In all things.
"Sure."
STARK: [mutters inaudibly to himself]
"And then I asked her to marry me, so that we would have something to tell the press when Peter refused to join up," he said. "It was a
"A study in human behavior, you say," Bruce commented.
"We're going," Tony says. "We're obviously the best choice. The power couple and all that. Now that that's settled, let's talk New York 2012. Natasha, do you think you could..."
He asks, unexpectedly, if I have one more journey in me. I look at him for a long time, then ask him what I did to deserve that and why would he do it for my happiness. "Perhaps not for yours," he says, faux cryptic.
“Nope.”
Steve had answered the phone almost as if he'd expected someone else to call him from Tony's number. And no wonder.
Well, fine, it's not exactly like that, but that's how it seems to Steve. They brief each other, very efficiently. It's all business, business, business. The only remotely personal remark of Tony's is "The beard's new." Steve wishes he can think of something better to say than "Humpf".
Tony: I don't know when this happened.
There was no point in Tony rolling his eyes, since Steve couldn't see it. He laughed out instead, but it sounded brittle, even to his own ears. "So, I'm supposed to use
People were bustling around, but at the moment, they were just white noise to him, the lot of them. An obstacle to finding Steve. It wasn't fair, but hyperfocus could be like that.
"Why not? Did he not want you to?"
"That's not a choice at all," Tony snapped. "Shut up, I'm trying to think."
"He's..." Steve made a show of glancing at the file again, even though he remembered the data quite well, "...39." Too old to learn. Oh, yes. Steve gave the commander a stubborn look.
"You there," she said, and it took Tony a moment to realize she was talking to him.
The medic had eventually appropriated Tony for a checkup, and Steve was strangely grateful for a chance to slip away. He needed to wipe the sweat from his eyes, have a drink of water, collect his thoughts. (Collect his thoughts most of all, really.) His heart was thumping in his chest, more intensely then when he had gone into the fire. He was almost surprised the people around him didn't hear it. He could feel his cheeks heating up. He tried telling himself he was being stupid, but no use. He both wanted to talk to Tony and didn't, to sit by him on the gurney forever and to run away. Torn by the opposing impulses, he was satisfied to move away. And then, imagining the hubbub of the activity somehow camouflaged him, he stopped and took one long, lingering look at Tony, half-naked, the protection suit bunched about his waist, as the medic took his pulse and scanned him for injuries.
a him. I'm no good at that, words come with difficulty. I couldn't even hug him; we never really got there.
, probably more than once, and
Maybe it's because they are on a field of battle – it's their magical place, after all, a place where they understand each other – or maybe it's because he's seen the way Tony looks at him, always focused on Steve, even when he doesn't want to be, just like Steve is focused on Tony whenever Tony is there, his world revolving around Tony. Maybe that's why, or maybe it's just a flash of intuition, but suddenly Steve is certain of something he's suspected all along.
"How'd they take you, anyway?" Tony asked.
a few guards, but Tony made a quick work of them from a distance. The lab personnel themselves seemed far less eager to fight. Steve and Tony tied them up; the best the two of them could do right now was to inform the Sokovian police once they were out, but they couldn't leave before inspecting and possibly destroying some of the files. There was an interesting amount of data there, connected to the winter soldiers left dead in Siberia, where the drug that had been used on Steve clearly originated. In the end, they left a ton of other logs pointing to illegal activities, but they destroyed, deleted and smashed everything that had to do with Steve and the supersoldier project in general. Tony swiped some data and saved it on a memory stick.
to contain it for all of two seconds, and then he guffawed wetly.
He tried plugging himself into a slightly altered BARF tech gadget thing he had come up with. The readings were... inconclusive.
As the ship's new mechanic (apparently, Fury desperately needed a mechanic), Tony had a cabin. It smelled of people and of bodily fluids and alcohol; not unlike any saloon in Timely, that is. Steve didn't mind. To him it sang of freedom – a freedom he didn't even know he wanted until it reared its head and beckoned. A freedom that was tightly entwined with how he could stand here and openly hold Tony's hand and didn't have to fight anyone for the right to do it. The ship cleared its landing spot; Steve could feel his stomach flip as they unglued from the ground.
I did. I told him everything I knew. My Tony sometimes slipped a reference here and there – Morgan always says this, wanna know what Morgan did this one time... And when I showed an interest – because she was his, and I loved hearing him talk about things that made him happy – he talked more. Now I tried to remember every tidbit. This other Tony drank them all up.
going to work as well? Tony couldn't say, but the hope was almost feverish inside him. As he slid what was essentially a glorified load-coil into place, he could feel in all of his body that somewhere out there Steve was probably getting shot right then, right at that very moment. And sure enough, there was a commotion outside. With a flood of relief, though, he heard Steve's voice again, carrying, resplendent in its anger. Obviously still very alive.
Tony was staring at him with very round eyes.
"Hey, Winghead." (That was his old nickname from their academy days. Steve had been sure it would end up as his callsign, but it never did.)
he thought, pissed at himself. A small private cell tower would have solved it, but it was too late now, anyhow.
"How am
, was the first lie I told myself when this insane idea came into my head. Everything hurt. Yeah, we'd won. I knew how one felt once a battle was over; this wasn't my first, after all. This time I'd skipped the giddy happiness and the life-affirmative sex that sometimes comes straight afterwards. Quietly, I slipped right into the hollowness phase; it was like coming home. We'd won. I felt nothing. It was over. Still nothing. And then, when I stopped feeling nothing, I wished I still did. Feeling nothing had been a bliss.
this – Steve feels his cock burning, responding, and he isn't sure which turns him on the most, and he feels his cheeks heat up again; damn cheeks.
Tony: Oh!
Steve paused. Considered. If Fury gave you a compliment, you savored it, because it was probably the only one you were going to get from him. If he said this much, it meant something. Steve didn't ask why Stark was kicked out of the academy – which one of the stories was true – because that was classified and perhaps it was better not to know. It didn't matter now. Clean slates.
My own hunger hadn't even registered with me before I started eating, and then it felt like I hadn't put anything in my mouth since we were here last, in 2012. Tony was no better, and only when we ordered seconds did we really get to talking.
Tony: Hill says that, according to her sources, Strange is the real deal.
"And what... what would I do, if I tagged along?"
“It was a little childish,” he said. “There, at the top of the trail.”
He knew he was babbling.
Tony: Because I didn't like what they did to me. Happy now?
he told himself.
It turned his imagination into wildfire.
"Give me a few minutes," Steve says, swallowing ground in big leaps.
Tony: Although, hurling myself into Europa is probably heteronormative or something, so maybe I'll pick Ganymede after all, just out of spite and to shock everyone.
, Tony thought again and again, wondering why it mattered to him at all,
He considered, then nodded. "With you there I suppose I can finally do it, yeah."
I opened my mouth to ask something; closed it. Thought about what I was going to say. "Is there any scenario in which this doesn't turn out to be a disaster? Apart from me just going back to my own timeline."
There was this undertone of loneliness in Tony, and if anyone could understand that, it was Steve. The difference was, the lonelier Steve got, the more isolated he became. And Tony... reached out. He dropped these hints, or they escaped him of their own volition. Whatever the case, Steve knew what to do with it. The support group had been of immense help there. Even if  talking to strangers, it was just the matter of standing there with some form of interest on your face and occasionally making an inquiring sound. People who wanted to talk, generally did.
Something in Tony turned to frost. It was metallic and it tasted ugly. He wanted to snap someone in half.
"You don't sound like an asshole. You sound shaken," Steve said with an astuteness surprising for his apparent mental state. "You all right?"
I can't exactly let go. I know I should, but I'm scared she'd just disappear on me and I'll realize it was some kind of illusion.
Tony: My thoughts exactly.
"He loved you, you know."
Still, the spell seemed broken for the moment. With a worried expression, Steve pressed so slightly it was almost imperceptible, slid in barely half an inch, then stopped again, casting an anxious glance at Tony’s face. Then again.
Tony: Did yesterday really happen?
It was strange
The door was the only thing that looked new; it was sturdy and very much locked and unbreakable, unless he had the suit; he didn't. It had been blown apart and Tony had been forced to step out of the pieces when the heating controls went to hell.
A light touch on his elbow made him trail off mid-sentence. Strokes of a thumb, gentle, repetitive, at the sensitive spot where his  forearm met his upper arm. Soothing waves spreading in concentric circles, from the spot of contact and outwards; and for a second all he wanted was to close his eyes and be at peace. But instead he glanced down, towards the elbow, towards Steve’s gentle hand, and of course Steve had to misinterpret the look and he removed his hand hurriedly.
"I love you," he says, still drunk from the kiss, and it's like a crack in a dam, and a trickle turns into a flood, and then it's unstoppable. "I love you, and oh god, we're so fucked up, and I have no idea if we can work it all out or not, and I've no idea
Tony: You just wanted me there.
Suddenly, Steve was overtaken by a weird idea that Stark kept coming here just so that, once, if Steve walked in, he'd be there, looking at him like
A quiet chorus of regrets and doubts was whispering in his ear as he walked; why had he made friends with his pilots, why did he have to accept this post, where Natasha was already serving, why could he not have kept his distance, the way he should have? In the end you just watched everyone die, and you went on and on and on.
Tony: Yeah, buddy, I gathered.
, and that made it more palpable. An urgent pressure in Tony’s chest, that had been there for so long he’d gotten used to it, was now off; and he felt naked without it. But being naked with some people was the best, really.
Tony: left me there to freeze my fckng ass half to death
This was getting ridiculous.
But having him here, not a yard away, so keen (keen on what?), so achingly familiar - it turned everything on its head. No, Tony didn't want to talk about what had happened. Talking would just dredge up bad old times. There was enough of the past around them as it was. But he didn't want to think too much about the future either. He pretty much just wanted to have this moment stretch indefinitely, with the two of them, in an undefined juxtaposition, and the firelight and the dust and the ancient memories.
Tony: I know.
He barely made it into the corridor. When he heard the footsteps behind him, it was already too late. Steve was catching up with him.
Tony: A red one, to mix it up a bit.
Then, a certain dampening in the sound. A series of low thuds from above. As if a party on the upper floor of the dorm had gone over into a too wild a territory; drunken redecorating, pushing furniture about, wrestling in spilled potato chips, things like that.
"What can you tell me about Tony Stark?" Steve asked without much preamble, after they sat down on two crates facing each other. He knew Darryl Jacobson only superficially, but, he mused, everyone knew Jacobson only superficially.
weekend. Tony keeps telling himself he would not say a single word that isn't necessary or mission-related. A pity he sucks so badly at keeping promises to himself.
Finally, Steve got to the point of his tale. Before being saved, the other Steve, in that other world, had almost killed his own Iron Man, and was suffering through nightmares as a result.
Steve nods.
This was not how people who didn't care about each other behaved. If only this gentleness, this companionship could be enough for Steve.
After you were so unhappy about it, with your Steve?"
Tony: Look, just be honest with me, okay?
"I got some soup for you too," Tony called to Steve over his shoulder as he went back into the kitchen. The dog seemed to be doing okay, for now. It was time to get some food into Steve as well. He seemed to be recovering wonderfully, now that he had something to focus on, or perhaps it was just that enough time had passed. The serum was truly a marvel, but it needed some fuel for all the hard work it was doing. To see Steve now, it would be almost impossible to tell there was something wrong with him. Still, Tony wasn't about to forget the gray hue of his skin and the lost look in his eyes. His heart clenched into a tiny, throbbing ball in his chest.
They stared at each other in silence. Still, Steve was painfully aware  that, unless he said something very soon, Tony would go. This time it may really be forever, this time he might never see him again. Tony had come all this way to help him win his battle. Now it was Steve's turn.
"Seems you've been ousted in your own country, old man," Tony quipped at Thor and grinned.
"Instructions first," he said in a gentler voice. "Van Dyne says you should try and get the fire sprinklers on the walls back online when you can."
“How romantic.”
Steve feels a beginning of irritation – and a stab of apprehension – and tingling of the trill. "
he wanted this.
The man tried to pull himself up, and somehow, in the way his legs methodically pounded at the water, trying to propel himself out and up, in the way he attempted to heave his upper body onto the ice, Tony momentarily recognized Steve.
good). But now Tony felt them twitch for a moment, as if Steve was going to bunch the fabric of Tony’s shirt, clutch it in his fists. He flattened his hands then, but they didn’t feel so relaxed any longer.
"No, no," Sam said dryly. "That's my favorite intro. When people ask me that, I know it's going to be good. Also," he turned to Bucky, one eyebrow sharply raised, "no. I did not." His voice could be used for cutting glass, but Steve knew him and detected a tiny under-layer of wry amusement.
It's not the cold, it's the anticipation, he figures, although he
His new Captain was eying him across the room with a scowl on his face. He wasn't a regular visitor down here. Apart from Thor, who, if the rumors were true, came down here following his heart, and apart from Valkyrie, who always followed the booze, pilots rarely ventured this way. Higher ranking officer definitely didn't.
Tony rolled his eyes, but obediently turned to Peter. "Just ‘Tony’ is fine, Pete. I've told you that before." Then his grin turned evil. "Or you can call me Papa Tony, if you want."
Tony: And I know you're not going to fucking understand, but right now it's a biggie. So.
"Hope's fine," Steve went on. "Darryl looks fine – I'm going to talk to him now. The techs seem organized. Some people may be hurt – don't know who yet. The rescue is in operation. I'm going to talk to Darryl now. I'll want your report afterwards. Stay on."
Richards gave him a speculative look. "Can you keep a secret? C'mon, I'll show you something if you promise not to try and reverse engineer it."
. You know I can take care of myself. I got to check if the guy's all right, though, he might've gotten hurt. Other than that, it's all peachy. Gotta go. Toodles."
... I can see you're
Tony: This seems a little unprofessional of her, then.
in the shop window, despite the evidence to the contrary.
Tony: Oh.
Tony: And I suspect they imagined Pepper would refuse the help of my lawyers even if I decided to send those bad fuckers in. And then they'd hold her and blackmail me, I'm thinking.
Could
"Do you want this?" Something in Steve's tone was sheer stubbornness, ticking boxes one by one, trying to remove Tony's arguments.
. Tony didn't stumble. He looked away himself, at once, and kept smiling, as blindingly as an explosion. At people. At everyone else.
Tony frowned. "No," he said firmly. "He didn't. Not in that way."
Tony looks up, the motion of his head is sharp. "Too much?" he asks. "Parenthesis? Cap, you with me?"
"What?" Peter said. "I saw you from up on the stairs, the way you were fumbling your way around each other as if you haven't saved each other's life a dozen times that I know of." He paused. "It's him, right?"
It was almost ridiculous, how much they had to say now that time was running out, how words were finally tumbling out.
going to say anything. I thought he was happy with what we had. He seemed at peace and I didn't want to spoil it.
"I'm telling you."
"Right, right," Tony said. He sounded calmer. "I'll do that."
A peculiar excitement was coursing through Steve. He kept staring at the page, but his mind couldn't focus. He realized he'd read through at least three passages without being aware of one single word, so he went back and, painstakingly, started again. Tony was so close and warm and present, next to him on the bed. Steve had to fight not to keep glancing at him.
to have that information, strictly speaking, but he did. Still, seeing him –
He knew it as it happened. He knew it while the words were escaping his mouth, stupid words, he’d always hated words.
Later on, Thor admits that she'd had a long chat with Frigga, alone. He seems to think that's self-explanatory. Is the effect going to wear off, Tony would like to know, and Thor shakes his head, shrugs, shakes his head again. It's in her DNA now, whatever it is, he says.
"It's not right," Steve said, and proceeded to explain about favoritism, about the effect on the other cadets, about the importance of
Tony turned, gave him a half-hearted glare. "They – what, they asked you to trade yourself for me? And you said yes? You thought they'd honor the deal? Seriously?" And unwanted, unwarranted, there was something in his chest that twisted and writhed and was close to tears, but those were not bad tears, necessarily. Because – he barely dared think it – Steve had come for him,
STARK: Thank you.
Tony: What actually happened is, I’m getting seriously fed up with people sticking their nose in my affairs, is what happened.
Tony: Oh, don't be ridiculous.
"No, thank you, I think I'm good," he was saying when Thor emerged from behind a bulkhead some distance away. It seemed he'd gotten impatient.
I couldn't stop smiling at the eggs.
Which was when Steve’s hand found its way into Tony’s hair again, his fingers moving slowly back and forth. His words were filled with an odd, stifled tenderness. “It mattered to
panic. And all Tony had to do to close the distance between them would be to drop his face a little lower...
Tony: I would have appreciated the info about the gov involvement, though. It would have fitted nicely with my collection of dirt I've been collecting on Ross Mór and the minions, which now I feel bad about not telling you about, but there you go, I guess we're even.
Tony closed his eyes, and sucked in a sharp breath, but just when Steve was going to draw his hand away, to apologize, he felt the flexing of the cheek muscle under his fingertip, felt a corner of Tony's mouth go up. He leaned into the touch slightly, and Steve couldn't help but move his finger downwards, stroke along Tony's lower lip.
Steve's voice rang out, and Tony looked up sharply. Still, his job was to do exactly what he was doing. This was where he could actually be useful.
“Well,
"Yeah, he'll do that," Sam answered, grinning blithely, seemingly not surprised at all. He was obviously referring to either Steve's speed or his remark; not to the way the muscles of his back moved under the fabric or the way the hem of his short sleeves practically cut into his biceps.
The air in his cell was stagnant, like a deep, dirty underground lake. Everything stayed the same. What changed, at one point, was the sound. He became aware of it only gradually. He had been asleep, and then he wasn't. Sometimes it was hard to tell the difference. He
"Well, I... figured you probably needed your sleep," Steve went on. "I'm, ah, I'm going to get up now."
"Stand still," Tony tells him, and then he is behind him, prying his asscheeks open with the handle, dragging the pommel through his asscrack, down, all the way to the perineum, with a bit more pressure than before, then back up. It stops at his entrance, circling, pressing, lightly. And then Tony twists it sharply, and Steve draws in a convulsive breath.
, he told himself firmly. He didn't need the praise,  didn't care about it, and especially not for something so trivial as this.
Tony asked himself for the first time.
lifetime away). And he kept wondering what would happen if the life support systems had really given out. There were emergency lockers with protection suits, like the ones they were wearing now, at key points, but people panicked. People got stupid when they panicked. He kept seeing the faces in his imagination. Oh,
His voice stopped me in my tracks. I turned slowly. "I'm sorry, Tony," I said. His lips had an air of wry concern about them, but his eyes looked hurt. I swallowed.
Tony feels like a puppy on display in a pet shop window. Not that he's not used to it, but this is not the time to put on a brilliant smile and start oozing confidence, which is his usual shtick.
"By the way," Tony said. "You don't have to tell me the story. I mean, I'm curious, even though by now I can guess what happened. I even had a speech ready – a very good one, about how you didn't have to be the resident hero 24/7, and how getting into the ice, with your PTSD – don't fight me on this – was immensely stupid. But, you know what, I'll give you a break."
In the din of the dying battlefield – the clanks and shouts and moans of the wounded – Tony didn't hear him approach, or otherwise pretended he didn't.
To hear Tony tell it, it was way rockier here than what happened back in my timeline, at least as far as I knew. Not that my Tony ever really confided in me. But around here, they had a bad break-up right before the debacle with Ultron. After it was done, Tony did try to go back to her, but it pretty much exploded in both their faces. Honestly, it could have happened like that back in my time as well. How would I know?
Steve's curiosity was piqued. He found himself longing to talk to Stark some more. Also the inside of the car was enticingly warm; calling, beckoning. So warm, in fact, that Steve felt his face burn and his head swim once he was inside.

Tony: a sec
Tony: He said 'You're a mechanic, right? So go make something'.
"I basically just wanted to go and take care of my kid," he told me. "How's that bad? How can that be such a wrong thing to do?" And then, without waiting for me to reply (thankfully, because what could I say to that?), he went on: "And I know she's not
– with his own eyes was... unbelievable. Tony felt his chest constrict, he wasn't even sure with what emotion.
Tony's worry, like his attentions earlier, had to be unwanted. He knew that. The two of them had chatted over the comms, yeah, but, in retrospect, it had to be Steve the superior officer helping the green cadet stay calm. Nothing more, nothing less. Tony had no business demanding answers about his condition, but
His suit jacket felt so tight he couldn't breathe (although, rationally, he knew it was a perfect fit). Steve needed to move. Needed to not have the press of people around him. The muscles of his legs danced with suppressed claustrophobia.
"You were at the Academy. For a while."
He didn't actually
The last thing Steve said to Tony, last night, was:
Disappointment was there, alive inside me, despite myself. Of course he didn't. He always loved other people. Why did I think it would be different here? But then – there must be variables too. Why did the Ancient One send me here, after all? Was this perhaps the only timeline where Tony was alive? No, impossible. So, maybe something else differed.
"What? Am I talking to a wall? I
idiot, for not thinking to ask. Why the hell did I bring you here?"
Tony shook his head. Having Steve here filled him with strange longing: he wasn't sure for what exactly.
This was when he spotted a branch, heavy with snow, about to fall on the parked car. Damn nature, it was always doing things like that. He let his reflexes take over and moved like a lightning. Footing on the ice was treacherous, true, but at least he managed to bat the branch aside in time. Surely the car owner wouldn't mind the tiny indentation Steve left in the shell of the back door when he skidded and slammed into it. Better than the hostile tree smashing the roof in. Right?
Stark looked so pitiful that Steve felt a nagging obligation to make sure he was all right. He also banished all thought that the man might be after him. He was Iron Man, sure, but had he decided to come after Steve, he sure wouldn't do it out here, alone, looking like this. And as they exchanged a few bantering sentences, Steve thought: he's nothing like on TV. Sure, he sounds like it, more or less, but if he's willing to pick up an unknown guy out here at night, he must have a bit of a heart underneath.
Tony: Well, that escalated quickly.
, as if to say
Like a rubber band.
"Cute?" that was a Jessica, who'd apparently been listening. "He's a panty dropper."
Tony: Stop typing, she's onto us.
, and not empty all his guns into a friendly's tail instead of turning
Tony: You don't need to inform me every time you go take a dump.
"Yeah... mine too," Tony said softly, toying with his silk handkerchief. Steve fixated on it, because it was an easy target. He hadn't seen a proper handkerchief like that one since he woke up from the ice; he'd thought they were an extinct species in this century.
"Yeah," Steve agreed. "That... would be more practical."
Oh, there it is, he thinks with some resignation. This is why she's teamed up with him, and this is way she's only pretending to be taking part in the snow fight.
Tony laughed, if a tad uncomfortably.
Tony rolled his eyes. "I can't win this one, can I?"
That was the first day.
So much so that he felt his heart-rate start to rise in protest, he felt blood throb in his ears and alarm arise in his chest.
. It seemed to Tony that Steve (the Dream Steve? the Real Steve?) must have drawn it a thousand times. Lines: straight. Angles: sharp. Shading: unmistakably Steve's.
Tony was looking back at him; their eyes locked. Something Steve couldn't quite read seemed to pass between them. "Okay," Tony said softly. "That's ridiculous, but okay. I get it. But what about the dog? What were you doing on the lake in the first place? Because I know you're normally not insane."
Tony wanted to breathe, but at the moment that goal seemed unattainable. Looking at Steve's stoic, calm face was an impossibility. Tony turned away. Limped over to the cell door. Put both hands on it and leaned over. Breathe, breathe, breathe.
weather, a weather no one should be outside in, let alone out
Tony: So, it all turned out okay. You're safe.
He put it down on the rug – goodbye, rug, hello, world of dog hair – in front of the fire.
Darryl frowned for a moment, his shrug barely perceptible. "No, no," he said dutifully. "Thor's all right."
"Nice to know where your concern lies," Steve remarked dryly from a haystack, where he obediently sat while Bruce set his broken arm and looked into his cuts and bruises. (Nothing but the arm apparently needed immediate attention, but he hadn't eaten for a few days and seemed to have developed a semi-nasty cough.)
"SHIELD used to make
wasn't there – everything would fall into place, but that never happens, and it just gets progressively worse."
"It's not just that," he admits, still not turning around. And then, more forcefully: "Dammit, Steve, you
"Er..." he began when the silence stretched for too long. He was aware of two concentric circles of observers, their friends, and then the inevitable gawkers who wanted to stare at Captain America (and at him, of course at him, always). Tony didn't care. He stood there. He swallowed. "So. How was the flight?"
"Are you still shivering?"
Tony: You two are going to have a million screaming brats together.
Not emotionally available? Sounded like something out of a pop-psych article you'd scroll trough on the toilet.
His head was still slightly muddled with whiskey, enough for him not to really feel the nasty hit of his knee against the stone. It took him a moment to get the fucking leg working  properly again.
Natasha gave him a slow, exaggerated blink. "Since we're apparently having a teenage era revival, what is it you wanted to know? If he likes you back?"
pushing him back. Oh
By the clank of the cuffs he knows he's tugging at them, and makes himself stop. It's good that they are sturdy. And at the spot deep inside of him, a more intense burning, a want for a pleasure that is almost there, just a hairbreadth away, and still seems unreachable.
"I stole it for you," Tony says with some pride. "From the amusement park. Don't worry," he adds quickly, before Steve can say something or just give him a reproachful look, "I left a compensation."
Tony: The bastard tried to analyze you so you kicked his ass?

Tony: Okay, you're right. Okay. Yes.
to him since I came to this timeline.
At that Sam gave him a skeptical look. "When you say it like that, I know you aren't. What's up?"
“So, what do you usually do when this happens?” Tony’s voice was measured and just a little bit slurry from the feebleness.

Steve arches an eyebrow at him. "Can't wait to get into the jacuzzi," he murmurs, deadpan.
Again. In Tony's world, right now
Tony: She did it on purpose. That was her big idea. To take the fall, very publicly. She's making a martyr out of herself, and they are making a huge story out of it. Like dying on a stake for the freedom of the press. She's got a flare for drama, that woman. Also, tough as nails.
Tony was sitting by the window. By the light from his gauntlet, purposefully positioned on the window sill, he was rummaging through the desk, sorting through a number of small objects (batteries and pencil sharpeners and rolls of tape and screws of all sizes) grouped into haphazard-looking piles on the desk top. He raised his eyes to Steve without really raising his head; a corner of his mouth perked up. "More tea for me?" It was the mildest of sarcasms.
Tony: Okay, okay.
," Tony said, and he didn't mean to sound so indignant, but there was no helping it now.

Tony: So, when did you send me the drawing?

the way Stark was with people. And yet something wouldn't let him look away. Those brown eyes were more alive than any Steve had seen lately. His energy was magnetic.
Tony: crazy here
Tony: It's still kinda hilarious, though.
Tony: Yeah, I'm not commenting on that.
"Right," Rhodey said suddenly. "Well. Uh. What I was going to..."
"Are there any of Steve's things left?" I amended.
"Yeah?" Tony's voice positively brightened. "Oh, that's good, that's
Also, he's invited. So to say. If you count Facebook invites.
The big man's presence was impossible to ignore. It burned in Tony's conscience like a torch. For some reason, he stood out, with waves of people breaking off him and around him. Tony looked away, but a moment later glanced back. He couldn't help it. Cap caught his gaze, held it.
"That's what I've been trying to figure out for the past two days, actually," he said.
He kisses me about four months in. He does it in the middle of an argument, and it takes me by such surprise that my knees buckle and I almost lose my footing. I literally melt into his arms.
. The vibration was perceptible. The elevator was now moving. "I'm a mechanic." He turned to Steve triumphantly, for the moment forgetting both his state of undress and the sexual tension that was – he couldn't deny it – throbbing between them; so much so that you could eat it with a spoon.
Tony: I made some kind of lentil soup. With turmeric. Not half so bad. Not ideal for breakfast, though.
“You,” Tony said clearly, and way louder then they’d been speaking until now, “are not in
STARK: I will not be taking any questions today, so I ask you for a bit of silence. Thank you.
going to have to explain to Tony) because Tony asked him for a silly favor.
"Tony, god..." Steve panted, grabbing his ass, pulling him close again, grinding against him. The only thing separating them now was the thin fabric of their boxers, and Steve hated that fabric with a passion.
"How?"
But Tony's back hurts from that fall to the floor, no matter how interesting it was with Steve suddenly on top of him and all that. And, while Steve could probably go back and do it all over again, Tony himself is
Tony  wanted to hesitate, but the word was out before he could stop it. "Yeah."
Steve glanced at the medic. "They did that already," he said, very polite and just a little exasperated. "I'm sure you have more pressing cases than me." The medic crossed her arms and Steve sighed and extended his finger as if wondering if he was ever getting it back. The medic stuck it into a small device.
Their lips were smashed together, their teeth clicked uncomfortably, but Tony didn't give a fuck. He just glared straight at Steve from up close, channeling all his frustration and anger and disappointed desire into the kiss, the look, the grinding of his cock against Steve's.
Tony: Also, I'm in a bit of a happy-ish place, I think. I want to send you a shitton of stuff right now. Don't dare, though. Might be tracked. So none of that for now.
"Uh-uh," he replied, resolute to say nothing. It lasted all of four seconds. "I want to ask you a million things. But I get a feeling you don't want me to. So, ah, I guess I'd better not."
Steve shrugged. "What I said," he finished lamely. He also noticed Tony wasn't saying anything to that, wasn't agreeing. But maybe this was perfect for him – one night together, and then he could get away, free. No strings attached, tying him to the ground. Steve didn't have it in him to resent Tony for it. He simply felt more lonely than ever, but perhaps that was just as well. He'd better get used to it.
, a voice in his head asked him, with unnecessary cruelty,
he thought at Rhodey helplessly. You never could manage a conversation longer than three sentences tops.
"So just Clint, then."
Tony: Well.
Tony: adn i came there to HELP you
Steve opened his mouth to say something, but Tony was quicker. "I know that wasn't really you, and I know it's not fair to you."
Tony: Well, no. For his own safety. And also, the Sourbear would have disapproved. He'd have told me to screw you.
Tony: At 4 in the morning?
Steve stuttered for a second, then laughed out.
"I know that, old buddy." Tony sighed. "I

react then. He turned halfway towards Steve, an eyebrow arched. Steve shrugged yet again.. Nodded curtly towards the window. "Drafts," he said with careful composure.
, in that particular timeline, and not one of the numerous others. From my present perspective, I can only guess the Ancient One knew there was a Tony here who'd lost his Steve, and couldn't handle it; and I was a Steve who'd lost his Tony, and wasn't doing any better; so she figured she'd do a bit of matchmaking. All in all, I suppose you could say the universe conspired to save us both.
Tony: Oh, I am.
Tony: I promise.
"Strange meant the futures that..." I began, but:
But for Steve, Time doesn't exist any more. Just that one moment, and he, on his knees by Tony's side, and the meaningless words.
Tony: Time zones ftw.
"For you," I say earnestly. "Yes. I am." And I think: How many times am I meant to fall in love with this one man, over different lifetimes? Because it's somehow here again – that old giddiness and jumbled thoughts and trembly knees. In my seventies. Fallen for him like a schoolgirl.
, to be entirely precise, and it was starting to be too mind-boggling for Tony's tastes. Like two mirrors reflecting each other, all the way to what could be best described as
A WOMAN: Leigh Orry.
Seemingly oblivious to his mood, Steve just shrugged.
Our eyes met, and for a moment we just stared at each other, almost amused despite everything. It was the two of us, the way we always were when we weren't at odds. In that moment, staring into his eyes, I thought my heart would explode. It had thought it wouldn't experience an easy moment like that, with him, ever again; it hadn't been ready.
"Yeah, yeah, you're fine, we heard," Tony muttered as if to himself. The awareness of Steve's bare skin, so close to his fingertips, was burning its way into his synapses. His breaths were getting shorter. All he needed to do was to brush his fingers against Steve's chest; it would be an accident; no one could say it wasn't.  He could...
. Always for you. Not for power, not because we like to fight. We don't. We like to watch TV and eat pizza, just like everyone [laughter]. Except for Bruce Banner, who mostly just drinks green tea and meditates all day long.
Steve'd caught Natasha in the hallway and practically dragged her into his office. Now they were both leaning against the edge of the desk, half turned towards each other.
(He was still angry, of course he was, Steve figured. Only, he didn't seem angry via texts, but maybe it's easier not to sound angry when you just joke and send funnies). (Maybe he wasn't angry any longer. Maybe he just didn't have anything to say to Steve.)
Tony: No.
Steve struggled to think. But as he felt Tony's erection against his own, a new tide of sharp wanting washed over him. That was that, all the inhibitions fell away, for him.
He thought he heard a murmured
Tony: This talking thing, it does wonders, eh?
“Admirable,” Tony said dryly, or tried. But, to be honest, he
Technically, he'd done absolutely nothing. No, not just technically. He was guilty of being... too interesting while standing there. That was all. Steve kept reading into things. It was all him. Was it? Wasn't it?
"Sir." Steve saluted stiffly "Would that be all?"
news." The genuine elation in his voice reached inside Steve's chest and squeezed. Tony was happy for him, just like he'd been happy when Steve first saw light, just like he'd been so angry on Steve's behalf, back in the cell. This could be enough, he told himself, we could have this, there's nothing wrong with this.
, his thoughts betray him.
Where was the awkwardness? Where was the inability to string two words together when talking to each other? Gone in the ice, Tony supposed. Gone when he had to cut Steve's frozen clothes open and when they cuddled, 99% naked, under the blankets. He would have expected that to make things
into custody, that would be fabulous." And then he pointed at the place where the one they called Grizzly had knelt until very recently. Now he was sprawled on the ground, with a trickle of blood down his temple, his hand still clutching the gun. Tony looked back at Steve, whose eyebrow twitched in response.
Tony was about to gripe at Steve to lay back down, but that smile stopped him in his tracks; who could be angry at that smile? No. Tony realized his anger wasn't meant for Steve at all; it was aimed at himself, instead, because he let so many years pass without trying to reach out to Steve, to at least leave a window of communication slightly ajar; because he couldn't seem to talk to Steve at all; because he was unable to even pretend to be a normal person around Steve, for some reason. There was so much baggage there, so much resentment; also furtive, fierce longing that had gone and festered over the years, and Tony had no idea what to do with it now.
made me wonder if, around here, perhaps it hadn't been such a big deal. maybe we were possibly just better at sorting it out. Maybe we even managed to talk about it once or twice.
about anything else but how to get to the next ski lift...”
them inconclusive.
Tony had asked, even as it slowly dawned on him that she'd meant something completely different. And yes, he'd been seeing those dolls around. He remembered now.
Tony: We just need a white one now and we'll have the Italian flag.
Tony: Okay, I'm turning the phone off now.
He missed Rhodey sorely, but there was no way to call him right now. Rhodey was stationed on
Tony: Steve, what are we going to do about the Accords?
"Steve, this is Peter Parker, my genius intern, here for the weekend," Tony told Steve with relish. "He invented an anti-magnetic inverter for his high school science fair. Peter, this is Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, whom you've already met, if you remember. He was... bluer and somewhat more flaggy at the time."
"Most of it is just a matter of sticking things on sticks and painting them with food paints."
"Only..."
"What do you mean you don't know where he went? He was in his chambers in the castle. A castle that sits on an island in the middle of a fucking
"What?"
"How about you, old man?" Tony asked conversationally, turning to Steve, unaware of what was going on in his head. "Going stir-crazy already?"
Steve frowned. "The flight?"
He picked up the phone from the nightstand and dialed Steve’s number before he could second-guess himself. (Okay, so that was another thing he'd brought back to NYC: Steve's burner phone.)
"So. A chemical fire, eh?" He said the first thing that popped into his head. His own voice sounded sharp in his ears, as it cut the plushy silence that had somehow come to hang between them.
, here and there, but I don't think
Tony – quite correctly – interpreted his silence as a yes, and frowned. "Well, that's not so great. Do you need me to rub your hands or something? Wait, I know this sounded like I was making a pass at you, but believe it or not, I wasn't."
. And then it was over, and that was pretty much it.

from the truth) or he was forming a small army.
Tony: k?
"Different timelines," I reply. I run fingers through my hair and try to act normal.
The man couldn't be of help, though, not with that leg. Steve sent him back with a makeshift crutch, to see if he could make the elevator work again. If he could, he was to get to the pilots' deck and inform Natasha or someone of what was going on. If that was impossible, he was to wait for Thor, who would be coming back that way if everyone in the dorm section was all right and safe. Thor's orders were to evacuate them all onto the pilot deck, then come after Steve to lend a hand.
"No," Tony said at once. "Wherever did you get the idea? Because I keep mentioning her? We were married. I can't just..."
"Is this another one of your 'no-strings-attached' things, Tony?"
I swallowed a clump of mixed feelings. "Pepper."
So, why
, see how it actually felt to do the flat scissors maneuver in a proper flyer. The simulator was well and good, but it wasn't the real thing.
Tony's laughter reverberated through Steve's stomach. "Old people problems, then," Tony concluded. The sweet warmth of hope that was spreading through Steve's face was probably, he thought, unwarranted.
"You fucking idiot, my vest is better than..." Tony starts to snap.
Tony gazed at him, just for a moment, and their eyes met. Steve's face was smudged, his white shirt yellowish-red with dust, and he sported an array of scratches and what was going to turn into bruises – later – around his face and forearms. And yet – blessedly unharmed in any major way.
complaining."
"All the profits go to charity," Steve said slowly, resignedly. "I just sign the papers. I don't really look at the designs."
Tony: Yeah, but it feels unfair. If I'm being a dick to you, just tell me to go to hell. You gotta learn to do that. Don't just sit there, taking it,
Tony: All the usual stuff, really.
"It was a dream," Steve protested. "It doesn't mean anything."
The battle fills Steve's mind the way the sand fills every crease of his suit. It's liberating to just be fighting once more, to know which side is right and which is wrong, to have a clear, stark dividing line between the good and the bad. It's also good to put his muscles to use, strain them to the full capacity once more, to be pushed to the limit and
Abruptly, Tony ceased his rapid limping. He went very still. "What exactly do you mean?" His voice had gone sharp. Steve could now make out his features a bit, way better than before. His vision seemed to be improving progressively, almost minute to minute now. With just a little rest and a snack (okay, half the vending machine stock), the serum seemed to be doing its work better and better.

And then Tony's words penetrated, and Steve stopped. Blinked. Well. Did he really have to stay?
"He had a wife and a kid," I said quietly. "You know that."
I'm getting old, just like everyone else (only slower). Otherwise, I would have heard Tony approach. "I'm here to claim the surrogate best friend privileges," he says to Natasha, coming over, not even sparing me a look. He's got his mask back on. It's not his media mask, it's his
Tony died at the very old age of ninety five. We knew it was coming. I thought I'd accepted it. I hadn't. I don't think it's possible to accept something like that. That's all I'm going to say about it. It still hurts like hell, and I can't talk about it. Sorry.
