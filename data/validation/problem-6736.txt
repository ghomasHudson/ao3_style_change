Rhodey sighed, “Yeah, don’t worry. We’re waiting for the ink to dry on the arrest warrant and we’ve got the bastard. He’ll be locked up before Christmas.”
“We aren’t living in fear of him, Nat. We aren’t cowering in the shadows and waiting for an attack. I didn’t know he’d recognise my voice after all these years. I wasn’t expecting him to leak my name to the press but it’s smart. It puts the heat on me, he needs that. He’s playing us at our own game.” Steve said, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Steve went slow, taking over from Tony until he was as far into his heat as he could get from the angle he was at. He waited for Tony to make the next move, giving him time to adjust. Steve moved a hand up to cup his jaw, thumb stroking over his cheek gently.
“I’m going whichever way you’re going, soldier.” Tony replied with a smile. It gave way to a frown as he pulled his hand back from its place at Steve’s side. His fingers were slick with blood, “Did you get shot?!”
Steve hung up the call. The phone in his hand seemed to mock him, vibrating in his palm with an incoming text.
Fury’s locker was a mess, empty spray cans and dirty laundry shoved in the bottom along with his gym bag and some files that hadn’t been looked after at all. Steve wanted to crinkle his nose at the smell but held back. He found a NYPD waterproof rain jacket on the shelf, clumsily folded up and Steve shook it out. It would be a little small, but it would have to do. He found a baseball cap underneath the gym bag and placed that into his pile as well. There were no trousers and Steve wasn’t sure he’d fit in them even if he found any so he’d have to make the orange ones work. This should be enough to get him out the door.
Fury paused and dropped his voice lower, “Your call burned down a shipment yard and killed over twenty people.”
Tony was writhing, back arching up as Steve’s fist worked his cock and his cock sunk back into his hole. There were so many sensations for Tony that he couldn’t decid which to focus on, moving his body like an instrument to Steve’s administrations.
Tony nodded, “I gave him the device and a pretty good incentive to get himself out of this mess. Now, you wait.”
A blunt object striking the back of his head hard enough to make his eyes water and his ears ring. He heard a muffled voice behind him, felt a bag being shoved over his head and then he felt his legs give out under him.
“I’m going to give you so much more than that.” Steve replied, “I’ll give you Hydra’s leader. His name, his background, his plan. I’ll give you his contacts in the government and your own police force and I’ll even go so far as to give you all the evidence you need to put him away.”
Steve raised an eyebrow, “Your life isn’t going to mean much to me when I kill you. Why don’t we have a conversation first?”
Steve’s lips moved down, paying particular attention to Tony’s collarbone, licking the dips of his skin before moving further down his chest. Tony stirred, gave a sharp intake of breath but slept on. He was safe, Steve knew, and content with having Steve close to him. Steve stopped when he reached Tony’s stomach, eyes peering up at him gently before shifting down the bed and pulling the sheet down with him as he went.
“I’m counting on it.” Steve replied, pulling his gun out from the waistband of his jeans and clicking the safety off.
Tony really did love the bones of that kid. He sent back a few emojis before standing, throwing on his clothes from the night before so he could go and make himself a coffee. His mind drifted to Steve, as it always seemed to now. More importantly, last night.
Tony uncurled slightly, fingers of his left hand twitching to reach for Steve’s. He waited patiently, not wanting to rush Tony. He had to be the one to make that move. He had to prove he wanted to fight this otherwise he’d already lost the battle Steve knew was ahead of him.
Steve had all the confirmation he needed, “Thank you for your help, Adam. I think I have enough for my report.” He said, glancing at Fury before retreating from the room with a turn of his heel.
“We might be able to help with that.” Bucky called out; he was dragging Sitwell back into the clearing by his ankles. Natasha followed closely behind them as she twirled a knife around her fingers with a coy smile.
“Does he know you kill people for a living?” Tony asked, taking a sip of the whisky Sam had given him.
“I’ll try.” Steve promised with a smile, not wanting to disappoint her when Nat was only trying to look after him while he looked after everyone else.
Steve had a front row seat to that pleasure like this, Tony Stark in his lap, chasing his own arousal and what a sight that was.
This was good, they were communicating at least and that meant maybe they stood a chance of working out whatever was going on between them.
Fury frowned, “Then we go back to our own sides of the fence and I hope I never have to cross paths with you again.”
He kept his eyes on Tony for as long as he could, hoping he conveyed strength and hope and trust. Tony looked frantic and worried.
When he was younger and Howard was in one of his drunken flashes of anger, his mother would hide him in the small cupboard on the second floor of their house. It was used to store clean sheets and towels and only the maids ever really acknowledged its existence. Howard certainly didn’t. So, when Tony was eight or nine years old and his mother was still alive, she’d rush him into the cupboard. Howard’s voice would be shouting for her in some other part of the house as she pushed Tony inside and told him to lock the door. He wasn’t to come out until Jarvis gave the special three taps on the wood to let Tony know it was safe.
Steve was more than willing to do just that, having Tony here and in his arms again after everything was enough for him to savour this moment. This chance for them to be together. There was still Rumlow and Ross and Hydra at their backs but right here, in his office with the door closed, there was something else as well. Something chemical and instinctive and addictive and as far as Steve was concerned it was radiating off Tony like the sun.
Deep down, Steve knew it didn’t really matter. He could overrule them if he needed to as their leader. He could say really it was none of their business because Tony was with him and not them, but he wanted them to like him. He wanted them to see why Steve liked him. He wanted the approval of his family if they were really going to do this.
Rumlow wasn’t smiling today, he grunted as he whipped off the sheet and Tony could make out the sheets of metal, some tools and other boxes on the trolley.
Bucky scoffed, “Do you hear yourself? You’ve got a turf war and a manhunt coming after you and your biggest concern is whether we’ll like your new boyfriend? Come on, Steve, get your head in the game or we’re all dead.”
Tony was still in bed when Steve came back from his run the following morning, sprawled out amongst the covers with a boyish sort of peace on his face. Steve was sweaty from his run, having pushed himself harder than normal. He needed to. He needed everything in his head to calm down for a moment, he needed to just not think about the mess they were in and the things he might have to do to fix it.
Steve stared at his friend then. Sam, so strong and brave and true. A spitfire of a fighter in the army and a loyal friend. It would hurt Steve to leave him behind.
“Fine, I’ll draw up an immunity deal for your team as an insurance if I don’t keep my end of the deal. You’ll need to fill out their actual names, I assume you know them. You do realise that immunity deals are normally offered as part of protective custody agreements. You might never see them again. They probably won’t even be able to stay together. It’s a mixed bag with these types of arrangements.” Fury stated.
Fury slapped down another photo, this one a close up shot of the mark carved into his body. Clint paled at the familiar ‘A’ embedded into this man with blood.
Steve was panting, hands into fists against the ties. His eyes were screwed shut, hips stuttering against Tony mouth was he sunk back down on Steve’s cock, making sure to swallow around him.
Natasha and Bucky had gone after Sitwell, who at Steve’s instruction had managed to find his feet and start running. It was a fear response that drove him on foot through the dark maze of steel craters when his car was right in front of him. Even if he managed to get in it though he’d never had been able to leave in it, not whilst Steve had a gun in his hand and a bullet in the barrel.
Tony went willingly, pressing his palms against the wood of Steve’s desk until his stomach was pressing against the edge and he was wiggling his ass impatiently. Steve smiled at the sight, running his fingers down from the top of Tony’s spine all the way to the curve of his ass. Tony twitched in eagerness as Steve slipped a finger between Tony’s ass cheeks before pulling away.
Tony took a sip of his coffee, bitter and sweet on his tongue. The voices had quietened down from the floor above now and Tony found himself relieved that they were no longer fighting because of him. He caught sight of the design on the mug in his hands and raised his eyebrow. The words ‘The Boss’ were written in all black capital letters across the china.
“I’ll do this one by myself.” Steve told them, “Both of you go take a walk, have a conversation. I don’t know what’s going on between you and it’s none of my business. You don’t bring it into our job though. You know that.”
“You want to talk? Let’s talk about how you suddenly decided to make your current infatuation part of the team.”
“Her being uncomfortable? That’s rich.” Bucky sneered, “I’m not bringing anyone back here, Steve. Those are the house rules for all of us and I’ve stuck to them but Tasha knows why I broke up with her. She knows what she did. She doesn’t get a say anymore.”
It was a thing of beauty, the soft blue glow encased in a small metal circle the size of Tony's palm. It almost looked serene and ghostly in its appearance, hiding a powerhouse of energy that could probably fry a man. Or when channelled, blow the lock off a metal door.
That made Steve chuckle, leaning back slightly to take in the happiness in Tony’s whiskey brown eyes and the lightness in his features. He didn’t just look happier than Steve had seen him in months but lighter too. His eyes drifted back down to the edge of Tony’s t-shirt, that expanse of skin Steve knew so well peeking out like a beacon.
Tony’s hand sped up a little more, thumb swiping over the tip as he pumped himself. Steve could feel his stomach getting tighter.
“Yes, you can.” Steve swallowed dryly, “Touch yourself for me. The way I would touch you. Spread yourself open, nice and wide. You’re going to cum for me, Tony and then I’m going to fuck you, so I need you prepared for me.”
He parted Steve’s legs a little more, slotting himself in between them so he was lying down, his own erection pressing into the mattress and he brought himself level with Steve’s cock. Steve lifted his head up despite the restraints, watching Tony with lidded eyes that looked like they wanted nothing more than to fuck him.
Thor sighed, “The police have locked down the area, the coroner hadn’t arrived when I left but it is as we feared. Someone is killing policemen and making it look like us. Our symbol was carved into the man’s chest with a knife judging from what I could see of the pattern. The amount of police there spoke volumes, Captain, they are using everything they have with this one.”
The morgue was on the lowest level and that’s where they were headed so Steve was more than a little confused when Fury stopped him with a hand and pulled a cap and sunglasses out of his coat to pass them to Steve.
“He’s losing a lot of blood, Steve. He needs the bleeding to stop and probably a blood transfusion.” Bruce told him.
“I’ll get him.” Fury promised, “I don’t want civilians caught in the crossfire so I’m not even going to ask why he got caught up in this. Stay clean. Stay low. I’ll process the paperwork.”
Tony tugged at the hair on the back of his neck, getting Steve to meet his gaze, “Yes, and clearly I’m not the only one who wants it.”
“I don’t dance.” Steve replied although he was smiling now too, he looked over Tony’s shoulder to see into the sea of guests. Everyone was dancing now; a band had set up in the corner. Even T’Challa was spinning Hill around the dancefloor to a soft melody.
“Well, too bad because I don’t share.” Tony responded, rolling his hips into Steve to relish in the way his hands tighten on Tony’s hips, “Do you have a plan for this?”
Steve’s eyes flashed to the door leading down to the garage and back to them, “What happened?” He kept his voice even, but it had been a mistake to pair Bucky and Natasha together for this one. Clearly, whatever they had broken up about ran deeper than Steve thought and now it was starting to affect the whole team and their operation.
He shrugged off his leather jacket and dumped it on the nearest chair, “Fine. I gave him a few days off, told him to lay low.”
“And I dealt with it. I left. I’m okay now. As romantic as your offer is, Romeo, I don’t need you to kill my dad, okay?” Tony replied, eyes boring into Steve’s.
“We need to focus on our own survival right now, and we need your head clear to do that. The best thing you can do for your mechanic is to let him carry on with his danger-free life.”
Steve took that time to study Tony, to watch as Tony Stark worked himself apart on Steve’s cock only for Steve to put him back together. This position was intimate, Steve could feel every line of Tony’s body, he could see every flicker of pleasure in his eyes and hear every gasp when Steve thrust back into him.
Natasha gave him a sad smile, “That’s not why I’m here and you know it. He wants you protected because he cares about you.”
Tony had shuffled closer, on the edge of his seat while they were talking and Steve knew he could close that gap in a second if he wanted to.
With extra care he untangled himself from the octopus of a mob boss next to him. Steve was all arms when he slept, pulling Tony closer in his sleep until they were so firmly pressed together, they were practically one. When Tony managed to get free, Steve gave a little frown in his sleep making his displeasure known but stayed on his back, arm spread out towards Tony’s side of the bed.
“If you attack Hydra then you forfeit immunity.” Fury replied, “I think I have a way to secure it for you as well as the rest of the team.”
Tony was watching him as well, neither one seemingly wanting to tear their eyes away from each other as the tension around them crackled. Tony pulled a small white card from his pocket and held it up to Steve, “My number, in case you need me to look at that bike again.”
Tony did as he suggested, moving his hands back to steady himself with his palms on Steve’s knees so he could lean his body backwards, stretching his thighs out along Steve’s legs. Steve’s cock was still buried inside him and the change in position immediately changed the angle, allowing Steve to slip deeper into Tony’s heat.
“I know you think you can’t have things, that you can’t want things but you’re not just The Captain. I see you, Steve. You didn’t come after me yesterday because it made smart gang sense to get me back, you came after me because you care about me. That’s not a move The Captain would make from what I understand.” Tony replied.
Rhodey looked up from his paperwork at Tony’s arrival, “Hey Tones, you can’t be here. It’s all systems go right now with the turf war.”
“This family, our family, is falling apart. We’re looking at death or jail as the best case scenario and you don’t even seem concerned about how we’re all going to get through this.”
Steve nodded, letting Tony strip him of the rest of his clothes and push him into the shower with nothing more than his nimble hands and a short kiss. The energy was leaving him, as it always did after a fight like that. He was drained but the water felt nice on his skin and Tony’s hands felt even nicer, so he sighed happily and relax into the other man’s touch as Tony scrubbed them both clean.
“That I know who he is. That the King of Brooklyn is coming for him and anyone who dared touch you.” Steve replied, voice firm and strong.
“Steve…” He panted, hips moving of there own accord when Steve pulled his fingers back, automatically seeking the pleasure having them inside him provided.
“I’m not doing this. I have your name; I have your blood but that’s it. We’re not family and I don’t owe you a damn thing.” Tony replied, “Not anymore. I’m not going to help you create a weapon that could be used to kill innocent people, but I hope it will get you to stop resenting me. I’m not seventeen anymore. I don’t need your affection that badly.”
“Rough day?” Tony asked softly, hoping the lightness of the sentence would let Steve know he came in peace.
“But it is you. Shorter hair, lighter. Clean shaven but it’s a good look for you, Captain. It’s all in the eyes though. Damn, they gave you a purple heart for your service in Afghanistan.” Fury stated in disbelief.
Tony stood at his side as they watched the flames grow higher, taking hold of the shipment yard until smoke plumed through the sky and flames licked through the structure. The snow was still falling around them as they watched it burn.
The move threw Steve and he too tumbled down with Tony, a mass of limbs on white sheets. Steve wanted to smile at the move because very few people could knock him on his ass and here Tony hadn’t even been trying but then Tony was kissing him again and they were shuffling further up the bed and Steve had forgotten how to breathe much less form a sentence.
His fingers were cold from the tie but as soon as he was free Steve curled both arms around Tony, holding him close and planting a kiss on his sweaty temple.
“You have no idea,” He replied through gritted teeth, “Rumlow’s coming for everything you have. You think this was just about a few lousy cop killings? This is bigger than you know and when he comes for you, I hope you beg him for mercy.”
Tony was sweaty and smiling at him and Steve couldn’t resist leaning over to give him another kiss. Tony swallowed it happily.
He was beyond hard, feeling his second orgasm building from the tightness of Tony’s walls around him. This position didn’t allow Steve to look at Tony whilst they had sex, something he loved to do. To watch the changes on his face from the pleasure but the angle did let him plunge in deeper and hold Tony closer as he did so, and Steve had to admit there was something oddly nice about it. The intimacy of it all as he thrust into Tony and wrapped him up in his arms.
“Keep to the side streets. Avoid the highway at all costs.” Fury told him, stepping to one side to clear his path, “When all this is over, if you’re still alive, I might even thank you.”
“Because god forbid The Captain wants something for himself.” Tony replied gently, hand slipping back into Steve’s hair.
“If you want it to be?” Tony smirked, standing up and moving around his seat to start heading outside.
He was quick, Steve was quicker. He was in his opponents’ personal space in seconds, twisting the hand holding the gun up so the barrel was pressing under the hydra man's chin. Both his and Steve's fingers were locked on the trigger.
“By looking into the investigation and finding something that points to Hydra.” Steve replied with a smile.
Ross shoved his chair back and stood up, eyes burning into Steve’s face. Steve was daring him, blue eyes wide with defiance. Then the moment broke, and Ross strode out of the room with a stalk that created more noise than when he had first entered.
Fury wasn’t amused, “Another body was found last night. PC Phil Coulson. One of mine. Found in a carpark over on Madison. Bullet to the head, big ‘A’ carved into his chest.”
The silence is deafening, and Steve takes a moment to collect himself, eyes on the shell of a man before him. He stands up to his full height, putting the safety back on the gun in his hands, “I might have let you live if it wasn’t for that last comment,” Steve tells the lifeless body in his garage as he moves to place the gun on the worktop and grab the cleaning supplies from a bucket they kept down there for that very reason, “No one threatens my family.”
“Maybe I like danger?” Tony responded, “Don’t worry, Cap. I can handle myself.” He was biting his bottom lip again, his eyes darker than before.
“We divide and conquer.” Steve replied, “You guys need to stay on Rumlow. I need to know everyone he sees, everywhere he goes. You take shifts. You watch each other’s backs. I need to know where he is building the bombs and who he is planning to sell them too.”
“Soon, Nat. Hydra will torture him to get information.” Steve could feel the bile in his throat like a lump of acid.
He continued downwards, licking a line from the bottom of Steve’s belly button to the edge of his smart black dress pants. His mouth latched on to the soft skin there, near his hip and Tony worked on sucking a mark against it.
"Nat, listen to me. This is your best chance. I can take the fall for this. I can protect you that way. Please, let me. Fury is working on trying to get me immunity and maybe he will but if he doesn't then I'm going to jail either way. Don't ask me to watch as they throw you all in a cell next to me." Steve pleaded with her, eyes burning.
Tony was used to dark spaces and defeating silence. He was used to uncomfortable situations and how to turn his fear into something useful.
Tony nodded, “I’ll go to city hall to see T’Challa. You shouldn’t go anywhere near it. I’ll get the death certificate and see if he can pull the mission report from Afghanistan. It should be enough to slow Ross down, especially if he has a lead on Rumlow by then.”
“You can still get immunity without me. All of you. Fury will process the paperwork and you stay out of whatever happens next. You’ll be together, Nat.” Steve said.
When Steve met Fury, it was after lunchtime and Fury had ushered him around the back of the stationhouse and in through a side door. He was all business in his black suit, badge hanging around his neck as he scanned his ID card for access and led Steve into the lower levels of the police station.
Tony didn’t respond with an answer, his stomach was a ball of nerves as he crossed the street and make his way up the steps to Steve’s front door. He steeled himself before opening it, knowing they would have left it unlocked for his and Bucky’s arrival.
He rounded the last corner and stopped dead in his tracks. The exit was in sight, but Fury stood in front of it, hands crossed over his chest and a scowl on his face.
“I’m telling you; I don’t know anything about this. We’re too busy with the other gangs to worry about the cops.” Clint replied. It was the truth; Steve had never called out a hit on a cop. They normally didn’t have the balls to hit the gang war in Brooklyn and Steve never went after someone who didn’t come after them first. It was just polite business.
Steve threw it to the side, hands immediately back on Tony’s skin. His fingers glided down his chest, defined and lithe but packed with muscle. Goose bumps erupted on Tony’s skin as his hands worked on the buttons of Steve’s shirt. He was faster than Steve had been, eager to get rid of the material as if it offended him. Steve found he didn’t mind one bit as Tony pushed him backwards until he hit the edge of the desk and shoved the material off his shoulders to get Steve free.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest, the way he had seen Steve do so many times, he had nothing on Ross in terms of height or bulk, but he needed to show he wasn’t scared.
“Easy there,” She smiled, hands raised in a mocking surrender, “What are you going to do? Stab me with your keys?”
His cock pushing against his hole but Steve waited, eyes meeting Tony’s for a moment. Tony reached for him. One hand coming up to rest on Steve’s shoulder as he planted his feet flat on the mattress to give Steve an easier angle.
“We’ve all killed someone in this job.” Fury sighed, “I still remember your first kill on the job. You couldn’t sleep right for months.”
Steve groaned, moving to his hands and knees so he could crawl up the bed. He landed on Tony’s chest with a sigh, hands supporting most of his weight as he laid against his lover, “Still alive.” Steve replied, placing a kiss on Tony’s chest.
The silence that greeted him was deafening. Fools or brave men, Steve wasn't sure there was much difference. If they stood in the way of him reaching Tony, then they were all dead men either way.
Tony shuffled from foot to foot, “Just tell me why I’m here, Steve.” There was an edge to his voice, an accusation hiding behind his words. Steve wondered how much he really knew. His mechanic was always as sharp as a pin.
Steve knelt on the bed, feeling it move under his weight as he crawled over Tony’s sleeping form. The mechanic slept on, so used to Steve’s presence that it barely startled him anymore. Steve moved until he was straddling him, powerful thighs bracketing Tony’s hips as he leaned down. His mouth closed over Tony’s neck, that beautiful slope of his skin that Steve loved so much. He placed open mouthed kisses to the warmth, feeling Tony hum happily in his sleep.
Tony’s hands moved into his hair, gripping tightly as Steve repeated the move. He could feel Tony’s hips rocking upwards, trying to get some friction for the heat pooling into his gut. Steve could already see precome beading at the head of Tony’s cock. God, how he wanted to taste him.
“Thank you.” Tony spoke, voice softer than Steve was used to, “Really. Rumlow threatened them and I can’t let them get hurt because of me.”
In the back of his mind, Tony had to remind himself why he needed to create a weapon. It wasn't for commercial destruction or profit. It was for survival. He needed to get out of there, he needed to make sure Peter and Rhodey were safe from Hydra and he needed to make sure Steve knew who he was dealing with. He could destroy it as soon as he was out and safe, no one but him would see this technology.
“He loves you too, you know?” Bucky said softly, eyes drifting to the window again, “I don’t know if he realises it yet, but he does. I can tell.”
One little text couldn’t hurt right? Tony could always ignore it if he didn’t want anything more to do with him and then Steve would have his answer. The decision would be made for him and he could move on with the task at hand.
All eyes turned to Tony as he made his entrance, “Hi.” He said shyly, eyes only for Steve in that moment.
“Steve.” Steve offered, unsure why he did it other than wanting to hear how it sounded coming from Tony’s lips.
Fury was close enough to smash his foot into the back of Steve’s calf forcing him down whilst he cuffed his hands behind his back, “You’re a goddamn son of a bitch, you know that?” Fury whispered harshly in his ear as he secured the cuffs.
. He was sitting here in this room at Ross’ mercy because he’d made it so. He’d told Fury where’d he’d be. He set this up. That was why Steve was going to win. He held his power quietly whilst Ross boasted about his from the rooftops. A smug man never stayed on top long.
Tony wasn’t an expert, but he was pretty sure one-night stands didn’t normally leave a note. He couldn’t help the fond smile that crossed his face, the way Steve had started to write ‘Cap’ before changing his mind and going with his actual name. Tony felt a pang of something heavy and uncomfortable in the pit of his stomach.
Once he started talking, Steve couldn't stop. He poured everything he knew into what felt like hours but must have been minutes. He told them about Fury and how he helped him get Hydra for the cop killings. He told them about Rumlow, and Hydra's take over. He told them about how dire the situation was, about how he couldn't see a way out of this one. He told them about Ross and his eventual manhunt. He explained the bargain he struck with Fury; the immunity deals that currently rested in Bruce's hands as he tried to read through them. Steve told them everything and when he was done he didn't really any better.
“Is this your way of saying you sorta like having me around?” Tony asked gently, a smile curving into his lips.
Tony pushed, the metal digging further into Ross’ skin. He didn’t look away from the panic in Ross’ eyes as the warmth of his blood trailed down the metal and onto Tony’s fingers. Ross shook but Tony gripped his arm tight and pushed even harder, watching as the metal slipped in further. He was panting with the effort, there was so much blood. Ross was gurgling, hands reaching out uselessly for grip on something.
“We need to spin this story very carefully for what happens next.” Fury told them, the warning in his voice clear.
“You like it, don’t you?” Steve asked from the bed, voice rougher than before as he watched Tony toe off his shoes, “You liked everyone knowing that you’re mine just as much as you like knowing I’m yours.”
His gut was nothing but heat and desire, his brain foggy to anything feel but the way Steve made him feel, “Not yet.” Tony told him, pulling back with his hands on Steve’s chest, “Still my show.”
Tony tugged at the tie, Steve’s arm flexed above him in a delicious display of muscle, “Trust me, you’ll enjoy this. If you don’t just tell me, okay?”
Tony was practically vibrating against him, body twitching with pleasure as Steve slammed back against him, watching as Tony’s hips thrust up against nothing in response.
Steve let his head fall back to the pillow when Tony moved out of reach, “You’re a fucking tease.” He groaned.
“I wouldn’t,” Tony sighed, “I know who he is, okay? I knew going into this thing how dangerous Steve is and the rumours about what he’s done. I’m still here.”
Steve tried to give him a reassuring smile, crouching down so not to appear too imposing, “I’m here, sweetheart. You’re okay.”
Steve was stronger though, he raised the saw high, making a show of it for Rumlow. It would be a bloody death, a folk story about the rage of The Captain that no one quite believed. Steve brought the saw down with as much force as his tired limbs could manage, severing his neck in a river of red.
He helped guide Tony’s body, slipping out of him to the tip before thrusting back in again. Tony gasped, hips stuttering as Steve’s cock found his prostate and Steve could feel him shuddering in anticipation of the pleasure.
“He thinks he should have considered that one day Steve might want something outside of being the mob boss he is.” Natasha said, taking a sip of her own mug, “He’s worried Steve won’t have his head in the game if he’s too worried about how this job might affect you.”
Tony had spent his day off helping Bucky adjust to his new arm. He made sure to have him test it out in various positions to determine both durability and comfort. Tony has drawn the designs himself, spending hours trying to perfect it before he could show Bucky the finished version. He used the SI resources to create it soon after and now Bucky was the owner of one mechanical arm, first model of its kind and more advanced than anything else on the market. Bucky was taking rehabilitation hard, refusing help and insisting he was fine. It was Natasha that had gotten through to him with some harsh truths about family and support.
“Then I’d have to do this all by myself.” Tony sighed, “That doesn’t sound very fair, does it Captain?” He drawled out the rank, rolling the word around on his tongue and it sent a shiver of pleasure down Steve’s spine.
The front door opened and slammed shut with enough force to shake the windows in the living room and in seconds Sam and Clint were in the doorway. Sam had Clint’s arm slung around his shoulders, half dragging him through the doorway as his fingers squeezed at Clint’s side. Clint was sweaty and his eyes were unfocused as Sam heaved him over to the couch. Thor immediately got out the way as Bruce hoovered over the head of the arm, assessing the damage with his eyes. Sam’s face with dotted with blood splatter and Clint let out a groan.
Steve stood up with a frown, hands cuffed in front of him though Rhodey hadn’t ordered him to be cuffed to the table as well. Tony was thankful for that; he wasn’t sure he could handle seeing Steve like that.
Steve went back to watching the film, stealing some popcorn from Sam’s bowl and tried not to stare at his phone like a lovesick teenager. He had no idea what was happening with the film, having missed a large chunk of it due to his internal debate but he tried to play catch up and laugh when everyone else did.
“So, what’s the plan here?” Tony asked, testing the give on his restraints, “You keep me here, rough me up a bit and tell The Captain you have me? Because I have to say that isn’t going to be a great plan for you.”
Fury smiled, “For now. I’m sure I can come up with a few signatures on these for my report. You get immunity. They get immunity. I get Hydra off the streets. Everyone wins. I just need you to do your part and stay out of it.”
“Police picked him up for murder.” Steve sighed, “I’m going to fix this. I’m going to get him out, trust me?”
“We had to make a choice, Steve. As soon as Bucky went after him, it was leave him there for Hydra to find or bring him back here where you might be able to get something from him. It was a reckless situation and not our style but maybe something good will come out of this. A name.” Natasha said.
Steve narrowed his eyes, “He isn’t. I trust him, okay? And all I’m asking in return is that you trust me.”
Tony pushed up against him and Steve took that as his sign to move, he started off slowly, shallow thrusts that teased the ebb of his pleasure at a constant level rather than increasing it. It was torture and teasing but it was worth it to hear the hitch in Tony’s breath and the feeling of his walls around him without a barrier.
Steve slipped another finger inside but kept the same pace. Tony moaned, pushing himself lower to the table so Steve could stretch him open wider.
Steve approached him slowly, shoulders back and relaxed as he came to a stop besides Fury. A cop and a mobster meet at the docks, Steve was sure there was a punchline somewhere lurking.
Bucky had given him the schematics and plans for the cells in the early hours, barely saying a word to him as he dropped the plans at Tony’s feet along with another cup of coffee. Tony barely registered it until after Bucky had already gone. The steam rose from the cup invitingly and briefly Tony wondered if this was a peace offering. A thank you, maybe. He drained it in minutes and got back to work.
He was a quiet man but sharp as a tac with a wit to match. Clint would never stop marvelling at how serious and grave their Captain could be one minute and how witty he could be the next. He always felt a pang of sadness at the thought that no one outside their little group would ever see that side of Steve. The side that wasn’t all hard lines and deadly edges but the side that loved them all with a fierceness Clint could barely fathom. The press and the cops always painted Steve out to be dangerous and they weren’t wrong but that wasn’t the whole picture either.
It was dark inside the apartment, dark enough to be unsettling as to why the door would have been left open. Steve couldn’t stop the fear that invaded his senses and pooled into his chest. Something was off.
Fury didn’t answer, searching in Steve’s eyes for something. Steve wasn’t sure what, but the way Fury was looking at him was making him uncomfortable.
Tony had left home at the age of 18, heading straight to MIT and blocking all of Howard’s calls. He was a free man and he definitely wasn’t going back home. Those days were over. He told Howard as much when he called Rhodey for a lift to MIT and vowed he wanted nothing to do with a drunk asshole of a father or his business in building weapons that killed people.
It was only when Tony was finished, his body heavier than before and a blissful grin on his face that Steve focused on his own needs. He took his hand away from Tony’s softening cock, so he didn’t become oversensitive and then with both hands back on Tony’s hips he doubled his efforts, thrusting like a drowning man at sea.
When they made it back to Steve’s place, he led Tony straight to his room. He had been quite on the drive home, his mind focused on Rumlow. Rumlow knew who Steve was. He’d come for him. It would be all over.
Steve didn’t think he’d ever get enough of kissing Tony Stark, his tongue just as skilled as his hands as it dove into Steve’s mouth impatiently, his hands shoving Steve’s own trousers down his legs. Steve fumbled with his boots, he couldn’t kick them off without unknotting the laces and he growled in frustration, tearing his mouth away from Tony’s as he reached down to address the problem.
Fury looked weary, dark circles under his eyes than made him look ten years older. Steve knew how that felt, “Tony hasn’t been officially charged. Ross is talking to him now, probably wants Tony to testify against you. Natasha and Thor are being processed downstairs.”
Tony gave a small huff in his sleep, like he disapproved of Steve’s thinking. Steve knew there would be no going back from this, if his plan worked it would save them all, but it would also destroy his relationship with Tony. He’s relationship with his family. His life.
Steve smiled, “But you love me anyway.” He sassed, “So what do you say? Equals? Partners? I know you’re a hot shot business owner now…”
Tony shuffled then, moving in Steve’s lap so his legs could stretch out into the driver’s seat and he was pressed against Steve’s side with an arm around his shoulders. Steve placed a sweaty kiss to Tony’s shoulder in response.
“This is Rumlow.” Steve told them, “Pierce was at the party last night. I dealt with him, took his phone and when he got a call it was Rumlow on the other end.”
Thor nodded, “Round the clock for both the cop and the boy. I told the men to stay at a distance, the last thing we need is Rhodes arresting his own protection detail.”
Fury chuckled, “Oh, I see that. Twenty-four hours. You get those deals signed. I’ll find a way to make sure there’s one for you too.”
Steve held the phone tighter, trying to rein in his frustration, “No one even needs to know it was you. You have pull with the head of the NYPD, I know you go to weekly garden parties together or whatever. They have Clint in custody for murder. Not one of mine, you know I’m not that sloppy.”
Tony took a shuddering breath and Steve could see his shoulders uncoil, “I don’t want you to prove anything to me. I just want us to get through this. Together.”
Tony used one of the thick fabric welding gloves that he used when soldering the metal together to hold the device. Constructing a complex rigging system to allow the arc reactor to attach to the glove and sit in the palm of Tony's hand when he put it on.
Tony grabbed his arms, pulling them tighter around himself, “I can’t feel my legs. We aren’t moving.”
“Okay. Okay, Tones. Just breathe. Just look at me and breathe.” Rhodey pleaded, crouching down even further.
The sound of a phone from his pocket broke their pace. Steve frowned, pulling out the phone. It wasn’t his though. It was Pierce’s. The number didn’t have a name on the screen which mean it was a gang member. An untraceable burner phone.
“The way you walk, the way you talk. You’re a classic example of American military.” Sitwell conceded with a scowl, “That doesn’t mean I won’t enjoy killing you.”
“You said you were in the army, right? So, you killed people long before you became a mob boss. If I judged you on killing now then I’d have to judge the way the army trains men to kill people as well and I’m not nearly drunk enough for that conversation.” Tony replied with a smile, eyes twinkling under the dim light of the bar.
He had brought the garage with the last of his money, sleeping out of the office because he couldn’t afford a place as he worked on building up his business. In three months, he’d managed to create a website, a customer base and gain some very favourable reviews that helped boost his profile. Now he was the best mechanic in town and he had money to buy a small condo in one of the nicer areas of town. It was still a shoe box and Tony had managed to get it as a steal on the price because the builders had abandoned the project without putting dividing walls up for any of the rooms other than the bathroom so the space was literally one massive room and a private bathroom but it was home and it worked fine for Tony.
“I’ll be in touch when we have the autopsy reports for the victims and we can go from there.” Fury told him.
“Wait!” Sitwell cried, “I know that whatever his plan is, he’s recruiting for it. He has big things in place. He wants to hit you where you live. He wants to watch the downfall of the King of Brooklyn; he wants to kill everyone in your family while you watch.”
“A meeting with who?” She frowned because Steve never had secret meetings but he couldn’t tell her it was with Fury because that wouldn’t go down well and Steve still wasn’t sure he could trust him. He wouldn’t bring the team in unless he was sure.
Steve was sliding his phone out of his pocket before he knew he was doing it, dialling Bucky’s number and holding the phone to his ear. He stood as it rang, wiping Tony’s blood onto the side of his jeans.
Natasha turned to him, “I need you to focus, okay? Steve is smart and he’s strong. We have to believe that and get the job done.”
“He sold you out, Steve.” Rumlow spat his name at him, “Told me about Tony’s little bodyguard. I knew he was one of yours and I knew that was my way in. See, the thing is, I hate people who don’t stick to their word.” Rumlow levelled the gun at Howard’s head, “I think I’ll kill him.”
Steve was off running errands shortly after their impromptu morning in bed and by that he meant he was off to see Fury with the information Tony had collected from T’Challa to try and beat Ross at his own game. He wanted to go with him but Tony knew if he walked into Rhodey’s office with Steve in tow there would be no going back and he definitely didn’t need that kind of attention or a lecture right now.
Tony nodded, “Looks to me like we have more in common than I thought.” He replied, hand gripping the door, “Goodbye, Howard.”
He made it to his floor after his gruelling trudge up the stairs, hands digging into his pockets for his keys when he stopped short. His front door was open, just a few inches.
“He’s a greedy warmonger who’s looking to make a buck with second grade weapons because he knows he’ll never be as smart as his son. He isn’t worth it.” Steve spat out, feeling his heart race.
He hit send before he could change his mind. It was a simple message; Tony could easily ignore it and then Steve would leave him alone. He wouldn’t call or seek him out.
He moved out from behind the wall, noting the bodies that once stood in their way as a piled heap on the floor. Steve frowned, glancing back at Tony again, “Let’s go.”
Howard was working with Hydra. That was why he had come to Tony’s place out of the blue. The contract he was talking about that brought in big money. He wanted Tony to fix the Jericho designs to sell it to Rumlow and Hydra. Howard was prepared to be an active part in the destruction of god knows how many lives for a paycheck and a bit of security.
“I have to do this, Tony.” Steve sighed, trying to look away but Tony held him firmly, “I have to get Rumlow off the streets and out of this city. I have to…”
“What if I slip Steve a way out? I’ll make something he can use to open the cell door. The schematics will show what kind of locking system there is, and I can use that to create a small device to that frequency to open the lock. I leave the station, Steve goes back to his cell, he gets himself out. We’re waiting, ready for the extraction.” Tony finished, amazed at his own self-confidence to build such a device that would secure Steve’s freedom.
Steve sighed, “Someone gave them the order to attack us though, and I’d quite like to find out who that is.”
The room around him erupted into chaos, questions and voices layered over each other. Tony held firm but Steve could see him gripping the sides of the podium a little too tightly in his hands. He had single seconded destroyed his father’s legacy with one sentence and replaced it with something more honourable and people had noticed.
Steve shuffled down further, latching his lips onto the sensitive skin of Tony’s inner thigh as he kissed and sucked an invisible pattern there. Tony stirred beneath him, a small shuffle of his body and a huff from his throat. That was better. Steve rewarded him with a ghost of warm breath over his cock and his other hand lazily trailing up Tony’s other thigh. His fingers were cold from the outside weather and Steve could feel the goose bumps erupt over Tony’s skin from his hands.
He walked forward slowly, giving Tony a chance to back away if he wanted to. He stayed put and Steve took that as a sign that he was listening at least.
“You’re under my protection which means your family is as well.” Steve replied, “That’s how I run my business.”
“Put names to faces. As soon as he figures out who The Captain is, he’ll come for you. He has the arrest warrant on his desk, just needs a name at the top.”
Howard rubbed his chin, “Every three months and a public dinner one a month. The press needs to see us building bridges. It will be good for the SI image.”
He could hear shouting in the distance, harsh voices and biting orders from the tone. He took another few steps, clearing the remains of his cell door and scanned the corridor.
Tony felt awkward standing there, hands in his pockets, “I should get going. Tell Bucky to text me when he’s back with my car and I’ll come pick it up.”
Peter saw him first, eyes growing wide as he took in Steve’s form. He knew who The Captain was, everyone in Brooklyn knew who The Captain was.
This was part of the process he knew, the waiting. It was a psychological technique to break him down. The endless hours of silence with nothing to do but think about how horrible his situation was and how much he wanted to be free. Then Rumlow would come back in with food or a smile and offer him that freedom in exchange for the Jericho, thinking Tony would jump at the chance at that point.
“We don’t need to.” Tony told him, “We just need to be smart. You guys have cops in the station that work for you right? T’Challa has pull in Congress and you know he’ll help. We have the resources; we just need to think outside the box.”
He watched the pleasure mount in Tony’s eyes, stirring in the pit of his stomach and he watched how Tony’s body changed as it grew. His grip on the seat got firmer, Steve could feel the material give way behind him. Tony’s cock jerked when Steve hit a good spot inside of him and his legs shook with little tremors when his pleasure mounted.
“Yeah, I’m calling from Murdock’s phone right now. They can’t ID me, my fingerprints don’t have a match to their system but their trying to pin this body on us, Cap. I haven’t said anything, I swear.” Clint replied over the phone.
Tony moaned at the friction, rolling his hips against Steve’s as his hands roamed over Steve’s chest, kissing every inch of skin closest to him. Steve still had hold of his legs, pushing his hips against Tony so his hips rocked. The friction between them was teasingly not enough and almost too much at the same time. Tony threw himself backwards, sprawling out on the table like an open invitation.
Tony nodded, his fingers moving down over Steve’s hip and he felt the other man give a sharp intake of breath as Tony continued his journey down towards Steve’s hip. His fingers curled towards his inner thigh and Steve parted his legs slightly so Tony could find what he was looking for.
“Look, Steve made his feelings perfectly clear, okay? You don’t need to a babysit me. I’m not going to sell him out because he hurt my feelings.” Tony told her, if he had wanted that then he would have told Rhodey everything but even now, even when he was hurting, he was still protecting Steve.
Rhodey opened his mouth to speak when the door opened again. He spun round to see Fury in the doorway, Tony stayed focused on Ross.
Steve could feel tears burning behind his eyes and he took a small step closer to Tony. Tony took one back. Steve froze in his tracks, “I’m not sure I believe in God, my mom did. God, sins, penance. The whole deal. But if I’m ever stood in front of him, a list of my sins before me, this is the one I’ll seek forgiveness for. Not the people I’ve killed or the things I’ve done. This one, right here. You. Hurting you, that’s the sin I’d want to do penance for. For ever making you feel like you were anything less than what you are.”
Tony sunk to the floor on his ass when his legs gave out, not caring that the pool of Ross’ blood was creeping closer to him. He pulled his knees up to his chest, hand pressed against his mouth as the sobs came.
“You staring at it intensely isn’t going to make it catch fire.” Bucky jested from the seat next to him, hands resting on the wheel.
There was just enough time to see Pierce’s eyes grow wide before Steve brought the blade down on his wrist, it took three hacks as the knife was smaller than he’d normally use for this kind of work but the army had taught him well. He knew where to cut to remove a hand from someone’s body. Pierce screamed so loud Steve had to shove his arm against him mouth to muffle the sounds. This wouldn’t be a good type of evening entertainment for T’Challa’s guests.
“I’m working with Fury to help bring down Hydra.” Steve told him, voice cold and hard. He had to keep his compose now, he had to make Bucky understand what was at stake.
That was when Steve did another thing he normally wouldn’t have done. He knelt down, a move he normally would have avoided because it opened him up to weakness, it was almost like a move intended to worship and Steve Rogers didn’t worship anyone.
“Jesus, Steve, normal people don’t talk about murder before breakfast.” Tony replied, taken back by the firmness of Steve’s tone.
“Exactly. So, if I’m not a monster then there’s no way you can be one either.” Steve explained, “You’re a genius, do the math. Physically impossible, right?”
“I know.” Steve sighed, “I’m prepared to do what’s necessary if it comes to that but we have to try to take him alive first. I told Fury I would.”
“He isn’t going to fall for this. He isn’t going to come for me. It was one time; something tells me he isn’t about to risk everything for some guy he happened to fuck after getting drunk in a bar.” Tony spat out; he needed this guy to believe that there was nothing to use against Steve. That is was a simple drunk mistake and Steve wouldn’t care for a moment if he decided to kill Tony.
Fury nodded, “He needs to shower and change. Third floor, there is a locker room with a shower unit attached. Take the back stairs so no one sees either of you. Rhodey will bring you clothes. I’ll grab some evidence we can put with the body to confirm he’s Hydra.”
Steve started looking into it the next morning. He had showered and fell into a restless sleep for a few hours before giving up and moving back to his office to do some research. He had paid a cop off, he had a few on his payroll for occasions like this and requested a copy of the case file which he had spent hours pouring over.
“He’s Hydra.” Rumlow laughed, “All he wanted in return was you. And a bonus to donate to his unit but that one was easy. I was going to hand you over to him when you turned yourself in to me but well, the cops beat me to it.”
“Where did you find that mechanic anyway?” Steve asked, trying to be subtly but the mention of Tony brought back thoughts of their kiss and Steve’s desire to know more.
Steve was on the left-hand side of the couch, nearest to the door with Thor sitting next to him with a mountain of popcorn in his hand. Sam was on the floor, popcorn bowl on his lap and a pillow behind his back as he watched the movie. Bruce was dozing off on the other side of the couch, head on his hand, glasses askew on the bridge of his nose. Steve found himself smiling softly at the fact Clint had turned down the movie a fraction so the loud explosions on screen didn’t wake him. Clint was in the armchair next to the couch, an old ratty leather thing that managed to support both him and Natasha who was leaning against the arm with a blanket draped over her lap. Steve didn’t understand how she could be comfortable like that, legs curled under her like a gymnast, but he hadn’t seen her move once since they put the film on. Bucky was next to Sam on the floor, trying to be as far away from Nat as possible without making in obvious. Sometimes, Steve really wanted to shake some sense into his friend because surely whatever happened didn’t warrant this. He knew he was pushing it when he had asked them to work together to trail Hydra members, but he had hoped that if they were forced to spend time together it might prompt then to talk to each other about whatever was happening between them.
Steve pulled him closely, not willing to have any space between them now they were this far in, his tongue invaded Tony’s mouth like a drowning man looking for the last sip of water and feeling Tony all but melt against him was payment enough.
“Most cops are.” Fury replied, tucking the papers under his arm, “You really going to give him your confession?”
Steve nodded, “A leader, a plan, anything that points them towards the cop killings.” He rubbed a hand over his beard, he really needed that shower, “Can I trust you and Nat to do this? Or should I pair you up with Clint?”
He thought about his family. He thought about the loss Natasha would feel if she had to separate from them all, especially Clint who had been at her side since they were children. He thought about Bucky, reckless and impulsive. How would he fair without Steve and the team to ground him? Bruce would be alright; Bruce would be able to go back to whatever life he had before Steve had pulled him in. Sam might lose the bar, maybe they’d let him stay in Brooklyn though and ship everyone else out instead? Thor would be difficult; his body count was almost as high as Steve’s if not higher. They wouldn’t want to do him any favours. They’d want to ship him off, minimise his contact with the outside world. They’d want to contain him and call it protection.
“Fuck off.” Bucky narrowed his eyes, “He’s my responsibility, okay? Ever since we were kids and his mom died it’s been my job to look out for him. I was the only one who could. The streets, the army, the gang. Anything that’s a risk to him is a problem for me.”
“Maybe not.” Natasha agreed, “But he likes that you’re here. Willing to help Steve. Bucky responds to loyalty. He always has.”
Tony moaned, “Like that.” He muttered, eyes shut as he rolled his hips again, making himself shudder at the pleasure being strung out of his body.
Tony needed no further encourage, picking up his pace a little. He moved his hands down to Steve’s stomach, using them for balance as he rolled his hips and rutted against him faster. Tony was grinding against Steve’s thigh with everything he had, panting his way through the feeling of his mounting pleasure and the image of Steve watching him, wrists pulling at his ties in an attempt to get closer.
Tony wasn’t done yet though, taking Steve back in again he sucked. Closing his mouth over his cock before sucking like he was a lollypop in the middle of July. Steve’s reaction was instant, his hips bucked despite Tony’s grip on them. His face lifted off the bed to watch Tony swallow him down and his whole body arched at the sensation.
“Oh god no, Tony!” Rhodey threw his hands up, “Tell me you’re joking. Tell me you haven’t been fucking The Captain this whole damn time.”
“Hydra made us, they fired. We fired back. We made a run for cover and Clint got hit. We found the base of operations though. Shipment yard, the old factory containers on the east side. Rumlow looks to be setting up shop.” Sam told them, wincing as Bruce felt around the wound on Clint’s side.
“Bucky is watching his back?” Steve repeated, not quite believing the words. How long had he been in that cell for?
He bobbed his head up and down, mouth working on Steve’s cock until it hit the back of his throat and he had to pull out again. Tony loved seeing Steve this way, feeling him shake underneath him with the loss of control and the pleasure he was getting. He sped up his pace, tongue flat against Steve’s cock as he took him back into his mouth again.
“I can’t let him die because of me.” Steve insisted, “This whole mess is my fault. I should have listened to Bucky. I should have walked away and let Tony go.”
“Undress me.” Tony breathed in the space between them and Steve could see the appeal of losing their clothes under these circumstances.
Steve hated the idea of that, of wanting Tony beyond reason or sense yet whenever he tried to talk some sense into himself, he’d remember the way Tony said his name or his laugh or the sound he made when he came and suddenly Steve didn’t seem to care much for sense anymore.
Steve jerked into his hand, “If you keep that up I’m coming to come before I’m inside you.” He cautioned.
“You might want to vet your staff more thoroughly next time.” Steve winked, “People will do a lot for money.”
“Give me until tomorrow evening, okay?” Fury pleaded, “I’ll come to get the immunity deals and if I still haven’t found anything then I won’t stand in your way.”
“Clint’s been hit!” Sam said frantically, shoving Clint gently onto the couch before backing away. Bruce slid into his place, kneeling down on the floor as his hands went to Clint’s side.
“Sounds like you’d need a navigator, someone in the passenger seat with the map when you eventually got lost and ended up in a backwater town and nothing for miles in any direction.”
Steve leaned forward, throwing Tony off balance enough to have him leaning back and baring his throat to Steve’s attention. His hands were already pushing the tank top up and off Tony’s body because it was just an annoyance at that point. Then Tony’s skin was bare to him again, all that tanned flesh and those dusty nipples begging to be touched.
It was also a key component in the plans for the arc reactor technology that Howard had been trying and failing to produce since Tony was about thirteen. Howard wouldn’t even think twice about why Tony would be asking for that amount of palladium instead of the standard 0.2mg, he’d assume Rumlow wanted an even more powerful missile.
He hated the fact that he was drawn to Steve when he knew he shouldn’t be, and Tony hated the fact he wasn’t sorry for that even more. Rhodey would be so disappointed in him. But Tony knew he wanted it to happen again, he wanted to see Steve again.
Tony nodded weakly although he didn’t make any effort to move from his spot by the wall. Steve went slowly, rising to his feet, still gripping Tony’s hand until Tony was forced to get to his feet as well.
Steve was trying not to show how shocked he was as the Mechanic continued his work on the bike, “It doesn’t bother you that you’re working for me?”
“Just you.” She flashed her eyes up to look at him now, “In all those years. Just you. That means something to him. You mean something to him. He doesn’t do this normally; he’s had nights of course but never anything he contemplated enough to make a go of things with.”
Rhodey was having none of it, “Don’t even try it. The Captain? Are you serious? You know what’s he’s done? He’s a cop killer, Tony.”
He gave him a watery smile, placing a sweet kiss to Tony’s mouth. It was tender, almost too tender and he pulled back quickly, “I love you too.” He said in return, the words blooming in his chest like a fountain.
Clint nodded, “I figured as much. I could use a holiday anyway. We can’t let this one go though, the cops sure won’t.”
Steve wasn’t fairing much better, that coiled spring inside him was like a flutter of smoke. It was impossible to catch and hold onto until he focused in on Tony and then somehow that smoke had become a forest fire inside of his stomach just from the feeling of being inside Tony and having his hands on his body.
“One chance, you let us go and I let you live.” Steve told them; he was bluffing but right now it was all he had.
Tony was running again, his chest heaving and his palm uncomfortably warm as he rounded another corner. He heard heavy footsteps and his hand was up instantly.
He went back to kissing Steve’s neck, teeth grazing his earlobe and Steve almost forgot how to speak, debating just throwing Tony down and taking him right there in the kitchen.
The sea of eyes around him were still confused, all except Natasha. Steve saw her eyes soften for a fraction of a second. She understood.
Tony understood instantly, “And he won’t risk it on a plan that wasn’t 100% fool proof. He never believed this plan was going to work. He just wanted us to think he did.”
Sam nodded, “You’ll have a welcoming committee when you do. I’ll even break out the good stuff I keep in the back.”
Steve chuckled, “I meant it too, about wanting this. I don’t know how to do that though, to want something for myself.”
Steve sighed, “Because he can’t be found here. He needs to be found at the shipment yard, along with something on his person that proves he was Hydra.”
Nothing would have prepared Steve for the feeling of Tony Stark’s hands on his skin, rough fingertips moving over the muscles of his back in exploration as Tony brought his head up to find Steve’s mouth again. This kiss was urgent and hard, a firm press of lips as Tony’s sneaky hands moved to Steve’s chest, working over his abs at a teasing pace before dragging them up over his pecs. As soon as those rough fingers traced over his nipples Steve knew it was too late to talk himself out of this.
Fury sighed, hands in his pockets to protect him from the chill. Steve was running on pure adrenaline and fear and couldn’t feel it anymore, “I might be able to convince Ross to spare your team, Cap, but he won’t agree to sparing you. You’re the Captain, a mob boss, a killer. You created one of the biggest gangs in the city. Ross isn’t going to let an immunity deal stop him from making an example of you.”
"You aren't going to like this," Steve started, hands in his pockets so they couldn't see him shaking, "I need you to listen before you interrupt. It's important you understand the full threat we're facing here before you weigh in."
Steve studied Fury in that moment, he’d always respected how smart the man was, and now it seemed even then he’d underestimated Fury. He had clearly been working this case on his own, unable to let it lie. Perhaps he was more like Steve than he realised.
First, Steve had to get out of there. Then, Tony. They needed to talk, whatever happened or didn’t happen next between them. Steve needed to apologise, he needed to explain. He needed to tell Tony that even though it scared the shit out of him he felt the same way.
“Relax, no one is kidnapping you.” Steve hurriedly pointed out, “I don’t need missiles or whatever. Not really my speed.”
Tony’s legs were shaking around him as he let himself go, thrusting hard and fast into Steve’s pliant mouth. Steve let him take what he needed, crushing his own erection into the mattress beneath him as Tony fucked his face. One of Tony’s hand left the sheet to tangle in Steve’s hair instead, helping guide Steve the way he wanted him.
The words did the trick, anger flashed in Tony’s eyes, “You want to kill me, go right ahead.” He sneered, “Maybe admitting that you feel something for me will be easier for you when I’m six feet under.”
Steve thrashed against him trying to throw him off balance, “I’ll fucking end you, Rumlow. I swear to God.”
That got Tony to smile, it was small but Steve could feel his relief and was glad that it broke through his haze, “It’s weird…” He trailed off slowly, like he was finding the words.
Thor ran his hand over Jane’s name again, “This plan, to prove he’s dead and get someone else to come forward as The Captain. It won’t work. I’ve been up all night thinking about it. I know men like Ross, they don’t believe in reason or coincidence. He’s out of blood and he’ll find it. He isn’t going to let this victory slide on a piece of paper that states Steve Rogers is dead.”
“I’ve been arrested, Cap. The police at holding me for murder. Some body down at the docks. It’s bullshit.” Clint breathed and Steve felt his stomach drop.
Steve didn’t even bother to read the rest of the list. It was Rumlow, it had to be Rumlow. He just needed to prove it so he could take the information to Fury and devise a plan to stop him.
Clint rubbed his palms together, trying to get himself warm, “Well, if this guy is dumb enough to take on the King of Brooklyn then he deserves everything we’re going to give him.
“I can’t kiss you like this.” Steve said after a moment, pulling at his ties again as if they might have a little more give in them.
Steve took a deep breath and then he started filling Fury in on everything he was planning. The only other person in the world who knew Steve’s plan and might be able to help him with it.
Tony was already moving into him, nuzzling his face against Steve’s chest as Steve wrapped an arm around him, “I’ll stay.” He replied, unsure of what came over him because he definitely didn’t stay. At all. It was a rule. Fuck and leave. But Tony was curling into his chest and had come with his name on his lips. Steve’s actual name not just The Captain and Steve wanted to stay. For a bit. He felt Tony’s leg hitch up over his hips as he flung an arm over Steve’s chest and Steve knew he wanted to stay forever. To just live in this moment where he wasn’t a mobster and this wasn’t a one-night stand.
Steve tore into the envelope, sliding out the small card from inside and reading its contents. He was right to dread it that was for sure.
Thor swung his hammer joyfully, “It is true. Nothing like the splatter of blood and the saltiness of sea air.”
Tony shifted as well, shoving a hand under his head as he got settled, eyes locked with Steve’s. They weren’t touching, a small sliver of space kept between them, yet it felt oddly intimate to be like this with Steve. They were both naked and without their metaphorical armour. They’d never done this before. The lazy indulgence in each other, normally they were busy redressing or rushing off somewhere else.
Tony pulled him back down so they’re bodies fit together again, capturing Steve’s mouth in a kiss as he hitched his legs up against Steve’s ribs and opened himself up wider to take Steve in deeper.
“Ah, finally back with us, are you?” His voice was rough and indifferent and Tony found himself frowning, “I thought maybe Jenkins hit you too hard.”
They couldn’t be following him otherwise Rumlow would have figured out who he was by now and he would have made his move.
Steve wanted to run, he wanted to explain all the reasons why he couldn’t have this. Instead he answered, “Yes.”
The phone call with Peter was shorter. Mainly because Peter had clearly been asleep when Tony had phoned, and he sounded so tired that Tony felt guilty for even calling him in the first place. He told the boy to take tomorrow off, they had nothing scheduled to do tomorrow anyway and he told him to cook Aunt May a nice meal, that pasta dish Tony had told him to make. Peter promised he would give it a try and bring Tony some leftovers to the shop the following day. Tony knew he had to let him go back to sleep when Peter’s replies got slower and slower. He bid him a goodbye, trying to keep the emotion from his voice and the relief that Peter was perfectly fine from choking him.
Natasha had whipped a knife out from somewhere faster than Steve could blink and she threw it at Sitwell, the blade slicing into his arm. He cried out, his opposite hand automatically going up to press against the wound. One of his men had a gun in his hand and Natasha gracefully back flipped from the path of the bullet.
Tony pushed back against him, the tip slipping inside his tight heat with ease. Steve wrapped one hand on Tony’s hip, burying himself inside Tony inch by inch until he was fully inside him. Tony panted as he rose off the desk a little, hands supporting himself as Steve leaned down to place kisses against his skin.
Rumlow had all the cards and he knew it. Steve had his family and even that wasn’t enough. He couldn’t save them. He couldn’t save any of them.
"You always told me war wasn't about winning or losing. It was about power. Who has it and who wants it." Sam responded with a shrug, "I'll go into another warzone with you if that's what it takes to make sure Rumlow never gets it."
“Really Captain? Breaking out of jail just to wrack up your body count? You’re just making my job easier for me.” Ross said, walking towards them slowly.
"Steve, don't be stupid. We don't know numbers or weapons or if he's even in there." Nat pointed out, her tone firm.
“This is about survival. You make me weak and it’s going to get me killed. It’s going to get them killed, Bucky was right. I’ve killed people for a lot less than that, Tony.” Steve told him, trying not to let his own tears fall.
“You sent a mob boss to do a cop’s work because you couldn’t get it done yourself. What did you think I was going to do?” Steve asked with a scowl, “He wouldn’t have stopped. We both know it. I’m not saying it was right but I’m not sorry either.”
“We need to find him.” Steve gritted out, trying not to let the anger bleed through his tone. On any other day, the thought of his family accepting his relationship with Tony would have been a moment to celebrate but right now all he could focus on was the fact that Tony wasn’t here.
About how to survive. How to get out because he was right on two fronts. He wouldn’t be building Hydra so much as a toy rocket and Steve definitely wouldn’t be coming to rescue him.
He imagined what he’d say to Rhodey – not that he ever planned on telling his best friend any of this – if he were faced with that possibility. He imagined the event of sitting Rhodey down to try and explain what happened. Would he play it off, suggest that he was drunk and reckless, and Steve was as eager as he was? Or perhaps play the Howard card, Starks were brash and hot headed and honestly, how could he have said no?
Peter seemed to be struggling, unsure how to put the news reports of The Captain together with the polite man in front of him, “Good to meet you, sir.”
Rumlow kicked Howard again, a groan escaping the man’s lips. Steve frowned, “I’ve never met Howard Stark before.”
Tony tracked Steve down to the garage when he didn’t come back to the living room. Natasha had said he would be trying to shut himself off, trying to protect them from seeing their leader and their friend like this. She’d seen it before. Tony hadn’t though and he wasn’t about to let Steve wrestle with this weight alone.
Clint watched him as he pulled out his chair and made himself comfortable, the lines on his face were stern and Clint could tell, even without the eye-patch, that this guy had seen some shit. Hadn’t they all?
Natasha and Bucky were waiting for him across the street in a beat-up old Volvo, not one of Steve’s clearly but it helped them blend in. The atmosphere between them seemed charged, they were sitting there in silence as they waited for Tony and briefly he wondered whether they’d had an argument whilst he was gone.
Natasha stood in the centre of the room, a place that Steve would have normally taken up if he was there. She looked unnatural in the position, her shoulders set and her jumper two sizes too big for her.
Ross gave him a small smirk that made Tony want to run, “Not exactly. I’m here to offer you a choice, Mr Stark. A choice I’m sure your Captain would want you to accept.”
“Okay but take this.” Natasha replied, drawing a knife out of her pocket and shoving it into Tony’s direction.
Tony took a shaky breath, “Because if you don’t then I’ll destroy your legacy myself. I’ll go to the press and tell them why I left home. I’ll tell them about the drinking and the abuse. I’ll show them the scars and explain how I designed more than half the products you made. Who’ll want to buy from you then, Howard? Who would want to trust a liar and a washed-up inventor who might have been brilliant once but has been living off his son’s brilliance for longer than that? A man who beats his own kid because he can’t deal with the fact he has been surpassed?”
“How are you going to do that from a cell, Steve?” Rumlow asked, “You get a choice here, death by fire or death by water.”
“I’ll wait outside, I won’t go in.” He replied, “I just need to know you’re okay and safely out of there.”
Thor was still a bloody mess after their ambush, flaked blood splattered onto his face and mixed into his beard. Steve didn’t envy him, cleaning dried blood out of a beard was never a fun experience and more than once Clint had suggested Steve just shave the damn thing off. He never did though, The Captain had a face that everyone knew and Steve needed to make sure it was as different from his old self as possible. Natasha wasn’t a fan, she said it made him look older. Steve never had the heart to reminder her he was older, they both were.
Steve put his hands on his hips, making himself larger and more imposing. The scowl on his face spoke volumes, “Tony.”
Tony offered Steve his hand and Steve took it gently, savouring the warmth of their fingers together as he got to his feet, “I do love you. I tried not to. I didn’t want to. I know you didn’t do this to hurt me, that you wanted to protect me because that’s what you do. Steve Rogers, you haven’t met a thing you can’t protect by self-sacrifice. But you can’t pull that shit with me again, okay? I want to do this, but I want to be all in. I am all in, your family practically adopted me.”
Bucky cut in, “I saw an opportunity and I took it. We need to find out who’s behind Hydra, we need to get a name.”
Not for good though, because Tony had told him he wanted this. He wanted Steve. Enough to want to continue sleeping with him anyway and for now Steve would take it.
“Jesus, Tony.” He found himself saying despite his own warning, biting his lip to stop himself from saying anything else.
“I made a choice I could live with.” Natasha replied, “It wasn’t something Bucky could live with. I can’t take it back now and even if I could, I don’t think I would. I did the right thing for me, even if he doesn’t see it that way.”
“You know, when I became a cop it was because I wanted to help protect this city.” Fury reclined in his chair, “It wasn’t glory or recognition. It was about making a change. Being a cop allowed me to do that. I think that’s why you do what you do. Same reason as me, different methods.”
Tony wasn't sure how to get ready for a fight, for a battle. He wasn't a soldier; he wasn't a gang member. He was a mechanic; he could make and invent with his eyes shut but using his inventions for an escape plan? That was new territory.
Bucky was silent for another few minutes, fingers tapping on the car door before he spoke again, “I don’t hate you.” He said so softly that Tony almost did a double take.
“Sounds like I missed a hell of a meeting,” Clint said gently, he turned then to look at Steve, “So Hydra’s coming for us now?”
All eyes were on him when he turned back around. Natasha’s were wide and frantic. Clint meant a lot to her, they had come as a package deal and had since they were kids as far as Steve knew, “Hawkeye?” She breathed and Steve watched Bucky take a step towards her like he wanted to comfort her before remembering they weren’t together anymore and stopping himself.
So this was his play, he didn’t want the cops to arrest Steve. He wanted to force Steve’s hand so he had no other choice but to go to Rumlow instead. It would make him easier to kill if he resigned himself to his fate to protect his family. Rumlow was relying on Steve’s instinct for wanting to go out in an honourable way for a mob boss, gunfire and blood, rather than rotting in a jail cell. It was smart. It’s a move Steve would have made himself if the options had been available.
“We drove you out to the desert.” Rumlow whispered, “Threw you from the moving Jeep in the middle of nowhere. I knew by the time you came around the tracks would have disappeared in the shifting sand. I wanted you to die out there. That was me, Steve, I’ve already killed you once.”
Clint opened his mouth to say something, Steve wasn’t sure if it was meant to be teasing or part of a battle strategy. Either way, the sound of three sharp knocks on the front door cut him off in his tracks.
Thor came bursting through the door of the shipment yard, a bloody picture of joy with his hammer, “No Hydra members left alive, Captain.”
He popped the button on his own jacket, shrugging out of it quickly before doing the same with his waistcoat. They both ended up in a heap on the floor, but Tony’s only focus was on the way Steve was watching him from the bed. He was getting turned on by seeing Tony turned on.
They headed out to the car together, Steve saw no signs of Pierce crawling across the car park though. No trails of red to show he was even there. Tony led the way; Steve couldn’t help but watch his every move looking for signs of repulsion or fear. He found none.
He was slamming into Tony now, working him hard and fast as his pleasure mounted. Steve grabbed at Tony’s leg, moving it from his waist to hook it over his upper arm instead, the angle opened Tony up wide and allowed him to reach his prostate on every thrust.
Steve feinted shock, “Who said anything about screwing. I just came to ask you on a date because I’m a gentleman. Stop trying to seduce me.”
He had barely sat down when Natasha launched at him, arms hugging him tightly as he breathed in a mouthful of her hair, “You know, anyone would think you missed me.” He teased, giving her a squeeze in return.
He stopped when he got to Steve’s belly button, feeling the mob boss taunt like a string under his mouth. He gave the skin a teasing nip before soothing it with his tongue and he heard Steve test the restraint again with a triumphant smile that he hid into Steve’s skin.
Tony let out a heavy breath, eyes slipping closed at the feeling of Steve’s finger inside of him. Steve pumped it a few more times before adding a second finger. Tony’s cock jerked and he let out a moan that he managed to cut off with a bite of his lip. Steve continued working him open, fingers scissoring in and out of him as he watched the thin sheen of sweat coat Tony’s skin. He was almost glowing, happy and unburdened and Steve’s. Always Steve’s.
Tony was unable to look away, his whisky brown eyes on fire with lust and Steve felt his cock twitch in his jeans at the sight of Tony biting his bottom lip as Steve’s hands pushed his t-shirt up slowly, fingers grazing warm skin.
“You won’t get the chance again.” Steve promised, releasing Rumlow’s jacket to pummel at his face. Steve hit him furiously, left fist then right fist then left again. Over and over again. He watched as Rumlow’s head snapped left and right, felt a crunch of jawbone under his hand and the slick slide of blood decorating his knuckles and Rumlow’s face.
Tony nodded, sliding the glove off his hand with a grimace, Steve could see the raw pink skin of his palm. That must hurt. They picked a path over the bodies in the doorway and made it out into the cold Brooklyn night air.
Natasha laughed, high and soft and offering him one of the mugs, “No. I’m more Bucky’s type than Steve is.”
“No, but you are fucking his son, aren’t you?” Rumlow cooed, “You want someone to blame for your man losing his arm? Look no further. You see, after Tony went to see his father about making a deal to testify against me, Howard here, well he came straight to me. He double crossed you and his own son for the money and glory I was offering. Isn’t the right, Howard?” Rumlow kicked him again.
He moved down to Tony’s jaw, going through the same treatment of cleaning the blood from his skin when Tony finally spoke, “Am I a monster?” The question broke Steve in two and he found himself gripping Tony’s face in both his hands to get him to look up at him. Steve needed him to hear this and know it was the truth.
“Call you by your last name? You see, it always baffled me how no one knew who The Captain really was. Plenty of people have seen your face. Hell, we run your prints almost monthly and we still can’t get anything. So, I started thinking outside the box.”
“Detective.” Natasha’s voice broke their deadlock, bubbly and nice. An act. She came to a stop by Steve’s side, envelope of immunity deals under her arm, “Sorry, I had to round these up.”
But this wasn’t about Steve, this was about them. Those people that would bleed and fight and die for him. The ones who’d sacrifice everything they had if he asked. He wouldn’t. He’d much rather lay down on the wire himself.
Immediately, the water at their feet started turning pink, running in rivets off Tony’s body as Steve guided him into the warmth of the water. He stopped shivering from the heat and Steve allowed himself a moment of relief, hands working to wash the blood off Tony’s cheek with gentle fingers. They didn’t have a washcloth or shower gel here, guessing that the cops normally brought their own in with them so Steve carefully made sure he caught every bit with his fingers, moving over the skin and revealing Tony’s natural colouring. He focused on his task, other hand cupping Tony’s neck to support him as Steve worked.
Tony nodded as he felt Steve’s hand wrap around his cock, “Definitely not going to jail.” He muttered, eyes fluttering closed as he threw his head back at Steve’s first stroke of his cock.
“Once I get rid of The Captain and The Avengers, Brooklyn will be mine for the taking and I will turn it into the weapons capital of America. Think of the money, Stark, that’s what sold it for your father.”
Tony was whimpering, his cock leaking precome between them as Steve thrust in and out of him with pants and moans of his own. He could see Tony’s skin slick with sweat and feel it on his own back as Tony moved a hand to his shoulder and dug his nails into Steve’s skin.
Natasha’s eyes drifted to the patient as well, “I know. If we live through this, you’ll make a damn fine Avenger.”
They grappled across the ground, each getting in their own hits as they went. Steve blindly looked for his gun, but it was across the other side of the room and he had no hope of getting to it.
Tony was left with a bruising cheek and a sense of dread in the pit of his stomach. He only had one thought, not about the Jericho or even about Steve.
She shook her head, patting the space beside her for him to join her, “We’ve dealt with Hydra before, we’ll do it again.”
Steve’s hand slipped lower, palm on Tony’s ass in a streak of possessiveness that rose up suddenly. Tony didn’t show his shock at the move, but Hammer did, “Tony, you’ve met Justin Hammer I see.”
He kept moving, rubbing against the little bundle of flesh that was making Tony’s pleasure mount, his lips moved back to his neck, sucking against the hammering pulse point in Tony’s throat. He was going to come like this, without Steve even needing to touch his cock.
Steve’s gaze was burning though, those eyes searching the depths of Tony’s soul, or at least that’s what it felt like. He wanted to pull the covers over his head and hide. Instead he reached out across the small space between them, fingers brushing against Steve’s bandage, small spots of blood had come through the fabric but nothing alarming and Tony allowed himself a moment of relief that Steve hadn’t been badly injured trying to get him back.
The little gasps Tony gave grew in volume, at first hushed whispers between them turning to louder moans when he started rutting against Steve faster.
“Come on, let’s get a drink.” Steve called out to Thor as he motioned for the man to follow him up the stairs. Thor nodded, never one to pass up a beer, leaving his hammer propped up by the front door like an umbrella next to a coat rack.
Loki would call him a fool and arrogant, but Loki wasn’t here and the truth was, Thor liked it. He liked the numbness killing brought him, the chance to let his inner demons drop into the background of his mind and focus on this. The sound of his hammer shattering skull and pounding flesh. The way the blood marked the walls and the floor, and the way bodies fell in lifeless heaps on the ground around him.
Instead, he let Steve leave him with a downright sinful kiss on the doorstep that left Tony a little dazed and staring after his mob boss as Steve headed towards his car. Realising how lovesick that made him look Tony scrubbed a hand over his face, slamming the front door for good measure. He needed to get to the garage and put in some hours but first he needed coffee and thanks to Natasha he could already smell it brewing from the kitchen.
Or would they have to go find him when he hadn’t returned? Would Tony walk into a room to see Steve’s body on the ground with a bullet in his skull?
Hammer laughed, “Anything to help developing minds. I’m all about the people.” He glanced at Steve again, “How did you two meet?”
“You lost tonight, and you know it.” Tony told him, voice low and firm, “You lost your leader. You lost your pay packet. You lost your victory.”
He sighed, hitting the button on his computer and stepping away from the screen. It was just a kiss, the guy was dangerous and Tony always was drawn to dangerous. Still, this would be a crazy story to tell people about and he would move on with his life and it would be fine.
That’s what comes from growing up on the poor streets, a sense of looking out for the little guy that you just can’t lose. T’Challa had once stolen money from his father to give to Steve so he could take his mom to hospital. She had still died but he had never forgotten the lengths T’Challa had gone to, then just a boy of sixteen, to make sure Steve’s mom had the best chance of survival.
“If you want, I’ll let you get a shot in.” Steve offered with a deadly smile, “Then you can die happy knowing you at least managed to draw some blood tonight.”
Steve shook his head gently, offering Tony his own bloodstained hand, red from Rumlow’s blood dried to his skin, “I already have blood on me.” Steve replied.
Steve sent back his confirmation to wear the tux he had brought last year for a similar one of T’Challa’s events before shoving the invitation in his back pocket and heading out the door.
Steve kept his pace, running a hand through his hair. Were they trying to force Steve’s hand? Did they want him to charge in so they could say he started the turf war first and they were just reacting? Maybe Tony wasn’t even there… Maybe he was…
Tony’s hips jerked against Steve’s fist, it was sudden and guttural when he came, spurts of his cum soaking into the sheets beneath him as his body clenched and wrung Steve’s orgasm out of him at the same time. Steve buried his face into Tony’s shoulder, beard scratching against his skin as he shuddered, pleasure pulsing through him as he rode out his high.
Tony sighed, he knew this was coming, “Remember that guy I told you about, the one that didn’t work out?”
“This family built him from the ground up as well.” Natasha replied, “He was so lost after Afghanistan, Bucky said it got pretty bad before they got into the gang stuff. He likes the reminders of good things, like he’s trying to hold onto the moments in his life where he feels like he deserves them.”
He turned around another corner, the shipment yards in view up ahead. Steve slowed his pace again, eyes on the sky. It wasn’t raining yet, he wondered when the next time he saw rain would be?
The report itself was even worse and Steve could feel the bottom of his stomach fall out as he listened to the news anchor give her report on him, glancing down at her papers every so often. She was stiff and her speech was clearly rushed in the channel’s haste to break this story whilst the citizens of Brooklyn ate their breakfast.
“You know who I am, Tony. You know what I’m capable of. Is that really someone you want in your bed?” Steve asked him gently.
Hydra would be done before the night was out and Thor gleefully allowed himself a moment of triumph. He couldn’t help Loki when he needed him, he couldn’t protect his brother from the mess he had fallen into thinking he was clever enough to play both sides, but he could do this.
The bullet lodged into the guy’s neck, thick blood oozing out of the wound and onto Steve’s skin as he let the body fall to the floor. He kept his eyes on the body, watching the last twitches of life bleed out onto the cold concrete beneath him before he straightened himself out again and drew his eyes back to Thor.
“Perhaps they got lost?” Sitwell offered with a smile, he looked at the guy on his right for back up, “A little too much to drink and your legs just sort of carry you.”
sell him out. I’m loyal to Steve Rogers. I’m loyal to The Avengers. You want to arrest me; you go right ahead. You won’t get anything out of me that you can use against him, I promise you that.”
Steve had his jeans undone and down around his ankles in record time, his boxers soon joining them. His cock stood proud and erect, already leaking precome. Tony sat up slowly, licking his own palm before taking Steve in his hand. Steve whined in the back of his throat as Tony worked him, slicking him up ready to take him in.
Tony and Natasha went left, around the back of the building to find the back exit. It would make the most sense for Rumlow to store any explosives further away from the front door. It would be easier to move them out in an emergency then and he’d need to keep them cooler than the rest of the building due to the volatile materials. Thor stayed with him as they went in the front, there were surprisingly few Hydra members waiting for them which meant Natasha was probably right, Rumlow was expecting him.
Bucky nodded, “Same. We had to kill a few guys trying to get back into the building though, didn’t want you to get overrun.”
His left hand moved from Tony’s hip, wrapping around Tony’s own neglected cock which was wet with precome and his own cum from his first orgasm.
“Don’t call him that.” Steve warned, “I know you’re worried about Hydra, Buck. I am too but Tony isn’t the problem here and you know it.”
Steve was already waiting when Tony arrived, his leather jacket was zipped up to keep out the cold and the waves crashed into the rocks behind it. It might have been beautiful if the weight of what he was about to do didn’t cling heavily in his chest.
“I don’t think I can do this anymore.” Steve whispered the words into the space between them like an offering, an apology, like a goddamn coward who couldn’t even meet Tony’s eyes as he said it. He needed to do this though. He needed to set Tony free and protect him from any retaliations that might come his way when Steve wasn’t around to protect him himself. This is what Phillips had taught him. No loose ends. No strings. No trails.
“It’s our choice, not yours. Stop thinking you’re the only one who cares in this family. We want to protect you just as much as you want to protect us. We’re in this together. Monsters or heroes, I’m with you, okay?”
Those eyes were piercing into Steve’s soul with the weight of betrayal like a hand crushing his windpipe.
Tony glanced that way as well; Bucky was as firm as ever. “He is.” Bucky replied and Tony couldn’t help but feel shocked at those words leaving Bucky’s mouth.
His mouth was on Tony’s again, licking the whisky off his lips as he opened his mouth to Steve’s touch. He was warm and pliant, his tongue running along Steve’s bottom lip for access. Tony had a hand on his knee for balance, the corner of the bar providing them with a little privacy as Steve explored the roof of Tony’s mouth with his tongue and Tony turned the tables, sucking on Steve’s tongue with such boldness that Steve felt his pants grow tighter at the move.
Steve would come for him, like he promised he would. It was nearing on one in the morning now so Clint had no more than another hour to waste staring at the drab grey walls and the dark two-way glass before a cop came in to tell him he was free to go with an annoyed expression. Clint would smile wide and joyful, because had they really not expected The Captain to protect his own? And he’d stretch his limbs, flip them off and stroll out of the precinct with his head high.
Steve looked down at the lifeless body of Howard Stark, blood pooling from the bullet in his head and coating the soles of Rumlow’s boots. He didn’t seem to notice, stepping over the body without so much as a glance.
Steve urged Tony back down, bending slight over the desk so Steve could curve along his back again, slipping deeper inside Tony to hit his prostate. Tony moaned, although it sounded a little more like a sob, stroking himself a little faster as Steve’s own body tingled with the threat of his orgasm.
Tony pulled back from the kiss, lips moving to suck at the underside of Steve’s jaw, just below the line of his beard and Steve felt himself shudder from the attention. His fingers slipped under the edge of the black tank top Tony was wearing, rough fingertips meeting smooth skin as Steve followed the line of Tony’s jeans round to the small trail of hair at his navel.
Tony’s whole place had the same red brick exposed along the wall, giving the place a homely yet rustic feel that seemed to suit Tony perfectly. Steve wondered why he never had it covered yet but decided that he probably would have left it like this as well. The place was a little rough around the edges but not without its charm. Perhaps that’s why Tony liked it so much.
Steve smiled, “Thanks. I gotta go get Clint. Take care, T’challa. I want a badge from the election campaign.”
Tony lifted his chin higher, “I am. I won’t build you a damn thing. So, if you’re going to kill me, just do it already.”
“Well he shot my bike and made me kill a perfectly nice kid tonight so he needs to answer for that.” Steve responded. Sitwell started pleading again, his voice muffled as Bucky pushed him harder against the car headlight.
Steve nodded, reaching over to pull out the draw and come back with a bottle of half used lube and a foil packet, “Are you sure?” Something about Tony made him want to take every care about this, he wanted to know that Tony wanted him. It was a type of need Steve wasn’t used to feeling, a kind of caring intimacy that scared him.
Steve nodded, “Clean disposal on this one, we don’t need Hydra finding out we’re kidnapping their foot soldiers and killing them.”
“I’ll get subs for lunch, I promise!” Peter smiled sheepishly, the cat nudging his hand for attention again, “He was hungry, Tony.”
Steve deserved that. A million words bubbling in his throat. He was sure he could use them all and still it wouldn’t be enough to tell Tony how sorry he was. Still, if Tony hated him now then he deserved that too and if this was the last conversation Tony allowed him to have then he would fill it with all the words burning inside of him.
“Cum for me, Steve.” Tony crooned, hand back in Steve’s hair as he sucked a bruise over Tony’s pectoral, above his heart, “Let me feel you.”
“You can’t leave, man.” Sam replied, “The only reason we’d made it through all of this is with your help. You’re part of the family, right Cap?”
“This isn’t the ending I wanted, you’re right there but it’s still one I can use to my advantage.” Ross told him, closing the gap between them until he was throwing the words directly in Tony’s face like a parade, “I can pick up The Avengers one by one. The two in the holding cells first, then I go for the bartender? Or perhaps the Doctor?”
Rumlow was barely fighting back anymore, how long had Steve been hitting him? His hands were red and Rumlow’s face was almost unrecognisable. Nothing more than slick red blood and swelling and the marred skin of his scar.
The silence returned and it made Tony’s skin crawl. Too many nights with Howard where there was nothing but silence before the breaking of a glass or the sizzle of burning flesh.
Fury frowned, “Even if we could get evidence on Rumlow to make an arrest, Ross wouldn’t spare The Avengers.”
Steve’s work was incredible, that was Tony’s first thought as he flipped though the pages with an eagerness and awe that had his stomach curling tightly. He was right, that was his second thought as he took in the sketches of Brooklyn’s skyline in the first few pages. It was the same scene from the window, brought to life in pencils and shades of grey. As he flicked further through the pad, the subject matter changed. There were pictures of The Avengers now instead. One of Natasha mid ballet pose with her hands above her head, how Steve managed to capture the joy in her eyes using a pencil Tony would never understand. There was one of Bruce, brow furrowed in a frown as he did the morning crossword puzzle in the paper. One of Thor, all looming muscle yet a joyful face. The one of Bucky looking younger than Tony had ever seen him, happier than Tony had ever seen him and he wondered what had gone so wrong to turn him into the cold man Tony had met in this very house. Briefly, he realised that Natasha was right. Steve tried to keep hold of the good moments, he put them down in these pages so he couldn’t lose them, and he could remind himself that he deserved these moments. This happiness, however fleeting.
Tony raised an eyebrow at him, was that a challenge? Tony nodded and got to work, “First problem. Cameras. They’ll be everywhere. It will take too long to disable them one by one. Someone will realise we’re coming by then. We need a way to take them all offline at the exact same time. Luckily, I helped develop a similar device for the Freedom Line my father put together a few years ago. I can recreate it, a small device I can activate from a remote switch that will fry the cameras and make it seem like a computer glitch.”
His mouth moved of its own accord, dragging his lips down Tony’s throat until he could pull a nipple into his mouth, flicking his tongue out against the bud.
“Shit.” Tony swore, thinking back to his conversation with Steve earlier, how withdrawn he had seemed, how final their kiss at the door felt. “He wouldn’t.”
Tony had the biggest bed Steve had ever since, all white sheets and mountains of pillows on a white canvas, separated from the rest of his flat by two large bookcases that acted as room partitions. Steve wanted to stop and analyse the space, Tony’s space, to see the little quirky items that sat on those bookshelves and see what that was that was stuck to the wall opposite his bed with tape but then Tony was back to tugging at his shirt and jacket and pushing them off his shoulders and Steve’s focus was back on Tony.
He felt more than heard Tony’s sharp intake of breath as Steve’s fingers dipped lower, just into the line of his jeans and he couldn’t help but smile, rewarding Tony with a further slip of his hand into the material.
He felt a surge of pride rise up in him that only Tony seemed to bring out as Tony wrapped up his statement, “I will be staying on at Stark Industries as R&D support. From Monday I will be stepping down as CEO to focus on my own business, but I hand the reins over to Miss Pepper Potts, who will no doubt serve you all incredibly well in this endeavour. She has my full support and backing, and I hope you show her yours as well.”
Steve was fully hard now, pressing against Tony insistently. Tony ground down against him, Steve’s body jerked to attention. He moved a hand up to Tony’s head, bringing his lips down for a deep kiss.
There was a deadlock for a split second, a battle of wits on both sides to see who would cave first. Steve’s eyes burned into them, the anger and rage within him making his blue eyes impossibly dark and deadly. He saw a hand waver on the trigger of the gun in the man’s hand. A slight movement, the man himself had probably barely registered he’d done it.
Steve was shaking, threatening to come with every thrust. He could feel the sticky mess of their stomachs rubbing together, Tony’s cock adding more precome to the mess as Steve’s body moved above him. Tony dug his heels in and Steve picked up the pace. He broke the kiss when he needed to breath, panting as he pressed his forehead against Tony’s to keep connected to him as he moved inside him. Tony seemed to understand, one hand cupping Steve’s smooth cheek to keep him there as their pleasure grow.
“If only you had this much fight in Afghanistan.” Rumlow spat out as Steve smashed his head back down again, “You might not have ended up in the desert.”
The snow crunched under his feet, wet and slippery as it turned to slosh. He hated winter. Tony shoved his hands in his pockets with a scowl and kept moving, the sooner he was at the garage, the better.
He fixed the little device to the lock on his cell, hit the switch and stood back a few feet. He waited with held breath, wondering if Tony had got his instructions right or Steve had misheard him, then the device started smoking a little, there was a creak of metal and the door opened a little. Steve peered round but no one was down in the cells with him, they didn’t dare put anyone with The Captain.
Rumlow sighed, “Think of the security then, working for Hydra as our weapons expert would grant you certain protection. A lot more work than a small-town garage I would wager.”
Another shot rang out, lodging itself in the side of Steve’s motorbike. Steve grimaced as the smoke poured out of it. The last thing he needed was to have to fix that thing on top of his busy schedule this week. He pulled out his own gun, aiming at Sitwell who was trying to crawl back towards his car like the coward he was.
Tony was breathing heavily and looking a little dazed and Steve couldn’t help but smirk at being the cause of that, “I’ll be right up!” Steve called towards the stairs.
Clint sighed, “I’m telling you, that wasn’t us. Think about it, it’s sloppy, when have we ever carved a mark into a victim? When have we ever killed anyone who wasn’t already a bad guy?” He pressed further, “If your boy was squeaky clean then you know it wasn’t The Avengers.”
“The new arm seems to be working for him, lightweight and flexible so he should retain most of the mobility he had before.” Tony said, “But he still isn’t used to wearing it for extended periods of time, he’ll get there. We just need to keep working at it.”
“It doesn’t matter. I’m here to save your ass anyway.” Tony sniffed, “Because the team needs you. We can’t stop Hydra without you. Not now. We need to break you out.”
Steve sighed, shoving the papers back onto his desk. This wasn’t his decision to make. This was something they had to deal with as a family. Steve knew he needed to talk to them, call a family meeting and explain. He would hold off until he had a clear picture though. He needed to figure out how this thing with Hydra would play out and in order to do that he needed to find out who ran the show now.
He pulled the saw out and did it again. And again. And again. Steve worked with a numb passion until there was nothing left to hack. Rumlow’s head lay a few centimetres away from the rest of his body with the force of Steve’s movements, eyes open in fear and lifeless.
“What’s gotten you so happy?” Steve asked, curiosity in his tone. He was happy Tony was happy, not weighed down by the burdens that had plagued him since he killed Ross.
He hired Peter on the spot when the kid had come to ask for a job, working on Saturday’s for a little bit of money and the chance to learn more about the mechanical side of things. He had waffled too much and Tony was sure his hair hadn’t seen a brush in weeks but he liked him, the youthful babble and pop culture references and Tony had told him he could start the next week.
“Because I can’t give you anything,” Steve said, “I’m dangerous, I’m a target. I can’t give you a nice life with dates and a 9 to 5 job.”
Steve nodded, "Okay. I can't make you sign them. But this is a onetime thing, once they're gone then they're gone."
"If Fury comes back with a deal for you as well then you can make a case for us signing them but until then there’s not a chance we are leaving you to rot." Natasha told him.
It seemed like Tony wanted to smile, mouth quirking a little at Steve’s logic, but it didn’t make it onto his face, “He threatened us. He said he was going to lock you away; make you suffer and then get you the death penalty. He said he was going to come for us. Natasha, Thor, Bucky, everyone. He said he’d save me for last so I’d always live in fear of the day he finally came for me.”
Steve punched him and Rhodes hit the deck, out cold. Steve sighed, moving him into a more comfortable position against the lockers. Rhodes would have a hell of a headache and a bruise, but he’d be fine, and he wouldn’t be able to sound the alarm as Steve tried to make his escape. Tony would be pissed though.
The door swung open behind them but neither paid any attention. Tony had the device in his hand, fingers pushing under Steve’s ugly orange t-shirt quickly.
Steve was on his feet in an instant, hand pulling his gun off the table and clicking off the safety. Everyone else followed suit, even Tony was on his feet as Steve went for the front door despite having no weapon.
Tony sat there with the others as they bounced ideas back and forth about how to deal with this problem. They all had complete faith that Steve could fix it but they wanted to help and Tony was eager to brainstorm with them if it meant he could bring Steve some good news and smooth out that worry line crinkled into his forehead. Those ideas ranged from several detailed accounts at how to kill Rumlow (Natasha and Thor) to the practicality of how they were going to get the cops to stumble upon Rumlow’s business venture when they found it (Sam and Bruce) to kidnapping Ross and pretending Hydra was behind it so he had a personal interest in going after them first (Clint and Bucky). Any of those might have worked if they got lucky but it would be down to luck and Tony knew that Steve wouldn’t gamble their lives or their freedom on a lucky shot. Everyone else in the room knew that too.
“You’re trying to tell me my cops had gunpowder under their nails?” Fury asked, “How does that explain Hydra’s behind it?”
Steve let out a hiss when Tony’s rutting made his oversensitive cock a little painful. He gently moved his legs slightly, encouraging Tony to shift so he was rutting against his thigh instead. Tony went willingly, using the thick hard muscle as he bucked his hips against Steve’s skin, biting his lip.
“So, you have a cat now?” The voice had him spinning on his heel to see his best friend standing behind him with an eyebrow raised in Peter’s direction. The cat was cradled to his chest as Peter set about making a bed for him in the office.
The Hydra goon seemed frozen, his eyes stuck on Steve like a deer caught in a lion’s trap, “You know what, you’re new at this. Let me talk you through it. You want to loosen up that grip on your gun, your palm must be sweating like crazy and in a few minutes your arm is going to start feeling so heavy you aren’t sure if you’ll even be able to hold it up let alone fire it.” Steve watched as the guy relaxed his grip a fraction, “That’s good. Okay, now plant your feet apart a little more. Firm your ground, at least look like you’re going to fire it. No one is going to take you seriously standing like that, Jesus.”
Natasha squared her shoulders, “Not anymore. This life, it isn’t always easy. The stakes, the tension, the choices we have to make to protect ourselves. You’ll figure it out one day.”
Tony had slipped past so many of his defences though, what was one more crumbling wall between them now?
“No, but you love the kid.” Steve replied, washing more warm water over Tony’s body, watching it rush down his skin.
His friend was cleaning the blood off his weapon of choice, clearly having no issue about the blood soaking under his feet or the mess of bodies he’d left in his wake of destruction.
Steve moved over to her, having a seat on the plush purple covers as he rubbed his forehead, “This feels different, Nat. I have a gut feeling on this one. These cops being killed? It’s clever, it puts us right in the police and public eye. I don’t know if I can protect everyone from that forever.”
“I’ll let you keep the other one.” Steve told him, removing his arm from Pierce’s mouth and wiping the blood from his knife onto Pierce’s suit, “You better hope you can crawl better than you can threaten because otherwise you’re going to bleed out here in the snow like a pathetic shit.”
He and Peter were close now, the Kid worked whenever he could and wasn’t in school and Tony always slipped some extra money into his pay packet so he had some extra money to play with after giving some to Aunt May for housekeeping. He was a hit with customers and honestly, the hardest worker Tony had ever seen so Tony was more than happy to give him the extra cash.
Steve stood straight, putting his own hands in his pockets so Tony couldn’t see them shake. Tony seemed to sense something was off, keeping some distance between them instead of closing the gap like he normally would.
Steve was hauled to his feet, eyes on Natasha and Thor as they were led towards different cars, ones with steel bars and armoured escorts.
Howard sighed, “That’s the deal I’m afraid. I want new designs from you. One every month so I can win the support of the shareholders back and you get your way to bring down Rumlow. You’re losing me money, Tony. You need to replace it somehow.”
Rumlow wheezed back into consciousness with a bubble of blood spitting out of his mouth and a heave of his chest. Steve watched him as he dug his fingernails into the concrete beneath him and tried to open his eyes.
He expected Tony to hit him. He wanted Tony to hit him. They needed to make this real for any Hydra goons watching. It was why Steve picked the docks. A public location near Hydra’s base. He needed to send a message that the mechanic wasn’t important, it was the only way to protect Tony from Hydra. Leaving him was the only way to protect Tony from ending up in a cell next to him as an accomplice.
“Oh Jesus.” Fury cursed, slipping in the room and closing the door, “Tell me this isn’t what it looks like.”
But being here with Tony, he could almost forget everyone else in this bar looked at him as a monster. The Captain. The person who stalked the streets at night and was the reason they locked their doors.
He needed to get Tony back and he needed to make Hydra pay for thinking they could take him and it wouldn’t cost them their fucking heads.
Steve snapped out of it at the sound of Tony’s worried voice. He glanced over at him, looking out of place amongst Steve’s things. “No, Tony, no. Stay, please. Sorry, I’m in my head. Hydra, Rumlow. I can’t switch it off.”
Tony pulled back when air became a requirement and Steve found it easier to breath with Tony’s eyes on him, but there was worry in them. He knew there was something Steve wasn’t saying, something he wasn’t ready to put between them. He didn’t poke at it though Steve knew he would eventually. Right now, Tony seemed to know it wasn’t what he needed.
“Okay,” Steve nodded, “The phone that I answered, I took it off the Hydra guy at the party. Pierce. Rumlow’s errand boy, looking for political favours to move his bombs. It was Rumlow on the phone, I didn’t know when I answered it.”
He hates killing people sometimes, even when they deserve it. It takes him right back to his days in the army when the orders of execution came in and he was meant to simply follow them without question. It was a matter of security. So was this, family security. Steve knew he’d cover the streets of Brooklyn red with blood if that’s what it took to protect his family and stop Hydra.
Steve felt himself bristle at Bucky’s tone, the anger was shallow but there was something behind it that wasn’t, “You want to talk to me? Or do we need to head to the basement to spar it out?”
“You kept your word, didn’t you?” Fury pointed out, “You helped me with Hydra. You stopped Rumlow. In exchange for your word I promised you immunity, I kept my word too. You don’t have to accept the job with me, the immunity will still stand. Just know, this job is the only way I can guarantee you all stay together and walk out of this. Without it, immunity is a mixed bag. Witness protection at best, you’d all be separated. You’d never see Tony again.”
Tony smiled, leaning down so his lips were inches away, “You’re not in charge, Captain. I am.” He placed his mouth against Steve’s, smiling into their kiss when Steve tried to give it everything he could to keep Tony there. The wet swipe of his tongue against Tony’s lips, the way he bit down on his bottom lip when Tony tried to pull back to keep him there a little longer.
He saw the flicker of a hundred different emotions dance across Tony’s eyes as he finished his work.
Steve sighed; Sam really was like an old housewife that lived on gossip. He ignored the message, moving onto the next one from Bucky:
When had Tony Stark become something of an addiction to him? Their kiss in the garage? The night they slept together? Somewhere between talking and snarking at each other?
“It’s fine, I’ll see how long he’s going to be. As long as he’s out of here before Thor gets back. I don’t like ears I don’t know.” Steve replied, heading out the back of the house towards the steps that led to the garage.
That was one of the best things about Natasha in Steve’s opinion. That unwavering trust she placed in him, like she knew he’d sort it somehow. “Winter, I need you to get rid of the bodies. Discreetly and permanently. Widow, get that car out of here and ditch it. Get my bike back to base and get someone in to fix it. I want it done before we have another run in with Hydra.” They both nodded and Bucky was already leaning down to move Sitwell’s body, “Thor, can you head down to the docks? They pulled him because of a body they think belongs to us. I need to know the details. Report back to me with what you find, okay?”
And Tony was giving him a soft smile despite knowing all of that. He was biting his bottom lip, like he was unsure of what to say next and all Steve wanted to do in that moment was lean over and kiss him.
Okay, Steve left. Steve was probably making the smart decision, he was all wrong for Tony, wasn’t he? That was why Tony hadn’t told Rhodey about him yet. He knew every word Steve said at the docks had been right and he was too ashamed to admit it to him. Maybe Steve did him a favour. That doesn’t mean he wasn’t beyond angry though. Whether Steve was right in his decision or not, Tony knew he was running scared and that pissed him off more than anything. He’d never met anyone who was as good at self-sabotage as he was.
“They would have healed, Tony. They would have adjusted. They would have been free and safe.” Steve told him, “How could I not pick this plan?”
“Cops look after their own. I would want answers as well.” Steve nodded, “Did they say anything useful?”
The King of Brooklyn without a Kingdom. The Captain without a team. Then, he wouldn’t be either of those things anymore if he signed those papers. But Steve Rogers had died in a desert on foreign soil so he would he be then?
“I hope he comes for the pretty red-head first,” He replied with a sneer, “She looks like she can be feisty.”
“To build the Jericho.” Rumlow explained, “Everything you need according to your father’s designs. If you need anything else, we can get it.”
It was nice, this little safe haven carved out of Tony’s life. Tony’s skin against his. Steve managed to find enough strength to haul Tony in close to him, arms tight around the mechanic while he buried his nose into Tony’s hair and then he was out like a light, barely feeling the kiss Tony placed over his heart softly as he relaxed into him.
Tony tore his mouth away from Steve’s when breathing became a requirement and Steve moved down to pay attention to Tony’s neck. He preened at the feel of Steve sucking his pulse point, head moving back to rest against the door and allowing Steve more access. It turned out Tony was very sensitive around that area and Steve couldn’t help the smile on his face when he kissed at the spot where Tony’s neck met his shoulder and was rewarding with a rough thrust of Tony’s hips against him.
Tony pushed him away for a moment, pulling his t-shirt over his head in one quick movement before letting it drop to the floor. Steve’s mouth went dry at the expense of smooth olive skin that was revealed to him, all soft lines and teasing edges.
Steve closed his eyes at the pain in Tony’s voice, “Tony, no. It killed me, standing on the dock and saying that to you. Telling you I didn’t want this. It killed me. The way you looked at me, I never want to see you look like that again. Especially not because of me.”
Steve brought his fingers up to his mouth, swirling his tongue over them to make sure they were slick enough for Tony. He didn’t keep lube in his office, and he wasn’t prepared to stop their administrations to hunt some down. As soon as Steve was satisfied, his fingers were back, circling the skin of Tony’s entrance before he pushed one inside.
“Lucky for us, politicians never stop working.” Steve replied over his shoulder as he passed his bike to head out, already dialling a number into his phone.
“He’s here to see me.” Tony replied quickly, “Personal stuff, kid. Why don’t you and Ned go grab lunch?”
The man on top of him was heavy, in bulky padded jacket and combat trousers as he wrestled with Tony furiously. Tony gave at good as he got, thrashing his arms about until he managed to get the umbrella in his hand at the right angle, shoving it as hard as he could into the guy’s side.
Tony panicked, looking down at the device in his hands then back to Steve’s face. He could hear the doorknob turning behind him.
“Sorry, Captain, I have orders not to take no for an answer.” Sitwell stated with a cocky expression and he used the move to jerk a hand towards his hip. Steve knew there was a gun there, his coat sat awkwardly on that side. Sitwell’s mistake was buttoning it up, if he left it loose like Steve’s own leather jacket then the gun on his hip would be practically invisible.
“He had politicians funding it,” Steve paused, unsure whether telling Fury the whole story was wise or whether he’d see it as a desperate attempt for Steve to cling onto his freedom, “And Ross. He’s Hydra. I don’t know how long for, since he came to Brooklyn probably.”
Rhodey tried to move closer but Tony shook his head violently and tried to curl up tighter, “Okay, I’ll still right here, okay?”
His head dipped down as he worked on sucking a path across Tony’s ribs, warm skin under his lips as Tony hitched his legs higher up Steve’s waist. Steve reached his nipple, flicking his tongue against the pert bud, Tony jerked, arms coming up and knocking the fruit bowl off the table, the plastic clattering to the floor as apples and oranges rolled at their feet.
Howard’s office was on the top floor, the arrogance of a man thinking he was top of the world. Tony made his way up there, Bucky trailing behind. He’d gone silent again, hands in his pockets and while he wasn’t as big as Steve, he did cut an impressively imposing figure against all the suited Stark Industries workers as they passed. There were whispers as Tony led the way, many people couldn’t believe the son of Howard Stark was back. He looked taller and older and nothing like Howard in his ratty jeans and jacket. Tony was sure he even heard a camera go off as they headed up to Howard’s office, but he held his head high and his back ram-rod straight. Just like being seventeen again and being attacked by vultures.
He did the only thing he could think of. He threw himself at Steve as the door opened. Steve stumbled back in shock, cuffed hands gripping the front of Tony’s jacket to steady them both as Tony kissed him. Their lips fused together with a practiced ease and Steve felt so good under his mouth, so warm and soothing, Tony couldn’t help but deepen the kiss.
He watched, the ticking sound from the clock marking the passage of time. Ross might have thought this was his show but Steve knew better. It was
He lifted his head, seeing the glaze of Tony’s eyes and the way he held his shoulders too stiffly, “I’m sorry. I’m doing this for you.”
“He had a meeting with Hydra’s leader this morning, we didn’t see a face or hear a name, but it was definitely him. Four-man escort to the meeting and he was in there for over an hour. Bucky got sick of waiting it out and decided to engage.” Natasha told him.
Clint sighed down the phone, Steve could tell it was out of relief, “I didn’t mean to miss the meeting, Cap.”
Natasha was on her feet, heading over to him with a bounce in her step, “You look like you could use a coffee.”
“Steve, steve, steve.” Tony babbled, body a livewire on the edge of pleasure, trusting Steve to get him there.
Natasha raised an eyebrow, closing Tony’s fingers firmly around the knife in his hand, “You find a soft spot and push.”
Tony pushed the door open slowly, eyes scanning through the dark to try and make out anything out of the ordinary in the shadows. His hand automatically reached inside, blindly searching until his palm felt the rough material of the umbrella he kept in the stand by the door. It was a plain black one, large and imposing. He hadn’t used it since Jarvis’ funeral when he was a teenager. There were probably still photos on the internet somewhere of him dressed all in black, face hidden by this very umbrella at the graveside to hide his tears. It wasn’t becoming of Stark men to cry. Howard was stone faced throughout the entire service, indifference and cold, much like every other day.
Tony nodded, “It wasn’t a difficult job. I think I spent longer buffing that shine back into her than I did sorting out the dent. It’s a beautiful car, Cap.”
Steve walked towards Sitwell slowly, his family taking their silence order to follow him as Sitwell and his men did the same. The headlights from Sitwell’s car provided enough light in the clearing to illuminate them and cast shadows on the shipping crates surround them.
The next floor was for Clint, Natasha and Bucky and they had their own bathroom as well. Clint had a box room at the end of the hall which he said he wanted because the window looked out over downtown Brooklyn and he always liked a good vantage point. Natasha’s was the biggest, it seemed like a no brainer to everyone involved that she would need it and so no one battered an eyelid when she had moved all her stuff in. Bucky’s was on the other side of her, a messy tornado of dirty clothes and empty plates that never seemed to find their way down to the kitchen. Steve always shook his head at that, some things never changed.
Killing a man had effected Tony in a way that not even Steve could predict. He woke up screaming and struggling most nights, that fear and horror at the realisation of what he had done sending him into a panic attack. Ragged breathing and shaking and Steve could do nothing but stay with him as he rode it out, getting him to match his breathing to Steve’s and muttering reassuring words to him until he came back to himself. It tore Steve’s heart out and it didn’t seem to be showing any signs of stopping. It was one of the reasons Steve hated it when Tony spent the night at home alone, he worried that he’d have a nightmare and be by himself. Steve would break house arrest for him in a second if Tony needed him but he knew Tony better than that. He wouldn’t call, he’d suffer in silence until morning and then try and play it off like it was nothing.
“Open your eyes, sweetheart, let me you see like this.” Steve whispered in the space between them, that same term of endearment as before slipping out easily. Tony did as he asked, eyes fluttering open until dark brown met dark blue. Steve rubbed against his prostate faster, pushing a little harder against it and then Tony was coming hard.
Tony’s hips stuttered once, twice and then he was coming hard. His cum coated Steve’s thigh and he was shaking into Steve’s arm as he gasped into their kiss. He shuddered, rocking against Steve’s thigh to ride off the aftershocks of his orgasm and rested his head against him as he came down for the high.
“Quiet, remember?” Tony teased, nipping at his jaw as he stroked the length of him from base to tip.
“Thanks for that, it was getting rough in there.” Clint greeted when he approached Steve, making himself comfortable against the same car.
He had already spun on his heel and that left Steve with no choice but to follow him. Steve caught up with Fury easily, grabbing him by the arm and halting him in his tracks. He couldn’t shake the feeling of dread in his stomach, Fury was too cold and aloof. Had he changed his mind about his offer? Had Ross gotten to him?
Tony watched Ross carefully, noticing every little detail. The beads of sweat that collected on his temple, making it shiny in the dim light. The way his skin pulled too taunt over his knuckles, making them white and strained. Ross was holding back a whole flood of emotions and Tony knew he was in the firing line.
The snow was falling fast, already collecting on the ground and Steve stopped to scoop some up. He pushed the cold snow into Tony’s burnt palm despite the other man’s slight flinch at that action.
“You should have told me.” Tony replied, bringing a hand up to rub his forehead, “We could have come up with something else. Or I could have played along.”
“I can make that happen.” Fury nodded, “I’ll be running the unit out of here, so you’d all need to stay together. There will be conditions, trackers to make sure you’re accounted for until you can prove your trust. I’m putting my faith in you, but it doesn’t mean everyone will. House arrest, maybe, for the first few months. I haven’t worked out all the details yet.”
Thor nodded, “It makes sense if he truly craves the power of ruling a city, Captain. Bombs would made him invincible.”
Steve’s hips stuttered and he bit back a moan, Tony needed to be there with him to come. He reached down between them, hand finding Tony’s cock to take it in his fist, stroking him to pace with his cock buried in his ass. Tony whimpered, slightly from arousal and slightly from over stimulation but he wrapped his legs tighter around Steve and grabbed Steve’s other hand in his free one to place them both over Tony’s heart, hammering in his chest.
Tony admired that. As awful as it was. He admired Steve, despite the killings and the gangs and the bloodshed. He admired a man who couldn’t back away from a fight because if he did then he wasn’t going to survive it. Tony had done the exact same thing, just without using his fists. He fought against Howard every chance he got, he left and took his genius with him, he built his own life and his own work and everyday he continue to do it was another day he was winning the fight he had been locked in with his father for the past few decades.
Phillips got comfortable and complacent. He was cocky and arrogant and it got him killed. Steve wasn’t about to make that same mistake.
Tony pulled back; pupils blown. He kept his eyes locked on Steve’s as he slid his hand down to cup his growing erection through his pants, “I guess that means we’ll just have to be quiet.” He responded cheekily.
When Steve got home after his first day under Fury’s charge, he found Tony in the kitchen perched on top of the counter sipping a cup of coffee. He looked well rested, which was a first for him. He gave Steve a sleepy smile as he pushed his way into the house, dumping his bag on the floor at the sight of his boyfriend.
Tony surged forward, stepping between Steve’s legs as he wrapped his arms around his shoulders. Steve pushed his forehead into Tony’s stomach, the sweat on his brow sticking to Tony’s t-shirt.
Steve simply ignored him, “Immunity for the team. My file and any copies you made erased from the record. Your smart, Fury. I doubt anyone else would have figured it out but smart doesn’t mean invincible and I need you to understand if you tell anyone who I am then I’ll have to kill you and them and it will just be a bloody messy business so I’d rather avoid that outcome if we can.”
Steve closed his eyes and allowed himself to drift off with the feeling of Tony curled against him, spent from their orgasms and the thought that called Tony ‘sweetheart’ had sent a thrill through him in an uncomfortably happy way. He had just enough energy to pull the sheet around them both so Tony wouldn’t get cold before he passed out from exhaustion.
Tony shifted closer, closing the gap between them, pressing his mouth to the back of Steve’s hand whilst their fingers were still locked together, “You didn’t. Just never really had someone willing to kill for me before.”
“Army training.” Steve replied, “They made us learn how to get out of knots and handcuffs whilst blindfolded and trapped in the boot of a moving vehicle for basic training.”
“Our Captain and the team often need patching up, it made it easier if I was here rather than them coming into my clinic and scaring my patients.” Bruce replied, making his way through the kitchen and down towards the basement.
Fury seemed to sense Steve’s loss of words, “I’ll make you a deal. You have an honest conversation with me, here and now. No cameras, off the record. And I’ll make sure he’s brought down here to answer a few questions once he’s done with Ross. You’ll get to say it yourself then.”
Steve let his hands slip from the sides of the tub under the water, “Fury’s idea. Time to say goodbye to The Captain.” He felt almost nervous despite the fact Tony was getting naked a few feet from him.
“Shhh.” Steve reminded him, rubbing against his prostrate firmly until Tony was throwing his head back against the table and squeezing against Steve’s fingers.
Their onlookers seemed to grow uncomfortable and quickly disappeared, leaving the two friends to their privacy.
Steve wasted no time in sealing his lips over Tony’s. The kiss was soft and slow and sweet. Steve placed a hand on Tony’s cheek, feeling him lean into his palm. They were going to be okay. Whatever Rumlow and Ross threw at them, they’d fight it together.
