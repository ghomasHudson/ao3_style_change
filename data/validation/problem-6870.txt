Seeing that he was being paranoid at the moment, the girl could only hope for an early end to this travesty and obediently licked Steve clean carefully. He admired the way she worked so hard that her cheeks sunk in, while he rubbed the newly placed ring on her left ring finger.
Toni just avoided answering the first half of the sentence, "If I hadn't gone into the enemy crowd today, it would have been Captain America who would have been injured, I couldn't just watch ...... maybe the battle wouldn't be over by now and more people would have been hurt, I had to do it. "
"Little boy destined to be alone," Toni took the bottle of water and took a couple of sips, "but seriously, haven't you ever met someone who made you want to settle down?"
"In my opinion, why don't we just take out Hydra's lair, subdue the Red Skull and then take our time to work out a way to save my friend?" Thor said, picking up his hammer and seemingly heading out the door immediately.
Natasha hadn't thought about how to console her fiancé, not anticipating the hands that continued to mess on her body, her brain uncontrollably directing her to utter the words, "I didn't satisfy you enough just now, is that why you're so urgent to do it again? Or several times?"
Natasha seemed shocked by the thought, and she immediately dismissed it. There was no way in hell she was ready to enter into a normal good and healthy relationship. Not to mention the fact that she was also Iron Woman and should not and could not have brought an ordinary person into her life that was so full of danger. If she really was just an ordinary white-collar worker, she would have pursued him.
"Told you I didn't have a soul mate. But really? Asking that at a time like this? Are you from what, the 40's, and you're just going to have to be a gentleman if you can't get the name right? Why don't you say the name on you too and maybe it'll be me." Natasha was still lying on her back with her hair down, and although there was some mockery in her tone, there was nothing sarcastic in her expression, nor did she look like she had any anger.
When he put the identities of Howard's daughter, Iron Woman, and Natasha Stark, the brown-haired, brown-eyed girl with the warm smile in the photo, together, it suddenly dawned on him that he had found the one.
The call was answered, "It's Captain, have you come around and now want to give me a lecture on the assignment schedule?"
The 22-year-old Toni had been forced by Pepper to go to a charity dinner; Pepper had only meant for her to come out for a break, better open up and find someone she could rely on, or at least learn to start treating herself a little better. Toni, who hadn't fully recovered from her low point, left the event after a couple of drinks at the bar. Steve, 27, on the other hand, has had a great response to his first film as a leading role, which has given him many new job opportunities and some freedom to choose his scripts. He met a director before rushing off to this rare opportunity to meet a lot of famous actors and actresses.
Natasha was still shocked that Steve had remembered all of it so quickly, and for a moment her mind went blank as she didn't know what to say, while the man was already touching all over her delicately.
Natasha became visibly depressed, and Steve took the girl out for a drive when he had spare time. The two of them spent the afternoon at the beach, but they just played in the water and sun like children, Steve in his regular clothes, Natasha snuggled in his arms, and when she couldn't see his eyes, she was in a trance for a while, as if she was back with Captain America.
Toni didn't expect the six months since she and Steve had been together to go so quickly, the film had finished shooting and they saw each other much less, but she still called Steve when she couldn't sleep, and the man on the other end of the line seemed ever-patient and soothing, listening to her ramblings in the middle of the night, preparing three presents for her birthday and flying all the way over to see her.
Natasha gripped his shoulders tightly, her gaze never leaving his gentle blue eyes, "Steve, I've missed you so much."
The strings that had been taut for four years broke instantly, "You can't ...... I can't ...... I can't live without you, and neither can Morgan." Steve held his love's cheek in trembling hands.
Steve didn't want to argue on the subject and cut off her unfinished sentence just in time. From the corner of her mouth to her neck and down again, the man rubbed his chin against her increasingly soft breasts, even deliberately stubbing the sensitive tips of her nipples with his stubble. The girl tingled and tickled, reaching up to grab his blonde hair and laughing at his nastiness.
The expensive sports car was left by Toni on the side of the road and without a word she walked the long way back to the building with him. A light rain fell on the last stretch of the road and Steve tried to go to the shop to buy an umbrella but was stopped by Toni, "It's nice not to have an umbrella, it's a great atmosphere for the end of our film."
Nor did she expect Steve to be enraged at once. He lunged at her and pinned her hands to the sides of her head, ignoring Natasha's pain as he touched her injuries, and simply said, "Who are you looking at through me? Who are you thinking about? I don't need that thing. Can't I afford to have a baby?"
The girl finally couldn't stand being treated so roughly and her voice took on a choke, "Steve, you can't do this to me." She took two steps forward on her knees, trying to pull away from his topping so she could turn and look into his eyes, trying to summon some sense from him.
Tony was silent for a long time, "You know I used to worry that we would lose the war, so I spent all my time fighting for a chance to win, not that I ever thought about it in that way. Now that I know we're going to win," he gave his love a compassionate smile, "maybe I can arrange some first aid for myself. But soldier, I can't really guarantee how successful that approach will be. I'll grant your request, but you also have to promise me that even if it doesn't really work out in the end, you'll ......" his words faded into a kiss as Steve leaned over, "I believe in you, Iron Man can do anything, and all my hopes are in you. "
Natasha just looked down as if she was trying to tuck herself into the wall. Steve's hand pinched harder, "Are you jealous?"
He sat up and gently propped the girl's cheek to try and get her to lift her head, "Hey Nat, I know you miss me, but you don't need to prove it by doing this to yourself so much."
Toni's tears filled her eyes, but she was smiling, her faint voice disappearing between their inseparable lips, "Want to do it?"
Steve just smiled triumphantly, "It's because my Toni is so tempting that I don't want to leave your little hole for a second." Saying that without giving her another chance to say it back, he leaned down, his chest pressed against the girl's back, his hands gripping hers so she was holding on to the bed rail, "You're much better than a sex toy." The man got up again and lifted her up to prevent her from pressing against her stomach, and asked, as if in doubt, "How deep are you, baby? Why do I always feel like I can't get to the bottom?"
Peter's mind was overflowing with questions, but he swallowed them all for fear of saying something wrong. He fetched his new outfit and fled as fast as he could. One was Iron Man's boss and the other was Iron Man's comrade, not to mention the fact that these were the two men he admired most, Captain America and respected most, Mr. Stark, and they shouldn't be cheating on Mr. Iron Man behind his back, right?
"Nat, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... anyway. I don't know what I can do to make it up to you, and maybe nothing I can do will make me accept those days and go on enjoying your kindness to me as if they didn't exist. I'm afraid that one day I won't be able to control myself and I'll hurt you, so maybe I should..." The sentence that followed seemed to weigh a thousand pounds, and he didn't finish it in the end.
With quadruple vision, he could easily notice the way Toni's eyes lit up when she looked at him from the stage as if she really loved him. He mentally warned himself that he shouldn't think so much about it, that the Starks wouldn't stop for any one person. But he didn't hear another voice in his mind: hadn't Howard, the playboy he knew, finally settled down?
This left Natasha's dreams unsettled. Sometimes the dreams were also on her knees with Captain Hydra ramming into her body behind her and Captain America's big guy thrusting in her mouth in front of her. She reached up to touch those blue eyes and woke up all of a sudden with only the morning exercise of Captain Hydra, only those red eyes staring mischievously at her with the dick in her mouth below and her tongue being played with by his fingers above.
It seemed that Natasha finally believed him and she took his hand and brought it to her lips and kissed it delicately, "Don't leave me and don't fall in love with anyone else."
"Mr. Stark, as our contributor, your health is also an important issue for me to consider, more coffee is not good, please make sure you don't practice your fighting skills with me again over sneaking coffee in the middle of the night, Clint, you should stop eating too, tomorrow's training will be double!"
Steve laughed and pulled a bottle of water out of his bag and handed it to her, "Why would I want to make a whale cry?"
Steve loved her smile and dropped a kiss on the corner of her mouth and rubbed her little tummy, "Goodnight Toni my baby, goodnight my little baby. " And then he wrapped his arms around her and drifted off to sleep as well.
The man laughed low twice, "Just to test how much potential you have." The two did a few rounds against this babbling doorway before Steve picked up the girl's clothes, which he had already torn a little, wrapped her roughly in them and carried her out the door.
She stopped several taxis in quick succession, but no one believed her. One of the drivers did think she resembled the SI CEO, who had been in the media, but decided that the famous Natasha Stark could never be in such a situation where she could not afford a ride, and finally decided she was a fraud. So she taunted the drivers with those harsh words before they took off. At the end of the day, she returned to a slightly sheltered spot in front of the station and thought about what she should do.
She realised this just a week into the shoot when, during a dating scene, Steve said the line "You had me at hello" according to the script, and those deep blue eyes made Toni think about it and forget her next line.
Natasha Stark was not a little girl to be protected, she was Iron Woman alongside Captain America. He was also bound to do more than pampering her, but to live and die with her. They would rely on each other, understand each other, and grow old together, Steve thought aimlessly as he held Natasha in his arms as she drifted off to sleep.
Phanie panicked a little, calculating in her mind the several reasons why the Prince wanted to see her: was it because she was suspicious with nowhere to come from? Or had she been discovered before she could return that shield? The worst that could happen was that she would be thrown out, it was not a big big deal except that she had only just found a reason to want to stay here ......
Natasha looked down at his other hand spread out in his palm, there was the phone Pepper had stuffed in his arms earlier, it had fallen out of his coat pocket at some point and was probably broken.
He grabbed the girl's hand to stop her panic, "I'm fine," he looked up confused at his fiancée who had suffered so much and still refused to tell him anything, hesitating for a moment before letting go of her hand again and his voice seemed hoarse, "I've remembered everything."
Steve remembered that he did get a text from Toni inviting him - Captain America - to a dinner party, and as Steve Evans already invited to the party, Steve naturally found a random reason to decline. Was Toni unhappy because of this? He'd never known Captain America was so important to her.
With that, he literally picked up the microphone and handed it to Natasha, who looked past him to the Christmas tree in the distance and took it, "Hi Toni, this is you in the future and it's 2012. Oh she doesn't believe me", Natasha covered the microphone and skewered at Grant, "you should, didn't you grow up believing that one day you would build a time machine? Okay listen, what I'm trying to tell you is don't let the old man and Mom go out on holiday for Christmas. Or, if ...... that thing ends up being inevitable, always remember to tell him you love him every time you see him. Don't be so quick to deny it! You know I am you, and I know you really love him and he loves you."
"Tony," Steve's voice started to tremble, "I know what you did to MK85, you can't say you love me and do this to me at the same time."
As they chatted until the shop was ready to close, Steve took out his wallet out of habit, only to receive a big blank stare from Toni, "Let me make sure you really know who I am, right?"
"You're crazy! That's Toni Stark! She can make me bankrupt with a mere phone call. Please, just take pity on me and take this job! It's only a week, you will get over it even with the hardest person to deal with, and Miss Stark has never been anything else but kind of mean to us. Think of how much your career will take off in the future if you get her favour, instead of being a pathetic little mass actor with me, and maybe I'll have to look up to you in the future."
No one had any news of Steve's location until the early lights, Natasha couldn't spend any more time in the studio without her fiancé, so she went back to her bedroom and dialled Pepper's number, stammering for a while before she got to the point, to Pepper's baffled expression. "You don't think he's backtracked and tried to run away from the marriage?"
Everyone has a soul mate. It is said that when a person makes that most crucial decision that affects their life, the name of their soulmate will slowly emerge on a certain patch of skin on their body. But there are still many people who never see their soulmate's name in their lives, perhaps because they made the wrong decision and missed out on their soulmate forever. There are also many more people who, even though they know that name, do not end up with their soul mate. This is so common that almost no one cares that the name on their real partner is not himself/herself.
"The whole base knows that Agent 7 is pregnant and I'm afraid she hasn't been serving our Captain comfortably for months. She just has an average face and body, and you're only treating her differently because she saved your life once? Besides, she's still having an affair with Agent 15. In fact, we are all wondering who is the father of the baby in her belly. If you're tired of her, Captain, it's in everyone's interest to move on sooner rather than later."
The man beside him finally couldn't listen any longer and opened his face mask to reveal the moustached president's face that had charmed countless people, "The truth is, I am Iron Man."
She had never known that Steve's soft voice could sound cruel. "Any more nonsense and my shield will not spare you." The man's voice was cold, and when he finished he pushed the girl away from him and strode away.
"Yes?" not sure if it was an illusion, Steve thought he heard detachment in the AI's voice, "Captain Rogers?"
It was late afternoon when Natasha woke up again. Clint, Thor and Natasha - the redheaded female agent - had returned from the battle and Pepper was at her bedside. They hadn't seen her in months, and everyone was worried about her condition. "It's just low blood sugar, nothing serious, but your injury ...... cap's shield if I'm not mistaken," Bruce said as he changed her medicine and added when he saw her nod, "Anyway, if you want the baby to be well, just stay in bed for a few days." The crowd was surprised and concerned to hear Bruce announce that there had been a baby in Natasha's belly for over three months.
Natasha didn't know how to react yet, when the driver held out his hand and handed back his credit card, "Your card won't work." He then handed out another card, "It still won't work." Whereupon the driver flung his car door shut and left the two to continue standing on the side of the road.
The man couldn't help but laugh as he held the large, not yet fully ejaculated cock irrigating the girl's depths while he moved a good chunk of her towards the end of the bed and felt her head again, "Does it still hurt?"
Phanie was even more dumbfounded, her mouth opened but she couldn't say a word. The prince didn't know if he was being forgiving or narrow-minded, but he just kept talking to Old butler, "I've only been away for half a month, but Jar, you've found such a treasure and you won't even tell me?"
Both the boss and Steve himself were a little dumbfounded as Toni looked at Steve's immediately flushed face and added, "Don't get me wrong, I'm not here to bag a bimbo or find a one-night stand, a kiss scene maybe?" She sharply removed her sunglasses and raised an eyebrow at Steve, "I won't force the bed scene, but I won't say no if you want to finish it in person." Admiring Steve's more embarrassed expression, she smiled even wider instead.
Steve gradually loosened the restrictions on Natasha's movements, though fearing she would overwork herself, the girl was only allowed to work half a day, and the rest of the time she was basically either Steve out with her for a walk or she was wandering around the base by herself.
After the impatient first time, Natasha gradually realises that Steve is not unconcerned with her feelings, despite all his tricks. Apart from the occasional paranoia of torturing her to scream out, Steve is increasingly showing the restraint of his former self. When he is in a good mood, he is as gentle as ever, taking pleasure in dragging Natasha slowly into the sea of desire.
It was true, as she had thought before, that if she were still living the life of a playgirl, she would not hesitate to jump on the man in front of her. One night together had shown her the sincerity and kindness that he could not fake, and the courage she desired but could not have. But she was tired of the emptiness she felt after the constant one-night stands, and at least she saw Grant in a different way to those she had slept with before.
Steve slowly approached the fallen armour in a defensive stance with his shield raised, Natasha mused that she hadn't been able to beat Steve in her previous combat training and simply withdrew the armour from her head, "Steve, it's me."
Phanie didn't know how her face could get any redder, she just repeated it twice, "Tony you really should go see the majesty." Tony dropped another kiss on her cheek and got up, "I hope I hear you say yes when I get back."
"No, don't be so hard on yourself, you were just brainwashed back then Steve, it wasn't you. And..." She nudged him twice on the lips, "I see that even brainwashed you weren't keen on destroying the world at all, the dark side of Captain America was just trying to lock up Iron Woman for himself to fuck from morning to night, that would have been the easiest way to save the world."
It had been a long time since Natasha had felt any kindness from anyone other than Rhodey and Pepper that had nothing to do with her status, and she remained unconvinced for a moment, "You, don't know me?"
At Natasha's repeated pleas, Bruce, despite her disapproval, did as she said and hid the memories of the period of brainwashing in Steve's brain, which allowed Steve to sleep for a few more days, and by the time he woke up, Natasha was well and alive again.
Natasha didn't expect that from Captain America and burst out laughing all at once, but tears were streaming down the corners of her eyes, whispering I miss you I love you over and over again.
Natasha rounded the corner to hear these words. In the old days, Captain America had attracted many girls too, but Iron Woman had never worried about it. Because she knew that Steve cherished her and loved her, and at this point she was nothing more than a long-term bedmate for Captain Hydra, and the baby was nothing more than a tool he used to keep her confined to him, and might not be able to hold on to his remain responsibility. If one day he did get bored, he would only abandon her without hesitation. It was the fact that she could never refuse those eyes that had put her in this dilemma. If one day he were to abandon her for someone else, she wouldn't know how she would continue to face him after he returned to normal. Captain Hydra rarely spoke of his love to her, and the few times he did, it came out of his mouth in bed. At this point Steve's love for her was merely possessive, a master's love for his toy, but how much of it was true to his former self? She stood in the corner thinking that it would be better to take him home soon, and wishing that Bruce could work out a solution tomorrow.
So he took the girl's hand and together they went shopping for souvenirs that the two of them didn't even need, and got dressed into silly couple shirts. At Toni's insistence, they also took a number of large headshot photos.
"We left that hospital on the same day, and maybe sometime we brushed past each other in front of the hospital." Steve, who later found out about the coincidence after being with Toni, said.
He crouched down in front of Tony and held his hand tightly. Tony tapped his reactor, his voice faint, "It's still on, I think I can still receive some first aid."
"Wow, innocent boy, don't you know? The Ferris wheel is a confession mecca, for the ten minutes it takes to go round, no one will bother you and the girl won't get away, pull out flowers, get down on your knees and confess, ten minutes is enough to make a whale cry!"
It had to be said that the memories of the icy sea had prevented Steve from developing a love for the sport of swimming again, "I don't know much, I can watch you swim."
As expected Steve gave that "Toni no" look, "No, Pepper has repeatedly told you that your heart can't afford that and you can't ride the roller coaster."
Back in Toni's office on the top floor, before he could enter, his quadruple hearing allowed him to faintly hear Toni arguing with someone, another voice whose owner seemed to be Miss Potts. ...... is just so pathetic... . to lie to myself about getting over ...... how to deal with ...... sooner or later it will ruin ......"
Although Toni was the one who didn't want to come in the first place, it was Toni who had the fun later, dragging Steve over and over again on the roller coaster. It wasn't until later that the super soldier was a little confused, "Don't you fly in the sky every day? Why would you like to ride a roller coaster so many times, it must not be as exciting as your life as the Iron Woman."
Although ...... the man still hadn't returned to those close times with him, it had been a year since the Infinity War and the world was slowly recovering from its great grief, and he saw no reason why they should be prevented from spending the rest of their long lives together. The moustached man just needed some more time, and patience was the last thing he needed.
The man touched the corners of the girl's eyes with his fingers and lifted the hand she was wearing the ring on, "Do you think this ring is just for nothing? Toni, why don't you believe that I really love you? I have never had anyone else in my eyes, you can tell me anything you don't feel condifent in. If you don't believe me, we'll find a place to get married tomorrow where SHIELD can't chase us. Not to mention the fact that we already have a child, I love you and I won't leave you."
She really hadn't expected to be sleeping with Captain Hydra before the main purpose of the trip had been achieved. But she did miss Steve too, like crazy. So she just shook her head gently and said, "Condom."
Toni handed Pepper the sunglasses she was holding and put on her standard professional smile, "Steve, you know me?"
Natasha didn't think so. Having just dumped a bed partner for a plane ride, she didn't believe she could have a soul mate, she thought she had made enough bad decisions to not have the name. Secondly, she couldn't understand how this seemingly ordinary trip could be the pivotal event that would affect her life.
They landed in Boston. That hotel had been bought by Stark Industries, and that room was no longer available for public accommodation. Only because that room contained one of the SI president's favourite paintings that she couldn't bear to take away.
Toni didn't dwell on him, but changed the subject to something else he couldn't quite resist as well, "Want to do it?"
It was the old capsicle that bothered the team today.Natasha muttered to herself as she summoned Jarvis to locate the captain.
I don't want to lie to her, Natasha said to herself in her mind. But she won't understand me. Only by devoting all her time to something more meaningful, whether it was perfecting her armour, dealing with emergencies, or surrounding herself with people to get more opportunities to help more people, would she feel that she wasn't wasting her life.
"Has it ever occurred to you that maybe Captain America isn't as bright and honest as everyone sees him?"
Back at the building, while Toni was in the shower, he took out his phone to routinely check if S.H.I.E.L.D. had anything for him. Little did he know that Nick Fury had called him ten times and sent thirty texts in the space of a day. Steve was on edge and wondered what was going on.
Just when she wanted to ask herself if this was what a crush felt like, the little maid who lived with her came to her in a hurry and said that old Butler Jarvis told her to hurry up and that the Prince wanted to see her.
He froze a little, should he pretend he hadn't heard him at this point, or should he explain to Toni right away? Before he could say a word Toni shook her head again, "No, you're not him, Captain America wouldn't be as nice to me as you are."
"It seems I don't usually satisfy you properly." The man's pride was not to be challenged and his tone rose dangerously, not to mention that Steve wasn't really unable to, "Hold on tight Toni, daddy's just about to start." The girl refused to say anything and gave two hard contractions underneath her to show she knew. Steve was instantly soothed, grabbing her waist and pressing it against himself, he began to sprint.
"It's your fault for being late, I didn't see a single good-looking guy that night, you must not have been there when I left, otherwise I would have met you." Toni said when she found out about it after she got together with Steve.
He reached out to touch the girl's cheek but shuddered and withdrew it, as a scene that pained him came to him.
Steve casually threw his shield to the ground and as it landed with a crunch, he stepped forward and hugged Toni before whispering in her ear, "But I do."
Toni's years of pride did not sit well with the press, and this reporter portrayed Toni as flirtatious and casual, while Steve was portrayed as a boy who would sell himself out to get career opportunities.
And so Phanie moved from the back yard, where she did the menial work, to the inner courtyard of the Prince's house. The little maids she used to live with could not help but secretly speculate that this girl would be lucky to be with Prince for one night. But Phanie had no idea how complicated it was to listen to these words, she just stood guard for the Prince as always.
Tony laughed again, "It doesn't matter if you don't remember what you used to be, you just have to remember that from now on you are the Prince's love, and if you do remember that you used to be a killer, then ......" Tony deliberately paused, "then what? " Fanny blurted out, and chided herself in turn for having these hidden expectations. "Then you'll retire from now on and only be my killer."
The crew was overjoyed that they could get a top actor of Toni's calibre for this small budget production and were happy to do all what Toni wanted.
It was Phanie's voice, and she and Pepper were the only ones in the whole house who dared to talk to him like that. The man under the covers squirmed twice and fell back to sleep again.
"Toni, you're too young to understand, and I hope you never do, and always believe that if you love each other you'll always be together."
When he got up the next day and didn't see Phanie, he was a bit anxious, so he called Jarvis and sent people to search for her. When she was nowhere to be found, Jarvis came to tell him that his father had asked him to go to the palace again. "Didn't you see I'm busy, I just met him yesterday, I'm not going!"
Steve's excitement was high every day, but Natasha was anxious. She just wanted to get Steve home as soon as possible,but putting the baby on the way at a time when she might not even be able to save herself is not what she expected. Natasha and Steve's baby, the one she had been waiting for for so long. But at this point, she could no longer steal a blood sample while Steve was asleep either, and often she was just about to get up when Steve's subconscious movements would re-pin her to his dick.
"No one gets used to the vitriol, Toni, I want to stand by your side, we'll beat the rumours and vilification with a stronger relationship, marry me, will you?"
Steve carried Natasha back to the bed and circled her tightly in his arms, reaching down to poke the little hole again, "Hold it, don't let it run out, don't waste a drop, there'll be a little baby in here soon."
Scott came back from the quantum realm and Tony built the device. Every day since then, in his dreams, he has noticed that his time travel device has a symbol of reactors that no one else has. But he still watched the reactor go out.
A strange sensation swept through Steve's mind and a thought kept him from deliberately thrusting the babe beneath him until he cried out as she usually did. He got up and carried Natasha back to bed and quickly rolled over and went out to get some things and returned.
The girl stared into the man's gentle eyes as her hand slowly explored beneath herself, even though Steve's half-lying view wasn't great, his quadruple vision still allowed him to clearly see that the small slit had awakened again, opening and closing as if to tempt him. His somewhat dumbfounded look finally pleased Natasha, and she reached down and grabbed the big guy, jerking it slowly a few times before aligning it with her not-quite-closed hole and slowly sitting down.
Natasha watched with satisfaction as Steve's face brushed red and added, "Steve, I miss you, I miss you so much, and is there anything more you should be doing at this time than satisfying me and making me feel good?"
One day she was wandering around the building when she happened to come across a female agent in a corner of the penthouse who was stopping Steve, showing off her figure while trying to wrap herself around Steve like a water snake, "Captain, there are a few things I'm not quite sure about regarding tomorrow's combat mission, would you like to come to my bedroom and give me some guidance? "
Even though he hadn't thought about this whole thing about the two of them, Tony wasn't going to reject him outright at this time when he was showing his vulnerability, "You know I can't look you in the eye and say no, but I haven't decided to say yes either, just give me a little more time."
After a month or so of night and day, Natasha received news of a major development with Bruce and was so happy that she hummed a song all the way back to her room from the studio. As soon as she entered the door she was wrapped in a pair of arms, "Why are you back so early today?" Natasha asked as she silently lamented that her plans to take a break from Steve's absence had been foiled.
"Looks like I was right?" The girl's pained voice instead made the man even more brutal as he heaved in and out quickly, feeling the frantic sucking deep inside her finally soothed pussy, "Does he know you'll suck me like that in bed? Does he know that you open your legs to be fucked by me like this every day? I wish I could record you right now and show him."
There were things he didn't want to say or couldn't say in the real world, saying them would only add to Tony's burden, but at the moment in the dream he could perhaps follow his heart for once. After all, Dr. Strange had only said that he couldn't tell anyone in reality, but he hadn't said that he couldn't in the dream. "It's important, I only told Morgan I love her today, but I haven't told you I love you."
He opened one of the first texts and seemed to see the one-eyed cranky Fury ranting at him, "Explain to me what the hell is going on here!" The accompanying picture was a screenshot of a Twitter where the girl wrote nothing but posted a picture of the two at the amusement park, Steve turning his head as if to kiss Toni on the cheek, while Toni had lustful dislike written all over her face and pleasure in her eyes.
Against Natasha's thoughts, the man in front of her spoke, "Excuse me, you should still want this, but I think it might be broken."
"If you don't mind, I thought I'd walk you around until you find one. My name is S......Grant," he then sincerely extended his hand.
Grant's voice seemed magical and she didn't really seem to be in such a hurry to get back to New York to upgrade her armour. Natasha had grown up working with machinery and had no knowledge of art, except for people who wanted to get investment from her and talked about how masterful their work was. This was the first time she had become interested in art.
"Well, that sucks," Grant's expression didn't show that it sucked, "we have no money, no phones, oh no, just a broken and a dead phone, and no plan."
Natasha beamed, not quite achieving her goal, but at least much better than expected, still her mouth refused to let up, "Am I to blame? You're the one who put my head on the wall..."
She picked up the hotel service comment card on the bedside table, "Thank you for staying with us, please help us improve our service. Idle enough to fill it out?"
Pepper brought her to Boston for a holiday after she had spent sleepless hours in the lab upgrading her armour for she couldn't remember how many times. She was worried more about her mental state than her physical health. Natasha responded by fiddling with her electronic screen in the midst of the various leisure activities Pepper had arranged, and also by talking back to her before Pepper's anger reached its breaking point. The result was that Pepper confiscated her armour case in a fit of anger and forced Jarvis offline, leaving her with only a mobile phone and enough change to buy a ticket back to New York, and flying back to New York herself first.
Steve was in a bit of a trance, the girl beneath him was his only love, the mother of his child, the angel who had fallen to earth to be occupied by him, and at the moment that innocent little face was pampering him with a soft, sticky voice that made him want to love for the rest of his life. "Do it again one more time, that time earlier when you clamped down on me too tightly and it was too short, doesn't count."
It was as if Steve could feel every part on his long, thick dick branding his mark in the girl's body, and he would never be separated from her again. Natasha's long hair was loose and she hadn't even taken the time to tuck it behind her ears, and she was flushed with lust all over her body, giving him the illusion that she was really a siren come to seduce him. The self-control he had always prided himself was totally lost, almost driving him to pin the girl beneath him so that her legs wrapped around his waist and she would watch how he broke her with his cock so that she would be forever teary-eyed and moaning seductively because of him.
The battle was as arduous as ever and it wasn't until late afternoon that the day's exertions were over for the avengers. Watching Iron Woman rampage as if she cares nothing about her own life, Steve felt a little more of a different emotion than his former fear for the lives of his teammates.
Toni slumped at her desk and her voice was muffled, "If I get hurt by Pepper's heels because wondering where to go tomorrow in a meeting , I'll tell her it was your idea. Go go go, and remember to come back and rescue me for dinner."
Although he had agreed not to go into the water, Steve was coerced by Toni into changing into his swimsuit, and in the girl's words, "You can't just look at me without me looking at you." So he was wearing only a pair of swimming trunks as he set up the oven under the sun umbrella.
"Actually, we've broken up!" Steve blurted out, Tony froze and nodded, "Yes! They've broken up and we're the two true lovers!"
It was almost Christmas time, the weather was already cold and almost every shop on the far side of the street had a Christmas tree, a festive atmosphere that delighted everyone but Natasha. She didn't love Christmas, perhaps because she had lost something on Christmas Eve one year, and Natasha tightened her coat and pondered the feasibility of catching a taxi by showing her identity now.
He noticed that one of Toni's hands had started rubbing the corner of her shirt again, a small gesture she only did when she was nervous, "You, don't get me wrong, we can still be good teammates can't we? I've got nothing improper to do to you......"
After kissing her for a while, the man withdrew from her body and lazily squeezed all over her body. As she watched his hand wiggle twice and go back towards that little slit, the girl hugged his arm and pouted, "It hurts, it really hurts, look it's all swollen, let's not do it, okay, I'll make it up to you using somewhere else, I can use my mouth and suck it out for you, as many times as you want, okay?"
A few loud slaps landed on the softness of her breasts, "Want to know how I found out? It's funny, I had prepared a surprise to hide this ring for you to find, but I didn't expect you to give me such a big surprise first." With that, he retrieved a ring from the pocket of his shirt and slipped it onto her hand without a word.
Steve came back with the building's medicine stuff and spoke with deliberation as he medicated Toni, "You can't put all the blame in the world on yourself, be kind to yourself so you have the energy to do more for everyone, isn't it?"
Steve looked at Natasha, who had just fallen through a wormhole and come back from the dead, awakened by Hulk's roar, and felt his stopped heart slowly begin to regain consciousness.
The following day Phanie was up unprecedentedly late. She lay in bed remembering the wonderful night she had just spent, when she had become friends with young Butler Jarvis, whom she had met for the first time, and the two of them had sparred in the moonlight, before he had taken Phanie to steal a shield from the Prince's arsenal after saying that Fanny was better suited to protecting others with a shield than attacking with a sword. He has such beautiful eyes ......
Tony hadn't expected this, he was just trying to be cheeky, he hadn't anticipated that Phanie wouldn't use her strength. Tony opened his eyes and her face stopped right in front of him.
As soon as Red Skull saw the presence of Iron Woman at the base, he immediately realised that she was here to take Captain America. He quickly took the self-destruct device from his pocket and was about to press it, when Natasha's firepower quickly followed, destroying the device with one hand with her palm cannon, and aiming several shots at Red Skull's head with the other, sending him to the ground. Behind her, Steve reacted as quickly as she did and his shield flew out in the direction of Iron Woman. Natasha didn't dare risk Steve's life, she saw the device destroyed before she could dodge it and was hit in the side of the waist by the shield, landing on the ground from mid-air.
"Your body is honest enough to suck really tight," he was in a good mood at the moment, not bothering that Natasha never opened her eyes to look at him, just giving her another peck on her already swollen lips, "you're so beautiful now baby, it's about time you open your eyes and take a good look at how  I am gonna fuck you." With that, he stripped himself naked and took Natasha's back and sat her up, patting her face to show her how hard he was.
"Okay, okay ......" Consider me doing a good deed. "So Miss Stark, what are the specifics of this film contract?"
"If it was you, you wouldn't be so sad, you'd just say 'It's Captain America's responsibility!' Then darling, you know that if this is my destiny, then this is Iron Man's responsibility."
Toni shook her head but replied something else, "It would have been better if it had been winter, that might have been a good way to end this, it can be a way we get our hair white together."
Steve vetoed Natasha and Clint's plan to go to Vormir to get the Mind Stone at the time heist meeting, and the battle in the dream was henceforth with Natasha. But he still watched the reactor go out.
Within a few moments Natasha felt her whole body sink and asked casually, "I'm so tired, why haven't you come yet?"
Well here's a hint from the plot I should know who you are. "Miss Stark. yes, no one in New York doesn't know you. It would be an honor to get an autograph request from Miss Stark."
They passed by several hotels during this time, but their enquiries resulted in either no rooms or doubts about the value of the watch.
Toni knew when a wink would make her look churlish, so she put on that innocent look that no one but Pepper could resist and whispered, "I'd like to see it."
Steve took her left nipple and sucked it hard, while cupping his hands around her right breast and rubbing it hard, and Natasha heard the man on her chest whispering something indistinctly in between the sucking and nibbling.
She had asked Yinsen if she had seen the name during the surgery when she was in the cave, and Yinsen said that the initials of two words had just surfaced on the skin before the surgery, S-R.
After a few hard jabs with two fingers, Steve felt the girl's struggle seem to lessen and was eager to squeeze in a third finger. The girl he was holding tightly down never opened her eyes, but her fluttering eyelashes betrayed her nervousness. Steve sniggered and after a few vigorous thrusts, he quickly withdrew his fingers and wiped the shiny water stain from his hand all over the girl's face.
Satisfied, Steve deliberately rocked the bed to a creaking halt, and the slowest person on the other end of the line could realize what the people on this side of the phone were doing. "If you haven't ...... discussed it well yet, then I'll leave you two alone for now."
"There is now." Steve slowed slightly to try and grab the girl's hand to get her to wrap around him, but Toni was fighting him and generally refused to settle down.
Natasha wandered aimlessly through the late-night streets, and by the time she looked back again, she noticed that there were no street lights on the road, only a few youths who had drunk too much to vent their anger on a bin. She clenched her fists and mentally calculated the chances of leaving her armour and relying only on her recently trained fighting skills to swing these men without scratching her face if they launched themselves at her in a frenzy.
"This is ......" Steve's breath caught as Dr. Strange's voice appeared in his ears, "It was the only chance, the only victory, but at a price you saw. "
"I want you to stay, to be by my side. A chaperone, a bodyguard, a minder, whatever. Phanie, I'm sure you can do either well."
Whether Grant was the right man Natasha wouldn't know anymore, but there was no doubt they had met at the wrong time. "Well, I know." Natasha didn't persist in the conversation and again jumped in thought, "You said you were an amateur painter in addition to being a soldier, paint a picture for me."
After getting the result he wanted, Steve stopped forcing Natasha to stay in her room during the day, and the girl would go to the studio in the morning after she'd had enough sleep to continue her destructive work. Steve's constant stubbornness to occupy her disappeared and was replaced by his occasional giggle as he stared into the girl's soulful eyes, in which Natasha felt more and more like her innocent fiancé.
Tony's expression softened for a moment, his hand resting on his head which was buried in his chest, "So it's just not turning out well?"
There were already a lot of people with the same name, and even more people with the same initials. No matter. She hadn't expected to find that person anyway. It was questionable whether she would even survive.
Later, the kindly old man told Phanie that he was a housekeeper in the Prince's house and that his last name was Jarvis. It was he who found her collapsed by the creek covered in wounds and took her back. It was only when the maids changed her clothes that they discovered that the lad the butler had picked up was in fact not a lad but a girl. It was only from a half-broken wooden sign she carried close to her that everyone discovered the name Phanie.
Toni snapped back from her delirious wanderings waiting for the two to discuss, "Oh, there's no script, you play it out, I only have one request. Just pretend you love me. For a week, never be out of character, pretend you love me with all your heart."
Grant moved for a moment to regain his senses and then pushed her away slightly, "Can I ask you the name of your soul mate?"
The man said these harsh words, but his tone was soft as if he was whispering love, "Resign yourself to the fact that Toni, from the moment I saw you, you were mine." With that he repositioned the girl in a kneeling position in front of the one-sided glass window and pushed himself hard into her in response to the bustle of people outside.
Natasha stubbornly shook her head, a shake that caused her otherwise well-held teeth to knock into Steve's penis, which caused him to freeze and a massive spurt of cum, choking the girl and causing her to quickly retreat, she coughed as his fluids spurted all over her face.
Steve lifted himself up and quickly squeezed between the girl's legs and pushed two fingers into the hidden slit without mercy. The slippery warmth of the touch seemed to satisfy him. To Natasha, his not so gentle or patient movements caused her long-overdue pain, and she twisted her body twice, only to have his other free hand pinched around her waist and pushed her to him.
Then, by the time she understood how this trip would change her life, she had lost that skin on her chest.
Toni cocked her head, "Enjoying Toni Stark's swimsuit show all by yourself? At least you have to show some reward for me."
By the time he was able to come in and out smoothly with four fingers, Natasha was so desperate that she was saying something she couldn't think about, "Get in here, come straight away!" Seeing that Steve was still looking at her like a fragile object, the girl deliberately provoked him, "Are you able to do this, Uncle Steve?"
Only then did he look up at the girl's face, not expecting her to still be so gentle with him at the moment, after he had deliberately avoided looking directly at her expression for fear of seeing hate appear on that face, for fear that it was really as the man had said, Toni had never loved him, only hate and fear. He finally relaxed, "Yeah, I was jealous, I was afraid you would really run off with him, maybe I should have locked you in the house, tied you to the bed, not let you go out, not given you clothes to wear, just gagged you and let me fuck you for the rest of your life so you could never run off and never get away from my cock."
Steve then tightened his grip on the girl's hand again and dropped a kiss on the back of her hand, "You know, you can hold my hand even when you're not on a rollercoaster, right? Let's hold hands and go do something else, shall we?"
Steve had heard Pepper say that Toni had a heart surgery before, so he would make sure she didn't drink too much coffee or stay up too late. And late at night, when she was haunted by nightmares, she would dial Steve's phone. He would listen to her nightmares and anxieties on the other end of the line until she finally fell asleep to the sound of his song. On her evenings off, Steve would take her through the streets in search of the delicious snacks that only the locals knew. Toni, on the other hand, recommended Steve to a director who coordinated with her in his new series of films before Steve knew it.
Having just cleared out the remnants of Hydra, Natasha Stark, Iron Woman, stowed her nano-armour in the reactor on her chest and set out to find her fiancé, ready to tell him that today she had not been reckless at all, but had struck out exactly as Captain America had planned. Perhaps after asking him for a kiss, she could immediately fly back to the building with Steve for a hot post-battle sex.
It was just getting dark when Steve came to visit Natasha, and it was already a little late in the evening when he took her back to bed. Natasha looked at his sleeping look, slightly dazed by the fact that Steve was not wearing his daytime Hydra uniform - nothing at all, to be precise - and his eyes were closed, no different from when he had slept next to her. It was as if he would wake up next time as her soft-eyed Captain America.
Toni laughed, "Why do you want to ask that question? Let I think about it, I'm sure I'll be even less tolerable when I get older, but because I'm a genius, they have to count on me. I'll lock myself up in my studio working on my inventions, like one of those science nuts in a science fiction movie. When I die, no one will miss me, but my technology is still a hundred years ahead of the world."
Tony opened his eyes to look at him and closed them again, "I don't see how important it is. Go to sleep old man, I love you too."
Steve's top was tossed aside, his trousers were down to his knees, Natasha's panties were hanging around her ankles, and her underwear was missing. Steve kneaded Natasha's buttocks while holding them there and guiding her to sit on top of him, before the man switched to holding her waist and supporting her up and down.
Natasha was still working on staring at the ceiling when Steve pushed his way through the door. She noticed that Steve had come alone today and had closed the door behind him. She sat up with her arms covered, "Captain." Yeah." Steve answered briefly and then began to question her about the progress of Hydra's latest weapon.
But she didn't see Steve's impishly upturned mouth as he nodded his consent to carry her to the bathroom, and it was only when she was pinned against the wall in the bathroom that she realised that Steve's usual fourfold self-control had saved her so much suffering, and now she was faced with his unrestrained fourfold desire.
But Jarvis showed a disapproving face, "I heard that it was the General who had returned and brought back evidence that Obi had conspired to usurp the throne, and His Majesty is having a fit of rage. Although I understand in my heart how much you think of Miss Phanie, but you may not be able to wait here, so it is better for you to ...... do something important, Your Highness."
Natasha looked into those shy blue eyes, gave a somewhat winning smile and leaned down, licking the long erect dick slowly, sucking the twin balls and then inching along the shaft to the top, occasionally stimulating him as if she were trying to burrow her deft little tongue into the tiny hole at the tip.
The schedule for the film was generous and one of the main reasons Toni chose the film was because of the relaxing working hours. Four years ago long periods of drinking and sleepless nights had kept her heart a little overloaded and she had to have an operation and go through a long period of recuperation. After agreeing with Pepper, they chose this relaxing romantic comedy as a small transition before her official career comeback.
He noticed that Toni seemed a little nervous, the hand not holding the coffee cup cupped and rubbed around the corner of her shirt, "Oh, what are you going to say to me?"
After a moment's froth at the thought of making a move, the Prince rose and dropped a kiss on her forehead. Phanie was a little dumbfounded and hurriedly tried to get up, her voice as thin as a mosquito, "It's time for you to get up, Your Highness."
As everything went as Loki had expected, the scepter manipulated them all to reveal their hidden grievances to each other.
One day, Phanie finished washing her clothes and practised her sword in the backyard. Although her memory was gone, her body instincts did not disappear so easily.  She had a keen sense of someone peeping from the shadows, and with a turn, the tip of her sword stopped in front of the man's neck, "Who are you? Why are you sneaking around the Prince's residence in the middle of the night?"
Toni was distracted as always at the post-war meeting. Steve stared at the bruises on her face, Toni was uncomfortable with his stare but didn't want to ask him directly, so she asked with a sarcastic, "Why? Is Captain America not happy with me slipping up again? It's not that I don't want to listen to this boring presentation, it's just that my new boyfriend is so physically active these days that I'm a bit low on energy."
Natasha's days of anxiety end with the visit of her period in a few days, and she is relieved to start playing the role of the favoured little agent, surreptitiously sabotaging Hydra's technical areas by day and delivering a blood sample every few days at Bruce's request by night. She also learns that the Red Skull rarely actually sends Steve into battle and that he still shows some resistance to killing, so the Red Skull is more interested in getting some secrets from deep within Captain America's consciousness that can also be used as his greatest leverage to fight the Avengers. This gives Natasha and Bruce a lot of confidence that the Captain's original will has not been broken, but is hiding somewhere waiting for them to come and bring him home. Everything is going well, except perhaps for Steve's never-ending nightly antics which are a little too much for her.
The first thing she did was not to take it, thinking that she seemed to believe the man's words so easily when looking into his eyes, "Phanie does not deserve this appreciation. Only I really didn't know that this sword was a gift from the Prince, so please take it back."
Out of the thirty actors, Toni spotted Steve at once. she held out her hand, "Stark Industries has a film deal, I wonder if this ......"
Maybe he could make an exception for the night and cum on her chest, Steve thought as he pulled himself away from her by the hair on the back of her head, before Natasha was once again lowered to the floor with her back to Steve behind her. "So wet after only a few licks," the man whispered in her ear, patting her ass again nastily, satisfied with the temptation of that pussy opening contracting sharply before pushing his desire slowly and firmly into her tight, wet deepest part, "How is it that I've fucked you so many times and you're still so tight?"
Natasha closed her eyes and refused to look at him or make another sound, driving him crazy with jealousy, as Steve uncuffed her and picked her up from behind in the connected position. The girl was now firmly enclosed in his arms, her legs held by each of his arms, and almost all that remained of her body was supported by their tightly connected bodies.
"Morgan waited for you all night and still couldn't hold it together to fall asleep first." Tony turned back his head and continued to write and draw on the virtual screen.
Natasha felt like she was being dragged into a sea of desire, her consciousness was not quite clear, every sensitive point of her body was occupied by the man, and as he said, he was the only one she could see.
Natasha cut him off, "I love him, of course I love him, I'll accept whatever he wants to do to me, besides it was just a little fling, go and forget about today." Still turning to the girl's departing back, the man added, "Come with me, I will cherish you and we can escape to where Hydra cannot find us!"
Steve pushed down the unease mind and took a deep breath, "Can you not tell Toni about this yet? I'll talk to her about it after this is over. You wouldn't want her to miss anything, would you?"
"Can you take me on the Ferris wheel? At least you can see the view from up high, just spare me as an old man who's afraid to ride roller coasters, okay?" Steve immediately changed his expression like an innocent puppy, which defeated Toni, but bargained as if she was losing out, "I'll reluctantly agree with that, but I'll have a cone, no, two of them."
But this was not the worst of it for Natasha. All she did was talk to a male colleague during the day, and Steve was jealous that he could understand Natasha's astronomical techno-jargon, and that he couldn't get his girl to give him that bright-eyed look. Steve was so possessive that he pinned her down in a warehouse near the man's dormitory at night and took her roughly from behind, pulling her hands behind her back while riding her like a horse to force her to cry out, "Why aren't you so happy when you're talking to me, huh?"
"Nat, I can't stand by and watch you push yourself to the dead end every day anymore, you're going to crush yourself sooner or later. Stop working on your armour! Or, at least, just take a little more time for yourself, okay? Calm yourself down, I'll be waiting for you back in New York, or you can call me when you're ready and I'll come and get you. You know, I'm always there."
Steve had a hard look at Ironman once again who lowered face armor and began the final struggle, "Actually we are in an open relationship ......Thor, you may not know, but this kind of relationship in the Midgard is...... "
"No, open yourself," the man switched sides and continued to nibble delicately, "Think about what I taught you?"
She thought again of her intentions when Steve had asked her to marry him, to start preparing for a new life once they were registered and married, but now was definitely not a good time, and while she had vowed to bring Steve home, she was also prepared to meet him six feet under after pulling out the hydra if Steve didn't survive it. She couldn't have been prepared for that in this situation.
The similarity to the old but different scene made Natasha miss gentle Steve even more as she turned her head away from him and refused to look into those red eyes, but the tears fell onto the pillow and disappeared.
"Fuck you old capsicle, if you dare to say a word about leaving me! Do you not want me anymore!" Natasha finally stifled her tears, "You big fool, I just begged Bruce not to let you remember that because I was afraid, I know you'd feel guilty and sad and think about leaving. Look at me!" She reached up to wipe the tears from the corner of Steve's eyes and forced him to look straight at herself, "You never hurt me, I love you Steve, you came back, I did, I brought you home, nothing could be more important than that, and if there's any compensation, it's that you never leave me again."
Tony seemed a little surprised at his moves, wondering why the big man was acting like a depresses kid at school today, "I wasn't waiting for you, night time is when geniuses work."
Natasha remained silent the whole way, just letting Steve lead her back to the bedroom and being held between his arms and the bedroom door, the man took her breath away with one long kiss.
Even though Steve had already gently opened it for her, she winced twice when she tried to take it all in at this angle. The man tried to sit up and soothe the pain, but the girl just grabbed his hand and put it on her chest, squeezed it to show him to take care of the breasts, and stopped him from taking his hand off to hold it on her waist and back, and in this position, she galloped on him.
Knowing he shouldn't have picked this time to go in, Steve took a few steps back as a thought flashed through his mind that he couldn't catch.Pepper left some time later before Steve went to knock on Toni's door. The girl's eyes were a little red, but she smiled again when she saw him, "I blame you for making me distracted and get taught a lesson by Pepper with the heel of her shoes, it hurt so much I had tears in my eyes."
The man walked steadily around the room twice with the disorientated girl in his arms, easing his grip on the girl's legs a little with each step so that his hard, thick desire could poke deeper into her body as she dropped helplessly.
"You can ask Jarvis, my AI butler, any questions you have, just don't remind me it's all fake. See you tomorrow Mr. Evans," Toni waved this off and hurried off.
Tony was impatient to hear that, his father was clearly asking the General for a reward, but how could the General be saying he was guilty. When was he going to be released to go back to his Phanie anyway?
By the second lap of the wheel, all the cone in Toni's hand had gone into her stomach, and the other cone, which was aptly named "reluctantly given to Steve", was only half eaten, as Toni turned her head to look at the view, "Next time you go on a Ferris wheel, you should bring a girl you like. "
As she watched the last train back to New York leave, Natasha muttered a series of No's followed by a few unintelligible curses. She walked back the way she had come, distracted by Pepper's voice in her head, reminding her of how the CEO of SI had ended up in this situation.
He learned that the most prominent building in New York was the Stark Tower, owned by Howard's daughter Natasha Stark, the unearthly genius who had appeared only as Iron Women these years. He looked at the pictures of the gold and red armour on the news, remembering his time with Bucky, with Peggy, with Howard, all those times he couldn't go back to, and closed his phone after a moment's wandering.
Steve saw the girl move for a while and then seemed to run out of strength, so he shook his head, "Nat aren't you tired? Why don't you let me do it instead?" Natasha hit him on the hand, "It's all because of your son!" She did feel a little weak in the legs and just had to slow down. But she didn't make it easy for Steve to take back her long-lost dominance either, instead, she contracted her soft hole as if her whole body was clinging to Steve's big dick.
The woman on the other end of the line seemed to have a lot of questions, her voice hesitating for a moment before she asked again, "Captain?"
And yes. I love you. Only you. Only the you I love now has a demon living inside of it. The girl mourned, her tear-stained eyes looking up at Steve with a complexity that the man could not read.
She reached up to turn on the light and found her dearest husband lying on the bed, dressed only in a shirt and tie that was more tempting than naked, the hem just covering the big cock that has stood up between his legs, and somehow handcuffing himself to the bed.
"Is that so? That's a coincidence, I'm N-S," Natasha said, still staring at the ceiling, her tone not audibly wavering.
Tony didn't know when he had started to think differently about her, but never realised that she was beautiful too. When he had gone out with him, she had been a handsome girl dressed as a man, and when he had first seen her in the backyard, she had been unadorned and heroic. He had always thought Phanie was just Phanie, different from the various ladies he had seen before and the maids who had tried to seduce him, but the first time he got so close to her he realised that she was more beautiful than all of them.
Butler Jarvis seemed to have a strong bond with the Prince and was able to joke about it, "Your Highness, you returned last night, and as soon as you came back, you went off to spar with someone to learn martial arts, and it also coincided with the theft of the House's armoury, so I didn't have time to report it to you."
Steve struggled twice before losing all his strength and Natasha was unable to support him as they both fell to the ground together, Natasha smiled the happiest smile she had in months, she had done it and she would soon be able to bring Steve home. Iron Woman rearranged her armour and picked up Steve's shield, not forgetting to add a few more shots to Red Skull's head as she instructed Jarvis to activate all the sabotage procedures she had done in recent days at the Hydra base and told Clint they could come in and wrap it up, while she took Steve and flew back to the building in a matter of moments.
Grant smiled and shook his head, not picking up the microphone again. Instinct told Natasha that there was something else he should have left unsaid to his longer ago self, but this elusive feeling kept her from asking. So the two fell silent until they walked to the door of the next hotel.
Her thoughts turned once again to the goodness of the man in front of her, her mind wandering before she finally gave up thinking. She tugged on the man's collar and kissed him, letting him fall on top of her. She left it up to him to decide what would happen next, or to fate.
The girl was so exhausted from the crazy night that Steve had planned not to bathe her, to make sure she remembered the lesson. The scene that Natasha was covered in his fluids took his breath away and he pinned her against the bathroom wall without thinking. Natasha's legs seemed too weak to stand, so he lifted one of them over his shoulder so that she could only cling to him, and then slowly entered her.
The AI seemed to take a long time to judge, and it was only moments before Steve stepped out of the building that he heard Jarvis reply, "Judging by the information available, this does not pose a security threat. I wouldn't have brought it up voluntarily if Madam hadn't asked about it. A pending view of the matter from Madam has been withdrawn."
"Call me Tony. You know there are many times when identity is more of a straitjacket for me, and I really do like you, Phanie, and I'd prefer you to know me as a living, breathing person, someone who would enjoy drinking with you and breaking into the arsenal with swords, rather than as that golden symbol on the seat."
The first man she saw when she woke up asked her kindly what her name was and where she was going and how she had been injured so much, only to find that she could not remember the answers to any of these questions.
Maybe Pepper's words finally paid off, or maybe it was just her stopping torturing herself. 24-year-old Toni did start accepting dates with people who were good to her, but none of them lasted. "Maybe you weren't lying when you said you liked me, but you really don't love me, and there's a hole in your heart that I can't fill." At her assistant Vision's wedding, Toni smiled and exchanged pleasantries with those around her, all she could think about were the words of her recently departed boyfriend.
Everything was slowly back into place, except for Steve who was alone in his dreams every night, searching for that tiny hope.
He looked into Toni's bright eyes and took her into his arms, repeating over and over in her ear, "It's true, it's all going to be true, everything you want is going to be true."
When he returned from washing his hands, Toni was leaning on the only beach chair and winking at him. He took the sunscreen with a red face, but his hands moved with the pure emotion like a doctor examining a patient's body without distraction. With her eyes closed and enjoying herself, she noticed the palms roaming her body stop moving and heard the big man stammer, "Okay Toni......" she opened her eyes and stomped one foot on the man's bare chest and mischievously poked his chest with her toes, "You need to wipe on my feet too."
The man smiled, "No need, I've just finished a very long holiday and I'm leaving here tomorrow, so maybe I'll be living out of my home again for the rest of my life, so you don't have to think about paying it back."
He licked the girl's ear for a moment, then straightened up and, without warning, pulled out the big dick that had been stirring wildly the moment before, and there was a crunching sound where they had connected, and the small opening hole was still shrinking and leaking white fluid before it could close. The man looked at the girl's flushed face and took two steps forward, shooting all the desire he had not released into her body earlier onto her delicate face.
Steve rose slightly and stretched out his arm to reach for the glass of milk on the small table next to the bed, which had been prepared for the wounded girl in the bed, who did not like milk, so there was still most of it left, and Steve lifted his hand and poured it over Natasha's body.
Toni, who had been in Steve's arms, put on her armour and broke out of the window the next second she received the news. Immediately after Toni leaves, Steve's communicator goes off as well. As he waited anxiously for the building's lift, he suddenly noticed that Jarvis, who would normally be reporting the lift's location at this time, was surprisingly quiet.
The man reached down and smeared the fluid away from the girl's face, lifted her chin and scraped some more from her chest into her mouth forcing her to swallow. "Baby, ah Toni, you don't know how beautiful you are now, you're mine and I'm the only one who can see you like this." Natasha managed to calm down to catch her breath, she reached out a hand over her eyes, tears running down her arm as she said in a muffled voice, "There's no one else, you're all I have Steve, you can't do this to me, you'll regret it." The man who had let go of the first half of the sentence was stung again by the second half, "Regret? No, I don't get it, I won't regret it," he said, gesturing down in the direction of his lower body again, "It's best if there aren't any other men, baby, it doesn't matter if there are, sooner or later I'll fuck them out of your head, every hole in your body is mine to fuck as much as I want, every part of you I'm the only man for you. If you don't serve me well today, I'm going to lock you in the house without clothes and make you open your legs for me at all times. Now, lick me clean."
Steve's mouth went dry as he remembered yesterday - the yesterday he remembered, when, in the excitement of a lifelong commitment to his beloved, they had both made it all the way from the bed to the bathroom, the seductive image of the girl lying in bed, all flushed red, and now she's seducing him like he remembered, and he heard himself say dryly "Then you must tell me if you are uncomfortable."
Steve has moved a lot of his less important work to the bedroom in order to reach his goal as quickly as possible. So he was always in his room reading battle plans while he was rubbing the girl's wonderfully handy breasts, which usually ended up in a daytime lusting session.
Steve contacted Danvers in advance so that she could return to Earth as quickly as possible. Every day since then, Danvers has appeared in advance on the battlefield in his dreams. But he still watched the reactor go out.
Noticing Steve's occasional glances back in attention, Toni waved a hand in the direction of the three. "Just regard the wasted time as a price of growing old together."
Before Clint could question the two men, they disappeared in front of him, leaving him with the snack scattered all over the floor.
Steve held the handles of her chair with both hands and slowly knelt down to look her in the eyes, "Be my girlfriend, Toni, will you?"
Steve put his mind at ease and went to the kitchen to bring back some honey water and slipped it into her hand, "I love you for real, and so does the honey water, take a sip."
"I thought obscure little singers like me didn't have fans, so my only fan, care to join me for a bite to eat?" Steve mentally breathed a long sigh of relief, okay I caught that line.
Toni turned back to continue staring at the shield, "But I don't have anything I want to hear, go to SI and find Pepper if you want the check."
Bruce took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes again, putting them back on before speaking slowly, "It's tricky, according to the intel that just came through from S.H.I.E.L.D., this is supposed to be the new brainwashing technique that Red Skull has perfected ...... Forcibly retrieving Cap ......" Bruce scratched his hair again, seeming reluctant to use that word, "Forcibly retrieving Cap and then counter-brainwashing doesn't seem feasible for the time being, it will take a while to crack the technology and that time will give the Red Skull the opportunity to activate the self-destruct program and then everything will be irreparable."
Steve waited backstage for Toni to arrive to kick off their week-long deal, and Jarvis set up their first encounter as a barroom singer and fan. He was convinced that  a deliberately understated Toni Stark herself was in the young girls crazy for him off the stage as he played the guitar and sang love songs under the name Steve Evans
She quickly put on another smirk, "Then the director announces that we're done for the day and this bed scene is unseen for the audience!" And then, without a word, she burrowed into Steve's arms and stopped moving as if she were really asleep. Steve, who had wanted to get up and find a place to spend the night, was stuck in bed, and kissed the girl's forehead sweetly, "Toni, good night."
Day after day, Iron Woman still hasn't found a good solution, but increasingly she feels like a gangster's canary, waiting for the man's patronage day after day.
The girl had mixed feelings at this point, first relieved that it was only the pill and not a communicator or something that had been found, then immediately nervous at the grim look on the face of the man who was now towering over her. She had prided herself on knowing Steve when she had convinced her good teammates to agree to her coming undercover, and she thought she had caught his new temperament over time, but at this point she really didn't know what kind of reaction she was going to face from him.
Steve said it lightly, but Toni could hear his sadness and was trying to think of a way to revive the mood, "I'm only five years younger than you ......" only to be interrupted by Steve's voice, "Look, we're at the top."
Her fiancé is still as good a soilder as he was before the brainwashing, and every day he fucks her over and over with her belly bulging. Steve in particular loving to threaten the girl to obey him while expecting a new life to be born. At night, the man is keen to keep his cock deep inside the girl overnight, not only to ensure that the fluids are fully utilised, but also so that he can wake her up the next day with a morning loving session and a new day of hard work.
Again Tony couldn't stop his smile, "What kind of woman? Not to mention the fact that eight out of ten of my affairs were made up by ladies who had to ruin their reputations to become the Princess, and even if I had liked women like that, I left them all behind the moment I met you! If you're worried that I'm not serious about any of this, then I don't mind saving this," Tony lowered his head and buried it in Phanie's chest and took a deep breath, "for the wedding night."
When he was finished he didn't show it to Natasha, but hung it back on the wall, "I just don't think it gives you the right look." Natasha didn't reach for it, thinking that it would be mine tomorrow anyway.
"It's all bed scenes. With Captain America out of the house, I have a whole load of tricks I can come through with you in our house."
Natasha thought wistfully about the power of brainwashing, to not only turn Captain America into Captain Hydra, but also to make her fiancé, who at first blushed at the kiss, do such things so boldly, while holding Steve's head, but not pushing him away.
He used to cherish her and rarely let her suck him off during the girl's fancy sex games. The only time he was ever deep-throated was when Iron Woman came back from a battlefield rampage and bruised herself, and Steve medicated and bandaged her and took her to the shower but wouldn't even talk to her. The girl crouched under the shower and took him deep, the man's resistance crushed her and she sat down on the bathroom floor and sobbed, "You won't talk to me this time, will you refuse to take me next time? I don't know how to keep you, maybe I'm not bad in bed with only these unimpressive skills, but you probably don't like them either."
Another month of diligent sowing of seeds passed and one day Steve enjoyed the last of the girl's services before he left for the morning meeting, admiring the sight of his cock being swallowed and licked from the head to the root, the contrast of colours giving him great satisfaction, the girl barely covered by a shirt, her breasts visible and her long hair falling around her ears making him want to dirty her badly.
Another decade, Steve and Toni were on a reality show, the camera showed Steve holding two ice creams, one handed to his eldest son Peter and one to his youngest daughter Morgan, behind the camera Toni was chatting to another guest on the show, Natasha.
Steve's mind wandered, "You said you were going to make it up to me in other ways." Natasha just assumed that by other ways he meant to work her mouth sore for a while, and the man just jerked away slightly, reaching over to the bed and grabbing his phone.
After a few moments the pain quickly receded and his mind failed to catch the flash of memory that had just occurred, he came to his senses and was met with the girl's undisguised concern.
The man remained at the door before he dared to leave without permission, blushing as he listened to the whole thing, Natasha's shoulders deliberately exposed by the man covered in red marks and teeth marks, and some wet white marks on her face and hair. Satisfied and relieved, Steve leaves with a light "you'll be transferred to Europe from tomorrow" and carries the girl away.
During the final round of battlefield patrols, Thor caught a sharp-eyed glimpse of Iron man lifting his face armour and was kissing the captain.
He pushed deliberately hard against her, taking a long time to withdraw the mass of fabric, accompanied by the girl's sobs, before the man, as if in mercy, shot all his essence into the already red and swollen slit.
Only after Natasha had recovered from her oxygen deprivation and the shock of "how brainwashing could make my shy fiancé so bold" did she realise that her blouse had been thrown under the bed, her bra was fully unbuttoned and his golden, hairy head was now on her breasts, nibbling at them in an uncontrolled manner.
Steve was so aroused by her that he didn't know where to put his hands, and Natasha wouldn't stop there, she took a mouthful of the big guy's thick head and desperately pushed the thing down her throat.
The moans and sobs, and the sound of his palms on the girl's body, drifted out of the window, asserting her ownership for him.
Steve seemed to be in a good mood and kissed her before giving the girl a resounding kiss on the cheek, "What did you hear?"
The man took a mouthful of the girl's quivering nipple tip and said vaguely, "This is punishment Toni, punishment for your refusal to trust me, I'm giving you a chance to reconsider, what should you say?"
"Don't be in such a hurry to hang up, I think my discussion with Agent 7 has almost come to a conclusion." Another heavy thrust mixed with some inaudible pouting and low laughter, "You don't have to go out on tomorrow's mission, from now on you take over everything Agent 7 does." Steve hung up after dropping those two quick words.
Toni pulled him through dance after dance until Pepper came over as if she wanted to have a whisper with Toni and Steve offered to get a glass of champagne.
Steve leaned down again and took hold of her shoulders, snapping them back twice as hard as he could and then pushing up a few more times with that force, "Here's a chance for you to assert your sovereignty, you can take this opportunity to give the woman who made you jealous a good lesson, you're the only one who can make me fuck so well."
"Yes, yes, so helpful and supportive Iron Woman, isn't it my turn to serve you now?" With some force, the girl was pushed down under him.
Although the man always complains to the girl that her hand job is terrible, he is still not willing to give up on this project as a preplay before the main event. Natasha's increasingly severe pregnancy reaction makes her accuse him of going too fast and inconsiderate, which he knows he has brought on himself by his eagerness to get a baby in her belly, but he can only gnash his teeth and mutter "I'm spoiling you". In reality, he had to cut back on the frequency of this recreational activity and just stick a shallow head in, stirring it around in the girl's mouth and coaxing her to give him the pleasure as licking a lollipop.
As they passed a phone booth, Grant stopped to ask if she needed to call a friend or something, and again Natasha gave that look of disinterest, "I only have about two friends, I think, and I don't remember the mobile numbers of any of them."
Natasha didn't know if it was the pain of the wound or the pain in her heart, but as soon as she closed her eyes, the tears fell. Steve finally felt a little pity, letting go of her hands and taking her cheeks instead, kissing away the tears, "Open your eyes and look at me, call me."
Natasha didn't know how long she was muddled and ravaged until she had lost consciousness in her knees and her voice was a little hoarse from shouting. Steve was distressed to hear this, but told himself that he could not forgive her so easily, so he picked up her panties, which had been thrown on the floor, and stuffed them into her mouth. The girl's resistance was more like amusement to him, her grasped hands, her teary-eyed expression, the whimpers that she tried to beg for mercy but could only make, all stirred his desire to torture her more like.
Since he had woken up in a time that was not his, he had rarely felt truly alive until the night he met her in Boston, after his heart had beaten for her briefly and passionately, when he had frozen his heart once again. And at that moment his heart found a new impetus, and he thought he would never forget those beautiful  eyes. "Toni......," he murmured as his fingers rubbed the picture on the file like he was gently stroking his lover's hair.
After a few rounds, Steve noticed that the girl had stopped making noises and began to ask himself whether he had really bullied her too much. There was a long way to go anyway, so he shouldn't have fucked her so badly on the first try. With that in mind, he slowly withdrew from the girl's body and rolled her over so she was lying on the floor, taking her hands and making her push her breasts up on her own, so he rubbed himself between the girl's tits a few dozen times before pinching her mouth open and releasing the last time of the day into her mouth.
Natasha spoke dry-mouthed and realised that Steve didn't seem to be listening carefully, so she began to think that maybe this was a good opportunity to put him down. "Finished?" Steve finally snapped out of his wandering mind and Natasha nodded.
The man reached up to her chest and teased thenipples that were wiggling as he pounded behind her, "If you scream better, maybe I'll have mercy and come quickly."
It had been a long time since Natasha had met someone she could talk to so well. She could deal with all sorts of people in all sorts of situations and purse the perfect laugh with them, but she never really wanted to listen to people who had a purpose. She just felt it was just something she had to do, that it was a means to an end rather than an enjoyment.
Toni, 21, had just lost both of her parents, and after days of drinking and staying up late, Pepper forced open her bedroom door and took her to hospital in a coma. And 26-year-old Steve, whose acting career was just taking off, was brought to the hospital by Bucky after his first leading role was interrupted by an accident on set, when he broke an arm in the process.
Although Steve had many tricks, Natasha found that his favourite was to enter her from behind in a position of absolute pressure, and she often felt like she was being fucked into the mattress. It was either that or being on her knees with the man behind her grabbing both breasts and pressing her towards him. Most of Natasha's refusals were met with a response from Steve, and only her repeated complaints of knee pain at this point were never heeded. Until one day, Captain Hydra commanded his men to spread blankets on every floor of their room and enjoyed the girl's face burning red when she saw the scene.
Natasha looked at Steve's relaxed smiling face and blinked, "What happened? No one just kissed me, did they?"
He seemed to have noticed her unsuccessful dealings with the drivers, "Are you going to stand here all night?"
The last thing he remembers is being shot on the battlefield the day after he proposed to the girl he loved. By the time he woke up from his nap, it was surprisingly months had passed. His good teammates tell him that he just lost those months of memory when he was hit by an alien ray while on a mission.
"Be good." Steve's words were like some kind of magic and Toni was glad he couldn't see her suddenly red cheeks, obediently taking his proffered hand and then wrapping it around his waist and crouching her whole body against him, her voice faint, "I haven't been home with anyone in a long time and I really like you."
She looked a little surprised, but immediately dropped what she was holding and then tugged at the collar of the man on top of her, "You're very enthusiastic today, big guy, and I was just going to ask that, want to do it?"
Natasha heard the dialing before she realised something was wrong and turned around to see that he was dialing Agent 32's number. She immediately tried to get out from under him, lifting her foot to stomp him up again, not expecting Steve had caught her ankle and dragged it back to re-pin her to his cock.
Steve finished his day's work and rubbed his forehead as he prepared to take a break and leave the base. He thought of the smile Morgan would show when she saw him later and felt the day's tiredness dissipate.
"Nat! Don't change the subject!" Captain America was flattered, but didn't want to let the girl's temptation stop him from pursuing the truth.
She admired the man's sleeping face for a moment before missing her fiancé more and more, and she gently brushed his blonde hair and whispered, "I know you're right here, I'll bring you home." Sighing, she gently rose from his arms, feeling a soreness in her back and legs that had never been worse just as soon as she hit the ground. "So that's how awesome quadruple body strength really is, I never thought Captain America would look like this when he launches into a frenzy." While mentally plotting how she was going to get it back from Steve when she got back to the building, Iron Woman casually draped a shirt over her head and opened a hidden compartment in the wall.
Steve grabbed the doughnuts for Tony and the toys for Morgan from the table and prepared to leave for home. Home. His heart softened at the thought, his home with Tony and their newborn baby girl, and even though Tony still avoided his warmth intentionally or unintentionally, his Omega was beginning to let him back into his life.
"Nat I can't..." Steve's clenched fist dropped to his side and the corners of his eyes seemed to have moistened a little, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, how could I..."
She really wanted to be back in New York right now, in her lab, or at least anywhere that had Jarvis. There were at least ten new ideas screaming in her head right now that she wanted to experiment quickly. But now she'd missed this last train of the day and still didn't want to call Pepper.
The man's slaps fell in quick succession, one after the other, the sound of the slap racing. He reached down again to free the girl's lips from between her clasped teeth, demonstratively, and the tighter she clamped down the faster he moved, as if he meant to win this. He even slipped another finger into the girl's already full pussy and Natasha finally moaned as he had hoped.
It was the first time Steve had sat down to talk and eat with Toni in peace, except Toni didn't know he was Captain America. No, I should say it's lucky she doesn't know that. That is why they have the opportunity to eat cheeseburgers together at the little shop down the street.
Steve didn't know what he could do for a long time after he woke up, and he mostly just spent his time in the gym. Since time had sent him here, maybe one day he would continue fighting on the battlefield in this day and age.
Steve nodded, thankfully, Toni wasn't too drunk. "You sit here, I'll go and get you some honey water."
Natasha thanked him when the announcement came over that the station was closing. She nodded to the man and continued walking, thinking about how she was going to get back to New York today.
Natasha lost all her pyjamas when she moved in, and every day after her bedtime shower, Steve threw her a light shirt that covered just the base of her thighs before pushing her down on the big soft bed and accusing her of seducing him. There were times when he didn't even bother to give her the shirt, but instead leaned back on the bed and watched the girl walk around the bedroom naked, occasionally taking a swipe at her before covering her mouth and fucking her hard.
The sheets were already wet, and she was covered in both the milk Steve had poured and the various bodily fluids they had exchanged, and Natasha felt uncomfortably sticky, and thinking that Steve would have had enough by now, given the intensity of the previous sex activities at the building, she asked for a shower.
Steve exhaled quietly in the girl's ear, "Why didn't you make a sound?" Before raising his voice and saying back, "I'm having an in-depth conversation with Agent 7 about the recent work schedule and I think you should listen to it."
"I heard from the maids that you used to like women like that," Fanny blushed and her voice got even smaller, "Did you really like me?"
The moment of entry Steve let out a sigh of satisfaction beyond words, "oh, toni, you're so good, ahhh... I love you toni..."
Pepper was holding an umbrella for her beside her and pointed casually, "Here, that's your partner for the next six months."
Steve's breath caught and he couldn't hold back any longer, stabbing his long, thick cock into the deepest part, Natasha didn't adjust well and let out a steep pout. "It's only been three months since I've been in there and you're already so thirsty again? You're getting really good at bed screaming."
For Natasha, it was a mixture of pain and pleasure. Once upon a time when she had been a playgirl, everyone had wanted to please her, no bed partner had ever dared to treat her like that. And then Steve, whom she had fallen in love with, had treated her with endless affection and never condescended to her. She had never been treated so roughly. And the pleasure Steve brought her at this time was something she couldn't deny; they were now as close as two people could ever get, compared to the rubbery that had always separated them. But when would their hearts return to the intimacy of the past?
His stubbornness was much less, mindful of the girl's health condition and avoided plunging into that passionate little slit, but he still had the desire to relieve it at times, so Natasha had to use other places to keep him entertained under his coaxing. Not being able to inhabit the girl's soft, wet body always took her longer to satisfy Steve, but Natasha was relieved that without the big guy to disturb her dreams, she could sneak him a shot of anaesthetic for blood again while he slept.
Every day Steve comes to sit in the room where she is recuperating as a symbol of comforting his subordinates, but every time he comes, he is with two of his soldiers standing guard at the door. It made Natasha incredibly anxious, having infiltrated Hydra for nearly half a month without finding a chance to be alone with Steve so that she could put him down and take his blood without attracting suspicion.
Steve didn't believe in the whole soul mate thing at first. One of the biggest reasons was that Peggy Carter's name had never been on anywhere of his skin when Peggy came into his life and he was convinced that Peggy was the love of his life.
"Maybe I lied to you at first, or maybe I'm lying to you now." Natasha sat up, smirking as she watched Grant in front of her take two steps back and raise his hands to her.
It was the first time Toni had seen Steve lose his temper, and he was so angry at how much malice was directed at Toni that he held the girl tightly in his arms and told her not to read the entertainment news online. "
"I'll go. I'll go undercover, get a sample of Steve's blood and send it out on a drone, then wait for Bruce to decipher the method, and once the decryption is confirmed to work, I'll kill Red Skull and bring Steve home."
Natasha was tickled by his blonde hair and just had to incline her head away. When Steve lifted his head after sucking the milk from her body and sucking enough of the two red points on her breasts, the first thing he saw was the girl's pale neck like a silent invitation to him. Natasha felt her whole body burn and wondered if Captain America had been brainwashed with a hard drive of pornography.
As if encouraged, Steve sucked heavily several more times before lifting his head and staring admiringly at his masterpiece - the girl's chest was already strewn with hand and tooth marks and her nipples were red and swollen. He looked at it for a moment before turning his attention to Natasha's face, "It must feel good huh? You almost rushed them into my mouth, right?" Without waiting for a reply, he ripped her trousers off, too.
Natasha said to herself that she could have handled those without him, but shrugged and said thank you anyway.
Then the cookies all fell to the floor and startled the two men who were nibbling away in the corner of the kitchen with little fabric left on them.
What Toni admires most about Steve is that he is always gentle and kind to everyone in the industry. He did not expect that he would suddenly be given the opportunity to work with Toni Stark and even become a close friend of hers after years of being unpopular. He had also heard that Toni had been through a lot of pain, so he paid more attention to Toni than to anyone else without realising it. But he didn't realise at first if there was anything special about it.
"Finished? Then wait by the door for a moment while I confer with Agent 7 before deciding on the next step." He deliberately said the words Agent 7 very slowly. With the man turning reluctantly to go out and close the door again, he quickly undid his own trousers, stripped the girl naked and picked her up again and heaved her against the door panel, and after a few haphazard explorations of that wet little hole, he fucked viciously inside.
He saw the girl's bruised and sore knees and bitten lips from kneeling on the floor for so long, when he had refused to care how much she had suffered. He saw the girl's tears falling on the bed as he grabbed both wrists and held them above her head while he covered her mouth and pushed hard and maliciously behind her. He saw the girl's cowering as he occupied her body night after night for the month he was obsessed with getting her pregnant with his child as soon as possible. He also finally saw what the complex feelings under the girl's eyes were as she choked on his big guy and burst into tears. He understood that when he had ravaged the girl like a sex toy in the mistaken belief that she had another person inside her heart, her heart had broken not because she was thinking of someone else, but because the person she missed was right in front of her and all she could do was grit her teeth, unable to speak.
Natasha grimaced as she listened to the tone of the woman on the other end of the line. And Steve had no intention of answering, but instead landed a slap on the girl's hip. Natasha froze, not really expecting such an idea from him. The pinch was very satisfying for Steve and he let out a long, sultry moan.
Toni stared at him for a moment with her cheeks in her hands, "Evans, I remembered, all the good you've done for me, it's all fake too."
After crying for a while, the girl got up from his arms, "Hey soldier," the girl smiled softly as she held his face, "stop saying you won't do anything to me, I'm not wearing anything in front of you now, if you don't do something to me, I'm really going to suspect I've lost my charm. " After that she really reached out and gave him a firm grip on his big guy, "Luckily, you're not unable to getting hard facing me. I really need you to do something to me." She eased two fingers inside herself and brought her still red and swollen nipples to his mouth again. "Listen, I'm already wet like a river for you."
"Baby open your mouth and don't make me say it twice." Clenching her teeth Natasha just looked heartbroken at the man in front of her as he reached out in slight anger and pinched the girl's small mouth open, giving her no chance to adjust before pushing it up to the opening of her throat in one swift movement. The girl's subconscious gagging response gave Steve even more pleasure, and his dick thickened again, making his head tingle with pleasure as he wanted to shove both balls into the girl's warm mouth.
Natasha raised her leg and stomped on his chest, but Steve was unmoved, as if he would not stop until she said something.
Natasha's answer, which was no different from the others', helped to dispel Steve's suspicions, and as he lay side by side with his beloved girl, he whined, pouting, "I wish I could remember," and Natasha, who hadn't heard Steve speak in such a childlike tone in a long time, was delighted to reach out and pinch the man's cheek and pat her belly. "Well, it's okay if you can't remember, apart from this little one, there's really nothing important about the last few months."
Toni froze at the sound of the door opening, "Why are you still here? I thought you were free to go?"
Steve took her hand and looped it around his waist, "Maybe because I wanted to get to know you better? Maybe I was afraid you wouldn't believe me? Maybe to be honest, I would have been afraid in my heart that I was waking up from a dream by poking it, and after your rejection, I could only, in your words, 'hold on to these fake memories and lie to myself that I had gotten it'."
Natasha once again felt the "I can do this all day" spirit of Steve Rogers. First he poured the bottle of pills he had found through the window in front of Natasha, and since then the girl has been under house arrest by Captain Hydra.
In the evening, Steve then called the agent into the conference room to hear the new arrangements. The large conference room was just Natasha and the agent sitting face to face, Steve stood behind Natasha and spoke quietly, "Agent 15, tell us what recent technological advances S.H.I.E.L.D. has made?" But his hands were poking through the girl's collar and cupping her breasts, pushing up a bulge or two in her dress.
Steve was silent for a couple of seconds before he smiled again, "Is the Ferris wheel anything special?"
The word yes almost came out of his mouth, and the moral compass finally squeezed out, "Someday. We will get there. We still have a lot of time." The bedroom remained unlit, and by the light from the window he could see Toni's flash of disappointment, not really sure if it was the so-called plot or the girl's real emotions.
He would even nastily hide the girl under the desk in the bedroom during a video conference while he was fully clothed, revealing only his big dick, which he would slap and poke at the girl's face for a while, smearing her face with wet precum before pushing deep into her soft, warm mouth. No matter how many times she had serviced him like this, Natasha could never get used to the length of his cock at this point. When Steve had had enough of the girl's hard swallowing and admired her long sweaty hair as she sucked hard, he would turn the camera towards the window and lay the girl on her back on the bed, so that her hips would rise high and in one swift movement he would plunge his desire straight into the longingly filled slit and irrigate her deeply. At this point, the people on the other end of the video always looked at each other as they heard the man's low gasps, the girl's overflowing moans, and the clash of flesh.
Steve caressed her face heartily, "There will always be new good days, from now on I'll be your light, whether you're happy or unhappy, always remember I'm waiting for you to come home."
Perhaps his fighting on the battlefield could protect ordinary people like Toni from the cruelty he faced, Steve thought as he watched her back from the station door.
Natasha shook her head as if to say, "How did these two get on each other again?" And Steve just frowned with red ears and didn't make a long speech like he always did, "Toni you should take care of your wounds, meeting dismissed."
"And you really took that woman's crazy talk to heart?" Steve kissed his way down to her forehead, undressing her as he did so. At the end, Natasha was stripped clean and laid on the bed, and Steve quickly stripped himself and jumped on top of her. "You'll believe anything she says? And will you listen to me?"
