“Uh, I haven’t really made plans, yet. I thought maybe catching up a bit with some friends – though I would rather avoid Wade if possible.”
Peter rolls his eyes. The other kid snorts, but doesn’t speak as he sits down at the breakfast table. Carefully, Peter takes a hold of the girl’s arms, pulling her loose from Tony to get her to eat breakfast. She, in turn, grabs Tony’s hand and pulls him along.
There are a few things in life that Tony Stark can appreciate. Sleeping in with Steve is probably on top of that list along with spending quality time with Peter. Other than that, it can be a hot cup of coffee, good sex and having his friends alive and well.
Tony shakes his head. Normally he would request his tablet so he could do some research but since his own mind can do the exact same thing it’s not necessary anymore. Steve puts a hand on Tony’s cheek, giving him a sad look before kissing his lips shortly.
The edited the song a little bit, holding off the long pause that Steve usually used to give his speech about whatever he was selling at that point. Instead, Tony joins the girls in their dance, putting the shield on his back to make sure he doesn’t accidentally hurt someone with it. Meanwhile, the men, wearing each their own Cap-themed uniform, step up on the stage as well, with their hand up on this forehead as a salute while they march.
“Yeah, me too,” MJ returns. Then she puts a hand on Peter’s cheek and leans forward, pressing her lips against his. As a complete mirror of earlier today, MJ’s kiss is soft and sweet instead of hard and insisting. Peter’s eyes close automatically, and his hand goes up to the back of her head. His fingers tangle in her messy curls. Gently, he’s pulling her closer to him.
Yaël turned to Tony. “You could’ve ask me to leave, but that would’ve been too simple, right?” she hissed. Did this man really have such a big need of showing off his power, he’d just let his bodyguards drag her to the street? She ignored the fact that Stark looked a bit shocked as well as he didn’t do a thing to stop the bodyguards, with his mouth fallen open and his eyes wide.
“I’ll take care of Peter, just get to safety!” Steve shouts back, literally pushing Tony towards the door. With the small bits of metal in Tony’s clothes slowing him down, he obeys for a few seconds before stopping to turn back around. He sees Steve walking to Rosie, asking her something. Peter jumps up to the ceiling and seems to get Otto’s attention.
Tony isn’t too surprised when he sees two guards standing in front of Steve’s door. He’s not too worried about them letting him in; they know he’s been visiting in prison, as well as he’s been the one in charge of transporting Steve all the way to Switzerland. After a nod towards the guards, the men give him a long look before finally stepping aside and giving Tony the chance of getting in.
“Peter Parker! How about that! It’s been a while, hasn’t it?” Francis asks. The man had been Peter’s mentor for a while back when he first started his internship at Stark Industries. After getting into Tony’s radar, though, he started working at the Compound instead of the tower, thus getting Tony as a mentor instead – which had been the plan all along.
“I was once in possession of the Infinity Stone. Because of it, I am able to do what I can do. But I know it’s here,” the man says. In the beginning, Tony had been fascinated by his low voice. Heimdall seems like the kind of guy that could just read a damn telephone book and entertain people.
“You know, the arc reactor has been created by Howard Stark and another inventor called Anton Vanko back in the time? Thus far, only their sons have managed to build this thing – even in the freaking miniatured-version, as if the actual reactor wasn’t impossible enough!” Francis calls out, trying to once more take on his teaching-role as an instructor.
“Of course not,” Mr. Stark responds, but the way he says it reveals enough. “Okay, maybe a bit, but in my defense, I have benefits from this as well; Cap keeps on whining about me never doing anything, so at least this way I’m relieved from him for at least a few hours.”
Slowly, Peter gets up from the bed. There’s no creaking of metal, or the springs protesting from the movement. The floors don’t crack, either. There’s a giant closet, a nightstand with an expensive-looking lamp. On the desk, there’s a computer that looks worth even more than what Peter earns in a whole year. On the screen, one thing is written.
As it turns out, the Wakandans are there already. Peter is quickly greeted by Shuri, who gives him a sad look and another promise that she’ll figure this out. When she suggests to Tony and May that it would help bringing Peter to Wakanda, neither of them seems to hesitate on it. Peter doesn’t listen as they try to work something out.
“It’s because Mr. Stark is too busy playing around in that flying suit of his that he forgets that he has a company under his name,” brown-glasses points out.
Dr. Cho instead finishes off at last and stands up to throw away her things and clean her hands. She gives Peter one long look when he pulls the top of his suit back on and then tries to stand up. It still stings when he tries to stretch his shoulder, which means that he shouldn’t be moving it too much.
“Can you- can you all just give me a short moment?” he asks. Bruce and Helen nod before heading towards the door. Tony, Steve and May don’t move until Peter shakes his head once more. “Please, I need to be alone for a few minutes.”
It’s not like it has sentimental value in it, or anything like that. He just finds it a good song; it’s catchy, it’s got some good vibes, and it helps him relax a little bit as he stands in a full train on his way back to Queens.
As she walked, she started thinking about Jason. Not that she wanted to, but now that she had the space and rest, he just popped up in her mind again. He had a few character traits similar to Loki, that’s true. But he wasn’t Loki at all and those traits weren’t all that bad.
“Not really too well, though he doesn’t try to let it show. He’s much like you, on that front,” Sam admits. Then he takes a deep breath. “And he misses Peter, too.”
“He’s feeling fine, aside for the fact that he’s paralyzed from the waist down,” he says bitterly. Natasha sighs and nods.
May’s eyes tear up a bit. “I love you, too, Peter,” she returns, kissing him on the forehead. Then she looks at Steve. “We all do.”
Oh, if Tony wants to drink, that means that he’s having a hard time again. Peter gets up from the couch and nears the man standing there. Tony doesn’t notice Peter’s moving, so when the teenager wraps his arms around him in a strong hug, he startles a little bit.
“Uh, heya Petey,” Tony greets his son, glad to see at least one familiar figure in the tower. Then, much to his surprise, he’s followed by another teenager. This second boy looks a few years younger than Peter.
Aware that there’s no micro around them, and that nobody can hear them, Tony whispers in Peter’s ear.
Bruce closes his screens again and nervously plucks his glasses off his nose. “Right, I’ll be there in a minute,” he then says. Peter nods and leaves the room again. When he’s back to his living room, Harry’s still making his explanation to MJ, who still looks a little bit surprised. Tony, at the kitchenette, looks at it all in fascination.
Ah, well, what could possibly happen? Peter closes the door and locks it before following MJ and Rhodey to the stairs.
Tony opens his eyes again, finding both May and Steve walking up to him, holding cups of coffee in their hands.
His phone rings. It’s Happy, asking if he should bring the kid back to the airport. Tony tells him that, yes, he should be getting home. He should never have been involved in this; he received some serious hits and seemed to limp a bit when he tried to walk. And the worst part is that Steve even
“About that…” Aunt May starts as she pulls her hand back. Then she makes a slight turn and starts walking forward again, moving to the next panel. Peter frowns as he follows her. “I know I’m the one who told you to go for the internship, and I’m really glad you’re trying to make things better again.”
sad to see he’s not wearing his uniform, but then again why would he have been? It’s not like either of them have been called into action a lot, lately.
“Uh, thanks?” she returns, uncertainly. Then she blinks a few times more and jumps up from her seat. She grabs her plate, drops her bottle again and accidentally kicks her bag from the chair to the ground. “I- uh, I need to… go… now.”
It’s a calm evening for a change. With only a small mugging and another lost lady on his way, Peter finds the perfect opportunity to get himself a roof and just hang out for a bit. Taking an empty one with no possible visitors, he drops down on it and takes a few breaths.
“I don’t know, maybe? I really need Bruce on this one because I just don’t think I can do it, Steve,” Tony counters. And it’s true; he might be a genius, but it takes someone with actual knowledge about biology to know what they’re supposed to be doing here. And, sure, Peter’s good at biology, but his judgement is clouded. He might be trying
Right, about his first problem. He looks at his door, hesitating on leaving his room and facing Johnny immediately.
Is this what Peter wants? Does he want Tony to be his father? To be the parent that helps him with his homework in those few years he’ll still have some? Or to talk to about some girl that he likes? Does he want Tony to be the one to congratulate him when he does something right, or to scold him when he’s done something bad?
“Ah come on! I’m hungry!” Wade whines. They both just ignore him, instead eating in silence (as much as that’s possible), and only letting him out once they’ve finished.
Peter smirks, realizing he hasn’t been spending much time with his new friends lately. Sure, Wade still stalks him daily, and he gets to see Wanda almost every other day, but Yaël’s been pretty absent from his life the past few weeks.
“Wow, good morning, angry German bitch.” Wade cocked an eyebrow as he saw Yaël’s murderous looking face.
Because, let’s face it, he might be in a relationship with the guy, but he’s not going to let him win because of that. Tony still has his standards.
“I’m, uh, going to give you two a minute,” Happy says, taking a small step back. “I’ll be close behind.”
“Help me in this eternal embarrassment,” she muttered, looking up into the sky with the palms of her hands facing upwards.
“They spotted Rumlow. The team is going out again,” she states. Tony’s face falls then, and Peter, too, feels disappointment going through him. That would mean that Steve would be leaving as well… And Wanda, too?
After helping him get dressed, Peter is seated down on the couch, a blanket wrapped around him and an untouched hot coco on the table. He doesn’t have the intention of drinking it, feeling like it’ll probably come back out just as fast as it came in. It’s a wonder he didn’t puke that morning, but that’s probably because he hadn’t eaten anything yesterday.
“Oh, now I’m gonna get it…” he mumbled to a random woman standing next to him, who looked at Wade with utter disgrace and confusion. Yaël stamped towards him.
“No, dad made sure nobody was in there tonight,” he says. Everybody lets out a long sigh. When Peter hears something else approaching, he looks up into the sky.
Shit, right okay she probably knows. Tony clears his throat, swallowing through a hard lump before nodding.
“You’ve just died, Parker,” she whispers to him, pulling the trigger and getting the sucker planted on his skin. Holding on to him for just a little while longer, Natasha takes a few deep breaths, but eventually she does pull away. “Alright, exercise is over.”
using him.” Eddie walks forward, grabbing Peter by the suit and punching him once in the face. Peter coughs out some blood, having bitten his tongue in the process.
“FRI, open up will you?” Tony asks with a low voice. The moment he’s said the word, the doors burst open with two sets of footsteps barging inside. Oh, crap, he’s really going to get it now…
Tony blinks twice. His friends? That could only be Harry, Ned, Felicia, MJ, Johnny and Yaël. Perhaps Wanda, too. In some occasions Wade as well.
Though, not exactly ‘nobody’. May handles it pretty well, so it seems. And so does Steve. While everybody tries to be careful with Peter, the two of them just act like they normally would around him. Sure, they don’t act the exact same way, keeping attention to Peter’s behavior, but… Tony doesn’t know. He can’t really explain it.
Harry turns towards Peter, leaning his head on his shoulder as he looks at him. “I know but… they were still my hands. Just like impaling you during that one fight. The doctors told me you needed surgery after that?”
“I’m probably going to regret this,” she mutters as she reaches towards the door. Opening it, she gestures for Tony to get inside.
“But if I’m honest, I like the red and blue better,” May jokes. “So let’s get this crap off of you and make you back into the Spider-Man we all know, alright?”
Natasha gives him a small pat on the shoulder before heading out. A quick glance at Steve and Tony, she sees that they’re just about to start their own sparring session. And then, just for a
Tony keeps himself from mentioning anything about Connors. It doesn’t help in their situation and it’s unneeded information.
Yaël put her hand on her mom’s obvious baby bump and stroked it like it was a cat or something. Agostina snickered and lifted her little girl into her arms. Her mom asked her what she’d think of becoming a big sister and Yaël reacted by giving her mom the biggest, proudest grin she had.
And Mary’s hand go down to her stomach instinctively, tears showing up in her eyes. “No,” she mumbles out as she takes a step back, leaning against the wall. Tony wishes he could take it back, make sure she never finds out, but… it wouldn’t be fair. Nothing is fair. Mary should have lived, so did that idiot husband of hers. Peter should have had his parents.
“I agree with Ben,” Reed finally speaks up. “Besides, signing means we can keep on going. If we don’t, we’re not allowed to do anything anymore, Johnny.”
After that, he starts walking off, a heavy feeling in his gut and a sharp eye looking at his retreating back. Tony hides away in the car. He doesn’t want to return to the tower, but also doesn’t know where-else he could possibly get to. Rhodey’s only coming back in two days, and he’s not really
The past few texts have been more of the same. They’re just small little updates on his life, things he wants Steve to know, despite knowing that he won’t ever get to see these. And if Tony would be aware he’s doing this, he’ll be feeling horrible again, so it’s his mission nowadays not to let the man know.
There’s a slight awkward moment with May; she’s angry she couldn’t reach him the entire evening, Peter skipped detention, Tony personally got him here. That could only mean that he’s been doing crap he shouldn’t do.
“So, uh… just babies in particular? Or children in general?” he tries for clarification. Steve shakes his head in return.
“Aunt May?” Peter asks once he gets inside. He kicks the box into the hallway and starts taking off his shoes and jacket while he waits for an answer, but then he doesn’t get one. That’s okay, it can happen, it probably means she’s still running a few hours at the hospital.
It’s not like he’s contributing a lot to it. He’s only fifteen, not at the age to give any counseling or whatever. He just mostly helps serving the food and cleans up the place a bit.
“You wouldn’t be the first,” the woman answered dryly. And at some point Yaël somehow managed to let a bottle of antiseptic freeze and burst, so a splinter of the glass cut in the doctor’s shoulder.
Then, after a while, he would take a small break – a coffee Dum-E would bring him, along with something to eat. He would talk a little bit with the other interns – though ignoring that redheaded MJ-girl who seems to be interning as some sort of reception-girl of this floor.
“Oh, come on, why wouldn’t you give me the pleasure of playing with it before releasing him,” Yaël complained. Loki glanced at her as he got back up. But instead of taking Yaël’s invite for a childish contest of poking each other verbally, he threw a little smile and thanked Korg, acting like he had manners.
“I’m up here!” comes from somewhere. Peter looks up, finding a hole in the ceiling. There, indeed, he can see her suddenly walk up to him, kneeling down with her hands grabbing the edge of the floor. “Can I pass these two down to you? It’s too dangerous to jump from here.”
Peter chuckles a bit, though keeping his eyes closed. He realizes he’s dressed in nothing but his underwear, but he doesn’t care. The suit is gone, and he feels like this dark cloud has been removed from his head. He’s no longer in conflict with himself.
True to her word, Happy and Rhodey are still in the car when they get there. They all hurry inside, Pepper never looking up as she takes the seat next to Tony with her eyes still stuck to her phone. Tony, too, pulls out his tablet and seems to make it his mission not to say anything to anybody. He fails at it when Pepper addresses him.
Though they did help along during the war against Thanos a few years back. Tony probably shouldn’t complain about it.
Tony doesn’t smile. All he does is lie back down and close his eyes. Peter knows he isn’t sleeping no matter how much he’s trying. He feels guilty when May comes to take him home, but he knows he can’t stay. Tony urges him to leave, telling him it’s a school day tomorrow and that he needs his rest. So Peter goes.
“She came down with the Chitauri on the day of the invasion. When I destroyed the base, they all died except for her. Which is why SHIELD took special interest in her,” he explains. He pulls up his tablet and logs in to his hidden files. There he brings up her case. “The Hulk found her, kicked her ass, but she didn’t die despite it. So we took her in. She was watched almost the entire time by one of our team to make sure she wouldn’t break free.
FRIDAY responds. Not even five seconds after that, the door flies open and Johnny walks in with a scarf around his throat and a bonnet on his head. Even from where Peter is standing, he can see that the boy's not well.
Peter moves, he throws his entire soul in it, it seems. Tony is already leaning back in his seat, against Steve who has his mouth dropped open just as widely as Tony’s. LL and Chrissy, too, make surprised noises as Peter seems to feel no shame in making some slightly obscene movements.
With that, Natasha walks off, still seeming extremely pissed off about everything. Over her shoulder, she still shouts something, this time directed at Peter.
To be fair, it’s never happened before at all. Uncomfortable with the position, Peter rolls a bit to the side. His back aches, his hips aches. Heck, even his goddamn ass aches. Peter groans as he gets on his stomach. The stones on the street scrapes against his face.
“Why would he want that?” Peter asks. If anything, he would have expected Tony to be ecstatic about it.
“Well, I don’t know,” Peter answers truthfully. Sure, he’d rather not tell his life story to Wade Wilson, but right now he’s one of the only friends he’s got. However sad that is. “For now, I’d rather he didn’t know, but on the other hand I really
“Yeah, because you were so extremely innocent,” Wade threw back sarcastically, holding the dress in front of him, like he was going to fit it.
“Really? What’s the meeting about? If I may ask, of course?” Typical Captain America, so friendly all the time. Peter just chuckles and shakes his head while looking at his hands.
“Okay,” Wade answered, “that super handsome boy over there, who is achieving money from that way too ordinary-looking couple, will be my next boyfriend.” Yaël raised an eyebrow.
been together for quite a few years, after all. I don’t really know the details of their break-up, though.”
“Wedding, yes, we know! Thor wanted to come and get you himself, but there had to be last-minute adjustments to his robes which he had to be present for.”
I've just finished writing the 24th chapter as well, and it's pretty heartbreaking. It might be because I'm still sick, but I actually cried a bit while writing it. Civil War did things to me... :'(
It’s in February when Tony announces that the rebuilding of the Compound is finally completed. A couple of the Avengers decide to move back, but Bruce, Natasha and Bucky stay in place. Harry, too, decides not to head back. Instead, he finds a place near Peter’s, and after school they mostly just hang out together. Peter also talks to Ned more, again. He finds out that Ned is doing great, and that he’ll come back for summer break where he wants to know everything about all that happened in New York. Of course, Peter tried to keep him up to date about the Venom-stuff, but it’s not always that easy to explain to a science-geek who is also about the biggest Spider-Man fanboy!
“Ah, there’s our champ,” Steve says with a grin the moment Peter appears in the dining room. Peter smiles back towards Steve, who is wearing culinary gloves and is transporting a hot pot of food towards the table.
But what he hadn’t been counting on, was the sudden release of some sort of gas through the sprinklers on the ceiling. Of course, the Chitauri had been warned, because they all put on gasmasks.
After the form-fitting fabric has been perfected and sent away for dyeing, Mr. Stark put Peter to work on some sort of holographic wrist display that will be added to the suit later on. With the help of the inventor, Peter put together a GPS tracking-system, along with a prototype for a small recon-drone.  But, as usual, while Peter helps with the basics, Mr. Stark keeps him out of the final product.
“How do I say something like that, Yaël? ‘Hi, I’m Peter, I’m not only your son, but also Spider-Man.I almost got killed to death by my best friend but that’s just what happens in my life since I’m a gifted kid who wants nothing other than to be an Avenger and put my life down the line, please consider me for your team’?”
Wade looked at it like he was a kid at the circus. Yaël moved the water until it hung above Wade’s glass. Then she formed her hand into a tight fist. Wade saw the water turn into ice in just a second. Yaël dropped the ice in the juice and handed the glass to Wade. He smiled, as if the juice would taste even better now.
“Wait, that Panther-dude from back I Germany?” Peter asks. When the three nod, he whistles. “Wow, that’s so cool.”
“But I think you’ll be capable to carry the truth. So, I want you to contact me whenever you see things you don’t understand and we’ll figure these out together,” Professor X continued.Yaël wanted to snort; the only thing that was traumatizing her was thisfugly apartment these two men had put her in. She guessed that the lack of luxury or money was also a punishment for whatever she had done before.
“Nothing I want to talk about now,” Peter admits. He needs to have a conversation with Harry’s doctors first about how he should handle this. “I’ll tell you later, alright?”
“The Guardians told us they’ll come back to the tower by the end of the week. The others are fine, but worried.”
Tony explains, feeling slightly proud that he’s found this. Steve smiles only slightly when he looks at it, fingers obviously itching to touch it but holding himself back.
Fighting these goons feels just like old times. He avoids, jumps and steps aside, but never throws the punch. It’s better to just wait for these guys to tire themselves out. Which they do rather quickly. As the one on his left starts gasping for breath, the one on his right takes a few steps back to get his composure back on. The other three start failing their punches even more, and that’s when Peter strikes.
Once he gets to a folder with ‘Miniature Arc Reactor’ written on it, Peter finds something familiar in the name. He picks out the folder, takes a look at the papers, and eventually finds some documents that explain to him a bit better what this device is.
Tony goes through his tablet for a little bit longer. After that, he just lies his head back down. He falls asleep faster than ever.
“Hello little man,” Tony whispers, not willing to wake up the boy’s mother. Carefully, he starts stepping aside, making sure that he’s a safe distance away from her.
“But you’ve been searching for a boyfriend ever since that intern of yours got dumped?” he counters. Darcy rolls her eyes.
Don't be afraid to let me know what you think. Is there something that there should be more of? Things that are a bit boring and dragged out too long? I take any feedback I get!
Then, taking another quick look at the picture, Tony is reminded of a lazy Sunday morning a few weeks back. Steve slept in for once, and it came to the rare point where Tony was awake before him. Tony had pulled out his cellphone and woke Steve up by kissing him on the cheek, exactly at the same time that he took a picture. It had been a good one, and it’s still, currently, saved onto his phone.
Things were tense for a while. Tony had, of course, followed through on his promise to organize a celebratory party. It had been fun, and Steve hadn’t been able to relax that much in a long while. But after that, Ultron came.
“No!” Steve backed. “But... I mean… Tony doesn’t have to know, right?” Yaël inhaled sharply. What. The. Actual. Fuck. This was so not going to happen.
“Peter, I really don’t think that matters right now,” Vision says, sounding embarrassed about the sudden mention of it. If he was human, he would have been blushing right now.
, the title says. Steve feels an immediate wave of anger coming over him. So they’ve spotted him on the way out? That’s exactly what Steve wanted to avoid, damn it.
In the meantime, Michelle is appointed the new Team Captain of the Decathlon team. They celebrate shortly. Peter needs to leave.
“Never,” he gets out while wiping the tears away from his eyes. “Honestly, Brucibear, I never thought I’d get to see Steve drunk, but here we are!”
Eventually they get back inside when the snowfall seems to get worse. It’s weird how much the climate here can be so different from New York’s. Steve shakes the snow off his gown and takes a look inside. The room has filled out, the musicians already tuning their Asgardian instruments. The choir warming up their voices. Every person performing seems to be wearing the same sort of golden gowns. A couple of the chairs already seem to be taken. Steve can quickly recognize Tony sitting next to Bruce and Stephen.
“That’s-“ she starts, finding herself unable to finish that sentence. “When did you find out about him?”
It’s just a knock… he can most definitely do this! In his attempt to find any reassurance from FRIDAY, all he finds is static. She wasn’t yet around back in this time. And any search for internet brings him horrible results so he’s not even going to try again with that.
“Wow, that’s weird,” Bruce exclaims. “If you don’t mind, I might want to have a look at your blood, see what exactly has been changed?”
It’s right there, booming where it’s supposed to be. But it looks different, it’s under construction. There’s nothing indicating it’s an Avengers-related building, or that Stark Industries still operates in it. It looks just like any other building now.
Yaël wanted to counter him as he wasn’t in a relationship either, but he actually had a good reason for that, with the whole Gwen-incident.
Someone roughly knocked open the door, it made Yaël jump and look behind her. Two bodyguards stormed in and before she even had the time to think about what the freaking hell was going on, they grabbed her arms and one of them said: “Miss, you have one minute to leave this building in peace.”
We do our best at capturing the characters as accurately as possible, but it's not easy when you're character is two characters at once. No character is flawless, less of all Peter Parker or Tony Stark, who this story is about after all. We write, and hope you like it. If not, that's okay, thanks for trying anyway. But to those who DO like the story, we thank you so, so, so much for inspiring us to write more and more every day. Each comment, each Kudo, subscription or bookmark means so much, so thank you, thank you, thank you <3 <3
“Easy on the merchandise,” he jokes out. “War wounds.” He raises his shirt to clarify that he’s not shying away from the check. Then the two are allowed in. Tony knows his way, so he motions for Peter to follow him.
Yaël couldn’t see the woman anymore as the turned and screeched by Peter using his webs to try to stop the vehicle. Something flew of the roof, probably that Wolverine-thing and that was exactly when Yaël had the feeling they started flying…in a bad way.
That’s cheating! She wanted to yell, but she couldn’t. As she rolled onto her back, her eyes crossed the VIP section and saw Loki looking at her. He was probably enjoying this sight. She could only stare at him.The shock disappeared as quickly as it had begun. Yaël saw some light flicker in the corner of her eye. She rapidly jumped up before the purple guy could stab her, still, he managed to make a deep cut in her forehead. When she touched the wound, she felt the warm blood dripping over her fingers.
The world around her was shaking, forcing her to open her eyes again. She didn’t even notice it was night already, or that there was a stray cat who rolled himself up against her waist. The only thing she saw, was her own face, staring back at her viciously.
The three stand up simultaneously, running the same direction Steve and Tony went to. Natasha just shakes her head, figuring she shouldn’t pay too much attention to them, anymore.
“Tony, are you alright?” Sharon asks, putting down her knife and fork and adjusting herself in her seat. Tony blinks a few times before looking to the side, seeing a few empty chairs around them, but only two that matter.
"I- what the fuck?" Tony stammers out. Then Steve holds out his fist towards Tony, expecting a fist bump. Everybody blinks, still surprised for what just happened. Understanding dawns in on everybody.
“Was that alright?” Thor asks, smile bright on his face. Steve smiles in return, hiding away every bit of doubt.
The moment the elevator opens again, Peter stumbles into the hallway, hurrying himself to the doors that would bring him outside. He notes quickly that it’s a one-way door, but he’s sure FRIDAY will let him back in once he wants to go back.
“There are interns, sure. But only a select few are allowed to work with Tony personally. He only takes the most promising students fully under his wings, I suppose,” Steve says, sounding a bit off while he talks. Then he sighs and offers Peter another smile. “But if you’re a smart kid, I don’t think you’ll have to worry about it.”
Yaël learned that Nat and she used to be good friends, although they didn’t start off that way. Well, she was friends with nobody when she firstly arrived on earth, since she kind of made New York crumble. But since Steve seemed to like Yaël and trust her, Natasha got a bit curious and started watching the moves Yaël made and analyzed every word she said.
“Ah, you know, stuff like diarrhea for one were the worst cases, I think. Other than that, it was just the near-constant crying of children, the wine automatically becoming sour, people waking up as a different gender, people getting drunk on only water. You can imagine Hilde in that last situation.”
“That’s complicated, actually. I could give you my parents notes on the spiders? My other dad created them after all.”
He opens the door, balancing the two glasses with precision. Steve is behind the television when he gets inside. His face is full f surprise when he sees Tony enter. He jumps up from his bed. At least he’s no longer bound. He can walk and stand where he wants to go, except for outside.
“You’re building a new one, aren’t you?” he’d asked. Tony’s eyes looked up to him, something looking like fear passing in his gaze.
“What the-?!” he calls out in surprise, jumping back. On top of the sheets, there’s a girl with familiar white hair. Her suit looks torn and ripped at some parts. Her face is slightly bloody, too. But Peter recognizes her immediately. “MANTIS!”
Peter compares everything he sees on the pieces of paper with whatever he finds in the gauntlet. Every little screw – not that there are many – or cable inside, he searches through it all to find anything that might indicate that there’s something wrong. But even with the limited knowledge he has on electrical engineering, Peter quickly comes to find that there’s nothing wrong with it, really.
Otherwise, things are alright again as much as they can be. After they defeated Venom, it appeared that Tony woke back up from being knocked out and, with a few simple mathematical calculations, he managed to form a plan to get himself, Rhodey and Steve out of the collapsed building. Harry’s back in New York, staying here and starting up an education that will help him earn back his company for good. Johnny’s back in the apartment. Everything sounds just about right.
Peter realizes that he doesn’t have a Christmas present for Tony. Luckily, he has a lot of people he can ask for help!
The other person is Clint – of course it’s Clint. Though while he normally looks like he’s ready to start cracking a joke, right now he, too, looks absolutely serious.
Tony itches on telling her no. On one hand he doesn’t want to face him just yet. He isn’t ready for the shameful apology he hasn’t even prepared yet. But eventually he surprises himself when he finds himself saying: “Yeah, call him up.”
If Tony notices his change of behavior, he doesn’t point it out. Instead, after they’ve gone out of the elevator, he just squeezes Peter’s shoulder and heads for the kitchenette.
“Hey, you once vaguely mentioned you would do it with me! It helps if we sign up now so at least we’ll have a spot in the team for next year!”
Within a blink of an eye, she didn’t even have the time to turn towards the door to yell for help, the ‘ball’ started bursting. Or was it her bones that were breaking?
“We couldn't do anything, it just happened all around us. And I could only hold you in my arms, you were so scared. Something snapped inside of me, Peter. Something snapped inside Steve, too. We were trying to hold on to you, but we just couldn't. When all else seemed lost, we had to take some serious risks to get us back to where you were still alive.”
“The first few months I got hold up a little with Asgardian stuff. But after that, I immediately contacted you-hold it!” Loki raised his hand with an arrogant flair when Yaël wanted to interrupt him. “But you were extremely foggy, not even remembering who I was. At first, that hurt me a little, but I understood that this way I could help you out without you distrusting me. So I helped you out with the memories-“
"What, you're afraid you're going to lose?" Tony baits him. Clint gasps, copying what Thor did earlier. Then he grabs one of the guns and nods towards his teammates.
You didn’t. But I do love you, and you love me. And we’ll be together soon, I promise,” Steve assures him. He manages to smile lightly. “Now, do you promise you will listen to Peter from now on? He’s also trying to help you.”
“No!” Tony shouts then. Another shaky breath. “In what universe is this not a mistake? We can’t just wipe away all those punches I gave you. You were bruised and bleeding! And you want me to pretend that I’m not worse than my own father there?”
“No! What happened? I’m so sorry, Peter!” Harry says reaching out to him. Peter wants to say it’s his own fault, that he should have kept Gwen out of the Spider-Man business. But then he realizes Harry doesn’t remember. He doesn’t know about Peter being Spider-Man.
Except for Peter. Tony could never forget about Peter. And in his head, he starts preparing multiple ways to apologize to him. If he could ever do that, of course.
He reaches out for it, by now not even expecting a message from Steve or any of the other guys. Whatever this secret mission was, Tony’s extremely sure that, by now, the mission is already over. They’re probably just enjoying their time off, taking a holiday in New Asgard. Not bothering to even let him know anything.
Miles doesn’t know too much about Mr. Li. He’s a businessman who suddenly decided to become a philanthropist, helped build up this entire thing, and comes by nearly every day. He’s got an office here on the second floor. Stark’s got one, too, though it’s rarely used since the guy’s super busy all the time. Probably. Miles wouldn’t know since he usually keeps his whereabouts a secret, unlike his old man.
Yaël let Wade rattle and gossip about the students for a bit. Suddenly the horse-mill made a ringing sound to announce the end of the ride. When she jumped off her horse, she saw parents looking judgmental at her. Acting like a complete grown-up adult must be so stupid, Yaël thought. Since when was sitting on a horse-mill a crime?
Yaël didn’t hear or see Peter’s reaction. The only thing she could think of, was that she’d give a million dollars to go play Requiem For A Dream on the streets right now. But she couldn’t, because she didn’t have a cello in the compound and she wasn’t free to go to Charles whenever she wanted. Hell, someone even arranged her a driver to bring her to school and back at the exact time her classes were over, so she didn’t even have the time to talk to Charles or practice the cello.
“You know, it’s not alright to stalk people like that,” Peter tells him jokingly, and Tony just waves it off.
She retracted the warmth from his body and created a ball of fire which she steered right in his face as he was still hanging right above her to cut her throat. The man shrieked and jumped off, dropping his sword as he grabbed his face. Half of it was heavily burned, the flesh was black and some of it hung down from his face with just a few last strings. Yaël sprinted and grabbed his sword as he made herself fall down and slip through her opponent’s legs, making the dust fly up. Now all the training finally paid off.
“-course I don’t mind your company, but there’s just some things I like to do alone, Tony. Visiting Peggy  is one of them.”
“Hey Goblin!” Peter calls out, feeling a tug in his chest when he remembers once again that it’s Harry hovering there on that glider. When Harry turns his face around, Peter shoots a few webs into his eyes. It’s a simple distraction, but it’s a welcome one apparently. Harry immediately reaches for his eyes and never sees War Machine coming when the soldier slams against him – throwing him off the glider. Rhodey holds him up by his arm and throws him back on the roof, his rockets hitting the glider hard just for good measure.
Tony has been complaining for the past ten minutes now. He knows he’s being annoying, but he had just been lying in bed so comfortably with his cuddle-pillow breathing slowly next to him as they were starting their interesting plans of the day. And then that annoying call came in, and said cuddle-pillow hurried back out of bed and got himself dressed again.
Tony finds Steve again after a while. The super soldier is slashing his shield in everything, letting out shouts of anger while his longer hair swings wildly into the air. But even Tony can see that, while he’s giving it his all right now, he’s close to exhaustion as well. It’s going on for too long, but they aren’t getting any closer to winning. With every passing second, more of their comrades fall.
“I guess I can’t just go blame you… You have been acting really strange and I never really did anything to help you…” MJ shakes her head again before turning back towards the door slightly. “Bye, Peter.”
“It’s Friday,” Yaël answered without thinking about how rude she sounded. Maybe she should’ve said ‘hello’ first and ask the woman’s name, but nope.
He can barely think anything before somebody grabs him and lifts him up from the ground. He wants to protest, to say that he can walk fine by himself, but the hold on him is stronger than he expects.
“We don’t know,” she admits. “For now, it doesn’t seem like it. But the amount you have is significantly smaller than Steve.”
“Before he starts to think he’s in this alone,” Steve corrects him. “Take these books, get to his room. Read them next to him, maybe he can explain some things as well.”
Tony grunts and closes his eyes again when he feels some tears form in his eyes. He takes a few deep breaths, biting on his lower lip while Cap speaks.
Peter wakes two hours later. He’s still quite groggy, unable to give a verbal answer to many of the questions asked to him, but he does seem to recognize the people around him. His hand reaches out in both directions, and Tony and May both automatically reach for them.
Yaël looked up and then it kicked in that her clients didn’t know about her powers at all. What could she do? Yaël panicked and stopped steering the hail.  Which caused her getting soaked, but she hoped Mrs. Thompson would think she imagined it. The old woman disappeared behind the window. Yaël should go and get her bag, right? It was time to go. But as she went to get her backpack, someone opened the backdoor.
“This,” Mr. Stark starts, sitting down on his chair and throwing the shirt towards Peter, “is an auto-fit shirt. It’s supposed to accustom itself to its wearer without making it too big or too small.”
There’s surprised gasps before a thunderous applause rises up in the public. Peter freezes up on the spot, suddenly afraid to get on the stage. He looks back at Steve, who nods at him.
“Nu-uh, this time you’re not taking the beard away from me like that,” Tony mutters from the bed. Steve laughs but raises his hands up in the air in surrender.
"Great, that way everyone can enjoy your great hair," Yaël smirked at him while passing her hair through his long, soft strands of hair, to enlighten the sphere a bit. But yet, she till felt the panic of this weird secret she now had to carry.
“I’ve been searching for you, kind of been stalking you with my AI because you’re kind of hard to find.”
actually dressed to go outside, despite her hair looking the way it should look after waking up. Her hands come to rest on her hips while she stands next to him.
They keep on talking around Peter, but the teenager doesn’t really listen anymore. The words sound faded around him after a while. His head hurts too much to focus on it. After a while, Dr. Cho arrives with a few nurses and a gurney. They put Peter on top of it, and then roll him away towards her office. Peter isn’t really sure about what happens after that. He must have lost consciousness after all, since he suddenly wakes up in a dark room with only the sound of what must be a heart-monitor that fills his ears.
“You know how old my old man was when he had me,” he points out. Rhodey gives him an unimpressed look.
“I didn’t know you were there,” Mr. Stark mutters out. He rolls around until his face is pressed against the pillow. Whatever he says next is muffled, but Peter can still understand it. “I would’ve helped y’out. Would’ve protected her.”
“Whoa- but dad! There’s some things I need to tell you! About these guys robbing a bank, and they had these
Peter laughs for a bit, then. Really, he’s glad he has Harry back in his life. It would have been a lot better had Harry actually been here. He remembers the day the guy announced that he was going to travel. Peter had felt abandoned, then. First Ned, who was leaving for MIT, and then Harry? Holy crap, it was like everybody was just leaving at the same time!
Peter chuckles, and follows his instructions. Meanwhile, as he’s busy, Steve comes to ask what he came for.
“I just saved you from death two days ago and now you don’t even want to listen to me when I tell you that you have a fever! If you want to get even more sick by accidentally cooling yourself off too much, then you should do that when I’m not around!” he barked at her.
Peter shakes his head, not recalling any kind of vacation they used to take. Sometimes, they managed to get themselves to a beach of some sort, but that was never longer than a day, and the drive to there usually took longer than the time they’d spend there.
“Come and catch me, sweetcheeks!” she counters before disappearing completely. Peter swings back up, going after her without any question. He still needs to know what the tritium was for, after all!
“You’re late, Peter,” Tony adds to it. Oh, he doesn’t sound all too happy, today? What happened with the good mood he had on the phone?
It’s the first Christmas with the Starks. Outside, it’s snowing. Children had been playing in the park, building snowmen and throwing snowballs at each other. But nobody at the Stark household has time for that. With May busying herself in the kitchen – she’s the only one who can cook, after all – and Peter and Vision keeping themselves busy with preparing the table, one would think that the roles are pretty well divided.
“Don’t you dare to cry, Charles!” Yaël’s voice skipped as she fought to hold her tears back. Once more the professor took her hands to stop her from scratching herself.
Yaël recognized the tall blonde guy immediately, slowly remembering that Steve had fallen asleep in her sofa last night.
“Now you’re being a dick, I was just trying to help,” Johnny returns. He sounds insulted. Normally, Peter would have regretted his words and apologized. Now, somehow, he feels like he’s just having a bad day and being friendly is not really an option for him right now.
“Wish me luck, shorty!” she then calls out with a wink. Before Peter can even say something in return, she’s already gone into the building, on her way to have a talk with his possible father. Man, that’s all kinds of weird.
“Of course I want you to get off this planet too, but I can’t promise you you’re going back to earth that quickly.” He knew Helvegen wasn’t her home.
He startles when the lights turn on. With the Cat lying on top of him at the verge of pulling his underwear down, Peter realizes she’s not the one who freed them from the dark around them. Confused and a bit worried, Peter turns his head to the side to find who turned on the lights.
“I’ve got FRIDAY looking all around the world for him. Eventually he’ll show up again, and when that happens, you’ll be there to stop him.”
In silence they walk through the hallways, though Vision leaves them halfway with the message that he has an appointment with the Captain. Still, after his departure Wanda doesn’t speak. When they get in the hallway with the bedrooms, Peter actually makes a sound; a surprised gasp.
Damn it, what’s wrong with him? Why does his mind keep on going that direction all the time?! He’s with MJ for crying out loud! He cares about her, not about some masked lady dressed up like a cat and showing her cleavage with every chance she’s got!
“No, according to her Odin is dead. Thor is the new king. They said that, whoever this new enemy is, he threw Thor away into space like he was nothing. Loki then used some leverage to convince him to let everybody go.”
“Will you please then also understand that I love you despite our different views?” Tony continues. Now that he’s calmer, he feels ready to finish this conversation. “Sure, it sucks. It’s going to suck for a little while. But I want you by my side. Only you.”
“C’mon, I’ll get you to a great shop,” she says, taking him by the arm and pulling him along. Peter just follows as she guides him through the streets. When they get to a cross point, they wait for the light to turn red. A short look to the side gives Peter a full view on the newest newspaper from today. With a frown, he detaches himself from Felicia and heads towards it.
“You told me to go,” Steve answers quietly. Is his voice breaking? Did he lose weight, too? Steve looks different in many ways.
Happy makes it in three. By the time they’re there, Tony jumps out of the car, almost stumbling onto his knees in his attempt to run towards the workshop. The suits aren’t in the Tower. They’re Avengers-business, and Tony keeps everything related to the Avengers out of his house. If it was for him, he wouldn’t even be using one of these suits anymore.
“Yaël, how marvellous to see you here alive and well! Where did Loki kidnap you from this time?” Thor huffed, slapping her on her shoulder, hard enough to make her lose her breath. Heck, the man was missing an eye and it looked gross as fuck. Yaël cocked her eyebrow sarcastically.
At least the two men wait to speak until Peter’s out of the door. When Peter sees that the assistant is not nearby, Peter decides to wait for a little moment. He knows it’s not his place, but he finds himself mighty curious.
The stupid idiot that he is; forgetting his pills. It’s normally the first thing he thinks about before leaving… anywhere. In this past half-year, he’s been following his therapy-sessions faithfully, keeping track of the medication schedule he’s given and doing the exercises every day before going to bed. For the past three months, he hasn’t had any
“You’re evil, you know that?” Peter groans internally. Michelle just laughs, throwing her arm over her chair and taking on a casual pose.
Her thoughts wandered off while Brunnhilde brought her to their destination. Wasn’t it weird that with anybody else, like Jason, she’d be freaking out right now? Well, she still was a bit freaking out, because one part of her brain was wondering what was going to happen if Loki ever wanted to get married. But the other part of her brain told her that that was impossible as Loki didn’t even want to call their weird, deformed relationship
To distract herself a bit from her frustrations against Fury, Yaël took her phone back and went on the Wi-fi of the hotel next to the apartment-building. She researched about rosin for her bow and checked the prices for a new cello again. She had already done that a few times and every time she was disappointed again in how pricey these instruments were.
“Okay, we have to leave this planet immediately,” he mumbled to himself. Then he turned around to the forest that cloaked around the lake and sprinted away, still carrying her on his back.
“Oh my god,” somebody, probably Scott, mutters. Everybody’s eyes look up to the spot Scott is pointing at. In turn, Natasha turns around as well. And Tony realizes what they’re looking at. He’s seen it before; a portal made by Strange. But it looks weak, like it’s not stable at all.
Peter doesn’t know who asked the question. All he does is nod and wave away the question, rubbing his forehead as the seconds tick by in his ears.
“You’re kind of talking to yourself, as these things just take over your micro-expressions and the underlying emotions you’re unaware of,” Scott pointed out “You’ve been doing this kind of laborious exercises for days, maybe even weeks already.”
“Pretty handy, no?” he asks. “I’m also kind of connected to the entire internet and the tower’s mainframe. My head is now practically a computer.” Tony taps his head for a bit, giving the others a wide smirk.
There’s a short silence after that before another presence suddenly joins them. Steve turns to look at Yaël holding her child. The kid looks much like how Steve last remembers him, which is obvious since he can’t have grown that much in the past two weeks or so. He’s glad, though, that Yaël is aware that she shouldn’t force the child on him.
She added a smiley after that. Then she sneaked back into his room. Where should she put it down? Probably on his desk. But what Yaël hadn’t been counting on, is that her friend left pieces of lego here and there on the floor. So when she stepped on one, barefoot, as she left her shoes at the front door, she did her best to not start yelling curses. Jeez, who invented these little blocks from hell?! Jumping on one foot, she accidentally stepped on a screwdriver, which rolled away and made her tumble against the floor, knocking her head against Peter’s chair.
Tony shakes his head before offering May a short smile. The woman nods in return. Then she makes her way to the door and leaves them for a little while.
On Christmas Day, he hands Tony the package. And Tony gives him a surprised look as he opens it up, tearing the paper from the glass box and letting his mouth fall open from the surprise he’s seeing in front of him.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if Tony would actually blackmail principal Morita to get me to pass,” Peter jokes, and Ned, too, starts to laugh. The dining hall starts to empty as the students make their way outside for a few more minutes before classes start.
Tony asks. Right now, Peter’s mind is going in overdrive! How is Dad with Steve? How did he get the number? Dad is in Wakanda!
“Tell me about it, he keeps on sneaking up on me,” Peter mutters. While shaking his head, he feels once more that he’s still completely
He knows what Steve is trying to do. He’s not against it, but he’s more… surprised. Carefully pulling Steve’s hand from his hip, he instead lifts his lover’s hand towards his mouth where he can kiss his fingers. Steve sighs against his chest.
“You know, how bad can it be, right?” Steve offers. “Though in that case we should better move it to the tower, instead.”
There’s silence while FRIDAY works. Tony leans forward on the desk, turning his head a bit to the side where he can see his phone lying there, untouched for at least three days already. Is there even still any battery left?
,” Vision states, still grinning widely and, in just a millisecond he aims again, shooting another accurate shot to Yaël’s chest. The girl grunts and groans in frustration.
“Thor is ready,” she tells Loki, before turning to smile at Steve. She’s wearing a beautiful long-sleeved brown-and-blue dress. Her long hair is loose, dark and natural. On her head, she’s wearing some sort of silver crown. Her cape seems to be made of a dark-blue fur of some sort. She looks absolutely gorgeous, as do literally all the women around here. Steve can’t even describe Hilde’s dress. He can’t wait to see Jane’s.
His arrival at school has been met with some looks from his fellow students. He’s sure that the video Flash shared online has something to do with that. So far, though, nobody has pointed it out to him, mostly because he’s been hiding away behind his hood.
"You two are gross, okay," he complains. Tony just smirks at him. Steve has his hand in front of his eyes, shaking his head in defeat.
Steve and Tony re-emerge from Tony’s bedroom, now with Tony fully dressed in a mix of casual and formal clothes. Steve still looks the same, wearing his hoodie and faded jeans. His arms are hanging next to his body, eyes sad while looking at Tony, who is frowning in return.
But he’s not; he’s not a Stark, he only shares the same blood with one. Had he been born in normal circumstances, sure, he’d be Peter Stark instead of Peter Parker. But it is what it is now; Peter can call himself Mr. Stark’s son all he wants, he’ll always stay a Parker.
“You know she wants to start with kids? She’s refused to get any more birth-controlled materials in the house.”
The receptionists are right in the middle of the room, and on the sides there are waiting-stools for the people who made appointments. There’s one big staircase that leads to the first floor, and there are about six elevators that go up. Peter wonders if all of them go to the Penthouse on the top.
“It’s mom’s journals, about the time she got to meet dad. Did you know that she and Mr. Stark were good friends?” Aunt May’s eyes open wide and she grabs the journal out of his hands to take a look at it herself.
So he starts to read the one he suspects is the very first of them all, putting the other ones back into the box without watching. The cap driver asks if it’s alright if he puts on some music, and Peter holds his thumb up.
“Iron Daddy and his Wonderteam showed up to save the day!” Wade chattered happily, his eyes glued to the TV-screen.
Peter doesn’t thank him, because Johnny’s already closed the door back behind him. While the game is still paused, he reaches next to him, grabbing for his phone. But it’s then that he remembers throwing it across the room.
With the night shifting back into the day, the first thing Tony Stark realizes is that it’s begun to rain. Standing in front of the old Parker-house, he looks up into the sky where he allows the drops to fall down on his face. A smile comes up.
“Of course. By the way, Steve wanted to see you,” Natasha says while taking Tony’s prototypes. Pepper notices immediately how Tony jumps up after she’s spoken.
Instead he buys himself a hot dog, sits down on a dry but still cold bench, and continues his mother story, finding she picked up a few weeks after she left off with a bang.
It takes a few more seconds for Peter to catch up. After that he smiles widely, taking the phone and watching his father walk back to Steve. Once the two have their arms wrapped around each other again, Peter dials Yael’s and Wade’s numbers, feeling like everything is finally back to normal.
Tony lifts up a hand and rubs his chin nervously while averting his eyes. The floor looks nice, though Tony wonders who ever thought it was a good idea to bring carpet here. It’s just begging for allergic reactions, especially with all those fossils of the board.
It looks a bit different than when it was built back in 2012. There had been so much talk about the opening of Stark Tower, but then after that whole Alien Invasion, it had to be rebuilt again so soon after it was made.
But in between asking for a few of the personal questions – nobody reveals too much, of course – it’s Steve who steals the spotlight when he announces right then on the spot that he’s in a relationship with Tony.
Peter nods, indeed remembering it all. Aunt May smiles a bit, but it’s not entirely out of happiness.
“That’s too bad,” Peter returns, then remembering that he’s supposed to be shocked about that bit of revelation. “Wait, uh, you have a son?!”
“You love Steve, don’t you?” he asks. Tony’s eyes then move up to Steve, who is trying to make himself look small next to Peter. Without daring to look up, he starts fumbling with his fingers. Peter reaches out to stop him.
The next day, Yaël woke up by noises coming from the kitchen. Did someone break in again? Anyone could simply walk into the building and picking a lock wasn’t exactly something someone needed to study for. She jumped out of bed and opened her bedroom door as silently as possible.
“So did I, until they found him in the Ice back in 2012.” Tony sighs when he thinks back of that time. Oh, how they just couldn’t stand each other back then. It’s almost criminal…
“Go, Eddie! Get out of here!” Peter shouts at him. He doesn’t wait to see if he actually follows through, instead jumping into the air and webbing himself up against another building. Then, using even more web, he slings towards the next building. It takes a couple of seconds for him to finally reach the top of the building. Then, carefully, he inches closer to the web, taking in the situation in front of him.
Peter’s still in his suit when he wakes up in his bed. He groans, already hating the headache before he even opens his eyes. There’s a nasty feeling in his stomach, the stench of alcohol strong on him.
JARVIS suddenly says. Tony is just ready to listen what he want to tell him when suddenly the doors burst open.
Around seven in the evening – which means they’ve been here for eleven freaking hours – they announce that they’re finished for today. While Peter thinks they’ve made no progress at all, Sue and Reed seem to agree that things go much better than they would have expected. Sure, there’s some arguing. Mostly Sam and Rhodey getting up their arguments and disagreeing all the time, followed by Johnny Storm – who reminds Peter a little bit of Steve, but more with his Dad’s character traits, if that’s possible? – and then Ben. Wade adds a few comments, but nobody is really sure why he’s even here.
Traveling to London by a private plane, they arrive there only just in time for the funeral. They’re all immensely jetlagged, and nobody’s really ready to have a serious – or not-serious, for that matter – conversation. The first thing they do when they land is to take a cab, and head towards the church it’s happening.
him that this was stupid. His mind reminded him of this as well. His freaking heart just needed to have closure with his best friend.
“OR WHAT?! YOU’LL GROUND ME? NEWS FLASH, YOU MAY BE MY FATHER, BUT YOU’RE NOT MY DAD. YOU DON’T GET TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO!”
“You’re living in the twenty-first century, Steve. It doesn’t matter anymore who you’re in love with, as long as that person is a legal adult. Let the past go. I know you grew up going to church and that you still do a small prayer in your head every time you start eating dinner. I know that you had to ramble your prayers before you could sit down at school and I know you still have a cross hanging somewhere hidden in your room. But don’t you think you’ve got the whole message wrong?” Yaël rattled.
“You know I like to push you around a bit, Yaël,” he said while walking out of the automatic doors, leading back to the streets. Oh, Yaël surely knew what he meant.
Yaël was looking up to her beautiful mother again, who was looking down on her with a smile while they were dancing. The firefly-ish insects filled the night with all different colours. All that the little Yaël of course noticed was that her mother didn’t only sing in Norse for the sun, but also about Elves in the meadow.
“Your dad? But I thought your parents died?” Gwen asks in confusion. She leans down to take her mask back from the ground, keeping it in her hands as she looks at Peter in confusion.
Loki somehow managed to get to her without falling down ten times, by grabbing everything he could hold on to. “Don’t try to get up,” he yelled through the loud rumbling of the ship. “You’ll fall back down immediately!”
Thor gasps, pretending like he's insulted. Hilde and Bruce roll their eyes as he starts up another explanation on how there's no way they could win from them. Nobody listens anymore, instead waiting for Tony to pull up the boxes and open them.
Eventually it’s time to continue. They pick up right where they left off. Everybody throws in their notes, but Peter and the others of his age stay silent. They’re not experienced enough to know what exactly they’re supposed to say.
Another chill passes through him, but being on edge almost constantly it’s pretty much exhausted. With barely a millisecond’s notice, Peter is pushed against the wall, staring straight into an angry Black Widow’s face, the gun pressed against his neck as she holds him skillfully.
What? Some random girl just called Yaël out of Peter’s league?! They were clearly drunk too. Damn, and they didn’t even know what happened after that party…
kids? How is this possible?! Tony almost feels like a whole part of his life has been a lie all along, and he doesn’t know why. To be fair, Steve never really
The story takes place after Ultron and Ant-Man, but before Dr. Strange or Civil War. Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage are already runing around somewhere there.
“Shards? Peter? What happened, are you alright?” he asks, a bit worried. He sounds genuinely scared, and that’s enough to make Steve nervous on the spot.
Tony escapes from the medical floor exactly at noon, after they’ve served him his lunch. Tony finishes the plate, put it all down on the nightstand, and then takes his crutches and hurries into the hallway. The nurses are busy, there are no doctors, and there’s nobody there to stop him. He’s too good at his, anyway. The amount of times he’s escaped from medical in the past are countless.
Peter wasn’t sure how to answer that, so he didn’t. He kept his mouth shut about it and changed the subject.
“It’s okay, sir,” Yaël said as she put her hand on his shoulder, a bit troubled by the IV. “I had to remember it somehow, right? It’s a part of me… Now, can somebody help me out of this bed?”
Peter puts a hand on her cheek, trying to turn her head so he can listen to her breathing. After confirming that she is in fact still getting her air, he leans back a bit in relief. It’s then that he notices something in her hand.
Johnny is at the verge of heading out when Peter arrives back home. Peter hesitates on just letting him head out already. He might have been an asshole towards him earlier, but surely Johnny is not one to hold grudges, right?
“Who do you live with?” Tony asks, wondering who had taken him in after Mary and Richard’s death. Tony still can’t really believe that she’s not here anymore. He feels like his body is real close to just crying, but he chokes it up for a little bit longer. The kid doesn’t need to see this.
There’s the exact same computer there, along with a wireless phone. The desk is in the middle of the room, which is illuminated by the natural light of the day. The blinds are open, and the curtains pulled to the side. On the desk, there are some folders that read ‘Avenger Initiative’. Peter decides not to be nosy and doesn’t look into them.
“Stark, I know how to get you back in time,” Wade calls out without really answering Charles. Tony’s almost afraid to hear what he’s got, but right now he’s about ready to hear every possibility, even if it’s from Wade Wilson.
Then Peter starts running. Running towards the window, throwing all his weight onto it. It shatters under him, cutting a bit through the suit and slashing his skin here and there. What hurts more is the impact of himself against the glass before it breaks. For a moment, he’s breathless, taking a second or two to recover.
“It was perfect,” Steve returns. Thor then lets out a relieved sigh, walking up towards Steve and pulling him up on his feet. Then, all of the sudden, there are two extremely strong arms pulling him into a hug that steals the breath out of Steve’s lungs.
“I wouldn’t know, Tony. He’s always where he shouldn’t be,” she sighs while rolling her eyes. Tony laughs. Peter leans forward again, finally catching a glimpse of Johnny Storm standing there with Aunt Sharon and a few other people from SHIELD.
Peter leaves the house as quickly as he came, making his way to the park. When he sees Iron Man fly by again, he can see he’s carrying Cap with him. There’s probably something happening again, but he figures they can handle it without him, right? They’ve done so for years before he ever became a hero.
“G-Goblin,” Peter stutters out, watching how the other Avengers are busy trying to hold him back. He can’t really focus on his previous best friend flying around like that, but he’s just too fast for his hurting brain.
He walks the few blocks needed before he can finally catch a glimpse of the center that has been formed a few years ago. The name ‘FEAST’ stands proudly on the building. Miles remembers reading all about it when it was only just founded by Peter Stark and Martin Li, the latter being a philanthropist who showed interest in Stark’s cause and insisted on helping out. Since then, the center has quite grown into a great organization.
“I got your painkiller here, honey,” Steve says, holding up the glass of water towards his partner, who eyes it with disgust.
“A couple of you should head back and take care of that symbiote possessing your kid. But be careful, it might seem compliant now, but when you get it off it’ll try to escape. Don’t let it out.”
“I’m starting to see he’s no longer listening to you,” he jokes out hesitantly. Yaël, too, laughs. After that she joins Wade, Wanda and Vision on the couch. Ned and Harry have found their spot behind the TV-screen, controllers in their hands as they start up a Mario Kart game. Peter is just about to get to them when he sees another figure arrive in the garden.
Peter sighs, allowing May to hook her arm into Peter’s and make him follow Steve and Clint, since they’re about the only ones who know the way. May, feeling like a complete tourist, already has her phone at the ready to take some snapshots. Rhodey and Bruce are walking ahead of them, deep in discussion about old traditional Viking weddings. Peter’s pretty sure Thor’s not a Viking, but he doesn’t really care enough to correct them. Bruce has enough PhD’s to figure that out, he states.
Little lights twinkled everywhere around her as Yaël saw her mom dance in circles on an open, grassy spot in the forest. The lights were insects, like fireflies, but the species on Helvegen shone out way more colors, like blue, soft pink and purple, which reflected beautifully in her one brown and one grey eye. Unlike the armor-ish stuff or pants she usually wore, her mom was wearing a long, flowy, white dress. Agostina was humming a song. She had told Yaël long ago that it was about the sun.
“Are you crazy?!” Tony shouts back, only to suddenly be pulled away by something. On the spot where he was just standing, a metal desk comes flying by, only barely missing him. Looking at the person that got him out of that situation, he’s faced with Peter who is looking at him worriedly.
“That’ll surely end up well,” Pepper mutters. Tony agrees with that. He gets up from the couch to check on his suddenly-infant son. Peter’s drooling once again, eyes closed, and small hands balled into tiny fists. Tony can’t help but reach out a finger towards him, feeling Peter’s reflexes come up the moment he presses into the middle of his handpalm. He can’t help but grin.
“When your friend almost died for what feels like the hundredth time, one would feel compelled to hug said friend, no?” she says with a light smirk on her face. Tony blinks once before telling his body to pull back the suit. It doesn’t hurt as the nanites sink back into Tony’s bones. That’s a good thing; if it had hurt all the time the way it did when injecting it, Tony would surely have it all removed on the same fucking day.
“We can’t help you if you won’t let us, Tony,” Steve adds. “You scared the kid. I don’t know why he suddenly got into your radar, but in some way you must care for him. Think of how he must have felt to see his idol in that position?”
“Dude, it was movie-material. Hollywood would’ve loved you,” she says with a wink. “If you’re done being a superhero, you should try it out.”
Yaël waited until the guards had brought her some food, because, hey, free food. And this way the guards would stay away for a little while. After she was finished, Yaël walked towards the door and inspected the lock. Then she tried steering air through it and moved her finger to mimic the air opening the lock. As if it was a wonder, the rectangular doorknob moved. Holy shit, did she manage to do that from the first try?
“I’m going to fix this now,” he says, trying to sound more assured than he feels. Steve just gives him a sad look while pressing his lips together.
FRIDAY responds. Peter sighs again before pulling his hood back up. He doesn’t know why he does it, it’s not even that cold.
“No, m’am,” he responds, though still lightly smirking. Peter wonders if he’s imagining the bit of green in Harry’s blue eyes.
“Director, this is Iron Man. He’s interested on joining the team,” Steve tries to introduce Tony. He sounds a whole lot different from when he was talking to Sharon. He’s got his acting point back up.
“I didn’t say you did… You did nothing wrong actually,” he said while typing a text. When he had send it, he repeated “Wait here” and ran back inside.
It’s a never-ending battle. Whenever Peter thinks he’s almost got it, he just ends up right back at the beginning with an even worse headache for it. His last fight isn’t helping him, and after a few minutes his back is already aching, still not healed from the hard blow he’s gotten during that battle with him and one of Hammer’s rogue androids – and of course he got another warning from the Avengers, telling him to stay away from the danger.
“Great! I mean, oh no wait… I have to work tomorrow.” Crap, how was it possible that she was able to keep forgetting her job? When mister Xavier didn’t answer, Yaël quickly added: “But I guess I can call my boss to ask a day off.” Diego would be so mad at her for letting him know an evening in advance. Oh, and for skipping two days in one week. Well, Yaëlwill feel it when she’ll get her loan.
He’s lived quite a life, if he has to say so himself. People often tell him that he has nothing to complain, that he’s had life handed to him on a golden platter or whatever else it is that people say about him. And in a big part he agrees with those people.
“FRIDAY, override code B498-1-Stark-J-543,” he says, knowing the code by heart even though he’s only read it once. His heart is already beating faster than it should in the situation; especially when he promised himself he would only use this one in case of danger.
“I know you slept with several women while we were still together,” Yaël pointed out. Loki turned to her with a rush, looking alarmed.
On his way to the interview, Peter has thought about how his talk with Mr. Stark would have gotten. His mind had gone over a casual conversation to him eventually interviewing Mr. Stark instead to figure out what kind of man he is.
“Well, uh,” Peter mutters, a bit breathless while he swings around. “Have I been going on patrol during the nights often lately?”
The smartest way to cope with Loki’s silence had always been waiting for him to talk about it. So instead of asking questions, she simply gave him some directions on how to put on the bandages.
“Nah, you’re right. That’s surely not the best way to tell him. After all, he’ll probably not even believe me, right?”
There’s somebody stroking his hair. Soft, slim fingers, moving over his scalp in such a loving gesture. Peter doesn’t want to open his eyes, yet, enjoying the feeling too much for now. He lifts up a hand to put above the one on his head.
MJ literally growls at him, snapping her teeth together in the direction of his hands. Venom pulls back, a loud laugh thundering through the square.
“Well, at least I asked you to stay on the ship, so you can’t blame me for pulling you into this fight.”
All he can feel is this guilt; he’s dealt with it before, but now that his actions have affected somebody close to him – someone who might as well have been his brother – he’s almost close to just ripping his hair out in anger.
Yet, still, Steve had found himself feeling weird around the man. Right from the moment that Stark had opened up those brown eyes, after appearing dead for a full, dreadful minute, only to be scared awake by the Hulk, Steve had felt weird.
There was music playing through her headphones, but all Yaël could think about was the song she always used to contact Raido. Too bad there wasn’t a version of it to put on her music player. The walls to her side indicated a graveyard behind them. For a second, Yaël stared through the gates, looking at the graves.
Natasha, who seemed to be getting closer to Bruce. Sitting at the sidelines, Steve was having a full view of seeing whatever was going on there blooming. She would join them the most, leaning over Bruce’s shoulder and pointing at his screen while he tried to explain to her what he was doing.
She shakes her head, trying to get her head free from this sudden spaced-out stance. Then she hurries towards the bathroom. Because what does it even matter, right? It’s
Stones, she was in a forest, there are stones and rocks. Her lungs itched as she stumped a foot against the bottom glass plate. She shoved her feet apart from each other and bended her knees. As she quickly launched her fist into the air, she heard the dirt outside the cage, in front of the man, split open. Calmly, he took a step backwards with his hands against his back, to stay out of the reach of the giant rock she pulled out of the ground, like he had seen her doing that trick a million times before.
Peter frowns. He doesn’t know what that means. Or maybe he does, but he doesn’t want to understand it. That would mean it’s reality.
“Oh shit,” Yaël mumbled, she looked around while rubbing her sore hands and could finally breathe again.
“Good talk,” he then says, taking his plate back in hands and standing up. “Now I’ll go search actual
They’re fighting again. It’s not as bad as during their break, usually about stupid things. Tony’s mostly frustrated that he’s not really and Avenger anymore – his decision, though he doesn’t particularly like it, either. Steve, on the other hand, still has to deal with Tony Stark, the inventor who has irregular sleeping patterns and is about the very definition of impulsiveness. If Tony would even go to sleep, it’s a miracle. Even more so if he would
Natasha is quiet most of the way. She just has her arm crossed into Peter’s, but her hands in the pockets of her coat. They look like quite the weird pair, since she’s obviously older than he is. Peter shudders at the thought of people thinking they would be together. Nat has become some sort of Aunt to him, in a way. It would feel extremely weird to think anything else about it.
“Mary Parker, the first woman I loved. We were good friends, but I screwed it up,” Tony explains. When Steve stays quiet, he takes that as his cue to start explaining.
“You know, at least we used protection,” she says dryly, swinging the thing in her hand around a bit before throwing it into the bin. Peter, once again, groans and throws his head back.
“Even though I was almost certain I was going to die at my best friend’s hand, I didn’t want to give up. I
By the time she gets back out, Steve and Tony are still going at it. She keeps her eyes away from them, instead heading back to Peter as quickly as she could.
I've been watching Jessica Jones again, and I really really REALLY feel the need to add her into this story one way or another. I really love her character, and I think she would be hilarious in combination with Peter (what with her constant glooming and Peter's hyperactivity). I need to figure that out.
“Peter!” they both call out. Peter squeezes his eyes shut, shaking his head while he fights to stay in dreamland. He gives up the fight when his eyes open up.
“Alright, pass him through,” he tells her. Then he waits for a few seconds, at least until he can hear that he’s allowed to speak. While he waits, he cracks his neck loose and shakes his shoulders a bit, preparing himself for this mentally.
Peter looks down at what small bit he can see of his black suit. He then shrugs, not really intending to give it that much of his attention. So his suit is black? So what! Tony’s suits went from red and gold to red and silver for a while! It’s not that big of a deal, right?
Tony stays quiet, raising an eyebrow towards him. Peter tries not to flinch when he once again looks at the bruise on his eye.
The two look at it, but soon enough, Tony turns his attention towards Steve, seeing the other man’s reaction to it.
Peter sags his shoulders, suddenly ashamed. “That first part’s true I’m afraid, though I do have a very reasonable explanation for it. As for that second part; who is kicking my ass?”
“Do you want me to lie, or to tell me the truth?” Tony jokes. Rhodey just groans, rolling his eyes while looking away. Then after a long moment of silence, he turns back to the screen while holding up a finger.
“You don’t need revealing dresses to look pretty, Yaël.” He had a point there, didn’t he? Or was he complimenting her? He was! He meant that she didn’t have to look like a prostitute to be attractive, right?
Uh, that didn’t sound so good. But Yaël nodded, too confused to realize that Steve wasn’t able to see that through the phone.
It must be the smallest dossier in the history of dossiers, sinceYaël didn’t seem to get the right to learn about herself. Professor X had told her that they’d all work together to help her with her missing memories.
“Peter, are you alright?!” she asks, sounding worried. There’s a hand on his head, and another one on his shoulder.
“Yeah, sure, he kicked its ass before it could get to you, but had he been a small bit too late, you wouldn’t even have been here anymore.”
“Uh, thanks, dad?” Peter says nervously, not even bothering to tell him not to tinker around with his stuff anymore; he knows it’s no use. Tony doesn’t say anything, only shortly passing his eyes over Peter’s half-naked state before letting it roll over to Ned standing there, looking star struck. While he’s met Tony before in the past two months, he keeps on getting speechless around him.
Yaël suddenly felt a soft flutter inside her head, it was almost impossible to notice, but she had learned to recognize it since the professor crept into her brain frequently after they both went through her traumas together.
And Tony is quiet as he talks. He hums and nods at the right occasions, and once Peter’s finished he clears his throat before helping him come up with a plan to get this stuff together.
“Uh, I’ve been living with Charles for about two weeks and because I didn’t have an income, he made me a teacher.”
“Sorry you had to hear all that, Peter,” Steve says, giving Peter a small smile. The teenager smiles in return and just shrugs, keeping his mouth shut as Mr. Stark rolls his chair forward to start marking things up again.
Wade also elected some sort of silky, Bordeaux dress and a velvet, blush one. These were all clothes Yaël was sure she would never wear, but she wanted to please Wade as he looked so proud every time she fitted one of them. Next to these, she also got some new pairs of jeans, shirts and sneakers. “Jeez, are you teaching these kids how to become nuns or something?” Wade asked while she was paying her stuff.
“Yeah, well… I don’t know, guess it hasn’t really gotten through yet,” Tony says. He’s immensely aware of what exactly has changed in his life now. Mary
“Who are you?” Peter asks, keeping his hands up in a gesture that tells her she should keep her distance. It seems like it doesn’t stop her at all as she takes a few more steps forward. She has a big grin on her full lips, and her green eyes look playful. She looks vaguely familiar, but… Peter can’t just place where he must know her from.
.” After that, Peter hangs up. Steve’s already in the hallway, not caring if he’s waking everybody else up with his heavy footsteps. T’Challa’s room is on the floor above them, and it’s surrounded with security. But Steve expects they’ll let him in if he asks, right?
“Of course they did,” he says. “They have me as relationship therapist, after all.” Afterwards he moves away from the table and joins his father at the buffet. “Everything went alright?” he asks, just to be sure. Tony turns to him with his empty plate in his hand, the smile on his lips genuine for the first time in a long while.
While Peter speaks, Wade starts walking to the water and throws out some bread towards the little ducks, who happily fish out whatever he gives them. So, to be clear on this, Wade asked them to come to the park… to feed the ducks?
“Did, uh, did you know? About me being Peter’s father?” Tony suddenly finds himself asking, curious for the answer. May clears her throat a bit, not looking away from Peter in the bed.
But before Bucky can get to Clint, he falls down face-first on the ground. He doesn’t move, instead starting to snore. Clint, soon after that, falls asleep as well. Natasha and Hilde simultaneously agree that the game is over, both laughing at the pathetic men around them.
“Stop joking around, Tony. What happened?” Steve asks, clearly unimpressed by his attempt to lighten things up. Tony just takes a deep breath, and his eyes drop onto his hands; they are scraped and bloody. He’s probably been punching the wall or something…
Well, sort of… he’s not really sure how to call them since he doesn’t really have much contact with them – or well, he mostly just ignores Wade’s request for a quicky after a battle in the future. In any way, he’s sure that he could go to the weird purple-haired girl he’s come to call ‘friend’ so quickly after meeting her. It’s quite strange.
“You had a panic attack, FRIDAY called me,” Steve explains calmly. He puts a hand behind Tony’s back and suddenly the man is sitting up again. When did he fall down on the ground?
That same day, it was parent-teacher conference day at the school, so she had to work late. Not that any of the parents wanted to meet the arts-teacher, she wasn’t important enough. Yet, she worked in that school and if all her colleagues needed to stay, she did it too as she was a part of the team. Team-spirit, yeah! So Yaël sat in her classroom, whole alone, for hours, just doodling a bit and playing some cello. Not that she was angry about that, the itching and stinging of her wounds were annoying her, so she appreciated that lack of parents who expected her to have a happy chitchat.
“We need more than three of them, Tony. We have enough people that are prepared to evaluate their progress, you won’t even have to be much of a part of it.”
“I told you exactly what was bothering me, and you know it!” Tony shouts back, pointing his finger towards Steve and standing up. Steve, too, gets back on his feet. Peter looks up in alarm.
“You know, I had this crazy sudden urge to go fishing in Washington today. Had even bought a little boat and some fishing equipment, invited Rhodey along but of course he was on another mission with the president after that SHIELD-stuff and all,” Stark had started, walking up towards the bed to take a look at the charts. “What are the odds, though, of me finding this dinner plate on the bottom of the lake?”
Peter only met Jane Foster after Thanos’ defeat. She’d been put into hiding along with Dr. Selvig, Darcy and Dr. Cho and had only been allowed out afterwards. And while their first introduction had been short, it’s close to being one of the most memorable things in his life.
And he’s right. Twenty minutes after that, there’s a knock on the door. Tony storms up, opens it, and before he can get out a greeting Steve’s lips are once again pressed against his. Tony closes his eyes, shuts the door with his foot without moving another inch of his body, and just revels in the kiss.
Tony sighs, but still doesn’t respond. He closes his eyes shortly, but immediately opens them again, thinking back of the look Peter had in his eyes when he lashed out at him.
“Get over this crap, Stark,” Tony mutters to his reflection. Nervously, he starts rubbing the scar on his sternum again. He pulls away the moment his fingers touch the new scar. Right, they’re overlapping now. Tony groans, starting up the water and grabbing his bottle of pills. They’re supposed to prevent rejection of the organ, but he would think the liver is so righteous for it to be rejected.
Tony doesn’t seem to think it’s too bad, claiming that “as long as your clothes were still on, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.” Though that isn’t helping him at all. Peter just rather spends the entire day on the couch, hating himself for ever going to that party. Tony leaves him be, but he likes to make him know that it’s his ow fault for feeling like this.
“I, uh, I don’t really dance,” Peter says awkwardly. MJ shakes her head before leaning forward, pressing her lips against his ears.
“You, stay out of this!” the guy whose gun Peter stole shouts. In turn, he takes out his knife and holds it out dangerously towards Peter, about ready to stab him.
“Cut the crap, Tony, how bad is it?” Steve asks, throwing his own helmet on the ground next to Tony, along with his shield. When he’s kneeling down as well, he takes Tony’s face into his hands to inspect him. “Can you see me clearly?”
Peter waits for Karen to hang up on the call before letting out a long breath. His heart is still beating fast, but this time for a whole different reason. He can’t believe
Now, the idea of having another child to worry about, to risk seeing dead if they couldn’t get there in time… Tony can’t even think about it. He wipes away a few tears, wishing he could just forget about that whole thing. What matters now is that Peter’s alive; he’s in the compound, having a little party of his own. He’s having fun.
He can’t do it to this Tony. He holds up his ‘I’m fine-‘mask, but Peter has learned to read through it. He can see immediately that this Tony’s not doing fine. This is a Tony who still has alcohol on the table. A Tony who has this haunted look in his eyes, his shoulders sagged, his messy workspace… This is not a Tony that needs even more bad news.
The ceremony on its own is wonderful. Steve can’t get enough of Asgard, due to the fact that everybody here just speaks so beautifully it makes Steve feel like he’s just ended up in one of those old movies. Heimdall talks about old traditions, about Odin, his love for Frigga, and his love for his children.
“Yeah, well, this super-genius should be getting information on this Black Cat-lady Peter talked about.” Tony pulls back at last, getting out of Steve’s embrace and finally leaving the bed. He limps towards the window, leaning a hand against it, and almost automatically FRIDAY removes the blinds, revealing the city of New York underneath them;
with MJ. It sounds wrong in all the possible ways. Not that he can’t imagine never sleeping with MJ, but… she just… Peter’s never really made that big of a deal of sex. He’s only ever been with Gwen before, and then there was that slight slip-up after that party that nobody ever talks about. And sure, his previous medication used to keep him on some sort of constant edge that he’s managed to ignore for a long while.
“Jahnnaaay!” somebody shouts. A guy with a bottle of beer in his hands walks up to Johnny and gives him that typical guy-hug where they slap each other on the shoulder with their chests barely touching each other. Peter snorts, wondering when it became that he started to think like this?
“I’m Peter,” he says. “I know this is going to sound weird and you’re both probably not going to believe me, but… I’m going to be your relationship therapist right now.”
And given Steve’s fury, Tony’s sure he’ll want and kill the monster before he can ever try and set foot on Earth.
They hadn’t come on between when they heard her neighbor had fought about drugs with a dealer in the hallway, either. Luckily, only a few of Wade’s shots got through the floor, but Yaël didn’t know how to explain this all to Fury. He’d be so pissed.
“Remember the Stark Expo back in Queens? Six years ago? Ben and I took you after you kept on begging us to take you for an entire month. It cost us quite a lot of money, too.”
“Just tell me,” Steve whispers against his neck while they’re on the bed. Tony has a projection of his latest project in front of him. He has his fingers on the holographic keyboard, everything written down in a secret code that even Steve doesn’t know about. Living with his competition, he needs to take special measures to keep him from peeking.
Tony feels sadness going through him, just like every time whenever he’s reminded of Peggy’s current condition. There are moments in which she’s completely aware of what is happening and can talk perfectly about what is happening in the current time, but there’s also moments where she’s constantly pulled back into the past.
I might have some good news: I'm almost finished writing the story. The chapter updates might go up from two chapters a week to maybe three or four!
Oh, please no. Not another reminder that he’s got an angry friend who refuses to text him back. He doesn’t need that, at all.
Peter stays quiet. What can he really say? It’s a good sign, right? That Tony is in Siberia to help Steve. That means that he’s over their misunderstanding, no? Peter knows Tony wouldn’t just take flying to a whole other country far away lightly – especially not after the accords.
“Maybe you have the flue or maybe you feel that I need to take a shower.” Yaël said as she looked at herself in the mirror and curled her nose, trying to ignore her sight that was shaking once more.
He’s actually feeling excited right now; knowing all of the answers. Everybody is on a roll – except for Flash, who isn’t really all that great at all. Ned is somewhere in the back with the excuse to be reading a very fascinating book. In fact, he’s just making sure that the guys they’ve been tracking haven’t just started moving again.
“No, no I don’t, I just- my friend, my, uh roommate, he needs- he, uh… there’s someone at the house I don’t want to leave alone with him and, uh…”
Right now, Tony sometimes still asks for stories. And she’ll repeat some she’s already told years ago, still thinking Tony to be that small kid she took care of on some occasions. Tony never reminds her of the years that have passed, scared of shocking her.
Peter’s head shoots up in surprise, eyes boring into Ned’s guilty and squirming form, like the guy is trying to dig himself a hole to escape through the floor.
The picture is in black and white, but he can just easily imagine the bright purple color of her hair. Though, due to a long time away it seems like the brown is already coming back. She looks like she’s been into battle, wearing a suit that makes her look ready for the arena. Tony takes a deep breath, remembering what it is she could do.
seem happier than before. His eyes are closed, and his lips are curled up into a small smile. He looks content. “So, uh, you’re staying over?”
So it seemed this man was guarding her too, but he didn’t notice the missing cage, like it was still there, like Yaël never even used her powers. He just sat there, frowning at the screen of his tablet. It reminded Yaël to her last dream, when Cap didn’t notice the rain. Maybe her memories overlaid in this dream-world, but it was freaking confusing her. What parts of this dream belonged together? The man had dark hair, a goatee and dark eyes. His knee went up and down nervously.
He closes his eyes, tries to sleep. It doesn’t come. He hears the machinery from all the rooms around him. The nurse of the night walks around, controlling all of her patients. She comes into his room once in a while to check his parameters, or change his IV bag. Tony can count it up to three times until he figures that it’s morning again. Feeling exhausted, he wonders why he couldn’t sleep. It’s not like he hasn’t been trying, but his mind is just too full.
He goes on and on, talking about how much he wants nothing more than to be with Steve again, but how he feels like he doesn’t deserve it, anymore. The tears don’t roll out of his eyes over his cheeks, but it’s a close call. Tony, after he finishes, takes his cup of coffee and lifts it up to his mouth.
“Let me give you the number of my therapist so you can call her whenever you feel like it,” Peter said when he noticed Yaël wasn’t going to give him a crossed reply and she stopped counterworking. Yaël sighed and noticed she started scratching her one hand with the other one again. She fluttered her hands to make them stop, but Peter was a way too observant guy.
‘It’s okay, we can’t change it now,” Peter mutters. He sighs once more and pushes himself off the bed to look outside the window and into the city. They’re high up, and from here everything looks peaceful enough. “We should just… go do what we came here to do.”
They both lean forward after that, lips almost touching, when suddenly a loud crash comes up in another room. The two pull apart in surprise, looking at the closed door and almost expecting somebody to come running in.
“Dude, what’s your problem?” Flash asks, holding up his hands in surrender. It doesn’t seem to stop Eddie.
“Both,” Peter nodded. “No offense, by the way, I mean, you look great for your age! Eh, nice to finally meet you and, eh, wow!” Peter rattled, his cheeks turned red.
exactly he’s supposed to be here. His mentor? His father?  When he turns to give Mr. Stark a questioning look, all he gets in return is a frown and a whole lot of frustration.
“You’re finally here.” Tony smiles, unwilling to pull their faces apart. He wipes a tear away from Steve’s cheeks.
Peter scoffs, thinking of how this is mostly what the Avengers keep on saying to him. He’ll show then what he’s worth; he fought off the lizard on his own, didn’t he? Or Electro? And he did that without the help of all the Avenger’s high-tech toys.
That wonder, that confusion in Felicia’s voice. Peter’s not sure if she’s actually that naïve, or if she’s faking it. If she is, she’s a really good actress, but nobody can really be this innocent, can they?
,” she says. Peter can’t blame her, she mentioned once before that comforting people isn’t something she’s good at, at all. She explained how she’s always afraid to make it worse by saying something wrong, or whatever. Peter doesn’t hold it against her; just once more he’s proving how a horrible friend he is. Can’t even act normal to have a serious talk with the girl.
