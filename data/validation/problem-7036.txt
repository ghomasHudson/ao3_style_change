time. They’d tried to meet up like a bazillion times, texting each other back and forth with suggestions on when and where and how to meet. And after weeks trying to come up with a time when both of them wouldn’t be busy, he couldn’t help but wonder how they’d ever managed to hook up in the first place.
He’d secretly been glad that the scandal at the gala had stopped Steve from asking any more questions about registration, but now, he simply felt tired of keeping secrets. It was no use anyway, he wouldn’t find a solution all by himself. All he could do now, was to try to solve the problem with Steve by his side.
Once asleep, there was usually very little that stirred Steve to consciousness. He had always been a heavy sleeper, and therefore, he found it rather surprising when the sound of a door opening and closing had him instantly alert.
“I could’ve done without that information,” a foreign voice said, effectively making Tony bolt out of Steve’s grasp and off the bed as if spurred by a sudden jolt of electricity. With a single thought, his body was fully encased in the Iron Man armor, faceplate shutting down in front of him, repulsors at the ready.
A shudder went through Tony’s body, because he knew very well that they might never get there. That he wouldn’t allow himself to take that step. That this might be one of those divergences that were caused during time travel. And Steve—
Steve glanced to Tony where he sat slumped over his still-filled Shawarma plate. He looked just as exhausted as Steve felt, and Steve could see how far his thoughts had drifted off.
,” Steve answered, though he slowly realized that Tony was merely reciting things that he already knew.
He knew Stark Industries was solely in the business of producing weapons. During the war, they’d made a lot of money, and Steve had always admired the company for protecting those soldiers as best as they could, and yet… He also knew about the destructiveness and the shadiness of the business.
Their gazes held for a minute longer before Tony turned over on his back, stretching luxuriously. Almost instantly, Steve’s eyes travelled to the skin of Tony’s abdomen where a light patch of hair travelled down into Tony’s jeans.
“And right now, you’re trying to run away too,” Tony continued, “which—as Natasha so kindly put it—apparently makes both of us the most emotionally stunted persons on this planet.”
“Yes,” he said. “And hey, you’re a good-looking guy,” he waved at him with a grin, “all that red skin, and the gem in your head, very 70s. Who wouldn’t want that.”
“Ha ha.” Steve grabbed the pillow next to him and hurled it right at Bucky’s face. Of course, he snapped it right out of the air with his metal arm, shooting Steve a shit-eating grin.
Shifting his weight a little to get an idea of his general condition, Steve didn’t feel any ill effects from the pollen. Absolutely none. He frowned, thinking that it was a bit strange. At the very least he should have some minor irritation in his airways, shouldn’t he?
Steve moved closer and took his face in both hands. As his thumbs stroked Tony’s cheeks, he said, “Happy birthday. I missed you.”
"I try," Steve said in response, letting the tease linger before finally taking his hand from Tony's person and pulling back to assess his clothes. He wasn't sure how to get under all of that. The zipper at the front was pretty self explanatory but the rest of it…
Only the next moment did he understand what Tony was actually saying, which made his gaze snap back to him, this time his eyebrows were raised in clear surprise.
Every inch of him was bursting with life—even the floor under his feet felt new. For everything good in the world, his mood couldn’t be better. Quickly, he made his way through the Triskelion’s hallways while working on the buttons of his uniform. He felt like he had just completed a marathon and that thought alone was enough to bring a light flush to his cheeks. His morning marathons around Washington certainly never made him feel like he wouldn’t be able to stop grinning within the next couple of hours.
All things considered, Steve felt he was handling his frustrated concern in a calm, adult-like manner. Pacing back and forth in front of the RV, sending accusing glares to the darkened sky every few seconds as though it was responsible for this mess.
Tony’s lips fell open against Steve’s prodding tongue, and a surprised whimper tickled his throat. His mind tried to race to his aid, only to fall short under the intensity of the kiss. Thoughts dissipated completely, rendering him thoroughly helpless against Steve’s assault.
It was incredible, and too hot to bear for too long. Steve could already see the sheen of sweat forming on Tony's back, and the sounds he was making were downright filthy.
There was a moment of quiet, and when Steve opened his eyes again, he followed Maria Stark’s movements. How worried and urgent she suddenly looked as she leaned down to Tony. Steve really wished he could be consoling him, as Maria whispering in his ear:
“Bucky,” Steve whispered—and it sounded like he wanted to scream the name, but it only came out as a pained gasp. In another world, Tony would’ve been angry at Steve for mentioning him—while holding Tony’s hand no less.
All available meteorological skills in Tony came together to predict the time the wind would take to blow away the clouds. A vain consolation—the predicted said cloudiness for Hopkinsville for 21st August was 18%. The clouds would clear off. They had to.
As if on command, Steve threw his head back, his hips lifting off the mattress. His body sizzled and exploded, doused so deep in rapture that he didn’t know how to ever breathe normally again. It lasted forever, and yet, it was over too soon. Sweat lined Steve’s brows and when he looked down, he felt all remaining breath leaving him.
Steve stared at him—at the red sunglasses, the expensive jacket, the jittery tapping of Tony’s fingers on the table in front of him, and it was then that he realized, with a sudden jolt, that Tony was
Sam blinked as though it was surprising. As though he hadn’t just risked his life at their side, fighting a fight that had nothing to do with him. Sam had definitely earned himself a spot on the team.
The aftermath of the gala had brought forth a series of interview requests that he’d declined, talk show invites he’d outright ignored, and about a thousand memes of Tony getting spat in the face.
“Back at you,” Steve murmured. He tried moving his legs somewhat, and it was futile—he’d never felt so completely worn out since he’d been injected with the serum. He glanced sideways. “Thank you.”
“I don’t know,” he whispered, and it was surely the wrong thing to say, but it was the truth, and he’d made one promise to himself—that from here on out, Tony would only ever get the truth from him.
Tony’s jaw clenched. He allowed himself a moment of deep-rooted wonder that this still managed to make him so angry. He didn’t care; he truly didn’t
During the day, he mostly occupied himself in his room, emerging only to eat. But today, it was too beautiful outside to confine himself indoors. Days like this were made for spending at the cliff with his sketchpad. So that was exactly what he did.
"You miss him, don't you?" he asked quietly, trying to not disturb the mood. With Tony pressed up against his back, Steve didn't think the atmosphere could be ruined so easily, but weirder things had happened. He let his fingers wrap around Tony's wrist and pulled up his hand to kiss his fingertips.
“To get used to having friends and a family. Trust me, at first I couldn’t stand having the others around all the time. I was sure they weren’t there for the long run, and I couldn’t have been more wrong. You’re a part of this gig now, and we won’t leave you behind.”
everything then and there. His uniform, while being unfairly tight, didn’t actually reveal much of anything, but his arousal was still pretty obvious. And if the way Steve’s eyes were all but blown wide with lust—his cheeks flushed, his breathing slightly ragged—was any indication, he was likely just as desperate as Tony.
It probably spoke volumes that Obi’s words didn’t really hit him as hard as they probably should. Tony
He smiled at him, feeling at ease."I did not go caveman on you, don't be ridiculous," Steve retorted, letting his fingers rub gentle circles into Tony's back. "You were just so infuriating…"
Halfway to the machine, Steve paused, his head turning around. His eyes were narrowed and his face puzzled. “You alright?” he asked as if he didn’t fully know what parading around half-naked would do to Tony. Then, Steve’s gaze dropped and his eyes widened. “Tony, be caref—”
“I know you didn’t,” Tony agreed. “You humans don’t believe in divinity. Not even those who pray to Father every single day. Not
Tony was in the water, with his back to Steve. He was obviously naked, leaning against a larger rock, and Steve found himself unable to move away or look elsewhere.
"Yeah." Steve nodded his head, ducking it for a brief second. There really was no use in hiding from Bucky. He’d always known him far too well. "It's… It's stupid, compared to what you're dealing with."
Words abandoned him completely. Tony swallowed down the lump in his throat and stepped closer. He opened his mouth to tell Steve how very wrong he was, but Steve momentarily pressed a finger over his lips, his eyes boring into him.
Sharon carried a single white flower and laid it on the freshly covered grave. “Goodbye Aunt Peggy,” she whispered and moved away.
He felt a hand wander across his chest before slipping between them to tease the ache between his legs.
As it was, T’Challa took over and it gave Tony the moment to look at the scene he needed. Steve had almost made it to the hangar, dammit. If he left now, Tony might never find out where he was going.
Steve didn’t know why he was so surprised at Tony’s words. It was true after all. This time, their love didn’t help, couldn’t save them.
Steve groaned; whether at the debauched picture Tony must be making right now, or at the feeling of his body sliding up and down his length, he wasn’t sure. Likely both. “Tony…”
The man leaned forward. For a moment, it actually looked like he wanted to reach for Tony’s hand, which had Tony draw his chair back so fast it screeched loudly on the linoleum floor.
“I can stay a little longer,” she said, and gently grasped his metal hand in her own, and pulled it across her body. “But I won’t stay down here forever. And neither should you.”
"Maybe. Does it matter?" he asked quietly next to Tony's ear. "You got this portal closed, and we got rid of those things. The fight is over." He ran a slow, soothing hand up and down Tony's back. "And if you need some light, just say the word. I still have the miniature lamp you gave me..."
“On the other hand,” Tony said, bringing Steve back to the present. “Maybe you just need a bit of persuasion. I was told I can be very persuasive, and… you’re every bit the kind of guy I’d want, so…” He trailed off and wiggled his brows at Steve. The gesture was more goofy than suggestive, but Steve didn’t let his amusement show.
And then, the warmth of Steve’s lips was on his own. The curve of his smile. The hint of mouthwash, and then God, his tongue. Steve swallowed him, devoured him, held Tony to him as his mouth opened. And as always, Tony was a goner. A complete and utter goner. He moaned and melted into Steve. The taste of him had Tony inebriated, lost, his arms locked around Steve’s neck without planning to let him go any time soon.
Tony hummed thoughtfully. He had a big duffle bag slung over his shoulder that he now let fall down on the hotel room floor. He turned back around to Steve and raised a brow. “And Barnes?”
“False alarm,” Bucky told him on a low exhale. “I didn’t have an attack, not really, we just… and I…” He groaned in annoyance and let his gaze drop to the ground.
Steve blinked. “Oh… oh yes.” He nodded and stepped aside. “There’s not exactly a lot of space in here.”
Natasha gave it a minute’s consideration, then she walked over to him and lay down on the cot, facing him. “This doesn’t mean anything,” she said, quietly.
“Have you tried to make the LOC change substantially?” Bruce asked, from where he was hunched over Tony’s tablet, scrolling through the thousand lines of code.
Here, the lighting bounced off the clean surfaces, the white tiles, and it made Steve squint. The blinding glare of it took him back to those moments when he’d been sure he’d die in that explosion. Before many had to die so he wouldn’t.
“You like this?” Tony rasped, when he let go of Steve momentarily. He looked up at him, and the sight of him kneeling, looking as debauched as he did, had Steve’s knees tremble hard. “You like me sucking you?”
“Priority upload from Vienna’s police,” Natasha explained. “Remember that when we decided to go to Peggy’s funeral, the UN called for a psychiatrist?”
The fight with Stane had taken everything out of him. All of these past weeks, the many false trails leading to Stane’s hideout, before they’d finally found him here, in the middle of Los Angeles, and now sending Stane to Hell… Tony simply hadn’t been prepared.
Well, that was really comforting. Steve turned to run into the building at full speed. What he hadn’t anticipated at all, however, were another good dozen HYDRA goons stepping out from the entryway. They had their guns drawn and were completely dressed in black, even their faces were masked. At first, Steve assumed they were additional back-up. At least until one of them stepped aside and revealed—
In moments like this, Steve felt it again. That a lot of people he had known and loved had gotten away from him too soon. Especially in cemeteries, Steve tended to have a few very dark thoughts. Surrounded by all those lonely graves he got just a little bit terrified of the idea of—well. Dying alone.
"You're not dying," he retorted, though he was considering Tony's request seriously. It had only been two weeks, but they've had plenty of time together—more than Steve had initially thought they would in light of the fact they were both employed one way or another in two different states. He couldn't deny the effect Tony had on him, even though he’d been adamant to wait with going farther than a little kissing and groping.
Steve shook his head, not really knowing how to explain that… the concept of them together was much more intriguing than he dared to admit to himself. “I was just… curious.”
It was, it seemed, the right thing to say, as a bright smile flashed along Tony’s mouth. He pulled again, until Steve was fully settled against his chest. His legs spread to either side of Tony’s hips, the weight of his body centering between his legs. He gasped at the sudden pressure he felt there, and at the intense pleasure it wrought.
They’d decided to ‘see where things go’. To be ‘casual’ about it. To just ‘text each other’, make a ‘real date’ out of it. They’d agreed to stay cool about it. To not overthink it. They’d both admitted they were interested, and everything else, well... time would tell.
“Alright then,” Tony announced, smiling brightly at Thor. “Great work with the antidote. Glad this one’s solved. Go team! Bruce, keep a few of them for testing, yeah?”
Tony broke the gaze and took one look at the room. His eyes settled on the beige linen sheets. Then he huffed.
“Thanks,” Steve called into the comm, as he ran into the underbridge that’d lead him to the next deck—and the galley.
Steve sighed. “I’m tired, Tony. I’ve come to the end of my rope with you. I thought we were becoming friends again, I thought you were maybe ready to try and be in a team with me. But then you completely pushed me away and I just… I think it’s better if I leave for good.”
Steve lingered, casting him a suspicious look, and dammit, Steve had always known him far too well. But eventually, he nodded. “Alright. Sleep well, and call me if you need anything, alright?”
Sam chuckled. "You're a terrible liar, Steve. Don't ever try to do that for a living," he jabbed, elbowing him lightly, but he didn't say anything further, despite Steve suspicion that the guy knew exactly why he hadn't said anything.
,” Tony told Vision with an eye-roll, “I’m… you’re smirking. Stop it, it’s creepy. You’re not supposed to smirk, Mr. Cool-Guy.”
“By holding a gun at everyone on Earth and calling it protection?” Steve countered, and with that, the battle over semantics fell to a draw. It was easier to speak with Fury in absolutes. Easier to ignore the doubt in his mind—the very real fear that he was playing to the desire of people rather than doing it for the right cause.
He realized that Tony had let him go at some point and was now walking in the direction of the stairway. Steve only leaned heavily on the island and stared after him.
"Yeah…" Steve scratched the back of his neck absently. "That's not much of a relief. If it's affecting me differently, who knows what else might happen?" He leaned back against the couch and closed his eyes. "It… It felt so real…"
Stark hummed, satisfied. “See, Frosty? You might actually walk away from all the shit they put in your brain.”
“The only specific I have is that they like to tinker with machines… There was nothing they talked about more. But that’s not exactly something I can write in that internet of yours and expect an answer, is it?”
Tony felt a growing tightness in his groin, and it took a lot of willpower for him to put a bit of pressure on Steve’s chest, signaling him to stop.
With a small jump, Tony came out of his reverie. “You look stunning,” he said, his voice a little throaty.
“Who are you,” he said, not even phrasing it as a question. His voice had dropped in a manner that made Steve wish he’d brought his shield upstairs.
And he needed to say goodbye to someone else, which meant atop everything else, the day would be another trial on his mind.
Tony groaned as he leaned against Rhodey, letting him take some of his weight as they made their way across the smaller alleys. He should’ve stopped drinking at some point, he mused. The taste in his mouth was a mixture of tequila, cheap beer and something… else…
There was deep concern etched on Natasha’s features. “Phil doesn’t know where he is. Nor does Sharon,” she told Steve. “I told them to call you if they have any news.”
“He’s losing a lot of blood, but Extremis should be able to fix this. We just need him to stay conscious.”
Tony dropped his gaze to the floor and sighed. “I shouldn’t have said all that,” he muttered. “In Siberia. Not to Bucky, and not to you. That was… uncalled for.”
With that, Steve headed for the elevators and was not surprised when his move did not inspire an objection. The distance between them at that moment seemed too magnanimous for any further discussions.
A sardonic grin overwhelmed Tony, aimed more at himself than anyone else. Of course Steve would be showing up
Fury cleared his throat. “Well, I know this might be difficult, but for the purpose of finding out what happened with Mrs. Stark, we’ll have to go over the previously recorded testimonies.”
With that, he took hold of Steve’s uniform pants, opening the fastenings easily, and dragging it down, too. He glanced at Steve’s crotch, pleased to see that he was definitely affected, too. Tony withdrew, letting Steve step out of his uniform completely while he made quick work of his own clothing, rendering them to the floor with little care.
kissed back, right? Tony tried to remember things that weren’t Steve’s taste and the smoothness of his lips or the way his heart had practically hammered against his chest.
They were finally pressed tight together, partially due to Tony's last move, which made Steve hitch a breath. The tight heat around him was maddening, and Steve had to admit that he did want to move faster, but that could wait. He wanted this to be the best experience he could make it for Tony.
“God, you have a really nice dick, anyone ever told you that?” Tony asked absentmindedly as he let his fingers trail along the hard length. In times like these, he really wished they could go bareback. Feeling all of that inside him with no barrier whatsoever would surely be an experience in itself.
"Hey," Steve said after a moment of silence had passed between them. He reached up to cup Tony's face in his palm, and turned to look at him. "We got our second chance, didn't we?"
Tony heaved a great breath, walking to the balcony’s balustrade. He leaned onto it, staring down towards the ground.
"I, uh, work out," Steve supplied, not unkindly, to stop whatever scolding lecture Bruce had ready for Tony. He didn't want the kid to get in trouble. "And I do sculpt a little, occasionally," he added with a small smile, not bothering to tell Tony he wasn't actually a professor, yet. He lifted the heavy plate and brought it where Bruce had pointed at, but Bruce didn't move to secure it in place right away.
, or whose fault it is. Hell, it’s probably Tony’s. But for once, please, just put whatever it is behind you so he can enjoy this moment. You might not care for the eclipse, but Tony does. And so do I. It’s a one-in-a-lifetime thing and I need it to be perfect for him, okay? God knows he didn’t have a lot of things to look forward to this year, so yeah, get your head out of your ass, Steve—please.”
“Stop being stupid,” Steve muttered irritably. He dragged a hand over his face and took a step back. Who was he kidding? He wouldn’t be knocking on that door any time soon. If Tony didn’t want to talk to him—
“Are you actually asking me if I’d turn down a blowjob?” Tony asked, his expression amused. That was, until the door of the workshop opened and fast steps neared them.
Ian bashfully turned his head to the side, burying it into Tony’s shoulder. Almost indiscernible, he shook his head.
Steve nodded. “Exactly.” He let one finger trace one laughter line next to Tony’s mouth and leaned in to kiss it. He hadn’t laughed nearly enough in the last couple of weeks.
Tony watched as Steve and Obi shook hands, both with pleasant smiles on their faces that didn’t actually seem all that
And with that, he must have also accepted that it could lead to this very moment when Steve would stand meters apart from him.
“Your next cryo will start in two days,” she said, and the soft expression in her eyes seemed to belie the cruelty that had clouded them the night before when they’d taken down some American senator. The contrast was so startling that, at first, he couldn’t wrap his mind around how he hadn’t seen it before.
“Everyone ready?” Steve asked. He was standing in the middle of the Quinjet, eyeing the team while he put his helmet on. His expression was the epitome of determination. “Once we land, we’ll start with evac. Ultron knows we’re coming. Odds are we’ll be riding into heavy fire. And that’s what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn’t. So our priority is getting them out.”
Steve lowered his gaze, a slight movement, eyes set on Tony's neck. He forced a small smile onto his face. "It's… not something you should have to carry, Tony," he said, not unkindly, wrapping an arm around Tony's shoulders, pulling him close. He didn't trust himself enough yet to pull him into a full hug.
worried, and not the judgemental kind of worry, but just… concerned. His eyes were flickering between Tony’s face, the papers on the floor, and DUM-E’s frame.
Tony pursed his lips and stared at the black temptation. His gaze remained fixated on the cup of warmth that touched his skin, its tempting aroma wafting near his nostrils.
For once, Tony did as he was told. He pulled off the metal cap and let it drop on its cables to the side of the machine. He rubbed his temples where the pincers had dug.
“Fine,” Steve echoed. He walked across the room and only stopped in the doorway. “Take your time, but… whenever you’re ready, Buck. We’re just a few floors upstairs.”
A man was standing over him, Steve realized, his hands bloodied and his black hair, his clothes, all gleaming wetly. His features were twisted with hatred, a thin crust of drying blood streaked across his nose and chin. He was lifting his foot to deliver another blow to Steve’s head, but this time, he saw it coming and managed to dodge. He forced himself to his feet, watching the other man warily.
Steve pulled away first and after a breathless second or two he opened his eyes. “Tony,” he breathed, a watery smile gracing his face. His touch was soft and exploratory. He kissed Tony’s upper lip, his lower lip, his chin; his hand slid up his arm, palming his cheek as his mouth found his again. The gentle invasion of his tongue into Tony’s mouth finally broke Steve out of his stunned silence, and he melted into him with a soft breath.
Ever since that kiss… he was so aware of Tony that if he closed his eyes even for a second, he would find himself remembering the taste of his mouth, the feeling of his lips, his beard scratching lightly against his skin… And that was bad.
But Tony’s eyes were already black again. “You,” he breathed after a moment. “Me. Bruce, all of us… Millions. Politicians, TV anchors, businessmen. Anyone who’s a potential threat to HYDRA. He even—” Tony groaned, sinking forward on his knees, panting. “I can’t believe this. Zola even taught them how to read our fucking bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, the damn SAT scores. Zola’s algorithm evaluates peoples’ past to predict their future. With that knowledge, HYDRA could easily dispose of everyone who doesn’t help their cause, do what their assassins did so far, only that it’d be much faster, much cleaner, much less traceable. They wouldn’t need to train them for years—” Tony stopped short, mouth suddenly falling open on a low disbelieving gasp. A very still beat grew between them. “What? Oh God, Steve, I didn’t know…”
Tony stilled in his movement, startled by the sudden outburst. Somehow he’d thought Barnes would take anything, even the painful procedures, without so much as blinking. He couldn’t even form thoughts to how much of a relief it was to be wrong about this.
Steve frowned, staring down at his hands still cradling his mug. He remembered how closed-off Tony had seemed after they’d returned home from Sokovia. The shaking of his hands. Of course the girl must have gotten to him in that bunker, showing him his own kind of nightmare. He felt stupid for not realizing that earlier. Of course he would’ve tried everything in his power to keep whatever horror he’d been shown from happening.
She’d changed. He knew he couldn’t remember her from before, but some vague feeling had him realize that she had changed.
to believe Tony was right so badly. He wanted to believe they could make this work. And for Tony, he needed to give it a try. His heart had been too long in love. Too long Tony’s and Tony’s alone. There was no way he and Steve would be standing on opposite sides. Not ever.
“Exactly. Either you leave with Hammer, stay at his side until he tires of you. Or…” Tony raised the mug to his lips again, his mouth tugging into an even wider, however mystifying grin. “Or you come home with me.”
Tony shrugged carelessly. “I don’t know, just pick whatever you like. I’ll see if I wanna answer it.”
Sometime close to late afternoon, the door to the workshop creaked open and the scent of coffee drifted in the air. Tony found himself jarred out of whatever perpetual reverie he’d been in. He turned to the door and was greeted with Bruce’s warm, sympathetic smile, feeling immediately grateful for the distraction.
Steve remained stock-still as he regarded the numbers and letters in front of him. “I don’t understand… When did you do this?”
There was a significant pause at that; Tony released a quaking breath and met Steve’s eyes again. And then, pedal-soft, pressed his lips to Steve’s. “I can’t leave, yet.”
“Thanks for babysitting, James,” Steve told Rhodey and clapped a hand on his shoulder as he walked in.
Steve stared at the man and he couldn’t believe how cruel he behaved. “Mr. Stane,” he prompted, braving himself, but Stane went on before Steve could get a word in.
When the kiss ended, Tony leaned his forehead against Steve’s. “I don’t know what I would’ve done if you hadn’t forgiven me.”
“That was strange,” Steve went on, as he reached for Tony’s shoulder to slow him down somewhat. “There was a girl, one of Strucker’s experiments, I suppose. I think she… altered my perception, or… did some kind of time shift.”
Steve barely spent ten minutes in his old apartment before he hit the road again. He only packed a few more clothes and got a bit of cash, then slipped on his leather jacket and rolled his bike out of the underground garage.
“I wanted to keep our life intact,” Tony admitted. “Look… moral ambiguity aside, you did everything you could to keep Bucky alive. You didn’t always analyze every step you took, but that’s you—your heart always leads each of your steps. And… my head’s running a mile a second, so I often forget to stop and ask myself if it’s truly the right thing to do.”
Steve’s eyes trailed down Tony’s body until focusing on his middle. His cock was flushed red and leaking. “You’re so beautiful,” he managed to say. Leaning down, he kissed Tony’s throat. His hands traveled from his chest to his arms, and further up until Tony’s fingers laced with his own.
He let his thumb brush along Steve’s wet cheeks. “I’m sorry about Barnes,” he said. “I am. I would’ve never…”
Abruptly, Steve spun around and beat the stonewall of Sam’s garage with his left hand, punching it twice and with so much force, chunks of rock broke off and the jagged surfaces they left behind peeled the flesh from his knuckles.
Tony’s eyes trailed up Steve’s naked body, half a mind to call him back to bed and start the day as the last one had ended. Before he could ponder how bad it’d be if he came in late to work today, though, his progression was halted by Steve’s offensive boxer briefs that concealed his goodies from Tony’s reverent eyes.
Vision came to a stop, sandwich in hand, and looked back at him. However the hell Tony had managed to do it, but he already looked a lot better. “Yes?”
“You heard Ross,” Natasha added. “If you don’t sign, that means you’re not part of the team anymore.”
With an annoyed groan, Bucky opened the door for a little gap and glared at Clint. “Tell him I’ll be down in ten,” he snapped.
“—don’t threaten the board. Yeah, I got it.” He smiled reassuringly at her and leaned back in his chair, keeping one hand entwined with hers.
Three days later, Steve walked up to his temporary room in Tony’s mansion. It was midnight, and he’d just returned from helping with construction work in the city center.
Natasha’s eyes briefly flickered sideways, before they settled on Tony again, calm and sure. “James and I… we know very well what the other can take, and we’re used to see things for what they are.” She smiled at him. “This… situation. You might not realize it, but it’s temporary. It’s not how we’re gonna lead our life. I knew, when all of this began that James and I might have to go our separate ways for a while. And that is… okay.”
Tony frowned a bit with the way Steve pressed his eyes close, a look of firm concentration etched into his features. He knew Steve would tell him if he didn’t want him to go on, and anyway… it
At the bay, there were people everywhere, materializing from seemingly out of nowhere. Only Tony—Tony was nowhere to be seen.
“I’m good,” Tony said, once he saw what was likely a great deal of desperation on Steve’s face. “Come on—on to the main act.”
Everything after his last cryo was a blur. He remembered punching Steve’s face, but he didn’t know if he had killed him. It was possible. Things had been fast and violent. He suspected he would remember it had he killed Steve, but right now he was too foregone to register anything he felt.
As soon as Rhodes killed the engine, though, Tony shot upwards from his seat and moved faster than Steve had ever seen him move. He grabbed his sunglasses and messenger bag, then all but ran to the RV’s exit. The slam of the front door sliced through the room like a silver bullet.
They talked about both of their lives, about Steve’s mother, and Bucky, and the war. Tony had told him he was some kind of engineer, though Steve had a feeling he was downplaying this a whole lot. He’d also told him that he’d recently lost a family member named Jarvis, but apart from that, he didn’t give much of anything personal away.
Footsteps resounded once more, and all of them whirled around to see Natasha and Black Panther stepping on the scene. Steve had no idea where he’d come from.
It’d been fascinating to watch him, humbling almost, but ever since their arrival at Stark Mansion, that man—that version of Tony—had seemingly vanished along with his carefreeness.
“Well,” Rhodey said after half a minute, looking around before his eyes settled on Tony once more. He dragged the towel down from his shoulders and shrugged. “I’ve had my suspicions, I guess.”
He and Vision, they had grown close in the last couple of months. While there were distinct differences between Vision and JARVIS, it sure did feel like speaking with his old friend whenever Vision was around. True to his words, Jarvis was a part of Vision—just more.
Steve felt his heart swell with warmth. And if nothing else, he resolved to never underestimate Tony’s love for him again. “So, this is it… you, me…?”
“You’re welcome,” Steve said and drew back further. With a glance to Natasha’s arm, he stood up and walked over to the cabinets, producing some sort of first aid package and a bottle of disinfectant. He dropped back down on the floor and Natasha wordlessly raised her arm so he could clean the scrapes.
Hours passed like that, with Tony staring down at Steve's still form. The others took turns to keep him company, bringing him food and coffee, even though he had barely nibbled on a sandwich by the time the sun went down outside.
“Always am,” Steve promised, before he changed position so he’d land feet-first into the ocean. He pulled both hands to his chest and closed his eyes. A second later, he was crashing into the ice-cold water.
"What? Tony…" he heard himself say, groaning internally at his inability to keep quiet about this. "You're too drunk to walk, how are you going to work like this?" It was a real struggle not to mention underage drinking at this point. Tony's eyes had that watery quality to them which meant he was ready to either pass out or fall asleep and that couldn't be safe for anyone, let alone someone headed to a laboratory.
“I’ll get there,” Steve promised and his voice was raw silk. Steve caught Tony’s hands in his and brought them to his lips, then held them out of the way as he leaned in. Tony thought he meant to kiss him again, but Steve gave his mouth a pass and went straight for his shoulder, sucking at the spot where it joined his neck. His lips and tongue delicately traced the same path along Tony’s collarbone that his finger had earlier. He let go of Tony’s hands and ran his own slowly down Tony’s body, thumbs scraping his nipples as his fingers molded themselves to his every inch, mindful of his wounds, finally coming to rest on his hips. Steve rubbed his hands over the skin of Tony’s stomach, bringing them up to hold the back of his neck as he nuzzled his ear.
, but Tony couldn’t help himself. And for the first time in weeks, he felt completely at ease, because he knew he could just do what felt right—because he knew Steve would
Tony lifted the cup to his lips and indulged a long, hearty taste. He raised an eyebrow. That was his favorite roasting, with a hint of vanilla. “Did Steve make this?”
Tony made no move to disguise the breath that lodged in his throat. “And you believe in him anyway, sweetheart. You can’t fool me, you know? You’ll try again, and at some point, he’ll recognize you, I’m sure of it.”
There was a long moment of quiet, and when Steve looked down, Ian’s eyes were closed, his breaths evening out.
Steve pursed his lips and firmly grasped Tony’s hand in his. “It’s probably strange, I’ll grant you, it’s new and frightening, and something you’ll have to come around to. But wrong? Tony, come on, this isn’t wrong.”
This was home, he thought to himself, thanking whoever had been kind enough to help a poor and sickly guy from Brooklyn to even make it this far.
They stepped out onto the sidewalk, Steve minding his steps because the world just seemed to slip sideways every now and again, and walked a few feet from the entrance to look for cabs that might be waiting in the area. Well,
But he didn’t really need an answer to that. When he spotted Steve running away from a giant alien-bulb in the middle of the street, Tony already saw the thick dust spreading all over the place.
It hurt to know that it might be Steve’s end as well, but then again… he’d always known Steve would go down fighting, too. In that regard, they had always been alike.
Eventually, Tony pulled out of Steve, and fell on his back. He grabbed for his dress shirt and cleaned them both off as best as he could. Then, since the couch wasn’t big enough to lie side-by-side, he once more draped his exhausted body over Steve’s sated form. He brushed two sticky strands of hair off Steve’s forehead, leaning closer. “Come on, talk to me,” he whispered into his ear. “What happened?”
Steve shook his head, but did little to stop Tony from leading him over the threshold. “Mister Hammer said I need to be ready in an hour,” he said, but Tony cut his protest short with a quick, disinterested wave.
Laughing, Steve shook his head. Next to him, Tony opened his eyes, obviously ready to give Bucky a piece of his mind, but Steve beat him to it. "Never say that again, Buck," he commanded, then sighed. "Fine. It'd be stupid to drive back now anyway." He nudged Tony. "We’ll stay."
Barnes to sign the damn contract, he would never allow himself to forget that this was the same man who had almost killed Steve, who
Tony sighed, rubbing his temples with one hand. “That line is getting old. A problem that’s going to cost us the case?”
Tony huffed a hollow laugh and rubbed his eyes with a hand. “Do you even hear yourself? You can’t be busy, you can’t be fighting
Steve sighed, steering the motorcycle on the next drive-up, heading for Langston instead of home. It was an unusually quiet morning in Washington, and he was thankful for that. There were breaking points, and then there were Breaking Points. This clearly was the latter and he supposed, taking one thing at a time was likely the easiest way to get through the next days. He’d need to wrap up a few things at SHIELD before going back to New York. He’d have to talk to Rumlow, Coulson and Clint. Make them understand why he needed to leave for the time being.
Steve stared at him, visibly taken aback, but Tony pressed on. “It’s us and it’s the universe out there. And we have limits, no matter how much we train, how much we prepare.”
clear, and that wasn’t easy for…” He trailed off as he saw another guy approach their table with visible reluctance and a glass in his hand. He had longish, messy brown hair, a bit of three-day stubble, and oh… only one arm.
Bucky released a huff, clearly trying not to laugh. “If it’d been the latter, he would’ve already excused himself because he needed to ‘research’ something.”
years—first fighting it both visibly and vocally—to get along on a basic level. Then staying in contact, and finally coming back to each other’s side when they realized they were much better off when they worked together.
By now, the road trip to Hopkinsville seemed like a well-loved dream. It had grown distant in the face of the ticking clock. Life since returning home was more a cycle than anything else.
Pulling back a little, Steve stared at his friend closely. Then, he nodded his head. "Alright," he said. "Anything you need, I've got your back."
“Shall we play a game?” Tony intoned gravely, before green lines of text scrolled dizzyingly fast across the black screens of the computers, making the room flicker as though they were underwater.
It was just the two of them now. Vision had become a second spokesperson for the Avengers, touring through interviews and hearings with Pepper, and Natasha—she’d said she would return to the tower in a few days. She had refused to tell Tony where she was going, but he had a feeling he knew anyway. He’d watched her pack a small backpack, with things to sleep, and a few books that looked a lot like the Scandinavian thrillers Wanda had been reading lately, and a good dozen jelly beans—Clint’s secret obsession.
Balling a hand into a fist, Tony closed his eyes for a brief moment. He knew what he was about to do was stupid, and somewhat reckless, but his brain was busy repeatedly screaming ‘Once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity’ at him with ringing alarm signals. And he’d never been able to turn down a chance like this. It had been a losing game the moment he’d put the alien bulb beneath that bell jar.
And Extremis… was gone. He felt it with every fiber of his body and for the first time in many months, Tony really wished for something to drink. For something to dull that void.
Tony beamed and within a blink, his arms swept around Steve’s shoulders. “Welcome back, darling,” he said, pressing a lingering kiss on Steve’s mouth.
Whatever had transpired during the day really had taken its toll on him, Steve thought. Tony’s clothes were disheveled, the goatee frayed from too many strokes of his hand. And he looked ready to drop to a well-deserved sleep.
He vaguely heard Ross ordering the marines to get the Hulk out of the picture, and on the next beat, the men were rushing in.
That also explained the small differences. Now that Tony knew what he was looking for, it was painstakingly clear. Steve’s hair wasn’t quite the same, and his whole battle gear was easily a few steps ahead of their time.
“Steve?” Tony asked again, his voice almost hoarse. He leaned down a little more, and—God, Steve was so aware of him. Every hot little breath Tony took echoed hotly in Steve’s lungs.
He’d known, from the start, that something had been off in the way Tony’s team had attacked them. It
Today, he wouldn’t leave his bed. Tomorrow he would deal with the consequences. Tomorrow he would start to pick up what was left of him and try to figure out where he would go from here.
,” Tony said, and then, there were hands on Steve’s waist, drawing him nearer until their foreheads almost touched. “Never. Indries was my ruin. I
Tony looked down to where their hands were joined, tracing a thumb over Steve’s cufflinks. “And here I thought you couldn’t possibly top that, but there you go. You win the wedding-gift competition. Congratulations.”
"I’m sure it won't be that bad," Steve said, protesting, then grabbed for Tony's hand, squeezing it. "Maybe we can even spend a bit more time together, after?" Seeing how anxious Tony seemed to be about facing the others, Steve figured he might as well offer a silver lining.
Steve licked his lips and nodded. “Yes,” he said and straightened his back. He was a lot of things, but a coward wasn’t one of ‘em. “I understand that sixteen years is a long time, and I won’t expect anything from you. No one would wait this long for anybody, and I said things I shouldn’t have, last time we saw each other.” He took a deep breath. “I understand all that, but don’t try to tell yourself I would care for a
“He is in no immediate danger,” JARVIS replied after a moment’s consideration. “He seems to be… lost in thought, for lack of a better word. My queries remain unanswered, but all data indicates vague traces of magical influence. I’m afraid my sensors cannot locate their origin, nor their effect.”
Steve nosed against Tony’s cheek, pushing against him ever so slightly, urging Tony to turn his head again so Steve could taste his lips.
Ever since meeting this future version of Tony—ever since this Tony knew he wasn’t truly his husband, he’d forced himself to be as distant as possible, it seemed.
“Sure, ‘namesakes’,” Rhodes conceded, then leaned in to whisper into Ian’s ear: “Don’t listen to that guy. You know who you’re named after, right, little guy?”
At some point as he spoke, he felt Tony slide out, followed by a new, foreign sensation. Dribbling down between his ass-cheeks and along his inner thigh. God, he felt claimed in an all encompassing way.
It was Clint. He stood in the doorway, also in his Avengers uniform, and cast them a long-suffering look. Then he took a step forward and made room for Sam, who wasn’t quite looking at them and instead started to awkwardly rub his neck.
“Thank you for your sensitive observation,” Steve threw out his dry response, walking over to the bed slowly. “I’m sorry,” he said as he sat down next to him, but the smile was still there. “I’m neglecting you.”
With a soft sigh, Tony finished towel drying his son’s hair and wrapped a towel around him, then scooped him up and carried him over to the bedroom.
Barnes glanced at him, before looking down on his feet without saying a word. There was a long silence, neither of them quite knowing what to say, and Tony cleared his throat twice before speaking up.
Tony only pressed a finger to his lips and smiled softly. He tugged Steve mouth down to his and kissed him until they both fell asleep.
cold, colder than he made it seem, probably. He closed his eyes against the very dim sunlight, and only smiled when he heard splashes of water followed by a sharp intake of breath.
“Don’t you think I know this?” Tony asked, his voice a little louder than he had planned. He rubbed his forehead and sighed. “Sorry. I’m—we’re very grateful. We’ll be on our best behavior, and I’ll tell you how it went, afterwards.”
“Will you tell Steve?” Barnes asked, and he studied Tony with intensity that could melt an iceberg. For some reason, Tony had the feeling he was being tested.
There were no words forthcoming, which was really saying something. When Steve started to push inside, all Tony could do was throw his head back and pant into the open air. It was slow, God was it ever slow. And Steve was being so goddamn gentle. He was thrusting forward, millimeter by millimeter, his movement delicate but torturous.
It still looked like the robot was smiling, a cruel curve in his frenzied mouthpiece, and this time, it was a mixture of Tony’s voice and its own answering.
“She used to teach me Christmas Carols for years, you know,” he mused. “Wouldn’t teach me anything else till I had those perfected. Said I would most likely play the piano at Christmas my whole life, even when I had already lost interest in it on other occasions, so I’d better know what I did with the Carols.”
His mind was racing, and a part of him didn’t want to believe Steve’s words. Didn’t want to once more get his hopes up with Steve and then have him crushing them afterwards…
By the time they got into the safe house’s basement, Tony was struggling not to pass out, despite the pain. The bleeding had mostly stopped oozing out, but he knew there was some serious mess inside, and someone was going to have to get the damned blade out before it wreaked too much havoc for Extremis to fix. He wasn’t one hundred percent sure what would happen if they didn’t get it out in time, and he didn’t exactly want to find out. Extremis was running on high alert, but as long as the blade was still stuck in his body, it remained inactive—only supplying information on how critical his condition actually was.
. The rest of the plans had gone through with no difficulties, but as soon as they tried to step out of the facility for that walk…
Steve bounded to his feet before delivering a punch with his shield that sent the man flying over the street. Then, he twirled with a roundabout kick to dispatch the last remaining goon that had accompanied Rumlow to Lagos.
. Steve’s eyes almost bogged out as Howard walked straight towards him. His hair was gray, his face wrinkled, only his eyes were exactly as Steve remembered them. Brown, and brilliant and so similar to his son’s that it was startling.
"Are you hurt anywhere?" he asked. He couldn't see well enough to really know, and besides, the armor would've hidden most of anything.
“Stop,” Tony groaned after another beat, stilling against Steve’s fingers. He gazed down at him, at his face first, then down his body. “Fuck me,” he breathed, once his eyes had settled on Steve’s cock. “Please. I can’t wait any longer.”
,” Sam announced loudly, his voice bursting through the silence that had hazed Steve’s mind ever since they’d arrived back home from Sokovia three days ago. They were all sitting on the couch in the common living room, and Steve was staring out into the city while the laughter and the jokes and the horrible music playing on Tony’s prized stereo system filled the space around him. Sam sat down on the far end of the couch and clapped both hands together. “Don’t wanna spoil the mood, but if we ever wanna get this party anywhere near a state called ‘awesome’, we’re gonna have to get more supplies.”
“Having a family changes people. And our little guy needs his parents.” A determined breath sounded through his lips as his gaze locked on Tony. “It was you who made me realize that I’m still
Steve knew he should feel insulted at everything that had left Tony’s lips so far, but somehow, he didn’t care all that much. All of this couldn’t be real, and what good would it do him to argue with a man his own imagination had come up with?
He froze, for a moment too blindsided by the bold move to really do anything about it. Tony's lips were soft and his hands were rough against Steve's face, and he had a look of… near-desperation in his eyes. Of course, Steve couldn't let something like this be happening, no matter how his heart jolted and how aware he was of Tony's warmth, and how much he wanted not to crush Tony's hopes.
.” Natasha hesitated, obviously choosing her next words cautiously. That much was simple to decipher. Her gaze remained fixed on Steve. When she spoke up again, her voice was strangely thick, and not remotely her own. “Five years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran. It was a simple mission, until somebody shot out my tires in Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff. I pulled us out, but The Winter Soldier was already there.” Her eyes became distant, lost in memory, while her fingers slowly rubbed circles into her abdomen. “I was covering my engineer, so he shot him… straight through me.”
“I don’t know the particulars.” His single eyes narrowed and the rough front that Fury had depended on from the beginning started to crumple, and the first strains of humanly worry leaked through. “There are elements,” he said slowly, “that have to be taken into consideration. Things that involve Project Insight that I cannot disclose. Here.” He held up a USB stick—probably the one Steve’d been talking about earlier, the one from the Lemurian Star. “Let’s just leave it at that for now. We’ll have to discuss the details later. It’s not safe here.”
Steve shifted in his chair and glanced at the inconspicuous clock behind the bartender. What was taking Tony so long? Did he not see Steve's note? What if he was in trouble and Steve was busy sitting here like an idiot?
The clock went off, and Steve shook his head. This wouldn’t get him anywhere, and the gym was waiting. It usually helped clear his mind, anyway.
"Thanks, Iron Man," Steve said, finding a more comfortable position to settle in the metal arms. He wished Tony had deigned to notify him before he scooped him up like this, but it beat having to stick around and breathe any more of whatever that had been.
When Tony didn’t answer, Steve raised his hand to Tony’s face, realizing that he was silently crying. Gently, he wiped away the tears. “You’re not a monster,” he told him. “A monster doesn’t regret its crimes. You’re still a good man.”
“Tony!” He walked up to them, thumping Tony on the back. “M’boy, didn’t expect you here so early after your little birthday party.”
Natasha sure didn’t believe in beating around the bush. She watched Tony while toying with the spoon that rested inside her untouched bowl of cereal.
“Oh, I forgot to tell you.” Steve pulled back, eyes shimmering with glee. “I got a little surprise for you later.”
A laugh ripped through the silence, and it took a while for Steve to realize that the hysterical giggles were coming from him.
Vision grabbed the glass by the side of the bed with a smile, and allowed Tony to take a few sips from the straw. “That’s enough,” he said gently, pulling the glass away. “It’s unhealthy to overdo it at this point.”
Tony drew him in, hugging him to his chest. “I love you,” he whispered against Steve’s neck. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. I’m sorry that I—”
Tucking him into bed went easier than expected, but when he was sprawled out all over the mattress, Steve felt himself pause. Tony moved his limbs in languid motions, biting his lips ever so often. The way his hair fell on his forehead made him both look young and very sensual and just…
“I want you to watch over my work, make sure it’s in the right hands. You’ll have Pepper and Rhodey, but I want
“Master Rogers,” he greeted him and Steve felt himself blush at the foreign title. “Master Anthony wanted me to inform you that Mrs. and Mister Hogan will arrive in about half an hour.”
And the thing was: While Tony didn’t talk of Indries, his ‘friends’ spoke about her all the time. They told Steve about her ethereal beauty, her cleverness, her wit—about how Tony had always looked at her like he couldn’t believe his own luck.
He grimaced, and immediately waved a hand in a placating gesture. “And no, that wasn’t another sex joke, just… you alright? Seemed you got a full dose of that stuff.”
“Oh my God!” Tony laughed, and leaned back in to kiss Steve senseless. “You’re impossible. I love it.”
The scent of hot chocolate warmed the air. “You know… you gotta sleep sometime,” Clint said when he sat down across from him, placing a mug in front of Steve’s hands. “Cause if you don’t sleep, Tony won’t either. I’m pretty sure the guy will play a pivotal role when we locate Ultron, and I swear to God I will kill you both if I die because the two of you didn’t get your shit together. You haven’t slept in, what, two days?”
why you should trust me that I don’t want him on the run, chased by police cars. Seventy-two hours, guaranteed.”
Steve stared at him—and the elevator had long stopped, the doors opening, but he didn’t move one bit. Instead, he pulled his hand from Tony’s and held his face in both hands. “You’re worth it, too. I’m so glad you believed in us enough to do all of this again. I know it couldn’t have been easy for you.”
Then again, maybe it didn’t have to be. Maybe he just needed to make an effort to get to know the person JARVIS had become. After all, the thing between him and Steve had seemed impossible at first, too. And now here they were.
“So, there were only two suites free, but there’s… two separate bedrooms in each,” he explained, clearing his throat. “I’ll take the suite over here, and you can both have a room in the other—”
“Tony’s full of shit,” Natasha said on an eye-roll. “Time travel might influence your memories and your behavior, true, but it doesn’t turn you into different people.”
“What,” Tony shot back, affronted. “I’m just impressed with Professor Rogers’ physical fitness. That’s allowed, isn't it?”
It had taken Tony about three seconds to know Steve was one of the good guys—he was kind, and had this sort of dry humor that Tony really liked. Even Tony’s teasing didn’t seem to put him off so much as it made him flustered and sometimes a little exasperated with him. Mostly, he seemed amused, and maybe even a bit flattered.
As memories of their childhood flooded his mind, memories of laughter, whispered promises and shared sorrow, a sharp pain jittered up his spine. His brain was too clogged with the barriers of self-loathing. He shouldn’t be allowed good memories. He’d taken life after life, and with perfect indifference in his heart. So many men, women, even children. He remembered shooting Howard and his wife like it had meant nothing to him. Remembered what it had felt like to pull the trigger with perfect clarity. And while those memories ripped him apart, at least he deserved them.
During the few seconds it took Tony to reply, Steve realized his mistake. Not only was he acting like a jealous idiot, but he was risking exposing whatever it was that had never really happened between them. Luckily, Tony supplied him with an easy way to backtrack and Steve tried not to let any of this show on his face or be reflected in his stance. Even if he couldn't have Tony, it didn't mean he would watch others take advantage of him.
Steve lifted his brows when Pepper's name came up and his expression grew more wondering when Tony chose to use a word as strong as ‘warning’. It took some effort to not let out a surprised laugh at some of the things Tony said, but Steve braved it. He watched Tony intently, seeing how serious he was about it. He was trying to look out for Steve, was that it?
“Obi…” Tony said on a sigh. But once he looked at Stane’s stern expression, a shadow fell over his eyes and he remained otherwise silent.
“Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD.”
It was dark, really fucking dark, and the suit’s repulsor lights were almost completely dimmed due to the oily fluids that the
“I… yeah,” Tony said, and fought the urge to cast Steve an apologetic smile. It wasn’t exactly something he had to be sorry for, he just hoped Steve wouldn’t mind. “I did.”
Tony nodded, looking back at Steve. “Yeah, so that’s our only idea. I’m going to send a message to my past self. Then your people will have to find the Sequencer before it was destroyed. They’ll use it on our Steve, and the both of you switch places.”
“How did you…” Steve huffed, cold wind sweeping against his face as he pressed a hand against his earpiece. “Never mind. You promised to remove that tracker.”
Steve stumbled through these questions as best he could. However, from the sidelong glances those people kept shooting one another, he knew he hadn’t done well. After the interrogation was finished, they turned their backs on him and began to have a whispered conversation amongst themselves. Steve did not have to hear their words to understand what they were saying: What on earth was someone like Tony Stark doing, taking a boy as common as him into his home?
Eventually, Steve walked over to the balcony door, leaning against the doorframe, and cleared his throat.
Soon after, they had the two plates full of bacon and eggs, with a side of pancakes and salad. "Grab the sauce, will you?" he asked, nodding his head in the direction of the next shelf.
“Oh, okay,” Steve said, drawing in a breath before pushing further, until he was buried to the hilt. He stayed like that for a long moment, getting his bearings.
“I didn’t hurt you, did I?” Steve murmured after a long moment. One of his hands was tracing what Tony thought might be the formation of a small bruise on his hips.
been. He’d never even denied it. And that meant that he was still Steve’s partner, his… whatever they’d been heading towards.
When Steve’s thrusts grew deeper, Tony’s eyes all but rolled inside his head. He threw his head back, and clutched Steve with newfound desperation at his shoulders.
“Well, I’m not drunk, if that’s what you wanna know,” Tony snapped and whirled around. Too late, he realized that Steve actually
"Of course, if you can't stay…" He trailed off. He didn't want Tony to leave yet. It's taken so long for them to get to see each other again, and he was worried the problem might repeat itself in the future. Dammit, it would all have been much easier if Tony had just stayed on the team...
So when we said there's only the epilogue left we actually meant there's 2 more chaps + the epilogue. DUH.
“Right,” Natasha said, then added with a mischievous grin: “But Phil hasn’t seen Vision eat yet, that’s something to look forward to.”
kind of flirtation with a seventeen year old, no matter how experienced—more experienced than Steve—he clearly was. He cleared his throat and sent a grateful look towards Bruce. Of course, he wouldn't have let Tony's flirting get under his skin if he'd known. By now, he had enough practice with keeping students at a friendly teacher-student distance.
Tony hummed in understanding, not sure if he should press any further. Steve wouldn’t appreciate it if Tony talked Sam into what they
After two glasses of wine and a few deep breaths I decided not to whine your ears off about how much I despaired over this last chapter and the way little Ian would come to this world (because I did. A lot. For a long time.), but please let me tell you that a lot of thought and an intense amount of research went into this idea. It's of course pseudo-science (with a few techniques in mind that might be possible in the future) but something I do think is possible in the MCU. And I genuinely believe that if something like this is done with lots of love and care and no ulterior motives, it's not something to be frowned upon.
are not the first arrogant jerk I’ve come across,” Steve retorted. “You think I’m gonna let you smart-off ‘cause this is a dream, don’cha?”
When Steve’s whole body suddenly started to tremble around him, Tony knew—if he hadn’t known before—that this, right here, would never be enough. That he needed to wake up with Steve every morning and fall asleep with him in his arms every night. He needed more time with him. More of that awed look on Steve’s face when he lost control. And he would do absolutely everything to make that happen.
The drink had been sitting in front of Steve for a while untouched as he mused. He finally took it in hand and drank down half the glass. What was taking Tony so long? Surely he would be here by now if all went according the plan. Steve was only mildly worried, though. Tony had a tendency to lose touch with time and the world at large. Smiling at the thought, Steve palmed his pocket and lifted his gaze to survey the room again.
The tone in his voice gave Tony pause. Like he knew exactly what Tony had gone through within those last months, and that wasn’t possible. He didn’t give that much information away.
Yeah, there definitely was something off about him, Tony thought. There was a kind of reservation to him that Tony couldn’t understand. Back in the living room, he’d openly smiled at him—looking as if Tony’s presence was something he truly
“You’re r-really warm,” he murmured, his voice already much more steady, and Steve stilled a little, when he felt Tony pressing himself even further against him.
It had… both proved to be a great help, seeing how Tony wasn’t dead weight whenever he needed to research something during a mission… but—if Steve was perfectly honest—it was also an even greater annoyance. Tony was now often losing himself in this network inside his head, in this endless world he could access via the virus, and it was…
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and held on. His movements mimicked Steve’s as he held him tight, one hand tangling in Steve’s hair to cradle the back of his head, the other bunching his shirt in a fist at the small of his back.
“You didn’t hurt me,” Steve said softly, as he stepped closer. All of this, each and every word Tony said, didn’t make the slightest lick of sense to him. He’d been there for Tony? What was that supposed to mean? But he knew he wouldn’t be getting any answers. It didn’t work like that with Tony, he never explained himself.
Steve frowned at that, and only realized that Clint’s daughter had come down the stairway, when he turned around. Clint leaned casually in the doorway, folding his arms over his chest as he looked down at the little brown-haired girl.
There was absolutely nothing worth watching on television. And Tony should know, he’d spent the past two and a half hours flipping through the same two hundred and sixty-five channels with nothing to show for it. There was news, home-shopping channels, late-night television, sitcoms, but nothing grabbed his interest or did anything to take his mind off of…
"Tony," he breathed next to his cheek. "Hey…" He pulled Tony's hand away gently, letting out a slow, steadying breath and tilting his head as though to indicate their location and predicament. "We need to at least look at what we've got here before I can commit to…" He trailed off, and when Tony raised an amused brow in question, he humped a little against Tony's hip for emphasis.
But, here they were, and Tony was clearly interested in switching. Steve wanted to give Tony what he wanted, and he knew Tony wouldn't hurt him.
There was a heavy pause. “They found out about Barnes’ identity. They’re broadcasting it as we speak.”
True to his words, FRIDAY didn’t respond to any query. He did have access to all of the latest data, though, including the team’s communication protocol. FRIDAY had auto-sent a danger warning to all of the others as soon as the building had collapsed.
“You’ve seen it before?” Bruce asked. He was still standing, his hands twisted in front of his chest awkwardly as if he still wasn’t wholly sure he was welcome. Which was stupid. And something he really needed to be put off of asap.
Natasha merely raised an eyebrow and remained silent, while Maria drank her coffee next to her. “In his defense,” she said after a moment. “They didn’t exactly give him a chance to do that.”
only a cop, wasn’t he? A single-dad who tried to take good care of his son. He wasn’t the kind of guy someone like Tony… someone so
Steve sighed, but nodded. He knew he could be overprotective when it came to his team, but this wasn’t the time. “What’s another mission, right?”
Dragging his blunt nails down Steve’s spine made him jerk up and arch his back, Tony grinned. “Practice away.”
He huffed and crossed his arms, toeing the table stand with his boot as he stared at the food between them. “We’re doing the right thing,” he told her quietly.
And Steve was desperate to keep his eyes on him—addicted, as he was, to the sight of Tony’s gorgeous face. And now that he was all but convinced this was real—or as real as the dream allowed—the thought that he was truly doing this with another man was nearly too much to handle.
He could hear voices from inside, one was definitely Tony, sounding more timid than Steve could ever remember hearing him, and the other was inexplicably chilling.
Tony looked down, bit his lower lip, and took a deep breath. Which meant he was gathering his emotions, ready to stamp them down as far as they would go. “Let’s talk about it later,” he said, confirming Steve’s thoughts.
Before Steve knew what was happening, he was unbuttoning Tony’s jeans and Tony was unbuttoning his. Steve’s shoes were already gone, he didn’t know when. Tony’s thumbs hooked into his jeans on either side and he pulled. Jeans and his briefs both came off in one smooth movement, then Tony moved away for a moment to shove his own jeans down and kick them off.
In the evening, they lay next to each other on the ratty blanket as they stared up at a crystal clear sky, millions of stars stretched out across the horizon, unfamiliar star constellations painted onto the black canopy above their heads.
Heedless of how Tony might've wanted to come across, he just seemed… vulnerable. Worried, probably, that Steve might be upset about this. He wasn't—not really. Steve pressed down a little against him, rubbing their bodies together, as if to show that he was still interested and that it was okay. He leaned down to kiss him again, a light touch of lips. "Good," he said, nuzzling his cheek. "So you know how you want to do this." It wasn't a question for now, but Steve figured he'd put it out there for Tony to chew on and come to a conclusion by the time it became relevant.
“There’s no way we’re prepared for this.” Rhodey watched while Tony resumed pacing. “We thought we had time before. That didn’t help.”
Here, right now, though, his arms tightened around Steve, and he was solid and warm and whole. And Tony simply couldn’t stop those tears from falling down anymore. The last time he’d cried—truly cried—had been right after Jarvis’ funeral, and that was over twenty years ago. But now, it felt
The beeping was louder now, and they moved in, briefly, their foreheads touching, before Steve stepped back, bringing a respectable distance between them.
Tony tightened his arms around his stomach and looked down at the floor. “Can’t take advantage of someone who's not there,” Tony murmured, stubbornly bumping his feet against DUM-E’s support beam.
Tony leaned in, and Steve’s hands flew instinctively to his forearms, his hips arching upward with foreign need. He was on fire—he was burning in ways he’d never burned before. And Tony was there. Tony’s mouth was on his throat. He moaned into Steve’s skin, evidently tossing whatever he’d been ready to say out the proverbial window and instead decided to drive Steve even crazier than he had already. His tongue licked along his neck, swirling around before he sucked down.
Natasha hopped off the last step onto the filthy basement floor. It looked as if no one had stepped in here for decades. The space was huge, the same square footage as the ammunition bunker above it.
“Everything worked out just as we planned it,” Tony prompted, and Steve knew there was a question underlying his words.
He shook his head. Of course nothing like that was happening. The Avengers would've contacted him if there was any sort of trouble. He shoved his hands in his pockets and shook his head again. This was ridiculous. Tony would be here any minute and Steve's head was all twisted out of shape. He had no idea how to broach the subject. Silly, because Steve knew Tony loved him, and he loved Tony. Steve rested his fists on the counter and sighed. It should be easy enough to just… ask.
They did not talk about much of anything after that, but the silence was a comfortable one. Steve eyed the door to Bucky’s room. While there was nothing to be seen through the darkened glass, and yet, it felt like the ghostlike aura of the room had somehow spread through the whole hallway. It was disturbing, and he didn’t like it. That Tony hadn’t left Bucky’s room in hours, hadn’t asked for Steve once, didn’t sit well with him.
Nat pulled Steve in for a hug, then caught Bucky by the hand and dragged him towards the front door. “Bye, everyone. See you in a week.”
Steve rose to his knees and straddled Tony’s hips, then began to shove his pants down with impatient movements. When he had it off, he took a moment to simply watch. Tony’s body hadn’t lost any of the shiny newness Extremis had provided, but he could pinpoint the newer scars the Sokovia battle had left on him, and he knew they wouldn’t be fading any time soon.
Steve's eyes flew open and he threw his hands forward, palms open to grasp his attacker by the shoulders. He rolled them over, hands smoothly gripping at the offender's neck.
Steve was quiet for a long moment and he could almost feel the heat of Steve’s eyes burning into his back, and made himself lie very still. He remembered exactly how Steve’s mind worked and therefore he knew that—whatever Steve would say now—he was probably already thinking of a way around the rules.
He had wondered often over the past day where they would be now if he’d told Ross to go fuck himself when he’d presented them with the Accords. How it would be if he’d had the foresight to see what was ahead. If he’d known the decision Steve would make. Would such realization have changed anything?
The door creaked softly, and a moment later, Steve stepped into the foyer. He didn’t look around at all, only threw his keys on a little side table and set his shield down next to them. His expression was a sharp contrast to the good mood he’d been in when Tony had last seen him at the Triskelion yesterday. Steve had barely been able to keep his hands off Tony, smiling and laughing his way to the supply closet they’d sneaked into,
Soon enough, they were battling each other with no reservation whatsoever. The water wasn’t getting any warmer, and they were both red-faced and probably stupid and reckless for staying in there this long. But dammit, Steve couldn’t care less.
What? Tony had no idea what that was supposed to mean. He’d rejected love? If the Eye was talking about Pepper, it really didn’t know what the hell it was talking about. Pepper had broken up with
“Natasha’s a clever one,” Steve replied, his voice steady even as his heart sped up to a frantic rhythm. He felt a small smile steal its way to his lips.
There was a long pause; Tony’s breath lingered in the air as his eyes went wide. “What the fuck just happened?”
Natasha stood up, arms folded. She looked at Tony as if she was preparing for a fierce argument. “He was back to himself in under a minute.”
"I'll take the blame," Steve said, lips brushing against Tony's as he spoke, "but only if you take the blame for doing the same to me."
“Maria!” Coulson’s voice broke out above the din, unusually harsh and authoritative. Immediately, Maria fell silent, and Coulson went on more quietly, “Now is not the time for this. Sergeant Barnes is obviously not stable… and who knows what he’s had to endure for the past several decades. The tower’s safety standards may not meet SHIELD’s expectations, but—”
“Which you should know,” Tony joked on a grunt. He bucked against the intruding finger, shoving down against Steve’s cock while he let Steve slowly open him up. “God, fuck me,” he ground out after many minutes, when Steve still had too-many goddamn fingers in him.
After getting him cleaned up, Tony tucked Ian into one large swing in the middle of the room and set it in motion, heading back over to the couch where he’d stationed his tablet. Ross had been sending him more and more comments on the Accords, and the irony of it all was, that Tony had a feeling that they were slowly reaching that compromise he believed the rest of the team might have agreed to sign in the first place.
Steve blinked, turning around and looking at her, and then at Clint. He wasn’t paying them any attention. Instead he was sorting through his arrows, quietly talking to Rumlow. “Our mission is to rescue hostages.”
Bucky dropped the letter and reached over, grabbing Steve's t-shirt collar with an iron grip. "How you survived so long without me is a mystery," Bucky hissed, then slid off the couch. "Go get dressed. Wear something nice. We're leaving in half an hour."
Tony stilled, his jaw tightening. He put the key into the door, turning it around twice. “I didn’t ask for details.”
Tony’s smooth skin was cradled snugly around him, as Tony arched his back. Suddenly, the memory of Tony rolling his hips over Steve in fluid motions returned to his mind. The image alone brought a groan to his lips. Tony was no less beautiful right now, only that his face was twisted into a grimace.
Steve chuckled at the wicked look that flashed across his face. “It doesn’t have to be perfect. Just has to be real.”
But it was too late already. Rumlow’s face held nothing but fury as he planted a hand, encased in metal, on Natasha’s chest, sending her flying to the ground. Suddenly, Wanda stepped up next to her in a protective stance and swung a hand, magic flowing at him, sweeping Rumlow’s feet out from under him. And then—Tony groaned in frustration when Rumlow raised his hands to his own chest.
“He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. The police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.”
“These quarters are a bit small in comparison,” Stane went on, while he used his cane to point to the room in general, “but perhaps better suited for a man of your standing.”
Barnes’ gaze narrowed, and Tony felt his patience beginning to ebb. “Look, I get it,” hecontinued. “You don’t care—about any of this. Can’t say that surprises me. But—”
“Why do you think he spent so much time here?” he asked Steve. “Away from home? Why do you think he twitches every time Stark Mansion is mentioned? His wife
Rhodes checked his watch. “About two point five hours ‘til total eclipse, but the moon will start darkening the sun in about one.”
By the time they left the highway to drive on to Gatlinburg, the sun was just setting outside. The Townsend Campground was situated right in the middle of the mountains, with a spectacular view into the valley, with its various waterfalls and hundreds, millions of trees.
The day was rather bleak, and Steve's mood mirrored it perfectly. It hadn't been the best wake up, and even after their chat and reconciliation, the day's task hung ominously over their heads. Tony at least knew Obi to some degree, but for Steve he was merely 'the guy who bullies Tony'. That wasn't a particularly good basis for any kind of relationship.
When he finally made his way out of the communal space and into the elevator that would take him to his own floor, Steve pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes, then rubbed his forehead slowly. Why was he hallucinating about Tony of all people? And why were they in ancient Roman clothing? What the hell was his brain doing?
“Looks like this is a dead end,” Tony exclaimed with black eyes. “Zero heat signature, Zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off, because…” He trailed off, frowning, then he turned around.
“But morning cuddles,” Tony whined, leaning up a bit so he could eye Steve a bit better. He was shifting his weight easily from one leg to the other, while pulling up his boxer briefs. “
“You… and me. I thought, when we met earlier, that—I don’t know, that we got over what happened. That we became friends. But you’re from the future, and… you can’t even look at me. Even four years later.”
“Okay, I don’t get it,” Rhodes said, eventually. He leaned forward to look through the windshield. “I thought you guys made up, finally. What’s gotten into him?”
With a firm grip on Steve’s arm, Tony suddenly led him around a corner and into the darkness of the balcony. “Don’t ever say something like that again,” he hissed. “Ever. You hear me? I owe Obi
“Life?” Tony shot back, cocking his head to the side. It was hard to make out Steve’s features in the dim light of the early morning. And things were still distinctively blurry.
Now, Steve’s uniform and a few weapons and even a new kind of shield were lying on the floor, strewn around mindlessly, like he couldn’t have torn them off of him fast enough.
Tony stood up at last and walked to the small closet in his workshop. He fetched a t-shirt and a pair of jeans, then turned around, searching for his watch. He
“You’re around,” Steve told him after another long beat. “Just not with us. You took a timeout from superheroing.”
"What you do to me…" he said as he pressed his chest to Tony's back, face burying in the crook of his neck. He breathed against Tony's hot skin, sliding himself back and forth, wanting to go in already but waiting for Tony to demand it, as he'd learned Tony tended to do when he was getting frustrated.
In the last few weeks, just as Tony’d promised, they’d travelled all across Southern Europe, from Italy to France to Spain to Portugal. In just a few short weeks, Steve had seen more of the world than in all the years before. He’d seen the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum, the Sagrada Familia. He’d tasted food he’d never even heard of before and nipped at wines that cost far more than all the money he’d ever earned.
The thought equally amused and horrified Tony. He’d only been around DUM-E for an hour or so before hell broke loose, but it was very clear that if DUM-E had to decide about some war strategy, he’d probably offer to send the other side flower bouquets and call it a day.
And Steve was so warm all over. So goddamn hot, open and inviting, and the picture he presented right now almost ripped Tony apart with the need to have him all for himself.
Steve leaned down to kiss Tony’s forehead. “That’s okay. You would only get a divorce and love me anyway.”
“Good,” Tony agreed. He leaned up on his toes and pressed a quick kiss against Steve’s lips. When he pulled back, a deep frown was suddenly very prominent on his face. “I didn’t know you had an appointment today. I have to be in Massachusetts in about three hours.” He sighed. “We gotta ask Veronica to stay a bit longer. I’ll try to be home before Ian’s bedtime…”
"I'll go. You guys wait here. Sam, see if we have any more snacks in the main kitchen," he said even as he was turning on his heels and heading for the stairs that'd take him to the foyer and the front door.
None of the utilities were bought in Steve’s name. He’d used his mother’s maiden name, a trick he’d learned while being trained as an undercover spy, as far as Tony knew. Natasha always told all of them how important it was to have a safe place, a place no one knew they had; a bolthole in case something went majorly wrong.
Next chap :) You guys still here? This chap is decidedly fluffy and maybe a bit cheesy, be warned! This is also the second to last chap and the last one with a Bucky POV. I haven't written an epilogue yet, but I figure there's gonna be one. I will tag the series as complete after Hold My Hand, but I do hope I'll find my muse to write the next AoU part, because I think that movie would be great with a bit Stony love involved.
As Friday let the newsfeed run across the HUD, Tony’s gaze traveled across the streets, and a bit of a déjà-vu took hold of him when he looked at New York’s ruins.
Over at the podium, Sharon was speaking now. Her eyes were unmistakably sad but she stood tall and proud, just like Peggy.
Barnes broke away with a sigh, his massive shoulders slumping in a manner that almost imitated defeat. A few uncomfortable seconds of silence spread between them. They seemed at an impassable standstill.
The sight had Steve stopping in his tracks. He gulped, watching Bucky’s metal hand tighten and his nostrils flare.
Wakanda was quiet. Tony’d never been here in person before, but he’d heard stories, and a city like Wakanda—
When Steve was finally lying naked before him, Tony took a good few seconds to simply look at him. “I missed you so fucking much.”
Perhaps that was all that love had ever taught him. How to hurt someone before they had a chance of hurting him.
He didn’t remember falling asleep, but he must have, for the next thing he knew he was waking up, and it was nearly dawn. The sky above New York was slate, and Natalia was standing by the windows. She was naked, save for his dog tags nestled between her breasts. He couldn’t recall when he’d given them to her, but in any case, it seemed she’d been telling him the truth about their past relationship.
“I don’t want to talk about it, okay?” Tony snapped. “I messed up for good, I get it. We’ll just get this trip over with and never talk again. That was the plan anyway, right?”
Staying in the shadows for a moment, Bucky took a deep breath, then followed her over the threshold. As expected, all conversations immediately stilled.
God, he’d never felt anything like this. Pure relief mixing with heat and something far too serious to be thinking about it right now.
After a moment’s hesitation, Tony started to hand him off, but Ian’s entire body stiffened and he wailed his protest loudly, almost hysterically.
Steve leaned back down, brushing his nose along Tony’s. “You forgot ‘incredibly sexy’, and ‘world’s best kisser’.“
"Good night," he whispered, ready to leave. He cast one last look around the room, but could barely see anything in the shutters-dim darkness. There were all sorts of schematics and tools lying around, and he even spotted a blueprint of what looked like a metal arm on wheels. Steve couldn't deny that he was... curious... about Tony's living space, but now was probably not the time, and it was certainly inappropriate regardless.
Cooper, biting his lower lip, shook his head, only raising the plane a little higher, and that finally seemed to do the trick. “Nice plane you got there,” Tony said, crouching down in front of Cooper. “Want me to take a look?“
It would likely be a good idea to follow Steve’s lead for now—Tony had to admit that. He knew Steve was afraid to muck up his future—and Tony didn’t want to be responsible for ruining it.
Steve shrugged. There was a light stubble on his cheeks by now, and he looked as tired as Steve was able to. “Better, I think. Moving around a bit more. No new panic attacks.”
These past two days had been the best of his life. The absolute best. And despite all of Tony’s happiness, he was terrified. Not just about Rhodey—this, this was the beginning of a whole new life. His own future seemed to be set in stone and Steve? Steve would be in California, soon. And Tony would’ve liked to believe that they could make the long-distance thing work, but… at the end of the day, there was no telling if this was truly the beginning of something, or also the end of it.
There was a pause and Barnes looked down at the paper with the same expression Steve always sported when he didn’t yet know where to start with a new drawing. Then he put the pen down, and with slow, perfectly executed strokes, he wrote his full name down on the line.
There was a picture frame on a small end table in front of him and a smile rose to Steve’s lips as he took it in his hands. The photograph showed all of the initial Avengers—Nat, Bruce, Thor, Clint, Tony and him. Steve remembered the moment well. It had been a couple of months after the Chitauri invasion, just after they had moved into Avengers Tower. Tony had declared it a ‘Historic Event’ and forced them to wear their full battle gear as they posed on the landing platform of Avengers Tower.
After Tony had taken a long breath, seemingly coming to terms with whatever demons haunted him in here, he walked further into the room, and Pepper, Rhodey, Happy and Steve followed him.
Steve had forgotten what date it was—he knew that it was late-November, but the hours blurred together, and every day was an endless repetition of training, and reading, and watching the news.
"I think the wet bar is… not on this side of the wall." Steve decided against trying to touch Tony, not wanting to startle him when he looked so shaken, but he did want to help Tony somehow. He sat down next to him, looking for any signs of injury.
Natasha sighed as she leaned over from her place next to Tony, looking down on the countdown. “We’re cutting a little bit close here.”
“I’m—I’m really sorry that happened, okay?” Tony said, releasing a heavy breath. “I know—kissing a guy and all,
“Almost,” Rhodey confirmed. “Around 90%. You can see the shadow moving across the ground once we’ve almost reached totality.”
It wasn’t enough, of course. Not nearly enough for what Tony—and Bruce—had done in those last days. But there was a cloud hanging above Steve’s head, obscuring his thoughts, and for now, he couldn’t think of anything other than seeing Bucky again.
“No, I mean… you taking the front seat. I thought I had to be their handler because I know my way through these meetings, but… Maybe they need someone they feel they can control, at least for now. Someone who isn’t posing any sort of threat and—”
“Tony…” Steve started, as he realized that Tony was leading him in the direction of the bathroom. The idea of showering, of becoming clean, ridding himself of all the ash and dirt felt… wrong. How could he go back to normal just like this? There was so much to do—they would have to call in a press conference, monitor the humanitarian assistance, and he needed to make sure his teammates were alright, he needed—
Steve groaned at those words, an almost broken sound. He gripped Tony’s hips in a bruising grip. It was… maybe not the wisest thing, to immediately adhere to Tony’s lewd suggestions, but at the moment, the very primal urge to mark Tony as his own was too much to ignore.
Tony nodded, and realized that the light grasp of their hands had turned fierce and almost painful. Tony didn’t mind. He turned sideways, his body seemingly on autopilot. He met Steve halfway. They wound their arms around their middles, breathing each other in as they kissed. Steve’s hands were moving over Tony’s back and a low groan escaped Tony when the tips of Steve’s fingers dug into his scalp. Their lips brushed along each other’s, and
Peter looked down at him, his expression a little bashful. “You know… most people in my school, and May’s friends, our neighbours and friends and basically everyone I know… they don’t think about you badly. I remember when people started talking about you and Captain America and this new superhero team in New York. The Avengers have been… an inspiration to people for almost as long as I can remember. I know you guys had to deal with a lot of bad rep lately, but… the way you dealt with all those villains when you didn’t have to, and fought for us over and over again, just because it was the right thing to do, I mean… you’re
When the repurposed warehouse building came into view, Tony slowed down the Audi . He parked it in front of the entrance, leaning back in his seat. He sighed, brushing a hand across his forehead. “What am I even doing here,” he mumbled.
Okay, he had to take a deep breath. Maybe his situation wasn’t so bad. After all, he hadn’t been to the Facility since… well, since before leaving for Peggy’s funeral in 2016. Maybe Tony had just redecorated the place—maybe the Infinity Stone had just transported him here, a few miles away from New York City?
Unsure, he looked at the tools lying on a table and then back to the man in front of him. “Am I dead?”
Steve's lips curled up in a smile even as his sight hazed over with need. "Careful there," he said, tracing Tony's own body with a much surer hand, fingers lingering where he caught a favorable reaction. Tony's body wasn't as toned as Steve's. In fact, he sported a rather wiry form, which made Steve inexplicably more interested. He tweaked at a nipple, lightly rubbing it in a circle. "I get touchy about my age."
They fell into the right rhythm soon, one that wasn’t quite so frenzied. Tony moaned and clung to him; bearing down, he flexed his muscles. “I gotta…”
They parted and Tony breathed Steve’s name, drawing his eyes to him. He stilled a little at that, battling back the multitude of ‘I love you’s that fought his mouth and will for release. Fought the urge in his arms to take Steve into a desperate embrace and beg him to stay out of this. Instead, he traced a finger over Steve’s jaw, his neck—unable to stop touching. “Be careful. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
As he approached the main hall, Steve changed his long stride into a more stealthy walk, completely quiet as to pull of the sneak attack he was going for. He found a window and, climbing easily to perch just outside the ledge, prepared to attack the first group of mercs. He could hear them speaking with each other, their words coated with incredulity and sending vibes down the corridor. One of the men’s back was turned to him at present. Steve paused very briefly, planning his entrance, before he moved swiftly around the corner.
Steve pulled back, eyes narrowing. “You shut yourself off,” he retorted. “I wanted to talk to you and you brushed past me with a ‘fuck off’. And then you deleted me on all your accounts. For some reason, that gave me the impression that you didn’t wanna talk.”
“I’ll explain later,” Steve offered with a small smile, just as Tony’s eyes turned back to their normal color. “It’s… complicated.”
And he did. How could he not? He had known something was going on, and it made sense that the Zemo guy hadn’t just wanted to blackmail Bucky. There were larger things at play.
He didn’t know what to do with that, but then Steve set into motion, his hold on Tony tightening as he walked through the doorway. Tony let his head drop on Steve’s shoulder, and whenever he opened his eyes, he saw the broken remains of their home, the debris, the numerous holes in the wall, the shattered pieces of what had once been theirs.
Tony smiled. “Will do. It was nice to meet you, Sam. At least drop by for those upgrades I promised you, alright?”
It didn’t matter. Hammer might be right. Tony might still love his wife—and he might not love Steve in return. Maybe he never would. But Steve loved him enough for both of them.
Unexpectedly, as soon as the words had left his lips, something in the sleeping man’s form stirred. “Jay?” Tony mumbled, and a moment later, brown eyes looked up at Vision. His pupils were dilated, making his eyes seem almost black. Of course. They would have had to give him painkillers. As soon as his gaze focused on Vision, however, the soft expression on his face vanished. “Oh… it’s you,” he rasped, not even trying to hide his disappointment.
A wicked smile crossed Tony’s lips as he looked back at Steve over his shoulder. “Thought it’d be the courteous thing to do, as I usually don’t bother with anything at all.”
Once again, Steve wondered how old Tony was. He couldn’t be older than twenty-five, maybe younger. And yet everything he did, and said, made him seem so much older.
“Not much we can do,” Steve said, looking around. “Shelter’s in good shape, thanks to you. Maybe we should try and stock up our supplies, look for something that doesn’t require cooking.”
And then: a face he remembered. The face of a friend, golden hair, blue eyes. He remembered that face well, he just couldn’t recall his name.
Clint sighed. “Honestly, guys, he looks kind of like… a sack o’ potatoes.” He glanced up at Bruce. “Are you sure his mind hasn’t turned into jelly?”
Happy smiled, and shook his head. “Never mind. I called Miss Klein, she’ll arrive in a little bit, take over for you if you need it. Good night, boss.”
“It’s not about him. He’s just the tip of the huge-damn iceberg of all reason why this is a horrible, horrible idea that will ruin everything. We had a plan. A. Perfect. Plan.” Tony rubbed his forehead, before looking down on his hands. “What if they want to take detours? We don’t have the time for that.”
be, but… he... didn’t,” Tony said slowly, taking a few steps to the side so he was standing right behind Steve. “DUM-E?” he called, and sure enough, the claw was raised right above Steve’s head, its angle perfectly directed at Tony.
He was so used to struggling, trying to stay afloat. But here, now, was a life completely without complications or obligations. If before he had been fighting the current, now he was floating upon it, letting a warm drift carry him where it would.
Either way, Steve still had to protect Tony and Ian from every threat, including human ones. Maybe now more so than ever. And even though he couldn’t sign the Accords like this, he knew they’d have to make a few compromises to make it work.
And for a moment, Tony was awestruck that life could give them such breathtaking beauty. So many lights floating there, a universe of infinite worlds.
Steve’s apartment was in the second building from the corner, within walking distance of the Smithsonian and National Gallery. It was secluded and out of the way, and while the area was somewhat world famous, it had a small town charm that he knew reminded Steve of his childhood home in Brooklyn. Which was probably the reason why Steve had bought the tiny apartment in the first place.
“I was only half joking,” Tony murmured, thinking back. “It was never apples and sunshine with us, but I guess it all turned to shit when I built Ultron.”
“Good. That’s good. I’ll call in the others. We’ll do some tests, first.” At Steve’s confused stare, he added, “standard procedure. After the Skrulls, we have this rule about confirming everyone’s identity. I believe you’re you, but I’m not exactly objective.”
He looked up, pursing his lips as he cast her a meaningful look, part annoyance that he was that easy to read, part gratefulness that she’d done what she’d done. “Yeah, thanks. Glad to be back and all, too...”
For a moment no one spoke, and then Bucky shifted his weight and sniffed a quick breath through his nose. "Give me your phone," he said, holding out his hand for it, and Steve smiled as he realized Bucky was trembling a little.
“He’s heading for Siberia,” Steve said, then dictated him the coordinates. FRIDAY automatically calculated a flight route, forwarding it to the Quinjet in the hangar.
Fuck. He had single-mindedly destroyed every chance he might’ve had with Steve. It would be a wonder if he could even look at Tony this morning. Tony turned slowly and slid to the floor, his heart pounding. He felt tears well up in his eyes and brushed them away angrily.
He staggered and leaned against the wall for balance. On the other end of the room, Tony was bending to look into one of the monitors. Next to him stood Bruce, Doctor Strange, Natasha, Sam and Bucky.
Steve let both hands drop, and set his elbows on his knees instead, staring straight ahead. “Yeah,” he said, and it felt good—to acknowledge it.
